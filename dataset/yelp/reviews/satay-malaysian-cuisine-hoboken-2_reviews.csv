2021-10-17,2,Be careful when ordering from their lunch menu and eating in. If you can't finish your food and also the soup that comes with your meal, they will not allow you to pack the soup to go.
2021-09-22,5,One of the best roti canai I have ever had! It was fluffy and crispy at the same time. The bubble tea I ordered was also very refreshing.
2021-09-14,3,Not bad choice for a quick meal with friends/family. You can pay cash for 10% discount btw. I ordered Coconut chicken(not the official name of the dish)
2021-09-06,4,My first time trying Malaysian food and it was a positive experience. The food was fresh, flavorful, truly delicious. No excess salt/soy sauce to compensate for lack of flavor.
2021-09-03,5,This is prob my favorite restaurant in the area.  Haven't had anything that was bad.  We usually do take out and we usually order - beef Cheng mai, chicken trengganu, Indian mee goreng, kankung belachan ... always good.  They are pretty consistent with the quality. Delivery is always fast ... another plus.Dine in has always been a good experience as well ... friendly and good service.
2021-09-03,4,Cute ambience, and the food tastes pretty authentic. Service is just alright tho. The roti canai is good!
2021-08-28,3,I've passed by this place many times and always see people eating here, and finally got the chance to try it! It's a pretty small space but they have a small indoor seating area and outdoor seating area.I was super excited but I went with a group and everything seemed kinda average, but the pad thai I ordered was pretty bland. I couldn't really taste any flavor. I probably wouldn't order that again, but maybe would come here to try something else...The food came out for my group of 5 within 10 minutes after ordering which was super nice and the staff were friendly in helping us navigate some items on the menu.The prices are already very reasonable as they give good portions. However, they also do 10% discount if you have cash!
2021-08-28,4,Visited Satay last night, the food is always on point here! I've only had the Thai noodle dishes. This was the first time we tried the malay food items on the menu! I had ordered the Nasi Ayam Rendang. It tasted good but it was a huge quantity. After a while of going through the plate it became too much. We also ordered the Crispy Prawn. That was DELICIOUS. I'll definitely be back for more!
2021-08-26,5,Love this spot. Such a big menu. Lot of thai and chinese and malaysian dishes. Go for the roti canai!
2021-08-13,5,We loved the Bak kut teh soup, the taste is very Malaysian, quite different from Singapore Bak kut teh. I love the mee goreng as well. I have been loving it for many years since many years ago when I lived in south East Asia, but I didn't know it's Indian. Mango is not very ripe, not that sweet, it could be different from Thai mango.
2021-08-10,3,I thought I was writing the review before, but it was for delivery, oops! Basically I had to put the chicken wings and pancakes in the air fryer because they were oily and soggy by the time they reached. They were good afterwards. Didn't try the soup, mom was turned off after finding the chicken to be a little under cooked. The soup and general tso were ordered spicy, and they were plain, no kick, nothing. Which is disappointing for a West Indian, and any customer. Pretty expensive to not get what you thought. If that's Spicy, then I need to know the other name for it. $7.45 for 4 Wings is steep, and the pancakes, which are 1 or 2 cut into mini pizza slices were over priced as well, but we are in the middle of a pandemic, so I guess. Need to let the fried food rest before boxing.
2021-08-10,2,You'd have to pay me to eat here again. The pad thai is probably the worst I've ever had. It was bland and flavorless. It had the same flavor as white rice, which is to say none. I kept taking bite after bite hoping that some flavor to surface, but my efforts were in vain. I also had the beef Chen's mai dish which was also bland. Not as bland as the pad Thai but almost the same. I requested it to be spicy and there was none. At least the beef was tender. The irony of it all? The white rice (hainanese) which was included as part of the beef dish was the star of the show. It was perfectly cooked with perfect grains. If not for this rice, I'd probably give this place a 1.
2021-08-06,5,I'm still chewing the Roti Canai I ordered as I write this. Their food is on another level. I've never had Malaysian food before but I could tell with the first bite that this food was high quality! We got the spicy flat noodles and the string beans- both were delicious. My biggest regret is that we didn't order from here sooner!
2021-07-23,5,Friendly staff, homey atmosphere and delicious food. Variety of food options. Can't wait for the next visit.
2021-07-20,3,I guess this is the only one Malaysian cuisine around Hoboken and DT jersey. Chicken roti canai was good but the veggie one was not that great. Wonton soup was better than most of the Chinese places. Will try again to give one more try.
2021-07-06,4,This place was pretty enjoyable when I had come here yesterday with a friend and his girlfriend. They passed this spot on their way home to Jersey City, and we figured we should try it out.I had the Malaysian Milk Coffee with Boba, and the "Indian" Mie Goreng, both of which were very delicious! The boba in the coffee could've been slightly less firm and a little more chewy, but that might just be up to preference. The mie goreng was VERY flavorful, not spicy to me but others with a weaker spice tolerance might find it has a bit of a kick. The veggies were done great, an the shrimp were also well seasoned! I tried my friend's seafood tom yum koong and it was ABSOLUTELY amazing!Ended off the night with some fried ice cream; the ice cream was pretty standard but the dough had a thick sugar crust on it that was just a little bit too sweet for me.Waitstaff was very attentive to our table and our main server was very friendly! Would definitely come here again!
2021-07-05,5,This is one of the most underrated places in Hoboken and one of the best Malaysian restaurants I've been to! It's BYOB so definitely be sure to take advantage of that. The service is quick and the wait staff is really nice. The food here is absolutely delicious! Their menu has a nice range so there's something for everyone and the portions are big. If you're on a budget this is a great place to eat family style with friends or secure leftovers for the next day. Some of my favorite dishes include the roti canai and the nasi bamboo but honestly you can't go wrong with anything on their menu!!
2021-06-22,5,It seems to defy the laws of physics that they can maintain such a long and diverse menu, with expertise in a wide range of flavors, and somehow have the fastest pickup/delivery times in the area.I'm glad that two decades in I haven't run out of new things on the menu. Tonight for the first time I got Penang Lobak - the pork roll is outstanding on its own but the other elements like the fried shrimp pancake are also compelling and the chili sauce is a knockout.I revisited the achat, pickled vegetables with peanut sauce, a perfect summer item if you're looking for something light but more memorable than salad.
2021-06-20,2,I ordered Pad Thai and am disappointed. the noodles it came with were very thin noodles not typical flatt rice noodles and it tastes so bland altogether. I asked for extra side which was missed in the order
2021-06-15,5,God bless Satay for offering delivery to Jersey City. This is my favorite Asian noodle spot in all of Hudson county. The chicken pad Thai is amazing and not too spicy, just right. The roti canai..... SPECTACULAR. I could drink the curry it's so good. To be honest I never eat the potatoes or chicken, but the curry is life. I love the flat beef noodles, and the sticky mango rice- so so good. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
2021-06-10,5,This spot is awesome, super friendly staff and great service. I would recommend the strip bass fish and the lamb dish (from chefs special) . I also tried this cool coconut pudding which was really good too.
2021-06-08,3,I like the veggie curry dish very much. But they replaced the veggie dumplings I ordered with pork dumplings without notification. Since it's a takeout, I didn't notice that till I arrived home. It's so disappointing.
2021-05-14,1,Ordered the Kueh Teow Soup because I was craving this dish from Nyonya in NYC.  The description is accurate as to what this dish should entail however what I received was sub par, way below average and borderline a mockery of this Malaysian dish.First of all, it came with rice noodles not the correct flat noodles.  This texture single-handedly changes the entire dish.  There is literally nothing to make up for this and I thought this would be the disappointment of the dish.  But wait there's more...2 pieces of chicken an inch long at best.  6 chopped up pieces of 1 choy sum.  4 shrimps.  Broth is bland and is missing the sesame oil and spice reminiscent of Malaysian flavors.For $12.95 there needs to be more effort.  Funny thing is you can find this dish in Manhattan for cheaper.  Fail.
2021-04-29,4,This spot is in a really great location, and the employees are super nice & friendly :) I got a veggie dish (which comes with rice) and chicken skewers for ~$25. Pro-tip: if you order online or pay in cash, you get 10% off your order! The veggie dish came stir fried with shrimp paste and the portion size is a LOT. Definitely worth your money. The chicken skewers come with 5 pieces and some zucchini and onion. I didn't get to snap a pic, but overall my meal was yummy and made quick! Would recommend to anyone in the area who wants to try Malaysian food :)
2021-04-27,5,Ordered the pad Thai and soup. So tasty! The Pad Thai is sooo good! It doesn't have too much tomato sauce flavor but salty and spicy! Chicken is tender and the tofu is yummy too! I love it! It came so fast only 20 mins! Amazing!
2021-04-15,4,For a long time, it's really hard to find authentic Asian food around this area. This place is a really gem! Wide selection of all sorts of Malaysian dishes and more! Love the unique flavors of the dishes.
2021-04-14,5,Got this place for takeout and it was BOMB. Definitely check it out if you're craving Malaysian. FOOD:-- Roti canai: staple go to. Definitely good but not out of this world imo -- Prawn mee: only thing we got that I was meh about. Pass on this -- Satay spare ribs: SO GOOD. Definitely get it, the sauce is so good. -- Udang Trengganu - this is shrimp in coconut curry and was definitely the best dish we got. I loved it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
2021-04-06,4,Finally came here for lunch after so long. The food was still as good as before except the restaurant was not as busy.
2021-04-04,5,So good!!! My favorite Asian takeout spot now. Sooo good. We got their fried rice, curry, lo mein, pad Thai, and egg roll. My favorite was their curry with the coconut rice. Amazing, kind of spicy but nothing too crazy. I love how there are SOOO many options on the menu... literally, it's huge! But great options. Will definetly takeout again and excited to try it in person as well !
2021-03-16,5,Now THIS is some quality food!I used to get Malasian food all the time with my family, and haven't in quite some time. I am a sucker for peanut satay, and roati canai and had a nostalgic craving for both. Luckily this place is located in Hoboken, so I decided to give it a try.Zero letdown here! I was ecstatic with the amount of peanut satay that was given as I probably can eat it like soup! Everything tasted as expected and when im in the mood for malasian food, I will not look any further than my own backyard! Great quality food right here!
2021-03-04,4,Delicious! Ordered some food for pickup on a Thursday night and was very happy with the accurate preparation time. This menu was EXTENSIVE. Felt like I'd read a novel by the end of it. Satay actually has two menus for the two cuisines they serve (Malaysian and Chinese) I decided to order two noodle dishes (one from the Malaysian and one from the Chinese menu) that were seemingly very similar (the Chow Kueh Teow and the chow fun) Not surprisingly... they were almost exactly identical. Except for the chicken in the chow fun and the squid and shrimp which come with the Chow Kueh Teow. With the Chow Kueh Teow you are able to select a spice level (I chose medium) but this was more mild to me. Unfortunately there was no spice option for the chow fun. Both noodle dishes were served with bean sprouts, scallions and fried egg pieces. Very tasty. I liked the Chow Kueh Teow because the spice added a great flavor. If I had to choose between the two... I would reorder the Chow Kueh Teow over the chow fun. Sadly though, my Chow Kueh Teow came with only 3 shrimp. Three!pretty disappointing. The egg roll was pretty standard but the real star of the show was the mango sticky rice. The green sauce (which I found out through yelp is supposed to go on top) made the dish super tasty. Would definitely order again. Definitely check this place out! If you are a fan of flat rice noodles like me, Satay has plenty of options to choose from!
2021-02-20,4,Had the sesame spare rib lunch special for my birthday and I absolutely loved it! Only thing is I wouldn't recommend the vegetable soup, was not as tasty as I expected it to be.
2021-02-19,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken! If you're looking for an appetizer I'd highly recommend the chicken satay! The peanut sauce it comes with is delicious. This appetizer also comes with a cucumber onion salad which also tastes amazing if you dip it in the peanut sauce. For the main course I always get the duck special with coconut rice. It's my go to and it never lets me down! Portions are reasonable. I usually have half of the duck left and finish all the rice so I'd recommend ordering another side of rice with this dish.The restaurant is COVID safe. All employees were wearing masks properly and all tables were socially distanced. Takeout is just as good as eating in!
2021-01-24,5,Amazing curry with shrimp! Loaded with veggies and large shrimp, big portion. I ordered the Udang Trengganu and it was the favorite dish at the table.
2021-01-20,2,I have frequented this restaurant for many years. It is my go to lunch or dinner spot whenever I am in Hoboken. I have introduced so many of my friends to this place over the years. On the exterior it doesn't really look like much compared to other hip dining spots in Hoboken so most of my friends have never eaten there prior to my introduction. This may sound bizarre but my favorite items there are their infused rices, specifically the ginger rice and the coconut rice. Everything else I order is an accessory to those staple items. If you're Asian, I'm sure you'll understand my passion haha. I've tried many times to recreate it at home but have yet to capture the subtle infusion of flavors that does not overpower the rice flavor itself and instead perfectly compliments every bite of whatever entree you happen to pair it with. On this occasion, I ordered the sizzling beef and chicken pad thai. So why the low rating? I was disappointed by my most recent dining experience. Upon walking in, I noticed a lot of tables were occupied in the cramped main section so I asked the waitress to seat us by the door where it was a bit more isolated. I wanted to feel safe while eating unmasked indoors. The second she led us to that table an older waitress immediately began to bark at her in another language and was obviously peeved at where we were seated. I brushed it off, settled in, and browsed the menu. The older waitress then came to take our order. When asked about two options I was torn between, her answer was curt and unhelpful. I then placed my order and she asked if I wanted to order a drink but I decided to stick with water and she promptly offered to throw away my Starbucks that was more than half full. I had purchased something to keep me warm while walking outside and didn't feel like wasting it so I told her I was going to hang onto it. She then walked away and next time she came back, she brought up my Starbucks drink AGAIN. This time she said not to bring outside drinks inside because they serve drinks there. I would understand if I brought Starbucks into another cafe, but the fuss she was making and the tone she was saying it in was truly hard to understand as I was sitting in a full on restaurant serving Asian cuisine. In fact, I ordered two entrees and two sides for two people, it seemed like I ordered a fair amount of food. Again, I respect when people express the rules of their establishment respectfully but from the moment we walked in she had been giving us the worst attitude. It's a hassle and risk every time I choose to dine out and support my favorite small businesses during a pandemic. It would go a long way to treat your customers with respect instead of making it about every last buck you can get out of them. Dining out is all about the ambiance and experience and when the people behind it lack basic hospitality, no matter how good the food is, it all but leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Sad to give this former favorite such a poor review but it's only fair to be honest so that they can improve and hopefully provide a better experience for customers in the future.Oh and as if this all wasn't bad enough, she made a point to pick up the signed receipts while I was still seated and emphatically checked how much we had tipped in front of me. I have no words...
2020-12-15,5,Ordered during COVID-19 (yesterday) and was pleasantly surprised! We ordered a few things and my favorites I will order again are the Nasi Lemak and the spicy flat noodles with chicken. The delivery came fast and was packed well. I enjoyed the authentic Malaysian flavors and would certainly recommend!
2020-12-09,5,Satay has been one of my favorite Hoboken restaurants for years.  The casual space offers BYOB and a spacious, relaxed dining room.  Their service, whether dining in or getting delivery, is always quick and efficient.  I have occasionally ordered off of their Chinese food menu, sticking with basics like Steamed Shrimp with Mixed Vegetables or Chicken and Broccoli, and really enjoyed them.  However, the highlights here can really be found among their unique Malaysian options.  As an appetizer, I always opt for the Roti Canai, a crispy, flakey Indian pancake that can be ripped apart and dipped into a curry chicken sauce.  Their sweet and aromatic curry sauce is just heavenly!  One of my favorite main dishes is the Butternut Squash, which builds upon the curry broth with chunks of butternut squash, eggplant, and okra, simmered with your choice of protein.  While I still order that meal every now and then, my absolute favorite is the Sambal Udang, which contains jumbo shrimp, sliced onions, and bell peppers, all sautéed in a spicy Malaysian shrimp paste.  The portion includes a generous amount of shrimp and vegetables.  The sauce is like nothing I have ever tasted - spicy, salty, slightly fishy and funky.  It is extraordinary!  Lastly, I cannot neglect to mention that, aside from standard white and brown rice, they offer coconut and Hainanese options.  The Hainanese version is ginger-infused and more traditionally Malaysian.  This type of rice is often the tiebreaker for my boyfriend if we are debating between ordering from Satay or another Asian restaurant.  We recently also tried the Spicy Flat Noodle, which included onion, bell pepper, carrot, and basil leaves, as well as our selected protein of chicken.  While we enjoyed this stir-fried flat pasta dish, we did not find it as unique as some of our other favorites.I highly recommend trying Satay and definitely focusing on their Malaysian fare, a cuisine not typically easy to find in the area.
2020-11-04,5,do get the fried ice cream, shrimp dumplings (fried) and the coconut shrimp. the food is really good!!
2020-11-02,5,The best Malaysian food in the neighborhood, traveling all the way from Bayonne just to have this. Lunch specials are so good , portions and price!! And if you pay cash I get extra 10% off , pretty good deal !
2020-10-21,3,I really wanted to like this place. I'm from southeast asia so I know what authentic malaysian cuisine is. This is not it. I placed an order on doordash on oct 6. Delivery was timely but the food was disappointing. 1) Chicken satay: dry, sour meat, but the satay sauce was good. I can make much better satay than this. 2) Poh-piah: their version is vegan and bland. It needs more crunch and umami. There is a reason most poh-piah use pork fat (pork belly) and shrimp (shrimp stock or dried shrimp). If you want to make a vegetarian version it wouldn't hurt to include peanut, tau kwa (tofu), beansprouts and egg for taste and texture. 3) Prawn mee: why does prawn mee have coconut milk? It's not laksa! I can make a better laksa / prawn mee than this. I thought this would be good since it's expensive but the food doesn't justify the price. Order from nyonya or kopitiam instead
2020-10-03,5,From my experience, it's tougher to find Malaysian joints than Thai/Chinese places. That means when I find one I'm usually very excited...We got the Roti Canai (duh?), the Ayam Curry Mee and (based on Yelp reviews) the Chicken Rendang for delivery. I'll start with the only con honestly - the roti in the Roti Canai. It was slightly hard and didnt have as many layers as I expected. I reckon that could be because of the delivery and it getting cold though. The curry itself was delicious and the roti has hints of sweet which complemented the savouriness of the curry great!I was so impressed by the variety of flavours in each of the dishes. Well balanced flavours and frankly ridiculously tender chicken in each of the dishes! The Ayam Curry (chicken and potatoes broth soup with egg noodles) was definitely curry forward in its base, and not just was the chicken tender but so to were the potatoes!This was my first time trying Chicken Rendang and I have to say I'm a huge fan. There were definitely hints of heat from the chili paste (which gives a daunting colour I'll say!) but it was never overwhelming thanks to the coconut gravy ingredients. Excellent portion sizes on each dish as well!Definitely ordering in from here again!
2020-09-27,5,I have been ordering from and eating in at this restaurant for years and the service has always been amazing.  The food is always delicious.  My favorite dish is the itik palam, but their red curry, nasi nenas, roti canai, poh piah, and lamb rendang is also so so good.  For dessert, I always get the coconut  pudding.  I don't think I've ever tried something I didn't love.
2020-09-12,5,My favorite the best Rotis and as always I ordered roti Tiloor, with egg etc , stuffed yummy and fried rice noodles Chilli chicken all 5 stars
2020-09-05,3,It used to be better, people change and tastes change. I find it tasteless at times and greasy other times. Service is good although there's room for improvement. Satay is my go to for emergencies but not really a place I crave or think often about.
2020-08-31,5,Amazing meal...Had lunch special of Curried Chicken Rice, Egg Drop and corn soup and Malaysian Iced Tea...entree, soup and beverage were perfect...The service was excellent and the sidewalk Café experience on a beautiful summer day was wonderful...I will be back with more friends in tow.
2020-08-29,2,- Food is extremely oily. Having lived in Southeast Asia, this is not authentic at all- We ordered Indian mie and curry chicken, both of which were tasteless and drenched in oil. Ingredients did not feel fresh
2020-08-21,4,I've ordered from them multiple times and their food is quite tasty (never went for dine in though so can't comment on the hygiene standards). This time I ordered Beef Rendang, Indian Mee Goreng, Spare Ribs Lunch Special with coconut rice and curry soup, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. Let's get to each item one by one:Honey Walnut Shrimp - It was delicious! Loved the flavor of the honey walnut sauce and loved how they were considerate enough to send the sauce separately so that it doesn't make the shrimp soggy. Although I felt they could give a bit more of the sauce but overall it was a tasty dish.Indian Mee Goreng - Decent tasting noodles and no complaints with the flavor really but it wasn't for my flavor profile. I like more spicy kinda noodles and these aren't spicy whatsoever so if you're too looking for something spicy then maybe don't go for this noodle dish. Last time I had ordered Singapore Mee Hoon and I liked those better!Beef Rendang - Interesting flavor, more curry like taste. Last time I had Beef Trengganu and definitely that one was better and more flavorful.Spare Ribs - Perfectly cooked spare ribs coated with sesame BBQ sauce! Loved this dish too!Coconut Rice - Don't know what rice they use to make their coconut rice (they kinda have smaller granules) but it just goes perfectly with every dish. And I love how soft and aromatic they are.Will definitely be trying out more dishes from this place!
2020-08-10,5,Food is great! Came here multiple times, never had anything not tasty. Just note that parking is hard.
2020-08-04,5,I love that all of the team members at Satay Malaysian Cuisine are following Covid safe preparation practices!   All of the kitchen staff are wearing masks that fully cover their faces.   The food is delicious (as always) and the service is prompt.    Great job!
2020-07-26,5,Great food and delivery service. Easy to use website for ordering and has a discount code if u order from them directly. Tried the nasi goreng with seafood, lotus rice, Singapore mee hoon and one of the spicy shrimps. Dined at the restaurant some months back and liked their lunch specials then too. Will def order from them again.
2020-07-20,5,Called and ordered for delivery on a rainy Friday night. I was impressed with how quickly the food was delivered in under 30 minutes -- the food was still piping hot!I ordered the hot & sour soup, mango salad, plum duck, chow kueh teow, ice kacang, and shrimp dumpling. Everything was delicious and flavorful, but my favorite was the plum duck. It was deliciously seasoned and moist.This is definitely going on my list of go-to spots.
2020-06-28,4,Get the roti canai!! I have had some other things from here but the roti canai is just perfection! I know it's considered an appetizer but I wish there was a larger meal sized version so I normally get 2 of these and I'm not disappointed the other stuff here is great too but do not pass up the roti canai (if you can't tell I love it haha)
2020-06-28,3,Growing up in Southeast Asia, I have certain expectations when it comes to authentic SE-Asian food. Satay has some hits and some misses in terms of their food but the pickup experience was seamless (through DoorDash).Indian Mee Goreng - the best out of all we ordered! Each strand of noodle is well seasoned and flavorful. Came with big, juicy shrimps. The fried tofu, bean sprouts, chopped peanuts and accompanying slice of lime gave the dish an interesting dimension and texture. Chow Kueh Teow - halfway authentic but not exactly. Dish included big, juicy shrimps, bean sprouts and eggs. It doesn't have the "wok char", reminds me more like pad see ew with kueh Teow toppings but still enjoyable. Roti Telur - It's like roti prata with eggs and onions. The roti was slightly soggy, doesn't have the chew or crispness. Came with Curry chicken dipping sauce. Pricey ($10) for the portion size. Chili Ayam - underwhelming. Chili padi gave the dish a spicy kick but otherwise it lacked of flavor. It's basically pieces of chicken and broccoli with watery sauce.
2020-06-28,3,Ordered 4 dishes during the COVID 19 period. Overall experience is ok as there's some misses in the dishes.Indian mee goreng is the best of the 4 dishes. It's flavorful.Chow kueh teow is the 2nd. It's not as charred and flavorful as the Indian mee goreng. It's good but not the best among those that I've tried in the states.Chili ayam has spicy after taste, but apart from that, it's not too flavorful. The spice sauce is kinda diluted and did not really infused with the meat. I like their hainanese chicken rice though which is fragrant.Roti telur is expensive for $10 as it only came with probably 7-10 slices of roti telur . The accompanying curry sauce is diluted and come with few pieces of meat.
2020-06-08,4,A nice malaysian/chinese restaurant in hoboken. Dined in here once and they get fairly busy during dinnertime. The menu can be a bit overwhelming because there are lots of options to choose from. Visited again recently and due to COVID, got my pad thai to-go.
2020-03-19,2,Ordered takeout and wanted to like it...but the food was hard to finish. There was way too much sauce, among other things
2020-03-06,5,My favorite favorite lunch spot - I'm a regularYou can see in the photos I always get the same thing, pineapple fried rice.Occasionally I go for dinner too cause you get 10% off your bill if you pay cash.
2020-02-24,4,Their dishes are pretty good! I get the Roti Canai every time I visit. The service is not great, the waitresses are quite rude. However, the food is good so I'll keep returning!
2020-02-18,5,Such a great spot. I was stranded in Hoboken due to an outage with NJ transit and I found this gem. Delicious!
2020-01-24,5,This place never disappoints with the food i have been here atleast 4 times now at different hours and always had to wait cause its always packed . Our favourite stuff to order is the Roti Canai, Indian Mee Goreng, Pad Thai and all were great.
2019-12-22,4,Love this spot. I've been here several times and the food is always good. If you're dining in, it's BYOB. Some of my favorites are the Roti canai, Tom Yum soup, and chili lemongrass lamb. Also, if you're looking for a dish similar to a drunken noodle, you can always order a regular noodle and substitute with a spicy basic flat noodle. It is so good. Highly recommend!
2019-12-15,5,I came here for dinner several times ,the food is great,the service is good. I'll keep coming!
2019-12-13,2,Food is pretty good but some servers are quite unpleasant and don't really know how to do their job. Today my waitress went straight from cleaning floor to serving me food. My order was almost thrown on my table as if she was doing me a favor. When I walked out I was stopped at the door because I didn't leave suggested tip. Seems they don't know how tipping scale works. Really a shame as food is quite good.
2019-12-10,4,This place has got its good variety...... and multiple vegetarian   options. The flavors are spot on . Although the mango salad was deconstructed its good to assemble as I like. everything we tried was deliciously good.Place seems a bit cramped when busy but good for casual dinner/lunch.
2019-11-06,3,As someone who grew up eating malaysia/sg food. This restaurant will not survive there.We are however in New York. If you are here order the roto canaiThe kuay teow had too much white pepper - it wasnt bad, but not rightThe Ikan bakar was OK - no fishy taste thoughSizzling tofu - where is the eggChendol - tasted like water.Sadly when I ask for sambal, they rolled their eyes. Will I come again? No.
2019-11-05,5,Favourite Malaysian spot in Hoboken. This is a small restaurant but with good interiors.We never miss out to order the Roti Canai!! Its one of the best things on the menu. Very thin and soft bread served with some chicken curry. For appetizers, we also ordered the shrimp dumplings and the waiter suggested to try the fried ones and it turned out to be amazing!!! So tasty that we ordered a second plate!! For main course, I ordered the Mango noodle to try something new but that wasn't a good choice. Probably the tangy flavour didnt go well for me. My husband ordered seafood fried rice and it was yummy! Our friends got pad thai with chicken and Nasi bamboo. The pad thai tasted decent like the very standard one but Nasi bamboo was a so good. It was fried rice with chicken, sausage and veggies. It had a different flavour and the presentation was also nice. Overall, 5 stars for the tasty food, quick service and pleasant waiters.
2019-10-20,1,Went there for dinner with my family. It is not authentic as I thought it would be. The Satay was extremely dry, tasted like leftovers, reheated and then served wit a lumpy peanut sauce. Prawn Mee broth is definitely made with commercial paste out of a packet and the Roti Canai was dry and crispy, not like the regular Roti. Service was not impressive, waitress was rude and not friendly when requested for roti to be cut up. Last of all, since the service wasn't that good, we decided to pay only a 10%tip, waitress came back, screamed at us and demanded for 15%!!!! There's nowhere in the restaurant with a sign posted that it is mandatory that all patrons must pay a 15% tip....tipping is not supposed to be obligatory, it is voluntary...don't think we'll be going back to the restaurant again!!!!
2019-10-13,5,It's a cute small place on Washington and 1st. I like the decor and food. Roti Canoi, Indian noodles, Singapore fried rice are my favorite. Even tho it's a BYOB restaurant, they have amazing selection of beverages which go well with the food. Prices are also so reasonable(around $10-12 for an entree).
2019-10-05,5,I was in the mood for some hot+cozy soup, and I ordered the Prawn Mee with classic egg noodles and shrimp for takeout. So yummy!! I love spicy foods, and the broth was definitely spicy with great flavor. Plenty of shrimp in the dish, too. The prices are very reasonable for the portion. $10.95 for my soup and it lasted me for dinner that night and lunch the next day! Will definitely be coming back to try some more off the menu!
2019-10-04,1,Horrible customer service. I placed an order and never got a notification that it was ready for pick up. Moreover, the people in the restaurant are super rude. I'm never coming back.
2019-10-01,5,Used to visit place often few years back and just happen to be in neighborhood and it is yet the same . Best part is it is very close to Indian food taste and for both vegetarians and non vegetarians . They have lot of coconut based curries.
2019-09-24,3,This is a small restaurant located in the beginning of Washington street! It's right next to Carlos's bakery. The food was good but the service was pretty poor. I would suggest take out or delivery! There is a perk of 10% off your bill if you pay with cash!
2019-09-23,5,This spot never fails to disappoint! I've had their spice basil noodles, their indian mee goreng and their lamb. All very tasty. Don't forget to get a roti canai! Service is fast and prompt. Can't wait to come here again!
2019-09-20,1,Stale food and bad service, particularly found them rude when we tried to sort our our bill. There was confusion around the food served and I requested for some curry since the chicken CURRY I ordered was particularly dry. Still trying to understand what "dry curry" is! Not coming back ever
2019-09-20,1,Extremely bad service and food. What kind of dish is Dry Curry? The food was stale and the Roti was completely overcooked and Crispy like a Cracker. On top of it the Manager kept fighting with us.Not worth coming back here.
2019-09-20,1,Just like every good restaurant that loses its charm after sometime, Satay has gone down the drain. It's very sad to see the standards go down in this restaurant. It was our favorite go to place. We were served cold stale food- it's not even hygienic!!! I would not recommend this place anymore, it was really good.
2019-08-31,5,This Malaysian restaurant reminds me of home cooking. I have traveled around the country, and this is my first time in NY. This Malaysian restaurant I rated #1 in my book. Must try:satayBeef RandanRoti Janai
2019-08-21,4,Very tasty malaysian food here.The place is small and the tables are very close to each other.The kitchen is semi open and you can see the chefs preparing the food.Chilli ayam and shrimp curry are my absolute favs.The roti canai and roti telur are very flaky and crispy.The sauce that comes along with them is delicious.They give discount if you pay in cash.
2019-08-07,4,10% cash discount! We come here relatively often, it's a decent choice for Asian food in the area. All the food is cooked to a good standard and the roti in particular is excellent. The house salad is not 'dressed' and you have to apply your own peanut sauce to it. All the fried noodle and rice dishes are pretty good.
2019-07-31,1,I thought it was going to be bad the second I walked in and it was.  The look on the face of the waitress as I said how many and that I'd wait outside for the rest of my party was discouraging.  I'm not sure why that annoyed her but somehow that did.It's been a while since I've felt service lacking in a restaurant as bad as this.  Satay really made up for it as if I needed it.  Asking for a place setting and extra napkins seemed like asking for money from her wallet.  Ordering was extremely difficult as one or two worded questions from the waitress, was neither efficient nor helpful.  For the amount of food we ordered; three Roti's, Tom Yum Soup, Scallion pancakes, Fried Fish, Fried Shrimp, Chicken Rendang, Singapore Rice Noodle and a Chicken Fried Rice, for four people, you'd think that on a slow weekday night, this would have garnered a friendlier vibe.Judging by the portion sizes, they were really good, but then again the prices were all more than expected.  The quality is where Satay suffers as the food was just ok.  Of all the dishes sampled the chicken fried rice was good.  The fried fish was beyond deep fried and super dry.  The Scallion Pancakes seemed like they were from the frozen aisle and a hard pass.  The Chicken Rendang was not the slow simmered spiced chicken that you'd expect.  The Roti Canai should have been great but bread wasn't layered and hard to pull apart.  The Singapore Rice Noodle seemed like it was a different rice noodle dish entirely without a strong curry flavor but a strong Belacan flavor even though we asked for it to be vegetarian.Hard pass on ever coming back.  Restaurants like Satay, with indifferent service and quality, don't value your business.
2019-07-16,5,Super solid Asian food option where there is basically none. I can vouch for authenticity; Satay would be above average if you transplanted it to Malaysia.Some of the dishes are a little greasier than they should be but over time you figure out and appreciate the stars of the menu. There is a 10% cash discount which means that it's possible for two people to come here, order lunch specials, and walk out having dropped one single $20 bill. Lunch specials are available on sat/sun as well. There is also a discount for delivery via their website (as opposed to Seamless et al).Service is efficient, warm, and friendly.
2019-07-11,5,This is my go to place; I come here at least a week.My fav appetizer is Chicken Satay and the fresh chicken becomes a delicacy with the spicy peanut sauce that they serve with Satay.Curry lovers: green curry (chicken/shrimps/pork) with ginger rice is a must try!!They have a wide range of menu; fit for all moods..can't complain ever!!
2019-06-23,3,Food was decently delicious but the shrimp chow fun - the noodles were burnt and had an oily aftertaste. The lunch options were decent size which comes with a protein over with rice options (e.g., brown, white or coconut) and a soup (e.g., wonton, egg drop, or hot & sour). We also got the seafood chow fun which were really good for dinner.
2019-06-10,5,Best Malaysian food I had in a while. Lived in S'pore and I know my food well. Roti cannai, beef and chicken satay and Beef curry rendang was sublime. Will come again before I leave town when done with my conference.
2019-06-09,4,Solid Thai but service is funny.  The waitress had no clue what was popular and didn't really care what we ordered.
2019-06-01,5,Took me back to Singapore where we enjoyed the Malay cuisine almost every weekend. Roti Canai is a must try.
2019-05-31,2,This place isn't that great. I been to Malaysia around 3 times, but my mother, who was with me, was born there and grew up there. She ordered the Nasi Lemak, a traditional Malaysian dish. It was okay, not exactly good. It was better last year. The chicken was weird and the curry wasn't that good. The curry for the roti canai was better, but they raised the price by a dollar. The lunch specials even went up $2. It was super weird when a waiter there kept asking if we were done. Very uncomfortable, especially when there was only like 2 other people in the restaurant. What was the rush to make us leave? They make you pay 15% tip or more, and if you don't, they go after you. Didn't feel like they deserve a 15% tip at that time, okay. I won't come again. I rather just go to the Malaysian restaurants in Chinatown, NY.
2019-05-28,2,Food is really good but, I had someone who stared at us as soon as we walk in and would not greet us on two occassion. Someone with me had a few veggies (beansprouts, onions) left on their plate they pointed at it and laughed sarcastically saying "why don't you tell us not to put veggies if you don't eat it"... but there was a lot of veggies... if someone cannot finish you cannot point to the plate and say that like they're your kid! It is a restaurant, food may not be perfectly finished everytime by customers and there wasn't much left anyway! So rude.
2019-05-27,4,Great food - slow delivery but I hugely recommend to ask them to make food spicy or less spicy otherwise it can be bland
2019-05-21,4,Never go wrong with mango sticky rice, the Kaya sauce is always good. Regular menu  not consistent something good sometime not so. But is the nearest Malaysian restaurant near me.
2019-04-24,2,Been here a few times and the food is always very bland. Only reason I go is it's a switch up from the usual Italian food in the area. Male who works there (who is not our server) continues to take food off the table that was clearly unfinished. We had to tell him we're not done multiple times. I understand if the restaurant is busy but it was not even 50 pct full even on a Saturday night!!! Overall bland food. Food quality was consistent with that if takeout Chinese. And service was poor. Note to owner- please take off the 10 pct cash discount sign outside of the restaurant it's chalked up, gross, and hurts the overall appearance of the restaurant. Pros- good interior decor Cons- everything else
2019-04-06,3,Through a little door on a corner of Hoboken you can walk into a very friendly and warm Malaysian restaurant. With Malaysian cuisine having a lot of influences, I expected a little more "pizzazz" to what they were serving. Nonetheless, the food was good and will leave you satisfied. My friend and I came on a regular dinner night and luckily we were seated before the restaurant was full. Ayam Curry Mee: curry, chicken, and potatoes with noodles. Sounded really appetizing but the end product seemed like all of the ingredients were just thrown together without any cohesiveness. If only it was as good as the appetizer. 3/5Roti Canai: Both bread and sauce was really flavorful. It seemed odd that they threw in a single potato and piece of chicken into the bowl though. My only real complaint was that they didn't serve enough. 5/5
2019-04-05,4,Delicious food! First time trying Malaysian cuisine. This place has great food! Awesome menu. Would have given five stars if it weren't for the bad service when they get busy. Wait staff had an attitude when they were busy. If you can't handle it, you're in the wrong business my friend. We frequent here. Love the spices of the curry soup! Highly recommend it. The curry chicken is great too! Love the eggplant in it. Peppers are crunchy and not soggy which I like too. The Roti Telur is to die for!! We order it every time. Highly recommend that too! Nice crunch to it and flavors blend perfectly.
2019-03-13,4,My wife and I really like this place. It's unassuming and small but a great Thai/Malaysian place for dine in as well as take out.We have ordered delivery from this place twice. Both times our food arrived in a timely manner, was well packaged, and was still warm. The dine in service is fast and friendly.I highly recommend the chicken satay, roti canai, pineapple fried rice, green curry, and the pan fried noodles. Stay away from the fresh spring rolls.Overall a great experience!
2019-03-11,1,Terrible experience. On Saturday I went to this restaurant with my husband and another couple. We order one Roti Canai vegetarian and another chicken. When the sever was placing the orders on our table we reconfirmed on vegetarian and chicken. After a while my friend checked and said both are chicken. We explained them how could you serve Chicken instead of vegetarian? They started blaming each other instead of saying sorry. They accepted their mistake but never told sorry or apologize for their mistake. Worst customer service. Will never ever go to this restaurant again. Rude servers. Just hungry for money without good food and service.
2019-03-06,1,Can you see the tiny piece of steel scrubbier on the tofu? OMG, it's disgusting! I ordered a pad Thai at 5:20pm and picked it up at 5:50. But when I open it at 6:00, the food smells that it was going bad. Terrible experience here!
2019-03-05,5,The food is always so tasty. Ordered about 5-6 times already and I'm never disappointed.
2019-02-24,4,This is the third time I been here. Every single dish we ordered is authentic and absolutely delicious. Their service could get a little bad and disorganized during busy time. Well they do get so busy for a good reason.
2019-02-20,1,Ordered here once and the food was ok. Ordered again today, the woman who hardly speak English was obnoxious and obviously trying to rush me. Their website is not working and upon check out doubles your order. Who are these people with horrible customer service? RUDE! Order canceled. Never again!
2019-02-16,2,We have been to this restaurant multiple times and found it quite decent. Yesterday we ordered a delivery and their food was a shock. I think it was the worst Malaysian food I have eaten. Their food is much better when you dine in. So beware!
2019-02-12,5,The place is nice with delicious Malaysian food. The Roti Canai (Indian pancake) was one of my favorite dishes, it was really delicious and cheap. I also like the Nasi bamboo and the sticky rice mango which comes really good with the sauce and the mango. Very affordable and a nice place to share food with friends.
2019-02-12,4,For Hoboken, this place felt and tasted pretty authentic, and for being in the heart of downtown, was low key, and exactly what my bf and I wanted on a cold Feb late-dinner night! There was no wait on a Friday night at around 9pm, and other than 1 dude, it was relatively quiet. BYOB is always a plus, and the wait staff were all sweet and attentive. In terms of food, we got a curry veg soup as an appetizer. It was delicious but we were happy it was only an app because the coconut base is pretty heavy. We each got rice noodle soups - he had pork, and I had spicy prawn (which was legit spicy, which I like). Both were a really substantial portion and super flavorful. Maybe even too favorful? His really smelled like pork, and mine really smelled like prawn. Taste was good but smell was a bit overwhelming at first. I'd most definitely go back to try other things from their extensive menu - for some quick, hot, relatively healthy and reasonably priced food nearby.
2019-02-12,5,The restaurant is close to the Path and it'll take you fee minutes to get here. Bamboo dish was so yummy and more than enough for two to share. We also had the pancake as a starter and it was also good. The coconut were fresh and you get to eat the pudding after you've enjoyed drinking the water. We had Mango Sticky Rice as a dessert and it was the best ending to a delicious meal. *I don't really know the Bamboo dish's name! We just showed the waiter the picture and she knew what we want. It has chicken, shrimp and chinese sausage cooked with egg fried rice and it was the highlight of our visit.
2019-02-11,4,I frequently come here or order delivery. I can't say enough about the roti canai, its my all time favorite. I love  the fresh coconut water !!! An added bonus is the 10% off on cash payment.
2019-02-09,5,The food and attention was great! I ordered the roti cenai, pork dumplings, a kari mee chicken soup, and a lychee tea and was thoroughly impressed. I'll definitely be coming back!
2019-02-07,5,The only issue I have with this place is the parking, Hoboken can be such a pain. The food is awesome. Good selection. Great flavors. Haven't tried everything yet but everything we have had has been very good. Nice size portions too. Mom and pop feel but in comfy small restaurant. This will definitely be one of our spots. They take credit but bring cash for a discount!
2019-01-19,2,Sesame chicken - pretty strange tasting, the sauce on it is more like a thick soy sauce glaze with an overly salty soy sauce flavor.   Chicken is a bit dry.  Also has some metallic aftertaste.  The coconut rice was ok, not the most flavorful.Soft shell crab curry - This was an ok dish, curry sauce is a bit bland and toned down.  The dish again was overly salty.  However the fact that it was soft shell crab on a special lunch menu was impressive.The price is good considering the area.  Need a bit more flavor in the dishes and need to reduce the salt by around 50%.
2019-01-13,1,Can't figure out why there are so many good reviews. Ordered sweet and sour chicken and a pint of pork fried rice to be delivered.  Arrived 30 minutes after delivery time range. Chicken was soggy. Couldn't eat it. Fried rice was only ok. Waste of $27.
2019-01-11,3,Really quick service (literally like 5 min) which i honestly wasnt sure if i should be impressed or concerned haha.But anyway the paid thai was still good and portion was big for the price.I like the interior- nicely decorated and a casual vibe. The tables are kinda tightly arranged so i felt a bit closer to the older couple next to us lolol but otherwise twas a good time catching up with friends!Service was quick and efficient.
2019-01-09,4,One of the few places which makes veggie dumplings without mushrooms. Love the chicken with mixed veggies(Adam basil)!Also it's probably the quickest service I have ever seen.
2018-12-23,4,We went to walk around theWashington St in Hoboken. Walked into this place Satay Restaurant. Very cosy place bubbling with people enjoying good food. We tried 4 different  set of dishes with uniquely varying flavors. See pictures and dish names
2018-12-19,4,OVERALL: Fairly authentic Southeast Asian cuisine served here at reasonable price. I would visit again if I'm in Hoboken.ENVIRONMENT: Fairly quiet restaurant with culturally informative interior decorations. It is a good place for small groups of friends and families, or even alone. FOOD: Prawn mee [3.7/5]- Reminds me of the prawn mee near my school in KL, Malaysia. Its flavor could be stronger, but personally I prefer food on the bland side so it worked well for me. The prawns were super fresh and chewy. Roti Canai [4/5]- It comes with a mini bowl of curry with potatoes and chicken. Curry is great and savory, while the flat bread (roti canai) itself is crunchier than I remember it to be in Malaysia. But I'd still recommend giving it a try!ADDITIONAL NOTE: You get 10% off if you pay in cash.
2018-12-19,4,Me and my girlfriend were told that this restaurant has pretty good Malaysian food so we gave this place a try since we were staying at an Airbnb nearby.The place was decorated quite culturally. It had many decors and posters that showcase the beauty of Malaysia. The place was quite busy when we came in for dinner. As a Malaysian, I naturally have high expectations for restaurants that pride themselves in serving Malaysian food. I ordered Malaysian's national dish known as Nasi Lemak  (Oily Rice) , roti canai (plain bread) and my girlfriend ordered the prawn noodles. My first impression with the Nasi Lemak was that it looked nothing like how it's served in my home country so I grew skeptical. But as I start munching on my dish, it tasted better than expected. They did not use the typical sambal chili (red chili sauce). Instead, they replaced it with chicken curry. The chicken curry was really yummy and the chicken is appropriately tendered. The roti canai was acceptable but not that amazing. My girlfriend really enjoyed the prawn Mee but I felt that it was lacking in spice. But overall it satisfied my cravings for Malaysian food.The restaurant had a 10% discount if you paid in cash which is absolutely great. They actually had a dedicated chef to make the roti canai which was really impressive. I also verified that the chefs are all from Malaysia so there's some legitimacy in the Malaysian dish they make.I approve of this Malaysian restaurant and would recommend anyone who is looking for some authentic Malaysian or Singaporean cuisine to give this place a try.
2018-12-08,3,We had ordered food for takeout. Food was good nothing extra ordinary. The roti canai was amazing!! The dumplings and curry mee were not special. But it might be cos they got soggy by the time we got food.I'll definitely try the dine in option.
2018-11-25,4,Great taste, but could use more veggies in the entries. Bubble tea I'd a bit too watery. But other wise great atmosphere.
2018-11-18,5,Somehow this place became one of my favorite spots to go to. Their lunch special is priced competitively (available until 4 pm, at least on weekends) and the food in delicious!
2018-11-14,5,This is one of my favorite places to eat primarily because the food is so delicious. I've been here about a dozen times. The curry is amazing. I always start with the roti canai, work my way to a curry soup, and finish with the curry spareribs or soft shell crab. The service is prompt and friendly. The food is consistent and the prices are far reasonable for the quality of food. I will done here a thousand more times I hope.
2018-11-07,5,Years later, this is my go to restaurant. The food is incredible and consistent and I feel their Malaysian dishes are best. The menu is so extensive I am still discovering new incredible dishes although I eat here at least weekly for years. The people are so warm and as I am a regular we are on a first named basis. I have so many favorites including the flat spicy noodle with chicken, the butternut squash okra homemade tofu curry, the ayam curry mee, the chow kueh teow, the lady finger belachan, the chicken trengannu, the lasi nemak, kambing halia, the roast pork noodle soup, the ginger fried rice ... the list goes on and on and on. Everything is delicious!!! Thank you!!!!
2018-11-05,4,Such a nice spot for some Malaysian food! Definitely not authentic and reminded me a little of the American version of Thai cuisine, but the food was good. And portions were fair as well. We tried the spicy fried noodles and a veggie curried dish, both were served hot and were yum. For dessert we had the fried ice cream, weren't disappointed.
2018-10-21,4,I'm so happy I found a great local Malaysian restaurant in the area. This place is cozy and is a great spot for date night. I've been here twice during the weekend for dinner and haven't had to wait long for a table.To start we ordered two regular bubble teas which were good. For our appetizer, we chose the roti canai...you can't go wrong with this dish. It's spicy  and served with a small piece of meat and potato along with roti for dipping. For my main I had the chow kueh teow and let me tell you...this might have been the best I've had. The shrimps are huge and you get a generous amount of seafood within the noodles. And be prepared because this dish is spicy but not over the top (for me at least). My friend ordered the clay pot noodle soup and said it was good but could have used a bit more flavor. The last time we were here we also tried the Trengganu Duck which was so aromatic and flavorful, but sadly I believe it is a special. Overall I highly recommend this place especially if you're craving some yummy noodles.
2018-10-19,1,I ordered the Fried Rice Lunch Special online today. I would tell you how the food was, but I didn't get to eat. it. It arrived in a timely fashion, but when I opened the dish I saw there was shrimp in it, and I am very allergic. I double checked the menu to see if I missed it, but, alas shrimp was no where noted in the description. I called and a woman answered. I told her the situation, and asked if there was anything that could be done to help me out. I even offered to pick up a new dish so they didn't have to re-deliver. (Note: I work in client services, so I was as polite as could be.) She was immediately rude -- in fact, probably the rudest person I have ever spoken to. (Again, I work in client services, so that's a statement.) She said it's not her fault that I didn't call to confirm there was no shrimp in the dish. I replied and said it was not noted, so I didn't think I had to. She replied by saying she has "so many menus" online and it's not her job to keep track of them all (it's not??), and it's my "fault" I have a shrimp allergy. It was incredible. If someone is going to be so rude and lose a customer instead of remaking a $6 dish, then that's not the establishment I want to support. There are so many delicious places in Hoboken and JC that treat their customers fairly. Definitely wouldn't recommend going here.
2018-10-14,2,BEWARE check your bill!! Roti canai was crispy. The curry was way too thin you could not dip the Roti in it! Fried rice was very bland. The Singaporean noodles tasted like it had ketchup in it and this was supposed to be a spicy dish!! On top of all that we were only 3 people and 15% gratuity was mandatory and they wanted more after that.
2018-09-21,4,I like the food this restaurant serves. One of my Asian friend told me it's not authentic but it's not completely customized either. So if you are around the neighborhood then do try this place. Below is my order and rating for each:Shrimp Dumpling - 5/5Roti paratha - 5/5Chilli Ayam- 4/5Sautéed Shanghai bak choy 4/5Fresh coconut drink 4/5My brother tried pork dish and both of us don't remember the name, he loved it.Service-4/5Parking - since it's Hoboken, it's difficult to get space easily. We had to park near Hotel W at river street.Ambience -3/5
2018-09-17,5,This is my absolute favorite spot in hoboken. Everything I have had from them wether it's dine in or take out has always been amazing. Their sauces are complex and delicious. The portions are huge and their menu has so many options. Some favorites are roti paratha, Udang Trengganu - jumbo shrimp in yellow curry with coconut milk, Curry spare ribs, Malaysian fried noodles, Trengganu Chicken, And the coconut pudding. Highly recommend if you are in the area.
2018-09-09,4,Great selection of lunch special. Love it more for cash discount! Like it that I get to choose type of rice and soup for lunch special.Food is unbelievably good and wide in variety for small amount of money. It's Malaysian but they also serves Thai.
2018-09-06,5,I am a regular at the restaurant. I go at least once a week. Love everything on the menu. Friendly service, yummy food and reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!
2018-09-02,1,Worst experience ever. We went there for lunch -the drinks were extremely sweet. The fried rice had stones in it and the staff didn't seem to care. Highly overrated.
2018-09-01,5,I've been looking for a good authentic Malaysian restaurant near jersey city.  Ive tried their roti canal and satay (it's in the name) and it's everything I was hoping for!  Great casual atmosphere and fast service make this a great experience!
2018-08-27,4,10% discount with cash payments!One of the better Asian places in Hoboken. A pretty authentic Malaysian place with really solid lunch special prices! The portions could be a little bigger in my opinion. I love the noodle dishes here, definitely one of my go-tos when my family's in town!
2018-08-24,5,Satay is my go to place in Hoboken. I have been going there for years and their food taste has remained the same.My recommendations:1. Appetizers - Roti Canai2. Entrees - randang curry and nasi lemak3. Desserts - coconut pudding (awesome)
2018-08-21,4,Make sure you go through their stacks of menu - they have two separate pages of lunch specials (one with Chinese, one with southeast Asian options). So many choices and available on the weekends too?!Green curry shrimp, coconut rice, and curry soup for $7.95 plus tax. Decent portion and taste. The green curry was aromatic, sweet, yet savory all combined in one. Pay in cash you get an additional 10 percent off. What a steal! Def worth checking out for endless, tasty lunch options.
2018-08-03,1,Too bad the staff and management  are rude and unprofessional because the food is amazing. There is no air conditioning. They charged my card with a 15% tip when I gave them them card to charge for my dinner. In understand when restaurants charge with a large group but it was only my friend and I.
2018-07-29,5,We went there twice. For both time we ordered the indian bread for dessert and neither disappointed us- it is really good. The fired noodle was also well-cooked; the noodle soup is ok but not as standing out as the preceding two.
2018-07-25,5,Good service, nice view of the bustling town while sitting outside in a Sunday afternoon, and great food! I recommend the roti canai, delicious buttery with a side of chicken curry gravy. The noodles and rice dishes were great as well.
2018-07-20,4,lovely Thai spot in Hoboken, the food is solid and flavorful. The prices are as expected much higher, very likely because Hoboken is a generally expensive place. That aside, the service is not necessarily the warmest but they function and get the food out on time. You are encouraged to pay by cash, to the tune of a 10% discount if you do. If their service jumps up to the quality expected for families in Hoboken they'd easily be a 5 star review. Then again, you can tolerate a little awkward service if the food is genuine and tasty.
2018-07-14,3,Gratuity added for a group of 2? Food is not bad and if you want to try malaysian/Asian fusion in hoboken then you could go to Satay. And you should definitely have their roti canai! But they added 15% gratuity for just 2 people? They also offer 10% discount if you pay by cash. What???Staff is not friendly. We won't be going again and will probably try another nearby Thai restaurant.
2018-07-09,5,Spur of the moment stop in on our Hoboken day trip. After securing a few goodies at Carlo's bakery, we decided to pop in. The restaurant wasn't busy at the time we went (4:15pm). We ordered a mango smoothie with tapioca "bubbles". It was refreshing.For dinner we thoroughly enjoyed the soft shelled crab and duck red curry entrees. The crab came in a homemade creamy coconut curry, it was absolutely amazing! The duck was flavoured by a red Thai curry, also tasty. Both were served with rice, we chose the coconut white rice.Great dining experience overall.
2018-07-01,4,Ordered the Roti Canai and the Kambing Halia (lamb with ginger) for delivery - delivery arrived on time, friendly delivery guy, food was hot and freshly prepared and tasted phenomenal. Chicken in the Roti Canai could have been cooked a little more but other than that the food was great.
2018-06-16,5,Char Kuey Teow, Lobak, Satay Tofu and Satay were phenomenal :) thumbs up and recommended by a Malaysian !! I'm so happy to finally find authentic Malaysian food!
2018-06-10,5,Got out of work early enough for a late lunch on a Friday. It was the same day of Anthony Bourdain's passing, so I felt motivated to try a new restaurant, a new/less familiar cuisine, and a new dish. I had heard great things about Satay, but I had never been. Additionally, I only had Malaysian food once prior (some roti canai in Morristown), so I felt motivated to try again with an open mind.The restaurant wasn't too busy, but certainly not empty. The staff was quick to seat me, give me a menu, and show me their lunch specials. I picked Mee Siam, ignoring my normal aversion to spice, and some egg corn soup (a variant of egg drop soup).The egg corn soup was thick, eggy, and reminded me of matzah ball soup: definitely found it filling and tasty, but since it was hot out, I was looking forward to something less heavy. The Mee Siam arrived, I took a bite, and immediately fell in love. It's a noodle dish that had enough spice to make my nose run, but not have me in pain. The shrimp was well cooked and flavorful, and the savory veggies and tofu complimented the salty seafood well. I ate slowly, and didn't even realize that I cleaned my plate until the waitress came to take it away.I noticed that the staff is a bit pushy with regard to payment--they incentivize cash payments with a 10% discount. However, that made my lunch special notoriously cheap (soup and a large noodle dish for only about $8), so I didn't mind this.Absolutely would recommend this place; a hidden gem in Hoboken!
2018-06-09,2,We ordered vegetable fried rice and singapore street noddles. Fried rice was not cooked properly , lot of rock salt chuncks in fried rice and singapore street noodles is very spiceless.Definetly not a great place to come if you are a thai food lover.We went inside by 9:45pm and it closes at 10:30. Servers are around our table looking to see when we can vacate.
2018-06-04,4,Yummmmy!!!Staff isn't very friendly and they always give you a weird look when you pay credit card. 10% off order if you pay cash. So just get take out lolThe food is yummy though ! I love their wonton soup - it's got veggies and deliciousness in it. Highly recommend it !
2018-06-02,2,Foods good but theres lot of attitude to the servers which is intollerant.. Went to this restaurant twice for food, thinking she had a bad day but this was my mistake.
2018-05-23,5,Tried this place out on Monday night and I was not disappointed! Was craving Southeast Asian cuisine and happy to say this place met and exceeded expectations. We were immediately greeted and given the option to sit inside or outside. The service was attentive and pleasant. We were given great feedback on menu options and choices given our personal preferences. The food came out quick and very fresh! The flavors were well developed and delicious. I also loved the variety of rice options - outside of white and brown there was also a ginger rice and a coconut rice. I will definitely be back here!!! Thank you for a lovely experience
2018-05-21,4,Food is amazing, lots of unique dishes and great prices for the lunch special. Def one of the better options in downtown Hoboken. I ding one star just bc the waitress barely gave me any time to order, probably trying to keep spots outside open.
2018-05-03,2,ingredients are not very good/fresh to be honest. Roti Canai and Satay Tofu are not bad, I'd stay out of Pad Thai and the Ayam Kari Hijau (green curry chicken).
2018-05-02,5,The mango noodle is definitely my favorite dish. Such a good mix of savory and sweet.
2018-04-25,5,I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  The curry potato dip is one of the best things I've ever had.  The pad thai is excellent as well.  My friend got the ribs.  They were a little to sweet for me but still really good.  I can't wait to come back here.
2018-04-24,5,肉骨茶 is pretty good. So is their curry appetizer. It's a good option for you to have an adorable dinner with good taste.
2018-04-22,4,Great food and BYOB. Everything was tasty. Definitely recommend. The Roti Canai and Chicken Trengganu rocked.
2018-04-02,5,I love this place and have been here countless times! May absolute favorite item on the menu is the curry soup; it is a savory broth with just the perfect amount of heat with some tofu and vegetable. I normally like to order a few appetizers with people and share. Roti Canai and Satay Tofu are two of my favorites. In general, I feel like a lot of the main dishes are quite oily whether it meat, noodle, etc... but that is just the style of cooking I'm pretty sure. The menu is a little too long for my liking, but everything on it is delicious! Most of the time I usually order Ice Kacang for Dessert, and enjoy the first few spoonfuls, but then it starts melting rather quickly and the flavors just get..... weird. I love that they started serving bubble tea and smoothies. The staff here is great, and they offer 10% discount if you pay in cash.
2018-03-29,4,I love this place. Great food and service. Mango sticky rice is a must have. Also, it is vegetarian friendly.
2018-03-15,5,I've been experienced both dine-in and delivery, and I have never been disappointed by the food. I can't speak to the authenticity but in terms of taste the food was flavorful and delicious.
2018-03-01,5,Favorite delivery spot in Hoboken! Always good on a lazy evening and food has so much personality at this place. Prices are not bad at all. Never disappointing!!!
2018-02-21,3,The food isn't amazing but it's good enough to take care of my cravings! There aren't many Malaysian options in the area. (I got my food delivered so that could've played a factor, as well).
2018-02-11,5,Phenomenal food. Reminded me of my mom's home cooked Indian food. You will love it. And get the fresh coconut water...most refreshed you will feel all day.
2018-02-09,3,Just so so ......i dont like my coconut rice as it's so sticky... And the chicken hainannes is kinda tasteless...a place for quick dinner...
2018-02-01,3,First time trying Satay by delivery. The mee goreng is good, not easy to get in Manhattan and the portion was generous.Don't get the Hainanese chicken rice lunch special! It's mostly rice with a pile of bones. I've had much better in Malaysian places in Chinatown.Will try the other dishes, but maybe I'll read the reviews first.
2018-01-27,5,Love Satay. This place is excellent for dine-in, take-out, and delivery. Whether you're looking for some legit Malaysian food in NJ or interested in something steamed and healthy, Satay provides.I really enjoy their Hainanese Chicken Rice dish that comes with the tastiest ginger chicken broth flavored rice this side of the Hudson. I also love the roti canai appetizer and prawn mee noodle soup. The desserts are good too! Every time I dine in, I try something new and am yet to be disappointed.When I'm feeling super healthy, I always order one of the steamed meat and vegetable dishes from the menu. I love their steamed chicken with mixed vegetables and ordering a curry or other sauce for occasional dipping. One of these steamed dishes comes with rice noodles, which are also really good. Other restaurants in Hoboken and jersey city deliver steamed chicken and vegetables, but I find that Satay's steamed dishes are the best quality out of the many that I have tried.
2018-01-24,4,We visit this place at least once a week, very affordable lunch menu. Dishes are unique and menu is big and many options to explore. 10% cash discount not definitely bad deal.
2018-01-14,2,We went to the restaurant around 9:15pm, they told us they closed at 1030pm. We figured we jad enough time to enjoy the food, food was great and delicious. However, everyone in the restaurant rushed us on everything as we were finishing any items we ordered they would takeq our plates without asking us if we were  done or not. We finished our dinner around 955 and there were about 6 people surrounding our table( i guess to rush us out and clean so they can go home,i felt so  In secure). I would NEVER go back here  just because how they treated there customer.
2017-12-23,4,Honestly on my list of top three favorites!! Go for lunch for sure, lunch special is the best. They come with a choice of curry or egg drop soup and there is a 10% discount when you pay in cash. The totals usually come at around $8 for lunch that's super filling and yummy!! My go to is always the softshell curry crab but I just had the salmon in Szechuan sauce! I think everything has a small but impactful kick to it (spice wise) and definitely a decently priced spot for a Hoboken restaurant!!!
2017-12-01,4,Great Food!Vegetarian Friendly. The curry soup is amazing.
2017-11-24,5,Delicious Malaysian food. Ask the Staff what their favorite food is: you'll get an amazing meal
2017-11-14,5,Amazing food! I highly recommend the Indian pancake , the chicken fried rice and the steamed dumplings. The delivery was very fast.
2017-11-13,2,Went here for dinner yesterday. Food was good but service was BAD! After we finished, we get the check. Waitress advised if pay in cash get 10% off. I said Ok we will pay cash. Bill came, it was full charge, No discount. I took the bill with cash to the register. Took the full payment and said nothing. I got my 32 cents changed. No thank you nothing. I stand by the door to get my jacket. The cashier asked the waitress, did they leave the tips? She went by the table and check and she told him yeah they left the tips.  BAD Service. Don't offer for discount with cash when you don't honor it. I should have pay with my credit card to get points. Will not go back here just for that reason. DISAPPOINTED.
2017-10-19,4,Tried Satay Malaysian Cuisine for a takeout lunch special and was very happy with the experience! Three of us ordered online from the office and walked over 15 minutes later to find everything ready to go when we arrived. Online ordering is 10% off which made an already inexpensive lunch even better.Food was delicious - Curry soup had some mild spice and nice flavor. I asked for extra heat on my Mango Shrimp and was not disappointed. Seemed very fresh. The Hainanese rice was tasty. I'd give 5 stars if there were more Malaysian dishes on the lunch menu; seemed heavy on Chinese and Thai that I can get elsewhere- maybe I'll just need to come back for dinner to try some of the Malaysian entrees!
2017-10-18,5,GO HERE FOR LUNCH!!! For $7.50 you get choice of a lunch entree, choice of rice (get the coconut) and choice of soup (get the curry). Did i say ALL FOR $7.50?!??..... and SO good.**try the soft shell crab** (its not on the menu but they have it)
2017-10-07,5,This is my favorite lunch spot in Hoboken! They have a lot of lunch specials for ~$7.50 that include good portions and soup.The curry soup is especially tasty (and meatless) and throughout the menu, there are a lot of veggie options.You can also replace meat in most non-vegetarian dishes with gluten-based meatless chicken -- which I find to have a great consistency.Sometimes the rice dishes are a little dry, but I either save some soup to pour on or use soy sauce to add a little moisture.The service is also quite fast (but still friendly) and they offer a discount if you're paying with cash.Might not be super posh, but if you're looking for a big variety of delicious Malaysian/Thai dishes at a decent price, this place is great!
2017-09-23,4,Roti Canai with the Chicken Potato curry was amazing. Loved the coconut flavor.Tried Roti Telur with the Chicken curry too but that didn't taste as great as the Canai.Chicken Satay was fine. Malaysian noodles with shrimp were tasty. Overall, I did like the food here.
2017-09-12,5,So many delicious food!I can't believe there exists such a fantastic restaurant near my home. The taste is very suitable for Asian guys. I like Malaysian food now! Worth it!
2017-09-09,1,Went for lunch special and it was terrible. A waste of calories. Stay away!! Service was rude too!!
2017-09-02,4,Pretty good Malaysian food. Had the Chicken Pad Thai and it was served with lots of chicken and was of a decent portion size. Portion sizes were reasonable. Located right on the popular Washington St corridor.
2017-09-01,5,Great authentic Malaysian food. The satay is really authentic and similar to what you can get in "Kajang". Probably best satay in the US. The roti chanai is also very good. Other curries and dishes are good. Highly recommended.
2017-08-18,4,I love love love this place. Specially their roti canai.Please do go and enjoy the flavors.
2017-08-17,2,Got the Chicken Pad Thai and Seafood Tom Yum soup...I guess Malaysian and Thai food share some similar dishes?Anyways, the seafood soup broth had fabulous flavor; perfect combination of sour, savory and heat.  Unfortunately, the actual ingredients of the seafood soup left little to be desired.  The shrimps were ok, your average frozen shrimp you expect from most places, but they also put in really bad artificial crab meat (and I'm talking bad, tastes like chalk kind of bad cause you know those fake crab meats also come in different versions from bad to decent), ridiculously chewy squid pieces and a piece of scallop.  That's right, you read it correctly, a PIECE of a scallop...not a whole one, not a whole small one, but it looks like somebody either ate it and rejected 1/4 of their scallop and it ended up in my soup or the scallop had been cooking in the soup broth all day long and disintegrated into a small fraction of it's former self...either way, it's a lose lose for me.The chicken pad thai was fine.  Again, seasoning and flavoring were SPOT ON!  But the quality of ingredients were really poor.  The noodles were breaking apart, there was no chew or bite to it.  The chicken was poor quality/not very fresh as the meat was soft/mushy and fell apart...and not in a good way.Maybe it was because it was the end of the night and I got their left overs from the day?  Who knows, but what I do know is I got the short end of the straw.
2017-08-08,5,I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Ok so I will admit I have never stepped inside the place nor have I actually seen what it looks like, though I'm sure I've probably passed by it. But this Is my go to delivery place. Yeah the items are a bit on the pricier side. But you know what? Totally worth it! Their portions are HUGE so I generally have diner lunch and dinner again! And the food is delicious!!!I always order the green curry with coconut rice. Omg I dream about the taste of coconut in the curry. I think I went a month ordering weekly from here. And I only ever order the same. Their roti is just one pancake which makes it a bit pricy. It's also super greasy. That's one draw back. Their bubble tea, I had taro, was a tad disappointing too. It was a lil chalky. But if you're a vegetarian or ordering with vegetarians they have a whole vegetarian menu!
2017-07-28,5,Best Malaysian resto I've tried! The service is exceptional, our waiter was very patient explaining everything on the menu since it was our 1st time, and recommending their best dishes!!! The food is delish, price is reasonable, and this is a good place to go when you're hungry and need simple good food! Check this place out! :)
2017-07-28,1,We asked for vegetarian food...they claim everything is vegetarian and that was a pure lie..they have chicken broth they use which I discovered after I threatened them I was alergic...i will never step into this place ever...
2017-07-24,4,One wouldn't expect to find real deal Malaysian food on a busy stretch of Washington Street in downtown Hoboken. One would be missing out if they passed Satay by.I haven't gone in for a meal, but they do a brisk delivery (half an hour is pretty damn speedy for most places, but getting across to my neck of downtown JC from Hoboken on a Sunday evening that quick is mighty impressive) and the food meets all expectations.I ordered a seafood tom yum soup and beef rendang with coconut rice. That soup was pungent, sour, spicy, salty, and a little sweet (everything a good tom yum should be) with a small bit of baby corn, a scallop or two, a couple of small shrimp, and a strip of surimi. The rendang was on-point: meltingly tender beef in a spicy curry over fragrant coconut rice. Texture alone made it the best rendang I've had in a while.They offer some standard looking Chinese fare (noodles, stir fries), but I'll be sticking with the Malaysian side
2017-07-08,4,Food and service were great !!!!Especially ginger fried rice they nailed it Loved the spice and the way they carry their flavors in their meal And had a great selection on appetizers,and drinks
2017-07-07,4,Food was amazing. Definitely satisfied my cravings.  Client service was good. Wish the tables were bigger, or at least the table my husband and i were given. I'm 9months pregnant and we were given a table in the back by the wall. And it was tight. Seemed family owned. Which is nice and they speak Cantonese which was even better, as my husband and I knew our orders by heart in Cantonese.
2017-06-14,5,This is THE place to go to for chinese/Malaysian food in Hoboken! Their chicken fried rice is spot on! I order a pint size, thinking I'm going to eat half of it and save the rest for lunch tomorrow.. nope, that doesn't happen.. I end up eating the entire pint in one sitting b/c it's that addicting. SMH!!I've also tried the shrimp dumplings which were very good. I highly recommend their chicken and seafood dishes (haven't tried the beef). Pay in cash and get 10% off! It's on the way home for a lot of people so this is a great place for takeout! They're located across from Walgreens on Washington Street.
2017-06-07,3,The food I felt to be very oily, but also had good flavor. My favorite thing was the fresh coconut drink and their coffee was phenomenal. The staff was all over the place. We would had one person ask us if we wanted something else, another who took our order, another who checked up on us and a different person giving us the check. So we were confused as to who we should for something when it was needed.
2017-06-06,4,I don't know how authentic they are as a Malaysian restaurant, but their food is solid and delivery is quick. This is a go-to delivery spot that we order from frequently, though I have not stepped foot in there.
2017-05-22,5,Really good pad thai and good service. They also have a discount if you use cash instead of a card.
2017-05-20,1,Ordered spring rolls for starter and beef rendang lembu for the main dish with a side of rice.Simply put I was most disappointed with both dishes.The spring rolls were in no way appealing being both cold and tasteless. The outer shell was dry and hard to cut with the knife let alone chew. The filling was a mystery, the only identifiable item being a small portion of crisp lettuce. I was advised they'd been steamed, I advised they'd not!The main dish was sizeable but in essence it was a mix of some tender but mostly very tough beef with a rich dark curry sauce poured over it. The beef had not been cooked in the sauce which in itself was gritty from the curry powder. The dish was nothing at all like any Rendang I'd ever been served up.The indifference of the staff when I voiced my view, both at the table and when i settled the bill was shocking. I left the restaurant 25 bucks down and disappointed given the above but the worst after taste was the attitude of the staff.
2017-04-29,5,Great Malaysian food. Roti Canai is a must-try appetizer.The fried noodles with shrimp is great but the soft shell crab was the icing on the cake!
2017-04-13,5,Wow. Their seafood scrambled egg chow fun (something I NEVER typically order anywhere but did for some reason tonight and glad about it!) was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten! It was light like a brothy egg drop soup with seafood and greens over yummy flat rice noodles. I put some sambal and pickled hot peppers and the dish was nuanced and delicious. So happily surprised.
2017-04-07,5,I had Number 28, the soup was huge and delicious! The rest of our meal was very good as well. Great place!
2017-04-03,5,Best in town (especially if you have Asian stomach!)!肉骨茶 has real herbal medicine (that's supposed to be good for strengthening your immune system) and comes very generously with other ingredients. Smells amazing if you are into that type of herbal medicine scent. If my stomach had enough space I would chug another bowl! Coconut pudding is a must-have too! Very rich flavor.Can't wait to come back!
2017-03-18,5,Excellent chicken satay (though a bit pricey for 4 sticks). But the satay peanut sauce is really tasty and close to the original that you get from Singapore. The Malaysian thick black noodle is also of good standard if you have been to KL. The mee goreng is also really yummy but a different from those you get on the streets of Singapore or Malaysia. All in all, good food and highly recommended. Service is also prompt.
2017-03-16,1,Let me start by saying that I absolutely love Malaysian food, but I am not a tough critic. I know effort when I taste it and I work in customer service, so I absolutely understand what is (or is not in this case) proper etiquette. I ordered delivery: 2 pad thai's with curry soup, as well as a coconut water. The food tasted like it was right out of a box you can find in the freezer aisle, next to the generic brand microwavable dinners. Although the food arrived in a timely matter, the noodles were soggy and the soup was unbelievably salty. It felt like I unscrewed a salt shaker and poured its content straight into my mouth- Bam Margera style. The coconut drink was never delivered with the rest of my food. When I called the restaurant to inquire about what happened, the employee actually yelled at me, telling me that I did not ascertain that I wanted the beverage and that there was absolutely no way she could have missed my order. There was no empathy, nor was there any attempt at rectifying the situation when I was clearly charged for the item. I was bewildered... not because I was losing five dollars, but because she was adamant that I was wrong... when in this case, I wasn't. It's sad. At the least, I thought our people were supposed to stick together. If you are hungry for good authentic cuisine, take the drive to Green Papaya in Hackensack. I promise it's worth the trip to be treated like a decent human being. I was hoping to find some worthwhile Malaysian food closer to me, but I did not find it in Satay.
2017-03-12,4,A cozy resturant with cute Malaysian interior decor. Food was delicious and full of flavor. Food options ranges from soups, and noodles to curry dishes. Staff was friendly. Portions sizes are big and plenty to share. We also tried the fresh coconut water which came in a real coconut!!
2017-02-26,4,I tried malaysian food first time in 2015 and i became fan of this place. The place is on busy street of hoboken and one of the best asian restaurant. We are vegetarians so the waitress here helped us to order some good veg food. Roti canai was awesome. Service was pretty fast. Must visit if you want to try some new cuisine.
2017-02-20,5,Before I start... I suppose it is worth noting that as of this review, the restaurant provides a flat 5% discount if you pay cash.Located on the same block as the world famous Carlos Bakery on Washington Street, you'll find one of Hoboken's best Asian restaurants. I would have to say that the service is exceptionally quick and professional. All of the staff knows the menu inside and out, and they are very helpful with recommendations.I've been coming here periodically over the last year and a half. I would classify it as very tasty Asian cuisine in a casual atmosphere that is good for groups between 2-4 people. When the weather starts to get colder, we flock here for the soups! The Ayam Curry is always a favorite and is constantly ordered whenever I come here with friends.The Chicken Pad Thai is spicier than at other restaurants, making it that much more delicious for me. Another good dish is Nasi Nenas, which they tend to advertise frequently, as it comes inside a carved out pineapple!
2017-02-07,4,Good food, love the Claypot noodle seafood soup and the Roti Canai....Great resturant and service was fast, friendly atmosphere...
2017-02-04,3,Fulfilled my craving for Malaysian/ Singaporean food but nothing amazing. Guess Penang (the restaurant we frequent) is really bad since now I use it as a benchmark and found Satay above average.At least it's not as bad as Penang. Lol. Prawn mee - please use head on shrimp!!! Other than that, seafood chow fun was good and roti canai was delicious.
2017-01-02,5,The main reason I give this business 5 stars is because they are an honest business which cares for their customers. I would say delivery is not a strong point for them since I had to wait about 2 hours for the food and only got half my order. However, the owner took extra pains to get my order right and make sure I was taken care of.The food was great and you get good value for the price. I would recommend they get the delivery system right and then I would happily make this place a regular on my take out list.
2017-01-01,5,Excellent food, cozy atmosphere, low prices, perfect for lunch. 5 stars worthy. First time trying Malaysian food and it was a great experience. so don't be afraid to walk in. The Curry Soup was out of this world. Perfect balance of spices. Definitely try it. I also had the Roti Canai and the Bean Curd Skin Roll. Great starters before a meal, they were light and very tasty! For the entree, my friend and I shared the Ginger Rice and the Cantonese Noodles. Very flavorful and fresh. Needless to say, all their dishes were mouthwatering, you will not be disappointed. Try it!
2016-12-30,4,Had the chicken rice (haianese). It was good--it wasn't, like, Singapore good, but it was good, and hit the spot. Going back for more.
2016-12-19,5,Have been wanting to try for a while! So glad we decided to walk in today. It's my bday and I love to try new things on it! Roti Canai was probably the best I ever had! We got Curry Soft Shell Crab with ginger rice! This was delicious.. the ginger gave the rice just a little flavor! We also had the Cantonese noodles! Must say this was a perfect dish. Thin rice noodles with chicken, spring onions, shrimp and bean sprouts. A must try.
2016-12-07,4,I know this place for a long time and very consistent delicious food always.great restaurant and lunch menu is the best
2016-11-22,4,Stopped by for lunch on a Saturday and they have lunch specials on weekends too! Soup + entree for $7.50 is a good deal. We are moving to Hoboken soon, so we are very excited that there is a Malaysian place nearby!! I can say this place is as good as the other places in Chinatown. Ohh they take credit cards too!!!
2016-11-19,1,Poor service for delivery. The old woman on the phone is sooooooo rude and impatient.
2016-11-15,4,I've only ordered deliver from this place, but it's been great every time.The achat appetizer is amazing. It's cold and spicy and nutty and so flavorful.The squash tofu is one of my favorite veggies dishes. I could eat the whole bowl. I get it over white rice because I get it medium. Sauce is delicious.Mango noodle is fantastic. It's sweet and spicy. A must get.
2016-10-24,5,Coconut rice and Chili Ayam addict. Satay is easily in my Top 3 delivery options in Hoboken.Always quick and
2016-10-20,3,Disappointing ... I went for lunch the first time and ordered a mango chicken lunch special. Three, maybe four pieces of chicken with barely warmed and hardly ripe sliced mango with skin on, some orange sauce and mostly coconut rice was what I ended up with. Tasty enough sauce and rice so I gave 3 stars. The soup was a puzzlement - I was offered corn, curry or something else I can't recall and said corn. What I got was egg drop with a single kernel of corn. It was cheap and fast but I'll be hesitant to every try again.
2016-10-05,5,Wow! Before I had Satay, I had never gotten Malaysian before, but now I can say I love it! I feel  like you get a mix between Thai and Indian - freshness from veggies and fruits but also rich savory curries and meats. Things I have tried are the Roti Canai, the Satay beef and chicken, Ayam Kelapa, Itik Tenngganu (duck). ALL of them are delicious, but I would say the Ayam Kelapa and the Itik Tenngganu are my favorite. If you're a fan of duck, you HAVE to get the Itik. The duck is tender and perfectly cooked with a curry sauce that is to die for. Great place!
2016-09-29,3,I've had good experiences here before but this rating is for my experience today. I wanted to order takeout and had some questions about the lunch menu. I asked the woman at the checkout if any dishes had crispy chicken and she said no and then walked away. When she returned I asked what Hainanese chicken was and she just said steamed, I asked if it came with any vegetables and she said "it can." I also asked what the Hainanese rice was and she just said "rice" and when I pressed further she said there was ginger in it. I thought I'd try the Hainanese chicken and the tomyum lunch specials. When I got home the rice was plopped on top of the entree for both dishes and when i moved the rice around I realized that there was a very smalllll portion of tomyum and about 3/4 rice. The Hainanese chicken was just steamed chicken on the bone with skin and wing tips. There was barely any meat, mostly joints, and what meat there was had no flavor at all. My husband and I wound up splitting what little there was of the tom yum entree and then tried our corn egg soup which was thicker than I prefer. Very disappointed.
2016-09-25,4,This is a cozy low priced but tasty Malaysian place on the main strip (Washington Blvd) of Hoboken. The prices were quite reasonable and the food was pretty good. The food seems to have a lot of influence of Indian and Chinese food. Coconut drink (4.5) was really tasty and served in an actual coconut. You will probably end up ordering several of them because not all that much liquid. The puffed roti bread (4.5) was extremely tasty, and came with some very good Curry sauce with chunks of white meat. The only complaint was that it was a bit small. I would prefer bigger bread without the sauce. satay (3.5) - the beef was super tasty, but the chicken not so much. the peanut sauce was good. however, the portions were really small for 4 skewers. Also, instead of there being another sauce with sliced cumcumbers in sugar vinegar water, there were just huge chunks of cucumber and onion. Indonesian Fried Rice with Seafood (4) - tasty, although a lot of onion as the main ingredient after rice.
2016-09-20,4,As we were walking down Washington Street, we spotted a few restaurants, but Satay Malaysian Cuisine got our attention. I love Malaysian food, so this was a no-brainer. We got lucky and were able to get seated right away. In fact, we only saw few employees sitting back, taking their time off from serving and preparing vegetables for the dinner crowd. This restaurant isn't too fancy or upscale, but was clean inside. The menu looked enticing and prices were very reasonable. One of the items I absolutely have to order is the Roti Canai. It's a popular and authentic Malaysian pancake like dish served with curry. People have this as an appetizer, but for me it's like a main course. I could order three of these and just be satisfied with that. We also ordered other things like shrimp and vegetables and All I have to say is that the food was delicious and the service was satisfactory. We enjoyed every bit of it and kept nothing left over on the plate. If you're craving Malaysian food and are in the Hoboken area, I would definitely recommend coming here.
2016-09-20,2,the food here is decidedly mediocre.  I like Malaysian and every once in a blue moon give these guys another try. Every time it's meh.  Wide menu and decent prices. But the taste is not amazing and the quality of ingredients is not the freshest imo.
2016-09-08,5,This was an exceptional meal especially for delivery standards!The meal arrived neatly packed and all in order, whilst still representing the quality of freshness! We order the hainanese chicken and Ayam Kelapa. The Kelapa was one of the most  amazing dishes I have tasted before. This took me back straight to Malaysia and other countries. I was gobsmacked at how good this meal truly was! It blew my taste buds away!I would dine in or to go at this restaurant asap!
2016-08-31,4,I've eaten here twice now, once for takeout and once for dining in. I've really had a tough time finding good lunch spots in Hoboken, but I'm so glad Satay is here to stay. The food here is GOOD. The lunch specials are a great deal, and has tons of options. My coworkers and I have all enjoyed our meals, and we've had a variety of their rice, noodle, fish, and chicken dishes. They are consistent in quality and provide quick service both in deliveries and at the restaurant.I really liked the Singapore fried noodle with shrimp, and I also tried a little bit of the black noodle from my coworker which was pretty good too. Since they have such big variety of dishes, I'd be more than happy to come back again and again to try everything. THANK YOU Satay for existing, and feeding us yummy Asian food here in Hoboken. Can't wait to be back!
2016-08-27,4,I love this place. The food is wonderful and menu is huge. I would strongly suggest the roti canai to start witv and the mayam kelarp, both delicious. We've picked other random items from the menu and they've all been winners.
2016-08-10,4,This is quite an eclectic southern Asian restaurant in downtown Hoboken across from City Hall, when you're not in the mood for Thai/Viet/Chinese but would like something close to a cross between Indian and Malaysian dishes this is the spot, I really like the Roti Canai appetizer along with Ayam kalapa (crispy fried white chicken) or the Indian Mee Goreng, pretty authentic dishes and definitely try the seafood fried rice and they do offer brown/hainanese/coconut/white rice
2016-08-06,2,First of all, the lady who picks up the phone when I order delivery is just rude.  She's always rushing you to place your order.  The food portion seems to get smaller and smaller. Food is decent. But they started charging $2 delivery fee this year.  They have also increased their price this year too.
2016-07-31,4,Roti canai is delicious. Must try!I have been here multiple times, I like their roti canai, pineapple fried rice.
2016-07-11,2,To be honest, I was disappointed with their food and restaurant conditions. It was really hot when I came in with my family and they only had one or two fans turned on. Also, I think they really need to improve on the compatibility of the sauces with the dishes because the ones I had did not taste good. What's worse for me is that the water they gave out had no ice in it and therefore tasted lukewarm and completely like tap water. The also had a vegetable soup that had a few leaves and probably some msg and salt and that was it. Sorry but the water and soup just left me very disgusted. However their waiters did refill their customers' glasses and were decent at their job so I will give them two stars.
2016-06-20,5,This place is absolutely amazing!  I'm not sure why it is not rated higher on Yelp. My boyfriend and I came here to eat a late lunch and ordered two of their main chicken dishes as well as mango smoothies. They came out so fast and were SOO delicious!  So much flavor and cooked to perfection. I would highly recommend this for anyone that is in the downtown Hoboken area.
2016-06-19,5,I don't know why this place is ranked only three and a half stars here. I have been eating here for half a year. Everything is great. They have good food and good service. Try to order something Malaysian not American. Hint: Rou Gu Cha, Hayam Hainaness, Asam Laska, Prawn Mee, etc.
2016-06-12,3,Bak kut teh is good. Like that malaysian places have coconuts rice.
2016-06-08,4,This place is authentic. I'm a tough grader. This place would be 4.5/5 if it had teh.For the record: I've eaten at most of the Malaysian restaurants in New York and this place tops them. It has the heat and flavor. I'm also Malaysian and my family is the industry. Owners are from Ipoh. Taste is on point. Friend and I ordered Kang Kung, char teow kway, nasi lemak. I'll be here again.
2016-05-16,1,Do not teach customers how to tip!!!I saw lots of reviews on that.Tiping is based on service and your service was rude and awful. This waitress I saw had a discussion with another waiter on tip and he comes to me showing other bills on how much to tip. Like really??? You get tiped for good service and I have never had this bad experience in this country ever. And if tiping good is so important then charge flat rate in the bill.I would have happily paid.I felt I was being held at gunpoint to change the tip amount as he was pushing the pen in my hand with the receipt. Do it or else I will do it. Food: Highly Ok. Nothing that I have never had anywhere else. This is not authentic southeast asian food.
2016-04-28,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE! as a cantonese, i strongly recommend satay because it's authentic. Try their bak ku teh, the Singaporean pork and herb soup. you won't regret it.
2016-04-26,4,Pineapple fried rice is delicious! Beef chow fun is also a staple. Some dishes could use more heat and spice but those two are my go-to take out orders.
2016-03-30,4,While I've only ordered take out from here, I've always been very pleased with Satay. I always order the butternut squash curry, which is really cheap, delicious, huge, and arrives really, really fast. Great for vegetarians! I'll always order from Satay for something cheap and yummy!
2016-03-24,5,Nice touch on the Sesame Chicken with a peanut flavor to the usually orange based sauce. Delicious!
2016-03-19,5,Their food is delicious! They deliver to us in Jersey City and they're always quick. We usually order vegetarian general tsao's chicken which is awesome. Their Pad Thai is great too. Prices are good. Love this place!!
2016-03-11,2,Sizzling tofu was not sizzling at all. Forget about sizzling, tofu it was cold, though the vegetables it came with were hot. They also messed up another dish on our table. Don't remember the name of the dish exactly, but it was Mango tofu and the server came and told us that the chef started making pad thai instead. We were fine with it, so did not change the order. Pad thai was good though.
2016-03-05,2,I am a big fan of the food and the two stars are because they already have higher prices than most other similar cuisines and in addition to that now they have downsized their portions and implemented a delivery charge of $2 within Hoboken. This just shows a deterioration of serving customers. I understand if they charge for deliveries outside Hoboken but when they charge for very local deliveries to now they are showing they do not appreciate their local customers.
2016-03-04,4,We have been here a couple of times and the food is really good. I would suggest not ordering a delivery since the quantity of the food differs a bit. Our favorites are number 24 (Ayam Rendang), 98 (vegetable red curry) and Roti Canai.. They also serve fresh tender coconut which is pretty refreshing.
2016-02-24,4,Stumbled in out of the rain to be the only one seated for dinner (it appears that they do a lot of delivery and pickup). I wasn't sure what to expect but I am very happy with both the food and the service! I haven't had Malaysian food since I left Philadelphia and I was pleasant reminded of the Indian and Chinese influences in the food. Excellent choice!
2016-02-21,5,Great food, great service, authentic flavors. Love this place. I recommend eating there -- tastes best right out of the oven!Some of my favorites:- pineapple fried rice- roti canai- chicken satay- mango smoothie- coconut pudding
2016-02-07,4,Nice place, great waiters. Loved the Ayam Kelspa and the Nasi nanas Stay away from the mango chicken noodles! Terrible
2016-02-06,4,Great Malaysian spot - affordable prices and authentic and flavorful food. They have great lunch specials and also deliver. My boyfriend and I recently came for dinner and can't wait to come back. As an appetizer we ordered Roti Canai, which was amazing. For entrees we ordered the Singapore Noodles and Ayam Rendang. Both were delicious!  We definitely left full and looking forward to our next visit.
2016-02-05,5,The food and service was excellent. The green tea had a lovely aromatic jasmine flavor.  The shrimp dumplings were tasty and the noodles were even better.  The #38 was the perfect comfort dish on a cold day!
2016-01-31,5,We have both eaten in and taken out tasty dishes from Satay Malaysian. The food is fresh, interesting and really well done! My husband worked in KL at one point, so we are somewhat picky when it comes to good Malaysian food. The dishes we ordered to go were fantastic - lovely noodles, light, flavorful sauces and plump dumplings. The delivery person was prompt and friendly as well. We have also eaten in during their weekday lunch special. It's delicious and great value: two teas, two soups and two mains plus a starter set us back $27, frankly unheard of in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Everything we ordered, we loved! We will be back.
2016-01-29,5,I have to give it 5 stars because I am never disappointed. The staff is usually friendly but even if they weren't I would still come back. It's just that good. Appetisers: Roti Kanai, Satay tofuEntrees: Ayam curry me( noodle soup), #54 ( green curry, ginger rice)
2016-01-27,5,Good food and taste tranditional!
2016-01-25,5,Ordered online and delivered within 45 minutes. I got the coconut curry with scallion pancake and brown rice and my husband got chicken sweet and sour. Both were extremely tasty! I loved it! It was fresh, delicious and exactly what it was advertised as. I asked for mine to be without certain veg. and it was done correctly. It was 32 dollar without tip included so I suppose it may be little expensive but it is worth it. I have had too many horrible meals and paid a fortune for it I would pay this over and over when I know the food is good! I would recommend and can't wait to eat here again! And it's so close to our house!
2016-01-21,5,Can't go wrong with any entrees. Portions are good enough for two to share.  Food comes out quick and please don't forget to try the roti canai. You won't regret it. Also it is byob, another plus!
2016-01-18,4,This place is a great lunch spot. The staff are very friendly and you can see them picking at fresh basil leaves and cooking up a storm in their huge kitchen. It's certainly and nice setting. What to get: - chicken curry lunch special: this flavorful meal was filling and delicious AND it was only $6.95 (comes with a soup too!)- try the ginger rice! It was killer !What not to get:- fried soft shell crab with shredded coconut : First, the crab didn't taste fresh. Second, and perhaps more importantly, EVERY item on the dish was fried. Their was zero variety in texture and the dish felt heavy. It was also $17.95. Way too much given the lunch specials are more delicious and a third of the cost.
2016-01-18,2,So, some would consider me a Malaysian Cuisine aficionado since I eat it every time I can.  That said, we were was disappointed in the food. The "Curry Grouper" should have come out as a whole fish which had been slowly simmered in fish curry sauce until the meat falls from the bones...instead it was a frozen and deep fried lump of flesh smothered in cheap curry like you would find at the Airport.  Actually though that is disrespectful to the airport, so we'll say it came from the dirty alley behind this despicable place instead. The other entree was Lamb Rendang...which was decent, but you really can't screw this dish up with all the ready made sauces out there, and that was exactly what it tasted like. Sauce imported in a small foil bag and mixed with coconut milk.I cancelled our dessert since we were so disappointed with the entrees and got out as fast as we could. On a side note, they take off 5% for cash. We wish they took off 50% for bad food as this place is way overpriced for what you get.
2016-01-03,1,Ordered online through Yelp and received a message that my order was processed and will be delivered in 30-45 minutes. Order took an hour and a half to finally arrive, and of course was cold whEn it finally arrived. General tso's chicken was gross, I'm not even sure it was chicken and I even paid extra for "healthy all white meat chicken". Also asked for broccoli to be added and no broccoli was added of course. Won't be ordering from here again!
2015-12-26,5,This is a great place for my Malaysian food fix !  The cooking is excellent and so is the service !!!  Cannot wait for a return trip !!!
2015-12-26,5,Satay is a must for those with adventurous palates. While everything I've tried on the Malaysian menu has been excellent, the Ayam Trengganu (Hot) is one of the best dishes I've ever had. The golden sauce - an incredible and complex mix of sweet, savory, & spice - is alone worth the cost of the meal. Encased in this liquid gold (I save the leftover sauce to season my boring grilled chicken) is a healthy portion of eggplant, basil, tomato, chicken, and other veggies. Your rice options include coconut which goes perfectly with the dish.Note - Many of the Malaysian dishes are spicy, so if you are the type who shies from Indian or Thai in favor of bland, over salted, and greasy fare, stick with your local Chinese restaurant.ServiceDelivery in Hoboken is fast and the restaurant's servers are polite and attentive.
2015-12-24,4,Their curry soup is very good as is their eggplant with bean sauce. Good ambience. Very friendly people. I am going there again!
2015-12-18,4,Modest service but incredible food. You can't beat their lunch specials. (Especially for Hoboken prices) I totally recommend the Pad Thai.
2015-12-12,4,Best Malaysian food I've ever had, also the only Malaysian food I have had.  If you're in the same boat, then try thinking of Indian and Thai food fusion.  The food is excellent here, and it's reason enough to go, but the service and ambiance are a little lacking.  Try the specials when you can.  I had the duck special, and it was amazing.  Service needs a little more smile and warmth, but it's attentive.  The ambiance reminded me of the movie Full Metal Jacket when they were were Hanoi.  It's very 1980s and could use a face-lift to cater to the Hoboken crowd.  I would recommend you try it here at least once for the food. You won't be disappointed.
2015-12-08,3,We ordered through Seamless and had the roti canai, chicken satay skewers, Hainanese chicken, and Indian mee goreng. The roti canai was already cold but I can imagine it tasting a lot better had we dined in. The chicken skewers were good and not dry. It came with this peanut dipping sauce but it was too peanutty for me. The Hainanese chicken was alright. I wish they put the soy sauce on the side and didn't drown all the chicken in it. The rice is came with was very basic. It didn't tasted like how Hainanese chicken rice should - it tasted plain. The mee goreng was probably the best out of the bunch. Even though it was takeout, the noodles weren't soggy or anything. It was a little weird that it came with potatoes (or maybe the dish is supposed to have potatoes and I've been eating it wrong my whole life) but I would definitely order this again. It doesn't seem like there are many Malaysian options in the area, so Satay is probably your best bet. Of course, it's nowhere near as good (taste and price wise) as the numerous Chinatown options, but I wasn't expecting it to be.
2015-12-04,4,Good food comes out fast I've only tried the noodle dishes but it's cheap and easy! The beef chow fun, mango chicken noodle and pad Thai are delicious
2015-11-23,2,Extremely mean and rude management. Good food but never coming back. Lack decency and manners.
2015-11-21,1,Ordered one thing, got something totally different. Called to get the correct order but they refused and wouldn't take fault for anything, never ordering there again
2015-11-14,5,Hands down the best Malaysian food I've had in NJ and NY. I moved to Hoboken recently and am kicking myself for not trying this sooner. Way better value than any other Asian restaurant I've tried so far in NJ. I think they need to improve the storefront and advertising to make the place more comfortable and attractive for passersby - I think so many people walk by without trying it!
2015-10-04,4,One of my favorite place in Hoboken. I have been here for lunch and dinner. The ambiance is quite good. The patio furnitures are not that great but still manageable.The food is really good. I usually ask the food to be spicy and they do quite a good job in that. Some of my favorite are Roti Canai, Chilli Ayyam (Chilli Chicken) and Chicken rendang. Everything is just awesome. I also love their lichee drink. They have lichee in the drink and is just awesome. Its a BYOB place, so if you add bit of vodka in their lichee drink then it becomes a great cocktail :)The service is good. Out of my 3 visits, only once i faced issue with wait and late servings.Overall certainly recommend this place.
2015-10-02,1,Careful for take outs, the woman at the counter is a real biaaaaatch.One time I ordered take out inside and she didn't even care to notify me when food was ready - I have to check for it myself. Instead, she gave me a humiliating gesture to send me away after I grab my pack, seems quite hostile.
2015-10-02,5,This place is a real gem in Hoboken.  The Malasian menu is where it's at.  The Ayam curry mee is so good.  The Roti Cani is great.  I like a lot of the chicken dishes too.
2015-09-25,5,This place is my delivery spot. Hands down! And they deliver to the jersey city heights! They are quick and the food is always yummy!
2015-09-13,4,Sooooo good. I ordered the fresh coconut drink (so refreshing) and the Ayam curry mee (egg noodles w/ curry chicken potatoes and bean sprouts in coconut curry broth). I'm licking my lips right now thinking about it.  I also think I overheard them say you get a 5% discount if you pay with cash. Too bad it was after I gave my card :( Good customer service too.
2015-09-05,3,Roti canai was good but not as good as some other Malaysian restaurant,overall average food and ambience.Don't forget to order mango noodles as that is something to look forward to at this place
2015-08-28,2,I went to this place for the first time on a Friday night with 4 other friends. My biggest issue was with the service. It took a long time for them to get us a table, as a matter of fact my friend had to suggest the table that they sat us at because they did not seem to be able to comprehend how to sit out group outside. Then when we finally were seated it took a long time for the staff to open uncork the wine we brought with us, which further frustrated me. In terms of the food we ordered a number of apps that I don't remember being notable. For my main entree I ordered soft shell crab, which wasn't bad and at least they give you a sizable portion. That was really the only highlight for this place. Food I'd rate as a 3 star, but service is go somewhere between a 1 and 2 star.
2015-08-23,1,Maybe there are some things on the menu that are malaysian but the majority of what I saw was a fusion of bad chinese and thai. Lacking flavor, bland food. lunch prices are good. curry soup was pretty good, but not enough to salvage the meal for me
2015-08-19,4,We orderedCurry vegetable soup Stuffed rotiJust an all around excellent meal with friendly service. I would go back anytime.
2015-08-19,1,Pass by this place every day as it's across the street from work.  Walked in for the first time today to get chicken satay to go.  I asked if they just had chicken satay and after some confusion the hostess directed me to the satay house special.  After a few minutes I heard her describe the dish to several other people as containing chicken, pork, and shrimp.  I don't eat pork or shrimp.  So after asking what meats were in it, they basically said sorry and put a bag on the counter.Fine.  That's my mistake I guess - although I think most restaurants would probably offer to exchange the food.  So I asked if I could give it to anyone in the restaurant.  The hostess told me - who would want it?  I should point out that I opted not to convey her prior sense of condescension since it may have just been genuine, partially-linguistic misunderstanding.  I won't go back, but for all I know the food is fine.  You'd have to ask the homeless shelter I gave the satay to.
2015-08-15,4,Good food however they will charge you for refill each time even though served in very small glass.
2015-08-10,2,Ordered take out. Asked the person who answered for a suggestion but she refused. Bought the food home and it was all so bland. The dry chilly chicken was a joke. The Malaysian flat noodles were drowning in soy sauce. Wouldn't recommend.
2015-08-09,5,Always great service and great food. Pad Thai is delicious. Presentation of food at restaurant and to-go orders is consistent in quality
2015-08-09,5,Excellent roti canai. Great liquor store nearby for byob.  Black pepper pork chops were very good with hainanese (ginger) rice. My new Malaysian.
2015-08-06,5,This is our third visit to Satay. Everytime they have been better than before.. Amazingly Delicious food.. I just love this place.. Must Visit Restaurant ...
2015-07-28,3,Food was great... Tried the Roti Canai which is yummy ... The seafood scramble egg chow fun is great ... The chow kueh teow is just ok
2015-07-27,5,Ahhh. That Malaysian place in Hoboken on Washington St. The food, service, ambiance, options everything were great. The appetizers were really appetizing. I mean that. We had Roti Telur with no meat gravy. The gravy could have been better but the telur was phenomenal. Same applies to the Roti Canai. You really should try it before leaving that place. Chicken Satay - best paired with your drinks, preferably beer. The curries they had, the coconut milk ones would go very well with Sea Food options in my opinion. I had only the Veg Curry but that was quite nice. You can chose from White/Brown/Coconut/Ginger rice. The coconut rice is very nice and finally some new rice to taste for me. Try that and you will not regret that. I can rant nice things for hours but don't forget to take your booze. YES THIS PLACE IS BYOB. Next time I am going, I am taking friends with me, ordering Satay, and letting that booze go through. Yee Hahaha
2015-07-17,1,This review is purely for the 1hr and 10min wait time for the food delivery.  I have NEVER written a review before, but when you tell your customer that the food will be delivered in 30mins...it should not be 1hr and 10min.  I could have walked over and pick up the food and return with half an hour to spare in that time frame.
2015-07-17,4,I ordered delivery from here on a Friday. Delivery took only 30 min! I got the general tso chicken. It's very good tender white meat chicken. The sauce is tasty! I will definately order from here again!
2015-07-11,5,Great ambiance, authentic cuisine, friendly servers. My first Malaysian food experience and was a pleasant one. I definitely will return to try other dishes/drinks on the menu!! As my first Malaysian dish, i ordered #72 Lamb spice with red/green peppers, on coconut white rice- delish! And had a taste of Passion fruit green tea-- lovely!My husband had chicken with brown sauce with more veggies / white rice. It was good too! Definitely I recommend this place.
2015-07-05,4,I would have given a 5 star if the staff was friendlier.Yummy food- loved the mango noodles, green curry, roti canai. Coconut rice and ginger rice both are a must try.
2015-06-23,5,Pad Thai & Vegetarian Curry Mee. Great, authentic dishes: well seasoned and excellent ingredients. At at the restaurant which has a nice, casual feel and good service. Highly recommend: this is my new fave. restaurant in Hoboken.
2015-06-21,3,Good food and great service. Definitely worth a repeat. The food presentation is worth noting as my chicken and pineapple dish came served in a carved out pineapple. So cute!
2015-06-11,3,Its a nice small place to have some good malaysian food. Decent prices and they also have a lunch special 11-4. Must try their leechy tea.. pretty nice! Also you get discount if you pay in cash so take some cash with you. Average service.. again its just a small eating joint so its ok. Must go once.
2015-06-08,4,Great spot for lunch! A huge menu that is so cheap! That is right up my alley. the place is small and dark, but fun to look at. Great choices and foods comes out quick. The portions are a great size...however my coconut rice didnt have any flavor. The grouper was amazing! the curry soup is good, i love the tofu in it--i ended up pouring this onto my rice..and boy was i happy about that!
2015-06-03,4,We got delivery the other night - it was here in less than 45 minutes on a Sunday night which I thought was impressive. Roti Cani was my favorite dish - the naan crepes were so warm and perfect. The Kajang Satay chicken skewers with peanut sauce was amazing! The chicken pieces were a little small but the sauce was ON. POINT.I ordered the Karl Ayam (chicken, potatoes, and curry, coconut milk) AMAZING. I saved the leftover for the next day's lunch. It was plenty of food, although we did order the appetizers too.
2015-05-23,3,Been here a couple of times. I personally havent been too impressed. I order only vegetarian so have limited options. Have tried their Pad Thai, Mango Salad, Kanai, curries. Its not too spicy so I am not such a huge fan. They do offer 5% off if you pay cash so take advantage of that offer. I might not visit here again unless someone really forces me to.
2015-05-05,3,Good solid Malaysian - the fried shrimp dumpling is an excellent appetizer, crunchy with this killer sauce. Udang Kelapa (the best): Butter fried jumbo shrimp in aromatic coconut batter is a real treat, you gotta get this one. Beef Halia - Stir-fried sliced beef with ginger and scallion in brown sauce is a good meat choice. They have bubble tea and BYO!
2015-04-24,1,Ordered for delivery on a clear Sunday night and after waiting for more than 90 minutes and calling multiple times I am told the delivery guy is gonna be reaching soon which the guy does in next 20 mins. Verdict - Not ordering again. Quality has tanked like a falling rocket.
2015-04-24,3,Staff are abrasive but food is decent, quickly served, and generous with portions. Very reasonably priced, and they also give discount if you pay with cash.
2015-04-09,4,Roti canoi is always delicious with the gravy they serve! Love it .Roti paratha is also good, the worst part is even if you buy in bulk still they dont give in special prices.They should create some kind of party menu.
2015-04-09,5,I've yet to find a better curry in the area. The lunch special is amazing and the portions are big for the price (they even give a discount for using cash). Dinner portions are even bigger. They have a variety of very authentic and tasty desserts as well. As for the restaurant itself, the interior is so cute!
2015-04-08,5,This review is based on DELIVERY ONLY; and only 1 meal.OMG. THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.There are only 2 things I ever order from here:Roti CanaiAyam Kelapa with coconut riceI CAN'T GET OVER HOW DELICIOUS THIS MEAL IS.The last time I ordered though, I have to admit the coconut rice with the Ayam Kelapa was overkill...so next time I will have to order the regular rice. Last time I ordered we did get the Lamb Rendang and it was really tasty too. I've ordered from here more than 5 times and they were consistently good. I did try ordering other things from the menu, but wasn't as good as the ayam kelapa. Some of the other appetizers are really good too. I live really far from them (I'm in JSQ) and they are in Hoboken, so I give them many props for coming all the way over here...it might be that they can see that I've ordered from them so many times :) and I will continue to do so...! I'm not sure if I'll ever head over there to sit in because it's almost like tradition now to order Malaysian and have a movie night.
2015-03-20,4,Small place but good food..Roti Canai and curry grooper (ask them to spice up if you like spicy food)a must try..peanut chutney with satay chicken ..yumm..fried icecream not that good..they serve some cocunut pudding in cocunut ..it's ok
2015-03-17,2,I give it a 3 star for the nice ambience, great food...but NO STAR for the service. I don't really quite like the owner cos he sucks and he is rude. I came here a few times with my husband...and don't feel welcome at all. Oh well.
2015-02-22,1,Start by saying, I love Malaysian food.  I have eaten in a lot of Malaysian restaurants in my life and even lived in South East Asia in my early twenties.  I also have a severe peanut allergy.  I'd say I'm 100% aware of my peanut allergy seeing that I could die of anaphylactic shock if I eat a single fresh peanut.  That said, I could have been killed at Satay a few weekends ago.Here's the situation... super cold evening, my husband and I come in and sit.  When we order appetizer of Roti Canai, I said to the waiter, "It doesn't have peanuts right?  I cannot eat peanuts. I am allergic."  He responds, "No, no peanuts."  Disaster averted for appetizer course...Then when it comes to order entree, we order soft shell crabs and mee goreng noodles (which on the menu does NOT say peanuts is an ingredient) to share family style.  I presume that since we just had a conversation about peanuts 4 minutes prior while ordering appetizer, I wouldn't have to have the same conversation again when ordering entrees.  When the dishes arrive, I see that the noodles are completely covered in crushed peanuts.  I reiterate to him that I cannot eat peanuts due to severe peanut allergy so can you please give us another order without peanuts?  The waiter responds "You didn't specify no peanuts with this dish so just eat around the peanuts."  EAT AROUND THE PEANUTS?  Does he realize he basically is telling me to have a severe allergic reaction in his restaurant and possibly die?  I couldn't believe my ears since every single restaurant I've had this occur at throughout the world has always been very quick to give me a completely new dish without peanuts.  He started arguing with me that even though I told him I was allergic to peanuts during the Roti Canai ordering, that wasn't specified for the entree and therefore I should just eat around it.  Again.  Even after I told him I'd possibly die from eating a single trace of peanut.  The guy basically told me I should risk death in his restaurant.  Ummm, no thanks.I was ready to walk out of the restaurant but my husband, ever the pacifist, just told me he would eat the noodles and I'd eat the entire soft shell crab order.  I was unhappy but complied because it was late and it was freezing outside.Needless to say, I will not be back to a restaurant that does not understand food allergy or respect the customer enough to honor their health concerns.  I'd seriously suggest anyone with a nut allergy to stay away from this restaurant.
2015-02-17,5,My relatives took me here for lunch one day and I must say that I don't understand why the reviews aren't a bit better. Yes the staff wasn't very personable, but whenever we asked them questions, they were very eager to talk and tell us what we needed to know. I had the Sesame Ribs, and it was by far one of the best things I've ever eaten. My sister had the sesame chicken, and it was just as good. To add on, the lunch prices were very inexpensive. Whenever I go back to Jersey, I'll definitely stop by again.
2015-01-31,4,A few years ago, I tried out the menu. The orange chicken was pretty good. There was a seitan "veggie chicken nugget" thing in brown sauce with mixed vegetables that was awesome, and then it disappeared or was moved from the lunch specials to one of the other two menus (there are too many menus at Satay). So I started getting the tofu and veggie pad Thai. It's unique among the pad Thais I've had. The tofu is crunchy on the outside, deep fried, and the overall dish is a dark chestnut color from the rich tamarind base, which combines sweetness with a kind of nuttiness. Bean sprouts, peanuts, and crunchy fried onions decorate the top. The sauce can be modified for spiciness and any ingredient can be added or removed at your request: eggs, bean sprouts, basil, etc. I always ask for a side of sambal. Their prices are generous as well. The lunch portion costs about $7.50 and includes a cup of soup, but the portions are large enough for the dinner menu. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. Satay is my go-to lunch spot in Hoboken. Their hidden gem is the currie soup. Not the entree portion, which is loaded with potatoes and overly complex; the simple tofu, cabbage, onion soup that's served with lunch, just before the main course. I have a friend who's tried to buy pints of it to go. I get the sense that Satay sees their stripped down currie soup as an economy version or filler. It's really the star.
2015-01-31,5,It's the most exquisite food I ate in my trip to NY! The food was excellent! It's a explosion of flavors! Absolutely i come back with my eyes closed!
2015-01-22,5,Two words: Roti Canai! OMG! Simply the best. I will miss this place if I move. Dipping curry sauce with sweet thin crepes are addictive. Try the mango chicken also. I didn't love the fried spareribs. I believe it's knowing what to order here that gives it the five stars from me. Get the roti canai and the coconut rice. Can't go wrong.
2015-01-20,4,The lunch specials are awesome here! It includes a soup and entree. I got the curry soft shell crab and it was delicious. The staff refilled our water glasses without us having to ask. They also didn't rush us out even though it got busier. Nice alternative to typical weekend brunch.
2015-01-20,3,Tiny hole in the wall in Hoboken. Not much ambiance.  Lunch special was a great deal, very inexpensive, and you can tell with the quality of the food. The wait staff is not really personable.  Possible language barrier. Basil rice was bit too greasy. I tried the roti pancake with some curry. Pancake was bland, needed more flavor.I would give it a chance some time in the future. Hopefully I have a better experience.
2015-01-13,5,I have ate here a couple of time and the food here is amazing! My sister and her partner are the ones who introduced me to this place. Her partner is from Singapore and she says this place is a 10! And I completely agree. I even had there take out and it was still wonderful!
2015-01-05,4,My first time here and based on the reviews was really wanting to give this place a shot. Seating is tight as its a quaint little place (typical of a NYC restaurant). We ordered a Lamb dish and one of their iterations of Soft Shell Crab. The Lamb was clearly the star of the show! Well cooked, good portions and great sauce. Well worth the price. The Soft Shell crab on the other hand, not so much. There was wayy more dressings/shavings of accompaniments on the plate and far less crab itself. Still, would come back here another time to check out their chicken and beef dishes!
2014-12-29,4,Had Tom yam soup with shrimp, roti canai for appetizer, Malaysia milk tea, duck with plum sauce and chicken in yellow curry with coconut milk. Overall good experience. Roti canai is good just as I expected. Tom yam soup is a bit sour, need to add a little spicy flavor to find balance and taste better. Malaysia milk tea is like original milk tea. Duck with plum sauce is my favorite dish, crispy skin with juicy meat and a little fat, mix them with plum sauce, many layers of flavor in your mouth. Yellow curry with coconut milk is decent.
2014-12-13,2,Unfortunately, the employees are rude each and every time :-( I am a big stickler on just plain ol being nice to customers..However, some of the food is pretty good! Roti canai appetizer is a thin Indian pancake (think like a wrap) with a dipping curry that has chicken and potato.  It is wonderful!  The mochi ice cream is delicious in strawberry and mango and travels well, they place it in a separate bag for delivery so it stays cold.  4 mochi in one order- great value.On the other hand, I've ordered several dishes and was underwhelmed each and every time. The Ayam Pandan chicken was dry with little flavor. The dipping sauce came on the side it was orange with a chili flake in it, but too sweet for the dry fried chicken. Also, I tried the Ayam Kelapa and it was drenched in sauce that had an unpleasant consistency.  You can get your white rice in a flavor instead of plain: choice of ginger white rice was also underwhelming. I want to dig this place so badly!  But if it wasn't for the roti canai and mochi flavors, I wouldn't ever return :-(
2014-12-10,4,I tried the curry entree with soup. Satisfied the indian food palate. Close to work too which is an added bonus ! The pad thai was a little disappointing though.
2014-11-29,4,This is the second time I've been here and not disappointed at all!!Their curries are lovely. The texture, spice is just perfect! i yet again had the Kayur Sur Campur which I believe is the best vegetarian curries in here. My friend ordered the Kayur Masak which was riddled with chillies just coz we asked for a mildly spicy version..so a fair warning guys!!For appetizers, we ordered the Kanai Roti which was a nice experience! Just plain roti with some sumptuous curry. The chicken Kanai Roti has just a piece of chicken and potato each, so be cautious when you share.The Aiyam Terrangganu was good to taste too. It is basically a medium spiced chicken curry served with rice. The only drawback about this is a lot of chicken piece which we got tired having. But the taste nonetheless was great.Overall, I find this place convenient, close to the PATH station and cosy with prompt service. Not much wait for the food, which tastes lovely and not very expensive!
2014-11-20,5,This review is based solely on the food - which was excellent. I would go so far as to say this was the best meal my husband or I have had in Hoboken, especially for the value. We ordered the mango salad - Delicious, especially paired with the Roti Canai (Indian Pancake) which was AMAZINGFor entree's we got the Ayam Basil which was very good and something called "Siam Chicken" on the specials page which was also delightful.Did I mention BYOB (with no corkage fee). No brainer. We will definitely be back.
2014-11-17,3,Food was fine. We ordered the roti canai, One of the vegetarian noodle soups and Udang Cheng-Mal i.e. shrimp with lemon grass pepper in a curry sauce. Service is friendly and quick. Decent value for money but not exceptional.
2014-11-05,3,Food fine but nothing special. Few Thai options in the Hoboken neighborhood make this one of the most viable options.
2014-10-31,5,This is by far one of the best food in Hoboken offering delicious and reasonably priced Chinese Malaysian Food.
2014-10-15,5,I love it! I notice the staff can be a bit short if they don't recognize you or if you're not a regular. The food is GREAT! Always start with the roti canai it is yummy.It's byob which is convenient. A bit small but intimate. Around peak hours (if you're a regular in hoboken you know what those hours are) it can be a bit crowded and cramped and you will be bumped a time or two. The food is worth it so have a little patience!
2014-10-07,5,I am here once a week because their food is authentic and well priced. I usually order the roti canai appetizer (curry chicken broth with the flakiest roti one could imagine), Haininese chicken (gently poached chicken on the bone with soy dipping sauce) and string beans in shrimp paste. This last dish is for adventurous eaters. It is a simple dish of string beans sautéed in a Southeast Asian condiment that has a strong shrimp flavor.  Loves it. When I feel like indulging I get the curried pork spare ribs. They fall off the bone and are coated in a flavorful curry paste/sauce.Servers are very friendly (hey Brandon!) and the place is always clean.
2014-10-05,4,*******Now on Mondays and Tuesdays- customers get 10% off their total check (for dine-in only), if paid in cash (for Lunch and Dinner)********Always been a fan of Satay! The owner knows me by name and whenever I call to order take-out she recognizes my voice and knows what I want. Good: Both for Dine-in and take-out.  Today for lunch husband and I saw the sign for 5% off and paid in cash. Now on to food.  "Rendang" is one of the signature curries in Malaysian Cuisine and this place serves pretty good Rendang-based dishes. Husband ALWAYS gets the chicken rendang. I know it must get boring for a lot of people getting the same thing, but my husband somehow never gets tired and orders the same thing. He has been in JC for almost 9 years and has tried a few things from here, but always goes back to getting Chicken Rendang. Service is always prompt and efficient.For me I have tried several dishes here. My favs include:- The Green Curry chicken (Chicken Hijau sans eggplant)- Lamb in Lemongrass ("Cheng-Mai" sauce)- Curry Mixed Vegetables (in "Rendang" Sauce. this sauce has MSG)- Curry Soup (Vegetarian)- Soft Shell Crab dishes (Both in Rendang and Cheng-Mai Sauce)- Roti Canai (Appetizer)- Ginger Rice (among the other rice options served with the main entrees)Other dishes that have underwhelmed me:- Chilli Chicken (has lots of MSG in it, i believe) - Basil Chicken or Tofu- Lychee based drinks (I know the Lychees are from a can, hence my dislike)I have got delivery from this place a few times and have had no issues. Bad: I haven't had a bad experience at Satay so far. The restrooms are ok. The place is a tad small for large groups, but I have seen groups of at least 6-8 together, so I think it is doable to have more than 5 people seated together.Ugly: None. Tidbit: I was speaking to the owner one day and asked her what her favorite thing from the menu was and she said she never eats things from the menu. She said she eats mostly steamed food :-P
2014-10-05,5,This service is so fast here, and foods amazing. It's my first time having Malaysian food and I brought a friend there too we have to go back. The lunch menu is so much food and only 6.99 mmmmmmhhhhh
2014-09-24,4,I was on my way to Carlo's Bakery and saw this place right next door. I was a little hungry and saw they had $7 lunch specials - I was sold! I had the Malaysian noodles with curry soup. Fantastic. A little bit on the salty side but otherwise it was very tasty. Then I made my way to Carlo's...
2014-09-10,4,This was one of my favorite haunts in Hoboken for lunch. Roti Canai, Tom Yum Soup, Chilli Chicken, Yellow Curry are very good. The food quality and taste has been consistent. My only grouse is that the staff keeps hovering over you as if in a hurry to clear the table.
2014-08-29,4,As you walk in, the aromas from the kitchen tske you over. Order Roti and whatever else your heart desires...all very good in a vibrant little restaurant.
2014-08-27,5,I am a regular in this place, brought many friends to taste what Malaysian/Asian food I like. I used to live in Asia (Singapore) for 6years that's where I developed passion for Asian meals. I like there lunch sets - cheap and filling. My all time favorite desert is mango sticky rice, bubble teas. Btw, this place has efficient take out n if u choose to step in - service is quick!
2014-08-21,3,this would be a higher rating if i was living in hoboken and desperately craving malaysian. we tried the bonesless duck with plum sauce (wasn't quite boneless..), and lacked flavor but it was meaty. the plum sauce was gross. they gave us a bowl of it and just didn't look appetizing. also tried the seafood egg chow fun- a very popular dish in malaysian cuisine. I figured that they wouldn't have much flavoring going on so i asked specifically to add garlic and they did which made the dish 10x better than had it been without the garlic. we also tried the roti canai which was a good spice level but was very watery in comparison to most others i've had. the dish itself was nice but of course a bit pricey. we were disappointed that they had hainese chicken on their lunch menu but did not have it on the dinner menu. we were also quite disturbed at one point when a flying cockroach made its way around the tables but the workers quickly spotted it and killed that. but still it was the size of a pinky/ring finger!!
2014-08-18,3,If u dont like food with too much sauce try noodles or the curries.... The peanut pancake was good though...
2014-08-17,4,Great lunch specials, good food, great service. Very reasonably priced menu.  We had lunch specials. I had the Trengganu chicken with curry soup and coconut rice. All very good but the soup was absolutely fabulous. Food was flavorful and just the right amount of spicy. Also had a green tea passionfruit bubble tea. It was good although a bit sweet. Husband had pepper steak with onions and veggies, curry soup, and white rice. His was flavorful and prepared well also. Would definitely return.
2014-08-16,4,Food -   Beef redang isba must try. The curry is rich n is well ground paste. Reminded me of kori gassi from Mangalore. Goes best with brown rice.  Mango salad was a good n light appetizer.  Veg dumplings is good.   Veg pad thai had the right amount of sweetness.  The coconut based veg curry had the right thickness.  The coconut water didnt taste fresh.   Ordered mochi for desert. Its really sticky fried dough with ice cream stuffing. Service - Our server was extremely helpful and patient. With a lot of good suggestions he ensured we ordered as per our individual tastes.Ambience - There could be a fair amount of wait. The outside seating should be improved. Cost - ~$20 per pax on sharing basis.
2014-07-17,3,I have been to this place twice.Experience 1: Really loved it. The hostess was cherrful and helped us with ordering vegeterian dishes. The vegetable soup they serve has flavours similar to Indian curries. So, loved it. The pad thai that we ordered was very bland so we asked them to redo it and it was awesome too. Experience 2: Ordered bubble tea with the bubbles. The bubbles seemed really old. They were all stuck with each other and could not be pulled by the straw too. Really not expected when you pay twice as much for a drink. Also ordered their mango noodles. They tasted pathetic. Requested the server to get something done about it. And his response was: This is how it is meant to taste. You ordered it, you have to eat it. Sucks man. Seriously, then you expect me to tip you. Really Meh.
2014-07-16,3,portion is small... so be prepared to pay more... service was ok.. but the dishes are so so only... would not give it 4 stars.. as the chendol we ordered.. did not taste like chendol at all... moslty coconut in ice...
2014-07-09,1,Been a regular with them for many years. Placed a large order and they couldn't handle it. Roti Canai's that were to be made mild were made hot and the hot were made mild. Spoke with the manager and he was defensive from the word go... I wasn't born yesterday and have been having their Canai's for very many years to know the taste. Bottom line if you have a large order with them, they can't handle it. Curriers are diluted with water and sent and then to cover up have all sorts of arguments. I would never ever go back to them again.
2014-06-23,4,This is what I called authentic Malaysian cuisine close to those in new york Chinatown. This place here TKO'ed "House of Malaysia" and "Penang" restaurant in New Jersey. Most of the staffs are Malaysians and the owner is from Ipoh, Malaysia--that's if my ears were working correctly because the our order was a big distraction--it was so delicious, I almost drowned with my own saliva. We ordered chow kueh teow, wat tan hor, roti telur, satay chicken, chicken rice (Hainanese), indian mee goreng and ice coffee. Great place, thanks to yelp!
2014-06-01,4,Went for the 6.50$ lunch special which is a good deal. Has the Tregannu chicken . A solid curry that probably is very calorie high. The roti canai I had but was nothing special . Staff was pleasant
2014-05-15,3,I was really excited to try this place. I just wanted to get everything listed on their menu. I would definitely come back to try other items. The staff members were extremely nice and prompt when I went.The place is tiny so I wouldn't recommend this place for a big group. Roti Kanai: pretty goodShrimp Dumpling: mehCoffee bubble tea - mehChow Kueb Teow: good but nothing totally amazingFried ice cream: Disappointing! The only other fried ice cream I've ever tried is the one from the Viet restaurant in JC. That one is totally amazeballs but Satay's version didnd't even come close
2014-05-13,4,Love the Malaysian cuisine.  Some dishes vary, some are really good some aren't so good.  the MANGO NOODLE is the BEST!!  Also, the Udang Chili and Lemongrass Chicken is one of our faves.  Super quick service, both eat-in and take-out.  Nothing too fancy but an easy and casual dinner.
2014-05-03,3,satay is a toss up. their wonton soup is awesome--- so is their fried rice in the lotus leaf. they have bubble tea too which is a rarity in hoboken. so if you order right you're all good. their shrimp always underwhelm me.. they're not deveined. their coconut rice is good too. I like the lunch specials but def think the entrees are overpriced.
2014-04-25,2,If this review was based only on the food,I would probably have given it 4 stars.But ofcourse,we had to put up with their (lack of)service too!We came in around 8 and was seated quickly enough after which they promptly forgot about us.A bigger group came in and sat at the table next to us and the manager(I guess) decided that they probably deserved more attention than us.We waited while he chatted them up and they placed their order(yup they came in after us).After about 15 mins of waiting, we called him and he sent someone to take our order.We ordered the roti paratha and ayam rendang.The roti paratha was yummy(we ordered one more) and ayam rendang was pretty good too.But before we could finish our first roti paratha,a waiter came and started clearing our plates.He even tried to take away the dipping curry which we were still eating!Noone came to refill our water even after we looked around multiple times for someone.I signaled a server for a box which she got for us but before we could ask for the dessert menu,she turned around and left.By this time,I was tired of playing the 'wait for someone to notice me' game and waved at the manager for the check.Even though he didnt feel the need to check on us before,he hovered over us while we were tipping!(talk about unprofessional)And if all this was not enough,he asked us if we would be able to tip some more(We had purposefully decided to tip less than usual just to show how dissatisfied we were)!We replied we were not happy with the service and the guy just smirked, turned around and left.No apology,nothing!I am pretty sure we are never ever coming back here!I like my food sans attitude!
2014-04-25,4,We came here with a fairly large group for a birthday party.  Our table was ready on time and our BYOB bottles were promptly opened.  The waiter seemed a bit more concerned with setting up the other empty tables than taking our appetizer order, so we had to wait a bit.  Yes, as soon as we sat down he was ready to take our order so we said we needed a minute (we hadn't even opened the menu yet), but then he walked away, began setting up other tables, and almost refused to come back.  We waved to him a few times to signal we were ready, but we were either ignored or he was indifferent, so that was a little strange.  The place isn't that big, so he was literally a few feet away from us. Eventually he came back to our table for our app order after about 15 minutes. Appetizers were good- we had coconut calamari, beef skewers, and veggie dumplings.  Entrees were also good, a bit heavy on the sauce, but not smothering. I ordered a spicy dish but it wasn't very spicy, but it was flavorful. We're dropping a star for service but enjoyed the food, so we'd be back if in the area and in the mood for this kind of food.
2014-04-08,4,It's a small place in Hoboken. The food and service are good. The roti canai was really good and a must try. We also tried this drink they had which was a mix of Malaysian tea and coffee. Definitely different but it actually ended up tasting good.
2014-04-05,4,I always enjoy small restaurants with big flavors. This is exactly what Satay is! I ordered the Udang Trengganu. It has to be the best type of curry I've ever had. The spices were perfect and the shrimp was cooked just right. My taste buds were dancing! The coconut rice compliments well with the dish bc it's a little sweet. Also! If you're a coffee enthusiast. You MUST try the coffee. It's silky, not too sweet and you can really taste the coffee flavor.
2014-03-31,4,Great food. No. 49 a lamb dish and 65 a shrimp dish with coconut, on the menu are great :)
2014-03-30,4,I've been coming to Satay for many years. The food never disappoints. The service is quick. It's a little dark inside which is good if you want a little romantic ambiance with your dinner. I love that they serve their food in fruit shells. I'm a fan of the Masaka Nenas which is shrimp with pineapple served in an actual pineapple shell. (like i said) Chow Kueh Teow, stir fried flat noodles with the shrimp and squid, is yummy. They do great pork chops with mango as well. If you are in downtown Hoboken and craving some yummy Malaysian spot, this is the place for you.
2014-03-22,4,What a great little gem. I came here on a Friday a little after 7PM with my husband and sister. The place doesn't take reservations but we were seated promptly. They were kind enough to move us to a  less cramped table once someone else got up and before we ordered (unprompted) which was thoughtful.We ordered:Apps:Roti Telur: 5/5 hot, crispy and the sauce side was spicy and deliciousSatay Tofu: 4/5 Crispy and piping hot the point off would be that it only came with two piecespeanut sauce was great not too thick and spicy vs. the typical non-spicy in-restaurant styleEntrees:Singapore Fried Mee Hoon 4/5Noodles were thin and delicious nothing spectacular but definitely hits the spot if you're looking for a tasty noodle option (i love anything with chinese sausage so .. haha)Nasi Lemak 5/5Chicken was tender and oh so good paired perfectly with the coconut rice #nomnomnomnomnomSoft Shell Crab Tom Yum Special 6/5GREAT! A+++ Not to spicy not to salty and ample amount of crispified soft shelled crab halves with all of the regular ingredients of a tom yum soup. YUM YUM! Sadly we were so full we didn't have any room for dessert but I definitely want to come back for the mango sticky rice. Will be back.All of that was under $60 with tax.PROS:Food, Preperation, Fresh ingredients, Service, Price, BYOBCONS:One-stall bathroom, a bit on the smaller side, no reservations
2014-03-21,5,A MUST TRY!Best appetizers: Roti canai, satay chicken, fried shrimp dumpling with extra spicy mayo sauce.Best entrees:Ayang Kelapa (breaded fried chicken strips with sweet and spicy sauce, cucumbers, carrots)Ayam Tropical (Crispy chicken with tangy sauce)"The Best" (simply the best shrimp dish)I will add more when I try more...stay tuned!
2014-03-07,4,Went here for the lunch special. While the basil chicken dish wasn't bad and it well priced ( ~7), the chicken was very plain and it seemed like the sauce was just slathered on.On the bright side, the bubble tea was delicious!
2014-03-02,4,Good food, decent service and good value.Roti canai (with chicken curry) was good. Fresh coconut juice was above average. The noodles we ordered were good too. The service was good and the waitress was nice enough to give good recommendations. I would definitely go back to try other interesting things on the menu.
2014-02-28,2,Dinner with GFFood- it was ok. everything was a bit saltyService- very nice and attentiveAmbiance- meh. it's not fancyThe food was pretty salty.The roti was ok but not great.The beef rendang curry sauce was a bit flavorless.The servers are very nice and attentive.My GF stood me up for an hour (she was stuck in traffic) but the waiter let me grab our table and didn't bother me the whole time. Possibly because it was kind of slow in there but I appreciate the fact that they were courteous.
2014-02-23,3,Let's get one thing straight the menu that is posted here is inaccurate and their actual menu is somewhat inaccurate.  As a veggie eater, it seems like my options were limited in this restaurant. The so-called vegetable section  had entrees that contain seafood, i don't know if its a language barrier issue but vegans and most vegetarians do not eat seafood.Other than that the food i ordered which involves fried stuffed bean curd  and vegetables with curry were delish and the owner and staff seem nice and the service was quick...waitress took  our orders right away, brought it within 10mins and never felt like i was being rushed out since we stayed there for a while.
2014-02-21,1,Food here is ok.. But the manager is extremely rude.. After signing off the bill he tells me that I should give more tip.. And he does not even move from the table.. This is the worst experience I ever had in a restaurant in US...I will never go back to this place again.. Never
2014-02-20,4,Delicious, reasonably priced food and annoying, arrogant, know it all, loud talking, 30 year olds from the caucus mountains all around , beware, they ruin the ambiance and digestion.
2014-02-09,4,Yummy for our tummy!!! Another spot where we can suffice our cravings for some roti canai. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff. I took one star out because their bubble tea was meh!
2014-01-31,4,Really only get take out from here, one of our go to take out spots... Menu highlights: roti canai, shrimp dumplings with that amazingly creamy dipping sauce, all of their noodles, beef and basil, lamb and duck in plum sauce!!
2014-01-12,3,I had the lunch special at this place. It's very good value for money at $6.50 for a meal and a soup starter. However, the flavors aren't anything to rave about. I had the soft shell crab which was supposed to in a spicy sauce, it tasted more sweet than spicy. On the whole, value for money for a quick lunch of a decent portion size.
2014-01-10,4,Service was excellent. The thing about Malay food is that you need to eat it quick, or the sauce will get cold and heavy. Ordered the Volcano spar ribs, good but the chunks were large. Siam chicken was cooling off and a little sweet for my taste. However we def want to come back to try other dishes, worth the try, recommended.
2014-01-08,4,Try It. Unique genre with a menu reminiscent of thai (if you like thai would certainly say drop by Satay). The simple decor, quick service and afternoon specials make Satay an ideal spot for lunch. Drop by for a meal that won't push the limits of your lunch hour, though it may tug at the notches on your belt.Tip: share a Pandan Chicken app
2014-01-05,4,Food was good. Had some interesting non-white-guy food. Great, friendly service. Portions are plenty big, some huge. :)
2013-12-30,4,Went here about a month ago for lunch and compared to the other Malaysian places I have been to, this is one of the best places to go to. Everything was a good price and had good portions.. I had the roti canai and it was perfect. All the staff were friendly as well and I'm definitely coming back here again!
2013-12-28,4,I love this place especially the roti canai. My mum is Chinese from Malaysia and the food is slightly westernised although still authentic and delicious. Eat in for better food as the food quality decreases during delivery time. Highly recommended is roti, achat, satay, chicken potato curry and excellent deals on lunch specials. They also have off menu items....
2013-12-16,2,Went there with a few friends. Good atmosphere. My friend didn't like his meat dish which he thought should have fish (he grew up in Malaysia) but they told him it doesn't and when he said he wanted to exchange the dish they told him no. I told them to make my veggie food mild but it still came out pretty spicy. Guess that's Malaysian food though. Overall a decent place.
2013-12-13,1,Quite bad service. This man who looks like owner tries to explain me( from Malaysia) how Nasi Lemak is supposed to look like. Chicken was not even cooked properly. Parts of the dish was missing. They added more things which generally are not even put in Nasi Lemak He did not even offer or agree to change my order to something else.
2013-11-27,4,I've been coming to Satay Malaysian for several years, through several management changes, and mostly for their lunch specials. Where else can you get a choice of four soups, four different rice plus your entree for about $7? The restaurant is always packed during lunch on weekdays. In the summer they have sidewalk tables.Satay also offers an extensive Chinese menu. However, since I can get Chinese just about anywhere, I usually stick with the Malaysian dishes. It is the depth and flavor of their sauces that increase Satay's stars. I've had relatives visiting from California that say this is the best restaurant on their trip, and mostly due to the sauces. For the lunch specials, try something other than plain white rice and go for the Coconut rice or Hainanese rice. Both are aromatic and tasty. My favorite lunch specials are the Curry Chicken with Potato, Shrimp with Lemongrass, Dried Curry Shrimp and a fresh fish (usually grouper). The fish dish is the only one which I think the sauce is too sweet. The other dishes are spicy. They also have a number of vegetarian dishes, and good rice noodle and chow fun dishes that you can ask to spice up even more.The dinner menu is large and has many of my Malaysian favorites such as Kambing Rendang-Lamb with a thick, spicy coconut curry sauce; Ayam Hainanese-Steamed chicken; Ugang chili-Shrimp in red curry paste. Don't forget the Rorti Canai which comes with a great yellow curry chicken dipping sauce. So wonderful as an appetizer!The restaurant is BYOB which is one of the best things about dining in Hoboken. I'll keep coming here as long as they keep refining their sauces at this level!
2013-11-21,3,The bread was amazing , duck not so great it was fatty. Spare ribs where ok too sweet . I blame this on my choices I'm sure here
2013-11-16,3,Not the best Malaysian food I have had. I have been here 2 times, hoping id get a better experience the second time-but what a fail. We ordered a chicken dish which was crap! The pad thai was awesome, which is not even Malaysian. The roti kanai was really good. The best party about this place is it is BYOB. The service wasn't that great, very hard to communicate.
2013-11-14,5,Hey guys! If you are not familiar with their food, please check their food pictures #69 till 127. Then, you should know what to order. Enjoy!!!
2013-10-31,2,I ordered from here once. I found the food overly oily, flavorless and pricey for what you are getting. All the dishes tasted the same...that is bland. Was really hoping that I would like this place!
2013-10-25,1,Okies I love Malaysian food and this was really disappointing to me... I had two different order of curry...ones is masak Ninas ...which is beef with fresh pineapples cuncks,bell pepper, mint,and scallions in a spicy curry sauce.. It was creamy but yet lack of meat..the next dish I order sambas ayam which is sautéed beef spicy Malaysian shrimp pasta,sliced onion,bell pepper in chilly sauce...this dish was wayyy to oily...top of the dish was filled with oil..lack of poultry..shrimp paste was to heavy....I order it to go...they put my food in containers but didn't even have the decency to close the lid shut...pretty much the curry was dripping throw the bag.. I was really pissed... Before i left the place I got a Malaysian bubble tea... I asked for less sugar they pretty much didn't put any sugar in my drink... Probley didn't hear me correctly but the most disappointing part would be the the tapioca in my drink...all the tapioca was stuck together...I could not slurp my straw... I didn't like that at all.. Expically when the tapioca was extremely hard...don't ever get there bubble tea there it's disgusting! Inside the decor is nice...pretty much packed the day i went ..I don't even know why since the food was mediocre...I'm guessing its the decor...there's outdoor seating...parking is so annoying...there's no parking around the restaurant...pretty much parked two block from the restaurant..differently not coming back!
2013-10-24,5,OMG!! Best Malaysian place ever...had to come back here
2013-10-21,4,So, I gave this place another go, and finally hit the jackpot.  The secret was mango noodles.  Amazing.  We shared food as a table and the second entree was chicken in coconut sauce (cannot remember the name, it was #59 on the menu).  Also phenomenal.  Bumped up to 4 stars for how good the dine-in was, once I finally discovered their hidden gems.  Really can't say enough good things about the mango noodle!(P.S. avoid the coconut pudding. I love coconut but the consistency is untenable).
2013-10-12,2,Ordered peanut pancake to go.  They charge me the dine in price.  The price I see on yelp is 5.95 and they charged me $7.50.  Talking about inflation!
2013-10-09,2,Very average. Seems like there are some authentic dishes but the ingredients and spices were lacking to make this a place I would visit again. Unfortunate because good mala food is difficult to find short of going to Malaysia which is amazing.
2013-10-04,4,I like this BYOB place. The food was fresh and tasty. We had a green curry chicken and mango noodles. Both were delicious. As an apetizer, go for a Roti Canai. Will go there more often!!!
2013-09-25,2,The food here is definitely worth 4 stars in my book.  At least, most of the dishes I've tried are, but the menu is massive so I can't vouch for more than maybe 2% of it.  I really like the warm peanut noodles, the fried rice, the Indian Pancake, and lots of other dishes.  However, the woman who answers the phone can be a pain in the butt.  She's been there for years and she probably owns the place because I don't think I've ever had anyone else answer the phone.  She's always extremely short with me whenever I call.  She never gives me a total, or a time until delivery unless I ask for it, and very often she hangs up so fast I can't ask.  Sometimes I have to ask her questions about a menu item, and she sounds really annoyed.  Her English can be VERY difficult to understand, so maybe she's just not comfortable with the language enough to want to speak more than the absolute minimum... i don't know.  It just seems like she's always in a rush to get off the phone.Today, I noticed she marked up the price for EVERYTHING I ordered.  Not my by much so I just assumed I had an old menu with old prices.  But when they delivered the food, they included a menu, and I realized my menu wasn't old.  She just marked up the prices on me.As for the price... generally, it isn't cheap, but it's not especially expensive either.  They do have some decent lunch specials though.Ultimately, the food is good enough to endure the difficult/ rude service and the overcharging.UPDATE:The food seems to have gone down hill a bit lately.  The last 2 times we ordered from here, the food wasn't as good. And last night we ordered from here and both my girlfriend and I got sick.  Bummer.  I used to enjoy this place.  Had to drop my rating by 1 star.
2013-09-24,5,I must be hungry because I'm writing a review about this place. Have been here once the atmosphere inside is bland although take out is the wheezy between my knees. I definitely re moment this place the aroma shrimp rotai canai bubble tea and there lamb soup.... Pretty much everything is amazing even there sticky rice with mango to the mango noodles. I feel like a fat kid for writing this but I feel fat after I eat this too. It is very heavy on the stomach so eat it sparingly. Best for after a long night or week of drinking. Take my advice ;) have fun it's a gem that should stay in Hoboken forever. I even had my family meet me here because this was my fat kid dream to eat here one more time since I moved away from this area.
2013-09-15,3,For appetizer we ordered the Vegetarian Roti Canai which was good except that it usually has veggies in it but this one did not..anyhow it was tasty!Then for dinner we had mango noodles with tofu which wasnt close to the mango noodles we have had earlier in other malaysian restaurants.. Its supposed to be tangy sweet but this one was salty and just ok to be honest.. They could definitely work on this one! But the other entree.. The 99 one.. Forgetting the name.. Was a kick ass one! High on flavor and fresh veggies.. 5 on 5 for that.. Overall a decent experience.. Wud definitely come back!
2013-09-09,3,This was a decent place for dinner. My date and I got the Roti Canai as an appetizer, which was delicious. As far as entrees go, I got the Beef Rendang and it was only okay. I'm not an expert at Malaysian cuisine, but the beef was rough. My date had Ayam Hainanese, I think. She's a self-proclaimed expert in Malaysian cuisine and was not a fan of her dish. On a more positive note, the place is BYOB, which is always a plus.
2013-09-04,3,Fresh, clean interiors, quick service, a variety of well-priced lunch specials make this Hoboken eatery  a good choice for a quick meal. Try the Veg seaweed soup, Curry soup, Shrimp with Spinach or Mongolian Beef for a afternoon pick me up. Have never been here for dinner, so cannot comment.
2013-08-28,5,Satay is amazing! They use quality ingredients and don't skimp on portions. The Roti Canai is such a tasty app! Some of my favorite entrees are Tropical Chicken, Mango Noodles, and Kelapa Chicken. I've also had their Bubble Teas and Mango Sticky Rice for dessert. They have a Malaysian menu as well as a Chinese menu so there will always be something for everyone in a group. It's BYOB if you want to dine in or they also offer delivery too. They show up about 15 minutes after you call so no need to sit and wait an hour for your food!
2013-08-28,4,FROM A FIRST TIMER!Went to this place yesterday and I will def be returning! Casual place with good food. Service was also good. The staff helped my friend and I make selections based on what we liked and what was popular. For appetizer we had the Roti Canai, love it. We ended up keeping the sauce and used it on our rice. For entrees we tried the basil and chili chicken it was pretty good. It was a very similar flavor to a Thai dish but I think there's a lot of similarity in the food. We also had the lemongrass and curry shrimp, forgot the exact name but it was something with Mai in it. At first I was little iffy about the dish but after getting used to the lemongrass I enjoyed it. I will def be going back and exploring more of the menu.
2013-08-26,4,Yum, Yum and Double-Yum!Great Stop after working all day and getting off of that PATH train - Curry Curry Curry!  i could eat a gallon.Appetizers that will never disappoint!Call ahead and order if you you are going to take out - The wait quick.
2013-08-15,3,Satay offers ample variety on its menu for vegetarians.  We went to Satay on Saturday night  and were seated immediately. We tried roti canai which I say you must try as an appetizer. We also ordered pickled vegetables and I will suggest do not go for it . They serve the vegetables cold which does not do any justice to the taste . It would have tasted better  if they would have served it hot .For the main course ,we had  ginger fried rice ,Singapore noodles and curry with mixed vegetables . We enjoyed everything in the main course . The food came fast and the service was good .As for taste it is not similar to Thai food . You can definitely try this place .
2013-08-07,2,If you can enjoy a meal (no matter how palatable) while almost being harassed by the serving staff, then this is the place for you!No need to elaborate on what happened coz many of the reviewers seem to have been through the same - nagging menu manipulations & begging for a higher tip by holding the customer outside the restuarant door and shrieking nasty remarks when not paid head to. That was ridiculous. Never again am I stepping at their doorstep again!
2013-08-07,4,Went there on a Saturday for a lunch special! We were walking around Hoboken and saw to our surprise that the place had a lunch special, very affordable! Four of us ate for $25! And the food was pretty great! The noodles were fresh (although a tad oily), and the curries were fresh, light, and extremely flavorful. The parothha (Malayasian bread) and chicken curry, which we ordered as an appetizer, was very good.  The only disappointment was the seaweed soup, which smelt too fishy to be palatable. Not sure if the seaweed was old or the soup was bad. We left that. The only reason I would not give this place 5 stars is because the wait staff can be a little short. We couldn't really understand the waitress at all, and she, we think, couldn't understand us. And although it is a small (tiny) restaurant, we ended up waving a lot to get their attention for regular things like water etc.. However, for an overall experience, and the excellent food, I'm happy to give it 4 stars!
2013-08-04,3,The ambience is nice but tables are a little too close to each other.  The  servers have a little language barrier but if you know what to eat, you will do just fine. The roti canai was spot on. We had fried coconut calamari, was too salty. We had a peanut chicken entree, which I was enjoyed very much, soothing my every tropical taste bud.  I would go here once, just to try. Won't hurt!
2013-08-02,4,The Roti Canai here was light and crispy.  I had a couple different items here..the satay chicken, penang lobak and some salt & peppered prawns.  It was all amazingly tasty.  The restaurant is quaint. It has this warm, feel good feeling to it. I thought the wait staff was pleasant.  This has to be one of the better Malaysian restaurants I've had in the New Jersey/New York area.
2013-07-22,5,Roti Paratha (Wheat Pancake) appetizer, Curry Chicken with Potato entree (with coconut rice as a substitute) and Taro Bubble Milk Tea are my favorite!  I love this place and eat here or order from here a couple times a week!  I even just pop in to get a bubble milk tea to go. So good!
2013-07-06,1,Ridiculously rude staff. From the moment we say down till we left, I've never experienced worse service. Just because we're a big table and tip is included doesn't mean you treat us like crap!
2013-07-03,4,This was my first time to a malaysian cuisine.I just loved the roti canai and ended up having that as appetizer and main course as well :)Also there was a spicy shrimp dish for entree (I dont recall the name) and was damn good.I definitely recommend the bubble tea any flavor except coconut flavor.My personal choice is melon or honeydew. Its very refreshing.
2013-07-01,4,A really great place for Malaysian food.  Low key, casual, very fast service.My picks:Chicken Trengganu Curry ( i might have spelled it wrong, just look for something similarly spelled)Singaporean Noodles - this is unique because they use shrimp and chinese sausage.  You really can't go wrong in terms of flavor.This is one of those places that if you lived or worked near, you would probably take out or have lunch here once a week.
2013-06-24,4,i used to come here often with a cousin of mine and let me tell you the food hasnt changed it is still the best malaysian food i have ever had, the service tho.....sub par for a place with such awesome menu and ambience! i usually get their Roti, Penang lobak and Pineapple fried rice with chicken or the lemon pork chops. TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am getting hungry just thinking about this!!i do hope they can change their wait staff and maybe it will be the perfect little corner restaurant!!!! it is BYOB too!!
2013-06-22,4,Tried most of the Malaysian dishes here and the taste is always unique and flavorful.  Dry curry beef and taro chicken are excellent.
2013-06-09,5,I've gone to Satay for a couple years now, not very often, but often enough to have been convinced of the consistent quality of the food here.Long story short, it's great.The flavors are really authentic, and it's easy to taste the influences from Indian, Thai, Chinese, and other culinary traditions. Some of the dishes themselves are obvious transplants from other traditions, but others are rather unique to Malaysian, but Satay shines all around. I have never left Satay unsatisfied, and would recommend it without hesitation to anyone who's interested.
2013-06-07,1,Never met so poor service in US! If u read through the review u will find that all good reviews are about the three dishes (where u can find in other Malaysian restaurants) but not about the service. In sum, if u do not care about the way u are treated, go it and hopefully u do not have any conflicts with the owner.
2013-05-21,3,We started with the beef satay which was really good. We both got curry dishes and they tasted very similar. It was good. Service was a bit slow for a Thursday late night.
2013-05-13,5,Eat here at least once every week.  Great service, great food - love the hainan chicken.  Most authentic Hainan chicken I've found in the US.
2013-05-10,1,They will embaress you if you did not give a minimun of 10-15% tip. The waiter will stare at your bill that you just singed and ask you "you only tip this much?" They will force you to tip minumun of 15%. if you dont believe me, try it! dont go there on a date if you dont wanna make a fool out of yourself. The food is fairly decent.
2013-05-08,4,For a none Asian neighborhood, I was quite surprised to find this place. The food is quite authentic, definitely comparable to the malaysian places you'll find in Chinatown, but at a higher price range. Love their Ayam Hainanese Chicken, and their Ayam Redang Chicken was good too. (Get the Ayam Redang Beef - heard that's even better). Many of the reviews mention about their poor service, our experience was quite the opposite, thought they were very nice and very attentive.. well, maybe a little too attentive. Overall, our experience was positive. Big bonus, they're BYOB!
2013-05-03,5,I love this place. Delicious food, cute decor, and warm service. I will be coming back again and again.
2013-04-29,1,I'm taking a break from my DC/VA reviews to knock you off your peg, Satay. you've irritated me THAT much.the food is still great...that much is true.but Satay is on my blacklist until you teach your new waitstaff:1) not to insist on trying to upsell customers. it's cool to recommend something if it's a special, but to question our choices - after we've told you MULTIPLE times our orders? GTFO. no, we don't want appetizers, for the fourth time. no, we don't want bubble tea, for the third time. no, we don't want dessert, for the SIXTH TIME. I want the green curry dish, I want it with chicken, I don't want it with some other meat or base, and I don't want coconut rice.2) not to hover over customers. dude was checking on us every two minutes and asking us about the food. at first it was funny, like he was our spirit guide or something providing assistance on a quest...but on the hundredth time, it was annoying as hell. 3) NEVER, EVER tell customers what to tip. our Best Malaysian Friend told us to just round it all to $80 and make it $20 a person. excuse me? for your annoyingly rude behavior that would make even a French person cringe? I deliberately made sure we left him $79.I hadn't been to Satay in a while, and I was hoping it would be as good as I recall. I saw the older waitstaff - who I recognized - inside, so hopefully this was just a new guy...but yeah, looks like it'll be a while until I show my face here again.
