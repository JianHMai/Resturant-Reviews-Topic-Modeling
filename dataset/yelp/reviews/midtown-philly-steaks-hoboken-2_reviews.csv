2021-11-04,2,Should have went to subway. Got the Pittsburgh, almost no slaw, the meat didn't even fill the sandwich. Asked for extra wiz and watched him put a half a spoonful on. Not even close to a Philly cheesesteak. I really wanted this to be a good review  ‍
2021-11-01,5,Love midtown cheese steaks. Doesn't matter if your sober hung over. Drunk. Always tastes the same.!!!  Love it always come back
2021-09-07,4,Enjoyed our sandwiches.. good portions, nice selections & yummy sides They were running the shop very well during covid.  We visited back in April 2021
2021-08-26,5,Get the Diablo chicken cheese steak..it's so so good. I get it on garlic bread for that extra punch. We have always got delivery.It's really the best sandwich ever. They also use decent quality chicken...none of that dark meat stuff. It's clean white chicken.
2021-08-26,5,Best cheesesteaks around. Try a new one each time. Cheesesteak rolls are excellent as well
2021-08-20,5,First time trying Midtown. One of the best cheesesteaks I've had ever. Order was made exactly how I asked. Customer service was impeccable. Will definitely come back next time we are in the area.
2021-08-08,2,Cheesesteak was decent I guess but where is the cheese??? Bread was kinda soggy and def wouldn't choose to have it on garlic bread again. Just meh.
2021-07-31,1,Unfortunately I went to this place while drinking in Hoboken & thought it would be a good place to line our stomachs. There was nobody in the place. My father was not happy with the food. Instead of providing a refund for us, the "owner" got very aggressive with him. He threatened to call the cops & clinched his fists. I, personally, didn't mind the food but the service was unacceptable. It was a very bad experience over all. I would not recommend that you patron this place. If I could give no stars I would.
2021-06-22,1,Within an hour of waiting for my delivery I got a call from the manager stating that the machines were going to be down for at least three hours... this is so unprofessional and I honestly don't want anything to do with this place
2021-04-26,2,I was really excited to give this place another chance as the reviews are great. Unfortunately, I received a chipotle cheesesteak on what tasted and felt like an undercooked/ doughy hoagie roll. I've never encountered such, but I was very disappointed. The Cajun fries were pretty decent. Overall I don't know if I'll order from here again.
2021-04-16,2,Food is good for what is it, however, customer service detracts from the entire experience. I have called in orders many times and it's always the same: very unfriendly and unpleasant. It's always the same guy answering the phone, Rupesh. This also carries on in the store. I likely won't be returning here as Rupesh's attitude ruins the experience, every single time. The experience is not worth the food.
2021-03-08,4,Ordered for pick up as I was getting my glasses adjusted across the street. My order was not quite ready by the time I was done (probably roughly 10 minutes), so I would say the average order time is probably 15 - 20 minutes? Sandwiches were tasty and I like how they let you pick your preferred cheese. I'm a gross cheese whiz kind of gal, but X only likes provolone on his cheesesteak, so it was perfect for us. I wish the default came with some onions, because it did feel like it was missing something. Staff were very friendly and masks are required to enter.
2021-03-01,5,Definitely a guilty pleasure! I love a good chicken cheesesteak and i love how you can customize these to exactly how you like it. You can add as many or as little veggies as you like. They have like 5 or 6 different types of cheeses to choose from. You can even get your cheesesteak on garlic bread! They have the low carb option (but in my mind I'm gonna do it or not). I really like their Cajun fries too. They're crispy just like I like them. Satisfying cheat meal.
2021-03-01,5,I have no clue why some reviews are ruthless on here. I can honestly say every time I have eaten, taken out, or got my cheesesteak delivered from here it has been flawless! The sweet potato fries and Cajun fries are to die for and the cheesesteaks are really authentic! I can say they can compete with the south st. Vendors in Philly! The meat portions are good and the cheesesteak just has a lot of flavor! Loved them!
2021-02-24,2,Came across this restaurant while my co-worker and I was dying for food. long story short- meat was tasteless, bread was like a wet sponge, everything just fell out of the hoagie and it was just a disaster. I must say their fries are pretty great. Do not get the cheesesteak!
2021-02-16,5,Cheesesteaks are on point. Along with quality service.  Would definitely recommend if you want something good and fast. Fries are also fresh.  If you're in Hoboken try this spot out. Definitely won't regret it.
2021-01-26,2,The food is okay, delivery takes so long that the food is usually like warm by the time it gets to you. Also, the delivery drivers are LAZY and refuse to come to your door (even pre-covid). They will just leave toss it in your lobby like an animal. Not worth itManager does not put customers first... accused customers of lying!!
2021-01-14,5,I love this place which is why im giving it 5 stars but I just laid an extra 2 dollars for extra whiz on both my cheesesteaks and i can tell you right now, i didnt receive that extra scoop of whiz. I know this because i ordered from here every week when i lived in hoboken. Im upset guys, why didnt you give me the extra whiz, ive been good to you and this is how you do me! The extra whiz would always make it messy and the foil would be covered, now tell me does this look like extra whiz to you. No, it doesnt. Other than that it was awesome guys keep up the good work!
2020-12-15,3,Fry on plain wings was overdone. Forgot my beverages with my delivery. Cheesesteaks were okay.
2020-12-10,3,It's not great. The fillings were good, some may prefer to double up. But what makes or breaks a cheesesteak is the bread, and this one was served cold n soggy. If you're used to Pat's/Geno's, this won't measure up. But Hoboken is a long way from Philly and sometimes you just need enough to hit the spot.
2020-11-29,4,Bread is so soft which makes the sandwich almost melt in your mouth. Recommend getting double cheese otherwise it isn't enough IMO. Go to cheesesteak spot in Hoboken.
2020-09-12,1,Their food is ok but their delivery sucks! They are on Uber Eats but took the liberty to handle their deliveries independently. They should just remove themselves from Uber Eats and stay on Grubhub. They are attempting to charge me for food that I didn't accept. The delivery finally arrive after 1.5 hours and the guy had the audacity to ask for a tip. I had already eaten something else by that time. Zero stars but there is NO option!
2020-08-28,1,Place cancelled my order after I called them to make sure the second order had ketchup. Place is a joke. Food is alright. But I'm done wit em! Shitbag manager can't handle his job...
2020-08-22,5,My husband said "it was very good". It was so good; he went back the next day. He said it had a great amount of cheese and onions. Quick service.
2020-08-08,3,The food is good.  The reduction in stars is based on delivery issues the last three times I have ordered.  I strongly recommend against ordering for delivery.  Last week, my delivery was late and arrived cold.  Today, my order through Uber Eats never arrived.  I called the restaurant twice.  I ordered again through Yelp and while my ordered arrived, the fries were missing.Again, the food is really good.  Super bummed to not order again.
2020-06-18,3,This place has always been consistent and pretty good.  You have to set your expectations realistically, though.  This is a fast food cheesesteak and is priced accordingly.  For the price, this is a good option.
2020-06-04,5,I don't know why there's so many 2-3 star reviews not unless they have higher standards for cheesesteaks than I. Anyways, I can't lie I was hesitant at first because of the reviews but I decided to go ahead and I do not regret it!! I got the Garlic Mozz Cheesesteak but I subbed the Mozz for provolone and it was AMAZING. It hit the spot perfectly! I might just come back again tomorrow! But will DEF double the steak since Im greedy hehe
2020-03-15,2,I ordered a regular cheesesteak here and wasnt very impressed. One of the biggest disappointments was that the cheese was not even melted on the sub. There also wasnt very much mayo, and the extra mayo I ordered on the side was not delivered. A lot of bread too. Pretty good mozz sticks though. Probably won't be lording from here again unless I'm craving something like this and I'm drunk.
2020-03-10,2,I was there on Sunday 3/8 with high expectations after seeing all the great reviews, but I am sad to report that it was an underwhelming experience. I ordered 2 cheesesteaks with onions. I regret not taking a picture of them, but the bread to meat ratio was way off! Flavor was ok, but nothing special. If these are suppose to be AUTHENTIC cheesesteaks than the mark was surely missed! Idk if it was just a bad day or what, but these were far from what you'd get in Philly and left us rather disappointed. The only way I MIGHT return is if I we're offered a credit, but it was a waste of time & money considering I drove 35 min for them. Furthermore I called today (3/10) and spoke to the manager on site who was very rude and defensive about my feedback. He even went as far as saying "our cheesesteaks are better than any place in Philly" and also said "we don't advertise our cheesesteaks as authentic". For anyone that's ever had a philly cheesesteak you know it's loaded with meat, so please do NOT go to Midtown Philly Steaks too hungry or expecting anything close to a philly cheesesteak because disappointment is surely guaranteed! Lastly, you should stop decieving customers and take the word PHILLY out of your name if you can't live up to it or even want to be associated with a Philly style cheesesteak. You sounded very hypocritical Mr. Manager. Also instead of HANGING UP on me, maybe some kind of credit towards a future visit would of been the PROFESSIONAL thing to do, but clearly good customer service isn't your strong suit. This place is a joke nor even close to authentic.
2020-02-18,5,Best Philly Cheesesteak hands down. I have had it all. This is my favorite. I go with steak, onion, provolone, and american. The bread is fantastic and the steak is sliced up fine. I always tell my Philly friends that this is the best steak sandwich.
2020-02-01,5,I would fuck this cheesesteak. Better than any cheesesteak that has ever been served in Philadelphia. I've never actually had a cheesesteak from philly though so, do with this what you will. But I'm also a professional foOd critic. Do with THAT whaT you will.
2020-01-30,2,Sorry but I don't quite agree with you sir.If you look at all the photos for cheesesteaks in 2019, obviously something changed. There is far less meat portioning so I do not known what you are talking about when you say your portion sizes have not changed. It is self-evident in these photos that users upload.
2020-01-26,4,Good food. I ordered their Philly Cheesesteak wrap with a side of their Cajun Fries. Food came hot, well packaged & in good time. Very flavorful. Unfortunately, the man who delivered the food was rude & seemed in a  rush. Other then that I would not mind ordering from here again as far as the food quality goes.
2019-12-28,1,Cashier asked me what kind of cheese I wanted, I said whatever is good... the guy gave me a cheesesteak with no cheese...
2019-12-18,2,I don't get the hype. The chipotle cheesesteak which seems to be the most popular was terrible. The steak itself was basically like ground meat. The bread wasn't warm. And the chipotle sauce wasn't good and just smeared on top. We ended up getting cheesesteaks from Jersey Mike's right after and even though that's a chain it was 8,000% better. Will not come back.
2019-11-05,5,My experience with this place always leaves on a positive note. I love to order the garlic mozzarella cheesesteak with onions and peppers, and a side of cajun fries. The staff is usually very friendly, especially the young lady at the cash register. She's very professional and always has a smile on her face. It's always a pleasure to be greeted with such enthusiasm. Kudos to you guys for having the best cheesesteaks in town!
2019-10-10,2,Long story short this place is a frequent provider of food poisoning.It's a shame because it's so f***ing good. My boyfriend is a long time Hobokener. Jersey has great Philly cheesesteaks. I got a craving for some and asked him if we could order from here, he said he used to love it but it gave him food poisoning but we could try it again.We did and enjoyed 6 months of cheesesteak bliss. Until one night shortly after having a Midtown cheesesteak my boyfriend was violently ill. Stereotypical food poisoning symptoms that I'll spare you the description but was painful none the less.Luckily food poisoning fades in a day but I unfortunately will never again try the Russian roulette that is Midtown Philly Cheesesteaks  :(
2019-08-26,4,How I haven't reviewed this place yet, I'm unsure. It's one of my go tos for Hoboken takeout/ delivery. The cheesesteaks are legit, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. I love that they also have multiple different options to choose from. You can play it safe with a standard cheesesteak or spice it up and have one on garlic bread or legit spicy with the diablo. Also, they're do late night- very clutch and very delish.
2019-08-17,3,it was ok not great. it was overpriced.  average quality chicken cheesesteak.  I also had the Philly cheesesteak to compare.  and a buffalo chicken cheesteak.  I got 5 things and they were ok but mostly bread with mild flavor in the middle.  I don't need to go again.
2019-08-11,2,Food is alright, but after recent delivery experience I will forever cross off this establishment from my list of delivery places. Place the order online for dinner, and end up getting a phone call from the delivery guy "hey I'm here". I ask "where?" And he goes "outside I was knocking.".I think the delivery guy will be outside my door, and when I inquire where he is he said "oh I'm outside the main door of your building now."LIES. So you're claiming you were outside my apartment door, I didn't come to the door so you walked OUTSIDE to call me and then wait for me there? LIES. You simply didn't want to bring the food upstairs to my apartment. Unsure what I paid a delivery fee AND tip for. Have no respect for delivery places like this.
2019-08-10,1,The guy is a rude and nasty tbh. We just came to get 2 cheesesteaks, the Spanish guy was nice but was replaced in the middle by a south asian dude, who appeared to be the owner.So the owner throws the food at us if he donated it or something. Wth? I am soo deeply disturbed tbh.
2019-08-08,5,This place rocks. They always make a great cheesesteak. Their onion rings are awesome and they are always quick. Great local place to have!
2019-08-03,5,Amazingly good.....very delicious and very rich, staff are very professional and very friendly.....highly recommended
2019-07-28,5,Delicious and a ton of choices. Even for my Keto-diet husband. Great any time of day but especially late night eats.
2019-07-01,2,We got the cajun fries and a cheesesteak. The fries were incredibly oversalted and flavored. I ate one and couldn't continue, and my friends were shaking and dusting the fries off before eating them.Everyone else said the cheese steak was great, but I honestly thought it looked very unappetizing and tasted the same. Luckily I did not order one so I just tried a bite. I'm really not sure why this place has such good reviews. The customers in line were hyping it up as well, and this is a pretty hole in the wall joint, so my expectations were elevated. It's definitely possible that I am the weird one, but I feel like my college dining hall had better custom cheese steaks...
2019-06-20,1,The absolute worst chicken cheese steak I have ever had in my life. Bland can't even describe the taste of this thing.
2019-05-31,3,I've had two issues with the delivery driver telling me he's not coming upstairs, I'm pregnant so if I pay a $3 delivery fee plus tip I'd like to receive my food at the door. I've spoken to management twice and nothing. Afternoon delivery guy is great but the more mature gentleman in the evening is horrible. Besides delivery service the food is good.
2019-05-16,5,Best damn cheesesteak I've had in a long time! Cajun fries were awesome too. Jose did a great job making my cheesesteak with all the fixins. Can't wait for my next
2019-05-09,4,I ordered a plain cheesesteak with cheese. I was surprised it didn't have any peppers or onions. Fries are also very good
2019-04-20,2,Ordered a garlic bread cheesesteak, tavern cheesesteak and Sinatra Cold sub (basic Italian sub). First sub they forgot the cheese and the cold sub barely had meat or cheese and was loaded with lettuce and tomato. Wouldn't order again
2019-04-11,4,Being a commuter to Hoboken, I have heard many things about Washington street eateries but have not really had the chance to actually go out and eat something. My friends has recommended this place if I wanted to eat a tasty meal in the form of a sandwich. I finally decided to go out and try it(buying a recommended Garlic Mozzarella cheesesteak) and actually enjoyed it quite a bit. While it may not be to same level as the two Philly shops in philly, it definitely is better than any other cheesesteak you can get in Hudson Country, New Jersey. I would highly recommend anyone that wants to get a tasty cheesesteak to go here.
2019-04-11,5,This is one of my favorite places in hoboken to grab a bite, some of the best cheesesteak I've had comes from here. I love the garlic mozzarella cheesesteak and the cordon bleu chicken is amazing. I love going here whenever I can, best cheesesteak outside of philly!
2019-03-29,5,This place is my favorite restaurant in Hudson County since I moved here from Philly. The sweet potato fries are so freakin amazing, I literally feel like I'm high while eating the food from there!
2019-03-14,5,As close to Philly as you can got.  Says it all in my book. But yelp wants more words, so I got one more, "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."
2019-03-10,4,I usually order Midtown Philly Steaks when I'm ready to indulge, and it always hits the spot. Last night my boyfriend and I ordered the Philly steak on garlic bread and it was so tasty and full of flavor, and depending on what your pallet is like I could understand if someone said it was too rich/heavy, but we absolutely loved it. My favorite side order are the Cajun fries, always cooked to a crispy perfection. Mozzarella sticks and onion rings were pretty standards, no real complaints. Overall, it was delicious and I will definitely order again in the future. Only critique is they forgot the drink we ordered and of course don't get refunded for it.
2019-03-09,2,It's been over 75 minutes and I still haven't received my small order on a Saturday afternoon. This is beyond unacceptable seeing as I was quoted 30 minutes. To the owner and your auto responses. Yes, I do have formal varifibale restaurant experience, a lot of it actually. You need to hire more drivers, purchase another flat top or simply turn your delivery option off when you are this backed up.
2019-03-09,5,This place is clutch. Such good cheesesteaks and personable staff.  I hit up this spot last night and was given such delicious fries as I waited for my food to be made, wow. Just love good food and a small conversation to take one mood from blah to ending with a smile. Sounds "cheesy" but it's fun, we should all try it sometimes. Haha anyway, great place for excellent cheesesteaks, and open until 4?! Can't beat that.  Can't wait to return.
2019-03-08,4,There chipotle cheesesteak is awesome! I also like French fries. The delivery service is fast and friendly. I only wish they had more dessert choices.
2019-03-05,3,What can I say?? It's fucking cheesesteak. Is it good. Yeah, sure. Is it great? No. That's it. End of review.
2019-02-05,3,Quick, straightforward and tasty. I like that they have low carb platters. I do think it's a bit pricey though, I got a low carb Chipotle Chicken platter and Lemon Pepper fries for $16.53. They do make the food quickly though and they're open late. Not my first choice in Hoboken but I'll probably be back because of the convenience. The food also reheats well!
2019-01-31,2,If you like your cheesesteak meat to look like cat food taken from a can, this is your place. Soggy bread and just completely forgettable taste. 2 stars for cajun friesUpdate: you dont use quality ingredients lol. Do you want to see what I feed my cat from a can, cause it literally looks exactly like the meat you use for your "cheesesteaks". Any pizza place in the hoboken area can make a cheesesteak, with actual shaved steak,  better than Midtown.
2019-01-12,2,We've been ordering from this place since 2014 and I'm not sure if this place changed management but definitely noticed a different sense of customer service.  We placed a $25 order and estimated delivery was 35 minutes.  No biggie,  it was the weekend.  Delivery guy came and refused to come upstairs to our apt. Not convenient.  Once my husband came down and asked for the receipt,  the delivery guy said he didn't have it and this was the right order. The guy insisted that it was the correct order.  My husband checked and it was a completely different order and the delivery guy said he'll be back with the correct order.  My husband had to call and state that the wrong order was delivered.  The man that picked up the phone apologized but didn't even offer to make it right.  They just said they'll have to make the order again.  I ended up calling back to even find out how long it was going to take this time.  The same man said 30 minutes and at that point,  it would have taken over an hour for our order to be delivered.  I asked if there was anything he could do for the mistake,  whether it be a credit for next time or a refund.  He mentioned it was a $25 order and he couldn't do anything.  I had to insist again that this was unacceptable and he finally gave us to give us a refund for one of the fries. He sounded very irritated even though I was completely patient on the phone. Not a good customer service experience.  Oh and to the manager that will "auto" respond to this message.  No,  I don't have formal training in the cheesesteak industry so I definitely will not be coming to your facility to give your team training.  That's your job!  Learn some customer service and actually respond to customers without your robotic auto responses.  Doesn't show how much you care.
2019-01-08,5,Amazing!  Went there for my first time last weekend, ordered a philly with cheese whiz, red/green peppers, onions and jalapenos.  Phenomenal!! I work in lower Manhattan but even making plans with a coworker to go all the way over to hoboken one day soon for lunch it's that good!  Thanks! :)
2019-01-05,1,Horrible delivery people again, not sure if they're friendly to non Americans. Refuses to listen to intercom instructions and angry.
2018-12-29,1,They changed their bread and it is not even close to as good as it used to be. Much chewier, not as fresh and soft. I got it a month ago but hoped it was a freak thing. I ordered them again and same issue. Change your bread back please!
2018-10-08,5,Very good sandwich and I am not a Cheese Steak guy. Enjoyed every bite and I plan on bringing the family back to enjoy a Cheese Steak and it's very reasonable priced.
2018-10-08,2,wasnt crazy about this placeservice was greatbathroom was cleanmeat was not crispy, it tasted and felt boiledthe buns were also very soft, but like they were steamnot my fav place
2018-10-02,5,I had mediocre expectations when ordering from this spot since I'm a Philadelphia native.. the chipotle cheesesteak on garlic bread was absolutely amazing. The delivery time was faster than anticipated and the delivery guy was very kind. Thank you guys!
2018-09-28,1,LISTEN TO THIS. I ordered on seamless and my food was about an hour late and at the 30 minute late mark I called the restaurant to inquire and the guy said quote "well guess what billion dollar companies don't write that the time is an approximate estimate" "anyway you'll get your food soon" SERIOUSLY?? the food wasn't even good enough to warrant such a nasty attitude
2018-09-06,4,Everything was delicious!! We ordered the California cheese steak and the lemon pepper fries. The cheese steak was tasty and very flavorful. The roll was the star of the sandwich. So fresh. The fries were crisp  (which is rare when you get take out fries). They kinda tastes like boardwalk fries. Would definitely recommend getting the lemon pepper. Delivery was fast and efficient. Will definitely order from here again.
2018-08-13,5,Great Cheesesteaks!!!! Amazing!!! And staff is great!!! Definitely recommend!! So many to choose from and the cooks are awesome!! Great spot to fill your appetite!!
2018-08-11,5,This is by far the best cheese steak I've had outside of Philadelphia. Absolutely must visit this place if you're ever craving meat deliciousness that only cheese steak can fill.
2018-08-11,1,Ordered delivery (4 sandwiches) at 1:30 pm and it is now 3:22 pm and still have not received my delivery. They have caller ID and now refuse to answer my call after telling me it was on its way for delivery at 2:45. Absolutely unacceptable.
2018-08-05,4,I got the Garlic Mozzarella Cheesesteak with extra cheese (that extra cheese really does make a difference). It was delicious!! The garlic really boosted the flavors and the bread was lightly toasted.As some other reviewers had recommended, I got the Lemon & Pepper Fries, which were crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. Perfection.The place is pretty small, but there were no other customers--most took their orders to-go.It was kinda humid inside, but they were cooking RIGHT there and it was hot outside, so I could understand. There was a small bug flying around, and it almost landed in my fries...If I'm back in town, I'll definitely come back and try their other Cheesesteaks, with bell peppers added on.
2018-08-03,4,I ordered here a few years ago when i lived in hoboken (ordered a cheesesteak and wings) and I was underwhelmed. More so because if delivery time than the food.I decided to give them a second go - went with a classic Cheesesteak with Wiz. It hit the spit made be think of some of the authentic Philadelphia spots I've been to. I forgot to get onions and peppers you have to mention that. I do wish the bread was toasted. Nonetheless great sandwich . They sell all type of cheesesteak variations and even Tasty Kakes. Feels like a little bit of Philly inside Hudson County.
2018-07-27,4,I was.out with a friend and we couldn't find anywhere to eat until we ran this spot. They were busy but not crazy. I ordered the regular philly cheese with fries and a snapple. The sandwich was good a little greasy but well made the bread was soft the beef cooked right and the fries were on point. I'd definitely would give this place another go
2018-07-21,5,This is our go-to place for a delicious meal in Hoboken. Cheese steaks are bomb, fries are great, and delivery is fast. Delivery guy tonight was the man as well.
2018-05-27,1,I placed an order for a cheesesteak, wings and a soda for delivery.  When I received my order there was no soda, but fries instead.  I called and they told me I ordered the fries and no soda.  The guy answering the phone was very rude, and basically didn't give a shit that the order was wrong.
2018-05-11,5,This place is a trusty go-to. Quick, affordable, and always on-point! The cheese steaks are great and the fries are amazing, too.
2018-04-03,4,Let me preface this review by saying I, myself, can make a pretty bomb Philly cheesesteak. Even my husband says mine are the best he's ever eaten (and he always SHOWS me the truth -- by refusing to eat something if he doesn't like it) so I know his stomach doesn't lie.These cheesesteaks from Midtown come pretty darn close to the ones I make. The portions are big -- I'm *almost* regretting that we didn't order one to split halfsies. ALMOST. A good portion of meat inside each one -- and as always, I order extra (American) cheese on mine. They serve white American here (I'm partial to yellow) -- but it definitely comes full of cheesy goodness when you fork over the 75 cents for extra. Most toppings cost extra, as do sauces, so pay attention to this if you're someone who likes a complicated cheesesteak. For me, traditional simplicity is best, with peppers and onions (at least the onions are free!) and the extra cheese. The rolls are soft and chewy and warm. Total yum. I've tried three kinds of their fries. Ranked, in order:1.) Lemon pepper (I honestly tried to eat each last seasoning crumb. SO GOOD. Tangy and sour. Perfect against the crispy saltiness of the fries. 2.) Regular--they have a tons of side dips to order -- about 75 cents each. I got the ranch and it was a fabulous combo. Their ranch is more vinegar tasting than others I've had and I loved it this way. 3.) Cajun. I'm normally a fan of Cajun fries, but these needed a little more kick. Great if you like your Cajun a bit mild. But the other two just blew these out of the water. I ordered the onion rings once ($5). I'd skip them. They were over cooked and I really didn't taste much onion flavor. So they were a bit burned tasting, too much crunch and not enough onion. I'd be slightly more upset about their $3 delivery charge (because who likes paying delivery charges ON TOP of tipping? Ugh. But the 2x I've ordered delivery from here, the food was on time and arrived piping hot.Kudos to the restaurant here for being smart enough to pack fries in paper bags instead of aluminum tins with plastic lids or god forbid those pesky styrofoam containers that leave them a wet pile of mush!!Overall, when I'm in a pinch and craving a cheesesteak, and don't feel like hauling to the grocery store and getting a bunch of ingredients to make them myself, I order from here. For two cheesesteaks and two orders of fries with tax, tip + delivery, expect to spend around $34.
2018-04-03,1,Absolutely horrible! We are regulars there and we accidentally gave them the wrong address honest mistake. The owner then calls me up and was very rude. He refused to deliver the food. He told me if i want my food i will have to go to him to get it. Safe to say i will never go back to the place ever! After all the business we gave him I'm am shocked. There are places in Hoboken with much better food!
2018-03-08,5,read a tip: best cheesesteak ever. When I realized she had read my mind. OMG the breads delicious, it's soft and chewy.  i got Philly cheesesteak American with extra wiz mushrooms peppers and onions. Would give u 6 stars. Delivery guy was patient too! Lol
2018-03-04,5,My family and i are visiting from California and Nevada; I've lived in SF, Portland, Reno, Fresno, and Sacramento, these are the best cheese steaks I've had hands down!
2018-02-26,4,Always a solid standby for lunch or dinner. A sandwich here with a side and you can't go wrong. You won't find the greatest sandwich of your life here, but for the price it is pretty good.
2018-02-18,5,Absolutely loved this place! Took my sister & her fiancé there to try their first Philly cheesesteak & they were blown away! The bread was so soft & it was honestly so worth the detour to the airport! Definitely be back soon!
2018-02-18,5,Consistently delicious! No need to go to Philly when this is so close. Meat is super tender and the bread is fantastic. Love this place, though have only done carry-out from here.
2018-02-06,1,The amount of times I've ordered for delivery and have not received multiple items is abysmal. The service in the store is just as bad. I understand they must deal with a bad crowd sometimes, but don't open up a business in Hoboken if you can't deal with it. When talking to the manager, he showed absolutely no care in the negative feedback of their customers. I'm a local here in Hoboken and will definitely be spreading the word to ensure customer service like theirs impacts their business. Stinks because the food is the perfect 'greasy fat food', just the customer service is absolutely horrible.
2018-02-02,5,Last night, I watched a dude try to get his money back for a sandwich he consumed....two weeks ago.........that's a real thing that happened. So honestly 5 stars for handling it professionally instead of choke slamming him, which is what I would've done.Also super delicious gotta love the California steak. O ya midtown philly 4 life.
2018-01-27,4,good fast food. if you want a quick delivery on a saturday night this is the spot. chipotle chicken streak is the best in my opinion.
2018-01-09,3,it is a three all the way though i like the ff.  the taste is fine, the roll is slightly unimpressive.  not a lot of meat.  no mustard.....breakdown and buy some mustard....It is not a philly cheesesteak, that is for sure......
2017-12-28,5,I frequent this place weekly and most times after a Saturday out, I find myself ordering here before I head home. I've never had any issues here, the food is always great, workers are extremely pleasant to be around, and are very helpful. Legit one of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had and I truly mean that ! As long as I'm in Hoboken, they will have me as a customer.
2017-12-26,4,A little on the pricy side for the portion size. The subs aren't that big but the combinations you can do here are endless and the staff are super friendly and we're willing to accommodate when my friend had food allergies. I've been 3 times now and have never been disappointed.
2017-12-20,5,Midtown Philly's California chicken hero has been my pregnancy craving. The bun is soft no matter what time of day you order. It's cheesy and delicious. I've had 3 this week. I also get the Cajun fries with light Cajun seasoning and they are yummm!! Delivery is usually pretty quick except when they're super busy. My husband gets the classic cheesesteak and thinks it needs more meat and some A1.
2017-12-17,5,Visited Union City for Christmas and these cats delivered me the goods at 3AM!! Philly steak and fries were bomb!! Must try.
2017-12-09,1,Ordered a chipotle chicken cheesesteak and a regular Philly cheesesteak. Received two beef cheese steaks. Extremely disappointed. Tasted terrible (when you're expecting chicken).
2017-11-17,4,I work as a pet sitter in the area so I end up having to order a lot of take out. Most places leave me feeling disappointed and like I wasted my money. This was one of the few restaurants that made me immediately save the number and call it again next time. It's not amazing but the sandwiches are good and fries very tasty too. I'll definitely order from them again and have recommended to the other sitters in the business.
2017-11-13,5,Hands down the best cheese steak in Hoboken. When I lived in Jersey City, my fiancé and I would order from here once a week (usually on the weekends at 2am afternoon night of drinking). We were in the area Friday night and decided after dinner to get some cheese steaks to go for lunch for the next day and they were perfect per usual, even when you re-heat it!! The Chipotle cheese steak is the best...The Cajun fries are also AMAZING!!!
2017-11-01,5,This is a great place to stop in for lunch. I mostly take the food to go.  They have a lot a specialty sandwiches. I like the Blackened Chicken.  Very good. But what should not be missed is the lemon pepper fries.  Never miss getting these with my order.
2017-10-28,2,This place has fantastic fries, but I wouldn't recommend anything else. They don't cook things thoroughly enough for my taste. I ordered hot wings and a cheese steak and both were just cooked to the point that they were safe to eat but they weren't edible. I like my wings crispy and these wings were pale (they barely put any buffalo sauce on them) and slimey. I specifically asked for the steak to be cooked a little longer and when the delivery arrived, the steak was barely medium-rare. I gagged. Never again. I would've given them one star but they threw in a free 20 oz Coke with my order.
2017-10-24,5,11$ and change...got me a nice Philly cheese steak, with mushrooms and onions...healthy serving of a side of lemon pepper fries ...thank you for noticing my notes for my pick up order! Lol I was super hungry ...well worth it, food is delicious and amazing
2017-10-10,3,Great if it's 2 AM and you're drunk. Hey nothing wrong with that. Not too sure I would order here if I was sober.
2017-09-29,4,Ordered for delivery and the food was great.. except for the fact that it was pretty much cold. Took about an hour and a half for delivery which I think is a bit too long for two cheese steaks. I will still give four stars though because even though it took a while and the food wasn't hot, it still tasted great. Definitely will order again, just hope the delivery won't take as long next time!
2017-09-23,2,It was ok.  2 star service and 2 star food.  Had the cheesesteak with mushrooms which apparently means 1-2 mushrooms only.  Cheese was a little scarce.  It was much better when I added hot sauce and buffalo. I gave it more flavor. We also tried the Buffalo chicken sandwich. All of it was to go.I wasn't a real fan of the guy at the register. I have a thing about people putting money on the table far away from the person gave it to them. He also had a really dismissive attitude that I could've done without.
2017-09-15,1,Used to be a devoted customer but NO MORE.  Called in an order for pickup and arrived on time.  Was told they sent it out for delivery and he was coming back to bring me my order.  The driver came into the store and proceeded to angrily tell me he was waiting a long time and calling my cell phone over and over (phone was in my bag and I was currently talking to the cashier).  He said he was waiting a long time but his first call happened while I was in store and there was maybe a 6 minute window of time that had passed until my food came back.  I don't appreciate being yelled at for your mistake when I was apologetic AND TIPPED.  Horrible customer service.
2017-09-02,5,I ordered from here around 2:50pm for lunch today at work in the JC Heights area. I ordered the diablo cheesesteak without ranch but asked for blue cheese instead. I almost immediately got my confirmation after putting in my order saying I should have my food by 3:40. I got my food by 3:20pm and was finished eating by the time they said I should have my food in the confirmation.The cheesesteak was still hot and was delicious when it got to me. It's a cheesesteak sandwich, so of course ordering it for delivery, getting a messy sandwich shouldn't be surprising, but I would definitely recommend asking for extra napkins if you're not eating somewhere that has them already. Other than that, this was a perfect lunch, and the delivery speed all the way into Jersey City was extremely impressive, and that's coming from someone who is a delivery driver in his spare time. If your really hungry and need food quickly, this is the place to call! Will definitely be ordering again!
2017-08-25,5,The staff here are SO efficient, I hope they know how appreciated it is (especially after dealing with some other businesses in Hoboken...). The second they pick up the phone they already have my address pulled in the system and are on fire with taking my order.Delivery is nice and speedy and the guys are always super nice. The food is of course delish, but the awesome service keeps me coming back again and again. I love supporting a business like this. Thank you guys for keeping it real!!
2017-07-28,5,This place has the most delicious garlic cheese steak and their Cajun fries are literally to die for.
2017-07-28,5,I'm literally addicted to their chipotle cheesesteak! It's soooo good. Also, the lemon pepper fries and jalapeño poppers are a must try! They're always really quick on delivery and you can't beat their prices. It's my go to place for a fast food cheat meal :)
2017-06-30,5,I Love this place. The BBQ Cheesestake is absolutely delicious. You can add whatever toppings you would like to it. The fries are always crispy and fresh ! This is definitely my go to place whenever I am craving a  Cheesestake .
2017-06-27,1,Worst cheese steak ever!! First,  they are stingy with the the toppings (which you pay extra for on top of your sandwich). I asked for extra toppings, but barely got any of them lol. Don't know why people gave good reviews, the taste of the sandwich was so bland.
2017-06-09,5,I got the diablo. Amazing. Couldn't even finish it. Awesome crispy fries. They happily boxed up the last of my sub. Made a great lunch. Generous portions. Nice outdoor seating. Awesome!
2017-06-04,4,Two words: Onion rings. Beer-battered, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, made with REAL onions delicious goodness. Their signature cheesesteak is made with a soft hoagie roll which melts in your mouth as you take your first bite, and their meat-to-bun ratio is perfect. My one consideration is that the meat can dry out quickly, and your cheesesteak can be bland depending on the type of cheese and the additional condiments you select (which can become pricey). Because of these reasons, I give Midtown Philly Steaks a 4/5 stars.
2017-06-04,4,Ordered the chipotle cheesesteak, Philly cheesesteak, onion rings, and Cajun fries. Cajun fries had the right amount of spice. Onion rings were not super oily and every crunch was amazing. Chipotle mayo was delicious and Philly cheesesteak was very good. Only thing I have to say is I wish they included more cheese! Felt like flavor was there but the cheese just wasn't enough.
2017-04-09,2,Average sandwiches nothing special about their cheesesteaks. The meat seemed low quality and could never compare to a Philly cheesesteak.
2017-04-04,5,Been going there for about a year now and the food is always great. I live on the campus nearby so I always drop by for a cheesesteak or their lemon pepper fries. The fact that they stay open late is also a plus.
2017-03-23,1,Ordered my food an hour and a half ago and it's still not here....no way it can be good enough to make up for that. 15 mins ago I was told the driver was 3 minutes away. Is it ever coming???
2017-03-08,5,Just relocated to North Jersey from the Philadelphia area. I can proudly say, these Philly Cheesesteaks are as close to Philly as it comes!
2017-03-06,1,Ordered here twice, first one was a good experience, decent food. Second one was horrible, wrong order and it was delayed by an hour. The sub was cold AF. Sorry 1 star for overall experience. Especially not hearing from the manager after complaining about what happened.
2017-02-23,5,This place has delicious cheesesteak it's not heavy not greasy just right ! Their Cajun fries are also very good. If you're looking for good cheesesteak that's not going to have you feeling like you just injested tons of grease this is the place ! Very good
2017-02-07,4,I would give this spot a 3.5-4 .. for Hoboken it's probably the best CheeseSteak (unless you go to Del Frisco's Grill for their Cheesesteak Rolls).. I mean it's not a trip to Philly but I've ordered several times and have never been disappointed. Solid.
2017-01-29,5,Amazing. best cheesesteak i've had outside of philadelphia. I am so in love. the staff was very kind and patient. I loved the fact that they let you watch them prepare the sandwiches. I would come back here everyday if i didn't live 30 mins away!
2017-01-15,5,This place is the most consistent food in Hoboken .. the quality of the steak is comparable to any establishment in the philly area .. the mozzarella sticks are also a favorite of mine .
2017-01-06,5,I just ate Pat's and Geno's in Philly and I have to say all the hype is for nothing. I had midtown Philly cheesesteak last month and it had 100x better than these 2 "well-renowned" places. You have to check this place out, the garlic cheesesteak in particular was perfection
2016-12-10,3,When I went there I had gotten the Chipotle Cheesesteak. The sauce was pretty good, there was a lot of it though so it definitely got a bit messy. The sandwich was average all in all. If you are craving a cheesesteak or looking for something decent to get, this place definitely will satisfy you, its just not something that you'd probably go out of the way for.I can tell one thing though, after some late night drinks this food would probably be AMAZING.
2016-11-29,5,Pretty awesome sandwiches and their fries are to die for. Would recommend it any day of the week.
2016-11-16,5,I love the Blackened Chicken Sandwich with Cajun Seasoning added on.
2016-11-02,4,I ordered from Midtown Philly after a late night out because I was craving a philly and it was one of the only places open at that hour, which served one. I ordered a chipotle philly and to meet my minimum, I opted for a side of cajun fries. I don't know if the quality has gone up since the last time I ordered, or if not a lot of people order at that time so they just put in more effort, but I really enjoyed it! I especially loved the Cajun fries because even after 30 minutes + of delivery time, they were still hot and crispy, which is pretty impressive. I might need to pop in for an actual visit next time. This way, it'll taste even better, and I won't have pay that pesky little $3 delivery fee,
2016-10-31,1,Ordered through Seamless, order was estimated to arrive an hour later. About an hour and 15 minutes later, I started calling to follow up. There was no answer, I tried about 5 times. After 2 hours I got a call from seamless that mid town philly steaks was too busy to deliver my order and that it was cancelled with a refund.  Would not have been an issue if they had told me up front but very very bad form given that they waited 2 hours to tell me they weren't coming while I had hungry guests waiting. Will never order from them again.
2016-10-13,4,I consider myself a cheesesteak aficionado so my opinion should be held in high regard. First off, I ordered delivery through yelp to my JC apartment in the heights. The estimated time was 45-60 minutes. Luckily, for my grumbling tummy, the doorbell rang within a half hour. I ran down the stairs to find a smiling gentleman with a bag that smelled glorious. When I got back upstairs, I literally ripped the bag wide open to find a torpedo of deliciousness awaiting. Meaty, cheesy, and hot, the California cheesesteak I ordered was beyond delightful, as were the crispy and spicy Cajun fries. I will most definitely be ordering from here a ton now that I'm aware of the splendor that exists within their four walls. FYI: $10 minimum on deliveries and a $3 delivery fee
2016-09-28,2,Hard to screw up philly cheese steak as take salted meat with high fat content and combine with cheese on any sort of roll.  Oddly could not get onions and peppers were extra.   Sandwich a bit light on cheese as had to check if had any.   Fries were good and quantity of food between hoagie and fries enough for two. If want cheese steak will go to shorties in Manhattan
2016-08-09,5,Best cheesesteak ever I had in my life. Juice meat and soft bread. Way better than Philly's famous places(pat's & Geno's)
2016-07-21,1,The steak was not very flavorful and didn't taste fresh. I took a bite and left it.  I would stay away if you want a good sandwich. Instead come here only if you are drunk.
2016-07-17,3,This place does the job for hangover munchies but nothing to write home about. We got the cheese steak, jalapeño poppers, fries, and chicken wings none of which was anything special. The cheese steak was ok not enough cheese and not seasoned (if it was it didn't taste like it), jalapeño poppers had a weird sauce and were ok, the FF were very very soggy not crispy like the other reviews states, and the wings were ok. When I called they didn't say the name of the shop just "hello!" not very friendly at all and took about 45 minutes. I would order from them again but only for an after hangover grease and cheese fix and would def ask for extra cheese on the cheese steak but nothing to brag about just very mediocre.
2016-07-07,3,I grew up in Philadelphia and tend to be pretty picky about any cheesesteaks outside of Philly, but this is one of the good ones!I have never eaten in the establishment, but have ordered steaks from seamless a few times.  It is a fine sandwich with pretty good bread. The highlight of the meal for me is the French fries - they are great! Overall, not incredible, but if you are going to get a "philly" cheesesteak in northern Jersey then this is not a bad spot!
2016-07-02,5,Always my "go to" cheat meal and theyre especially fast! Ordering from another establishment in JC (where I live) almost always takes longer. The lemon pepper fries are a must!!!
2016-06-30,4,Have the whiz, it was great. I mean it's  not Philly, but the sandwich was good and hot. Bread is good.  We split one sandwich and fries and were full for our trip to NYC.
2016-06-20,5,Ironically this review is for the wings and not the philly steaks. Wings were phenomenal! I was skeptical at first since they don't seem to specialize in wings the way other restaurants do but I would definitely go back for those wings!
2016-06-17,4,This place is legit. We had a Philly cheese steak, a steak eggroll and a buffalo chicken sandwich and of course the Cajun fries which were ,in my opinion,  the best fries I've ever eaten. The Philly cheese steak was ok lacked some flavor. the Buffalo chicken sandwich was really good and full of flavor. But overall the Cajun fries are a must!! Awesome cause they deliver
2016-06-10,3,I give the food a 3 and hygiene a 1... I observed a worker slicing and placing bread loaves into a box on the floor with out gloves after being at the cash register. Yikes!! I had already paid for my food but had i seen this beforehand, out the door i would have went.
2016-06-03,3,Unoffensive is perhaps the best word to describe this establishment. I ordered the regular cheesesteak with onions and jalapenos. The cheesesteak itself doesn't come with grilled onions and add-ons such as onions require 50 cents extra per topping. Lets start with the cheesesteak. The cheesesteak is a good sandwich. Its not a great sandwich.  The bun is so soft, exactly what you want. The steak itself isn't too flavorful. Really, what you will be tasting most is the cheese. The cheese is nice and smooth. Still, nothing to write home about. This sort of uniform taste is interrupted here and there by the relatively flavorful jalapenos and  onions and I wish there were more of them in the sandwich. It wasn't a bad sandwich, and I'd eat it again, but at about $8 a sandwich it isn't very appetizing.The fries aren't very great. They smell AMAZING. But thats mainly due to the seasoning. They're crunchy. Thats good. But the taste isn't there. These are very clearly store bought fries and some spices were added on top. They weren't great at all.
2016-05-28,4,I've always wanted to try this place! It was late last night and I was CRAVING a cheesesteak. I ordered a cheesesteak with wiz, no onions and a side of cajun fries for delivery. After 15 minutes I gave the restaurant a call to make sure the order went through and I was told it was already on its way...great! However, 20 minutes later it still hadn't arrived. After 40 minutes of waiting total I got a call and the food had arrived! I was surprised the cheesesteak wasn't soggy. The bread was soft but not disintegrated. The fries were DELICIOUS and made the 40 minute wait 100% worth it. I don't think I would ever order for delivery again but I would definitely stop by the brick and mortar store!
2016-05-14,2,Ordered cheesesteak,chicken cheesesteak, fries and wings. Fries were very good and crispy. We enjoyed the wings. Chicken cheesesteak was horrible! Low quality chicken with no flavor! Cheesesteak was fine.
2016-05-08,5,the Philly cheesesteak is delicious!I got my order delivered to my door 15 minutes after I placed it.  Person showed up with a smile.  Thank you!
2016-05-02,4,Local Hoboken spot for a great cheesesteak!  Late night munchies or lunch/dinner.  Also, they make great fries.  Really crispy.
2016-04-15,1,I ordered a philly steak & sweet potato fries for delivery via Yelp. I normally don't like philly steaks but thought the cherry peppers and grilled pineapple sounded good so I got that. The delivery took 1 hr. I sat down to finally eat, but no cherry peppers & just small unripened pineapple pieces not even cooked. Next, the sweet potato fries were all soggy and gross. I figured ordering fries for delivery in the first place was my fault. But I was not happy about the philly steak so I called. They put me on hold. I called again. They put me on hold. I called with a different phone. They finally answered. They said they'd send a new one. I waited 45mins as they told me. I called back. They said "it was on the way". I called again after tired of waiting more. They said "there were other orders but it was on the way". I finally got my food well after 2 hours or so, very late at night. I did not even end up eating it. They probably spit in it anyway. They're just VERYYYY RUDE people there! TOTALLY RUINED MY PHILLY STEAK EXPERIENCE AND MY NIGHT!
2016-03-30,5,Went to lunch with my friend here today and t was my first time here. The cheese steak are bomb. So good juicy and cheesy! I esp love the bread it goes on. Heard this place is open late so good drunk food!
2016-03-30,5,If you're looking for a delicious cheesesteak but you don't have time to drive to Philly to grab one, this is definitely the place to go!! AND If you love chipotle like I do, the chipotle cheesesteak is SCRUMPTIOUS!!!
2016-03-17,3,I had the "regular" Philly Cheesesteak with provolone and onions. It was ready fast and decently sized. I thought the meat was underseasoned and there wasn't as much cheese as I am used to, but it was overall good (after salt). I'd probably be back, but maybe get one of the sandwiches with more exciting toppings.
2016-02-27,5,Perfect tasting food with friendly and fast service. Best value for your money. Try it and you will love it. I'm going back there again for sure
2016-02-08,5,I enjoy this place, the workers, and the food. I can never get enough of their cheese steaks. The fries are amazing. I can never get enough of them!
2016-02-07,5,Delicious chipotle mayo chessesteak sandwich with a side of Cajun fries and chesse whiz .. Cool people.. Satisfying customer service..absolutely recommend!!
2016-02-07,1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! I was having a Super Bowl party and called at 4PM for a 7PM delivery. Placed an order and they called at 6:35PM saying they ran out of wings. They didn't make up for it in anyway and it was too late to place another order for my party. Terrible customer service and no process to ensure orders are met. I will never order from here again and neither should you!!!!!
2016-02-02,3,We wanted some cheesesteaks for dinner at the station and one of the guys suggested this place so we decided to give it a try. The cheesesteaks were delicious and well made; the fries on the other hand left something to be desired. The only downside to the sandwiches were that they were on the smaller side for being charged $10+ each.
2016-01-20,4,Small spot on the main drag of Hoboken that is serving up some seriously good cheesesteaks. They have a bunch of different ones that are varying degrees of awesome. My buddy got the plain cheesesteak which was reminiscent of a late night cheesesteak in downtown philly... Good quality steak, crusty bread, and that oniony flavor that screams "Yo gimme one wit wiz!".I had the Volcano cheesesteak which was all kinds of awesome. I'm a fan of spicy food and this hit the spot! Cherry peppers, siracha, hot relish.... YES PLEASE! Shout out to the Cajun fries that were also great.. Overall, great spot.
2016-01-18,4,As I imagine many people have stated, I'm always skeptical when places state "Philly Cheesesteak". And in this case, as usual, the cheesesteaks really don't remind me of a Philly Cheesesteak. However, they are goddamn good cheesesteaks. The Diablo is amazing and is the perfect combination of meat, cheese, and spicy. I would recommend to anyone who was looking for a sloppy, guilty-pleasure food, or as in my case, an amazing drunk meal after a weekend night.The only reason I did not give a five star is because of the price being a little expensive. Besides that I'm yet to see an issue with the place.
2016-01-07,1,Not even worth a star. I ordered from this place because my friends raved how good it was. The first time I ordered my food was over an hour late.I figured I would give it another shot the second time around. WRONG! The food was over an hour late again. I called to inquire about the status of my food and was rudely told "sorry we are really busy!" Unacceptable! Aren't most delivery places busy?! And wrong answer to give to a customer! Customers always come first. Sorry. Never will order here again.
2016-01-05,5,Midtown Philly is a constant favorite for when in Hoboken. Growing up in Philadelphia I was very skeptical of any place that makes a claim to "Philly" when talking cheesesteaks, however this place lives up to the name. They even have TastyCakes!!Great for a lazy Sunday Dinner, or a Saturday lunch order. Any of the cheesesteaks are great, but you have to get the Cheesesteak EggRoll. It sounds weird, but it is my favorite thing on the menu! Definitely work it. Lemon and Pepper Fries come highly recommended too. Solid Hoboken Spot for quick and reliable delivery.
2016-01-05,4,Love this place mainly after partying down the block until 2am at the bars. Love the cheese steaks it's fast service and the workers are so nice ! Mainly dealing with drunks so late at night on a Saturday night this location is definitely a must try.
2016-01-04,4,Always a quality cheesesteak.  No offense to everyone in philly but the cheesesteaks I have had in philly have been averageeeeee.  This place could stand up to any of them.  There is an art to making a good cheesesteak, and they nailed it at midtown philly steaks.
2015-12-14,5,I've had this place deliver dinner to downtown Jersey City 5 times now and every experience has been positive. Only once was the order taking longer than usual but the staff was able to answer our questions and ensure delivery. I was using grub hub for ordering but it started to list downtown JC as outside the delivery area recently. Since then, I've either called in the order or used Yelp. I always get the chicken cheesesteak with my usual toppings and my husband loves the diablo cheesesteak. We also always share an order of regular fries. The food has always come hot, fresh, not soggy and in the case of the fries - super crispy. I have no idea how they do it but I love them for it. I'm waiting on tonight's delivery as I type this. Woohoo!
2015-11-23,5,Best cheesesteaks. Have never been to the actual location but order this using seamless often. The cheesesteaks are amazing and even better than most I have had in Philly. Sometimes delivery is kind of long but this is a 5 star cheesesteak. The fries are really good too. Good for ordering out.
2015-11-23,4,Delicious, lots of interesting cheesesteaks to choose from. Skimpy on the cheese tho. More expensive than it should be.
2015-11-01,5,Best fries for delivery in Hoboken! Quickest delivery and the food is always so fresh. 5 stars!!!
2015-10-29,5,Best Philly cheesesteak in Hoboken ! I've even had their wraps before which Are very fresh and tasty!
2015-10-15,5,I love Midtown Philly Steaks!!! Great service, great food, and always a welcome greeting by the staff when I walk in. They even stay open late for those late night cravings. I highly recommend this take-out spot!My only wish is that they add: Shrimp Steak Subs to their menu, because I can buy that delicious sub in both Philly and Maryland :-)
2015-10-12,5,Hands down the best the cheesesteak in the tri-state area ! This is my 5th time to Midtown Philly in 2 weeks and I just can't get enough. I always get the garlic muttz with onion and peppers and some chipotle mayo on top. Good job guys keep it coming.
2015-10-06,5,There is noting like a cheesesteak str8t out of Philly but until we meet again, Midtown gets the job done RIGHT!!. The manager told me he was going to make sure my food was made the way I requested it because of previous errors with orders, and by god the man lied. IT WAS BY FAR BETTER than the way I ordered it. Yummy!!!!! The sandwich was irresistible. I was actually contemplating the last bite bc I knew it was over afterwards. The cajun fries are absolutely delicious and they will never steer you wrong. The poppers are a must every time I order. The customer service is friendly and whenever I have had an issue, they note it in their account and compliment me on the next order.  Philly is not only part of the name but part of the game as well, hands down you'll get a 5 from this very happy Baby ; )
2015-09-24,5,Just had an indulgence....a cheesesteak with whiz. Let me tell you, I am from Philly and am particular about my cheesesteaks having grown up with the best. This one was delivered quickly, it was fresh and delicious and even my cat enjoyed a taste. :) The temperature was perfect, the steak was plentiful and flavorful and the whiz made it perfect. The bread was very fresh and delicious with a good ratio of carbs to steak. Add a little ketchup and it's one of the best things in town and really hits the spot when you are craving a cheesesteak. Excellent value.  I am almost unhappy to learn this all as I am struggling to eat healthier and this is so delicious and tasty and well priced...I will need to put a monthly quota on my cheesesteaks!
2015-09-23,4,Love their cheesesteaks. Love. I always get the Tavern, which is a cheesesteak with some slices grilled ham thrown on. Always with whiz. It's just a delicious messy sandwich that leaves you licking your fingers afterwards.Only 2 slight complaints: the bread could be fresher, better.  But either way, I am inhaling my cheesesteak!  And 2nd, they charge a $3 delivery fee. They always deliver quickly though.
2015-09-13,5,Good steaks, Cajun fries are great. Clean, modern dining room. delivery is great.
2015-09-07,2,This is the first time I had a (chicken) cheesesteak without peppers and onions. I thought that's an automatic addition, but apparently I was wrong.  The American cheese they used was white... When I prefer yellow. A big disappointment. On a positive, the Cajun fries are delicious.
2015-08-30,2,This place is so overrated. We went here due to 4 star review of over 100 yelp reviews. We thought it was going to be very good. Let's start with the bread...it's such cheap bread i can't say no more. Then the meat looks like chili meat. Cajun fries were so salty we needed to refill our drinks 3x just to recover. Wendy's have better chili cheese fries than they have. I wouldn't go here again. You're better off getting philly cheese steak from your favorite pizza place for less $$
2015-08-22,1,A few months ago I wrote a bad review of this food venue. The cheesesteak was cold, the wings were soggy and undercooked and the fries were just inedible.  After posting a review on Yelp, the owner called me and seemed sincerely concerned about the deteriorating quality of the food being served. He blamed the undercooked/lack of crispiness of the wings on bad chicken.   the sogginess of the fries on poor potatoes.  He was concerned enough about my poor review that he offered me a free meal, provided I call the restaurant directly instead of going through grubhub.  I appreciated his concern and offer.  However, I was not yetready  to give him another try.   Today I was and instead of calling him directly I again ordered though Grubhub.  And the food was even worse  than it was several months ago.  The wings still lacked crispness, the fries were soggy and, cardinal sin to a person from south jersey/philly,....the cheesesteak was full of gristle.   So much so that it was inedible, as were the wings.  I called the restaurant to complain and was told by the owner that he cooked the meal himself and thought it was good.  Obviously our esthetics differ.  Having lived in this area for over 20 years, I was previously thrilled to find a place that actually made a decent cheese steak and had ordered from this place frequently.  No more.  They've gone down-hill and have no consideration for customer feedback.  If needed, I have pictures of the practically raw chicken wings and gristle from the cheese steak.
2015-08-18,2,Mediocre at best.  Beef is low grade, roll is lame, only thing that made it edible was real kraft cheese wiz. Wouldn't go back unless I was bombed after a late bar night
2015-08-07,4,I mightve gotten spoiled with DiNics in South Jersey and Jims on South Street, Philly. But the cheesesteak from this place is not bad at all. Probably the best chesesteak up here. Plus the people here are nice, not like the pricks at Pats in Philly.Will be back. I won't forget about going Whiz Wit next time lol.
2015-08-05,4,Not bad for a traditional Philly cheese steak. Just came in for lunch while walking on the strip. Got a barbecue cheesesteak. It was a nice size, very filling. Flavor wise, it was excellent. Just the right amount of onions, peppers and cheese. The barbecue complemented the sandwich perfectly.I also tried my father's onion rings. They were good with the horseradish sauce it came with. The only drawback I had is that they don't allow you to get a free cup of water if you don't want pop. Maybe that's only customary in Chicago.
2015-07-30,5,This is a constant stop for me when I want some great quick food. The cheese stakes are great, my favorites are the chipoltle and the buffalo chicken.Other than that the lemon pepper fries are great and the wings are better than most bars in Hoboken.
2015-07-28,5,I lived in Philly for 4 years so I can say that these guys are legit.They deliver quick and easy (no delivery charge!) and their cheese fries are amazing!!
2015-06-28,5,Love this place! Usually order delivery and they're always come in a timely manner. Good thing is that they're also open and deliver late, so clutch. Their cheesesteaks are pretty good, usually get the Hawaiian or the one with garlic bread. I'll be honest that I can't say it's the absolute best cheesesteak I've had in my life but the best I've had around the JC/Hoboken area. But my and my girl always always get the cheesesteak egg rolls from here and one will fill you up real good. Fries on the side are not too crispy and just right. This place has been a source of late night happiness especially after a night of drinking. Can't say anything about the actual place cause I never been or seen it but the food has consistently been great for me. Overall honest rating is 4.8 out of 5 stars.
2015-06-27,3,Ordered philly cheese steak with provelone, grilled onions and mushrooms. Given this place has a 4 star avg review, thought i should mention that although the meat and toppings were very good, the bread was way below my expectations. It was fresh, but it reminded me of Wonderbread or a large hot dog bun.  I am open to changing my review to 4 stars if they procure high quality french bread from a local bakery - that is the missing link to their operation.High quality bread people, thats all you have to do!!!Still good if you are in the mood for a cheesesteak.
2015-06-13,3,I used to love this place and so encouraged my roommate to try it. We ordered the Philly Cheesestake with extra cheese, the Cheese Stake Egg Roll and Cajun Fries. The Egg Roll and Cajun Fries were really good.Their signature dish,  the one that their restaurant is named after turned out be so super salty that it was almost unedible. Couldn't even finish half of it.I called up the place to let them know about my experience because I used to really like this place. They ended up telling me that they never add salt to their meat or even marinate it, so it must be due to the extra cheese option that I had selected.Well, if the sandwich turns out so horrible tasting just with the extra cheese, why do they even have that option on the menu??Let down with the place and more so because I had spoken highly about it to my roommate and she hated her sandwich, didn't eat more than a bite. :(Sucks!
2015-06-12,5,Good onion rings. Great steak subs. Everything fresh. Ordered from there and ate at the place.
2015-05-24,4,Best Philly in Hoboken! The diablo steak is my favorite, not a fan of the chicken philly's here, but not for any particular reason, just like the steaks better. They give you a TON of fries, and they're great too!
2015-05-19,4,Y'know, I still have yet to step into its brick and mortar establishment -- HOWEVER, I would like to say that their Philly Cheesesteaks that I have gotten on delivery is still very, very good! So, if you are tied up at working from home that day and cannot get away for lunch, just log on to your favorite food delivery service and choose them! You will not go wrong!
2015-05-18,5,This place is awesome. The best cheesesteaks in the area hands down. If you want a meaty steak sandwich ask for double meat. The regular ones are kinda light. The fries are amazing, the onion rings are out of this world. And for you people who complain about delivery.. Do you know long it takes to drive 3 blocks in Hoboken?? Give them a break!
2015-05-05,3,Solid spot to satisfy grease cravings. Go-to is the Chipotle cheesesteak (Spicy mayo) with either cajun or lemon pepper fries. Ask for grilled onions and cheese since they're both free other toppings are good but cost extra. Sometimes they will put whatever cheese they feel like on your cheesesteak so be warned about that. Also recently they started putting a lot less seasoning on the fries, making them almost tasteless. So if you're like me and want banging flavor even if it means health problems, ask for extra seasoning on your fries.Take a lot of napkins or be otherwise ready for messy eating, since the wrapping on the cheesesteak typically makes the entire sandwich soaked in oil. And finally the staff is pretty friendly and the service is quick.
2015-05-04,4,Good grub, fast service, good selection for a cheesteak place.  Chipotle one is amazing, and the "Diablo" is really good too if you like spicy.  I wouldn't make a night of it, as the ambiance is lacking and it is more like a fast food spot than a restaurant, but that's how it should be.  definitely worth a try, wit wiz!
2015-05-01,3,I've ordered from here a few times now. This place is good all-around. However, there is one glaring deficiency that brings Midtown Philly Steaks from a 5 to a 3. It's their Cheese Steaks. They are incredibly generic. I suppose I'd be happy if I got them from some corner deli, but this place specializes in cheese steaks. How are their cheese steaks not next-level good?
2015-04-22,3,Being from near Philly, I'm not totally impressed with these cheesesteaks. I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could, though. The cheesesteaks are good, not great  - they definitely are better than a lot around here but nothing like the authentic ones a couple of hours away) and they've got a lot of options to choose from. The ambience is nothing to write home about but what cheesesteak place is?
2015-04-19,3,Icy reception on entering the shop on a Sunday afternoon. Clean with nice outdoor seating in the sun. The California Cheesesteak, regular cheesesteak, and Garlic Mozzarella cheesesteak were average cheesesteaks. The bread was not particularly outstanding. There was ample meat and it was nice cut up.
2015-04-18,4,Finally!!!!  Finally found a cheesesteak that we loved without driving to Philly!  If you know me you know I've been on a long journey to find a good cheesesteak in the area and Mid-Towns is where it's at.  Their garlic cheesesteak is really tasty and fries were good too.  I'm not saying you can compare them to my fave Steve's Prince of steak but they are definitely making some good cheesesteaks here!!! Area is awesome too lots of cool spots in the neighborhood.
2015-04-17,5,Great faster delivery option restaurant. The philly wraps are not to much and the seasoned fries are really Amazing. The delivery is fast and always have our order right!
2015-04-08,5,This is an update to my 1 star review left in February.The owner of Midtown Philly Steaks saw my review and contacted me personally to apologize for the negative experience and to explain that there was an instance of family emergency and in the owner's absence, the night was rough for his staff. In an effort to change my perception of their cheesesteaks, the owner offered me a free steak for my next order and encouraged me to give Midtown Philly Steaks a second chance.The delivery was prompt and therefore the cheesesteak was hot and delicious. I can appreciate a business owner who is willing to admit mistakes and remedy a bad experience. The only criticism I still have is that in his absence, I'd hope that in the future there will be a plan for restaurant operations if he cannot be present on a peak night.
2015-03-26,3,I elected to go with the Barbecue Cheesesteak, and it was a great choice.  The delivery was very fast.  The menu has a good variety of cheessteaks to choose from, so depending on your mood you can find something that fits your mood.  If you are trying to avoid the bread, they'll even put it over lettuce and tomato for you.I'm going to have to come back and give the traditional cheesesteak a chance so I can judge this place for it's staple.
2015-03-08,3,Cheesteaks aren't bad, glad they have whiz but DO NOT order delivery, took almost 2 hours and of course was somewhat cold by the time it got here. I imagine if you get it there it is much better. Just had to stick them in the oven when they got here and it was pretty good. Not near philly good but good for jersey. Girlfriend got buffalo chicken and in my opinion I would just stick the the basics. If they improved their delivery I would order again but since that isn't the case, it is probably my last.
2015-02-25,3,When I think of cheese steak, I imagine good quality meat with delicious cheese and other toppings to fill up the hunk of a sandwich up. I have to say I really hate the bread and the cheese they use. Bread doesn't taste great and needs to be hollowed out because the portion of meat and bread was far off. Now the cheese they use is poor quality, it kept getting stuck in my teeth and on top of the roof of my mouth, which got very annoying after a few bites. It even hardened up half way while eating it, yuk!  Other than those two negatives, the meat and the fresh veggies all taste great together, making it a descent sandwich to satisfy the craving.The fries here are absolutely delicious!!! They are so crispy, piping-hot and full of goodness. Its ashame they arrived halfway into my meal, but they are worth the wait. For a California cheese steak, small fries and drink cost $14 ish, which I think is a tad pricey, it does get the job done.
2015-02-25,4,deliciousness with carbs + cheese + steak!!! Oh and the jalapeno poppers-- excellent, filled with cheese whiz. I would not have it any other way.
2015-02-19,5,LOVE!! I love both the food and service at Midtown Philly Steaks.  Everyone is so friendly and welcoming!  I am that type of person that has to change and substitute something and they are extremely accommodating and makes whatever I want perfectly!  They are open real late on the weekends so if you need a late night snack Midtown Philly Steaks is the best place to go!  And they deliver!!!
2015-02-13,3,Clean store. Friendly staff. I went with traditional cheese steak with Whiz. The bread was great and the steak was ok. Compared to Philly steaks, ie Pat's, Geno's, Jim's, it was average. For North Jersey it was great. Got the fries which were nothingspecial.
2015-02-12,5,Update: I now live on the other side of the country and miss these steaks every day. I know we discussed it before I left, but will you really ship me steaks to LA? If so I will place an order today.
2015-02-07,5,I don't know if it's because I always order this when tipsy, but it is literally the most perfect drunk food you will ever have. Chipotle cheese steak with extra cheese (white American), and grilled onions. Perfection. It's the best cheesesteak I've ever had.
2015-02-05,5,Background - I live a few blocks from this place, so its a regular joint for my roommate and I to grab dinner at, order on seamless, or bring out of town guests to after a night of drinking.Experience - This is usually a takeout meal for me. Delivery is usually quick (I live pretty close) and the food keeps its integrity - doesn't get soggy or fall apart etc. Eating in is a good experience though too. The staff is pretty friendly and the food comes out quickly. During the summer there is seating outside on Washington St. which is nice. If you go there after hours on the weekends, prepare to run into some drunk  20-somethings. Never had a bad experience, but it can be loud. Kinda small inside. A few tables and some stools up against the window.The Food - Best cheesesteak this side of the Hudson, north of Philly. BUT. And that is a big but - their specialty cheesesteaks are what shine. The Chipotle cheesesteak and the buffalo chicken cheesesteak top the lists for me. The chipotle sauce is so unbelievably on point. I wouldn't want to know the calorie count, but boy is it delicious. The buffalo sauce on the buffalo chicken is not overbearing and is accented with just the right amount of blue cheese sauce. The side dishes can be ignored for the most part, unless you're getting the chili-cheese fries.Bottom Line - It's awesome to have this place in town. Quick, easy, delicious... but not the healthiest thing of course. Major points for 4AM cheesesteak and chili-cheese fries delivered to my drunk face. My recommendation: Chipotle Cheesesteak, Double Meat, Double Cheese, American & Whiz, Onions. You will not be disappointed.
2015-01-19,4,After making a mistake on my order yesterday the owner called me personally to apologize and fix the situation, insisting that he would buy me dinner next time.  Very much appreciated and will make me continue to be their customer.
2015-01-13,5,One of the best places to grab something to eat when you're not counting calories, especially late night. Make sure to order the fries, they might be the best I have ever had.
2015-01-03,5,Was craving cheesesteaks one day and tried it out. It hit the spot, no complaints! The service wasn't too slow either.
2014-12-20,5,Seriously. Ordered my cheesesteak and fries at 12:22am and received perfectly at 1237am. Incredible! It tasted amazing and the fact that this place was so quick makes me want to order again and again! Bravo guys!!!!
2014-12-19,5,This is the only place I've ever found that consistently delivers crispy fries. It's unreal. Cheesesteaks are great too.
2014-12-15,5,Consistently one of the best fast food options in Hoboken, especially late night. Delivery is fast and reliable, prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Chipotle cheesesteak with cherry peppers is phenomenal, as is the Diablo. Solid choice if you live in the area!
2014-12-03,2,We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday, it was a so-so experience.Decor: It is a smaller place, with just a few tables, mainly seems to cater to carry-out or delivery orders. It's clean and... and... that's it. There really is not anything else to tell.Bathroom: There is not one for customer use.Staff: The food is prepared pretty rapidly, which is great. The cashier chick, however, could put a smile on her face. She is WAY too serious and even borderline unpleasant.Food/Drink: We just had to cheesesteak sandwiches, fries, and two waters. First off, they have a pop machine (free refills!) but ZERO tap water. If you want water, you have to buy a bottle - pretty lame. The sandwiches are very good and come out nice and hot (as do the fries. I do wish there was a bit extra Cheese Wiz but that's just personal preference.Value: It's a fast food joint so the prices are reasonable. The sides (fries, etc) are pretty pricey though.This is not somewhere I would come on a weekly, or even monthly, basis but it does hit the spot when you have a cheesesteak craving.
2014-11-26,2,My coworkers ordered from this place today.. they said it was really good but it was kinda just meh. I had the California Cheese Steak wrap. The meat was really bland. Very minimal cheese was used... if really any?? Hard to tell. Good amount of meat though... overall it was sub par. At least I'm full.
2014-11-18,5,LOVE their Philly cheesesteak. The meat is crumbled and mixed with the melted cheese and the bread is fresh and soft. Wasn't a big fan of the Fries though. The mozzarella sticks were somewhat cold and hard, not gooey and melted like one would expect. But definitely one of my favorite Philly cheesesteaks ever!
2014-11-12,3,It's close to a philly cheese steak but no cigar.  $5 for onion rings!! Yikes!!! But it's a generous portion and the batter is not too thick.  I like the beef, and there was a healthy portion of it, but the bread is all wrong, too gooey and soft.  Good white cheddar.  Greasy and quick made to order. They also sell tastykakes -another philly treat.  Nice guys. Parking is on street and is as always a real challenge.
2014-11-06,4,Great wings, small and crispy!  Cajun fries are to die for and I hate Cajun fries but these ones are addicting. Two must tries in Hoboken for wings and fries!
2014-11-01,4,I hadn't been to this place in a while, but I stopped by the other night and it is still a great cheese steak place. Clean, friendly and fast, with good tasting food and nice variety to their menu, you really can't go wrong. I'd eat here more I just live farther downtown, but it is definitely worth the trip. The interior is perfectly fine for dining, but I think it's more of a take out/delivery place. Another great fast food joint in Hoboken, and the best   cheese steaks in town.
2014-11-01,5,I would literally eat here everyday if it wouldn't make me fat. The cheesesteak egg rolls are one of the most delicious and satisfying foods I have ever eaten in my life. I crave them on the regular. The cheesesteaks and fries are also perfect- it amazes me how crispy the fries stay even when you order delivery. They always deliver within 20 minutes of ordering. Love this place!
2014-10-25,5,This is my number one option for a Cheese Steak in Hoboken unless you wanna pay 10 dollars more for steaks unlimited 2 The only bad thing about this place is that there is one delivery guy for them who could not move any slower.  He buzzes up and disappears, I stand outside my door waiting for this guy with my food and it literally took him 3 minutes to walk down my hallway to get to me as I watched him.  No wonder every time he delivers the food is cold.
2014-10-19,4,Solid cheesesteaks here. Whether you get steak or chicken, the meat is really good and prepared well. The variety of sandwiches is excellent, they are all really good, and the additional toppings are great. It can get messy, and it certainly isn't the best, but this is a good, satisfying cheesesteak.
2014-10-03,5,Phenomenal cheese steak with banana peppers and some Cajun fries definitely recommended
2014-09-29,3,I'm a big fan of Philly Cheesesteaks.. I've tried them in Philadelphia, NYC and NJ. I've been here twice and the last was better then the first.  I normally just order a steak cheesesteak with the melted cheese with grilled peppers, onions and mushrooms. To me, the steak lacks a little flavor and could have more seasoning. I've had better cheesesteaks in NJ but I would come back here to try something new.
2014-09-21,4,Hoboken is definitely not known for Philly Cheesesteaks. There are Italian Delis and Pizzerias all over the place. (Not that there is anything wrong with that). Stopped by today for a quick bite with the Mrs.   We ordered two sandwiches and they were....  The Chipotle Cheesesteak and the classic Philly Cheesesteak. I am sure everyone knows what a classic is like. This one was very tender and moist with white American Cheese.  The Chipotle was smothered in a spicy Chipotle Mayo which when you first start eating doesn't seem to have much spice but it creeps up on you.  Even on a dreary day like today the place was hopping. They have 3 small table inside with additional seating at a counter by the front window. They also have 4 small tables outside on the sidewalk. Even if you don't like steak there are also chicken and vegetarian options. There dessert, does anyone remember TastyKakes?  I was good and passed this time.  Whether you done in or take out just make sure you have plenty of napkins.
2014-09-14,5,I ordered delivery on a saturday at 3 am. I was very happy with the experience. Had the food delivered on time and the delivery staff staff was very energetic and nice. The philly steak sandwich was really good. And the side of cajun fries made it even better. Definitely stopping by the restaurant next time.
2014-09-02,4,Amazing. Though I'm not from Philly myself, this seems like it could hold its own. I got a regular cheesesteak with onions, peppers, mushrooms and extra whiz (this is the way to go, if you must whiz at all) and it was everything I wanted and more. Glorious, greasy, delicious. Even though they were clearly swamped with phone orders I got my sandwich in under 5 minutes. The garlic and diablo cheesesteaks are definitely on my list of things to hit when I absolutely do come back in the future! Peppers and onions costing extra is a little weird, but that sure won't stop me. I sat outside and stuffed my face like a disgusting animal, and all the yuppies in Hoboken that saw me, beard covered in cheez whiz and devouring that sandwich like it was my last meal on earth, knew in that moment that Midtown was the place to be. Eat here or die
2014-08-28,4,These sammys are the perfect cure for the common Sunday morning hangover. I surprised my FI with a traditional Philly Cheese steak w/Whiz and onions. He gobbled it right up. I had the chicken cheese steak with mozz (YUM) and we shared onion rings. Overall, this is a quick, cheap spot with tasty noms.*small disclaimer* I am from Northern NJ and have not ever had a Cheesesteak down south.
2014-08-18,4,Best cheese steak in Hoboken. They will deliver super late if you have that cheese steak craving at 2:00 am.
2014-08-08,5,Really great cheesesteak place and my go-to place in the area.  I've only had a true Philly cheesesteak once and this is the closest I have tried in Hoboken to that oh so good meat + whiz flavor.  Like others have mentioned, you might want to order your sandwiches with extra Whiz - I ordered mine with extra from the get go and felt the amount of cheese was just right.The fries here are also fantastic - great flavoring, and nice and crispy and they go great with ketchup or cheese.  Finally the delivery service was very fast and the food was piping hot when I received it (took about 25 mins) so kudos to them for that.
2014-08-02,4,Midtown Philly's back again! I love their sandwiches. It's a nice treat and sometimes we get delivery in The Heights! Yes, they deliver there! Yes! Doin' a little east coast swing.
2014-07-03,5,Delicious!  I had a classic with some Cajun fries along with a tasty chipotle mayo sauce. First, the staff is friendlier than others. Second, the serving size is like twice the recommended (I'm in medicine.) ;) Overall, so good and a great value!  Next time, I would like to try some grilled onions on top and I wonder if they can toast the bread just a bit? (I'm the biggest fan of the Vietnamese Banh mi sandwiches.) NOMS!
2014-06-19,5,Whether you want a relaxing lunch or a late night bite, you cannot go wrong with ANY cheese steak here. On my last trip here, Ana recommended the garlic bread cheese steak. I added peppers, onions, and chipotle mayo. This was hands down the best cheese steak I have ever had. I ordered a side of Cajun fries as well. The portions are enough to share but you might not want to!
2014-06-18,5,Best cheese steak in Hoboken. I especially love the chipotle cheese steak. Pretty decent wings.  Great sweet potato fries.
2014-05-31,5,Best Quality Meal on a Budget in Hoboken! Got the Cheesesteak and Batter Fries! Magical. Killed my hunger and cheer my gf up! Just what we needed. I highly recommend getting a cheesesteak and batter fries when ever youre passing by. I will be!
2014-05-22,5,We order from here regularly - love it. Cheesesteak with American & Cheese Whiz, Cajun fries = AMAZING.
2014-05-19,4,OMG! Delicious cheese steaks at 2 AM FTW .The cheese steaks here are great. They dont limit themselves to one particular style either , you can pick any style you want.  You want sliced cheese, they got it, you want cheddar cheese , they got it ,you want the hot warm cheese wiz , they got it too.  The guys behind the counter are pretty friendly , good prices and cheese steaks made to order late into the night , how can you go wrong.No wonder why my friends wanted to make a post bar run all the way here for a quick bite! Totally worth it!
2014-05-03,4,pretty good for a standard cheesesteak. in the beginning their meat had lots of chewy fat on it and I was grossed out but have t another try and it has since improved. will satisfy a craving
2014-04-21,5,Great food. Order on Seamless a lot. A bit pricy for the double meat but otherwise great choices.
2014-04-13,4,OK, I may have been a bit harsh on these folks last time. I got delivery at about 9pm last night and it was pretty quick and totally hit the spot on a Saturday night. It was still 13 bucks, but quite frankly after having a garlic mozzarella cheesesteak I'll admit that this place is really good. It's still expensive and not a "go all the time spot" but it's definitely a good place to go every now and again. Well done on changing my opinion!
2014-04-10,2,I've been going to Midtown Philly Steaks since it was under the prior ownership. I generally like their steaks...although they don't come close to genuine Philly Cheese steaks. Lately, however, their service has shown a steady decline.A few weeks ago I ordered a steak without cheese with only peppers. When I got home, I had a cheese steak with peppers.Tonight I ordered a steak with no cheese with only peppers. I picked it up, got it home...no cheese, but no peppers either.It really shouldn't be that difficult to get the order right.Sorry to say, I'm done with this place.

2014-04-08,4,The service here is "ehh", and the setup is horrible. There are 3 small tables , leaving me without a place to eat most of the time, or feeling very crammed and uncomfortable when I am sitting. The fries are your basic frozen grocery store fries, and don't taste too good. That said the cheese steaks are AMAZING. I eat here once a week, and I am always happy with the quality of my sandwich, they also have a huge variety of cheese steaks to choose from. The prices are ridiculous. I pay $14 for a chew steak and frozen fries. But in all they deserve 4 stars solely for the taste of the cheese steak.
2014-04-03,5,Great cheesesteaks! Try the Garlic Motzzerlla Cheesesteak with chipotle mayo added :) the garlic compliments the spicy mayo really well.
2014-04-03,4,I had a cheesesteak here the other day for lunch -- onions, American cheese and ketchup only! I'm picky. :) I thought it was fantastic, probably the best I've had in the area. I also got the chili cheese fries on the side. I won't lie, the chili wasn't too great (tasted kind of spam-ish), but luckily it was put on the side. The fries were actually awesome! They were very crispy and flavorful. I'll definitely be back here once my next cheesesteak craving kicks in!
2014-03-29,5,I've been ordering pretty much weekly since the first time we tried Midtown and have raved about their food. Today our experience started out not that great and looked like it was going downhill quickly but much to my surprise Ivan, the manager, really turned it around and proved that they want to keep their customers and keep them happy. My order was replaced with perfectly made delicious cheese steaks and he called after I received the order to make sure it was what I wanted.   Any business willing to go the extra step gets my order and I will gladly enjoy my weekend indulgence in their amazing cheese steaks!
2014-02-07,5,Went here for the 2nd time and food was as good, if not better, than the first.  This is a solid establishment.Got the Lemon Pepper Fries because the idea sounded odd/interesting to me.  They were fantastic.  A flavoring I'd never think of and was really pleased with them.  Delicious.
2014-02-02,4,Well, I'm impressed. I'm a bit of a cheesesteak snob, having grown up in the Philadelphia area, and constantly having one poor excuse for a "Philly cheesesteak" after another in other cities. One time, I even had a t-bone steak topped with a piece of square cheese, between two pieces of bread, put in front of me. So, I've seen and eaten it all at this point. But, this sandwich was all I could ask for- a soft, fresh roll, with lean, chopped beef with the American cheese cooked in with the steak. Prices are close to a dollar higher than Philadelphia, so they lose a star. If you are a South Jersey/Philly-proper area transplant like me, and looking for a good cheesesteak 'fix', this is your place.
2014-01-05,4,Awesome Cajun fries but they never deliver the chipotle mayo I request. My bf loves the place for a man-wich. Really don't know why tasty kakes are on the menu... Pre packaged and taste disgusting - please offer real fresh cake !
2014-01-01,1,This place gave me food poisoning AND when I ordered from them AND my friend did they gave he her order and didn't even deliver mine and then said oh I don't know where your order is with no answer....then, they are a half a block away meanwhile they forgot my soda one time and said they couldn't come back for 45 mins! What a joke! No wonder the old cheesesteak place closed y'all aren't even from philly you're a joke
2013-10-31,3,Now, being from South Jersey (adopted sister of Philly), I know a good cheesesteak. And while, honestly, this 1 doesn't compare to the best I've had, I ain't turning my nose up at it (and that's saying something). I am surprised to say, this was a damn good cheesesteak. Who'dve thunk it?! I ordered the garlic mozzarella sandwich and it was quite yummy. I also got the Cajun fries per many reviews; they were awesome! Both items were fresh and hot. I'm sure I'll be back. Next time I plan to try a chicken cheesesteak.
2013-10-20,5,Excellent Cheese Steak and Cajun Fries.  I ordered a Philly w/extra whiz, onions, peppers, mushrooms and side of cajun fries.  No complaints, was very good.  Would recommend and order again.
2013-10-17,3,Solid.  Great option for a greasy late night fix, especially if you're pizza'd out.The garlic mozzarella cheesesteak and the Hawaiian cheesesteak are delicious. Chipotle cheesesteak is good but a bit too heavy on the spicy mayo (I think made with sriracha). Fries are AMAZING- the Cajun and especially the Lemon Pepper.  Pretty good wings.  Have tried the hot, mild, and sriracha wings and the mild were definitely the best.  Even my boyfriend, who ALWAYS prefers hot wings, agreed. So I don't know if that means the mild are above average or the hot are sub par?? You decide.Open late which is essential for a cheesesteak place!
2013-06-15,5,came across this place online, late one night, while craving a philly cheesesteak and was limited to ordering online. after numerous orders and wonderful service requests being fulfilled, i present you my "old" review from another rating service..."awesome cheesesteaks. incredible fries. customer service is beyond good. ive been using ******* for over a year, and my first review is for Midtown Philly. please give them a shot. every time i order[ordered from them over 20 times], they cater to me and my picky needs. they rock. i asked for a drawing on the wrapping, they actually drew on a lil package with a tastykake treat inside. EPIC WIN. their steak sammiches are awesome, regardless of what kind u pick. the fries are to die for. Mmmmm."even long after that review, they continued to be awesome. after many [awesome]drawings and the occasional unwarranted surprise[free snack etc], i can still recommend them 1,000% percent.i now live further away, but i will def stop by if im in town.**miss you guys. wishing you continuous success!**-also: be nice to the places you order from. "if you're looking for honey, you can't attract bees with vinegar"i've ordered from MANY places, some of the best just happened to "suck" the first time. always give a 2nd chance... you never know if they were having a bad/busy/whatever day.
2013-04-13,5,I was in front of Planet Fitness after working out.  I was starved and planned to walk down to Subway.  On my way I passed Midtown Philly Steaks.  In I went.  I ordered the Garlic Mozzarella Cheese Steak.  Heaven.  I think there's been some change to management/ owners.  If you've had problems with them before, although I haven't,  give them another try.
2013-04-05,2,Ordered at 7:45 for 2 adults and a two year old, said it would be there in 30-45 minutes. Called at 8:45 to see where the order was. They said, "It should be there soon, the driver left a while ago." At 9pm, we gave up and fed the 2 year old leftovers because she was starving. The food finally around around 9:15, after 1 1/2 hours and right before I was going to call and cancel the order. The food was warm, so I'm pretty sure they just didn't make it until I called at 8:45.When the food arrived, the beef cheese steak was good, but the chicken one was not. It was cut whole then cut into little chunks. Cheese steaks (even chicken) are supposed to be cut small before they're cooked. So avoid the chicken. The lemon fries were good, I'd get those again.So... don't order if you're hungry or planning to feed children. Avoid the chicken. Try the lemon fries.
2013-03-31,2,I used to think their Cheese steak egg rolls were unbelievable (WITHOUT BOOZE!), but the consistency is not good. One time the egg rolls were amazingly seasoned, the next they were so bland that I thought I was eating styrofoam. The steak meat itself has this problem.  I really hope this place gets it together. I'll give one more try before condeming them.
2013-03-19,5,Being from Texas where considerate and accommodating customer service is the standard, having become a New Jersey/ New York resident I have found very few places where the kindness and consideration remind me of home. Luckily, I have found it here at Midtown! From the EXTREMELY patient lady who kindly took my order that changed about five times to the WONDERFUL owner who gave me free bags to use at a party for my family, these people warmed my heart. But this is a restaurant, so what about the food?? All biases about kind customer service to the side, the food is PERFECT. My husband had the chicken cheesesteak with onions, bell peppers, jalapenos, provolone and mayo. The roll was SUPER FRESH, the chicken was moist and perfectly seasoned and the veggies were grilled to the ideal tenderness. Everything was juicy and yummy but the as never soggy(BONUS!!). I had the vegetarian sandwich with jalapenos and marinara sauce and provolone. DELISH! I love when people take extra care of the non-meat eaters and this place has it all. We loved every bite of our meal!! We ate there about two weeks ago and the food was just as amazing then. We will go back without hesitation!!THIS PLACE IS A MUST GO FOR ANYONE WITH A MOUTH! The kindness is just provolone on the sandwich ;)
2013-03-18,4,I would say that this place is really 3.5 stars, but rounding up because giving them 3 stars just didn't seem right.I came here on a Sunday night for a quick dinner and we got the garlic mozzarella and blackened chicken sandwiches.  The garlic mozzarella is actually a cheesesteak with mozz on garlic bread - it had all the potential to be AMAZING but just didn't execute.  Some bites were deliciously garlicky, but the others had no garlic flavor at all.  I would also say they need to put at least twice as much cheese - I'll try getting extra cheese (and maybe extra garlic too) next time and see how it goes.  As for the blackened chicken, I only had a couple of bites, and it was very flavorful.  Not quite for me but nothing wrong with it other than my tastes.Now the cajun fries are some of the best I've ever had.  Even if I never find a cheese steak here that I love, I'll still come back just for the cajun fries.  You're missing out if you don't get them!I'll definitely be back, if not just for the fries, but also because I think this place has potential if I can order the right combination.
2013-03-11,5,My favorite cheese steak place! Absolutely  delicious ! And , loved the lemon-pepper French fries!
2013-03-09,3,I've been here twice so far. I'm originally from the southern NJ so needless to say I've had more than my fair share of Philly cheesesteaks. Your simply not going to find a Pat's, Geno's or Jim's up here, those places ARE the epitome or Philly cheesesteaks. That being said this place serves a pretty authentic Philly cheesesteak, not excellent, but for the area pretty good. The steaks are essentially the same as what they were when it was called Philly cheesesteaks. One new thing that is fantastic here are the Cajun fries. If you like Cajun fries these are great, better than five guys, and they are nice and crispy. In terms of cheesesteaks this place is a solid option. The Cajun fries are excellent.
2013-02-25,4,Went to this place over the weekend and bought 2 mushroom cheesesteaks with wiz. Gave one to my brother and fiancee and they loved it that we got more today.Ordered the mushroom Cheesesteak again which is my favorite. Also got the pizza steak which isn't my thing. My bro and his fiancee got 2 chicken cheesesteaks which they liked very much. The onion rings were good. Also tried the cajun fries and they are spicy. We also ordered the cheesesteak eggroll and it was good.Hopefully my bro will pick up the tab the next time we order from there. I want to try the Hawaiian Cheesesteak to see how it is and the diablo.Glad I found this spot.
2013-02-14,5,the customer service was excellent, and I cannot wait to devour my California Philly steak sandwich. Iman was courteoua enough to even provide us with samples of french fries. he saved me from being sick and having to cook.Update:  After consumption of the sandwich --WHOO HOO! Excellent thinly sliced steak meat, fresh onions melted white American, fresh firm sliced tomatoes and shredded lettuce.  I was under the weather, and rejected a lot of food unless it was soup.  This was an exception to the rule.  I ate it well after I purchased it, and even cold, it was fantastic!  I am so happy to find out that they deliver to my area in northern New Jersey, and I will be ordering in if I'm not up to driving to Hoboken. Keep up the good work Midtown!
2013-02-11,5,Was in town visiting a friend who wanted to try this place out cuz it was brand new. The place was very clean with tasteful interior design and the staff was so friendly and welcoming! I figured I would switch it up from the classic cheesesteak so I ordered the Pittsburgh cheesesteak with american cheese and coleslaw. I also had the chili cheese fries with cheese wiz and both were absolutely amazing. I can't remember the last time I had such a satisfying meal so i felt compelled to write them a review. My friend had the Garlic Mozzarella Cheesesteak which she said was awesome and the Cajun fries! OMG Out of this world! I couldn't get my hands out her fries!!! So over all the food is fresh and good quality with a lot of flavor. I don't live in the area but would highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!
2013-02-06,5,I ordered catering for my company located in the Harborside Financial Center in Jersey City.  The order was for ten people and consisted of 10 different types of subs (chicken and steak), a platter of fries (really yummy) and a platter of garden salad.  The food was absolutely terrific, arrived on time and piping hot with all of the utensils and condiments included.  Leftovers were non-existent.It made for a super great change from the typical sandwich routine.  I highly recommend.
2013-02-06,4,I would say they are really 3.5 stars, but rounding up is deserved here. Having grown up just north of Philly city center, I know cheesesteaks pretty well. In fact it is my favorite food. Is this place, Jim's, Tony Luke's, etc. (Pats and Genos suck, sorry folks), absolutely not.  Do they try, they do! I will start by saying the Cajun fries are a MUST try. They are fantastic. The jalapeno poppers were kinda just "ok" but the dipping sauce a chipotle mayo really stands out as a winner, and is even better when put on the Cajun fries.On to the steaks. I've been twice now, the first time I ordered whiz wit. (plain cheestesteak with cheese whiz and onions). It was pretty good, I should have ordered extra whiz, it was lacking a bit and the lady said hers was as well. Next time we ordered extra whiz and there was a decent amount. The steak is pretty good, doubt it's rib eye though. What really makes a cheesesteak  is the roll. They are using french baguettes, which is ok, it's obviously not an Amoroso roll, but semi close. I asked them why no Amoroso and they said they are too big and don't want to work with small businesses...that seems weird to me, but ok. The onions were a bit lacking, like they had cooked them that morning, put them in a lexan and just put them on when an order came in. They weren't sitting on the grill being warmed. They are pretty quick with pick up orders (which is what we've gotten both times), even on Super Bowl Sunday. The second time I got the pizza steak, and it was meh ok. I probably wouldn't get that one again.  For an attempt at a Philly steak it's the best option in town, no doubt about that. Not as good as Shorty's in the city but a darn good try. I hope they do very well, it's nice to get a taste of home here in Hoboken.
2013-02-03,4,I'm from the Philly suburbs. I run the Philadelphia Eagles Club of Hoboken. I know my cheesesteaks. With that being said, its hard to compare a TRUE Philly cheesesteak outside of Philly. In New York, for example, I would say that Wogie's and Carl's cheesesteaks hit the mark for a good cheesesteak, and usually order from one or the other when I need my cheesesteak fix. Looks like those guys have some serious competition. This place is the real McCoy.Look, i'm not going to try to convince you this is Jim's or Geno's or Pat's from Philly. You simply can't compare such iconic places. But, as a matter of comparison I would say this place equals what you would get from a good local cheesesteak place you find in the suburbs of Philly or South Jersey. I used to order cheesesteaks from a place as a kid in Ocean City, for example called Voltaco's. Big fan. Loved the place, they had nice big steaks and good sides.This would be like that. The rolls are on the money. No, they aren't Amoroso's but they are nice big French baugettes that are chewy and fresh. The steak appears to have the same consistency and flavor of what you find around Philly, its chopped and salted - and not dry. I ordered mine with onions and marinara (a "pizza steak") and should add that whatever marinara sauce that they use Do Not Change - its the hallmark of a good pizza steak when someone finally understands you don't just slap Ragu on a pizza steak, but actually use something that has some flavor and some spice. Not sure what they use but it's really good and the reason why I ordered it not once, but TWICE this weekend.I tried the cajun fries and the onion rings. Both are fantastic, and I give Cajun fries the nod and even dare to say they are better than Five Guys Cajun fries. Yes, I know Five Guys are super fresh, but I really liked the crispy fries and the Cajun spice they used here, and would order that every time.Also really like the fact that they have Tastykakes. I'm a big fan of Tastykakes and love ordering them. Kind of-sort of wish they were $1.50 and not $2.00 each, I mean you can get Tastykakes at Manhattan Express Deli in Hoboken (1st and Washington St.)  for a $.85. I sincerely hope they carry chocolate Junior's which are my personal favorite. I tried Midtown twice. My first delivery on Friday was over an hour. The steak arrived lukewarm. I can't say I was thrilled about it, but to me I usually give new places a bit of a break, since they get slammed and are just starting to work out the kinks with delivery. The next night, the delivery was at 11pm on a Saturday and they were at my condo in 30 minutes with a nice hot cheesesteak. But even eating it lukewarm or real warm - both times I enjoyed eating the steak. I hope they work out their delivery problems, because no one wants to get a cold cheesesteak - but that shouldn't take away from the fact that the cheesesteak is actually very good. Lastly what gives Midtown a big plus are the hours. The best part of living around NYC is the idea that its a city that never sleeps - and i'm someone who always finds myself hungry late at night. Sometimes you only have Chinese food or pizza to choose from and its cool that you have this place open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. This place is going to be very popular if they fix their delivery issues and if the quality of their product stays high. Order now.
2013-01-29,5,If you're baked right now, don't even bother looking elsewhere. This is your Hoboken munchies solution.Really delicious cheesesteaks, incredibly speedy delivery, and open late. What more could one wish for?
2013-01-28,4,i have loved this place for a long time now. I've brought friends from Philly to compare the cheesesteaks from here to the ones in Philly and they have all agreed the cheesesteaks here are better. The staff is always nice and the food is always on point. I highly recommend this place after a night of drinking in Hoboken. So happy they've extended their hours to 4am!
2013-01-26,4,Saw that they were now open (they just opened yesterday after talking with the cashier), and figured I would try them out.  Haven't had a Cheesesteak in a while so, this was my opportunity to spoil myself.Pricing is on par with the last Cheesesteak place that was here, and the Tavern Cheesesteak with Fries was delicious.  The meal was a bit more filling than the last place (at least from my recollection ... it's been a while), which is good, as I like a bit more bang for my buck.I'll be back for more no doubt.
