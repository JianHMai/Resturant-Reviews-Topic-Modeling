2021-10-23,1,The attitude is still very bad, meanwhile all drink taste like powder, I cannot taste tea at all.Maybe they should change their name to vivi powder tea.
2021-07-26,5,Came here many times during my 4 years in Hoboken, loved stopping by for a refreshing fruit tea after class. Their milk tea and slushies were also great, and the service is quite friendly and helpful.
2021-06-10,4,I tried this vivi bubble tea Hoboken location twice  during my commute to a band rehearsal in Bayonne. The bubble tea their is good and I tried their peach oolong tea and their Thai iced milk tea with the bubbles and their both good. They also offer food from ramen to rice bowls along with a variety hot and cold tea drinks, slushees , and non-tea based drinks. The place also adjust the ice and sweetness level to your liking. This place is good choice for bubbles tea and they have locations in New Jersey and in Manhattan.
2021-05-22,5,Possibly my favorite place in all of Hoboken! The only food item I'm not allergic to is the chicken cashew rice bowl and yet it's so good that I always order from here!Drink-wise, the Kumquat Lemon flavored tea is my go-to! "Normal" sugar is 100% but it's saccharine so I tend to go for 30%. Also, the watermelon slush is great during summertime!Just make sure to ask for chopsticks if you order delivery because they will assume you want forks by default.
2021-04-22,3,My friend ordered the brown sugar bubble tea and it was too milky and did not have enough brown sugar to give it any flavor. I ordered the Lychee Oolong 50% sweetened and it was quite refreshing. We also ordered an order of basic popcorn chicken and it was definitely on point! But if I'm being quite honest, I probably wouldn't come back here for bubble tea if it was out of the way, but the popcorn chicken, DEF.
2021-02-28,4,I have been frequenting Vivi bubble tea for the last 2 years. Overall, this is likely the best bubble tea in hoboken. I love the variety of flavors... but I usually just go with my favorite Taro milk tea. I like how you can select the level of sugar and ice. And I have ordered the ramen in the past which I remember enjoying a lot!I only have one con... but I will note that this had not previously been a problem pre-covid. But when I was there last weekend there was only 1 person at the counter taking orders and 1 person making the drinks (probably due to social distancing requirements) however this led to a long wait time for our drinks (about 20 minutes). There were 4 people waiting already before we entered the store and about 3 people joined the line after us. Pickup orders were also being made. Also, considering that half the store is closed off (the back dining area) due to covid, the front waiting area was way too small to hold 7 people waiting will social distancing. It just did not feel safe. We decided to wait outside.Overall, 10/10 for bubble tea. But if you are in a rush, order for pickup.
2021-02-04,5,The food is always great. I go for their pork chashu rice bowl every time and it's soo filling.
2021-01-24,5,Vivi has the best bubble tea- I go to this location all the way from jersey city because it's so good. Highly recommend!! I always get the fruit tea (different kinds) with 30% sugar I add pudding and tapioca and jelly. It's very refreshing and tasty!
2021-01-23,5,Love Vivi Bubble Tea! I'm currently doing the ramen rounds and while I will take the time to drive from Hoboken to Mitsuwa in Edgewater and wait for 45 min at Santoku to get their spicy miso ramen, Vivi more than gets the job done and is excellent.  There are a lot of new ramen places opening which is exciting but I would encourage you to also think of Vivi when a ramen craving hits. I fully endorse them as solid contender.  They are way more than just tea.
2020-11-08,3,To start out with a positive, the macaroons are AMAZING! I definitely recommend. However, I was very upset with my tea. The ordering system is very deceiving and confusing. She asked how much sugar I wanted but how was I supposed to know? I said "30%" because I didn't know how much sugar was an appropriate amount. My drink was DISGUSTING! It tasted like dirt! I couldn't finish it I had to throw it out. I guess if you come here ask for the regular amount of sugar.
2020-11-05,5,I have been coming here regularly for the past two or three years. Before COVID, I would come multiple times a week for lunch and do some work on my laptop.I tend to like any Vivi location but this one is by far my favorite and one of my absolute favorite places of any kind.My go-to is the taro milk tea and the pepper salt popcorn chicken. Their drinks are fantastic and the tapioca bubbles are always made exactly right (not too soft, not sweetened aggressively--just right). The popcorn chicken is fried super well so that it has a bit of crisp but remains tender inside, and the flavor is great. The portion size for the chicken is very ample for the price.Their ramen and other items are also great.The staff is always very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. And they've decorated in a way that is clean and cute and comfortable.For COVID, they were among the first to take a really safe, yet straightforward, approach with pickup and takeout very easy to order and receive via their rearranged setup with a convenient pickup table, plastic/plexiglass, and everyone wearing masks and gloves etc for protection.When not in COVID-times, there was plenty of seating, multiple outlets, and super fast wifi.
2020-07-04,5,I loveee this place, it has some of my favorite Tea, I get the galaxy drink almost every time.
2020-06-30,5,A cute place for some typical Taiwanese snacks in NJ! The ramen is pretty good and the popcorn chicken is bomb. Same with the bubble tea. The only thing I would not recommend is getting the macaroons or macarons (however you spell it) in the display. They are NOT fresh. I ordered a matcha flavor and it tasted like a hard candle. Everything else is fine :).
2020-06-29,4,I really like their bubble teas but I go here often for their ramen and chicken popcorn. I love their crispy chicken popcorn with garlic flavor. I have tried their takoyaki as well but they weren't the best. They are probably frozen ahead of the time and cooked when ordered so it's impossible to be compared to the freshly made ones (but still, not terrible). Their ramen is pretty good in my opinion. I like both tonkotsu and shoyu flavor (it's just a matter of your preference) I like shoyu better (tends to be a little lighter than miso or tonkotsu broth) but my husband likes deep and rich tonkotsu broth better.
2020-06-04,5,Didn't like the Oreo milk/milk tea. The cookies tasted strange. Wasn't a fan however the taro was SOOOOOO good, bubbles were chewy and fresh. The taro were REAL and perfect. The milk tea was also so perfect and they use real tea leaves. Price was about $7 after taxes. Pricey but it's kind of worth it.
2020-02-29,1,Wow the food is terribleTakoyaki is crispy wtf??? And no octopus??Vegetarian bowl was very saltyWould never come here agaib
2020-02-09,1,I have never been so thoroughly disappointed with food in Jersey as with this location. Ordered ramen and it was the worst; I would've been better off opening any random can of soup at Whole Foods. The noodles were inferior quality; they cannot be house-made. $11 ramen should simply not be this cheap in noodle quality, period. As for the rest.. the mushrooms were too chewy, and the broth lacked any semblance of depth. It was a tremendous disappointment. I couldn't finish it. Yuck. Vivi's in Manhattan is an acceptably satisfying experience for the price. This location, however, is not even a pale imitation; it is a mockery. Avoid this miserable packaged noodle stand and treat yourself to something worth your time.
2020-02-04,5,This is my daily craving. I love Taro bubble tea here . That's one of my favorite, bubble teas r absolutely good even without sugar..
2020-01-28,5,Best lunch I have had in a long time. Really hit the spot. I had the miso ramen with pork at the regular spice level. Really, really good. Oolong bubble tea was also good.
2020-01-08,5,Can't go wrong with bubble tea, I got the regular Milk Bubble tea with Tapioca and Pudding, they had a small area to sit down, and clean bathroom.
2020-01-07,5,Nice warm location to run in for a bubble tea craving in the middle of winter- that's exactly what we did! They offer ramen and other snacks as well but we were there for the bubble tea and it definitely did not disappoint. The interior decor was super cute and I loved the couches they had in one corner. Staff was also friendly.
2020-01-05,4,Omg I walked by this place and decided why not try it, at first I wasn't sure because the vibe was awkwardly quite when I first walked in, and the cashier seemed like she didn't want to be there or maybe she was tired. Since It was my first time I spotted a drink called Oreo creme brûlée, how much it sound so good I was wondering if it was something that I like. I asked the cashier what would be your recommendation, she did not tell me much. So I decided to go with the first option that I was at first curious about. After trying the Oreo Creme Brûlée I enjoyed everything about it, and how tasty it was.
2020-01-01,5,We stopped in today to try the Takoyaki and ramen.We ordered takoyaki, spicy popcorn chicken, and Vivi chicken ramen. I also ordered a hot matcha milk tea to go. The takoyaki was excellent!! Great crisp on outside, flavorful and soft inside and toppings were soo yummy! We would order this again. The popcorn chicken was a pleasant surprise! The spice was excellent. Little bit of heat, not painful. Perfect crunch of chicken. Not dry. We would order this again too! The chicken ramen was fresh and flavorful. We ordered that spicy too. Chicken was cooked perfect, veggies cooked perfect, noodles cooked perfect. Egg was yummy! Great flavor of seaweeds. The matcha green tea milk was smooth and creamy! The matcha was blended well. I'm sooo happy we stopped in here today. Our order came out quick too. :)
2019-11-03,4,Amazing popcorn chicken. Ramen is tasty & doesn't disappoint. Small and tidy place close to the river in Hoboken- Jersey City. Good place to stop by and enjoy ramen if you are a ramen fan.I tried to bubble tea as well and it was good. Staff is decent and welcoming as well.
2019-10-31,1,I have been vivi's client since I moved here last year. The food is ok quality and fairly priced. But recently, the service became terrible, it took fever to get my order! There was one time I even waited for more than half an hour to get just one order. The guy behind me got a little upset about the long waiting time, he complained to the cashier lady. The lady replied with a poker face and in a cold voice that why not call in advance? I doubt this guy would ever come back to ViVi again.  if the service gets better in the future, to truly reflect the situation, I will update my review
2019-10-24,5,I've been here a few times and have always been happy with the service. The staff is friendly and helpful if you have any questions. The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. I've never tried any of their food but the items on the menu look delicious and the plates I've seen come out of the kitchen look really good.  The drinks are so good and always prepared to your taste and made to order. I will definitely keep coming back!
2019-08-21,3,Stopped here to get a slush and saw popcorn chicken on the menu so had to get it. The slush was good, I got it with the floated "cheese" on top. It was my first time with this floated on top. A heads up to those who haven't had it, it is kind of salty and reminiscent of cheese cake but in a foam texture.What was a little shocking to me was that there were a cool variety of different popcorn chicken flavors, which to me was unique in comparisons to other bubble tea places I'd been--ex. Garlic, spicy, curry--but.. you couldn't mix the flavors. I understand if the batter is different. But most of the time bubble tea places with popcorn chicken have chili powder in a shaker and sriracha, pepper, etc. on a side counter so you can spice it up according to your tastes. I was a little disappointed I couldn't order the garlic or curry flavor and make it spicy on my own, considering I couldn't technically get a mixed flavor like spicy+curry when ordering.
2019-08-07,2,In the day and age when every new business wants you to use your credit card and some places don't even accept cash this place charged me an extra .50 cents to charge a $6.00 drink.  Cheap and lame, won't be back......
2019-07-23,3,The taro creme brulee milk bubble tea is one of their featured drinks on their digital menu, so I tried it. Used my student ID to upgrade to a large for free (saved a dollar!). I did 30% sugar and medium ice, and like that you can customize that. I was more excited for the taro part, but I tasted absolutely no taro flavor. There was creme brulee chunks in the bottom of the cup, so that was sweet, but I was 50% let down. So if you want the strong taro flavor, avoid this one. However, it was still full of great starchy balls and satisfied my sweet tooth. It was pretty average in quality and didn't blow my mind, but it's a cheap way to get your bubble tea fix in the area.
2019-07-05,4,Ordered matcha and coconut boba teas -- very good and would come back to try other flavors/food.
2019-06-27,1,Honestly just slow and of below avg qualityIn the door: 9:03pm. 2 ppl ahead of me in the line with simple orders. Only received my order (standard bubble milk tea, basic stuff) at 9:22pm. Really should not take 18 min to clear 3 drink orders. Tea was fairly diluted and tastes like it's from powder premix, not actual tea. Bubbles were clearly not that fresh (forgivable, as I was a late night order, but unimpressive). They ran out of bubbles for the folks ordering after me.$10 minimum for credit card spend. Service wasn't either friendly or rude. I would call it "efficient", except that it wasn't.In 18 minutes I can walk to gong cha on 6th/Washington and back, which takes credit cards for $5 orders and gives a discount for cash, and has way better tea and boba. Won't come back to Vivi.
2019-06-19,4,Vivi's Bubble Tea is great for the price point and they are a quick service. The staff is friendly and the food options are great as well. The inside decor is cute and is picture worthy. I love the different flavor options and the view of the city is a few blocks away; pairs well with your bubble tea.
2019-06-10,1,I ordered deliveries from Vivi 3 times and the delivery guys are so rude!!! They gave me long face, and threw the bag to me without saying anything even after I asked "Is that Vivi?", then turned around and left!! My appetite was ruined and didn't even have to mood to enjoy the food. I would never ever order online again.
2019-06-09,3,I really love this place! I usually come here with friends ! I love the environment and the vibe! What I don't like is they always charge you for the little things. And u need a 10 dollars minimum which kinda sucks.
2019-04-17,5,Have only bought the passion fruit slush from here but I love it :) if you order less than $10 though, they only take cash, not debit or credit. It's a cute little spot and been here about 4 times.
2019-02-20,4,Vivi Bubble Tea is just about the only bubble tea game in town in Hoboken - or at least the only bubble tea spot that is worth paying a visit to. That's not necessarily a bad thing though!What's great about Vivi Bubble Tea is that it is definitely more affordable than the higher end New York options such as Boba Guys, etc. At those super fancy bubble tea cafes, the bubble tea options start - START - at like $6. Vivi Bubble Tea is a welcome affordable option. Sure, Vivi may not be as fancy as those more expensive spots. Sure, Vivi may not have customization options as extravagant aa those more expensive spots. But, at the end of the day, Vivi Bubble Tea provides a quality bubble tea product at an affordable price. What more could you want?! Bubble tea that anybody can enjoy.
2019-01-25,5,Got lazy on a Friday night after work so we decided to order delivery. I've walked by this place probably a thousand times and have been meaning to try it out. Placed an order on Seamless around 6:30pm and received it in about 45 minutes. That's not bad considering the time and Hoboken traffic. We got two orders of the Taiwanese braised pork rice bowl and an order of the salt and pepper popcorn chicken. The seasoning for the popcorn chicken was perfectly balanced- it wasn't too salty or too peppery. The chicken was tender and delicious. The braised pork bowl was pretty good. The rice is very good, not your standard take out long grain rice. The pork is good, the soy sauce isn't overwhelming and the portion of meat is pretty generous for a $10 bowl.It's a good meal if you're looking for some good Taiwanese. I haven't had the ramen or their bubble tea so I can't say anything about that yet, but I'll definitely try them next time.
2019-01-22,4,Just passed by here, i think this is a new store. I got the taro cloud, technically taro tea with whip cream! Lol. This place has ramen too! I haven't tried it! But will definitely come back!
2019-01-22,3,Being so close to the PATH, I really wanted to like Vivi for the convenience of their location. The staff was friendly and ordering was quick even if it was a little slow to get my food. Unfortunately, it seems like they have too much going on here. It's one thing to serve just bubble tea and make sure you get that right. It's another to serve bubble tea, ramen and chicken and expect to nail all 3. Vivi only happens to get 1 of those 3 right, which is their popcorn chicken bites. I tried the soy garlic and thought they were pretty good and fairly priced.Although, being a bubble tea store, you would expect that to be the best thing they offer, but that was definitely not the case. You can judge most bubble tea places by their regular milk tea as a baseline and theirs was really diluted. They also really skimped on the tapioca balls. My girlfriend got the taro milk tea and she said it was just OK.I tried the Tonkotsu ramen and it was as average as they come. The ramen served here is nothing like some cheap cup noodles, but it would be the equivalent of a Whopper going up against the Peter Luger burger.I may be willing to try more of their drinks simply due to the convenience of their location, but I came away unimpressed.
2018-12-27,2,Verymuch average bubble tea place. They no longer serve cotton candy bubble tea which had featured in food insider. I am also cutting the stars as they are 'cash only below 10$' place. I wouldn't drive to visit this place again as there are always many bubble tea places around
2018-11-24,1,Staff is kinda aloof. They used powder vs. real ingredients to make milk tea, which is more $5 (I ordered hot matcha)...
2018-11-14,5,Yummm! If you can find some parking and you're passing by, I fully suggest stopping in to Vivi. It's a small storefront with a huge menu! I was just walking in to buy some bubble tea but was shocked to see they offered ramen and rice bowls as well.It was my first time here and I was basically just staring at the menu in awe. The workers were very patient with me. Now, I don't know if I'm late to the party or not but red bean matcha bubble tea??! So freaking delicious. I also got a plain matcha bubble tea. Both were large sizes and the price came out to be around 12 dollars. Pretty standard for quality bubble tea. The tapioca was also super soft and fresh. The space inside is big enough to sit and hang out, they have a few tables. There's also free ice water while you wait. It's a very open concept so you can watch them making your tea. Can't wait to try some of their other fantastic flavors. This spot is a little gem.
2018-11-03,5,The environment is so casual and trendy. It's super pretty and the workers are very nice. I ordered the sweet passion fruit bubble tea and it was so great! The music is nice and the chairs and arrangement are very well done. They have little plants on the walls that make the place even more homey and calm. I love it.
2018-10-21,1,Jessica recommended a drink for me so I tried it. I took a sip and didn't like it. I took two more sips and still didn't like it. There were seeds that came out too. I went back to Jessica and told her that I didn't like it and asked if I could try something else and she said they don't do exchanges. I've never been to a tea house where they don't accommodate drinks that are made poorly. I sat down and told my friends that my drink tasted funny and they said their drinks also tasted funny. This place is weird. The girls that make the drinks don't do a very good job at the drink making part... which is the whole point. One star. :(
2018-10-16,2,This was my third and final visit for RAMEN at this shop. Maybe I'll stop by to try their Bubble Tea but NEVER FOR RAMEN AGAIN. I visited this shop on three separate occasions, varying in different noodles options and each time, I was let down. The broth seemed watered down and lacked in overall flavor (and I ordered EXTRA SPICY). I found red onions in the dish which I thought was pretty odd and of course, it tasted odd. I've had cup noodles that tasted better than what little lady brought on that tray. I ordered tonkatsu miso ramen, extra spicy and got noodles tossed in an ill-defined broth, extra bland.
2018-10-03,3,Good location, near by the path. Tea and food is just regular. Service could be poor sometimes.
2018-09-09,1,Very over priced and unfriendly. The service is cold, short, rude. The chicken ramen tasted suspicious. Disliked it. My kid ate the Shrimp. Only ate half. Honestly they are super unfriendly here. Never going back.
2018-09-07,3,The spicynes of the ramen is good, but the noodles are really thick and there is very less broth. The store charges charges very less for the ramen compared to some other places, deofnetly good on that front.
2018-08-24,3,This review is only about the bubble tea because that's all I have had here. Great bubble tea always delicious and they put a good amount of tapioca in the drink. I do think the people behind the counter could be a bit more friendly.
2018-08-22,4,I really love this place for the tea and the mini snacks. I love the seating and they have great WiFi and the food comes out fast. It's comfortable. My favorite tea is the tiramisu with extra bubbles. The only reason I gave one less star is because the popcorn chicken is questionable. A bit on the fattier side...is it actually chicken?
2018-08-08,5,I've only ordered the bubble tea from here, so I can't speak for the other menu items. Although powder-based, the bubble tea has been consistently good with the bubbles cooked perfectly. The decor inside is super cute, so I always like to stay and sit to have my drink. Whenever I'm in Hoboken, I always make sure to stop by!
2018-08-05,4,This is a good spot for bubble tea. I normally go to the ones in the city but this is a conveniently located store in Hoboken.  I got my usual milk tea with boba and pudding. Their spicy popcorn chicken is also tasty and goes perfectly with any boba drink. The other drink shown is the lychee green tea with mango boba.
2018-07-20,5,Great place to get my fix for Bubble Tea.  They use powder, and lots of it, but it's extremely hard to find a place that doesn't.  The staff are usually friendly, and they make the bubble tea fast.  They have a loyalty program, so be sure to ask about it if you come here often!
2018-07-20,2,Customer service was disappointing unfortunately. The bubble tea I ordered was not what I had asked for, and more importantly the person behind the register ('Jhanica' I believe her name was) had a negative attitude and made it difficult to make things right. This store location really needs to conform to the standards of other Vivi locations. A great way to ruin a perfect day :(
2018-06-21,5,I love this place compared to vivi bubble tea in Philadelphia China town and NYC China town. This place has ramen, taco yaki, seaweed, chicken wings, and other stuff that the other vivi bubble teas do not have. There is more variety of food. Their ramen bowls are great if you need a quick bite. I loved to go pick up some quick finger foods and sit by the ocean view of NYC at the park area during lunch. The service is also fairly quick. My favorite drink is the lemon jasmine tea with lychee jelly. They make other good tea as well.
2018-06-19,2,Menu looks extensive, but too bad I was unable to try since there is a $10 minimum for cards and unwilling budge even after I offered to pay for the transaction cost. I've never had an issue with any ViVi's other locations in Manhattan, guess that's just Hoboken for you......
2018-04-24,4,Seems like it's a great place to get ramen, but I only came for bubble tea!I've been living in Taiwan...birthplace of bubble tea for the past 5 years and Vivi gets my seal of approval. I remember when bubble tea was still a young trend in the states and not many places gave you the option of adjusting sugar and ice levels, which is a standard when it comes to bubble tea!I remember when there was a location in Chinatown and was glad to hear they opened up in Hoboken. I came with friends after dinner to have dessert and chillax. I ordered the Yakult Green Tea and friends got various kinds of milk tea with bubbles and pudding. One friend had go down to his third choice because his first two choices were sold out or lacked ingredients. Despite him not being happy about it (I would've been a bit upset too), it's quite common for a tea shop to run out of ingredients towards the end of the day.We were a party of 6 and got lucky with the couch/lounge area being empty. We hung out and chatted until 10-15 minutes before close and were not asked to leave, which is nice since some stores tend to give you a heads up, which is really their passive aggressive way to say, gtfo, I need to clean the dining area.All in all, prices were ok and seems like the Taiwanese snacks are pretty good. Will give Vivi another visit next time I'm in town.
2018-03-25,4,We stopped by here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. We were craving ramen and our craving was truly satisfied.It's a cozy little location with a decent amount of seating. I had the vegetarian ramen and it was truly excellent. Probably the best vegetarian ramen I've ever eaten... not that I'm a ramen connoisseur!I also had a bubble tea that was good.I'll be returning here again the next time I'm craving ramen.
2018-03-25,3,Decent bubble tea chain and the oldest bubble tea location in Hoboken. The price, quality, and variety are basically average for bubble tea. Of their offered "snacks" I've had a few and they are much better then what you'd expect from a place that specializes in beverages. I still come back here from time to time and will continue to do so in the future. Their atmosphere is fine, and their business hours start quite late for a caffeinated beverage store. Sound decent? They are. But the reason they deserve three stars is that there is much lacking there that other bubble tea places offer. Prices could be improved, hours could be earlier, they could have a greater selection (there are some bubble tea staples that they are missing), service could be faster (takes ages if there is even a short line). Also their almond bubble tea is foul tasting. Anyhow I still go here from time to time for their bubble tea and for some snacks, if you must have bubble tea and can't be bothered to go far from the PATH, Vivis is a good option.
2018-03-15,1,Disgusting!!!! The ramen here tastes like someone soaked their socks in water and served it to us.  I was extremely embarrassed that the person with me also had to experience this nasty food.  It was almost insulting that someone can serve you food like that and expect to take your money.  I am not sure how this place is still in business. There are a 1000 ramen places better than this in New York and New Jersey, and anyone who has ever had ramen anywhere else will know that ramen here is of poor quality. Didn't even bother trying the bubble tea because the ramen was so disgusting. If your bubble tea is any good, stick to that and take the ramen off your menu, please. Please.
2018-03-11,1,Came here with some friends from Los Angeles and I must say, initially I thought the place was cute but had a disappointing encounter with the rude cashier, Jessica. I wish I could have counted how many eye rolls and sighs there were when I was ordering. I sincerely felt like I inconvenienced her for asking what size my jasmine green tea would be and if it could be lightly sweetened. Jessica: *sigh* 30,50, or 70%. My tea was ok but the veggie ramen was mediocre.
2018-02-25,5,My favorite place to eat! The food is amazing quality and tastes great, plus the proportions are super filling! The place looks amazing and very comfortable and music is great. Overall I would highly recommend.
2018-02-22,3,It won't definitely be my first choice of bubble tea in Hoboken. I would choose Kung Fu tea above VIvi. But Kung Fu tea already have very terrible bubble tea, but vivi is worse... it makes me feel like I am drinking the fake bubble tea from China, instead the real bubble tea from Taiwan... the only reason I came here it's because their Taiwanese food is good. I mean, almost close to the Taiwanese food, almost... but they offer very cheap price which is very nice. I might still come here again if my friend wants to go... so I will still give them 3 Stars.
2018-02-16,3,Food is good kudos to the crew in the kitchen... but as for the girls up front, they can only be described by a word that rhymes with witches. Just plain rude and no customer service skills. Been coming to this location often and they've been needing an attitude adjustment since the beginning or a brain transplant. Just to be clear food and drinks are good but I hope management does something about the customer service aspect of it.
2018-02-16,4,A great franchise establishment in town, folks that adore bubble tea, this is the place to enjoy a hot or cold cup of tea with or without tapioca. They offer japanese matcha  and the drinks normally runs around $3.50 for a medium and $4.50 for a large. If you're not into milk tea ask for their Galaxy Drink $5.50 which is a sweet and sour drink and it comes with or without tapioca. Keep in mind there is a $10 minimum for credit, the ramen run around $9.95 and up, the rice bowls run $7.95 and up and I love their Taiwanese sausage $2.95 and their wings. There is a bathroom and bike and car parking are available. They also offer WiFi to their customers which is bubbletea , if you're in the mood for spare ribs it's only under $10 which comes with rice corn and this vegetable which looks like asparagus and a pepper but tastes more like a string bean.
2018-02-12,3,Really good ramen joint. I got the Tonkotsu Black Ramen which was super flavorful. My wife got the Vivi Shoyu which she enjoyed but after trying my Tonkotsu, she mentioned she liked mine more. It has a wide variety of Bubble Teas and treats. My biggest complaint was the wait. We came in for lunch and ordered to go. From the moment we placed our order (12:19pm) to the moment I actually received my order was (12:45pm) was 26 minutes! Now I know this isn't exactly fast food but it does offer carry out. I was amazed at how long it took. Here's the thing, I'll go back because the Ramen was good. But I'll do it on a day in which I don't need to get anywhere super fast.
2018-01-26,4,Came in for the ramen. Considering it doesn't look like their key food item, it was fantastic.  I can't give then 5 stars since I didn't have the bubble tea.  Had the tonkostu black ramen.  The pork was probably not pork belly , but nonetheless was delicious. It melted in your mouth. The soft boiled egg was cooked to perfection and was warm in the soup. It also had seaweed, corn and a fresh fishcake.  The broth was dark and rich like you would expect.
2018-01-24,3,Amazing food but horrible customer service. Waitresses need to be a little more friendly to people because their attitude spoils the amazing food that they have.
2018-01-03,1,We didn't try the bubble tea.  Only ramen noodles: chicken was like china town chicken- old and questionable that it was even chicken.  It didn't smell fresh but instead had a strong bad odor, along with the bad taste.  The vegetarian bowl had seeweed which made the smell very potent and an unnecessary ingredient added with mushroom which also contributed to the intense smell.  I am definitely not coming back here and sticking with the ramen in NYC.  Also watch your step leaving the restaurant.
2017-12-13,2,I've come here a couple of times. The ramen was just OK, not delicious. The ingredients used were questionable. The bubble tea was tasty but too sweet. Good staff, pricey menu.
2017-11-26,1,This place is very kid unfriendly. I'm trying to take some food in for my 3yo son since he can't eat anything from here (fried chicken, bubble tea, etc.) but they wouldn't make exception for the kid and would rather let him starve. We all had to leave because of that. Definitely not coming back again!
2017-11-25,4,Their appetizers and bubble tea are both fantastic.  I particularly like the fried popcorn chicken appetizer, which come in several different flavors. That being said, the ramen is pretty bland.  It's not bad, but just bland.  That's probably a good thing, because otherwise I would be here every day.
2017-11-08,1,I ordered three large milk tea online (two taro and one red bean macha), but when I went back home, I found that they only gave me a medium taro milk tea and I dont know why. It was so disappointed, I strongly suggest you to check your food before leaving.
2017-10-16,2,******UPDATE******She asked me if I wanna change my order when she saw me open Yelp. So I'm giving you another star for the effort.*******From five to 5 stars to 1***********OCTOBER 16,2017 4:30 PMThe first time that I was disappointed with VIVI. I had a strong feeling that my order will not be right since the cashier was the grumpy, snob and irritating cashier. Then I was right!!! All they want is money. They don't care if they give you your right order or not, all they care is money!!! So disappointed!!! They tried to argue at me because she said I ordered MILK TEA instead of MANGO TEA that I always get. I SAID MANGO TEA TWICE then she asked you want BLACK TEA? So I THOUGHT THEY CAN DO THAT SINCE I PREFER BLACK TEA MORE THAN GREEN. THEN THEY GAVE MILK TEA WHICK I REALLY WOULDNT DRINK BECAUSE I ALWAYS GET AN UPSET STOMACH AND A HEADACHE WITH THAT. But hell I was wrong. ANYBODY CAN RECOMMEND ME A NEW PLACE AROUND HERE? I PREFERRED VIVI AT FIRST SINCE MY FRIEND INTRODUCED ME HERE. But I don't wanna come here anymore. ************got the Pork Chasu Rice Bowl and my everyday favorite (I would die not having it atleast 4 times a week) Mango Tea with Lychee jelly with 30% sugar, bomb bomb bomb!!!! Although I didn't like their Tonkotso Miso Ramen Noodle that I tried before but it wasn't the worst, I just tried better ones. Also, my cashier and tea-maker Nikka was ncie which was a plus, amidst of her rude co-workers which I am not even going to ask their names, they are just rude. Plus the not so old guy tho send the food put is very nice. I had their edamame too which Nikka was very kind to show me how bid the container was before I ordered it. I had their edamame just to have something to chew on while I'm studying. Love love Vivi!! Their Popcorn chicken is also yummy! I tried their Soy Garlic and the Spicy one. I also tried their Takoyaki mygod HEAVEN ON EARTH!
2017-10-12,5,I went to Vivi to get some ramen.  The Shoyu ramen is my absolute favorite in Hoboken.  It's always a large soup that's good for the soul... Especially when I am sick!  Not knowing anything about the spicy levels, I asked for the Fireball version.  Boy was I happy.  I was coughing, crying and all of my sick germs went away and my congestion cleared up.  Turns out fireball means that they put ghost pepper sauce!  This was beyond spicy and so good.  The server there noticed how intense it made me feel and brought over ice water, so nice of her!  I will be back!
2017-10-08,4,Boba tea and ramen?!? YES please!   I became a fan of ViVi's boba tea when I visited a location in Chicago.  This location serves ramen too!  Pretty good ramen at that!Perfect combo!
2017-10-06,4,They take their time to make the ramen, but the end result is worth the wait. Medium hot was probably a bit above the medium on my scale, but worked perfectly as a hangover cure!
2017-09-29,4,Great bubble tea! They have a nice variety of milk and regular bubble teas.I really like how you can specify how much sugar your bubble tea will contain. For example, I requested 30% sugar for my Thai iced tea- bubble tea. Even with only 30% sugar, the tea was still a tad too sweet. I wish they had either a 10% or 20% sugar option, which would make the tea perfect!The teas are reasonably priced, below $5 and the service is very quick. Highly recommend for bubble tea!
2017-09-21,2,Need better ac, this place is always so hot like an oven during the non winter months that's ahh I never go anymore
2017-08-05,3,This was my initial visit to any ViVi Bubble Tea. In all honesty, I'd probably rate Vivi higher, but I'd tried Boba Guys beforehand and was still fixated on that bubble tea. Sorry ViVi. I had the medium passion fruit green tea with bubbles ($3.50). It was good (reasonable amount of boba that had a pleasant texture and taste) but indistinguishable from the places I go to that use powders. I wasn't asked about the sugar level that I wanted, but I overheard the cashier tell a customer after me that the level couldn't really be modified for this particular beverage. ViVi can be found all over the NYC area, it seems. I almost went to one in Manhattan that I passed going to the PATH. This location offers ramen which was intriguing and I don't think is available at the one nearest where I live.The woman taking my order was a low talker (like that Seinfeld episode), so it was hard to hear what she was saying when I asked what a QQ was. Plus she looked like she didn't like me very much. The $10 credit card minimum was a little annoying. Bathroom was totally fine.
2017-08-03,3,Obviously, they changed the design of the bottles. The large size bubble tea is slimmer but taller than before. The cashier told me it is the same size as previous version. In fact, it's 1-2oz less than 24oz (Stated in menu). It's a sign that the business is going down and they have to cut the cost. Will go to other places to buy the drink.
2017-07-30,1,I admit - food is fairly good. We got the Tonkatsu Black Ramen, Braised Pork Rice Bowl, and Takoyaki. Problem was we got charged for 2 bowls of the Ramen. When we went back to the cashier, she made us feel like it was our mistake, that she repeated the order 3 times, and didn't want to accommodate us.We're not the type to make a fuss, so we ended up saying that we'll take the 2nd order of ramen "to go".But here's our thinking. Maybe IT IS our mistake for not having heard the order repeated back to us. But if the order hasn't been prepared yet (as the server asked us while we're having our meal if they should prepare the take-out ramen order already), why not reverse the transaction for the 2nd ramen? The attitude of the lady behind the counter was obnoxious, and definitely didn't make us feel like our patronage is valued. The food, as mentioned, is not bad. But we'd rather go to a comparable (or better) ramen/boba place where we're made to feel our business is appreciated.Putting "all sales are final" on the receipt may be your rationale and escape clause, but just the same, you made us feel unwanted, if that matters to your establishment at all.
2017-07-18,4,This is the first place I've ever tried a Ramen Noodle bowl and I just found them a few months ago but I've already been here a few times for the spicy Vivi Shoyu and I must say, I like it a lot. It's quite tasty and filling. I've also had the strawberry bubble tea and liked that as well.
2017-07-10,4,This review is only for the rolled ice cream, which is great. A bit pricy but delicious! I have had the bad and boujee, the mango one, and the fruity pebbles one. All are great and its fun to watch your ice cream being made in front of you!
2017-07-07,5,Great tasting tea and nice atmosphere. They have appetizers and Ramen as well!!
2017-07-05,4,Love the mango tea here with bubbles.  The bubbles are usually a bit softer than the ones from Kung Fu, but come on- this place includes bubbles in their price of the tea AND has food.  We always come here for the various popcorn chicken flavors, the takoyaki, and the ramen.  You can add spice to your ramen which really isn't too spicy, it just adds flavor to your ramen.  It's not even as spicy as buffalo chicken.The only things I hate is that they don't have more seating and that there is a $10 minimum for credit cards.  It's also gotten noisier since they added the rolled ice cream cart.
2017-07-02,3,The ramen is good, but it's very expensive for what you get.  The people who work here are ok.  The machines they use for the tea are so loud you can't hear the person sitting next to you, which creates an unpleasant atmosphere.  The chairs are also uncomfortable so every time I come here I can't wait to leave, which is a problem for a restaurant.  At this point I will only order take out since I want to really limit how much time I spend in this place.
2017-06-05,4,Very nice place, very create, the only thing that I don't like was the desserts
2017-06-01,2,I hate to have to give this place 2 stars but due to the horrific cashier behind the counter of Asian decent being so rude and so unprofessional I will never go back to this specific location AGAIN! I like the food and the tea don't get me wrong but this place is chaotic and loud! I tried to place my order over the phone and could barely hear myself talk! To make things worse they wouldn't deliver to me because I was a few blocks away from where the driver wanted to go so I had to get an uber to pick it up. I got my order and one of the drinks was wrong, I told the one very small, pale, Chinese girl working yesterday evening that was also answering the phones, that she messed up on one of my drinks, all she had to do was apologise and fix it! Instead she began to scream at me and tell me it was my fault! I was in total shock that this girl thinks it's okay to shout at a paying customer and engage in an argument! Had I done that working in hospitality I'd lose my job! I was spending quite a bit of money as well! She seems to not realise that it's the customer that gives her a pay check every week! So after arguing with me and ruining my day she then starts to count some macaroons that I ordered which were about 9, she specifically said to me " stop talking!" "You're making me mess up your cookies!" It was the most unpleasant and unprofessional place you could imagine! The loudness didn't help either.. I was very VERY angry and shocked and the lack of courtesy.. not even a "thank you". I recommend to anyone trying this place to try a different location as this one in Hoboken is horrible! If you want to stop for bubble tea and be in the midst of chaos and rude people that don't appreciate your business then go here! For me it was the first and LAST TIME!
2017-05-26,3,So during my visit here, I only purchased their bubble tea, so I can't speak for their food. There are many different various types of bubble teas including milk teas, slushes, and yakults. Their menu offers a wide variety of ramens, appetizers, and a free standing set up of rolled ice cream near the entrance. The store front is quite large for Hoboken, and cute. It offers many tables and chairs, and a cute sofa in the back. only downfall is there is no set line, so people just stand wherever, and blocks the way people walk. Another pet peeve that I have is you have a line forming out the door, but there is only one person running the register, so it took me 25 mins to get a mango ice tea w/ babo, which is quite long. I'll probably be back if there is no line present next time.
2017-05-23,5,Best bubble tea place to go to and great variety of macarons, I always go there after school just to get some bubble tea and great service
2017-05-17,3,I am Chinese and grew up with bubble tea. The bubble tea here is good but a bit pricey, $3.99 for a 8 oz. And the bubbles are small, not the gigantic one. The Taro slush bubble tea from NK frozen yogurt cafe in Hoboken is way better deal in both price and quality. I only tried the Rice with Braised meat, which is way too salty and oily meat (made with pork belly). I will go back to try their popcorn chicken, hope will not disappoint me.
2017-04-30,5,We've only had the bubble tea and really, really like it. We haven't tried the various Asian dishes but they look and smell delicious. If you're searching for bubble tea in Hoboken, this place is the best of the lot. Recommended: the strawberry, matcha and ginger teas with tapioca bubbles, of course.
2017-04-26,5,I work around the area in union city and jersey city. I've been here at least once a month since they've opened 2 years ago. My go to is always Passion fruit tea and tonkotsu red ramen. It's filling and delicious. I usually stick to the flavored teas since I don't like creamy drinks as much. The bubbles are perfect, chewy and sweet.
2017-04-26,3,great bubble tea, but the staff's attitude not really good. I will give 5 stars if they could at least appear to be more friendly to their customers.
2017-04-18,2,Got the peach bubble tea... Tasted good but half way heading home I caught a bug in there. Felt sick noticing it. I would of returned it but I was 15 mins away already. Disappointed after seeing this place had 5 stars. Cups are sealed so the bug was there when they were making it.
2017-04-02,3,Been coming here since they open. The service has never been friendly. They are like robots, just take orders and make drinks, don't bother to say hi or thank you to them or smile, there's no response. One day the cashier took my order wrong and gave me the wrong drink. Instead of making a new one, they took the wrong one with the same drink base that I ordered and add the missing ingredients and also charge me for the difference. Seriously. I hope there are more and more bubble tea places open up so we don't have endure this kind of service.
2017-03-19,5,Things move a little slow there bit absolutely worth the wait, delicious noodle soups,bubble tea and sweets. Small expensive cookies but worth it.
2017-03-17,4,Best popcorn chicken ever! Good bubble tea. Lost one star because this location is more expensive compared to other locations.
2017-03-16,5,Great great Vegetarian ramen! (Would be perfection of they add tofu to the menu) but very filling as is!!! Fresh mushrooms,onions, corn, and in the coty they also have avocado! Hot Coconut black bubble tea is amazing-especially not too sweet!We love this decently priced lunch-$33 for two people! Yum!
2017-03-16,3,I love taro smoothie with bubbles. Unfortunately I have yet to find as good of a taro bubble smoothie as in Iowa City, Iowa. Vivi was OK. I was not very impressed with my bubble tea compared to other places I have been. The ten dollar credit card minimum is also a pain.
2017-03-10,4,Can't speak for the food  and from some the the reviews that seems iffy, but the bubble tea itself is nice, and since that's the name I'm glad that is the focus. This place isn't that big, so there are a few tables and a couple couches. I wonder if people stay at those tables a while, because it would be annoying if I wanted some ramen to eat it in the only available seating area, the couch. I know they do the best they can with the space they have, but I wonder if the comfy couches might be better taken out and adding more tables/chairs.I just had a bubble milk black tea, which met my expectations. Good flavor and nice chewy tapioca. $10 minimum for credit which is annoying. I don't see myself ever paying more than $10 at once here. Cute atmosphere and good bubble tea so I recommend.
2017-02-25,3,Good bubble tea and pop corn chicken. Will try their ramen next timeOk I returned for the ramen and it was no good! Tonkotsu ramen has no bone and meat taste in the broth. And they have the gut to charge $13
2017-02-25,3,The bubble tea and soups here are good but the hours are terrible.  Even if you get there at noon, they are not prepared and I've ended up waiting for them to brew my tea (on multiple occasions).  Hoboken is an early town, so I really find the hours annoying.
2017-02-06,3,It seems like Vivi is popping up everywhere! This is the first time I've seen a Vivi with rice bowls and ramen so I decided to give it a try for lunch. Not many places offer ramen to go so I was interested to see how this was going to taste. There was a big lunch crowd around 12:30PM eating in and a bunch of people near the back waiting for their take-out. Drinks were made near the cashier and came out a lot quicker than the food. They do offer pre-orders so I'll do that next time. Luckily there was a couch in the back with cute macaron plushies so my co-workers and I waited there for our food! We were given a pint container of the soup and a bowl with our order. I got the Vivi Shoyu which included 3 thick slices of chicken char siu, julienned seaweed, wood ear mushrooms, half an egg, curly ramen noodles, roasted seaweed, and topped with a lot of scallions! The broth was average and pretty light. For $10, ramen to-go, and in Hoboken - this is not a bad deal!
2017-02-04,3,The place is nice and food is decent but the attitudes of the staff needs to change. If you do not trust people then don't open  restaurant in Hoboken. It seems this staff has other ideas what the people who frequent this place are and talk Mandarin against them. Even the food is good change the staffs attitudes and this place could be #1 in Boken.
2017-01-15,4,Service is fast and efficient.  Great Bubble tea amd macaroons.  Ramens are just ok.  There's restroom in the back if needed.
2017-01-11,3,meh.I've never been to this place but I've ordered take-out. If you're really hungry you'll like it.
2017-01-07,4,I went there for the Ramen and was positively impressed. The broth was delicious and so was the pork. The macarons were not fresh, better get the fresh ones from Macaron Cafe in NY.
2016-11-29,3,Normal bubble tea place. No soy options - disappointing. Charges for large if you want hot - only one size for hot drink. I asked for no sugar in my almond milk tea. They have a frequent flier card.
2016-11-20,3,I'm still looking for bubble tea as good as all the chains in California. The original tea and the boba here are not that great, but it's the best in Hoboken when I need my fix.
2016-11-19,1,Can't even get anything customized.  How hard is it to make almond slush?  FAIL.  Kung Fu tea is way better with more choices.
2016-10-28,4,Hoboken has zero places that offer ramen noodles and rice bowls. Coming to ViVi I had high expectations since I heard a ton of great reviews from friends.It hit those expectations.I got the chicken teriyaki rice bowl and seaweed salad and both tasted excellent. The chicken teriyaki rice bowl had a ton of flavor with the sticky rice, corn, egg, and chicken.  My only wish was that he portion of chicken was slightly larger! The food was neatly presented too in the big bowl. It really had that Japanese touch. The seaweed salad had that strong distinct green taste that makes seafood such a unique flavor. It was very good as well.Will definitely be coming back here next time to try the Ramen noodles as the bowls look like they have an excellent broth!
2016-10-17,1,My favorite bubble tea spot'! - I DONT THINK SO!! Rude manager on duty.. I ordered something honey tea which was $3 some change. took about 7 mins to be made and picked it up at the "pick up" station. It was SUPER HOT and SWEET I couldn't BARELY enjoy my tea! I asked for less SUGAR "manager" -  tea is sweet. but this tea was super SWEET and HOT! i asked the manager cashier lady if I could get a new drink. I'm sorry sir all final sales! Okay I'm not asking for my money BACK I asked for a new drink! what kind of establish is this!! IM A CUSTOMER!! btw Starbucks gives out receipts no matter what ms manager!! As per your customer your service SUCKS! Girl making the drinks throws  spoons on the sink loudly so many times! you can't just placed it nicely when your 2 inches away! Please make your customer PROUD!
2016-10-05,5,I've only had the bubble tea here, but it was good! The staff is friendly, and there are plenty of places to sit and relax while you're waiting for your tea or food. I took a seat on the couch and snagged some free wifi. The ramen that the folks next to me had smelled delicious! I'll definitely be back!
2016-09-20,4,The bubble tea is great and the food is alright. Not the best ramen I've tasted, but its alright for a bubble tea spot.
2016-09-08,1,Obnoxious/ rude service and mediocre food. Was told it is normal to wait 20 minutes for a to go order of dumplings. Unnecessary credit card minimums. Only reason to go is lack of better Asian food options in area.
2016-08-31,3,The bubble tea is great, but the food here is just average. The edamame was fine (how do you mess this up though, really...) the takoyaki was OK, but the ramen just did not deliver. I asked for mine to be less salty but it was still WAY oversalted, and not nearly as good as the other ramen joints in NYC. Maybe I set myself up for failure getting ramen at a bubble tea place, but still. Very disappointed by the food here. The restaurant itself is very cute, and I was hoping it could become a regular lunch spot, but the food is not good enough to permit a repeat visit. For dessert, we got the yakult and taro slush bubble tea and they were great! I would come back just for the bubble tea.Overall, this place could probably satisfy your ramen cravings, but I would travel further for better ramen. Come here for bubble tea, not lunch! 3.5 stars.
2016-08-30,3,Vivi's taro slush with nata jelly is a must.. definite go to. I've tried their almond bubble tea, and tbh it was a complete let down. The girl said it's a lot like almond milk... I'm not quiet sure what kind of almond milk she's been drinking, but that was not an accurate description. Still bias and partial to Boba land's bubble tea up in palisades park, so no other places will live up to it, but Vivi's offers nata jelly that isn't found in all bubble tea joints, which is a huge plus. Not quiet sure how their food is, but always been interested in trying. Cute atmosphere and decent seating if you're planning on sitting and enjoying your drinks with friends.
2016-08-25,5,Back when I lived in Manhattan, Le Man and I would visit Vivi's every chance we got.  We walked to their Chelsea or Hell's Kitchen locations whenever we needed a fix and the tea is always so good. Vivi's boba doesn't just taste like sugar and cream, but has this rich black tea taste that is heavenly and refreshing.I recently moved across the Hudson and I thought my days of enjoying Vivi's was over, but lo and behold I was able to Seamlessly order from Vivi's in Hoboken!! While there's a 20-dollar minimum, I didn't mind because I can order a tea for me, a tea for Le Man, some ramen and even a rice bowl if I felt really hungry.  All their products keep well in the refrigerator and I can enjoy Vivi's treats all day.  Plus, their delivery person (lady with medium length blonde locs) is super nice and professional.  I'm certainly addicted and will continue to enjoy my Vivi fix in Jersey!
2016-08-24,2,The tea is good. This is why I keep coming back. And the style is cute. However, we witnessed the cashier lady yell across the room "We have no ketchup here!! It does not come with the chicken and never will!" at a customer who was politely asking someone else if they had ketchup. Very scary!I have noticed their attitude in the past. I don't know if it's just a bad day but I hope customer service improves at this location!I definitely like the teas and wouldn't want to have to change to Kung fu tea down the street.
2016-08-15,4,Their bubble tea is delicious. We also order ramen from here a lot. And their popcorn chicken is addicting!!!
2016-08-04,5,Get the Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl with any drink you like and you can't go wrong!
2016-07-19,1,They were so rude! They would reply in a rude manner when I asked questions and when I didn't know where the garbage was located. Also, their service was slow.
2016-07-17,1,I usually come here every Sunday because the ramen is ok and they are usually friendly. Today my wife I went there because she wanted ramen and I just wasn't feeling all the sodium. So I went next store and got something quick to go and met her back inside to eat quickly before we had to go to a concert. They where so rude to me and made such a huge seen because I had gotten something from outside and told me I he to leave. It wasn't busy and if they could of just told me nicely to leave that would have been a problem. I see these people once a week and just wanted to have been treated like a human. I had to sit on the steps of another building while my wife finished her meal inside. So embarrassing won't return again
2016-07-13,5,I've been going to Viva for about a year now and always get their Coconut Milk Tea. My fav. I went yesterday, Tuesday, 07/12/2016, and for the first time I sat down to eat a meal with my bubble tea. I had the Chicken teriyaki rice bowl. Wow. It was delicious. So filling. It as all good. I just loved it so much. Looking forward to my next visit. I will try their ramen noodle soup bowl next. I highly recommend Viva Bubble Tea. They are awesome. Can't wait to go back.
2016-07-13,5,Visiting from CA. Cute spot. Ordered the strawberry slush with tapioca and it was pretty good. Good service.
2016-07-12,4,I love Vivi, I wished I'd known about them and tried them much earlier. But better late than never! I consider their tea authentic and flavorful. My favorites are japanese matcha and taromilk tea. Best of all, tapioca pearls are free and included in the drinks already so that's a nice bonus!In addition to bubble tea they also serve food. I wholeheartedly recommend their popcorn chicken. Freshly fried with your choice of topping. I have tried the original salt and pepper, curry and also garlic and they have never disappointed.The ramen also seems to be a popular choice, though I have not tried it yet. This is a great place to hang out with nice wall decos, lots of greens, and super comfy couches with macaron cushions in every color! The pink themed bubble tea shop also entices me, since that is my favorite color. Whenever I am in the area I never fail to stop by Vivi.
2016-06-30,2,Came here with my boyfriend. One thing is that you need to bring cash. I only wanted one drink, but we ended up having 2 drinks due to the $10 minimum. Another thing is that you need to wait a really long time. We just ordered drinks and it takes forever. Mind you, there wasn't anyone ahead of us so it should be quick. But we waited a good 10-15 minutes. Highly doubt I'll ever come here again. The cashier should have a more pleasant attitude when greeting customers.
2016-06-30,1,Awful service, drinks take forever. Taste good enough but the line is long from slow cashiers and  the cashiers aren't helpful when asked questions about the menu. I've been here around 3 times and on the 3rd I was CENTS away from the credit card minimum and didn't have cash. The woman turned me away. Will no longer go here.
2016-06-17,3,Standard bubble tea joint in the heart of Hoboken with the standard drink menu. They do have small eats. I tried the Taiwanese sausage and the popcorn chicken, pretty good from a bubble tea place.I haven't tried their main dishes such as their Ramen, but the price looked pretty steep. They have stamp sheets so remember to ask for one when you are ordering a bubble tea and start collecting.
2016-06-15,3,Not sure I should be writing this review. I ordered Ramen from a Bubble Tea spot. I wonder if it's like ordering a steak from a Diner and expecting it to taste like Peter Lugers.  Anyway, one Tonkatsu Black and one Soy Garlic Popcorn Chicken was just delivered to my apartment.  Order was correct and it didn't take long. I've had Ramen in some really amazing places in Japan, NYC and Los Angeles.  Broth is essential and the Ramen broth here was bitter and salty. Couple the salty broth with equally salty charred  pork (Chashu) and it 's a big mess.  The SoY Garlic Popcorn Chicken was worth it.Also wish there was a choice of noodle but that's not a huge deal.
2016-06-09,5,Best bubble tea in town. Their fried chicken and bubble tea are amazing!!! Everything is made fresh daily, and great hangout spot!
2016-05-29,5,I love this place. Taiwanese Miso Ramen is fantastic.
2016-05-29,5,Love this spot! All of the bubble teas i have gotten have been delicious. I've also tried the ramen which was great as well. Everyone I bring to this spot ends up loving it and always wants to come back.
2016-05-22,4,Food was great tasting and delivery was quicker than expected. I love how they packaged my ramen and everything tasted so fresh. I wasn't too excited abotu my popcorn chicken - I had the garlic, but perhaps another flavor is better - it was just fine. Overall, I will definitely order again.
2016-05-16,5,I found this place with one of my Asian friends from California two months ago and found the market snacks to be AMAZE!!!  We were just going for tea but were tempted by the snacks.The potato shrimp and popcorn chicken are delicious!  Recently, I was back in Hoboken wth my wife and actually had a full late lunch!  I had the shoyu ramen and she had the roasted chicken rice bowl.  Both were excellent and we left super satisfied!  For $37 we split two market snacks and each had a bowl, with a milk boba tea and peach tea!!  Can't beat that and the food was great just like it was the first time!! Every time I'm back in Hoboken this will be a must stop for me!
2016-05-14,4,Updating my review.  Girls who work here have become sweeter.  It's welcome and I feel better about giving them my business.  Have ordered delivery a few times as well and it's nice to know I can get bubble tea delivered late at nite when I don't feel like going out.Still recommending the Ice Jelly pulps and chocoberry and cookie tea.Jelly pulps - grapefruit, orange or peach pulp with a sweet clear jelly.  Only cold.Chocoberry cookie - cashier tipped me off.  This boosted them up a star for this alone.  Thanks, the summer is coming and now I am fighting off basically crunched up Oreos in hot milk on a daily basis.Tried the jade lemonade and it was similar to the ice jelly, have to try it again before I decide if it's a go to.  The lemon flavors are a bit concentrated but a nice change.
2016-05-13,5,Love this place. Cozy atmosphere. Amazing bubble tea! And I loved their food as well! Freshly cooked and healthy:)
2016-05-01,3,Very good food and tea but the service was slow. I waited 45 minutes to get 2 ramens. Also the seating space is very limited.
2016-04-25,3,Food so good, service SO INCREDIBLY SLOW...We ordered the Pork ChaSiu Rice Bowl, the Popcorn Chicken, the Takoyaki, and a Passionfruit Yakult Boba Tea. The pork chasiu rice bowl was good, but if you're looking for something authentic tasting, this isn't it. The pork is a lot more reminiscent of Americanized barbecue meat rather than real Chasiu. The taste went well with the dish though, which also had seaweed flakes, half an egg, corn, spinach, and mayo. The mayo was a nice touch - giving it a nice and creamy consistency - and the dish was quite tasty.The popcorn chicken was also really good - your typical Asian fried chicken. We got the salt and pepper seasoning, which was simple but delicious. I'm not a fan of Takoyaki in general, but my boyfriend enjoyed it. My bubble tea was good, although not as yogurt/Yakult-y as I had imagined it would be. The bubbles had a nice sweet honey like flavor, which was nice, but they were sticking together a lot, making it difficult to drink/eat.The service - oh my gosh, so mind-numbingly slow. We ordered our food and drink at the counter and found a seat to eat in. We waited an HOUR for our food. Even my drink took 20 minutes to be ready. It was ridiculous. They were busy and were very backed up, which was understandable, but even after we went up to ask about our order twice, they didn't really seem to be hustling. It appeared to me that they were understaffed in terms of the staff cooking and serving the food, and the people making the drinks just seemed slow (and probably understaffed too...although it doesn't look like there would be much more space behind the counter for more people back there...) Who knows. In general, we were not happy with the service. At all.As for the look and feel of the place, I'm not really a fan of the cutesy theme. It's pink, and I like pink, but it's too pink.I do like the wall of green though - one of their walls is covered in shelves of greenery. Fake plants, but still a nice and refreshing for the eyes.They have a small outdoor seating area up front, which is nice, but it doesn't seem like the wait staff comes around to pick up after the customers and clean up tables frequently, so the tables aren't always clean/cleared.The inside of Vivi is small and can get pretty cramped depending on how busy it is. It smells very sweet in there, too - super strong smell.Overall, I felt very meh about this place. The only reason it got the third star is because the food was not bad.
2016-04-24,4,Mango bubble tea with tapioca amazing!!!!!!Spicy Ramen bowl keeps me warm and makes me feel good. Yum!
2016-04-18,4,Pretty good Bubble tea (Passion Fruit QQ) and snacks just like the Vivs in the city and with chic decor too...one star off for not so hospitable tea-istas and over 15 minutes for a large bubble tea on a Monday night.
2016-04-17,4,Great to have a bubble tea place in Hoboken. But they require a $10 minimum for credit cards if you want to stop in on a whim without having cash.
2016-04-17,2,Food taste was okay, food waiting time was at least 20mins.  Drinks were too sweet, service was average.
2016-04-09,1,I've been here before and thought it was a great addition to town but have had an abysmal experience with delivery. Most recent order took two hours because the delivery service lost track of it.  When I called to inquire it took 20 min for Vivi staff to get in touch w the delivery service. By the time the food arrived it was cold. Customer service throughout was horrendous and the restaurant refused to take responsibility for the issue.  We've got plenty of great restaurants in town with fantastic customer service - I wouldn't bother w delivery here and won't be going back.
2016-03-20,5,Love this place so much that I literally salivate just thinking of their popcorn chicken. I always get the original flavor and have never been disappointed. Their bubble tea is always on point and the bubbles are perfect! Not too sweet or tasteless, just right all the time. So excited they opened up this location in Hoboken so now I don't have to go all the way to the city for some good bubble tea!
2016-03-19,1,Really unfortunate that a place as good as this has a pretty disrespectful cashier. Asked for a hot milk tea and they served it cold. The cashier then went to accuse me of ordering it cold when I simply requested it just be heated. She then refused to do so unless I pay an extra fee, and made the experience very unpleasant and embarrassed me in front of other customers about how "I was wrong".
2016-03-16,4,This review is for the ramen, which is excellent! I have had the Vivi Shoyu and the Tonkatsu Miso (pictured).The ease of parking on Washington, ordering at the counter, and seating myself at any table makes for a quick, but fulfilling ramen meal. I am always served quickly; I've finished a whole bowl while only paying 30 minutes for street parking. The broth is full of flavor and the meat has always been tender, melt-in-your-mouth savory. The portions are great (and I eat a lot!) I did order extra noodles once and felt extremely full, so the bowl itself is just right. The price is good and definitely beats the $16 bowls for less portion in the city.-1 star for the decor. The place is bright, pink & white, and just gives off a cutesy/cheesy vibe. Not an ideal romantic date night. Seems to cater to a younger crowd, as I see school kids stopping by for bubble tea. Personally not my style, but it is definitely unique. Upon first impression, I would not expect this place to serve such delicious, hearty ramen! Highly recommend to try.
2016-03-12,5,Delicious! Finally, excellent ramen delivered to my house. Salt and pepper popcorn chicken was a revelation, and the takoyaki was crispy on the outside and chewy and octopussy on the inside. Mmmm.
2016-02-19,5,Great bubble tea, match lattes and I really enjoy their tonkotsu ramen. Their ramen is flavorful and has fresh ingredients.
2016-02-15,3,I only tried their cold & hot bubble tea here and I loved them! Wouldn't have thought that the hot taro bubble tea would taste great, but it did! I would definitely get it again next time as well as try their hot foods.I took off two stars because it took about 12 minutes to get our two drinks we ordered and I've been here many times and the employees do not seem so nice.I would recommend Kung Fu Tea that recently opened up in Hoboken for Bubble tea & Desserts instead. They are much nicer and the place is cleaner! I also believe the bubble tea is a little cheaper too.
2016-02-06,5,Great addition to Hoboken. I come here a lot for bubble tea and popcorn chicken (max spicy). It's so hot and delicious. I've had the ramen and its good but not really my thing. The Taiwanese sausage is pretty good too. If you don't like your milk tea to be too sweet, make sure to ask for what level you want (I.e. 50% sugar or 75% sugar). Enjoy!
2016-01-21,5,The best bubble tea, no question about it. I had the ramen such was great also. Very stylish and fun environment and the staff is nice. No complaints I highly recommend the place.
2016-01-16,5,Tried this bubble tea joint in multiple locations and I must say, it was delightful! I loved the coconut milk tea. They have a huge variety of drinks such as milk tea, just milk, smoothies and yogurt drinks. My husband likes the jelly but I like the classic bubbles. Now we make it a habit to stop here if we see one! Yum yum yum! Tried a few other bubble tea places and they were not even close to this quality. If you like bubble tea, I recommend you try it here!
2016-01-08,5,Best chocolate bubble tea ever! Fresh, tasty, terrific.The chicken wings on also beyond average level. Way better than chicken-filla or pop-eyes at the very least.The music there is also quite good. : )
2016-01-03,4,Ordered the spicy Tonkotsu Ramen. Lots of toppings, not super salty, and very large portions. I could hardly finish my bowl. My son usually gets the Shoyu Ramen with the toppings on the side and loves it! The taro milk tea was delicious. Not too many local places that serve authentic ramen. I highly recommend Vivi's.
2016-01-01,1,I really don't like the bubble tea from this place. I ordered the milk green tea and it just tasted like straight leaves with no sugar. I enjoy Babos in downtown jersey city much better. I had high hopes for this place because they offer pudding, something most places do not, but the drink was still horrible. The tapioca wasn't anything special at all. Babos' tapioca is much better and sweeter.
2015-12-21,5,Amazing place and owners !!!! Work down the street from this super cute location and get a bubble tea from them once a week and it's always super yummy and the owners are so sweet and genuinely care about their customers !!! Great place
2015-12-20,5,So my best friend and I read the reviews before coming here from most of the "elite" Yelper's who stated that the ramen is "salty" ... Maybe they're salty because they lack taste. Or maybe the restaurant read the reviews and updated the recipe lol but either way , being Hispanic ... I KNOW when food is too salty lol. This ramen was great and under $10. Well $11 if you do count with the tax lol. But this ramen was amazing I had the Shoyu Ramen (spicy) and my friend had the Tonkotsu Ramen . Personally I don't like corn so I wouldn't have that one but I loved the broth on that one. Mine was perfect in the aspect of sodium levels lol. But I had your basic default spicy ramen. The place is beautiful and small. Love the decor. The reviews here by those elite members are misleading. You should try the food here before judging. We were afraid to try but we decided "fluff it" you should always try something once. Anyway love the Ramen. Loved the taro tea. ( popcorn chicken... Meh.. Lol it was okay) but ramen and tea AMAZING! You should try this place !
2015-12-20,4,Staff is friendly and they have a good variety of beverages (and add-ons) to choose from - slushes, milk teas, fruit teas, etc. A little overwhelming at first, but they're willing to assist with choosing what to drink.They have machines to help with shaking the beverages for mixture and to seal the cups. I have always gotten the fruit teas, and they're always sweet and tasty!I have not personally eaten the food snacks that are also now available (chicken wings, ramen, etc.) but I've heard from friends that they're pretty good. On my next visit, I'll probably give it a try!
2015-12-12,1,When Vivis first opened up in Hoboken I was ecstatic. Finally a place dedicated to bubble tea. I've been several times and each time it's less fulfilling than the time before that.  For starters the bubbles are mushy, good bubbles are essential to the bubble tea experience. They need to have the right chewiness and the right sugar level. Ive ordered several drinks and have asked for a variety of sugar levels and still feel each drink is too sweet and not enough tea.  Its like drinking sugar water lightly flavored with tea.The decor could use some work, the bright florescent lights make you feel like you're walking into a dingy gas station. And where the food comes out is inconveniently placed far away from the drink counter. Where if you're standing when they blend your drink you can't hear anything being called out.The service is mediocre at best, I've gone when it's super busy and also when it's empty and no matter what, they can't seem to keep track of who ordered what.
2015-12-06,5,I made a visit to Vivi's last night with my girls and it was amazing! I had the chocolate bubble tea w/tapioca and it was  delightful and creamy. I also had the vegetable ramen, man oh man! The broth was superb and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection! When you go ask for Fu and tell him I sent ya!
2015-12-04,3,The ramen soup base has gotten too salty.  They also just jumped their prices on food items.  Everything else is good but with the food quality and increase of price I'm not sure if it's worth it anymore.
2015-10-14,1,They don't take credit cards under a $10 total. Is the year 2015 or am I mistaken? I LITERALLY WALKED OUT THE DOOR OF THIS PLACE BECAUSE I HAD NO OTHER WAY OF PAYING. Imagine how much business Dunkin Donuts would lose if they had a $10 minimum...as a restaurant with all of your drinks under $10 and all of the food items under $10, I absolutely abhor the outdated, senile management of this place. If you wanna survive jn Hoboken, maybe you shouldn't have a policy that turns away excited customers.
2015-10-07,1,My daughter ordered Tiramisu Milk Tea, but did not like it.  When I returned it and asked for a bottle of spring water instead, they gave us a cup of faucet water and did not offer any refund.  Food was OK, but service suck!
2015-09-25,5,Excellent Taiwanese tonkotsu, yes not tonkatsu, miso soup great taste, didn't come here for the tea, the noodle dishes are awesome!
2015-09-19,5,This is a cute little spot.  The bubble tea is just right.  I got the jasmine green tea bubble tea and it wasn't too sweet,  which I appreciate.  The bubbles were chewy and just perfect.  They weren't too big or too small. The staff there were friendly and prompt as well.  I'll definitely be back.
2015-09-13,4,Came here while visiting Hoboken with my girlfriend.  Glad a small town such as Hoboken has a bubble tea place since they are everywhere in Manhattan, BK, and surrounding areas. This place is very very clean,  there is a nice and friendly wait staff,  affordable pricing and a great selection. Bubble tea is typically very standardized,  but what sticks out about this place is how clean it is, it's air conditioned well(which on a hot summer day is nice), a few tables with two couches as well.
2015-09-08,4,I'm a big fan of Vivi, frequenting the NY locations at least once a week, travel schedule provided. Thus, I was thrilled to pass one while exploring Hoboken with a friend this past weekend. This location is like the others, with the same menu and the main exception being that it's far larger, with more seating, and I believe, upon further inspection, a few more food options.I got my usual - 3Q milk tea, light ice. The drink was made well, tasted as it was expected, but the wait seemed long for a relatively short line.
2015-09-07,3,Came here on a super hot day in Hoboken with my boyfriend. We were tired and wanted a place to sit and have some refreshment. We had the peach tea with jelly and I had the taro milk tea with bubbles. They were both very great. We enjoyed our drinks and we stayed in the lounge area. We liked the nice lounge and they had WiFi and plenty of outlets. It would be a great place to lounge and do work. I go to many vivi cafes before and this definitely is the best one to go to.
2015-09-07,1,Way too salty, barely edible! Food takes forever to come out (so you have to order a boba while you wait probably).  And it smells awful inside, like unbearable and nauseating.  I see a ton of Asians going here so we figured it would be good, but their ramen was awful and their dumplings were foul. Avoid this place unless you like overpriced boba tea.
2015-09-06,5,One of the representations of Hoboken's greatness comes in the form of this splendid boba shop. This Taiwan pearl milk tea has expanded itself onto 20 locations and mainly can be found in New York, so the fact that it's blessed itself onto Hoboken, it makes Jersey pretty lucky. Vivi has an extensive tea selection along with macaroons, slush, milk teas, Taiwan snacks and most of it's consumers are repetitive due to the fact that you can't really find that many almond milk tea with royal jelly and aloe. If you haven't been to this place then I heavily recommend it and keep trying out different teas/ toppings until you find the one that appeals to you the most. Recommended paid dues goes out to the orange kiss refreshing jelly drink, along with japanese matcha milk tea with boba, or taro with royal jelly. Honestly the recommendations are endless so I suggest sneak peaking their menu before a selection is chosen: vivibubbletea.com/produc...Boba tea rules and if you haven't tried it yet then what are you waiting for? Summer is the perfect time to freshen out and drink as many teas as possible! Another fact that makes this place epic is that you can choose your sugar content on drinks so you can still have control over your health while enjoying different teas! Salute!
2015-09-01,5,I'm obsessed with Vivi bubble tea. I live right down the street from the Hoboken location and go almost every day after work. The girls behind the counter are the absolute sweetest - they have their bubble tea making down to a science, so you are in and out enjoying your bevi in no time! I've yet to try to food there, but every time I go in and people are sitting down to eat, the food smells and looks really good.I didn't even realize it was a chain, but there are a few locations in the city as well.
2015-08-30,4,Nice to see Vivi spreading into NJ.  They are a Taiwanese chain which makes them a legit bubble tea maker.  I've been to a couple Vivi locations in the city and I have found the bubble tea consistently good.  Same goes for this location.  What is great about Vivi is that you can specify sweetness and ice level.  The bubbles have the right consistency.  They have a variety of flavors which don't have that artificial taste.Most recently I had the passion fruit QQ, 50% sweet.  Comes with boba and jellies.  Refreshing and  thirst quenching on a hot day.  Despite it being 50% sweet it was still too sweet for me.  I feel anything juice based will always be sweet. Will have to try 25%.What's different about this Vivi is that is serves food and snacks.  Not sure I would come here specifically for food but would give their Taiwanese snacks a try. Service is friendly.
2015-08-23,5,This place is amazing. I've been there several times and each time, their food and service has been on point. Their ramen never disappoints and they don't have 'bad' or 'off' days. They're experts at this and every time I go there, I know my ramen will be cooked to delicious perfection. Their jasmine bubble tea is PERFECT. Seriously, the best bubble tea I've had! Oh, and the prices are great considering the quality of the food.
2015-08-15,3,If this is your first time trying Vivi, either get the red bean matcha or the Japanese matcha milk teas with pearls. You won't regret it, I swear!!!!!! I had the green milk tea with boba the first time I ever went and completely regretted it. It tasted like old tea and was pretty warm despite the regular ice level I got. The only thing that made it better, though, was the boba - it wasn't too chewy or too soft! My sister got the red moo and it is straight up milk with red beans ... If you like milk, go for it but what's the point? They don't even give you a lot of red bean! You can drink up all the red bean in a second. You'd be better off just having a glass of milk at home. Second time I got a drink here, I got the iced Japanese matcha with boba with 50% sweetness and less ice which was pretty damn good compared to my first drink.
2015-08-10,5,I have been here a few times and i always get the same green bubble tea with milk and its always consistent and good. They are fast and efficient so no complaints here. I have seen people eating there too, I haven't tried it yet but it looks pretty good.
2015-08-08,3,I love the cute small shop atmosphere and the selection of macarons! The bubble tea I ordered was delicious! I would definitely go back for the bubble tea and treats. I also got the popcorn chicken and thought it would be delicious but it was not that tasteful and the chicken was very rubbery. I actually was not feeling well after eating it. I will let go and come to terms that maybe bubble tea places just make good bubble tea haha.
2015-08-06,5,excellent! my husband and i just stopped in here one day while we were waiting for friends and i got a taro bubble tea and he got the wings. the bubble tea was made just the way i like it - not too sweet and a good tapioca pearl ratio. the wings he got were delicious! we were sad that we could not get a full meal because we had dinner plans but he's planning on going back to get an actual meal. delicious and will be going back to get more bubble tea!
2015-08-02,5,Great location! Great bubble tea, they are fast and they are diligent! it always taste good so I go often :)
2015-07-31,4,First time trying bubble tea here.  I got Taro slush with tapioca.  I like it since it's not too sweet.  Not a bad bubble tea.  Will try a different one next time! They made it fast as well.
2015-07-20,4,Have walked by this place a few times since it opened and was curious. I finally decided to give it a shot tonight on my way home from a bball game in the city. I got the Chicken Teryaki Rice Bowl to go. It was delicious and the service was great. Will definitely be going back for a quick, relatively healthy meal.
2015-07-17,5,I happened to be in Hoboken for dinner and noticed someone with a Vivi cup.  Being a bubbletea fanatic, I immediately searched to see if there was a location nearby (and indeed there was!).  This Vivi does not disappoint. As my friend said, "This is probably the biggest, most well decorated Vivi I've ever been in".  There is plenty of seating and there is a restroom for patrons.  In addition to the bubbletea and frozen/hot drinks, there's also a wide variety of food options such as popcorn chicken, wings and even ramen!  My friend noted that the prices are a little higher than other locations he's been in but I'm assuming that comes with the territory.  Now if only they opened one in Jersey City...
2015-07-15,4,Ordered a black milk tea with pudding, 70% sugar. Perfectly made, not too sweet, not too milky, and the pudding was delicious. Also got an order of the basil popcorn chicken-- flavorful, tender, and juicy. Definitely would come back to try the other popcorn chicken flavors and bubble teas!
2015-07-08,5,This place is sorely needed in Hoboken!  It's great to be able to get quality bubble tea without having to take a train to Manhattan or Flushing.  The place is cute, the service is friendly, but most importantly - their Grapefruit Bubble Tea is to die for!
2015-07-08,5,Yum! a friend brought me here because she is in love - and I am also! Delish tea, cute lounge seating in back, and yummy chicken poppers.
2015-07-07,5,I've been to quite a few bubble tea joints in my day but none like this. The establishment itself has a very welcoming and warm vibe to it, the temperature is always just right. The music is loud enough to be a soothing background noise but not loud enough to make conversing with someone next to you a hassle. I often find myself bringing my work to ViVis to sit down and enjoy a bowl of ramen and some bubble tea. The drinks for starters are very on point, the staff making them is not only friendly but are truly skilled in their craft. The tapioca balls are always fresh and perfect, by perfect I mean they are not too chewy, not too hard, not too soft. They are perfect just perfect. When you bite down and feel the tender and perfectly chewy ball collapse under the pressure of your teeth it leaves a very satisfying feeling. Unlike when you go to some places and chew down on a mooshy day old tapioca ball. The flavor of the tea is absolutely phenomenal, real tea leaves are brewed and the portions of flavoring mixed in the bubble tea is perfect. I've never had any excess powder or poorly mixed drinks at Vivis. Moving on, let's talk ramen. The ramen here is AMAZING. Should you try it ? YES. Will you love it? Probably, unless you are some unworldly being that doesn't like a flavorful dish with delicious vegetables, a deep bold flavored broth, and tender flavorful meat. Everything about the ramen served here is amazing. All of the toppings are a blessing. From the corn, sea kelp, earwood mushrooms, spinach,  naruto, pork/chicken chashu, to the ajitsuke. It is all packed with flavor that will leave your mouth watering and wanting more. The broth, meat, and noodles are the strongest points of Vivi's ramen. The broth has a deep bold flavor that pleases tastebuds from all corners of the tongue. The meat is full of flavor and is a joy to consume, my only wish was that my stomach could hold more of it. The noodles are always perfectly cooked and bring the flavorful broth, also known as 'The Nectar of the Gods, into your mouth with each bite and slurp. Give it a try, you won't regret it. My mouth is watering, guess I'm due for another bowl of ramen. Ring me up Vivi.
2015-07-06,5,I love you even more after discovering my new favorite cooling drink to beat the summer heat: medium-sized lychee frozen slushy without bubbles/tapioca and the key: 30% sugar (that way it is still plenty sweet and you taste the lychee better). Only advice: sip slowly to avoid 'ice cream headaches' :)
2015-06-30,4,Great service, superb bubble teas ( we had passion fruit, peach), and of course great ramen. We had tonkotsu ramen. A must try, and definitely worth going again..
2015-06-30,5,This is one of our favorite spots in Hoboken. The service is great and decor is welcoming. You can get a drink and some fried popcorn chicken and relax on their cute little couch area with all the MACARON pillows... Prices are a little bit more expensive than other Vivi's due to the great Hoboken location, but hey it's the same price as a frap. I plan to try all the different drinks on their menu some day!
2015-06-25,5,Love this place!  The bubble tea and drinks are very good,  natural light flavors. Had the veggie ramen was interesting with unique flavors. The seaweed salad was fresh.  Very nice staff,  clean environment,  cute place.  Only drawbacks: slightly  high prices and need to have better options for spicy sauce
2015-06-10,4,Vivi Bubble Tea can top any of the places that I've tried in Palisades Park. The flavor of the tea is just right and the FREE tapioca is not annoyingly too chewy. This place looks immaculate, truly delightful to the eye. The cleanliness and work flow is admirable. The small cartoon toys add a nice touch to the decor. The menu is totally easy to follow and the staff helps you with any doubt that you may have.I tried the grapefruit pulp bubble tea with tapioca. I enjoyed every sip of it. It tasted really natural and I think you would appreciate the cool art on the cup. I also tried my wife's coconut milk bubble tea. Sorry not a big fan but my wife loved it. Finally the salt and pepper popcorn chicken. The taste was ok but the presentation was very cool. I guess now I want to try the spicy version.I will be coming back for more and next time ramen is the next victim.
2015-06-08,4,Love small balls bursting in your mouth? Oh stop, get your head out of the gutter, I'm talking about Tapioca! FREE tapioca included with any drink.I like the fact that you can customize your drink to your liking. You can control your sugar level, great for diabetics and people watching there weight. You can choose no sugar, 30% less, 70%, regular or extra sugar. Even the ice is optional, less, regular or extra. These drinks are great for summer days or just to try something new. They are very refreshing and addicting. I like the Honey dew and matcha( green tea) so far, but there are plenty of flavors to satisfy everyone's taste buds.
2015-05-30,4,Visiting from LA & went here today. Got a taro milk tea with boba. I've had boba drinks from various places in the Arcadia area (near LA; has a rather large Asian population), so I think I've gotten a pretty good sense of what good boba is, and this is good boba. The tapioca is not too hard (common problem) or too soft (rare problem), and the drink is not too sweet or too bland. There could have been a bit more taro flavor in it for my taste, but overall quite good.
2015-05-24,4,Got the veggie ramen and kumquat lemon bubble tea while the boyfriend got the potato shrimp, dumplings, and almond milk bubble tea. The veggie ramen was just "okay" but the boyfriend loved the potato shrimp! And the bubble teas were on point. So glad we don't have to go all the way into the city for some good bubble tea anymore! The place is still pretty new so it can get quite crowded and the service gets backed up sometimes. Hopefully they work out the kinks with time.
2015-05-19,5,Ive always loved ViVi's around NYC. However, this Hoboken location is on point!!!! Came here several times already and their service/food/drinks = always very consistent!!! The owners are very nice as well. Also hands on and are super customer friendly!!The fave: black milk tea bubble tea, pretty much all their ramen. Did i say Ramen??! We met the owner and he really took the time to explain their homemade, well made, RAMEN!!!!! Takoyaki and the chicken!!!!!
2015-05-15,5,So glad ViVi came to Hoboken! I used to travel all the way to Chinatown NYC just to go to ViVi. I tried their ViVi Shoyu, a bit too salty but I enjoyed it. I usually get the chocolate milk tea and takoyaki, it didn't disappoint me at all. Really cute atmosphere and the tea baristas are very polite. Favorite place to stop now in Hoboken!
2015-05-14,5,From the week that they opened till now I can say that the food is fresh and has had the same great consistency. Recommend any of the slush bubble teas. Really refreshing during a spring day, and a even better day when trying to get over a hang over. The ramen is a must and the store isn't hot and humid, but cool and Ac up to the max. Happy day in hobo!
2015-05-02,5,Tasty Tonkastsu Ramen! Plenty of fixins and pork. Not as good as Ippudo but still tasty! Thank God something asian/different in Hobo than usual pub fare! Get the bubble tea! Amazing!
2015-05-01,5,Been here over 20 times (lost count really) for the ViVi Shoyu. Smooth broth (not as milky as tonkatsu with miso which I prefer). Ask for mild or regular spice for some real flare! The Shoyu here also comes with a lot more toppings than totto or ramen-ya's (famous ramen spots in the city). Bubble tea is good too but the real gem here is the Shoyu.Almost forgot to mention they actually offer ramen to go and separate the broth so it doesn't soak into the food. Worth noting since no other ramen store offers this and I prefer a quiet place to eat at times.The franchise ViVis is not related to the ramen. I don't recommend the ramen from ViVi chains in the city.
2015-04-24,5,Love the Ramen and the bubble tea!! I just get simple green tea w the bubbles, but I absolutely love it! Not to forget about the macaroons!!! They Nutella macaroon is out of this world!
2015-04-21,5,Been here 3 times now, plan to be here a ton. Place has excellent service, everyone is willing to answer questions about what a particular item is, what is in it, and make recommendations of popular items. We have had the shoyu ramen (chicken and kombu broth) $9.95 and tonkotsu ramen (chicken, pork and kombu broth) $12.95 (we made it spicy), spicy and salt & pepper fried chicken, and a few bubble teas - yakult slush no added sugar, passion fruit flavored tea 30% sugar less ice, and japanese matcha 30% sugar less ice.First the ramen, I actually prefer the less expensive shoyu. I thought it was fantastic. Great savory flavor and HOLY MEAT. All the meat has been cooked perfectly, so tender, juicy and flavorful, HUGE pieces - very generous. I prefer the ramen I had here to the ramen at Mitsuwa (GF disagrees, she prefers the more miso-flavored ramen at Mitsuwa, I don't care much for miso). Portions are monstrous - much more than you get at Mitsuwa. GF and I share one bowl and it is plenty.Enjoyed every bubble tea so far, haven't experienced some of the issues some others have had (cloudiness etc)...Great that they offer less sugar and ice, huge perk for me as I don't care much for very sweet things. Also great thing to learn from the staff is that all bubble teas except moo moo milks are lactose free (for those intolerant individuals like myself - your loved ones will be appreciative of this)!!
2015-04-17,5,Avid bubbletea drinker and been to a tons of ramen places. Definitely one of the best spots I've been to.
2015-04-15,5,just finished spicy veggie miso with taro slush, it was amazing! I never had any vegetarian noodles with this much flavor until today! and the slush is great too. the whole place is bright and inviting, the decor is really cool, the staff is friendly also sensored flushing toilet in the bathroom!? you can't beat that! it's nice to have you here in hobokenI'll be a regular here for sure!!
2015-04-15,2,I think this place could be much better. However, I am primarily basing this review off of the way they make their bubble tea. This particular location out of most bubble tea spots has an awesome selection of different things to try but the execution is somewhat lack luster and falls flat from their smaller location in NYC and varied bubble tea spots in NJ. Since it is a chain, it would be expected to have some standard in drink production, but every milk tea based drink I've had here was still powdery and next to flavorless. I keep trying to see if it depends on who made the drinks but after trying a few times they all seemed to use too much non dairy creamer, and not mixing it well. They offer various foods too but if they can't even make a simple black milk tea taste good, I doubt the food will be executed as just. I'll give this place one thing though. And that would have to be their inviting interior and overall cleanliness. Great staff, and everyone is super friendly. In the end, having clean facilities and great staff can only take you so far. I look forward to when they can produce a better product. I really want to like the spot, but the milk tea based drinks are just disappointing.
2015-04-13,5,Ramen is the best around! Great tea and atmosphere. Polite service staff. We will be back!
2015-04-12,4,I came here so often since it's opened and finally got a chance to try their ramen. It is NOT as good as some of the reviews suggest. I had my hope high and was very disappointed. It wasn't bad but nothing special, tasted a little bland to me. You can get better pre-packages ramen from mitsuwa. I would return for milk tea and snacks, but probably not for ramen.
2015-04-11,2,I'm sorry to say I disagree with the other reviews of their ramen. I regularly eat ramen in the city and ViVi's falls short. The broth didn't have the depth that I'm used to, the noodles were overcooked (I also wasn't offered a choice - thin or thick) and the pork was charred and tasted like it was cooked on a burnt flat grill (and had that kerosene taste). Not good. Didn't have the bubble tea so can't comment on that. Very disappointed as I was SO looking forward to having a ramen joint in my beloved Hoboken.
2015-04-11,3,It's a good place to enjoy Taiwanese snacks and drinks there! But Raman is not taste as good as the reviews, I don't like the broth and meat there. Totto Raman is much better!
2015-04-09,5,Tonkotsu ramen with fire charred pork sooo good, even comparable to big names ramen-ya in ny. definitely didn't expect ramen to be this good in a bubble tea place. also very cool bathroom!!
2015-04-02,5,This place is great! Cool relaxing atmosphere and good food.
2015-04-01,4,Yummy ramen -- Vivi ramen with clear broth.  Excited that there is a ramen place in Hoboken. Very clean and friendly staff.  Bobba tea is excellent too.
2015-03-30,4,Finally put one In Hoboken! I work In Chinatown and the one by me is great. Although the last time that I went they didn't have Taro slush. The bubble tea was great and I tried one of their macroons, which were alright. I'm confused about the ramen though.
2015-03-30,3,For starters, let me explain that I am originally from California and previously lived in Manhattan so I can with good authority provide this review. I am really excited that Hoboken has a boba joint. The boba is good but no Gong Cha or Share Tea quality but just having access to boba in Hoboken is great. The ramen here however is just bad - even if you are desperate. I had the Shoyu flavor one - it was salty, had the wrong seaweed, overcooked fish cake and chicken was so-so. Vivi, if you are reading this, please fix.
2015-03-30,5,Awesome place!! Bubble tea is second to non and the popcorn chicken and ramen is amazing!
2015-03-25,5,So glad a bubble tea place finally opened up in the area.  Especially one with such a nice atmosphere to be able to sit and enjoy your drink.  Staff was really courteous.  I've tried Matcha and Mango so far, they were both great and had a generous helping of bubbles. Looking forward to going back to try the ramen and some more of their bubble tea offerings.
2015-03-21,5,Got the Matcha Bubble Tea to go today and it's tea-lightful! Perfect amount of bubbles, good amount of matcha. The staff is friendly and the store has a cozy and welcoming atmosphere so I will definitely be going back for more tea and to try their Ramen.
2015-03-20,5,This place is great! The atmosphere is relaxing yet cheerful and the staff is the friendliest I have encountered in a long time. I have tried most of the bubble teas now and can honestly say I enjoy every one of them. Even better than the the bubble tea is the food! Ive never had ramen before but this stuff is amazing! Very healthy and packed with flavor! If you are looking for a place to grab a quick bite or sit and hang out, definitely give Vivi a shot! .. You're welcome.
