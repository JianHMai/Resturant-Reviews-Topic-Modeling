2021-08-11,5,The most wonderful and friendly atmosphere you will ever find - from the moment you walk in someone is greeting you with a smile! They have great quality coffee that they import from Italy (Lavazza) and different kinds of milk that you can pick from (if you are dairy intolerant). Lunch menu looked incredible too so I will have to come back to try it!
2021-05-30,3,The food can be improved. My cheese omelette tastes plain. But the environment is the highlight especially on a sunny day!
2020-11-26,4,One of those cute little cafes that totally live up to your expectations! We drove past this place and few times and finally decided to give it a try one Saturday afternoon for brunch! I went in a group of three and we all tried their vegetarian pancake dosa which we had heard so much about! I must say, we were not disappointed at all- it was delicious! They have multiple options for coffee too. I got their latte and loved it.The service is great, and what I loved what the ambience. It has this European feel to it on the inside and a very green fresh vibe if you get to sit outside. Did not disappoint!
2020-10-04,5,Best psl I've ever had. Seriously I don't know how I'll ever go back to Starbucks. The syrup isn't sweet, the foam is real, and it tastes like coffee. We got an iced and hot latte with pumpkin spice and both were delicious. The waiters were very attentive and friendly and the outdoor seating was quaint. It's also on a cute little street that gives it my brownstone feel. We didn't have time to try the food but we will definitely be back for it. They had interesting options and the people eating seemed satisfied. So happy to have found a Sunday morning coffee spot!
2020-03-10,5,The best people at the right time! The ravioli is phenomenal and cafe is one of the best in Hoboken! Owners have great souls!
2020-03-08,5,Diffferent style, and fresh food! It's not your typical American hoboken restaurant. It's very European style. Just go in and try it and you'll see what I mean. Breakfast was excellent. You have to order up at the front register. And they serve it to you. Good pastries! That was our experience.
2020-02-27,2,This place does not give glasses of water. Instead you have to buy mini Figi bottles, which is such a waste of plastic. Very odd. Food was fine. But I can't understand not giving patrons a glass of water. It's a very small establishment and they must need water to cook and bake, so I can't imagine why this is a thing.
2020-02-16,2,TL;DR: really quaint little nook, but no water? In this brightly lit cafe, have your breakfast in a place reminiscent of a tea parlor serving chai and food galore. The food is nothing special and slightly overpriced, but there is a lot of charm in the ambiance and decor. Outside it looks like magic, with decorations hanging from trees and inside the place is cuter than a pair of bees knees. While our waiter was welcoming, kind, and attentive, he became apologetic when we asked for a glass of water. Somehow Green Pear Cafe only has Fiji or sparkling to offer. This is absurd to me that there is no h2o to serve. All I know is I will not return.
2020-02-12,5,This is an adorable, high quality spot for breakfast and some tea (or coffee)! I was fortunate enough to meet the owners who were more than warm and genuine and I was very pleased with the tastes. I ordered a chai latte, not to sweet, just perfect! And an egg salad sandwich. The portion was impressive and I left satiated and happy. The ambience is artistic and very relaxed, just what you need to start your day!They also own a location in Jersey City Heights which is also worth checking out!
2020-02-07,4,Very cute gem off the beaten path in Hoboken. Everything from the art on the walls to the opinionated cups and the decorated tree... details really matter here and were well thought out. I liked the ambiance and the people watching scene of this quaint cafe. I am writing this review a few weeks after visiting and still remember the taste of the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which really hit the  spot for me that day and I would definitely come back for. I also liked that they have gluten free options although the food was not as amazing as I hoped. It was ok.Overall, it is cute and cozy with cool looking people and trees around so I would definitely come back and recommend to try it.
2020-01-16,5,When the weather is uncharacteristically nice for January you seek out cute little brunch spots and this place is the cutest of the cute. We sat outside on their wonderful little patio covered in fake flowers, plastic dinosaurs and teeny tiny tables. Did I mention this place was cute? Cute and kooky. The whole menu looked wonderful but I opted for a grilled chicken sandwich. Came with the chicken all chopped up and cooked absolutely perfectly and seasoned really well. It also had basil, roasted pepper, and sundried tomatoes on it. On the side of the sandwich were plantain chips, which I thought was a lovely little alternative to plain old potato chips. My boyfriend got an omelette, which I of course snuck a taste of, and it was delicious as well. Portions are pretty normal and I thought it was very reasonably priced, about $16 for each of our meals. You do pay for water, no big deal. Oh and I kind of fell in love with the mug that they gave me for my water. I THINK I saw that they sell them in their (once again) cute shop inside. Love this place and so happy we finally tried them. I'm also happy that the day we finally decided to try them it was gorgeous outside and we were able to sit outside. Can't wait to come back.
2020-01-12,5,Green Pear is still on point. Love this place and the owners constant commitment to customer satisfaction. They are committed to their customer base and to the community. Great coffee great food and great service.
2020-01-09,1,Boring.... bland and overpriced... my 2 year old can make better coffee using crusty Keurig ... never again
2020-01-08,1,Went in today bought a coffee for $2.75 and they charged my card charged $10 went back to dispute it to get a refund but they refused to give me anything or acknowledge their mistake. He was rude and extremely unfriendly, no manager around.  Beware of this bogus small coffee shop who's owned by a horrible and nasty woman. Wish I could give it 0 stars it does not even deserve the 1 star...
2019-11-23,1,Terriblej customer service and food is mediocre. The place is cute but so small and they have tables that do not fit the space and people are crammed in. I kept hitting the person next to me because we were so close.
2019-11-23,1,Mediocre food, terrible service, and rude manager - got the orders wrong and wanted to blame us. Too small of a space as well. We left there smelling like food. I do not understand the positive review but we all experience things differently. My friends and I were not impressed and will not be returning. We were only offered a smile when the check was presented - how interesting huh.
2019-11-09,5,This place is ADORABLE! Came here with my family and we all loved the food and atmosphere. Small and quaint, and good quality. I got the bacon, egg and cheese croissant. Delish! The omelets are huge, more like flat frittatas, and the eggs with salmon was a big portion, as well! Lots of salmon. And then at the end, they treated us with free dessert cookies! How sweet!!
2019-10-14,5,Stopped in for some fresh baked treats and picked up a chocolate chip cookie! It was perfect!!
2019-09-19,4,This place was really good! A super cute and small place on Newark and willow. I got the vegetable dosa and the chorizo omelette and they were very tasty. The service was really slow though, so beware of that.
2019-09-09,5,Delicious food & amazing service. We came here for breakfast prior to leaving NYC. We had our suitcases and the workers were more than willing to accommodate us. The food was phenomenal and home cooked. It was the perfect place for such a delicious meal while talking about our trip before going home.
2019-09-06,5,This place is the local "hidden gem" in Hoboken!  Serving you the best Italian (LavAzza) coffee and their croissants are OUT IF THIS WORLD DELICIOUS!  The owners are pretty awesome and are a part of the community, which we love
2019-09-04,4,Really cute location in Hoboken, can't believe it was my first time visiting. Had an amazing matcha latte (iced)! Ordered the salmon crepe which was delicious and a pork belly sandwich, would not order this again as it was extremely greasy and fatty and left my stomach a bit upset. Staff was very friendly and left you alone for just enough time to enjoy your company. Definitely worth the visit!
2019-09-01,5,Great food/ coffee etc. worth the stop if close by, worth the journey if far. Definitely coming back again
2019-08-28,4,cute little place, good food, great coffee. little pricey but very yummy and the place is adorable - lots of little thoughtful touches like umbrellas outside and blankets on the chairs when it's chilly out.
2019-08-11,1,I wish there was a 0 star review. My table asked if we could have water and they told us they didn't have any tap and that we either pay for sparkling or $4 Fiji water. Terrible food almost not edible, terrible service (only saw our waitress one time), high prices and terrible atmosphere. Will not be coming back. I got an omelette and water and ended up paying $25. The veggie omelette looked like they just threw eggs and veggies (not chopped up) into a pan and served it like that. My friends ordered croissants and they were burnt. Disappointed i wasted a meal here and gave money to this business. Don't waste your time here!
2019-07-23,1,Use to be a great cafe with great energy! Over priced with undisclosed price increases. The owner always charges me more than anyone else in the cafe with no valid reason. Stay away. Their system shows one price and she overrides with another.
2019-07-07,3,I've been wanting to stop into this sweet little place for quite some time.  Perhaps I was expecting too much, after passing it so many times, I was excited and I should've just managed my expectations.It's a nice day today (Sunday) and we wanted to grab a quick drink post spin and maybe a small bite.  We weren't up for juice or a shake so we decided to go into this place since we've seen it so many times.The good news is:  they have a lot of coffee and tea options, it's not too expensive and when the weather is nice they have 4 two-top tables outside/in front that are covered by umbrellas and a nice big tree.  Oh, and they do have WiFi you can use (the password is posted in the back or you can ask the staff).  The downside-its small, so there's not much room to order and wait for something to go, and while there are tables in the back, it's tight quarters, so just be mindful. Honestly, this place isn't bad, it just wasn't great, so we didn't feel compelled to get anything beyond drinks... maybe we'll have to give it another try.
2019-07-07,5,the cafe is really cute and comfy and makes for a really nice environment. the food and coffee is excellent and the employees and owner are all very kind. overall, i had a great experience there.
2019-07-03,5,Best local cafe in Hoboken. Family run, very friendly staff, charming decor and delicious coffee/drinks. We've been coming here for years and is always on our checklist of "must visits" when showing off Hoboken to friends visiting from out of town.
2019-07-02,5,This is HOME! The owner, staff always welcome me with open arms and smiles!! The food is great! The place is very clean! The atmosphere has a POSITIVE energy flow!!!!
2019-07-01,1,The owner of this place is one of the nastiest women I've ever met. Apparently my last review was removed because it was "racially sensitive" so, suffice it say, I watched her kick out a family for absolutely no reason and berate them the whole way out the door. I left immediately in protest and will not be back. Don't support businesses that don't treat all customers well and equally.Oh yeah, and the food is ridiculously overpriced and mediocre. They don't even have tap water, they make you buy it.
2019-06-30,1,The worst place and a rude and disrespectful owner who is mean and a horrible person . Beware if you are taking your children there and plan to grab a coffee . She is arrogant and does not understand what customer service is all about .
2019-06-30,3,Small, cute café! People working here are very nice and friendly. The food was ok, but the lettuce in my dosa was not fresh :( and they don't have tap water :(
2019-06-03,1,Extremely rude owner lectured me about this being HER establishment after I politely complained about spending $11.00 + tip on capuccino and oatmeal and being denied a glass of water to take my meds, whereas the owner told me she is there "to make money" and only sells water.  I was treated as if I just walked from the street and asked for a glass of water, which was not the case.  There are enough cafes in Hoboken where managers and owners respect patrons and are glad to have you and don't give you an attitude.RUDE is when you ask for water after eating and paying $20 for your bill and getting the following answer: "We do not give out water here. WE SELL IT!"
2019-06-02,5,Love this place! Friendly staff (think the whole family works there) and nice food. Coffee is good and better than most in the area.
2019-04-17,5,What a great find! My boyfriend and I ordered lattes with almond milk. The owner, Isabella made a perfect latte! Top tier. Great, smooth taste. We also ordered a bacon omelette. I love that it was made fresh in front of us. It came with toast topped with olive oil. The omelette was delicious. I loved the bacon and red onion. It wasn't folded over like a traditional omelette. It was more scrambled egg with bacon, cheese and onion haha. Cute shop! And the owner, Isabella, is an amazing woman! We will be returning customers. Cute little cafe! Love the tree out front and outdoor seating.
2019-04-16,5,Love this little spot tucked away off busy Washington street.  Delicious breakfast sandwiches and great lattes! Service is great! The seating area in the back is small, but I've never had an issue getting a seat.
2019-04-14,5,Lovely little place. My husband and I ordered lemon chicken salad and veggie burger. Husband was in love with his salad. And I was surprised to see two burgers in my plate. The taste was so good I did not have the guilt of eating both :) I liked how they served plantain chips than the usual fries. Wish I had taken pictures. You definitely see us again..
2019-04-13,4,We got omelettes they were good. Service was thoughtful they brought out a croissant on the house when my friend's omelette was taking much longer than mine. But I was negatively surprised that they don't offer normal tap water, that's something that most places in the states would not charge for, only in Europe have I seen water for purchase only. Seems strange when we are already paying plenty to have lunch there. The Dosas looked good I would be curious to try them next time.
2019-04-04,5,Excellent food and service. When the weather is nice we come here with our dog and sit outside. She loves the scrambled eggs!
2019-03-13,5,My favorite place in Hoboken to get an iced coffee with almond milk, hands down. They also make their croissants, which are AMAZING. The loveliest people work here and are always a joy to see whenever I walk in.
2019-03-03,5,This small restaurant has great service and food! The portions were very filling. Their lattes were tasty and their sandwiches had amazing flavor. I will definitely be back! Can't wait to try the crab cakes next time! My new go-to spot
2019-03-02,5,Was in the area looking for a brunch and bumped into this place. Was expecting the portions to be small but it turned out to be very generous! The pork sandwich was delicious and was served with plantain chips. Crepe was also very good. Definitely coming back
2019-02-15,5,What a charming, special place that I am lucky to have so close to my house. It's clean, staff is great and they offer great food options you don't find elsewhere- both healthy and indulgent. I figure if a place can make a veggie sandwich well, it must be good. I meant to eat half of this and ended up finishing the whole thing as well as most of the plantain chips- wish I got a pic of the matcha latte but I gulped it down as well. You don't find many places with the attention, freshness and atmosphere of the Green Pear. It feels like every detail was chosen with care, like I'm visiting my eccentric aunt's house who happens to be an amazing cook!
2019-02-15,5,Freshly made home cooked meals. I love the high quality ingredients. Super clean, warm, and inviting. This is my favorite place to meet up with friends for coffee (Lavazza), brunch, and, now, dinner.
2019-02-15,5,. Best Homemade food around. Service efficient and warm like no other place.Cant wait to go back again and try more dishes  .I loved Cevapi and my favorite crepes !
2019-02-10,3,Place was really nice but i expected better food. The service wasn't great either with owner pushing to rush through our meal to get tables free.
2019-01-29,5,The salmon parm omelette was delicious! They made a great almond milk latte too. Really happy to find this spot.
2018-12-16,5,I absolutely love this cute little cafe! The inside is adorable and cozy, the staff is nice and attentive, and the food is fresh and delicious! They have many gluten free and vegetarian options, and generally broad options for breakfast. The matcha latte is fantastic! I cannot recommend this place enough!
2018-11-08,4,Decided to try out a new spot and was pleasantly surprised.Had croissant, prosciutto and cheese with an iced coffee and really enjoyed.  Sandwich was delicious!  Croissant was especially delicious perfectly buttery and crispy at the same time.Enjoyed first visit so much decided to go again next day.  This time tried the salmon with cream cheese and naan open faced sandwich.  Again was very good!
2018-10-28,5,I love everything about this place from the whimsically decorated tree outside to the warm staff and and DELICIOUS food inside! Very consistent in all areas. My favorite is the tuna on baked naan and arepas. Coffee and juices are wonderful as well. One of my my go-to spots for sure.
2018-09-29,5,Had no idea this place existed, but boy do I know now. Best cappaccino I've ever had, and the smoothie was unbelievable. The paninis were splendid and the decor was very nice! We will certainly be back soon!!
2018-09-27,5,Homemade dosas and arepas!! Our new favorite breakfast lunch place in downtown Hoboken!
2018-09-07,5,European style seating with very nice song selection.Really liked their Panini and Dosa (it's not a usual Indian Dosa)! Great service and must try Cremespresso.
2018-07-28,1,This looks like a cute brunch place and I wish I could like it. We went today, lots of flies and we need to wave our hands to keep them away from the food, I was a little annoyed, but there is nothing like seeing a black, dried, dead fly in my plate. I ordered an egg salad sandwich. I was half way through, it was just lying there, buried in the greens. I could've eaten it. I was immediately disgusted and nauseated, and started to second guess our other dishes. I didn't get an apology or any explanation. The owner reduced the price of this plate from the total bill.They should really do something about sanitation and quality control.
2018-07-24,5,Amazing European style cafe in downtown Hoboken. Great coffee, gourmet products, great decor, style and ambiance. Such a welcome addition to the neighborhood!! With creme espresso you feel like you're in Italy!!
2018-07-13,3,This is a cute little place that seems to emphasize health. My friend and I shared the bacon omelette, nutella crepe, and the Malibu juice. We found it a little weird that they didn't give complimentary water. Instead, our group had to order bottled Fiji water. I also felt like the juice was a bit overpriced for what we got (a lot of the volume was ice). Overall, however, the food was pretty tasty - we thoroughly enjoyed our crepe and omelette! This place is also probably not the greatest for a big group (thankfully there was a large enough table for us when we went), as there are only a few tables inside (most of which are on the small side).
2018-07-10,5,We love going to Green Pear!  A local Hoboken gem that brings all the great vibes and nourishes our stomachs and our souls!
2018-07-07,2,This is a cozy little restaurant in Hoboken which seemed promising but failed to impress us much. We were seated inside, flies were our constant companion. We ordered the Vegetarian Sandwich on Naan bread and the Salmon Pancake which were both good. They have only bottled water which seemed odd and the service wasn't that great. The servers seemed to ignore us and we had to try hard to get their attention. Really hope they do something about the flies, there's nothing more de appetizing than watching flies share your food.
2018-05-19,1,Food and drinks were good..but the gentleman serving us was pretty rude..they have an open kitchen and they were probably cooking/cutting some onions because of which every guest seated there had a lotta eye irritation..and when we mentioned this to that gentleman he just flatly suggested that we are free to leave..when we mentioned that it's not just our table but every guest seated there..he openly asked another guest and when they confirmed that they were all having the same issues that's when he apologized and reported it back to their cooks..NEVER COMING BACL HERE AGAIN.
2018-05-03,3,the staffs are super friendly and lovely juice menu. not the fan for the food though, I ordered the bacon and egg, the quality of the ingredients could be better.
2018-04-22,2,Service was pretty awful, brought out all of our drinks separately with 5 mins in between each one. Lamb sandwich tasted old and gamey. When asked for water, they said they don't serve tap water, only Fiji water. Really not good.
2018-03-31,4,small cool place  ... little  Expensive for basic food I'm got Crepes ....   nice Place  & service  but  Is me or this place I'm like coffee  so I'm ask for refill  I'm by charge 2 × hmmmmmis not like They make FRESH & HOT  is from pot coffee
2018-03-26,4,Such a quaint and cozy ambiance! Staff was very friendly and food was delicious.  Great selection of smoothies and fresh juices if you are into that.  I had the ham omelette and my boyfriend tried the Norwegian pancake dosa - not a crumb left on either of our plates.  Only downside was we had to purchase bottled water (Fiji). Will definitely be back to try the crepes!
2018-03-22,5,Very nice food and very friendly staff, cozy place but perfect for grub food or drink. Love also get breakfast or also Sunday brunch
2018-03-04,5,Beautiful small spot, great service, delicious food and very good music! Our favorite brunch spot.
2018-02-04,3,Decent food but nothing was super tasty to set them apart-menu options were interesting with an Indian twist on breakfast food but there are better options in Hoboken.  Coffee was a bit burnt but overall not a bad meal.
2018-01-29,5,Very nice place. Good food and great customer service. Would visit again. Convenient location as well. Would have enjoyed outdoor seating however it has rained on the day we went.
2018-01-18,3,Decided to finally try this place out as looks cute and has high star rating.  I decided to give there crepes which are made of gluten free chickpea flour a try.  Truthfully not sure if it was the flour,  the cooking or maybe they tried to be healthy with how the kept crepes from sticking as felt mine was over cooked,  dry and lacking taste.  All I got was cinnamon coated bananas.   Maybe would be better if instead of having bananas inside and outside crepe they used peaches or strawberries on outside.    My mochas was nice looking but had no mocha taste and too much foam for my taste.  Service was good,  place is cute and has good wifi.   Almost gave them two stars but felt after one meal could not as chickpea flour could just not be my thing.  Maybe should have gone with my other choice the croissant egg sandwich.
2018-01-08,5,Amazing coffee, delicious food, and friendly staff! Gina was so nice and kind. You should stop by and try whatever you want! You'd love here!
2018-01-08,5,Gina has been so welcoming and friendly. Also the latte was delicious, the best coffee shop in Hoboken for sure.
2018-01-07,5,Home-like and simplistic ambience (in a good way)! I came to the cafe with some of my friends and they were very welcoming.The chai latte is a must-try. We ordered a sandwich, an omelette and an arepa. It was quite delicious and you could taste the freshness of all veggies and bread.Strongly recommended for brunch / lunch.
2017-12-28,5,Being a Portlander we appreciated the cozy breakfast in NJ. Food was fresh and delicious.The decor is classy with attention to detail. My 5 year old called the place "cute".Definitely recommend it.
2017-12-20,2,Review is based on a pick-up order:I went to pick up a breakfast order I phoned in on a Thursday morning. This was my first time at the Green Pear Cafe so when I walked in, I couldn't help but notice how adorable it was. There was someone behind the counter but they seemed busy so I patiently waited and looked around at the mugs for sale for a few mins. She abruptly asks me, "What do you need?" I thought that was a weird way to greet someone in the morning right after they walked in the door. I told her I was picking up an order. She then abruptly asks me, "Cash or card?" Mind you, still no hello or anything. As I was paying, they were staring at the screen when the tip options came up which made me feel so uncomfortable. Who stares when you're entering a tip? I felt forced to over tip for a pick-up order that was already costing me over $30 (the egg white omelette I ordered was around $19 and my boyfriend's three hard boiled eggs, salmon, and dill sour cream was about $16, we also got two coffees). I grabbed my items and left, wrongfully assuming my entire order was in the bag. I got home and noticed the coffees were not in the bag, my mistake for not checking. I had to go back one more time to grab my coffees. They were apologetic which I understand. It happens.The food was ok but not worth $30+ for what we ordered. The coffee is not good. I don't think they've cleaned their coffee pots in ages or something because the coffee is insanely bitter. I wanted to love this place so much. I was so excited to discover something so close with such great reviews. Sadly, bad service and bitter coffee played a major role in me not coming back.
2017-11-08,4,I've been passing by this cute cafe for months now and finally got to try it yesterday. Went there around 830 for breakfast and it was just the cutest cafe ever with unique decotations.They have an array of breakfast options along with pasta and sandwiches for lunch. I chose the EGG & CHEESE CROISSANT and my friend got one of the AREPAS. The croissant was pretty good, flakey and not overly cheesy. The guy next to us got an omelette and it looked pretty good. I had a glass of grapefruit juice -- tasted fresh and not concentrate.I wouldn't suggest coming with a big group since there's only 3 or so tables inside the cafe. There's a few outdoor seating for when it's nice outside.
2017-10-31,5,I came here for breakfast the other day and had a wonderful experience. I ate a proscuitto omelette which was simply exquisite. The coffee was simple, hot, and brewed just right. My server, Lindsay, was attentive and amicable. She was able to offer great recommendations about the menu, and really made the dining experience complete.Nothing bad to say about this cozy shop in Hoboken. Wonderful family atmosphere, and great service. You can really tell that they care at Green Pear. 5/5!!!
2017-10-30,5,This is such a haven! Cozy and sweet surroundings. The people are amazing --the owners and staff incredibly pleasant to be around I always feel welcome. It is such a wonderfully picked menu; fresh, healthy and appetizing! There are many gluten-free options. The coffee is always on point. They have the cutest patio that's covered by a beautifully decorated tree. I always feel as if I am in a romantic cafe in Europe. Just go.
2017-10-30,5,Love the Cafe....the coffee, fresh food made everyday, salads, crepes, pasta, smoothies and the warm inviting energy in the place. The owner always greets you with a smile and is very helpful if you are on a restricted diet. She goes out of her way to make something special. I highly recommend the Green Pear.
2017-10-29,2,How can this place be ranked so high? The food, service and even coffee are so bad.Coffees came out burnt to death, impossible to drink. For a place that's called a cafe that's a big minus. Then we had to sit and wait forever for spoons and sugar that never arrived. Mind you there are 4 tables in this tiny place.The egg dish was 3 boiled eggs out of fridge. Apparently they're not capable of a simple task of fresh- boiling them when I asked. Zero salt on those eggs. I ended up getting up and getting salt and pepper myself as our waiter was too distracted. My husband's dish was brought out almost ten minutes after mine. So we had to sit and stare at my eggs out of the fridge.Very disappointing and hard to trust Yelp reviews after things like this.
2017-09-30,2,Had a negative experience here. I went in on a weekend morning and there was maybe one customer seated in the back, but the place was otherwise empty. There were 6 employees or so shuffling around past each other in the long, narrow space behind the counter. It took 5 minutes for someone to take my order and then another 10 for me to get my order. All I ordered was a single bacon, egg and cheese croissant. It should not take that long. The portion size was lackluster at best. The croissant was toasted into a crusty death. The cheese was sprinkled over the sandwich at the very last minute and did not have time to melt, such that when I opened the sandwich, those string flakes of cheese (for the price, some nice cheese would have been better) just starting falling out. The price? $8. Total rip off.  This place needs some serious help.
2017-09-17,5,Awesome breakfast place. The coffee is fantastic. Any of the omelets we've had are fresh and made to order. Great service and so nice to sit outside. It's a weekend favorite.
2017-09-06,5,This place is just darling! (I never use that word - but couldn't think of anything better or more accurate.) Its off the beaten path for me as I live in uptown Hoboken but will skip other local cafes to drive down, roll the dice and either get no parking or have to parallel park just for their deliciously smooth coffee and buttery croissants. Also, if you have time to sit and relax, their omelettes are delicious - light but filling! The service is so friendly and they're genuinely happy to help. I love going to quaint, cute cafes and getting a different experience from local shops as opposed to boring, basic Starbucks.
2017-08-11,2,I'm not sure how this place is so highly rated on Yelp. I thought it was mediocre at best but I definitely wouldn't come back.I came here for an early lunch on Friday so that I could get there in time for breakfast (served until noon). I ordered orange juice, a dirty chai, and a veggie omelette and went to sit outside. The dirty chai they served me wasn't a latte, which dirty chai usually is (chai latte with a shot of espresso). Instead, theirs was just chai with espresso in it. Meh.Then they brought my veggie omelette. It was served open-faced with a sort of salad on top-- arugula and tomatoes. From what I could tell, the veggies inside the omelette included some bell peppers and zucchini, but not much of them. Weirdest of all, the cheese was sprinkled on top instead of mixed into the omelette, so it wasn't fully melted. It was disappointing but I ate it.All of this might have been okay if not for their tables. Their outside tables are cast iron with a fancy design but nothing on top, so the delicate glasses they gave me for my chai and orange juice were perched precariously on top. At the end of my meal when I was finishing my orange juice, I must have nudged the table because the chai glass tipped over and my remaining half of chai splashed through the table onto my bag and white jeans. I honestly don't remember touching the table or chai glass, that's how little effort it took to knock it over. Those open tables are just a terrible idea and the glasses they give you don't help. It was a bad ending to a not-great meal. Oh, and on top of that, the service is really slow.
2017-07-25,4,Liked the smoked salmon sandwich on a pretzel bun. Staff is friendly and the place is kind of cute. They have a few seats outdoors as well. I'd say the food is a good 4 star. Will come again.
2017-07-24,1,Absolutely HORRIBLE experience. Multiple reasons why I would highly discourage anyone from dining here. Amazingly, a restaurant that serves food does not have access to tap water. If you'd like a glass of water your only option is a bottle of Fiji. They can make complicated beverages however when I asked for a simple glass of tea I was told it was too complicated to make. The food is, at best, MARGINAL. I ordered a Panini which was essentially frozen chicken wrapped in a pita type bread. I was having brunch with two other people and we all were highly disappointed. All three entrées arrived separately-- stupid way to serve guests. GUESTS LIKE TO DINE TOGETHER. Other than the very poor service, no one in the restaurant interacted with us as guests AND IT WASNT BUSY!!!! As we walked out the owner was more concerned with putting miniature pixies in her hanging baskets than my experience in her restaurant. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!!
2017-06-05,4,I have been to this place a couple of times. The first time was a morning in 2016. My husband and I had a sit-down breakfast. It wasn't bad. And I was glad to find Lavazza coffee in Hoboken. Recently, we went there again to get a cup of coffee around noon. It was a bit of wait. I wished there was a proper waiting area. We had to move around as other customers coming into the cafe.
2017-05-19,3,I really don't get the good reviews here... maybe just the drinks are ok? Came here for lunch with a friend but probably won't be back.The place is almost(?) cute, but the disco lights really bothered me. Our server was friendly but service was superrrrr slow. The price seemed ok but the food just did not cut it for me. We ordered a salad (that never came), grilled chicken panini, and vegetarian panini. Key word = panini. Aren't paninis supposed to be warm? Our sandwiches were cold  and the bread was not fresh. The mozzarella was pretty good but the sandwiches literally looked like something I can make in two minutes. Maybe the other dishes are better? I will never know. I did get the fresh grapefruit juice which was great, so I'm thinking this is a cafe to come for drinks, not food. Would not recommend for lunch.
2017-04-30,4,This is a great cozy food establishment with a nice staff. I use to love coming for their dossa which is gluten free and vegan. However, they no longer have any of the dossa or crepes on their menu. This was my place to go for breakfast but now with no more dossa I have to say goodbye. I haven't tasted their other food but they have alot of repeat customers that don't eat only dossa :)
2017-03-05,5,A unique atmosphere in Hoboken, by far the best coffee shop.the owners are very nice and friendly,if you want to get real coffee, this is definitely your place.smoothies are also amazing,on the top of that, they sell unique products from Europe ,that are very difficult to find on the market,definitely a must if you are in Hoboken!
2017-02-24,5,My favorite coffee shop in Hoboken! Get a latte and sit out front or in one of the little nooks in the back. The egg dishes are all very rich (heavy butter and parmesan) but perfect for a lazy Sunday.
2017-02-22,5,This was a gem of a find. Me and my wife always strive to change it up when it comes to food. We have lived in Hoboken for just about 3 years now and this is the first time we have been to this place, and it will not be the last! The service was great, food was very fresh, reminds me of the overseas experience of the freshness and flavor explosion. Quiet and cozy ambience, and the coffee is very good for specialties. If you need a good change of pace from Washington street and want to experience fresh, clean food, certainly consider coming here. Did I mention they have gluten free items on the menu...
2017-02-19,5,If I could give this place 6 stars I would. My husband and I have been coming to green pear cafe since they opened. So many places open in hoboken and many are disappointing so needless to say we were thrilled when a place lived up to expectations and was a block away. My husband grew up in Italy and my in-laws immigrated from Italy 20 years ago - this place is the real deal and authentic (which is harder to come by in this area then it should be!). Their cafe beverages (cappuccino etc) are perfect, their breakfast items are delicious and perfectly portioned (Italians don't eat a huge breakfast), their smoothies and juices are refreshing and their treats are something to dream about (especially the mini tarts)! The smallest touches make such a difference (such as homemade almond milk - yum, and the fruit parfait with mango purée). The Italian products they carry are also amazing. And to round out all the positives, they are very well priced and the owners are the sweetest people who know how to run a business and make customers happy. We live uptown now but it's worth the walk to enjoy this gem!! Grazie Mille GPC for choosing to open your business in Hoboken!
2017-01-28,5,Great place. Great food. Not just your usual Hoboken brunch menu either with breakfast dosas and other interesting items. No TVs or annoying brunch crowds which is great - a proper, small cafe. Highly recommend visiting.
2017-01-21,5,Delicious food! I had scrambled eggs with salmon on the side and some toast. It was reasonably priced, and the place was very clean and had a really nice French fusion vibe to it.
2017-01-11,5,Exceptional service and products. I have always left feeling satisfied with the service and the food. If, for any reason, I was less than satisfied with my food, I felt very comfortable in letting the staff know and it was quickly rectified. Family business makes the atmosphere feel warm and welcoming. I cannot rave enough about this place. After discovering the cafe we found ourselves coming back again and again - not just for the food but the service and wanting to support local small businesses. Please give them a try - you won't regret it!
2017-01-08,5,Fantastic cozy coffe that has very delicious breakfast and lunch food, with an ambience that is bright and lighthearted. The smoked salmon omelet was delicious and so was the cocoa. We loved so much, we went again the next day for some more yummyness. We'll be back again =)
2016-12-30,5,Very nice staff and cafe!!!Best gluten-free crêpes ever! Very good food and service overall. Will return and recommend!
2016-12-03,5,Try their dirty chai. Two shots of espresso never tasted so good. Great mellow ambience jazzy and eurofàncy
2016-11-23,5,Great amazing smoothies!  They use natural dates versus sugar which I love.  I get the mango, coconut, coconut water, and dates smoothie amazing.  My friend got a nut based one made with cashews, peanuts, and a few other ingredients it was very good considering I am not a huge nut person when I tried it.I love their smoked salmon on naan bread with dil.  They have a great organic fresh menu and import a lot of their ingredients.  Love this little cafe right in my neighborhood.  For a person who works from home I love to pop in here to grab a late breakfast or lunch and to work for an hour or so on my wifi.  When it is is nice out they have a few tables set up outside.  Overall great fresh food, perfect neighborhood location, and a friendly staff!  A favorite in my Southwest Hoboken which can be fairly limited in food options compared to other parts of town.  It will continue to be a frequented place of mine as long as I live in this neighborhood.  Keep up the good work!
2016-11-14,4,Green pear cafe was a great, intimate restaurant. I was the chicken salad naan wrap which had a lot of flavor and fresh ingredients. My friend had the tri color dosa which was also very tasty. I think that for a meal, there should be a side or something else on the plate. It's a very small place with 4 tables inside and 2 tables outside. The wait staff is very nice and accommodating.
2016-11-13,2,I was not super impressed by this place. Initially, the atmosphere is unique and cute, with blankets outside if you get a little chilly and a back room indoors for main seating. When you walk in, it looks like its going to be counter serve but behind the counter is where they make all the food. Our servers were nice enough, but brought limes instead of lemon and didn't come back for us to ask for lemons. The food is what prompted this review... the dosa is so dry that you can barely cut through it, and the prosciutto pesto combination was so salty that I could not drink enough water after. The ham omelette was both overcooked and over greasy at the same time. Mango lassi was okay also. TLDR: not impressed with food.
2016-10-26,1,My friend and I walked so many blocks through Hoboken bc we wanted to try this place, it had so many good reviews and we wanted a nice cafe... when we walked in I felt like I was in Europe, loved the decor and coziness. We got our menus, I ordered chicken salad over field greens on naan... my friend got tuna salad on naan... so it should be the same concept, I thought the chicken salad was like chicken mixed w mayo and celery on naan.... no it was grilled chicken over tomatoes and lettuce... that's not what I ordered.... I told the lady but she didn't care.... so I tried eating it but it was flavorless so I just ate the naan! I wish I ordered a crepe instead... I think this place is better for breakfast/brunch.... No one came to see how we were doing or n e thing.... no I would never go back here....
2016-10-23,5,Visited today for the first time. Loved my to-go breakfast and latte. Super friendly people working... I look forward to seeing more often. There is not a coffee cafe nearby that I enjoy, so glad to have finally found this place. I wish it didn't take me a year to try. It can be my go to spot for the weekends now, yes!
2016-10-22,3,I've only been here for coffee. And I'll admit I go for drip rather than espresso. However, for all the great things I've read about their drinks I was expecting better. Or at least a price for the level of quality. I'll likely be back because this is on a common route of mine but I won't go out of my way for it. Maybe I just need to try the food.
2016-10-18,5,Great coffee,amazing team!Love it.Really nice menu for a gourmands:)I would strongly recommend that place.
2016-10-15,5,A great family friendly cafe run by a great family! Quaint cafe with room for strollers in the back and they have a high chair for toddlers.  They are always offering to help get your stroller inside or they will run your coffee out to you.   Great coffee, food & small baked goods. Outdoor seating in front as well!
2016-10-14,5,Great food! You must try most of the menu. Pancake dosas are great and fresh tasting. The lunch menu is available all day and has some great options including the vegetarian paratha.
2016-10-13,5,I've been living in Hoboken for nearly three years and never have I come across more of a gem than green pear cafe. Let me start by telling you about the people who run the cafe. The warmth and hospitality can be felt instantly. Upon receiving my coffee I was pleasantly surprised to see the it was LaVazza, my personal favorite. Food was fresh and healthy absolutely delicious! Stop by this unbelievable restaurant and you will be coming back for more! My new favorite place for everything in Hoboken.
2016-10-12,5,Fresh food, great music, and wonderful atmosphere. This place is just great!! Just what Hoboken needed... finally a place that has a wonderful breakfast. It definitely has a great twist to their food. So happy I tried it! Salmon, with dill infused sour cream, and spinach omelet was spectacular. I have tried every breakfast place in Hoboken and have been disappointed... this was a pleasant surprise that you green pear cafe
2016-08-27,4,Green Pear is a great place to stop for breakfast (only have been for breakfast). The coffee is fantastic and the people are friendly. Its an especially nice place tomato when the weather is nice as they have some outdoor seating. My only complaint is that they don't specify that the egg and cheese comes with Parmesan cheese, not the traditional American cheese, and it's not specified on the menu. Other than that I'd highly recommend it.
2016-07-17,4,I have been wanting to try this place for awhile as we live around the corner.  My husband and I ordered a cappuccino and the Malibu juice, both were excellent. As a non-caffeine drinker I really appreciate that they offer all the coffee drinks in decaf.  The juice was refreshing and delish!For breakfast we split the Primavera Dosa and a Nutella banana crepe. LOVED the pancake dosa, it was flavorful and something different. Both the crepe and the Dosa were light.  My husband left a bit hungry, but it's not a 3 ft stack of pancakes type place so you can't go in expecting heafty portions.Overall it's a lovely little cafe. The only downside was that the air conditioner unit exhaust was blowing out the window right next to my head at the outdoor table. We're not talking a light breeze here, it was really blowing. Not the end of the world but I would certainly avoid that table next time. They should think about doing something to deflect or block that air.Def a must try!!! We will be back :)
2016-07-12,5,Green Pear Cafe is the BEST! Every time I enter I am greeted with smiles and very welcoming staff. I feel like family there. The iced latte is amazing and the food is Delish! I haven't had one bad meal. My kids also love it. They order the fresh pineapple juice and yummy croissants. It is such a quaint and beautiful cafe that you would usually only find in Europe. I would recommend tasting everything on the menu and having their cappuccino, fresh made almond milk, and lattes. The list goes on and on.
2016-06-24,1,I visited this coffee shop with my three other friends a weeks ago for a meeting and we found this place to be expensive.   The same items at Dunkin Donuts one block away, can be had for a MUCH cheaper price and much better tasting (with courteous smiles from the Dunkin cashier)The place is small, crowded with cluttery ambience. The food looks good, but all of us found the taste inferior elsewhere in Hoboken.Try Toni Boloney's of Hoboken and Luca Brasi's Deli on 1st Street - service with a smile (cheaper, spacious and good taste without the illusion of expensive decor only to be matched by an expensive price). the short haired blonde lady at the cashier was mean and focused on getting paid only... without a thank you or a smile either to us ... (we didn't think she is native to this land) ... her service was slow and ignored us when we walked in..... to the mean lady, I know you have a business and you had to be paid but there is a way to do this better and more gracious.... seriously ...  geeeeez !! Again, other locations close to this establishment are priced better with better etiquette values that makes a small business better. We do not see how this place can have 5 yelp stars, not possible !! unless the people who commented at yelp are friends or family members of this establishment. Don't visit unless of course you have money to splurge on something pretentious and impress your friends with illusions of grandeur over a crowded small table nudge to nudge ..... We will simply not be coming back here again ......
2016-06-06,5,My friend and I enjoyed brunch at this beautiful cafe this morning and we left feeling more than satisfied. The menu options were plentiful and very reasonably priced (crucial to any brunch experience). I definitely recommend the Dosa and fruit bowl.  All of the staff were very professional and welcoming to us, including the chef and the owners! This is the best place I've eaten since moving to north Jersey and I will definitely be bringing more friends here in the future.UPDATE 7/17/2016Since I first stepped into the Green Pear Cafe several months ago, I have brought all family and friends who have come to visit me to get brunch here. The authentic European flair and attention to every detail of presentation and service alone, brings me back every time. I recommend any of the egg dishes or Dosas (I've had them all at this point) as well as anything on the high fiber menu. As I said previously, I highly enjoy the experience and the food this place provides and will continue bringing friends and family whenever we're looking for a guaranteed delicious brunch experience.
2016-05-14,4,This is an adorable little cafe a surprisingly large enough menu for a full brunch. We went in a group of 4 on Mother's Day. It is a family run business, and the son was our server. The food is very fresh and presented nicely. We were seated at a tiny little table and didn't really have enough room for all of our plates and food. This definitely made it a challenge to navigate the utensils and a couple bites landed on the floor because of it. I would recommend the dosas! The egg dishes looked good too, but the dosas are fun and fresh. And some of them have a lot of cheese which is always a good thing. Even though it was a busy day, the staff was very friendly. The service was extremely slow so even though we stayed past the time limit, they didn't kick us out. I would return here to have another dosa for sure. Those are a good amount of food for a reasonable price.
2016-05-09,5,This place is very cozy, with a very friendly staff. Definitely recommend stopping in.
2016-04-03,1,Food sucks, any food truck can easily beat this place. Do let the decorations fool you. Again, food sucks
2016-04-02,5,Great local coffee shop with delicious food. I believe it's family owned and they're super friendly.
2016-03-25,3,Let's start with the positives: I've been here at least three times before my latest visit today and have always had good experiences. The staff has been friendly and helpful and I have enjoyed everything on the menu, both food and drinks. I like the atmosphere and the proximity to my house. It had become a go-to for meetings and a nice quiet place to get a little writing done.Unfortunately Green Pear has recently changed its policy and no longer lets patrons stay more than 45 minutes. I was verbally informed of this policy after it was clear that my meeting was over and my drink was empty and would not be making another purchase. At this time, there were only two other customers present in the store, and there was plenty of other seating available.They have a limited amount of seating and I understand the need to be respectful of traffic flow and certainly patrons should be aware especially during busy hours not to abuse the space, but as a paying customer I believe a business should clearly establish their expectations (put a clear sign up on the wall or at each table) and leave it to the customer's judgement as to when it is time to leave.While I understand all of this from a cost perspective, my experience today made me feel unwelcome and hesitant to return as a patron.
2016-03-11,5,Green Pear Cafe is adorable.  The indoor space is small, but the food and beverages are great every time.  The portions are fairly small, but the prices are very reasonable.  They also have a small shop area where they sell food and gift items.
2016-03-01,5,This is by far the best cafe in Hoboken in my humble opinion! I try to go in here 1-2 times per week and typically will order coffee (very good indeed) and a naughty snack..... The decor is enchanting and inviting. It is family run and everyone has always been incredibly friendly and warm and make you feel like you could lose a day in there. In summary, if I ran a cafe, THIS would be the dream.
2016-02-07,5,Went here for coffee and a snack and really enjoyed the experience. Staff is supremely friendly. Prices are pretty reasonable. A few dollars for a cappuccino, food around $5-$12 depending on what you order.
2016-01-23,5,Went here again today, and they are open in the snow storm! That is true dedication, I love this place...go here:)
2016-01-19,5,What an elegant, good-vibe place! This coffee shop is in a hidden corner of Hoboken, even if it's only a few blocks from City Hall and Washington Street, so going there is like stepping into a cafe on a quiet street in Paris or Rome.It's run by the most gracious Italian couple from Italy, so they have the finest coffee and desserts. Lovely lunches, very economical. Eating there is like visiting family. It's a real find.Green Pear is new, it's only been open about six months, so only the locals and professionals who work nearby have discovered it so far. It's the kind of quality place you disappear to when you want to escape your life in the afternoon, and nourish your soul with a little peace and luxury.
2016-01-18,3,Small neighborhood cafe serving brunch, small plates & some cool drinks. Bummer that the drinks seem much better than the food. We stopped by for a light lunch during the holidays and it was quite disappointing. The husband had a salmon burger which came on a bed of salad (open burger, no patty). I had the gnocchi with cheese. Both tasted pretty much generic...nothing that set it apart or made it stand out in any way. The salmon wasn't the freshest either.The Lake Placid drink on the other hand was stellar -- very refreshing, tangy and just the right touch of sweetness. This is a family run business with the kids doubling up behind the counter & as servers. Great idea. My recommendation would be to kick it up a notch;  both attention to detail and a touch of warmth. It's really what brings people back and makes a home grown business memorable.
2016-01-15,5,Great little cafe! Good Lavazza coffee! Finally a place where I can go in on a cold day, grab a cup of coffee, continue my walk while sipping and enjoying a good cup that doesn't taste burnt, and sour! (People mistake sourness for "strong" and that's not really what it is). The place is clean, well-lighted, warm and inviting. Great snacks on the counter, just tempting us to try their ever changing display of yumminess! Yesterday they had really, really good pignoles! The little area in the far back of the cafe is small and cozy with a couple of tables. There are goodies to browse from on the wall, like Italian cookies, teas etc. The place is located somewhat hidden, but for us who has discovered this tiny gem, will be going back for more.
2015-12-27,5,We ate and relaxed in this cute cafe that felt like a little hideaway in Hoboken. Staff and owner were friendly and warm.  Unique menu that had food from many cultures. Needless to say my cafe latte was great too. I can be a regular here....
2015-12-17,5,Cute cafe, quaint space, great smoothies and friendly service!  What more can you ask for?Stopped in on way to a meeting to grab a power pick me up, their smoothies caught my eye and I ordered the mango lassi smoothie and it was delicious!!!  Not too creamy/yogurty and really good balance of mango and diary!The servers/owners (I think they are the owners) are so friendly and the space is beautifully quaint.  Cannot wait to come back and try more items on their menu when I have time!!!
2015-12-08,5,--
2015-11-09,5,Fantastic Family business, I go almost daily.  Thank you for the great hospitality and addition to the neighborhood.   Food is great, prices are excellent and a very charming atmosphere.Jeff
2015-11-07,5,So cute! Lake placid juice was delish! As was the mango yogurt and egg & cheese croissants!  Liked it all!!
2015-10-22,5,I'm so excited to be living in downtown Hoboken this fall, with all of these great local places opening up! I stopped in one day after work and had one of the best cups of coffee I've ever had. Smooth and delicious. I was also pleased to find that not only do they have food, coffee, pastries and Italian cookies, but they also have a little grocery selection with some really interesting items. I got a jar of fantastic pesto. The cafe offers a very interesting mix of menu items and the owners tell me that they are Eastern European and Italian, which may explain why. Great brunch spot, great place for a good coffee, and great spot to stop in to buy something interesting to cook for dinner or bring to a dinner party. So happy to have The Green Pear in Hoboken!
2015-10-19,5,Best tuna salad sandwich i've had in...years? Yes, years. It comes on this naan-like flatbread, which is the perfect canvass for the homemade tuna salad. Really outstanding. Cool place, lots of specialty foods for sale, all high quality. This is a gem.
2015-10-16,5,The coffee here is excellent and the service is exceptional. The owners are extremely friendly, and the place has only been open a short time but already has a great neighborhood feel. Highly recommend if you want delicious food, great coffee and friendly service!
2015-10-02,5,I just tried this place for this first time after a few friends and neighbors raved about and I was blown away!!  We ordered the smoked salmon on tandoori naan and the suckling pig on oven baked flat bread as take-out...as soon as I took the last bite of the suckling pig I wished I ordered a second!!  The smoked salmon was delicious as well and I don't know if they make the flatbreads and naan on the spot but they are so fresh it tastes like they do.  I will most likely go back in the next 24 hours.What a great addition to an area that couldn't be more deserving of a neighborhood cafe like this.
2015-09-28,5,Just came in for coffee, but will definitely be returning for lunch. The new cafe is beautiful and has free wifi! Great new addition for those on the west side of town!
2015-09-09,5,Recently spent the day working from this little gem on Grand Street.  Outdoor seating provides a few tables with umbrellas while and a few set in the back of the cafe.  A big bonus is the working Wi-Fi.  The owner is a delight, the coffee strong & the food tasty. 2 thumbs up for the Green Pear Cafe
2015-09-08,5,Super cute place with delicious options, love their coffee.  So nice to have a place like this in the neighborhood.
2015-08-29,5,Adorable little cafe with great atmosphere and delicious cold pressed juices at super reasonable prices.
2015-08-29,5,I have to admit, I sort of stumbled upon this place by accident but I'm sure glad I did! Located on Grand St between First/Newark, it's only a few blocks away from my apartment so it was totally perfect for a quick Saturday morning walk. The first thing I noted when I came in was the really cute interior. It's obvious a lot of work was put into this shop to make it nice. The front has the counter/shelves with various foodstuffs and the back has a few tables. It's spacious (for Hoboken) and the layout is on point. The coffee was really, really good. I ordered a flat white but the owner said he was going to make me a cappuccino instead. Whatever, I'm not picky and it was damn good. A double shot of quality espresso is perfect to get you up and running! The breakfast sandwich I got was actually quite tasty. While they don't have a full on grill, they made it fresh in some type of machine. While that was weird, it was delicious nevertheless so why complain? The croissant was buttery and flakey and delicious.I'm going to have to make this new addition to Hoboken a common stop moving forward. Friendly people, great coffee and pretty good breakfast sandwiches!
2015-08-25,5,A great addition to the neighborhood! We were walking home from dinner and happen to notice this place. Honestly I had no idea it was there. We walked in as they were getting ready to close up. We were welcomed into this cute place by the owner Isabella who couldn't be any nicer. The vibe was such that we felt as if we were at the home of a dear friend. The baked goods looked amazing and they have some gourmet treats on the shelves as well. My husband bought a jar of duck fat that really excited him. I am so happy to have found this place and can't wait to go in the morning for tea.You must stop by and say hello!
2015-08-24,5,Great location and they have good crepes. Their juices are also very delicious, especially the Lake Placid one
2015-08-22,3,3.5 starsCool, quaint little cafe. I'll start by saying that it appears they are more geared toward the grab and go crowd (for breakfast, at least) despite their outdoor seating - seems that the area is meant for sitting down at after you've grabbed a coffee or food item. Clearly a family run shop - very friendly bunch, and my order was taken and served by what appeared to be the owner's daughter.Let me start with, although I didn't get any coffee, I am picky with that, and they advertise using only Lavazza - my favorite beans, so major plus. Now, being my first time here, I kinda pigged out to try different items. First, if you're into yogurt, definitely get their yogurt with granola and mango pulp ($5) - it's crazy fresh and a great value, I'd come back for that alone. I also got the salmon on naan with dill sour cream ($8). This was also delicious - the naan was also super fresh, coming out on the plate nice and warm. I will say that there definitely could've been more salmon with only two pieces on the naan - queue the "well it was only $8!" arguments. Yes I agree, great price, but I regularly get fat bagels stacked with much more salmon in the same price range - some food for thought (pardon the pun). Finally I got their peanut butter smoothie ($5) - this was OK, certainly not a highlight. Taste was light on peanut butter, and the smoothie itself was kind of watery.Service was pretty slow, and I wasn't told until I asked for a check some time later that you had to pay inside at their square terminal - no problem, just wish I knew. Also wasn't offered a water, which may have been because I ordered a smoothie (still would've liked one), but I didn't actually get the smoothie until I was finished my yogurt and salmon naan. I actually saw people walk in after I ordered my smoothie, and walk out with a smoothie of their own far sooner than I received mine. These are the points that made me realize it's more of a grab and go place. Don't mean to be picky, I'm sure some of my points seem that way, but as the first review I wanted to be honest and detailed. Would certainly return.
