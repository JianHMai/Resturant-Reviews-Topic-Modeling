2021-10-29,3,I'll start by saying the food is always good here, what is not good is the rude hostess, which is why it is a 3 star instead of a 5 star.  I went recently with my wife and it was the first time I saw this particular hostess.  We came in and sat at the bar for dinner as we did somewhat often before we moved out of Hoboken a year ago.  The bartender was great and the other waitress was also very nice to us and talked and joked around with us even though she wasn't our server.  We wanted to plan a dinner with some friends a month out on a Wednesday night because they have never been there and we always tell them how great the food is.  While sitting at the bar after ordering our food, we asked the hostess to make a reservation when she had the chance to talk to us.  Before even telling her the date or how many people, she acted very annoyed that we would even ask for reservations and said it was waitlist only.  Meanwhile the entire inside restaurant on a Thursday night was empty from 5-6:30 and she took just took a reservation over the phone for 2 for the Friday coming up.  She seemed annoyed the entire night at everyone and everything.  She eventually got back to us 20 minutes later and took our number in case there was an opening.  I know you have good food and you have a lot of standing reservations, but if you want to be in the service industry, you have to try to be nice and try to be accommodating, especially if people want to come back to eat at your restaurant. During the pandemic, we were getting takeout there almost once a week and turned a ton of people onto Augustinos from our apartment who also got take out from there often during the pandemic.  Even now when we make it back to Hoboken, which isn't often we try grab dinner.  But if you are that disinterested in even attempting to make a reservation for someone and have a snooty attitude the whole time, not sure if we will be back.
2021-10-22,5,I went here last night with some friends and I was NOT disappointed. Italian food is a top 2 food group for me and Augustinos made that evident. I called to make a reservation about a week and a half ago and was not surprised when they told me that they have a wait list for reservations every day for the foreseeable future. I put my name and number down and was ecstatic when they called me the day before saying they had an opening. This place, to me, is a classic Italian restaurant. The service was incredible and they really made us feel at home. We asked for recommendations and they did not disappoint. For appetizers we got the fried calamari and clams oreganata. The breadcrumbs on the clams oreganata were to die for! Definitely recommend.  I went with the linguine and clams for dinner and it was delicious! I got a side of bread to dunk in the sauce which was very flavorful! Everyone at the table raved about their meals. Their menu is a bit limited, with classic Italian dishes, but they have different specials every night as well.To top of the night we got espresso martinis. It came in a huge martini glass and was one of the best I've had! It had a lemon in it, which I've never seen before and definitely questioned at first, but I stood corrected.Definitely call and get on the waiting list because it's worth it!
2021-09-25,5,Augustino's is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Northern Jersey. Their chicken parm/rigatoni is delicious as the chicken is tender yet crispy on the outside. Their pasta is cooked to be perfection! Also a fan of the fried calamari and stuffed artichoke. The artichoke is filled with flavor and perfectly executed! Broccoli rabe has so many fresh garlic cloves and not oily or dry like other places. Can't forget the bread and butter- because that makes or breaks the beginning of your meal. It's cash only so don't forget to go to the ATM before.
2021-08-17,4,My boyfriend and I came to Augustino's the other night because we wanted something on the fancier side. The ambience is very homey but fancy at the same time. We started with the burrata and split a caesar salad and both were very good. Then for entrees, my boyfriend ordered the chicken marsala which he said was "amazing" and I had the Linguine & Clams with white sauce which was also very good. The entrees are very large portions so you will not be disappointed. This unfortunately did mean that we were too full for dessert. We finished the dinner off with espresso which was good too. The only few issues were that our waitress didn't check on us too often, but we were able get her attention whenever needed. Also they're cash only, but that wasn't a problem because we checked beforehand and brought enough for our meal but if you don't bring cash with you, they suggest going to Napoli's (a pizza place just a few building down) where there's an ATM. Overall a really great experience, food was great, vibe was great and nice extensive menu.
2021-08-14,1,Service was horrendous. Hardly saw the waitress, never saw the bottle of wine we ordered, by the time that she appeared again, I was over it and the wait. Pasta dishes took over 45 minutes... PASTA!! Waitress never even acknowledged the ridiculous wait time or give us a heads up when the food will be coming out. She had an attitude from the beginning, like she was doing us a favor. Even heard table behind us complaining about lack of service. Food was good, nothing to write home about.
2021-08-08,5,The food was amazing. The veal chop with peppers and the Sunday dinner pasta dish are highly recommended. The service rivals a 5 star restaurant. Alyssa guided us through the perfect Meal. Make a reservation. I'll definitely dine there again.
2021-07-21,3,Pasta? Awesome. Meat? Overcooked. Literally the pork chop was so dry it tasted like it had hung out for a few days before they decided to serve it. While the service was nice, the woman at the front of house was rather rude and dampened the overall experience.
2021-07-16,4,Was looking for Italian food on a busy Thursday night and there was Augustinos . They were very friendly despite being quite busy - the servers are quite entertaining which just adds to the experience. We started off with red wines and Caesar salads - excellent ! The entrees included Spagetti and meat balls and a white pasta dish - again very good.  In sum, a solid choice in the competitive Italian food landscape of Hoboken - definitely will be back
2021-06-24,3,We came here as a highly recommended spot and left feeling that it had been a lackluster experience. Service was just okay - had trouble finding wait staff for water refills at times. Ordered bruschetta and calamari to start - both good, nothing to complain about but not super special. Got a variety of pasta dishes - gnocchi (this was the best), a pasta with broccoli rabe and sausage (good but pretty standard and VERY Parmesan-y), linguini with clams (good enough but a little fishy).We  sat outside - the outdoor seating area was very nicely built out and very large, but there was pollen all over the table and chairs when we arrived. I totally get that we're outside, but we had reservations so I feel a quick wipe of the table would have gone a long way.
2021-06-12,1,We live in the toll brothers apartments close to Augustinos.  We are locals, and like to support our jersey side as much as possible post covid, rather then giving nyc the biz.  Ordered take out and my bill was 113, and the cash I brought with me was 112.  For one dollar the hostess made a huge scene lol.  Next time pat me down for the $1, they should be embarrassed.  Will never order from there again and I will suggest others not to either.  Know your clientele!
2021-06-02,5,This place was recommended from our bartender at the hotel. Let me just say, he was spot on. The fact they got us a table of five in within an hour was fantastic. Not to mention, Ashley was our wonderful waitress and she never missed a beat. She was fun, energetic and just made the experience amazing. Our family is Italian picky, and the food was next to perfection. We got an array of items and each thing even down to the bread served was memorable.  I suggest if you're in the area to stop by and have a bite. You won't regret it.
2021-04-30,2,Heard so much, maybe I was expecting too much. Rude hostess, even ruder, disinterested waitress. (Claimed to be busy, didn't see it). Food was good.  But, I've had the same, some even better, In other restaurants.  Let's be clear, you're a restaurant, competing with many others.  You cannot behave as if you're better than your customers.  And that's exactly how you treated us.  Had to ask for things quite a few times.  Wont go back.  Can get the same food, without the hype and feeling thankful for allowing us to enter your establishment, in quite a few places.  Bottom line, food was fine, staff was not.  Look elsewhere.I miss Casa Dante.
2021-04-08,5,Amazing food and service! Double Pork Chops  with mixed peppers was the best I ever had! Can't wait to try the  Veal!
2021-03-14,5,Well, well, well! Where has this restaurant been all my life? My first time last night will definitely not be my last (assuming I can get another reservation! Lol). The food was delicious, the service was on point and made us feel like we were long time friends. Thank you Sharon, Christine and Lenny!
2021-02-26,5,Food is always great and the people who work there could not be nicer.  If you can't get a reservation try to get a seat at the bar. Recommend the Lamb Chop with spicy peppers.
2020-11-24,1,This place left alot to be desired. First of all they seated everyone outside while all the other surroundingRestaurants  had people indoors and it was cold out. The food was not good., I could have done better and I dont cook. The drink I ordered tasted more like Hawaiian  punch. If in neighborhood do your research.
2020-11-22,5,If your looking for high quality, perfectly prepared Italian food, this is the place. Can't go wrong with anything you order. Are portions a little small? Yes. Is it a little expensive? Yes. Will you find yourself going back despite of these two undesirable facts? Yes. It's incredible, try it.
2020-11-13,1,NEVER eating here again. I've eaten both in person and ordered takeout and gotten the same meal both times. I ordered takeout again, got the same meal, and they messed up the order and gave me completely the wrong thing including some missing food. I went back to ask them to correct it and they told me I must have ordered wrong. I tried to say that I've been there before and know what I ordered but they said it was my fault and refused to give me the right food (this is after I payed). I walked away because she was being rude then she CALLED ME TO TELL ME AGAIN THAT I WAS WRONG!! She ended the conversation with "never call here again" and slammed the phone (reminder, she called me). Horrible management. Only review I've ever left. Ruined my night.
2020-10-27,5,Talk about a total Hoboken experience. Augustino's isn't the easiest place to get a reservation, so luckily, my dad happens to know the owner which helped us get a table. They have a great outdoor seating right on top of Washington Street. Started with the carbonara pasta. Super creamy, saucy and delicious. I had the veal parmesan for dinner. Very big serving, and very tender. A completely delicious meal. I see negative reviews based on the service, but it might just be one of those places where if they know you, it's a totally different situation. We had a great time and and great service. I will definitely be back as soon as I can.
2020-10-20,5,Great old world Italian spot. I always get the shrimp parm over spaghetti. So good! Three appetizers last night on the specials list: seared scallops, artichokes francese, and burrata with prosciutto and roasted red pepper. So good!! And the bread - omg - just get a bottle of Chianti and eat the bread! And had to get the ice box cake - aka chocolate pudding pie in my opinion. Never disappoints - thank you!!
2020-10-11,5,Just wanted to update my review post Covid...  So happy they were able to construct such a beautiful and cozy outdoor dining area!  The food is still unreal and service is some of the warmest around.  My favorite spot in Hoboken and always the request of any visiting friends and family.
2020-09-05,1,DO NOT EAT HERE ..... I repeat DO NOT EAT HERE!Last night I went to dinner at Augustinos for the first time and definitely the last. I had complimentary bread served to me and I asked the owner(Sharon), since she was also serving ( I am guessing they were short staffed), for butter for the bread. Sharon comes out with the small bowl of butter, places it in front of me, and says " Here is your butter douchebag". I had also ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio. I drank some and then a fly goes into the drink. I asked the server if I can get a new glass and just a little of a fresh wine since I drank some already. The owner, Sharon,  then takes the glass out of the servers hands, places it down on my table then takes my spoon and takes out the dead fly in my wine and says " Don't be a wuss and drink it". I don't know if Sharon is very cheap, but she is absolutely very unprofessional and rude. When the check came, I then asked the owner if she can take just half of the price off for the wine since I never touched it after she refused to accommodate me, and her response was " Unfucking believable". Once she fixed the bill, she then slams down the bill on my table and tells me to " get the fuck out". She claims she was joking when she called me a douchebag, but as an owner you NEVER curse off customers or call them names. I have been to so many restaurants in my life, but never experienced this before. She then tells me that it's their "thing" that they curse at guests. On top of it all, the food was mediocre.
2020-09-01,5,On my quest to find good Italian in Hoboken, I gave this place a whirl. Their red sauce is so good, you can eat it with a spoon. It reminds me of Italian home cooking from an Italian grandma. The dishes aren't fancy, the place is known to be hard to get in, cash only and (in my opinion) over priced but if you want your food to taste like Italian home cooking, this is the place. I have been there a few times already...
2020-07-20,1,This was the worst dining experience in my 5 years in Hoboken. Living only doors from the restaurant, the 2 of us arrived promptly for our 5pm reservation. I'd say we were immediately seated in the empty outdoor seating, but that was not without initial attitude and a server pointing us in the direction of the tables. We ordered a bottle of wine and a couple starters. Before both of the starters had arrived we were hurried and asked aggressively 4 times by two different poorly mannared and mis-trained servers to place our entrée orders. This is all before 5:20. Their reasoning was some bone-in items take up to 40 minutes to prepare and to they need my table back by 7pm sharp. Possibly have some etiquette and suggest a simple pasta dish or salad if you need your table back IN 2 HOURS?? (Apparently someone else's money is greener and presence is more important than ours.) During this time we were tossed a carafe of water and a few empty glasses. Maybe in Augustinos you are supposed to serve yourself? I would assume this is the case as our wine glasses sat empty while the server tried arguing her point as to why we needed to hurry our first dining experience since March.By 5:25  we asked for our check, without having dinner, as we were were internally fuming and lost our entire appetite. Looking at the few post covid reviews here it is very obvious to me the staff and owners should evacuate the outdoor seating program all together and go back to locking themselves in the tiny restaurant with 6 tables so they can brag to each other how difficult it is to 'score a reservation in their establishment and just how lucky we the customers must be to get in to experience the overwhelming cloud of attitude and carelessness'.It is cash only as to not accommodate their customers and complicate their taxes come April. PS. Our white wine wasn't cold and the lobster was chewy.**Writers note**   Court Streets menu, service and 7 page wine list put this sham of a restaurant to sleep.
2020-07-18,1,I've given this place a lot of second chances over the last two years because the food is decent compared to other Hoboken restaurants but as of last night I've decided never to patronize them again and If I could give it zero stars I would: the staff has been incredibly rude every single interaction I've ever had with them. Pre covid, everyone knew how impossible it was to get a reservation due to their small number of tables and high demand. Despite knowing that I still tried a couple times and each time the woman answering the phone acted as if I were hugely offending her but not before laughing AT me for having even tried. During covid time while they have been take out only we've ordered from them three times and each time whoever answers the phone to take the orders says she cannot tell me how much my order will cost (this is a cash only biz so its a crucial piece of info for the patron picking up an order to know in advance$ nor how long it will take for pick up and that she will call me back with both answers "soon". I have never received a call back any time Ive ordered for pick up and have always had to call back multiple times for the cost and estimated pick up time only to be given huge attitude by the woman answering the phone and telling me "oh its actually ready now" I was about to call you. Icing on the cake was last night when my husband went to pick up our third and final take out order she asked him if his order was for "impatient Lisa" because according to her she called me back (of Course she had not). Who speaks to paying customers this way in person or on the phone?! We were absolutely floored and will not be returning the food is not worth the seriously bad attitude and vibes the staff gives off.
2020-07-11,1,Seems to be the only place in town that wont let you bring your dog to sit outside. We showed up today for our reservation with our small 12 pound bichon dog as we have to every other restaurant since outdoor dining has been opened up and sat at our table only for the hostess to come out and rudely say it was their policy to not allow dogs to eat in their outdoor area. Its fine, to each their own but in a dog friendly town like Hoboken, they will lose alot of business this way. We definitely wont be coming back.   Cant comment on the food.*if you want to be a smartass and say "leave your dog home", keep it to yourself, the point im making here is to inform other diners who go out to dinner with their dogs*
2020-05-18,5,Even during these crazy pandemic times, the food at Augustinos is just as delicious as ever - even as take out. My fiancé got the breaded pork chop with vinegar and hot peppers and he loved it! He says it's the best pork chop he's ever had! I got the veal parm with vodka sauce and it was amazing! Thanks Augustino's, can't wait to be back in person!!
2020-05-13,5,One of the best places I've ever been. The drinks, apps, entrees, and dessert are perfect. The meatball app was really good,  but the porkchops were perfect...best I've ever had and it's not even close. Finished with the icebox dessert which was great..loved talking to the staff as well. Cannot live within an hour and not check it out.
2020-05-02,5,Amazing food! We love this cute spot for date night! Missing it esp during this time so we order out! The Veal Parm is a favorite of mine along with there eggplant. But the best part is the ice box dessert!
2020-04-30,1,Ever since I moved to Hoboken, I have wanted to eat at Augustino's.  There is this hype surrounding Augustino's as being sort of the Rao's of Hoboken.  A place that's difficult to get a reservation that serves great food.  Given the current pandemic, my wife and I thought this would be a good chance to finally try Augustino's.  Knowing they are busy (even just doing takeout), we ordered at 4 pm with the hope to be eating sometime shortly after 5 pm.  I called to place our order and the woman on the phone sounded flustered.  She took my order and was very curt, however, polite enough.  She said she would call back to let me know when I can pick up the food and that it would be around 5 pm.We waited patiently and at 5:40 pm, I called the restaurant to check on the order.  This wouldn't have been the first time a Hoboken restaurant has messed up/or even missed our order.  Again the woman sounded flustered and I told her I was following up and that we've been waiting since 4 pm.  She told me I could come in five minutes.  I walked to the restaurant, go inside and I was asked which order I was there to pick up.  When I told her my name, the woman began berating me for calling to follow up on my order.  I was completely taken aback.  I felt like I was little kid being disciplined by my mom.  Imagine the audacity to follow up on an order after waiting an hour and forty minutes.  I waited a moment and tried to make a joke about it and this just further triggered her.  She went on a mini-rant, saying they're not making McDonald's back there.  She went on to say, she didn't care how long ago we placed our order because all of these other orders (pointing to the bags of food) were waiting just as long  The whole incident was bizarre.  I was getting the sense that in her mind I should be grateful they are allowing me to buy their food.  I starting thinking to myself that I should just leave, I don't need their food.  The total was $61 and I started sorting through my cash to get the money and I handed her $60 and was looking of a single dollar.  When I handed her the $60, she said it was $61, though she could clearly see I was still looking for another dollar.  Her level of impatience was unbelievable.  Who treats their customers like that?!?  I was nothing but polite through this entire situation.Now to the food.  We ordered calamari with sweet sauce, chicken parm and cheese ravioli.  I would not normally order chicken parm, however, I read so many rave reviews, I felt compelled to try.  The calamari was pizzeria quality.  It was not good.  If you want the best calamari in Hoboken (or perhaps the best you've ever had) go to Tutta Pesca.  Also, the owner there is kind and appreciative of his patrons.The chicken parm was good, however, I can get comparable chicken parm from a number of other restaurants in Hoboken without the side order of attitude.I can't speak for the ravioli, though my wife said it was OK.I've been to Augustino's two times, first and last.  This is unfortunate, because despite the average food this time, I would like to have tried something else that had rave reviews to see if they are as good as advertised.  One thing I can say with certainty is don't believe they hype!  There are better alternatives in Hoboken.
2020-04-01,5,Best Italian restaurant in the area. You can still order pickup. I tipped a $20 to the lady to show support. Shrimp parm is the best I've had.
2020-03-30,4,Wish this place easier to get into ! Small with a lot of demand for tables, sometimes you get attitude from staff , but they are always packed , straight forward Italian but really good
2020-03-11,5,If you want Italian food, there is no reason to eat anywhere else in Hoboken.  Seriously.  Tough to get a reservation but once you're in, make a reservation for next time before you leave.  Breaded pork chops.  The. Best.
2020-03-05,5,Where to start. This place is HARD to get into (you gotta know someone). It's hard to get into cause it's that damn good. It is New Jersey Italian American food at its finest. Their muscles in a white sauce will have you asking for more bread to keep dunking in the sauce, it's amazing. Their calamari, the best around. The legendary double cut Pork chops with vinegar peppers is the standard for all Italian double cut pork chops. When Sunday gravy is on the special menu, get it! The atmosphere makes you feel like your visiting your family on Saturday or Sunday night, it doesn't get better than this. Amazing food, great people, it doesn't get better.
2020-03-02,5,Yes, the hype is real here. They do not make them like this anymore. Small, family run and everything scratch made. They have items here that you just do not see in mainstream Italian restaurants any more (stuffed artichokes, bone in veal chops, etc.). The real star of the show here is the meat and seafood dishes, I would steer away from getting a pasta dish as an entrée (just a suggestion). The double cut pork chops at the table next to us looked out of this world. I got the bone in veal parmigiana and my girlfriend got the lamb chop special. The lamb chops might have been the best I have ever had. The veal parm reminded me of Chef Volas in Atlantic City. Over all get a reservation and come here, bring a wad of cash (credit cards not accepted) and take in the old school Jersey spot that is an institution and have a fantastic meal. You will not be disappointed.
2020-02-27,5,Small place with great traditional Italian  food with  old school and solid service. Come hungry and you won't be disappointed Parking is a challenge plus they only take cash.  It's worth the trip.
2020-01-19,4,Very good -- not as good as they think they are, but very good. You're not gonna be disappointed with any dish you order, so long as you know where you are and what you're doing.
2020-01-03,5,Always the best!!!! My favorite restaurant ever!Buddy, Sharon, Christine, Milan, Danielle, Fran and the gang are the greatest.Been going here since 2005 and the food just keeps getting better.  Cozy spot and they always change up the decorations for all the different times of year.  Makes you feel like you are home with family, and that's how they treat you.Love these guys.
2019-12-30,4,After hearing good things about Augustino's I finally came here for dinner tonight. We were started off with some complimentary bruschetta, which was too oily for me. For the appetizers, I tried the Fried Calamari, which was better than most that I've had, and the Fontina Cheese in Carozza, which is basically a fried cheese sandwich, which was also tasty and nice and cheesy.For my entrée, I ordered the Shrimp Marinara with Clams and Mussels. The dish as a whole was a nice combination of seafood on top of linguine with marinara sauce. The clams and mussels tasted pretty fresh and the linguine was cooked well. I was a bit disappointed that there were only a few shrimp in my dish though. The portion size is on the large side. The $30 price tag is probably a bit higher than it should be, but it might be worth it if you're a fan of seafood.At the time of my dinner, Augustino's only had two dessert options available: the tartufo and a cannoli. Naturally, I had to try both. The tartufo was ice cream with a milk chocolate shell. The shell was actually quite soft and easy to eat with a spoon and went well with the ice cream, which was vanilla and chocolate. There was also a cherry on the middle of the tartufo ice cream. The tartufo also came with a generous amount of whipped cream. The cannoli was pretty standard.It is important to note that Augustino's is reservation only, cash only, and dinner only. The restaurant is very cozy with a warm homey decor. Although the space is small (only 7 tables plus a bar), the noise level is reasonable. The staff is friendly and attentive. The service speed is kind of slow, but that is probably because they try to make the food fresh after the orders are placed.Overall, Augustino's definitely has solid Italian food with a home-cooked meal kind of vibe to it. I'm not quite sure if it's worth all of the hype and popularity, but I would still recommend it to anyone looking for a nice high quality Italian dinner.
2019-12-30,5,I am a chicken parm snob and I can confidently say that Augustino's has the best in the game! Can cut with a fork and melts in your mouth! I don't really deviate from the chicken parm, but I've had bites of the carbonara and stuffed artichokes among others and everything is phenomenal. Yes, you need to reserve a table (sometimes months in advance), but I've heard of people having luck walking in and grabbing seats at the bar to eat. It's a small space and there is only one table to accommodate a larger group, but they have a full bar. Sharon and the rest of the staff make the dinner so much more fun. Augustino's definitely lives up to the hype!
2019-12-17,5,Tough to get a table, but the food doesnt get any better.  I have dreams about this place. Portions are large, but everything is amazing.  Make sure to try it at least once.
2019-11-30,1,I know this place is tiny and requires reservations so i called this afternoon looking for any availability in the near future. The woman who answered the phone asked me what time i was looking for and offered an opening for 9pm tonight to which i replied was unfortunately too late for us. I asked about the next Saturday and she replied it was waitlist only. When beginning to inquire about the following weekend she cuts me off and with a condescending chuckle says they were booked through the rest of the year. OK. She did not offer any available dates so after some silence I chuckle back saying well i guess we won't be eating here. Her tone was annoyed and it was clear she did not want to deal with customers - ironic given you are in customer service. A typical hostess would offer the next available date or state they were booked and not accepting any reservations.What an off putting experience. If you don't want to talk to your customers than offer an online reservation service.
2019-11-29,2,Not sure why there is hype.  Very average food and very tired menu.  'Red sauce' tasted like a jar of Ragu.  Food Reminds me of Sbarros at the mall. Too expensive for what it is.  Something crispy we ordered came out shriveled and soggy-from the frig Not the fryer.
2019-11-22,5,The best Italian food I have ever had. The waitresses are sassy, which is excellent. Such a wonderful crew and excellent food. Will be back time and time again. If you do want to dine here though, make a reservation ahead of time. You'll thank me, the wait staff will thank you, and you'll thank yourself. It's a small place because its AUTHENTIC. Do us all a favor; make a resi so you can just enjoy the awesomeness of this fabulous establishment.
2019-11-21,5,**cash only and need a res** Living across the street from this place = heaven! All of the food is sooooo amazing here. Portions are large and it's a great spot to bring your friends and family when they visit Hoboken (my dad won't go anywhere else after I brought him here!) my favorites are the veal chop parm and the pork chops with longhots and vinegar. All of the pastas are delicious, esp the pomodoro. Whatever you order here, it's gonna be more than good.
2019-11-21,5,If you want old school red sauce Italian food  this is the spot... Shrimp marinara, pork chops, chicken parm, etc. They also make a great martini. Feels special when you are there.
2019-11-18,1,0 STARS in my opinion! My daughter made a reservation 4 months in advance  planning dinner for 5 of us on a weekend trip home from FL. We received two phone calls the evening of our reservation asking if we wouldn't mind changing our time. Sure, no problem for us. We arrived at 9:20 for our 9:30 reservation. A few minutes after 10:00 a table was cleared and reset. A party of 5 or 6 arrives and gesturing to management in the rear of restaurant, they immediately they sit them at this table. Very obviously a case of "who you know"!  We were extremely disappointed at how rude the employees were to us stating that "it is what it is, nothing we can do".  I messaged them privately for an explanation/apology. I received no response because clearly they do not care if they lose a customer or two. Plenty of other places in and around the area where we would be treated with gratitude and respect
2019-11-13,1,It pains me to write this, as I always looked forward to an upcoming Augustino's reservation. After this last visit, though, I will absolutely not be returning. Our group of five made a reservation three months in advance for 9:30pm. I'm a former Hoboken resident and was traveling from out of state for a super short trip, and booked this reservation as one of the only things I'd get to do with my family. The day before the reservation, they asked if we could make it 9 instead, only to call us an hour before our time and move it back to the 9:30 time. Sure, no problem. We show up for our 9:30 reservation, are not even greeted, check-in with the hostess, and assuming it will only be a few minutes, proceed to wait outside, as the restaurant is quite small. Mind you, it's freezing out. After about twenty minutes, we head in and stand against the wall waiting to be seated. Around 10:00, still patiently waiting, I tried to order two drinks at the bar. The woman who always mans the phone area says she'll bring me the drinks because I can't stand in her area. Another twenty minutes go by, still no drinks. At this point I accept that we're not getting our drinks, but I see them wiping down a table which I assume is ours. Wrong! Another group walks in around 10:15 and is immediately seated. Now irritated, I walk up to the woman near the phones and tell her we've been here for well over a half hour. She says the people that just sat had a 9pm reservation, ours was 9:30, so they get seated first. Mind you - they weren't even physically here waiting! If they called them and told them their table was ready, why couldn't they do the same for us? They saw us waiting there for about 45 minutes and never even had the courtesy to tell us to wait inside when we were standing out front. At this point, we are all exceptionally irritated. This woman was beyond rude, unapologetic, and condescending. She said 'there's nothing I can do. Everyone was late tonight.' Why wasn't I told that when she called me an hour before my reservation time instead of wasting our entire night? She acted as if it was our fault. I can't imagine speaking to people like this in general, let alone at the business you run. It was a horribly irritating and exceptionally embarrassing experience. I recently moved out of Hoboken and hyped this place up to my family big time, only for them to have this experience as first-timers. You can find delicious food on every single block in this city. Without good service, let alone horribly rude service, you don't deserve any of the CASH people pay to be there. They'll read this review and they won't even care, because all they care about is just that: the cash. Looking back it's now easy to see their entire schtick is all so fake and unauthentic.
2019-11-08,1,Service was not only terrible, but we constantly felt unwelcome. We asked to try the "house wine" prior to buying a bottle but we were quickly denied. After that we ordered the calamari, hoping to be better received, but no...aggressively judged for only ordering an appetizer. The whole time we were being rushed out despite buying more wine. The calamari was good, but the service very unfriendly. Would not recommend
2019-11-07,5,How much time do you have?  I ask this because it's a serious question.  The reason: you'll want to slow roll your way through this entire menu. I dined with a friend tonight and had the following: carozza w Fontina to start. Split several bc entrees (don't you DARE Judge) Chicken Parmesan with string beans, pasta carbonara and finally, farfalle pasta with spinach garlic and olive oil. We finished wit a cannoli from next door - spectacular. The stars give me away but DANG!!!! Augustino's was everything Yelp had promised. Possibly the best carbonara of my life (and I ate a ton of it in Italy) and this was..better, GREAT.  The farfalle did not disappoint either. Plus Denise, at the bar, is everything.
2019-10-31,2,It was good! Not great, but good. After making a reservation a month in advance, me & my two friends  were super excited to come here to dinner as we have heard all the amazing reviews & how it's the best. It's a cute little restaurant with great ambience. We started off with the calamari & the special grilled eggplant appetizer (with roasted red peppers & fontina). The eggplant was divine but I definitely had much better calamari elsewhere than what was served so I was disappointed. The entrees were pretty good (we got a variety ranging from meatballs, to shrimp francaise, to chicken parmigiana). But that's where it's ends. They were just really good. I truthfully couldn't say that this was the best Italian food I have ever eaten even though I wanted to so badly based on everyone's opinions and reviews of this place. It was just average which is unfortunate. This is where the 3 out of 5 strongly comes in: The waitress (who was very nice) checked on us a minute after we got our food to make sure we got everything and were satisfied. After that she literally did not come back for 25 minutes. We were sitting there patiently waiting with our plates ready to be wrapped (whether it be us to wrap our leftovers or them). I want to point out that me & my friends are pretty easy going so it didn't even both us that she didn't check on us for 25 min because we knew must have been busy. When she finally was able to handle our table, she wrapped our food and went about saying that she'll bring us the check. When she said she'll bring us the check, my friend politely asked if we could actually see a dessert and coffee menu. The waitress then said, "oh didn't the hostess tell you we need this table by 7:30pm? People are waiting for this table after you.". We told her no, as it's true that no one ever told us we have a time limit on our table. So she went to grab a dessert menu. At this point, we were thrown off because literally we were sitting there for 25 minutes without being checked on whereas the waitress could have checked on us within that time & we could have gotten our coffee and dessert fix in within the time frame they wanted us to be within. Anyway, me & my friends understand the turn around aspect of tables so we actually felt bad when the waitress brought the dessert menu out for us which so we immediacy declined and just asked for the check. Long story short, the experience was ok-ok overall. The food was good, don't get me wrong, but the food was not great. And also as mentioned, it was just really frustrating that we were told a party was waiting for us to leave after we weren't attended to for 25 minutes in which we could have ordered & ate our dessert as well as get coffee. There are definitely better places than Augustino's in Hoboken. I don't think I'll be returning any time soon.
2019-10-27,3,Cute, small Italian restaurant with friendly service! I recommend making reservations ahead of time (we called on a Saturday around 5:30pm to make a same day reservation for two and got a table for 6:30pm, but I think it was the only option they had and when we got there, it was pretty packed the entire time).Calamari was good and my date liked the veal, but I wasn't a fan of the orecchiette, which was the top recommended dish from the waitress. I personally thought it was a bit undercooked and too oily. They also gave us complimentary bruschetta to start, which was quite tasty! Warning: they are cash only.
2019-10-19,5,The scallops cooked in that special butter sauce was like a lead off homer!  I was mopping the sauce with the fresh bread, and the vino went right along.  The pasta was a sure hit.  Then, the grand slam double cut pork chop put us in a comfortable spot.  Game over, Augustino wins!  Great service from Christine and Denise!  Thank you Josh for the introduction.
2019-10-16,5,This place is totally worth the hype, and then some! Their complimentary bruschetta is spot on, all the apps/entrees are amazing (I got the chicken parm), and their chocolate icebox cake is one of the most amazing desserts I've ever had. Super cute vibe, friendly service and worth going to the ATM for (t her y don't take cards).
2019-10-16,5,Love this place! I wouldn't think of trying to come here without a reservation because they typically book up fast, and the restaurant isn't that big. They start you off with complimentary Bruschetta and bread. I We were a table of 6 guys and everyone loved their food, and we each had a different meal. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. They also have a full bar. Heads up, they only accept cash!
2019-10-04,5,Really one of the better Italian restaurants warm friendly service with top home cooked meals. Great experienceMoe I love you
2019-10-03,5,Best restaurant in Hoboken & it's not even close.  Exceptional staff that makes you feel at home & top notch food.  Some highlights include the mussels (red & white equally good), gnocchi bolognese, pork chops, country chicken, lamb chops.  Make sure to leave room for the ice box cake for dessert.  Highly recommended
2019-09-16,5,Augustino's is a time capsule from Hoboken's past. When you enter, you'll notice the kitsch of Sinatra and family photos, as well as a sign stating, "enter as strangers, leave as friends." I'd normally scoff at such things for being something more appropriate for a boomer's kitchen, but I'm more shocked at how accurately that they abide by these words. After arriving, we soon noticed that our reserved table was still occupied by a lingering party savoring their final morsel of desert and alcohol, so a waitress warmly, yet unapologetically ushered us to stand behind the packed bar, as to not crowd the tight quarters. We waited 20 minutes, but oddly, didn't very much mind the people watching. The front of house was exclusively run by a team of women, the lot of whom seemed to operate with the tightness you'd expect from years of working together. The customers seemed quite friendly with the staff, and vice versa. As we waited, we observed a man at the bar sharing photos of his eldest daughter with the bartender, and another man setting up the kind of jokes you'd save for close acquaintances. All this is to say that there is a fleeting quality with which the staff operates; their tone and demeanor is iconically New Jersey, pointed and sometimes unrefined, but it somehow was balanced with an affable and disarming touch. As far as the food goes, expect your traditional Italian American dishes, such as chicken or veal parmigiana, Francaise, and marsala. The dishes are exceptionally executed and will please the soul. There is very affordable wine for accompaniment that range between $20 and $35 per bottle; at such low prices, you can't expect the moon, but it suffices. When planning a dinner here, be prepared for the fact that they do not have a website, take reservations by phone, and accept cash only. Small inconveniences, but fitting for a charming 20th century experience you'll sure to have.
2019-09-15,1,Terrible customer service. I made a reservation for my birthday a month in advance. When I arrived for my reservation, they told me they didn't have any reservation under my name. I told them exactly who I spoke to and when and even showed them the phone call record and they told me that they call their reservations the day before to confirm and since I don't have proof of that phone call there was nothing they could do.  (Keep in mind only one table was seated at this time). I asked if they could seat us anyway, since clearly there was a mistake made with the reservation and they told me I must have gotten my dates mixed up when calling and that they could not seat us. A month later I receive a phone call to confirm my reservation. You tell me...who do you think got their birthday day and month wrong: me or the restaurant??
2019-09-05,5,Okayyyyy. Okay. I did it. I finally got my reservation at Augustinos. For my brothers birthday, I am pretty sure all he wanted was to go here and get lots and lots of food and wine. That we did!  The night started with bottles of really affordable wine. It's NOT byo but that is seriously no big deal because the bottles were really well priced.Appetizers included: Sauteed Broccoli Rabe, mussels in white sauce, fried calamari and a salad with shitaki mushroom and goat cheese. Everything was amazing! Calamari was perfectly crispy, with some lemon I barely needed the marinara sauce. The salad was a special so I am not sure if they have it all the time but I loved the sauteed mushrooms in it and the fried goat cheese was warm and creamy and oh my God I could have stolen them all for myself. The Broccoli Rabe was crunchy and delicious. Oh, also the complimentary bruschetta for the table was something I'd choose over  endless amounts of bread I am sure to get full on. For dinner I got the Seafood Marinara because I couldn't decide between a fish dish and a pasta dish. BOOM. Best of both worlds. It was  perfectly al dente pasta with a great sauce and all of my favorite shellfish all in one bowl. Shrimp, mussels and clams. Perfect dish. I was stuffed by end but refused to leave a scrap on my plate. It was all that good. The night wrapped up with with some dessert with a candle in it. Hope to be back super soon. P.S. ITS CASH ONLY
2019-07-26,4,Ok, I had to return to update my one star review since now I've actually dined at this establishment. After failing to secure a reservation, I received a call on Thursday afternoon to alert me of an opening that evening. Luckily, we were available and jumped at the chance to experience the Augustino's mystique. Alas, it lives up to the hype. After arriving for our reservation, we were asked to stand along the wall at the bar where we were served drinks by a gruff bar keeper. The mild assertiveness is all part of the experience. We were quickly seated and ordered the calamari and stuffed artichoke as appetizers. Both were fresh and authentic. I ordered the Sunday Sauce, since others had advised this was a must. Unfortunately, they were out, but the waitress suggested an alternative consisting of meatballs, sausage and rigatoni, which proved to a great substitute. My husband ordered the famed pork chop in red wine sauce, and my sister ordered the veal marsala. All three portions were absurd, and each of the sauces that accompanied the entree were delicious and certainly the star of each dish. We didn't leave room for dessert; I would have loved to try the ice box cake. We will have to return again - that is, if I can get another reservation!
2019-07-24,5,Really great experience at Augustino's. I dined at Augustino's at 6 pm on a Wednesday. Definitely make a reservation beforehand - there are only 8 tables in the restaurant and getting a walk in table is highly unlikely. The meal begins with bruschetta and warm italian bread. The bread was excellent - very fresh and some of the best restaurant bread I've had in a while. We started with the Calamari, which was very flavorful and crunchy. There were 3 of us and it was a good size for all of us to share. The meals arrived and portions were HUGE. I got the Carbonara while the others got the Cheese Ravioli and the Pasta Special of the night - which included penne pasta with gravy, a giant meatball, sausage, and beef. Everything was so delicious, but we were all unable to eat more than half of our meals because they were so large. Service was good. Each course of food came quickly and our waitress was very friendly in answering our questions. Overall great experience and would highly recommend!
2019-07-24,5,Classic Old school Italian restaurant with amazing food like your grandmother makes. Love the specials and of course the chicken parm! The mussels are amazing in either the red sauce or the wine sauce - I've had them both. Love the complimentary bruschetta they bring you after you order. It's to die for.
2019-07-21,1,I had linguine with clams wasn't the best disappointed because I was expecting better based on all the hype this restaurant got pricey
2019-07-20,3,Service was bad.  I had to keep asking for water, bread and your basics.  Food taste is delicious can't complain there however the prices are higher than NYC and one would think since they only take cash, prices would be a little more reasonable.   What  turned my opinion from good to bad was seeing the owner counting cash as if it was the only thing that mattered.  Won't go back.
2019-07-16,1,We just had dinner at Augustino's I don't understand the great reviews.. this is typical Italian American food nothing extraordinary.. if you really want authentic Italian food go to from scratch in Ridgewood or better yet go to Stella artisan in Ridgewood.. but I'm sorry Augustino's doesn't even come close to really Italian food.. again typical Italian American and pizzeria food..
2019-07-12,1,***Written by my brother based on his experience*** I've been to Augustino's multiple times over the past few years and I never thought I'd be here writing a 1 star review. Tonight, as a table of 4, we decide to go all out and order 3 appetizers, our 4 entrees, 2 bottles of wine, 2 desserts and coffees. All the food was delicious as usual. After paying the bill, we started to leave the restaurant thinking we had another great experience at Augustino's. Things suddenly turned as we were literally stepping outside when the waitress chased us down and started to complain about how much money we left as a tip. The waitress asked if I was sure I left the right amount because she claimed I left only a 10% tip. I explained to her that my preference is to only tip 20% on the food total and not on the wine. She seemed to not be pleased at all with my reasoning. I ended up leaving some additional cash and turned and walked out.I understand people have their own opinions on how to tip when it comes to meals which include alcohol and whether to tip fully on just the food, the alcohol and even the tax. Regardless, what set me off was that the waitress stopped a customer as they were leaving the restaurant to complain about how much tip they left - this completely baffles me! As a customer, I have every right to tip what I think is appropriate based on the experience I had. Instead of accepting the tip as is and letting me go on with my day, these people decided it was worth the extra $10 to potentially piss off 4 customers who will probably never return and receive this review.This just goes to show how poorly some businesses value customer service for the long term benefit of their business.
2019-06-20,5,Interior - 5Food - 5Staff - 5Authenticity - 5+First things first... if you've never been there before, then hit the ATM. This place is old school in all ways, to include payments... CASH ONLY!!Walking in, it's about 10' wide and 30' deep. There are about 8 tables with different seating capacity, and a great bar with about 8 stools. Old wood, brick walls, old photos... I immediately felt this was going to be great! I'd say we were the only ones that were not local. The staff was classic Jersey... welcoming, attentive, direct, and without pretense.  I miss that warm, edgy interaction. Now, the main attraction... I had a good fried calamari with a spicy sauce on the side, and my wife had a special appetizer of egg plant rolled with pancetta and fontina, drizzled with balsamic reduction... superb!Well, these guys serve large portions, but I had to get a taste of the Carbonara. Luckily, our server offered a HALF portion! Perfect. That was a table dish we shared, and it was the best I can remember ever having. I almost wish it had been a full serving. Entree:  I had the Veal Piccata which was executed perfectly, but even with perfect veal, I was out ordered by my wife's order of the daily special, sausage lasagna. I had some, and that was the best I've ever had, period. Unlike other outings, I was not offered much of her dish... I do understand, though. Despite the drinks, wine, and previous food offerings, I had read of their Ice Box Cake for desert. Of course, we order it to share... Pretty darn good, and it goes down easy, not too heavy.  I think it's mostly chocolate pudding and graham crackers. I went to high school in New Jersey many years ago, and as I return to Texas, I feel like this dinner experience will be with me for a long time.  I will have to find some way to return. Augustino's, thank you for a wonderful night.
2019-06-10,5,Literally the best Italian food around. 100% worth every penny. Service is great, food is excellent and wine selection is perfect.
2019-05-11,5,Just got home from Augustino's. This will be my shortest review ever. This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever dined in. Great food. Great atmosphere. The pics can do the rest of the talking. Get there!
2019-05-09,1,please tell me why this place is rated good? It's not! Got two pasta dishes, both were below average... one tasted like mac n cheese made by marsha brady and other one lacked flavor.I guess service isn't great either, like they're doing you a favor for paying for a good meal... and in cash !!! overrated, maybe it was good at one point but def not recently..umm plenty of much better italian places with better friendly service... even if their food is amazing (which it is not)... service ruins the entire experience. seriously chill guys... this authentic italian meal experience is ruined mainly service and also by food...  in one sentence - get off your high horse when you're below average.
2019-04-09,4,Love this place! My boyfriend took me here one night. Love the owner! She's amazing. Service was fantastic! We had mussels and bread, and chicken parm. Best chicken parm we've ever had!! Great portion sizes. A little pricey but well worth it! Only downfall, and why I've given 4 instead of five stars, is they are cash only. It's inconvenient. We will be back though! Very busy little place. I def recommend making a reservation.
2019-03-25,5,If you grew up in an Italian household going to Augustinos feels just like home or even better being at grandma's house. There is a lot of hugging, kissing and honeys and even a little hand holding if your lucky. People have written reviews with complaints of the staff being "rude," but really they are to the point and don't have time to answer ridiculous questions over the phone on a Friday night. They are the busiest restaurant in Hoboken hence why it's impossible to get a reservation or table on the fly and they are truly the furthest from rude. Aside, from the wonderful staff (Sharon especially), the food is top notch, the most delicious and authentic Italian food in Hoboken. The portions are large leaving plenty to leftovers or even get a meal to share. They have the classics with a large menu of options and fantastic specials. It's not a cheap meal but you get what you pay for here, a cozy atmosphere, excellent food and a great time - worth every cent. Tip: make a reservation months in advance or go early or late in the evening and hang out the bar to see if something opens up.
2019-02-28,2,I give this review not because of the food, it is delicious.  But the service and the attitude is awful.  They are rude and presumptious and think that the customer owes them vs they owe the customer a nice experience.  They are so obnoxious that the owners sister has the gall to sit at the bar instead of allowing a standing customer.  Places like these are obsolete and Augustinos in the long run will not be relevant.  In the end there are a million Italian restaurants
2019-02-23,5,You can't go wrong here! The food is fantastic (the pork chop is insane). The service is awesome (funny and attentive). Make your reservations early and enjoy.
2019-02-23,5,I've been eating at Augustino's for over 19 years and can attest that their food is consistently excellent! The specials are the best: Eggplant rolatini, artichoke heart franchase, penne bolognese...  And the staff make you feel like family. (cash only)
2019-02-13,5,Came here for an early V-Day dinner, food was even better than I remembered from an earlier visit, everything was great! Thanks for the great service and plan on returning again soon.
2019-02-10,3,My husband and I bought a gift certificate for my son and daughter in law for Christmas because they live in Hoboken and we heard so much about this place.While they said the food was really good they said the service was annoying. They were pretty much pushed out told more then once they had to leave because people had standing reservations. I get this is a small very popular place but you may want to inform people that have early reservations about this policy(they had 5:30 yesterday the 9th). I also think instead of giving people an hour and half two hours would be better especially for new parents looking forward to an evening out. This is a pricy restaurant so it just seems rude to push people out.
2019-02-07,5,Best Italian food i have ever tasted! Friendly owners and staff. Small, intimate ambiance. Generous portions. Definitely a must try!!!!
2019-01-18,5,Great Italian restaurant.   Sharron is an awesome owner/waitress, makes you feel right at home.  Food is some of the best Italian food. Chicken parmigiana and breaded pork chops are a must.  And make sure it is someone's birthday.
2018-12-12,2,I give this review not because of the food, it is delicious.  But the service and the attitude is awful.  They are rude and presumptious and think that the customer owes them vs they owe the customer a nice experience.  They are so obnoxious that the owner's sister has the gall to sit at the bar instead of allowing a standing customer the seat.  Places like these are obsolete and Augustinos in the long run will not be relevant.  In the end there are a million Italian restaurants
2018-12-04,5,Been lucky enough to come here a bunch of times & it's always a delicious, enjoyable meal. Love the family vibe from the servers. Everything I've had has been great but the Pork Chops are a must.
2018-12-03,5,Food is incredible! The staff is extremely friendly and really makes you feel like family. One of the best Italian spots in Hoboken!
2018-11-20,5,The best Italian restaurant in NJ. They have a fairly simple menu but everything they do is great (They do have tons of specials though). The staff is friendly and I guess if there was a criticism it is that reservations are hard to come by as it is a small spot with lots of set reservations.
2018-11-03,1,One thing I learned from watching Top Chef. You can have mediocre food and a great 'front' and you will come back. The corollary to this is that you can have great food and a lousy 'front' and you will not return. This is the case.My son and daughter in law took out my wife and I out for dinner to a place that is almost impossible to get a reservation. He said the Veal Parm is outstanding. The food was outstanding..but.....After the appetizers, my DIL, came back to the table from the bathroom and told us that when she walked out, one of the servers (not ours) bumped into to her and dropped a really hot plate of chicken or veal parm on her upper arm. IT WAS HOT. She came back to the table; told us the story, and she moved on---with a hot irritated arm and wet shirt.No one apologized to her. No one asked if she was ok. No one from this renowned place took any interest in what happened to a customer.My son received the check and paid the bill. I asked him if they did anything, such as comp the desert. He didn't know. I went to the back and saw the 'boss' and said..'did you do anything on the check? She said she didn't know. I said..'you should at least comp the desert'. She said she would take care of it.They came back to the table and took back his change. They returned and gave him the change and, in another hand, gave him some $, and whispered something to the effect..'we took 1/2 off'. He thought the entire bill. No..they gave him $15 for a $30 desert.Three of us left. He did not. He came outside and told us that he went back in and said...'my dad says the veal parm and cannoli were the best he's ever had. The response was that 'he was nasty'. My son then told them again the same thing and said that they did not handle the burning of his wife's arm properly. They said...'...we'll pay for cleaning her shirt or her doctor's bills...' He was disgusted and left.Still no apology. No concern whatsoever.An establishment that does not respect and value their patrons does not deserve any loyalty. You may not care about this review...but buyer beware. The place is so small and the personnel/owner careless and indifferent...a bigger problem is bound to occur.
2018-08-03,4,Great food and atmosphere. Staff is friendly and a bit crazy. My only gripe with the place is the reservation policy. You can ask them about that.
2018-08-02,5,We were recommended by a local and we loved it! The atmosphere, the decor and the service were perfect. The food delicious. The flavors were combined perfectly and the food was fresh and hot. We loved the crowd and the owner just seemed to know everyone, greeting and chatting, we felt like friends when we left.
2018-07-27,5,Place is just amazing! Our waitress Sasha was great it was our first time and she recommended things and was spot on. Can't wait to go back again!!
2018-07-25,5,The bruschetta was excellent, a nice starter to the meal, bread that is toasted and warm, with cool fresh tomatoes on top.Gnocchi Bolognese was excellent! The sauce is done very well, with a good mixture of meat and cheese. The pasta itself was done right (not a lot of people can do gnocchi right, but this place definitely executed this dish perfectly)Mussels, we got them in red sauce (hot) excellent. They were cooked perfectly and tasted fresh.Clams Casino, interesting to put bacon into these, but it was delicious. Again cooked to perfection.Veal piccata, a nice light and flavorful butter sauce over pasta.Veal parmesan, lots of red sauce over pasta ... The red sauce is key, so good you have to dip bread into it to soak up what you might have missed.Also, I ate at the bar, Lenny is awesome and knows how to run a bar.I'd definitely come back to try out some of the other dishes, from what I had this place is great... Make sure to get a reservation as space fills up quickly.
2018-06-30,1,If you're looking for an enjoyable dinning experience, this is not the place. The professionalism and quality you'd expect from a white tablecloth restaurant was no where to be found at Augustinos. Took my mother here during her first trip to Hoboken and was embarrassed.
2018-06-10,5,Came over from the city to hang out with a friend and we stopped by on the off chance we could get in. Sat at the bar and it was the best Italian and floor show I've had in ages. We could have bathed in the bolognese and the rack of lamb was falling off the bone. And the waitress kept us in hysterics all evening. Beware the heavy handed pour of the bartender hic!
2018-06-04,5,So... there's a mystique about Augustino's. Hard to get a reservation. Food that is supposed to be on a whole other level. It is a very powerful and mysterious mystique, and it's mystery is only exceeded by its power. Anyone catch what I just did there?Through a friend who's gotten close with the staff there, we came in on a Saturday night. The place certainly has an old school feel with maybe half a dozen tables. So how good could a small, red sauce Italian place in Hoboken be? Pretty goddamn good. We shared a few orders of fried artichoke hearts, francese style (didn't know that was a thing for fried artichokes), and a veal bolognese gnocchi. Both dishes were awesome. The sauce for the artichoke was some of the best francese sauce I've had. It was light and felt heavier in butter than cream, yet not heavy. I used up ever bit of bread to soak it up. The gnocchi was light and fluffy, and the sauce rich and creamy. Two for two. For my main, I ordered the breaded pork chops with hot peppers. When the dish arrives, it's two giant double cut chops. This must have been two pounds of meat. I couldn't even polish off a full chop and ended up bringing home more than half of it. It came with a side of rigatoni in tomato sauce which was way more flavorful than most of the pasta and red sauces I've had. Oh, and for the record, the leftover chop reheated in the oven fantastically two days later. For dessert, we shared some cannoli and the ice box cake. Once again, both truly excellent and again, large sizes. Don't let the slightly high price tag scare you off. It's double the normal price because the portions are double the size. They'll also do a half order of just about any dish, but why do that? You've come so far just to get here, and who doesn't love leftovers?Price per person came out to around $85 per person all in, including tax, tip, and several bottles of wine. This place lived up to the hype. Absolutely give this place a try. Pro tip... you have a better chance of getting a reservation walking in and asking for one then you do calling it inExtra bonus pro trip... they also do take out.
2018-05-26,5,We love this place. There hasn't been a thing on the menu that we haven't liked.  I personally especially like the rigatoni Sunday gravy with meatballs. It's a small place but we always feel comfortable. Sharon who is the owner's wife is always very nice funny accommodating and at the end of the meal i usually get a kiss on the cheek. Forget the food a kiss from Christine is worth it alone. My only complaint is the parking sucks in Hoboken. Sometimes we get there and find a parking space and have to hang out for 45 minutes at a time as we drive around looking until we find one and just barely make it on time.Augustino's is excellent.  Parking in Hobloken sucks.
2018-05-09,5,Amazing service, atmosphere, and food. The service is on point, quality of food and attention to your experience is top notch. Veal chop with vinegar peppers was beyond reproach. Rigatoni Bolognese was lights out. I'll go back, very soon.
2018-05-03,4,Cash only and worth every dollar.  Old school, red sauce joint turning out classics.  Great apps but save room for the veal parm on the bone.  One of the best renditions of this dish.
2018-04-14,3,My friends ate off the menu and loved the place. We had specials, Sunday meat grill and the Veal Milanese - - - top quality meats, but the sauces were quiet.  The hot calamari appetizer was excellent.  Personally I thing the small 10 table venue limits the ease to get in there, and I guess that is the majority of its appeal. Staff is really cool, enjoyed the service and their down home style of dealing with patrons.
2018-04-08,4,Delicious food, bad manners from the hostess. My friend and I had a reservation, which the hostess repeatedly denied, but when she double-checked her reservations book she found it and didn't apologize. Our server was lovely. Service aside, I loved the clams oreganata and the crusty bread. I got a rigatoni with Sunday sauce that lasted me for TWO MORE LEFTOVERS (needed bread to supplement the second leftover, but still) and I was happy to eat that pasta for three meals - the gravy was very very rich (I suspect lots of butter) and the meatball and braciole were *Italian chef kiss*. Pricey but you get a lot for your money. The wine is also inexpensive.
2018-02-03,5,If you're Italian, your parents would love this place.  In the 3 years I've lived in Hoboken, I had yet to try it.  I called for a same-night reservation on a Saturday and was able to land a table with my friend due to a cancellation.  The staff are very funny and welcoming.  There were two pasta dishes I wanted, so they offered me half and half.  We both agreed our dinners were the best Italian we've tried in town. And the icebox cake is perfect!  Hope we're able to come back soon.
2018-02-02,4,We came to Augustino's at 5:30PM on a Thursday (since that was all that was available for 4 weeks) before Christmas. The restaurant is tiny and I mean TINY but it gives a very welcoming, intimate vibe. One thing I noticed immediately was that the waitresses & the rest of the staff work together - at no point was I trying to flag down our waitress, because a different one was already willing to help. I was surprised to find that their wine bottles we're extremely reasonably priced. For apps we had the calamari and the stuffed artichoke, I wasn't impressed with the artichoke, but it was good. For dinner we had veal francaise and chicken Parmesan - both were very tasty. For desert we had the ice box cake and I'm still dreaming about it - this coming from a usual non desert eater.PS - no credit cards, bring ya cash!
2018-01-29,5,My wife and I have been to all the great Italian restaurants in the city and Augustino's gives them a run for their money. We had an incredible night there with another couple who live in Hoboken. This was easily the best restaurant we've been to (Anthony David's a close second if you can't get reservations here). Before we get to the food I have to say the staff is amazing. Not sure if this is a family business but they seem like one big family. They are all fantastic and happy to help make decisions for you or tell you that you are ordering wrong. I gave our waitress two options and she knew what I needed. My breaded pork chops with vinegar and hot peppers was one of the best pork chop dishes I've ever had. Two double cut pork chops (one came home with me)!  Everyone else had amazing dishes but if you like pork chops I say go for it. The complimentary Bruschetta was great and the appetizers were good but I'd suggest skipping them and saving room for your meal and dessertPrices are also super reasonable
2017-12-13,5,Everything at Augustino's is amazing - literally love all of their appetizers! Intimate setting with a friendly staff makes the experience that much more enjoyable too.
2017-12-08,2,I actually don't get most of these reviews as I experienced the exact opposite. The service was warm and friendly. Very attentive. The food , at best , was just ok. But I didn't find it good at all. And I'm not particularly difficult to please. Just give me something tasty and I will eat it. We didn't get that.
2017-11-26,4,Hard to get a reservation. Good fun in a classic small Italian joint that serves up really good food. Fun staff. The only issue is cash only, which is a bit of a pain when trying to expense something. Will come back
2017-11-13,5,Best Italian place in hoboken! If you want traditional, over the top Italian food this is the place! The staff is knowledgeable, courteous and pleasant. If you go, and don't get the pleasure of meeting Sharon (the Owner) then keep going back till you do. She has a contagious smile that lights up that whole place, with a heart of gold. Definitely worth every penny!
2017-10-20,5,My first time there and it was great from beginning to end.  Atmosphere , service, food everything was a great experience. We had some of everything.  I had the veal chop which was delicious , better than Chef Vola.  Got the reservation because of a cancellation , I hope we can get back in next time we are in Hoboken. Thank you to all the staff.
2017-09-27,5,This is my favorite spot in Hoboken. Food is great and they make you feel like you're part of the family. Haven't sat at a table yet (maybe one day) but the bar seating is way more fun anyway! I've been here several times and typically order a new meal each time--all of which have been great!!
2017-09-21,1,Supposed to be good food by the reviews but rudest staff and hostess I've ever met. Called and asked for reservation, they said 9pm and lady quickly hung up. Showed at at 8 to sit at bar and wait for table, told us no tables, no 9pm reservation, and denied I even called. Totally rude and abrasive people, not getting my one penny of my money. Better Italian elsewhere. Do yourself a favor and eat at places where they'll accommodate you and treat you with the customer service you deserve. No wonder Hoboken and NYers get a bad rap, because of rude inconsiderate workers like this. You should be ashamed.
2017-08-18,5,Nothing beats this place. Sharon treats everyone like family, complete with kisses and hugs hello & goodbye! We had my dad's surprise 80th birthday party here and everything was perfect. When I go I usually order an entree and have either the pasta pomodoro or the Farfalle  pasta for appetizer!  Can't go there with out having one of those two dishes. Some other exceptional meals on the menu- shrimp in brandy sauce, lemon chicken, Sunday gravy. The bartenders also make fabulous martinis!
2017-08-03,5,The food is absolutely delicious here.   I've always been a huge fan of their chicken parm ... until I had the veal parm.  Now there's no turning back.  Wow.  Also love their mussels, Sunday gravy, fried calamari.  Meatballs are huge and very tasty.  Small venue and tough to get seating.   Plan ahead or stop in early or late.
2017-07-27,4,Augustine's was a little restaurant with a homie feeling. I went here due to the raving Yelp reviews, and it payed off. The chicken parm was great and the portion sizes were very big. I have always finished my meals, but the chicken parm sent me packing with leftovers. The $25 bottle of wine was sweet and went with our meal. The waitress we had was a little rugged, but the over all experience was great. I would definitely go back.
2017-07-13,4,We had dinner last night and the food and service is as good as it gets. I have been there many times have never been disappointed. It's a real throw back atmosphere. The interaction with the owners and staff are worth the price of admission.
2017-07-07,5,Yup.  Believe the hype.  Getting a reservation is next to impossible but if you can get in?  WORTH IT.  the chicken parm is to die for.  The waitresses are sassy.  The wine constantly flows.  Best Italian food in Jersey
2017-06-16,3,Tonight was my 2nd time eating at Augustino's.  It was fine - not as memorable a meal as the attitudes by the staff in the restaurant would suggest, but the 3 stars were because my dad and stepmom had a wonderful time and what they felt were great meals (chicken parm and shrimp scampi) for an early Father's Day celebration.  We had a 5:30 reservation and were the only table seated as they just opened. After 10-15 minutes I asked the 3 ladies standing at the bar area for menus and one actually said 'Someone will be with you shortly' instead of handing us menus! One of the 3 had the smarts to do so before the bad taste in my mouth actually settled. After we ordered I had to ask for bread since we didn't get any. Again, our meals were fine but nothing I would go back for. My linguine in clam sauce was tasty but more on the watery side. My husband's pasta in di Pomodoro was also ok - the bottom line is nothing on the menu is exciting, current or authentic. Please note, I am not looking to bash the place at all and this would have just qualified as a passable meal without any review if this didn't happen: when we were handed the check, a tip of 20% was included because as I was told we were a party of 5. They included my 4 year old daughter in the head count (which is as ridiculous as charging $10 for her side of pasta in marinara sauce), and I guess if these are the rules they play by it doesn't matter if guests have to request menus or bread...Bad taste definitely settled after this.
2017-06-16,5,After hearing a lot of hype about Augustino's from coworkers, friends, strangers - my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday last week and it was everything we've heard and more. He made a reservation for a Wednesday night about 2 weeks out and we took the last table so definitely plan ahead for your dinner here.We bought a bottle of Cabernet at the bar and started drinking while we waited for our table. I was pleasantly surprised by how cozy the interior was, and how boisterous the diners were. We were seated and our waitress gave us and the table next to us the specials at the same time - no frills in delivery but we came to eat, not to have our butts kissed :)We ordered the calamari as an app and it was my favorite part of the meal - perfectly crisp, not too big or too small, and we got the mild and medium sauce and they were both delicious. As others have mentioned, the house bruschetta is delicious as well. For mains, we had the chicken parm and the carbonara. I loved the chicken parm and had 2 lunches leftover. My boyfriend really enjoyed the carbonara, and the bacon is very prevalent in the sauce - however it was too heavy for my delicate stomach.We will certainly be back soon and highly recommend!
2017-06-09,5,Similar to my last review, but I have now eaten here about 10 times. The food is excellent, but everything else I wrote last time remains true.
2017-06-02,5,Awesome food and service. We went with a group of six and made the reservation two months in advance. We ordered both clam apps and calamari. I had the chicken parm and my boyfriend had the pork chops. Everything we had was great. The entree portions are huge
2017-06-01,5,Very good food - Probably the best Chicken Francaise I've ever had.  You will have to book a reservation in advance (I would say a month or two for weekdays, much longer for weekends) but it is definitely worth the wait.  Food is reasonably priced ($22 for Chicken Dishes, a little more expensive for Seafood).  If I remember correctly, the Pork Chops were about $34.50 but those dishes are probably the equivalent to 2 to 3 meals in terms of the amount of food you get.  The Chicken Parm is also very good.Definitely recommend!  Already booked a reservation for later in the year.
2017-05-31,5,Small spot with a ridiculously long wait..BUT SO WORTH IT. The food here is as good as the food I had when traveling in Italy. I'm actually going there this Saturday and cannot wait to indulge.
2017-05-23,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken! Make sure to call well in advance to make a reservation and bring cash. Came here a few months ago and got the pork chops while my girlfriend had the chicken parm. Both were amazing!!!I would definitely recommend this place over Trattoria Saporito if you are looking for Italian food in Hoboken.
2017-05-17,5,First and best example of New Jersey Italian. It was about 5 years ago, but has left a memory so vivid - I had to retroactively review this place with confidence - ever since I started using Yelp. Small, exclusive space. The only reason I believe we got a table, was because my buddy used to be a regular with a standing reservation. Hopefully I can go back soon. If you're local, find a way to lock down a table - if possible.
2017-05-09,5,One of my favorite italian restaurants in NJ. The country chicken off the bone is AMAZING. It takes 45 minutes to prepare but it is so savory with a spicy kick it is worth the wait.  The chicken parm, fantastic. Mussels a must have, along with bruschetta and the farfalle. Sausage is sage. Small cozy place. The service is friendly and comforting.
2017-05-05,5,Probably the best pork chop I've ever had in life. And I don't even like pork chops, so that's saying a lot. My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday at 6 pm. Almost everything you've read is true - giant servings of pork chops that you won't be able to finish, cash only, and needing to make ressos weeks in advance. But I'm not sure about these other reviews saying that the staff was rude. They were super nice to us and made us feel like we had been going to Augustino's for years, even though it was just our first time there.To start, they give you some bread, as well as two complimentary pieces of bruschetta with tomatoes. This was amazing. I could have just eaten a whole plate of these for dinner. We also ordered the clams casino to start, which are clams on the half shell with breadcrumbs and bacon. Can't really go wrong with anything with bacon in it.To drink, we decided to order their $20 bottle of riesling that everyone was talking about. It was too sweet for us, but it's a pretty good value if you like sweet wine. Augustino's is not BYOB but their other bottles are pretty reasonably priced as well.For entrees, he ordered the Breaded Pork Chops with Vinegar and Hot Peppers. This came out sizzling, as two thick pieces. I ordered their special of the day, which was a Prime Ribeye cooked in a spicy tomato sauce. This was a huge piece as well, and I was only able to finish about half of it. Entrees come with a small side of pasta in marinara sauce.Tip - they charge $5 for sharing dishes so you might as well just order your own and take the rest home for lunch the next day.
2017-04-19,5,CHRISTINE IS THE GREATEST WOMAN ALIVE. WE LOVE HER. Every single time we come here, we have an incredible experience. The food is authentic Italian food with great flavors and the space is super cozy. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area.
2017-04-14,3,This review is based on eating at Augustino's three times.  The food is outstanding and maybe the best Italian you'll ever have.  That said, the service is awful and obnoxious.  The owners, bar tenders and servers are all very aggressive and short.  If you want to make a reservation, know exactly when you are willing to eat because they have limited availability and the whole call will last less than thirty seconds.  Once the owner accused us of not calling ahead, when in fact we had called twice to confirm.You also have to understand "Augustino's speak".  For example, they will offer you water - sparking, flat or Hoboken's finest.  We misinterpreted the last two to be the same thing since most places around here don't offer bottled flat water.  The waitress seemed annoyed when we clarified that we were fine with tap.  When specials are listed, servers often don't mention the price but we would have appreciated a heads up that our order was nearly double the price of the average entrée on the menu.  Lastly, we interpreted "all set" meant that they could take our payment.  It is courtesy in the industry to always bring back change even if the customer doesn't ask for it explicitly.  We were shocked that she assumed we were leaving a 30%+ tip, especially when we only ordered two items and didn't ask for anything extraordinary.During all the meals we felt uncomfortable and uneasy to ask for anything.  We eat and get out as fast as possible.  While the food is excellent, don't think we'll be back any time soon.
2017-04-10,5,This is our date night go to place! We always sit at the bar because we love Denise the bartender. She is amazing. Not only is the service awesome the food is also to die for. My favorite dishes: mussels (medium) in red sauce for appetizer and the Sunday Sauce entree is amazing. Love this place. Best Italian restaurant in the area.
2017-02-25,5,From Manhattan, travel for work and super picky. I hate small portions and mass produced rushed food. Never been to Hoboken, wanted to go home and my fiancé convinced me to check this place out... literally exceeded all my expectations and now I want to move to Hoboken.  We sat at the bar - highly recommend if just you or a small party. Our bartender and waitress were amazing. Christina is hysterical. Phenomenal and friendly atmosphere - if you're looking for that real laid back Italian friendly family feel - this is it. Appetizer - we got the fried calamari, extra spicey. Amazing- perfectly seasoned and not overdone.Bruschetta - fresh ingredients, perfect amount of olive oil.  My main I got seafood marinara - sauce was excellent. Seafood extremely fresh - shrimp had a great crunch. Served over pasta. Should deff if you love seafood - I'm picky about my seafood but this was great. My fiancé got the chicken Parmesan - a must get. Perfectly fried, cheese was excellent. Over either spaghetti or linguine - great sauce.Could eat the bread for hours. They have quality olive oil - recommend asking for dipping .Solid price - cash only. Will absolutely be going back again.
2017-02-16,5,I ordered steak and my date ordered porkchops. I loved every second of it.  I doubt I will ever forget going.  The staff was funny and attentive.  Way to go!!! I will be back!!!!!
2017-01-30,5,Ok so there's a selfish side of me that doesn't want to review this place because it's already hard enough getting reservations!! But here goes...this place is hands down the best Italian food in Jersey!! But it's not just the food you go for - it's the entire experience. You'll want to return because you'll want to be best friends with your server. It has the feel of a small hometown restaurant the kind where everybody knows your name. The ambiance is classic with just the right amount of charm. Despite my comment about it being hard to get a reservation they have the system there down to a science. As soon as one table was finishing the next reservation was arriving. They do all of this WITHOUT rushing you out the door. Ok now to the food....it is nothing short of amazing. Try the meatballs, have the chicken parmigiana. You will not be disappointed.
2017-01-24,4,really bad service. waitress's were on the phone the entire time and extremely pushy and irritated. food was AMAZING though!
2017-01-06,5,Quintessential Hoboken Italian. Cash only, need a reservation (or arrive at 530 when they open for a bar seat), and service has personality. Chicken parm is the best anywhere (and you can get it gluten free with GF bread crumbs and pasta)!
2016-12-20,5,What more is there to say!!!!!!! Perfection at its best. Staff is also great. Fried shrimp in a delicious gravy with a touch of spice pork chops off the chain. Pasta to die for,what more can I say.
2016-11-26,5,Just awesome.  From sitting at the bar having a drink or eating a large meal in the dining room.  This place is worth it.  The food has never let me down.  And in a very competitive Italian Food marketplace, this says a lot.  The manager, who is always at her perch at the corner of the bar, is very direct but very nice to all who come in.  The food is delicious and you always feel warm and cosy here.  Great holiday dinner place.
2016-11-19,5,We stopped in tonight hoping to get a seat at the bar and lucked out. This place is a gem and tables are booked out months in advance for a reason. We were served by the bartender Denise who made us feel like we were part of the family. I spent the entire dinner thinking I was in someone's house. That's how cozy the atmosphere is here. Christine was like my mom running around making sure everyone was having a good time and well fed. We ordered the Sunday sauce special and broccoli rabe and sausage dish and they were both amazing. I was already asking for a reservation before our meal was finished.This place is a must if you are in the area and are looking for top notch Italian food. Make sure to call and try and get a reservation in advance unless you don't mind sitting at the bar.
2016-10-18,4,As our favorite Italian Margarita was closed on Mondays, we decided to give Augustinos as try. Really glad we did! Nice atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable waiter (she has worked there 10+ years) and great red wine choices. We all had meat options (pork chop or lamb) and finished off with good cannolis and a sambuca. We will be back.
2016-09-21,5,there's so much good to be said about augustinos!  I feel so silly for not coming sooner.  The restaurant as others have mentioned is tiny - there's only enough space for a few small tables, so it feels very intimate.  The staff really seem to know their customers and there seems to be a ton of regular patrons that come time and time again.  It's really crazy how the wine list is so large for such a small place - but I get that Italians love their wine.   We were lucky to get a reservation on a Friday night and we really enjoyed our experience.  The server somehow knew we were going to share everything, so she halved the meals and brought them out on separate plates for us --- such impeccable service!  We ordered a chicken francese and a linguine in clam sauce.   The francese sauce was perfectly lemony - the chicken was nicely crispy and it came over pasta.  The vongole (clam) sauce had so many clams in it (they were already de-shelled) and there was no sign of them being tough or chewy!  I hate when my clams are overcooked.   We also indulged in 2 different desserts - a lemon cheesecake - pieces of lemon rind baked right in there; and a crème brulee.  We left so happy and satisfied.  And yes, cash only - but for a place like this, you get over that quickly.
2016-09-15,5,Amazing Italian food!Man, Hoboken has A LOT of Italian food and I thought there is no way this is the best.  This place is SPECIAL.  It was sooooo good!  We got the Chicken francaise.  It was very good.  The lemon flavors were so strong and flavorful.  It was just awesome.  My wife got Shrimp marinara.  It is just such a good restaurant.  If you want the best Italian in Hoboken, here it is!You need to make reservations the week before.  They are always packed because it is a very small space.  The servers are awesome and very friendly!  Cash only as well.
2016-08-26,2,Good food means nothing if you don't feel welcome. The woman who answers the phone is SO RUDE. I called to make a reservation and she said "I got 530 but you gotta be out at 7". Like is it necessary for you to tell me when to leave? I was a little late to my reservation and two people called me to tell me if I was still coming...and if I knew I had to be out at 7. Wth??
2016-08-15,5,Absolutely amazing ma and pop gem. If you're in Hoboken, you need to eat here -- places like this are incredibly hard to come by, especially in the crowded NYC dining scene. Make sure you have a reservation, and bring an appetite!
2016-08-11,5,They're family and the best. Anything but 5 stars is, as Kramer says, kooky talk...
2016-07-30,1,Avoid this overpriced, horrible food and the worse service restaurant at all costs. They give you attitude when you ask for more bread after I spend over $100.00. The food make me vomit all night!!!! Do yourself a favor and don't ever go to this cash only horrible restaurant. I had to give them one star because of Yelp, but really is negative five stars. Avoid this place at all costs!!!!!
2016-07-23,4,It can be difficult to make a reservation because it is a nice restaurant, but once over that Augustino's is one of the nicest restaurants. I really enjoy the food although at times the service might be slow due to busy waiters. But above all the food is what counts.
2016-07-22,3,Hmm... Now this review is tricky bc if you compare it to the italian food in hoboken its one of the best... BUT.... If you compare it to the italian food in manhattan/bk this doesnt stack up. Its not bad but after hearing all about the food here i thought it fell flat. Everything was very salty and just not up to par with what i expected. Prob the best in hoboken so if you are looking for your italian fix come here. But if you want better go to bk or manhattan.
2016-07-14,5,Amazing, authentic Italian food.  Very small but cozy atmosphere, highly recommend, must make a reservation.
2016-06-13,4,I won't flat out saaaaay this place is what Hispanics refer to as "mafioso" (pretty easy cognate), but it's pretty obvious based on the crowd, servers and ambiance. That being said, there is no denying this Augustino's is a Hoboken staple and a great place to get some "sauce" . Friendly and flirtatious waitresses wasted NO time getting to know us and call us by our first names, which may come off as a bit aggressive but they were just too nice. By the time our appetizer had come around, I felt like I had known our waitress for years. Complimentary bruschetta right when we sat down so no complaints here. Got a bottle of wine and Mussels (white) to start, both delicious. When I was between a couple entrees, the waitress strongly recommended I go with the veal parm to "get what this place was all about." Great suggestion because the veal was tender, smothered in cheese and drenched in sauce... so good. The perfectly cooked pasta was nestled underneath catching all the juices from the veal and sauce... again, so good. My boyfriend had the veal piccata and practically licked his plate clean so I think he at least somewhat enjoyed his choice. Have to make reservations well in advance (1 month + possibly more, especially for a weekend), for the prime time dinner slots 6-8pm. Cash only so come well endowed. It's pretty small, there are only like (4) 4-top tables, 1 round table that could seat 6, and a couple 2-tops so I wouldn't suggest it for a large crowd unless its a weekday. There are also openings at the bar, which seats 4-6, so if you don't have a reservation and want to take a gamble on that you might get lucky. Overall, great experience that I cannot wait to repeat and would highly recommend it.
2016-05-20,5,Hands down best food and service I've ever had! The owner is such a sweetie! Definitely coming back!
2016-05-04,5,Augustino's is one of the better Italian places on this side of the hudson river. Just a forewarning that this place is cash only so if you plan on eating here be sure to make a pit stop the the ATM. We came here on a weeknight to avoid the crowds and trouble of securing a table, but even on a calm Wednesday night this place was bustling. We ended up sitting at the bar which is first come first serve. The bartender was attentive and got us menu's right away while he explained the special for the day. I ended up ordering the chicken parm which is as basic as it gets but it came at the recommendation of the bartender. The portion size is huge could have easily filled up two people and still had leftovers for the next day. The sauce was delicious and the chicken and mozz were cooked just right. The chicken cutlets are served over penne pasta with some red sauce. This place does take reservations via phone but if you want to try your luck at the bar best to go on a weekday! Overall this place is fantastic if you want a true Hoboken dining experience.
2016-04-30,5,Legit! Superb food, drinks, and service all around. Finishing the double pork chop will take time and commitment. That plate must be close to 5 pounds!
2016-04-29,5,This place is the RAOs of NJ.  Perfectly done classics.  Any of the parms are amazing.  Their tomato sauce fresh and balanced.  I would stick with the standards.  I had fish special and it was good but didn't compare to my daughters chicken parm!
2016-04-11,1,I've only written one Yelp review in my entire life, so if I'm reactivated this thing just to give a restaurant as few stars as I possibly can, then you should really strongly reconsider going to this restaurant. Came here for my dad and little brother's birthdays and we were all treated like garbage the entire time by the haggish staff. Didn't even get to eat here because I refuse to support such nasty human beings, but as I walked out i checked out other people's dishes. Looked and smelled like chef boyardee, and this is coming from an actual Italian. Don't waste your time and energy supporting these people. We went around the corner to Baja and had an amazing time with amazing food.
2016-04-11,1,AVOID THIS PLACE BY ALL MEANS.If I could give this place a 0, I would. The service and staff here are the rudest people I have ever met. I had a really bad experience here, and you should definitely read my review before considering this place. I made a reservation for a birthday celebration for a few family members from out of town. We showed up on time at 8:30, but our table was not ready. We were told to wait at the bar, which is a really tight space and where the waiters walk in and out with hot dishes, and scream at you (in an aggressive manner)  to move out of the way whenever they walk by.  By about 9:00, our reservation wasn't ready so we politely asked the bar tender when we'd be seated. We finally got seated by 9:10 and the owner of the restaurant came over to speak with us. She was extremely rude to us and told us that it was offensive to ask the bartender about our reservation and that we stressed her out and that we can't act this way in her restaurant. After some more rude words from her, our party of 7 decided to stand up and leave the restaurant. The owner came running after us and proceeded to tell us to "go f*ck ourselves" and called my father-in-law the c-word. This was all uncalled for, as we simply were trying to celebrate a family birthday, and the only thing we did was ask when our table would be ready! I am embarrassed that this place can stay open.  DO NOT go here. No restaurant should stay open while they can treat customers this way.
2016-04-11,1,If you love making reservations months ahead of time to pay absurd amounts of cash for overhyped, mediocre Italian food served by jerks, then you and Augustino's were made for each other.
2016-04-10,5,I went last night for a late dinner and this will honestly be my new spot in Hoboken. The food was amazing and the service and staff were incredible. I felt like I was in a loving Italian home. The calamari was so delicate and perfect. The pasta was amazing that I couldn't even savor it all and needed to wrap it up for leftovers. I highly recommend this place.
2016-04-01,4,I will just go ahead and get the negative aspects of this place out of the way first. Best of luck getting into the place, as reservations are a little hard to come by. Secondly, it's not a BYO establishment, and they will take you on a financial ride for a bottle of wine. Lastly, its cash only  no ATM on premises.With that done, let's get to what matters. THE PLACE IS GREAT. I was honestly happy with the whole experience there. The restaurant is fairly small, perhaps 10 tables, and wasn't particularly loud. The whole meal, appetizers through desert were all great, and i certainly felt that they didn't skimp on portions. The hostess, waitress and bartender I dealt with were all wonderful. Just a small warning to those who don't love spicy food, the sauces that come with the fried calamari, anything besides mild, is pretty spicy, but seriously great.I would certainly recommend this place, if you can find $180 dollars in cash, someone who can tolerate you for a dinner date and your names on a list to get a seat.
2016-03-23,5,Was here for the first time last night as I heard so many great things about it.  The food was amazing.  It was hard to decide what to order as every dish that came out of the kitchen looked great.  The smell of the food in the restaurant will make your drool.  The staff and Christine made you feel like you have been there a million times.  They couldn't be any friendlier.  We had the pork chops with hot peppers, which is as good as people say.  The portions are huge and the size of the chop is huge, yet very tender inside.  We also had the "Sunday Gravy" which was out of this world, which included a large meatball, sausage, bracciole and ribs.  Haven't had it that good since my grandparents.  I could go on and on.This is my first visit and definitely not my last!!!
2016-03-18,5,I can't point out one entree because I love them all equally. I've been a loyal customer for over a decade. Thanks for always making my stomach satisfied, augies!
2016-03-18,5,You really get your money's worth here! My boyfriend and I made reservations on Wednesday, we made it for that night for 8:30 (the only time available). We went in and was seated at the bar to wait until a table opened up. Mind you, this place is very small but very old school and quaint! We soon got seated, our server went over several specials, and was served warm bread. We were told our orders would take 30 minutes, and our server served us a couple bruschetta pieces (like a light app) so that was a nice surprise! We ordered a pork chops for $35 or so - this is a serving for 4 for sure and the price point you can't beat! We also ordered a seafood special that was $45, both meals comes with a side of pasta!? We'll definitely be coming back. One of the best mom and pops around.
2016-03-16,5,I came to Augustino's on a Wednesday night for a late dinner. Please note that you have to call to make reservations!!!! It can be difficult to get reservations BUT IT IS WORTH IT! Also, it is NOT BYOB and they ONLY takes CASH. That being said, Augustino's is a small and quaint restaurant with a very intimate atmosphere. When we got to the restaurant the hostess(she is also a server) verified our reservation and then indicated that our seat will be available in a couple minutes. Since our table was not ready we sat at the bar in the back. The bartender was extremely nice and offered us some recommendations. After a table opened up we sat down and ordered our meal. I ordered the hot pepper pork chops ($35). The waitress said that it will take about 30-40 minutes to come out, which was ok with me. As our dishes came out, i quickly noticed the SIZE of the two(2) pork chops for my dish. I could barely finish one pork chop. Also the pork chop came with a small order of pasta and red sauce. Please note it is spicy. I have to say that the pork chops were ONE OF THE BEST I EVER HAD! The Food IS AMAZING HERE! Throughout my meal the both waitresses (only two were working that night) kept checking on me and making sure I didn't need anything. I do not know why there are some negative reviews regarding the staff. Everyone was extremely welcoming at Augustino's. I would highly recommend Augustino's to anyone looking for AMAZING FOOD! I would rate Augustino's as follows: Food is 5 Stars, Atmosphere is 4.5 Stars, Price is 4.5 Stars and Service is 5 Stars.  The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-03-16,5,It lives up to the hype!  Nothing more to say.  Reservations may be tough but this is due the limited amount of tables.  One of the best Italian restaurants on either side of the Hudson.
2016-03-04,5,My family and I came here on a Thursday night for my birthday dinner.  I couldn't be happier and FULLER!  This place is the epitome of down home Jersey Italian cooking.  We walked in and were greeted with hugs and kisses and took a seat at the bar.  Lenny, I believe the bartender, was amazing.  Perfect martini, perfect manhattan, and a pleasure to sit and chat with.  The place is small but it doesn't feel like it.  Its the perfect amount of cozy and romantic while still feeling like you are part of a family.  I have been in restaurants with 10 or less tables only to feel stifled, claustrophobic, and eating on top of other people.  This isn't remotely the case here.  After cocktails we sat ourselves, keeping with the family vibe, and Danielle was nothing but awesome as our waitress.  My father can be a handful to deal with and she threw it right back at him to my mother's delight hahaha.  We started with the clams casino and calamari.  The clams were smokey and delicious and the calamari melted in your mouth.  The medium marinara sauce was actually spicy! We followed with the enormous breaded pork chops with vinegar peppers, shrimp parm, chicken parm, and the farfalle pasta dish.  Needless to say, our table was silent for a good 20 minutes as we devoured our food.  Everything tasted exactly how my mom cooks in the absolute best way possible, where we all had smiles on our faces from the familiar flavors.  The sauces were robust and fresh, the breading was crunchy and just thick enough, and the pork chops were juicy and cooked to perfection.  I had no doubt that there was no wrong choice to be made on their menu.  After our meal we left to more hugs and kisses and a promise that we will be back for more!
2016-02-16,5,After living in Hoboken for 3.5 years, I was so so so so SO excited to have our Valentine's Day dinner here, and I most certainly wasn't disappointed.All of the reviews were right - as soon as you walk into this place, you're a part of the family. We were greeted with hugs and seated right away. The service overall throughout the night was a little on the slow side, but I think that's a part of their charm. They take their time with every table, but they also let each table enjoy their food and company. You will not feel like you're rushed here.We began our meal with the most delicious bite of bruschetta I've ever tried. The bread was crunchy but still moist and it was just overall amazing. We shared the clams casino and the fried calamari for apps. The clams casino were unique and delicious - each clam was topped with finely minced tomatoes and a piece of pancetta. The calamari were cooked perfectly and the marinara had just the right amount of heat (we ordered spicy).For our entree, we shared the fettucini carbonara and the pork chops with hot peppers. The carbonara was creamy and so so yummy. The pork chops were the best I had ever had. They're actually still actively blowing my mind - the portions are gargantuan. The pork chops are 2-3 chops thick, but somehow manage to be perfectly tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. I don't know how they manage to do it, but I'm glad they've figured it out.We ended our meal with the icebox cake, which I found just okay. Not a huge fan of pudding, but I figured I'd try it based on the Yelp recommendations.I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Augustino's - also, saw a couple people picking up takeout while I was there. I will definitely be taking advantage of this in the coming weeks. Also, I found the prices to be more reasonable than I had initially thought. There are bottled wines starting at $30, and it would be very easy to be able to have a 2/3 course meal for 2, including drinks, for under $150.
2016-01-30,5,A true Hoboken gem! Authentic Italian food. Staff creates a welcoming and fun environment. No place else like it. Consistently amazing food. Must try the stuffed artichoke appetizer, penne alla vodka and fish francaise. Love Chrissy and Sharon, they are so much fun and make you feel like family.
2016-01-19,5,What can we say... just perfect for a quint 5 star classic italian food experience. Staff is charming, friendly and jersey through and through. Sit at the bar to get the full treatment. Christine and sister are great. Decor is always changing which is a treat. Yes very tough to get reservations and yes it's now a Hoboken Hotspot bringing in the "new" hobokennites" overall in the top 5 spots to eat in Hoboken.
2015-12-16,5,It took me ten years to make it here mostly because I was sick of calling and never getting a reservation on a Friday or Saturday (I'm rarely in town during the week).  So on a random Wednesday night at 8pm, we decided to take the walk over and give it a go.  Luckily, we arrived and there was an opportunity to sit at the bar after a 20 minute wait or so.  I assumed that we would be deemed a nuisance hanging around the small bar area given that this is a place that is always full and doesn't really need us in their way, but it couldn't be further from the truth - we were welcomed with open arms, served cocktails and taken care of for the next two hours better than anyplace we'd been in a long time.You've read it all before - it's tiny, it's busy, the all-female staff is feisty and very, um, New Jersey.  But would you want it any other way?   The food and atmosphere together make it an exceptional establishment.  The place is the real life "Cheers" because everyone really does know your name - they ask you who you are and then introduce you to others around you.  Some are new, some have been coming in weekly for a decade.The menu can be daunting due to the number of items and the different combinations.  My main tip is that your eyes are always bigger than your stomach here.   For instance, we went with a portion of pasta, split into two, followed by pork chops with peppers and chicken picatta.  This resulted in me having one gigantic pork chop leftover for lunch the next day, along with some of the sides.   The poor man next to men went with mussels followed by chicken parm and didn't even make a dent in the massive hubcap of a chicken cutlet.We did go for the icebox cake to finish up and it was out of this world.  Don't skip it.Now I finally understand why this is a Hoboken staple.
2015-12-11,5,Out of all the cuisines in the world, I wouldn't say that Italian food is my favorite. Which is why I don't mean it lightly when I say this was one of the best dining experiences of my life. I brought my girlfriend here last week because we were staying at the W Hoboken. Yes, the restaurant is small, crowded and it can take a little time to get to your table. Definitely make a reservation but even still, expect to wait a little bit. Don't worry, have the wonderful Denise fix you a deliciously strong Negroni while you wait. We ordered the specials: Pasta Special (spicy sausage bolognese) and the Rack of Lamb Lollipops. Best lamb I've ever had - I wanted to bathe in that sauce. But most importantly you can tell that this restaurant is more than a business, it's a family and a community. They have a lot of regulars, but they treat everyone (it was our first time) with love and a sense of familiarity. It's this love and respect for tradition and family that makes this food taste so damn good. Don't know when the next time I'll be in Jersey, but can't wait to go back to Augustino's.
2015-12-10,4,Really enjoyed this small restaurant in Hoboken.  It is very tiny so be prepared, but the food is like home cooking. One of the best chicken parms I ever had, and I could only finish half!  If you can get in, enjoy your time!
2015-12-07,4,How can you go wrong with very flavorful Italian American food!!! The portions here are ginormous and they make the best chicken parm I have ever had, it is not to be missed! Other great options are the shrimp very tasty! The service is not the most pleasant however and be prepared to wait: make your reservation a month in advance and still expect to wait even with a reservation.
2015-11-29,4,Rule of thumb - follow what the yelpers recommended.  1) Make reservation beforehand.  If you plan to walk-in, the bar is first come first serve and when we were there, the bar spots were taken up pretty quickly.  2) For appetizer, we got "eggplant stuffed with prosciutto, peppers, and fontina cheese" which is recommended by the waitress.  This is the holy grail of greatness!  My date who does not like eggplant devoured half of the dish!  The eggplant was grilled became tender, almost potato-like. Along with the prosciutto, roast peppers, and fontina cheese - it really came together! 3) For dinner:   - We ordered pork chops with hot peppers (of course).  Describing this dish as huge portion is an understatement - this is monstrous!  Essentially you are getting 4 pork chops in 2 pieces.  The waitress split the porkchop into two plates so my date and I can have our own plate which is super nice of her.  It was perfectly done and it was so flavorful.  I am very curious to know how they cook it because the porkchop is so thick.   - We also ordered Ravioli.  The marinara sauce is amazing!  I wish I can drink an entire bowl of that sauce!  4) For dessert, we ordered the Italian cheesecake.  We were so disappointed at the dessert.  I am not sure what Italian cheesecake was supposed to taste like but... I am pretty sure it should not taste stale.  I should have known to not order dessert as no one recommended dessert here... 5) This is NOT BYOB. I was amazed that the bottle wines are very reasonably priced.  A bottle of Riesling was $20.  6) BRING CASH!  Credit Cards, children, etc.. will not be accepted as a form of payment. This is definitely my favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken now.
2015-11-06,4,Still love this place but thought they have been off lately. Sent a dish back for the first time ever. Again, I love the staff and the food and the atmosphere but I just haven't been as wowed lately. I'll be back though.
2015-11-05,5,My favorite place on the planet!  Mussels w/ white wine + bread and butter are to die for.Breaded pork chops with vinegar peppersShrimp ParmIce box cake.Cash is king!
2015-10-18,3,Had a great time at Augustino's! The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. We started with the arugula salad special and fried calamari. Both were delicious, as was the bread and bruschetta they provided to start. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm, which was out of this world, and I went with the country chicken. Country chicken was great too. Chicken (on the bone) and sausage with a mix of sweet, tangy and spicy peppers/ mushrooms in a vinegar sauce. It had a hot sauce like feel but tasted amazing. My only complaint was that the appetizers were a little over priced ($14 for each) but our meals were delicious and we both took half home.
2015-09-21,5,Wow! Amazing!  We loved every minute. First I must say that we were invited by regulars for a Saturday night dinner at Augustino's.  We arrived on time and were greeted the owner Sharon. From that moment on, we were family.We started with drinks and their famous bruschetta. Unfortunately, you only got one piece. Every bite was delicious.Next, we had appetizers:  the pasta carbonara was absolutely fabulous. We also got the mozzarella salad which was very good. Nothing was left on our plates.For entrees, my bf ordered the sunday pasta special. There was so much food that he had another meal to take home. He enjoyed every bite. I had the chicken marsala with a side of pasta with red sauce. It was a beautifully pounded thin piece of chicken with a delicious marsala sauce. I devoured the pasta and red sauce which was excellent. I had enough chicken leftover again for an additional meal. Our friends had a chicken dish and the shrimp scampi. unlike us, they were used to the portion size and devoured everything. To complement the meal, the crusty Italian bread was very good.To finish the evening, we all split an icebox cake. It was delicious.Overall, we had an amazing meal with great friends, fantastic service, and an experience that was second to none.  We can't wait to be invited back to augustino's with our friends.
2015-09-16,5,LOVE this place!! It's intimate, friendly & the food is insanely delicious!! Every time I go, I'm impressed! (which is hard to do). Love Sharon & service is always good! Make sure you make a reservation though! Otherwise, you're cheek to cheek at the small bar. The Sunday special is amazing!!
2015-09-12,5,We had a lovely experience dining at Augustinos tonight. Denise and Christine made us feel right at home. The food and service were top notch. It was worth the wait to experience this beautiful restaurant and staff.
2015-08-29,5,Best dining experience in New Jersey. Augustino's isn't in the restaurant business, they are feeding FAMILY.  And if you are lucky enough, you get to be in the family for a couple of hours. From the moment you enter you are greeted by Christine a warm and friendly aunt who makes you feel at home, but will also not hesitate to bust your chops to keep you in line -- and you want her to! Laughs and great banter abound. Same for Denise at the bar -- a total rockstar -- who hasn't met a stranger in her life. Where else can you say "I feel like comfort food" and get recommendations based on YOUR preference for "Sunday gravy or cream sauce?"Complimentary bruschetta and warm bread appear out of nowhere. Water and wineglasses are magically refilled without you noticing. Just like a big Italian family you want for nothing.  We dined on a busy Saturday night at the bar, but were well looked after. As soon as you sit down you can feel yourself immediately relax because you are being doted on for the rest of the meal. You want for nothing except to return again soon. And of course the food is delicious...you savor every morsel -- but save room for the icebox cake!Christine & Denise thank you for taking such good care of us!!  We'll be back.Suzanne and Amy
2015-08-26,1,Drove 2 hours from Philadelphia for a Saturday night reservation at 5:30 after they called to confirm our reservation on Thursday.  We get there and the manager says "I messed up, I don't have a table for you." Half the restaurant was empty, and when we suggested she seat us in one of the empty tables, she curtly replied she had other reservations at 6pm. "I'm sorry there's nothing I can do for you." Not surprised this happened when they take reservations by first name...  By pen and paper...  Crumpled up in her pocket (I'm not making this up, she literally had small, beat-up notepad that she took out of her front right pocket)...  News Flash: buy a POS system!  Your kitchen can receive orders by servers! You can track sales and inventory! It will help with your organizational skills!  It will also offer your customers the option of using credit cards to pay for their food - like every other restaurant in the world - instead of your tax-dodging 'cash only' policy. But most importantly, you'll be able to make reservations (and keep them) for all of your guests, including those who just drove two hours for nothing.
2015-08-25,4,Came in on a Wednesday night not expecting to be able to get seated but was welcomed to dine at the bar. Really old school Italian atmosphere so if you're looking for a high end experience this is not it. Had the Sunday gravy special which consisted of rigatoni marinara and then a plate FULL of meatballs, short rib and sausage. Was all around a great experience. Just remember to bring cash.
2015-08-04,5,Wonderful in a old school good way!!!A classic !! The staff food and service is amazing you feel welcomed and at home the moment you walk in!!  A gem A plus from beginning to end!!
2015-08-04,1,The worst restaurant in Hoboken. Tried to visit a few years back but never again! Booked a table for 9pm for my husband's birthday. Arrived on time. Table not ready. Told to wait at the bar - except the bar is surrounded by seated people (this place is tiny). So scrunched up by the coat rack. No-one takes our order. Can't get a drink. By 9.30 we're fed up and our table still isn't ready. We leave. Later the owner of the restaurant calls us up screaming because we've walked out. This place is a joke - have NO idea why people seem to like it so much. Amandas just down the road is 100 times friendlier and does great food.
2015-07-20,5,Chicken parm melts in your melt... Everything here is amazing also a great place to see celebrities
2015-07-19,5,This place is just straight up scrumptious! Awesomely fun waitstaff adds to the greatness.
2015-07-10,5,Best Italian food I have eaten in many years. Service like you do not find these days. The owner takes a lot of pride on her restaurant. If you have cash and a reservation, you are up for great eats in Hoboken NY
2015-07-07,5,Best kept secret in Hoboken. The food is delicious and as authentic as the service. I truly feel like I'm at my Italian aunt's house; I love it. If the place was bigger and I could get reservations a little easier I'd go more often. It's cash only but look past it. And yes they will ask you to finish your drink at the bar ONLY if you've already paid, had plenty of time to leave and are hogging the table. Give me a break people. What do you expect them to do when you're hogging one of their 8 tables? You're being rude, not them.
2015-06-19,4,Great traditional Italian food and great service.  Worth the higher price point.  I had the country chicken which is an awesome take on scarpriello.  The serving size was massive.  Everything was delicious. I highly recommend.
2015-05-25,4,This place is definitely an experience - a good one!Even all of the Yelp reviews couldn't prepare me for the "Jersey" service experience. The waitresses are a riot. One of them, as she was telling us the specials, said that the pasta special was well worth ordering because it is "f-ing" delicious. And the other one, kept clicking her fake nails on the table each time she picked up something from the table. But despite these strange "habits" we actually felt that we got really great service. We were never in need of anything, the waitresses came by plenty of times to rearrange our plates for the next course, and when we left, they even thanked us by name (we had made a reservations). Yes, I know some people would have a problem with that type of service, but honestly, just roll with it and have a good time. Oh and order the specials. They really were ... delicious! :)Cash only.
2015-05-06,5,Amazing, tiny, intimate, Italian restaurant.  Hard to get a reservation, but worth it
2015-05-03,4,Best Italian in Hoboken. Cash only. Making reservations is always a pain. If you're dining with just another person, go to the bar and see if you can eat there. I would say there are comparable Italian places in NYC that don't give you as much of a hassle, but this place has consistently been fantastic and comforting.
2015-04-28,5,Love Augustino's!This place is like walking into your mothers house after college break and all you are looking for is some love and food to soothe your soul.Cash bar, so be prepared for that, and there is signs in the front and ATM's near.This place is glorious and best Italian food in Hoboken by far. They make you feel like family they way they interact with you. If you are stuffy, and pretentious and looking for a place where they don't bust your chops and rub your back while making you laugh then this place isnt for you.Going with the Specials is never a bad move. Always something creative and delicious on the menu. As far as the staple.. get the PorkChop.. Eat one and take the other one home for tomorrow. ITS THAT BIG...Can't wait to come back and give hugs and kisses to everyone!-Steve
2015-04-18,1,You gotta be kidding me! 1st off, they do no take credit cards. Luckily we had just enough cash to pay as the sign was so small on front door. In other words, they are tax dodgers to start. 2nd, beyond overpriced. 3rd, food below average. 4th waitresses annoyingly flirty. Do I want bread?? Yes! For the fifth time!So 2 pathetic plates $20.99 each. 2 glasses of house wine, plus.. oh wait.. TAX!! The balls to charge tax when you are dodging. $67.00!! Dominos would have been better.Just saw that all the good reviews were from 1 to 7 years ago. I will report them to IRS for that debacle of a meal.
2015-04-13,5,Came here for my partner's birthday dinner, we were able to get reservations for a Thursday night no problem earlier in the week. We both had daily specials that were excellent, as was the wine suggested by our server.
2015-04-03,5,Food is really good the only thing if you don't have it booked you can't get in lucky thing we have it booked every month for the year
2015-03-29,5,I finally understand why it's so hard to get a reservation! The food is excellent and the restaurant is tiny. Tables are packed close together which I normally don't like, but in this case I liked seeing what everyone around me was eating! My friend and I shared two appetizers. The scallops were in a butter and brandy sauce. Enough said. The fried calamari was tasty and not at all greasy. My entree was the linguini and clams. The portion was very generous and delicious! The table next to us was celebrating a birthday and had two desserts. We asked them what they recommended and they told us to get the ice box cake. It was perfect!  I enjoyed the whole meal so much I forgot to take pictures!
2015-03-28,5,Very friendly restaurant. I had salad special which is very tasty. Pork chop for the entree. Definitely worth it. We couldn't finish the dish. 10/10 recommend you guys to try here. Christina and Denise are very nice.
2015-03-24,4,I'll start by saying that this isn't your ordinary dining experience. If you don't enjoy fast-talking Italian-Americans, this spot ain't for you. It's pretty tight and you will hear a lot of conversations of other tables and vice versa.That said, I love this place. Make a later reservation if you want to sit for a long time, because these waitresses try to turn tables due to the low seating volume. They are hilarious, though. It's as much a show as it is a dining experience.Ask questions. Joke around with them. Don't expect special treatment or act remotely snobby, because they'll make your night miserable, and personally, I find that to be hilarious. Long story short, they do what they want and MOST of their clientele are regulars and love em for it.The food is solid. Not fine-dining quality, but good. I got lamb chops and it came with 8 in an order. They were cooked perfectly med-rare as I asked.Look, this place isn't for everyone. If you expect to be waited on hand and foot or treated like royalty, it ain't gonna happen here. Like I said, it's a unique experience and it takes a unique customer to enjoy/maximize it.
2015-03-22,5,Traditional Italian, very good, amazingly friendly staff, great food! Make a reservation well in advance because it's hard to get a table...for good reason.
2015-03-21,4,Been here a few times over the years and have not been disappointed yet.  Solid traditional Italian cooking, with friendly, fun atmosphere.  It's a little small and tough to get into, so If you can't get a regular table reservation, try sitting at the bar.  Lenny will take good care of you.
2015-03-20,1,Haha this place is laughably ridiculous.My friends went in for a 6:30 reservation, but their Uber was 15 mins late. Instead of graciously dealing with the situation, the hostess seated them and, after having served their wine, told them that they "couldn't order bone-in meat or fish or anything taking longer that 20 mins to cook" due to the time it would take out of their "1.5 hour reservation time". Understandably, my friends at the table started to question the waiter's decision, and they asked what they would do if they wanted to "order another bottle of wine and prolong their dinner", even had they arrived on time. The waiter told them they couldn't take time out of the next reservation, essentially saying that everyone is limited to 1.5 hours for dinner!After discussing it, the waiter got fed up, took their wine, and asked them to leave! The owner said, "I don't care, this is how I do it!" Talk about crazy! I've never heard of anything so bizarre. Telling patrons they have a limit on their time at the table? I mean, what?? Ridiculous! What's worse is that they didn't argue with the staff, but they asserted themselves and look what happened! Ridiculous!Boycotting just on principle. Go to Elysian cafe or Fig Tree for a treat!!
2015-03-20,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  It is tough to get a reservation but once you do it is well worth it.  Great staff and even better food.  People love the Pork Chop and it is certainly good and HUGE, but for my money get the Sunday Gravy if it is one of the specials.
2015-03-16,5,semi intimidating when you first walk in...we asked for a seat at the bar and we sat in ~15 minutes after a very friendly bartender (Denise) opened a bottle of wine for us...Once seated, we had the best time, Christina was a fantastic waitress! She made us feel like family.  Denise described everything on the menu with passion, and the flavor of the food reflects the old school pride and care that goes into making it.Im a customer for life!
2015-03-05,5,Hands down best Italian eatery in Hoboken. Started out with the Fried Calamari which melted in your mouth. Then we had the chicken parmigiana and veal francaise, both were delicious. For dessert we had the ice box which was also great along with a bottle of chianti.
2015-02-28,1,My girlfriend and I had a 6:30 reservation.  Unfortunately the cab picked us up late and we ended up arriving to the restaurant at 6:50.  (we called at 6:30 to notify we would be late).  Once seated, we were asked to order a drink and got two glasses of wine.  After the wine came, the waitress told us that since another party was arriving at 8pm, our menu would be limited and no meats or fish would be cooked for us.  (this is about 60-70% of the menu).The place is very small and seating is limited and I understood their concern.  I calmly told the waitress that due to the restrictions, we will finish our wine and come back to eat another time.  (they could have made us aware of this before we ordered our wine)  At this point, the manager came over to our table and loudly told me that I was being unfair and any table for two should be able to finish their meal within 60-90mins.  I responded by saying with all due respect, this time restriction should have brought to my attention when I made the reservation.  The manager then began to make a scene, raising her voice and drawing attention by grabbing our still full glasses of wine and shouting "thats it, you're out!"  I have never been treated so utterly rude by any restaurant in my entire life.  I understand the need to uphold reservations, but the entire situation could've been handled with a lot more courtesy, class and professionalism. I will never go back to this immensely overrated restaurant.
2015-02-28,1,This place is for suckers. Overpriced and overhyped. Food sucks and the staff are assholes.
2015-02-26,5,Amazing!!!! The best Italian food you will ever have in Hoboken! No, ever! Great hospitality and friendly service. The food is amazing as well! Every time we go, we make a reservation for the the next time and decide who is going to come with us. Can't go wrong with this place. Unmatched home cooked quality Italian food.
2015-02-15,5,We went on vday which is also my birthday. The food was excellent. V day is always tough when it comes to specific seating etc but everything was good and we were very satisfied. Food made it for us!
2015-02-15,5,The best traditional american Italian restaurant. MTO. All seafood is excellent. Specials are great. Marinara is perfect. The prices are similar to the higher end Italian places in Hoboken, but the wine is much more reasonable.
2015-02-08,5,This place is awesome! Food is fresh, plentiful and delicious- always!  The waitresses are playful and opinionated once you get to know them! A lot of fun! Love Danielle.  Reservations required always unless you can squeeze in at the bar!
2015-02-06,2,After 7+ years in town, I finally made it to Augustino's, a same-day res for a weeknight at 6:30.  Probably the hardest place to get into in Hoboken, but if this place wasn't SO small and therefore SO hard to get a table, there would be nothing remarkable about it.  Except of course, for the staff, which was entertainingly "Jersey."  Until dessert was on the table and they told my girlfriend "I love ya...but you gotta get outta here.  I need the table." That's my #1 takeaway from the entire disappointing experience.As for the comfort Italian food, it was pretty good, though not especially memorable.  Broccoli rabe appetizer had burnt garlic that added bitterness, veal Marsala was tasty, lobster fra diablo had lots of seafood but the flavor was a bit one-dimensional (red pepper flake).  We had a pretty good bottle of Cab for $40 which was actually a good deal.  I don't remember the dessert (something chocolate?) or coffee all that well, other than being rushed through it.  For $180 for an early weeknight dinner for 2, I expected something to stand out.  Rather than food - ranging from fair to pretty good, but overpriced- or ambiance - kitchy, dated - it was the service.  It was amazing to see how quickly the schtick can go from endearing to insulting, and how quickly we went from making future reservations to swearing "never again."
2015-01-30,5,This place is great. Small Italian restaurant in the heart of Washington street. Reservation is required to sit at a table which is always booked solid. There are a few stools by the bar which ones without a reservation can eat if the seat is empty. We ordered the calamari salad which was amazing. Big cuts of squid freshly fried. We shared the chicken parm which melts in your mouth and the pasta with garlic oil and sausage. Both entrees were great and the portions are huge. Recommend this place to anyone craving authentic Italian food
2015-01-24,5,Hands down.. the BEST service we have ever received in Hoboken. There is a sign in the room that says "Enter as Strangers, Leave as Friends" and that is truly how we feel. The recommendations were on point and every item we ate was delicious. Fried calamari melts in your mouth. Chicken parm was delicious, cheesy, and very fulfilling. Chicken francese was perfect with a lemon zest and silky smooth pasta. We ordered a cannoli and got an added birthday candle/wish. We can't believe it took us two years to go to this restaurant and we can't wait to go back. A romantic, quaint, family feel and one of the best Hoboken has to offer.
2015-01-21,5,Delish... Hard to get in so make your reservations only.. We ate at the bar - chick parm is yummy... Reasonably priced and very fresh and homemade... Cant wait to come back and chat with the bartender.. The staff is very friendly and make you feel at home!
2015-01-03,2,I'd been trying to get a reservation for months. Showed up on time but still waited about 30 min.  Staff was friendly, nice cozy atmosphere but the food was average. Got the lobster far diavolo and could not taste the lobster, it was drenched in marinara.  My friend got the chicken parm, nothing special.  I don't know why people rave about this place.  It's probably always booked because it's so small and seemed like certain tables were regulars.
2014-12-08,4,Can't go wrong with a meal from Augustino's from time to time. Granted it can be expensive for Hoboken, but you will always get a high quality meal.I recommend the mussels in a red sauce to start, although the white wine and garlic broth looked pretty solid as well.This visit we had the halibut oreganata and the veal chop with sweet & hot peppers. The fish was cooked perfectly, light and flaky and I simply wanted to soak up the sauce with every piece of bread I could find. The veal chop was fit for a cave man and had incredible flavor.For dessert, it is a no brainer...icebox cake every time. And from what I hear, the French Vanilla cappuccino is the best around.**Bring Cash, if you don't already know**
2014-12-06,1,I am very insulted- just was kicked out of Augustino's - brought my mother there who is visiting from Florida- we were enjoying a good Italian meal at the bar- no tables available- finished our dinner - and we were just drinking the rest of our wine when we were asked to leave!! i can not believe that any restaurant would ask their patron to leave because they want to give the sits at the bar to other people - its not like we were hanging out at the the bar wasting time drinking water - i will never go back - as a matter of principle - the food is good but not worth my dignity - what happened to the days when restaurant owners appreciated and valued their customers??? And I paid with cold hard cash!!!! all they accept!!!
2014-12-01,5,Great food, atmosphere and service. Chicken parm is some of the best in town. Cash only and you should probably get a reservation, but if you know what to expect you'll have a great time!
2014-11-26,1,Wont be going back! We loved Augostinos and go there as a treat several times a year. We went on Thanksgiving Eve to celebrate a rather stressful year and when we went to pay the bill (cash only) we gave $100 and only received change for $80. It was an extremely disappointing experience- having us blamed for losing the money after double checking our remaining cash against our ATM receipt. Beyond that it was mortifying bc it's such a small restaurant- everyone was listening in.  However- the worse part was there was no apology from management, we still gave an additional $20 for gratuity bc we didn't want our server to be penalized for the bartenders mistake. Afterwards it left such a bad taste in our mouth, I had to call back to explain our disappointment and the management was defensive and accusatory. It's a shame bc it's always been a special place to us and now I have no desire to ever return or refer it again. I'm sure our review on Yelp won't have any impact on business, but word of mouth in this town moves quickly and for the $20 mistake it cost them it would have been better for them to just pay that small difference. For some reason I have a hard tim believing a cash only restaurant only had 4 20s in the register.
2014-11-19,3,3 stars because they only accept cash and it is 2014. The food however is excellent I went with the Chicken Parmesean and WOW! possibly the best I've ever had. I am just not a fan of the restaurant only having 7 tables and the fact you must make a reservation very far in advance. I was lucky to walk in on a Tuesday night and get a table for only a hour. But again this place is for a sentimental date. So gentleman plan in advance
2014-11-09,4,First note you come here for the atmosphere and the service. Don't get me wrong the food is good but it's really the owner, staff and the ambiance that will keep you coming back. The owners will make you feel like you've known them forever which is extremely unique. The space is tiny but is just large enough to accommodate a lot of laughter and just the right amount of customers. The menu is extensive and has a bit of everything you could want. They are helpful with food allergy questions and gave great suggestions for each of us when choosing our meals and wine selections. Call early getting a reservation can be difficult (we were on a waiting list for two weeks before getting a call that we got a table). Augustino's is really the perfect place for a family dinner. It has all the feelings and tastes of home. And bring cash***
2014-11-05,2,Was very much looking forward to my dinner reservation at Augustino's (after a month wait). Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere of the place, but when it came to the hyped-up food, I was beyond disappointed. First, my husband and I started with the complimentary bruschetta... so far so good. Then we ordered the shrimp and pepper appetizer, which was 3 pieces of shrimp and a ton of peppers in a sea of oil. It didn't have any flavor nor any spice to it (even though our server said it was). For our meals, I had the Lemon Chicken on the bone with a side a pasta, and my husband ordered the Chicken Parm. The chicken parm was average... nothing to write home about, but when our server put my Lemon Chicken in front of me, it was a plate of chicken wings! I was absolutely shocked as I thought this would at least be a boned chicken breast or something similar. I couldn't believe they would even bring this out to me. What type of "nice", authentic Italian restaurant thinks this is acceptable as an entree? And to boot, the pasta was overcooked. The best part of the dinner was the icebox cake... amazing. All in all, this place is way overrated and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2014-10-29,3,I have been here about 5 times and every time I have enjoyed the cosy atmosphere but always felt that the food was overpriced and average at best.  In a place like Hoboken that is filled with Italian restaurants, I expect higher quality for that price.  It's overrated.
2014-10-23,1,Where do I begin...I rarely write reviews unless it is extremely good or extremely disappointing.The food was good, not great.  I have definitely had better in the city and at Leo's Grandevous if you want to stay in Hoboken.  Leo's has less of a fuss and the people are SOOOO much nicer.  The decor was cute and quaint, like the other reviews mentioned.One of the ladies working there, I believe the hostess, was so rude I almost lost it, but since it was a special occasion I held it together.  They took forever to serve the main course and once we paid the check the hostess tells us to wrap it up and finish my drink at the bar because she needs our table.  Are you kidding me lady?!?  That is not my problem.  It ruined our night - truly ruined.  I'll never go back, especially since it was $100 per person and they treat people rudely.  I am appalled and disgusted that that lady has a job because in addition to being rude to us I heard her cursing back and forth throughout the night.  Disgusting.  Honestly, go to Leo's if you want italian in Hoboken.  My family and I have been going to Leo's for years, but thought we would give Augustino's a try.  Never again.I hope the owner reads this and realizes the hostess needs to go!!!
2014-10-20,5,My new favorite Hoboken restaurant.  Cozy old school Italian.  Menu is simple and amazing.  Had the chicken parm which was outstanding.  Hard to get a table, but we sat at the bar and still had a great time.  Can't wait to go back.
2014-09-10,1,Limited menu, not so special specials.  Overpriced for what it is and what they serve.  I ordered their veal Marsala, no taste.  I opt for veggies vs pasta so what did they serve me, a boiled potato with 7 under cooked skinny string beans.  At their price point a salad could have come with the meal.Lastly, our server was great but the usual hostess is so f'in arrogant.For $100 meal I stick to our regular great NYC places.  Want to see where my wife and dine, check out my check in and review notes.
2014-08-21,4,Shady rolled into the Hoboken (no jokin'!) version of Rao's to see for himself whats the deal. Shady and crew started with a double order of the meatballs(2 per order) and a fig/blue chesse/drizzled in honey special app. Meatballs were tasty,not grotesquely huge like some other places,  sauce was excellent, just like Shady's momma used to make. Main courses were a delicious chicken parm-cheesy, tender and gooood, a rigitoni special with veal bolognese which Shady wil lhave to revisit for sure, linguini with clams-spot on-and a veal marsala. All were cooked well, service was attentive and the lovely ladies of Augies-Madeline and Francine,  were , well, lovely. Dinner for 4 with 2 bottles of Pinot Grigio were 230$ plus Shadys ALWAYS generous tip. Now that Shady is "in", he will revisit to work through the menu, specifiaclly the chops and the pastas. It may not have Nicky the Vest like Rao's , but Lenny is a fine substitute and for some good old home school Italian, this place is a lock.
2014-08-18,2,Dinner there Saturday night and had to eat at the bar due to the amount of reservations. Kept hearing about this restaurant but had never been. If you are looking for old school cooking than this is the place for you. Disappointed in the quality of the food.
2014-08-15,5,Had a FABULOUS date night with my husband, we felt like part of the family. Really great food and AWESOME people
2014-08-11,4,We called, on a random Tuesday night, and were able to secure a reservation (not an easy task). So we headed over and had a nice meal. Quick note: they are CASH ONLY.Decor: This place is small, but I would classify it as quaint. It is very intimate, with only about 8 tables, and has a genuinely homey feel. The look and feel is more of an old-school (really nice) pub with a bit of Italian flair.Bathroom: I did not use the bathroom during our visit.Staff: Our waitress was very friendly and pretty quick taking, and delivering, our orders. When we first sat down there was about 5mins of zero activity, but things picked up from there. She was also pretty helpful with menu questions and suggestions. Bonus: they leave a carafe of water on your table! Love it.Food/Drink: The menu is a bit small, but has all the staples on it. They also have specials that all sounded great. To start, we had the Stuffed Artichoke (which was ok, but I wouldn't get it again) and bread (delicious!). For meals we had the Chicken Parm (very tasty) and the Halibut, which was on special (perfectly prepared).Value: The prices don't seem too unreasonable but the total bill will add up quickly. While I believe we got what we paid for I feel as though their reputation somewhat precedes them and they have priced the menu accordingly.We definitely enjoyed the meal that we had but agreed that it wouldn't be a usual stop for us. The atmosphere is nice but the food could be a bit better. It is certainly the best Italian in Hoboken but not the BEST I've ever tasted.
2014-08-10,3,It was August and since many people were on vacation, we managed to get a walk in seat at the bar on a Saturday night.  Apparently it is difficult to get reservations at this place and many people either have standing reservations or they make their reservations weeks in advance.  The ambiance was less "polite and professional" and more informal meaning, I felt like I was at a family dinner party.  It was a warm, casual and a friendly place.  There are definitely many regulars and I saw the staff constantly coming over to greet them with hugs and kisses.  In a world so focused on excellence and being "polite" in the most "clinical" way Augustino's felt human instead of "just another dining experience".My fiancé and I dine out regularly and the food here is good but not outstanding.  I thought the calamari was a little chewy but my fiancé loved his veal parmesan and he said it was a 4 out of 5 stars.  For me, the ambiance is what would keep me coming back again and again and when you go here often, it seems that the staff really goes above and beyond for you.THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!
2014-07-31,5,Best place in Hoboken. Great atmosphere, the food is awesome, and the family/friend run staff makes it always an entertaining affair. I'm addicted to the Veal Piccata but everything else on the menu is at the same level. We recently had their spicy sausage appetizer and it was unreal. Good luck getting a reservation but I prefer pushing my luck and getting a spot at the bar anyway. It has actually ruined Italian food for me because now I compare anything I eat to this place and nothing compares.
2014-07-28,5,It is hard to get a reservation here for a reason. I had the Country Chicken and my date had the Veal Piccata. We shared the fried Calamari as an appetizer. The Veal was great, but nothing to write home about. The Calamari was amazing. Crispy and flavorful as opposed to over fried and greasy. The Country Chicken was astounding. I have never had anything like it. The hostesses were a bit brash, as others have noted. Although, like others have mentioned, you don't go to a place like this to make friendly conversation with staff, you go for the culinary experience and to enjoy time with your guests- and that I did. Lenny the bartender provided great service and enjoyable commentary throughout the meal... I will definitely be going back.
2014-07-21,1,After friends have talked this place up, we decided to patiently wait for a long awaited reservation and try Augustino's.  Upon arrival, my husband and I were pushed into a line along the bar along with others waiting to be seated, I think I've had more personal space crammed into the 4/5 train during rush hour. The woman assigning guests to tables was extremely rude, barely cracked a smile. From what other reviewers have been saying defending the service, I can only assume that the waitresses must deem you worthy enough to be kind to you. The food looked like someone vomited on a plate as it came out of the kitchen - I can't say that presentation is their strength. The food itself tasted edible if you closed your eyes. I would say it was slightly above average home cooked Italian food, I think I could do the same in my kitchen with good ingredients. If you want amazing food in Hoboken, try Cucharamama, where the food looks and tastes amazing and the chef had won the James Beard award for Outstanding Chef Mid-Atlantic, she is incredible and you will be treated well.
2014-06-28,5,First time to this place and it was delicious! We made a reservation only 3 hours before and only waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. Of course our reservation was at 9:30 pm. The food definitely lived up to all the reviews. We started with the calamari and I got the shrimp francese and my friend got frutti di mare. We about licked our plates clean!
2014-06-11,4,4.5 stars. This restaurant is one of my favorites in Hoboken. The only negative is that it's tiny and very hard to get a table but the food is delicious and the service is great. I love the one waitress, Sharon. She is extremely friendly (even gives hugs and massages throughout the dinner) and she gave us some great recommendations. Last night we had the shrimp special, eggplant rollatini, and scallops appetizers and then we split the breaded porkchop with vinegar and hot peppers. Everything was ridiculously good. The sauce on the eggplant was amazing. I keep dreaming about it. The scallops were cooked perfectly. Chef Gordon Ramsey would have been proud. The pork chop was excellent too. The size of that entree was out of control big. We split it, both had it for lunch today, and still have not even put a dent in it. I can't wait to go back, like every day.
2014-05-26,4,Went for the first time after making reservation 5 months ago, and absolutely loved it. Had to say when we first walked in, the look on the face of the elderly hostess was very much like, can I help you, as if we shouldn't have been there. The elderly bar tender was also not particularly welcoming. The wine was served in a chianti glass!  However, once seated, the waitresses were excellent and the good delicious. We had the mussels and lamb chops. We would definitely go back.
2014-05-04,5,I've been to this place a number of times and generally sit at the bar if we're lucky enough to stumble in and find a seat. It's a different vibe than having a reservation and sitting at a table, but it's always enjoyable to banter with the staff. All the staff does a great job making you feel welcome and they treat you like you're part of the family.For Food!!The clams, calamari, and stuffed artichoke are always spot on for apps.For the entrees, the chicken parm is the best in NJ and was always my go-to until someone at the bar one night suggested the shrimp parm instead.  I tried it and it was literally a foodgasm. Gigantic shrimp perfectly fried, plenty of mozzarella and the sauce!  Truly exceptional. I have no desire to try any other dish.For Dessert, the ice box cake was simple yet perfect.Can't wait to come back soon.
2014-04-19,5,Excellent experience. Probably the best calamari I've ever had...prepare to walk out stuffed! Great to spoil yourself one night!
2014-03-29,3,I have been to augustinos twice in the past two years and I will say that the negative reviews for this place are spot on. If you aren't a regular they don't care about you. We had to wait twenty minutes past our reservation time to be seated, and another ten to even get menus or water. The service was okay, not overly friendly or warm. My boyfriend loved the calamari, I thought it was okay. We both loved the carbonara and then we split shrimp scampi as well. I've definitely had better shrimp for way less elsewhere. I like the atmosphere and it wasn't that expensive ($80 with a bottle of white wine). Overall, this place is OKAY. Wouldn't go rushing back, MIGHT suggest it to someone, would probably return for date night again in the future.
2014-03-26,5,Love this place!  My family has a standing reservation (A lot of families do, that may be why it is hard to get a reservation) here once a month and I look forward to it very much.  Service:I see a lot of reviews here on how they have bad service, I disagree.  If you grew up in an Italian household you would realize they treat you like family.  We are always greeted with loud hellos and big hugs.Food:We usually order a different range f apps for the table.  A must try are the mussels in red sauce (make sure you order extra bread for dipping) and we also enjoy the whole lobster app. We usually order a few apps from the specials as well. My favorite dish here is the Chicken Rollatini, unless they run out that is what I order.  It is always so tasty.  I think I ordered from the menu once as I usually go with one of the specials! Shrimp Scampi is really good.The drinks are good, if you don't like the way they made it they will remake it to your specifications.Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
2014-03-16,4,What a nice hole in the wall. It's like stepping back in time or into a Godfather movie set. I really enjoyed their whole "attitude, dropping f bombs and fuggetboutit" spiel. We loved it. Why not?! Our friends have a monthly standing table and we enjoyed going with them and can see the whole attraction to going back. Food is solid, old southern Italian dishes perfectly cooked.  Worth a return visit.
2014-02-04,5,I've been trying to make plans to come here for six years now. Can't lie, the idea of making reservations weeks in advance was a bit of a deterrent. I took a chance for a birthday celebration and called at 6 today, they had a spot available! We even found a parking spot in the front-I should play the lottery after tonight! Everything was absolutely delicious. The sauce, which in my opinion is the tell tale sign of a good, great or horrible Italian restaurant was fantastic. Everything was fresh, and the service was spot on. The interior is very quaint and well decorated. Laughs full the room and wine bottles pass from left to right. I am so happy we got to come here tonight and hopefully next time will have some room for a cannoli!
2014-01-20,5,Had a wonderful meal with genuinely warm wait staff taking care of us.  With no reservation midweek, we were able to sit at the bar after a short wait.  Diane at the bar and Christine as our hostess/waitress were great! The lobster cocktail, veal chop, and broccoli rabe were excellent.  They make you feel at home and cater to all your needs.  Excellent experience!
2013-12-18,5,Been dying to try this place for years and finally got a chance with some work friends and I can't believe I waited this long -- what I've been missing.  Ambiance and service is excellent but you clearly come here for the food.  All the appetizers and pastas are great but you really don't have to even look at the menu for the entree.  The double portion extra think cut pork chop with the hot Italian peppers is all you need.  Amazingly prepared to perfection.  Took 1 home (because you really can't eat both at 1 sitting) and I think it lasted about 10 mins from the time it got in the door.
2013-11-17,4,Cash Only, solid food, difficult to get a res - do you really need more info as to why you need to come here? Rundown on the food: - Exceptional Mussels in a red sauce w/ a kick (it's rare to have really good mussels in a red sauce since every restaurant offers mussels nowadays) - Haven't had Shrimp Scampi in years and glad I came back to it here. Excellent - Farfalle Cecchini - Bow Ties w/Spinach, Prosciutto, Garlic & Oil - Good, but I would recommend a half order or making this part of a community food option.
2013-11-08,5,While driving to Hoboken last week I yelped restaurants and found the great reviews of Augustino's.  I called for a reservation that Friday evening but - no surprise -they were booked.  The woman said we could try to sit at the bar.  We decided to take a chance, showed up at around 7, and there were 2 empty bar stools.  We considered ourselves very lucky as the place was buzzy and the food was incredible.  Best calamari I've ever had - big and juicy.  I also had the Veal Marsala and my husband had pasta with shrimp and mussels.  All wonderful.  And everyone was very nice - I totally did not see any attitude that was mentioned in other reviews.  This is a place I would go to regularly if I lived in Hoboken, I will tell my friends about, and I will hope to return at some point.
2013-11-01,5,Patience, perseverance, parking karma and cold hard cash (only) will get you a fabulous dinner at Augustino's!  We braved the Halloween revelers and the infamous Hoboken traffic just to try a little piece of heaven(ly) rustic bread bruschetta.  This tiny little treasure will sweep you off your feet, should you be lucky enough to score one of their coveted 15 or so tables.  Almost immediately, you will discover this is a family owned and operated business.  Everybody cares.... the server, the wait staff, the bartender all share the common denominator of making sure you feel at home.  The service is attentive yet invisible and unobtrusive.  We had the lobster appetizer which was a whole lobster, chilled, cleaned and separated and very easy to handle...  My Boyfriend had the Rib-Eye Pizzaiola which was very juicy and flavorful.  I had the Rack of Lamb which was excellent and could not of been prepared better but with that said.....it was. nothing compared to his Steak Pizzaiola.  The side of linguine was the real treat.  The sauce tasted as though he picked the tomatoes in the morning and served it that evening.  It was perfectly balanced without a trace of another element to tame the acid in the fresh tomatoes. Absolutely flawless.  My only recommendation would be that they should consider serving butter in a ramekin or butter dish as opposed to the gold-foil pat of butter.All and all, it was a great presentation of classic, properly prepared Italian specialties without adopting an American interpretation, which often happens in other restaurants.  Remember to bring cash, and lots of it....  because as you know, a home cooked Italian dinner is not inexpensive but certainly worth every penny.
2013-10-26,5,Cash only and the absolute need for advance reservations can be annoying, but it's totally worth the hassle here.The staff immediately makes you feel like you're part of the family.  The food is outstanding. What more could you possibly ask for?
2013-08-23,5,Awesome food. Straight cash
2013-08-09,4,Great ambience and generous portions.  Get reservations ahead of time and don't forget your cash!!
2013-08-09,5,First time at Augustino's last night. Food: Amazing ! (I've lived in Italy and the food  totally exceded expectations)Service:  Perfect , Professional & Polite Atmosphere: just right... from the low lighting to the decor to the super clean bathrooms.  A restaurant with a winning formula, who ever runs this place is a genius.Can't wait to go back !
2013-06-23,4,A rounded up 4 star (ie, 3.5-4).  Great, friendly service. Waitresses have lots of personality which is always fun.   Food very good and reasonably priced.  I don't go here often enough.
2013-06-19,5,Incredibly impressed with this little "hole in the wall". When you walk in, you're immediately punched in the face by the most amazing aroma. The ambiance is perfect and you can almost hear Billy Joel singing "Scenes From an Italian Restaurant". Our server (I wish I remembered her name but I drank a lot of wine) was lovely and the specials were delectable. My wife and I didn't eat dessert, since we had cake at home, but I wish we would have had another entree. Not because the first one wasn't large enough, portions were great, simply because I didn't want to leave!! DELICIOUS!!!
2013-06-11,5,I have been going to Augustinos for many years. I have also traveled the world and eaten at many great restaurants. I still come back here after all of these years. It is hard to imagine the few mediocre reviews here. The quality and taste of their food is almost second to none. You can't come here counting your pennies as dinner with all of the trimmings and tip is in the $65 range. Major great dishes........lemon chicken, country chicken, all the parms, pork chops, shrimp in brandy sauce, fried shrimp. Do yourself a favor and try it.
2013-05-01,5,This place is delicious and utterly entertaining. The food is amazing and everything was cooked perfectly. The staff is a riot, it's like eating at your italian relatives house. The waitresses are so friendly and hilarious.
2013-02-16,4,This place is all about the specials.  Rest of menu is good, but definitely get one of the specials. I was the only one out of the 4 of us that didn't and I ooogled everyone's else dishes throughout the meal.  I had the salmon which was good, but the veal special with brushetta and mozz topping was excellent!!Do not be discouraged if you don't get a reservation the first time you call. Go on the waiting list - you will be called back!
2013-02-02,4,Sure it's small,"basic fare", "clubby" with neighborhood regulars and cash-only - so what's the problem!?  Had a nice meal on a snowy Friday night  - was able to get a table for 3 early (630pm) - never was rushed along or bothered by the waitstaff.  Get over yourself - buy-in to the scene and come and enjoy a nice old-school (big) bowl of pasta and a glass of wine!
2013-01-25,4,Just went there for my first time. Very charming place where you can feel the fabric of Hoboken. I've been a regular at many of "these types" of places like Raos', Bamonte's Il Mulino etc. This place is right up there with the best of them. Staff is great and are a group of characters. Food was amazing. I already made my next reservation but it's 31/2 mos down the line. Cant wait!
2013-01-23,5,Best italian food in hoboken by far...My gf and I got reservations our first time and then decided to do take-out the 2nd time.  One of the waitresses welcomed us in as we opened the door, waved us over to the bar with a big smile on her face -- she couldn't have been nicer.  You people are nuts.  No clue why this is "old school", maybe because the waitresses aren't bubble headed 18 year old girls?  The inside looks like an upscale italian restaurant so i'm completely lost on this "old school" thing, even if it isn't considered a negative I still don't see it.Only negative is that its a tight squeeze, if you're claustrophobic you may want to pass I suppose (or just do take out!)Should be doing our 3rd time within the next couple of weeks and I cant wait!
2013-01-19,1,Very overrated place.  The menu is nothing special its like ordering from a pizzeria.  The staff treats you like they are doing you a favor and your mediocre meal arrives in about 15 minutes.  Place was full of regulars who talk to other regulars and annoy you because they are standing up next to your table.  Don't do it to yourself....
2013-01-13,3,My passion for food/dining out and living in Hoboken is a great combo. Been to Augustino's once and decided to give it another shot. Wasn't in any rush so called up to make a reservation and was able to get a table a week later on a Thursday night-perfect. Table for 2 wasn't as cramped as I last remembered. Complimentary bruschetta was decent. Service very old school Italian. If you weren't a  "regular" you definitely were not a priority. However that being said service was still good. Started with a glass of the house red blend. Smooth. Bread. (as you will learn if you start reading my reviews is very important to me). Warm and fresh. Soft/dense on inside but crispy on outside. Delicious. Apps. Caesar salad. Basic. No croutons (I just feel the need when I'm at Italian restaurant)My boyfriend got the special rice balls. Very good. Main. The classic chicken Parm with pasta. Thin chicken which I like. Sauce was good. Nothing to rave about but very tasty. Dessert (I was stuffed bc had entire loaf of bread myself) but I never say no. Icebox cake. Very good and different compared to desserts you normally see on Italian menu. Chocolate pudding with layers of Graham crackers. No desire to run back but overall experience was good.
2012-12-11,4,Oh man.  That was good...Getting reservations at this place was like getting hazed while pledging a fraternity, but it was worth it.  We asked for a reservation for 2 at 8pm on a Wednesday, but they were all booked.  Crazy, right?  Well, the good people at Augustino's gave me a call that Wednesday afternoon to let me know that they had a cancellation and offered me the aforementioned reservation.  Needless to say, I snapped it up.The food was excellent.  Everything came out hot and fresh.  There are very few Italian spots that make it just like my mom/grandma, but Augustino's got it done.  Chicken parm was excellent and their pasta with shrimp special was great.  The service was very good and our server was cool/friendly.  Only downside: my calimari was just a little too tough for my liking.  However, I will be back as often as possible.Lastly, I see a lot of reviewers on Yelp!  complaining about the staff at Augustino's being "rude".  Lighten...up.  That's the problem with our generation.  We are super entitled and we expect people to roll out the red carpet for us wherever we go.  Guess what?  That's not gonna happen.  You know why the owner at Augustino's didn't care that you couldn't get your reservation?  She doesn't need you or your attitude.  Augustino's was in Hoboken before all us 20-30 year olds came to town, and they will be here well after we have babies and leave.  Why?  Because their Italian fare is the best in New Jersey.I dunno; I don't need to be best friends with the people at a restaurant I like.  I just go, have fun with my guests, enjoy my meal, pay the bill and carry on with my life.  I suggest everyone does the same.
2012-12-03,4,One of better dining experiences I've had in Hoboken, food is great, service even better...felt like home after one visit...mind you I come from a quite sarcastic family..so the witty staff worked for me...can't wait to go back. Eggplant rollatini, fresh pastas, and ooohhh that icebox cake....all delish.
2012-10-27,2,If your idea of dining out is surrounding yourself with extras from the Jersey Shore and Italians still living in the 80's this is the place for you .. food is slightly above average, took over 30 minutes to get food once ordered and I simply do not see justification for the hype this place receives .. the bartender was nice but there are probably 10 better places to eat in boken without the cheesy pretension and month long wait for a reservation
2012-10-24,4,Great food. What more do you need? The specials are always fantastic and everything is perfectly cooked. Never had a problem with service here and have been treated like family each and every time.If you don't go during prime dining hours, you should have no problem getting a table. Every time I have visited around 9 pm I have been seated immediately. At the very least,  bar seats are typically available. If you're a chicken parm lover, my boyfriend says it's the best in NJ.
2012-10-07,4,This place nailed it for me. I had an amazing Italian experience here. I haven't found any better in Hoboken to date, so the prospects are looking pretty good for this little place.It's small and pretty basic. Be certain to place your reservations well in advance (I've heard it can get a little retarded to place one). It's not BYOB. Make sure your wallet is loaded... with cash - it's cash only.The food is superb. I'm a pasta man. I haven't heard complaints about anything else my partners have stuck to getting here.
2012-09-27,5,I went here a while back and the food was superb.  A friend and I walked in on a random Thursday without a reservation, somehow got a table and it was delicious.  I had a lamb dish which was excellent.  I would strongly recommend to friends.  Only downside that I've heard is that it can be difficult to get a reservation.
2012-09-27,4,I can't believe we lived in Hoboken for 5 years before trying this place! Won't wait another 5 before we come back that's for sure. This place is small, simple, old school and VERY Jersey Italian. Very similar to Leo's in downtown Hobo but just a touch more elegant. We were afraid it was going to be all hype but the food was great. We had, and i would order exactly the same again, the scungili salad, broccoli rabe, rigatoni with Sunday sauce (basically a separate plate of 4 different delicious meats), and a veal Milanese. Followed by an amazing cannoli. Make sure you make a reservation (packed even at closing time on a random weekday) and bring cash. Mangia!!
2012-09-13,2,Reasons to avoid Augustino's:#1 - Owners & staff are extremely arrogant.  They will make you feel like they are doing you a favor by even letting you eat there.  Unfortunately this place is a dime-a-dozen.  Between Hoboken & NYC there are plenty of better options.  #2 - Cash only.  So annoying.  We live in an age when you can charge a credit card thru an iPhone at a street fair.  Don't tell me you cant take credit cards.  Stop being shady and pay your income taxes!#3 - Horrible bar.  Their mixed drinks are disgusting, and the wine list is a big let down.#4 - The place is the size of a shoebox, and the bathroom is filthy.  For all the cash this place rakes in you'd think they could spring for a renovation...or at least a bottle of disinfectant.  #5 - They will rush you out after you are done eating because they need the table.  (there are only about 8 tables in the whole place)#6 - The prices are inflated, because the restaurant is so over-hyped.  Much like the famous "cake boss" bakery Carlo's...people will pretty much flock like sheep because of all the hype.  Neither place is worth the wait or the price.  #7 - The menu is basic, predictable, and boring.  It's basically any menu you have ever seen in any mediocre "Italian" restaurant.  I think they might have actually photocopied an Olive Garden menu and passed it off as their own. Listen to an actual Italian, and don't be a sucker.
2012-09-02,1,Had a really bad experience there a couple of years ago. Food may be good, but I wouldn't eat in a restaurant where the owner insults you. A lot of people may think that it is funny but the owner (a woman) treats you like she is doing YOU a favor for eating at her place. I still believe that people should be polite and considerate, I would never go back there. There are millions of other places where I can eat a good Italian food.
2012-08-24,4,This place is a classic among not so classics. It's obvious to me that they don't try too hard to be good, which I think makes for a better experience. My fiance knew I've been wanting to try this place forever, so she made reservations for my birthday. She said she had no problem getting one for a Friday night. In fact, when we were there we saw empty tables. This place is small and intimate though, probably 10 tables or so a few 2 tops, some 4 tops and a small bar.  It's old school inside. As someone stated this is out of the 80s, well I wouldn't say that. I'd say the food is classic Italian with no fit and flare. It's good, classic and like I said, doesn't try hard. The place is cash only, which is why only 4 stars, I know it's the way it's always been but it's time to move into the 21st century. But if you plan accordingly you're fine. The prices aren't outrageous and the wine is very fairly priced.  The waitresses are great, friendly and no BS and joke with you, it was like sitting down at a family dinner, they create a great atmosphere.Now onto the food, we got a couple apps, one was a veal special, it was kind of like a burrito but with delicious veal inside it was awesome. Then we got the fontina cheese app, which was a lot like an Italian grilled cheese, also delicious, simple, but delicious! I had the bone-in veal chop special, it was so good. It fell off the bone and was beautifully seasoned. was it the best veal chop I've ever had? No. But it was still excellent. My fiance got some seafood and she loved it, ate most all of it. I cleaned my plate. Like I said, this food was excellent without having to try, they do a wonderful job of putting the emphasis on flavor which is good. For dessert we got the ice box cake, which was good but not spectacular. I wish I would have gone for something a different, but not complaining it just didn't measure up to the other two courses. I loved it here, some of the best classic Italian food I've had in a long time. It's a home cooked environment with a fine dining touch. It's a great intimate atmosphere and worth checking out, just hit the ATM before you do.
2012-07-30,5,Delicious food. Chicken parm, eggplant appetizer, cheese appetizer are all a wonderful. Reservations are recommended as they are small and it fills up quick with locals. Small bar area seating available. Can't wait to go back here!!!
2012-05-26,4,This is the type of restaurant that has been in business for so long and has so many regular customer that it probably laughs at every bad yelp review on here and says "Oh, these yuppies."Some useful information: 1) cash only 2) full bar (no byo) 3) no matter how far in advance you call, the hostess will always say that there are no openings and asks if you would you like to be added to waiting list.  {Translation: if no family/ friends want to dine that night we'll give you a call}.  If you don't want to abide by these rules, I recommend stopping by to see if they have room at the bar.I came in expecting pretty awful service given some of the other reviews on here and was pleasantly surprised.  In particular the bartender is very down to earth.  Now onto the food.  Best veal francaise I have ever tasted!  So tender and sooooo flavorful!  I was glad I ordered it with pasta, which I ended up soaking in the rich lemony sauce!  Next time I am skipping on dessert though.Most importantly:  after eating here, I feel like I have checked off a major item on my Hoboken bucket list.
2012-05-17,5,Tremendous Italian food, perfect for a fancy night out.First off, Augustino's is NOT BYOB and you can only pay in cash.  Plan ahead. I had the orichette with broccoli rabe and it was out of this world.  This was easily the best sausage I've ever had in an Italian dinner.  The olive oil sauce was perfect and I finished every last drop.  I'm torn between ordering it again or discovering what else on the menu is as delicious.For dessert we split a cannoli, but honestly I was so enamored with the pasta that I barely remember how it tasted.You're going to pay a pretty penny for dinner here but it is absolutely worth it.
2012-03-13,5,The place to go if you're in the mood for italian food! Superb service; they had a calamari on white wine sauce special appetizer that was just spectacular! Great farfalle pasta, stuffed rack of veal and chocken parm. Even though we were full, we had to try their icebox cake...I'm a dessert fanatic,and I have to acknowledge that this icebox cake was one of the best desserts I've had! All this plus an incredibly friendly service, whatmore can ou ask for! Looking forward to our nextmeal at Augustino's!
2012-03-10,4,Bring your cash and lay it down at this Hoboken institution.  We had an enjoyable time and ate some tasty dishes.
2012-03-07,2,I don't understand what the big deal is about this place.  It was a pain to make a reservation, and the person on the phone was not helpful at all and made me keep guessing until I finally guessed a date when they had an open table.  When we got there most of the tables were empty for the first 30 minutes or so.  We got an appetizer, two entrees, and a bottle of wine.  The food was good but it was no better than anywhere else in town.  When we received the bill we noticed that our appetizer, which was a "special" that night and consisted of only 3 shrimp, was $17.  In the end we spent over $100 for a meal we could have gotten for half the price anywhere else.  We didn't have a bad meal, but we felt like we got ripped off.  For those reasons, in the future we will avoid the hassle and go elsewhere.
2012-03-04,5,Once you get past the BS they put you through when you are making a reservation (they are always booked. Just get on the waiting list. 9 times out of 10they will call you day of and give you the reservation. The waitresses are sassy as well, so be prepared. Just be polite and you will get great service. Now I give them 5 stars because this is the best red sauce Italian food I have ever had. I get chicken parm or shrimp parm almost every time...best I have ever had. But anything i have had (salads, some spinich/chicken dish, drinks) has been great.  The giant pork chop looks great too, just never ordered it because the parm dishes are so good. So please try it for me.
2012-02-22,2,After dealing with the pain of getting a reservation here, we were left majorly disappointed.  After we were seated no one took our orders for 30 mins.  Our water and wine glasses were left empty for a good bit of the meal, so overall our service was lousy.  The food was nothing to write home about.  The rice balls (were a special) were just OK,  the ceasar salad had no parmesan or croutons, just romaine and dressing.  The farfalle and shrimp marinara entrees were not impressive.  The best part of the meal was the bread and complimentary bruschetta.  Save yourself the hassle of getting a reservation,  and paying too much for 70's Italian food.  I would suggest going to one of the other good Italian options in Hoboken.
2012-01-25,4,I ate at Augustino's this past Saturday for the 1st time.  My crew in Hoboken has been telling me about this place for years.  Apparently, it's hard to get a reservation.  I guess I got lucky with the mini snowstorm.  The earliest I could get a table for 4 was 10:00 pm, but that was fine with me.We arrived around 9:45 and had some cocktails at the bar.  The place was old school Jersey Italian style.  Very small, but cozy.  The waitresses were mad aggressive (in a playful way).  They kept talking smack to us as we stood by the bar (in their way) boozing while we waited.The menu is pretty standard classic Italian, with pretty standard prices.  Two of the coolest things that ever happened to me at a restaurant, happened at Augustino's.  One: I asked the waitress for advice on what to order.  She asked what I was between.  I said the pork chops and the farfalle.  She asked if I'd like half & half.  I almost fell off the chair.  Of course I do!I had calamari and eggplant for appetizers.  The were both top notch.  I had the pork chops and the farfalle for entrees.  The farfalle was as good as it gets.  the pork chop was solid, but not memorable.  The wine was good and cheap as well.  I was very full and happy with my meal overall.....Two: when we ordered the icebox cake for dessert.  There were 4 of us, and we were splitting a single piece of cake.  The piece came to our table sliced into 4 equal squares.  That saved me from the delicate process of trying to eat my full share, but not encroach into anybody elses (which I've done more often than not).  The icebox cake was straight up Italian Nona steez.
2012-01-22,4,Wow. Augustino's you rocked my dining world.  Not necessarily with your amazing food, though you do an extremely good job with that.  Not with your outstanding wine list, as your wine list isn't that comprehensive.  You rocked my world with ambiance, service and charm.  I'll go out and say this is a 4.5 star kind of place.  Before I get into the details of this wonderful evening, I will just put it out there for you yelpers why I am rounding down rather than up.  I didn't love my entree.Now, this place is tiny so don't expect to just walk in and get a table.  Our friends did tell us that you can walk in post 9pm on a Friday and get 2 spots at the bar.  (Thanks Portia R for that great tip!). Now waiting for our reservations, my party of 4 was in the way, no doubt about that.  The waitresses were kind, rude, hilarious while getting their job done.  If you don't like a little sass and a few "get the hell out of my ways will ya" then yes you may say the service is not that good.  However, the beautiful servers always have a smile on the their face and are ready to help you feel at home. (Including a few back rubs and hugs).For starters: Calamari with a choice of 3 sauces - sweet, regular or hot.  We went with hot.  It was actually a hot marinara and was it delicious.  An amazing idea if you ask me since I love me some hot sauce and I love me some marinara sauce. The eggplant rollatini was good but what stood out was again that marinara sauce.  Augustino's has some damn good marinara.Entrees - The veal chop special stuffed with prosciutto, fontina, and spinach.  It looked scrumptious but in fact it lacked a certain je ne sais quoi.  Extra flavor?  Salt? I don't know.  Definitely not the best thing on the menu.  My boyfriend echoed my sentiment with his stuffed pork chop.  On a side note, I do need to add that my bf was torn on what to order and the waitress hooked him up with the half order pork chop (though I don't think it was half, it was huge) and a half order of the pasta he was eyeing.   So sweet.  All the pastas I tasted were delicious.  That marinara again... yummm.The side of veggies and potatoes were delicious. The asparagus being perfectly charred and very crispy.  I dare say they were perfect.  The free bruschetta waiting on the table is a great way to start.   The Ice Box cake split into 4, for the 4 people in my party was out of this world delicious and a great way to end this fun evening.Augustino's has standard prices for upscale Italian.  It wasn't the best Italian food I ever had but, by no means was it bad.  It was quite good, very good. But, what really makes this place stand out is it's heart. It's got a whole bunch of that.  I look forward to another evening at Augustino's as I"ll most definitely be back with cash in hand as unfortunately credit cards are no good here.
2012-01-07,5,Great food!  The linguine with clams is spectacular. The mesculan salad has the tastiest dressing ever.  The only disappointment is that we didn't get bread with our take-out order-maybe they forgot. Regardless their food is amazing!
2011-12-25,3,Come here for the experience. As you all know by now it's almost impossible to grab a reservation. But there is enough grabbing once you get to the restaurant. The staff are VERY friendly! Which I did not mind but I can see how others can feel a bit put off by it. The handmade farfelle pasta was really amazing but that is the only good thing I can say about the food. The rest of the fare including their famous veal were just ok. Food not worth the hype but the experience was fun.
2011-09-24,2,i went there saturday night . Me and my friend called for a reservation, the woman that answer the phone was very , very short and said that we could sit at the bar, so we did . Well maybe the reason she was very short was because she had celebrities coming over, so she could care less. We sat at the bar, and ordered our food, but there was such a hype in the place, people being very, very loud, like to get the attention of the celebrities, that i couldn't hear my own thoughts. The pasta we ordered was good, not the best . What bothered me the most was how loud the place was. Will not go out of my way to go there.
2011-09-08,5,Discovered this gem when they opened a few years back (read the review in NJ Monthly Magazine).  THE BEST Italian food around!!  Have eaten here many times and the food is consistently excellent, and the service is consistently impeccable.  You must call in advance and make a reservation; but if you feel lucky; walk over and take a chance to get a seat at the bar; you'll be glad you did.  Go early and you might score a seat or two at the bar.  Cash only and their Sunday Sauce is worth the wait as they only serve it on Thursdays!  Family-owned and operated; and they care about their customers!
2011-09-04,1,SO-SO FOOD, TERRIBLE SERVICE. If your group is over 6 people and the waitress already has her 18% tip in the bag, don't expect even a bit of courtesy. The waitress was very abrasive, impatient and just plain sloppy when taking your order, bringing the meals over and taking the dishes away. She even splattered us with the sauce when taking out plates way. As far as food goes: my whole group ordered different items and it was a unanimous decision that this place was way OVER-HYPED. How this place became popular is beyond me. Definitely not good enough to become a "cash-only" place.  If you have never been here, I don't recommend it at all on a "Hey, let's try it out" basis.  There are many way better places than Augustino's Restaurant.
2011-07-28,4,Apparently, it takes over a year to get a reservation here on a Saturday night in the main dining area (according to the bartender...we were indeed relegated to the bar).  The restaurant and the food is good, old-school Italian-American.  Seems like a place with a lot of regulars, and deservedly so.  A bit pricey for what you get, and yes, cash only.  I recommend the Farfalle.
2011-07-26,4,I've been wanting to dine here for a while but reservation was hard to come by unless you plan to go weeks in advance.  One day I decided to just walk in for early dinner at 5 pm and low and behold there were seats at the bar. Wooh!  The bartender quickly offered recommendations which were delish. I ordered the special lasagna and the spaghetti.  The free bread that sat at the bar tasted stale and immediately I was downheartened.  Maybe my expectations were too high?  Fortunately, the worst part or the meal wad over. The entrees came out delish and overflowing with taste. It also didn't hurt that the portions were hearty,  because sometimes nice restaurants like to give you only a sampling of food. I left full and happy.  Will certainly return the next time I can afford to.
2011-07-26,4,good italian place, reasonable prices. The catch here is to make a reservation early, i would recommend about a week from desired date. This join only accepts cash ( no CREDIT CARDS whatsoever ), but will feel like it is ok after you eat, and will want to come back.Again, i feel that for what you experience in Hoboken concerning italian food, this is def a good pick.
2011-07-01,5,I just wanted to update this review and say that after 4 more visits to this place, I stand by my original review. Excellent food, wonderful waitstaff, and truly the best restaurant in Hoboken. We now come here every month  and we really feel like family. Their specials are always top notch and if there's a veal chop special, get it (although the pork chops are awesome, too). You really can't go wrong with anything that you order here!
2011-06-15,3,The pasta carbonara was incredible but extremely rich!  I couldn't even finish the whole thing despite not being full.  The atmosphere was very intimate and the staff was friendly.  Service was just okay for the price.
2011-06-13,5,No words to express my love for this place! From the small Italian spot with 8 tables boasting Frank Sinatra...to amazing Italian gal staff..to of course the food this place is a MUST go to! Food...get the calamari, the chilled lobster, chicken picata, pasta...and for dessert the ice box. Just make sure you make a reservation prior as it gets booked!
2011-03-24,4,We went here for my birthday on a wednesday night. Made reservations just an hour before for 2 persons at 6.30. It was really great Italian food with great service as well. The two women serving were in tune to each other and we were constantly being hjelped without feeling rushed.We will definetely go back, although the price is a little bit to high to go on a regular bases.
2011-03-18,4,AMAZING food! Must get reservation a couple weeks ahead! Be ready to drop some cash but well worth it!
2011-03-12,4,4.5 Stars.Called Friday and left a message to call me for a Saturday reservation if there were any cancellations.  Fast forward to Saturday at noon, they called me and said that they had a table open for 5:30pm.  They said that we'd have to be out of there by 7pm, no problem.We arrived early but hung out for a while outside.  At around 5:25, they called us in and it was empty.  15 mins later, it was completely full and packed.  They brought out complementary bruchetta and bread.  Both were fresh and tasty.For appetizers, we ordered the fried fontina cheese and crab stuffed shrimp which was a special.  The fried fontina was delicious, and the marinara was even better.  The shrimp and crab was fresh but a little overcooked.  Also, they only came with 3 shrimp.For the entrees, I ordered the bowtie pasta(farfelle) with proscuitto and spinach.  It was great as well, almost a little too much spinach though.  My wife ordered ravoli with melted mozzarella.  I tasted her dish and it was tasty and fulfilling.  Both my in-laws ordered the special short rib with fetticine.  I tried the short rib and it was very tender and tasty.  My mother in law thought that it was great but the pasta was a little undercooked for her taste.For desserts, 2 of us ordered the canoli and the other 2 ordered the ice-box pie which was more of a chocolate mousse-like pie.  Both were good but almost to filling for dessert.Overall, great service(nice accents), nice ambiance, and great food.  Glad we got to experience this place.CASH ONLY!
2011-03-12,5,This was probably the best meal I've had since moving to Hoboken.  I walk into the place around 630pm on a Friday and the only seats available are at the bar.  The hostess (Christine) moved over to make room.  Apparently this is typical as the place gets busy.  Most of the staff was friendly and they even suggest calling the night before so they can plan for your favorite special...how awesome is that.  Only regret was not buying a bottle of wine to pair with my meal.A few quick notes:- They typically have 15 specials outside of their standard menu, every one of them sounded incredible and each dish I saw that came out looked delicious- Portions are generous so you really don't need a full course meal unless you're planning for a food coma- Red Snapper is a no-brainer if you like fish- Fun and friendly atmosphere- Full bar- CASH ONLY- The hostess' favorite cereal is honey nut cheerios...personally, I'd go with captain crunch
2011-02-25,5,If you have a chance to visit this small Italian restaurant, take it. They may not have a table available, but it is always wise to get on the waiting list because something usually opens up. Christine, who takes reservations, is great about calling you when a table is free.The food here is top notch. Try the shrimp and spicy peppers for an appetizer if they're serving it. The peppers are cooked to absolute perfection and the shrimp is delicious and fresh.If you order the pork chop, be prepared to for two 10oz chops full of juicy meat all around the bone. You can get it with peppers or apple sauce and it is phenomenal.The wait staff is friendly, they offer great suggestions, and will make you want to stay all night. You can sit at the bar or at a table and you will get great service either way. And this place is worth every penny. I went twice in 2 weeks and will go again very soon!
2011-01-21,5,Having grown up in NJ and working in Manhatten, I have had more than my fair share of Italian food.  Hands down, this is really one of the best places to enjoy a meal, without being rushed and the staff is amazing!  They treat you like family, and these days you don't get that very often.  I have never had a bad experience.  The specials are AMAZING, the eggplant rollatini stuffed with veal is heavenly.  And the Sunday Sauce??  WOW, I never liked braciole, but somehow, I have become a fan!  The notorious wait list is totally worth the wait!
2011-01-12,4,Really good restaurant - some of the best Italian in Hudson County. Very small inside and very homey (not a recommended date place). The food is very well-prepared straight-forward Italian with some twists (the stuffed chicken dish was terrific). The food is not fancy, and I would dare say not creative, but a very solid restaurant with nice people and good food.
2011-01-07,5,complimentary bruchetta upon arrival, and it only gets better from there! heads up: this is a cash-only establishment, but don't let it deter you from trying to walk in. reservations are certainly suggested since it houses just a few tables (less than a dozen) and a small bar (less than 10 seats), therefore creating a perfectly intimate setting. each dish is appropriately and deliciously portioned, and if you order an appetizer (whether it be a dish or a salad) plus a meal, you will most likely have leftovers. the worst part about this place (the lapse in time between courses) ultimately leads to the best part about this place (the food is made fresh, and your tastebuds will recognize that!). great selection of wine, comfortable atmosphere with soft background music, and the staff is to die for. literally... they will make you laugh all night. moral of the story is: when coming here, make sure you bring cash, your appetite, and a sense of humor. you will not be disappointed! oh, and tell sharon and christine that i say hi :)
2011-01-02,5,It was awhile ago that I came here, but I almost cried the special Veal Chop was so good.  And I never cry, over food ;)  I'll never get a veal chop at another restaurant.  Everything else was outstanding.   Super small, so make reservations well in advance, unless you get lucky and snag a spot at the bar.
2010-12-01,5,The food is delicious and the staff makes you feel like family (I've always wanted to be Italian).  It's nearly impossible to get a reservation, but it's certainly worth the wait.
2010-08-20,4,Not sure why everyone seems to be beating up Augustino's...  The waitstaff was great,  the food was wonderful,  the small intimite atmosphere makes it an excellent place for a date,  huge fan and will definitely go back.
2010-04-25,1,It took me weeks to get a reservation for this place and, boy was I disappointed! I had heard this was the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken... Being born and raised in Italy, I find that couldn't be further away from the truth.  Nothing originally Italian, just a bad caricature of stereotyped Italian-American cuisine. All dishes come cooked in the same soupy sauces, only the main ingredient changes, so you get chicken marsala, veal marsala, beef marsala.. and the like... wouldn't that be an indication already??? No, sorry; not Italian. Not to mention the loud owner's wife, who came to the table and was especially excited to know I was "really" Italian...  I'm really not a prude, but she said "f*@#k" every other word! Not attractive, really! So, yes, if you want cheesy Italian-American cuisine you should go, or maybe opt for the Olive Garden, at least it's easier to get reservations!
2010-04-09,1,Overpriced and the 'over' friendly watiresses are annoying.  All their dishes are swimming in a pound of mozzarella w/ bland sauce. I'm 100% Italian i have 10 Aunts whose cooking blows this place away!!
2010-03-11,2,As I start to write this, I fear the loyal patrons & employees will hunt me down and quietly take me out for this review....What's the Big Deal about this place?  Did we go on a night when the chef's cousin's little 12 yr old brother had to stand in and cook? Living in Hoboken for five years and hearing that this is the best spot in town for your classic southern Italian dishes, I knew I had to try it. After several attempts of trying to get a table (spread over the years), I'd almost given up.  Finally, a random weekday at the early bird time of 5pm, my boyfriend and I managed to walk in and find several tables available for dinner. We ordered lasagna and chicken marsala.  Our two favorite Italian dishes we always order anytime we try a new spot.  All I can say is "Eh".  To say the wait staff is friendly, is an understatement... our waitress started massaging my boyfriend's shoulders!!! I'm sooo Not Kidding!!!! We walked out of there feeling like we had just been a part of one of those "punked" shows, like "what the hell just happened in there"???I'd rate Augustino's a 5-star in entertainment value, because we got a good laugh that night and were very amused by the experience, but it's a 2-star on the food.  Sorry to the cult-like fans, but I just don't get it.
2010-02-03,5,Absolutely love this place. Almost left the first time I went in because of the service but that was before I tasted the food. You have to go there knowing it's the food not the service that brings you in. Also have to be careful who you bring with you because of the language from the staff. But that food is the best Italian around. 5 stars in spite of the service.
2010-01-31,4,I've been to this place a few times and always forget to write a review.  I love Augustino's for good old Italian comfort food.  Do not come here if you want a ton of different homemade pasta choices and a bunch of sauces.  The best things at Augustino's come with good old fashioned red sauce.  My favorites here are the penne vodka and the chicken parm.  I don't think the penne vodka is even on the menu... I think its a special that they have sometimes.  Its impossible to get a reservation, but you can always call and get on the waiting list.  A lot of times that has worked out for me.  The waitresses are hysterical.  Swear at each other and yell.  Its pretty funny and reminds me of my Italian family when we are all together :-)  I wish the wine was a little better though.  Not a huge fan of their wine selection unless you buy a bottle.  But again...for good Italian comfort food, this is the place to go!!  My favorite restaurant in Hoboken and what I believe to be one of the only really good places in Hoboken.
2010-01-23,4,Great hearty Italian style in Hoboken.  Rude servers make the meal more enjoyable.  Fairly priced but cash only
2010-01-14,4,My fav Italian spot west of the hudson. I was literally scared of the hostess though...she yelled at me for not confirming my reservation (she actually cancelled it...i had to almost plead with her to get it back). But once we sat down, our waitress took very good care of us. Their complimentary bruschetta is amazing! i wanted to order more, but it wasn't on the menu :( . The bread was hot and chewy and crusty...i literally couldnt stop eating it. The chicken parm was huge! my Farfalle pasta was great too...perfectly seasoned. I'm definitely a fan. Just remember its cash only.
2009-12-13,3,Augustino is a cute little restaurant with a homey , cozy interior. It is a romantic place in a way. Me and my wife both enjoyed the visit. Wait staff was very friendly. However, the food didn't meet my expectations after all that bragging I heard from my friend. The stuffed mushroom was good but over priced. 2 for $14, it just didn't do it. My wife's calamari was over cooked, tasted rubbery. My rack of lamb was cooked to my requested temperature, but was lacking flavor. I gave it three stars because I was very disappointed with the food. I guess, i just had very high expectations after we heard that Augustino's has the best Italian food. I don't understand why they have such a long waiting list and this place is hard to get into.  Not at all worth the wait, although when I called they fit me into an early time slot for diner and I didn't have to wait as long as people who want to go at a normal dinner time.Over all, I think Augustino is an over gloried and over priced restaurant. For some good Italian please check out Queen Margarita in Nutley.
2009-10-27,5,Great food and great drinks. Reservations are a must, but if you don't have one you can try sitting at the bar.
2009-09-30,4,This place was A-OK. Should be more of a 3.5 Bruschetta was nice while he parked the car, but I found it to be slightly watery and oily. Bread was good, warm. Muscles in white wine sauce was GREAT!! (Better when dipped in the sauce, and the sauce was especially good with bread.) I had - Chicken Frances: good, but not drop on the floor awesome. He had - Chicken Marsala: good, but not OMG I WANT MORE good. The atmosphere was small and cute, and the waitresses were super nice. However, with their delicious (and super-elaborate) descriptions for specials, they were hard to follow. I would have been more comfortable seeing them written down. Overall, I would have given it a 3 (perhaps after all that hype) as it didn't blow me away, but the muscles as a starter were really something else, and earned it a 4th.
2009-08-13,4,Very difficult to get a reservation, and they only take cash, but it's definitely worth it. The waitresses all have mouths like truck drivers and are hilarious and definitely friendly. The food is great too.
2009-08-10,5,This is probably the best restaurant in Hoboken.  It is also my favorite Italian restaurant anywhere.  My husband and I call ahead and sit at the bar.  We go early or on weekdays in order to get in.  I LOVE the mixed green salad and the seafood pasta.  They make everyone feel like a local -and really like you are part of their family.  This is a super rare and unique experience.  Feels like you might imagine an old-school, Italian neighborhood spot would have been in the old days.  The BEST.  Cash only.
2009-01-15,5,Absolutely impossible to get a reservation here from what I'm told... so we just decided to "wing it" on a random Monday night.  Everyone was very accomodating and actually we only waited about 30 mins for a table.  The place is tiny, as many have said, and only takes cash...so bring your big bills with you! It's a throwback to the old italian bistros of the past.  The swearing is nothing you wouldn't hear in old school Brooklyn, so just get over it already or head to Tutta Pasta, what can I tell you?The food is AMAZING.  I had a bolognese dish that I couldn't stop eating.  I am not a big fan of leftovers... and yet, I took them home, ate them the next day, and wouldn't even share with my dog (much to his dismay)!The complimentary bruschetta is good... and I had a lovely caesar which was great also.  I would come back in a heartbeat!
2008-12-24,5,As soon as we moved to Hoboken, everyone kept on telling us that we had to try Augustino's.  It's widely considered one of the best Italian restaurants in Hoboken and some argue that it's better than anything the city has to offer.  Well, we were not disapointed.  Everything from the complimentary bruschetta to the appetizers and entrees were absolutely outstanding!  I ordered the Lobster Fra Diablo and my wife ordered the shrimp parm and both dishes were cooked to perfection and especially hearty, just the way we like our Italian.  Yes, it's tough to get a reservation and even if you have a reservation you'll probably have to wait, but do yourself a favor and just take in the ambiance.  It's truly a throwback to old school Italian restaurants that you see in the movies.  And for those who are offended by the language used by the bartenders or hostess should stick to the Olive Garden.
2008-11-22,5,I was really lucky with this place, apparently they are all booked for rest of the YEAR.. you are kidding me right? what happened was as weather becomes colder and colder. I wanted to try some local place and found this place on yelp.. thought give it a try. Called them around 5pm, asking if there is any opening that night, host was kind enough to get me in for 5:30 the earliest. by the time i got there, i kept hearing host deny callers for reservation. so I guess this is a very popular place. Alright enough with the intro.. allow me to say.. the food was SO SO good.. one of best Italian i've had in a while. I wish i discovered this place sooner. I highly recommendEVERYONE to go try. Host/waitress were all very friendly. the place is cozy and romantic. Price was reasonable. 2 notes 1. Make a reservation 2. CASH ONLY!!!
2008-11-17,4,The chef's wife, Sharon, runs the front of the restaurant.  She greeted us with hugs and kisses.  She had never even met me before.  She has quite the potty mouth.  Every sentence contains a profanity.  Some people at my table found her language to be amusing while others were just put off by it.  I could take it or leave it.  I wasn't offended by it but just found it unnecessary.  Onto the food....Bread is excellent.  They get it from Dominicks Bakery in Hoboken.Started with chicken livers with onions and hot peppers.  Unfortunately, I shared it with a dining companion...would have loved the whole thing to myself.Sharon recommended the breaded pork chops with applesauce.  They gave you two of them.  They were tremendous,had to be close to three inches thick.  They were cooked to perfection. Potatoes and onions were served on the side. Applesauce just tasted like they had opened a bottle of Motts.  Next time I think I would have tried the sauteed pork chops with vinegar and hot peppers.  We skipped coffee and dessert.
2008-11-04,5,If you live in Hoboken, around Hoboken,you HAVE to go here. You will not fully have the experience of old time Hoboken until you do. In an where mom and pop shops are being traded out for chain restuarants...this is a real gem...where you will truly fell like one of the family.
2008-09-21,5,My brother lives down the street from this place and knows the owners so he was able to get us a reservation a while back.  "Cozy" is an understatement.  It's tiny and very intimate, but the food is some of the best Italian you'll ever find.  Quality preparation and an abundance of food.  The co-owner, who was also our server, swore like a sailor -- but she also made excellent recommendations that did not disappoint.Maybe it was a special they had only when I went but they had a lobster tail appetizer that was fantastic.  If you go and like lobster -- get it.
2008-07-18,2,Augustino's thinks it's all that, but it's not.  I must say that the food was guuuud.  I had chicken stuffed with prosciutto, cheese, & spinach with delicious sauce, and my husband had some tasty pasta.   BUT, when you have to wait 3 weeks to get a reservation at a place you don't expect the following:1. A weird, aggressive message on your answering machine trying to confirm your reservation the day before your date.2. To be greeted by a gum cracking rude hostess when you arrive.3. That two of the appetizers, a bottle of wine, and one entree that you choose from the menu are "not available tonight".  (Rotating menu necessary, perhaps?)4. That your waitress would bring your wine bottle to the table already opened.  Now, I'm not a wine snot, but isn't that wrong? They could have piped any old crap in that bottle!I was also annoyed that they didn't take credit cards, which we were unaware of.  My husband had to run out and find an ATM during dinner.The inside is cute and cozy, with only a few tables; it has a pizza parlor ambiance, only with a bar.  I expected a much more sophisticated dining experience due to the long wait for a reservation.  And it would have been nice if they mentioned the cash only thing when they called us to confirm our reservation.There are many less pretentious places to eat in Hoboken, without the silly waiting period.
2008-06-24,4,After we recovered from the shock of being berated by the hostess for not confirming our reservation, our trip to Augustino's was pretty darn good. The complimentary bruschetta is fantastic-- garlicky chopped tomatoes sitting atop nicely chewy, olive oil drizzled bread. The chicken parmigiana lives up to expectations-- it's a mass of cheesiness-- so too was the special meat lasagna.  The portions are massive so be prepared to take home a doggy bag. Augustino's is definitely good Italian food, but I'm still not convinced it is worth the month wait for reservations, nor that it's even the best Italian in Hoboken by a large margin.
2007-06-16,4,If you're looking for some primo Hoboken Italian, then look no further. The place is small and romantic. Its size and the quality of the food ensures that it's always packed. Don't attempt coming here without a reservation, our waitress said they've been booked now for their 10th strait year. Maybe this is only true for Friday nights, but nevertheless, call ahead. Also bring cash.
2006-09-05,5,Not sure how this place got "Pizza" in it's name here, this fine dining Italian restaurant is my favorite overall place in Hoboken. It's tiny with like eight tables, so make a reservation in advance. Family run place and it feels and taste like it. I can't say enough good things about it. By far the most romantic place in the Mile Square City!
