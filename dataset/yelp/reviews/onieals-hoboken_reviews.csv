2021-10-02,2,Coming back to O'Nieals for the first time in a year. While the food retains its quality, it was disappointing we had to wait almost an hour for our food (on top of the 30 mins we waited for the table). Hammered chicken and burgers are the go-to options here. The staff seems to be very overworked, it was impossible to get the waiter's attention. Took 15 mins to get someone to bring the bill. A lot of very disappointed diners the night we were there. I did really used to love this place and really hope the service gets back to its usual standard soon.
2021-07-02,5,Went to grab a bite by myself and was pleasantly surprised to find out that there's a $6 glass of wine special on Wednesdays! Enjoyed a glass outside with a delicious Turkey club. What really made my experience memorable was how awesome my waitress, Nina, was! She was accommodating and attentive and so friendly. I'll definitely be back, on a Wednesday of course.
2021-06-06,3,Overall the food lacked flavor throughout. The fries were good but lacked simple salt, the burger as well was well cooked but lacked any unique of cohesive flavor.
2021-05-24,4,The food has been very good for the most part.  I especially like their burgers.  They are kind of expensive and the service can be hit or miss, but I keep coming back for the burgers.
2021-03-05,5,So glad I finally got to visit Onieals! All the great vibes you want from a bar/restaurant like this that has been around for so long. Knew the burger had to be on my things to get, but started with their fresh fried mozzarella that was AMAZING. Like fried cheese curd ugh so good. The burger stole the show though! Cooked perfectly and seasoned all the way through so you get Cajun spice in every bite. Washed it all down with a beer brewed in town from Hoboken Brewing. Great spot and will be back!
2020-12-28,5,I have been searching for good buffalo wings all throughout Hoboken and have yet to find a place that I like, until today. Wings were absolutely amazing; the blue cheese dressing it comes with was very good as well (typically I do not like blue cheese). Also had to try the burgers as I have heard everyone raves about them, definitely lived up to the hype. Comes with french fries which were crispy and delicious.
2020-12-11,5,These best burger in Hoboken and maybe one of the best I've ever had. The penne vodka appetizer is a can't miss, along with the dirty martinis! This is the neighborhood bar everyone dreams about!
2020-11-15,4,Went here for outdoor dining and thought the food was really good. It was a little windy but the heat lamps helped keep us warm. I kept reading reviews about their burgers so of course had to get one and thought it lived up to its reputation. Ready to try their other burgers next time I go back!
2020-09-23,4,We were visiting my son in Hoboken over the weekend and he suggested that we go to Onieals for  a quick bite.  He and his buddies all said that this place has the best burger.  Of course I had to have one and they were right!  My cheeseburger was cooked to perfection.  It reminded me of the homemade burgers that we make for our bbq's.  Service was very good as well.  This place is definitely a solid dining option if you are looking for something quick and tasty.
2020-09-19,5,Our go-to spot in Hoboken. Awesome burgers always cooked perfectly and an extensive menu...something for everyone. The staff was so nice and followed all of the Covid protocols to make us feel safe. Quick service considering there was only a few waiters working. Can't wait to come back!
2020-04-04,5,One of the best burger spots in Hoboken with some of the best fries I've ever had.Take your pick with any of the burgers because I haven't had anything less than stellar. I can vouch for The Wall Streeter, The Alps, The All American, and The 3 B's.The wings are excellent and the chicken quesadilla is surprisingly solid.I'm serious about the fries. Best in the city by far.Don't miss Onieals if you're in the area. It's everything you want and more in a casual but nice neighborhood bar. Cool place to hang and drink, but it's the fries and burgers that keep me coming back for more.
2020-03-06,5,If you're craving a burger, live music (check schedule), great atmosphere, then you've found the place! Onieals has one of the best burgers in Hoboken. You can customize to your liking and you can't go wrong with anything you choose. Perfect date spot or night out with friends. Everyone is bound to be happy with their choices at onieals.
2020-02-08,5,Great spot for bar atmosphere or just dinner. Food is great! Been for dinner and brunch, both times have been really good.
2020-02-07,4,It's a nice little spot. Decent enough food. Not great (Chicken Fried Steak). Good service. Kinda pricy.But it is a cozy spot with good service in Hoboken open late even mid week.  They got blue cheese olives!
2020-01-31,4,Great place to stop in for a drink in Hoboken. Average beer prices. Didn't eat here but lot of people were waiting for tables!!
2020-01-18,5,We've been here two times so far.  Delicious food and the wait staff if very nice and attentive.  Decent prices as well.  We will return!
2019-12-29,5,Went here with a few friends and we all loved our meals. They have a great burger and even the veggie burger was very good. The best part of our meals were the fries, we all were so impressed with how good they were. We will definitely be back!
2019-12-27,5,Great burger and a fun place to sit and chat.  Bartender was pleasant, helpful and pleasant.  Definitely recommend stopping for a burger and a beer.
2019-12-08,3,The food was just okay, I got the Fettuccini Alberto, it was good, but nothing to rave about. The restaurant was dark and the service was a bit slow, especially for the restaurant not being crowded (it was a Sunday night). Maybe it is better as a bar, but for dinner, it was just okay, average bar food.
2019-11-19,5,Food was very yummy! I got a chicken dish that was so tasty and well cooked. I would recommend. Will be going back!
2019-10-12,1,Horrible meal and service. I ordered a burger medium well and was served a truly raw burger. The kitchen simply charred the burger I had cut in half and served it to me again with ice cold fries. If I had not been waiting 45 minutes before receiving the raw burger, I would have sent the whole meal back. I ate 1/3 of the now burnt burger that I was given. When I told the waitress the issues and that the burger was disgusting, she simply said "it's okay" and walked inside. Besides being ignored - I had to ask for a water and for silverware - the flippant attitude for a customer's complaint made me very unhappy.
2019-09-18,1,After craving a burger from here for 2 weeks, I went with a coworker. We placed our order for 2 all American burgers before 6:20 PM. We sat waiting for a full hour when the waitress told us "the grill is really small". Meanwhile tables seated after us got food before us. We asked for the burgers to go and the check because I had an appointment at 7:30 a few blocks away. I literally had to leave, foodless, while my friend stayed to sort out the mess. Waitress was unprofessional and rude. So annoying!
2019-09-01,2,The food, I'd give 3.5 stats's. But the rest, really not good at all. The service was horrible and even though at 9:50 we were told there was h
2019-07-24,1,Decided to stop here on my way home from work for a glass of wine and sit outside - went inside to ask hostess-they seated us with menus and then NEVER returned. We waited 15 minutes outside until we finally just left since they couldn't be bothered to come out and take our order.its not like it was busy at all they just couldn't be bothered
2019-07-15,5,Great neighborhood spot with something for everyone. This is one of the first places I ate when I moved to Hoboken and it remains to be a favorite. They make a mean burger, but when I'm trying to avoid red meat I go with The Church Square - rye bread, Russian dressing, turkey and GUAC! Legit one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Their weekend brunch is exceptional and features an extensive Bloody Mary list for those in need of hair of the dog. My friends and I love to come here on Wednesday's for live music and half price wine. The staff is super friendly, the vibe is on point and the food is really good. Would highly recommend!
2019-06-12,1,When I called to place an order for pick up the hostess informed they were to busy and would not be taking any orders.  Never heard of a business that didn't want peoples money.. they will not be getting my business today or any other day in the furniture.
2019-06-05,4,Best burger in Hoboken!Awesome neighborhood spot with good music and great staff.
2019-06-03,4,Onieals is a solid American dining option in hoboken. My husband absolutely loves their burgers and usually orders one every time we visit. Occasionally, he will switch it up for a steak dinner, which is a lot of food for a good price. I personally enjoy their penne vodka. They add sun dried tomatoes to it, which really adds a nice pop of flavor. If you're into cocktails, they also do these well. I love the mint tea- warning these go down easy, and I also have had some fun brunch drinks as well. This place is cozy, no frills food, and we always leave with our tummies satisfied.
2019-05-26,5,Great food, variety of music, overall great little bar. Not a club but great for food and music.
2019-05-11,1,Really did not enjoy the food here at all. The onion soup was mediocre with hardly any cheese on top. My son's chicken tenders were hard as arocknas well as the fried. The crab cake was thin with a very sloppy presentation. We came here because if all the great reviews and pics. We are in town for a minute and my husband wanted a burger and something simple. But was truly disappointed. Staff was nice and great service. But only eat here is you have no choice.
2019-04-30,4,Got penne vodka, soo soo good. Fried calamari for the appetizer was just as delicious and filling. Their bread set with drinks was perfect. Cute little quaint place in Hoboken. A little dark. But great atmosphere
2019-03-10,4,Great spot for burgers, salads and sandwiches.  Kid friendly.  Everything was fresh and cooked perfectly. best Mac and cheese ... creamy and tasty.
2019-03-09,5,Best burgers in the square mile city. We hit this place whenever we are in the area. Sit outside on a beautiful spring afternoon and have a pint or 4. Not some pretentious hipster joint that seem to be popping up all over the 'boken.
2019-02-15,5,The best place for food ,drinks and music Ive always had the best experience when here, Service is great waitress is always tentative and prices are reasonable affordable and overall great comforting food and atmosphere. If I had to choose anything from the menu of which is the best I really can't,  since everything is delish. And if I must say since I gone there serval times I practically had tried everything and every time Im there I try something new. I really have no complaints. The only down fall about this place is they don't have a dessert menu option which I always love to enjoy after a good meal is a nice piece of cake.
2019-01-25,5,I love Onieals. What an extra perk living a few apartments down from such a great casual place. The burgers are amazing and I pretty much get the wall streeter every time. French fries are always crispy hot and delicious. the penne vodka also has a taste like no other restaurant I have been too- so good!! I ventured out the other day and got the Cajun chicken sandwich which had so much flavor. Staff is always super friendly too!
2019-01-02,5,Nice little spot in Hoboken! Low key and food is pretty good I got the fettuccini Alberto and it was a pretty big portion. The bottles of wine are pretty affordable for the area and I would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a quick little bite with a nice ambiance.
2018-12-30,4,Solid brunch experience.  We had the Eggs Sardeaux and Irish breakfast. Both hearty and filling.
2018-11-02,2,We were trying to decide on a brunch destination, and I mentioned that I had never visited Onieals.  We figured that their back room would offer some solace from the crazy football fans we assumed would be surrounding the bar.  We decided that this was a good time to give it a shot and wound up being correct on the benefit of the quiet back room.  Others had apparently had the same notion, since we had a brief 10 minute wait for our table.  Once we were seated, I selected a Proud Mary from their substantial Bloody Mary list.  This version was described as "New Orleans style" with Old Bay seasoning on the rim and a stalk of pickled asparagus as a garnish.  I found their juice mix to be too tomato-ish and reminiscent of salsa.  It needed some horseradish and Worcestershire sauce for a savory kick.  Also, I took a bite of the pickled stalk of asparagus and looked down at the remaining half of the green stick only to find, to my horror, green mold growing on it!  I quickly spit out the first bite, which I had thankfully not swallowed, and alerted our server.  He returned with a new version of the beverage without the offending garnish, which I cautiously enjoyed.In terms of my meal, I decided to steer clear of the sandwiches and burgers, opting instead for the healthier Grilled Chicken Salad.  A large plate of Mixed Greens were topped with grilled chicken, Bermuda onion, tomatoes, Kalamata olives, capers, and fresh mozzarella, all beneath a light dressing of balsamic vinaigrette.  The poultry was a bit dry, but otherwise flavorful.  Aside from the chicken, the rest of the salad was not very inspired or unique.Sure, I was happy to finally try Onieals, but I was not thrilled by the actual experience.  I would give it a 2.5-star rating.
2018-10-03,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The food is consistently good and the waiters are fantastic. Both my boyfriend and I enjoy the food, and can always agree on going here. It's great that they have a gluten free burger option (that's delicious!) and have all gluten free options marked on the menu. They also have gluten free beer and cider.
2018-09-19,5,Alexandra, can't say enough about her excellent service! She was amazing... and fun!  Thank you to Alfredo for making us "Bellinis ".  Food, drink, and service A+
2018-08-29,5,One of my new favorite places in Hoboken. You have to get the penne vodka or the chicken parm with vodka sauce. We were shamelessly scraping our plates.
2018-08-16,5,Awesome burger, great bloody mary.
2018-08-16,4,Went in for a late Wednesday night dinner. Thankfully the kitchen is open till 11pm on Wednesday's. Outdoor seating is only available till 10:50, so my boyfriend and I grabbed a seat inside. For drinks, he ordered a whiskey sour with four roses (whopping $10!) and I stuck with the Summer Rye. Nice pour. The two of us split a cup of French Onion Soup (cheesier and just as flavorful as last time!) and fried mozzarella balls. There was a thin layer of breading and a ton of mozz, so it wasn't too heavy and really let you appreciate the fresh cheese. I wish the tomato sauce was a little more flavorful. For our main, we split the Onieals Fettuccine. As Janice would say: Oh. My. God! Just thinking about it is making me drool. We substituted the sun dried tomatoes for artichoke hearts at no additional cost. Even the pasta noodles were high quality and cooked to perfection. The sauce was so scrumptious my boyfriend and I were debating whether or not we should order bread to sop it all up. All the while we were bopping our heads to the music -- really great playlist. Even had to whip out Shazam. Again, I truly recommend you stop by ONieals for dinner. If you're not looking to sit in the main bar area, you can choose outdoor seating by the park or a cozy, romantic nook in the back room with dim lighting and candles. See you there!
2018-08-13,5,My favorite place to grab a casual bite or drink in Hoboken. The staff is always very friendly. The bar can get crowded, but sitting at a table or outdoors is nice. They have great brunch cocktails, as well as salads soups, sandwiches, and burgers.
2018-07-23,2,Was so excited to try this place. I walk past it everyday. I got a New York strip and it was plain awful, which is a shame. It was swimming in the disgusting gravy and had sooo many whole peppercorns on it. Gross. For $31 bucks I was very disappointed. Also when I pointed out how my steak was over cooked, it fell on deaf ears. No offer to re cook one the right temp or anything. Just, oh that sucks. Only reason I give 2 Was because our waiter was an awesome guy. Hoboken, there are so many good restaurants in our town, this doesn't appear to be one of them based on a bad first impression.
2018-07-17,5,Just stopped in on my way back from manhattan for a drink. I can't believe I haven't visited this place since I moved to Hoboken. I hung out in the back with a coworker while he had lunch, and I grabbed a drink and stole some of his amazing fries. Sara was very attentive and sweet, drinks and food were fast. Will be back Thursday with some other coworkers!
2018-07-05,1,A wasted meal for us. Terrible service and execution, I almost walked out. We visited on Wed July 4th mid afternoon and Onieals was lightly filled as we were seated immediately. We quickly placed orders for drinks and meals. Our drinks made it back to us quickly but then we waited for 30 minutes for our meals. A salad....and a burger; seriously? Should've been 12 minutes, max! 30 minutes of just sitting there with no interaction from our server to address the lengthy wait. Unacceptable in my opinion. I got up to try and find him and when I did he then explained that its a small kitchen and they just got slammed with tickets but he'd check for me. A few minutes later the meals arrived. The salad was lovely. The burger was basically raw in the middle and I after 3 bites I just tossed in the towel and asked for the check. 30 minute wait for a meal that was poorly executed - that's kinda where I draw the line. They didn't charge me for my meal, I walked elsewhere and enjoyed a nice lunch.
2018-05-31,5,Always enjoyed coming here and the other night was no exception. Food was good and staff was very attentive. Although, this strange guy at the bar was scarfing down jalapenos and blue cheese like it was going extinct. He proceeded to bark at the staff which was entertaining to watch, but probably not delightful to be on the receiving end of. Will be back.
2018-05-27,4,Perfect place for a date now that I think about it. I went on a Saturday night with a group of friends at dinnertime. It was about an hour wait. They let us sit at the bar if we were drinking. A tad annoyed about that.The menu is American food, the top item is the burgers so I had to try it for myself. It was delicious! Our waitress was very playful with us after I had no clue what I wanted.
2018-05-16,4,A long time Hoboken favorite.  Cozy if you can get a table in the back.  Great burgers and pasta dishes.
2018-05-11,5,Great Penne alla vodka and neighborhood vibes! The atmosphere is amazing and the service is great. Highly recommend
2018-05-07,4,Stopped in at 1:20 AM for some late night eats after a long night drinking. It is a small place and mostly the front of the bar was still open and the back was closed, but it was clear there was still enough people scattered in this restaurant. Ordered the Nachos with chicken and jalapeno cheese fries, um it was amazing!! I know that although we were drinking it may not be the best account but I was still sober and we were just snacking before we ended our night and literally it may be the best nachos that I have had in my life. Chicken nachos, piled HIGH with guacamole, sour cream over a mound of nacho chips and cubed chicken pieces. The whole dish was clearly assembled then tossed into the oven so that all the cheese would melt nicely over the chips, it was literally amazing! Not sure why it was so good, but maybe it was the quantity of food, cheese, and guac or maybe I was just so surprised by the dish at this random bar. Cheese fries were piping hot, cheesy and very nice. Would definitely order both items again the next time I am here. Drinks were standard quite nice, nothing to really complain about. Prices are standard for Hoboken, was just ecstatic to be pleasantly surprised before the end of the night.
2018-05-03,4,my friend and I were there at late night because of the recommendation from a staff of another restaurant. I didn't expect much but both of the burger and the fries are pretty good. we didn't quite enjoy the nachos though.
2018-03-29,4,My boyfriend lives a block away from Onieals, so we always pass it while walking to or from our cars. It's always packed and after reading yelp reviews, it makes sense why! When we were looking for a place to eat dinner for our date night, Onieals was at the top of our list.The seating is very limited, but thankfully we came on a Sunday night and it wasn't very crowded. We were seated in the dining room and given menus to make our choices for dinner. We were sitting for 15 minutes before asking if we wanted anything from the bar and if we were ready to order - this is where they lost a star for me. We saw waitresses constantly visiting other tables, but felt that our waitress had neglected us. We didn't even get bread for our table. When we were finally seen, we ordered their hummus and The Wall Streeter burger with monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar. The hummus came out with warm, lightly toasted pita, which was perfect since we were starting to develop a strong sense of hunger by this time. The hummus very blended, so if you're into chunkier hummus, you might not like the texture/consistency. I usually like chunkier hummus, but found the balance of acid with the chick peas to be perfect. My burger came out exactly as ordered and the bacon was crisp to perfection. I understand now why people claim that Onieals has the best burgers in Hoboken.Overall, I would come back for dinner the next time I was in the mood for a burger in the neighborhood. If the service was better, this would have easily been a 5 star review from me!
2018-03-14,5,Update! Burgers and Mac & cheese 5/5 so good!! The waitress even brought over warm bread so we could mop up the warm cheesy goodness- we also really like the waitresses and the homemade pesto! So good!Great hidden gem, stopped by on a Saturday around 11 and the place was comfortably busy. We sat at the bar shared chicken nachos and drank whiskey. The nachos was loaded with toppings. Perfect for a late night snack. Bartenders were friends and helpful- will definitely return def a great place for locals.
2018-03-08,5,Went to Onieals in Hoboken with my sister when she came to visit. They were very hospitable and seated us near the door. I ordered the chicken parm and asked for penne and the nice waiter recommended me getting it with their delicious vodka sauce and let me tell you.... it was so amazing.  My sister enjoyed her vegetable medley pasta (the name of it escapes me) and she got an order to go for her fiancé. I will definitely be back to Onieals!!!!
2018-03-03,4,Loved the seating in the back! Way more intimate, warm, and cozy than you'd expect for a bar! We went as a party of six and ordered nachos and burgers. The pace was nice and relaxed for a group meal. Didn't feel rushed at all! Burgers were good, nachos were decent. I'd come back if I wanted a cozy, not too loud place to get some bar food.
2018-02-26,4,Good menu as well as beer selection. Decently priced as well. I've gone quite a few times and it's ranged from 3-5 stars, but always a solid choice and can't go wrong.
2018-02-10,5,Moved onto park avenue about 2 months ago and this is my go to place whenever my family comes into town to visit me. The burgers are awesome, Shepard's pie is great and the penne vodka is delicious! Prices are fine, nice selection of drinks and the bar has a nice young crowd on weekend !  Definitely recommend
2018-01-20,1,Used to be pretty good, but it's gone down hill lately.  The burgers were the best thing going on - but they swapped out the bun (was brioche) to cheap supermarket bun.  Expensive for what you now get.Fries are hit or miss - depends on the batch.  Lately they've been super dry.I've tried the entrees, chicken parmesan is not edible.French onion soup is pretty good.Location and outdoor seating is best thing going for it.  I hope they get their act together, I'd like to put this place back in my rotation.
2017-12-28,1,Such a bad experience at a bar, I had to sign up for YELP. I was at Onieals and JUST paid for a glass of wine at 155am. I then went to pay my bill and tipped as I knew they would be closing soon due to Hoboken bars closing at 2am then went to the restroom. I then came back and my wine I just paid for 2 min earlier was gone and when I inquired upon the bartender with the short blonde hair (the one that literally just served me the drink), she was turned around and literally Said "earmuffs" as in "I don't purposely hear you". Now, I was not by any means rude nor intoxicated but just literally paid for a drink AND tipped bartender then given cold shoulder cause the clock just stroke 2am. Now I have lived in Hoboken and bartended in Hoboken for 11 years and would never want to negatively peg a bartender but I was just simply shocked. I would never just randomly toss a customer's beverage and then purposely act ignorant to their cause immediately after, just the most insulting customer service I could think of. It is shocking and rude and more importantly scandalous as she took my generous tip and then dumped out my drink seconds later while happily collecting her nice tip. This bartender closing late Wednesday evening certainly ruined my otherwise great night but most importantly  ensured I will never step foot in this scam place ever again. Stay away as long as you can especially with the bartender on Wednesday with the short blonde hair who will rip you off of your money and laugh at you at all costs. Going home extremely upset after an otherwise great night. Thanks Onieals for single-handedly ruining this evening
2017-12-03,5,Best burger in town!! Love coming here during the week for dinner or on the weekend for brunch. They have awesome bloody Mary's too!
2017-11-05,3,Nice staff, good vibe, and a well written menu that touts that perfection takes time. But the food is just OK. Ordered a burger and the meat was done just right - but the bun, toppings, etc were pretty meh considering the cost. Strange to slack off on that stuff when you get the patty right. Fries were also way over cooked. Worth a shot if you live in the area - but once is enough for me.
2017-11-04,5,I've been coming to oniels for over 10 years.  Wonderful atmosphere, great staff and food. Great local place
2017-11-02,4,Meow meow meow what do we have here. The buzz around the mile square city of the booby boken is this place rocks - I'm talking Blarney Stone here folx. Drunkenly stumbled upon this place on yelp and just HAD to review it. Had a cute bartender back home in 'nam named Adam O'Neal. Made the best Jager shits and wore the dopest hats (and smoked the dopiest dope). Anyways try the fried picks here they most certainly do not blow. If they blow anything it's my ballz - off that is. I saw a bloke drinking his beer by cupping his hands and having his wife (yes she was hot) pour it in his hands and lick it out like a cat - lucky guy. I had a pound of wings and damn near broke the bar stool lol at least they were free! They said they're making a special reinforced stool for my fat Irish arse with a sign saying "reserved for Big Bird". Yes I resemble a large bird...at least I still get laid!!! (I don't really). You'll see me there every Friday so look for a large yellow man and buy me a shot. I wanna party with you!! Chickster out
2017-09-15,5,One of the best places in Hoboken. Come here every weekend for brunch. Bloody Mary's are amazing and they have a whole menu of different ones. All their food is delicious, but my personal favs are the penne vodka and chicken parm. Love this place
2017-08-13,4,Onieals serves great food, great drink - too bad the staff is annoying.  If you can tolerate some of the staff members, you'll enjoy it. Irish breakfast is as close to the real thing in Hoboken you will get.
2017-07-22,2,Went to Onieals for an early Saturday night dinner. The air conditioning didn't appear to be working properly, as the restaurant temperature had to be nearly 80 degrees. Ordered two cocktails that were very strong, but lacked any semblance of flavor. Ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich. What came wasn't buffalo sauce and blue cheese on a hearty breaded chicken cutlet like I was expecting, but rather a paper thin slice of grilled chicken. Asked for the check, the server puts it on the table. No "thank yous", no "see you next time" nothing. You don't have to be a Michelin starred restaurant to get the basics right. There's too many other spots in the area to give this place a chance.
2017-07-19,1,This is a great place.. but for some reason the owner has neglected to fix the air conditioning in the front room which has been broken for some time! Unacceptable, we want to cool off when we need a drink at our favorite place and not sweat like we're at the beach! Fix it already! Appreciate your customers like we appreciate you Onieals.
2017-06-28,2,I keep trying to like this restaurant, but it seems every time I go something turns me off. This week I went for dinner and while the food was ok, it was nothing special.Aside from the food not being good, it is overpriced too. This week the waitress was just rude. Not at all friendly and openly annoyed that she had to work. It was a nice night out, but we were unable to get outdoor seating. That's understandable because the area outside is very small. All in all, it was an ok meal in an ok restaurant with less than ok service. I've tried, but I won't be going back again.
2017-06-14,2,Visited Onieals on Sunday after going through the mostly good reviews on Yelp. Visited along with my wife for brunch. We received a cold, distant welcome from the guy who greeted us as they had a table available but not enough chairs (we were 2!). The lady who took our order was really nice and took our drink, food order. Now comes the underwhelming part. We order a "Manmosa" (Onieals version of a Mimosa) & a "Knot your Coffee (their version of the ol' Irish Coffee). Both the drinks were equally disappointing. While the "Manmosa" was a heavily watered down Mimosa served in a mug (probably a beer mug), while the Irish Coffee was served in a wine glass with a clear section of coffee and a floating layer of alcohol. While we sipped on the disappointing drinks, we were informed that the food will be further delayed, since the kitchen was backlogged. This was surprising since the place was less than 60% filled at that point. However, after another 40minute wait, we received the food. The french toast which my wife ordered was as described and good. However the bread on my chicken sandwich was too hard, I could barely bite into it. At one point, the insides of my mouth hurt while I tried to chew on the bread. I didn't want to give 1 star, since the waitress were sweet, apologetic about delays and the french toast was good.
2017-06-10,1,A lot of my friends like this place so I have given it many chances but I'm not a fan. There is not a good beer selection - only Miller Lite for light beer. The bar in the front is small and not many TVs. The men's bathroom is tinier than a NYC closet. The back dining room is dark. There are a bunch of outdoor seating with views of the park which is nice. And as for the food I'm not impressed. The burgers are sub par and the fries are not memorable. They have a diverse menu but the only thing that I've had hat is tolerable is the chicken noodle soup. Finally the service is not great. Male waiter we had once was good but the female hostess is not attentive nor helpful. Takes a really long time to get a table and the hostess eats her meal in the main dining room for all to see.
2017-06-06,5,BEST.BURGER.EVER. This is my go to dinner spot.  If all else fails, if I'm hungry, if I don't want to cook, whatever it is, Onieals is the answer.  The All American burger with bacon is so mouth watering I may have to go over there when I'm done writing this even though I just had one yesterday... There is something to be said for the juice that comes out of your burger when you squish the bun down to take that first bite and I'll be damned if I find a burger that does it better than this one.  I've had a few others ( John Wayne & Caprese ) and tried the Shepherd's Pie on a snowy day but nothing beats an All American with bacon and french fries.  Plus, they have a really yummy wine list, intimate seating, live music and good service.  This is mine & my boyfriend's spot, its our happy place, it should be your happy place too!
2017-05-03,3,Hadn't been to Onieals in years but we were in town so we stopped for drinks and dinner. It was nice so we sat outside like we used to back in the day. We were there about 2 weeks ago and the meal was OK but forgettable (I honestly can't remember, even after looking at their menu on line, what I had). Take from that what you may. Service was fine considering we were sitting outside (and maybe easily forgotten).
2017-04-27,4,The burgers are amazing. However, the service is very slow. It took almost an hour for two burgers and fries.
2017-04-11,4,Visited this place for a quick Sunday dinner, and had a pretty nice experience. They seemed rather busy but the host was able to get us to a table quickly, which we appreciated since our 2 year old is impatient. We ordered nachos, and 2 burgers and were definitely stuffed by the time we left. The food was good, especially the burgers. I just feel that the waitresses could have been a little more attentive and friendly. I had to ask if they had a kids menu when she came to take our order, but I understand it was busy.
2017-04-09,5,Eric was a fabulous bartender! We will continue to come to oneils because of our service!
2017-03-29,1,Probably the worst steak ever.. When I asked the cut of meat, I was told it was a strip. I know my steak, this was a rough, inedible sirloin cut of beef for sure.  Sat at the bar and the music was blaring at 2pm in the afternoon, and the music they were blaring had f bomb profanity in it.. I asked the woman bartender if they could lower the music. It was literally her myself and one of her friends at the bar. Her response was "You can move to the back room to a table, it's quieter in there." I would rate it 0 stars if able. No coming back to this place. Awful
2017-03-27,4,Came here on a friday night for dinner with one of my friends. We had to wait a little while for a table but it wasn't so bad. We were able to just have a drink in the bar area. The food was delicious and perfect for a cold friday night with friends
2017-03-25,5,Onieals has always been a go to. Rarely an issue, but sometimes a little more head than one would ask for. Butttttt who would complain about that!!! Great beers with phenomenal head!! Cheers to that.
2017-03-16,5,This is my favorite bar in Hoboken. Food is always reliable - their French Onion Soup and Buffalo Chicken Salad is my favorite combo. They also have great bands on Wednesdays and good deals on wine!
2017-03-08,5,I came here for brunch on a Saturday with the wife and Max (Shiba). The brunch was delicious and the bloody mary was good. We were seated in the back, which is a little more quiet and private. This spot is also located near the dog park and children park, so a great spot to take a walk and roam around.
2017-02-28,5,I had almost forgotten this place but luckily I stopped in this past Sunday for a late brunch and was lucky enough to get a table in the bar area. It's more fun than the dining room and you can catch the game. Started with the buffalo shrimp. Great buffalo sauce, not too overpowering and lightly fried with no breading which is the key. Anyone worth knowing doesn't eat breaded wings. Great blue cheese dressing too which isn't always a given.Next course was the Shepard's pie. Great flavors. Very simple well seasoned ground beef, peas, carrots, and perfect whipped potato char on top. Near perfection. Not too filling which is nice. It comes with a side of seasoned sautéed spinach. A nice touch because we really needed something green on the table. Dessert: an Irish coffee with Jameson.It's the perfect winter warm up meal at a true  hoboken mainstay. Service is always great. This plays does food right.
2017-02-24,4,I really really enjoy Onieals. The only reason they're not getting 5 stars is because I always feel really cramped whenever I go (whether I'm eating in the dining room or standing at the bar). Their burgers are out of this world and you can't go wrong with their brunch. Their 1/2 priced Wine Wednesday isn't so bad either!
2017-01-26,4,A bit packed but once we sat down I really liked our food. I had a salmon special with capers in white wine sauce and it was very tasty. The Cajun burger was good as well!
2017-01-15,5,This place is high quality bar food at a decent price point ..  the fried mozzarella is outstanding.
2017-01-01,4,Came here on Sunday for brunch. It's a pretty cool bar near the park with great drinks and food. The Irish breakfast was good but took forever to come out of the kitchen.
2016-12-05,4,Discovered this bar on a Sex and the City tour around NY, it was one of our stops. I loved the atmosphere. It was a nice lounge and very cozy. I had a cosmopolitan, it was very tasty. I would totally come back here for dinner and drinks for sure. Very nice place!
2016-11-19,2,Some food over cooked.   Server at the table 3 times top.    Average at best.    Used to love this place.    Quality falling.
2016-10-22,3,This place was ok - stopped in for a burger and a pint while watching a soccer game on a summer Saturday. The service was alright, nothing amazing. The burger was decent - big enough for me to wrap up and take home. It's an ok place, nothing extraordinary.
2016-10-16,5,A hidden gem in Hoboken. I love this place....not one bad item on the menu. It's quant, cozy and relaxed environment. It's a local favorite and I've lived here for over 20 yrs.
2016-10-12,4,Onieals was our restaurant of choice for a pit stop in Hoboken en route to Manhattan, and I was somewhat stumped with where we should eat. Onieals had a casual feel, extensive menu, and reasonable prices, so we went with it and it was a great choice.We shared nachos to start (ok, a little heavy handed on the sour cream) and then got a burger (for him) and pasta (for me). Everything was good, but I have to mention the fries! I was snacking on them long after I filled up on pasta, they are just that addicting. It was an interesting concept with the loud sports bar up front and quieter restaurant in the back, but I enjoyed my dining experience.
2016-10-08,4,Stars = French onion soup (just add a little salt if you are a salt lover.) .... Penne Vodka insane.Good spot to go to on a Saturday night to enjoy time with a friend or significant other.Wine is on point too....I can't forget the Wall Street burger that my hub is obsessed with. Basically you cannot go wrong with anything you get here... Solid place you can depend on.
2016-09-17,3,Came to Oneils on a weekday for lunch. It's popular with kids at this time being right next to the park. Great location. It's a simple bar with the class. Decent beers on draft and very friendly service. I had the steak sandwich but ordered a salad on the side. I was brought fries but didn't correct them. The steak sandwich was good but the. Read was a little hard and the steak was slightly chewy. This was bound to happen when steak sandwiches aren't made with steak ums and cheese whiz but it is what it is. Not a bad option and if the weather is good they've got outdoor seating.
2016-09-14,4,Great food and service! Two colleagues and I stopped by after a long day. They were slammed, but we were seated within minutes. She brought us bread and took drink orders. The Dogfish 90 IPA on draft was amazing and a perfect temperature. I ordered the pasta special. Needless to say nothing was left on my plate! Would have gotten 5 stars however the shrimp that was added in the pasta was extremely overdone. Chewy consistency.. However everything else was outstanding. For appetizers I recommend the calamari. Def would go back!
2016-09-10,3,Food is excellent    Hostess is terrible   She doesn't understand the concept of a line.
2016-09-09,4,Very good American food - the burgers here are really tasty!! The Californian with the avocado is by far the best (so far). I had their Cajun chicken sandwich but my chicken was pounded to paper thin size, so unfortunately I felt like I was getting jipped  from the price. Also it uses the wrong type of bread..it was served on a fairly tough baguette, I think it would taste better if it was on a roll. The flavor combo is very good though still! I've sat inside where the staff was great, but when sitting outside it seems like service slowed quick a bit. There were times I'm pretty sure my waitress forgot about us, I had to go inside to ask for the check. Otherwise, this is a great spot if you're feeling like chomping down a burger!
2016-09-08,4,Very cool little pub on the corner of Park Ave in Hoboken. Not overly big however well set out and the staff were great hosts!The drinks and menu were well presented. The drinks were also well poured!A nice place to go and stop in for a bite to eat and a beverage!
2016-08-22,3,Went there on a Friday night after dinner rush. We were seated quickly in the room behind the bar area. It's still loud in there because the noise travels so they should close the curtains. They have a nice menu with good variety of drinks and food. Our meal took a bit long to come out, but it was good. I got the penne vodka and my boyfriend got the hammered chicken. My dish was just ok-- there was a weird zing to the taste and it had sundried tomatoes which are not my favorite, but it was creamy. The hammered chicken was like chicken francese with spinach and rice and was delicious. He said the rice was ok. It was a nice atmosphere, just a little bu loud from the bar. A good casual place to meet friends.
2016-08-15,4,If you're in Hobo and faced with the 'where should we eat' debate, then I definitely suggest checking out Oneials. The vibe is casual and relaxed, the menu has got plenty of classic and easy to please options and the prices are fair.I came in with some pals on a Wednesday. Partly because we were hungry and needed some food, but largely because of their 1/2 off wine specials. We had a great experience, and I'd definitely come back again for a meal out in da 'boken. Although there was a bit of a wait for a table, live music and half priced wine at the bar made it easy to pass some time. All of the burgers sounded incredible, but unfortunately I'm **trying** to be healthy and ended up going with a spinach salad. The spinach was just about the only healthy part because the salad was smothered in bacon and goat cheese- oooopsies. The menu has a ton of options - everything from pasta dishes to crab cakes. Regardless of what food mood you are in, you are guaranteed to find something that you want to eat.Hoboken has a ton of great dining options, but make sure not to overlook Onieals! If an hour wait on a Wednesday night is any indicator, the food here is pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back in on a weekend to try out some brunch.
2016-08-07,1,I was walking by the restaurant this noon and asked if i can get a table outside to have a brunch. The host told me it is 15-20 min wait while I saw 3 available tables outside. So I called and asked if I can reserve a table while the person on the phone told me that it's first come first serve and it is 40 min wait line. I asked how come it is first come first serve while there is 3 available tables with 40 min wait time and I got rejected for the table? And she totally did not know what to say and said "maybe we wait when they come back." Come back from where??? Lol Makes no sense to me especially that I used to come here every week. They definitely should learn how to have great customer service and not turn away their repeat customers while they have tables. Not coming back.
2016-07-30,1,Ive been here four time now and its always been slow.  This is not a good place for lunch or when your want a quick bite to eat.  Tonight when i went they were slow and to make matters worse they forgot to bring out one of my friends entree.  The food isnt bad but the whole experience is not great.  The service was slow, the place was way to cold, and a table next to is actually had to relocate because the ceiling was dripping.  Im sure there are times when you could come here and have a great time without any problems but that has never been my experience.  Consistency is key in the restaurant industry and unfortunately my experience here has been consistently disappointing.  I would have trouble recommending this place, would love to see things improve.
2016-07-26,4,Hit this place walking by on a hot and humid Saturday afternoon in July and it was like an oasis in Hoboken. Great people watching spot, plenty of great IPA pours on tap, tv's galore and a right friendly wait staff make this the place to be. Come on down, you won't be disappointed.
2016-07-12,5,I was looking for a lunch spot in Hoboken and I am so happy I chose this place. My mom and I came in the afternoon and sat outside and it was nice being right across the street from a park. Our waitress was so sweet and was doing a really great job taking care of everyone considering she was the only waitress working at the time. I ordered rotini bolognese instead of spaghetti bolognese and it was absolutely delicious...like I'm still not over how much I loved it. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the bolognese had such a generous amount of meat in it. I'm a big eater and I thought the portion was huge. I almost didn't finish but I managed to eat every last bit of it because it was that good...and only $13. My mom ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich and really enjoyed it. She was able to substitute a salad for the fries that normally come with the sandwich. I am already dying to go back here.
2016-07-02,2,I don't recommend the bar area to eat. Like a lot of places in Hoboken they blast the music so you have to shout at each other at 7 pm.  If it was 10pm I would get it. Food is okay but not great. Weak drinks- stick with beer. Service was rude. I always want to like this place but after 3 times with same experience- I say go somewhere else.
2016-06-27,4,Before even sitting down for my meal I fell in love with the outdoor ambience, the cute little park across the street, and the fact that it was inconspicuously located off a quiet side street away from the hustle and bustle of Washington. It was ideal for enjoying a quiet meal outside whilst people watching. Sidenote- they are dog friendly! Several patrons had their pups beside them at the tables, and the server even brought out water for them, I appreciated that.Their beer menu is a little lacking. They had a longer list of bottles but on tap they only had a handful. Nevertheless I tried an IPA recommended  by the server and I loved it so I was happy. For food the loaded nachos were great, nothing unique or more special than your standard nachos but they were cooked and prepared perfectly (not soggy, cheese melted, all the accoutrements included) so again, I was very satisfied. For my main I got the veggie burger with sautéed mushrooms and onions which was served on a baguette with fries. Although the bread was nice I would have preferred a regular burger bun. Somehow it didn't compliment it very well to me, also the burger itself was dry and lacked seasoning. I suspected it was once a frozen patty, but still it wasn't the worst I've ever had. My boyfriend had a massive burger which was awesome. I would suggest ordering a burger as they have a wide selection on their menu and they are massive!I would definitely return to try out some other options on their menu. Cute spot for date night!
2016-06-17,4,Enjoyable experience. We wanted to be seated outdoors but there were no tables available so we ate at the bar. The bartender was very attentive and friendly. I got the crab cake sandwich and my husband got the classic burger. Both very yummy! Just a bit hot. I literally burned my lip from the crab cake. Tasty beer too. Only getting four stars though because we waited like 20 minutes for the food order to come through, but we'd go back.
2016-06-16,4,During a little side trip to Hoboken while vacationing in NYC, hubby and I wandered the streets in search of a good place to have lunch.  We came upon restaurants and Yelped them real quick to determine if we wanted to stop.  Finally, after pulling up Onieals and noting their ranking, we decided to give it a shot.Walked into a pretty decent sized bar with one server moving around the room.  She told us we could sit wherever, and for whatever reason we opted for the quieter dining room in the back.  It was pretty busy as it was lunch hour, but since we were in the back it felt slightly secluded as there was only one other (single) person in the room.Menu looked great; it was hard to choose.  Finally settled on the Crab Cake Sandwich.  And it was GOOD.  Lots of crab, not dry in the least, nice and crispy on the outside.  The absolute perfect taste and texture.  Came with chips, and they're house made which is always always a plus.Hubby chose the Three B's Burger - blackened, bleu and bacon.  He enjoyed it very much.  It was pretty large, so good value for the money.  And his fries were super good - might even have been house made as well.I had a couple of Spring Fling pear martinis and they were delicious.  I love pear, so was happy to see this drink on the menu.Sadly, we only stopped in Hoboken to have lunch and wander down Washington Street.  If we ever have a next time, I'd no doubt come back to Onieals.
2016-05-31,4,Outdoor seating on the corner, great for people watching.Friendly and accommodating service by Brittany. We ordered a dozen raw oysters $1 each, and PEI mussels. Both tasty (although they should include more bread).We also ordered happy hour beverages. The beer menu is a bit limited (8-9) but $2 off helps. Also wine and mixed drinks available.Nice place to relax after a full day of sightseeing.
2016-05-27,5,I've always had great service and meals at Onieals.  Lotsa frat boy types and Wall Street guys watching sports in the bar, but the back room is a nice, intimate spot for bringing a date or a friend. This is American fare....nothing modern or fancy. Just tasty and satisfying. Clean. Nice place. Watch where you park. This is Hoboken.
2016-05-24,5,This place has shockingly good for a bar.  No, like, compete with a straight up restaurant type-good.The steaks are awesome, I've also had their tomato & mozzarella appetizer, crab cakes, and chicken caesar.  All fantastic.The ambiance in the back dining room is great as well.  I made a reservation here for Valentine's Day, and since it was later we got the whole room to ourselves. So great.
2016-05-22,2,It's such a shame  when the servers ruin it for the whole restaurant . The food was good except it took over an hour and our server was miserable, barely checked on us and and let's not forgot the hostess that refuses to smile. Won't be coming back...EVER.
2016-05-15,5,By far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.. Thank goodness I live a block away.  Their nachos are amazing and always smothered in just the right amount of cheese and toppings. I always order them.  The burgers have always been perfect and cooked well.  My roommate loves the church square and I can never choose between the steak sandwich and burgers. The fries are amazing too.  It is a great and welcoming place with a hometown feel.  The food is always on point and they have good drink specials during the week, especially on Wednesdays.  I have nothing bad to say about onieals!!
2016-05-15,4,This place is one of the better bars in Hoboken in terms of crowd, ambience, and food.         I love that they have outdoor seatings and an intimate dining room in the back aside from the casual atmosphere of the bar upon entering the establishment, giving you three options to enjoy whatever mood you're in.           The crowd is a bit more mature than the crowd you will find at the bars on Washington Street. The vibe is calmer and chilled. There's plenty of tv screens for your viewing pleasures. The staff is friendly and attentive. I ordered the Cajun halibut on a bed of salad. This isn't on the menu but thanks to a yelper I knew they had to have some sort of a fish special on the menu. The portion was beyond generous and it was soooooo good. I complemented the meal with a nice reisling and was fully satisfied.          I highly recommend this place as they do not disappoint.
2016-05-12,5,One of my favorite places to go in Hoboken. It's not the most packed bar, but I'm a big fan of that as you are able to hang out with your friends & have a conversation you can actually hear. They always have some sort of game on their multiple tv's & the music is always on point. The bartenders their are very friendly k they always are willing to suggest a new type of drink to try out. The food their is also excellent, especially their sandwiches. In all its a great place to go & chill with friends.
2016-05-11,5,BURGER. It's the best on Hoboken and one of the best in the entire region. The original is great but so are the specials. French fries are kick ass as well. Love the French onion soup also. The ambience is that of a cool sorta upscale bar. It's like if a dive bar suddenly got classy. It's usually not crazy crowded(since it's not right on Washington). Would certainly recommend for a date, drinks with friends, or a great spot to bring visiting family.
2016-05-09,1,Came here with a group of friends and had an awful experience. We had a waitress with brown hair. To say she was rude would be an understatement - she clearly hated her job and took it out on the people she was serving. Management did not care about her behavior and seemed to even support it. They do not care about customer experience. I will not be going here again - and I highly recommend you do not go either. Can't imagine they will stay open much longer treating customers so poorly.
2016-05-04,5,This place is consistently good. They are busy at night and on weekends, as they should be. The menu is pretty standard New American, but it's all done right. The beer menu doesn't shift too often, but it's full of good choices. The out door seating is on two sides of the block, meaning you can generally get a seat with the right amount of sun and wind exposure. Their dinning room is in the back and is a pleasant, quiet escape from the bar. Wednesday night is their $5 glasses of wine happy hour. It's worth checking out. The Glen Carlou is a great deal at only $5 and a must try. I love their Penne Vodka and French Onion soup.
2016-05-02,1,Prepare to have your mind blown.Came for dinner on a Saturday night with 3 other people.  Ordered a bottle of champagne and a few different appetizers/meals for the table.  When the waitress came over to pour the champagne, we told her that we were celebrating our friend who had just beaten cancer.  She proceeded to say that she doubts it, doesn't believe it, our friend just looks tired, and people make things up all the time.  WHAT? "Is this real life?" we all wondered.  We all were extremely disgusted, disturbed, appalled, stunned - I can't even think of all of the words to explain how we felt.  We were excited for our friend who just finished chemo one month ago, and to hear that the waitress DOUBTED something like that is beyond words.  How rude, insensitive, and sick of this human being.  We all got up and left the restaurant.  When the (woman we soon after found out was) manager saw us get up and leave our table, bottle of champagne poured and all, she gave our group the middle finger (on both hands, might I add) and called us c*nts as we stormed out of the restaurant. I went back in to ask for the name of the waitress, and nobody that worked there would give it to me.  I then spoke to the manager who defended her waitress, saying that people come in there and say things all the time so it's hard to believe people.  Why, in a million years, would anyone lie about CANCER? What would we gain by saying that someone went through one of the most gruesome things in the world?I cannot believe that 1. people like the waitress (and manager) exist, and 2. the manager at this establishment was not more sensitive to the situation.  She didn't care that the feelings of my friend (and the rest of us) were beyond hurt considering she spent the last 7 months undergoing chemotherapy; she didn't care that her waitress forced 4 customers out of the restaurant in a fury; she did not care about anything - not even the reputation of the establishment that she is "managing."Neither of these (monstrous & despicable) women have clearly ever had a loved one go through something like cancer.  I have never been so horrified and appalled in my life as I was with these women.I could never recommend this restaurant to anyone.
2016-04-24,5,Really have enjoyed this place my two times visiting. I recommend the nachos for an appetizer and the burgers are really reallly good.
2016-04-21,1,Hmm... parking was horrible... serving time was unreasonably long~ quality was just the merest nothing better nor worse than the fast foods... there will be no next time for me.
2016-04-15,4,I came to Onieals on a Thursday night for a quick bite to eat. I was quickly seating in the back of the restaurant. In the back it offers a very warm and intimate atmosphere. In the front of the restaurant there is the bar area with a couple high top tables. It would seem like a perfect place to grab a drink with friends. Onieals are known for their burgers and boy are they good. I think you can not go wrong with their burgers and also the portions size are generous. I ordered my burger medium-well and the chef cooked it perfect! After our initial order it took about 10-13 minutes to get our food. The wait time was not bad at all because they gave us bread and our waiter kept checking up on  us to make sure we were ok. Also, i must note that the prices here are very reasonable. I would highly recommend Onieals to anyone looking for a good burger from a small intimate local spot. I would rate Onieals as follows: Food Quality is 4 Stars, Service is 4 Stars, Atmosphere is 4 Stars and Price is 4 Stars.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-04-12,3,It was okay. The waiter was friendly and polite. The place was smaller than I thought it would be. The food was just okay and the prices were inexpensive. I had the Veggie Burger with fries and my friend had the John Wayne burger with onion rings. My friend didn't care for the onion rings, but said that the burger was okay. My veggie burger was filled with mushrooms - and I love mushrooms - but I think it had too many of them. Overall, it is a decent place to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find parking and eat there again (unless my friends want to go, that is.)
2016-04-10,3,Decent and inexpensive brunch food for the area.We stopped by as a party of three on a Sunday for brunch, and we had to wait around 30 minutes for a table when arriving at noon given that it's a fairly small space. I split the Alps burger and the Ragin' Cajun burger with a friend, and while it tasted fine and reasonably well prepared, I found the patties to lack any distinctive flavor. I preferred the Ragin' Cajun between the two, but that might have been due to the remoulade and the texture from the crispy onions and not because of any different flavors due to the ingredients. The meal overall was fine and not very expensive, but probably not a place I'd go out of my way to come back to.
2016-04-07,4,Great service! Super attentive and friendly staff. $5 wine Wednesday's and live music is awesome. I ordered the crab cake sandwich and was not a fan... The crab cake was overcooked/over fried, too much batter and the taste of oil was too pronounced. A couple of my friends ordered the garden/veggie burger and said it was one of the best veggie burgers they've had!
2016-03-30,1,Lunch service is the worst and when I finally did receive my order the chicken was like dried out card board. Dinner cooks are ok lunch is a total disaster from the service to the food.
2016-03-17,5,Great atmosphere! The chicken Montrachet might be my favorite meal in all of hoboken. I highly recommend this place to everyone
2016-03-06,4,Nice place, good crowd, it is very comfortable and the staff are friendly.  Food is good, I had a burger, tasty.  Would recommend.
2016-02-29,5,Quality burger, fantastic service and nice place to have dinner. Although I have to say burger and fries was too much for dinner but it was absolutely delicious. I also went beyond 20% tip as our waitress was just awesome. Highly recommended.
2016-02-26,1,I was really excited about trying this place. I have been in Hoboken for about 5 years and had always heard great things about Onieals particularly the burgers.  So my girlfriend and I finally decided to try it.  I would have to say it was one of the worst burgers I have had in Hoboken, JC and NY.  The reviews were so positive and even recommended to my by a co-worker but I would never return here. The place is smaller and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The staff was nice as well as the bar/restaurant area. We ordered the spicy pasta as an appetizer which was al dente close to raw. It was under cooked by I would say at least 3 minutes.  The sauce itself was actually very flavorful but under cooked pasta ruined the dish. For our burgers I ordered the Wallstreeter and my girlfriend ordered the Californian burger.  Both tasted of nothing but a big ball of grease.  The fries were decent but still extremely greasy.  The burgers had no taste other than oil.  Extremely disappointing and on the verge of inevitable.  We actually went to Cabana afterwards for dinner because we were still hungry. I am confused by all of the great reviews here. I'm convinced that since people have to wait a long amount of time, they spend that time at the bar.  By the time the food arrives, they are in a different state of mind.  This is the only conclusion I can come to because the food here is an embarrassment.  Would not recommend and definitely would not return.
2016-02-21,2,Went for brunch. The male host who sat us was incredibly rude. The Bloody Mary was watered down. The food was good but there are better places for brunch in Hoboken. Skip this place!
2016-02-18,4,Solid service and food. We got the Philly burger with a beef burger and the Cajun chicken sandwich.
2016-02-16,5,Great restaurant/bar.  Food and service was great. Every time I eat there I'm never disappointed with the dish I order. Accordingly to my dad who has eaten tons of burgers and fries in his life Oneils burgers are amazing, fries are out of this world to him. I like going on Wednesdays for wine down Wednesday night, $5 glass of wine, can't beat that.
2016-02-15,5,I have had brunch and dinner here before. Both times were crowded but service was never bad. I love a place that is crowded but has speedy service AND fresh yummy food.
2016-02-14,4,I love a good burger and a pub that isn't touristy!  Hoboken parking is what it is so, we took an Uber but, there was street parking if you could get over the piles of snow.The front interior is pub style with a long bar and a couple high tops when you walk in but, the back section has classy bistro tables and a nice ambiance.  This would be a nice business lunch or date spot with a great view of the park area in the square.I ordered the Cajun burger cooked medium and served with fries.  The burger temperature was spot on and I applaud the beef quality that they use.  The Cajun sauce was so, good I was dipping my fries in it.  I can definitely recommend this but, the fries were a little lack luster.  My guy being the sharing guy that he is let me try his Penne Vodka and 5 stars on that.  You know when the sauce is sticking to the pasta that you are in for a treat.The pricing and level of service are both good and I think I will stop in to have a couple beers and another burger next time that I am in town.
2016-02-13,4,It was very busy since we came for dinner on a Saturday night so we had to find a waiter to ask for a table. But they were overall very friendly and told us we had about a 45 min wait and he was about accurate with the wait time. The layout is nice in that the bar was in the front where it was a lot noisier but in the dining area it was a little quieter, still lots of noise but better than the bar area. Once seated, the service was really slow; about 15 minutes before a waitress came to take our order, again perhaps due to the rush hour? I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt. As for the food it also took a while to come out but it was delicious so worth the wait! I love my burger; asked for medium rare and they cooked it just right. The sauce and the lettuce and tomato all came on the side so you can add it as desired.   The penne pasta and nachos-no words! Absolutely delicious, never had simple pasta tasted so good. We ordered a second plate. Despite the long waiting time to get seated and the wait time for service and arrival of food I will try to come back at a more random time in hopes of a faster service just for the food. So overall four stars with a star docked for overall slower service.
2016-02-11,4,Definitely a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of hoboken.  Sit in the corner in the back room and you feel like you have stepped back in time.  Food is always on point.  Try the burger which is one of the better ones in town.  Bring a date here you will definitely impress.
2016-02-01,5,I absolutely love this place. Really good atmosphere, clean, and the food is always consistent. I like their happy hour specials too!When I come here, I usually start off with a Parducci pinot noir and sometimes make my way over to a Manmosa. The mixed drinks are good too. Heard their dirty martinis were good if you can handle the potentcy.For dinner, predominantly almost everything on their menu is good.  O'niels is known for the burgers though, so you have to try it. My favorite is the Rajun Cazian. I think that's how you spell it. But the sauce is delcious!!I also absolutely love to eat their veggie burger! It's the best you ever had. And that's coming from a person that is a carnivore.Overall, get anything and you will love it!Even the bolognese!!
2016-01-24,4,Massive portions of food and tasted good! I got the burger and my husband got the eggs benedict. It was good! My burger was delicious! Really good waitress and had a good experience overall here!
2016-01-06,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE. I went for the first time out of convenience but the second, third, fourth, etc. were because it is just so great.The wait staff here is really awesome, even when you're sitting outside (which is more often than not).I've probably eaten half the menu and I can tell you everything is a great portion size, great quality, and just overall great. You have to try their fried mozzarella because it is super fresh and comes with homemade tomato sauce which is to die for. Oh, and the brunch/Bloody Mary menu is THE BOMB.
2016-01-06,4,Been here a few times - usually for drinks, and occasionally for food. The wait time and service depends greatly on the time you go - I think this place is great for happy hour on a weeknight. On a weekend it becomes your typical packed bar, with pretty long waits for drinks and limited seating. The beer menu is extensive, and the wine list has enough options that I just had them make recommendations. They've got TVs if you want to watch sports, and I feel like the fact that Onieals is a few blocks off Washington lends itself to an older, calmer crowd.The food was great - a few of us got the NY strip, which was perfectly cooked with a great sauce, and some other friends had the burgers which were also on point. We shared a bottle of wine and split the tab, and they had no problem running multiple cards.I'd love to come back here during the summer to check out the outside seating.
2016-01-05,4,Best burgers, nachos & BBQ sauce in Hoboken. Their servers are always great, cozy atmosphere and wine Wednesday is a blast. Sometimes their is a long wait for tables, particularly in the summer, but it's well worth it. One of the best in town!
2015-12-26,5,Just wanted to change this to five stars. I love this place, and couldn't think of a good reason to leave off that last star. The only problem is the occassional wait.
2015-12-09,5,One of our favorite restaurants to eat and drink! We Prettymuch pay rent there because we go so often. Food is awesome, drink specials are great and service is very friendly
2015-12-07,4,This is such a good place for brunch or to watch some Sunday football. I went here yesterday for brunch and it was delicious. They have so many good Bloody Mary and mimosa options. I got the Dirty Mary which has olive juice and blue cheese stuffed olives and then I got the Manmosa which has citrus vodka in it. Both were great! I got the church square sandwich to eat and it was amazing. It was turkey, cheese, Russian dressing and avocado spread on toasted rye bread. The fries that it came with were really good too. I will definitely be back for that again! The service was great, too.
2015-12-05,3,Listen - if you want a top two burger in town with a quality atmosphere, come to Onieal's. Great meat. Great roll. Great variety of burgers. Hand cut fries. Delicious. Fughedaboutit. Now, if you want to wait 45 minutes for your appetizer, and another 45 for that top two burger, and a waiter that doesn't care about you, come to Onieal's.  Some people don't mind waiting for food, some do. The choice is yours.
2015-11-28,4,Love O'Nieals ! I sometimes forget how much I like it there until I go back! Although never poor, their service has improved and it's quite efficient. Menu, food, and the bar are excellent. They lose a point because of their crowd..mostly cool people, but a few weirdos here and there (4.50 stars)
2015-11-15,5,Good overall spot, off the strip ("Wash") so it draws a better, more local, crowd, which is nicePros:Right by the library and park, you can make a day out of it without leaving a two block radiusGood food, and not just good for a bar, but actually good food in the back or in the barWe like the nachos and sandwichesNice servers, fast and attentive service with a smileNot bad prices without specialsCool ambiance and nice decorations, we love the art work in the backNice outdoor seating if it is nice outBread is really good, get oil with Parmesan cheese people!Good musicCons:Cold in the winter, they need to jack up the heat or seal the windows/doors betterKind of small, fills up fast, and could use some more TVs for the big gamesSo yea, I am a fan, a Hoboken staple
2015-11-04,2,$7.50 for a pint of Peroni? You are deader than Cecil the Lion to me. Sad too, because I am a frequent patron for dinner either just with my wife or with our two year old in tow. Stopped in for a quick drink and was appalled to see that this is what they are charging nowadays for a pint. And yes, I am NYC born and raised so I get local pricing, but for an Irish bar and Grill in Hoboken, no can do. A dollar less and we wouldn't be having this conversation. Good food, decent / small ambience, terrible beer pricing. I'm out.
2015-11-02,2,Not incredible by any means. We ate burgers which were decent but not the best I have eaten. Overall it is what it is. I guess. Once the Giant's lost this past Sunday I feel like we jinxed them by being here. Crazy but I am still learning...Bla, Bla...
2015-10-30,4,Amazing place with great food. Last night, I had their pasta with chicken and bacon......damn good. Their beer selection is good. I had the founders red rye, as suggested by the bartender, and his assumption was spot on that I would love it. The restaurant is a good place to catch the games Sunday's too.
2015-10-17,2,The good:The brunch was tasty, eggs Benedict are up to par when comparing to other establishments.Pricing is reasonable (sans their $8 bloody Mary's which aren't anything special, and watered down)The bad:I'm really disappointed that their waitstaff is rude. The atmosphere is nice but both times I've been here I get a rude, pissed off, server who basically wants to rush you out.  ACTUALLY, that happened the second time - a two top table was open right next to us and the hostess told us we needed to move because they had a wait on our specific table... It's funny because last time they told me it was a 45 min wait with no one in front of us.. Guess they just don't like me.
2015-09-27,4,Onieals is the best neighborhood restaurant and bar.  Their food is consistently good, and they have a variety of burgers, salads, and sandwiches. But I think their cocktails set them apart from other restaurants in the area.  All their classic cocktails are excellent, but they also have a rotating menu of seasonal drinks that are always unique and refreshing.
2015-09-27,2,First time here, a Wednesday before 5. Craving some good burgers so figured we would try here. Very disappointed. Walked into what we thought was the 'main' entrance on the corner of 4th & Park (the bar area). Stood there for about 3 mins, which feels like hours when nobody acknowledges you (there were 3 of us). Bartender did not even acknowledge us. Finally server came by, we said we would like to sit outside. There was nobody at all here eating, just us. Got our menus. Decided pretty quick 2 burgers and a veggie burger. Food was ok, not great. Burgers were cooked to a delicious medium rare. Had to flag server down for refills (now there was another table, but they only ordered drinks -no food) so service lacked. Tried it, but no need to go back.
2015-09-23,4,The food and drinks were delicious. Service was good but they could have used more help. There was only 1 server to take of all the tables, and on a beautiful fall day everyone wanted to sit outside for lunch. I would definitely come back!
2015-09-15,3,Makes good strong drinks...only had one drink there, so can't review much of the place...but it seemed like a laid back place.
2015-09-09,2,Unfortunately, I was confused and thought this place was another local restaurant.  I am not super familiar with Hoboken but use it as a great meeting spot for my parents and I since it's about half way between our homes.  So I usually send them an address and we meet up for lunch.  This isn't what I hoped for.  I called twice that morning to check on the capacity and was told it was slow... OF COURSE the moment we arrived they had been slammed 5 minutes earlier so we had a wait.  Not terrible.  We grabbed a bloody mary from the nice bartender... She was not gross.  The drink was.  I forgot to request shelf vodka and got shitty rail stuff which wouldn't have been so terrible but the mix was terrible too.  I also hate when I have to request a lemon and olives in a bloody- they are a standard.  We got a nice little unstable table in the corner of the dining area and the waitress was there within seconds before we got to read the menu.  She had to run back and check the soup of the day and when she got back a minute or two later we ordered an appetizer but wanted a few to decide on lunch.  Ten minutes later she came back to get our lunch order and another 5 passed before the app came.  We had all ordered soup and waited another 10 minutes for that.  When our food came... it was average at best.  The burgers looked good and juicy.  The salad was really nothing special and the turkey club was lunch meat turkey which was disappointing as my dad was hoping for carved turkey.  We were really hungry when we arrived and really left nothing on the plates.  I wasn't upset about the wait for the table, the wait for the ordering the wait for the food or even the fact that we had to go to the bar to get our check and never saw our waitress again until we were walking out the door; but, it was a lot of time for anyone in a hurry this wouldn't be a good choice!!  I'm not high maintenance but I know there's too many excellent places around to settle for good places in terms of food AND service.  Average doesn't get second visits.
2015-08-28,5,Onieals is delicious!! I just moved a block away and it's already too dangerous. I cannot even count on my hands how many times I have been already. The wait staff great! They also have some phenomenal burgers, but anything you order, you are sure to be satisfied. Highly recommend you try them out!
2015-08-23,5,Friendly service right next to a park. Amazing egg Benedict. Manmosas are the way to go. Amazing atmosphere.
2015-08-14,5,I went here last night with a friend.  The entire staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  The food was delicious.  I had the chicken parm and it was perfectly crispy with the right amount of cheese and sauce.  The fried cheese (aka mozzarella sticks) were also good.  I would def. come back here and looking at past reviews I need to try the bloody marys next time!
2015-08-02,1,I have never had such poor service than I did today at oneils.  Sitting outside I asked my waitress for water 3 times. I had to get up and get my own water and bring the pitcher back to my table. She still never came back to ask how my food was not bring me the check. I had to get up and ask for my check. Do not go here I you want to be treated with respect.
2015-07-27,3,I like this place because it is close to my apt and it has a great atmosphere. The service can be slow at times especially if you sit in the front. Today I ordered the French Onion Soup which I wasn't a fan of.  The cheese was burnt which ruined the soup for me. My friend ordered chicken parm and it was huge. My other friend ordered the "Wall Streeter" and she really enjoyed it. I should have ordered that, it looked amazing ! I Definitely would come back here for burgers and beers but not French Onion soup or Italian!
2015-07-25,4,This is my go-to place here in Hoboken. If you want to get away from the touristy bars on Washington and by the water, this is your go-to spot! The people here are amazing and is the best way to get to know some local people. If you're new to the city then it's a great way to meet others that live here too! The food is great and every time I come meet someone new! You need to take time out of your week to come here and get to know the staff! Always amazing
2015-07-22,5,I feel as though I could never adequately express how much I love this place.  They just have all the things that make me happy.  I am a huge huge fan of their vodka penne, crab cake, chicken montrachet, and most most most importantly their dirty martinis.  I won't even get into their bloody mary menu for brunch!!!  Also their burgers are excellent!Really that's pretty much a list of all the things I love the most, and they do them all well.  You really can't go wrong here. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.
2015-07-20,3,My salad was awesome but my boyfriends sandwich was only eh. There are a few small tables but we sat at the bar. Not a bad atmosphere and service was good!
2015-07-15,5,Also you must try their nachos...we get without beef or chicken. It's baked perfectly with fresh tomato and cheese and olives and piled high with sour cream and guac....getting hungry just thinking of this. Big portion size and delicious comfort food to share over a beer or cocktail. Yummy!! It's incredible how fast that tall pile disappears because it's so good!!.
2015-07-15,4,I came here during he day on a Wednesday, had a few people inside, the service was great, bloody Mary's were good, and the French onion soup was amazing!
2015-07-11,3,Great location, food is just ok, and the staff is so slow.  I never want to go to Onieals for the pure fact that no matter how busy or slow they are, our food takes at least 45 minutes to an hour.  I can't take how slow it is, when the food is just ok.
2015-06-28,5,Woke up. Still drunk. You want a Bloody Mary. Look no further. Onieals has the best Bloody Mary selection this side of the Hudson. Brunch is where it's at. Get here at 11 because by Noon you'll be waiting for a table.
2015-06-17,2,2 mice came out while eating. Been here many times in the past, love the food and environment. I did notice the backroom was dirty when I entered, no surprise two mice were out and about while people were eating. Never look for handouts, but was only comped a beer, had to pay for the meal. Not happy with how the restaurant handled the situation, not even apologetic as we left. Used to love coming here, doubt I will be back.
2015-06-09,4,Rekorderlig pear cider!  I'd never heard of it, but, man was it good.  Had the buffalo chicken salad and it was a lot healthier than it sounds.  Great blue cheese dressing and lots of shaved carrots.  I finished my heaping plate
2015-06-06,3,Cajun chicken sandwich came in very hard bread with a slender chicken cutlet and a rather aged tomato.  Service was very pleasant and helpful.  Kids chicken tenders were over fried and sad.
2015-06-03,4,Oniels is THE neighborhood burger joint - they are always on point. I've had some  of their other entrees and salads, and they are also really good. They have a lot of bar specials during the week, which makes it a popular bar hangout. If its nice out, take advantage of the outdoor seating. Service is consistently good. If this isn't part of your list for Hoboken Staples, it should be.
2015-05-21,4,Brunch with my friend.  Love it. Good place to go at Hoboken.
2015-05-19,4,Calamari was weak, veggie burger was arguably the best I've ever had. Love sitting outside! Wednesday is half priced wine and you can barely move. Sangria is really amazing. Not too sweet
2015-05-10,5,Amazing place. Great service, excellent staff, incredible atmosphere, amazing food. Best bar/restaurant in hoboken! The Pasta picante may be the best pasta dish in hoboken.
2015-05-09,3,O'Nieal's is a cool little spot off the main drag of Washington Street. It's got outdoor seating, which is nice in the warmer weather. It's a little cramped inside, which is a bit of a negative - so on the packed weekend nights of Hoboken (which is every weekend), this MAY not be your go-to if you want some space to breathe. Service wasn't bad: prompt and checked up on my wife and I with our drinks. The seating inside is sparce, so if you don't grab one of the few seats on the perimeter of the space, you'll be standing and moving around. The usual suspects on tap when we went: Guinness, Dogfish Head, Allagash White, Peroni, etc - nothing interesting or that made me look twice.
2015-05-09,4,Probably my favorite burger place around. It gets pretty busy around dinnertime but is worth the wait for a casual, consistently great bite to eat. The Wall Streeter burger (bacon, cheddar, sautéed onions) is a personal favorite. If you like crispy fries, you'll love these! Service is quick but I've never felt rushed. I recently visited here with some friends from Germany and they loved the place-they felt like it was a true American bar and they happily chowed down on their burgers.
2015-05-07,4,Onieals is a blast from the past.  I used to go here a long time ago when I lived in Hoboken primarily for drinks.  As I am older, I am starting to appreciate food more.  I stopped here after the Hoboken street festival with friends and dogs.  We dined outside because of the dogs.  I had the John Wayne, which was spectacular ... cheddar, bacon, fried onions on a brioche bun with amazing fries.  The burgers were very juicy and substantial ... we kinda joked that they tasted so good because we usually buy 90/10 hamburger meat and these burgers were probably made from 50/50.  Regardless, this meal was well worth the caloric splurge and pricing was very reasonable.  Service is great and there are signs telling you up front that each meal is made to order, so there might be a wait .... completely worth it.  I am coming back for $5 martini Tuesdays at least once this summer.
2015-05-07,5,We love it here. When we decide to venture into Hoboken, Oneil's is always a stop. Their burgers and fries are definitely favorites of ours. the location is lovely - right next to the park. Outside seating is always a plus too!  The service is always friendly and helpful too, we will definitely be back.
2015-04-29,5,LOVE Onieals!  They truly never disappoint.  From their Wednesday night live music and 5 dollar wines, a Sunday afternoon with peach sangria, or a girls night' dinner in the dining area, I have always had an exceptional experience.  Their burgers are to die for.  My favorite is definitely the Wall-streeter with cheddar cheese, sautéed onions and bacon.  The bread they bring to the table is also always hot and fresh.  Their house wine is delicious and the service is always on point.  Can't go wrong with Onieals!
2015-04-29,5,Absolutely love this place! It's pretty small so not a great place for larger groups, but that atmosphere is great and the music is awesome. They also have really good specials during the week.
2015-04-22,4,This bar is great for a casual night with friends or maybe a casual first date.They have some nice specials - $5 martinis on Tuesdays and $5 glasses of wine on Wednesdays.The burgers are really good and easily customizable to exactly what you're craving - they have a ton of topping options.I've tried the buffalo shrimp which were also delicious - and the crabcake sandwich for lunch which was mediocre (would not order again).
2015-04-17,5,Great peach sangria! The summer cocktailList is amazing and the food is also delicious. This is a smaller restaurant with a bunch of different cheeseburger options. I would highly recommend this place for a date night or girls night!
2015-04-16,4,I really enjoyed having dinner here last Friday night. We maybe waited about 30 minutes for a table, but the hostess was very good about getting things done. It has a small, homey feel to it, the bartenders were very attentive and the food was delicious. To start I shared the Buffalo Shrimp and the Fresh Fried Mozzerella, which were both delicious. I have to say the Buffalo Shrimp stood out the most and could maybe eat this every day! As my main I got the steak sandwich which was also really good. I will definitely be coming back.
2015-04-06,2,Went here for dinner after reading the good reviews online.  Terrible service from a bitchy waiter who gave off the vibe that we were bothering him too much.  Moreover, service was very slow.  As for food, ordered the burgers medium and came out well done.  Won't be going back again, not even for a drink.
2015-04-05,5,Awesome burgers, some of my favorite in town! Fantastic music and lots of tv's for when there is a sports game on you want to watch! The bloodies and mimosas are delicious! Love this place!
2015-03-30,5,This is the best place in Hoboken. The burgers are so good! I am in love with the Raging Cajun burger. It's hard to get a spot at certain times. I like to go right when it opens for brunch, or really early for dinner. Otherwise, there is a ridiculous wait. You can also call ahead and pick up food to go. Love this place!
2015-03-21,4,Fantastic burgers. Can be a little crowded and uncomfortable at times but that's due to the high quality. Good problem to have I guess. Burgers are worth it.
2015-03-02,5,Great steak, 14 oz, nice spinach, chicken great as well, try French onion soup nice quaint dining area in rear
2015-02-21,4,A real neighborhood joint. Had dinner on a recent crowded Friday and the cozy back room still felt like going to a friend's house. Everyone was super-nice, from the hostess to the waitress to the busboy. Warm bread with olive oil and a little butter and shredded cheese to nibble on while you wait for your meal is a nice lagniappe, and extra points for bringing some no matter what you order. Food was cooked exactly as we requested, and even though the place was full we were never rushed and had a perfectly paced meal. Couldn't ask for more.
2015-02-15,4,Neighborhood favorite. Pros: food is pretty good, but I'd stick with the basics, like the burgers and appetizers.  Staff is attentive and friendly. Music and ambiance is very goodCons: beer list could be better. Wait time for food can be long. Overall: I'd probably give them 3.5 stars if I could, but I'll bump it up to a 4. The casual and local atmosphere give it a nod over the Washington Street bars/restaurants.
2015-02-15,3,The food is acceptable. The staff should be retrained in professionalism. I was disgusted by some backhanded comments made toward a family with a child walking around, and towards a few of my guests, asking about reservations and drink specials. Service is important to me, which is why I will not be returning to this location.
2015-01-22,5,Amazing burger. Cooked perfectly with all the right condiments!
2015-01-21,5,It's a quite nice place, if you are looking for a place to go out on a date, this one could be a good option.. It's pretty cozy, so perhaps you wanna hold someone once you are here thou! And they know how to properly serve a Guinness, you don't know how hard is to get a good Guinness well poured! Bartenders and waiters were really kind and polite. So, let's talk about food It was well prepared and good flavors.. If you are looking for fancy and well designed dishes, you should keep looking around because this place is more traditional! Love it!
2015-01-15,3,I wish this place delivered!The food is pretty good. I ordered their steak sandwich which comes with caramelized onions and garlic butter. I enjoyed it. They have outdoor seating when it's nice out and inside they have a bar area with TVs and a nicer dining area. I also didn't realize they have a location in SoHo.Last time I dined in, the waitress must have forgotten to place our order because it didn't come out for at least 45 minutes to an hour. But other than that one occasion this is a nice bar in mid-town Hoboken.
2015-01-10,1,Their food is more than adequate but their help staff needs to be taught a lesson in manners. My wife just went there tonight to have dinner with her friends. She was waiting for a table for quite awhile. She offered the people at this one table who had clearly finished their dinner and were just having drinks if she could have their table and she would gladly buy them a drink if she could have their table.All parties agreed but the server was not happy with this arrangement.My wife informed the waitress that she just had gone undergone breast cancer surgery and the people at the table were more than agreeable to give up the table.What really did it in was when the waitress said "Good for you and breast cancer".Really? Sorry Onieals, I really enjoyed your food, but when you have people working for you like that, my family and I are not coming back.
2015-01-06,2,This place is always packed, however the crowd here is terrible. The service is also poor- the waiters do not know their own menu. Came here on a Friday night for dinner, and a middle-aged drunk lady sitting at another table started yelling at me and my friends, even though we were not provoking her. The cocktails are the only good thing about this place. Burgers are not unique enough for me to come back.
2015-01-02,4,Living down the street from Onieals is a blessing and a curse.  I have never had a bad meal here and the service is always very good with a friendly staff.  Whether you're going for brunch, lunch or dinner the menu has some great options.You can never go wrong with one of the delicious burgers and the Chicken Montrachet entree is out of this world.Highly recommend!
2014-12-22,4,I was pleasantly surprised by how great the food was here.  I have been here several times now and I have enjoyed all my experiences here.When it's nice out they have outdoor seating, so if you like people watching and just being outdoors this is a great place.I love their burgers, I have ordered a few and they were all very good.  I highly recommend adding an egg to any of your burgers, over easy though, so you can get the runny yolk on the burger.  It's a bit messy but well worth it.The service at times can be a little slow, but you will always be helped eventually.  Also keep in mind this is a bar as well, so if you are looking for a quiet sitdown dinner, this is not that place for you.  It does get loud especially if there is a big game on.I really enjoy this place and will be back.
2014-12-08,5,Love it! Outside seating across from live music in the park in the summer time. It's a great people watching spot in the summer time. And if you bring the dog they'll put out a bowl of water for him/her.The servers are wonderful and social. The price is reasonable. My personal favorite dish,.. the shrimp and pasta dish... or you can never go wrong with one of their burgers.
2014-11-25,5,Best burger in Hoboken (John Wayne is my favorite). Place is about quality, as just about everything on the menu will not disappoint. Nice low key atmosphere - 5 dollar wines on Wednesday are a good deal. Solid selection of beers on tap.
2014-11-24,3,Good food served here! It's not gourmet food but much better than your standard bar food.   To start we shared the nachos with chicken which were really good! Loaded with cheese and chicken just like they should be :)I had the fettuccine Alberto as my main dish which I really enjoyed, shrimp and veggies in a white wine garlic sauce. Beware, the portions are pretty huge!  Service was good minus the hostess: they don't take reservations so our friends went early to wait for a table for the 4 of us. They waited 30 minutes when a table came available. Our friends explained we were a 3 minute walk from the restaurant but she would not give them the table since the 4 of us weren't there. Even worst, although she wouldn't give our 2 friends the table she gave that table to 2 other people (not even a table of 4). Pretty ridiculous.
2014-11-10,4,Went to dinner here with my girlfriends. I'd have to say I was quite pleased. The portion was pretty big, price was a little more than average (but it is Hoboken after all...)Our waitress was very nice and most importantly, she was friendly and making jokes with us, making us feel quite at home :) We did have to wait about 30 minutes for a table but I think that was to be expected considering the size of the place. It's half bar, half restaurant but I think most people hang out at the bar area. We went on a Wednesday night and the place was decently filled..so I'm not sure how it is like on a weekend, probably packed. Anyway I recommend checking this place out. I wouldn't mind going back.
2014-11-04,5,Great place and service.  Felt like a neighborhood joint with fantastic beverages and food.  Will be back!
2014-10-25,4,Great veggie burger.Awesome bloody mary and cocktail selection. Fun music. Nice outside seating on a sunny corner.
2014-10-13,5,The food here is fantastic! It's a small place, so you may have to wait for a table if it's crowded. It's worth it!
2014-10-02,3,Very cute place on the corner across from a park. We chose outdoor seating since it was a nice day. Definitely a good choice. The food was all right, but the service couldn't have been much slower. The waitress was nice and no complaints there except after over 30 minutes of waiting we asked for our food and she just said "it should be ready soon". I was a little taken aback because she didn't even apologize for the 45 minute wait. As a former server that would have been the first thing I did when the food finally came out. The food itself was okay, I ordered the hummus and my boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich. Not the best of either that I've had but the dishes were good. 3 stars is mostly for the service and the food not being spectacular.
2014-09-24,4,I love that there are certain things on the menu that you don't usually see on a typical Hoboken bar menu. The vodka sauce is the best, and my friends go there just to buy vats of it to take home.I've heard the burgers are delicious! But I've tasted almost every pasta here and can't decide which I like best. You can't go wrong with any of them. I am also a fan of the chicken montrachet. Service is great, very friendly and helpful staff. I also like the laidback vibe, bar in the front, restaurant in the back. And you can't beat the people watching from outside.I come here more for the dinner meal than brunch or late night drinks, but I've never been disappointed with this local spot when it comes to food!
2014-09-01,4,The restaurant has fairly good food at good prices for lunch. The issue is their restaurant seems somewhat small and cannot handle a surge of people. Today we had to wait an hour to get food after ordering but the restaurant generously comped our meal as a result.
2014-08-18,5,Love the food here! A lot of outdoor seating. At night they have all the big trees outside wrapped in christmas lights which makes for a very cool vibe. The service is great!
2014-08-05,4,We had dinner here one night, randomly, and our meal was pleasant.Decor: Inside is a pretty standard bar look/feel with a "dining room" in the back that is a bit more refined (but not too much).Outside is fine and has tables that (mostly) have view of the park - definitely preferred for nice weather days/nights.Bathroom: Clean, well lit, and well taken care of.Staff: Our waitress was very speedy and very knowledgeable with the menu and recommendations. She was friendly, bubbly, and pleasant and was really a joy to interact with while we ate.Food/Drink: The food is good, but pretty standard for this type of place (e.g. a "bar/restaurant in Hoboken"). There really wasn't anything that was absolutely amazing but everything was tasty and satisfying.Value: About what one would expect. There does seem to be a slight mark up because of the location but nothing that is unreasonable.It was a good, enjoyable meal but I don't know that we'll be running back for another meal as there wasn't anything THAT special about it - except for the outdoor, park-view seating.
2014-07-31,3,As if it hasn't been said in previous reviews:  Burgers.  They are yummy.  I had the John Wayne and was messy, flavorful and hit the spot.  Cooked perfectly as well.The wait for food is slightly longer than most places due  their small (really small) kitchen.  But it doesn't seem to bother anyone bc they still keep a good crowd.Parking in Hoboken = The. Worst.  So head over to the parking garage a few blocks down - attached to the hospital - bc it's convenient and pretty cheap.
2014-07-23,3,Someone from the restaurant recently reached out and was very gracious. Speaks highly of him and of the staff. Very classy. Hated to speak ill of them, even if temporarily, but the best relationships are based upon honesty. That's how serious I take my burgers and otherwise upscale pub food.
2014-07-20,5,This place a really relaxing, intimate vibe.  I like that they practice full disclosure with the sign at the table saying the food will take 15-60 minutes and to be patient.  The peach sangria was delicious.  I tried the buffalo wings and the nachos both were delicious.  I was too stuffed to try the burger I ordered with a friend so Ill have to go back.
2014-07-08,4,Beers and Burgers.  Will be coming back here again!  Their burgers were cooked perfectly and the waitress/bartender was great.
2014-06-18,4,I didn't care for the staff very much, on either of my two visits. However, the food is amazing!! I've gone for both lunch and dinner. Their burgers are amazing.. the mac and cheese is pretty great, steaks.. cooked perfectly. Best fries and cocktails! Ill def be making this one of my hotspots.
2014-06-15,3,After reading some great reviews, I thought I'd come try a burger. The food took a while to come out, and the waiters forgot to bring out the bread. the fries were pretty good, but the Cajun burger wasn't anything special. It really lacked flavor. Cute and friendly environment nonetheless.
2014-05-20,5,Can't believe I haven't reviewed O'nieals yet! I have never been disappointed dining here. This is a great spot for Brunch or dinner. The burgers are incredible (pancho villa & the wall streeter are my fav).  Last night I tried the fettuccine alberto for the first time and thought it was quite good. Even made for great left overs for my lunch today. Love when it's nice enough to sit outside especially in the evening when the trees are lit up with the white Christmas lights around the patio.  Short and sweet you want to eat here.
2014-05-16,1,Tried the burgers because of all of the positive reviews. They were so greasy we couldn't even finish them. Would not return.
2014-05-12,3,Let me say that I really want to like this place and other reviews are great, but I will not rave.  It is okay.  The service is usually great.  Nice hostess, servers and bartenders.  Food sounds delish and I love the options.  They cook to order, but always get it wrong.  I asked for my burger to be medium and it came out with a bun soaked in blood.  Literally dripping when I picked it up.  And it wasn't prepared how the menu stated.  Regardless, the flavor is great and you can tell the food is fresh.  Just hard for me to continue to risk the meal not living up to the standards when there are hundreds of restaurants in the area.  I still say, give it a shot.  Just be prepared to talk to the server if you aren't happy.
2014-05-03,5,I don't know if I was just that hungry or the food was just amazing.Anyhow the wait was super long 1.5hrs but it was worth the wait plus there's a bar and TVs with games on so not too bad. Food def worth the wait service was ok too. Would def go back, it was rainy today but the outside deck was very appealing would be nice to eat a delicious burger outside with a margarita. Price is good too, for party of three our bill was 40$ can't beat it! Go!
2014-05-03,5,great place all around. HIGHLY recommend the mac and cheese it really might be the best I've ever had I might go over in a little bit and get it again. steak is awesome wings too. chicken fingers are kinda a miss (I expect them to be awesome everywhere and these are just blah) but everythig else I've ever had here is amazing
2014-04-11,4,I really have enjoyed Onieals over the years living in Hoboken. It's across the street from the park so we go there with our now 3 year old son. They are always very accomdating and relatively quick (we do go early so there isn't a huge crowd). Food and beer is good. It's on of our "go to" places in Hoboken. Prices seem reasonable as well.
2014-04-10,4,Four months later, I am finally making good on my New Year's resolution to Yelp more (at all.) Here goes nothing! Onieals is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Whether it's for brunch, lunch, drinks and apps (wine night Wednesday!) or dinner, Onieals never fails to disappoint. The food is always delicious and drinks are generally on point too. I'm not a huge fan of their bloodies, but they serve manmosa's (the oh so delicious marriage of OJ, vodka and blue moon) so it's not an issue for me.Recently, I celebrated a monumental occasion at Onieals. I've been a fleeting vegetarian (fish eater on and off for the last few years) for eleven years (!) and when I decided to rejoin the world of the burger eaters, Onieals is where I choose to enjoy my first. This was no small decision - both Minetta tavern and Bar Boulud were in the running - but it was unequivocally the right one. As many reviewers have stated before me, the burgers at Onieals are AMAZING! My current favorite is the Californian with cheddar instead of swiss, but I've been steadily making my way through their impressive list. While I am sticking with the cow eating for now, the veggie burgers here are also phenomenal and will continue to be a part of my regular order rotation!
2014-04-03,5,I live down the street from Onieals. It really is a gem. I love that it is off the main strip in Hoboken. The food is delicious, probably one of the best burgers in town. It is small but it has a lost of character. The service there is also incredible.I remember one time I had ordered some food for pickup and they messed up my order. They did the best thing possible while I waited the extra few minutes for them to fix it, they kept checking in to make sure I needed anything and they even gave me a drink on the house. Class at if you ask me.Its also fun if you just go there for drinks, but it can get a bit crowded since the place is tiny.I love this place and will continue to go there regularly.
2014-03-25,4,This is the best burger this side of the Hudson (that we have found thus far anyway) brunch is great also
2014-03-14,3,the staff was very friendly...lucky enough we found a table on a saturday night without a reservation.the bar tender suggested the first drink on their cocktail menu....not happening for me...the IPA on the tap was good...nutty...bold nd grassyMy burger was cooked well but the chicken in the pasta felt a little over cooked nd tough
2014-03-13,4,So good, live around the corner and have brought 3 different set of visitors here because I know they will be more than satisfied. If I had one complaint it would be that it's too small! Great burgers!
2014-03-12,5,I love coming here for brunch, lunch and dinner. Their burgers are fantastic! All of our servers have been super nice and attentive. Everyone I talk to in Hoboken has been here and raves about. Don't shy away because there is usually a wait-it is worth it! And get the onion rings-they are awesome.
2014-03-07,4,It was a great burger experienced!cute little bar & dinning in Hoboken.servers were very very nice, have a knowledge of the menus + good price.many locals were there and I liked the decor of this place as well.I could enjoy my dinner more if the tables have a bit more space in between...Me and my husband ordered Mozzarella and Tomato salad, Chicken wing, Cajan Burger with French Fried, BBQ Burger with thin onion fried (shoe strings??).again, Burgers were really good and salad was fresh and tasty but only one tiny disappointment was the wings!Spice level were good thought but vinegar was a bit over powered and wing itself and dipping sauce were too salty for us.It was the very good 1st try. We'd like to try other menus in sometimes!
2014-03-02,4,This is a 5 star review for the burgers, a 5 star review for the bar service, and 2 starts for table service.  I guess that makes it 4 solid stars.  I really want everyone who is reading this to understand that this is one of the best burgers in the tri-state area.  GREAT burger.
2014-02-27,3,January 2014Dinner with the GFFood- pretty good burgersService- not very attentiveAmbiance- nice and darkWent on a Wednesday and they had an amateur live band. Also, $5 wine all night. AwesomeAlso realized that we came here for drinks once before (first date)...and was completely unaware that there was a restaurant seating in the back.
2014-02-26,5,Great staff, food, and selection of beers. My favorite things on the menu include their chicken noodle soup, any of the burgers, the church square sandwich, and the nachos.Favorite place in Hoboken for all around good times.
2014-02-22,4,Definitely good burgers. Somewhat loud environment with good food. Great service in An old style wood covered pub. Only one odd thing... The soft drink glasses are unusually tall and skinny which makes them prone to tipping over.
2014-02-20,4,Always great food and a good selection of booze. The only setback is getting in because it's constantly packed. The staff is very friendly and bartenders will strike up a conversation. They are my go to place in Hoboken for a nice juicy burger and a cold bottle of Doc's Hard Pear Cider. On a hot summer day, sit inside and order a Moscow Mule, the most refreshing summer drink.  They have great wings too.
2014-02-01,4,I didn't realize how small this place was when we decided to eat here but it was a cozy, romantic atmosphere. Although there were three of us just going out to dinner I can definitely say this would be a great date night spot and the food is good too.The bar area is nice to drink while you're waiting to be seated. I know people rave about the burgers but i decided a burger was not for me, especially since I'm not a huge burger person - they're always so awkwardly big for me haha. Neither one of us got a burger actually. I ordered the penne vodka with recommendations from the waiter and I was SO happy that I did. It was delicious and I was so happy to save some for home. I would definitely go here again eventually, but I think I would try and stop at some other places before I went back here. It was good but it did 'wow me' to the point where I neeeeeeed to go back right away.
2013-12-30,5,Had lunch here back in October. Sat on the patio. Food was amazing and the service was extremely good. Had the nachos and a burger. Will be coming back for more.
2013-12-22,4,Great burger! It might take a little time but one of the best burgers in Hobo. Casual atmosphere with some good beers
2013-12-06,3,OK PlaceDefinitely not bad at all, good service, ok food.go thte Gaelic Steak, and chicken sandwich, nothing blew us away. Steak was cooked ok, tasted ok, but didnt have any "wow" factor or anything. Overall if hungry and in the area would stop by, but nothing special to bring us specifically back.
2013-11-21,3,I've only been there for brunch.  I've gone a few times and it's good.  But nothing amazing.  The menu is small and eggs dont come with toast.The atmosphere is only Ok.  It feels like a bar.  The outdoor seating is nice in the summer but they don't do much to make it feel cozy,  the way Elysian does.
2013-11-11,4,As a Hoboker,  I frequent O'Neils several time a year.    It's a smaller place with an intimate atmosphere.   When my friends suggested it,  I was a little leary of going due to a terrible experience last time we went.   I wanted to give them another chance though,  so we agreed to go.   I was glad we decided to go there until we got there:   Hour and a half wait.  They don't accept reservations,  so be prepared for this.   Same wait on my previous experience,  so I was worried.   We grabbed several drinks in there bar a for a little over an hour and were seated.   The waiter came over and it happened to be the same waiter we had last time.  He scored an F in every category so I was beginning to worry the wait wasn't worth it.   We ordered a bottle of wine,  and it came out quickly.   The waiter presented the bottle and tasting properly,  which was a drastic improvement.   We ordered the hummus and crab cake for an app.   They came out quickly,  but we were disappointed with the portion size.   The crappie cackling is seriously under portioned for the money.   It's averagely dressed and very thin.   The hummus and pita is very good,  but could used some dressing to make it more presentable.   We were famished after the long wait so we flagged our waiter down and asked for an order of calamari to be rushed.   It came out lickedy split.  It was over done and also under perportion.   The girls order the cod special and my friend and I ordered steaks.   O'Neils has amazing steaks,  and I love their peppercorn steak.   It's loaded with whole peppercorn in a gravy over mashed potatoes  a side of sauted spinach.   I ordered the steak medium rare and it came out perfectly done.   In the end I was happy with mostly everything and recommend Oniels to just about anyone.
2013-11-10,4,Onieals is a nice spot in Hoboken, safely tucked away from the main drag of Washington St.  I happily ambled over to Park Ave and waited for my dining companions in the pleasant bar area, taking in the scene.  Families, friends in their upper 20s and low 30s, and a few dudes just there to watch the games on the TVs over the bar.  Once we sat down, I ordered a bloody mary and was impressed with the full, balanced flavor.  Not too spicy, not too celery-y(?), and a good saltiness.  Amanda J. was less happy with her "Manmosa"--which is a pint glass full of mimosa, served over ice.  So basically, it's a lot of ice, and not a lot of mimosa.  For food, I went with the eggs benedict and was happy with my runny eggs, homemade hollandaise, and tasty homefries.  My only complaint was that I was still a bit hungry after finishing, so maybe a side of mixed greens would help round out the plate.  Amanda J. got the eggs Sardeaux, which is essentially eggs benedict but with spinach and artichoke hearts instead of canadian bacon.  Honestly, that seemed like the way to go because I would have actually gotten some nutrients along with all the creamy deliciousness of poached eggs and hollandaise.  Amanda J.'s bf got the Church Square - a turkey sandwich with guacamole, cheese, and Russian dressing - which looked really good as well.  Next time I'm here I will either get a burger or the Irish breakfast, but I know I will be hitting that bloody mary up again!
2013-11-03,5,My boyfriend and I have gone here at least a dozen times in the past year and this place has yet to disappoint. We love to go here for brunch (highly recommend the Irish Breakfast) and the food and service are always on point. For Hoboken this place has the BEST pub food around and friendly consistent service. The bar staff is what helps make the place a notch above the rest. You can go anywhere for food...you come back for the service and atmosphere.  We'll be back again and again.
2013-08-23,3,I used to come here often when I lived in Hoboken. After moving away from the area, I have to ask myself, why DID I come here so much? It's really not that great. The food is average, food and drink somewhat overpriced, wait staff are stuffy, beer and wine selection average. Also there isn't a whole lot of room to maneuver around the bar and it can be hard to get a table during certain times of the day. It's average. The best part is probably the outdoor seating area across from the park.
2013-08-18,3,Terrible service. Seriously waited over 40 minutes for our food to come. It's a shame because the food is good too. I wouldn't recommend if your wanting to eat. Especially on a Sunday morning. Amazing food though!
2013-08-11,5,The burgers here are fantastic.  Served on brioche roll.  Thick cut.  Great hand cut fries.  It's also a great place for Sunday brunch.
2013-08-02,3,I like that Onieals has a very comfy and friendly vibe both inside and out. My boyfriend and I were on a hunt to find some good buffalo wings and the reviews seem to rave of them, so off we went to have them.Unfortunately, that never happened-- it was the first thing we ordered along with some cajun burgers with fries, but our waitress didn't remember our wings (we were literally the only people in the place on a Wednesday afternoon and she didn't write our order down). Nevertheless, we still enjoyed the burgers. I'm big on french fries but they weren't anything to rave about.I would probably come back but not as soon as I would have if the waitress was a little more attentive as the only customers there. If you do come here, try and sit outside when the weather is good.
2013-07-24,5,Love Wine Down Wednesdays! All wine $5. Great burgers too!
2013-07-18,4,Yummy fish tacos with white wine satisfied my Tuesday night dinner. A friend had the house salad with grilled chicken and mentioned its tasty tossing. Sit outside or hang at the bar, either is a nice way to have a weekday dinner.
2013-06-27,4,Came in for lunch. Had their Famous Sloppy Joe. Loved their twist on it. The russian dressing really made it! Had a couple beers to cool down from this crazy hot weather. Enjoyed my time here =)
2013-06-20,3,They have such amazing food, their French Onion soup is great, their burgers are on point, and their deserts are scrumptious! However, their service needs improvement. Last night, our meal spanned over two hours for two French Onion soups, a salad, and the baja chicken entree. This place is always packed so if you're stretched for time, I'd suggest other places to dine.
2013-05-30,5,I stumbled on this spot by accident one afternoon, and I'm glad I did!I had the Rajun Cajun burger at the suggestion of the very friendly bartender.  The burger took a little longer than I'm used to, but it was cooked a perfect medium-rare.  SO many places overcook their burgers.  Not Onieals.  This is by far the best burger in town and possibly the northeast.  Definitely worth an extra five minutes of your day if that's what it takes for them to get it right in the kitchen.  They have an unexpectedly good beer selection, so I tried one of their seasonal draughts, which the bartender told me was from a local brewery right here in New Jersey.  Very cool.I'm giving this place a fifth star based on the music selection and the friendliness of the bartender.  She was DJing from their iTunes playlist, and her mix was the perfect blend of classic rock, 80's and 90's throwbacks, and top-40 pop.  She even played a few Phish songs, which was dope, to say the least.Delicious food, nice staff, and very chill atmosphere.  What more can you ask for in your neighborhood tavern?  Way to go, Onieals.  I'll be back with phriends.
2013-04-27,4,One of our absolute favorites in Hoboken!  We used to live right around the corner from Onieals and went about once a month.  It was also always a place we would take out of town guests because the food is excellent and the ambiance is funky and fun yet quiet enough to hear yourselves.  They serve fresh bread to start with oil and freshly saved parmesan which is delicious, but save plenty of room for dinner!  My husband LOVES the chicken montrachet and claims it is one of his favorite meals of all time.  I used to always order the eggplant parm but then it was taken off the menu! (That's my reason for only 4 stars - I have an agenda that I'm pushing, Onieals!)  There is also a great beer and wine list here.  You must go!
2013-04-19,5,Another Hoboken favorite!  I'm just sorry it took me so long to discover their brunch.  Their brunch menu has so many delicious cocktails; it's exactly what you're looking for when you go to brunch with an alcoholic appetite. The meals are just as good; a perfect variety and a huge burger menu, and everything is delicious. Burgers are cooked perfectly, the Cajun chicken sandwich was awesome, and their fresh cut fries are so delicious!  To top it off, the service has always been pretty good.  When I was there with a party of 6 on Saturday, the waitress was so sweet and our drinks were always full (both water and otherwise).  Quality find in Hoboken!
2013-04-10,4,One of my favorites. My father came down for a late lunch/early dinner on Sunday. While I try to take him somewhere new every time he comes down, we often find ourselves here if he wants a burger, few beers and not a lot of loud and obnoxious people at the bar for a Sunday Funday. O'nieals always seems to be my go to when he wants something quick, easy and in the neighborhood or for myself if just want to grab a drink or two and something to eat after a late night at work, not in the mood to cook etc., I always suggest the fried mozzarella and a burger. They have a great selection of draft and bottled beers, however I'm impartial as they have Warwick Winery's' Doc Cider which I typically go in for. Warm atmosphere, great bar staff and regulars are all chill. I consider this one of the secret bars of Hoboken. It's far enough off Washington and in midtown versus down near 1st and Newark that visitors don't typically tend to be here. I personally think it's a great date spot or place to go after going out to dinner and just want a drink or two.
2013-04-01,2,I don't see the appeal of this place as a restaurant, I think I must be missing something. One of my friend's raves about the veggie burger there, so maybe that's worth getting but everything I've tried there I was not impressed with.My favorite aspect of this place is that the outdoor seating is right next to the park so it's a great place to enjoy a drink and people watch but if you're looking for a good meal there's better options.
2013-03-28,5,Amazing burgers and drinks!!! The "John Wayne" burger...drooool.
2013-03-21,4,I love spicy food, so the buffalo wings were a nice start to the meal. Got the hottest (buffalo) and was the right heat level to share, though I have a high tolerance and didn't find them to be hot.Had the Cajun burger cooked medium. Really juicy with nice flavor and great toppings. Blew away the other burgers and wings I've had in Hoboken yet.
2013-03-17,3,Good neighborhood gastropub.  Burgers and sandwiches are always reliable.  I've never had any of the entrees although my girlfriend has had some of the pastas and she enjoyed them.  Wed is half price wine night plus they know how to pour a proper Guiness!  Bartenders are super cool and they DJ with their ipods.  Sit outside when weather is nice.Only thing pulling this place back a star is that the live music is way too loud on the nights they have it, given the size of this place. Also, they really pack them in so it gets way crowded on Thurs-Sun late nights.  All in all this place is better as a casual meal and drinks spot than nightspot, but still one of my favorite neighborhood places in Hoboken.
2013-03-09,2,I feel gastronomically violated...yet I blame myself for picking this place for dinner based on the 4 star Yelp reviews:(I should have noticed that all the good reviews here are for beer and burgers, but not for ANYTHING ELSE. I was unlucky enough to be one of the customers who got "something else." We dropped by because my husband was craving burgers, and were immediately seated. FOURTY FIVE minutes later, we were actually served food. How is that acceptable? We just got two entrees (one of which was a salad) and an app. The waitress was nice, but after coming in to check on us asking "how is everything," it got hard not to sarcastically reply, "you mean our water and table bread? it's phenomenal...."On to the food. Our mozzarella sticks which were served ON a plate of marinara sauce. I had never seen fried food served ON a bed of liquid sauce before. They usually come separate. Needless to say, after a few minutes, the batter was soggy from soaking in sauce for 10 minutes. But that didn't even matter, because the mozzarella itself tasted like FREEZER BURN. It was clearly frozen for way too long, and the after taste was disgusting. But, to avoid being a diva, we sucked it up and didn't say anything. Then, after another eternity, our food finally came. The burger was decent - no complaints there, but my salad was beyond disgusting. It was a densely packed bed of salad leaves with balsamic dressing the consistency of lard. I mean, it looked like jelly instead of creamy dressing. I really could have had a better experience eating Wendy's one dollar side salads. i ate one bite and just could not go on.Anyway, i guess you could argue that this is a bar, and you can't expect a good salad. To their credit, i did mention that the burger was decent. BUT, if you can't get fried cheese right, and your salad makes me gag, I think you need to re-assess the menu and stick to what you do best - burgers and fries - rather than put people through a painfully long wait time and gross appetizers for a thundering disappointment when the entree comes. People - come here for drinks and fries. BUT NOT FOR ANYTHING ELSE.
2013-03-05,4,Wednesday = Half Price Wine NightWoo hoo! Definitely a great winter spot.This is a really adorable and super cozy restaurant and bar. The bar area has been a bit crowded whenever I've been there. Live music is entertaining, but often loud.There aren't many tables, so I've usually had to wait for about 20-30 minutes, but the hostesses are extremely accommodating as far as keeping you informed of timing.I'll admit that I'm usually there to drink instead of eat, but the penne vodka is delicious!
2013-03-04,4,Great beer list, wonderful burgers, best in Hoboken. Also nice entrées and desserts if it's date night. Music is usually decent, as is the service. Great bar and outdoor seating if the weather is warm.
2013-02-24,5,This place does brunch so well. The best bloody Mary's and burgers. I love the bacon infused vodka and the "make your own" aspect of the Bloody Marys. They also have a huge burger selection. Love it!
2013-02-20,2,The location and food are actually really great. The service is consistently awful. They are fairly attentive but no one there should be in the customer service business - they all seem resentful to be there. The Friday daytime bartender/waiter is particularly just downright mean. I don't think he uttered one word to us the entire time we were there - more like grunted.
2013-01-27,4,I booked a reservation here for Mother's Day and I must say we very much enjoyed our experience at this reasonably priced joint. Very kind and courteous wait staff, willing to go above and beyond. We were 15min late but they had a table already set up for us when we got there. The outdoor table was not to our liking because the air conditioner blew water on it at times, but they happily relocated us to a different outdoor table, no questions asked. The cocktails were strong and reasonably priced, and the food was expertly prepared. My mother had The Eggs Sardeux and I had the Church Square. Both were fantastic! I'll definitely be coming back.
2013-01-21,3,Visited the first time for a Saturday brunch.    It sits on the corner across from a huge, brand new playground which is great for those with kids.  The entrance looked as if it had seen better days and could use some fresh paint.  Walking inside you are in the middle of the bar area. They have a full bar with a few tv's. the space is pretty tiny and it was crowded so it felt cramped. The bar was busy but they had only one poor girl slinging mimosas and blood Mary's for all the thirsty Hoboken 20 something's.  She definitely needed some help judging by the amount of dirty glasses piled up at one end if the bar. She was doing her best but I had to wait a bit to finally catch her eye and order a drink.  2 bloody Mary's at almost 8 dollars a pop not really worth it in my opinion.  The host stand is toward the back of the bar room and we put our name down to get a table.  Their is only 2 seats to wait for a table so say a little prayer before you step inside in hopes you don't have to wait.  The seating area is tiny but not cramped.  The pictures that line the wall are very cool.  Photographs of different celebrities in strange poses and making odd faces adds a nice appeal.  The brunch menu has a breakfast section and a sandwich/burger section.  I was happy with my Cajun chicken sandwich, I just wish they would have used real guacamole instead of something out of a package.  Otherwise the food was flavorful and those with me all enjoyed their eggs.  Food prices were decent for the quality.  With all of the brunch establishments in Hoboken you should shop around and find which one you like best.  Onieals is certainly tasty but not my fav.
2013-01-11,4,No question, the best burger menu in Hoboken!Also a great bar staff, and solid beer list (including gluten free!).Try the Spivy Burger!
2013-01-11,4,No matter what is going on outside in the world, life is good at Onieals.  I've come here for brunch/lunch, dinner, and just drinks and it has never disappointed.  Sometimes it's a little busy to chill out, but even then it's a good time.  The brunch cocktails are good, their food is way above average in a town of B+ dining, and the beer list is respectable (almost always has DFH 90-minute on tap).  I especially like their burgers and fries.  Go here. You won't regret it.
2013-01-10,4,My 2 friends and I met up for the Wednesday $5 wine happy hour, each with 3 very different 2013 goals: to start going out more, to meet a new guy, and (my goal) to forget about currently being swamped at my job. At any rate, O'Nieal's fit the bill.I arrived first around 6:30pm, and it was very quiet, not crowded, and full of middle-aged people. Not much talent in the men department for my friend. I was worried that my Yelp research had steered me wrong, and started thinking about the escape hatch to Washington St. However, as time went by, a band started playing 90's covers, the place filled up, and by the time my friend arrived, it was lively and had some possible boy-o's among the local crowd.So the $5 wine special (all night) is amazing, and they have Pinot Grigio, Sauv Blanc, Riesling, Chardonnay, and Torrontes as white choices. We also split some nachos and a quesadilla at the bar. I was really impressed with the nice fresh garlicky guacamole, and the food was solid bar food in general. It's about a 10 minute walk to the PATH train, which is a good distance to start walking off said bar food. I hope I'll be back soon as we continue to try as a group to achieve our individual goals for 2013. Cause ya gotta have goals, kiddo's.
2013-01-06,4,From the outside it's nothing to look at, but this Hoboken spot is definitely worth checking out.  As you walk in to Onieals (a funny way to spell it if you ask me-I couldn't look it up at first because I was using the traditional spelling) you'll see what amounts to an old style drinking bar with lots of wood and charm.  There are bar tables in the front and regular dining tables in the rear.  You might think the food is so so, but it is not.The food is very good! With a varied burger and sandwich selection, a nice assortment of salads and some good ole standard appetizers.  There's a brunch menu as well as a regular lunch/dinner menu.  I had the chicken pesto pita with hummus and fried mozzarella as an appetizer, and a bloody mary.  My dish was on the small size but by no means was the taste small; it was delicious!  The burgers looked great and I was told by my family that they were equally big on taste.  A must see place if you ever go to Hoboken.
2012-12-25,4,Great for brunch - eggs sardeaux and eggs benedict, plus burger menu, are on point. Also great drink menu.
2012-12-22,4,Went in to grab a quick dinner. The bar was really crowded and we couldn't see a hostess, but once you walk toward the back, the dining room was pretty empty and we were seated promptly. I had the Rotini Arrabiatta and my partner had the Shepard's pie. Both were great, though the Shepard's pie came with a lackluster bowl of spinach. I mean, it wasn't even seasoned, so why put it there? Overall, good experience. Nothing special. The live music was nice, but boy, were we glad not to have dined at the bar. It was so crowded and rowdy by the time we left that it kind of felt like restaurant had a split personality.
2012-12-20,4,had a few drinks.  good.i did over hear someone saying the filet mignon was amazing.  so ill be getting that next time.
2012-11-12,3,Good variety of burgers and beer.  Outdoor seating during the warmer months is definitely a plus.
2012-11-02,5,Outstanding service and food. Great ambience in both the bar and dining area. I ordered the Alps burger medium rare and it was truly outstanding. The mushrooms were sauteed beautifully and the melted swiss cheese brought it all together. Served with fries and a pickle for a doable $12, this was an absolute treat. Paired with a Long Trail ale and some great conversation, Onieals deserves a visit on your next burger craving.
2012-10-11,4,Awesome place to grab a craft beer and watch the game with your friends.  I'm not from the area but hope that when I am back we try this place again.  My friend that lives in the area is a regular here and the staff treated her and all of the other patrons wonderfully!  Looking forward to going back!
2012-09-22,3,I agree wholeheartedly with the reviews that say Onieals place is solid. Staff was very friendly during my visit, food was made exactly to order, and taste was good. If you're looking for a nice, reasonable, comfortable place to eat where you will leave full (who isn't) this is one of them. One caveat for burger fans, while the burgers I've tried have all been good (cooked right, good flavor, nice combo of ingredients) being among "the best" is rare, and these burgers aren't quite there. I know it's probably just me splitting hairs. Overall still a good place and good value, making it a solid spot.
2012-09-18,5,One of a kind spot in Hoboken. While I love the outdoor seating, the friendly service, the beer selection, and the fact that my canine companion is as welcome as I am, my review is mainly for the Garden Burger Philly. I just can't get enough. Replace the fries with a side salad to try the basil vinaigrette and you have yourself a perfect meal :)
2012-09-04,3,Oniels is a solid three stars without a doubt. We don't live far from here and have been a dozen times or so. Mostly for dinner or lunch but a couple times for brunch. The food is decent here, the burgers are pretty great and the fries are good. Their other sandwiches are kind of hit or miss. I've had a variety, but if you eat here choose any of the burgers if going for a sandwich.Brunch was kind of meh nothing to write home about, I'd rather go to Anthony Davids, Elysian Cafe or La Isla. But it's close and has outdoor seating.Dinner service again is hit or miss. Last time we went, on a Monday evening. They wouldn't sit me until my fiance arrived, the place was literally empty in the back room and unless they expected a hoard of two tops to walk in in the next 10 minutes, customer service wise I should have grabbed a table. Especially while the three hosts sat there texting. Fine, you have policies, I get it. This last time we went because it was close and we didn't want to make a night of going out to eat. We were there for an hour and a half and we weren't drinking. The ticket time for a buffalo chicken salad and a turkey sandwich was over 40 minutes. We actually were about to leave when the food finally came. Our waitress never apologized, never explained what was going on and never checked in. I could tell she knew it was taking too long but she avoided it. I didn't want free food but an apology for taking 40 minutes would have been nice. It was obvious my fiance's sandwich had died under the heat lamp the fries were hard as rocks and the sandwich was too. My salad was just ok as well, not worth waiting for 40 minutes.They never really have specials to speak of unless you sit at the bar, which is tiny about 10 stools. Most places will extend happy hour to other seats especially outdoor seating, but they don't.The outdoor seating is pleasant right next to church square. It's worth a try and the occasional stop in for a pretty good burger and fries. But a lot of times it takes forever service wise and that drives me nuts.
2012-08-11,4,For a neighborhood "pub" - it's pretty f*&^ing good.  And this coming from a girl who doesn't do pubs.I kinda like their layout, how their window sills are used for seats (helpful when it gets crowded).  Drinks were food but the knockout was the food.  Again, I was NOT expecting anything more than greasy bar fare, but I saw a Mediterranean Chicken Pasta, and figured what the hell.  it was 10:30pm at night, and I never eat this late, but I figured it seemed like the healthiest option (despite being pasta).  I didn't expect to eat all of it - it was DELICIOUS!  Light but flavorful, loaded with tons of veggies and not greasy at all.I still think of that pasta sometimes! That's when you know a place is a hidden gem!
2012-07-29,5,I've been coming to O'nieals for years and it's always awesome. Best burgers around. Brunch is a bit pricey for what you're getting, but is great food. O'nieals gets packed easily (it's not huge) so make sure to plan accordingly. Outside seating is great and they are dog friendly for these tables.
2012-06-05,1,This place sucks. Twice in a row now they've taken a really long time to seat us (longer than they said) and bring out our food. Waitress tried to tell me it had ONLY been a half hour, when in fact it was actually over 45 minutes. Burger was burnt BOTH times, and not cooked "medium", but well done. They even managed to burn my girlfriend's veggie burger. Drinks were also overly expensive. Wouldn't go back.
2012-05-18,1,Oniels, I hate to do this to you more than you hate to see it done. Things started off seemingly well, late lunch outdoors on a beautiful May Friday but alas, dark forces were at work. The waitress would barely check on us and much time passed before seeing her again. This was at 2pm and the place was empty. It took an hour and a half to get thru a chicken sandwich and a beer. That was my mistake - chicken sandwich was a terribly plain choice; the fries were good. Closing out the bill was another nightmare altogether. It took 15 mins to get it and another 20 to track her down for messing up the check split (charged each card the whole amount). Since I didn't factor this extra wasted time in, I was punished with a parking ticket from HPA. I won't be back.
2012-05-15,4,I guess it's good that not many people know about this place.  The food is very good and the beer selection is excellent.  Best of all, it's about 3 blocks from my place.The burger may be one of the best in Hoboken.  It comes with different toppings (fried egg!) and a heap of fries.  I know my burgers, and I highly recommend the burger here.The service was really good and it didn't take long for us to be seated (we came on a busy night).  The only cons I can speak of are the following: nachos were average and the dining room is very small, making it hard to get a seat.  Other than that, Onieals is awesome.
2012-05-03,4,Amazing Burgers. Def a Hidden Gem.Wine Specials on Wednesday are great too !!!
2012-04-16,5,Love the burgers!!!!And all the food here :) Bar is super tiny but nice. Good date spot.
2012-04-09,4,I love Onieals! My beloved brunch companion is pretty picky with her food orders (basically, she creates her own meals) and they never have issues with her selection and the cooks always get it right.Not sure if it's only a night-time thing, but when did they get rid of the white paper and crayons on every table? I love to doodle. Nothing made me happier - NOTHING - than when I could color all over the table whilst waiting for my food.Yes, I am a grown child.Anyway, this doesn't affect the quality of the food. I've been here on a date and I've been here with my parents. Good atmosphere for all situations. The bar area in the front can get loud, but the dining section in the back is quiet and intimate.Four stars!
2012-04-03,3,Beer selection is OK, service is generally OK, wine is good, appetizers are good, Food is good but slightly overpriced.Last time I was there we had a friend meet us at a table for two. When I asked the waiter if we could bring up an extra chair, he said "No." Then we walked behind the divider and I started bad mouthing him and the service and we immediately got re-seated in the bar area with a third seat. The fact that he said no rubbed me the wrong way, but everyone else was nice.
2012-04-02,3,Overpriced for the quality of meats and seafood but generally tasty. Sunday brunch is popular. Friendly waitstaff was a plus. Tables are tiny. Bloody Mary menu is amazing.
2012-03-08,4,Great place to grab a nice burger. Come here when it's nice outside so you can enjoy their amazing brunch outdoors. The realtors here like to bring their clients for lunch/ early dinner. We recommend the mozzarella appetizer!
2012-03-08,4,One of my fave resto/bars in the Boconos. Quality burgers and sandwiches, and an outstanding brunch. Great bar / beer selection and only a couple of TV's, which is a nice change of pace. The decor has a classic pub feel without trying to hard. I get the cajun burger with chicken almost every time... also try the eggs sardoux for brunch.
2012-02-06,4,Hit here for Super Bowl Sunday brunch w/ my man, Blanco Jonny. We ate @ the bar.  I had eggs bene, Blanco had Irish breakfast.  Mine was good, Blanco loved his.  Guinness was fresh & tasty.  Bartender, Christine, was great & took care of us.After Brunch, some friends joined us & we continued to have a good time.  Staff was friendly & took care of us.While there I realized that they have been there for 27 yrs & I was going there back then, good to see its still around.  Peeps there were great, unlike some other 'Broken places.NY Giants Super Bowl XLVI Champions!
2012-01-15,4,Good burgers and wings never overcrowded for games, takes a while for food but overall solid. Entrees leave little to be desired, stick with burgers !
2011-11-16,4,A go-to neighborhood place. Great veggie burger - can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches, actually. I don't go here late night, but I love the laid-back atmosphere at a weekday dinner or weekend lunch. Get a table outside so you can do some dog (or people) watching.
2011-10-30,4,Oneials is great! I've been here a half a dozen times, or more, typically to watch a game. Saturdays the crowd is an Ohio State contingency and if you're not wearing red the owner won't acknowledge you, but will shake the hands of all the OSU fans you're sitting with (awkward...). When you're not subjected to a meet and greet (or, rather, a meet and ignore) with the owner, the place is totally chill, plus the bartenders are particularly excellent.I recently hit up a Sunday Funday to watch an NFL game and the patrons were a lot more diverse and a little bit less hard core. Specials at game time are a breeze, typically $2 Miller Lite drafts and $8/$10 Wings/Burger with Fries + a beer of your choice special. Food is fresh and I'd love to hit up a dinner here at the dining room 'round back. Truly, most experiences here are a solid 4 stars, but I'd like to give 'em 3 due to the weird experience meeting (or being shunned by) the owner for wearing green instead of red. Hey Mr. Owner, at least I wasn't wearing blue and gold!!
2011-10-10,2,We picked this place based on generally good reviews. Not impressed. Thought it was 'average' at best. Staff was friendly though. And the ladies room door opens right into the dining area!
2011-09-17,5,What is with the spelling??? They can fit in another vowel. Anyway- Best bar in Hoboken- I know that is not saying much- but if you happen to find yourself in the land of high fiving- crooked hat wearing - deuches- this is your spot. Service is excellent. Friendly. Swift. When you finish your drink, they ask if you want another one. I know that this is a simple concept, but a lot of places and bartenders seem to mess it up. Not at O'Neiaielll's. Haven't tried the food- but their ability to get a drink in my hand in a timely fashion has won me over. Bravo O'Nieal's... Bravo!!! (I'll overlook the spelling issue...  for now).
2011-09-10,1,If you like waiting over an hour for your brunch, then this place is for you. The service is awful and the food is definitely not worth the ridiculously long wait.  I can say with certainty that I won't be going  back.  I'll stick with the eggs florentine at Elysian.
2011-08-26,2,The kind of welcoming neighborhood bar that you would expect cheap drinks or back-backs --- except they don't have either.An awkward space that always seems packed.  They have an above average selection behind the bar.  Have been several times - used to like this place but more but have had a string of underwhelming times here recently.Everybody says the food is good, so maybe that's a saving grace. Under performer.
2011-08-24,4,Sat outside on a nice night in late August. Relaxing atmosphere despite the cover band inside (man, I'm getting old). It was late, so the gf and I just had a couple drinks and appetizers. Food was really tasty -- fried calamari (my fav) and homemade pita + hummus -- but my Jack and ginger was pretty weak. Will prob stick to the microbrew list next time around.  Gf enjoyed the cucumber martini, said she'd order it again.
2011-08-22,4,A friend and I stopped in for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised.  Had a great hamburger here and would definitely go back if I'm in the area.  The outside patio was full up, as it was a beautiful day, so we sat inside instead.  The atmosphere is totally casual and comfortable.  Thumbs up!
2011-08-20,4,I love Onieals! I live right around the corner, so I've been here many times over the years. The service is always great and the food is awesome. I really like the French onion soup, and their penne vodka is surprisingly good. I recently tried their brunch for the first time and really liked it! I highly recommend Onieals. You won't be disappointed.
2011-06-16,5,Absolutely my favorite restaurant in all of New Jersey.  The atmosphere, the food, the drinks, the staff are absolutely perfect.  And in my 43 years I have never had such good French Onion soup in my life.
2011-06-05,4,Excellent place for an evening rendezvous in Hoboken.  Gorgeous sitting by the park (if you sit outside) and even cozier, if you choose not to.  Friendliest waitresses, who listen and make great suggestions.  Proper good burger with delicious complimentary bread basket.We ordered a burger and pasta - delicious, al dente and perfectly flavored.  The dessert suggestion was fantastic as well.  As was the peach sangria and the mojito.Great, overall.
2011-05-25,5,My favorite bar in Hoboken!  I've gotten to know the staff over the years.  Some have come and gone, others have stayed for a while.  The food is always good.  The Oneials club is pretty legit.  The burgers are yummy and the free wings on Sunday and Monday rock (NFL Season Only).There is dining in the bar area as well as in the back, where you will find a darkish room with 2 windows that overlook Church Square Park.Service is professional and the prices are just right.  Very hip and personable spot.  Check it out if you're in the hood!
2011-04-29,3,Average Pub. Lots of TVs for such a small space.
2011-04-21,5,One of my favorite bars in Hoboken.  They have a lot of great beers on tap, wine specials during the week, and the food is very good.There are also plently of TVs at the bar, the occasional acoustic act, outdoor dining and a quiet dining room in the back.
2011-04-17,5,I am surprised this place is just 4 out of 5 stars.  The food is amazing and the staff seems to be well tenured and super nice.  It's nice to go to a bar and when you sit down the bartender has your drink ready before you order it.  5 stars
2011-03-07,3,Went here for the parade. $20 cover. They had some live music a big crowd, and good staff. I am not a hoboken regular and have a hard time with the 6$ beers. They do have a great selection though. They have chimay on draught, a great bottle selection, and I hear that they have good food. This place is a little off the beaten path, but that actually makes it a little better to me. One of the cool things they have there is a wooden bench going across the whole long wall. Very useful. I did cut my finger on an exposed nail though. ouch. One odder things they do there is shots. They use these small plastic shot glasses and then fill them halfway. I understand a shot is a shot and you are getting the correct amount, but the size of the glass makes is very deceiving. Not terrible, just odd.
2011-02-24,4,I went here last night with a girlfriend for dinner and drinks. We were very impressed with the food. The best part was wine by the glass on Wednesdays is $5! They have a pretty good selection to top it off! I ordered the spaghetti bolognese, it was actually amazing! The portion was huge not to mentiom it was extremely flavorful and overall delicious. I definitely recommend this spot for a romantic dinner or intimate setting.. not such a great spot for large groups since the dining area is small. The service was also pretty good.
2011-02-22,5,A lively and friendly atmosphere in a cozy bar and restaurant.  Across the street is Church Square park, which offers a nice view when sitting indoors, or out on the patio during the warmer months.The menu offers a great selection of beer and fare from brunch to dinner.  The staff and atmosphere have been consistently wonderful.It is a comfortable place to just have a few drinks, watch a game, or just have a nice Sunday brunch.
2011-01-31,4,Very friendly staff. Amazing brunch, burgers and beer list.
2011-01-27,4,It's a nice place. $5 on wines every Wednesday. Be sure to try their hummus dish. We didn't try much else but over all the experience was nice. It's a cozy place, good for dates and groups. Waitstaff was friendly.
2011-01-15,4,I've tried O'niel's for the bar, outdoor seating at brunch, and the restaurant for dinner. All three have been good.The bar is small and intimate. Perfect for a down the street from your doorstep kinda of place. Bartenders are alert and a napkin on a pint still saves your seat here.Brunch is amazing. I can't get  over how good the turkey sandwich with avocado was. Became my favorite turkey sandwich in Hoboken. Perfect mix of turkey, pickles, mayo, avocado,  and toasted rye.Pasta for dinner here has always been good. Nothing over cooked coming out of this kitchen. Also the staff here is very friendly. They have always been kind to requests and don't mind making sure your happy. Always a great spot to stop off at while doing the rounds around Hoboken on a Friday or Saturday night.
2011-01-09,4,I avoided this place for awhile solely because the number of vowels in its name drove me crazy. Is it O'Niels? O'Neals? O'Nieals? Argh!I was glad I got over it, though. The menu here is huge and both times I've dined here I was really happy with my meal. Their veggie burger is made in-house, and all of their burgers can be subbed for the veggie version. Fries are awesome, too. Service in the dining room was very good last time I was here. Even though we were the only ones inside and it was a bit late, the server was really friendly and we weren't rushed at all. The dining room is also decorated stylishly, kind of an Old Hollywood vibe. On the other hand, once when I ate at the bar I was a little put-off. Our bartender finished her shift just after our meals were served. She then sat down beside us with a friend to drink and eat dinner. I still tipped 20%, and understand they probably pool, but I felt a little weird tipping someone who was sitting right next to me like a regular customer. Based on the food, I'll definitely come back to O'Nieaieaieaieal's!
2011-01-04,4,Oh, I just love it here, especially during the holiday season. You can find O'nieals by the pretty tree on the corner of 4th and Park, which is donned in white lights year round. How can you not love that? The vibe here is awesome. It's small, especially tight in the dining area, but not enough to ruin a meal. The food is consistently good and the staff is super friendly. Whether you go for a four-hour brunch with the girls or a romantic dinner with your date, you will not be disappointed. This place has it all - burgers, seafood, pastas, meats. There is a huge selection of delicious food to choose from and the prices are more than reasonable. They serve up great beers and wines and an atmosphere that will make you feel cozy and welcomed. And in the summer, there's outdoor seating right by the pretty white lighted tree :)
2010-12-13,5,You couldn't ask for a more classic American barroom and restaurant. There is a nice atmosphere, punctuated by very friendly and professional staff. The way it sits just off of the park makes it very comfortable for people watching. No wonder people always point out when a place is a "corner bar." There is something about the feng-shui or whatever it might be called.Don't be made to think that there is just great beer and food to be had here, either. The burgers ARE classic and the beers selection is well thought out, to be sure.Yet, for a smaller wine list than you'd find at more expensive spots, there is definitely some attention paid to making the quality shine through on the selections on the list. There are some real gems on the list.Great spot in Hoboken
2010-12-01,3,Went here for a late lunch one Sunday afternoon with a friend.  The first thing that caught our attention was the menu.  Seated in the dining room, in a room to the side of the bar, we debated for quite a while over what to get; everything looked so good.Ultimately, I got the monte cristo sandwich, which was decent.  The fries were tasty - nice and hot.The relaxed atmosphere and fair food made for an enjoyable lunch with a friend.  Although I'd go to Onieals again, I can't say it'd be my first choice.
2010-10-11,5,Gotta love Oniels! It's a great bar, slightly off the beaten path, but totally worth a visit.I've been there twice now for college football Saturdays and I will freely admit that I was there for hours. The crowd is great, but if you wear maize & blue (i.e. blue and gold, i.e. U of M colors) you'd better be prepared to be run out like a skinny kid at fat camp. Much to my chagrin, this place is an Ohio State bar.  On weekends where games can only be seen on the Big 10 Network, this place is packed with red and white wearing Ohio State fans. However, I have to give them major props for being decent and respectable fans. The whole place is great. The bartenders are friendly and remember your name - even if you've only been there once before. The fries are great and the brunch specials on game day are solid. I love hanging out here. As they say, time flies when you're having fun!
2010-09-16,4,A friend that I hadn't seen in 17 years and I stopped in for a little reunion a few weeks ago. You've got my number on Irish bars with bar food. OK, I'm not a real girly girl most of the time but I'm not quite the burping type either!We both ordered burgers and both were very good. Done just the way we asked for them! They have a good variety of beers and the staff was very friendly and attentive. I really enjoyed this place and have to wonder what it's like in the evenings. Looks like I'll need to make another trip to Hoboken soon!
2010-09-07,3,We decided to do brunch a couple weeks ago and opted to go with Onieals. This is a Hoboken standard which everyone should at least enjoy for a Beer and a Burger. We unfortunately waited quite a bit for service ... now I get it, I am a server at not one but two restaurants and I know how it can be. It doesn't make it any better though ... She turned out to be quite nice and prompt the rest of the way. I opted to go with the Eggs Sardeaux and the FIC went with the burger ... both were right on, but nothing that I was doing flips over. This is not to say that I won't be returning, we will but maybe it just wasn't their day. We will be back!
2010-08-13,4,Very relaxed, friendly atmosphere with great staff.  Everything I've had has been fantastic except the Steak Fried Chicken... which was... well... it's Steak Fried Chicken, I don't know what I expected.  The house salad is also delicious, as are the burgers and... everything but the Steak Fried Chicken.  A great place for drinks or a meal, and perhaps the most comfortable outdoor seating in Hoboken short of something on the waterfront.
2010-08-12,4,Go here for dinner and lunch as it is on the same block as I live.  The service is very friendly.  Food is good for a quick fix too.  Great place to get together with friends in laid back environment and to put back a few.
2010-07-29,1,Came here just after noon for lunch.  Received a menu after about 5 minutes then sat for 15 minutes.. no service, no water, no anything.  The restaurant was practically empty too.  I guess filling up condiment containers is more important than serving the customers who have been sitting for 20 minutes.Maybe the food is good but I wouldn't know because the service sucks and we left.
2010-07-10,5,I need to upgrade my review of this place...It's definitely my favorite place in the neighborhood.  The hummus was good second time.  I also tried their grilled shrimp salad which was very, very good.  The waitstaff even came out to give me their wireless password!  I think they were really trying to save me from a neighborhood older gentleman who chats up anyone/everyone though.  Either way, score!  ZERO complaints about O'Nieals!
2010-06-27,4,The definition of a great neighborhood joint!If you are looking for a no frills, relaxed, casual, consistently delicious place to hang out, O'nieals is the place for you.The place is relatively small and doubles in size once the weather is nice enough to open up the outdoor seating.  The bar seems bigger than the dining room, but don't let that throw you off.The best thing about the place is the food.When you read the menu, you think there's no possible way this could be good because there are so many different kinds of food.  From chicken fried steak, to shepherds pie, to crab cakes and penne ala vodka.  Seriously?  Could any one of these dishes be good?Whenever I see a menu like this in a pub, I picture a guy in the back somewhere with a dirty cutting board and microwave heating up things from the freezer.Shockingly, O'nieal's hits every dish out of the park.As a matter of fact, they don't even have a freezer!  Everything is fresh and made to order.We started with the fried mozzarella.  It is actual sliced mozzarella hand breaded and lightly fried over a perfect marinara sauce.  Absolutely delish!  I could have eaten 4 more orders of the stuff.I enjoyed it so much that I ordered fresh mozzarella on my burger.An entire page is dedicated to what they are most know for:  burgers.I went for the spivy burger which is their world famous patty with the addition of a nice fried egg on top.  When you cut into it, the egg is nice and runny, and makes the awesome bun soak up all the goodness.The hand cut fries are dynamite too.On the booze front...It is hard to find a good beer bar that carries a good amount of foreign imports, and also carries the standard domestic fare.Plenty of solid German, Belgian, and other European brews in bottle form, but you can still bring your Miller Light loving buddies here as well.For the ladies, there's an extensive martini list as well.
2010-05-13,5,This is my favorite bar in Hoboken.. It's also the closest bar to my place which doesn't hurt. I've gone here for nice dinners with my family in the dining room and rolled in with a buzz late night after yankees games with friends. Don't believe anyone who tells you Onieals is a hidden gem. To who?!  Try walking in there on a Friday or Saturday night and getting a seat at the bar or standing room for that matter! That is why I usually arrive after 12. The bartenders are always playing great tunes off the computer at the bar and open to download your requests (as long as the song isn't a total mood kill). As mentioned by the other yelpers.. the burgers are great! Stay away from the bacon infused vodka.
2010-04-09,4,Great Burger!! Waitstaff very nice and bartender always playing great music.  Be aware on occasion you will get the drunk downtown baseball hat backward wearing yahoo up in the bar front. So Just go to the dining room or eat outside. :-)
2010-04-03,3,WARNING: This review might be more of a story than a review. Read for your own enjoyment! This week, tragedy struck my apartment. I live with four guys, and more often than not, things get carried away and stuff gets broken. Recently, one of my larger and less graceful roommates (let's call him Moe Mullivan) spilled (and by spilled I mean dumped) a glass of water all over our cable box. While Moe claims it was an accident, the malicious intent I could see in his eyes lead me to believe otherwise. This heinous attack left our apartment separated from the world, which was probably his plan all along. In order rectify the situation, we had to trek into the depths of Hoboken to the optimum online office to replace the busted box. Because it was such a difficult journey, I decided to have a rest stop at Onieals to rest up and recharge. Located across the street from scenic Church Square on the corner of 4th and Park, this restaurant/bar is pretty unassuming without any large or flashy signs on the outside. The interior atmosphere is as relaxed as the exterior, which lends Onieals to be a nice meet up spot. They have a moderately sized bar area and a separate seating area with about 10 tables. Because it is off the main street, there wasn't much of a lunch crowd, which let my guests and I converse comfortably. However, with such a small crowd, I expected the service to be better than it was, but then again, I suppose it added to the relaxed atmosphere. Onieals offers your typical bar food, sandwiches, burgers, etc, but with a larger selection. At about $10 an entrée, I sampled their World Famous Burger, a sandwich, and a vegetarian sandwich between my guests and me. I will reserve me personal feelings for establishments calling their dishes world famous (seriously, who gets to decide that), but their burger was pretty good. It came with all the usual fixings like lettuce, onions, and tomatoes, and a side of fries. The burger was cooked a perfect medium and the meal left me feeling satisfied. My guest had the Church Square Sandwich which was a turkey, guacamole, and Monterey Jack cheese sandwich served with a side of fries. My other guest had the Foccacia Club which was an open faced sandwich that has a variety of grilled vegetables topped with melted mozzarella cheese served with a side of chips. Both felt that the sandwiches were better than your average bar food, which I can certainly agree with. Too many times I lower my standards for bar food because usually you either get a good bar, a good restaurant, or neither. However, Onieals shows me I don't have to settle because bars can make delicious food if they want to. I haven't decided whether I should be thankful that Moe forced us on the Cablevision journey but I did learn two important lessons. First, keep your liquids and electronics separate, and second, never let go of your standards. If only I could get Moe to learn the same lessons and keep him from watching his True Blood and Tool Academy. The Bottom Line: Onieals raises the bar for food. So if you are looking for a bite to eat and a bit to drink, then consider walking down and trying them out.
2010-04-02,3,I got lunch at Onieal's today and sat outside. Service was pretty slow; I kept getting the idea they forgot about us because we were out of sight. Kind of a bummer. The food was average this time. The burger patty was good, but the roll was meh, and the fries were not hot. The veggie quesadilla was good.
2010-04-01,3,A. Small bar area, but chillB. Small outdoor area but good view of the park (when it gets warmer of course)C. Drinks were drinkableD. Food was edibleE. Prices were right in the range that you'd expect a bar to beF. Good enough spot to meet for a 1st date (ahem)G. Bartender was pretty cool and attentiveH. Feels like homeI will hit again.
2010-03-23,4,Very good bloody Mary's. I had the California burger and it was delicious!! French fries were great. I went for brunch, but it definitely looks like a great dive bar.
2010-03-02,5,love this place, anytime when i want to relax and enjoy a pint with some good food and friendly staff.....one of my favorite bars in hoboken (if you want to relax or have a chill night)
2010-02-16,5,Onieal's never lets me down.  After a hideous Valentine's Day  being-taken-advantage-of experience, we needed to restore our faith in the restaurant world.  Onieals was the perfect go-to.  Penne Vodka, French Onion Soup, any of the sandwiches...maybe I should just write down what I don't like since it's all fantastic. The only thing I would say is the meat they serve and that's because I'm a vegetarian.  Pre-veggie days, I remember the chicken and burgers were amazing, so I can't even hate on the carnivores here.  Awesome spot, service and food.
2010-02-10,5,Great food at  bar food prices.  Crab cakes, penne vodka, salads, and buffalo shrimp are delicious.  The brunch is also great.  The eggs benedict are the best I've ever had.  On top of that a good place to watch a game.
2009-12-12,3,Nice bar with pretty good food.  Very extensive menu with a lot of options from typical bar food (wings, nachos, burgers, sandwiches) to a little bit better withsalads, pasta dishes, steaks and seafood. The folks who work their are really friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable.  The dining room is pretty small and it tends to get busy after 7:30, so go earlier if you don't want a wait.It's right next to Church Street Park so it's a great  spot in the summer time for alfresco dining and drinking.
2009-11-01,5,I love o'nieal's - been there about 5 times and have had an amazing experience each time.  The burgers are FABULOUS and they will put almost anything on it that they have on the menu if you ask.  The bar is a great vibe and the bartenders are funny and fast.
2009-10-31,5,Came here for saturday brunch and the food was excellent and inexpensive and the service was great.  Good coffee too.  I had the french toast which was great.  Will definitely keep coming back here.
2009-08-26,1,We went to ONieals after a recommendation from a friend and were expecting a great experience of outdoor dining on a nice summer night with some great ales. Instead, the table we were waiting for was given to a woman who showed up after we did, and we were seated at one of the outside tables on Park Ave side (not on the park side). Big mistake... That whole section is infested with MICE. We were constantly seeing mice approaching our feet, moved to the next table over, and the mice followed. The waitstaff seemed oblivious and unapologetic; we finally moved inside where the air conditioning was so drafty that we almost decided to leave, but stayed on since we had ordered burgers already. The food was average - the fries arrived absolutely cold, my veggie burger was tasteless. No one came back to ask how our meal was. Warning: Eat on Park Ave side outside only if you want to be near mice. I've never been to a restaurant in Hoboken where the waitress tells you "oh, yeah, because the garbage is nearby there are lots of mice in that corner". Will never go back.
2009-08-18,3,Great food, great service, great place. If you are trying to check off all the places worth eating in Hoboken, this place should def be on your list. And after you go, im sure it will turn into a go to spot.
2009-07-19,5,I have been going to Onieal's for almost four years now. We go at least once a month and the place has only gotten better. And this is not a trend you see at other places. The prices are good, the food is great and the service is good. Terrace is nice, next to the park. I love Onieal's.
2009-04-09,4,I love O'Nieals. It's my "go to" pub in Hoboken. They are consistent above all else. The food is always Very good, the beer selection is nice and the service is great. Best bartenders around, in my opinion. The turkey club is always good. The BLT is terrific (i always ask for turkey) - served on fresh bread, i believe it's a sourdough rustic type of bread - delicious! Fresh homemade potato chips....very chill atmosphere...if you're in the mood for chicken, get the Hammered Chicken. The penne vodka is Solid. Great overall place. A classic irish pub, with very quality food. Just check it out!
2009-03-31,4,This place is just a great low-key, chill neighborhood bar.  The waitresses and bartenders are always super friendly.  When it is warm outside, the outdoor seating is very key, especially with the year-round christmas lights hung around the trees outside.Everything on the menu has been consistently good.  Burgers are absolutely great (altho, I personally like Zack's better), but you get a fun mix of different burger types with different toppings (like a pizza).  Perfectly big, juicy, and flavorful on a sesame bun.  Sandwiches are great too - I love the meatball sandwich.  Pasta dishes are good too, especially the chicken parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs are really tasty..The bar area gets packed very quickly for dinner.  There is dining room seating in the back, but I like to eat at our around the bar - or outside.
2009-02-02,4,Pleasantly surprised - you walk in and they have cool bar and restaurant atmosphere. Flipping through the menu, it's seemed like a step up from regular bar fare, but even a couple straight-forward meals like pesto chicken, steak sandwich (w/ Filet) and steak frites were really, really good. Even their chicken soup was awesome.I'd go back and explore more of the menu.
2008-01-23,4,Onieal's was my go-to place when I lived in Hoboken, as it is one of the best restaurants in town.  I first began eating here in the early 90's when I lived around the way.  I ate here at least once a week as a resident, but when I moved into Manhattan I only ate here occasionally.The food is consistently good, the ambiance is warm and inviting, and the menu has a decent variety of items from which to choose.  I definitely recommend you give it a try.   It's highly conducive to good conversation if there is no live music playing.
2008-01-05,5,Super friendly, neighborly service.  Crayons for doodling.  Vegetarian options are pretty slim on the lunch/brunch menu.  But what was available was very good.
2007-07-05,5,yes i agree we should keep this place a secret... it's super chill here, outdoor seating and everything is good about this place...the staff is funny too.  There menu has a little of everything so u will def find what you want.  and for my fellow vegetarians they have like 5 choices for us!
