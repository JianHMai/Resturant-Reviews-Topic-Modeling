2021-09-15,5,Looks like a hole in the wall but OH MY GOD this is the best Italian I've had in Hoboken. Authentic. Not gimmicky. Get the stuffed rigatoni, you will not regret it. Fried calamari was so good. Gnocchi was also fire, with a massive ball of burrata on top, can't go wrong here. I will be back over and over. (Fire desserts also)
2021-09-04,1,Hoboken is filled with incredible restaurants, but this is not one of them. Service was terrible and the food was just as bad. Shrimp was under cooked and for shrimp Parmesan, there was no breading on it. The cavatelli and broccoli was extremely salty and the broccoli was so overcooked that it was not even green anymore. When the waitress asked how it was, my wife said it was very salty and she just said oh and walked away. When we asked if the cavatelli had cheese in it, the owner did not know or offer to go find out and said they just bring it in from somewhere else. The owner just stands at the door and clearly there is no quality control or oversight at this restaurant. All of the employees just don't seem to care, including the owner.The best part about the meal was the wine which we brought and when it was over. We will not be returning.
2021-08-02,3,Came to Café M Friday night for dinner since I had been seeing lots of Instagram stories/posts about the food and I wanted to try.  Its been over a few years since I've ate there.  We got there around 7 pm and they helped add a table outside for us since we brought our dog and every table was taken.  Service was mixed throughout the meal.  Since we were off on the side, we had to really try to track down servers when we needed something. I asked our server what the rice ball special was stuffed with and she candidly replied she had no idea and it was only her second day.  We heard the table behind us send back their salad since it was 'stale.'  We weren't really sure how the meal was going to go after that.   To start, we got the rice balls special.  An order came with two -  Very tasty and came out nice & hot.  Pretty sure they were stuffed with prosciutto but the waitress never confirmed.  For our mains, we ordered the stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce and the chicken cutlet Cacio e Pepe peppe which was a special.  Portions were big.  The cacio e Pepe was a bit dry and overcooked; could've used more sauce.  The rigatoni dish was very rich and tasty.  Plenty of vodka sauce.  We left with leftovers that we haven't ate yet.  My stomach was bothering me after dinner that night, so not sure if it was the food or not.   Overall, it was an average experience.
2021-07-10,2,Rude chef, my order came out wrong because the waiter misunderstood. The chef did not want to fix the order without a fight. He was purposely talking so loud saying "it's her mistake I'm not doing it". To add, we were the only customer in the restaurant. This place is not what it was a few years ago. Very disappointing
2021-07-08,5,Great food. Great service.  The meatballs!!  The gnocchi!!  Everything.   Love this place
2021-04-11,5,Came here with a large group of friends (15 people) and  Cafe Michelina accommodated us family style with incredibly sized portions, amazing food, and perfect service. We ordered appetizers and entrees in advance and everything was perfect, including a gluten free option for one person. Couldn't recommend this place more!!! Love it.
2021-03-28,5,Went here the other night for outdoor dining and loved the food! I will definitely be back to try the other dishes. We started with mussels in spicy sauce and then I chose the stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce while my friend had the lobster ravioli. Would recommend all of them!
2021-03-13,5,This family run restaurant is a "well oiled machine". Food came out in 15 minutes and was delicious. We got the stuffed rigatoni with chicken cutlet and vodka sauce. Amazing. The chicken cutlet was cooked to perfection. We also got the shrimp scampi which tasted like Christmas Eve. The service and food were unbelievable. Enjoyed my conversation with the manager/owner. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes that caught my eyes. A new staple of Hoboken Italian restaurants for me.
2021-03-03,5,Best Authentic Best everything, walk around the corner pick up your favorite bottle of wine, you'll be back in your seat in no time, with everything on the menu, spread out like the last supper, place is a gem, this place is Hoboken's Hall of Fame, last time I couldn't believe how desirable was BILL after all we ate.
2021-02-28,3,The Gnocchi a la Vodka with Burrata was a winner. The Veal Parm with a side of spaghetti was generous portion. The veal was tender the tomato sauce gets high marks. The zucchini sticks appetizer was nothing special and I would not recommend ordering it. I've had better at TGI Friday's.  The bread basket was a disappointment with stale bread and the complimentary Brushetta was soaked in oil.  The big down side was the lack of social distancing.  Keep in mind this is a very small restaurant. The tables were extremely close and every table was full. Overall decent Italian food but not sure I would go back while indoor dining is the only option.
2020-11-08,5,Cafe Michelina is a Hoboken staple! If dining at the restaurant, expect to spend a decent amount of time there as service is not the fastest but it is a great place to hang out with a bring your own bottle. Take out is also always great and is never cold and arrives quickly. They always provide great portion sizes and amazing specials everyday.
2020-09-14,5,Love this place. Where do you find the owner in the kitchen making you dinner this place. Sea food salad banging shrimp scampi delicious.
2020-09-11,3,So there was a long wait for this restaurant which was fine. The food was pretty good and we liked the BYOB aspect. However when the bill came, it had clearly made up prices for the specials that were far more expensive than they should have been. We had to ask what each line item was because they didn't specify which charges were what dish. It felt dishonest and like we were being tak n advantage of.
2020-07-07,5,What a delightful establishment, food was fantastic. Server ( Justine ) could not have been better, nice pleasant attitude, knowledgeable and very promptly served us. Value was phenomenal. Great spot well worth a visit.... esp. in these times
2020-04-26,5,Everything I always get from here comes out great. I recommend the stuffed rigatoni or gnocchi but can't go wrong with anything
2020-04-10,5,Huge shout out to Cafe Michelina for delivering right now and for your delicious food and customer service.
2020-03-29,4,Love the food here! But they could stand to be a little more clean. I got a dirty utensil and my glass wasn't the cleanest either. So it makes me wonder. But the food is great.
2020-03-06,4,Family style Italian that's also BYOB. Service is great and the staff is so charming - you can tell this place is family owned. They have a wide range menu and specials every day. I recommend the chicken parm! The outside and decor on the inside may through you off but the food they make is always delicious.
2019-11-30,5,Never disappoints! Local favorite and owner/chef Pietro makes you feel like part of the family! Delicious sauces and fresh food. Complimentary bruschetta is best I have ever had and fra Diablo sauce is  can't beat byob and great prices. Alex who works there also provided great service!
2019-09-18,2,Not a fan. I'm not sure why a lot of people are raving about the penne alla vodka. I thought it was terrible. I think I've had better sauce from a jar...honestly. Also, the tables have salt and pepper shakers. Who in the world uses pepper shakers anymore? At a minimum, pepper mills should be at every table.Also had the garlic bread. That was marginal, at best. But, in their defense, good garlic bread is actually not as easy to make as people think.
2019-09-13,5,The food here is consistently great. With all of the eating options in Hoboken, this is one of the only places we regularly keep coming back to. Friendly service, warm atmosphere, great food. Highly recommend!
2019-07-28,1,Awful.... went last night with my daughter... ordered shrimp parm.... I got warm shrimp (no breading)with mozzarella thrown on top of it.... who doesn't fry shrimp in a dish called Shrimp Parmigiana!!  Then onto the noise level... large family with at least four screaming kids running around whose parents could care less that there were other diners.....no apologies from the staff.... awful experience!!! No stars!!!
2019-06-28,2,Don't bother...the food is blah and the service is poor. There were 4 tables being used inside and we had to flag down a waiter to take our order. They never asked what we wanted to drink. They brought out our entree and I had to ask about what happened to our appetizer. I finished my plate and none of the waiters retired my plate. Had to flag down again a waiter for the bill.
2019-06-12,5,Cafe Michelina holds a special place in my heart (and I'm sure many others), because it feels like you're literally eating dinner in your nonna's kitchen. You come here for massive portions of delicious and filling Italian comfort foods like Penne Vodka, Chicken Parm, and their house specials like Stuffed Rigatoni. You don't come here for innovative Italian or fancy atmosphere or fine dining. And their vodka sauce is to die for!!! All of their entrees come with a side of pasta and red sauce - do yourself a favor and pay the extra ~$2 to get that with vodka sauce instead. Plus the fact that it's BYOB makes it the perfect Sunday night dinner spot.
2019-05-15,2,Made a reservation for 4 people at 6 pm on Mother's Day. We were running a little late, but they were still able to save our table, which was great because it was also the last table available. Everything started out fine - we brought our own wine, and they brought out the glasses, opened the bottle pretty quickly. Even brought us some complimentary bruschetta. We placed our order - apps and entrees all at once. The calamari did not come out until 40 minutes later. 40 MINUTES! I'm not sure if it was because it was Mother's Day that the service was extremely slow, but judging from some of these other reviews, it seems like that's just the norm here. It wasn't even worth the wait because it was so bland, and it tasted like it was premade or previously frozen.For my entree, I had the penne vodka with chicken ($17.95). I liked it, but I'm not sure if it was worth the price tag. The quality is comparable to pizzeria pasta. BF's dad had some seafood pasta. He wanted to change the sauce to pesto but apparently they don't make that. What kind of Italian restaurant cannot make some pesto?? BF and his mom got two different specials of the night: stuffed rigatoni (?) with chicken (it was unclear if it was stuffed WITH chicken or not, but it actually is just stuffed with cheese and served with chicken), and some chicken dish with mozzarella and spinach, served with penne. We didn't ask how much the specials would be but we probably should have because each of them came out to $24.95. There was definitely a robbery taking place here that night. We still ended up getting dessert since his parents love tiramisu. It was good, but it's nothing I can't buy premade.Bottom line: the price is not worth the quality, and definitely not the slow service.
2019-05-09,5,I loved this place. We waited for long time and ppl were getting in front of us bc of reservations so we were getting a little antsy. My friend had a little confrontation with the waitress which was comical but they redeemed themselves SO WELL. Service recovery A+ The servers were sooo friendly and I didn't mind waiting. Ok so this entree that I ordered... was so freaking good. Please everyone order this one!! Stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce. Amazing. It was like rectangular raviolis perfectly al dente. The sauce was sooo delectable. Not kidding you I scrapped the whole plate with a piece of bread bc I didn't want to lose any of it. This is the one dish I would make a trip to Hoboken for.Also BYOB!? Step it up Maryland.
2019-04-22,5,This is the place in Hoboken we go just about every week. It kind of feels like an extension of our kitchen. In fact, we had our rehearsal dinner here at a big long table. Its BYO, super chill, and consistent. I love when z100 plays softly in the background and instantly, a plate of complimentary bruschetta shows up. The same family is serving and cooking and being lovely every night. Get the antipasto for 2 and the broccoli. Then, get the shrimp fra diavola. Or anything with vodka sauce. Finally, order up "the bomba" or tiramisu for dessert.
2019-04-13,5,I love this restaurant, service is great and their vodka sauce is the best. Servers are very kind and attentive. Tiramisu is very good and so is their cappuccino! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good Italian restaurant with a reasonable price compared to other places in Hoboken!
2019-04-08,5,So I happened to come across this little restaurant with my friends and we loved the experience the food was amazing and will definitely going back I wish I would of known this way a BYOB!! I do know for next time.. Service was ok I wish our guy server would of offered us the specials from us sitting outside not that the girl did bad she was amazing I think they need to let her take tables and let him do the busing but all together everything was amazing definitely will be back!! Next time I should try the gnocchi with the sautéed eggplant but overall this is a nice spot
2019-04-06,5,I have been here several times since moving to Hoboken and I have never had a bad meal! The food is amazing, the staff is very welcoming and the atmosphere is great. We order the stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce every time we come here. Looking forward to my next visit!
2019-04-05,5,Always enjoy a classic Italian mean from Cafe Michelina. It also comes with bruschetta and fresh baked bread which is a perfect starter! Definitely a classic BYOB spot in Hoboken for some good Italian.
2019-04-05,5,Came here with my girlfriend for a casual date night and was blown away by the quality of food for the price. Lauren had AMAZING recommendations...We took 3 of the 4 she recommended and wish we took the 4th!  Definitely stick to the specials board if you are willing and that homemade tiramisu.....DELICIOUSGreat spot for some quality Italian food. Cozy and homey feel. Just get there before 8:15 pm on a weekend because that is when it starts filling up.
2019-04-02,4,Loved my penne vodka with salmon and loved enjoying it outside with a bottle of wine. And the portion size was so generous I loved the left overs almost as much the next night.I can't say enough good things about this dish. It was on the specials list and I am so happy I saw it scribbled on a board by the window last minute, otherwise I would be writing about the penne vodka with chicken and I don't think I'd be as passionate. The sauce was perfect, not too heavy. The salmon was cooked just right and still had it's own flavor, it wasn't lost in the vodka sauce. And the pasta was just as al dente as I'd ever want it to be. I'd get it again in a heartbeat. It was one of the first eat-outside days we had and I didn't want to squander it, so we were on the hunt for a place with outdoor seating. This was was recommended to us and I am so happy we finally gave them a try. Service was very friendly, quick and attentive. We were the only ones eating outside, but they never forgot about us and checked on us just regularly enough. We brought our own wine, and had an amazing casual dinner. I'd definitely come again.
2019-03-30,1,This was my second visit and will be my last. Service is absolutely garbage. We had a large party with everyone seated and menus closed. People continued to be seated and get there orders taken. We just sat and waited. We continued to ask if we had a waiter/waitress and no one would give us the time of day. After 45 minutes we finally got the attention of someone and they brushed us off and didn't give us the time of day! How does this even happen in such a small restaurant.  Embarrassing that we even wasted our time picking this place and shame on the management. The food is good, but you could get the same Italian food anywhere else in NJ, no point in coming to this mayhem.
2019-03-09,4,Googled best Italian restaurant in Hoboken and this came up as top 10. After reading the reviews I knew I needed to order anything that had vodka sauce!When you walk in, feels like you are in your grandmas dinning area. The fresh bread aroma welcomes you. Very much has that home feel, old school curtains, small intimate tables, grandmas decor and Italian food aroma! Very much a whole in the wall, on the corner, hidden gem!It was a very busy night, lots of birthday celebrations and even had priests sitting across from us. This place was a good pick. Didn't know but you can BYOB which everyone did except my table and the priest table lol!Bruschetta is delivered to the table along with a basket of bread. We decided to try the specials and share. We ordered  the chicken w/ spinach, mozzarella with tomatoes penne pasta with lemon sauce so good! The mozzarella was perfectly melted over the pasta. We ordered the fettuccine, cheese ravioli and stuffed chicken rigatoni with vodka sauce! Everything tasted wonderful and we all enjoyed our meal. BYOB is a must! No wine list offered but they do have a liquor store near by.
2018-12-21,5,The penne vodka was some of the best that I've had in years. A friend recommended I try Cafe Michelina and I'm so happy that I did. The sauce was flavorful but not too heavy, and the pasta was perfectly cooked. This is my new go to Italian restaurant in Hoboken. Highly suggest giving it a try!
2018-07-28,1,Food is basic at best, no flavor what so ever, bland or tastes like it's reheated from frozen. Service is okay but the waitress was kind of intense and seemed extremely frustrated, seemed to make up her own rules about almost everything. Won't be back.
2018-07-27,5,Finally made my way back to Cafe Michelina since moving back to Hoboken 3 years ago and it has been way too long. The food was phenomenal, we got the stuffed rigatoni vodka with chicken, mussels diavlo. and rigatoni bolognese. The staff were so sweet and very attentive. I left my credit card with the receipt and they went out of their way to run me down in the rain a half block away.  Will definitely be back soon. It's also BYOB Which is a huge plus.
2018-07-09,5,This is by far our favorite Italian food restaurant.   Anywhere.   We had the penne vodka with chicken on Saturday night and it was incredible.  It's not fancy, but the food -- OMG.  The owner is a great guy.   We will keep coming back.
2018-06-24,4,This place is good!  If you're like me you want a cheesy good experience in a place like this and it delivers.  The meatballs make my home made ones seem like garbage.  The gnocchi special is delicious.  If you're in the area go- you won't be disappointed with the prices or the meal.  BYOB is an extra plus.
2018-06-09,5,We love Cafe Michelina. The food is great and the service is excellent. The broccoli salad is perfectly done and amazingly tasty, even my kids love to eat it, especially with lemon they provide. The rigatoni with meat sauce, fettuccine alfredo and primavera, ravioli, pollo alla Michelina with mushrooms, all favorites. Can't beat that it's a BYO. We keep coming back.
2018-06-03,4,Great experience overall. Our service was excellent.  They were personable, witty and informative about the menu.  Our calamari was only rings which is great. Our pasta portions were so big we were able to have them as a second meal when we got home. The only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is because their drink menu is limited. Since it's byo they only really have soft drinks and water (no cranberry or oj to quench your thirst). We will be back for sure!
2018-05-06,1,Do not order for delivery and expect anywhere near the quality of food or service you get when dining at the restaurant. Our order from Delivery.com was missing the $5 worth of chicken we added to one of the two dishes. That same dish,  Tortellini alla Michelinas, looked terrible compared to what we've been served before. The cream sauce was watery and the "finely chopped ham" resembled a slice of deli meat cut in thirds. When we called to let the restaurant know about the missing chicken and the quality of the dish, they blamed the missing item on a bad printer and directed us to call Delivery.com to get our $5 back. After that we gave feedback about how poor the dish looked and they tried to blame their third-party delivery service saying maybe they took too long to pick it up or deliver it - but the order actually came relatively quickly, less than 30mins in total. They had nothing to say, made no offer to send the chicken or make us a new dish, nothing. I then asked if perhaps they were missing ingredients for the dish tonight and was told that wasn't the case. That gentlemen also went on to say that they make the dish the same way every time. So, if this is the quality of their food and the way they treat customers now, then I recommend folks avoid them at all costs. Since there was not any attempt to apologize or correct our meal, I promised to leave this review with pictures. You're welcome.
2018-05-02,5,Love this place! It's not fancy but the food is always great, always hot, and the service is always good. Plus the portions are generous. My husband and I eat here often, it's our local go to Italian place. He orders chicken parm with extra sauce every time and swears by it. I tend to go with weekly specials.
2018-03-30,3,We have visited Cafe Michelina a bunch of times for many years BUT this visit was not a good showing! We were very disappointed! The wait staff seemed more involved with their own conversations instead of taking care of tables! The chicken parm was terrible! Lack of sauce and a thin piece of crappy fried chicken!! Not sure if this was an off night but come on guys! Better step it up for next time! You guys are an amazing restaurant! KeepIt that way
2018-03-17,1,Slow service. The Caesar salad was disgusting. Soaking wet with water and barely any dressing. Stuffed rigatoni was ok but the chicken it cake with was rubbery and sticky. Vodka sauce was very bland. They also got my friend's order wrong and tried to convince her to eat it anyway. On top of being overpriced they overbilled on the salad. I will say the portions were large but I threw out half my meal anyway since it was so bad. Not going back.
2018-03-17,5,This place is a little gem tucked into the heart of Hoboken!They might serve some of the best vodka sauce I've had.  It has a perfect balance of consistency and flavor.  Its BYOB and they have outdoor seating, which are definitely positives.To top it all off, the staff is super friendly (one of the best I've experienced in town) and will customize the order exactly the way you want it.This is a must-try!
2018-02-23,5,This place is a hidden gem in Hoboken!  The penne vodka, chicken portobello in Marsala sauce and the eggplant Parmesan were all fabulous!  The food was delicious and the ambiance was casual and comfortable. The staff were attentive and the service was great!  I can't wait to go back!
2018-02-23,4,They had me at eggplant parmigiana in the reviews and it didn't disappoint. Solid four stars. The service was attentive and the complimentary bruschetta had a nice oil flavor. The spaghetti is very thin like angel hair which is also a personal fave.
2018-02-20,5,Have been coming here for years and enjoyed consistently good food. Portions are generous. Nice family run business. Pietro's chicken parm is magical. BYOB is a plus!
2018-01-19,5,This place is incredible, old school environment, delicious food at reasonable prices... BYO wine. What more can you ask for. Love this place!
2018-01-07,5,The best Italian food in Hoboken..Always Great!!!!!Delivery is prompt and same flavor....Love the Eggplant!!
2017-12-20,1,Update to my previous review: My family of 5 and I dined here again this week. We generally come here 1-2 times per month. I've got to say, after this week's visit, we will not be returning. The food as always was fine. And as per usual, we felt extremely rushed. We were the ONLY party in the entire restaurant; not one other person. We placed our order and once again our entrees hit the table before we finished the appetizer. We had not one but two servers constantly hovering around our table taking plates the moment we finished the last bite. I'm talking the second you finish your bread, they're pulling the bread plate away. It is so ridiculous and uncomfortable. They were asking if we wanted to wrap food to go before we even finished eating! Literally. We could hardly have a conversation because someone was at the table every minute... that is until the check came. Once the check was dropped, both servers hovered in the back of the restaurant. We added 20% gratutity, signed the receipt, only to then realize something wasn't adding up. BE MINDFUL OF THIS: They staple TWO receipts to your order. On the BACK of the order form, the waitress calculated her own twenty percent tip and added that to the top receipt's total. The second receipt has the total before gratuity. NOWHERE on any receipt will you see the word 'tip' or 'gratuity.' One server came by, not our main one, and we asked her if the tip was included. She explained that the tip was calculated and included and we could find that on the BACK of the order and that tip was included for parties of five or more (I've never seen this for less than 6 people). VERY SNEAKY. From here on out, our main waitress stayed in the kitchen until we left. She never came by to ask how our meal was, ask if we needed anything, NOTHING. The moment we left, literally as we crossed the street, we saw her walk to our table. Luckily we caught this before we handed back the check with an extra 20% tacked on top of her already included gratuity. Not to mention, prices on the receipt do not list which food item it's for and these prices do not match the menu. There are about a dozen awesome Italian restaurant in Hoboken I can think of off the top of my head. Visit literally any one of those before coming here. Very sneaky way of doing business and I can't imagine how many people must trip an extra 20% not realizing it's already included .
2017-11-24,5,This is the BEST place to go to in Hoboken! It's a little gem that is hidden on the corner, but you feel like family right when you walk in. It's like eating at Nona's! They food is amazing, the service is phenomenal and the prices are reasonable. They accommodate larger parties too! It's BYOB, so feel free to bring in whatever you need.
2017-11-18,4,We had dinner at Cafe Michelina on a busy Friday night in November and had the Stuffed Rigatoni and Chicken and the Veal Carozza, which was a combination of veal and eggplant parmesan. Both were very good. The food isn't going to blow you away here but we like Michelina for its casual atmosphere, decent food, large portions and the fact that its BYO. And on that note, I would like to remind the PATRONS of a simple BYO rule: WHEN YOU FINISH DINNER, PLEASE CLEAR YOUR TABLE!  DO NOT LINGER OVER THE BOTTLE OF WINE THAT YOU BROUGHT!  If you wish to stay and occupy a table on a busy night, then order coffee or dessert. It is just rude and unfair to the servers to camp out and finish a wine that the restaurant did not sell to you. Turning tables is how the restaurant and servers earn their living.It was unbelievable. This couple of women had finished dinner and occupied a four-top the entire time we were at Michelina, lingering over their 1.5 Liter bottle of Yellow Tail (ugh!). Meanwhile, there was a line of at least 6 people waiting for a table. They didn't take the hint when the server repeatedly came back for the check. Come on people!
2017-09-10,1,Unbelievable. I just ordered $50 worth of delivery from this place and the $11 Caesar salad came as just a bowl of soggy lettuce- no croutons and no Parmesan cheese. How hard is it to make a Caesar salad- it only has 3 ingredients? I called to tell them figuring they would offer to fix their mistake--that's a pricey bowl of soggy lettuce--and was told by the manager too bad, you got the salad we're not refunding it, and when I protested he hung up on me. I said it cost you 2 cents to make this salad and I didn't get what I paid for, and the manager, Vinny, said so what, croutons cost 25 cents, do you want a 25 cent refund? If I owned this place I would be outraged that my employees are treating customers this way- just horrible customer service. Hope the $11 was worth losing a customer and getting a bad review.
2017-08-28,1,Food is way too garlicky - you can't taste the actual food since the garlic overpowers the entire meal. Also, they charge a $2 delivery fee that was undisclosed on the online menu. When I called and spoke to the manager about this, he said every place in Hoboken charges that fee. I named several restaurants that don't charge that fee, including Margheritas, my favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken.
2017-08-28,5,One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Hoboken!Great prices.Opens late.Good taste.Good quality.Fast service.I've been here twice. I tried different pasta dishes and dessert. They've been consistently great!I will definitely go here again
2017-08-28,4,Italian BYOB that has great prices. My roommate and I came here for dinner, ordered 2 entrees and an appetizer and only paid 25 bucks each. Highly suggest this place if you are looking for good Italian food. My only downside of this place is I felt rushed. We had to place our an entire order when we were ordering. Our entrees came out on top of our appetizers
2017-08-01,2,Went here this past weekend for a friends birthday and the food was just average, nothing special about this place. We arrived by 7pm and the restaurant was completely empty and since it is a small place the staff was just sitting in the dining area eating. Not to mention in the entry door there are beads hanging down, should have known it was gonna be bad just from seeing that. Now don't get me wrong the food was edible but I wouldn't be seen going back. I had the stuffed rigatoni with chicken and it was absolutely bland. I had to add chili flakes and salt to the dish, and I never do that to any of my meals with vodka sauce. It was way too sweet and that sauce shouldn't taste like that in my opinion.
2017-07-17,5,I was in here Friday night and it was such a great experience a true "italian" ambience great staff excellent food. The owner and son talk italian and came out of the kitchen to greet us.  I highly recomend this resteraunt will be back.
2017-07-15,2,We have been regular customers of Cafe Michelina over the past two years. I can honestly say that we eat here or order about once a month. In the past few times pickup and delivery service has much to be desired... today will be the last delivery we will order from Café Michelina after we received our favorite dish (here), the Chicken Michelina with penne. We both ordered the same dish and combined both dishes had leas than 25 pieces of penne. And also, when someone delivers your food, in my book 10% is sufficient as a tip and the guy rolled his eyes.... so we are now cooking extra penny to supplement this expensive experience. :(. I wish I could post a picture along with my review, but you should see the picture itself in another post that I put up there.
2017-06-16,5,Great staff! Great food! Super fast service. Lobster raviolis are great - so was the chicken parm and burrata appetizer. Definitely recommend! We're fans :)
2017-06-13,4,Amazing food! I've never ordered anything I didn't like here... and an extra plus that it's BYOB. The décor could be updated, but it does add to its charm. I've eaten in with large and small groups, and also ordered take-out and am never disappointed. Definitely recommend!
2017-05-23,1,Do not go there! Got a gift card for my birthday in September last year in 2016 and did not have a chance to come before 2017- they did not accept it! No customer focus. Run, run, run!!!!
2017-04-28,5,Cafe Michelina is my go-to Hoboken restaurant. As many restaurants as there are in Hoboken, I always somehow find myself back here! My family is very simple and this no frills restaurant is perfect for that. They give you bruschetta and bread to start which I think is generous. Every member of the staff I've encountered has been so nice. I'm obsessed with their vodka sauce and the staff/chefs always let me change some of the menu items...I usually get the chicken parm with the vodka sauce which is topped with fresh mozzarella cheese (YUM). I would recommend Cafe Michelina to anyone who is looking for a low-key Italian dinner with family and/or friends. You will enjoy the food, staff, and any drinks you bring...it's BYOB!
2017-04-01,4,I was skeptical at first because it looked like a  simple dining room , but I have to say , the food was great , the prices were ok and the attention was ok as well. I will come back again
2017-03-15,5,This place is the truth. A classic red sauce Italian joint with a casual atmosphere. BYOB, friendly pricing, great food; if I could go 6 stars I would.
2017-02-08,4,Went to Cafe Michelina with my family and had a great dinner. The menu is simple, and it is accompanied by a great variety of specials. Everything was delicious. The veal was very tender and flavorful. The seating was tight, but expected. I would definitely go back again.
2017-01-27,3,The food is amazing...like phenomenal! (Great for take-out.) The decor inside is absolutely atrocious. PLEASE redecorate this place!!! It's truly hideous. I would eat here all the time if the atmosphere was nicer. The chairs are awful, the paint color is bad, the dying plant needs to go, and the photos on the wall are totally random. The outside also looks like an abandoned building. I prefer Margherita's not for the food, but the vibe is so much warmer and welcoming.
2017-01-21,5,If you're looking for a no frills, traditional great tasting Italian restaurant-- stop looking! I've been coming here for almost a decade on the referral of a previous Hoboken lifetimer. You really can't beat BYOB, right?! Whenever I have a friend visiting who I want to show off Frank Sinatra's hometown Italian food to, we come here. The antipasto for two is enough to feed 3 girls (plus some) and I cannot say no to a plate of their stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce. Also delicious: fried calamari, chicken piccata, fettuccine... basically everything. Worth mentioning there's always a complimentary plate of bruschetta and a basket of bread and butter. I've walked in here on both weekday and weekend nights sans reservation, and there is either no wait or a tiny one. By no means is this place empty - but there's always a seat for you! And the waiters never rush you out either. I will be coming here for a lifetime. Ps- don't forget to look up for their specials board. You might miss something good not on the menu!
2017-01-17,4,good, simple, hearty italian food. very reasonably priced. portions are big so bring an extra stomach. it's byob, so, you know, byob.
2016-11-03,4,Great date night spot or place to go out with a bunch of gfs.   Added bonus that it is byob! My favorites here are the penne vodka with shrimp and the stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce! Both very good..... And an added bonus that the service is good even on a busy night!
2016-09-21,5,Delicious authentic Italian food for a very reasonable price. Best Italian food in hoboken
2016-09-10,5,Delicious italian food, i visit this place every couple of months, it is a very nice place, calm and great food.Bring your own wine with you.I always have fettuccine with chicken, it is very good.The coke refill is not for free, which is not good.
2016-09-10,4,This is good old time traditional southern Italian cooking. Tastes like my nonnas food. I got the stuffed rigatoni and vodka sauce special, clearly a crowd favorite judging by the other review here. It did not disappoint. I also got the rice ball. I know it's legit when there are both Meat and peas inside, a real Sicilian piece. My only problem was I felt it was a little too expensive. I know it's Hoboken and things tend to be a little more here, but you usually pay for ambience or a little flair. This place doesn't really have either so I thought the cost would be a few dollars cheaper. That being said, food was really good and I'll probably be back many times. FYI it's byob.
2016-08-20,3,Had their shrimp scampi... Just okay. I've been on the hunt for good scampi since a local family owned restaurant near me closed shop. The hunt continues...
2016-07-15,5,I had heard great things about this place from my friend.  Stopped in here randomly one night and had a fantastic meal.  Can't wait to go back for some grub soon.  Although I'm going on my Honeymoon in a few weeks to Italy I'll have to see how it compares when I get back.
2016-06-23,5,I fly 3000 miles to NY every year and this is the first place I come after landing.  Consistent for decades!!!
2016-06-03,5,I'm writing an article that involves trying several lobster dishes in Hoboken. Tonight (a Friday) I just happened to have absolutely NO ONE to go to dinner with, so I flew solo. I was greeted by Joe and seated outside. Service was awesome -- not just from Joe, but I noticed the rest of the staff was very attentive and friendly as well. I came for one thing: the lobster ravioli. I didn't realize the restaurant was BYO, so Joe gladly poured me a nice glass of red wine. I was also given bruschetta (AMAZING) and additional bread. The lobster rav was delicious! Not only that, but Joe insisted I try the house tiramisu...absolutely INCREDIBLE. A must-have. Wow. I didn't know how good this place would be but I will definitely be going back (with friends...and a bottle or three of wine). It's very casual and tables are pretty loud with people having a good time, but nothing obnoxious. I saw families with children, dates, and friends getting together. Seems like a solid spot for everyone. So happy I live just a short walk away!
2016-05-17,5,This tiramisu knocked my socks off. Yeah, yeah the shrimp scampi, penne vodka, and bruschetta were delicious and the BYOB policy was rewarding. Whatever. THIS. TIRAMISU.
2016-05-17,5,We came here when it was empty and it was truly spectacular. We ordered the penne vodka and shrimp scampi. Both were fantastic: the shrimp scampi was absolutely amazing as was the penne vodka. The pasta was ideally cooked. They also give you a piece of bruschetta which was great. We also ordered their tiramisu and it was by far the best tiramisu I have ever had. Overall, I would recommend this to everyone.
2016-04-23,5,Love this place. My BF and I go here for casual date night all the time, Great that it is BYOB. Love the mussels and vodka sauce. Great family joint with a casual feel.
2016-03-14,4,Great little Italian place right off of Washington Street. Food is authentic- really feels like the place has been here for years and years. Everything is inexpensive and delicious, and it's BYOB, which is always nice. I'll be coming back!
2016-03-06,5,I finally tried this place and I will be back a lot! They give bruschetta for the table to start which was really good.  My table ordered calamari and a Caprese Salad for apps.  Both of them were delicious.  The BEST part of the dinner was the stuffed rigatoni with chicken and vodka sauce.  Everything was fresh.  I can't wait to go back and have more:) BTW its BYOB, which is always a plus!
2016-02-23,5,Firstly, this is one of very few places that took a reservation on Valentine's Day weekend - and we had no issues with it when we arrived! We were greeted with complimentary glasses of champagne, had an amazing meal, and I was sent off with a beautiful complimentary rose at the end of our dining experience. The food was excellent; I chose a dish off of their specials menu, and it turned out great. Everything was very fairly priced too. I would highly recommend this restaurant!
2016-02-01,5,Old style italian kitchen!If you are looking for italian food that's tastes homemade, this is the place to be. I  really am obsessed with the chicken parm and the zuppa de peschi !The service is pretty good and the food quality is always consistent. I haven't tried tried their appetizers, but the dinner entrees are really good. You do not want to go here if you are looking for a romantic five star atmosphere. It's more casual and laid back. They usually serve you brushetta before dinner and some bread. My only complaint would be that their bread is not warmed up.Anyways I love cafe michelina. I come here at least once a month!!OH AND IT'S BYOB!
2016-01-21,4,I loved this place! we went for new years with a group of 4 girls and lots of champers!The food was so fresh and rustic. Not a super pretty place, but you feel like you are at a friends house It is tight in here! be ready to ask your neighbor for a bite lolI think its romantic in here, I would go back for a date. I like places that are off the stripI had angel hair and shrimp so goodthe salad and veggies on the side were great too!
2016-01-16,1,I don't write Yelp reviews but this place blows and the world needs to know.The $17 lobster ravioli had 5 small raviolis...5. After my date and I had finished eating, the check was right on the table before we were asked if we wanted anything else. Then the staff asked about 5 times if we were ready to go and we were basically pushed out of the restaurant. I'll never go here again and don't recommend it to anyone.
2016-01-11,1,I very rarely give 1 star reviews, but this place has incredibly poor service.  I came here with my family for a Sunday dinner, and we ended up leaving after about 25 minutes of sitting there without any service.  I can't even remember the last time that has happened.  One woman (I'm assuming a server) threw down silverware in the middle of the table (without even placing it anywhere) and didn't say a word, and no one came back during the 25 minutes.  I don't even know if they realized we left, as we couldn't get anyone's attention, even though the place was completely empty.  We could see several people in the kitchen arguing about something, but they never came back out to our table.  Very strange, and disappointing since I was looking forward to a good Italian meal.
2016-01-09,3,Went with a party of 4 on Friday night at 7:15pm. We waited only 10 minutes to sit. We couldn't order an appetizer before knowing what we wanted for our entrees, which was a little strange. We finally ordered and weren't even able to finish the appetizer before the entrees came out. They rushed to clear our appetizer plate (which wasn't even finished). The food was pretty good. Two of us liked our meals, but the others thought their meals were just ok. We also ordered a dessert, tiramisu, which was great. But the waiter brought out the check and checked if we put a credit card in it 3 times!!! It was absolutely ridiculous to be that rushed. We will definitely not be coming back on a weekend...and it won't be at the top of our list to return for sure.
2016-01-08,1,This place was OK a couple of years back. No more! Noise level incredibly high, overly crowded, tables so close that waiters had to squeeze through. Although food came out quickly, they were looking to clear the tables quickly, too. They actually brought out the check before they served our coffee. Being rushed sucks! Limited and terribly boring menu, but that's the good news because the food was not even mediocre. You can get better marinara sauce on sale at Shop Rite. Chicken Parm should be a slam dunk at a family-run Italian restaurant, but they bounced it off the back rim for no points. It was bland and skimpy and the penne that came with it was under-cooked. At least the prices were cheap but that money would be better spent almost anywhere else. Molto brutto!
2015-11-28,1,Food was good enough and BYOB is always a plus.  But whoa, the service...among the worst I've ever had.  Took forever for server to come, never asked if we wanted drinks (had two children with us), couldn't melt mozzarella cheese on a kids penne  because they didn't have that kind of cheese (what?), and the worst was they left a glass of water with broken glass in it on our table and didn't apologize when I asked that they remove it.  Basically server had a terrible attitude throughout entire meal...actually wasn't even sure we had a server.  Made for a happy 81th birthday for my dad :( which was why we were there.  No amount of mediocre food would make me sit through such lousy service again.  He added a 20% tip (handwritten in, not on official register receipt, seemed quite dishonest but said it was because we were a party of five) ..I asked that it be taken off.  First time ever in my life I barely left a tip- I am usually a 20+% tipper.
2015-10-14,4,Came here for my niece's 25th birthday celebration dinner. We ordered some appetizers (tomato and mozz; calamari; bruschetta) which went away waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy too quickly because it was so delicious!!! We (a table of 12 - including 3 children) proceeded to order our meals. My husband had a pasta with a spicy marinara sauce and seafood which he loved. I had penne vodka because I'm really predictable and that's always what I want to have anywhere I go! It did not disappoint. The rest of my family (my father with his salmon and mother with her chicken) were not disappointed at all. My dad is a very typical old Colombian dude who needs some red meat, red beans, rice and a salad in his life or he is not satisfied. He actually really enjoyed this place and asked to go back! That's saying a lot! Did I mention the best thing about this place???? No? Well, here you go - IT'S A BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE BYOB!!!!!  Go to Café Michelina but make sure you go hungry and enjoy!!! Can't wait to go back!
2015-10-09,4,This is my go to spot whenever I am in Hoboken and am hungry for good quality Italian food.  The servers show great hospitality, the food is excellent. They give generous portions with out breaking the bank.  Another big plus is it's BYOB!  Yup, I'll be coming back
2015-09-28,5,This is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant. You're guaranteed a delicious and authentic Italian meal from Cafe Michelina. The food is amazing, prices are reasonable and the staff is fantastic. Highly recommend a trip to Cafe Michelina!
2015-09-27,5,This place is adorable! Me and a friend came to Hoboken for a day trip fromPhilly and we wanted to stop for a quick dinner before heading home. Who I think was the owner was so personable, offered us wine since we didn't have any (this is a byo) and was so friendly! Good was quick and so good! Thank you!
2015-09-26,3,Nice hole in the wall mom and pop Italian restaurant. We were able to walk-in on a Friday night and land a table for two but the place packed up quickly. It's BYO but they will provide glasses and free corking. The served standard bruschetta and bread prior to the meal. I had the Chicken alla Murphy and the wife had penne arrabiata. The chicken was very good, cooked in a white wine sauce with hot peppers and mushrooms and garlic there flavor was delicious. The arrabiata was spicy but plain. The overall price was pretty reasonable and the service was warm. They have specials which are on the board and weren't mentioned by our waiter which was a shame nor did they really talk about their deserts which the board said were homemade. Would like to come back some day although not in a rush.
2015-09-20,4,Went here for a large group dinner and really enjoyed the food. I had the lobster ravioli which was really good, especially since the lobster meat was. Overall a nice place to have a meal whether it's a large gathering or a small gathering. Totally worth the trip from the other side of the Hudson River.
2015-08-28,5,I went with a large group and had a blast!!!! BYOB and OMG the food.....absolutely delish from  the apps to the dinner everything was sooo good that I didn't even take any pics (that's pretty shocking for me) we all just started eating from min we sat down to min we left.  Small, homely, welcoming, Staff was friendly and owner was so sweet.  Def go and try this spot!!!!!
2015-08-23,5,One of the best places to eat Italian food in Hoboken. Came here last night with a buddy and we were very impressed with the food. Chef is quite young, but he knows what he's doing. Don't expect a 5 star restaurant plating when the food comes out. But do expect absolutely delicious no frills Italian food. You sit down and they serve you a piece of bread with bruschetta, and a loaf of warm bread with butter to start off with. We first ordered Rice Balls, perfectly crispy on the outside.. One of the best I've ever had. Inside was your peas and risotto but they also had some ground beef which was a nice touch. The marinara they served with it was a little sweet and perfect, like real sauce. Absolutely delicious. I got one of the specials which was stuffed rigatoni with chicken and vodka sauce. Nothing but great things to say. Absolutely amazing. Sauce was on point, the chicken cooked perfectly, and the rigatoni was cooked just right and not soggy. For dessert I had the cannoli. I wanted to try to the tiramisu, but it's been so long that I've had a good cannoli. Glad I ordered it.. Again.. Very good you'd be surprised how many places can mess it up.. But they didn't. I would say it would've been nice to add some chocolate chips on it or maybe even a sprinkle of powdered sugar, but like I said.. Don't expect presentation. Expect good quality food. So in the end, good quality food is what i got from CM, and that's what you should expect when you go. I don't know about delivery, but good like this.. So much better when it's fresh.
2015-07-17,1,Um no way never again. So bad. First and last time eating food from here. $14 for a plate of penne with vodka sauce WITHOUT chicken that's not even good? At least give me more sauce than a thin coat even if it's flavorless. I just don't know how you mess up pasta but they managed to do it..
2015-07-14,5,Excellent Chicken dishes.  I had the chicken parm and I can honestly say it's one of the best in Hoboken.  The red sauce is delicious and the portions are just right.  The staff is friendly and the service is fast.  We will definitely be ordering from here a lot too in the future.
2015-07-01,4,Good food and sizable portions! I've been here a couple times and i've left content each time. As most places in hoboken, this place is BYOB (fyi - liquor store is around the corner by 7/11). Personally i think the big reason which makes me keep coming back here is the complimentary bruschetta and great service that goes along with it.
2015-05-25,5,The service was fast. Everything we ate was delicious & fresh. From the lobster ravioli, eggplant & penne vodka. BYOB
2015-05-13,4,I went to Cafe Michelina with my family for the first time this past weekend. I was very happy with both the food and service. They had some great specials, including meatballs, fried ravioli and fried zucchini. The meatballs were especially good. For my main course, I went with old reliable Chicken Parmesan and I asked for vegetables instead of pasta. Despite the very large portion, I somehow managed to clean my plate so that definitely means they passed the test! The restaurant can best be described as casual and comfy -- not a scene if you're looking for something more trendy. It's more of a family establishment with good old-fashioned Italian food.
2015-05-01,4,Waitresses are amazing!  I am allergic to raw vegetables and the waitress was extremely understanding and made sure she went right to the cook to tell him that I am allergic and asked me a couple times if it was ok.  I had a pasta dish with garlic butter and broc - it was delicious!  We were the last ones to leave and I did not feel like they were rushing us out.  It's a BYOB which is amazing!!! Extremely cute restaurant - can't wait to go back and eat outside!
2015-04-27,3,Sat outside 2 weeks ago for dinner on a Friday evening - service was good and the food wasn't bad - just didn't wow me.The Penne A La Vodka a friend got was pretty good, another got a salad which said was good.  I had the eggplant parm which was OK - wasn't quite hot but was edible.Maybe it was an off night for them - not sure - I will give them another shot in the future.
2015-04-26,4,When I was young, Café Michelina's was a staple. It was our Italian spot like Mario's was our pizza spot. It is there I grew to love creamy pesto, and that I will never forget.Until, we forgot about Michelina's. My boyfriend and I remembered it one Monday.  Our usual Italian place is closed on Mondays and I was craving a big bowl of non-intimidating pasta. So we went.It was practically empty, which I understand as it was Monday and relatively early. The staff showed no shortage of friendliness and openness to accommodating their guests. They even suggested some delicious concoction on the menu to appease my craving. The menu is what you would expect of an old-school Italian restaurant and so is the amicable atmosphere. The food was simple and delicious, hearty and heard-felt; it was exactly what I was looking for. Each round crab and lobster ravioli was smothered in creamy vodka sauce, while the penne was coated in fragrant and flavorful pesto and the chicken cutlet was just right. Michelina's is perfect for a low-key carb-heavy dinner and excellent, friendly service. Oh yeah... and the tiramisu is super delicious. I'll be back.
2015-03-20,4,Solid spot in town and great value.  Big fan of delivery from here.  The stuffed rigatoni with chicken in a vodka sauce is a personal favorite.  Great Lobster Ravioli as well.For dining in it is good but gets crowded quick, like many places in Hoboken space is limited.  BYOB
2015-03-02,3,This place is OK.  I can only review and comment on their take out food only  (delivered through a third party - Delivery.com) and I wasn't impressed. My boyfriend and I ordered Chicken Francese and Chicken Parm entrees and a side of garlic bread.Garlic Bread - HUGE portion literally a whole long Italian roll of bread. Very garlicky (in a good way, cause I love garlic).Chicken Francese - Just blah for me. It comes with a pasta - NO VEGGIES?! What the heck. I made a comment on the delivery order  in the "notes" section asking for veggies instead of pasta and when I received my order...NO VEGGIES. Not only does this not come with veggies, they wouldn't even substitute pasta for veggies. Usually restaurants include veggies in the entree so I was unhappily surprised.Chicken Parm - pretty good. Thin pieces of chicken cutlet, really good tomato sauce, fresh mozz on top of spaghetti.  I would get this again.The food was good, I'd like to try dining in at this place to see how it is on premises.
2015-01-28,3,Solid, tasty, well priced non greasy Italian American food! I really loved the chicken mushroom with white wine and lemon based sauce: very flavorful and delightfully light! I would come again just to have this! Byob.Lovely ambiance (we ate during the end of summer outside). Warm, hospitable, and prompt service. Will return!
2014-12-20,3,Good stuff.  Get the stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce.  Simple and delish. Someone else got a side dish of veggies.  Not recommended, looked oily and a not so good.  It's affordable bc it's BYOB.  Service is decent.  Great place for large parties.  We were a group of 17 and they were able to accommodate us and allow us to order a la carte, which was great!   Also didn't rush us out the door, even after restaurant filled up.  Big thumbs-up for that one, as I came late and we had a lot of wine to finish before moving onto the next place!
2014-12-16,4,I came here on a Friday night in December around 7PM and my small group did not have to wait for a table. We were immediately greeted by our server and handed a plate of delicious bruschetta. We brought our own wine and beer; FYI no corkage fees! Win! For appetizers we had the fresh, handmade mozzarella and a plate of meatballs. The mozzarella was seasoned perfectly and was complimented with the oil and vinegar that was served with it. The meatballs were moist and flavorful and in my opinion, the sauce was perfect. It was smooth with no seeds; not too thin and not too thick. Our table had the meat lasagna, butternut squash ravioli, and rigatoni with zucchini, eggplant, and fresh mozzarella. Everyone enjoyed their large portioned meals. My only complaint is that the tables are pretty small and crowded inside the restaurant. You can't really help that because the restaurant is small in general. My cousin and her husband are regulars here and now I know why. If I lived in the area I would frequent it as well!
2014-12-09,1,Rude server this time :-( the food was still yummy! Beware of the sharing charge.
2014-11-22,2,Ugh. Why is this place so bad?Got home from a long not great day at work a little after 11 last night. I hadn't eaten in 12 hours, 8 of which had been spent standing in a 60 degree room. I was so famished I would have eaten a shoe with a smear of peanut butter on it. My man had ordered penne arrabiata with chicken from here (one of my fav Italian dishes) and had leftovers for me. As opposed to making a true arrabiata sauce, infusing the red pepper flake in the tomato so it is spicy throughout, they had thrown some hot peppers into tomato sauce straight from the can that was sweet and unseasoned. The penne was so overcooked it was like paste. The resulting concoction was gross, truly inedible. Went to bed hungry.
2014-11-20,5,I've been extremely hesitant to review Cafe Michelina.  My reluctance was strictly for selfish reasons.  I didn't want it to become even harder to grab a table than it already is.  But, alas, I decided it was time to share my love with the Yelp community.  My husband and I have been going here since we first moved to Hoboken in 2008.  This is, hands down, my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken.Cafe Michelina is a quaint little Italian restaurant situated on the corner of 5th and Bloomfield, just one block off bustling Washington St.  It is a family run business.  The owner, Pietro, is really friendly, and his employees are mostly all family.Their food is awesome!  When you sit down, they bring a slice of bruschetta to each person at the table.  It is complimentary and yummy.  They also bring a bread basket with a nice crispy crust.My favorite dish is the Stuffed Rigatoni with Chicken in Vodka Sauce.  It is to die for!  This dish is considered a "special", but it has been on the "special" board every single time I have dined here.  Either they don't want to update the menus, or they do this so you won't know the price ($18.95).  I say it's worth every penny.  The chicken is so soft and tender, and the vodka sauce has the best flavor.  The tiramisu is delicious too!  And big enough to share.Cafe Michelina is BYOB, so make sure to grab your favorite bottle of wine or a 6 pack of beer on your way over.In the warmer months, they offer outdoor seating and that's at a premium.  There are only 4-5 outdoor tables max and everyone wants them.  They do not take reservations  unless you have at least 5 or 6 people.  For smaller parties, they will take your name and let you know when your table is ready.  The only caveat is that you need to wait there for your name to be called.  They do not take your phone number.For a small place, the restaurant can get extremely loud to the point where conversations can be difficult to hear.  So, not the best place to take Grandma (yes, I brought my grandmother here once, and she couldn't hear anything we were saying to her).  My husband and I love this restaurant so much that we wanted to hold our Rehearsal Dinner here before our wedding.  Unfortunately for us, the restaurant shuts down the last week of August through Labor Day to take vacation, so we had to go somewhere else.
2014-10-28,3,We stopped in for dinner when family was in town and had an okay time.Decor: There really is not anything special about the interior, or exterior, of this place. It has some Italian flair but nothing that is going to wow you. There is ample room for seating nearly any size group and you don't really feel cramped while you are there.Bathroom: The bathroom is average. It's pretty clean and decently lit.Staff: Our waitress was nice. She promptly took our order, while answering any questions we had (and even making substitutions as requested). Additionally, our food came out warm and in an average amount of time.Food/Drink: This place is BYOB (which we forgot about until we arrive... bummer), so we did not have any drinks. The food we ordered was pretty average; again it wasn't anything that wowed us: Chicken Alfredo, Penne Vodka, Lobster Ravioli, and Oysters/Seafood Diablo. The little Bruschetta they give you to start the meal is nice, though it is odd that it is not on the menu...Value: The prices were about what we were expecting to pay. They don't over-price their specials like other places either.Our meal was fine but I will be trying other places before returning again.
2014-10-23,5,Delicious.  Really like it, cheap prices, BYOB.  Perfect little corner Italian spot.
2014-10-07,4,This is such a cute Italian BYOB restaurant. The waiters are friendly and attentive. I've had the baked ziti and the fettuccine Alfredo - both to die for! I've tried out a few other Italian places in Hoboken, but none seem to be quite as good as this one. Great for dates or a girls wine night!
2014-09-17,5,Cafe Michelina has been my "go to" Italian restaurant in Hoboken for many years.  I held my bridal shower, group dinners and have had many date nights with my husband here.I think the food is great, many choices and they will prepare to order, if you have a special request.   The family that owns it is very nice, and we go so often, some of the wait staff now knows usual order (somewhat embarrassing).The decor is simple, actually pretty blah, but this isn't the place you go to for that...it is a neighborhood restaurant.  And BYOB is always a plus!
2014-08-24,4,I am not sure how to phrase this review besides "I liked it and would recommend it to people."Lots of flavor in their sauces. I enjoyed the Stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce.  It was a special for the night but I believe it is offered fairly regularly as other yelpers mentioned it in their reviews.  I ate every bite and also enjoyed some of the Caesar salad my guy ordered. With the combo...decent prices for tasty food in Hoboken plus BYO, I would strongly recommend this place for group get-together in Hoboken.P.S. Bread with butter and bruschetta come complimentary with the table so think twice about that order of garlic bread.
2014-08-21,3,Cafe Michelina is a good option when you want greasy italian comfort food. I love most of the things i've tried on their menu. The decor inside isnt as "fancy" as other places in Hoboken but its still a good choice for a date night or group dinner. It's byob which is a huge plus. There is some outdoor seating and i like that it's not on washington street because it's much quieter with less foot traffic. The stuffed rigatoni are to die for. I've never seen them on any other menu. It's basically a ravioli rigatoni pasta hybrid, delicious.
2014-07-17,3,This is a nice, relaxed restaurant off the main street in Hoboken. The food and service are both average & nothing amazing that will blow you away, but if you're looking for a relaxed evening, this is a good bet. I tried the Spaghetti in pesto sauce and the husband opted for the Salmon special of the day.  My dish was definitely better than the fish which wasn't too fresh and the white sauce that it came in was pretty okay too.I'll be sticking to their pasta next time round too.The service was brusque and a tad lackluster...didn't really get a warm vibe, everyone just went about doing their business in a matter of fact way. For a small, cozy joint, a few smiles would have been nice.
2014-07-13,5,The most delicious, freshest tasting food you'll ever have!A party of 5, we all raved about the taste and the quality of the food.From the seafood salad, the fresh on-premise made mozzarella and the anitpasto to the meatballs, filet of sole francais, pollo michelina and to the side orders of sauteed spinach and other vegetables, it was amazing!BYOB
2014-05-25,4,Neighborhood restaurant and lovely experience. It's BYO so that was good for us. The Scallops Francese were delicious. Staff friendly and attentive .( I do not need anyone hovering over me.)  Not fancy, but as I said, neighborhood an delightful .   I would return any time.
2014-05-14,3,Food was excellent, service was good but they charge $1 more than they advertise on the menu for each drink, appetizer and entree.  Not sure about dessert since we didn't see those prices on the menu. At the end of our meal they ended up overcharging us about $10, if not more.
2014-05-10,3,This is a neighborhood Italian restaurant.  The prices are reasonable.  I dined on the recommendation of my hotel staff as it was within walking distance.  I had the crab and lobster ravioli.  My partner had the rigatoni with chicken.  Both were from the specials board.  The marinara sauces were basically the same, although described differently.  We both tried each dish and agreed that the sauce basically made for similar taste experiences - not a bad thing as the sauce was good, but expectations were different.If I lived in the area, I can see this as a place I would visit regularly.  The staff was nice and welcoming.  The service was good and importantly, the food seems that it would be consistent and your favorites would soon be realized!  It is not on the main street so the experience is a bit more quiet and sedate.  As a visitor, I look for something with a bit more culinary flare and a place that will serve a glass of wine since I'm not likely to have my own bottle.  Overall, a good dinner experience.
2014-02-25,2,Being an eyetalian I'm picky about my Italian food. I was never a huge fan of this place for the food, but after the waitress overcharged me and a friend (added extra tip on to out credit card) I'm done here. So if you pay by card check your statement and beware. Best things about it:The bread (but the butter packets are extra small and annoying and no olive oil)ByobPortions (if you like being overfed )The chicken dishes are fine - nothing special nothing terrible. Sauces and pastas are avg at best (although I disliked the sauce some friends thought it was ok)Rice balls were bland and had nothing in them. Non attentive staffThat's all I tried there and all I will try as I have 0 patience for sleazy business practices. My credentials:  grown up on homegrown Italian food both here and in Italy so I like to think I can be a fair judge on taste.
2014-01-28,2,Went here for the first time last night and was not impressed. I passed by this place on my way to the gym hundreds of times and never thought about trying it out since it looked a little dumpy from the outside. When a friend of a friend raved about the food, I decided to give it a go. At first glace, the interior is what you'd expect from the exterior - it's barely decorated and smells faintly of cigarettes. My friend and I brought our own wine which kept the bill pretty low, but the food (penne vodka with shrimp and tiramisu) was average. We had two servers who were both very nice, but one of them was rushing us throughout the meal and visited our table every 10 minutes or so to check up on us.While it wasn't a particularly bad overall experience, with so many other Italian places in Hoboken and surrounding areas, there is no reason for me to go back to Cafe Michelina.
2013-12-30,2,Food is okay. Basic sauces. Waitress is rude, my friend wasn't eating due to a lactose intolerance and was munching on some bread, waitress was in a rush to clear the table and take the bread away from my friend.
2013-11-22,2,Standard, cheap Italian. Fills your belly but marginal quality. I won't be back. BYOB. Bland decor, very loud and difficult to carry on a conversation. Tab for two after tax/before tip was $29.
2013-07-29,4,Yum!!!!! Food was great! Went for dinner a couple of weeks ago and had the lobster and crab ravioli with vodka sauce....soooooo GOOD! The olive oil used is also divine.Best part is they are BYOB. Gotta love Hoboken =)
2013-07-28,4,My family was coming to visit me in Hoboken and my parents(who are from Italy) only eat Italian. Also, my father insists on eating Sunday dinner only at 2pm. He is an unchangeable(yet loving) man. This usually leaves us with very little options. There's no way you will catch me walking into a place called "Johnny Pepperoni" for Sunday dinner and I'm getting tired of Margarita's. I've walked by this restaurant a gazillion times but was hesitant because of some of the reviews. I'm really happy that we spent our Sunday dinner here.  So what? The decor is old school and there aren't any stupid tvs. When you walk into your grandparents house, do they have trendy tables and paintings or a brand new flat screen? No. That's exactly what I liked about eating here. I felt like I was eating at someone's nonno's house. The food is simple and soulful. And that's how most Italians eat. So to "David F" from Brooklyn who said to ditch this place and go to Babbo or Scarpetta in NY, you've completely missed the point. By all means, stay in NY next time. Because in Hoboken, we don't call servers "the help".  My family ate every last bite and left happy and that is always a small victory for me. I will definitely be back.
2013-03-17,4,We love this place and you will too as long as your expectation is real good food in casual atmosphere at good prices.  There is nothing fancy about the food, just fresh, tasty, hardy old-school italian food.  Smoked mozz ravioli and stuffed rigatoni with chicken are always go to's and their other specials are always good as well.  BYO is great to pair your fave wine with your meal as well as keep the cost down.The other great thing about this place is that if you have a large party, you can call ahead and reseve. No other BYO places in Hoboken allow you to do this.  And even if you have a large party, you still get great service and they're not trying to rush you out of there.  We will keep going back
2013-03-10,4,This was the first restaurant I ate at in Hoboken when I moved here almost 7-years ago. This is always a go to restaurant for me. Not fancy italian food by any means, but still very good, portions are big enough, and staff is pleasant. Plus prices are reasonable and its BYO, so what is there really to complain about?
2013-02-27,4,Amazing food, great service, a nice location one block away from Washington St so you can usually get seated right away.BYOB which is always great, the prices are normally perfect but sometimes the specials can be more expensive than you would think based off of other menu items so beware! (the price is not listed on the board)
2013-01-29,3,This place is average at best. I ordered the chicken parmigiana and my boyfriend ordered one of the specials (I can't remember what, exactly, but it was chicken in a white sauce) and he didn't even finish half of his food. Normally he'll eat almost anything so I was somewhat surprised. My food was better than his but again, nothing to write home about. There just wasn't much flavor in either dish and mine almost tasted like an Italian dish you'd order at a restaurant whose specialty is not Italian food. The positive is that the meal wasn't too expensive so I don't feel like we lost out on much.
2013-01-27,1,Terrible restaurant. Had high hopes, as I love supporting local businesses. However, when my ceasar salad tasted like it came from a supermarket, the tables felt like patio furniture from riteaid; and there was a table of drunk obnoxious guys (drinking cans of coors light for dinner...classy) awkwardly staring me down and acting like they run the place, you know it's time to go. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. To many good places to waste your time?
2013-01-03,5,The best Penne Vodka with Chicken I have ever had.  Consistent great customer service!
2012-12-09,3,Went to Cafe Michelina for the first time this past weekend. A few friends in town really like this place, so I was excited to try it out. Started with the stuffed artichoke - I think this was an appetizer special - and it was OK. It was stuffed with cheese and bread/bread crumbs - the bread it was stuffed with was a bit soggy, but I guess that'll happen when it's sitting in a quart of oil/broth. Not bad, but I'd pass next time. They also bring bread and butter to the table, but this was nothing special. It was a room temp loaf of bread with butter in the little foil packets. I don't need/expect artisan bread from a restaurant that comes across as a standard spot, but this was sort of disappointing for a place trying to bill itself as authentic Italian.For an entree, I got the stuffed sole (stuffed with crab, scallops, and... soggy bread) with a side of broccoli. Overall the taste was pretty good - the sole was in a lemon/garlic sauce, the broccoli steamed and served with garlic. And when I say I liked the taste, I'm just confirming my enjoyment of garlic. I can't really tell you how the broccoli or fish tasted because there was so much garlic - more garlic than I thought anyone would attempt to cook with (or infuse into the flavor... it was actually quite impressive). My girlfriend got a chicken dish that was served with spinach, mozzarella, and a lemon sauce - she enjoyed it, but said it wasn't anything too special.As for the space - I enjoyed it, it was 'warm.' They fit a lot of people into a small-ish space, but don't make it feel claustrophobic. As noted, it is BYOB which is always a positive. The pricing was standard - 1 app, 2 entrees, and 2 espresso was $56. The service was also very good. At first it seemed as if our waitress was pushing us for our orders, but she explained that the two parties with greater than 8 people each were about to place their orders, and she didn't want us to fall to the back. Get there before 8PM on a Friday to avoid a short wait.I'll probably go back, but won't rush it. 3 stars even for OK food, good space, and above-good service.
2012-11-17,1,This was my favorite BYOB in Hoboken, until I one night when I ordered a Caesar salad and asked for tomatoes and olives to be added on it. They charged me $2 for each! Never again.
2012-10-03,5,Though the place is small, it was able to accommodate a large group if given enough notice.  It's a very casual and quiet atmosphere, which I tend to like in my Italian restaurants.  I had their Penne Vodka with Chicken and was pleased with both the way the food was cooked and the portion size.  The menu itself is not large, but they have all the traditional Italian fare and from why my dining companions told me, their meals were just as good as mine.
2012-09-15,1,Don't bother with this place.  The food is subpar and the service is bad.  Oh, and make sure you keep track of what you actually order.  They're really shady about the bill and how much money you actually owe.
2012-09-05,3,I'm officially putting Cafe Michelina on my 'Restaurant Retirement' list. I've been here dozens of times for any occasion (or non-occasion) you can imagine.. and finally realized I had no clue why I keep coming back. The restaurant is BYOB which is always nice to keep the bill down.. but frankly the food is average Italian at best. Average can get you by in most towns; Hoboken should be a different story. The Specials (which never seem to change) have been my favorite of the whole menu. In my experience, the white sauces are pretty lacking, though the ravioli (in vodka sauce - check the specials board) is quite good. Great place to sit outside with a bottle (or two!) in the summer when you're looking for something basic. I don't think they've updated the interior in 25+ years which turns me off to dining here in the winter. I suppose you have to give them a little credit for such a no-fuss attitude.
2012-08-23,1,Good Italian but the service  + attitude of the waiters /hostess brings the experience waaaaaaay down.  I've never been there without a hassle from the staff -- they frequently bump people in front of you for seating, despite the size of your party (there are no reservations).  There is  sometimes an hour over expected wait time, no big deal -- but an hour is usually 90 minutes -2 hours in truth.  So plan accordingly. I've gotten many wise-ass comments from the waiters and hosts, who are pretty young.....it's really confusing why they treat customers the way they do.  Again, great food but after 3 visits and the same experience each time, I'd say skip and patronize one of the other Italian BYOBs with friendlier staff (i.e., Tratoria Saparito).
2012-08-08,2,Average in every aspect.  BYOB and outdoor seating being its only saviors.  Inside has bad acoustics and horrible atmosphere.  Don't come here for the Italian food.  Try Margheritas.
2012-08-06,4,Cute family-owned place. Nice people. Tasty food and fine service. :)
2012-07-10,4,Delicious. The penne arrabiata is spicy and perfect. For fans of good sauce, a must try. The waiters are sometimes hard to get a hold of, but when you come in a big group they are more attentive.
2012-05-11,3,Had just come from the City and we were looking for an Italian place to eat. The service was a bit slow at the start but once we ordered, things were fine. It appeared that they only had one waitress - even though it was the evening of a streetfair.Food was OK - I had the sole which was good - others had pasta and salads.  No complaints but not like other NJ Italian that I'm used to.The indoor seating area is not too large so it was very loud - there were a few tables that may have had some over-served people from the street fair there ... either that or the one person in their party was hard of hearing and had one of those voices that just carries.Bottom line is that it's a nice neighborhood place.
2012-03-25,4,More like 3.5 stars but the extra star for being BYOB.Stick to only the seafood dishes, both appetizers and entrees - trust me.
2012-03-15,4,I've been to Café Michelina twice now. My girlfriend introduced me to this place about 2 years ago. It has a very home-y feel to it, as opposed to the many other establishments in town. They bring out a very nice bruschetta and bread to begin with. We order a plate of cantaloupe and prosciutto to begin. The melon was deliciously sweet and the prosciutto was tender and not overly salty. She had the lobster ravioli which was very good and I order the chicken parm which I loved! I can't remember what we had to eat the other time, but I can assure you that it wasn't a disappointing meal. I am looking forward to returning to this little gem in Hoboken.  A HEAVY 3.5 stars
2012-02-14,1,this is not good italian. plain and simple. you are better off going to a pizza place.strange vibe in restaurant--feels dirty and old. not really worth your time.
2012-02-04,2,Once again, to properly review this restaurant, I will say that, if you never go for Italian in NYC, then you will like this place just fine. However, if you've been to Scalini, Il Baggato, Babbo, il Mulino, Orsa, Scarpetta, SD26, Da Silvano, Scotto, etc., etc., don't even bother -unless it's that or McDonald's (and then, at least give it some fair consideration before deciding). Whomever it was said the mussels were "AMAZING!" must've just been rescued from a month at sea. Some of the most bland and flavorless red sauce you can imagine without actually sending 'em back. It was such a disappointment dipping the bread into the sauce when you knew it looked great but was gonna taste like Hunts tomato sauce.My date ordered the tilapia francese - which, suprisingly enough was very good - but I figured I'd try a staple Italian dish and see what they did, so I got the linguine and white clam sauce (which the waiter said was 'excellent'). They should call it linguine in white clam 'soup' - as my pasta was practically floating in a broth of chicken stock or something. Almost flavorless, I was forced to put Parmesan cheese on it and salt. The dessert arrived frozen. the help is fine but wants you in and out asap so it's not a place to take your time, as there's always 8 groups of hungry locals giving you the evil eye for your table like in the Disneyland food court. All in all, I'd go back just to try their 'vodka sauce' or a staple dish, but it just once again proves my theory "you can't find any great restaurants in all of Hobroken." Prove me wrong.
2012-01-28,4,Cafe Michelina has become our regular Friday night dinner spot.  It's super low key, BYO, and they have delicious vodka sauce.  Their specials never seem to change but  everything I've had there from the eggplant rolatini to the stuffed rigatoni with chicken is delish.   Not much ambiance but reliable yummy italian food.
2012-01-23,5,BEST MUSCLES EVER!!I come here all the time now.  The muscles in the spicy marinara sauce are simply amazing.  The only time I've had better was in Italy.  I've tried many of the entrees and have yet to be disappointed.  The smoked mozzarella ravioli is probably the best one...so delicious.  The prices are very fair, plus it's BYOB so you can't go wrong.Overall this is my favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken.  It's simple, nothing fancy, but very very delicious.  I will keep coming back!
2012-01-21,3,I have to agree with the other reviews I have read which classify Cafe Michelina as "average" or "decent".  The food was decent; not good enough for me to say, "I can't wait to go back".  However, all of our food was hot and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  My fiancé really liked the vodka sauce.Wait staff is overwhelmed and the restaurant is so small that we waited about a half an hour for a table for two.
2012-01-08,3,Had a great time here a few weeks with a big group of friends. The food is good and prices are very reasonable. We ordered a ton of appetizers and ended up bringing home most of our entrées. All the old standbys such as antipasto, muscles and fried calamari are good (if not a little mundane), but definitely try the conch salad if you're looking for something different. The mixed seafood soup entrée is also a must, as it's generously stuffed with more shellfish than pasta.Be prepared to hold your reservation with a credit card if you have a large party and are attempting to make a reservation at a busy time of year. And don't expect to have a quiet meal, this place gets pretty raucous.
2011-12-28,4,I would give Cafe Michelina 5 stars for the food, except that I was a bit turned off by the service.  I went to Cafe Michelina on Christmas Eve (we had a reservation at 7pm for 2).  Of course we didn't need a reservation since Hoboken was deserted and it was a holiday.  We sat down and our wine was opened by our waitress who was very nice.  We were looking at the menu when someone came over to take our order (not our waitress- it looked like he either owned the restaurant or managed it).  We weren't really ready to order, so we said "we'll just put in an order for an appetizer first", since we were in no rush at all and were trying to enjoy ourselves.  The guy, half walking away at this point, said to us, "We'll take your food and appetizer order at the same time if you need a couple of minutes".  Perhaps some restaurants don't let you order apps first, but the way he said it was borderline rude and dismissive as he was walking away.  It almost seemed like he wanted us out of the restaurant to get out of work and start celebrating the holiday.  What irritated me further is that people were coming in well after we came into the restaurant, so it's not like we were there late and were holding up the restaurant from closing.  Onto the food:We started with fried calamari and a house salad.  I would not order the fried calamari again as it was nothing special.  The house salad, however, was very large and filled with beautiful greens.I ordered the Penne Vodka (which was amazing and kind of peppery).  My boyfriend ordered the Cheese Ravioli special (Homemade ravioli stuffed with smoked mozzarella in a vodka sauce topped with fresh mozzarella).  The ravioli was amazing.  The mozzarella HAD to have been from Fiore's.  The bread and butter was standard, but was delicious also.  Aside from the little hiccup with the manager/owner, I can't wait to go back again.
2011-12-17,5,24 hours later and I'm still salivating over last nights dinner...Venue:  There's nothing fancy about this location, if anything very dated and old school.  I think that's the look they're going for though.  Old world Italian kitchen, I guess?  Its always packed, which makes the dining experience fun;  noise and commotion of a packed filled kitchen, which makes it cozy. Food:  Regardless of the atmosphere, nom nom nom, the food here is SO FRIGGEN Delicious!!  I've been here a couple of times and the food is always amazing.  Top two dishes to order:  Stuffed Rigatoni with Chicken in Vodka sauce and the Spicy Penne Arrabiata with Chicken.  I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it, both dishes were SO good!  The tomato and mozzarella antipasti is a great starter, so rich and creamy.  Final:  great, great. GREAT Italian food! and its BYOB :)
2011-12-08,4,You know what...I AM a fan.  I'll say it!This place is literally right around the corner on 5th and Bloomfield.  There are some cute (can a guy say cute?) little tables outside during the spring and summer and about 15 tables inside.  I've seen a party of 1 up to a party of about 20 fit nicely in this place.The decor is basic but it works because the food is basic.  There are no frills with the presentation or preparation, however everything is fresh and flavorful.I usually like to start with the giant Caesar Salad that could feed 4.  My go to here is the chicken parm, but I've also had the ravioli and muscles as a meal.  Everything was delish.Lot's of Italian places to choose from in Hoboken and this is one of the better choices.BYOB!!!!!
2011-11-15,2,From the reviews I read, I was expecting objectively good food and objectively good ambiance. What I found was mediocre food at a low enough price that it almost balances out -- except that they jack up prices on the specials. In my opinion, Michelina is a classic example of low end Italian food. We started with stuffed artichoke ($9). It was good enough. A lot of bread stuffing, a bland buttery sauce -- no real spice of flavor, but artichoke is always fun.My girlfriend had the eggplant Parmesan ($12). She enjoyed her dish. And the eggplant was nicely cooked, but most of the dish was spaghetti with very standard tomato sauce. I had the chicken Sorrento ($19 - was a special didn't know the price). Chicken, mozz, eggplant, capers. I got tiny rounds of eggplant, bland baked chicken, and a watery white sauce. Overall, I felt this was the sort of food I would make on a week night if I were in a hurry and didn't feel like cooking much -- just dump some red sauce on pasta and bake a unprepared chicken breast.  Also the ambiance felt more dumpy than cute to me. We were there on a Tuesday, so maybe on a weekend it feels more lively, but the cheesy paintings, tiled floors, and sloping table didn't do it for me. The tin walls are cool though. BYOB is nice.All in all, there are better Italian places in Hoboken.
2011-11-01,4,In celebration of one of my roommate's birthday last week, we decided to hit up Cafe Michelina.  We had been there once before and had been so blown away by the food that we elected to walk the 2 miles home, giggling wildly about how delicious everything had been.As we pulled up in front of the restaurant, my other roommate who was having an unbirthday swung the car door open and a passing driver smashed into it.This is important for two reasons.  One, because everyone should know that people are, always have been and always will be maniacs.  Be careful out there.  And two, it should be pointed out that by the time we sat down to dinner, it was far closer to closing time than normal dinner time.Being a little shaken up from both the accident and the thought of obscene insurance deductibles, it was an outstanding thing that Michelina is BYOB.  Our alcohol bill would have been far more sizeable anywhere else.  The popularity of BYOB in Hoboken is a wonderful thing in general.  It makes a lot easier to go out and have nice dinners more often.After beginning the meal with a fantastic garlic bread and complimentary bruschetta (which I passed on but the rest of my party thought was excellent), we settled in to the main course.  I ordered the smoked mozzarella ravioli from the specials menu.  While it wasn't a terrible meal, it definitely is not something I would ever order again.  It came out a little cold and was a little too smokey for my taste.The rest of my party ordered the penne vodka (spectacular), the fettuccine alla primavera (which was delicious after a cream sauce was substituted for the standard marinara) and the penne with chicken and portobello mushrooms (above average).  The lesson learned with the food here seems to be that you should stick to what's on the menu.  What they know how to do, they do well.  They could use a little practice on the special dishes.As we were there close to closing time, the restaurant was relatively empty so it felt like far more of a spacious place than it actually is.  I can see how others might feel cramped during a busier dinner time.  The proximity to closing time could also explain why my food was below room temperature.  The service was decent, minus our waitress not being able to figure out what fresh pepper is and handing over a standard pepper shaker on two occasions.Our bill came out to just around $70, which was excellent for 4 entrees, garlic bread and a carrot cake - which, by the way, was awful and should only be ordered under extreme duress.  I would definitely eat at Cafe Michelina again, but long gone are those giddy feelings of food joy towards it.  If they just stick to what they know and kept the food hot enough, they would maybe be worth 4 and a half stars.
2011-10-29,1,Small restaurant with average food, went after hearing all the raves about their vodka sauce. I got the cheese ravioli and substituted the marinara for the vodka sauce for an extra charge. It was okay, nothing amazing. There were only three tables occupied and we still didn't get our drinks refilled.When we went to pay the bill we were overcharged, and when we told the waiter he came back and said "their prices increased and the menu hasn't been updated to reflect it".Will not be going back.
2011-10-15,4,Very cute Italian restaurant that is BYOB (which is always a phenomenal thing). The service was pretty good, and I got the fried mozzarella and the chicken parm. Loved both, even if the fried mozzarella could have been a little more bread on it. I'd highly recommend both, and I thought the sauce was delicious. Plus, it seemed like they had a pretty extensive and delicious dessert, which I would have tried if the chicken parm didn't fill me up. Seriously, I felt that I was at the Cheesecake Factory with that size portion. I came with two girls and they both loved it. Consensus: we'll be back.Check it out, and, of course, bring a wine bottle or two.
2011-10-14,1,What a terrible place! Not only is the food bland and cheap tasting, but the prices are outrageous. Usually, I would still give a place like this some leeway but the service has to be the worst in the city. The owner's daughter, son, and nieces, and nephews make up the wait staff. They spend more time smoking right next to the outdoor seating than taking orders. The daughter is by far the worst of them all, but they are all degenerates. The place looks dirty and I am pretty sure I saw a member of the kitchen staff go out to make a delivery on his bike and then go back to the kitchen without washing his hands. He too walked outside and immediately lit up a cigarette right next to me while I was eating. The sauce tastes like something out of a cheap can and the chicken was thin and somehow still dry. How is that possible? There are so many good Italian restaurants in Hoboken that have great food and friendly helpful wait staffs. Why waste your money on this nightmare of a restaurant? Go to Leo's
2011-10-14,5,The ONLY worthy Italian restaurant in Hoboken.  I went with my husband a couple weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.  We got the homemade mozzarella sticks, linguini and clams (red sauce), crab and lobster ravioli, and a desert.  The portions were perfect and the food was delicious. I am VERY picky when it comes to Italian and will not go back to any other Italian restaurant in Hoboken, they do not compare.  Extra perk...it's a BYOB.
2011-09-26,3,I am giving Cafe Michelina 3 stars because I feel like the pluses are equally balanced with some minuses. To start with some positives, the food was OK. Nothing spectacular, but decent.  The restaurant is cute, but small, and is filled with the charm.  You are automatically started off with bruschetta, which is a unique twist that I haven't seen before. Also, the restaurant is BYOB, which always helps to keep the bill down. The minuses - When I said the restaurant is small, I meant tiny.  A party of 12 filled about half the restaurant and delayed seating times. The staff, while friendly, are slow due to the limited number of available hands. Once seated, we waited for at least 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order and no one told us of any specials for the night.  My boyfriend's chicken franchaise we a bit salty... too salty. Overall, the experience was OK, but I think I will try some different restaurants before going back to this one the next time I am in Hoboken.
2011-08-25,4,I walk by the place almost every morning and I finally decided to try it while my parents were in town. We went on a Tuesday night, so there was no wait, in fact we were the first people there and sat outside on a beautiful evening. The service was prompt and friendly. They give you complimentary bruschetta, it's wonderful, a bit too much oil but still great. We ordered the melon and prosciutto (and yes people in the actual language of Italian you pronounce the O at the end). It was simple but great.My Mom got the Rigatoni Vodka, delicious. I got chicken and baby eggplant, delicious, my dad got penne, meat sauce and meatballs. Simple, yet wonderful. The bread was great, the entrees were great, the service was great. We got a couple cannolis for desert and they of course were simple, but wonderful. I loved this place. It's small, hole in the wall, mom and pop and that's what makes it great. Best of all, BYOB - wins my heart over almost every time. If you're looking for simple, but flavorful Italian that's BYOB this is your spot, they've won a customer that's for sure, heck of a lot better than Leo's. If you want Italian/Asian/Brazilian/French fusion or whatever is trendy than this won't be for you.
2011-08-17,5,Went on a Friday night at 7pm during the summer. We went early as we heard that the wait is normally over an hour long. For whatever reason it was not full and we were seated immediately. Service was great and I ordered the vodka pasta. I don't think I have had a better vodka pasta than they serve at Cafe Michaelina, yum.
2011-08-07,5,This is our go-to place for group dinners with the girls!!  Also great to order in from.  It's BYOB, which is wonderful if you are with a group as all can bring whatever they'd like to drink and they will keep it on ice for you.  I'm pretty simple and easy to please (I guess) and I tend to order the same thing from them- the stuffed rigatoni with chicken, which is a consistent special from them.  It's always very satisfying and I like it a lot.  My BF likes the Chicken Michelina, and I've had friends rave about the Chicken Murphy and the Zuppa de Pesce, though I haven't had those.  It's certainly a hole in the wall type of place, not fancy at all, but consistent food in my opinion and good for groups or couples.
2011-07-24,4,I went here recently on a date. It's BYO, but there's a liquor store around the corner on Washington so we grabbed a bottle of red and a bottle of white.We ordered: the antipast for two, sauteed broccoli, a chicken bruschetta special and a chicken with asparagus special.They give everyone a basket of bread, and a complimentary piece of bruschetta. It wasn't crowded at all, and we were there from about 7 to 10:30. The food is really, really good. Mozzarella was so fresh and buttery...just as fresh mozzarella should be. Every entree comes with spaghetti, linguine or penne and ample, AMPLE olive oil.I think we left over half our food, just because we spent so much time talking and when the wine kicked in...hunger was pretty much non-existent.Solid food, casual atmosphere and they are very courteous--even when you sit there for over an hour talking before ordering :)
2011-07-22,1,Ordered the manicotti-Serving size was small for their price ($10.95)...The marinara sauce was okay, but the entire dish tasted like something I could just make at home. Also, they blasted top 40s during the lunchtime hour I went, which didn't lend to the most pleasant dining experience ever. The waitresses were slow at refilling waters, although I was one of two parties in the entire restaurant. Not planning on going back there anytime soon-
2011-07-09,1,Oh here we go again.  All I can say is this was a huge disappointment.  Wow, this place deserves half a star.  I wanted chicken francese, so I ordered delivery from this place.   The delivery time was satisfactory, but what followed certainly was not.I opened my round tin foil container to see the worst piece of crap ever to be called, well, what I ordered.  It was so dry, so flavorless, that I had to go into my kitchen and try to resurrect the carcass of what was, to my knowledge, a chicken.  And yeah, there was some pasta.  They only have linguini, spaghetti, and penne.  Again, another minus. The fact that I had to add crushed red pepper, olive oil, garlic powder, oregano, etc.,  to my meal is an atrocity.  What do I pay the chefs for?  I guess I'm just mad because they robbed me for $33.  Let this be a lesson, don't go cheap.Just pass and go to Filippos on First.  You wont be disappointed.
2011-05-23,1,I have never in all my years received such a poor attitude from a waitress.  They seem not to  care  about customer service.  Okay here is what happened;-asked for olive oil with my bread as we do not eat butter ( their butter was the frozen kind waped in those tiny little plastic things you would get at a  fast food place).-upon asking for olive oil  i was told "no" we only give to those who order  a salad with their meal..  But i said "i do not want  a salad just a t little oil to dip a piece of bread"; she still said no.  i was left in shock.- then i called her over again and said nicely may I please maybe just have a tablespoon of olive oil so I may dip a piece of bread  The answer was  still a flat out no.  I asked can you ask the owner, she repiied I am the owner.  It was evident she was too young to be the owner.  I said are you are kidding?.  She then identified herself as a relative.-So after 2 minutes we decided to l get up and leave.  They spotted us doing that and a new waitress came over with oil in hand.  However, before giving us th oli she said we coud not leave because we  had already placed our order..  I said so you are demanding I sit down and eat my dinner .  I said I could do what ever I want  Then I said I will stay if you are planning on  giving me that oilve oil in your hand (which she had not offered to me at this point) and.  she said yes. i said then i will stay if you are offering me the olive oil i asked for.-After an arguement about 10 cents worth  of oil I stayed.  However , the original waitress never returned to my table. The attitude of the staff is just so rude and I will never go back.  I was embarrassed and humiliated that this conversation had to take place in such a tiny restaurant  (not the cleanist either) where people had no choice but to hear.   It is evident they just do not care.-Do not waste your money here the restaurent couldn't  care less about you. . They only  care about every penny they are making on you and do  not offer an ounce of respect.  Why on earth would I ever return.-Please save yourself a miserable time and go to Leo's or Margueritta.s where they care about you not the pennies in their pocketbook.I am still in shock!
2011-05-20,5,Local mom and pop feel italian restaurant right off the main drag in Hoboken. The food is amazing, the prices are great, and the best thing about this place is that it's a B.Y.O.B. restaurant.  They have outdoor seating, though pretty limited.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, decent prices and good atmosphere.  Manga!
2011-05-10,3,Good service.Not necessarily cheap but good for the price. Lobster Ravioli was great!
2011-03-04,5,This spot is amazing, most likely one of the best Italian places in Hoboken. The wait can be pretty long for a couple or 4 top. I recommend a table of 6 or more in which case they will take reservations. Last night my boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night and waited about half and hour. The service is always very fast and helpful, definitely family owned and run. Plus it's byob which is amazing! We order the stuffed rigatoni with chicken in vodka sauce and Shrimp parmesan. Everything is probably homemade the flavors are exceptional ALWAYS, we've been at least 5 times..The specials are always great! This is for sure a staple in Hoboken!
2011-02-14,3,It was fine food, but nothing special. In fact, I wouldn't actually recommend it to anyone. It was good because it was cheap and I could bring my own wine. But, so is Margherita's and it makes better food. meal started with a bruschetta, which was free, so nice. However, the bread needs improvement - it was old, dense, and cold. Don't order the fried calamari - was very bland, we didn't even eat half the order. . The fried ravioli was good.  The lobster ravioli was good. The shrimp scampi was ok. And the wine that we brought was wonderful  not NOT overpriced, so, the visit was absolutely worth it, to be out, and to not be overspending.
2011-01-16,2,Another mediocre Italian place in Hoboken. I've eaten here three times (actually, one was delivery and the other 2 were with large groups). 12 of us went last night. I will say that it is ideal for large groups because although the place isn't huge, we were seated comfortably and of course BYOB is great for a big group. The service last night was practically nonexistent. We sat for awhile before they even brought us menus, and at the end of the night, it took us several attempts to even get the bill. We started off with appetizers of antipasto and fried calamari. The fried calamari was surprisingly good. For my meal, I ordered one of the specials, which was chicken with spinach and fresh mozz in a white wine sauce. The sauce was SO salty that it made it hard to even eat. I've had their chicken francese through delivery and thought that it was bland. The one other time I've eaten there, I got the stuffed rigatoni in vodka sauce and chicken and while it was nothing spectacular, it was probably the best thing I've eaten from there. Overall, just your typical average Italian place.
2011-01-12,4,A new addition to my short list of favorite restaurants in Hoboken...Here's the highlights: * BYOB* I ordered the Red Snapper special which was HUGE.  Maybe the size of two big fish?  I couldn't even eat a quarter of it.  I also got a side of amazing sauteed spinach. * My date ordered a chicken special with fresh spinach, tomato, and mozzarella cheese which was incredibly delicious.  * Great service...Our food came out within minutes and we definitely closed the place down and they didn't try to rush out out at all. * Weird ambiance - Casual (which is fine) but they were playing a radio station that played Black Eyed Peas, Kei$ha, and Tao Cruz.  It was noticeable and threw things off. The total bill was about $30.  Seriously.  That's killer.
2010-12-28,5,Michelina is amazing from it's brochette to it's entrees. There are a few places that my husband and I bring out of towners to when they come to visit or if there is some kind of special occasion, this being one of them. It's an awesome place for a decent sized get together. We had about 8 people in for a holiday dinner a few years ago and chose to use this as our celebration space. We decided to try a few different spaces in the years after but nothing has matched up to the experience we had here. Everyone's food was amazing. My personal favorite is the Chicken Frances and the calamari is awesome as well. It's also BYOB!!! I've tried a lot of the Ital. places here in Hoboken but this is by far the best. My only warning, don't sit by the door in the winter!!
2010-12-27,2,people RAVE about this place - no clue why? it's SOOO loud, my mom wouldnt even walk in and try and wait for a table. went back with the BF and we could barely hear each other speak - far from romantic. could see where it would be fun for a large party with many BYOB bottles. food was just EH nothing special.
2010-11-17,3,We moved to Hoboken a couple of years ago and were recommended this place by our landlord. My wife and I absolutely love the food here. We usually order delivery but once in a while we do go to the place.We've been regulars for almost 2 years now. However, on our last visit. I was extremely disappointed by the service. It was a busy Friday evening so we were asked to wait for 40 minutes, no biggie, it was expected. We ended up waiting almost an hour after putting our names down. One of the waiters had some friends show up and he promptly put them ahead of us in line. The other waitress questioned him about it and he just made up some story about them calling ahead. It was very busy and the waitress just threw her hands up in the air and walked away. We questioned the waiter and he just rudely said that his friends called ahead.We were eventually seated, the same waiter was pretty rude throughout the night. We shared a dish and the waiter promptly added a sharing charge without notifying us that there is an extra charge for sharing. We've been to this place many times but have never paid a sharing charge to share a dish. The portions are pretty big so we always share. Odd. I don't mind paying but I'd appreciate being told upfront. If it was on the menu I probably skipped looking at it.Apart from the poor service, the food is excellent. I just recommend going on a night when they are not crowded, hopefully you get better service.
2010-10-20,4,Michelina is the best 'simple Italian' in town. Nothing fancy. It's BYOB. They have lots of specials and the regular menu probably hasn't changed in about 15 years - for good reason, the dishes are very good.The restaurant is a bit lackluster, but a good time to bring friends or special other that doesn't need a view of the city. The seating can get a bit cramp on weekends, and it can also get a bit loud. Otherwise, I consider it my "go to" place in Hoboken when I just want a simple Italian meal - and they do a good job at delivery, too.
2010-10-09,4,I found myself craving Italian at 9pm Saturday.  I have never been to Cafe Michelina so I cannot speak of their interior but the young lady who answered the phone was incredibly kind and helpful.  I originally was going to order from Delivery.com but I wanted soup (was not listed on their menu) so I decided to pick up the 'ol telephone.  I am kicking myself for not asking this woman's name because she was so darn friendly.I ordered penne vodka and pasta fagioli  - both outstanding (...says the 1/2 Italian girl).  I asked for some parmesan cheese on the side and yes, it in fact did appear with my order.  She promised me 30 minute delivery and followed through on that.  Soup and entree were both piping hot.My only complain (because you KNOW there has to be a con for everything); no bread to soak up the wonderful sauce and soup.  That will NOT stop me for ordering from Cafe Michelina again, though.
2010-09-20,5,The owner of the  cooks! This is a family atmosphere and will not disappoint. Very Hoboken. BYOB since they don't have a liquor license.
2010-07-30,5,Another 5 star bang...what has the world come to?I came here as per my colleague's recommendation especially since she lives in Hoboken and knows all the hottie, I mean hot spots.Great food, excellent service, BYOB, very easy on the pocket, indie owned...what's not to like?We arrived around 7 PM on a Thursday evening with no reservations and were seated immediately.  It was nice out so we decided to grab a table outside.  As soon as we got acquainted the server brought out complimentary bruschetta which was tasty but I would've liked more tomatoes (I'm a tomato fan).Once we were done with the bruschetta, we received a small loaf of bread that neither of us tried...why? Not quite sure but there were flies chillin' like a villain on it.  If we couldn't enjoy it, at least the flies did!I asked the server what she recommended as we were both newbs here and took her up on her suggestions.We ordered the Pollo Alla Murphy and Tortellini Alla Michelina's.  The Pollo Alla Murphy was exquisite to say the very least...so good that I barely took a break from scarfing it down.  The dish was very simple just the way I like it -- boneless chicken sauteed in garlic, hot peppers, and mushrooms.  The hand made Tortellini tasted okay but the winner of the night was the Pollo.  Just to be fair with dish descriptions, the Tortellini was tossed in a white parm cream sauce with finely chopped ham.Yes, the decor inside the restaurant is pretty drab but who cares?! The food is what definitively defines this establishment and I shall return...soon. Very soon. Maybe this weekend. See ya there? Okay, bye.
2010-06-17,4,This place was very charming. From the pots of fresh basil growing outside (not just for show) to the owner furiously windexing tables and correcting crooked picture frames, this is the kind of no frills Italian restaurant that I can really enjoy and relax in. The menu is small but filled with staple Italian dishes. We were in the mood for home style cooking and it is exactly what we got. The service was as good as the food.
2010-06-07,3,Nice Italian spot just off of Washington. The prices are better than Trattoria Saporito,the tomatoe sauce is better than Leo's, and it's a BYOB.Three A's is still my money spot, but Michelin's is on the top of my list for BOYB places since the food is always good.A recipe for a good meal!Had a friends birthday party here on a Friday and the wait staff was so good. Really took care of us and all the alcohol we needed chilled.
2010-05-19,5,I LOVE this place!!! The penne vodka is so delicious!! Now I get it with broccoli and it's even better (and I tell myself that I'm eating "healthier"). I love that it's BYOB- it's a great place to bring out of town guests - "authentic" Italian food that is very easy on the wallet. And the free bruschetta they give you is fantastic!
2010-04-30,5,I love this restaurant!  It is well worth the wait.  I think they have one of the best red sauces and despite how busy the restaurant can be, you are always guaranteed great service.  The noise level can be a little much when there are several large parties, but that's just because everyone is enjoying themselves and the great food!  Plus, you can't beat a BYOB.
2010-04-17,4,9pm on saturday night, we decided to brave hoboken and started searching for parking.there was a group of bachelorettes outside enjoying wine while waiting.  the wait was an hour.  good business indeed.  i had a huge pasta craving so fine i waited.got the usual, penne with vodka sauce.  and a special small eggplant (pretty much chinese eggplant) with chicken, fresh mozz and light marinara sauce.the vodka sauce still rocks.  but when half way through, i noticed an unusual object inside the dish.  it was a wire!!  accckkk.... waiter!!!!  she was quite apologetic and offered a new vodka dish.  we were half way done, so no, thank you.the chix with eggplant was decent, but not something that i would want them to add to their permanent menu.bill came, again the waiter apologized and said that she took off the penne vodka for us.  yay!  now this is what i call great service!
2010-03-28,3,I hadn't been to Cafe Michelina in years -- but a friend who used to live in town came in for dinner and had a hankering to go.  As it was early on a rainy Monday night, it was one of the few times you didn't have to worry about big crowds as there was only 2 other tables seated when we came in.The waiter came over to us about 3 times to take our order -- but we had been so involved chatting and catching up that we hadn't even looked.  We promised him that if he came back in 2 minutes, we'd be ready.  Well, it took him nearly 20 minutes to make it back to us -- even in spite of us flagging him down twice.   A few others tables had come in -- but there were two servers and maybe now a total of 6 tables seated in the restaurant.    Yes, our fault for taking our time to get to the menu -- but 20 minutes in a half empty restaurant is ridiculous.The atmosphere is nothing to write home about, but the food is really quite good.  Large portions -- and hearty entrees.  Nothing too light here!As it is a BYOB, Cafe Michelina is easy on the wallet.
2010-03-23,5,LOVED THIS PLACE! Stumbled upon it while searching Yelp for "BYOB" one night in Hoboken. Food was the BEST we had in Hoboken - I had some sort of lemon zest chicken deliciousness, and my date had something pasta (sorry our memory is foggy). Loved the whole night, wait staff was awesome, very very affordable, but most importantly the food was DELICIOUS. Would go back to Hoboken (dare I say) just for this restaurant.
2010-01-27,5,Delicious food, awesome prices, and it's BYOB, which helps keep costs down. What more could you ask for?
2009-11-23,4,Had meat lasagna.  IT was GOOD!  The bruchetta drenched in oil was tough, they should consider not serving that anymore.  Everything else was pretty good and ofcourse boyb is always a big plus.
2009-11-16,4,Simple place, simple menu, and a great value.If you're looking for a casual but nice spot for dinner, its worth a look.  You may have to stop in to put your name down and possibly wait for a table since it's an intimate (small) place, but with so many other options in the area, it's not hard to change plans if that plan doesn't pan out.Extremely affordable, especially with BYOB.
2009-10-19,4,Makes me feel like I'm eating dinner in my nona's basement. Great Italian food with a homecooked feel.
2009-09-28,4,Sept 20094.5 stars for having really good homestyle food, very casual setting, decent prices and BYOB!Went on a Monday night at 7pm and was able to get a table for 2 right away, although the place was already almost full.I went based solely on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. Don't expect a "nice" place - Cafe Michelina is about good food and enjoying your dining mates' company amid no frills decor, which is a non-factor as long as you know what to expect.We started by sharing the huge caesar salad with a homemade sauce that's just perfect and not too salty.  For mains, we ordered one of the day's specials, stuffed rigatoni w/ chicken and vodka sauce, which was very very good and pasta w/ meat sauce, which was fine. Overall, the portions are huge and pasta cooked well, al dente.It was a bit lively (i.e. loud), so I wouldn't come here for a quiet, romantic night out. But, it was perfect for a casual, good meal that won't hurt your wallet. Oh and BYOB is awesome.
2009-08-26,5,Pretty stellar Italian with BYOB.  The line can be daunting with an hour wait in a Hoboken place off the main strip, but it's well worth it for the food and price.  Family-owned, the waitstaff is very friendly and quick.No frills decor.  Not a romantic setting for a special evening.  But if you want to kick back with good friends, good wine, and good food in a festive atmosphere (meaning LOUD), this is a great place.  This is simple, pasta ITALIAN.   Not mediteranean Italian.  It's hearty pasta Italian.  What Hoboken is known for.Once seated, they give you a place of bruschetta on the house.  Pieces of Italian bread pilied high with tomato and onions and doused in olive oil.  They make sure to give you enough for each person in your party.  For an appetizer, their antipasta plate is spectacular.   Pastas are cooked al dente.  I've enjoyed their eggplant parmesan with large disks of eggplant smothered in mozzarella cheese and sauce with a generous helping of spaghetti on the side.  Their chicken penne vodka is also outstanding.  I can lick the entire plate of sauce.  The downside is no bread on the table, I like to use the bread to soak up the last of the sauce (when I try to be civilized in front of company).I'm at a toss up between whether I like Leo's or Michelina's better.  But I can't choose, they both are so different, yet so Italian.  Once I try Augustino's (and based on those reviews), I may have a 3-way tie for best Italian.
2009-08-12,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken!  There are normally large crowds of people seated inside which can get a little noisy - but you know the food is good when there are huge Italian families eating there regularly. YUM!  I love the penne vodka - but everything I have had has been delicious.  Another plus - it's BYO.  I would definitely recommend Cafe Michelina to anyone looking for great Italian at a reasonable price in Hobo!
2009-06-20,4,This restaurant was one of our mainstays about 5 years ago when I lived in Hoboken. I recently returned and recall why. It's really a no frills place, but it's BYOB and you get huge portions.  In the summer they have a few outdoor seats, which opens it up a bit.  Whatever you get, It's authentic tasting, like you're eating from a family kitchen.  In fact, that might be the best part about the Italian restaurants in Hoboken.  So many choices, but they're all so different. It's like going from one family's home to the next, then arguing about whose mama does it best!
2009-05-30,4,Cafe Michelina is a great place to come with friends and have a very enjoyable, affordable meal. It's definitely loud and crowded but that adds to its' appeal and makes it more of a fun experience. I had the linguini with white clam sauce last time I went and thought it was delicious. Definitely recommend this place!
2009-05-29,5,This is simply the best Italian food in New Jersey.  I strongly recommend anything with their marinara (penne arriabiata is outstanding).  Also, their penne a la vodka is great too.  Their Veal Carozza (usually on special) is the best dish in the house.
2009-05-15,5,great food! friend of the family owned place.. good service!
2009-03-12,2,Not bad - the food was good but the service was HORRIBLE.  On the weekends it's so busy you'll wait forever to get a table, but don't ever go on a weeknight.  There will only be 2 other people in the restaurant and they'll still make you wait forever for your food...and then your bill.
2009-02-27,2,Not a bad Italian place, it's a noisy, loud place for a BYOB. My napkin was dirty but they replaced the entire set of silverware, too. The waitstaff has one lady with a face that reminds me of Scarlett Johansson. Anyway, the first thing they brought out was a piece of bruschetta for each of us. Probably the best part of the meal, drenched in olive oil, tomatoes, and onions.The pasta isn't bad, al dente, and the specials are decent. The linguine wasn't interesting (it was done well, but the sauce was a plain marinara which was a bit watery), the mussels in wine sauce had very little wine taste to them, although they were piled very high. The tilapia - skip it. The spinach bed was tasty, but the tilapia was just grilled and served up with a little cracked pepper and salt, and lemons to the side.  The cheese tortellini in vodka sauce - pretty creamy and standard, hot, with a dash of parsley to color. Interesting, but the taste, again, felt absent.There was the dessert, too, a tiramisu that was mostly creme, and a little rum and some ladyfingers - delicate, but really triumphant in it's presentation, mostly (delicate whipped cream, sprinkled chocolate shavings and chocolate chips at the corners). Almost saved the entire meal and made it a three.... This place will certainly fill you, and the service is pretty decent. Don't come expecting fine dining, though. Noisy and a bit less than tasty, I will give this local eatery a try again, but next time, I won't take the waitstaff's suggestions...
2008-08-30,4,Huge fan of this place, but not for the atmosphere.  The food, however, was delish.Two friends and I sat outside during the end of a lightning storm, which I guess provided some scenery.  But the delish complimentary bruschetta really got us started.  My friends had baked ziti and some sort of pasta dish, but I had the chicken parm, which was one of the best I've had.  Thinly pounded chicken, sweet, fresh-tasting tomato sauce, and layers of fresh mozzarella cheese, served with a heaping portion of linguine, al dente.  Perfection.  And even better was the half that was left over for the next day.Definitely bring your favorite bottle of red, and enjoy!
2008-06-24,4,Don't come for the ambiance, but the pasta is damn good.  Bring your own bottle of Chianti; it's BYO (noticing a trend among the places I've reviewed, hmmm).  The specials are usually worth checking out.  Don't think too much about your diet if you go; the cream-laden vodka sauce (with stuffed rigatoni if you can get it) is too good to pass up.The waitstaff pretty much leaves you alone, so if you are looking to lounge, it should be no problem on an off night.  I can't speak for peak times though.
2008-03-08,5,Cafe Michelina is one of the best restaurants in Hoboken.  BYOB with no corking charge and a small, free bruschetta when you get in are a great perk.  The quaint, noisy atmosphere reminds me of a good family Italian dinner and I can't seem to order anything other than the Chicken Parmesan which is the best I've ever had.
2008-02-05,4,They're not kidding when they call their penne arrabiata spicy -- not for the faint of heart. Still, solid, no-nonsense BYOB place with friendly service, delicious bruschetta and homemade pastas.
2007-06-05,5,If I can come right out and say it, I believe Cafe Michelina is THE BEST Italian restaurant in Hoboken.  Best food, seriously... pasta is delicately cooked, just the right amount of sauce, great bare bones entrees, the specials are a perfect addition.. Refills on bread are frequent.Atmosphere can be very very noisy, but that's what you get when groups of people dine together.  Haven't been outside at all but thankfully it increases the amount of people they can serve.  On a weekend night there will always be a wait.Did I mention this place is BYOB?  I love me a good Italian restaurant where I don't have to pay for wine (which you obviously drink when you eat Italian cuisine).Recommended: Penne vodka (I added fresh mutz to it and it was divine), zucchini sticks, pair these all with a great cabernet.
