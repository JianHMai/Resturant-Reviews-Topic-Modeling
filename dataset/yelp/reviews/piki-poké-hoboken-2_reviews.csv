2021-10-29,1,I love the food at Piki Poke. It's fresh, healthy and overall a good bargain. However my experience just now was simply unacceptable. I order through Grubhub and the delivery driver harasses me and threatens me to give more tip money? And accuses me of not tipping in the past despite him being completely unrecognizable to me. What is this nonsense. His choices as a delivery person are not under my control. I am a paying customer and tipper. I love this place but my business will be lost, as will others, if delivery personal are hostile like this.
2021-09-19,5,All for the poke here! I've done pick up and take out here and the employees here look like they try to work as efficiently and quickly as possible. Will get busy during lunch and dinner but worth the wait if you order there (which is done through an ipad which makes it super easy). They also have outdoor dining.I've done variations of the two protein poke. I would definitely look at their menu ahead of time to get an idea of what you want because there are so just many options to add into your poke. All at a very reasonable price! I am a fan of the kale noodle with tuna and salmon.You definitely won't leave hungry here! My go to for sure for Hoboken poke.
2021-09-12,5,You can tell the owners are absolutely obsessed with delivering an exceptional experience whether it's pickup or delivery. Best poké I've had including anywhere in NYC.
2021-09-09,5,Finally found my poke place in Hoboken. So good! Tons of selections to choose from and everything was so fresh. I built my own poke and my bf got the Yuzu salmon bowl. I loved that they have different sizes to choose from (mini/reg/large) depends on how many proteins you want. The ahi tuna/spicy tuna/salmon were all very fresh as well. We went there to order and it was ready in 10 min. Everyone was so nice and our orders weren't missing anything. Can't wait to go back. Highly recommend.
2021-09-04,5,Such an amazing restaurant! Everything was so good and I got a mini chicken bowl with quinoa, cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, avocados, wontons and I didn't even need the dressing with all those flavors. The mini bowl was the perfect size and everything about it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it!
2021-09-02,4,I stopped into Piki Poke to create a custom One Protein Mini Bowl, which was the perfect size for a light lunch.  (I would recommend the larger, two protein bowl for a more substantial meal.  I started with a spring mix salad base, topped it with grilled eel, incorporated three mix-ins (such as organic kale), added two crunchy items (one of which was lotus chips), and lastly got two sauces on the side.  All of the ingredients were fresh and vibrant; and the selection was vast.  For the less creative or time-strapped, the restaurant offered a list of chef-curated bowls as well.  They also sell acai bowls for non-seafood eaters.  Lastly, while I took my meal to-go, the restaurant provided tables both inside and outside as alternatives.Piki Poke was delicious, affordable, and quick.
2021-08-16,5,I have not stopped daydreaming about this poké bowl since I've eaten it. For my two-protein bowl, I chose to throw together salmon, tuna, avocado, diced mango, pickled ginger, corn, red cabbage, sweet onions, and kale noodles. I topped it off with spicy mayo, eel sauce, and poké sauce. Every ingredient was entirely delicious and so, so fresh. I literally cannot wait to eat that exact dish again. I'll also add that the two-protein bowl is significantly bigger than the one-protein bowl so you're paying for a bigger bowl in addition to just one more protein.From what I saw, Piki Poké seems to be more centered around to-go orders than sit-down dining. And they had plenty of to-go orders waiting inside -- this is a popular place. Will 100% be ordering from here again!
2021-06-29,5,Fresh ingredientsLarge portion size Great taste You can make it very healthy For a pretty low price.
2021-06-13,5,Hands down Best poke bowl I have ever tried in my life! They make their bowls very well in detail
2021-06-10,5,I love this place! The fish and toppings are always fresh. When I order delivery it comes on time and right to my door. Truly contactless delivery. People complain about the portion sizes. I have no idea why..Im full just from a small bowl with one protein. Maybe these people are getting salads. I plan to order again soon!
2021-06-08,4,Ordered via Grubhub. My order was delivered late and when I tried to call the restaurant to check on my delivery status I was hung up on. Other than that, the food was good. I got a 2 protein poke bowl with tuna and salmon. Large portions for fairly cheap price. I am likely to return but maybe just pick up from the restaurant or dine in.
2021-05-01,4,My boyfriend and I stopped in to order a couple bowls and miso soup to go. He also ordered the zucchini noodles as a side.We each got a custom large bowl. The to go bags are cute. Their own stickers too.I ordered mine with grilled eel, salmon, ahi tuna and an extra of scallops. Mixed green base, with cabbage, seaweed, GF spicy Mayo, some more veggies and double avocado. Love the fresh mixed greens. My bowl was $25. A bit expensive but it was a filling size which was nice.I wouldn't order the eel again only because it was coated in some kind of sauce I didn't want. It said "grilled eel" on the menu when I selected it, so I didn't know it would have sauce all over it. I loved the fresh avocado and it was an excellent presentation. :)My boyfriends bowl was also a nice size. He said the miso was better elsewhere so he wouldn't order it again. And the zucchini noodles were bland so he wouldn't order them again either. He samples four of their sauces (on the side) including an aioli and a wasabi and said they all were delicious!! His fav was the creamy wasabi sauce.So our next visit, we will both just get the large custom bowls with extra proteins!
2021-03-28,5,Great poke bowls and I'm very impressed with their covid precautions. I ordered ahead and when I arrived, they an easy contactless pickup system so I felt safe. The poke bowls are tasty and they don't skimp on the portions.
2021-03-26,5,When it comes to poke, I was skeptical when piki opened. But after going there once and then several times afterwards, piki became a must for me. It ruined me for other poke places because of their choices, freshness, and simple costumer service! Their COVID friendly way of serving food gives customers peace of mind. The staff is wearing masks and have glass to minimize contact. When you walk in, you order on a tablet as well, making communication simplistic and clear. Their portions will get you full, as they serve a rather large amount that is bang for your buck! I will be a regular at piki poke!
2021-03-10,5,This is my go to place in Hoboken for Poke! Great topping selections and the presentation is just amazing. Always build my own poké bowl, but it's worth it every single time!
2021-03-09,4,Got the poke bowl and loved it! I love how the kale spaghetti is an option as the base and all the fish tastes really fresh. Would definitely recommend!
2021-03-08,5,I've been trying to find poké that's comparable to what I've had in Hawaii and this place is pretty good! Their brown rice is rly yummy and fish is always fresh. I really like their rice balls too - my favorite is the unagi. They're also doing a great job of keeping it clean and covid-safe in their store.
2021-02-28,4,We ordered via UberEats and the order was available for pick up pretty quickly. I made my own poke bowl with 2 proteins and X had their premade Hawaiian Poke bowl. I really enjoyed my bowl - there was a decent amount of protein and they don't skimp on the included toppings either. Fish was pretty fresh and everything mixed well together. I do think the prices are a bit high - I think I paid almost $16 for my bowl. It was good, but it was also pretty expensive.
2021-02-06,5,I am obsessed with Poke now because of this place. My favorite thing to order from them is the Tuna and Salmon Fan Bowl. When I tell you the fish is incredibly fresh and all the accompanying ingredients go incredibly well together please believe me. This is also one of the most filling meals you will ever eat. I was not expecting to feel as full as I did after eating a Poke Bowl, but a good full, not a "I feel horrible" kind of full. I put my family onto this place and they also thought it was delicious. If you're a seafood, sushi, or just a fresh fish lover then this is the place for you. Highly recommend this place. Available on UberEats!
2020-12-23,5,Wow! They really are next level with COVID safety measures. They have the kitchen completely separated by glass, and there's microphones for customers to talk through. They also have touch screen ordering systems.All employees were wearing masks and gloves, and there's social distancing stickers on the floor. This was my first time getting takeout from them, previously I've always ordered delivery. Great to see they have safe systems in place for in-house ordering and dining! If you check in at this location you get 10 percent off your order, which was a nice surprise. They have a great range of toppings and anytime I've ever ordered from here my meal has tasted fresh and flavorful. For a two protein bowl it comes out to $11.75 (not counting any "extras" like avocado), which I think is fair for a good poke bowl. I do wish they offered cauliflower rice as a base, but that's my only very small complaint!
2020-12-02,5,Being Gluten Free trying to find a place to eat is usually challenging. I am finding Hoboken to be more Gluten Free Friendly. I ordered from Piki and was so happy I did. I created my own bowl to play it safe. I enjoyed every bite. Even my leftovers next day were still as yummy. Everything was fresh and the Kale noodles were delicious. So excited to see Purple rice on the menu too. This will definitely be one of my go to spots for lunch and take home for dinner. I promise to take a pic next time.
2020-11-15,5,Omfg.Best poke bowl I've ever had. Legit.AND they have purple rice. Win win win.No lie their poke bowls are bomb. I made my own and it was fantastic. So fresh, so good, and delivered right on time.Hi Piki Poke, seems like you're my new best friend.
2020-10-29,5,Hands down the best poke I have ever had!! My roommate and I shamelessly order this every Friday and they never disappoint, everything is always fresh. Their COVID precautions are next level with glass surrounding the food and employees. I do the make your own bowl option with 2 or 3 scoops of protein depending on how hangry I am.  #PikiPoke4life
2020-10-27,4,This place has good purple rice and salmon. Overall veggies and fruits are fresh. Portion size is good. They have a variety of toppings to choose from. I like how they don't cheap out on fish or fruit. I would go again.
2020-09-30,5,I had an amazing poke bowl with tuna and salmon! This place has inside and outside dining and it's very cute. I paid around 19$ for my bowl so it's a little expensive but worth it.
2020-09-28,2,Gave this spot another try and it seems like the quality has gone down since they first opened (maybe because of Covid?). They give even less protein now and most of the bowl consists of the base. We also gave the blue crab rice ball a try, and it was mostly just rice and soy sauce. With so many poke spots always popping up, I think I'll give those a try instead.
2020-09-18,3,I got a bowl with white rice, unagi, spicy salmon & several toppings. I didn't expect the salmon to not be cubed (but that might be on my fault, not them). I wouldn't mind trying a bowl again but it just felt very discombobulated for me personally.
2020-09-18,5,Fast, fresh, yummy and cheap that's how I describe this place! Small space but food is so delicious! 5 stars only!
2020-09-14,5,This location is next level when it comes to COVID-19 precautions -- which is great! They installed such a sturdy, impenetrable case around themselves and the food to the point where they had to install two microphones for them to be able to communicate with customers. They also do not allow you to use their bathrooms.This is by far the best poké I've ever had. They have a large selection of options for base, protein, toppings, and sauce. I was able to create a bowl I typically enjoy, and add extra ingredients I normally wouldn't see on other menus. The best part is how they utilize the large bowls they serve your food in -- rice (or whatever base you choose) doesn't take up a majority of the space.We're not sure if they didn't offer us cups of water due to social distancing, or if it's because they don't offer it in the first place. They do, however, have a small selection of drinks to purchase from.There's metered parking all around the area, but we opted for garage parking approx. 8 minutes away by foot ($20 for a day spent at Hoboken). Although we can't visit this place as often as we'd like due to how expensive and stressful driving to Hoboken is, we'll definitely visit again in the future.
2020-08-10,5,10/10 - the owners are meticulous about their restaurant. All of the ingredients are fresh and the workstation is immaculate at all times. I think they also opened the ramen place next door, looking forward to checking that out as Piki is a neighborhood favorite.
2020-07-20,5,Piki Poké is the best poké in Hoboken! Consistently delicious, fresh ingredients and always perfect.
2020-07-18,1,I am extremely disappointed with this establishment. This place was a go to of mine....ordering from this place 2-3 times a week. I recently had a terrible experience where there was something very hard in my food (I'm my opinion a small rock) While taking a bite, I bit down and ended up chipping my tooth. I called the manager, (Johnny) the next day after I had to make an emergency visit to the dentist as my molar was killing me to have my tooth fixed. Thinking this place would do the right thing and cover my $276.00 bill the manager did not take responsibility at all, denying that anything was in my food and basically calling me a liar. No store credit or anything. The way in which the manager handled this issue was exceptionally unprofessional and even more disappointing that as one of their better customers they made zero effort to retain my business. Needless to say I will be taking legal action against this restaurant and never ordering from this place again as there are plenty of other Poke bowl places in hoboken. (Shaka Bowl, Proven Poke)
2020-07-04,5,I love making my own Poke, if you like trying new things I would recommend the purple rice and the spicy mayo sauce. They also have really good drinks as well, definitely try it out.
2020-06-12,5,Being obsessed with poke bowls, I thought I was so lucky to finally find a poke place that delivered to Weehawken. Imagine my excitement when my poke bowl came and it was the largest poke bowl that I've ever had and I ordered the regular 2 protein portion! They certainly did not skimp out on toppings. Not only that, but it ended up tasting fresh and delicious. Please don't ever stop delivering to this area.
2020-05-30,4,I came here two times. The first time I ordered salmon and scallops with additional toppings. Service was great and ingredients were fresh and I couldn't wait to come back. The second time... eh but since then they've redeemed themselves. COVID UPDATE: I'm impressed with the changes they made for safety precautions during this time. I've been frequenting this spot before Covid and even more so now. They're definitely up to standards. Salmon is fresh. Staff are friendly and helpful. Support local businesses guys!
2020-05-21,5,Insanely fresh food/fish, huge portion sizes for the price, and so many toppings to choose from! I have ordered from here multiple times during quarantine and my food is always delivered within 20 minutes of placing the order, which is amazing! Best poke bowls in Hoboken!
2020-03-18,5,Both their poke bowls and onigiri (rice balls) are absolutely delicious. Cannot recommend enough! I will definitely go there with my partner when he's back in town!
2020-03-16,5,Poke poke. Piki Poke offers everything a typical poke spot offers except that they have Unagi (BBQ eel) as a selection! Most of the poke places I have been to do not offer Unagi as it is one of the more expensive fish but they got it here and it tastes great! I tried a large bowl with the spicy salmon, tuna, and Unagi and all the fish and other toppings were fresh and delicious. They also have a huge sauce variety to choose from. Verdict: I'll be back for more.
2020-03-14,5,This is probably my favorite lunch spot in Hoboken since it opened. The fish and ingredients are very fresh. I'm a huge poke fan and I'm so glad this place opened, now I no longer have to go into the city to get my poke fix. I do wish though there's no limit on the toppings for the BYO poke bowl options without being charged extra.
2020-03-01,4,Ordered from here today- tuna and salmon poke bowl. It was delicious! Missing star is due to random pieces of bell pepper and spinach in the bowl- not part of the menu, so strange.
2020-02-29,1,After waiting over 20 mins for my regular sized poke bowl (mind you I was the only customer there) they managed to mess up my order and rushed into fixing it. I asked for half purple rice and half lettuce in my bowl, and they gave me quinoa.. which I had specifically said I didn't want. When they gave me the final order, it looked disheveled and they didn't even add the lettuce like I had previously  asked. While I waited, I watched them prioritize dozens of orders that ended up just sitting on the counter waiting to be picked up instead of attending their only present customer. It honestly looked like it was their first day on the job. They worked at glacial pace on adding ingredients and even dicing an avocado. Just save yourself the time and go to Makai. It's usually my go to for poke but it happened to be closed today.
2020-02-23,5,Ordered delivery from here and was very pleased!I ordered miso soup and a BYO Poke bowl with shrimp and tofu over purple rice and spring mix, with other add-ins. The portion was well worth the price and all the ingredients were quite fresh. The bowl itself was arranged beautifully, which I thought was a nice touch given that it's just a delivery order. There was plenty of each ingredient too - I swear I got at least a half of an avocado and both proteins were big pieces in even amounts. Everything was so light and fresh; I'm fairly certain nothing was cooked with oil which is a nice change. Sauces were given on the side as well so I was able to control how much I wanted on there. The miso soup was pretty standard and was also a good sized portion with plenty of seaweed and tofu in it. You are definitely getting your money's worth here, especially if you're looking for a healthier but still quick option.
2020-02-19,5,I always love how fresh all their fish is. I ordered from seamless the custom two main poke bowl. Although I did get a random spinach leaf but I am not complaining lol I could not chose just one so I made three custom bowls. Pro: Seafood is always fresh , delivery time, and quality of the all the ingredients Con: haven't found anything yet
2020-02-05,5,FRESH fish + multiple options for add on toppings + amazing sauces = Poke Bowls from Piki Poke! Great spot that really shines with the options for toppings. The fish itself was great, as I had the seared tuna and salmon with pickled ginger, sliced mango, crumbled nuts, sweet onion, lotus chips, carrots and cucumber over white rice SO good!
2020-01-12,5,Very friendly staff! You can see they put a lot of effort on every order they got. Great food!
2019-12-27,5,Only small, white guys and fat chics go here. ....... .......................................#90­dayfiance........................
2019-12-21,5,My husband and I have been on a serious poke kick lately and having been to all of the poke spots in Hoboken, we are loving this newbie! We've been to Hawaii and have experienced "real" Hawaiian poke and this is definitely pretty close. Honestly for me, it's all the options, you can load up your poke bowl with multiple proteins, sauces and other tasty toppings making it packed with flavor and deliciousness. They also have rice balls that are also pretty awesome! I would definitely recommend and they deliver to Union City which makes  me love them even more :)!
2019-12-18,5,Piki Poke is the most consistent, fresh, and impressive poke place in Hoboken! I have ordered 3 different times and each order has impressed me. The portions are huge! The rice balls are delicious and light. Yummy across the board.
2019-12-13,5,Best poke around! Great quality and very fresh. Love the amount of options in creating your own poke bowl and for a good price too. Delivery has been consistently quick  and correct. I've never left a Yelp review before but felt like Piki really deserves the kudos!
2019-11-11,3,Ordered from here for the first time last night and while the food was good, my partner and I both ordered Lychee Calpico (soft drink) and both bottles had expired in September. (It's November) I drank the entire thing before I noticed, and to put it politely, this morning I experienced some unfortunate abdominal distress. I might give it another try, but it does leave me wondering what else might be expired. Not something you want to worry about when you're about to eat raw fish.
2019-11-10,5,I am so happy that this place opened up. I have been looking for a quality Poké bowl place in Hoboken for a long time. I've been here several times and the food quality is consistently good. The staff is polite/friendly and their prices are reasonable. I'd highly recommend giving this place a visit.
2019-11-09,5,New poke spot on Washington street and it doesn't disappoint. When you check in, you get 15% off your order. They have poke bowls, rice balls, acrid bowls and poke wraps. My first time there I made my own poke bowl - they have a menu where you mark your selections for your order. There's a lot of protein, toppings, add-ons and sauces to chose from. Portions were great for the price we paid: for 2 kinds of protein it was roughly $10. We also came for late dinner around 9pm and the food was still fresh!
2019-11-08,5,Prefer this place over for poke and rice bowls over the other places in town. Quality is also better than most places
2019-10-29,5,Had a rice ball and it was really affordable! The woman working was also super nice! Will be coming again!
2019-10-27,5,Such great poke bowls! Super fresh and lots of options. Always fast service and delivery. Definitely recommend.
2019-10-24,5,They are clean and professional, with fresh food, many options, and a cheerful attitude! I'm so glad they opened up!
2019-10-24,5,New Açia and Poke Spot on Washington Avenue!! Reasonable pricing with a create your own menu of açaí and poke bowls....Fast service with a friendly staff...
2019-10-14,3,I saw that a new poke place came to town so you know I had to try.  Easy quick delivery if you are not feeling like leaving your couch. I ordered a poke bowl with both salmon and spicy tuna. I had a bunch of ingredients on it. It was a good sized portion I will say that. Unfortunately, it wasn't better that other spots in town. Ingredients were good but it lacked that punch of flavor. With poke it's hard to put a concrete explanantion why one place is better than another.  Unless its awful it's hard to tell. Flavors were good but didn't wow me. This was a 3.5 if I could give a half. I think I may keep it at a 3.
2019-10-07,5,I passed by and figured I'd try the newest Poke on the block . Very impressed by the service, food and general friendliness Pardon the picture as my Spicy Tuna Poke Bowl with Quinoa looked better when it was served ( I was starving) Very fresh and tasty with lots of options - I willbe back !!
2019-09-29,5,I consistently order from them for the following reasons:*FREE delivery*Biggest portions of all poke places around*Super quick delivery *I ask for extra sauce on the side, they don't even charge me*They follow every special instruction I write and never get it wrong *The fish is always fresh*Presentation is awesome
2019-09-23,5,I came across this place when I was looking for another place that closed early.  I did a Yelp search for Poke Bowls in the area.  I selected this place because of the close proximity and good reviews.It did not disappoint.  I cannot wait to get another one or two or three.
2019-09-23,4,Great tasting fresh ingredients with a fantastic array of options. Only complaint is the crab to protein ratio - not much protein and a whole lot of carb.
2019-09-19,5,Really fresh ingredients and the sauce is really good! Highly recommended if you need a healthy diet but you are picky for the flavor at the same time! Love the yuzu sauce! Super refreshing and so yum!
2019-09-15,5,Bowls are my sweet spot and Piki Poke does a really good one.  So many ingredients, sauces, etc. to choose from it's going to take a few visits to try all the variations...but so far love everything I've had.  Having so many options is nice to keep changing it up.  Can't see getting tired of this place any time soon.  Nice portion size too.  Employees are helpful if you are ordering in person.  Convenient on-line ordering and pick-up as well.  Ingredients are flavorful and fresh.  A new favorite bowl place for me!
2019-08-24,4,This was our first time here and it was a pleasant experience. The workers welcomed us when we walked in. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was because we had to wait longer than expected. I waited double the time it would've taken at another poke spot in Hoboken. This could be because the person behind the counter was still training. Regardless the portions were great and the poke delicious! The only thing I dislike about the DIY bowl is that you are limited on the number of mix ins and toppings. However that being said it's a great bang for your buck if you're not in a rush
2019-08-18,5,Best Poke place in Hoboken! The customer service was great and friendly both over the phone and in person. The food was plentiful and fresh and I loved making my own poke bowl. I had the Create Your Own Poke Bowl with 2 Proteins: White Rice, Unagi, Salmon, edamame, cucumber, seaweed Salad, Crab Salad, Sweet potato mash, wonton crisps, tempura flakes, and eel sauce ($10.95) They are the better deal compared to other places that only give you one protein, and serve it in a snack size bowl. Will definitely be coming back!
2019-08-15,3,I tried the new Poké place as I like to give a new place a fair shot. I did the make-your-own bowl and the majority of ingredients were fresh. The woman was helpful in explaining certain mix-in items. The finished product is on par with other Poké places in town. I deducted a star because a male employee was adding lettuce to one of the bins using his bare hands (no gloves) and in this day & age you just can't be too safe when it comes to cleanliness, so I'd try them again if I see that anyone involved in food prep is wearing gloves. This is an easy fix. Hope they can take care of it.
2019-08-09,5,Easily the best Poké in Hoboken! Their bowls and their seaweed wraps are so good. Everyone who works here is super nice. They have Unagi which is hard to find at poké places. They also have spicy tuna and not every place in Hoboken has. Some places have tuna and you can put spicy mayo on it but Piki Poké has chopped up spicy tuna in addition to regular tuna.
2019-08-01,4,Another Poké place in Hoboken, I only tried the #3 unagi grill bowl  and was quite impressed with it,  it has grilled eel(aka unagi), crab  salad  , shredded tamago, seaweed salad, osinko,  cucumber,cashew nuts laced with unagi sauce & spicy mayo. They take credit card  (min. of $10) or  cash. They do have free wifi and a bathroom for customers. There is car and bike parking on the street as well. Have to go back and try the rest on the menu, want to try their wraps and rice bowls.  I can assure you everything is fresh which i always like when I go out to eat. Check it out!
