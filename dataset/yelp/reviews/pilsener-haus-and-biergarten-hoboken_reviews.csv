2021-10-24,3,As one would expect, Pilsner Haus has an extensive beer list to choose from and lots of outdoor seating. If you're up for it - the liter pours are a good deal vs. the 1/2 liters. The beer garden area has heaters which are a huge plus as the cooler weather rolls in; tables on  the Grand St/15th Street sides do not.It was the last weekend of their Oktoberfest celebrations, and SUPER crowded on Saturday afternoon. They were a not flexible when we asked to move tables because the size of our group grew. Instead, they made our friends wait in line to secure a larger table and then it was annoying when we had to close/re-open our tab to move once we finally got the larger table.
2021-10-10,3,Still a great spot but the food has changed and not for the better.  The "spatzle" is not the same at ALL, more of an American Mac and Cheese.  Bummer.
2021-10-10,3,Vibes are nice, lots of screens and good seating area. Not a long wait for Sunday evening. Food was not great tho. Had a very very dry burger
2021-09-22,5,Great atmosphere, easy parking, decent price. Love the home brews. Lots of seating inside and outdoors in the patio. Good for large groups. Also pet friendly. Plenty of Octoberfest flavors. Not impressed with their cocktails and mussels but hey this is a beer hall.
2021-09-19,2,Beware for Sunday football. They advertise that they play every live Sunday game but when you ask for a game (they have at least 6 screens in the main dining room), they say they can only play "regional games."  Even called ahead and the guy said they played "every game they can get."
2021-09-07,3,This is a nice place to go if you're in Hoboken, and looking for a "beer garden" vibe. I came here with my co workers thinking they still had their "50% off everything on the menu Tuesdays" but that is not happening anymore... so kinda sad :'( I do really like the space, there's tons of seating inside and outside, set up like a lovely beer garden space. We chose to sit outside and it was really nice and covered.We ordered the:Smokey Bratwurst: I'm not gonna lie, this was really disappointing in terms of flavor. That sausage itself is quite thick and will fill you up! But, it tasted like nothing honestly. It had a normal hot dog flavor, not a smokey/spicy one as the server said it'd be. It was also not hot, kinda felt like it'd been sitting out for some hours. It does come with fries, but those were quite cold as well. I wish I got a different one, perhaps the cheddar? Pulled Pork Sandwich:This was really good! Loaded sandwich with lots of pork, coleslaw, and other random veggies. I'd ask for more sauce on the side tho. Bavarian Warm Pretzel: We ordered this to share because it's quite a popular item, but it didn't blow me away. It was a bit dry and way too salty. It comes with dijon mustard and a veggie cream cheese of some sort? Doesn't come with cheese or any warm dipping sauces, like normal pretzels do. It was average to me. Brownie Sundae:This was the star of the show, I would highly recommend this. It comes with a warm brownie, caramel, fudge, vanilla ice cream, walnuts, and whipped cream. It was really good and make sure you get all the elements for that perfect bite.Overall, this place is overpriced and the food is average~
2021-08-30,5,Tremendous imports.  Good vibes all around.  Great beer hall if you are in the Hoboken area.
2021-08-26,5,Those mashed potatoes were mashed by the Neverland fairies that escaped Captain Hook's kitchen, after being enslaved as personal chefs. Those ribs were roasted over the fire built by only the most expensive wood ever foraged for, only being built once. So used to soggy fried chicken, I had a heart attack after being frightened by an actual crunch from such a crispy, perfectly fried delectable golden feathered chicken meat, thigh. The corn meal for the breaded shrimp was harvested by golden husked corn ears. Only growing once in every millenia. Last, the fish and chips...reminded me of zeppoles, a childhood favorite, springing one sole unicorn tear from my eyes, making ne realize my superpower, a power to foretell the future, me marrying all the chefs and prep staff involved. To a happy union!
2021-07-07,5,If you are coming here on a weekend, get in early as they don't take reservations and have like an hour wait time. They have a good collection of German beers. We also ordered a bratwurst, hummus platter, and fries. I really loved the fries, they were thick cut and had perfect seasoning. Bratwurst was moist and delicious. A good place to enjoy a beer with friends!
2021-07-04,2,The bratwurst is pretty good, the fries are ok as are the prices.  The place can be a pain in the neck to pick up food, though, since they make you go to the grill area to get it.  The service is very slow and not very friendly.  However, now they are refusing to take takeout orders so I'm pretty much done with them.  Very disappointing overall, especially the people who work here.  There's been lots of complaints about the staff judging by the reviews so I shouldn't be surprised that I've also had problems with them.
2021-06-11,3,Great verity for beers but staff is not always helpful and not enough vegan options other than Salad.
2021-06-01,2,We were here yesterday for MDW. The service was very slow and we weren't allowed to order from the bar. We also didn't review the bill until later and noticed we were charged an extra pretzel and extra drinks. Very disappointed.
2021-05-31,2,Do not book a private party here...unless you enjoy trying to split a $1700 tab between 25 people. This was the exact situation I was trying to avoid but was reassured by their event coordinator, Gianna, they we could do 4 tabs per table (8 tabs total). However when we arrived, we were told it would be one tab and that's how it was always done for larger parties. I explained that Gianna had told me differently and pulled up her email. They claimed to have called her, and explained there was a miscommunication and it would remain as one tab. At this point, my hands were tied, as I had signed a contract, but I made it clear to management that I would not have planned my party here knowing this, and specifically tried to avoid this. When I emailed Gianna the next day she said that they had called her and she explained and was in agreement with what she had offered to me. I'm not sure where the disconnect and miscommunication failed here but do yourself a favor, for your own sanity, and give your business elsewhere.
2021-05-24,4,We arrived at around 8 on a Tuesday and the place was full. It was a bit hard to fin a place to sit and we had separate our party in to two. The atmosphere and people around us made it easy. The beer selection is great and the pretzels are worm and delicious. Note that in order to get anything from the grill, you have to get up from your place and stand in line to get your order and pay cache. Then come back when it is ready. This was a bit annoying since you came to spend time with friends but you end up splitting between ordering and saving the sit. Not sure why the waiter can't order for you. He was bringing us food and drinks anyway. Another weird thing was that the waiter asks us to give him a credit card and driver's license for him to keep during our stay.Bring cash since the place prefer it and charge twice for credit.
2021-05-16,4,Liked this place! First impression is that's it's a little more expensive than I feel like the experience should have been. 1.5 liters of beer, 1 order of the schnitzel and an order of fish and chips set us back $70. Otherwise it seems like a place you can gets drinks with friends and get rowdy! Serve you a liter in a huge glass Stein and the food we had was very good. Definitely will be back for some other tasty German dishes.Open for brunch too which I'm excited to try out one day, especially with the start of the football season knocking! Sat outside and that was nice and inside was very large with a good amount TVs, so definitely posting up here on Sunday afternoons a few weeks soon.
2021-05-16,4,Me and my gf went to this place just for drinks before going for dinner at Orale, but out experience at Orale was so terrible we left and went back for dinner.  The employees are super nice and the place has a really great vibe!  The service is a little slow but I think it's because there's a massive amount of people there and far too few employees to serve them.  We had Weiner schnitzel and fish n chips.  The weinerschnitzel has overcooked and dry and was very hard to eat with plastic forks but still had good flavor.  It could've used more lingo berry sauce.  Good German potato salad, though.  The fish n chips were awesome!  Cooked perfectly and so flavorful with really good fries.  We also got the pig in a blanket phyllo-wrapped sausage with sauerkraut and it was very good, too.  Huge beers, lots of variety and good live music.  It was a really fun night and is our new go-to place for date night.
2021-05-16,5,I have been to the Biergarden many many times and was already had a good time with the great beers . I have eaten in the past but wasn't impressed . My buddy demanded I try it now and I'm soo glad I did . As far as outdoor dining , you can't beat it ( as well as beer selections). We ordered wings and then wings again - certainly in the top 3 in Hoboken . I ordered the spicy chicken to go and it was fabulous - very impressed !! Service is always great - I willBe back for chicken and chicken
2021-04-19,1,Staff scolds and berates their customers (if they are person of color aka not white) for the same things white customers were doing. The staff even threatened customers when they didn't do anything wrong. The establishment has loooong picnic tables as dining tables. If you were at the end of the table, you would have to walk to the other side to speak to the person on the other end. Is that worth threatening the customer to kick them out especially when: 1) over $1000 was spent on your business and 2) white customers were doing the exact same shit but were not reprimanded at all? Shit like this is why I am now wary of entering a non-Asian/non-POC establishment-- out of fear of being discriminated against.
2021-04-19,1,Rude, hostile wait staff pacing around just looking to start a fight, I guess to justify to management that they deserve to be on the payroll or to unfairly let off some steam on paying customers. You can literally be minding your own business with your own group of friends, and the staff members will bark at you like the untrained dogs they are.The food is mediocre at best, so it's definitely not worth it to come here and become a verbal punching bag for the workers on a power trip here. You guys are weirdos.
2021-04-19,1,My friends and I were discriminated against and severely mistreated because of our race at this establishment. Multiple staff members unnecessarily yelled at my group throughout the night for STANDING at our own table and conversing without a mask. I understand if we were walking around and endangering other parties but our feet were literally not moving, just standing for a bit to converse with guests at the other end of the long picnic tables. There were other tables (full of only white people) that were exhibiting the EXACT same behavior but they were not yelled at or reprimanded in any way. They threatened us multiple times throughout the night to kick us out. Also, between food, drink and gratuity we spent well over $1,000 that night. I'm still shaken at how horrible it felt to be targeted as a minority like this at a restaurant that we had been loyal customers for years. We will not be returning. The staff on the left in the picture was particularly belligerent towards female guests in my group.
2021-04-01,5,The atmosphere and food are excellent. And the beer selection. A favorite outdoor place for friends and family
2021-03-31,4,Great vibes all around! It was my first time in Hoboken and Pilsener Haus was the perfect spot to go. They have a ton of long tables inside and out. We came around 2pm on a Saturday and it was packed but luckily we were the last group that didn't need to wait.They have a wide variety of beer/cider options which was great and food was awesome too. Service was relatively quick especially knowing how busy it was. They have the soft pretzels on deck because ours came in no joke 20 seconds. Perfect spot for a large group and they always have sports games playing on large projectors inside. I would definitely come back!
2021-03-20,1,Not a fan. I have been to many Biergartens and this is the least favorite. We had a table with 5 people and got the Bratwurst, Golash and Wiener Schnitzel. The bratwuirst were flavorless, golash was not traditional and the Schnitzer was dry salty shoe leather. And to top it off there is zero social distancing in the place. our table was shared with others next to us. And this was during the afternoon, so i can imagine the dinner and evening how packed this place is. Beer was fine but thats not hard to screw up. So if your expecting some good eats, go elsewhere and be aware you may not be Covid safe either.
2021-03-17,5,As of right now, this is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.German cuisine is one of the few cuisines that Jersey doesn't have a lot of. So when I run into a German joint, and it doesn't disappoint, it earns a special place in my heart. The atmosphere of this place is great! Theres music, so many tv screens to watch the game, and a section where the sausage is cooked to the aroma of the room is intoxicating.. It's the perfect spot to bring a group of friends during the day or at night, drink a bunch of different delicious beers and enjoy German specialities!I came in looking to eat some great German sausage since its not something I can grab at most restaurants. I couldn't choose just one sausage so I got the meatlovers pretzel...and yes! All I can do was nod my head the moment the plate entered my domain to the moment I was scraping the plate clean. The pretzel came with Bratwurst, pulled pork, cheese, and kielbasa. Now this was a meal. You can't go wrong trying any of the dishes here. If you're in town and want a fun time, look no further.
2021-03-14,3,Outstanding waiter service, atmosphere and beers. Now the bad part: Beers are a bit pricy, but fresh. The food: Very pricey for the quantity you receive.   Our roasted chicken (3 orders) was basically a full drumstick that was over cooked and dry as can be.   My veal schnitzel looked like it was from a frozen patty microwaved. Tough to cut and chew. Lacked flavor and was dry.  Other friend got the half rack of ribs. Very small portion, that was also dry with little taste.  Go for the beer, but not the food.
2021-03-09,1,Didn't even get to sit down and I was Interrogated everywhere I tired to find a place to sit. Finally sat down and was approach by a rude waitress 5 to 10 mins later who wanted my credit card before she would take my order. She treated me like I was some homeless guy going to run out on the $11 bratwurst. I own a 2/1 condo On 14th Street and was up from Austin by myself getting it ready to sell and craved a bratwurst. The place looked cool but the vibe was the worst. I ended leaving without even getting to order. Crazy way to run a business.
2021-03-09,4,First time there sat outside on a Sunday and service was horrible. Took forever to order a spiked hot chocolate and pick up a gift card. But this hidden menu item of the hot chocolate is what brought me and my friend back !! This time was  indoor seating next time on a Thursday night and different experience. Amazing customer service which was only supposed to be 2 drinks max became 6 draft ciders and one local brewed Pilsner later with 2 orders of warm pretzels with 2 kinds of dips mustard.
2021-02-28,5,Great place to grab a drink and a quick bite to eat with friends. Fun atmosphere with a great outdoor area.
2021-01-10,1,Bartender and manager did not wear masks. When my group asked for bartender to wear one since they were yelling at everyone else for it, and he was making drinks with open garnishes in front of him, he rolled his eyes and basically refused. So we got the check and promptly left..
2021-01-08,3,I was very impressed with the look and feel of this location, even in the age of Covid. I've never been to Germany or an Oktoberfest, but this is the venue I'd have pictured in my mind.I will say though that after our visit, I wouldn't recommend getting anything besides a liter of beer and sharing an appetizer like a pretzel with someone. Do not bother getting the ridiculously priced deluxe meaty pretzel. Do not bother getting the expensive schnitzel. My friends were not happy with those.I did get the pulled pork sandwich and actually would recommend that. Mainly because it was one of the cheapest options, at $13. The buns were very fresh and soft and the pork had great flavor. It could have been a bigger portion.The staff didn't seem very enthusiastic or friendly but they did manage to do their job just fine. Definitely nothing above and beyond though. Probably not a location I'd bother going back to again.
2020-12-25,1,It's probably not managements fault maybe it's the staff I dont fucking know but went to a company function which we chose to go to this place, my bill as you can see was 30.38 but my card was charged $90.39 so youll just gave youll selves a $60.01 tip. wtf
2020-12-19,4,We got delivery for an at home Oktoberfest. We wish they had a little more stuff on their menu, ex Spätzle. But the food we did get arrived fresh and warm. We really enjoyed the lobster macaroni and cheese.
2020-12-19,5,This bar does a great job with service, Covid protocols, everything. It is the best night out in Hoboken!! Amazing drinks and food
2020-12-08,4,Great place to come to hang out both indoor and outdoor during Covid times. I ordered a beef burger medium rare with everything. It was well made and it was delicious. We sat indoors with limited capacity. The indoors had lots of screen broadcasting lots of sport events. Cool! :)
2020-12-08,4,Awesome spot! They offer Trivia on tuesdays during the summer. Plentiful outdoor dining and attentive staff. Unfortunately not a lot of fun options for vegetarians but to be expected as it is a traditionally German curated menu and dining experience. There is ofcourse a wonderful selection of beers (and a few wines!) There is also lot of street/metered parking available locally which is a plus. I really enjoyed coming here and looking forward to my next visit.
2020-12-05,5,This bar is amazing and I love the fact that you can still order an octoberfest beer in december
2020-11-30,5,Pilsener Haus is a fantastic spot. It's a huge space with a lot of character, along with great beers and food. I'm really glad that local spots like this one have been able to survive in these trying times. They've got a lot of outdoor space and definitely make the most of it. Highly recommend.
2020-11-30,5,Pilsener Haus excels at creating an environment to enjoy beer and good quality beer garden food sans garden. Well spaced large beer garden tables, good sized steins and portions of food, with attentive staff and consideration. PH has adapted well to the pandemic, creating even more outdoor space with seating for upwards of 60 more patrons at tables on two sides of the venue. Outdoor heaters are available at many benches as we head into the winter months, these might be an essential item. Still thinking about those bratwursts.
2020-11-21,5,Can't say enough great things about this place. The beer garden and bar are first-rate and the inventory and ambiance are incredible. But what makes it really special is the leadership team that cares greatly about the Hoboken community. They go out of their way to support the local arts and artists, and go out of their way to remain a hub for all people trying to do something interesting and original. Make this a regular stop in your travels, and you will not regret it!
2020-11-15,3,Great Bier. Great food. Great TV layout. But the service could use some training! Server came to remove our wings bones plate... but instead of going to the other side of the table he pushed me and my date aside, literally, to wedge himself between us to remove a sauce covered cutting board full of bones. -1 I confronted him and he literally said that is the only way I could retrieve the plate-1 .......good greif
2020-11-10,1,Meh. Maybe we came on a bad night, I don't know. The hostess kept seating us with other people at the long tables even though the place was empty and there were several couples at their own long tables, oh and we are in the middle of pandemic! I pointed out that there were several couples with their own long tables but she said we couldn't have those because they were expecting a crowd due to trivia. Fine. We sat down at a little table that was shaky and I asked the waitress questions about the menu. She had no clue at all. We decided to leave. I really hope we weren't given our own table because we were the only people of color there. Everyone else was white at their own tables but for some reason the hostess didn't allow it for us. I also think your wait staff needs to have a basic understanding of the menu. We left and went to Carpe Diem instead where they were way more welcoming and nicer. I decided to walk by this place on my way home since I live nearby, there was no crowds and barely anyone there for trivia, I'm not sure what phantom crowds they were waiting for. This was around 9pm on a Tuesday.
2020-11-09,5,This used to be my favorite place in Hoboken when I was working nearby and visiting this place often. It still is! Lovely staff, huge outdoor seating, warmers in place and great food and beer. I got my usual - Kielbasa and a dark lager. Kielbasa platter came with spicy mustard and crispy fries(so good!). Never disappoints. Highly recommend this place especially now in cold winters. Get their giant pretzel if you can, it's a huge hit.
2020-11-08,4,A great place for a German meal.  Fortunately we were seated outdoors and a distance from the band because they were really LOUD and not playing authentic German music.  Nice beer selection and very generous portions.  It took awhile to get service,  but it was busy and we were in no hurry.  Be aware the appetizer pretzel is H~U~G~E.  I saw that there is now parking, for those in need, but we were walking distance and I would be sure to return when in the area.
2020-11-06,5,Pilsener Haus is great! A huge beer list with great selections, delicious food from the grill (can't go wrong with brats & fries!), and a fun, relaxed atmosphere. We've been a number of times to have drinks, eat dinner, and watch football games on their huge TVs. The outdoor patio is the best in nice weather.
2020-11-02,5,5 stars alone just for figuring out that customers needed parking. You now have access to a huge free parking lot right next to the restaurant. There's lots of indoor and outdoor dining options. There's 2 indoor bars and 1 outdoor bar. The food  is good too. Try the smokehouse wings. And if you haven't been, go during Oktoberfest and try their platters. They're pretty good as well. They could stand to add more fire pits or heat lamps since it's cold outside and covid numbers are up.
2020-10-28,4,I have only ever ordered one kind of beer here because I do not like beer very much and this particular one tastes like grapefruit soda and I love it. Please consider that fact when taking my review of a beer garden into consideration. This place is pretty great. I went here a few times when I lived close by and it was just the perfect spot. Who cares if it's crowded because it's huge inside. There is also a great little outdoor section that's expanded a ton due to Covid. I went last weekend for the first time in a long time with a group of five and got a table no problem in the parklet set up on Grand Street. It got very chilly by the end of the night but was totally fine most of the time. I wish there were some space heaters but no complaints. Okay so one pretzel, lobster mac n cheese, order of wings, and chicken sandwich later and I was full and happy. From everyone else's order, apparently the fish and chips and the brats are also pretty dang good. Everything was delicious and I was so pleasantly surprised to see that their food, not just their grapefruit beer, is great! After we ate we asked to go inside but were told to go to the front and ask the hostess for a table inside, which was a little weird. When we got there, even she was kind of confused. We were brought to a very cool upstairs section that I never knew existed (kind of like a speakeasy) and had a few more drinks up there. They have an entirely different and limited menu for that section so keep that in mind if you get seated up there. All in all, a very cool spot with very good (grapefruit) beer and surprisingly awesome food. Check 'em out!!!
2020-10-24,1,This was one of the most unprofessional places I've gone. Not only does the staff not know how to charge per drink but management is condescending when trying to justify their robbery. This is the last time I ever give them a dime. I urge anyone with a common sense of reality to avoid this place at all cost. Unless you have millions to burn avoid at all costs.
2020-10-15,5,Beat Biergarten in Hudson county. Clean. Great atmosphere. Good food. Efficient service. A place I enjoy visiting once a week with my family or friends.
2020-10-11,4,new food menu post covid - had the meat lovers pretzel - so much delicious food ! my dude had wings &a burger - both of which were delicious as well. the beer selection is finally bigger and more of avariety than it used to be. they still have the german staples but have things to please everyone else. our server whose name i don't remember (beautiful fluffy hair and 2 flower tattoos on her upper arm) was great and talked beer with us a bit even though she was busy. made sure everything came out and checked back enough. we sat outside at the front gate and a band started setting up around 4 (10/11/2020) - the guys in the band who kept strolling in and out did not have masks on at any point and they were rude towards a table with dogs next to where they were setting up in the corner. one of the dogs peed on the ground and the owner dumped water on it (they shoulda been walking the dog outside every now and then but that's another issue) and the guys in the band were mad the dog peed there and said they were gonna put the speakers facing the table and blast the music at them. super unprofessional douches.
2020-10-10,1,Went there today after 2 years since our last visit....massive disappointment....overall food quality has declined badly.....schnitzel was dry, overcooked and not veal......smoked salmon plate is about half the size of what it was.... pretzels were awesome but at $13, you would expect them to be....15 brats?..... we were a party of 10 and the service was excellent, thankfully so, since there is a 20% gouge.....used to love this place, never again....auf wiedersehen.....
2020-10-06,5,Pilsener Haus and Biergarten is a gem over in Hoboken. This is such a solid spot to come hang out and have a drink (or five) and their menu is so good. I'm obsessed with their pretzel and cheese dip. Also, knackwurst subbed in with their german potato salad is my go-to. I tried their "autumn cider" or "rum apple cider" cocktail the other night and LOVED it. For anyone who loves apple cider or mulled apple cider, this is a perfect cocktail with a lemon wedge and rum. Their list of german beers, ciders, cocktails, and eats goes on forever and you really can't go wrong with any of them. They have plenty of outdoor seating, so even if the place is packed, you'll be able to find a spot outside even from a safe distance from others. The staff here is awesome, great customer service, fantastic vibes and food, you really can't go wrong here. Give this place a try if you haven't before. 15/10 for everything.
2020-10-01,3,Food was lackluster. Their sangria was basically boxed wine. I know its a beer house but whats the point of having other drinks on the menu if there's no flavor. When we asked the server if the kitchen could toss the fries in salt and pepper she rolled her eyes, sighed, and said no. Its not like we asked her to take time out of her busy night to personally walk into the kitchen and toss the fries herselfWould not recommend. Unless you really really love sports and beer then you might have a good time here. Best of luck
2020-09-30,4,Such a great spot in Hoboken to kick back and enjoy a few beers. During my first visit we came in on a hot summer day. It was nice to have the mist fans to cool you off as you walk in (definitely a nice surprise lol), and the outdoor space was dog-friendly which is something I can always get behind. Its the perfect spot to hang out with a group of friends, but I also noticed families with children enjoying the space too.Fast-forward to COVID times, the outdoor space has definitely been more appreciated. The staff is also incredibly attentive, and needless to say, their beer selection is excellent.Haven't tried the food here yet, but looking forward to it.
2020-09-24,5,We had a friends birthday party here this past weekend and it was fun! Service was good and the place was pretty packed both inside and out- we got their early to grab a table! (Around 12ish- Highly recommend for large groups!) We ordered pretzels for the table - delicious and some people ordered food separately! Food looked delicious and fresh! I love the experience here and would recommend-  support local!!
2020-09-11,5,Great seating outside with big tables and good service. Had amazing brats and they even had malt vinegar for the fries--which were delicious! Definitely want to come back when less busy and relax with a Bulmers and watch the game.
2020-09-06,4,Love this spot! Heard they have good deals on tuesdays and thursdays. They also have really nice outdoor seating for COVID and they limit 8 people per table. It's always a great time here and they have a good drink selection as well. One downside is that the bathrooms aren't that clean. Other than that they have good food options and you'll have a great overall experience
2020-08-09,5,One of my fav places in Hoboken. The service is great. Live music and beer, a pretty chill place
2020-07-30,4,Yum! Get the kielbasa, potato pancakes, giant pretzel - they are all good! I'm glad this place is open, it reminds me of food in Europe. Skip the pierogi, though, seems like the frozen supermarket kind.
2020-07-29,5,New ownership owns! Beers on tap were great tasting, cold, and refreshing as hell! The new owner even came over and offered us a free can of beer that was brewed to help front line workers. Great experience. Good times. Keep it up!!
2020-07-18,2,Apparently new owner/ management.  Did not honor half price Tuesday special even though it is on their NEW website.Manager: No but thank you for pointing out it is on the website.Me: huh?I like this place and have been here many other times. But it was not one of those nights I felt like a $12 pretzel and a $15 Brat. Beer is not cheap here and $8 for something that is not a pint is pushing it in Hoboken.It is still on the website so looks a bit like bait and switch.
2020-07-04,5,Beer is good sausage is good hamberger is good clean and good service and and and... everythings good
2020-07-02,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken to chill and have some snacks. Pretzels are great. During COVID, the pickup experience has been perfect. The employees take extra precautions and sanitizer what they touch and even offered me wipes for my credit card! If you're nearby please come support this business.
2020-06-06,5,Great food and amazing service. Would absolutely come back. Free pretzels with drinks. Food is plenty and great.
2020-05-23,5,My favorite place in Hoboken! The atmosphere here is always great and the food is incredible. Before the pandemic I especially liked to come on Tuesdays for the half price deal. Even though I've ordered takeout I can't wait to come back here in person.
2020-04-18,5,Ordered pick-up during COVID-19, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The staff went ABOVE & BEYOND, plus the food was amazing as usual. Thankful for businesses like Pilsner Haus in Hoboken even during the worst of times.
2020-03-23,5,Amazingly delicious food and definitely satisfied my craving for sausages. I ordered the currybrats (yum) and kielbasa with cucumber salad (soooooo good). Please support local restaurants!
2020-03-08,5,Always have a great time here! Awesome food. Attentive Staff. Good management & fun family events and live music, trivia and specials!Highly recommend!!
2020-02-21,3,Came here for a drink after going out for brunch. Lots of options. Definitely big for their Sunday brunch because the place got packed!
2020-02-03,4,Nice and spacious beer garden with a solid selection of bottles and drafts. Seating is first-come-first-serve and weekends can get PACKED. Be prepared for the possibility that you might not be able to find a seat immediately - I found this surprising since the place is pretty large and the location is further out of the main Hoboken area, but that just speaks to how popular this place this is.Had a fun time here hanging out with friends. Food is also tasty - we loved snacking on the fries and the giant Bavarian pretzel!
2020-01-31,1,Ugly loud music.Limited sort of junk food.Good beer.Just because YELP requires write a long review l have to write something...
2020-01-26,3,We are regulars and absolutely loved this place. Service is stellar and the staff are super kind. But we came back for the first time today and it seems the menu has changed -- and gone up in price -- quite a bit. We got the $16 charred octopus starter, which was literally one small piece of octopus and an anemic looking salad. Gone are also the fish and chips and other bigger entrees. Short rib is $28 and very small too. Would love to see this place revert back to its winning formula of affordable, good food!
2020-01-23,2,What did they do ? No more veal schnitzel - chicken is now the only option  ... in fact the whole menu changed - totally disappointing !    Nothing like the place of a  year ago. Very sad
2020-01-21,3,It is with a heavy heart that I write this post but it is based solely on the new menu.  My husband and I have been huge local supporters since the day the doors first opened. We constantly brag to everyone about how authentic it is after being to Germany numerous times and comparing it. We are so disappointed with the new menu and that most authentic dishes like the goulash, schnitzel (now chicken), beef stew and specials like pork knuckle are no more. Yes the beer menu, pretzel and grill remain (changed fries too!) but we are so underwhelmed with the rest. The wings remind us of Chinese food and you can get those same exact potato pancakes at Trader Joe's for 1.99$. Would love the old menu to come back as we love going here and feeling like we are truly in a German beer garden.
2020-01-17,4,Solid place to hang out with friends. The outdoor seating is a nice touch, but there is surprisingly a lot of room inside as well. Tons of beer options and the small plates are tasty.
2020-01-09,4,Huge space! Huge beer selection & great food! The pretzel & cheese never disappoints. It's nice to try a different beer each time you come since the list is so long. It gets super packed making it hard to get a table for the whole group, we ended up standing most of the night. The outside is nice with the fire heat lamps. I really enjoyed the grapefruit Hefeweizen until I read that it was basically juice at 3.5%. I then switched to santas little helper a stout & continued with stouts the remainder of the night.
2019-12-15,5,The burgers and sausages from the grill are really good! Great quality of beers and drinks there! Everything they serve from the kitchen is really good too! I highly recommend this place to anyone to come thru to check it out.
2019-11-29,1,Terrible service by a manager named James Williams don't come here unless you're looking for an argument!
2019-11-18,5,Easy and big, fun for families and lots of options of draft beer and brats.  Their pretzel and the beer cheese is always on point and delish. Also. Try the beer mussels as they are perfectly seasoned and tender.
2019-10-30,5,Having been to Germany for Oktoberfest many times, this establishment is the closest you will find to an actual centuries old beer hall in Europe.  They did a phenomenal job with the interior design and layout of this place.  The exterior garden area is a joy in good weather  and can not be beat.  The Bier choices are plentiful and everyone is sure to find something to fit their respective pallets.You would think that something had to give when you have great ambiance and stellar beirs but the food is amazing.  You must order the big pretzel.  IT IS A MUST HAVE.
2019-10-14,4,Came here for the first time during brunch time yesterday, and loved it! We were able to get seats outside, which was nice. Gotta get that Vitamin D.We shared the wiener schnitzel, soft pretzel, bratwurst, chicken & pork sausage, the potato pancakes (had towait until after 3:30 to get these, since they're not on the brunch menu), and everyone in our party got the Schofferhofer Grapefruit beer.They have great and very accommodating service. Because we sat outside our Grapefruit beers attracted fruit flies that ended up drowning in the beer. Our server was more than happy to switch the beers out, and brought us coasters to protect our beers. Not sure if there was a promotion going on but we got our sausage platters half off, which was amazing. I think they do this on football Sundays. Overall the food was pretty good, and we had a good time here!
2019-10-09,4,Came here around Oktoberfest, a little after dinner time. Place was packed. They have outdoor and indoor seating and one bar inside. They don't allow you to buy a drink from the bar and bring it to the table. If you're sitting you have to order from the server and there is an order minimum. There was a live band when we went which was pretty cool. Gave them 4 stars because the front of the restaurant, close to where the bathrooms are, smelled like sewage.
2019-10-04,1,We have been coming to this place for the past several years. My fiancé had a terrible experience the last time we came and never wanted to step foot in the place again. On that occasion, the waiter overcharged our card and when we wanted to correct the bill, they made us wait 30 minutes before they would put the credit back on our card. But last night, I really wanted to go back since I had missed the grilled meats from the back and wanted to watch the baseball/football games on the screen. Needless to say, my experience has now left me in the same ballpark as my fiancé. I don't know if management has changed or if they are having financial difficulty, but this is not the same restaurant that it used to be. .
2019-09-21,4,Came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. The space was great, the bartender was friendly, and the selection of beers, ciders, etc was solid. (They even had White Claw!) overall, it was a great place, but the DJ was... frustrating to say the least. He kind of ruined the overall vibe, but we tried to make the best of it.
2019-09-20,4,Had we not been able to secure seats on one of the picnic benches outside, we would've had to leave & this review wouldn't exist; the ear splitting racket inside was probably the loudest enclosed space I have ever been in, no exaggeration. There are two sides of the menu: grill & rotisserie items must be ordered inside; appetizers & entrees, we were able to order from our waiter outside. We tried a refreshing pineapple cider; a side of German potato salad which had a strong mustardy kick; rotisserie chicken & fries which went great with bbq sauce; & kielbasa which I didn't have but my dining partners said was flavorful without being overly salty. In the September evening warmth, the patio was perfection with a game projected onto the brick building & revelers hoisting up giant liter mugs of beer. Looks like everyday is Oktoberfest at Pilsener Haus & Biergarten! Prost!
2019-09-20,5,I really enjoy this place! It's a fantastic size- which means when the rest of the bars are jammed and exploding at the seams in Hoboken, this place has just as many people and you can actually move/breathe and retain your personal space. The outside Biergarten is nice and has those igloo bubbles in the winter time. The inside has a spacious restaurant portion with delicious food! The bar portion is pretty large with a huge amount of seating. If you come later on and the restaurant side is closed, there's a grill still going on the bar side. The grilled up late night offerings are fantastic! I have no idea who their DJ on Saturday nights is, but he's excellent! The music is fun, relatable, singable, danceable and really well mixed. I never really pay attention to bar music, but here it's just fantastic where I actually want to stay to listen! The bouncers/ bartenders/ staff are friendly and helpful. I would definitely suggest stopping by for a fun night out!
2019-09-19,5,This place is great! My husband and I love coming here for their half off tuesdays. They always have a great selection of of beers and ciders and the food is always great. They switched the food menu up and took some things off that we specifically like to get every time we go. The service is great. Everyone is really nice. The bartender Andrew is the one who usually takes care of us and he is great. Always a great conversationalist and is always on top of whatever we need. Great place, great food, great service. I recommend this place to anyone who passes Hoboken.
2019-09-17,4,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best nights by far as beers and appetizers go down to half price (which is insane, because the portions are generous and the quality is good). They recently added new items to their menu, all of which are fantastic. They also have seasonal drafts, many of which are imported and hard to find elsewhere. For the first two years that I lived in Hoboken I never came here because it was far from Washington Street, I regret that, this place is definitely worth the walk. Though Hoboken has a good number of fast-casual restaurants and a greater number of cheap sports bars, the biggest gap in the market is for quality sit-down food and drink (Amanda's also springs to mind but is rather pricey). As for demerits? There are barely any: the volume of the restaurant can get quite loud (but you can still talk to people, which is more than I can say for most bars), there are rather a lot of (albeit, lovely) TVs playing even though most nights people are there for the food/drink and not for sports, and service gets kind of slow at times (you may wait 15 minutes to get an order taken or to get the check). Overall, a great place to go eat. On Tuesdays/Thursdays I sometimes cross the river just to come here with friends.
2019-09-10,1,Update: new menu is atrocious. Went from authentic homestyle food to "gastro pub" style options. Seems like an attempt to be hip or trendy. Pretty disappointed, my wife and I used to love it and now she has nothing to eat (vegetarian).
2019-09-07,2,New menu is awful.  They've changed from pork to chicken cutlets, and dropped the cucumber salad from the dish.  They also dropped a few of the German dishes and replaced with attempt to be fancy dishes.  The menu was always on the higher end, but with these changes I def won't be back.
2019-09-01,3,Beware, as of Wednesday, 8/28/19, the MENU HAS CHANGED. This used to be a favorite of our for German fare; however, the new menu no longer features much of anything German. Instead, classics like kaesespaetzle have been replaced by shishito peppers and branzino.
2019-08-30,5,Love this place! The kielbasa and pretzels are amazing! Their French toast for brunch is sooo good! Great vibe and food prices. They are kid friendly which is great (that ramp is my toddler's favorite thing ever!) and they have live music the last Sunday of the month during brunch. My favorite new spot in Hoboken!
2019-08-28,5,We went for brunch but will definitely have to go back for dinner!  We had the French toast which was cooked to perfection. I am not a French toast fan but I am hooked!  We also ordered the bratwurst which was amazing!  I drove past here so many times and never saw it!  It is a hidden gem that transports you to Germany once you step through the doors! I ordered the grapefruit beer-don't knock it til you try it! Refreshing and perfect for a warm summer day. Can't wait to go back.
2019-08-25,4,ive been here tons of times for large groups of friends getting together - lots of seats, indoor and outdoor. the drinks and food have continued to improve since they opened. i just went this weekend and our waitress was great with our large group, including peoples children who are welcomed and they accommodated. only thing i feel i need to say - and i dont even have kids, but i witnessed the struggle all day with parents there- is this: you guys really need a damn changing table. for a place where so many people bring their kids, how has this not been taken care of yet???
2019-08-20,5,It took me 4 years to finally get to the Pilsener Haus and I wish I could've come sooner. This place is awesome! Authentic German feel, delicious food, refreshing drinks, and friendly service! If I lived nearby I'd be here every weekend! Highly recommend!
2019-08-16,5,I love Biergarten!This place brings me back to Germany - love that it's a very large spot with ample seating and a true German vibe. They have an amazing selection of beers and ciders and tons of TVs. It's the perfect spot for big groups to hang out. For food, the pretzel is HUGE and comes with cheese sauce and mustard. I can honestly say it's better than Germany - the ones there are rock hard and this is soft, fresh and delicious! The bratwurst is also AMAZING. Make sure you bring cash if you're interested in the sausage - it's in a separate grill area and they don't take cards.Whether you come for dinner, mid-day Saturday/Sunday or for nightlife, you're guaranteed to have a good time!
2019-08-05,3,I love the atmosphere here, the building is awesome and the outdoor garden area is so nice! They have a nice selection of draft beers as well as appetizers, keep in mind if you decide to get anything from the grill you have to walk to the kitchen area to order and pay separately! Will return, love to sit outside and have a cold beer!
2019-08-05,1,We ordered through GrubHub at 6:04 p.m. Our dinner of burgers and fries was supposed to be delivered within 40-50 minutes. After 1 hour 10 minutes, we got a call from the restaurant informing us that they had some "glitch with our tablet," and our food was only just now on the grill, and would take another 10-15 minutes. OK. The food showed up after another 1 hour 15 minutes, cold, without an apology or even a drop of ketchup to go with the burgers. This was our Sunday evening to relax after a 6-day week. For some people, there is a huge difference between eating a heavy meal at 7 p.m. or at 8:30. Mistakes and glitches happen. It's all about how you make it up to the customer afterwards. A savvy business would have enclosed a coupon, a treat on the house, something to apologize and make up for the ridiculous delay. Instead, they threw a bag of cold food at us, not even bothering with a standard condiment, never mind an apology. Restaurants are hospitality businesses. Pilsener Haus's customer service is about as hospitable as their cold, oversalted fries. Never again. Absolutely never again.
2019-07-30,5,How can something I've never tried before be so heart warming on the first go? Spaetzel at Pilsner Haus is an absolute cant miss- whether you pair this egg noodle with chicken or schnitzel, it doesn't matter! So buttery and delicious. Half off both food and drink on Tuesdays if you pay cash.
2019-07-23,4,The food is stupid good. No question the best bratwurst I've ever had in my life. Beer selection was pretty solid as well. However... what is the deal with the kitchen vs grill vs bar situation here? Went in on a Monday. Some menu items from grill are available but kitchen is closed. Makes you feel like they are two separate businesses since you pay separately. I just never heard of only half of a menu available because it's Monday. Regardless, whatever the kitchen/grill schedule, it's all great food.
2019-07-21,3,This WAS my favorite place to come for a beer, good food and laughs. The place has changed. The service time is not sharp no more. I will still recommend the place but the service needs to change.
2019-06-23,3,Went here for the first time. Overall I liked the place, but don't understand what they have a wait staff  and then a self serviceWe ordered from both while the food ordered from the wait staff was efficient the grill took forever and ever!!If you want self service do itIf you have a waiter, then let them do the entire order Don't understand why the grill is so slow, they were only booking hamburgers and they weren't even busyBut all said, I would go back
2019-06-20,1,I planned my fiancé's 30th birthday at the Hoboken Biergarten.  I spoke to David over the phone about the party and we originally wanted reserved tables.  David actually talked us out of it because of the cost to reserve the table, and said just show up and reserve your own tables.  I had told him that I was bringing a cake from an outside bakery and he said they would charge a storage and cake cutting fee.  I was fine with all of that.  He then said when you get your server tell them "David said bring me beer".  Over the phone this was a great start.However the day of the actual party was something completely different.  When we arrived there were reserved tables for my party inside. The waitress also told me that the entire party had to go under one credit card because "It is too much work to divide checks for the group of people you have".  I was going to be responsible for paying that entire tab and to ask my guests for money on what they ate and drank.  I had told our waitress that this was not what I discussed with David.  I was passed along to another manager and he was accommodating and let us have it just like how David had said.  Once that was taken care of I had told our waitress that David had promised us complimentary beer.  Before I could even finish my sentence she had said "yes I know about your free beer" in a very sarcastic attitude.  After that our waitstaff was rude and started to get sarcastic with the guests in my party.  I had numerous people come to me and say they are being so sarcastic and rude.  It was almost like they were mad they had to work on Memorial Day weekend.Once the party started to die down I had asked that they bring out the cake I brought in.  It was cut and placed on the table.  There was leftover slices as well as part of the cake.  I had told the waitress to put the leftover cake along with the leftover slices in the fridge and I would come get it when I was done.  At the end of the night I went to the bar to ask for the cake.  She only brought me the one section of the cake but forgot all of the extra slices.  I asked about the extra slices and she came back and said, "Oh we can't find them".  I was so pissed off that I just left.  I am on my way home in my uber on the turnpike when I get a call saying that they found my cake and that I would have to come back to get it.  I went absolutely nuts on the phone because of the entire day and now this incident.  I wrote David an email and waited for his response.David responded a day or two later and said I'm going to go talk to my staff and then get back to you.  I was 100% honest of how I reacted on the phone and he agreed with me that he would be very upset as well if he were in my position.I waited for two days and no call or email from David.  Finally I get an email and he said that he would buy me dinner at the restaurant.  When I saw this I was very upset and told David that I did not want to come back to the restaurant and I just wanted my money back.  I did not receive a reply.  I had to call him and David all of the sudden tried to play mr. tough guy over the phone. "Oh what can I do for ya". I said "I said well I'm not satisfied with how you handled this David".  David said he spoke to his staff and apparently none of what I said was true and my guests were out of line.  He then said Dinner on him was completely fair.  Then started to give me attitude and talk over me when I had finally said "DAVID YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME!  All I want is the money for my cake back!"  David goes ok no problem I just need you to come back in, or send me a picture of your bill, or your credit card.  I told him I did not have the receipt from that night and he said well then send me your credit card and I'll take off that charge.  I said I don't feel comfortable sending over my credit card to him based off of this entire situation.  David then goes on to say he's a business man and that's how stuff is normally handled!So I'm gonna text a picture of my credit card to the guy who couldn't deliver a simple message to his staff about my party and the same guy who lost my my cake? A very unprofessional business man makes a request like this not a seasoned one. DO NOT BOOK YOUR NEXT PARTY HERE!So Long story short I was out of line for bringing over 25+ people to your restaurant and having them all spend hundreds of dollars on food and alcohol and then in the end you steal my cake which I paid for from another bakery and paid you to cut it?!?!?  Then I get upset when you don't deliver on anything that you promised?!?!? I sound really out of line don't I? David if you see this you have my number if you want to make this right?  Once again how did my cake taste?
2019-06-19,2,One bartender one barback, and 3 servers on a Wednesday. Our group of 5 had 2 beers at the bar before finding a table to sit at, at which point we sat around for over an hour waiting to place an order for food and more drinks; we eventually left and went somewhere else.
2019-06-16,3,Wait staff seemed impatient for a place that wasn't crowded at all.... there's food you can order and food you have to walk up and order yourself as well as grabbing your own utensils and condiments (which idk why the tip jar is there to watch someone cook your food) but the kitchen staff does that everywhere...  hmmm great beer which gives it the 3 star, and the setup is very athletically pleasing very cute, open picnic style tables and outdoor beer garden.... I'd go back to the beer garden to try it out again!
2019-06-10,4,Beer selection is over-whelming if you love beer, you must come here. As a novice I didn't know where to begin. Def. needed a beginner's guide to order here lolFood selection is diverse plenty of german options with typical bar food as wellPretzel was huge! Soft with a great dipping sauce on the side.Steak tar-tar was OKSausage sampler is a must! Great variety and cooked to perfection.None of the tables had back support, all picnic tables so very uncomfortable Place gets loud at night
2019-06-02,4,This place is so much fun. They have good variety of German beers and pretzel is very delicious. It's very spacious so you wouldn't worry that you cannot find a seat. One thing I was disappointed about is when we seated outside, one waitress helped us order and never brought back our beer. We waited for at least 20min just for the beer.
2019-06-01,5,Went for a Friday evening drinks with a few friends after a long day and this place didn't disappoint us. Summer hangout for our tribe. Loved the beers and the atmosphere!
2019-05-27,5,My friends and I love this spot. Plenty of beer options and great food. The grilled bratwurst and kielbasa are my favorite. The servers are friendly and check in with the customers at a good pace.
2019-05-18,5,Was nostalgic about Germany and visited this place during a happy hour (it was probably the entire day of happy hour). Nice food, really good beer and an authentic atmosphere. Recommend to everyone!
2019-05-13,5,Very interesting and very Germany setting.Kitchen is not open on Monday, so still open, just can not order anything from the menu, but u can still have grill though. Sausage.Having a hard time reading menus.Really do not know why they r.Still. Funny place .
2019-05-09,4,Pretty cool place! Omg was it packed when we got there. Sooo many ppl it was hard to find a table for our whole group. We ended up smushing on a bench. We ordered a large beer and it was very good beer! My friend ordered a Bavarian pretzel and it was delicious. If the grill wasn't cash only, I would have ordered something from there!! Great atmosphere very casual and fun.
2019-05-08,3,We moved to the area about a year ago and have been here three times since then. The first time was a weekday and it was great. Service was friendly, food is delicious and I love the vibe. We have now been for brunch on Sunday twice and that is the reason for my three stars. The first Sunday brunch was fine. It was insanely busy around noon and fair warning, if you do not like kids, do not go at this time. It is full blown baby brunch with kids running around in spite of all the signs and warnings to parents to keep them from doing so since it is such an open space with sharp edges and hot stoves. We had to flag down our server but once we did, she was great, beer came fast and our food as well which is delicious. I really loved the deconstructed lox and cream cheese!The second Sunday brunch was the same with the babies and the lack of a server. We waited next to another guest waiting. He finally got the attention of our server who we later found out was named Alex. Alex took the guy's order and then held up a finger to me to wait as he went back to the table behind us instead of just taking our order. I was a server in busy restaurants for 15 years, I get it. However, take the whole table and then move. The guy and the woman behind us got their beers. We waited. And waited. Finally, after attempting to get Alex, we got the attention of another server. We told her we were waiting on drinks and she said the bar was backed up. I told her the people who ordered at the same time got their beers. She said she'd check and came back two seconds later with our beers losing their heads. They had been sitting there at the service bar for at least ten minutes and Alex never brought them. Our food came: it was great. The croque madame type sandwich is amazing. Alex never came back. We finished and finally waved him down and when we did, he greeted the couple newly seated next to us and introduced himself which is how we knew his name. We really like this place however Sunday brunch I have some tips. We got there at 1pm which is about an hour I think after it opens. There were two servers and a full room. Around 1:30-2pm it seems the swing shift came on and there were more servers. I really want to go back but I can't keep going and having a two hour brunch because I am flagging down servers just to order. Maybe add some more servers earlier? It seems it is ALWAYS crowded Sunday mornings so that would definitely help both the guests and the servers. Also, as a former server, we were very disappointed with our third experience and the fact we never got even the slightest attention. It was clear the others around us felt the same, having to go grab Alex for everything they needed.Food is great, service is usually good. Sunday brunch...beware the babies!
2019-05-05,4,If you're looking to have a beer with friends and maybe catch the game, this place is perfect. The bench seating is great for large parties and the drink service is fast. The staff know a lot about the different beers so don't be afraid to ask. If you're craving some food inside there is a cash only section with tons of cool bratwurst and fries. Definitely try the wurst! Skip the fries and get a pretzel. We ended up there on a Saturday night and the place was packed but there was lots of seating options, so long as you don't mind sharing a table. The music was a mix of old school hip hop and more recent stuff. Speakers were super loud so if your looking to chat you're going to want to sit outside or away from the main bar. All in all a great place to go if you're looking for a good vibe with good snacks.Will be back for another round for sure!
2019-05-02,5,Awesome selection of beers! Wish they opened a little earlier for happy hour! Really has an authentic, historic beer hall setting. Clean and the staff is really nice!
2019-04-29,2,Pretty disappointing. I understand the whole seat yourself , but when you sit down at 2:20 and then the waitress doesn't come until 3pm and the beers don't arrive until 3:25pm... it left a sour taste. The atmosphere seemed cool and the food smelled great, but it was a complete dud of an afternoon. Unfortunately an hour was wasted for 2 beers.
2019-04-24,5,What a fun place.  We went on a Monday night which is also complimentary wing night.  (4 pieces each but hey it's free)  They have a covered outdoor seating as well as indoors with picnic style tables and of course seating at the bar.   You can order food but I believe it was cash only the night we went.  Bratwurst, burgers, chicken, pretzels etc.  We didn't order any food so I can't tell you if it's good or not.  The review is for the beer selection and bar service.  We had an AWESOME bartender, wish I remembered his name.  He gave us a 'beer 101' on most of the tap they offered that night and samplings.  Explained to us why beer should always have the foam when served.  Will definitely be back!
2019-04-05,4,I never really find myself in Hoboken, but I did the other day and I will say this is a pretty cool beer garden. Great space carved out of an old factory of some sort. Good beer selection and the food, while not the best German food ever, was decent. Friendly staff.
2019-04-02,4,Great place to hang out in northern Hoboken. The drinks are not pricy at all and on weekends there's live music. We went with a group of 15-20 and were able to grab one of the long tables inside with no problem.
2019-03-22,5,Great casual spot in Hoboken. I've been here a few times now, and each time we are met with great, friendly servers, good food and drink, and a fun time. The big long picnic style tables make it easy it seat a large party or to find a spot to squeeze into on a crowded night. You might even make some new friends. There is also an outdoor area that is utilized in the summer, as well as the winder when they put out igloos. On Tuesday's they have an "on the haus" deal, where if you pay for your bill in cash it's half off!
2019-03-03,5,This is a great place to get together with a bunch of people! Such a large place for being in Hoboken, and love the atmosphere here. Good priced drinks and the food is surprisingly amazing. GET THE PRETZEL! Have been back twice since my first time being there and will keep going back!
2019-03-03,4,Ate here many times. Today I had the big pretzel with their cheese type spread and mustard as an appetizer. It always hits the spot and due to the massive butter on it always taste amazing. I also had bratwurst and fries. The bratwurst is hard to mess up. I was happy. I believe on Tuesdays they have half price cash only on most items and beers.
2019-03-02,5,Always love this place - fantastic rustic atmosphere, good German food and a ton of options for drinks - even ciders and wine for those who aren't a big fan of beer. Can get noisy and way too many strollers during the day but otherwise can't beat this place for a fun group gathering. Prost!
2019-02-27,4,Love it when the hood delivers. The food is always good the service always attentive and friendly and the beer ice cold. The atmosphere is lively without being intrusive. It's the perfect place for some pre gaming or even to finish up the night. Minus 1 star for the messy bathroom over the weekend. It literally looked like a truck stop.
2019-02-25,4,Year-round Oktoberfest pretzels that are the best anywhere in the New York metro area and liter sized fresh tap beer
2019-02-23,4,This is a great place to gather with friends. Huge picnic tables, awesome giant pretzels with a scrumptious cheese spread and mustard. Also I recommend the kielbasa. Cooked perfectly and flavorful. Bring cash for that because you order that from a separate area. Considering how packed it was on a Saturday afternoon, I had to forgive our waitress for not being too attentive. If you're lucky enough to snag an outdoor igloo:geodesic structure, it's a great way to enjoy being outdoors without freezing. I recommend this Bierhaus for a fun place to have a drink and good eats. I was a little disappointed that they didn't charge me the right amount for the Yelp check-in price for the 1/2 liter of their signature beer but we waited so long for our bill, I had to go and didn't get it fixed. :-(
2019-02-23,3,This place is a cool place. I walked in and was impressed. Outside they have over rated igloos. The reason for three stars is I couldn't drink the night I went for medical reasons so I order and unsweetened ice tea. I got a refill also. The bill came and my ice tea intake cost me 10 bucks. Ice tea is basically drinking water. So 5 bucks for a tea. I can understand that. It's and expensive place 5 bucks is a bit high but whatever. The problem is if you're going to charge 5 bucks for flavored water don't charge me for refills. I mentioned it to the waitress that it was odd and she got another woman (who didn't introduce herself as the manager so idk who she is). The came in and told me "I only work her so idk what to tell you. It comes out of a fountain."  I was confused. All together nice place just if you don't drink alcohol expect to still experience the same price for nonalcoholic drinks.
2019-02-19,5,An awesome aesthetic with even more awesome food and drinks. Their beer selection is so extensive! I'm a picky beer drinker, and I was able to fall in love with 2 options they had on draft. I would definitely recommend any ciders they might have, I'm yet to taste one I don't like.My friends and I love heading here on a Tuesday night - if you pay with cash, almost everything on the menu is HALF OFF! It's an incredible deal for some incredible food, and their portions are enormous.
2019-02-17,1,The beer is good. I'll start off by saying that the beer is good.Unfortunately the staff is so disrespectful. Be careful, you are going to receive subpar service. I would not recommend this place if you are looking to throw and event or private party. As a group, you and your friends should find a place more accommodating.When we escalated our issues to management our concerns were met with hate.Not a welcoming place for humans.
2019-02-10,4,Arrived around 12 on Sunday noon with a friend. This is my first time visiting this restaurant and I was actually amazed by how much space it got. The place quickly got filled up and we are luck to secure ourselves a seat. We had the Pilsener traditional and a cider on tap. The drinks are amazing and it's great amount of beer. The server is really friendly and checking with us to make sure that everything is alright. We ordered sausage from the counter directly. Please remember it is cash only!!! So make sure you have some cash. We have ordered the polish sausage platter and also a chicken sausage. The polish sausage is really good, juicy and crispy at the same time. My friend has ordered the chicken sausage, which is good. But I have to be honest since I definitely love the polish one way better. The platter comes with fries and also sour cabbage. The portion is pretty good at the restaurant and the overall vibe makes me feel I am at Germany. In addition, they have big projector screens for sports and definitely a great place for sports event. Probably will try to visit this place again in the future just to try more beer and also other sausage options.
2019-01-25,5,I loved it here!Loved what they did and what they have to offer.They have huge picnic style seating and the look and feel of this place is wicked cool.The beer is Rock solid and so was the food. If you are wundring if you should go their I would say hell ja
2019-01-17,4,This place is great and massive which makes it the perfect spot to post up and hang with friends or family or anyone. They have live music sometimes and there are no shortage of TVs if you'd like to watch a big game. Great vibes and energy all around.As you would expect, there are a ton of beer options here. Considering the high quality of some of their beers, I thought the prices were extremely reasonable. If you're not into beer there are other options but they're far more limited. As far as food, if you're trying to eat light and healthy there isn't a ton of choice, however the food they serve is delicious. The variety of sausages are all delicious and really reasonable. Everything I've tried has been good!My only real gripe is less about the Pilsner Haus and more about the clientele. During daytime and earlier evening hours there are many young families with a TON of little kids. Many are well behaved but sometimes parents just let them run around with minimal supervision. This makes me feel bad for the waiters and waitresses as they already have a tough enough job without having to navigate around little kids. It's also distracting for those of us who are just trying to go out and have fun in an adult environment. It's not a really big deal though and usually isn't too bad. Looking forward to my next visit here - it's always a great time and one of the best places in Hoboken to bring a group together!
2019-01-06,1,I frequented quite a bit of times over the years and have always been happy.  My last visit with many friends will be my last.  YOU CANT DRINK OUTSIDE ANYMORE which we were looking forward to while having a cigar.  The 'DJ' was setup with turn table but was only playing whole songs from start to end. The website did not have any music type selected for the night. Frequenting often I know they play ALOT of hip-hop which Im fine with but it was 90's hip-hop. After several songs and hearing no variety I asked if it could be simply 'changed up' and 'DJ' (Matthew Tyler) said he's playing what he's told to play by the manager. I spoke to the manager and asked if the music could be 'changed up' as nobody was dancing or feeling the music at all. Both were mindless useless drones not in tune with the patrons. Music era or genre was never changed.Our first weekend in the new year listening to 30 year old songs killed our moods! WAKE UP MANAGEMENT!
2018-12-22,1,Don't go here. We had a very weird experience and will not be coming back. It's a "seat yourself" place and most of the "open" seats were next to people who refused to move their pile of coats/hats/handbags, so we ended up sitting outside under plastic domes. It took forever for the server to come, and when she did she was upset with us because we didn't order alcohol. She then demanded a credit card and ID which she said the restaurant required to "put a name on the table". She kept my credit card and pic ID until we paid at the end of the meal. I've NEVER heard of a restaurant doing that, and I've traveled all over the world. The food was very boring and tasted like it was pre made from a package. For example the pretzel cheese was extremely garlic laden and overly salty. At the end of the meal we asked for the check when another restaurant employee came in, tapped aggressively on the table top and demanded we leave by 7pm (it was 6:10). We told him we were waiting on the check. He said there was a reservation at 7 and we "better be out by then". At that point we were so glad to leave - it was the weirdest experience we've ever had. Will never go back there.
2018-12-16,2,I don't suggest coming here with a group of people. The food and drinks are great, but the staff can't keep track of what was ordered and tried to overcharge us $100+. It was clear that they made a mistake on every single item on the bill, so we asked to speak with a manager. He was very condescending and immediately said that we would not be receiving a free meal even if we try. The bill was clearly wrong, and the cameras proved it, and even after he checked the cameras, he was slow to apologize for how he handled the situation, and tried to blame the mistake on a "glitch in the system", which at that point, I found very hard to believe.
2018-12-16,5,This is my go-to spot on Tuesday nights for the half off deal. If you pay with cash on Tuesdays, the food and drinks are half off. Even though it's a beer garden, they're food is delicious. I will sometimes go just to eat and not even get a drink.
2018-12-09,4,So fun with groups, especially in the warmer months! Great selection of beers and can never go wrong with a giant soft pretzel. Sometimes the wait can be annoying for a good spot during peak times but it's one of the larger venues in the area!
2018-12-08,3,This is my 4th visit and in the last 2 visits, I brought my own German, so I can confirm the food is great. Highly recommend the kasespatzle and bread pudding. But the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of the terrible service on my last visit, a birthday get-together with the gang (6 people). My last server was Sherri and she was so disinterested in serving, it ruined my overall experience, for which I was charged more than I should have been because she simple didn't care to split our bill as requested, so gratuity was automatically added when I shouldn't have been, and there was a mixup with our beers and she didn't care. Ugh. Nickle and diming bullsh_t. Anyway, avoid Sherri. Eat at the bar.
2018-11-28,5,Me and friends come here pretty frequently. We've been here days/nights/week days/weekends for multiple reasons. One thing that has up keep coming back is the Wednesday night trivia at 8pm with Quizzaholics. It's a great hump day excuse to get out and have a few drinks with friends and it's free to play. $31 for a bottle of Pinot Grigio you can't beat that. My favorite thing to eat is definitely the German pretzels and potato pancakes, however the brussel sprouts are AH-MAZING.
2018-11-12,5,Been here before, but went with my boyfriend recently for date night. Pilsener Haus is definitely one of my more favorite restaurants in Hoboken. It's a large biergarten that's a little off the beaten path, but it's spacious, warm and social, with lots of places to just hang out, and of course, watch sports. They even have live music!My boyfriend and I came through and immediately sat at a smaller long table. Since this is a biergarten, you're going to get SEVERAL beer menus (tap, bottle, can and special). However, this is not your average Hoboken bar, and they really do lean into the biergarten theme by providing a wide variety of both interesting craft beers (think Kane/North Coast, not Lagunitas/Goose Island) as well as interesting Czech, German, and European beers all served in their traditional glassware. In fact, my boyfriend and I went with the latter (Aventinus for him, Steigl for me, and we both thought ours was the better choice). Service was attentive and friendly throughout the night.The Austro-Hungarian biergarten theme extends well into the food. You have their grill station with all kinds of bratwurst, traditional dishes like sauerbraten and spaetzle, and of course, giant pretzels with mustard. Naturally, my boyfriend and I ordered the giant pretzel, which came with pickles, brown mustard and Liptauer cheese. The pretzel was BIG, with a soft, fluffy consistency perfect for ripping apart and dipping into the spicy cheese dip and the savory mustard. The pickles were sour, and provided a nice acidity to the rest of the dish. Delicious all around.Overall, a must-go in Hoboken, and well worth the trek.
2018-11-12,5,Fantastic al fresco biergarten on the outskirt of hoboken. It's humongous with sittings available inside and outside, so whatever suits you. Even inside, they have some individual tables and also long communion tables by the food stations where they sell all different types of sausages and other types of food. We usually just sit at the communion table for waiting service. The squid dish and sausages are fantastic, not too salty. Beer selections are good, but the beers are usually not cold, a bit warm. I'm not sure if it's becaus the place is a bit busy or what, but it would be perfect if the beers are icy cold. Other than that, I love the live vibe here. Great low key for beer.
2018-11-03,5,Had a fabulous time from the food to the service,     I can't say enough. Thank you Millie by far you are the best!!!
2018-10-14,4,Went last night with friends for Oktoberfest. Service slow but we didn't mind, we enjoyed conversation amongst our group, as well as the group next to us. Almost everything we ordered was delicious. Our group order potato pancakes and muscle appetizers. Potato pancakes were a bit well done a needed a tad of salt, but my friends enjoyed the muscles. For entrees we ordered the beef goulash with spatzel, saurbraten with red cabbage, and kasespatzle. All entrees were delicious. For dessert we shared the apple strudel - a tad too much lemon in the filling, otherwise we enjoyed it. I was disappointed that they play top 40 music in the biergarten, as opposed to Polka Music - that would give  patrons a true biergaten experience.All in all, it was a fun time, and we look forward to visiting again.
2018-10-13,2,So we had to sit outside.  Thankfully it wasn't too cold. OMG the food from the grill took FOREVER.  There were piles of food and just the worst system ever of finishing orders.  We ordered simple sausage and fries or burger and fries.   Nothing complicated.  All in our party waited a good 45- one hour!!!  It was over the top ridiculous.Would only ever come back for beer and that's it. Very disappointed for our first visit.
2018-10-13,4,Awesome place to chill in Hoboken. The food is quite good, but the grille is super slow. Great selection of beer.
2018-10-10,5,Amazing place in the upper parts of Hoboken.  The staff are generally efficient and friendly.  The prices are great if you visit on Tuesday (50% off almost everything if you pay in cash), and the food tastes great, especially for a beer hall.  They have a good selection of beers, and there are screens for when major games are being played.  Large indoor and outdoor sections as well.
2018-10-08,4,Relaxed atmosphere and cool crowd.  Full bar, fun food menu and good service. Everyone was watching football and hanging out. There are really big picnic tables which are really fun because you end up meeting new people and making new friends.
2018-10-07,2,Ambiance is cool, drinks and food are average but the service is horrific! 45 minutes to close out a check. In a town where people rely on the train. Totally unacceptable
2018-10-07,1,This place has quickly lost favor with me. I totally understand they are a drinking establishment and they have right to ask for IDs. But there is absolutely no justifying a bouncer that interrogates a customer about their address, when they graduated high school, what sign they are, and how old they're about to turn and then laughs and chuckles and allows them to go in as if they're letting something slide. I'm 23 with a valid drivers license. I don't expect to be teased or mocked when I go to a restaurant or bar. So rude! Unlikely I return.
2018-09-11,4,Came here with a friend.  The drinks are really good and the prices are great.  Outdoor seating is really nice if you come at night.But like any other bar you might run into some strange people.  Also there was a Bocce like game going on.  I'm Italian....and that was definitely not Bocce!But it's a nice place to go for drinks!  It's especially nice at night.  Would definitely come back.
2018-08-26,5,So, came here on a Sunday around 5pm. Ordered 1 liter Hofbräu Munchen and 1 literSchöfferhofer Grapefruit.  Both came out icy cold. Had the wood plank steak tartar and Bavarian Soft Pretzel. Amaziiiing! For the entree we had the Saurbraten and the had the 12 oz NY Strip Steak Medium rare....absolute perfection!  The staff was friendly and service was quick. Our food came out flaming hot.  We sat outside on a very perfect night and I wish all Yelpers who visit have the same experience we had. If I had 5 thumbs...I'd give them 5 thumbs up!   Definitely returning with the rest of.the family. A must visit for all...and the food is authentic German so all you Germans out there looking for a taste from home... You must visit! Thanks for the wonderful experience.
2018-08-21,5,One of my favorite spots in the area! No matter the day of the week, I can come here and be assured good beer and a great time with friends.
2018-08-19,5,A group of 16 of us came here around 6:30p on a Saturday for a birthday celebration and we had a great time!PARKING - It was pretty easy to find parking since we came quite early. Street parking on the other side of the road was free after 9p so it only costed $2.50 for 2.5 hours. SERVICE - Staff was great and our server was super accommodating and helpful with finding the best table for our large group. We had to split up into 2 tables in the beginning but she was able to put all of us together at last! They also gave great recommendations when it comes to food & drinks :)AMBIENCE - Very casual and more family friendly than I expected! (but no screaming children running around, thank goodness). I really liked the open hall and how chill it is for everyone to just hang out and have a good time! You could be sitting with complete strangers but still feel very intimate with the bench style seatings.FOOD - Definitely exceeded my expectations! Good portions for the pricing. Great for sharing. Would love to come back for more![STEAMED BIER MUSSELS] - $16 - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! The fiance and I LOVED these. The sauce was so flavorful and great for dipping the bread in![PRETZEL BREAD PUDDING] - $7 - So gooooood. Not overly sweet. RECOMMEND![CURRYBRAT] - $12 - Sausage with curry sauce. Delicious!! [B. NEKTAR ZOMBIE KILLER] - $12 - Cider in a bottle (16.9oz). Very yummy and not too sweet.[AUSTIN EASTCIDERS BLOOD ORANGE] - $6 - Cider in a can (12oz). The blood orange flavor is very refreshing!
2018-08-18,3,So as far as Biergarten's go this place is boring. Came here on a Saturday with a group of friends and expected something similar to the biergarten's in JC what we got was a long empty hall where we simply sat, drank, and ate.There beer selection is great, and there bartenders are extremely knowledgeable. There was a beer that I loved, but got discontinued on draft - the bartender was able to recommend something extremely similar to it on the first shot - I was very impressed.Overall its a great place to grab a beer and catch up with friends, but don't expect too much when coming here.
2018-08-03,5,If you are going out with beer and brats in mind this place is excellent. Since I don't eat like this often this was a real treat. Chicken sausage right off the grill. Charred and flavorful. Service attentive. Considering it's Hoboken, the noise and TV abundance was tolerable unlike so many other places in town.
2018-07-22,5,Probably one of the best birthday parties we have ever given.We had a last minute cancellation at our last location and called the Biergarten only 5 days before our party to see if there was any way they could salvage my son's 9th birthday party where we had 30 people invited. The Pilsenerhaus was so helpful, they actually cared and really worked to accommodate us. The service and food when we arrived was even better than we had expected. We were in the more private room to the right of the main hall and were lucky in that it was a nice day and a Saturday so it was a little quieter than a normal day. Our group of 12 boys were able to play some of the small yard games they had brought.The beer flowed throughout the party and our server Shelley was absolutely wonderful. She helped us order a pile of food - sausage platters which were excellent for sharing, several smoked salmon plates, some French toast plates to share and then we had brought in our own cake which they helped us to serve.Our party ended up being a 5 hour celebration as opposed to the 2 hours we had planned and our son had a wonderful time.All in all a wonderful experience, thank you so much to the Biergarten team!
2018-07-21,5,The food and service were excellent. Good, authentic German food in addition to some great tasting beer and cider. I will definitely be back!
2018-07-15,5,Such a cute outdoor seating area! The perfect place to grab a few beers and relax with friends. The beers are large, delicious, and reasonably priced! I highly recommend checking in to get the 1/2 off Pilsener Haus beer.
2018-07-11,4,Nice selection of beers. We liked the atmosphere inside and the waitress was friendly. I was surprised that the sausage stand was run as a separate business, you need to wait in the line and it's cash only. I wish I could order it from the table. Music was amazing, all the songs we like and love. Will visit again for sure.
2018-07-08,5,A must come on a Tuesday evening. They offer 50% off of about 95% of the menu if you pay cash. Beer pretzels ($5.50) are HUGE and the cheese dip it comes with phenomenal. Also tried out their kielbasas and cheddar jalapeño franks (which come with a pile of fries and sauerkraut) for $6 each. Both were delicious, and my boyfriend and I couldn't even finish the huge portions. He topped it off with a quite large, $4 hoegaarden. Tuesday night deal cannot be beat. Can't wait to go back.
2018-07-06,5,Great place to have a Great Beerand hangout with friends.  Awsome beer selection FULL bar and great staff. Andrew and Josh. Good food. Sit inside or outside.
2018-07-03,1,The last time I went to Pilsener, I had a very positive experience eating dinner, but this time will prevent me from ever going again. Got there after it had just rained and asked a waiter for a towel so I could wipe off the table. A bus boy came over with a squeegee. Yes, a squeegee. That's great for getting excess water off but like it's still wet and they were just going to leave it, so again i asked for a towel. The bus boy hands me a damp towel. I ask for a dry one. He says well it's going to get wet anyway because the table is wet. Yes, but the dry one will soak up more water.....finally his buddy gets me a less damp towel and i wipe the table off myself with them standing there. Fine okay. Next- we pick a table (half of our party of 15 is here at this point) and someone sits down. We politely tell them we have a large party coming and don't mind that they sit there until they come. Cool- they say sure no problem they will move when the party arrives. That doesn't happen. Dudes are first of all the definition of bros and talking smack about women all night while a group of my friends (women) are right next to them...gross. And then they decide to bring the manager over who is equally as rude and tells us that we can't save the whole table and they can stay even though they said they would leave....so basically...if you have a large group and your whole group isn't there at once, don't plan on sitting together. Many more words were exchanged between the manager (Frank) and I and it's just clear that the level of professionalism he is capable of is next to zero. The food was okay, but nothing great. The dressing on the summer salad was plain and there was a whole lot of green and not a whole lot of anything else. The cheese plate was more meat than cheese and the meat was like slices of deli salami masquerading as something trying to be fancy. Not happening. The only good part about this whole experience was our waitress, Kiara. Like probably one of the best I've ever had...and we were hectic af. Safe to say we will be sticking to Zeppelin from now on. Which is 10x better anyway.
2018-07-03,5,As my Long Island Yelp friend Joe said, we need a place like this in Suffolk County!I'm in Jersey with my son, Spain vs Russia is playing and I want to drink a cold one and watch Spain dominate. (Didn't happen) Where else would I go except Pilsener Haus & Biergarten?Parking in the area sucks. I hit up a lot and paid $10 bucks. Once inside, oh its on. There's a few places you can get your beer on: A small dining room, the large space with TVs, directly at the bar or outside. We sit in the middle dining area. Our waiter comes over and drops off brunch menus. Everything looks outrageous, I almost ordered the wiener schnitzel but the grill is behind me and man... they are cooking up some brats!I walk over to the grill area. All of our meats are made in house. Give is a few minutes and I'll have these bratwursts grilled up for you. Cash only, I first pay for my brats. The beer is a separate tab. Once the brats are ready, oh baby It's German up in here! Not only do they make the meats fresh, the sauerkraut is also fresh! I'm noticing pickling spices in the kraut? I grabbed a nice tub of grainy mustard, it just made the experience better.Pilsener Haus & Biergarten, lots of great beers on tap. Outragous food and plenty of room! I came on a Sunday, not too crowded. Prost!
2018-06-22,4,After tossing around some ideas as to where to go and get a drink. We decided on Biergarten. It was a pretty low key night, with maybe 5 parties in the restaurant.   We were met quickly with a bubbly waitress who informed us of our choices for food specials and drink specials.   We came for drinks, and we ordered our selection of beers, only to be told that we would be getting free wings with bbn our beers!    The drinks came on time although we did wait a bit on one of our friends LIT. The wings were quite tasty and well prepared! I loved the slight char on them, although they were appropriately small for free bar wings.    Overall had a great time and good prices drinks.
2018-06-19,5,I really, really enjoy coming to Pilsner Haus!The comments from my earlier visits are still 100% valid (check them out for some first-time customer hints), but as I've come to better understand how the place "works", my comfort level and dining experience have significantly increased.  This is really a first class restaurant and beer garden.To be honest, my wife and I arrived in Hoboken for an extended visit, and I told her that the first place we were eating dinner upon our arrival is the Pilsner Haus.  It just so happened that we fortuitously arrived on a Tuesday to take full advantage of "50% off 90% of the menu night" (cash only.  Another great experience.Going back tonight to enjoy Pilsner Haus again.It's a little whacky for a first time visitor.  If you intend to order anything off the grill, that part is always "cash only" regardless of the day of the week.Anything ordered off the menu is still just like a regular restaurant, you can pay with a credit card or cash.You won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!
2018-06-14,5,I absolutely fell in love with this place the minute I seen the outdoor patio. The ambience here is great and the people are extremely friendly. The staff is as attentive as they can possibly be due to high volume of customers. The food is awesome and I suggest you try the pretzel and the different Polish sausages. There are so many different types of beers here I can never really choose one. If you like beer and great food with a great atmosphere I would suggest you come to this place.
2018-06-11,5,Great place to go for a guys night out or dinner with the family. I've been here a number of times and there isn't much I can complain about. Servers generally check up on you every 10-15 mins. They have a very friendly and welcoming staff. Pretzels and potato pancakes are a must when coming here and boy you'd be surprised how fast you get your food. Only down side is how busy it can get, meaning no where to sit. Overall definitely my go to spot for a bite to eat and some German beers.
2018-06-11,5,The pretzel is to die for!! Great service and an even cooler atmosphere. A must try when in Hoboken!
2018-06-10,1,Place closes at 2am. Said it on yelp, google, and on there door. Yet they refused to sell me a beer at 10:45. Last call at 10:30. Are you serious! Owner/manager if you're reading this I am telling everyone to avoid your place. Was ready to spend big. Going elsewhere. Come on. The beer is right there. Just want one. Drove all the way from Nyc. Public, beware they might turn you down without considering how misleading there operating hours are. DON'T COME HERE!
2018-06-10,3,We walked in as a group of 6. Planning to grab food & beer. It was 9:55pm when we walked in. No one greet us, so I assumed we just sit and wait for server to come. 10 mins later, we are ready to order. All of us so excited to try some German food & beer. All of a sudden, "kitchen was close at 10pm" we could have be informed right when we get in. So 3 stars for the service until I try their food. Guys! Beware kitchen close at 10pm!!!!! Not 2am!!!
2018-06-06,4,Looking to get your suburbia on, but still have a few gallons of beer? Pilsener Haus is the place for you. Some of my favorite people live out in north NJ these days, and over the past few years our meeting spot has been Pilsener.  Who could blame us really:Kid friendly? CheckBratwurst and fries? CheckEasy to get to via car or from the city? CheckLiters and liters of beer? CheckATM for the food (cash only)? CheckReally, it's the perfect spot for catching up with your friends who now have kids. The kids can run around playing, and you can get your Bavarian drink on reminiscing about the past and catching up on the present. Win win.
2018-06-03,4,Solid choice. Beer selections are off the hook. If you are a beer drinker and can't find beers to like here, you never will. Regular menu good, but grill items are where it's at.  Homemade sausages and frankfurters.  Always good.  Grill is self order and cash only. Rest of menu is by waitress and takes cards. Three parts to place.  Main room with bar.  Setup is standard German biergarten style.  Smaller room off front, mainly a bar.  Outside garden terrace. Single big screen in front of main room always showing the game, whatever best game of moment is.  Sometimes live music. Kid and family friendly. Crowd is adult later in night. Kitchen serves late.  Street parking. Recommend.
2018-06-03,4,This bar has picnic-table style seating that makes for a great, laid-back environment. There's indoor and outdoor seating, and guests can seat themselves. There's a drink here for everyone--dark beer, light beer, sour beer, hard cider. When I was here recently, they had a (seasonal) sour raspberry beer on the menu and it was delicious. Their half-price drinks Tuesday deal is great, but be aware that you have to pay in cash.The food is a bit pricey for this type of place, in my opinion, but it's good. The burgers are cooked well and the soft pretzels come with a delicious dip (no idea what's in it but it's kind of a fluffy & spicy cream cheese--highly recommend). Every time I've been there, the staff has known exactly the right time to come check on our table. Overall, this is a great place to come with a large group of friends for a few hours.
2018-06-02,1,Since this has been in my local neighborhood for the past 3 years I figured why not, let's bring some friends for beer and weiners. Yeaa... NO.... The worst part was that our server was only partially dedicated to get section. Meaning it was kinda self serve. We sat in the back, by the grill in the corner. No light, no candles, 10% service. But hey it's Hoboken right? I got my own drinks, napkins and hobbled to the grill for my dry ass meats. But what do we do just tip 9 percent for the 'service' we received?  Will not be back. Please close down like the oyster bar down the  the block and kill yourself.
2018-05-30,4,Awesome dogs and brat - also the variety of beer was so cool- I had a pastrami sandwich also which could've been more "meaty" - service was great noice sitting outside
2018-05-28,5,Went here Saturday with a group of 5 friends for the first time and could not have asked for a better day out.  Our server, Sherri, took care of us right away and had a great attitude and made us laugh. Would definitely recommend.
2018-05-28,5,On a Sunday around opening first time thinking wow this place is awesome, empty, no line at the cash only grill station... live artist strumming and singing along to his guitar...then it took a a spin a complete 180, as I'm sitting with my girlfriend drinking my liter beer getting a nice buzz going seats begin to fill with family's. FAMILIES & KIDS, lots and lots and lots of kids, the artist even switched and started playing A,B,C and nursery rhymes and its became a sing along with kids running around and apparently kids are allowed until 8pm. If you're a drinker this can completely kill the vibe. Especially when they have such an awesome beer selection and a pretty dope menu. I'd come back after 8pm.
2018-05-27,3,The drinks were great. The environment was great but unfortunately we had a bad service experience. We were a large group of 12 and our server, Sherri, was not attentive at all and had a bad attitude towards our group the entire time (our theory is that since we were a large group, the restaurant automatically charged 20% gratuity and she knew she was guaranteed a good tip). We ordered pretzels which took over an hour to come out, and when we followed up with her, she put in another order and accidentally served us double the amount which we were then forced to pay for. We wish we could say this service experience did not put a damper on our time, but it did.
2018-05-25,5,Once you enter this building, you will immediately feel like you just to a beergarden in Germany. They got the long tables with the wooden benches. Happy hour during the week. Your typical German beer selection, get it in any size. You can get food from the grill like bratwurst or they also have schnitzel, pretzel,.... Check out the patio during summertime !
2018-05-25,5,Love love this placeTook my cousin from out of town tothis Place on Tuesday The food n drink was delicious. It's very very busy n the waitress could've do a better job of follow up with us on how we are doing but overall I am not complaining about the food n drinks servedIt was wonderful n planning to come back soon
2018-05-24,5,All around awesome experience. Food was just as expected, good spot to hang with friends while digging into some bbq classics.
2018-05-24,3,I have only been here for beers and the pretzel, so I can not speak on behalf of the food. Pilsener Haus & Biergarten has a wide selection of beers.When I ordered my first pint I had some type of newspaper in it? I took it out as I don't seem to mind when a few mishaps happen during my experiences. Unfortunately, after continuing to drink my pint I just kept eating it. I asked for another pint which was given to me without question.Pretzel was good! Not too salty, came out warm and quick. We were having an issue with our waiter. He did not seem to come around too often as we waited a half hour for beers and the check.~If you happen to bring your own cake for a party, please note they will charge you $2 for each plate used.~
2018-05-22,4,I love coming here with my friends. It's really easy to get drinks at the bar and all of the bartenders are friendly. They have plenty of seating, indoor and outdoor. I like to come here on Tuesday's because it's 50% basically their whole menu! They play good music and they project important games or events on large screens. The best thing on their food menu is the huge pretzel - it's probably the best pretzel I've had ever at a restaurant. Their beers are very large too!
2018-05-11,5,Wish I could give more stars. I went for the Jameson bartender's ball and had an absolutely amazing time. The DJ was playing some original mixes and had everyone inside dancing. Entire front of the house staff was attentive, fast (especially for how crowded it was) and extremely friendly. The staff set the pace for sure. Everyone was having a good time, no one was acting aggressive or crazy (especially after so much free whiskey) and people were conversing and making new friends. Burgers, sausages and pretzels are the best in the area. Only down side has nothing to do with the place, but the city. Hard to find parking and if you don't read the signs, you'll come out to a boot. I see it happen to people all the time.
2018-05-11,4,Thinking it could rain, we walked past the outdoor biergarten, went indoors and sat at the bar. Bar staff were friendly. Definitely a beir hall setting. We ordered a couple biers. I started off with an Austrian pilsner. It was very good. We ordered the giant pretzel. It was as soft, hot and fresh as one could ever hop for. Of course it paired will with the bier.I ordered the Schnitzel, which happened to be on special. It came with lingonberry sauce, potatoes and a cucumber slaw. All was good. (Although I wondered if the schnitzel was of the prepackaged frozen variety and reheated onsite.) I enjoyed a Pilsener Haus Original bier with the entrée.I enjoy these bier hall type places. Next time I'm here, I would like to try the sausages. Prost!
2018-05-01,4,Used to be the best trivia in town, now, no more. The food, beer, and bar service is still great though.
2018-04-25,4,My father and I wanted to get a few old friends together last Saturday for a nice afternoon out. We're old friends from a previous bar we all went to that the owner decided to sell. We use to have so much fun there, but lost track of each other for some time. By chance we all came together and set this trek up.We started off at Rudy's, which I've checked in and reviewed before. A few drinks some nicely prepared calamari, just to get some food in our bellies. There was suppose to be 8 of us but 2 at the last minute backed out so be it. Then 2 we're going to be a little late so we decided to head down to the Biergarten, the other 2 would meet up.The location is out of the hustle and bustle of Hoboken. Located mostly around factories and in an industrial area.  We took an Uber from Rudy's to there $12 can't beat that! Good thing cause parking unless your very lucky isn't happening especially on a Saturday afternoon.The trip took about 20 mins with New Jersey traffic, not to mention it happened to be a nice day rare here lol.  It is located on a corner but the the entrance is a little further down the street, a little tricky to find but just follow the other people you'll find it. Once you enter there is outside seating I would say for about 50/60 people. Outside seating for us was not an option nothing available, so went inside not a big deal. A very big seating area with picnic table like seating. Each table could seat 10 comfortably, maybe 12 but that might be a little tight. We arrived around 130 so outside was more crowded than inside so no problem getting a table. We took the last table in the back against the wall cause we can be loud sometimes ( ok all the time )! Table in front of us was empty so no worries!  We started out with the soft Bavarian pretzel with homemade grainy mustard. It was still warm and nice and soft, with the mustard very tasty!Now the beer they have 70 different beers available, if you can't find it here you won't find it anywhere! I first started out with the Anglo American Ale a little strong hop taste in the beginning but a nice clean fresh end. Then stuck to a cider Ironbound Hard Cider made from Jersey apples, so figured how could I go wrong?As for the food once all 6 of us were together we ordered a mix app of everything to share. Chicken sausage, kielbasa, bratwurst, jalapeño hot dogs, sauerkraut, and french fries. Everything was perfectly cooked just the way you would want it! The sausage and nice snap to your bite seasoned excellently with just the right amount of spice. The fries where excellently crispy with along with ketchup and dipping sauce made a great accompaniment.Stayed about 5 hours started to get crowed around 630, nice crowd younger but nice. After many beers we started to give the younger kids life advice, probably laughed at us after we left lol! Not a cheap out for 5 really cause 1 of us left early was $830  that included 5 shots of JW Blue $51 a piece. Our waitress was super cool very knowledgeable about the different kinds of beers. Her name was Sherri and if we stayed wanted to join us for a few! All would definitely recommend checking the place out especially since summer is around the corner. I will/we will definitely be back soon! Come and join us for a beer, just yell out my name lol!!
2018-04-14,3,Great place, but it was very crowded and hard to get a seat. Stood around for 45 min until my wife and I got one. And it was severely understaffed. Wait staff was running around stressed out.
2018-04-13,4,Normally, I would come to this place at night time and it's usually packed on weekends. Today I decided to come around 5PM. There are indoor/outdoor seatings and today the outside area was packed. It was a first time seeing children at Biergarten too. Definitely because I only came at iight, but I liked that it wasn't packed inside. It was almost empty and I enjoyed the space. The food is really good too. My friend ordered calamari with sausage, my boyfriend and I ordered the rotisserie chicken with fries. So good! The chicken didn't taste dry and the calamari my friend had was also good! It wasn't breaded, but I enjoyed it! The beers were pretty good too and they have a huge menu! Sizes are not bad at all. We ordered five beers, two meals and the bill came out to $43-$47 bucks... not bad! The service was good too! Our waitress was pretty busy attending others, but she didnt forget about us so I really appreciated that. Attentive towards her customers! I recommend this place to all beer lovers, and those who are looking for a chill night.
2018-04-11,5,Our all time favorite. Me and my husband go to this cool beergarden in Hoboken quite a lot. They have a good variety of beer and their seasonal ones are really good too. A special mention to the sausage grill they have in a corner. They make some really mean sausages. Must try. The bar tenders are cool too.
2018-04-11,4,Overall the ambiance is super reminiscent of an actual Biergarten. Benches every where with shared seating. The food is extremely good here. From their pretzels to their brats, they know how to do good food.The beer selection is also very good here and prices are reasonable especially for being located in a place like Hoboken.The only negative is that when it gets busy (and it does) the waitstaff tend to become more rude and pay way less attention to groups. This can be mitigated if you pay a very large tip but I personally like tipping large for good service given rather than tipping just to get good service
2018-04-06,5,We had a large group meet there for a Birthday party.   The entire staff was incredibly accommodating.  The food was amazing and the drinks were great.
2018-04-01,4,This is a great biergarten. First, they have a good selection of beers (bottle and tap). Second, they have a lot of space... outdoor, indoor and even a second floor. Third, they have food, lots of grilled meats and sausage, but I've only had the pretzel... and it's perfection.  Fresh baked and warm with a crisp exterior that snaps when you break off a piece. It's salty but not overly coated in salt granules (that you end up rubbing off anyway). The interior is fully cooked and fluffy, not doughy. It's large and filling but doesn't leave a lump in your tummy like some heavier pretzel. Simply delicious. Fourth, they have events, drink specials, and guest djs. It's a cool place to go with a group of friends anytime of year, day or night. Swing by for a cold brew and a good time.
2018-03-30,1,Food is good, beers r great ... but the music kills the moods. they need to change the dj
2018-03-30,1,Amer from the staff. The nicest guy in the staff accommodated our large group. The WORST Dj. MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO NOTE THIS. The volume levels is beyond bearable.
2018-03-27,5,Update: The manager reached out and tried to clarify the policy. Ultimately the policy was rescinded and there is no longer a mandatory coatcheck. The place is much more lively again since this has happened and my friends and I have resumed coming here. This is still my favorite bar in Hoboken. This used to be my favorite bar (I've come almost every week for the past  but the new management is trying to change that. Since the takeover they've instituted a mandatory coat and bag check. This would be fine if it was complimentary but they charge $2-$3 (depending on the night it seems) for the privilege. This might as well be a mandatory cover charge, especially in the winter. When a large portion of your clientele are poor college students an extra $2 can be a deciding factor in your choice of restaurant. I'm sure the sudden sharp decline in crowds on Tuesdays has something to do with this. Every staff member from the bouncer to our regular waitresses all agree this policy is ill conceived. They all insist it's the fault of this mysterious new manager. I'm told he's trying to turn Biergarten into a "New York style club" whatever that means. The bag check is especially annoying for someone like me who has to carry a bag of medications to deal with health issues. I tried explaining to the bouncer that I needed to hold onto my bag to keep my medications nearby but was told there would be no exceptions to the policy. The new manager should seriously reconsider how they're treating customers or I will be finding a new favorite bar.
2018-03-23,5,This is one of my favorite places in Hoboken to grab a beer and brat! The food is exactly what you want to go along with any one of their many delicious beers, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting- you won't leave without making a new friend. I was there tonight along with some friends for some Friday night celebrations and we all had the best time! Our server, Rebekka, made our night. She checked in on us frequently, even though the hall was really busy and she made certain that our glasses were never empty. She was absolutely delightful, SUPER attentive and made our experience that much more enjoyable. In a city where you can find a good meal on every block, Rebekka makes for a compelling reason to come back!
2018-03-21,5,Every time I can't make it on a Tuesday, I get major FOMO because that 50% deal is too good!!! I've had the kielbasa, the grilled chicken sausage and the bratwurst from the grill, which were all delicious and came with a heaping side of french fries and sauerkraut ($12, normally). After ordering, you wait around 10-20 minutes, depending on how crowded it is, and then pay at the register. The utensils are on the side of the grill, as well as the sauce pumps and napkins.Recently we came and ordered some of the entree dishes from the kitchen. The schnitzel ($19), a pork cutlet, came with a side of parsley potatoes, pickled cucumbers and lingonberry sauce - the portion was so large we needed to take it home. The side of french fries ($4) were huge and fed the four of us like an appetizer. Now the show stopper- you need to get the Bavarian Soft Pretzel ($11). It's not like your NYC pushcart pretzel, this is the real deal. It comes out incredibly soft and warm, and tastes absolutely delicious dipped in the grainy mustard and the cheese. Honestly, I could just eat 3 of these for dinner and live a happy life. As for the beer, the menu is extensive, and a little overwhelming. I've tried the Stiegel, Pilsner Original and Oktoberfest and all paired well with the meat. I also tried my friend's grapefruit canned cider, which was light and fruity. The bathrooms are clean, and seating gets really tight at around 6, do come early. The line for the grill gets lengthy real fast, and ordering entrees from the kitchen is just as good. There's outdoor seating which is pleasant during the warmer months, and is super aesthetic.
2018-03-20,2,It's a pretty unique atmosphere in Hoboken, but please understand that even on Tuesdays, when everything is half-priced, the cheapest pint you will still find is $5. I'm pretty sure that means that most other nights the cheapest pint you will buy is $10 which, as much as I love the atmosphere, is a little bit too steep for Hoboken.Servers are very nice.
2018-03-14,1,So I would love to properly review this place but I cant. I am hungry and have tried to call them ten times but only get a convoluted phone answering system that will absolutely NOT allow me to talk to a human being. I have a simple question, "how late do you serve food?" I am hungry and have had a long travel day and would like to have a few beers and a soft pretzel, but I will not make the trek to Hoboken without confirming whether or not I will still be able to order food. Alas this seems impossible to confirm.I HATE when places do this crap! Answer your damn phone! I am willing to come and spend my hard earned money at your establishment provided I get the answer one simple damn question. These impersonal phone systems are horse hockey. I would love an answer from management explaining why they think it acceptable to not allow a consumer to be able to pose a question before patronizing. Ridiculous!
2018-03-11,4,Came here for a friends farewell party and I was told beforehand that the pretzel was amazing. Quite funny as this place is first and foremost a pub. However, my friends werent kidding -- the pretzel was something to rave about. It was fresh, warm, and soft with two dips that were very tasty (one was pimiento and honey mustard). Definitely worth to try and perfect to pair with beer. Ambiance is great, but a little bit packed.
2018-02-28,4,This is in a part of Hoboken that's off the beaten path, in the warehouse area. What a cool spot. Comfortable and spacious beer garden with plenty of seating. Cute beerhouse decor with long wooden benches. The extensive beer menu is very tasty. Great for big groups.
2018-02-23,5,Amazing food and staff!!  Their pork shoulder is phenomenal and very authentic!  I lived in Germany for 4 years and this place is the real deal.  100X better than the Jersey City beer garden - night and day comparison!  Shoutout to David who always goes the extra mile to make his customers happy!
2018-02-23,5,I love this place, Tuesday's they have everything half off. I always bring my friends to this place, friendly atmosphere, A great list of beers, delicious Burgers, sausages, and super friendly staff. You can bring your kids until 9 PM and they have a very family oriented atmosphere during the weekends. Overall this is a fun place and one of my favorites in Hoboken.
2018-02-18,1,Mediocre food, overpriced beers, and poor quality televisions for watching sports. Staff is also incredibly rude to patrons and is not tolerant of children, despite claiming to be kid-friendly. I wouldn't waste my time or money going to this establishment.
2018-02-14,3,It's a pretty famous Biergarten in Hoboken, New Jersey. I tried the Tuesday half price dinner... I would say it's not really cheap even with half price. Food is average but serve with big plates. Service is awful, super crowded and couldn't hear my friend talking and cash only...
2018-02-07,5,If you are looking for a kid friendly place this is your spot! We came here with 2 newborns and observed babies and kids of all ages come and go throughout the day.  The service is attentive and friendly, and the beer selection is superb. Be sure to order a giant pretzel  and remember some cash as the meat station does not take credit.
2018-02-07,5,Delicious hearty food and a good selection of rather large beers. Definitely gets crowded on thursday/friday/saturday nights. Take note that there is new management and the specials have changed (nothing's discounted after 6 pm these days).
2018-01-30,4,Coat check is no longer required on 1/2 price Tuesdays and Weekends!I have a prior review that wasn't favorable due to a required coat check. I came with a group of friends who have been coming every Tuesday for 4+ years. The required coat check and rubbed us all the wrong way. But with it no longer required, we are more then happy to return but we have a worry, which I'll mention later.From original:===I've been going to this place every week, for a little over a year. I meet with a group of friends who have been going here for 4+ years, every week. I go on Half-Priced Tuesdays, as that was when everyone else went.I would say it looks like a classic Biergarten. My German coworkers have told me it's like a modern Biergarten in Germany. It has long row tables that you just find space at and the waiter/waitress will come by to help. Pitcher of water is usually provided. The number of times we've been here, we're recognized on sight to the point that we don't even need to put a card down to open a tab.The group orders on the same tab, collects the cash, and pays all in cash at the end. Tuesdays say it's cash only, but you can still pay with card. Just not at the Grill in the back, which is always cash only. Note: on half-priced Tuesdays, if you order to-go, they'll charge full price.Grill Food: Burger, Frankfurter, Chicken, Kielbasa are all excellent. Some how I haven't tried any of the wursts before, but I was so content cycling between those options that I didn't see a need to try something else. They improved their fries about 4-5 months ago, from "good" to "can we get more?"Non-Grill Food: Wiener Schnitzel is excellent and a sizable portion. Mussels are great too. I'd kill for their Brussels Sprouts: salty, sweet, spicy, all good. Popular table appetizer is the cucumber salad.===Service: So-so. Depends on who you get. If you get one of the good waiters/waitresses, they'll visit your table regularly, smile, and make you smile too. Otherwise, good luck getting their attention, getting your drinks in one order, and double check your bill... had one case where they charged us for another table's drinks (which weren't cheap) and after pointing this point, they went back and removed... our drinks. We didn't want to stay any longer, so we paid for the more expensive drinks and left.So per my original review, drink prices still went up, and beer quality has gone down. There was a security guard who recognized us on sight.Starting Jan 2018, they added a required coat check. It went for at least 4 weeks. My group didn't go the 4th week. There was a 2nd security guard who helped the first."Week 5" (Jan 2018): coat check is gone... along with the 2 security guards. For a bar, it was actually surprising: there was no security. As we were eating, we spotted what looked like a new, different from prior two, security guard who made a gesture towards the coat check... but people never approached it. The coat check is still there, no longer required. It wasn't staffed when we arrived.My worry: pre-Jan 2018, I said in the original review I would give this place 4 stars on a bad day, 5 on a good. I would have to say it's now 3 on bad, 4 on good. Reasoning is during the coat check debacle, we learned of new owners from multiple workers (their words, not sure if an actual new owner or just new manager) who worked in NYC clubs and was trying to turn this place into a NYC club, across the Hudson. I don't know if that's still the plan and the "coat check cover charge" was backtracked on, if they're changing plans on a whole, or if the whole plan was an idea that was mentioned. I have no reason not to distrust the workers, but it makes us question if "we won the battle, but will loose the war". Time will tell. Maybe then I'll update the review again. Until then, if then, we don't have to look for a replacement place and will be back next week as usual.
2018-01-30,5,This is a nice spot here in Hoboken, great beer selection!! Tuesday the have a great Deal, 1/2 off some good beers and the grill! Staff is friendly and the bartender is always there if you have any questions about bier!!!
2018-01-27,2,I have to say while I like this place for its food, the customer service is not good.  Many times when we have eaten here, the service was rotating waiters and waitresses that don't follow up often, forget to bring something, etc.  For a place that should be kid friendly as it's loud, they have not been on many occasions. The most recent example is we asked to be seated in their outdoor heated igloos. Kids and parents all thought it would be super fun. They directed us to sit inside because 3 out of 4 were reserved and they were really meant for larger parties (we were a party of 4). After an hour and a half at dinner when we left we went outside and all 4 igloos were not used and in fact no one was even in the outdoor space! My kids (age 11 and 13) were super disappointed as were we.  In addition, upon entering the establishment a super rude bouncer or host (not sure what he was other than rude), insisted we had to check our coats for $3 A coat! Looking at everyone else dining with their coats on or having them on their seats, we ignored the request.  Really disappointed in the service and this is not a first time.
2018-01-24,5,I went for my first time this past Saturday and couldn't have found a place with a more friendly courteous staff. I think it was Andrew and Jason working behind the bar . Food was very good. I did not get a chance to try the grill. looking forward to returning. Keep up the great work. Thank you.
2018-01-20,5,This place is much better than Biergartens in jersey city. Selection of food is great. Make sure you bring cash for grilled items. Some of them are cash only. Good place to hang out with friends:)
2018-01-13,5,I came here this past Tuesday night with my friends to take advantage of the amazing weekly half off food and drink deal.  We noticed these igloos outside which groups can sit in and thought it would be great if we could sit in there.  We asked the employees if/how we could use one of them for our own group and they said you typically have to pay for it but they'll let me speak with the manager and maybe we can work out some deal.  The manager Dave was amazing and nice enough to let us use one of them for free.  We had a great time in there.  Great for groups of 6-10.Our waiter Amir was also very friendly and attentive and came out into the cold and snow frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. I
2018-01-09,5,Really enjoyed our time at the Pilsener Haus & Biergarten.Great food and a great atmosphere with an extensive and creative beer list. The food was delicious and unique. We had a mix of eaters at the table, vegan and carnivorous, and everyone had something to enjoy. Fun and lively environment with great ambiance.Another thing that was notable was that the service was friendly, fast and attentive; I believe the waitress' name was Joanna, she checked back offen and delivered all of our drinks quickly after ordering even though it was so busy.Even the manager, David, came by our table to check on us. He spent time with us sorting through the beer list as well as dinner menu to find the best suited pairings for all 8 of us! He really was the cherry on top of our whole experience at Pilsner Haus.An over-the-top compliment for an over-the-top time.We will all be back, spreading word to all of our friends and family. Worth a trip from the city or from the boondocks.
2018-01-09,5,Wonderful hospitality! Our waiter came to check up on us in the igloo outside every few minutes despite having to come outside in the cold weather! Outdoor igloo in the winter a definite must do!
2018-01-09,1,I have been a huge fan of this place for years...until tonight when I showed up and was told I must check my coat and pay for it.  So there is a cover charge to have a beer and pretzel?  The price for my coat does not matter...it's the fact that YOU are making it mandatory to pay YOU before I sit down.  I was told by the lady at the door and the gentleman checking ID's that the NEW manager has put this into effect.  Well the NEW Manager has lost my business as well as all other families that I speak too about this.  Not a good start NEW manager.
2017-12-31,1,Horrible for New Year's Eve.  Mandatory coat check and had to wait outside even though we had tickets
2017-12-31,1,I had a horrible experience here for New Year's Eve. We bought tickets in advance and got told to wait outside on a night where it is 10 degrees. There was hardly anyone inside and it seemed that we were told to wait outside in the freezing cold to make it appear that it was more crowded then it was. Then when they finally let us inside we are told we need to wait in another line for mandatory coat check which costs $3 in addition to the $25 + tax ticket we already paid. After waiting in this line we are told there is no more room for coats. We take a seat at our table and place our coats next to us. After about fifteen minutes, someone comes over to us and says we need to check our coats. We explained that we were told there was no more room and the person very rudely responded "well there is room now". So they make us get up, leave our drinks and go back over to the coat check line where once again we are told that there is no more room! We have been coming here for three years for New Year's Eve and will not be returning after this experience.
2017-12-29,3,Had the Calamari and Sausage, and did not like it. Only ate half, and a quarter went to waste because the rest of the group didn't finish it. Ordered some fries, those were good. Beer was good too. Service lacked a bit and the trivia was a drag that went on and on. Great hangout place though.
2017-12-24,5,Really enjoyed our time last night. Two adults and a toddler. Delicious food and excellent beer selection. We had the pretzel (you must) and the kasespatzle. Our 2 year old had the kids menu Frankfurter. Loved them all. Parking was easy to find on the street and paid $3 for 3 hours parking. Only issue for us was no high chairs or booster seats. Our 2 year old fell off the bench once and was very squirmy bc she's usually in a seat of some sort. But otherwise we can't wait to go back!
2017-12-22,4,One of the nicer beer gardens I've been too. Beer was very good, service friendly.  We had the sausage platter, calamari, Brussels sprouts- all nicely prepared (I'd maybe skip the potato pancakes). Pretzels were outstanding! And if you have room definitely try the bread pudding
2017-12-19,3,Our waitress totally messed up our bill tonight, we got charged full price on half off Tuesday. Didn't catch the mistake until we left - then was too late to go back. Tuesdays are the best and worst day to go, great for 50% off most food and beer but the crowds and overextended servers makes the dining experience stressful.
2017-12-19,5,I live in Hoboken and this is by far my favorite bar and restaurant in the area! I can barely lift their large beer, you need two hands! Huge variety of fancy beers, and the food is delicious. The food from the grill is very reasonably priced, especially for Hoboken. The grill even has a few delicious vegetarian options, which I wouldn't expect from a German themed restaurant. The atmosphere is great, it's a really beautiful place. There are huge long tables that are perfect for parties. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about beer. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great night out in Hoboken.
2017-12-15,3,It's hard to rate this place based on my experience(s) as I have different opinions on various elements, so I will rate in parts based on two visits:Food 2/5 - The pretzel is amazing, very soft and great for an appetizer. I was impressed when I saw the sauerbraten on Burgers, Brews, & Que on the Food Network, so I decided to try. The sauerbraten in my opinion, and I don't mean to be harsh, but it was awful. The texture was just right, as the beef shoulder was very tender and fell apart with my fork, but the taste was terrible. The beef has an overwhelming taste of maple syrup, and the pretzel dumplings lacked in flavor. The green beans were extremely soggy, and the braising liquid completely covered the plate, giving the other elements of the dish a maple syrup flavor as well. The wiener schnitzel also lacked in flavor, it tasted like dry chicken fingers. Overall, I wouldn't come back here for the food, only drinks as they have a very good beer selection. Drinks 5/5 - I loved the variety of beers and trying beers that I can't get anywhere else. The atmosphere is perfect for a German setting and is a great place to meet with friends. Service 5/5 - Both visits our waitresses were very friendly and very personable. I had no issues with them, and gave them good tips.Management 0/5 - TERRIBLE The restaurant was running a promotion for 50% of purchase of gift cards for one day only - so I went ahead and purchased. I asked the lady who was selling it to us if there were any restrictions on the use of the gift card (ex. can it be used any day of the week, can it be used on food and drinks, can it be used on happy hour). She said I can use it as a regular gift card and there were no restrictions, even on promotional days. I bought two sets of gift cards. The first gift card was used for the food explained above. The waitress mentioned that the gift card can only be used for house drinks and select beers, which we were never told. She spoke to her manager and made the exception and used the gift card for the check balance. Again, we asked her what restrictions there was for the gift card as we had another set and would use them for a second visit just for drinks. She said we can't use the gift card for anything that was half off. On our second visit, we came on a Tuesday coincidentally (50% everything with cash). Since our final check balance was more than the gift card and we didn't have cash anyway, we expected to use the gift card to pay the bill and the rest with credit card, totally fine with paying full price. Our server mentioned that the manager said the gift cards are not accepted on Tuesdays, and we asked to speak with him. We told him the entire story, but he was very rude and disrespectful, as he kept interrupting me when I spoke and raised his voice. I told him that there was no mention anywhere about gift cards not accepted on Tuesdays, he mentions that he can "create restrictions whenever he wants," which is absolutely ridiculous and completely unprofessional. Although he did make the exception and accepted the gift card (after much debate) I did not like his attitude and do not appreciate his unprofessionalism. This place is a great place to drink and hang out with friends and try a variety of beers, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the food (except the pretzel) and hopefully no one has an issue with management. I'd much rather go to Zepplin Hall in Jersey City, the food is better and it's also another great place to hang out.
2017-12-11,5,One of my favorite bars to go to! The best pretzels and beers the size of your head, what more could you ask for!
2017-12-07,5,I can't come here often enough -- it's a must if you're looking for delicious food and a great vibe. It's usually pretty crowded no matter when we visit (Friday night, Saturday brunch, Sunday evenings) but somehow the crowd only adds to the experience, even if you're sitting next to a group of complete strangers. The variety of beer is unparalleled (particularly the Praga dark, which reminds me of my time spent studying abroad) and the food is the best in town. From the huge Bavarian pretzel, to the wiener schnitzel, sausages and other German fare... right to the burgers, fries, and even a dessert or two (the apple strudel is out of this world) you seriously cannot go wrong.  My only complaint is that it's a bit annoying that you can order certain things from the menu, but still have to go to the grill (cash only) if you want sausages or burgers. That said, I'm always ready, willing and able to fork over my cash for more of their food!
2017-11-18,5,Great craft and draft beer selection. Their food menu doesn't stay behind either. This is a true Biergarten. Love the atmosphere and the charm of the staff.
2017-11-11,1,Is this a kindergarten? There are so many kids here. Irresponsible parents letting their kids run around in a bar...only in Hoboken.  30 people showed up for a kids party without reserving space with a huge bag of blocks for the kids. This is my last trip here.
2017-10-30,4,If you don't mind the area at night (my friend was freaking out a little that we were going to an abandoned warehouse area in Hoboken lol) then this is a must-go-to spot if you love german beer, grilled bratwurst, and good atmosphere for hangout!Arrived pretty late on a friday night/saturday mornight to get some beer and food and even though the kitchen was closed, you can still order at the grill - just bring cash. My last $12 cash went to the grilled bratwurst (that costed EXACTLY $12 thank goodness). Love weissbier and this place doesn't disappoint. Take your not so boring friend/group of friends here and have a blast.
2017-10-29,3,I wanted to get some lunch and came across this place on Yelp. I know German food well, so wanted to give them a try. When I arrived, this was a typical beer hall, cool ambience with many long tables, a grill area and bar. I decided to go for the grill because I wanted to try the Bratwurst. It was freshly prepared right there and was ready within 10 mins. Brats come with a side of fries, bread or cucumber salad and sauerkraut. Overall, pretty satisfied with the food so far and I may go back to try something else.Now, to get to the negatives. I got some cash out because I drove 40 mins to come here and would have been really mad had I not been able to get anything. So, like any restaurant, they accept credit cards, BUT:1) There's a minimum charge for a credit card...absurd2) All the grill items i.e. Brats, Kielbasa, etc is CASH ONLY. The staff even made a point to comment on the sign amongst themselves while I was standing there.This is a big restaurant, so both of these are ridiculous. CC fees aren't that high so don't pass them on to the customer and the fact that half the menu is CASH ONLY and the rest is not is just plain stupid and highly inconvenient. I hate establishments that offer flexible payment options or have ambiguities surrounding them.As far as promotions, the website advertises daily specials although seems the staff makes no mention of them. I ordered brats which come with basically a complimentary beer. Having known this, I mentioned it to the bar tender and he got it for me. At the grill, no one said anything about a combo deal. That's bad marketing and training of staff, but they know to make sure the cash only sign is highly visible. Their loss, cause now I got a free beer for saying something.Pretty good first experience, but the owner should look into addressing the negatives. Cash only is a pain in the ass and frankly pathetic for a large restaurant that can make good margins of food and alcohol sales. Then, first time here and the staff just seems to do the bare minimum and then there's waitresses hiding by the grill, slumped just playing on their phones.....great first impression in that regard..
2017-10-29,4,Offers a lot of options for seating indoors and outdoors. Pretzels are amazing! Great beer selections and change with the seasons.
2017-10-22,5,I really liked this location. There is also a Biergarten in Jersey City but I prefer the Hoboken location. They have huge pint size beer and great German food specialities. I went with the Bavarian pretzel and it came with a spicy mustard and spicy cheese dip. Delicious! Also loved the potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce.They have live music and outdoor seating. Definitely a fun night out and different vibe from other Hoboken bars. Good for big groups too!
2017-10-17,5,Had a great time here with all the delicious German beer selections. The German pretzel with the cheese cheese sauce is on point and the bratwurst with the sour kraut also great. The bartender was awesome in authentic German attire knowledgeable ably all the beers, charismatic and helpful with the selection process. The gentlemen making the brats was fast and skilled behind the grill and fun to see how quick he is. The environment was awesome with the authentic wooden German beer garden Oktoberfest tables and decor. Everything is German which is perfect and fun like going away Jun vacation to Europe. They didn't have the winter wine yet gluwein but I was told next week. I'll be back fo sure!
2017-09-12,4,Great atmosphere and tasty food. Extensive beer menu too (as expected). Great place to catch up with friends and listen to some live music.
2017-09-12,1,Take care to read the fine print. "our kitchen is closed mondays but our grill is always going..." That means I spent $ to park but couldn't order goulasch.
2017-09-11,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken! This is an ideal place to meet up with a group of friends because the space is large and loud and caters to crowds. It's also family friendly and you will certainly see many strollers parked at the ends of the large wood picnic tables. I never come here without getting a turkey burger with Greer cheese. It's heavenly and their French fries are ridiculously yummy. You MUST get be pretzel with the cheese dipping sauce. I would suggest you split it so that you have room for the turkey burger I just convinced you to order. I am not a beer snob but the staff is always super helpful when helping me select something similar to what I normally drink (shout out to my fellow lager lovers.)The outdoor space is large and has a projection screen setup for good games. Even when it gets colder, they have heat lamps so you don't freeze. Definitely check this place out. Parking is way easier uptown by the beer garden FYI.
2017-09-09,5,This place is amazing! Well-lit, cozy atmosphere with nice music. I tried a bunch of beers here and particularly enjoyed the Steigl. I was delighted to find quite a few vegetarian options on the menu and ordered the vegetarian Käsespätzle. It was absolutely delicious and had a side salad that complimented the cheesiness of the dish very well. And there was live music! So if you're looking to knock back a few beers and enjoy some delicious food in a great atmosphere, Pilsner Biergarten is the place to be!
2017-08-21,1,Sitting here now and I cannot believe what I just heard. The "chef" at the grill says he can't make anymore burgers. He just waived a bunch of orders and said I have all these to make. The place is at about 20% capacity so I can't understand what they do when it's packed. What a shame. If there were proper supervision maybe this wouldn't happen. I would fire this guy on the spot.
2017-08-18,1,Excellent atmosphere, but to push people out at 1:45 and not allow them to piss before leaving is unreasonable.
2017-08-15,2,This place is really over-rated. It benefits from its original sausage expertise, not common in the city. But the service is what kills it all. Unfriendly, extremely slow, all but helpful (think "each man for himself" kind of vibe), waiters and staff members just ruin the experience. You can find amazing sausages at other restaurants in Hoboken (Elysian, Anthony Davis to name only two I know). Try at your own risk, with a great deal of patience.
2017-08-12,5,This is probably my favorite place in Hoboken.   The beer is fantastic.  The food is always delicious (the pretzel........there are no words for how good this thing is).  Whenever we have guests visiting from out of town we bring them here for dinner.  Can get crowded but it's a beer garden in Hoboken so I think that's to be expected.
2017-08-08,4,Pretty reliable place to grab a brew and chill with friends.  Do like their beer selection here compared to other places because they carry a good variety of imports from Germany.  Selection also rotates according to seasonality.The kitchen quality here is also very decent as well.  Have tried a variety of plates here and nothing disappoints.  Favorite would be the bier mussels & the calamari w/ chorizo.  They also have a cash only grill area that pretty much has all the usual grill favorites such as brats and burgers covered.Best night to come is probably Thursday when they have live music.
2017-07-31,3,It was an ok environment. However, the waitress asked to borrow our menu and never brought it back with in turn caused for us not to even bother ordering food. Our drinks were decent but we only got order one drink as our waitress never came back to the table. The environment was nice and calm, even though there was music.
2017-07-23,4,Sat at the bar to have a few beers and grab a quick lunch. Faraway the star of the day were the french fry's I found hanging sideways very precipitously from my salad plate. What a delicious surprise! My Haiku to these ninja fry's:Where did you come from?Exquisitely balancingMystery spuds
2017-07-23,4,Came here with a big group on a Saturday night for my friends birthday. This place is "popping" and definitely a lot of fun. The issue is finding a seat or somewhere to sit. People were a bit rude and aggressive and tend not to want to share seats so every one could sit. We got a lot of food and it was delicious. The beer selection is pretty standard for a German Beer Garden but still good. Now... prob one of the weakest thing done well by this restaurant is their sausage line. The grills and cooks cook everything made to order. There was a long line and wait (20-25) for sausages. We all thought it didn't warrant them to wait for sausages to be made to order. Highly inefficient.
2017-07-22,4,This is a good place to enjoy a good beer.  The location quiet as we rode our bikes there.  This is a German bier garden theme.  They have traditional German food and beers.  Most importantly they have a good selection of craft beer, not the typical AB owned craft beer alliance brands but true craft beers local and well known brands.  There also have a nice selection from lighter beers to IPAs Sours and Stouts.
2017-07-18,5,Came here last week with a huge group (15+) and had an awesome time! Started off outside but moved things indoors when the rain started. The staff was friendly and helpful. I even asked them to turn the volume up in a different seating area so we could hear the trivia and play along. The food was also super tasty! The grill items are ordered separately from a cash only line inside the bar. The rest of the food can be ordered as normal. Everything came out quick and hot and lived up to a typical German pub quality. It's a great spot to eat and hang out with friends. Will definitely be back for trivia and food another Wednesday!
2017-07-15,5,First time here! All we had to do is tell the bartenders what we normally drink and we were more than presently surprised by what they offered us! Jimmy is an awesome bartender! So personable! Busy for a Saturday night but you wouldn't know it!!! Definitely will be back!
2017-07-14,5,Where to start?! This is hands down my favorite spot in hoboken and you can find me there most weekends (& some Tuesday's for their 50% off menu nights!) Staff is amazing - so friendly and thorough. Food is beyond your normal beer garden expectations - best pretzel around, amazing salads and the grill serves up some rockin' burgers, sausages and chicken. And of course - the BEER! Standard menu is great but I love that they always have a few new craft selections!! IPA all day anyone?! Fun for a night out with friends or to stop in with the kiddos in tow earlier in the afternoon/ eve.
2017-07-07,1,There is a bouncer here that was exceptionally rude to myself and my friends. Started yelling in my face that I couldn't go upstairs due to a wedding and then if I had a problem about that he'd kick me out. He said I was making a face and that is why he was yelling. Would avoid this place based on that. Not sure his name but he had on MANY gold plated chains.
2017-07-05,5,I think we've become regulars here.There's usually a bouncer and now they just wave us off whenever we come-- either my boyfriend looks old or they recognize us-- because my face is not one of an older lady.So, on Tuesdays during the college school year, this place is packed full of Stevens students.  I am part of that crowd admittedly, but it is best on these days to get there literally at 4-6.  6-7 is where it starts to get crowded.  Over the summer, it is pleasant to sit outside and we've gotten there at 5:30-6 and it isn't too bad.  We usually have a table to ourselves (two of us) which occasionally another couple joins us as there are few other tables.  Unfortunately, outside there is occasionally smokers (ew, not sure if that's allowed) so you have to be careful where you sit.It's a mixed bag crowd. Young students, professionals, and mom's with strollers all come here.  Tuesdays are the busiest I hear, and it's understandable as most things off the menu are 50% off.  This place is only worth it in my opinion if the food is discounted.We get the Bavarian pretzel, which comes buttery, salty and hot with a pickle, beer cheese, and mustard.  The mustard varies in heat each time we go, so just be careful if you can't handle it.  This is the one thing we suggest to people for their first time here.We also get the Kase-spaetzle, which is basically cheesy, fried noodles.  We aren't salad people but it comes with a cucumber salad which is delightfully vinegary and a regular salad.  I think it comes with sauerkraut too but I cannot remember.  It is tasty, like mac and cheese.  I still struggle with pronouncing it though.Oddly enough, and I know this is a crime, the pinot grigio here is light and refreshing, and a bit sweet but not overly so.  Would highly suggest if you like pinot grigio.  Very cheap when 50% off, and always served cold.You have to order from the grill for many items on the menu (the waitress will tell you so if you try to order certain things).  When I was eating pork, I got the Bratwurst with fries and sauerkraut. I like the fries a lot (freshly fried and crispy), and you can get barbecue sauce near the grill.  My boyfriend gets the Weisswurst, which is veal but kind of tastes weirdly chicken-y to me. He likes it though. I got the chicken sausage when I cut out pork, but it doesn't really taste like much and it's kind of tough.  It's too bad the turkey burger isn't 50% off.The dessert items are decent on Tuesdays, although not outstanding, they are worth it for 50% off.  We've tried all of them.Other items that are good are the schnitzel and the mussels.  The mussels are especially good if you get a side of fries to dunk in the broth, yum!
2017-07-04,1,Super annoying.  Just left before we even walked in.  Hours say til 2am and yet we were told kitchen closed at 10pm and bar was closing at 11pm.  Frustrating when you bragged about the pretzels and beer to out of town family.
2017-06-25,4,Good Wiener schnitzel and a good vibe!There is a spin class that happens at one corner of the restaurant, which is pretty odd. After their class, they came t the bar and it was pretty unappetizing to smell their body odors while trying to eat.
2017-06-24,3,Great special on Tuesday for the half price deals. Most of the food was delicious like the kasespatzle and mussels however what they describe as a charcuterie is absolutely horrendous STAY AWAY from that one. This would be a 4-5 place however we had quite possibly the worst server I've ever had in my life. Would be willing to give this place another chance though just hopefully with a different server.
2017-06-18,4,I came here with a group of 8 people after a friend recommended us to check it out. We found street parking near the venue. We came on a Sunday night around 10 pm so it wasn't crowded, but it was the perfect venue for a group of friends to just hang out and talk. When we sat down, a waitress immediately came up and was accommodating, explaining to us the specials and answering any questions we had about the specialty beers they carried. The beers and ciders we ordered were around $7-8 a bottle/glass and we also ordered the giant pretzel. It came with a delicious buttery-cheese spread and a sharp mustard. The venue has a really rustic feel and the ambience was great. Each table had a candle stick for dim lighting and there was a big tv screen. The staff was super accommodating when we wanted to change the channel to watch the NBA playoffs! I'm glad we came on a calm night but I definitely need to come back when it's busier!
2017-06-18,4,Took the short drive from home after seeing this place on Food Network's "Burgers, Brew and Que" I love the atmosphere at beer gardens and always looking to find a good German spot. Parking was not bad even on a Saturday early evening. There is 4 hour metered parking but only up til 9pm so getting there around 7pm I wound up only paying $1.50 for 2 hours. Unfortunately when we got there it started to rain lightly so we opted to go indoors instead of the partially umbrella covered tables in case it got worse. Indoors the place was pretty full and lively with music on and TVs playing sports.  We seated ourselves at one of the large communal tables and ordered a couple of beers and a pretzel to munch on before dinner. Pretzel was huge and came piping hot with a spicy brown mustard and a cheese spread. It was buttery and slightly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. For dinner I ordered the Sauerbraten which was almost the single reason I came after seeing it on the show. My friend wanted to order the Polish kielbasa but was told he needed to go to the self service grill in the back and pay for it in cash. Somewhat inconvenient but not a big deal. My food arrived just before he got back with his, about 10-12 minutes and neither of us were disappointed. His was tasty, grilled with a nice snap on the casing and a side of crispy shoestring fries. The sauerbraten exceeded expectations. So many flavors and textures from a combination of the fall apart tender meat, the apple dumpling, red cabbage, mini mushrooms, crisp brussel sprouts and string beans. I managed to eat about half and still have enough left for another full meal. Overall great environment, good service and prices. Worth another visit.
2017-06-18,4,This was my first time at a Biergarten and I loved it. I think the community tables are awesome, it's a great way to meet people. The service was pretty good, note that for specific items you must order them on your own at the grill. I had the grilled chicken sausage; I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. Give it a try! My bf ordered a classic cheeseburger and said it was good, nothing crazy good though. The beer was also great, they have a large menu, which was no surprise. I'll definitely come back soon!
2017-06-09,4,Love this place! The beer selection is amazing, the seating is excellent, the service incredible!!!But.There's always a but.The charcuterie board.Let me paint you a picture. Beautiful wood board. Cornichon. Salami. Cheddar.Then... feta? ONE rolled piece of prosciutto? BALONEY? Like, a LOT of baloney!?! And NO BREAD???I have come here probably 10+ times while hanging Hoboken. I have NEVER been let down by this place until now.So, come here with your friends! Enjoy the beers and the ambiance! But if you're looking for charcuterie, forget this place.
2017-06-09,5,Missing Ladi tonight with Fordham friends We are so happy on the outside garden. Half price Wiener schnitzel and substitute spatzel for potatoes if you like, no price change. Pilsner Urquel and all draft $19 per pitcher.All happy and under $40 each.Buttner, Chiaramonte, DeYoung love the German food.  Families, friends parties in a new neighborhood!
2017-06-06,4,This was our first time here. Fun atmosphere (we went to watch a soccer game).  Service was very good and our waitress was friendly. Food was great (try the pretzel!). Only negative was the food from the grill (kielbasa, bratwurst, frankfurter, etc) was expensive in my opinion.
2017-06-03,1,Just had a birthday party here. The service was awful. I will give the place credit for the nice ambiance but I do believe they took advantage of us considering 20% tip was included. We had to wait a while for beer and a VERY long time for appetizers to come to our table. As part of the party package, everything was supposed to be steadily flowing throughout our 3 hours there. We had to ask the waitress multiple times for beer and appetizers. Very long wait for everything. I would not recommend booking a party here.
2017-05-30,4,Great place to grab a few beers and watch a football game. Love the atmosphere of downstairs.  Food is at 7.4/10. Brunch was surprisingly good.Excellent place for groups. Not too many options for vegetarians. If you have dietary restrictions, go for brunch.My only complaints are that 1) it gets to be too "clubby" on weekends. Upstairs is a flat out club. 2) Sunday brunch can be a little hectic with so many small kids running around (but hey, they can't help that); and 3) I wish they let dogs hang out on the outside.
2017-05-20,5,This place is great. The beer is great, the atmosphere is great, everything is great. You will not regret coming here. It is always a fun time
2017-05-13,1,This was my second time here. The first time was a lot of fun but the second time had horrible bouncers. They were rude and I'll never go back to this place again
2017-05-10,5,Five stars if you know when to go... if you like a scene, do weekend eves. If you go with kids, go early or on the Tuesday cash only discount menu night. Like the waitstaff and the excellent beer and food selection. Great addition to Hoboken.
2017-04-24,4,Updating my review after a recent brunch experience at Pilsener Haus.  I ate in the main room, and yes, it was teaming with toddlers. But all the same, it was kinda chill.  I think I am ready to throw in the towel and admit that beer gardens belong to people with small children more than to people with babysitters or people with no children.  Part of the reason I found the brunch atmosphere to be chill was they have a great duo playing smooth jams of the 1970s and 1980s in the main room, and the volume of their instruments and speakers was PERFECT.  You could hear the music and the guy singing, but it wasn't too loud or over bearing.  Also fell in love with a Belgium beer (Malheur Golden Ale) on this visit.
2017-04-23,4,Cool place, very big, very casual. Food is pretty good too. The bartenders seem nice but the wait staff has been a little rude.
2017-04-18,4,Excellent variety of German brews and food in a traditional biergarten atmosphere. It gets crowded here at times but I've always managed to find a bench to squeeze in to. Staff are very friendly and this place is family friendly on the weekends! Great contributor to the Hoboken scene.
2017-04-18,3,Totally fun place, extensive selection of beer, friendly staff and a darn good pretzel and dip! The DJ started off right on point on Saturday night playing fun danceable music and at some point they made the terrible mistake of playing old karoke type pop rock music and it totally killed the vibe. I'd definitely give this place a second shot but I certainly hope that next time (especially on a Saturday night) they keep the dance music bumping and leave the corny pop rock for a weekday or a Sunday when people might be more likely to sing along vs wanting to dance and get their boogie on!
2017-04-15,3,It's a biergarten...don't expect anything special. The food is decent, but the beer is overpriced. It gets packed, but it's also kid friendly. If you are looking for a biergarten, this is your only choice in town.
2017-04-06,4,Always a good time at beirgarden! Usually come on Tuesday's when everything is half off. There's always a crowd. Servers are attentive. Can't wait to enjoy their outdoor seating when it goes warmer!
2017-04-02,5,My husband is as German as German gets. He grew up in east Germany and we only recently moved to the states from the UK, and if he had it his way, we would be living in Bavaria eating pork knuckle every day. Alas, I won the argument for now to move back near my family in New York. When we moved to Hoboken a few months ago, we were really pleased to find this place. Coming here makes my husband really happy and its a place where he really feels at home and has a connection to his culture. While it's not a spitting replica of a traditional German beer hall, it actually is not as far off as you would think, and aside from the German connection, we have a great experience every time we come here (which I must admit is now becoming every friday night). What I love about this place is that the vibe is really chilled out. There is no pretension that the usual NYC bar has, and the crowds here have ranged from parents with small babies, visiting tourists, locals, and a girls night out. The beer is varied, cold and fresh, and the food is tasty. They have the best goddamn hot pretzel I have ever tasted in my life, and I would also recommend trying the brussel sprouts (surprising I know but they are DELICIOUS), potato pancakes and the goulash. All in all, we really love this place. We feel at home, the drinks and food are very delicious in my opinion, and it has a lot of charm and soul that seems to have disappeared from most other establishments these days. Try the pretzel if nothing else!!
2017-04-01,5,What is there not to love about this place? Excellent selection of German beer and THE best pretzel in all the land.
2017-03-26,5,Great unique location with a small biergarten, great selection of beer and food! A place I love to go , friendly staff and after or before past Hamilton Park , great view to Manhattan
2017-03-24,5,Wiener schnitzel was unexpectedly delightful! As was the beer selections, I would most definitely return next time I'm in Hoboken NJ.
2017-03-23,4,Good bratwurst, good fries, tried two different wines and both tasted old. Trivia was fun on wednesdays.
2017-03-22,5,Great Austrian food! Johanna was our host and she did an amazing job. She was very friendly and provided great suggestions. The fried Brussel Sprouts were amazing! The Wiener Schnitzel was awsome. Definitely will come back when in the area.
2017-03-22,4,Wide beer selection if you are a fan of pilsners, ciders & European beers. Some bartenders there are extremely friendly, helpful and knowledgeable on their pours. Most beers are priced okay, but many more expensive. Giant pretzels look amazing (haven't experienced one first hand).The "garden" itself is rather small, about a dozen picnic tables, but the indoor venue is large and lofty. The open kitchen smoke and grill is a cool sight. Place seems to be packed 75% of the day. Only con really was the amount of little children and toddlers running around the place - some unsupervised. I know Hoboken is a mecca for young families, but a biergarten is not a place for them, ever - day or night.
2017-03-21,4,This is my go to place when me and my fiance want to go have a great time, drink lots of beer and eat amazing bratwurst's that are cooked right in front of you at the grill.Is it as authentic as something you might find in Munich or Hamburg? Of course not. It's Hoboken. It's the land of "Bro's and Brittney's" and you'll never find a time that this place isnt filled with those types.But interspersed with that is a nice little diverse mix of people who make this place steer far away from the annoying scenes you might find in no-longer-hidden gems in Manhattan or queens. People just looking to have a non-pretentious good time, have some drinks and some good bar food to go along with it.HIGHLY recommend getting that bavarian pretzel. Super soft and delicious and great to split with someone. Bratwursts and Kielbasa are solid and come with a heaping portion of freshly cooked fries. Lots of seating (huge tables with benches), and an outdoor area too. This place gets PACKED, but never too packed that you wont enjoy yourself.If you want to have those Brats and stuff, make sure you come with cash (although there are ATM's near the restrooms). Grill is cash only.And make sure you get the big beer. Not the little wimpy pint. Not many places you can basically drink a mini keg all to yourself :)
2017-03-16,4,Sometimes it's hard to find a space for larger groups but overall it's pretty reliable. If you order food, order the pretzel! It never disappoints.
2017-03-16,4,It's good, went here last year in the summer. Nice staff and food food ( I didn't felt like it was super German tho) and I was little sad that nobody was German or could at least speak it. But I guess because I am from Germany I was maybe little too picky about the food.My American friends loved it and it was nice to sit outside, not too packed! Definitely coming back!
2017-03-14,4,Came in at around 6 on a Sunday and it wasn't too packed. Our party of three managed to grab one of the last spots in one corner of a table. That being said, I can imagine that if you're a large group, it would probably be pretty hard to get seating. To start we ordered one of their giant pretzels. It comes with some mustard, and some type of (beer cheese?) dip. The pretzel was really soft and fresh, and I LOVED the beer cheese. If you can, save some of the beer cheese for your sausage. We ordered the jalapeño cheddar frankfurter, and the bratwurst. The frankfurter just tastes like a hot dog with cheese inside. I couldn't really taste the jalapeño. The bratwurst was great. I'd definitely order this one again. Each order comes with three links, sauerkraut, and fries and was enough for three people. Just make sure you have cash because for all of the sausages, and burgers, you will have to order yourself at the grill and they do not accept credit cards.I only got to try their Oktoberfest brew, but I really enjoyed it. I'll be sure to try some other beers next time.Tip - I read on Yelp that on Tuesdays, it's 50% off food and drinks. I kind of want to come back for that, but I'm also afraid of how crowded it will be. Maybe I'll try when it gets warmer, once they open up the outdoor seating.
2017-03-14,5,We had a great experience last Sunday. Robyn, manager,  helped me plan a group event after a memorial service. She handled everything and our two servers were outstanding. The room we were in was perfect for our group of over 80 people. The old, bar room style of long wooden tables was perfect for our group. Large hot pretzels and sausage platters were delicious!Thank you for making our experience enjoyable.
2017-03-11,4,Took my clients there who were asking for a casual German experience. We started with potato cakes, mussels with sauerkraut, calamari and sausage appetizers which were all very filling. As it was still before 7 we made use of the happy hour and ordered a few more sausages and sides; all very good. Nice overall beers selection of German beers. Only reason I give 4 stars is you need to go buy sausages from the grill yourself and the entree selection is very limited, most beer garden food. We will be back.
2017-03-07,4,Would be five stars based on Tuesday nights, but besides that I'd probably give it three. Tuesday's though... 50% off all good/drink. Can't go wrong. Gets a little packed but just makes it an all around great experience.
2017-03-02,4,Great places to grabs drinks and snacks. Enjoyed there light lemon tasting beer and pretzel. The inside is very large especially compared to the outside area.
2017-02-26,2,The night I went here it was so overcrowded. Basically standing room only except for the tables outside on the patio in the cold of winter. Had to push, shove and yell just to get to the bar to order some beers. Plus the glasses they give you are pint size and larger so kind of tiring to carry around without having a place to sit. The beer was really good and a large selection but the huge crowd full of rude people killed the whole experience.
2017-02-22,4,I went here with colleagues after work one day on a Tuesday. They have 50% off everything on the menu during happy hour. The waitress was very knowledgeable of the drink menu and helped me chose a beer I would like. The goulash was to die for! I will definitely return to take advantage of this awesome Tuesday happy hour in the near future. It does get pretty packed so I would recommend getting there before 6.
2017-02-14,3,This place is great for the obvious, beer. Great selection, authentic German feel to the place. However, I'm going to only give this place three stars because it's super large and although most beer gardens are just as large, I think this place should just remain on the first floor. This floor has the patio, food are and a lower ground level that has this true German feel to it. Nevertheless, it's really nice being as though it used to be a factory (I've been told). As far as food goes, it's rather mediocre. If you're looking for something basic while having some beer you should be fine but other than that I wouldn't really go out of my way to dine here. Finally, this place is really awesome for dancing on the weekends and their DJs tend to be really good. So all in all, this is a solid spot to go to.
2017-02-06,4,Brats and beers are a must but be careful coming during the cold months as outdoor seating is closed so it's usually hard to find seating. Sunday afternoons are jam packed so try somewhere else if youre looking to swing in for a quick bite to eat. They do take reservations for large parties in the front room.
2017-02-03,4,Great selection of draft beers with giant pretzels to accompany your beverage. I always enjoy coming here. Outdoor seating during the summer is always a plus.
2017-01-31,4,Stopped by Saturday night for a girls night out and had a good time!First time trying the food and my fave was the jalapeño cheddar sausage, crispy fries & the side cucumber salad that came with the spaetzle (?). Spaetzle was average at best, I wouldn't order it again. Reminded me of a chunkier, doughier mac & cheese.I loved how this spot was JAM PACKED but the waiter still managed to bring out our drinks and was so helpful in trying to get us a table. It was a bit too crowded so I'll check it out on a weekday next time.Cant wait to try the schnitzel next time!!
2017-01-29,4,Love the atmosphere, very high quality beers, and the chicken wings are delicious!! (Not sure if it's seasonal but you can get free wings during summer time with your beer during the happy hour). I strongly recommend you to go there!! Just go, do it, and have fun!!
2017-01-07,4,They have a great selection of beers and their pretzels are amazing. They also have a section to order food like sausages and fries. This is a great spot to come with a group of friends to grab a beer and have a good time. Tip: they have an upstairs area that is more like a lounge if you want to reserve it for your group of friends.
2017-01-04,5,Giant beers on tap and the food is incredible. Pretzels with bar cheese and even the brussels sprouts are cooked perfectly.
2017-01-03,4,It's SO great, but gets so loud and crowded. They definitely deserve all the business they get! I love the food!
2017-01-01,4,Fans of beer will feel right at home here with the many varieties to choose from. However, even if you're not keen on beer, which I'm not, there's definitely something for everyone. From the food variety to the two levels of music and dancing, you will definitely have a good time here.The bottom level has many wooden tables and is mostly for sitting down, eating, drinking. The upstairs has more of a club environment so if that's more your thing you can head up there. Aside from beer, they have a full bar so you can pretty much get any drink that you can get anywhere else. I recently tried one of their seasonal offerings which was hot apple cider with rum which was pretty good.I've only been here at night but I would imagine it's a good place to come for lunch and dinner if you're so inclined. It has a very Bavarian feel to it which is pretty cool
2016-12-31,5,We were visiting from Toronto and our friends took us to Pilsener Haus for drinks this past Thursday night. The place itself has a great atmosphere. My fiancé and I had a couple of rounds of the Hacker-Pschorr beer which was delicious. We tried the fried mushrooms, potato pancakes, and pretzel and enjoyed everything (especially the pretzel). The staff was super friendly and attentive. I didn't catch our server's name but he was so great. If we lived in Hoboken this is a place we would visit regularly and we will definitely be back the next time we're in town!
2016-12-29,5,Delicious! Thank you very much! We got earlier and had a great time and drinks and food! We always eat at the bar and guys are very friendly !
2016-12-05,5,Great place. Good dogs , good wine, very cheap on Tuesday, great Service staff except a rough and gruff guy at the grille machine. May be effect of heat. Must place
2016-11-30,5,What a great find strangely I did not know of this place. Loved the rustic brick feel to the place with the whole Sausage fest. The beers are great and the live band added the additional zest to the exploration of this place. Sadly I went there when it was cold, cant wait to enjoy a summer evening there
2016-11-29,5,Went for Monday Happy HourFood - 5/5. The Bavarian soft pretzel is the perfect food for when you're craving that doughy goodness of a pretzel. The chew is amazing and the dips make it even tastier. Chicken wings were crispy with a tiny bit of kick and very tender. The bratwurst had great grilled flavor and the texture was a great blend of savory bite and soft filling. The sauerkraut was also a cut above the rest as you can taste the pickling seasoning of the sauerkraut but the cabbage still had that crisp bite to it; the quality proves it is made in-house!Service - 4/5. Professional and friendly. Our group came a bit earlier than their opening hours but the waiter was accommodating and courteous the entire time.Value - 5/5. On Mondays the menu is limited to the grill but on the plus side you get a free order of chicken wings with your beer. The bowl contains a large amount of wings (the one I got had nine) and they are delicious to boot. The deal is really hard to pass and since all the food is delicious, its a great spot for German cuisine.Parking - Street (Metered)
2016-11-20,4,Fun place to hang out with friends. It is sometimes difficult to find a place to sit, but the beers are good and I recommend ordering food from the grill! We come here sometimes just for the burgers!
2016-11-18,4,Tuesday night is the night to come rage! Half off pretty much entire menu makes it a pretty decent deal. Good selection of beers and much better food selection compared to JC. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food choices for the most part (giant pretzel, mussels, veal sausage), but the cheese plate did not get good reviews. Did have an issue with the grill cook being hard to deal with. Gets pretty crowded around dinner time but there is outdoor seating as well. Only street parking (or garage), but it's far away from Washington that there shouldn't be an issue.
2016-11-07,4,I went for the first time yesterday.  It lools great.  They did a great  job with the old school industrial  look. The food was good beers were  nice and cold. I was surprised  to see so many kids and babies  taking up seating room. Its pretty expensive as well  but its a nice spot to check  out
2016-11-06,4,Go for the pretzels! Came here on a trip to Hoboken with friends. I'm not into beer so that part is wasted on me but the food was good. Especially the Bavarian pretzel. Doughy, hot, delicious with mustard and a cheese dip. I could eat several of these. Large beer selection. There's a grill too selling German sausages. Good but a bit pricey. We came for brunch and it was very family friendly. At 3:30 the main kitchen switched to dinner and I was able to get a tasty and I think boozy chocolate mousse.
2016-11-02,5,I have been to this place countless no. of times and never had a bad experience till now whether its a quiet weekday afternoon or overcrowded Tuseday/Saturday nights. Its a beer garden with long social tables;you can sit on any table. Once seated, sever will come and take your order. However, sometimes it takes way too long for server to notice, you literally have to wave n call server for your group. Staff here is very friendly here and service is pretty good. Pretzel with beer cheese dip is the best i ever had. Great collection of German beers on tap along with full bar. They alsBeing a vegetarian, i couldn't try their grill food (pick & pay @ grill counter) but my friends love it. Overall, a great place to hangout with friends, play games (they allow to bring your own games) and have good time.  PS - Tuesdays are 50% off almost everything including beers if paid in cash.
2016-10-25,5,This is a fantastic authentic German Bierhaus. The Schweinshaxe was on special, and it's a favorite of mine from a trip that I took to Germany. It was accurately prepared, and although the sides were different from anything I had overseas, it was still quite pleasant. I departed from the purity of my experience by ordering a cider instead of a nice Dunkel, but I observed quite a good variety of draught beer, in addition to what they had in bottles.
2016-10-24,4,I'm generally not a big fan of beer halls, just as they tend to be loud and crowded with only okay beers. Pilsener is actually pretty manageable, although to be fair, I was here on a Sunday afternoon...not exactly prime time from a noisiness standpoint. Nonetheless, it's got a nice brick structure to it that has a good amount of airiness and height at the section next to the outdoor seating, along with a wall-high television projection. The servers circulated often, making sure that we had pitchers at the ready, as well as any food. The beer here is actually quite solid - I do like the focus on lesser-known Central European beers, with the German IPA (a nice reddish hue and a full body) and the Oktoberfest lagers standing out in particular. As for the food, it's adequate filler, at least based on the chicken fingers (not the kind of crunchy fried goodness I prefer on the outside) and fries (good, but nothing mind-blowing).That said, the reasonableness of the prices, the nice space, and above-average beers is enough to score this spot a 4. For NYCers, it's only a 10-minute walk from the very convenient ferry over to Manhattan's West Side. I'd consider coming back for another lazy afternoon.
2016-10-23,5,good beer on tap, large open area with seating that makes it easy to meet people
2016-10-20,4,Came here for the first time last weekend and it was a great time! It really is a cool atmosphere whether you're outside or inside. It gets extremely packed but, yeah, it's Hoboken. The beers are humungous! Two hands required to hold it at all times lol. The crowd here was also cool, I had a lot of conversations with random people (bathroom line, waiting for bartender, etc.) and didn't get a snooty vibe from anyone.
2016-10-20,5,Celebrated my birthday at the Pilsener. AMAZING. There was enough space to fit all my friends(at 27 I'm surprised I still have more than 10). The beers were fantastic. Wish I tried one of their famous gigantic pretzels. I've heard they're amazing. Given that we had a big group, the vibe was still pretty good. Definitely coming back here.Also, they deliver and even though it does get a little bit pricey, IT'S WORTH IT!
2016-10-17,5,My favorite bar in Hoboken.Biergarten has it all:  a distinctive, characterful setting, plenty of room inside & out, communal seating that facilitates meeting new people, a great (German-focused) selection of beers on tap, satisfying comfort food that pairs well with the beers . . . what more do you need?
2016-10-11,5,This place is a little confusing for first-time visitors. Everywhere is seat-yourself. Once you find a table, the server can take your order for drinks, appetizers, and other kitchen food. If you want to eat Grill food, you need to go and line up to order/pay/pick up at the grill. The grill is definitely worth it (GO ON TUESDAYS --- 50% off!!), and it'd be good to go with a group to try every type of sausage together. A grill platter comes with 2 links, a bunch of sauerkraut, and giant portion of thin fries. DEFINITELY go on the day of your birthday -- you get 1 free pitcher of their beer!DEFINITELY go on a TUESDAY NIGHT for 50% OFF all grill, most apps/food, and most beers IF YOU PAY CASH. (Mixed drinks might be regular priced - ask the server to confirm!)
2016-10-02,3,We came on a Saturday night for the first time, very crowded and disorganized. We walked in and saw a "seat yourself" sign. There were no spots at the tables, and the bar was very crowded. We were left on our own to figure out what to do, and were not so politely told to keep moving. We left to find food elsewhere, came back for drinks later. Drinks were huge and decent selection. We sat in a room off the main room, and after a few hours, again were not so politely told that the room was closing and to move. We were not the only ones in there, and there are nicer ways to say that you were going to close off that room. Would come back to try the food, but will definitely be an afternoon visit.
2016-10-02,5,One of the best spots in Hoboken hands down. The vibes here are awesome. Everyone is always in a loud and joyous mood. The Biergarten here in Hoboken, is a great spot to go to with a large group of people.  It gets crowded during prime time but you can usually find seating in the outdoor/indoor area.  As a beer lover, the beer selection is awesome, especially the imported beer from Belgium and Germany. In addition, the selections change on a frequent basis. If you can come on a frequent basis, always try a different beer here if you can. You won't be disappointed!In terms of food they have a self served grill or you can just order from a waitress. I usually get the giant pretzel or a burger from the grill. Every time I've been here the consistency of the food is always dead on. The food has always tasted the same, so you know what you're getting. Never had a bad meal here.
2016-09-21,4,I'm a fan of this place for large groups. It's usually crazy packed at peak times but you can typically find a place and claim it for the group, especially if you don't mind standing.The beer selection is impressive, and unlike other biergarten's in the area, most of the beers are imported from Europe. They don't offer many 'standard' american beers, but the wait staff is pretty knowledgeable and the beer menu gives good descriptions, so there's no problem finding something you'll enjoy. Don't be afraid to try something you can't pronounce!Seating is all large picnic table / cafeteria style, so you'll be sitting with people you don't know. The wait staff is typically way over worked (but always friendly!), so you'll have to flag them down to get what you want during busy times.Overall, a great stop on a night out!
2016-09-18,4,It is always a great time here. This time we went on Saturday to watch the college football games. The music transition from the eighties all the way up to modern times and it was great. By the time the DJ came on it was a full-blown party. The food was amazing. I forgot what I ordered it was really good sorry but you can try anything you can't lose.
2016-09-16,4,This is a good Biergarten.  It has a good selection of beers.  It is a good space with a lot of room.  I wish it had more outside space like the one in Jersey City, but space is harder to come by in Hoboken.  This is a solid choice for a night out or a couple of drinks.  Hopefully you know the beer garden experience and here, you can find a good one.  This place is fun, friendly and has the right feel.  I do feel their beer list is a little small for a beer garden, but it is still bigger than a regular bar.The food is good.  The chicken, half or wings, are soo good, but the half chicken is pretty small.  The German food is solid.  The giant pretzel with the sauces are awesome!  The overall food is done well.
2016-09-15,5,My favorite bar in hoboken.  A great place with a bunch of different areas. I can sit at the outdoor beer garden all day long. The food is spectacular especially from the grill. For the grill make sure you bring cash since it's cash only. Can use card for everything else. Also amazing they let babies and kids in till about 930 at night. Also extensive beer selection.
2016-09-12,5,Fun atmosphere and good food/beer! Went here on a Sunday evening with a group of four. We were sat right away and our food and drinks came out quickly. The hot pretzel and bratwurst are awesome accompanied with a pitcher of ale.
2016-09-11,1,I couldn't be more angry with a place for bad delivery and customer service. I ordered a bratwurst and kielbasa via Seamless and it took them 2.5 hours to deliver the food. I know that sounds crazy. Here is what happened - I selected this place specifically because the delivery time said 25-35 minutes and that is when I expected to leave work. 35 minutes go by and nothing.... I called at 50 minutes and the guy on the phone said it was "out for delivery." At 1hr 15min I called back and cancelled the order because I wanted to leave work 45 minutes ago. I stop at crappy Chipotle on the way home and eat that stuff. About 45 minutes after I get home my phone rings and it is the delivery driver with my food - 2.5 hours late. Besides not understand why the delivery was at my apt and not work, I was irate that someone would even have the audacity to deliver food that was supposedly cooked hours ago. I called and left a message with the general manager; however, she never called me back. Additionally, the guy on the phone was not apologetic and just said, "we use a delivery service and they took it." You can just transfer risk and responsibility when things go wrong. Get a new vendor.
2016-09-10,4,The Pilsener Biergarten is an awesome space. They have both an outside setup as well as a great interior seating. Our server was a lovely lady whose name I cannot remember. She was very knowledgeable and helpful. I was a little hesitant about this place since I am German so I grew up eating this kind of food. Their overall menu can be ordered from the server, and one time I chose their spaetzle. Sadly, I was not a big fan of it. It was too creamy and way too heavy, as well as bland so I couldn't finish it. They also have, confusingly enough, a different setup if you want to get sausages so you can't order that through your server, and that stand only takes cash. BUT - those sausages are fantastic. Their frankfurters are my favorite and their fries are also superyummy. Try their pretzel too - it comes all piping hot and steamy and it's just heavenly with a nice 1 liter Kolsch on the side! Definitely sticking to the pretzel and frankfurters for future references.
2016-09-08,4,Just don't buy the fries....everything else is perfect.The beer selection was excellent and the bartender was very helpful.
2016-09-06,4,excellent outside bier garten; great service.  specialty beers are pricey, so chose carefully.  Cheerful waitress very helpful.  Right around the corner from the theater, so very nice.
2016-09-02,3,Pretty great during the day - great drinks and excellent food (however if you sit down it's a waitress service only and this gets annoying and confusing with big parties.)However do NOT expect a Biergarten experience at night. It became a fist pumping nightclub - loud dance music, service redbull/vodka, etc. Made it completely unauthentic. If I wanted that I would have chosen one of the other dance bars in Hoboken. Because of these reasons I like the Jersey City Biergarten so much better.
2016-08-28,3,This place used to be so good . What happened? The pretzel used to come with Nutella, nowIs some watery chocolate sauce ;/Disappointed
2016-08-19,4,Love the Biergarten in Hoboken!!  Great selection of beer and I believe they have a great happy hour on Wednesdays!   There is a fairly large outdoor section and inside is huge, with a kind of dark gothic/chic undertone that really makes the Biergarten what it is.  Definitely try the pretzel if you get the food, but everything is pretty good!  Only downside is that it gets pretty crowded and the service may not be as quick as one would like.  Other downside is that some orders you place you need to go inside and place the order.  Other than that it's a great spot and definitely worth checking out!
2016-08-19,4,Love it! The kitchen is open until 11 which was great for us night owls who were ready for dinner at the late hour of 10. My boyfriend has to follow a gluten free diet which might prove challenging at most beer places, but they had one of his favorite gluten free beers on the menu! They also note gluten free items on their menu which is always helpful. For our late dinner, we both ordered the Calamari and Sausage dish which was really delicious and perfectly spiced. We also shared an order of the Bier Mussels. These were some of the more flavorful mussels I have had - so often I think mussels get dried out in the cooking process and don't absorb any of the usually delicious broths they are served in. That wasn't the case with these! To be noted, we did get a handful of "crunchy" mussels in this dish which is a little off putting butI don't hold this against the establishment. The atmosphere of the biergarten is really relaxing and romantic even. It was a perfect place for just the two of us to hang, but there were also several large groups enjoying several rounds of beers surrounding us, so it serves as a social spot as well!  I am not giving them 5 stars yet (we will be back!) for one small reason - when we arrived it wasn't totally clear if we could just sit anywhere and how to place our order. There was an awesome duo playing in the Biergarten and we chose to sit at one of the large community tables. It wasn't until we stopped a staff member to ask how we could order that someone was finally sent to our table. This wasn't a huge deal because we were enjoying just relaxing and enjoying the music, but we were hungry! As a diner, it's important to me to feel welcomed and not to have to ask how to place an order.
2016-08-16,4,One of my favorite Tuesday spots to eat! Service is always great even though it gets CRAZY!!!! Food is yummy and beer selection is top notch....
2016-08-07,4,went for a friends bday.   I LOVE the post industrial vibe (no hipster!).Beer selection and grill food is good.    Very filling and goes w the bier/ale selection.Gteat street parking.Went on a Sunday so not busy.   GREAT outdoor area when not to hot n sunny.Will def go back!   Def more biergaarten then Zepplin!
2016-08-06,5,Went here a while back and enjoyed my time. They have a great selection of beers with great tasting food to go along with it. The seating areas added an open type of vibe and the service was great. This is by far the best bar in Hoboken IMO. Come here and enjoy yourself responsibly.
2016-08-05,5,First thoughts- game of thrones vibe! Low lighting, long tables, candle lights, ect. The food was great! Our server was Christian and he advised us on what to order based on our preference and he guided us perfectly! 100% will go back
2016-08-05,5,Fantastic time here! Fpod, atomosphere, beer, service, all spectacular. Christian was our server and he was in tune with every one of his customers. He did a fantastic job and we will absolutely be coming back to visit him!
2016-07-24,5,The biergarten is my favorite place in Hoboken! I travel all the way from Baltimore MD to visit friends in Hoboken- and this is the only place I get excited to go to every time! Great music and nightlife upstairs for the later crowd. Get the pretzel and a stein!
2016-07-22,4,Big, big, big fan of this place. The sausages are delicious- my favorite is the weisswurst, boiled not grilled. I almost always get the mussels, and at the end I let the fries that come with the sausage sit in that mussel sauce until they're nice and soggy- then DEVOUR! Their Steigl is my favorite beer... its flavorful and right in the middle- not heavy, but certainly not as light as some of their other options. And tastier than the Pilsner in my opinion.I'm not a huge fan of the separate grill and regular menu thing-- you have to order sausages at the grill and regular menu gets table service although everything can be eaten at a table-- I guess this is some sort of traditional beirgarten type thing??? I really don't know. I wish I could just order the grill at the table with everything else. Whatever.Undeniable value on Tuesdays- everything is half off when paid in cash!BUT you gotta come either EARLY or LATE...Between 7:30-9 and you're gonna be stuck hovering around a table waiting for them to leave.  The turnover is quick enough, but it can be annoying. Keep in mind no kids after 9pm and there are a good amount of families dining before then. It's also a poke stop! #nerdlove
2016-07-20,4,Fun place.  Cool atmosphere, both indoors and out.First time here.  Brought my family and everyone enjoyed the food as well as the atmosphere.  We ordered off the main menu (Weiner Schnitzel) as well as the grill menu (Bratwurst & Kielbasa).  Everything was good.We will definitely be back.
2016-07-14,5,Last night in Jersey after spending a few days in NY.  Great German atmosphere.   Great dinner, good beer!!
2016-07-14,4,Great place to stop in Hoboken.  Their brunch on the weekends is great - love their bloody marys! The bartenders there are friendly and open to conversations.  Food is fantastic, we love the grill located in the back! Fun for families to go to as well, and large groups of friends. The fact that the grill is cash only is fairly annoying, as most "cash-only" places are.  Especially when you could pay for it with your card, at the bar that is 10 feet away, if they allowed for it.  Other than that, always happy to stop in for a few drinks and something to eat!
2016-07-11,4,Oh Pilsener Haus. 4.5 stars. Delicious food, fun communal tables, and an environment seemingly more authentic than the real thing. It's funny - I've been to a number of beer gardens in Germany, Poland, etc and this place seems even more "old world" than they are, hahaha. I've tried almost everything on the menu, you can't really go wrong with anything, and the grill is delicious as well. I keep saying I'm gonna try some if the specials, but never quite get around to it (mostly as I like to come on half-price Tuesdays - the best kept secret in Hoboken!). On top of all this, how much fun is a full liter stein of German brew? You can't beat that!So why not a full 5 stars? Well, as others have said, it can be a bit of a hassle to scout out a seat for your crew, then swoop in and grab it before someone else does. A couple times I've had the waitresses find me a spot, but they're always busy and don't always have a minute to help out like that. Regardless, it does make this place unique.
2016-07-07,3,updating, since I ate there.  Food was good, and beer too, however, they put the tip into your bill and then give a new total.  It's not clear that that total is with their suggested tip, so you may accidentally add 20% to that new total (that has the tip in it already).  Sneaky.  Sneakiness docks you a star.
2016-07-03,4,Came here for an impromptu night out with a couple girlfriends. We were looking to stay casual and local. I had a couple bourbon sours- they were alright nothing to write home about. Definitely heavy on the sour mix for my taste but the service was decent. They do how my favorite grapefruit beer on draft there!! Which is exciting because I love that beer and not every place has it! It's definitely a pick up scene although it's cool to come out with your friends and grab a table. I did not eat anything but the pretzel looked delicious! And next time I am having a carb fit I will have to head over and check it out.
2016-06-30,4,Delicious cider on draft (Strongbow) and great selection of cider and beer. My soft pretzel was TDF! There was live music, but it wasn't too distracting, as we were still able to converse. Would love to go back and sit in the garden area.
2016-06-26,4,Great place to grab a beer with friends. The food is pretty good too. I recommend the pretzel and grab a Pilsner Urquell to wash it down. There are some other quality beers on tap too so you'll find something you'll like.
2016-06-24,5,Although I've only been here once it was a really great experience! Of course at any food establishment customer service is extremely important; this place is very deserving of a 5-star for it. We had a really nice waitress (can't remember her name, could be Tiffany?! Or am I making that up...) she was super thorough in her explanations of beer choices and flavor profiles, in addition to popular food items. We ordered the pretzel and was super fluffy and just the perfect saltiness. The dips were really good too! I had the draft beer that was closest to a lemon shandy, and it's 100x better than Leinenkugel! When we were leaving, our waitress gave us a couple samples of the grapefruit beer as well, super generous of her. Can't wait to come back for more delicious food, as I hear you can get food grilled too!
2016-06-24,5,What a cute spot! Looked for most reviewed bar on Yelp and this place came up with amazing reviews...and for good reason! Loved this biergarten! As the name may give away, it's a German beergarden.When we walked in all we really saw was the outside sitting, and with such amazing weather, why would we even think of staying inside? The sitting is communal which is great for being social and making new drinking buddies. Absolutely loved this place. Our waitress was awesome, and the atmosphere was amazing. All the people there seemed to really be enjoying themselves. They do have a Yelp special, until 7pm - we got there after 7, so we were not able to use it.At one point, we needed to use the restroom which is when we realized just how huge the indoor seating area was. They have flags inside of all the countries, and when we were there they were showing the EuroCup soccer games on huge screens inside. There is also a cool projected screen outside against the brick wall. It is barely visible when it's light out, but as it got darker it looked amazing.I will def be back to this spot!! AWESOME PLACEE!
2016-06-21,2,More like kindergarten. The" "buggy crew" has discovered the spacious hall and outside seating, while completely overlooking the fact that this is, in fact, a beer hall. If you love drinking, eating, and socializing while surrounded by baby carriages and infants in every mood, this is now your place, every single night.
2016-06-20,4,It took almost 30 mins for my wifey & I to find the entrance (Google map didn't take us to the entrance) but it was a lovely place when we walked in. Professional bartenders were pretty chill. Liked the good beer and food selections except seeing the server placing dishes on top of garbage was odd.We want to make time and come early before it gets crowded.
2016-06-19,4,Such a cool place!! Great selection of beer. We had a great day. Outdoor garden is really fun plus the food is affordable and delicious!! Enjoy
2016-06-19,5,Love this place. Food is good for a beer hall. Beer is really good. Service can be a little slow, but only because this is the beer hall to beat in Hoboken. 5th or 6th time back. First review.
2016-06-17,5,Great place and atmosphere.  Beer selectione is awesome.  The food is incredibly good . Especially thei r schnitzel and kielbasa . From the desserts I recommend this chocolate musse with raspberry jam I order it every time :):) Again love this place not only for beer lovers.
2016-06-06,3,I really really want to like this place... my first experience was on my birthday two months ago, it wasn't good. It wasn't fair to rate this location terrible bc of a bartender; but he stole my change. It's a busy Saturday night and I'm out for my birthday having some drinks and I gave him a 50 and expected alot of change and I never received it. He swore he gave it to use bit I didn't have that many drinks to forget my change. Whatever. I let that time slide so wm3 weeks later I come with a group of friends because I wanted to redeem this place, I really want to like it!! But another bad experience thanks to a waiter. This time was it and I complained to the manager and on my way out he gave me 100 dollars worth of gift cards. So finally, I went back today since I've had a bad day and needed some drinks. Finally, after three tries I've had a great time. FINALLY!! Maybe this place is just better when it's not crowded and less greedy bartenders and waiters. My bartender was Mason and bar back Mike and they gave me a wonder time. Get beers and get suggestions by them. They have been your saviors Pilsener house!! So othwr than my terrible experiences, they have an outrageous veer selection and out of this world pretzels!!! I would drive the whole 5mibs from my house to get these pretzels!
2016-05-19,5,This is a wonderful place. We went there the other day, four of us Hungarian ladies. We were extremely please with the food and the service as well.. We are very critical when it comes to food since all of us are very good cooks. We were very surprised to see Steak Tartare on the menu, and decided to order 2 for appetizers. It was so good that we immediately ordered two more, and enjoyed it tremendously. The fried mushrooms are excellent as well. We barely had any room for the famous Wiener Schnitzels, but managed to eat it, it was so good. The cucumber salad is to die for.I can recommend this place very much for those who are looking for original, authentic European tastes. I definitely will go back again with my family.Note to owners:  if you'd add  "Fried Cheese" to the menu, it would be heavenly.
2016-05-16,4,I have been there many times. Many types of beers and food matching pretty well. I love grilled calamari salad and the pretzel. Staff is pretty good, but they don't usually care about hospitality. A lot of kids are there, but at 9 pm security usually kick people with the kids out. Fridays and Saturdays are super loud you would never be able to talk. I do not remember the day but we got live music some other day and it was a little awkward for me.  It is a bit difficult to keep your seat as well. People come and take it and servers do not really care because they get your credit card in advance. I give 4 stars only for the food and crazy atmosphere which is nor for everyone for sure.
2016-05-14,4,God that gigantic pretzel is irresistible. After coming here a few times, I thought I would stop ordering it but that day will never come.This beer palace is huge. Huge tables, huge grill, huge TVs. Definitely good for groups of 20 or 30 people.For 2 weeks they have a few special dishes. We tried the smoked and grilled pork ribs. Delish. The meat had this perfect crisp on the outside and tender pork meat right underneath that. Easy to eat as it falls off the bone as you press on it with your fork. Accompanied with a good portion of jicama slaw top with a bit of fresh cilantro and red onions. It tasted as good as the ones served at authentic Mexican restaurants. We had to add a giant pretzel to our meal. It's a decision you won't regret. Yank a piece and dip it into butter or nordic mustard. You can't go wrong either way.  Just a quick negative note I had the half chicken dish last time I was here. It was bland and way too many french fries. Nothing great. Otherwise 5 stars. The beer selection is spectacular and you get to decide how big your mug is going to be. Just don't get escorted out.
2016-05-09,4,This place is located in kind of a crumby area in uptown Hoboken but is very nice on the inside. The bar is big and they have a fine selection of craft beers. The staff is friendlier when compared to some downtown Hoboken bars.We had a party room with about 50+ people. It was a little small but big enough for a live band and dancing. Good food though I had mostly beer.   Definitely would come back in spite of the bad location because of the great beer selection and large space around the bar.
2016-04-29,5,Hands down my favorite spot to grab a beer in Hoboken. Amazing authentic biergarten vibe with top notch choice of beers to choose from. Don't even think about not trying their pretzel, it goes well with any beer.
2016-04-27,5,Yummy beer, yummy food (bratwurst & the huge pretzel with the addicting butter?) and fun place to be!
2016-04-26,4,Excellent beer selections. Happy hour deals are great. On Thursdays you can get a beer and brat meal (with fries) for just $10. Outdoor seating is prefect for a nice day. And lots of room inside as well.
2016-04-26,5,Away from the parking chaos and madness on Washington Street, Pilsener Haus Biergarten on Grand Street is an absolute breath of fresh air! The Eastern European atmosphere is so much fun you almost forget you're in NJ. The food is amazing and the staff is wonderful. Great place to take the family. And the pretzels are out of this world delish!
2016-04-17,4,Nice big place in hobokken itself..extensive selection of beers as well..not sure about food as didnt try it..has outdoor seating as well which is nice during summer..definitely a worth place to go on weekends with group of people..
2016-04-17,5,Huge beer hall with tasty beer and delicious eats.I came to this beer hall from NYC which is just 2 stops on the bus from PABT so getting here is relatively easy.One thing you will notice here is that there are lots of families and little babies running around which is something I would not expect.When you get to the beer hall you notice it has 3 large drinking areas. One outside which is the obvious prime spot but the tables outside can only hold around 10 people if you have more you need to go inside. Once you're inside there is a smaller room with a few large tables. If you keep walking further there is the large beer hall with the large wooden tables and benches and a bar across one of the walls. On another wall is grill cooking wursts and other delicious food.  The room has a very industrial feel to and can hold large groups. We had a group of about 20 people and all fit and watch the rangers games since they have a few tvs. At the tables there is wait service for food and drinks. I got a liter of beer from the recommendation of the server and it was perfect. In addition to the beers you gotta get a pretzel since you're at a Biergarten and it was made to perfection. A soft pretzel with a buttery glaze and the most delicious Bavarian mustard. I could not have asked for anything better.In short:-Great for groups-Friendly Fast wait service-Delicious beer and pretzels
2016-04-02,5,Love this bar! The experience here is unique and you won't find anything like it anywhere else! Great selections of beer! Pretzel is a must! Also try the grill bar with sausage and other grilled stuff! Super recommend!
2016-03-30,4,Great place and great vibe. Came with a group of friends on a regular Saturday night and the venue was crowded. We got by to grab the first few drinks which were pretty good. The beer however topped it off, nothing like a great beer selection. I never had the chance to try anything to eat only because of how crowded the place was.There is an open section in the top floor of the building where another bar is available and a few seats as well. Yes this Biergarten location is pretty big! The DJ playing made everyone head to the dance floor that night. They had a mix of everything, from house to spanish music. Amazing atmosphere and chill spot. Can't wait to be back!
2016-03-24,4,Upon entering the restaurant I found live music (Irish??), friendly staff and patrons, and an amazing selection of beer.  There are Hungarian standards on the menu despite the German spelling.  I ordered the Stiegl draft.  It had a nice hoppy note that was not overpowering and a mid-light tasting roast to the barley.  I would order it again.  For dinner I ordered the paprikas.  The chicken was fork tender as one would expect.  The sauce was a beautiful orange-red typical of a good pepper.  The flavor was good.  They might even be using imported Hungarian paprika.  The lemon zest in the sauce was a welcome surprise.   The spatzle was a bit bland, but there was plenty of sauce to fix it.Dessert was a palacsinta with hazlenut.  It met all expectations and was the perfect finish.  This place will be a regular stop for me. Parking was easy street side within one block ($1/hour).
2016-03-13,5,Love their beer and food! The portabello and Gruyere sandwich is to die for! Their fries are awesome too. The pretzel looked good, but it was too big and I'm not a huge fan of hot pretzels. Wide selection of beers, the prices could be a bit more affordable though... Seating is good, never had a problem and they have a nice outside patio. Love this place!
2016-03-11,4,Nice ambience, you sit next to other people on long tables however there is often enough space such that you don't feel crowded. They offer a large selection of great beers and some excellent food. The soft pretzel is definitely worth it. One of the only downsides is that you might have to get the attention of the waiter for your table to be noticed. This is the place to be Tuesday nights when almost everything is 50% off.
2016-03-04,5,Get the pretzel. Do it. Beer is awesome! Great prices. Awesome and fun ambiance with community tables. Definitely a place to check out. Not to mention 1/2 price Tuesdays!!!!
2016-03-01,4,I came here over the weekend with my boyfriend. It was packed but luckily we found two seats at one of the many bars. This was around 330 pm on a Saturday so not prime lunch or dinner time but still crowded! There were a lot of little kids running around which was kind of weird but I guess that's a good thing if you have a family because the atmosphere is very informal. I had a 1/2 liter of the regular beer and my boyfriend had a big IPA; I can't remember what it was called. Both beers were good. Had we not been so full from brunch, we probably would have gotten a big pretzel to share; they looked great.
2016-02-24,3,Great place to hang with friends - huge selection of beers, table menu has several authentic German dishes. The line for the grilled food is worth the wait. However, when you order the bratwurst (seems like most wurst are already being cooked to anticipate the orders) one has obviously been on the grill longer (charred and dry) while the other is newer (juicier) so technically you're paying for two, and basically eating one. Go for the weisswurst (boiled) can't go wrong with that sitting on the grill for long. Service is somewhat friendly but slow but given its a beer garden it's kinda expected.
2016-02-21,4,Tuesday is half off apps and draft beers which is great but it is always super crowded. It's almost better to go on a different day and pay a little more but you will atleast have less of a crowd and a place to sit. Other then that over all the food and beer is great. My favorite is the large pretzel :) yum
2016-02-14,4,I prefer to catch the more low key afternoons.  I don't care for the chaotic energy of the crowds.  That being said, if you can't make it to the Deutscher Club, this is the best place in New Jersey for Sauerbraten or Schnitzel Wiener.  Great beer selection as well, if you care for such things.  I do not, but most fans of authentic German food require a good selection of German, Belgian and Austrian beer.
2016-02-11,4,I hope you are ready to play a rousing game of "let's attempt to find a seat."Keep a watchful eye on any potential open seating surfaces (hint: look in the middle of benches, some people tend not to push all the way in) because if you see an opening, chances are you aren't the only person gunning for somewhere to sit.In any case, when you DO finally get a seat...drink time. The beer selection is definitely on point. The main focus is a variety of German drafts, some with long, hard to pronounce names, but all with detailed descriptions that help you make an educated choice. I'm a huge fan of any witbier, so I tend to gravitate in that direction.For food, I go to the grill 90% of the time. There are a lot of good app choices (mussels and the german pretzel are favorites) but the grill always lures me away from the menu before I can order anything - because all food is better when grilled.I tend to gravitate towards the chicken sausage, with mustard for dipping. It comes with a metric ton of fries and a giant scoop of kraut, so the meal is definitely filling. If i'm not in a sausage mood, I go for the turkey burger, which is always a solid alternative.Pretty much anything off the menu is a great choice, but i'm here for the grill and the beer.We like to try and come on Tuesdays since it's half off when you pay cash - so our dinner for two this past Tuesday was a whopping $25.The weekends, as you would expect, are their busiest times...so it may be harder to find a seat. However, if it is cold, or snowing, or really hot, or some other weather condition that would prevent you from wanting to venture out, know their "out of the way" location makes it pretty easy to find parking, either on 15th or on Clinton/Grand/Adams/Jefferson, a noteworthy distinction for a restaurant in Hoboken. To summarize: Busy, crowded, loud, hard to find seats, witbier, grill, parking, witbier, delicious.
2016-02-06,4,It is a great place for beer and food. The only thing is that there is a good possibility that that there will be a lot of kids on the weekend and it is very loud. I still will go there because it is a great place to hang out. They are expanding their beer selections and in the warmer weather there is a beer garden. There is live music on the weekend most of the time.
2016-02-02,5,having been to the real hofbrauhaus in munich- this place is awesome! i love the long traditional wooden tables and the atmosphere. it's great the servers actually come around to your table to take orders/deliver food. they have a large beer selection and the waitress was really helpful with recommendations. we had the chocolate mousse (fine, nothing crazy), the grilled calamari and sausage (wished it had more sausage, but really good flavors), and the potato pancakes (also fine, most definitely seemed like they were frozen and not house made). the best part was the hot cider with rum- don't miss out on that! will definitely return!
2016-02-01,4,Always a good time here. Beer is good, food is ok. Pretzels are great so don't leave without eating one.  Really cool feel when you enter. Only complaint is its a bit pricey. Tuesday's are half prize food/beers which is a good deal.  Gets very crowded though so would get there early.
2016-01-30,4,Great spot if you're looking to either hang out with that special someone or a group of friends. Parking is kind of scarce but you'll find a spot, eventually. As you make your way inside they'll probably be a friendly bouncer at the door enforcing dress code. I believe- you can't get in with "construction boots" (Timberlands) regardless it's a very casual environment. They have a large wrap around bar at the entrance, a fireplace and doors leading to a patio for the spring and summer months. They also have another room where they have a mini stage and a dance floor. Very casual not a lounge uptight feel. I definitely recommend going even on a slow night. It's very relaxing, games are usually playing over head the bar, you can order your drink and just hangout.
2016-01-30,3,I usually love this place, however, the bar up stairs has the worst bartenders. They either need to hire more bartenders, more experienced ones or both. It should not take 40 minutes to close out a bar tab between 4 bartenders.
2016-01-27,4,Although it is a bit far from us we have been here couple of times. I like the ambiance and food here. As far as I can remember service was decent, On one occasion there was live music which was fantastic.
2016-01-25,5,Tuesdays are great half price cash only. The pretzel is awesome along with most  everything on  the  menu. The  atmosphere is fun service has always been good no complaints whatsoever highly recommend!
2016-01-25,5,the beers makes your hand looks really small. great place. cool with kids and big boy portions.
2016-01-22,4,I love this place inside in the winter and outside in the summer. This place has an ability to somehow keep you there ordering giant beer after giant beer with more food for HOURS. Every time I leave I must immediately go home and go into a food/beer coma. You MUST get the pretzel, no actually get two and extra beer cheese. I also love the mussels, they are amazing. I'm docking a star just because even though this place is huge, it can get so packed paired with a lot of drunk people it can make it impossible to find a seat somewhere.
2016-01-19,5,Tuesdays nights are half-price for draught beers and appetizers, as well as some of the entrees (not burgers). The staff is friendly, including the bouncers, which is a rarity in Hoboken. Ask for Joanna (waitress), she'll show you the ropes, and Paul the bouncer is funny and friendly. Overall, it's a great time on Tuesdays.
2016-01-17,4,I would say this is a great place to come have good food good drink. Is seems a lot of people in Hoboken bring their children here. They have a big screen TVs for football live music. I like this place very nice very different put it on your list of things to do
2016-01-16,5,I come here with my boyfriend all of the time, and  and we are both huge fans. Service is always great, the beer selection is phenomenal, and the pretzels are to die for. Definitely the type of place  we like to go to for a quiet(er) night out Also - live music on the weekends is an added bonus
2016-01-14,5,The best pure Biergarten on the east coast.  This place is very classy and well conceived, yet still fun and can get rowdy when there is futbol on.       A few years ago we came in and got seats to watch the Rangers vs Devils NHL playoff game, and during the 2nd period, they switched the channel to some euro soccer game!  This is the only bar around here that would do that on their only tv in the building.  Everyone in the building wanted to watch soccer it was crazy!  (Because its located on the border of NY and NJ...)  The manager comped our entire bill, which was almost $200, because their website stated that the hockey would be on the big screen.      Needless to say, this place is a very authentic german biergarten which caters hugely to a european crowd.  Awesome german beer selection served in any size stein you can handle.  Great food too.
2016-01-11,4,The Biergarten is absolutely one of my favorite places in Hoboken.  Although it's a little out of the way, the atmosphere and vibe are excellent.  I've enjoyed many good afternoons and evenings both inside and outside here, and I've never had a bad experience.  The beers are delicious, the pretzels are tasty, and the lively but chill crowds make for an enjoyable restaurant.
2016-01-07,5,Great bar, awesome pretzels, tasty ciders, and throwback 90s jams were playing when we went. Will be a regular when I come to Hoboken!
2016-01-06,5,What's not to love - authentic German beer and sausages! Being a beer lover, this place is heaven. I like Pilsner better than the other beer garden in JC only because there's music and just looks nicer overall!!! There's a patio in front for summer time and now they open the upstairs so if you wanna have a bday, you can! There's a DJ and everything! Just a tip though, the upstair bar doesn't sell all the beer on tap .. Mostly more mixed drinks so you'll need to get your tap beer downstairs. Bartenders are great - one guy made up a concoction for us one time and it taste amazing! Overall, great place to host casual birthdays & great for weekend get-togethers. Gets crowded but that's everywhere nowadays. Price is great for what you're getting -$7 for half and I believe $14 for full?
2016-01-02,4,It's a beer garden (choose your correct way of spelling) so from that aspect sure it's good. Beer is good and grilled food is good.  Tuesday nights half off food was great but they never have the rotisserie chicken and now burgers aren't half off. Lame, but it's so crowded no one goes anymore. Nick holes wants me to rate this place 1 star since there's so many strollers and kids even on a Saturday night but that just wouldn't be fair. Maybe 3 stars. Also, is this woman next to us serious? 5-0, 90lbs with d's....sure they're as real as Santa lady we believe you. It can get pricey and they changed fries (thin frozen fries now when they used to serve  tasty fat fries seriously don't get cheap now that you're popular). Oh yeah just found out chocolate sauce can be served with pretzels.  Grant got vodka at a beer garden. This music is weird tonight.
2016-01-02,5,Great food (especially the Sauerbraten), the beer is served through clean lines and served well. Beautiful environment, good prices, great everything. I usually go in off hours when it's fairly quiet and it's my favorite time to go. It gets a little more crowded and loud on weekend nights.
2015-12-31,3,I have been to this place before and the food is great, but I was upset about New Years. We called to make reservations a few weeks prior and was told that we didn't have enough people, but we could come an hour later and be a walk in. We then called again today at 930pm asking if we could still walk in at 1030pm and they said we could. So we walked there and got there right and 1030 and were told they are only excepting reservations. I understand New Years is crazy busy, but if you will only except reservations then you should allow all group numbers to make one and if we called please tell us the truth with what is happening.
2015-12-30,1,Walked in at 11pm on a Monday night and was informed that they had already done last call.  We stated that their website and Yelp both said they close at 2am but the bartender said they close whenever they want based on how many people are there.  There were 7 other tables in the bar, and another group of people walked in 10 minutes after us.  Everyone there was very rude, including the bartender who was less than helpful when we asked for beer suggestions before being rushed out of the bar. They clearly don't like money considering there were plenty of people there and they were forcing everyone out before their apparent closing time.
2015-12-30,4,This place is the bomb!!  The only reason for the one star deduction is that there is open seating and when we arrived there was nowhere to sit with no empty table in sight.  Tables are biergarten style (long tables and benches) so be prepared to get cosy with your table-mates.  We eventually had some seating karma when 2 people left the bar as we were loitering and offered us their seats.  Thank you to you lovely peeps, as we were about to leave.  Had we left we would have been sorry (we may not have known how sorry, but oh yes, we would have been sorry).  The barman who helped us during the evening was knowledgeable, chatty and friendly.  Those guys keep that place going, no doubt about it.  They never slowed down for a minute.When we walked in we had no idea that the reason the place was heaving on a Tuesday night was because, if you paid in cash, most things were half price. Mein Gott!  If the place had been open when I lived up the road 10 years ago you'd always know where I was on a Tuesday night!I should probably be waxing lyrical about the range of European beers on offer, but since I don't drink beer, I'll leave that to some other aficionado.  For non-beer drinkers there is a full bar and Strongbow Cider.The food is stellar.  We had the goulash and sauerbraten which were so yummy that I was at the plate-licking stage when they finally wrestled the plate out of my hands.They have a pretty big outdoor area for when the weather cooperates.Wish we were on the right coast more often!
2015-12-29,5,What can I say? I love this place- was only here twice before once for my birthday last August. Great atmosphere, food, beer and service. Also, has a patio area in the front which is great on nice days. Brats are great as the pretzels too. Can't wait to go back- I should plans spring outing now.
2015-12-27,5,Great beer garden! They had a good selection of local drafts as well as imports. Hungry? They do have a menu and then after 11pm, a more limited selection of grill items (still very good). They also have a DJ on the weekends. I would say this is a great place to meet people and you will definitely not have typical Hoboken douche crowd (basically that means the same Jersey shore crowd).
2015-12-14,3,I'll be honest - beer halls aren't really my thing. But Pilsener seems to be the go-to place for my friends to host birthday and farewell dinners, and so I've been here on more than one occasion. If you like noisy, lively places and don't mind scrambling for seats, you'll probably have a good time at Pilsener. Wide selection of beer, a combination of get-it-yourself and order-from-the-kitchen dishes, and some decent desserts. Pilsener also has two party rooms (one on ground level, another called the "Speakeasy" on another level) that can be rented as well.For someone with low tolerance for chaos (such as myself), you may find the experience of trying to find a place to sit and order food to be overwhelming. The service was lackluster as it seemed they did not have enough wait staff to adequately cover each area. I saw my table's waitress once and never again. I wanted to order the huge pretzel, but after waiting an hour for someone - anyone - from the wait staff to return, decided that I didn't want it after all. It seems I needed to be way more aggressive in order to order anything from the kitchen menu. Parking unsurprisingly is a PITA during prime dinner and drinking hours even though Pilsener is in the middle of no-man's land between Hoboken and Weehawken. Probably the main reason that I dread going to Pilsener at 9 pm on the weekend.If you're a fan of German pubs, yeah, you'll love this place. I don't mind going here but for my introverted self it's not my first choice by far.For those on a mobile device, note that the check-in offer is only valid during a very specific time range on weekdays - the fine print doesn't show up until after you've checked in and pulled up the offer.
2015-12-12,4,Everybody loves a biergarten.A cavernous dining hall with shared seating on a long table. The beer is fantastic. According to my buddy, the german dishes are fantastic.  They have this large open fire grill where you can see the brats and other grilled meats cooked in front of you. The grill takes cash only, which was kinda strange. The brats we had with sauerkraut was meaty goodness. Portions are LARGE, so share the brats and get something else.Parking on the streets outside is a plenty.  Stay safe, no drink and drive.
2015-12-03,5,Located in an area easier to park I decided to go out Octoberfest style...The people here made this fun.Josh and Andrew were great!Stein holding ... And the pretzel!Definitely should try this one if you haven't!
2015-11-24,4,Great!  Fun atmosphere with lots of tables busy for Sunday Funday.  The food all looked so good and I want to try everything !  The only food I did try was the pretzel and boy was it HUGE and delicious!  I look forward to going back.  The service was good too!
