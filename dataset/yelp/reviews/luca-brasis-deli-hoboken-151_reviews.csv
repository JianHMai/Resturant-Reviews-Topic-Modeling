2021-11-09,1,An embarrassment to the Hoboken deli scene! Place was great 7-8 years ago but is terribly inconsistent now.  Just charged me $15 for chicken salad on a kaiser and a bag of chips . . . . almost twice what it would cost you at any other spot in town or NYC.  Go to Fiore's or Vito's if you're uptown.  This place sucks now!P.S. the roll was stale and the chicken salad bland.
2021-10-09,4,Solid neighborhood deli. Ordered large takeout order and was ready when promised. Chefs salad was nice portion with generous helping of meats and cheeses. Lettuce fresh and crispy. Only disappointment was they failed to give me the dressing I ordered ( they gave me no dressing at all). The sandwiches look amazing. Judging from those in our order who got them, you'll eat the whole thing but need More than a few napkins!  :-).
2021-08-15,1,Ordered from this place in the past and it wasn't too bad. It's been a while since, so I decided to get a chicken parm hero and couldn't believe how bad it was. Apparently they don't use the same thick Italian hero bread anymore because the bread I got on my hero was worse than Blimpies. I don't know if it's new ownership or what but the sauce was non-existent, and I probably had half a slice of chicken cutlet in there. I won't be eating from here anymore that's for sure.
2021-06-29,4,Great egg sandwiches it was a pleasure to eat there. Get to watch a little soccer while you eat breakfast and drink a cuppa coffee nice outdoor seating to didn't try and sandwiches and then breakfast ones. But man it was good
2021-03-29,3,Luca Brassi is one of Hoboken's staple Italian delis. I  typically keep it simple and order a sub with cracked pepper turkey, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The sandwiches are big enough to share with if you have chips or something else on the side... or eat all by yourself - no judgement!I'm giving them 3 stars because they always overcharge from what's posted on the menu; it happens pretty much every time I go there. They tend to add $0.50 - $1.00 on top of the menu prices so it's not noticeable if you're not paying attention - but it feels deliberate which is annoying.All that being said, I  continue getting sandwiches here because it's convenient and their mozz IS delicious!
2021-02-16,4,Was craving an Italian deli sandwich Sunday night and unfortunately the Italian delis by me in uptown Hoboken close early afternoon. Luckily Luca Brasi's is open until 9 pm. I ordered the fugedda Boutit sub for pick up. The sandwich was huge and stuffed with meat. I added my own balsamic for a little bit more flavor. Delicious and I would try more sandwiches from here!
2021-01-24,4,So this morning's weekly Sunday breakfast out takes me back to Hoboken.  I had to try somewhere new and fate landed me here. The appearance is great.  Parking is rough but where in Hoboken isn't parking rough?  I ordered online (5 sandwiches and home fries) and everything was ready when we got there.  Keep in mind we're a solid 15 minutes away.  I know,  I'd hope it would be ready in 15 minutes but with some places I've been too...... you'd be surprised. I got the Egg whites,  fresh mozzarella and broccoli rabe and my youngest got his traditional sausage,  egg and cheese.   When I unwrapped mine I was very nervous.  It looked very blaseÃÅ.  I was wrong,  the salt from the fresh mozzarella and the broccoli rabe really carried this sandwich.  Worked well together.   My son was also very happy with his sandwich.  The inside and very clean and the staff was very helpful.  That's always a plus.  With that said,  I do believe I'll be back for lunch sometime.....
2021-01-11,1,Order their signature sandwich it was strictly tuna with Mozzarella totally bone dry and totally disgusting it was like eating a tree branch Worst Italian deli in Hoboken
2020-08-18,4,Sandwiches are good as well as the cannolis. Prices aren't too bad either and they are quick
2020-08-03,2,Just visited this evening and even though they have signs saying masks are mandatory their own employees lacked masks.  Of the three employees working, one had no mask, one had a mask but had it down on his chin and one employee (the owner?) had a full mask.   In the current environment with the pandemic, practice what you preach.  If you have a sign mandating masks then you should mandate it of your own staff.
2020-08-03,4,Chose to get a Taylor ham egg and cheese sandwich from here and it was great! Really big sandwich so it was enough to hold me over until dinner time. Would definitely go back and try any of their other sandwiches too!
2020-06-23,1,Food is not very flavorful- actually has no flavor. We ordered a cheesesteak hot sub and it was the blandest thing ever. Had no salt and no seasoning in the meat. The pepper and onions also tasted bad and had zero flavors. Also ordered cheese fries- it came with saggy, salt less and flavorless fries with maybe one American cheese just melted on top of it for the sake of naming it "cheese fries".
2020-06-07,2,Worst sandwich in my life. They use cheapest ingredients. Worst tasteless deli meat with canned artichokes and canned sliced black olives.
2020-05-17,3,Ordered fresh mozz, prosciutto with roasted peppers. Barely any mozz, Luca add a buck to the cost and put the proper amount of mozz. I'm done here.
2020-05-08,5,Hands down my favorite deli in Hoboken. Highly recommend the cheesesteak and Buffalo chicken sandwich. Also their pasta fagioli is literally one of the best soups I've ever had. Highly recommend.
2020-03-13,5,Luca Brasi's over everything! Love being able walk past them on my commute home from NY and pick up a warm meal to enjoy. 5 stars.
2020-01-12,4,Competition is tough for Hoboken Italian delis, but this deli is iconic. Fresh and homemade mutz, huge Italian deli sandwiches, plenty of hot entrees and more. It taste great to go, but there's something about sitting inside that makes it even better. Lunch time is pretty busy, but they do keep it moving. One downside is that they charge a 3.9% fee when using a credit card. So being cash!
2020-01-10,3,EhWe wanted to love this place but It's just...ehFun menu but the roast beef and fresh mozzarella was bland and the sausage pepper and onion was not that goodSoup-beef barleyThe meat was disgustingLooked like clumps of day with a valve and tumor coming out of it!Honestly!Staff is very kindBetter places in town for real Italian
2019-12-13,4,First off, this place has the best corn muffin in hoboken. Not sure if they make them on the premises but whoever makes them should be saluted. I also tried the chicken noodle soup. This recipe needs some tweaking but it did the job. I also ordered a sandwich since you cant order from here without getting a sandwich.  My one critique would be that the crust on the bread for the sandwich is a little too hard for my liking. It holds the sandwich well but you gotta sharpen those molars if you want to get through it. Overall I like it here and would order again. Just would need to sharpen my molars before I do.
2019-11-11,1,Came here to this Hoboken delicatessens to try their sandwiches. I ordered the turkey sandwich with mozzarella cheese and red roasted peppers. I asked the gentleman that took my order to please put oil and vinegar and salt and pepper on my sandwich which basically is what they normally put at a deli on sandwiches. When I got my sandwich it did not have any oil or vinegar. The bread on top of the sandwich was drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Sandwich was not prepared correctly and basically had no flavor. Dry turkey that got stuck in my throat and dry mozzarella to go with it. very disappointed as I was looking forward to having a good sandwich. I will not be coming back.
2019-10-26,4,Great, huge overstuffed deli sandwiches. Great quality. One huge sub can be a single meal or four meals depending on how hungry you are, so you're likely going to have leftovers for later! I go 4 stars bc I sometimes have issues with order accuracy, but all around a great spot that I order from frequently.
2019-10-26,3,I've been a customer at Luca brasi for some time. Today I went to get a chicken cutlet sandwich with bacon on a wrap. I waited for 20 minutes as they served customers who ordered well after me. When they finally called my sandwich, they charged me SIXTEEN DOLLARS for a chicken cutlet sandwich on a WRAP! Their ordering system is outdated and they clearly messed up my order and charged me what seems like double. No receipt was provided. Absolutely unbelievable. I do not recommend this place. Please go to any other deli in Hoboken as Luca Brasi is a rip off.Update: I called and explained there must be a mistake. They agreed and said they would correct the price if I could come back to pick up my $2 refund. They were understanding so the management is nice and they are good people.  I have changed my rating from 1 star to 3 stars. however I still feel ripped off based on the price and wait time. The sandwich is good but not worth the hefty price. I recommend Fiores Deli if your looking for a truly unforgettable sandwich.
2019-10-24,2,I have tried really hard with this place to like it, I have been here over the 15 years I have lived in Hoboken but alas it is not to be, they have mostly failed on being rude and ignorant, however they sandwiches aren't great, ask for salt and pepper and you don't get it etc, I head over to Lusardi bro's these days and can highly recommend them
2019-10-24,5,This place has it all! Good food, good people, and a cozy little dining area.My wife loves the Reuben and she usually picks up an "everything including the kitchen sink" sandwich for me.  Sorry, don't know what the name is but it's awesome!  (Pic included).I usually stop by every couple of weeks to pick up a pound each of:  egg salad, chicken salad, and tortellini salad.  I make a 2 parts chicken salad, 1 part egg salad, sprinkle of chili powder, on white toast sandwich with the tortellini on the side.  Best...lunch...ever!My wife and I absolutely love this place and even coming here a few times a week it has not gotten old.I can't recommend this place highly enough!
2019-08-27,1,I ordered a capicola with mozzarella and arugula sandwich. They charged me $9.99 for the sandwich plus $1 for the arugula even though the menu states it's $9. They also charged me $3 for a Snapple (see pics). WTF?! Sandwich was ok, nothing to rave about. Do yourself a favor, take a few minutes and head up to Fiores or Biancamano for better value.
2019-07-20,1,"Please add onion,lettuce, o+v" "no problem " resumes talking about bets on baseball, seemed very distracted. Charged me extra for the toppings  I requested . Gave me a severely lame ass 12 dollar sandwich
2019-07-03,2,Ordered two Fuggedaboutit sandwiches and neither had the roasted peppers or any of the extras I asked for. Also, delivered late.
2019-06-19,5,The best fresh moz I've ever had.  Add it to the roast beef & moz sandwich with brown gravy and prepared to be wowed.  The owner is friendly and everything in the deli looks incredible.  I live in Atlanta, but visit here every time I'm visiting my brother in Hoboken. I even take fresh moz home with me and they're kind enough to pack it up so I can take it on the plane with me!
2019-06-15,3,Decent sandwiches, but any place that charges $90 for a tray of penne vodka is a little out of their mind.
2019-05-11,4,An old favorite of ours that got lost in the Italian deli shuffle of Hoboken living for us. While going for a early afternoon stroll we were  reminded by the alluring smell why we love it so much. They have a ton of options for breakfast, subs of all kinds, hot food for platters, etc. We're big fans of a good chicken cutlet with some fresh mutz, red peppers, arugula and some balsamic for the win and Luca Brasi has exactly that. The bread with crispy and absolute perfection and worth every cent, $10 for a massive sub. Great for sharing! On a nice day they have a cute little outdoor seating area or take it to go, delicious either way!
2019-04-25,1,I am so disappointed in the customer service.  My husband and I are long time residents of Hoboken, and order regularly and catering from here.  Two days ago I ordered a catering order for my employees, as I work in town.  I asked for a 1-130pm delivery. I called shortly after 130pm to follow up and was told it was out for delivery.  I then called a little later and was told it wasn't out for delivery as they hadn't even done the order for the day.  I said we still needed it, as my employees hadn't eaten lunch, and they said they would get it together and have it over in 15 minutes. 215pm came and went, I called again, and they said they called me but I didn't answer, which was not true and I had someone waiting out front for the delivery.  Finally, shortly after 3pm, we got the food.  I called later and said I was disappointed and they said so you got the food and it was fine?  I asked to speak with the manager who then told me to speak with the owner, I have called a few times, even left a message for him to return my call and have not been called back. To say I am disappointed is an understatement, we will never support this business again.
2019-04-16,1,I love this place but they have been slacking cold cuts are thick and they give you any bread they can get there hands on ask the guy for mayo like i usually do didnt provide it  plus there was a lo g hair thru out the sandwich and the mozz was invisible ill stop going there and go to fiores im alergic to wheat and they use wheat bread instead of the normal white one whole thing in the garbage
2019-03-31,5,This place is SO good. It has become my go to. You will not be disappointed. The place has massive subs and the portions are huge.
2019-03-23,1,Wow what a disappointment...I had a chicken cutlet sandwich and the chicken was awful...first of all the chicken tasted like it was cooked the day before sat in fridge overnight and then microwaved. Threw out the whole sandwich
2019-03-20,5,Me and my family know the deli owners and decided to try out the food as we'd never been there and I have to say everyone said that it was the best they'd ever had. Absolutely amazing food I went back today and got some more!
2019-03-16,1,The service here is terrible called in a order for pick up and they never made it. When I arrived there for pick up they "said they were working on it" and made we wait almost 20 minutes after i had called in a half hour before. Then finally they asked me what I was waiting for after 20 minutes and the order was never being made. Sand which was ok nothing to rave about but with that service will never be going back
2019-02-13,5,So this place is so legit. I love their sandwiches, and their homemade mozzarella cheese is amazing. The big Petey- turkey (yummy kind), mozzarella, little bit of arugula, and sundrieds is AMAZING. So filling, fresh, and delish. Really nice guys working here too.
2019-02-02,5,This place is awesome! Quiet honestly one of the best subs I've ever had.   Located on an over crowded Hoboken back street with bad parking..  We went on feb 1st during a polar vortex, the place is freezing inside so eating in requires a heavy jacket and a hearty spirit.  All the staff where wearing hats and coats.  The place is all business, get in and get out, you aren't here for the ambiance.   Ok now for the food..  We ordered the soprano (hold roasted pepper) and 2 forget-a-bout-it (swap mozzarella for sharp provolone).   The sandwiches were great the cheese was awesome, the soprasado was really good, very high quality meats and a great bread that was hard crusted and chewy.    We also got a few pickles and they were exactly what you'd expect from a great deli pickle..   I'm going back on my next trip to Hoboken!
2019-01-27,4,Sandwhiches are decently sized and flavorful. Nice deli atmosphere. Would definitely come back to try some other selections.
2018-12-24,1,Ordered delivery. Waited an hour and a half after calling them many times and no answer. No food delivery either. Will never order from them again.
2018-12-20,2,This place use to be one of the top places in hoboken for sure.  The quality of bread is now weak at best and the amount of motz cheese is just weak.You should just goto vitos and walk the few extra blocks
2018-12-16,3,I feel like it's just those iconic places whose quality has fallen down over the years but it's in a good spot, so it makes good money. I wish I had much more to say but I don't. I ordered the pasta with garlic and oil sauce and it wasn't that great. Same with the potato salad. Maybe it was just that one day but I didn't like the food. The place looked busy with people though.
2018-12-02,1,"The worst sandwich I've ever had in Hoboken" We patiently awaited our sandwiches for an hour, only to be extremely disappointed. The sandwiches had nothing we had ordered instead just burnt cheese and dry chicken. When we called to let them know this was not what we ordered, they were rude and unapologetic. Claiming that "when you order from Luca Brasi "you pay for your extra cheese", which we did pay a $1 for a whole slice of burnt American cheese.
2018-11-12,3,Not a bad deli. Certainly not anywhere near the best deli in hoboken. Worst meatballs I ever had in my life. Gravy (Sauce) on the meatballs was like dark water. Resembled fluid that comes out during a colonoscopy prep. Stick to hot and cold sandwiches. Stay away from the meatballs for sure
2018-11-08,5,Very good deli- I've ordered from here a few times and the food has always been good. They even ran out of the item I ordered once and called to apologize and were very accommodating with switching my order.
2018-10-28,5,This is the best deli in Hoboken- was go to for the entire time that I lived in there and stop by when in town on business.The sandwiches are typically loaded with high quality meat, cheese and veggies.They also have pre-made Italian dishes to go (including apps, entrees etc).I now reside here in Chicago and there's nothing close to what this gem offers its loyal customers.
2018-10-26,4,Just consumed another good sandwich from Luca Brasi's.  This is a very good option if you are in Hoboken and looking for a solid neighborhood deli.  The store has lots of fun mafia memorabilia (no surprise there given the name), and reviewing the many photos is a good way to pass the time while you wait for your meal to be prepared.The people behind the counter are nice and always welcome me with a warm smile.Most recently, I ordered a turkey and bacon sandwich and had no complaints.One thing to keep in mind - if you like to call ahead, at times you will get an error message when dialing their number.  I think perhaps they do not have call waiting?  Not sure what the problem is but when it happens, I am usually able to get through on the second or third try.
2018-10-13,1,Beyond rude OWNER!  Went in to pick up soups for a friend. This nasty guy was screaming at the staff and counter help.....turns out he was the owner!!  When it was my turn to order I asked the counter guy  if I could taste the two soups to see which was best, when  the same disheveled owner comes flying over and tells me we don't give free samples here!!! You would think I was asking for a free filet mignon!  The embarrassed counter guy profusely apologized and said he's like this to everyone, smh.  Next time, I'm going to Vito's, where you get treated like a customer.
2018-10-04,1,If I could give them 0 stars I would. Don't order here I paid my money and ordered via yelp and the guy claimed they didn't deliver because they didn't have a car. Never got my food or money. I will be escalating this further
2018-07-22,5,Got the Johnny sandwich.  Solo good.  Amazing roast beef and mozzarella.  Luca is a Hoboken institution.  There is no other place to go for a great sandwich.
2018-07-20,5,I have an Italian wife, that means certain things must be in order and hopefully nearby. A good --- if not great --- Italian deli and this one fits the bill. We were originally moving to Rutherford and found a fantastic Italian deli there, Materas on Park. So finding a great Italian deli in Hoboken a few blocks from my wife's office was fantastic!This place is also not as expensive as the Materas, not for any lack or change in quality.Happy Wife, Happy Life...
2018-07-14,5,i came here for the sweet marie sandwich! i had it a few years ago and i wanted to leave a better review. i actually ate in the place this time. very good! probably the only sandwich i would get because i love everything on it. they have other stuff i wanna try too. my dad got the penne vodka and i had some of that and it was very good! small place but they have some seats. love the photos on the wall too. one of my favorite deli's in hoboken :)
2018-05-24,5,These sandwiches are amazing!!!! Freshly sliced meats, delicious fresh cheeses on perfect bread!!! Mmmmm cant get enough. The service is really fast and friendly. Im so happy this deli is walking distance from home. Definitely try it out if you are craving some delicious eats.
2018-05-16,4,LOVE  the tuna hoagie here...  the service can sometimes be a bit up in the air, i feel there should be one employee staying at the register and greeting people and taking orders-  but i do love the food.
2018-04-29,2,I like this local deli but had to comment specifically on the garlic bread. It was literally a big roll with one half having nothing on it and the other half having a little garlic and butter wiped on it. Zero effort. I will come back but never for the garlic bread again
2018-04-06,5,Luca Brasi's is a classic Italian corner deli. The food is very good and there is always a large selection. Open early for breakfast and through dinner too. They have the option of indoor and ourdoor seating and easy take out food. I would definitely recommend any of the subs on the menu.
2018-03-04,5,Mutz is great, ordered eggplant parm sandwich for delivery, was at my door in 15 mins
2018-02-16,5,There is no better deli in all of Hoboken. Granted, it's down the street from me. But that doesn't contribute to my bias. The bread is extremely fresh and variety of eats are endless. I generally get the big Petey sandwich (and Mac salad if I'm feeling fancy!) They've for great breakfast options as well. One of the longest standing authentic Hoboken spots in town!
2018-01-06,1,If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. My friend and I came here in high hopes for delicious subs and fries. Firstly, we had to repeat our order multiple times, and even then, they still messed up both of our subs. Not only that, but despite asking for warm sandwiches, the bread was cold and extremely hard. My sandwich was made incorrectly with meat, and after asking for it to be remade without meat since I am a vegetarian, it was extremely sloppy. My friend's sandwhich was missing an entire ingredient which she clearly stated while ordering. Fries were cold. The price at this place was definitely not worth the food, and we will never be coming back here again. Horrible food, terrible service.
2017-12-31,1,For the dogs! This was supposed to be Taylor ham, egg,and cheese with extra Taylor ham!  This is a bread on bread sandwich!
2017-12-15,2,The people who work here do not wear gloves. The food is decent but after realizing the guys making my sandwich were not wearing gloves and touching every piece of meat, I don't think I'll be able to come back.
2017-12-06,1,This place went down hill. Breakfast sandwiches are like paper thin meat between 2 slices of bread. McDonald's gives better portion for the money. Don't waste your time or money. High price low quantity.
2017-11-20,5,Great, fresh and tasty food combined with a good service.
2017-11-17,4,Decent deli spot on 1st. I came here in the early afternoon and ordered 2 pork roll and egg sandwiches. The girl working at the counter was nice, took down the order and was friendly during the whole experience. I ended up ordering a bagel as well and all they had left was poppy. Which I took because I love bagels. The pork roll sandwiches were good, I wish it had more meat, but what can you do. Next time I'll probably order double meat or something. The bagel was ok, I don't know if they're made in house but my bagel was uneven. So parts of it weren't toasted at all and other parts were delicious. I'll be back, the people at the shop were nice.
2017-08-21,4,Sandwiches are AWESOME and the Mozz is killer!  Delivery can be hit or miss but I've always had great service when I stopped in after work
2017-08-12,5,Everything from their egg sandwiches to hot and cold sandwiches are amazing. Their bread is from Rockland Bakery which is awesome and their fresh mozzarella and cold cuts are on point. They have a variety of Godfather-themed hot sandwiches that are yummy too. If you're looking for a BEC on a roll, this is also your spot. Find them on seamless and delivery.com.
2017-07-28,3,So first, I LOVE their roast beef sandwich. It's so good. But unfortunately, that's where my love ends with Luca Brasi's. I've tried a bunch of their other sandwiches and appetizers and none of them were that good. Also, they're pretty pricey and cheap on the mozzarella. I'd come here more if the other menu options improved.
2017-07-16,3,Sandwich was excellent but only gave three stars because for the second time the bread is pretty tough. A shame, because it's almost perfect.
2017-06-11,4,They treat you like family when you are there. Pricey sandwich but really enjoyable. Cannot go wrong with chicken cutlet or grilled chicken sammy!
2017-05-15,4,Good corn muffins, pastrami & cheese sandwich.... fresh bread, yummy mozzarella - unpretentious, friendly service, welcoming place...
2017-04-23,1,There service sucks! I called after an  hour for the the order that I placed  and they lied saying that my card was declined. If that were the case they could of called right but no then they tried saying that they put in the wrong credit card number. Once I blew up on them they got here in 5 minutes. Fran's Italian deli is the go to place never again.
2017-04-18,5,Best sandwiches EVER!!!!! The quality of ingredients is fantastic and the service is great!!!!! I cannot say enough good things about this place! I got the cheesesteak thinking it would be ordinary, instead it was actual sliced steak (not deli meat). I also got the hot roast beef and mozzarella with gravy, they put fresh mozzarella in the sandwich. Soooo delish!! Check this place out, it's soooo worth it!!!!!
2017-03-23,5,This place was outstanding! The chicken Parmesan sub was fabulous ! Thanks guys !! Fresh bread ! Great salads ! Cool place !
2017-02-14,1,It's been years since I have been back here so I decided to give this place another try because I live so close and it looks like they have new people working here.  Unfortunately, it's still the same complete incompetence and ridiculously high prices.  I ordered a very simple sandwich - Turkey and cheese and unbelievably they got it wrong!  On top of that, even if it were the right order there was very little meat on the sandwich so it would still be a complete rip off.  Never going back.  No more chances.
2017-02-10,4,I use to LOVE Luca brasi's but now I'd say they are pretty good. Their food is consistent, which I love because I know what I am getting but I feel like some of the basic stuff could use an upgrade, like the lettuce on sandwiches; I know it's a little thing but shredded iceberg is "meh" at best on a sandwich. Spreads/dressings are a bit limited too. Their sides haven't changed in the near decade I have lived in Hoboken, which I appreciate because they are good, they are your typical Italian sides. I really love the sweet Marie sandwich, it's amazing. I'd say for basic sandwiches, like a turkey sandwich I  have some other places I like, but for basic Italian sandwiches Luca brasis is good. One thing I would give them five stars on is their catering. They do an amazing job. Their catering is pretty seamless and painless, they arrive on time and all the food is fresh and relatively affordable when you have to feed a party.
2017-01-16,5,We used Luca Brasi to make sandwiches/salads for our impromptu New Year's Eve party this year. Everything was so great. I believe we had several sandwiches from the "meet the family" menu. These were a big hit. Everyone loved them and even went home because the sandwiches were so large. We will definitely use them again! PS the mushroom salad is amazing.
2017-01-16,4,There are a ton of great delis in Hoboken, but for some reason Luca Brasis is my favorite. Their staff is friendly and the food is always on point. The mozz is sooooo good! And they've never messed up on my order. I recommend ordering ahead since everything is fresh and can take awhile. My personal favorites are the roast beef and the chicken cutlet sandwiches. My only complaint is they can run out of whole wheat heros often.
2017-01-01,3,Ok deli pretty good sandwich nice size but expensive! I've had better mozzarella! Also the one thing I hate when the non Italians that work here talk about you in Spanish that really makes me not come back to your establishment!
2016-12-01,5,I really don't know why this place has been getting negative reviews recently! Luca Brasi's is consistently great! I always order the chef salad (I am gluten free) and the salad is delicious, fresh, and is big enough to provide 2 meals for me. Their fresh mozzarella is also amazing. My fianceÃÅ is obsessed with their sandwiches (he loves the big paulie). Also, you can place orders online which is a plus for me, and they have quick and friendly service.
2016-11-02,2,I'm sad to say,  very meh. I ordered the chicken parm and the ratio was off. There was far too much bread, which made it difficult to even eat more than a half without feeling like you've got a buffalo sitting on your chest. My brother-in-law also ordered the same, and for a big eater, he could barely finish it as well. Also, it was not seasoned, needed at least a pinch of salt. I have heard they do cold subs much better.
2016-11-01,5,Just wow. The taylor ham, egg and cheese was JUST what I needed on a Saturday AM after a long night out. I also just love how customizable Luca's menu is - you can add one of 10 toppings onto your egg sandwich, amazing. Def my fave deli in Hoboken!
2016-08-31,2,With all the powerhouse delis in the area, not sure how this place is clinging on.  Went with 3 friends and no one was happy.  And I'm friends with a bunch of pigs so I don't expect all around boo's.  Chicken cutlets were dry/not fresh and each sandwich was missing something I.e. Prosciutto on one, o&v in the next, etc. my unsolicited advice to management would be to start focusing on the quality of the food and staffs attention to detail.
2016-08-23,2,This place was very good for a long time, but comical price increases, accompanied with terrible customer service, and a drop in quality has also been going on for awhile. I'd say the last 10 times I've gone there I left saying "never again". $1.50 for a 12oz can of soda, $3.00 for a 16oz Snapple.. Those are 100% higher then everybody else on earth. The sandwich prices are never the same, I order the same sandwich every time I go, and it's a complete mystery as to what I'm going to pay. Service used to be ok, now it's inattentive at times and just rude other times. You don't get a hello, whenever the kid who can barely speak English decides to glance up at you, with an annoyed face, that's your cue to order. Then you get your mystery price gauge of the day and he throws your change on the counter without a thank you. Also the bread now sucks, the bakery they got bread from closed down, and they have some small, stale rolls.Bottom line is they got comfortable, they've done very well for a long time and just assume they will continue to. But I can say with certainty they've definitely lost me, and I've been going there forever.. Too many other good choices around town to deal with average food, terrible service, and the insane price increases.. Greed is going to put them out of business if the staff doesn't.
2016-08-21,5,One of the best BLTs i have ever eaten. Bacon was amazingly fresh and well cooked! When eating the sandwhich the combination of juices and flavor are exceptionally well crafted. Hard to stuff up but also very hard to make it the best!!
2016-07-29,1,Sad that a place that was such a staple of Hoboken has gone down hill so quickly. The current staff ranges from inattentive to hostile and rude to customers. There are days/weeks where price gouging ($16 for a salad, $25 per pound for chicken cutlets) are the norm. Truth is Lucas is no longer worth the wait. Frankie and Ava's has higher quality food and Vito's is light years better options and service.
2016-07-20,2,First of all let me begin with the fact that I got the delivery with no utensils and napkins inside, very disappointed. Second I got my mozzarella sticks with NO MARINARA sauce and they were  dry. Lastly my salad came drenched with dressing It was more like a soup of caesar dressing. 23 dollars for such a terrible meal.
2016-07-01,1,Ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sub and #7. Big Petey Sandwich. Took about 45min to get to me, I guess that's average time. When I got the order, it was the #7 and buffalo wings instead of my Buffalo Chicken Sub. Called up the restaurant, spoke to a guy that didn't speak english very well and I'm not even sure he understood what I was saying and said "ok 20 min". No apology, nothing. Delivery guy shows up 40min later and asks for the wings back. So after they messed up my order and my friend had nothing to eat, they ask for the wings back when they deliver the correct sub. Are they going to save the food and give it to someone else?!?!? Anyhow, both subs were mediocre at best. I've had subs so much better. Will not be ordering from them again. Terrible customer service and food was overpriced for below average.
2016-05-28,2,Did you hear about that new Mexican / Italian place that opened in Hoboken?  It's called Nacho Mama's.
2016-05-14,1,The absolutely most dusgusting sandwiches I have ever had in my life...literally..my whole life..worst meal. The eggplant is thin and dry, the chicken was even worse. I felt like I was eating thin slices of sheetrock with tomato sauce.  The side of meatballs, wow gross....dry, fell apart and full..I mean full of garlic!!! Never again, this place is nasty.
2016-05-14,4,I'm sure you've had at least one sandwich in your life where you look at it and say "How am I supposed to eat this? It's too big". Well, that is exactly what will happen if you order from this place.The mozzarella in Hoboken is great in general, but the slices on this sandwich were stellar. Matched with prosciutto, basil, and sundried tomatoes on a hearty roll. My only complaint was that the sundried tomatoes were too tough to bite in half. It was either the whole thing or nothing. But that's me being picky, it was a great hoagie.  (Sorry, NY/North Jersey people. I know you don't call them hoagies, you say subs or whatever. I mean no disrespect, it's just how we call this form of sandwich. I hope there's no hard feelings, you got yourselves a winner here.)
2016-04-01,5,Go to, classic Italian deli.  My parents are off the boat paison and this place feels and tastes like the old country.  Great food and solid prices.  Honestly have nothing negative to say.  Fiore's and Vito's are also very good if you want to switch it up.  Honestly, can't go wrong with any of the three, but I've always taken a liking to Luca Basi's.  For the reviewer that said they tried to "hide the prices", here's a tip... open your mouth and ask.  I've never had a problem figuring out how much a sandwich costs in any deli I've ever been to.
2016-03-18,5,One of the "must go" sandwich shops of Hoboken (along with Fiore's and Vito's). Probably my favorite since I used to live on 1st and Willow (right around the corner) and I used to get these sandwiches regularly. But you honestly can't go wrong in any of the above mentioned sandwich shops.My go to is the Big Petey on a soft roll with extra balsamic. The mutz is unbelievable here and they really load it up.
2016-03-17,1,Over it!  Hopefully this will get managements attention. Today is the second time within two months where I went to order food after the person in front of me paid in cash,... the guy taking my order prepared my mozzarella without putting gloves on or washing his hands! Then he goes to hand me my order and he has DIRT under his long nails! Barf. The last time I was in there I watched him make my sandwich again, no gloves and without washing!  I asked him to put gloves on after making my first germ filled sandwich. He was annoyed but did it.  I thought this was a one off experience but clearly it is not. Clearly this is the code of cleanliness, or lack there of!  After the first experience I called to speak to the owner (Angelo, I believe, but can't remember exactly) who was very apologetic on behalf of his team and assured me this would not happen again.  Well, here we are. We have been coming here for 7+ years. We caterer every party with have through them, but I will NOT be ordering here again. There are far too many places in town with good mutz and clean deli meat. I am so disgusted thinking about all the germs on their meat. I mean, we are not talking about products that are going to be cooked or heated where germs may be zapped. This is DELI MEAT! cheeses! There are absolutely no excuses. This place has been around for far too long for this.  Gag!
2016-03-01,5,I live nearby and frequent this deli.  The food is consistently amazing.  It's not cheap, but I can't resist coming back for the amazing grilled chicken dinner platters.  I've had a few subs here too and the ingredients are always fresh.  Highly recommended.
2016-02-21,1,Luce Brasi's tried to rip me off. They hide the prices and then have food in the bag before they tell you how much. These guys are disgusting.Go elsewhere, you'll thank me.
2016-02-16,1,There remain few good reasons to frequent this establishment. Price increases are out of control, service is nonexistent and quality has declined.  When they've got their act together, they produce a good product but even then it is no longer worth what you're charged; which can vary daily for the same item. Quite simply it's not worth the hassle.
2016-02-14,5,2nd best Italian subs in town. Pro tip, penne vodka with chicken cutlet is bomb. Dlvy is quick too!
2016-02-08,5,Great lunch specials, and great sandwiches. There open late so thats always a plus. Love there sweet Marie.
2016-01-30,5,The go to spot for fresh mutz. They make it every day and this is one of my favorite sandwich spots on the east coast.  Try the turkey with mutz and honey mustard. I would have never thought the combo would be good but it was great.  Solid Italian specialties as well.
2016-01-18,5,When I take out its always from here. Great sandwiches friendly service a Hoboken staple!!!
2016-01-17,5,I can eat here everyday. Their food is amazing.  You have to try their turkey sandwiches. So good.  I have to order from them before a car ride.
2016-01-16,5,I can't tell you how long it has been since I have been to a real Italian spot; not just a place that pretends to be authentic.  This is why I love Jersey.  This is a counter service cafe but, there are tables inside.  Place your order, grab a drink and it won't be too long until you get your food.Mozzarella Sticks:  Cheesy, fried and flavorful.  Everything you would expect.Little Petey (pepperoni, fresh mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes): When they say fresh mozzarella they really mean it.  All toppings were fresh and this is a huge sandwich.  So satisfying that I wanted to lick the paper even though I was full.  This sandwich is what this Italian girl's dreams are made of.Cannoli:  The filling was slightly off and I think the ratio of powder sugar was too high in measurement to the ricotta.  This may just be a personal preference though.I loved this place and I can't wait to come back and make a trip to Hoboken just to stop here.
2016-01-12,5,The BEST deli in Hoboken! My fiance and I order from them every Monday. Fast delivery, delicious, fresh mozzarella! The best deli sandwiches in town!
2016-01-01,1,I've never felt so compelled to write a review on Yelp. I sit here waiting for my order 2 hours after I placed it. They brought the first half of it but even that was too hard. We had a group order of 7 bacon egg and cheeses. They brought three. But they left out the cheese - one third of the ingredients. We also ordered iced coffees but they told us they didn't have them and brought hot ones. Apparently they don't have ice. We ordered a cinnamon bagel with butter. They gave us an everything bagel with cream cheese. I called to tell them we need the rest of our order... "Right away" they said. 45 minutes later I called and got the manager. "I'm so sorry. What's your address? We just need to bring you cheese right?". Wow. We sort it out.bThe sandwiches and bagel will be here in 10. 45 minutes later... I call back. "Oh thank god you called" he says. "What's your address?" I tell him three times and he says "okay bye". Hangs up. 20 minutes later food arrives. The two sandwiches are there. The bagel is now just a roll with butter in it. Do not give this place business. Ever.
2015-12-23,1,I've lived around the corner and been a customer at Luca Brasi's for about 10 years now. The low rating is not for the food, as it's typically great. Over the past few months whenever I've gone there I've left remembering why after the previous visit I told myself "never again". This is because the prices have gotten WAY out of control. Today I spent $18 on a regular sandwich on rye (not even one of their large specialties on a sub roll), the smallest size pasta salad side they have and a bottle of soda. Charging individually for standard toppings like lettuce, onions, tomatoes, etc...??? C'mon guys! You do enough business to not have to continually jack up the prices and run off your loyal customers. If things ever come back down to sane levels I'll be back, but for now I'm done.
2015-12-19,3,The "vodka sauce" is not vodka sauce at all. More like an Alfredo sauce. Subs were good though.
2015-12-14,2,Not impressed. Ordered a sandwich and a salad. Both were so so. Pros: not food related- Ordering online was quick and simple, food was delivered fast.
2015-11-30,4,Ordered delivery from here. Good sandwiches. Wasn't a huge fan of my tuna (#1 Luca Brasi's sandwich) though - I think it's just personal preference though - I like it better with mayo. All the other elements of the sandwich were good though - good bread, delicious mozz, really fresh lettuce and tomato. Tried a bite of my boyfriend's chicken cutlet, red peppers and mozz sub and that was awesome - will get that for myself next time. Definitely a great option for sandwiches in the neighborhood.
2015-11-17,4,had  basic ham, salami and mozz..a bit steep in price but  large portion..out half in the fridge for tmrw :)
2015-11-15,4,solid sandwichs.  fuggeta boudit is a great sandwich.  skip the FF.  horrible.
2015-11-04,5,Very friendly, lots of variety, I asked for a sandwich with no meat and it's amazing thank you xo
2015-10-31,1,Ordered some delivery from here. The order not only took an hour and a half to arrive... The Cesar salad was loaded with black hair! Absolutely disgusting. When calling to complain, the did not believe me and said the delivery driver would have to come and collect the food so they could look at it before refunding me. What type of customer service is that?!
2015-10-12,5,Ordered a big Petey to be delivered on campus. Fresh and delicious. Definitely will order again !
2015-09-30,2,Eating my Italian combo right now...Prosciutto that I paid for? No...oil and vinegar? No. Second time this place disappointed. Never again will I pay 11.00 for what amounts to a supermarket hero
2015-08-23,3,Sandwich was good until I realized they forgot the roasted peppers. I order a Fuggeda' Boudit and, despite the momentary disappointment at not having the full experience of the sandwich with all its ingredients, was glad that it was still one of the better Italian subs I've had. Definitely an option on a late Sunday afternoon/early evening when jersey city options are limited.
2015-08-16,5,I feel really lucky to be living so close to this place! One of my favorite delis to get a hero. So far I've tried their Little Petey and Fuggeda' Boudit, both of which blew my mind. Now I'm on a mission to try out all of their "Meat the Family" sandwiches. They give you a generous amount of fresh cold cuts and creamy house-made mozzarella piled between a fresh hero roll.The quality and deliciousness of their stuff, coupled with the fact that they have so many items on their menu, is guaranteed to make me keep coming back for more.
2015-08-09,4,Walked by this place by an accident. Hubby had visited here once and mentioned that they offered the best freshly made mozzarella. I got #3. Little Petey Sub: Pepperoni, slabs of fresh mozzarella cheese and sun dried tomatoes, which tasted like pizza. My husband got #6. Fuggeta' Boudit Italian Super Sub: Thumann boiled ham, salami, capicola, fresh slabs of home made mozzarella cheese and roasted red peppers.which was massive. We had the sandwiches for stay. There were about 5 tables inside and another 4 outside. There were a lot of pickle jars on the windows, which was very cool.
2015-07-26,3,Food is solid. But everytime I order online, the price is different than the menu price online. I'll still go back, but I'll just make sure I ask how much it is before I order.
2015-07-20,4,Note: This review is based on delivery only.Delicious subs! I'm still full thinking about what I ate last night. The bread is super fresh and they pile on the meat and cheeses like you wouldn't believe. I had the eggplant parm, and I was in shock at the portion size when it arrived. I probably should've shared it, but it made for a great second meal. I took a bite of the Big Paulie ' s sub as well, and it tasted amazing. They're not kidding around when they state on the menu it comes with SLABS of mozz, as well as pruscitto and sun-dried tomatoes. Very tasty. Very fresh. Reasonably priced (typically around $7-10 for a sandwich). $20 delivery min, so we ordered an appetizer as well. Definitely didn't need all that food for two people, so if you don't plan on saving or sharing, it's a waste. Also, the sandwiches are huge, so they can get a bit messy. Napkins are a must!
2015-07-11,1,I've gone to Luca's twice now, and I recommend no one goes unless you want to wait a long time just to have your order messed up. My first stop in I got a grilled cheese with ham, which is what they wrote down, called it when it was ready, and charged me for. After I left I found out that what I actually got was a cold grilled cheese with no ham in it.My second trip in was this morning for two breakfast sandwiches. They were out of English muffins, which is perfectly fine, so I asked for it on whole wheat toast. After a 20 minute wait they called out my order, except they apparently thought I wanted it on a wrap. It took another 10 minutes for them to remake it. Even 20 minutes seems like a long wait for a couple breakfast sandwiches, but this place does not seem able to make an order right. After all of that, the breakfast sandwiches weren't even that great. Definitely do not go here.
2015-06-25,3,Sandwiches were good, nothing to write home about. But, if you need a quick bite it's a good place to grab one and it won't break the bank. I personally prefer nearby Losurdo's because I feel their bread is better. Cannolis are definitely not recommended. They are not filled fresh and sit in the glass case with olives. That results in soggy crust and filling that has taken on the taste of olives. Of course this place isn't priding itself on such things, but still... don't get one.
2015-06-19,4,Their rice balls are out of this world.... i've got friends and family hooked.... It makes life easy knowing that some folks always welcome food from Luca Brasi's as my contribution to a meal. Zero effort and all the praise.... great plan!!!
2015-06-18,4,I've only eaten here twice but the two sandwiches I've had-eggplant and chicken parms-were very good. It's does a good job with the basic parm sandwiches. Though I'd rather go to Tony B's for a little more creativity.  I'm curious about their cold cut sandwiches, which is the true harbinger of an Italian Deli, so I'll be back to update the review accordingly.
2015-06-06,5,This is a really great place to get a sandwich or soup or something else...I highly recommend the roast beef with gravy and mozzarella.  That thing is awesome.
2015-05-18,4,Hoboken has a plethora of Italian delis and Luca Brasi is not one to ignore. The sandwich selection is bountiful, the fresh muzz is perfection and you definitely get some bang for your buck out of a 8.99 dollar sandwich. I almost always order a Big Paulie- heaping slabs of prosciutto with a chunk of fresh muzz in every single bite and sun dried tomatoes for crunch and flavor. Now, I'll warn you- these things are enormous, especially if you don't want to spend the rest of your day in a food coma. Half a sandwich works just fine for one meal. I always bring up sharing, but there are a few major things standing in my way: -They cut the sandwiches really unevenly. Every time I order it's never cut in half and instead is cut about two thirds of the way in- a wee bit strange, but it's fine, I always eat the bigger half first. -They've got a 20 dollar delivery minimum. Getting off the couch is hard sometimes. -My normal dining companion does not like prosciutto, and always opts for one of the more classic style subs with every type of meat imaginable. -After you have half it's normal to want to save the other half for a future meal. I've got a looooong list of other Italian deli's to try in Hobo, but Luca Brasi's will always hold a special place in my heart.
2015-05-15,4,Classic Italian vibe, delicious eggplant parm sandwich.
2015-04-28,4,If you are looking for a sandwich for lunch or meal for dinner, definitely check this place out!Cant go wrong with one of their signature sandos (Lil Petey and Fuggeda' Boudit are staples) but also my go-to is usually grilled chicken with mozz and bruschetta - so good and I normally can get 2 meals out of it.As for breakfast unfortunately not really a fan - gave them 2 chances - one time I got a bacon, egg and cheese and there was barely any egg if any on there and I did the same another time while the contents were sufficient, the roll was stale....I will continue to support this amazing deli for lunch and dinner!
2015-04-05,4,Yummy deli subs and one of my favorite Taylor ham, egg and cheese sandwiches in town! Fair pricing, and decent sizes. Can take a little while to get your food if it's busy, but at least you know it's all freshly made!
2015-03-26,3,I have ordered from here for the past 4 years. 9 times out of 10 they usually mess up my order. I always give them another try because it is close to where I live. They have raised their prices drastically over the past 2 years, and I am not sure if the quality of their food has actually improved. I like that they are close, and usually open a bit later than other places, but I think the quality could be a lot better.
2015-03-23,4,This place is right near my apartment. Not only is it convenient but the food is good, the service was fast and it didn't break my wallet. Ordered to-go a chicken parm sandwich. It was about $9 (average price for Hoboken sandwich). The guy at the counter was nice, took my order and waited about 5 minutes before it was ready. Super fast!The bread was a soft, Italian hero. The sauce was banging; it was a great Italian red sauce with a nice sweetness to it. Overall really great chicken parm.
2015-03-22,5,This place is a Hoboken staple. Everything about it is amazing. I just moved to uptown Hoboken and was so sad I couldn't pop by once a week for my sandwich but even their delivery is good. Yes they get 5 stars
2015-03-19,2,This review pertains to the 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour' I took last week!  This is not an official tour--just something I decided to embark upon during my visit up North.It is a comparison between 5 different Hoboken delis that make fresh mozzarella cheese.Growing up in Hoboken I feel like I know a few things:  Good pizza, good bagels, and the best mozzarella cheese on Planet Earth.I admit I was, and am, biased.  For the last 28 years I've gone primarily to Vito's Deli. It's always been my, and my mother's, favorite.This time around my boyfriend (who had never had any Hoboken mozzarella cheese before) and I decided it was time to put the cheese to the test.  I'm sure we missed a few places but we had limited time so we decided to try 5 of the highest rated, longest standing, and most renowned in town.My boyfriend never had fresh mozzarella before, so he didn't even recognize this as mozzarella cheese.  Of course I told him, 'this IS mozzarella cheese. Everything else you've had packaged to date is an imposter.'I think it's important to know exactly what you're tasting, so I recommend you taste the mozzarella in each location by itself PRIOR to/INSTEAD of just ordering it in a sandwich.  The taste by itself will really show you what the mozz is made of.Here's how the tour went and brief feedback for each location's mozzarella. My feedback and ratings (above) are solely based on the caliber/taste of mozzarella cheese, not the quality of everything else they sell or the service they provide.They are ALL in comparison to Vito's since that was my baseline.  Vito's is made fresh 4 times daily.  After tasting some of the best choices in Hoboken, I've come to the conclusion there is simply no better fresh mozzarella cheese in town than Vito's. Or anywhere in the world as far as I'm concerned. It's still my favorite. Stop 1: Vito's: Buttery, soft, warm, wet, salty, and literally melts in your mouth Stop 2: Biancamano: Great mozzarella taste overall, a little chewier than Vito's, nice amount of salt and a little wet from the brineStop 3: Lisa's: Great taste inside, but not salty with each bite on the outside.  Also a bit chewier than Vito's Stop 4: Fiore's: The saltiest of all 5 mozzarellas.  Also was the coolest (temperature-wise) and was slightly chewier than Lisa's and Biancamano 5: Luca Brasi: Coldest (temperature-wise) of them all, nice amount of salt, not too buttery however.  Unfortunately I found the texture to be more like cottage cheese once you start chewing it.*This exact review is posted across 4 different locations on my 'Hoboken Mozzarella Tour.'
2015-02-22,5,An Italian deli that doesn't disappoint. Try the eggplant parmigiana and definitely get a cannoli. They also have great breakfast sandwiches - perfect for the weekend.
2015-02-21,1,Used to love this place for breakfast platters and sandwiches. Lately though, the order has never been correct. My boyfriends cheese omelette had no cheese. My bacon egg and cheese on a bagel was on a roll and  had no egg on it! Let down.
2015-02-09,4,I love the sandwiches here. Anything with fresh mozzarella is awesome. The mozzarella is so good and fresh. My mouth waters every time i order. They also have very good breakfast. Their pepper and egg or potato and egg is very tasty. Their pasta is ok but not the greatest. Any sandwich you get will be delicious. I recommend the big petey and sweet marie. They never take long and the food is always fresh. The only complaint I have is that their bread could be a little softer.
2015-01-14,5,I'm a Luca loyalist.. These sandwiches rock and they are hugeeee. They don't skimp on the meat and the mozz like other wanna/be Italian delis and the prices are very reasonable. Speaking of the mozz, it's awesome, clearly fresh and homemade. This place makes a simple turkey and mozz sub a real treat. I have a tough time eating subs from anywhere else because they never seem to stack up to Lucas!
2015-01-11,1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. We are looking for a good Italian deli. We have ordered here a few times and have the same problems. 1) delivery goes to our address in Hoboken, not Jersey City; 2) sandwiches ordered on wheat sub rolls come on white stale Italian bread; 3) mayo is on sandwiches although it was not requested; and 4) more lettuce than meat on sandwiches. We will not be ordering from here again.
2015-01-04,4,Luca Brasi is a Hoboken favorite for the well-stuffed sandwich.  This deli has the signature Hoboken experience: local bread, homemade mutz, vintage photos of Italian-American actors, and a reasonable selection of Italian sandwich standards like roast beef, meatball, eggplant and chicken parmigiana. The hot food doesn't reach that 'grandma' level in my opinion but it will do in a pinch.  My 'go to' here is the Italian sub, ham & salami, lettuce/tomato/onion/salt/pepper/oil/vinegar, and I buck the trend by getting provolone instead of the fresh mutz. The sandwich is a slightly steep $8.50, but believe me you can take out half of the filling and use it for a sandwich the next day without any feeling of sacrificing your indulgence. One of their big sellers is the egg sandwich, plain, or with peppers, potatoes, etc. Very modestly priced (I think $2-5) and available all day.  Bring your appetite to this deli, it's not the place to get a light, low fat-low carb lunch. It's a bit uncomfortable to dine in as there are always people hovering around waiting for their order, so takeout is key.  As for parking, it's Hoboken, so good luck!
2015-01-03,5,Yuuuuuuum. I've got subs here a few times and all the times were very good! very fresh :)
2014-11-26,2,Didn't enjoy the food at all. Ordered a sandwich and soup. Sandwich tasted bland and the soup was much of the same
2014-11-26,5,Love this place! I'm Italian, I love Italian, they serve Italian, I"M IN LOVE.  Their fresh mozzarella is the perfect consistency of soft and chewy and amaze-balls!  I often get prosciutto and mozzarella when I have people over and Luca Brasi's never fails to please my usually picky and opinionated crowd!  They have great salads (I enjoy the ceasar with chicken) as well as awesome sandwiches.  My boyfriend is huge fan of their chicken and meatball parm heros.  I love one of their signature sandwiches (pictured here) called "fugetaboutit".  It has all the write spicy, salty and tangy flavors.  CHECK THEM OUT STAT!  And they're on seamless, WIN WIN! Oh... how could I forget, the cannolis, rice puddddin and tiramisu are just to die for :)
2014-11-21,5,I LOVE THE SWEET MARIE! Simple yet scrumptious. The staff are nice and orders are timely. The best cannoli that I have ever had anywhere. I wouldn't get a pasta dish there and I haven't had any meat dishes there, but the sandwiches are bomb and their sides and desserts are delicious. Their home-made mozzarella is ahhh-mazing!
2014-11-20,5,Really good food and a friendly staff but it is on the expensive side.  I like that they are on Seemless though.
2014-11-19,1,This review is based on their take-out and was my first experience. The quality of the sandwich is hard to say because the food arrived cold and soggy. Part of my order was forgotten. When I asked the delivery driver where the rest of my order was he just stared at me like it was my problem. He eventually stated that he would tell them to refund me the portion of my order that he forgot because he was not bringing it back. I still have not been refunded 4 days later for the food that was never delivered. I will never be ordering from here again.
2014-11-12,4,Best Tiramisu in the town. A little more care with to-go orders though. Sometimes they miss the details, which usually makes the difference. If you know what I mean.
2014-11-12,4,Want a sandwich you can't refuse?  Need something to eat before you sleep with the fishes?  Want to leave the gun but take the hero?  There, got my bad mob movie puns out of the way.  Funny name aside there are no gimmicks about the food at Luca Brasi's deli.  They have ample outdoor seating which is nice and inside the place looks pretty run of the mill.  I was badly hungover so I stayed inside, ate half my sandwich, and then left for the train.I got a proscuitto and fresh mozzarella sandwich with roasted red peppers which was superb.  Not stingy at all with the high quality proscuitto, great homemade fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers were well done--there wasn't much to pick on here.  The bread was also great stuff and held all of this together very well.  The other half of this sandwich was a treat the next day.  Why is it so difficult to replicate this in Midtown Manhattan with it costing $18 instead of the $10 it costs here?  If a storefront can't do it a truck should.  Given the more convenient location, I may stop by here more often than the other Italian delis when I'm in Hoboken for the train.
2014-11-07,1,Long time client here. $5.85 for a bacon egg and cheese sandwich (one egg, one slice of cheese, 1 bacon strip on a deli roll) is completely unacceptable. Won't be going back.  I also hear that your price gouging everything else. #fail.
2014-10-28,5,We love the food from here - and the deli! Sausages and peppers sandwich is incredible, as is the meatball. The tiramisu is decadent and wet but so tasty! My only complaint is that the breakfast sandwiches get expensive quick and there are too many other places I can get a breakfast sammy.
2014-10-26,5,We had the ham, mozzarella , and roasted red peppers sandwich with pesto sauce and the chicken cutlet , mozzarella , and roasted red pepper sandwich with honey mustard sauce. Delicious with a size 42 font 'D'!!!
2014-10-22,5,I've ordered from here, never eaten there or stepped foot inside but I definitely would because their take out is always fresh, warm, and delivered in a timely fashion.I've ordered eggplant parm, chicken parm, turkey Heroes, etc..Every time they are delicious! The prices are pretty reasonable as well.
2014-10-08,4,I love the sandwiches here. Johnny Roastbeef is really good.
2014-09-13,1,Haven't eaten sandwich yet, because delivery has taken an hour past the initial 5 min delivery estimate when we called to check on the order. If they tell you 5 minutes, have a backup plan.
2014-09-11,1,I ate here out of desperation one day. Judging by the crowd that all looked like they moved out of the frat house/dorm 5 minutes ago I figured the quality would be low, and it was. If you want some red sauce slop thrown at you by wannabe I-talian goombahs this is the place. I should have thrown up the lunch I had here and gone to eat somewhere decent. Never again.
2014-09-08,5,My favorite local deli. Haven't had anything I didn't like. Mondays is rice ball day - so good! Don't be fooled by the tiramisu in the plastic container - it's home made and wonderful!
2014-08-20,5,The other reviewers have hit it on the head, the mozzarella is the star of the show here. However, in Hoboken that is not unique. A few things that set this place apart from the other mozz delis:-the chicken noodle soup (which is always the soup of the day) is delicious with massive chunks of fresh tender chicken and half a baguette can be a meal in itself but get it early bc when it's gone it's gone-whole wheat baguettes as a sandwich roll option, not for everyone but I like it and its different-the grilled chicken is really tasty, I like it in the sandwich with mozz, pesto, and tomatoes-peppered turkey with mozz and tomatoes, they are generous with the meat and the cracked pepper adds a little extra zing with the buttery creaminess of the mozz, a satisfying choice that doesn't leave you feeling overly full and in need of a nap 20 minutes laterThese are the little things that luca my top choice for a sandwich is a town packed with great options.
2014-08-17,4,This place have simple italian food, prices and service are great and you can usually see the owner working in the store, helping people with smile and positive energy.I can recommend the tuna salad and try to stay away from the pancakes (too big) its just not the right place to order pancakes
2014-08-17,3,Luca makes quality sandwiches, most notably the roast beef option and the various chicken cutlet sandwiches (the latter being a personal favorite). While there is quality, it is impossible to compare the quality of a Fiores deli to Luca. While this place is a good convenient deli in terms of location, it should rarely be chosen over Fiores.
2014-08-05,1,Guys behind the counter changes their prices at will. They will try to cheat you out of your money. I have gone to this deli about a dozen times in total and have confirmed what I earlier suspected. They have good food, but they'll try to scam you at every turn.  The spanish guys at the counter during midday will make up whatever price they think you will pay. The price of a breakfast sandwich varied depending on who was quoting me. Other former customers have confirmed the same scam. They have really taken Luca Brasi's thug mindset to heart.
2014-07-25,3,Do yourself a favor and DO NOT ORDER ONLINE OR BY PHONE from this deli. They will get the order wrong. Also, don't expect much in terms of "service" here. This is not a sit-down restaurant. You do not come to Luca Brasi's for a candle-lit 5-course meal. You come to Luca Brasi's for the MUTZ!This is a great deli to grab a mutz sub on your way to the pier for an afternoon in the park. Sometimes the bread they use could be fresher, but no one is perfect. I love that they have vegetarian options (thank you!). This is also a great place to come to get a pound of OOZING WARM FRESH MUTZ to make homemade pizzas with. At $10 a lb. it's not cheap, but it makes ALL the difference. You'll never go back to cooking with store-bought mutz again.Thank you, Luca Brasi's, for ruining grocery store mutz for me for the rest of my life. And also, for adding the word "mutz" to my vocabulary :)
2014-07-21,4,Fast, courteous, kind and really good food.  These guys do not disappoint..  My goto with them is a meatball parm and it' great every time.  Meatballs are pretty good if not a bit dense.  I always do takeout and have never had an issue.  Give them a shot....
2014-07-12,2,Overrated. We ordered a sandwich on the phone and picked it up. The order was turkey, capicola, fresh moz, hot cherry peppers and extra, extra oil and vinegar. We got turkey, prosciutto, and fresh moz. No cherry peppers, no capicola, and barely any oil and vinegar. The sandwich was completely wrong and very mediocre even if it was what we ordered. The portion was small and the bread wasn't good. I also ordered a side of pickles and they gave me one giant pickle in a bag. Thanks, that was fun to gnaw on while driving. There are so many good delis in Hoboken. This one is not even close.
2014-07-07,3,After 6 years of living in Hoboken I tried to like this place so much and it really was a frequent disappointment. Bread isn't great for an Italian deli, breakfast sandwiches are microwaved eggs that don't even fill the rolls and hot dishes are pretty bland. The subs are decent and the Johnny Roast beef is probably the best item on the menu. It truly amazes me how well this place does.
2014-07-04,1,I'm sorry to say that it was total fail experience for us. We ordered take out for 4 people one night. While all the orders before and after us were filled, we waited at least 20 minutes (for sandwiches and salad?!) On to the food, my chicken caesar salad was SWIMMING in dressing (see picture), the chicken was so thin and dry it was practically jerky. None of my friends barely even touched their sandwiches as the bread was super hard and the meat was gristly. My side order of artichoke antipasto was so drenched in vinegar, I couldn't even sink my teeth into it for fear of it dissolving all my teeth. Maybe this place had an off night, but I will be sticking with 2nd Street from now on.
2014-06-09,2,I go here for convenience, and the food is solid.  Its just that there are so many better places that have the same type of food in Hoboken.  The service is poor and the wait times can be ridiculous.  At 3:45pm on a Monday, it took them 10 minutes to take my order.  I ordered a turkey wrap and waited 20 minutes and saw people come in and order and get their food before me.  And that's not the first time that has happened.  Not going back.
2014-05-26,2,Stopped in yesterday for some potato salad for my BBQ. They only had one option and it looked like potatoes sopped in mayo. They didn't have quart containers, really only few options for salads and none looked appetizing. Really disappointing for an Italian deli. I used to eat here frequently for lunch and the food was decent. Really disappointed.
2014-05-25,4,One of my favorite sandwich spots in town. Recently ordered from the hot bar too. The sausage and peppers was A+. My fianceÃÅ loves the fresh made tuna. Also helps that all the employees are nice hard working guys.
2014-05-17,5,I got a sandwich with my own combo. Delish. They have hot food selections too. Love the pictures on the wall. After ordering you can sit in or outdoors and eat.
2014-05-16,1,I've been waiting more than 1hr 30min. Paid with credit card (I know, my mistake), now they're closed, not answering phones and no food. Never again.
2014-05-06,1,*this is a delivery review*I'll give Luca Brasi's one thing...they make a decent sandwich. The customer service is absolutely terrible though. I ordered my food at 7:00 with a promised delivery time of 30-40 minutes. After an hour and a half of waiting I tried calling only to find out the phones were not working. They apparently disconnect their phones at around 8:30 so they don't have to answer to their customers. Oh, and when the food got here (after 1 hour and 45 minutes) it was ice cold. Thanks Luca Brasi
2014-05-03,5,Lucas is my favorite Italian deli I hoboken. they have great sandwiches, chicken fingers. sometimes I just get a tub of vodka sauce or something like that for pasta. love their mozz, turkey sandwiches, and obviously anything with prosciutto
2014-04-28,4,My friend lives right down the block, so we decided to grab some Luca Brasi takeout. I had high hopes for this Hudson county Italian deli, and was happy they lived up to my expectations!I usually stick to deli meats and cheeses, but my friend assured me the chicken parm hero was the best here, so I went with that. I have to say, Luca Brasi makes one mean red sauce. That's what put my giant chicken parm hero over the edge.
2014-04-14,4,I've been to Fiorie's which is famous for its roast beef sandwich but I think this place is comparable to that. I got the sandwich to go and thought it was pre-assumed that the gravy would be on the side. But no, you have to explicitly state it. I got home and found out my sandwich was greasy and saggy. It was super disgusting to hold it. Despite of that, it is a good-tasting sandwich.
2014-03-10,4,Love this place for the amount of quality ingredients they stuff in their sandwiches. Open later than the other delis so this is my late night go-to. Love the fuggata bout it, the big petey and their mozzarella. Vito's does have this place beat though.  The guy behind the counter can be a dick too, especially when they're busy.
2014-02-27,3,I've ordered delivery a couple times from here.  The sandwiches are pretty good but stay away from the pasta.  It's extremely salty, and lacks flavor.  Overall just low quality ingredients.  I ordered the tortellini with meat sauce and found a large hair in it.   Overall just a disappointment based on the reviews.
2014-02-17,4,Good sandwiches.  My gf likes the bit petey and I like the chicken cutlet sandwich. We only order a few of the stuff on the menu. Some are good, some just average. I also ordered the roast beef before, not as good./... Go to fiore if you want roast beef.
2014-02-05,1,I have always enjoyed their food, but today when I ordered delivery the man was extremely rude to me. Not only will I not be eating from there again, but I will search every site that I can to downrate this restaurant.
2014-01-31,3,This place is a must... The service is fast, the food is good, but their subs are great! Pepper turkey and mutz is my fave...true Hoboken local dive... Lots of locals makes for great convo!
2014-01-25,1,They never get the order right and the place is just overall filthy and the service is the worst.I ordered pastas and there were hair and unidentified chuks in it.I would definitely recommend to stay away from it!
2013-12-17,1,I hate writing bad reviews of local places, but this place is no good. We tried ordering delivery - ordered at 7:15 pm with an estimate of 30 - 40 minutes. 1 hour and 10 minutes later we called to check and they said the food would arrive any minute. At 1 hour, 35 minutes we called again to cancel and they said, "the guy is on his way, just tell him you don't want it when he gets there." We didn't even get an apology about the crap service. This place might be OK for eat-in or takeout, but I am anti because of the delivery experience. Boo!
2013-12-07,5,The food here is amazing! The fresh mozzarella combined with their bread makes any sandwich from here easily the best sandwich in town! Your food may take a little while to prepare but it's definitely worth the wait. It's a shame they recently got rid of the panini press bc it made their sandwiches even that more amazing. Overall, if you're looking for an above average sandwich this is the place to go.
2013-11-21,5,I actually love this place.  I feel like Jared from the Subway commercials.  I've been going to Luca Brasi's for a year, and it's the only place I can get some healthy home-cooked food alla carte.
2013-11-20,5,Ohmygawd. The food here was amazing. I came here for lunch the other day and like I said before, OHMYGAWD. It was delicious! I got bologna, prosciutto, mutz, and some condiments. It was soooo good. The sandwich was huge! It was my lunch, dinner, and snack later too. And it all only cost $8.50.It's definitely a little out of the way, but for the price and quality, it's totally worth it.
2013-11-19,4,I love the chicken cutlets they have here. Delicious chicken parm. Grilled chicken Salad was pretty incredible too. Ive ordered from this place several times and never had an issue. Thanks Luca Brasi's!
2013-11-16,1,25 minutes for a bagel and cream cheese. Still waiting.  I asked guy taking order for some red pepper flakes, he snaps "we dont have them"... Theres a giant freaking tub of it right behind his head.F*CKING JERSEY
2013-11-12,4,Luca Brasi's is above average, but overall nothing to get crazy excited about. Their sandwiches are good, service is average, and their hours are very convenient. Not too thrilled with their menu or grilled chicken. That being said, the penne al a vodka is some of the best I've ever had and I've had dozens. Try it with fresh mozz cut up and thrown in.
2013-11-08,4,Johnny roast beef.  It tastes better than the fun of saying that sandwich.  I shall be back for you Johnny.
2013-10-31,1,DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. If I could give it zeros stars I would. Ordered delivery at 8pm and they said 30 min. delivery. At 9:15, I still did not receive and I called and it took me 4 different tries of unlimited calling for them to pick up. And only then did they say "It's coming in 2 minutes." Of course, at 9:25, they still did not come. I called back and it rang for about 5 minutes but still no one answered. Then I called AGAIN and they DISCONNECTED the phone (beeping sound). Needless to say, we never got our food. Worst delivery place ever. DO NOT DELIVER FROM HERE. (maybe food order at store is better as obviously this place has gotten some great reviews). Audrey ChenAuchen520@gmail.com
2013-10-20,5,This deli is amazing !!! Food is delicious .. Delivery is fast.  They are very accommodating and will make pretty much anything you want. Cannot say enough good things about this place !
2013-09-27,4,*Disclaimer* I must apologize for being a creature of habit. You may find that most (read: all) of my reviews are/will be based on the 1 or 2 items I've actually had at any given establishment. That being said...Cracked Pepper Turkey & Fresh Mozzarella w/Arugula on a round roll. Yea....that.I've had the luxury of trying quite a few Hoboken delis this year and I'm calling this the best mozzarella I've had as of yet. Sometimes I find myself picking it off my sandwich only to look down and find a cheeseless half sandwich (sadness). I'm usually picking up for lunch and I'm in and out in under 10min every time. They're fast, affordable, and delicious. What more can you ask of a deli? (When I'm lazy I order from delivery.com to get some points.)This was actually my lunch today. I have a mostly cheeseless half-sandwich in my purse as I stand here waiting for the bus home. I'm excited for dinner!
2013-09-22,4,Salami with fresh Mutz, OH MY!! Bread is fresh, meat is delicious and it's not too far from path! Staff is very inviting and helps with suggesting their faves. The Big Petey was okay, in the future I'd stick to my cold cut sandwich.
2013-09-16,4,This place rocks. If you are looking for an authentic italian deli this does the trick. The guys are always super nice. Their fresh mozzarella is delicious and I recommend adding it to any sub. They also make delicious breakfast sandwiches. Taylor ham, egg and cheese...now thats straight Jersey!!
2013-09-02,5,This place is awesome....you have too meet the family.....Johnny roast beef#5 is the best sandwich for me...luca is the best deli in town...
2013-08-29,5,Delicious mozzarella and mortadella!! Staff was so friendly they gave me a free fruit with my sandwich!
2013-08-27,4,Great food with fast delivery.I have gotten different types of pasta combinations, cold sandwiches, and hot sandwiches and have been yet to be disappointed.  Love their roast beef and mozz as well as their eggplant parm sandwich.  Definitely a go to spot for fast delicious dinner.
2013-08-23,4,I can highly recommend the hero with proscuitto, fresh mutz, and roasted peppers as well as the one with roast beef, fresh mutz, and gravy. I haven't had anything else yet, since I'm pretty new to the neighborhood, but I keep going back for those two. It's the real deal. Their delivery is also really fast most of the time.
2013-08-19,1,Overrated. The cold sandwiches are pretty good. My favorite is the Big Petey an it doesn't disappoint, but most of the rest of the menu does. Anyone that says this is good Mutz obviously hasn't been to Fiore's. it's decent at best. Stay away from the hot food, it's just not good. They don't toast the bread and it gets soggy and gross. It's a place for a decent cold cut sandwich, other than that I would find something else
2013-08-05,4,Here is the thing about Luca Brasi's it's easily the 6th or 7th best Italian deli in Hoboken but if you moved it anywhere else in this country it would be THE place you took guests to and that everyone would rave about. The food is great. They have good mozz. The best part is that they have great hours and are very convenient. That is the biggest reason I go there over the other Hoboken deli's.I order nearly the same thing everything I go (Little Petey Toasted) a drink and chips but the price I pay is never consistent but I am okay with that as long as it's in a certain range.Tourist: Worth the short walk if you're in town for Carlos and you dont want to go to La Isla or grab a slice of pizza.
2013-07-29,1,I ordered a grilled chicken hero from this place With roasted red peppers sun-dried tomatoes and fresh Mutz. I asked the guy on the phone if they had wheat rolls And he said yes.  About an hour later, 20 minutes past what was promised, The food arrived.  To my shock it was one piece of grilled chicken between two pieces of wheat bread?  It wasn't even a roll let alone a hero?  I called up and told them this must be a mistake?  The kid on the phone said, "No guy thats what you ordered".  I said "How do you send two pieces of bread when someone orders a hero sandwich?"  He said, "You said wheat".  I said, "I know what I ordered I ordered a grilled chicken hero wheat?  You never heard of a Wheat hero roll?".  I asked if they would replace it I would come pick it up and they refused.  I called my credit card to have the charge reversed and they told me "Looking at the records you're not the first one to complain about this place".  I would never leave a bad review for a business that could possibly harm someones business, But when a business openly rips a customer off, they deserve all they get.  STAY AWAY, foods gross anyway.  They should try and spend some time pretending to be Italian cooks instead of pretending to be fake mobsters,
2013-07-21,4,Love this place. Extremely fast if you go to the store as well as reasonable delivery times. I'm a sucked for the Big Paulie - completely overstuffed with delicious prosciutto, motz, and tomatoes.  The stuffed pepper shooters are now a staple to my order as well. I've had the pasta and salads as well and they are huge. Everything you expect and always tasty.I only gave four stars because the one time I got a hot sub (I generally stick to cold) is the eggplant parm was lacking in sauce and overall on the dry side. Still good flavors, just needed a little more sauce.  Oh, and the bread is fantastic.  I'm afraid to try any other sandwiches in town after having strayed in the past and been disappointed.
2013-07-11,1,2nd time we have ordered with them recently where they did not get our order right, plus, it took 1.5 hours to get here. We even order through seamless - so they see the order in writing - no excuse to get an order wrong twice in a row (not like they didn't hear us correctly over the phone). Sandwiches delivered warm and soggy.
2013-06-23,4,This place is about as legit as it gets when it comes to cold Italian subs.  Hoboken is known for it's food and Italian heritage.  This place does not disappoint.  I've been on a hunt for the best Italian sub lately as I get fixated on certain cravings from time to time.  Italian subs with fresh mutz have been the most recent must have.  As mentioned in a below review I had the  # 6 Fuggeda' Boutit (Ham, Salami, Cappicolla, Mozzarella & Roasted Peppers with balsamic vinegar).  I added red wine vinegar, lettuce tomato and black olives.  I had to meet the minimum delivery charge as it was pouring and I chose to stay dry.The meats were incredibly fresh and the fresh mozzarella was probably the best I've had in a while.  I will definitely come here for ingredients next time I'm hosting a party and need appetizers.  The food was so good that I actually woke up at 4 am and passed the fridge and took another bite.  Solid sandwich.  I've ordered it twice.The only thing that made me unhappy is that they charge $2 for delivery.  I guess next time I will walk instead of shelling out delivery and tip charge.  Also, I'd stick to the cold sandwiches as well.  Too many Italian restaurants with better hot food.  This place is the perfect deli, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an impressive lunch sandwich.
2013-06-21,4,If you are looking for a quality sandwich in Hoboken, you need to make it a point to get here, especially if you appreciate fresh mozzarella!
2013-05-09,3,I have been a loyal customer here for years, but I have to say that in the past year or so, this place has really fallen off. The mozzarella sticks are consistently undercooked and tonight, for a capper, they didn't bother to secure the lid on the marinara sauce. My order -- soda, mozzarella sticks, salad -- came completely doused in sauce. Not impressed. In a town with this many delis, you have to do better than that.
2013-05-05,5,Just left Hoboken after 10 years and this was definitely my go-to for sandwiches the whole time I lived there.  As a matter of fact, I ordered an italian sub just about every 4 days for the month before I left.  Great bread, they slice the meat as thin as you want it (although I always asked for easy on the meat since they do pile it on).  Also love the Sweet Marie and Big Paulie.  Great fresh mozzarella.
2013-05-03,4,Ate here a couple of months ago, Love, love their turkey, ham and mozzarella, loaded with meat and cheese. Serves as lunch and dinner sandwich that's how stuff in there. Definitely recommend it.
2013-04-30,4,On walking into this place I was in love, the pictures on the walls, the meats and cheeses hanging in the window is a real old school Italian deli.  We went here today for lunch after getting home from the airport.  My wife had the # 6 Fuggeda' Boutit (Ham, Salami, Cappicolla, Mozzarella & Roasted Peppers with balsamic vinegar) and I had the # 2 the Big Paulie (Prosciutto, Mozzarella & Sun dried tomatoes).  The sandwiches were large and very filling.  The mozzarella was good, but I have had better (not much though).  That may be the only downside of this place. "maybe I am nitpicking just a bit :-)" Definitely see myself coming back here in the near future and may see if they will deliver to me.
2013-04-28,1,Food is cold. Charging $3 feee for 1.5 hour delivery.The mot of egg white is still clear RAW and flowing in egg sandwich. Are you serious?  That's how you make egg?  How can you mess a egg sandwich up so bad?It's expensive and terrible breakfast.
2013-03-26,5,Moved to Hoboken one monrh ago, I can honestly say Luca Brasi is one of the best deli's Hoboken has to offer! Wether it's to eat-in, take out or for delivery. The food is delicious and tge sandwiches are to die for. The staff is very kind and professional. I would recommend to one and all!
2013-03-26,5,The food is criminal. One of my favorite places for coffee. Grilled chicken provolone and mayo is my go to sandwich. My GF loves them too and buds in the city always ask me to bring fresh cuts and mutz. Friendly and fast.  Johnny is awesome.
2013-03-21,3,Thought the sandwiches were average. I'd walk a few more blocks and get something from Fiore's or Vito's.
2013-03-14,1,Terrible. Waited over an hour and half for delivery which never came!  Called for an update and was told they were to busy to deliver!  My first time trying this deli and ends in shame! Please create an option that allows for no stars, I am not even being harsh, the one star is undeserving.
2013-03-07,3,I was starving after running some nearby errands, so decided to stop in at Luca Brasi's for a sandwich.  In a town with a lot of deli competition, they did ok - I would say middle of the pack.The first thing I noticed is that they are much cleaner than Lisa's - so starting off on the right foot.I ordered Broccoli Rabe & Mozz, and my husband ordered Turkey - to go.  The wait was reasonable and the price was extremely reasonable for the size of the sandwiches.So, the guy took my order as BR & Mozz, called my order as BR & Mozz when it was ready for pick up - and then I get all the way home and realize that they've given me Roast Beef and Mozz.  So that was definitely a huge strike.The sandwich itself was pretty good, but Fiore's and Vito's are better - hence the 3 stars.  The mozzarella was surprisingly good - really creamy and fresh.  The bread was also good.  But the roast beef, besides not being what I ordered, was kind of dry and not as rare as I like (and also not drenched in fabulous delicious gravy a la Fiore's)I would definitely give them another try, though, despite the mix up.  And really, it's not like a town can have too many options when it comes to Italian delis :)
2013-02-04,5,Authentic Italian fare! We are vegetarians, tried the eggplant parm sandwich, pasta primavera, focaccia mozzarella, tiramisu & cannoli and everything was wonderful. Service was personal and at the end, the owner threw in the dessert for free! Felt at home, will return!!
2013-01-26,4,We just ordered from Jersey City. They delivered. I had chicken parm with spaghetti. Food was plenty and good taste. Overall, I was satisfied with the food. I recommend it if you are close by.
2013-01-19,5,The absolute best sandwich in Hoboken! My family always asks me to bring home sandwiches when I go to visit them in PA. We will miss this place when we leave Hoboken-but we will be making some trips in from the burbs every now and then for our Luca's fix.
2013-01-17,5,Awesome Italian Deli!! The mozzarella cheese is the freshest I've had in a long time. The broccoli rabe is delicious, the bread for their huge sandwiches and hoagies is amazing.I have enough food for two meals from one hot sandwich. And their delivery is super fast!
2013-01-12,5,Hands down the best sandwiches, dinners, and MUTZ in Hoboken.The bread is so soft and delicious. Everything is also very affordable.I would highly recommend their cannoli's as well, which are better than any place I have ever had.
2013-01-06,4,I would have given them 5 stars but I had to take a star off for one bad experience with a chicken cutlet sandwich.  They serve very dense brick oven subs which can make for a messy sandwich.  But the food is very good and worth it.
2012-11-04,5,I mean really, when in Hoboken, and at an Italian deli, with a cute Italian stud behind the counter that makes your cheeks blush by the way he says vinegar ("vineagaah") you are left no choice but to order the sandwich on the menu named "Fuggeda'Boudit".This baby was a true italian cold cut sandwich. Meats piled high, a huge chunk of fresh mozzarella, and loaded with the fixings you fancy. I fell in love with the arancini ball that was larger than the palm of my hand. I always need something sweet after so I was excited to see cannolis available. They have them premade in the cold case so that softenes the shell slightly leaving me with just a meh cannoli. They deliver. You can dine in or takeout. And they take plastic. What more can you ask for from a local deli. Not much.
2012-10-20,4,Always great food, good service with a smile and reasonable prices. This is an Italian Deli that does make hot/cold subs or meals. You can also order online and have it delivered. Catering is awesome as well for a platter of sandwiches with fresh italian bread and fantastic fresh mozzarella.   There are limited deli tables and chairs. Its always bustling with people at all hours.
2012-10-17,4,There's not a lot to say about Luca Brasi's, so I'll keep it short and sweet.There is a good variety onf the menu, and the food is fresh and tasty. My sandwich was HUGE and piled with delicious, fresh ingredients, and it tasted as good as it looked. Oh, and it was reasonably priced!The interior is certainly not the nicest you'll find, but it's quaint. And there is a small, but pleasant outdoor eating area as well. The paying/ordering/picking up process is a little confusing. But if I can do it, so can you.Go eat at Luca Brasi's or [Godfather joke redacted]!
2012-10-10,4,Pretty damn good italian sandwich. Ill have to try more in order to compare it to Lisa's, Vito's, and Fiore's
2012-09-25,5,Had lunch at this place this afternoon. I ordered the Little Petey which consisted of pepperoni with mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes...everything about the sandwich was amazing, including the bread. My boyfriend had the Big Paulie which was prosciutto with mozzarella and instead of sun dried tomatoes, he had roasted peppers.This place is a must if you are visiting Hoboken. We originally went out there for a day trip to see Carlo's bakery, but I must say the highlight of the trip ended up being Luca Brasi's Deli. It's such an old school, Italian style deli with quality food. I will definitely be visiting it again one last time before I leave NYC.
2012-09-15,4,The Sandwiches at Luca Brasi's are amazing.  The bread is so good and the quality of the meats are excellent. The only thing that worries me is the people behind the register. They short changed me $5 today and I think they knew I was distracted when paying. Otherwise this place is a definite hit in Hoboken.
2012-09-14,5,LB is one of the best things about Hoboken! We catered a party we had at home with their sandwiches (lots of fresh mozz--yum!), buffalo wings, stuffed mushrooms, and meatballs. The food was delicious and well-received, and the counter and delivery staff were very friendly and helpful. I have ordered dinner from LB through delivery.com, and the delivery always comes promptly and is correct. I think of this place as a true Jersey deli--friendly counter guys, big yummy overstuffed sandwiches, good coffee. A real Hoboken gem!
2012-09-13,4,Always good, always affordable, always a zoo. Half a hero is enough for me, so I either share with the wife or have leftovers.
2012-09-09,4,i love luca brasi's. i think it's one of the best delis in hoboken. the luca brasi sandwich (italian tuna with fresh mozz) is amazing. the tuna and mozz together is a delicious combination. they give you a big portion too, they pile on the tuna and mozz. bread is the way an italian hero should be--a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. definitely recommend if you are in the area.
2012-08-29,4,Living just 2 blocks away, Luca Brasi's always comes in handy, especially on nights I work late. I find that all their sandwiches are fresh and satisfies my craving. I've never had a bad sandwich here which I think says a a lot for the amount of sandwiches they make a day. Occasionally they are a little messy for my liking, specifically the ones they cook/heat up (chick/meatball parm, Johnny roast beef), but they are also some of my top recommendations to people who like those type of sandwiches. I do prefer Fiore's Roastbeef, Mozz and Grazy, although I believe they only serve them 2 days a week, while Luca Brasi's you can get them any time . I've had all but 2 of the all in the family and they are worth it. All together it's a great deli and worth a try.
2012-08-14,4,This place makes a pretty great sandwich.  Their mozzarella is nice and salty and fresh.  Go for the prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich with a little balsamic.  Its the best.  I also regularly eat their chicken cutlet with lettuce, tomato and honey mustard.  Rice balls are pretty good too.  This place is all around a great deli.  The food is consistently good too.If you are in downtown Hoboken and need an Italian deli, give this place a try.
2012-08-05,1,Nicely put Yelp, Eek! Methinks not... A few of us ordered from here for delivery. I got the Chicken Bruschetta Sandwich and it was very bland. The chicken was dry and the breadcrumb crust covering the cutlet was soggy. It was a hearty serving, but a sad sandwich. I couldn't eat it all. A friend ordered the Eggplant sandwich and expressed similar sentiments.
2012-07-29,4,Screw other delis, I'm going Italian from now on. Luca Brasi's is legit.I've been told "you need to try Fiores, you need to try Lisa's," ever since I moved here, and I've been meaning to. The problem is they're both too far when you're hungover, so I went to Luca Brasi's and got a pretty basic sandwich: turkey, mozz, hot peppers and mayo on a hard roll. Other than being messy, it was a damn good sammie, with the fresh mozz stealing the show. They throw a big honkin' slab of it on your sandwich, so it makes up more than half of the filling. There's a wide variety of sandwiches here (the "Meet the Family" special menu looks REAL good), so I'll definitely come back for more. It isn't the cheapest option in town, but it leaves you full, so it's a good value. They also have hot selections, but I think if you go here, you gotta get a sandwich. I'll probably my get my sandwiches without sauce next time, as it made the sandwich pretty drippy; they don't skimp on the dressing, which for some people may be fine.
2012-07-19,4,Great sandwiches in Hoboken! They also deliver and are open somewhat late, so it's a win-win. The Big Petey is my favorite. They are always generous with the meat and the cheese. The only complaint is that sometimes the bread is a little too dry/tough. But otherwise, try it. You will not be disappointed!
2012-06-05,4,Oh man that's a good sandwich.  Luca's was one of my regular spots when I first moved to Hoboken.  The Big Petey and chicken cutlet sandwiches are my favorites.  Another one of the things I miss about downtown.
2012-05-22,4,There will always be a special place in my heart for Luca Brasi's because it was the first place I ever ate at in Hoboken. It is a must hit place for sandwich lovers. The sandwiches are large, well priced, and made with quality ingredients. I'd recommend the "meet the family" section of the menu, but in reality I can't imagine not liking any of their sandwiches.Their pasta is delicious and the portions are huge. They have a cheap breakfast menu as well. My only gripe is I wish they were open later, would love a fresh sandwich after going out on a Friday night.
2012-05-09,4,Luca Brasi Sleeps Wit Da Fishes.  Classic line.  Classic Jersey Italian Deli.  This place is solid.  A short walk from the PATH.  Great sandwiches all around.  I've been going here for ages.  Quick service, and tables to sit and eat (which is a HUGE rarity at Hudson County delis).  This time, I got the Big Petey, which was bomb.  My girl got a chicken caesar salad, which wasn't as good as their sandwiches, but was okay.
2012-04-27,1,ordered from this restaurant last night through delivery.com.  The order did not arrive for 2 hours after i placed it.  The food was cold.  I ordered a cheese steak that was horrible.  The meat was tough and dry.  I basically threw it out after one bite.  The only thing that tasted remotely good were the french fries.  I would not order from this place again.
2012-04-15,4,Sandwiches are the best I've had in Hoboken (so far, as I've yet to try Fiore's or Lisa's).  Mozzarella is incredibly fresh and the prosciutto is some of the best I've ever had (I'll admit, I've had a lot).  Here's a sandwich I recommend that isn't on the menu:Prosciutto, Mortadella, fresh mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, onion and balsamic vinegar.  I can't take the credit for that one, my fiance came up with it.Unbelievable deli sandwiches.  Can't speak for the other food, but it looks delicious.It's a little pricey, but well worth it.
2012-04-07,4,This place is the best Italian deli in Hoboken. I highly recommend.
2012-03-19,3,Good sandwiches... they pile on the ingredients and toppings, so you get your moneys worth. Good value, good deli. Different to Fiore's or Vitos, but does the job nicely.
2012-03-09,5,AMAZING sandwhiches. We stumbled upon here after reading reviews on yelp. We were staying at the W by River street and it was a nice walk to the deli. We had the meatball and chicken sandwhich and it was huge! we didn't imagine it being so big. So we both split our sandwhiches and each ate half of each and it was delish!
2012-03-04,4,Great deli. From the Italian sub to the tuna. Never had bad food from here
2012-01-30,5,AMAZING sandwiches. I'm not sure about the other food, it's not even worth trying in my mind with such amazing sandwiches.  The fresh mozzarella is outstanding, and their balsamic vinegar is great.  The sanwiches don't come with the balsamic but I'll normally add it to the Sweet Marie (mozarella, sun-dried tomatoes, argula) or the Big Paulie (proscuitto, mozarella, sun-dried tomatoes). It's worth calling ahead, because there's always a wait. You can also eat there, but it's just a few tables and chairs with pictures of Italian folks and Sinatra on the walls.  It's very basic, so not really worth eating there - but you can take it with you to the nearby park or pier when it's nice.
2012-01-03,4,Probably closer to a 5.Used to come here on a weekly basis when I was still around; pretty much everything is great.  Sandwiches are especially amazing (oh god the mozzarella)...almost drooling thinking about them right now.  The pasta sauces are a bit on the watery side, but still good.
2011-12-23,5,My husband doesn't live in HOB anymore now that we are in downtown JC, but this is one place we used to miss dearly until we discovered Second Street Bakery.  Luca Brasi's is the best.  You cannot go wrong ordering any type of sandwich here, unless it doesn't have fresh mozzarella.  Must. Get. Fresh. Mozz!
2011-12-15,5,Usually order the ham/salami/mozz - they make large sandwiches with huge chunks of cheese, and they are consistently better than any of the other sub shops around town.
2011-12-07,4,Gotta love Yelp! Your reviews led me to Luca Brasi's during my stay in Hoboken.  Everything in Hoboken is in walking distance, so I walked my tooshy a few blocks this way and a few blocks that way, and ended up at Luca's.  I ordered the chicken bruschetta sandwich and it was DELISH! Huge chicken breast, loaded with the best bruschetta mix I've every had. If the guy asks you 'doyawannapayfodisnow'? He's actually asking if you want to pay for your items now or when it's ready. He had to ask me 4 times before I understood his heavy Jersey accent! Sorry, I'm from California.
2011-12-06,4,If you like big italian sandwiches, this is the place.  The ingredients are fresh.  The flavors are on, and the portions are generous, especially for the prices.  I really haven't ventured outside of their selection of italian subs, but each time i have one, i'm always satisfied.  I had previously lived in hoboken for 5 years, left for a few years in boston(which also has a solid italian/american community), and then just recently returned to hoboken.  This was the first place i came back to, and while away, could not find a deli that could match that of Luca's.  Bottom line: i've never had a bad sandwich, and i'll be sure to recommend it to anyone visiting town.
2011-11-20,4,This is a good Italian deli.  I mean it's nothing spectacular.  The sandwiches are decent and cheap.  The patrons are friendly.  I have had better sandwiches at other places.
2011-11-17,3,I've had Luca's several times. I've always thought perhaps i was missing something...why all the stellar reviews? If you've had Luca's sandwiches, and you are a fan, then you really must try one of the more superior deli's in Hoboken - namely, Vito's, Fiore's and the place on 2nd/Grand. I decided to give Luca's one more shot. I ordered the 'Little Petey' and a Meatball Parm hero. The bread is ok, but too doughy and 'raw'. I much prefer the bread that Vito's uses - it's usually more well-done and tastier. The Little Petey was just a clump of pepporoni, mozz and sundried tomatoes. I did like how the sweet tomatoes played off the spicy pepperoni, but overall, i just found it decent - nothing special. The Meatball Parm was also a-ok, but nothing to write home about. The mozz wasn't even melted, and there was a bare minimum of sauce, and no crunch to the bread. Bottom line - i've had far better sandwiches in Hoboken, and the other great Italian deli's in town are just a notch better than Luca's. I don't think i'll be back.
2011-11-11,5,I love you sweet marie and big petey. In a sea full of italian eateries, you stand out with your fresh breads and meats. Your service is speedy and you are nice guys. Good prices, good food, speedy service for lunch time runs.
2011-10-25,4,In a town so deli-obsessed that they've created their own word for mozzarella cheese ("mutz") and subsequently posted placards in every sandwich shop declaring, "We've got the best mutz," as if that was even a subject on anyone's mind in the first place, Luca Brasi's makes as strong a case for itself as any place around. The specialty sandwiches are, if not slightly more expensive than other local options, packed with fresh ingredients, fully customizable, and extremely fun to order if you came to Hoboken just to feel a little bit more Italian. "Heyyy, gimme a Big Paulie, a Big Petey, and a Johnny Roast Beef. You take credit cards? Fughettaboutit!"  For the record, all of the above are delicious. The place also has just the right amount of seating and token Godfather and Sopranos posters. A classic New Jersey corner Italian deli if there ever was one.
2011-10-19,5,Good bread, good meat, AWESOME mozz  Order a Big Petey with a side of marinated mushrooms... forgettaboutit!
2011-08-14,4,Not sure why people say it is pricey- it is 7-8 bucks for one of the specialty sandwiches and you can barely move once you are finished. I  usually go with the #2 Big Paulie (prosciutto, mozz, sundried tomatoes) and the italian tuna is also very good.
2011-08-11,3,One of the many great deli's throughout Hoboken. Our realtors come here for lunch quite a bit and leave the office with that great Luca sandwich smell! It's not the cheapest but worth it!
2011-07-22,4,Luca's is a great deli with seating, but it is a bit pricey. Everything they offer, across the board, is going to be about $1.50 more. Otherwise, their salads, sandwiches are all good and the atmosphere is lively.
2011-06-28,4,Good food for a very good price with very fast service, including very fast delivery.  There's no other place I'm aware of that is as well-rounded as this for take-out.  I've been going to this place regularly for years.  Even though there's not an Italian to be found in the joint, they have all the necessary stuff there.  My favorite is probably the chicken bruschetta sandwich (with grilled chicken as a sub).
2011-06-14,5,Easily my favorite place to eat in Hoboken.  It's just awesome.
2011-04-20,4,One of the best deli's in Hoboken.  The "Luca Brasi" sandwich (Italian tuna and Mutz) is especially good.   I have yet to have a bad sandwich from this place.
2011-04-18,4,Great sandwiches - fantastic mutz.  I always get salami with mozzarella, arugula, and balsamic. Mmm.
2011-04-15,3,i originally posted this:"i ordered a shrimp parm hero.coconut shrimp??? probably left over from last night's entrees.do i need to say any more?"but was too hasty.i called to complain and apparently it was an honest mistake.i'll give them a chance to make up for it.i'll definitely order from them again.
2011-03-30,4,This is an awasome deli to grab a quality sub or salad. They have great signature cold subs like the Big Petey, as well as fresh grilled chicken salads or delicious hot sandwiches, like their meatball parm. All the cold cuts, meats, pastas and ingredients are fresh and of good quality.  Great place for an inexpenaive lunch or dinner.
2011-03-29,3,3.5If you're not from the area or not familiar with good delis (I'm talking to you PA) you might give this a 4 or a 5 star rating.  The problem is that Hoboken is spoiled with good italian delis.  I think there are better options in town.Portions are good and the sandwiches are pretty tasty.  The tuna mozz w/ balsamic, chicken parm, and breakfast sandwiches are my favorites.
2011-03-25,4,Very consistent.Give it a try.
2011-03-18,5,Good food.  Lots of mozzarella on the sandwiches.  good prices. What's not to like?
2011-03-16,4,This place was my go-to lunch spot when I worked in Hoboken. The chicken parm and chicken bruschetta are great.
2011-03-10,5,I love this place. Granted I only order one thing but I believe they have a delicioius Chicken Cutlet Sandwich. This sandwich has roasted red peppers, balsamic vinegar, and a thick piece of mozzerela on a warm  piece of breaded chicken. Amazing. I get it every time.
2011-01-11,4,I'm kind of obsessed with the salami and mozz.  A bit on  the pricey side, but worth it.  Chicken Parm is great too!
2011-01-02,1,Pretty much the worst subs my boyfriend and I have ever ordered. We ordered grilled chicken with lettuce, onion, and tomatoes. The chicken was awful - it looked like it had been boiled or something and the cheese was those individually wrapped fake processed cheese. We tried to eat the subs by taking off the chicken, but it was no use. We threw them in the trash and ordered a pizza from benny t's. Also, it took over an hour for the food to arrive and cost $20. What a waste...
2010-12-28,4,Luca Brasi's roast beef, mutz, and gravy sandwich is good, but not as good as Fiore's and I think the italian sandwiches are better at Park & sixth.. So, why 4 stars? It's on my way home from the PATH. I stop there often to grab some mac salad, rabe, meatballs, cutlets, etc. all of the prepared food is very good. They are also a solid place to order pasta if you're getting it delivered. The portions are large and they make a pretty good vodka sauce.
2010-12-27,5,Pretty much one of the ONLY reasons my BF even treks to Boken to see me - no really!   He swears by there meatball parm.  I make my own version of the sweet marie - their mozz is off the hook!! Sandwhiches can be dry though, i always add balsamic or something to make it better. Whole wheat rolls an be harder but a nice option.  2 Sandwhiches usually run us about $17. DEELISSSHHH
2010-12-23,5,Definitely the real thing.  They don't make the cheapest sandwich in the world, but they make a damn good sandwich.  In my opinion (and I love me some sandwich) it is worth the money.  Everything is fresh, carefully selected, well prepared, and well put together.  Can the staff be a little "brusque?"  Yes, they can.  Should you not have moved to the New York Area if you can't deal with "brusque?"  Yes.
2010-11-02,2,Twice I've ordered subs from Luca Brasi's for lunch and both times I've been highly disappointed. The bread is stone hard and the meats are just meh. When I went in to pick up, however, their salads look delicious. I was swayed to try this place because of the positive reviews and also saw that it's an Editor's Pick on Kannekt - not sure who is writing these reviews!  Maybe I will give LB one more chance just for their salads and sides, but I will never order a sub from them again.
2010-10-15,3,Nothing stands out about Luca Brasi's compared to other authentic Italian delis in the neighborhood aside from the price.  EXPENSIVE!!!!  A mozzarella, proscuitto, and roasted red pepper sandwich is good but it costs close to $10.  I can get the same sandwich for several dollars cheaper elsewhere.  The egg sandwiches are good too but again, pricey.Outdoor seating is a perk.     If I were to rate Luca Brasi without comparing to other places in the neighborhood, it might get a bit higher ranking but if we put it in context, I just can't bring myself to give above an "A-OK"...
2010-09-22,5,Incredible deli.  They have a small selection of special sandwiches.  The best?  Johnny Roast Beef.  I go out of my way to take people who have never been to NYC or the surrounding area.  The sandwiches are big and absolutely delicious.  Def worth a shot and many returns
2010-09-04,4,Old school, solid Italian sandwiches.  Homemade cannolis.We shared the Big Petey, Chicken Parm and Johnny Roast Beef.  I think the Big Petey was probably the crowd favorite, but the others were good too.Get something with the Mozz.
2010-09-02,4,Love this place.Its easy, the ingredients are fresh and flavorful, the sandwiches have personality and special names, you don't have to decide and think about your own toppings. The staff is friendly. The ambiance is an off the beaten path, corner neighborhood gem in Hoboken.My sister and I have it set in our calenders to visit atleast once a month. Need I say more.
2010-09-01,5,Big, unwieldy sandwiches packed full of fresh meat and ingredients with juices dripping into the bread and all over your hands.5 stars for the flavor. Based on previous reviews, we tried both the Big Petey and Johnny Roast Beef and both lived up to the hype. Very fresh ingredients, tender meat, packed full of flavor. Really tastes NY/NJ deli authentic.  Overall rating of 4.5 just because the juices from the sandwiches make them fall apart and hard to eat. But completely worth the hassle because the sandwiches are that good. Luca Brasi's just earned two more regulars.
2010-07-22,5,this place is a gem!!! we went there last night for the first time and ordered grilled chicken wraps with fresh mozz and pesto sauce and i took one bite and was amazed!!!! i have ordered this wrap from many different places, and this was by far the best!!! 5 stars for now because i havent tried anything else!!!
2010-07-01,4,I live on the other side of the Hoboken Terminal and now work in Hoboken.  Everyday I get to experience more and more authentic Hoboken eateries off of Washington and Luca Brasi's is definitely one of them.  Great sandwiches - come hungry and expect to nap at your 2pm meeting!
2010-06-07,4,Luca's is solid. Not the best in town, but clearly a contender with some of their sandwiches. Can't go wrong with your choice of meat on some of their mozzarella. Hot sandwiches are usually the way I go here. Haven't had anything I didn't like yet. Solid tomato sauce!
2010-05-17,4,Cant go wrong with a fat stuffed sub from here. I think there might actually be to much meat on them. Its always quick and will put the price against anyone else. People say its expensive. But I go to subway for a $5 sub I get about 8 slices of meat. Here I will get close to 30. Plus the bread and meat is top quality. The only reason I didn't give it 5 start is because if I want to add Pickles and Hot peppers to my sandwich they will charge me extra.
2010-05-04,4,I have to admit... the name is what pulled me in. There are probably 10,000 delis in a 60 miles radius, but this place gets first prize in the name category.The first sandwich I had here was the Chicken Parm Hero, because I thought it was pretty Italian-sounding. The Johnny Roast Beef is also very good. I suggested they change the name to Johnny Two Times... because it's so good you'll always want to order two... or something like that. Heh... Anywho, no matter what sandwich you order you're sure to leave full and satisfied.I tried limiting my visits here (as I do anywhere that offers sandwichs piled high with deli meats), because too much of a good thing might have you sleeping with the fishes.**my apologies for a very lazy attempt to work in a classic movie reference. I wanted in and this was the best I could phrase it. At least I'm honest.
2010-04-14,5,Whenever I'm in the area and wanting quick Italian - this is one of my go-to's. Their penne vodka with sausage - so good. The portions are hearty. The subs are also something to write home about.
2010-03-15,5,This place is one of my absolute favorite places to eat in Hoboken. I lived dangerously close & have two words for you: Big Petey. Get it. It's the most heavenly sandwich- perfect crusty french bread, roasted red peppers, fresh mozz & just shaved deli turkey.  Once you eat it, you'll eat it at least once a week, or maybe that's just me? Either way, I brought my friends here a lot & we all enjoyed~!
2010-03-05,3,OH PAISANO!! It's a deli with an Italian name with mostly Hispanic workers batman!!So I have to say...wait for it.....that i love....wait for it.....the chicken parm sandwich here.....65% of the time. When it's on, it's on! One thing you definitely have to get though is an extra side of sauce since the sandwich and bread soak most of it up.However, the other 35% of the time it's a total mess, completely devoid of anything resembling flavor or any of flavor's relatives, yumminess, goodness, deliciousness, properness, satisfying.....ness.I wish they'd tell me when I'm about to order "oh by the way, tonight is that night when the sandwich will have no flavor" so that I could skip that night and have a great sammy the next time :-)
2010-02-16,4,another work favorite! their chicken salad is soooo good -- try it with their fresh mozzarella, it's very filling but delicious! sometimes they are very busy and it takes a while to get delivery, but most of the time it's speedy (and almost always correct!)
2010-01-27,5,My boyfriend and I order sandwiches from here ALL the time. They're huge, delicious, and the delivery is fast. They have the best mozzarella.
2010-01-05,4,I accidentally stumbled in here one Hoboken St Patty's Day and ever since it has become a necessary stop when I'm in town.Favorites: Johnny Roast Beef (roast beef, fresh mozzarella and au jus), Chicken Parm Hero and Tomato/ Mozzarella Salad (ridiculously sweet tomatoes).
2009-12-26,4,Being bombarded with homework, projects, and presentations, I just didn't have the time to go out for a night on the town. Therefore, I went to my old friend, Delivery.com, and off of the recommendation of 3 Italian brothers from my fraternity decided to from Luca Brasi. Nothing says classy delivery dinner than an Italian delivery dinner. I am a fan of Delivery.com as my thousands of delivery points will attest to, so any restaurant on there gets points with me. Like I said earlier, I didn't have the time to go for a sit down meal or even to go pick up my order at the corner of 2nd and Grand St. I was warned that delivery from an Italian restaurant could take up to 45 minutes; however, my order took over an hour to get to me. Also, when it got here, some of the items were cold. It was a sort of bad start to the meal, but as always, the true test lies in the food itself.For appetizers, I ordered mozzarella sticks and hot wings. Even though I had to wait over an hour for them, the mozzarella sticks were better than many of the freshly served mozzarella sticks that I've eaten in this city. The hot wings too were also good with a slight kick to them. For the main courses, I ordered spaghetti and meatballs with a chicken parmesan on the side, crab cakes with rice, and a Johnny Roastbeef Sandwich, which had roast beef, mozzarella, and gravy. Again, even though it took so long, the food was delicious. The meatballs were delicious and the fresh mozzarella was to die for. I only wish that my food was still hot and the crabmeat with rice platter was a complete mess. For desert I ordered a cannoli and tiramasu. Both of the deserts were delicious, albeit small, and the tiramisu was one of the best I've ever had.Sometimes you just don't have the time to go out for a good meal when you are being bombarded with the Stevens workload. That's why it's a great thing when the good meal can come to you. Luca Brasi's fresh mozzarella had to be the stand out component of the meal. One of the better Italian places in Hoboken, I say if it gets the thumbs up from 3 true Italians, then it's good for me. However, if your patience begins to get tested, try to remember the old saying "Good things come to those who wait."
2009-12-19,5,Best sandwiches in Hoboken. Make sure you leave time for a nap afterwards.
2009-11-23,4,My friends and I met up with some people tailgating at yesterday's Giants game (11/22/09). Their grill was not working so they had what turned out to be a great backup plan: heroes from Luca Brasi's.I started with the Italian hero which was a bit a of a disappointment. Way too bland to be called an Italian hero. An Italian hero needs a little kick. I then tried the American. Much better. Just as I was hoping for. While eating that one I noticed that the bread was quite good.From there, it was on to the cannolis. Very good with little chocolate chips in the filling.  A friend of mine said she tasted cinnamon. I'm very sensitive about cinnamon - wonderful where it belongs - like in pumpkin pie - but ruinous where it doesn't. I did not detect any at all. I think her nervousness about the prospect of her Falcons losing to the Giants impaired her taste judgment.
2009-10-25,4,I eat a Luca's sandwich at least once a week; depending on the week, I may eat there 5 times.The big petey with pepper turkey, add balsamic and mustard is my favorite sandwich. It also comes with roasted red peppers and arugula. Delicious and a little more heart healthy than the sandwiches lathered in proscioutto, pepperoni or capicola. I do eat these sandwiches on special, non diet days and they are worth it.The canoli's are great. A hidden treat here is the home cured dill pickles...as a pickle fiend, these are phenomenal.You can also get a decent bag of chips (variey of flavors) for $.99 and out the door for under $8.00; a great deal in over priced Hoboken.
2009-09-13,4,3rd best Italian Deli in Hoboken after Fiore and Lisa's Italian Deli. Great service, accepts credit cards, excellent prices, good (but not great) Mozz and I'll be back for my grilled Chicken w/ Moz at some point. Will be back at some point to explore more of their menu.
2009-09-06,5,Sometimes a person just needs a solid sandwich. Like a parm. Or a prosciutto with sweet peppers and mozz. Even a solid bacon, egg, and cheese. I really like the deli on Park and Sixth too, but this place has 2-3 small tables for outside seating, and you can't beat sitting in the sun with a giant slab of sandwich.
2009-08-26,5,Great deli with fresh, quality Italian food. Try the "Johnny Roast Beef" sandwich - fresh rare roast beef, au jus gravy and fresh sliced mozzerella. Heaven! You can sit outside and enjoy your sandwich while reading the newspaper - nice block - great for people watching in Hoboken. Don't miss it!
2009-07-14,4,Great italian sandwiches...Iv'e had the same sandwich every single time I've been there - the Fougata Boutit   its not too healthy but I love it. and I think it is reasonably priced at like 7 bucks for a BIG sammie.
2009-04-28,5,Luca Brasi's would be the 2nd best deli in Hoboken next to Fiores.  However, Luca's delivers which is a huge plus.  Ordering is also available through delivery.com.95% of everything that has been ordered or eaten from here is delicious - I will list the only exceptions:Wings (they were baked and tasted pretty bad)Johnny Roast Beef (it was only bad one time - no flavor - have had it before and it was money)Egg Plant Parm (veal and chicken parm blow this away)We have only ordered sandwiches, sides, and the above food.  Aside from the 3 items up top, everything was excellent and comes in a timely fashion.  Actually, getting the food there takes the same amount of time if you have it delivered.  Luca's comes highly recommended.  If you get a sandwich here do yourself a favor and make sure it has fresh muzz on it - no questions asked!
2009-02-02,5,We got the Super Bowl special for the game yesterday and everything was awesome.  We went looking for the right place to handle the task on Sunday morning, and even though none of us had ever eaten here, we took a risk and gave it a shot...3' italian sub, huge tray of wings and a huge tray of penne vodka for $130.Blew away every other deal in town and the food was great.If you need someone to cater a casual party in the area, they are definitley up to the task.
2008-02-18,4,Amazing Johnny Roast Beef here, and the mozzerella is, as the other reviewers have said it, amazing.  Tuna w/vinegar is decent, too, the pasta dishes so-so.Admittedly, the deli is just classic sandwiches and a bit of Italian, but if all you're looking for is a good sandwich to fill you up, this is a place to stop.
2007-11-25,1,Would rate higher but manager/owner is actually a rude guy who doesn't respect his customers.  They screwed up an order and I had to wait 15 minutes extra.  I mentioned this to the owner.  "What, you want me to fire the guy who did it?" is all he asks.  Rude.  I didn't want to wait nearly 30 minutes for steak and eggs, so he could at least offer me something to make it up.  Otherwise the food is "OK" but nothing special.  There are plenty of far better (and authentically more Italian) delis in Hoboken.
2007-08-26,4,Luca Brasi: Don Corleone, I am honored and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your daughter. And may their first child be a masculine child. and later...[Tessio brings in Luca Brasi's bulletproof vest, delivered with a fish inside]Sonny: What the hell is this?Clemenza: It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. We miss you Luca. Thankfully this Hoboken sandwich shop keeps your memory alive. The other reviewers are right on the money with their reviews - get anything as long as it's got mozzarella on it.  As for the Cannolis...[to his associate, who has killed Paulie in the car]Clemenza: Leave the gun.[pause]Clemenza: Take the cannolis. They're just OK, but I really love that quote.Wheelchair access: Straight in.
2007-02-09,5,Best mozzarella on the planet.  It's stringy, squeaky, salty, and sweet.  Combine it with some fresh basil and tomatoes in season from Sobsey's.... you won't regret it.
2006-09-28,5,The best thing about this place is their homemade fresh mozerella.  They also have great sandwiches (many with their fresh mutz) with funny names like The Big Paulie, Little Petee, and my favorite, Sweet Marie (Mozzerella, Sun Dried Tomato, Arugula).  The guys running the place are super friendly and cool.  They have some cute tables outside if you want to enjoy your sandwiches in the sun.  Though there isn't much of a view, inside or out.
