2021-07-29,5,This is my favorite Mango Mango establishment in the area. It's better than the ones in the city. Im not sure why but the mangoes are even sweeter, if thats even possible. I love the A1, Special Mango Juice Sago & Pomelo with Mango Ice Cream and the location is amazing because you can walk down to Maxwell Place Park for a breathtaking view of the city.
2021-07-10,4,Good place to come. The portions were absolutely huge. The staff was kind of lazy but other than that the dessert was good at self.
2021-07-02,3,We got a fruit flies on our to-go bag, still alive. Came back home and found it on the lid. Though it's not inside the dessert, you can still imagine there must be more in the kitchen. Understood that they have to deal with many fruits but again sanitation is important!! Hoboken or NJ should have a board to check the eatery's kitchen constantly, like NYC!! Now on the review of the desserts, one have to understand these kind of desserts are from Taiwan. And it is very popular among Asian culture specially Taiwan and Hong Kong. I think it tastes exactly like what it should be based on the two dishes I tried. It is a little more expensive than usual because I can imagine of the expensive rent and demands. However, they should be a little more generous on the size. Strawberries could be more fresh. Mango was fine. The sago was frozen. The Taro soup was good but too small for its price. I will still go and try more of their desserts. I am just happy that they are here for the Hoboken food scene. We are open for varieties here! For those who don't understand the food, try to understand from a culture point of view and you may appreciate the differences;) I need to take off two stars for the size and cleanliness. It can easily be earned back if their business care of the customers' constructive reviews!;)
2021-06-21,5,After experiencing Mango Mango in Flushing and Chinatown, I was excited to have them join the Hoboken community!  Right now they offer in-shop dining, or pick-up.  Their combos, which typically include 3 menu items, are an especially good deal.  So far I've had the mango millie crepe, mango pancake (which is not what Americans typically think of for pancakes, but instead a crepe-like film filled fluffy cream and mango), snow white mango juice with sago & pomelo with ice cream, mango juice with glutinous rice ball with ice cream, and the snow white mango slush-o -- everything was yummy, you can't go wrong! The manager was also kind and accommodating when they made an error in my order - I really appreciated the customer service. Will continue to return and try more things on the menu.
2021-06-12,5,Delicious desserts perfect for splitting with others! Nice location and very cute inside.
2021-06-10,5,Desserts are delicious. Love this place. I will recommend the mango pancakes. Must try.
2021-06-02,5,Ok, I went back here again because my friend needed a bathroom pitstop and I knew this place had a good one. LOL. Hey, we can't take these things for granted during COVID. Well we came for the bathroom but got the most delicious freakin' dessert in the universe. The only mistake we made was sharing one. We got this dish with fresh mangos, strawberries, lychee, mango ice cream, all floating in some fruit smoothie of some sort. At first my friend was going to order something else, but last minute I had a gut instinct to go for this item instead. My snack instincts are mostly on point guys. Honestly was not expecting anything crazy because its just ice cream right? WRONG. This hit the spot and it induced an involuntary happy dance which usually means its really good.Edit. Now we never share one. Every time we go back to Hoboken we go back and get one each. So so refreshing especially on a warm day!
2021-05-25,1,Overpriced and overly sweet desserts that are made with very cheap cream and require little preparation. I have no idea why they charge so much for this quality. better spend your money at a french place such as Laduree or L'atelier DU chocolate. Not coming back
2021-05-22,5,It's amazing.. Will surely visit again.. But that pink thing on dessert spoiled my mood it was too bitter.. Pancake was good mouth melting..
2021-05-06,3,The food itself is very good, however the service is slow. Given the poor service, I would not go back if my girlfriend didn't like the Taro ball & Jelly (item S9) as much as she does.
2021-05-06,5,Honestly is one of my favorite places in Hoboken for desert. Actually it is my favorite, the owner is awesome. Always shows us good customer service the mango pancakes are epic.
2021-05-03,4,Whenever we're in the area, it's usually pretty early since we try to beat the crowds at TJ's. Since Mango Mango opens at 1pm, we decided to order for delivery via Doordash instead of picking up. Unfortunately, this means no ice cream products for us! We split the Green Tea Mille Crepe Cake, the Mango Pancake, and the Mango Juice with Glutinous Rice Balls. Both the crepe cake and pancake were really good, but I think the Mango Pancake was my favorite. A thin crepe filled with delicious cream and juicy and ripe mango, it was perfect. I wish there was the ability to customize the mango juice on the app, because I for sure would've added some red bean and sago in it!
2021-05-02,5,I LOVE MANGO MANGO. An entire dessert place dedicated to my favorite fruit. It's beyond my wildest dreams come true. I ordered a few things to go to share back home and ordered their mango pancakes (super light and definitely enough to share), the special mango juice sago and pomelo with mango ice cream and their oreo crepe cake. All of them were incredible and quite large portions. We had enough to save for another day.
2021-04-14,3,The desserts from here are always solid and I've been to multiple locations so it's pretty much the same. However, this location I ordered online for pick up and when I got to the store, I had to wait an additional 15 minutes for my order and the staff weren't wearing a mask either. It was pretty messy inside the store too. Disappointing considering the pandemic.
2021-04-14,4,Cool place to chill. Vast variety of deserts, teas and treats. All items we ordered came very tasty and fresh. Service was prompt and attentive. I observed vacant tables were promptly wiped after each use which made me feel more comfortable. Perhaps putting a few chairs and tables outside will also add to an experience.
2021-03-22,4,I was in the area for dinner with a few friends and we decided to stop by for a quick dessert before leaving Hoboken. I mean there's always room for dessert after all, am I right!?We decided to split the Strawberry Mango Juice Sago & Lychee Jelly with Mango Ice Cream (~$7.50). Instead of lychee jelly, you can also choose Herbal Jelly, Rice Ball, and Red Bean - we stuck with the Lychee Jelly.We were pretty full from dinner so this was a great dessert to share. It curbed our sweet tooth and satisfied that dessert craving with the ice cream, sago, and fresh fruits.The sago was super refreshing and the lychee jelly added another "tropical" element to this dessert. I liked the mango ice cream although maybe a mango sorbet would have been more fitting?Nonetheless, if you find yourself at Mango Mango, then it must be one of your favorite fruits like it is for me. They have mango desserts in so many different ways, you can't go wrong!
2021-03-19,3,Ordered takeout from here during covid times. I love mango mango desserts, and this taro ball with herbal jelly was delicious and packed to the brim. The dessert was a 5/5 but the COVID regulation was a 3/5, there was no divider between the staff and customers and the person on duty was not wearing a mask. In the pandemic times, safety regulations are really important and it was disappointing to see this store location was not in adherence.
2021-02-28,1,I wouldn't suggest. The cakes taste like canned mango with artificial mango flavor taste.
2021-02-25,5,Love mango mango! So ecstatic to have this place in hoboken, so much closer to home. My faves are the regular mango smoothie or cantaloupe smoothie. However, I tried the coconut mango smoothie and I firmly believe it's my new ultimate fave.
2021-02-23,5,I stopped in for dessert, and it did not disappoint! Mango Mango is bright, spacious and has plenty of tables for seating. The menu is extensive, and as long as you're a fan of mango, you won't be disappointed. I opted for the dessert sampler which came with mango ice cream and lychee, a mango pudding and a mango rice ball. I also got a slice of the mango mille feuille cake. After trying 4 items, I can confidently say that Mango Mango does NOT skimp on the mango flavor. Every item was bursting with mango goodness, and I was really happy about this since lots of places tend to "water down" or "fill" the flavor. All four things I tried were light and refreshing, and I love the mango/lychee combination. Prices are extremely reasonable, and it's a great place for a treat!
2021-02-11,5,My favorite dessert place. I always get their slush-o non dairy and the mango juice with ice cream and glutinous rice balls.
2021-02-07,4,I went here on a snowy day. Icecream tastes best when it does not melt. I ordered the triple delight sundae with an extra scoop of durian and coconut icecream. Ended it up costing around 10-11$The icecream is decent. Nothing great. Service was ok. The counter was covered with boxes n cartons. I ordered a pickup order through ubereats. I would recommend this place only as there are not many icecream places in hoboken
2021-02-06,1,Workers in kitchen and front not wearing masks. Worker in front had bad attitude, also did not clean tables or sanitize. Dirty plates left on tables. Really disappointed in experience.
2021-02-06,2,Cashier had no mask and bad attitude. There were dirty dishes on all the tables and a pizza box on the main table. Food here is good but the no mask from the staff even those in the kitchen was concerning.
2020-12-20,2,Extensive desert options to choose from.. but don't expect authentic Thai flavors. We ordered 2 deserts . Mango crepe cake was as nice but crepe had a consistency that of omelette .. overall Nay!! Not a YAY!
2020-12-17,5,Came across this dessert place that delivers through doordash. I've personally never had a dessert like the mango pancake. It's a crepe filled with the largest and juiciest mango cube,  and white cream. So so delicious! The Oreo cake was very good as well, not too sweet! I can't wait to try the other items from their menu!
2020-12-01,4,I got the strawberry thingy, my boyfriend got the triple delight and our friends got some crepes (i dont have the pics). Service was great, thank you to the staff who let us stayed even though their almost about to close. They gave us free water bottles as well. I just really didnt like the dessert that i ordered, but my friend really like theirs. (SORRY FOR THE BAD GRAMMAR LMAO)
2020-11-29,2,I did like the mango pancake. But nothing else was worth going back for. Not something i would recommend to anyone who loves real mangoes.
2020-11-28,1,This was horrible I wouldn't recommend to a friend. The mango is not fresh but tastes like it's from a can and the sago was frozen.
2020-11-01,5,Did not love the mango pancakes, a bit simple for the price (its just mango with whipped cream), but we had the strawberry mango with sago and mango ice cream which was amazing.
2020-10-29,5,Really good spot, I highly recommend it. All staff is really nice and welcoming  I can't wait to go back and indulge
2020-10-25,1,Great place but no idea why the cashier is the only one in the entire establishment not wearing a mask. Unfortunately have to avoid coming here until they get there act together.
2020-10-18,5,Always amazing desserts & fast service!  Pricing could be cheaper or portion could be bigger
2020-09-03,5,We come here all the time for mango pancakes and mango crepe cakes. Ughhhh they're amaaaaazinnnnng! Never ever disappoints! The mango strawberry slush-O is a super hit too!
2020-08-26,4,Ordered pick up from here two times within a week. And I'm not even a sweets/desserts person, so that's saying a lot.Both times, we ordered the combo B (snow white mango juice with sago and pomelo with ice cream, mango juice with glutinous rice ball with ice cream and mango panna cotta). It tasted good and you get the most bang for your buck at $19.99. The mango was fresh and sweet, and the rest of the dessert was not loaded with sugar, which is why I really liked it. Normally, something soaked in what looked like a mango-y syrup would turn me off. But again, the syrup was not just liquid sugar in this case. It was actually refreshing. The mochi also had the perfect consistency to it.Next time, I think I'll try their slush!
2020-08-23,4,My husband and I came here and tried a couple of items. We ordered the Mango Juice with Rice Ball dessert, Oreo Mille Crepe and a Vanilla Strawberry Sundae. I did not try the Sundae but my husband loved it. The Oreo Mille Crepe was delicious. The Mango Juice with Rice Ball was super refreshing and the mango was the best mango I've ever tried. The rice balls weren't sweet. I expected them to taste a bit like Mochi but I guess I was wrong. Regardless, I'm glad I tried it and this place. The service was super friendly and quick. I would like to try some other items from the place!
2020-08-04,5,Delicious desserts! Green Tea Mille Crepe in particular is perfect. Wish i had noticed this place earlier. Everything is utmost quality. A welcome change of pace to the Hoboken food scene! Tasty smoothies as well.
2020-06-11,5,Very unique and amazing dessert spot. I've only tried the Mille Crepes here and they were delicious. I've had both Oreo and green tea matcha. Oreo was my favorite but green tea was also good. Highly recommend if you have a sweet tooth and looking for something sweet and delicious.
2020-06-11,5,Love this spot! Have tried the Oreo and green tea mille crepe and they taste so good. They just melt in your mouth and the flavor is not overwhelming at all. Can't wait to come back here and try their other desserts!
2020-06-10,4,I ordered delivery from this place and loved both items: the green tea crepe wrap and durian Mille crepe cake. They weren't overly too sweet, were super fluffy and creamy. I wish the durian cake were packaged better, which the green tea wrap had a strong durian flavor.
2020-05-17,4,Thanks for opening business during this time. I was so craving for lady m for months and most of dessert places are closed. Until today, I found this place just re-opened recently. The crepe cakes are fine (large portions, my hubby loves his durian crepe) and the classic ones are also very good! :) def feels like a luxury to have these days.
2020-03-14,5,I'm so glad they opened a branch here in Hoboken This is the perfect place to get an afternoon dessert and grab a pot of tea. My favorite dessert here is the Mille crepe, highly recommend giving it a try if you're ever here. There's a combo for Mille crepe and 2 pots of tea for ~$15 if you can't decide on what tea to get.
2020-03-08,5,Awesome dessert shop - mango was fresh and the Mango Mille cake was delicious - recommend stopping in!
2020-03-03,5,Finally there is a mango mango in Hoboken, so we don't need to go to Edison for dessert! Their Durian cake and pancake are both good! Must try if you like Durian! Don't worry if you don't like strong flavor. They also provide other cakes like chocolate, Oreo, green tea etc. Honestly, I think they cake is better than Lady M (just my opinion). It's not too sweet and has larger piece.I made a to go order, but the interior is good too, just like a fancy restaurant. It's a good place for friends gathering together after lunch or dinner.
2020-02-27,5,I've been here a few times and each time is consistent and so good!  I like the drinks and the combo desserts.  The mochi is filled with real mango chunks!
2020-02-23,5,Great service and yummy desert!! Plus we got free drink at grand opening!!! I love their durian banji!!!!
2020-02-23,5,A little slow... But the desserts are very good and the staff there are so nice!  Will come back again!
2020-02-20,5,SOOOO GOOOOD!Snow White Mango Slush-O!!Sometimes I like to add some sago to it too!Mix it up real good and enjoy!
2020-02-17,5,Such a great hoboken spot! This is mango and tropical dessert paradise. The ice cream desserts and crepe cakes are absolutely amazing.Price points are fair and service is good as well. 5 stars
2020-02-08,5,Yum desserts and drinks...awesome ambience..mangoes taste like fresh and yum..would highly recommend this place for all mango lovers..snow mango slush was yummm..
2020-02-05,4,Lovely Asian dessert based where EVERYTHING is made from MANGO!The desserts are nice in that they are not overwhelmingly sweet.  I had the Mango dessert with glutinous rice balls and grass jelly (my fav!) on top of a mango sorbet with fresh cut mangos, it was amazing!  Refreshing, and not too sweet!I also go their herbal tea, which is supposed to have various healing benefits and etc.  It was a tad too sweet for my preference but maybe next time I'll ask for some hot water to tone it down.The menu, while solely based on mango has a LOT of options.  If you are a Mango lover, this is your joint.Overall, I am very impressed and would definitely come back!
2020-01-31,5,Very good! Wanted to try this spot since they opened and decided I'd get some work done and enjoy some sweet mango treats. I tried the mango platter- perfect combo with a little of everything. I really liked the mochi and the jelly with mango ice cream. Also tried the rice balls with mango and mango juice. Everything was flavorful, fresh and priced reasonably. I love how relaxing the space is as they have plenty of tables. I couldn't find an outlet but the waitress did offer a WiFi code which I didn't need as I have a personal hotspot, but was very nice. There were a lot of people picking up either to-go or for delivery. Great place! Highly recommend and looking forward to trying new things.
2020-01-31,5,LOVE that they're finally near me!! I don't have to go to Edison air Chinatown any longer :) go to is snow white- the drink and the dessert
2020-01-19,5,Awesome services. Staffs are super friendly there. We finally have a good dessert place in jersey. Love it!
2020-01-15,5,Absolute welcome addition to Hoboken!  The staff is so friendly.  The desserts that we had were delicious.  Every bite of mango was perfectly ripe.  The jasmine green tea was a nice complement to the sweet desserts. Highly recommend!
2020-01-13,5,I am sooo happy this place is in Hoboken. We truly don't have any good cafe/dessert places. I've been twice and already had a bunch of stuff because this place is very addictive. Oreo crepe cake - amazing!!! Mango crepe cake - amazing! Matcha crepe cake - good but not as good as the first two.Mango dessert platter - love! Best mochi I have ever had. Mango smoothie - delicious and not too sweet which rarely happens with fruit smoothies. Waffles with ice cream (I didn't have it but was told it's amazing as well)
2020-01-10,5,Stopped by earlier today, and the staff was extremely friendly!  A few people dining in, and the desserts were great.  Will return again!
2020-01-04,5,Delicious! I had the triple sundae and it was phenomenal. Prices are well worth it. What a nice treat! I will be back.
2019-12-28,5,So glad this chain finally opened in Hoboken. We just noticed it when walking by with the kids. We've gone to their locations in NY and Philly, and this one hits the spot if you want Asian shaved ice, puddings, and desserts.
