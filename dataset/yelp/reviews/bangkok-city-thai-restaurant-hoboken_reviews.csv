2021-09-08,1,Ordered a green curry chicken and it was disgusting. Watery and with a strong odor other than curry. Had to throw the hole thing in the garbage. I do not recommend this place at all. When I went to pick up my food the place was empty like at 7:30pm on a busy street. That should tell you something. Avoid at all cost. That's free advice.
2021-08-09,5,Absolutely delicious, authentic Thai food. One of the best Tom Yum soups I've had in the tri-state area!
2021-07-07,1,If you like food with no flavor this is your place! Don't bother. Just no flavor. Tries to make up the lack of flavor with chilies.
2021-04-30,4,We decided to get some Thai food but we wanted a place with alcohol . So we found this one that had Thai beer :) When I called to make a reservation the person on the phone wasn't very pleasant so I wasn't expecting much , but when we got there the Hostess / waitress was really friendly and helpful . I asked if I could sit outside but there was a possibility of rain so she said no problem and opened the cover for me .The food was really good , could have been served a little warmer but it was good  And we got served right the way . I'd like to go back and try some other things on the menu .
2021-03-12,2,Friendly service. I tried their chive dumplings, they were yummy but too greasy. Unfortunately they don't have vegetarian meat/duck options like many other Thai restaurant do.
2021-03-05,1,Please do not go here... we were hungry and wanted some Thai food. We walked in, sat down. The lady taking our orders was an older lady and she was wearing a mask. Then the lady that brought us our food DID NOT have a mask on! That's right. All she had on was a face shield. Her whole mouth was out. It was disturbing. I couldn't even eat my food. She would lift her face shield up when she was in the back of the restaurant as if covid can only be infected in the front of the restaurant. If you care about your health and if you believe this pandemic and covid is real.... DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. As for the food, it was mediocre. The Tom kha soup was watery, drunken noodles weren't seasoned enough, the Thai iced tea was all milk and no tea. It was just as overall terrible experience.
2020-10-28,1,This place is simply terrible. Do not order food from here if you want to save your stomach money and appetite.I got panang curry from here and it tasted terrible. The chicken was old and I ended up getting food poisoning next day.Worst food place I ever went to.
2020-08-26,3,It's been hit or miss with me. I've had this spot a few times now and it's just not as consistent as I would have hoped
2020-06-26,1,This place is gross. I can't believe there are 4 and 5 star reviews. We are huge Thai Food people! We all had Pad Thai with a few other dishes here, and it was terrible. We'll never go back.
2020-06-02,3,Lets start with the best attribute of this place.The young female server was very nice and helpfully.There was an older lady who kept yelling - I think she owned the place.There are better places to go to in Hoboken.The food is average at best.The Pad Thai is fineCurry is fineSome non-Thai dishes - all Good:Dumplings are Chinese foodThe empanadas are Mexican foodThere was a rice ball - I think that is from Central America So if your friends don't like Thai food, this is the place you should go to.
2020-05-30,1,I ordered the food thought GH. They delivered the wrong dish. So I contacted GH for refund.After that, the lady from the Bangkok city Thai restaurant called and YELLED at me that"why did you contacted to GH? That was your mistake. Anyway it's okay I can get the payment from GH"That was a terrible experience and I don't recommend this place.She shouldn't yell at me....Insane....
2020-05-30,4,Fantastic food! Great people, and very pleasant restaurant. The environment, and pricing were also a very happy discovery!
2020-05-08,5,Quick delivery and good food. I got the pad Thai and the spring rolls, fried rice, also some pad sew. So yummy! The pad Thai was the perfect taste- sometimes it can taste funky from some places. Great portion sizes for price! We ate leftovers for a couple of days...!
2020-04-04,5,Thank you for another delicious meal. Even in the current disruptions they delivered in good time. My Thai van in NYC is always a hard beat, but in Hoboken this really is the best of them (and yes, I've tried them all many times!). I had the Panang chicken (and they always add my pineapple extra request) , coconut rice. Devine. Phad Thai is the best here. I've been in a couple of times to pick up / for lunch special and they are the sweetest. I wrote his review because my hard to please hubby, disappointed the curry houses has closed, raved about the food.
2020-02-29,1,We ordered takeout for two but half the items were mediocre and the rest was terrible. The green curry with beef was literally the worst I've ever had, the green curry gravy was spicy yet without any flavor at all. That might sound strange but me and my partner both felt the same. We didn't even eat more than one quarter of it. The chicken skewers were also very dry. For a Thai restaurant to screw up green curry is extremely unprofessional. Also all the main stir fry dishes needed more vegetables. The only good thing was that the portions are big but that is wasted if they taste terrible.
2020-02-10,1,Pad Thai so bad that I've lost my appetite. I feel physically sick and I've gagged twice since typing this. Somehow they have good reviews on DoorDash and I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai. Im asking for a full refund as I'm writing this. It's clear they don't care at all about good quality.
2020-01-29,1,I ordered Pad Thai from here on Door Dash. There was clearly a rotten ingredient, probably something peanut-related. It was absolutely inedible and disgusting. I truly have never had a worse dish from any restaurant. I wish I checked the Yelp first, apparently another reviewer had the same dish and got food poisoning. Luckily I only ate a bite before discarding.
2020-01-19,1,Beware, This place is not clean and food tastes stale. I got food poisoning and threw up twice after leaving the place. I ordered Red curry and pad thai,  but could not eat more than a few bites of either, due to the stale stench. Please avoid if you can
2019-11-18,5,Great place. It's opened by a daughter and mom. Both of them are running the whole restaurant by themselves. Traditional and homemade style dishes. Careful for picking spicy food. When they mean spicy, they really mean spicy. So choose your food carefully. Ask before order
2019-10-26,5,I had the chicken with cashews. Excellent. One of the best dishes I have had in my short lifetime. Phenomenal meal. Highly recommend, especially if you want some spice!
2019-07-25,2,I was really looking forward to this place but unfortunately I'm never going to return after this visit. I ordered the Pad Thai, a staple dish everyone knows about. I was hopeful for a delicious plate, and alas my plate comes out and my first bite consisted of completely raw chicken. I honestly couldn't believe it, so I kept chewing to see maybe if it was just really chewy, but I looked back down to my plate and the rest of the chicken in my dish was raw as well. I kindly told the lady serving us and she took it back and cooked it for me, but by that point I had lost my appetite and didn't enjoy the cooked meal that came back out at all. I got sick to my stomach after leaving the restaurant. The two stars are only because she was kind towards the end and I do appreciate the effort to fix the mistake, but raw meat is something that should never leave a kitchen, customers can easily get sick the way I did.
2019-06-07,5,I seriously am so upset that I havent written a review for this place yet! I've been going here with my friends as our go to thai place for nearly 6 years! The food is authentic, its dimly lit and comfortable. My go To's are their papaya salad, pad thai of course, and their curry! I have tried the crab meat fried rice as well and it's delicious and filled with crab meat!  I especially love the waiters and the cook! They're sweet, helpful, and fast with their service. I will always go back from time and time again for their shrimp pad thai, and thai iced tea. Inexpensive, affordable and great quality food! Thank you for all the years serving me and my girls our favorite pad thai!
2019-03-31,5,I've been a regular patron of Bangkok City for all of the 25 years I've lived in Hoboken. In addition to enjoying reliably good food and service, it's been a joy to watch some of the staff literally grow up.Sisi, the hands-on owner, has always been gracious and charming, be it for one table, or an entire restaurant of Asian bus tourists; who stop there pre-arranged for a treat "from home" while on an American vacation.My late husband and I dined at BC at least once a week, and became close to the staff members, who are all relatives or dear friends of Sisi's. Mistakes and disagreements can happen in any business (I'm airline, so I know ALL too well), but I'm baffled by the horrible reviews on this site. I'm guessing these are half-baked reviews.I've brought SO many friends and acquaintances to BC, and they are now all regulars too.In addition to great, homemade food, excellent  service, and a comfortable ambience, I'd say the star of this place is the ever affable server, a niece of the owner is the star of the show! Gee is beautiful, bright, kind, full of humor and truly loves her family's five establishment.
2019-03-21,5,I've been coming to this restaurant for over 20 years. It has character the staff is always friendly, and the food never disappoints. My favorite dishes are the Volcano Chicken, Panang Curry Chicken, and I just recently had the Crispy Squid (AMAZING). Appetizers are great too, I usually grab some sushi or any of the SateÃÅs with the delicious dipping sauces.
2019-02-08,5,I tried this place recently just for a take out and the food was delicious!!! I got the panang curry and the shrimp fried rice and they were both VERY good. We also got the steamed dumplings which were also great. The food was well prepared and hot and the staff was very friendly. I was so happy with it that I went back tonight for dinning in. Again everything was DELICIOUS, hot and the staff was very very helpful and friendly. Not sure what the other reviews are about. I'd highly recommend the place! I will most certainly be back!
2019-01-13,4,Very cozy vibe and great customer service. The food was amazing with great quality and price.
2019-01-04,3,I was excited to try this place because I have yet to find a Thai place in Hoboken that's really amazing, but I was disappointed. The staff was friendly and we didn't have to wait long for our food. The decor is perfectly fine, but the food was just ok. I ordered the Thai Basil dish, and it was super greasy and drenched in garlic. My boyfriend got the Pad Thai, and also wasn't very impressed. Probably wouldn't try again, though I've heard good things about their lunch menu.
2019-01-03,2,Went here for lunch. The waitress seemed like she had a chip on her shoulder. Service was less than mediocre. We had pad Thai and fried rice. The food was ok. Nothing special. My wife's glass had lipstick on it. Last but not least we ordered off  the lunch menu and where charged full price.
2018-12-31,3,14 years ago, my husband and I considered this place "our place." Lots of fond memories of us and our son, a toddler at the time. So when we came to visit yesterday, with our son, now 18 years old, we just had to come and reminisce. When we got there I did not recognize any of the workers. I suspect new owners perhaps? An older woman sat us down. I asked if they had Summer rolls as that is the only Thai thing my 6 yr old will eat. "No, that's Vietnamese."  I say, "Ok, do you serve mint with your Spring rolls? "No, thats Vietnames, we dont serve mint here." Funny, I'm a Thai food fanatic and never experienced anyone telling me that, but okay whatever. Fast forward 20 minutes, woman comes out again and said, "Sorry, we don't have spring rolls yet, do you want dumplings or empanada?" I was about to snap back and say, "Dumplings is Chinese and empanadas are certainly NOT Thai!" But I digress. Don't want any funny stuff to happen to my food before it comes out. The food took soooo long to come, it was quite irritating. When the pad thai came, it was delish. They then brought us our platter crab fried rice. It was huge! Then we were brought another platter! Then 2 more! We refused the last two! She told us we ordered 4. We ordered 4 regular rice. As a server at a restaurant, wouldnt you question 4 big ass platters of fried rice in addition to all the other food we got? If it's a little odd, ask us to make sure. Thankfully they didnt give us a lot of trouble with that, but come on now. We ended up getting the Thai dumplings and empanadas (Lol), because we were so hungry we just wanted food!! It was surprisingly good! Im sadden at the service here, especially after boosting about it for 14 years. Things change, I get it. Ill leave my nostalgic memories as my memories. I do want to say though that the food was as tasty as I remembered. The younger lady who served us later was so much nicer and she should be the one out there taking the orders.
2018-12-19,1,Probably the worst Thai food I have had in years if not ever..   I am also somewhat pissed that yelp makes you at least give one star rating which this place does not deserve    You get what you pay for
2018-09-30,5,5/5 for the Garee-puffs (2) we tried today at the hoboken arts and music street festival. Bangkok had a small cart setup and these were really good! Crispy shell with potato and chicken inside dipping sweet plum sauce on the side! Glad we tried- not sure what other food is like or dining in/delivery.
2018-09-06,5,Crab Fried Rice! Enough said!  Also had the Pad Thai. Can't stop thinking about the Crab Fried Rice though. I would move across the country for it.
2018-08-25,5,Literally the best authentic Thai I've ever had on the East Coast. Great service with good pricing. The thai coconut curry had the perfect kick and the honey duck was so tender and juicy with a crispy fried it layer.  Ordered 5 items off the menu and not one thing disappointed. The one thing I regretted about our selections... not saving room for the mango and sticky rice dessert. Found a new favorite restaurant in Hoboken.
2018-08-25,2,If it's an older lady cooking and serving- I was disappointed. Small food portions and was not worth it. Food not hot. But the last 2 times I went prior to this time, if it's a young lady doing the job. She made the food delicious and wow!! Depends who is cooking.
2018-08-01,4,I stopped in here late on a weekday evening with a group of hungry and tired colleagues and we were the only customers so needless to say the service was extra attentive. We ordered a raft of appetizers and enjoyed most of them - there was one I've forgotten already, crab something, which was too salty to eat, but the crispy noodles and satay were very good. I ordered shrimp pad thai - extra saucy - and it was very good. It didn't have all the toppings I might have expected in any great abundance but the shrimp was ample and it was a large portion. My colleagues ordered various curries and were happy with their meals. We were also very happy they had a liquor license and I had a bottle of cold sake while they shared a bottle of wine. For what we needed that night, this was just right as a meal.
2018-07-15,3,It's a pretty standard Thai place. I'm glad they have vegetarian options. I ordered mixed vegetable soup with coconut milk. It's a mix of sour and fresh flavor.
2018-06-04,3,Most reviews for Bangkok City Thai is fairly true in all aspects; either you love this place or not. They have a good deal for lunch and portions are huuuuuge! It felt like a home cooked meal that grandma made (good flavor), which is a good thing. The downside was that the food wasn't hot. I didn't mind but to others it might be a big deal. Service was okay. I'm not so sure if I would come back, though.
2018-05-16,4,Best Thai in Hoboken!  Great noodles and curries!  The app's are a bit lacking so 4 stars.
2018-04-13,5,Love love love this place. It always accommodates my gluten allergy and nothing can be better than that. Their food tastes amazing and authentic. The menu is expansive and you can order almost anything gluten free, which is not something most Asian cuisines can offer!
2018-03-08,5,At first you might be confused with the mediocre look of the restaurant, but delicious food is what you will walk out with. Excellent service and food served on point as per request. Must Have:Tom Kha Soup - Spice it up to your taste buds Panang Curry with Jasmine Rice
2018-01-08,5,My go to Thai restaurant pad Thai and Thai fried rice with a side of plum sauce is a must!
2017-12-27,5,This is a great tai place. Amazing atmosphere the lighting is cozy makes you feel right at home, they have awesome art on the wall from Thailand which makes the experience even more delightful. the staff is so friendly and attentive. The food definitely delicious  i willCome here again since I live close by probably as much as I can. Great place to bring family and friends.
2017-11-25,5,I don't understand the 3 stars.   We come here almost weekly and the service and food is always consistently good. The Thai egg rolls are amazing and I'm pretty much addicted to chicken and cashews.    Husband mixes it up and has yet had a bad dish.   Highly recommend.   Low key place with great food and service.
2017-11-05,2,Order delivery last night. Will never deal with it. Reasons:1 charged for beverage that we have never ordered and delivered2 charged for taxes on a slip showing no name nor date3 the receipt bears no name nor any specifics of the shop 4 food is horrible - lot of msg and definitely not worth the dollar
2017-10-21,5,best thai place in hoboken. good lunch specials on the weekdays 12-3pm. ive always had the same server and she consistently gives food service.food is good too - highly recommend the coconut milk chicken soup (tom gai kai)
2017-10-21,5,I have tried five other thai places in Hoboken. This is the only one that tasted great!
2017-10-06,4,I really like the food, it's great thai food.  Not a fan of eating in the restaurant though, not great ambiance.  But the food is worth ordering
2017-08-28,4,Service was amazing! The food was a little pricy but the waitress answered our questions regarding transportation and kindly investigated some things for us before we took off. Food was very savory and I recommend it to anyone in the area.
2017-08-12,5,The chef does an amazing job to please her customers. I had the black noodle and a Thai iced tea; some of the most authentic flavors in town. I work across the street and always feel welcome to their lunch buffet. Great deal in Hoboken.
2017-08-11,1,This is the worst phone call I ever make. Very bad attitude. I haven't finish my order and the person are so rush to hang me up. Made me doesn't want to order it any more.
2017-07-19,1,Awful service. Don't go there if you have any kind of allergies. They have a language barrier and may end up causing issues. The service was slow and the food was blah
2017-07-12,3,Ordered seamless delivery. It came fast and it stayed hot which is a plus. The food was average - we ordered lamb with chili paste and basil and chicken with broccoli. The lamb was over cooked and served in large pieces needing a knife to cut but the flavors were good. Probably wont order again though - T-Thai is way better.
2017-06-23,1,Came here for lunch take out, horrible customer services. First they tried to sell us cold random take out food. After talking a while, she allowed me to order hot food. My friend ordered a salad, the lady said to her cash only because her salad is less than $10.  When my friend gave her a $20 bill, the mean lady said don't you have a smaller bill?  I ordered food from lunch menu, the mean lady charged me from the regular menu. When I asked, she said next time I need to tell her.  I mumbled next time I won't come again. She charged me for the smaller amount and said she would void the larger amount later.  I insisted her voiding the charge in front of me, she gave me a face of disgust.  Food took a long time to be ready.  Horrible attitude! I don't know they did it on purpose, other reviewer said it has no taste but my Pad Thai requires 5 cup of water to dilute it down the saltiness.  Or the ladies just don't hate us so much to add more salt to our food.
2017-06-05,1,Bump into this joint around 2pm one day where they sold me left over buffet food. It was not bad for the price. Ordered 4 dishes today. WOW. What a let down!!! Drunken noodles looks like boiled flat noodles with broccoli- SERIOUSLY- GROSS! The chic with basil sauce was tasty BUT REALLY WATERED DOWN with OIL ON TOP.  Not ordering ever again. I even gave the delivery lady who was so OVER her job a good tip -- NOT EVEN A THANK YOU. Ridiculous!!!!
2017-04-30,5,Amazing service dinning in and very fast delivery! Pad Thai is great but flavor can be a tad inconsistent. Absolutely love the fried tofu appetizer. Wine is drinkable, lunch special is a great deal. Highly recommend this place ! Most authentic Thai food in Hoboken !
2017-03-24,5,I don't get the negative reviews. If you look at the reviews, people seem to love it or hate it.  This is my favorite Thai Restaurant in Hoboken. I've been coming here since 2006 and I always seem to have a great experience. Compared to other places, I really enjoy Bangkok City's Pad Thai dish but also recommend trying the various curry dishes. This place is incredible for express lunch specials. When I work from home, I stop by for 2 entrees with a side and rice for less than $10 bucks. The portions are large and I end up eating it over 2-3 days. Great service and great food!
2017-02-19,1,I once caught my boyfriend eating cardboard and even he won't go back here. I heard about the bad reviews but figured that it's hard to mess up pad thai. While it may be hard, this place manages it. Not only was it awful but I didn't feel like the place was that clean when I was in it. This is one of the few places in Hoboken I cannot go back to.
2017-02-17,3,Ordered delivery from here and although the food came in a timely manner the food wasn't anything special.The drunken noodles had a good kick but the chicken was dry and the noodles werent chewy and soft like you would expect from this type of noodle.The wings were oily but had good flavor. Due to the oily texture the wings werent as crunchy as they should be. The sauce that came with them complimented them well.  Not the best chicken wing you wil have but not terrible. The best thing we tried were the spring rolls which were well made.
2016-10-18,2,Not many Thai restaurants in Hoboken and this one is the most convenient. I got the Gai Orange chicken entree. It's supposed to be fried but it was fried to the point where you could tell it was overcooked. I had to throw a lot of the chili powder to try and mask the taste. I didn't like the fact that you had to order rice separately as well. All in all, that was the cheapest chicken entree and with the rice still came out to be about 13 bucks which is really pricey, even for Hoboken.  The portion size and service was good though.
2016-10-11,1,Disgusting! Just ordered Drunken Noodles for my boyfriend and I. We picked it up, when we got home we were so disappointed. The noodles were soggy and mushy to the point where they stuck together. The chicken was bland, and the vegetables were barely cooked. Oh also, drunken noodles mean they are soaked in soy sauce.. no soy sauce in my dish just plain old white noodles. It looks like it was minimally prepared and tasted like it too. Never coming back here
2016-09-13,1,OMG, I just had the worst Thai food I've ever had. Chicken Sate was so dry I would guess that it was recooked 3 or 4 times. Complete garbage, DO NOT EAT THIS FOODPad Thai w/shrimp disgusting and I love Thai food.Try Sri Thai instead...
2016-09-06,5,The soft shell crab is amazing! Get it with the coconut rice.
2016-08-27,4,I wanted to try the food at Bangkok City since I moved to Hoboken 6 years ago.  It did not disappoint. Spicy chicken and basil dish not at all fattening. Wine. The restaurant is around for thirty years in Hoboken so that says something.   I enjoyed and will go back
2016-08-26,4,We were planning to eat on the Pier, when we saw this place and decided to try it. It was delicious! The Pad Thai was great and my FianceÃÅ ate the Orange Chicken and coconut rice, to die for! Two thumbs up for Thai
2016-08-14,5,Don't go off the three-star reviews! We had coconut soup and chicken pad Thai, and both were phenomenal. Service was fast and great. The chef is an elderly lady - you're literally eating grandma's cooking, and you won't be disappointed. I will definitely be coming back here again.
2016-07-27,1,Disgusting food served too hot to be edible in an attempt to hide poor quality meat and undercooked potatoes. Never eat here.
2016-06-26,4,We had our first date there, and we got engaged there. Both times the service was excellent!
2016-06-06,5,Ordered delivery through seamless on a Sunday evening. It arrived to jersey city within an hour and I was impressed! Ordered the chicken pad Thai with hot sauce on the side along with the Mango/Sticky rice. Love it so much, I'll definitely will be ordering again!
2016-05-31,5,The papaya salad, coconut rice, and sticky mango rice were all delicious. The service is excellent- the ladies working there are genuinely kind and accommodating. The prices were very reasonable. I eat a lot of Thai food; this place totally holds up.
2016-03-05,5,Very authentic Thai food that tasted absolutely incredible. One of the best meals on my trip. The waitress was very sweet and welcoming. Definitely worth a visit.
2016-02-24,5,Superb Thai food! I had the Nua Ma Nau Sirloin Beef Entree and it was the most tasty meal I have had in a long while. If you like beef and spice. I recommend this dish. My mouth is watering just thinking of it.Great food! Great service! Great ambiance!
2016-02-20,1,45 bucks, and a date wasted. We sent everything back with all due respect. Curry was not soaked in veggies well. They billed us anyways and didnt agree that they can make bad food. They neither informed it to chef, as we had requested..They just microwave premade stuff, toss it and throw. How difficult is it to make thai curry?
2016-02-16,4,The food here was pretty good with good portions. We got the pad Thai and the orange chicken dish. Very tasty! The food came out hot and quick. However, there was no heat on in the restaurant! It was freezing! I would probably come back again.... When it's warmer.
2016-02-01,5,I really like this place.  It is indeed a pricey restaurant since it's in Hoboken but the food is bomb. It is the best to go here when the weather is nice especially around the summer since you can sit outside. I'm not a huge fan of duck but they do duck right in this place. The coconut rice is great to pair with any of the food in the menu and the Thai iced coffee is a perfect drink!Customer service is good. Definitely will be back to this place again to try out more dishes.
2015-12-22,1,Never again.  Dry Chicken Pad Thai with no taste/sauce.  Chicken was tough and tasteless, too.  Ordered the Drunken Noodles and that was really no better.  Best was the Fried Tofu appetizer but the Peanut Sauce was really nothing more than whole peanuts with a bit of water/oil!Awful restaurant...Too many other choices around to bother giving this joint another chance.
2015-12-06,5,At a restaurant , all I seek is peace and great food , and that was what I exactly got from this restaurant . I felt at home and filled with such warmth and became instantly fantasized of what I was about to get myself into. I sat down and automatically was handed the menu which I liked because I was really hungry and wanted to eat . I was craving fried calamari and they HAD IT !!! I was super excited because I enjoy fresh calamari . I ordered three orders for myself and my boyfriend . We wanted it as an appetizer . Soon after I ordered orange chicken with some sauce and sticky rice which tasted fascinating . Since I enjoy coconut they had fresh young coconut , and I drank the juice off the coconut as it was served which was interesting . Upon leaving the check wasn't bad at all and I got to take the coconut home and ate it on my way out . The city is also great , many places to go to as well .
2015-11-03,1,I'm surprised that the place managed to get 3 stars on average. Stopped by for lunch and opted for the express lunch. Had the fried rice, red curry chicken and the fish. The chicken and fish were too hard and stale, probably cooked a few days ago. The food was also too salty. I almost walked out without eating. Don't waste your money or time at this establishment.
2015-10-13,4,I really like this place as the food is fresh, and prices are reasonable based on food quality, and portion size. I absolutely LOVE the Goong Khing (shrimp with ginger, scallions, mushrooms, bell peppers). I get this about once a week via takeout. I am a huge fan of ginger, and they don't skimp here. I'm only giving them 4 stars vs 5 because a few of the dishes with "mixed vegetables" I've had are too heavy on the Chinese broccoli (or Chinese kale), wishing they would mix it up! But I will continue to be a regular here.
2015-10-09,1,I usually enjoy Bangkok City, but my recent experience with them on Seamless was Meh, but I gave them Eek! Methinks not. Why? I ordered a meal for my family along with 2 coconut ice creams. It was on the website as being available. I order and receive an immediate call saying they don't have the fjdkfdj (jumbled words) ice cream. Okay.... I'm going to assume they don't have the coconut ice cream, but they ask me "would I like dkfdk Mango or dkfjdlfj dfjkdk?" "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that," I say (as I am trying to remember what was on the menu for dessert) The lady starts talking loudly "DO YOU WANT THE DFKJDLKF MANDFODI custard?" I hear, so I say, "Mango ice cream?" "NO WE DON'T HAVE MANGO ICE CREAM. DO YOU WANT THE DKFJ MANGO" "I'm so sorry I can't hear you." She loudly repeats mumbo jumbo and I am just more confused.... wishing she'd just throw me a bone. So trying to get back on the internet and menu I ask for Mango sticky rice - nope, not a choice, but I am reminded I can order the FHDFKFDGH! Finally I just say "Uh, yeah, can I get that and the custard?" "No, too much dfjkjdk" "I'm sorry, can you please pull the phone away from your mouth?" I say. Again, I am yelled at in English that is being spoken into the receiver as a child would hold a microphone to their face.  Finally I realize she's saying "No, you can only order one! If you order two, too much money"  "Well, then can I not order dessert?" "No, you lose money!" Ok...but if I order one I still lose $3, but if I order two desserts they lose $2. "Ok, can I just cancel my order?" Nope, not a choice, gotta go on Seamless and I still have a hungry family..... So I order one dessert and lose $3, which isn't a lot, but on the principle, I won't be eating here again. I hope the extra $3 and bad review is worth it to them. There are so many choices in Hoboken and Jersey City. I'll be ordering and dining elsewhere.
2015-09-26,4,If you take a look at my Yelp page, you'd see that I'm quite the critic--I have a tendency to report the bad and ugly, rather than the good. I've been coming to Bangkok City Thai on Washington St since 2008 and I've never been disappointed. If you can not handle the spice, communicate that to the waitress (or the person you're talking to over the phone). The preparation + quality + service = A+Recently, I've been addicted to the following dish: Gai Priew-Wan - $12.95 #IfYouDon'tKnowNowYouKnow #CheatMealIt's sauteed chicken with pineapple and mushrooms in a sweet and sour sauce & served with white rice. The chicken is always juicy and tender. Their lunch deal is an incredible way to try something new--great portions.
2015-09-20,4,I don't know why the bad reviews. Customer service was good and efficient. Food didn't take long at all. Food portions were good and food was tasty. Won't give it a 5 stars because it's more expensive than T-Thai right next door. I would differently give it another shot. Green curry has a nice kick it it. I love spicy food. Try it you will like it ;)
2015-09-17,5,Best and most authentic Thai food and service in Hudson County and possibly all of New Jersey. The Pad See Ew was amazing, as was the satay and both the red & green curry. The Thai iced tea and Thai beer were cold and tasty. The waitress named Aw (or Awesome as she liked to be referred to) was attentive & polite and made some excellent food suggestions (Thanks Awsome!). Bring your friends. Highly recommended.
2015-08-28,2,I was looking for a nice place to share a lunch date with my dad this week. We were in the mood for Thai and he mentioned this spot as a place of interest he never got to try! While the service was good with a waitress that checked in on us often, the food was underwhelming. We had overcooked pork dumplings and Pad Thai that was dry with meat that was hard and lacked flavor. Don't plan on returning!
2015-08-26,2,Disappointed...... Good, prompt, friendly service, but should have taken the overcooked meat in the dumplings as a warning...got the Kang Kua Pork ( sweet and sour yellow curry w/ pineapple) and my daughter the Pork Pad Thai.... The meat was extremely overcooked, hard and dry, almost like biting into a piece of hard rubber....the Pad Thai without the overcooked Pork was just ok, nothing to write home about..just my opinion, know it won't change the world, but I, personally, won't be back....
2015-08-17,4,Got the Pad Thai (which comes with chicken) and my sister got the Red Curry!! Pad Thai: soft noodles but not so much so that it's soggy, tender chicken, everything is incorporated so you get a bite of everything Red Curry: everything is nicely seasoned and very accommodating for those of you who can't take the heat, tender chicken TLDR; Other pros: GREAT SERVICE! Cons: wish the curry was creamier - it's kind of runny
2015-08-13,2,How can a Thai place run out of papaya salad?!? I was so disappointed because I was craving it and that's the reason we went. The service was good, although the server we pushing us to order more, I've been a server so I know she is just doing her job. The food was just OK, it didn't knock our socks off. I probably won't go back, with so many options in Hoboken I'd rather go next door to The Cuban ;)
2015-08-02,3,We sat outside on a satueday night for late dinner. It wasn't too crowded. I like the chives pan fried dumplings, serving was 3 pcs. But, the food didn't look very appetizing because the of the color. Bith entrees, fried rice and drunken noodles came out white. Usually thai food is darker because of soy sauce in guess but white colored noodles just looked off. The taste was average. Overall, okay, nothing for me to crave for this place again
2015-07-28,1,Sri Thai is the best Thai in Hoboken but they're closed on Tuesdays so craving some Thai, I decided to finally try Bangkok City. Unfortunately, it was some of the worst Thai I've ever eaten.The pad thai was tasteless and dry. I got some peanut sauce on the side to try to fix the issue, but the peanut sauce had a very off taste and was inedible. While the Massaman curry was decent, it wasn't enough to make me ever want to go back to Bangkok City.
2015-07-20,1,Ruined Saturday night dinner with family. 2 out of 5 dishes ordered are messed up.Mistakes do happen and the worst part is when the management in not even decent enough to apologize.
2015-07-20,1,The worst dining experience so far . Visited the restaurant with a bunch of friends and all of us came out disappointed.The basil fried rice turned up without any basil in it & the vegetarian drunken noodles was served with chicken pieces. Extremely hostile and rude management. Its the last time i would be visiting this place.
2015-07-18,1,When you serve chicken in a vegetarian dish , not in one but two of them . Would u even dare to step into the restaurant? Rude management ,pathetic service. Am giving this rating coz there is nothing lower than this .Never again!
2015-06-22,1,There was eggshell in the already disgusting Pad Thai they served me. Frozen Pad Thai from the grocery store is better. If it hadn't been takeout, I would have asked for my money back.
2015-05-28,1,I've walked back Bangkok almost everyday for 3 years. Finally decided to try it despite the mixed reviews. The service was fine, no one ever came back to check on us. We sat outside so cannot comment on the decor but the place in general looks older.  Everything about my pad Thai was bland and lacked flavor. The worst part came when I was almost done with my meal discovered a long black hair in my food. Gross. Won't be coming back here. If you do make the mistake of coming here, make sure you sit outside, the live music at the Cuban was awesome!
2015-03-29,4,Good simple decently priced place for tasty Thai food. Great for a date or a small get together. Also you have to try their Thai iced tea with Baileys!
2015-03-29,1,I ordered chicken with peanut sauce. The quality was very poor and must have been kind of a pre fixed sauce. Something tasted really weird and I found calamari meat between the chicken and I hate seafood. No one came and asked me if everything was ok during my lunch. And the restaurant was almost empty
2015-03-04,1,Horrible food.  Waste of money.  Chicken is weeks old. Not authentic.  Mice infested place.  The owner was rude and didn't care. Don't eat there during lunch too.  Not fresh and left there all day pretending to be a buffet.  Beware.  Don't even try.  This place is doomed.  Owner is foolish to keep it open. Try Noodle fun in union city up the hill.  Authentic and worth the trip.  Avoid this place at all cost.
2015-02-17,3,Really friendly service. GF ordered something too hot, couldn't eat it, so they didn't charge us. Pad Thai was middling but serviceable, nothing to write home about but not gonna avoid it next time. Asked for it hot, got it just right.
2015-02-10,5,very good all around ,  zero complaints .  nice atmosphere and service.  asked for extra spicy and they absolutely delivered!
2015-01-01,5,Enjoyed our New Year's Day supper, especially the steamed dumplings and thai spring rolls. Friendly service and great menu selection. Very unassuming decor and homey feeling.
2014-12-20,1,This place is just horrible probably the worst place ever been. The soup I ordered smelled like puke. Told the waitress about it and her response was "this is how Thai food tastes like" (so defensive). Honestly I love Thai food . The waitress didn't even apologize and was mean to us.Also some random drunk guy was standing outside and cursing this place. That says it all
2014-10-25,3,Service was pleasant and quick. The menu has all your typical thai favorites along with a few you don't see everywhere. My Moo Khing was ok but the pork was on the dry side and there was no spice at all despite my asking for hot. Pad see ew was the same - decent flavor but overcooked protein.
2014-10-23,1,Don't ever eat here this place gave me food poisoning so bad I wound up in the hospital.  No joke don't do it.
2014-10-07,1,Horrible ...chicken satay not fully cooked, unclean utensils, flies, food was bland .. Not going back
2014-10-02,1,1. Rude Staff2. Unhygienic Preparation. We noticed something in the sauce and called the server. She took it away and still charged us. No apologies. As if it does happen frequently.3. Not many vegetarian options4. Avoid as much as you can
2014-09-10,4,I've eaten here many times both in the restaurant and takeout. When I eat here, I enjoy sipping on my cold beer and catching the end of Wheel of Fortune on their little TV before my food comes out. I always ask for everything extra spicy and they always bring it. I love the Gang Dang (red curry with beef), the Gai Gra-Praw (chicken and chilies) and the veggie Tom Tum Pak soup. The only thing I didn't love was the Crystal Pad Thai with Shrimp. I just like things a little more saucy. Best Thai in Hoboken. (However, not many other options.)
2014-09-02,2,Have been here a few times now, and it's honestly not very good. The noodles were clumped together and the meal was basically tasteless. I feel like even when I don't love something, I can at least finish it and even eat the leftovers... I just threw the rest of it out and ate enough to not be hungry anymore. There are so many other better Thai restaurants in Hoboken, will not be ordering here again. Not to mention, the delivery took over an hour.
2014-08-18,3,Run of the mill. Pretty much always get chicken Penang curry first time I try a Thai place. It was fine. Can't get brown rice without onions in it? Weird. Ate outside but the inside was nothing special to look at. I would probably go with takeout or delivery over dining in.
2014-07-21,4,I think this is nearly the most authenticated Thai restaurant in hoboken.I like their mixed vegetables and curries, especially the spice ones. Their drinks are good too, but they are also very expensive($6 for each). I think its a good place to go, and if you want to try real Thai foods, this is your must-go list.  I have been to there several times, and I still like to go to there every time I pass by hoboken.
2014-06-22,4,Great shrimp pad thai , thai ice tea was okay. Very nice staff
2014-06-15,4,I've eaten here quite a few times, both eat in and take out. Food is always great no matter what you order. Phenomenal green curry and vegetables in garlic sauce. The menu is pretty authentic and the food is always tasty. The satay and sprig rolls are also a great choice.
2014-05-28,2,this review is based on the food quality alone, i'm sure they have great service but i got delivery that not. i got the drunken noodles, the carrots were soggy, def frozen, only 3 pieces of shrimp and they charged 2$ for it. the basil was black, i also got a salad which they put on top of my meal and arrived hot, nothing like hot salad to go with your mediocre meal.
2014-04-16,4,Good food and at a good price. Chicken with peanut sauce is really tasty and goes well with a side order of coconut rice. Will definitely come back.
2014-04-14,3,Mediocre Thai food. Ordered last week. Their fried dumblings wee one of the worst we have had. Chicken Pad thai was pretty average. The sticky Mango Rice was just mediocre. Had better ones before. Its sad that Hoboken does not have a decent Thai restaurant. Guess I will have to order my food from across the river!
2014-04-12,4,I went for the lunch special, which is a very good deal: $6 for one entree with rice and $7 for two entrees and rice. It was a very tasty and filling lunch special.  I chose the eggplant and the sweet and sour pineapple chicken curry with white rice. The curries likely stay fresher than the chicken stir fries, fried rice, and noodles. My husband got the former two of these which were tasty but less fresh than my dish.  Service was great and portions large. The eggplant was delicious and not greasy at all and the pineapple chicken curry was very flavorful. We both left feeling very satisfied and would come again.
2014-03-31,1,I gave it 1 star because Yelp doesn't give a less than 1 star option! Terrible service, very unwelcoming. Food was mediocre to say the least. Too many great places to eat concentrated in this small area to ever go back. I am not much for negative reviews but I felt it need to be known.
2014-02-23,1,I dont think I want to come back again. Not really worth the money and the chicken wasn't cooked at all. The food had a nice flavor but definitively there are better places
2013-11-11,3,The food was really good, and the prices were reasonable. We got appetizers, entrees, and wine for pretty cheap. However the atmosphere was really awkward. From the outside the restaurant looks dark and intimate, but on the inside the lights were actually really bright and it was super quiet. Next time I'll probably just get takeout.
2013-10-22,1,Was in the mood for Thai food this past Saturday evening (10/19) and found this place on Washington Street. The place had Thai artwork on the walls, contemporary pop music played over a speaker, a hanging flatscreen TV playing Wheel of Fortune on ABC, and a woman--who we assumed was a manager--lounging on a table close to the kitchen... needless to say, the ambiance was a bit "off," but we didn't think much of it.When we sat down, I noticed that the pair of diners next to us were being asked if they were satisfied with their new dish, as apparently they had some problem with their first dish. Combined with the general "off"-ness it should've been a red flag, but we ordered:Our appetizer was the "Garee Puff," chicken and potato in a pastry shell ($6.95) which was tasty. The weird part was when the waitress took our appetizer plates away from us, she put our cutlery directly on the table itself--she didn't even set down napkins as a buffer until we asked for some about a minute later. Huge red flag. Our entrees were Chicken Pad Thai and Yellow Curry with Chicken (both $12.95). We didn't have any strong feelings in either direction about our food--we just felt that the Pad Thai was a bit dry, and the Curry was watery. After getting through half our plates we decided to ask for it wrapped up and head out. At this point it was half past 8 and there was only one other pair of diners in the place. 10 minutes pass with our waitress (young woman) asking us twice if we wanted dessert, and then she brings out the check. We ask if she has our food to go, and she turns pale and heads into the kitchen. I already have a feeling how this is going to end--and when she comes out with the other waitress she confirms that she accidentally threw out our food after wrapping it up. Yep. The waitress wanted to make up for it by giving us a free Thai Iced Tea or knocking off one of our bowls of rice from the bill ($2.00). We thought it was fair to knock an entire entree off the bill, given that we'd only eaten half of our dishes--but she kept making these token non-offers and insisting we had eaten most of our plates. We ended up getting about $10 off our bill for the mistake. I usually give places ton of leeway when it comes to eating out, and I'm someone who tips well as an automatic reflex. However, the combination of average food and subpar service here are just too much to overlook. There are other places that serve Thai on Washington Street--definitely try those out first.
2013-10-19,1,I wish I could give it 0. 1) I got a simple red curry with shrimp- Wayyyy too salty. It was like they put too much of the fish and chili paste in the pot. 2) Tom-yum soup- 3 pieces of shrimp in a entire soup container... Fine it's soup- but I mean don't be so stingy either. 3) 3 people ate it and all of us were in the bathroom for the entire night. Maybe this was an off night for them- because they have good reviews and I walk by there all the time and it seems packed... But I was not happy. Very disappointed and especially didn't like it because it made me completely sick.
2013-10-09,2,Skip it. Salt is not a Thai flavor. I had the pad thai chicken $11, which was entirely bland. The Thom kha gai ($5) was very salty and no flavor. Bottom line, try a different thai place, it would probably be cheaper anyways.
2013-10-01,4,Again a friend wanted to take me here because of the food. Its really delicious. I love the sweet curry chicken with pineapple. The lunch specials you can't beat! $7 for one entree and two sides or $6 for one entree and one side.I only gave four stars for i went for the lunch special and asked if I can get no rice but have entree and vegetables, the staff gave me a rude no. Really ? its a small request i never ask i go all the time, whats the problem?
2013-09-11,4,been eating here for the past 15 years., taste never changes. the place is small and quaint. Food is great ! try the fried calamari and the shrimp pad thai ( served generously) and match with their thai iced tea. Service is excellent.though im givng it a four star juat because its quite difficult to find a parking spot - its hoboken -- what do you expect.
2013-08-19,3,Good food. Nice ambience. Orders Tom Yum scoop , spicy and tasty. Chicken fried rice with pineapple is not upto the expectation, but okay.
2013-08-08,3,Average service and food.Supposedly this place is Thai approved. My friend's Thai friend said this is as authentic as thai food gets. Or at least closest to the food you would get in Thailand.To me, this place tasted just like another Thai places. So either all those other Thai places I go to are authentic, or this is just another restaurant. Their food are okay priced, I wouldn't say it is cheap though. At least $10 per dish, if you want meat added to your dish, is another $1-3 depending on what kind of meat/seafood you get.
2013-07-29,3,Bangkok City was the only Thai restaurant in Hoboken that I had yet to try.  Based on what little I could see from the street, the dining room appeared rather grungy and empty.  However, when a friend suggested that we give it a shot, I agreed, due to my love of Thai food.  I have to say that it was MUCH better than I had expected.  When I walked inside there was only one other group of diners, which was disconcerting, but the server greeted me with an enthusiastic hello for reassurance.  I was also happy to see that they offered a full bar, something that very few other Asian restaurants in the area possess.  I must admit that I did enjoy my ice cold Singha!Scanning the food menu was merely for show; I knew exactly what my culinary game plan was.  One of my favorite meals is Pad See Ew, so I tend to judge Thai restaurants based on the quality of their version.  I opted to include chicken this time around and was shockingly pleased with their rendition.  Sure the noodles were slightly over-cooked and the sauce could have used a bit more oomph, but after a dollop of hot sauce,  it was better than mediocre.  In fact, I honestly thought it was the best rendition I have had in Hoboken.I will definitely add this spot to delivery and dine-in lists.
2013-06-09,1,If you're the kind of person who enjoys a nice spicy plate of hot Drunken Noodles, I suggest you never go here. These noodles were dry and also (oddly enough)  overcooked. I'm not the type to care about texture -- but this dish had no taste at all so I had no choice but chew in disgust as my mouth encountered what I can only describe as spongy. Even the beef was a dissappointment. Never again.
2013-05-30,1,Ugh! I thought I would give it a second chance and it was worse than the first time. super gross and flavorless, especially anything battered. Bathrooms are pretty sketch too. Sri Thai for the win for Hoboken Thai food.
2013-04-24,2,I've come to Bangkok City for takeout lunch twice. The first time was a few months ago. They had a lunch menu, & I asked for an order of chicken pad thai. It was slightly oily, a reddish-orange color, but still a decent meal. The chicken was good & there were a good amount of peanuts included.I went back yesterday for takeout lunch, at the suggestion of one of my friends. As soon as I walked in, I was quickly ushered toward a hot buffet cabinet in the back with maybe 8-10 premade options.Have you ever eaten something solely because you're hungry? That's what I did here. The pad thai was more than disappointing. The noodles were dry & stuck together -- especially the ones she scooped from the bottom of the pan. Yet, the entire dish was greasy & oily? There were a few roughly-cut scallions, & nothing else. The chicken was tasteless, dry, & cracked. No peanuts. A couple carrot chunks & some wilted cabbage leaves were tossed carelessly on the side. It all tasted like it had been sitting for hours; yet, I got to the restaurant at 12:15. And afterward, I felt greasy & uncomfortable.I know they're capable of making decent food, so why not serve it at lunchtime too? The only positive is that my lunch was just $6.50. But I feel like they sacrificed quality for a better value. Not worth it, if you ask me.
2013-04-15,4,Delicious Thai Food!It's usually empty when we dine in, but it was crowded around 9pm on Saturday night.  This is good, because while I love their food, its usually empty- and I would be so sad if it closed!Anyways- my fiance and I shared two dishes, which could have fed three people.  We had the chicken with the Chili Basil sauce and Beef with white pepper and garlic sauce. However, we were starving, and since the food is so delicious, we finished them both.  One thing that makes this place slightly more expensive than other Thai spots in town, is that rice is not included- you have to order it separately as a side dish.  Also, its not BYO.One of my favorite authentic delish dinner spots in town- we will be back!
2013-03-21,3,Service - Great service; very kind & attentive.Food - Good massaman curry, but a bit watery; disappointing drunken noodle. noodles were soggy and bunched; awesome fried ice cream.Price - $35 for the aboveAmbiance - Cozy, comfortable
2013-03-19,4,The best thai food in Hoboken!  The restaurant is small and clean.  The staff is very nice and sweet.  And the food is delicious.  I have eaten here at least 5 times now and the quality is extremely consistent.  I happen to love spicy food and this place makes it really spicy.Try the Nua Ma Nau (Spicy Beef) with Coconut rice.  Its amazing.
2013-03-13,3,The food is definitely good They give you sake in a bottle and its fine. But the staff is impatient. They wanted us to order quickly as they were expecting a big party to arrive in the evening and that they wanted their kitchen to make everything before that. We were not informed of that when we entered but when we were ordering appetizers.
2013-02-17,1,I had a really bad experience here. My friend and I had dinner here last night as the place we wanted to go for dinner wasn't accepting walk-ins. Although the waitress was very attentive, there was a weird vibe overall in the restaurant. The table right next to us had these two women who were essentially hanging out. One had her shoes off, a stack of scratch-offs, and a bottle of prescription pills on the table. She kept getting up and staring at us and everyone eating. We believe she was the owner as she said goodbye when people left; she was giving us dirty looks the entire time. This other women was peeling the leaves off of a plant and watching tv as if she was in her own living room. We didn't dare use the bathrooms even though we needed to go. It just felt dirty in the place.The food was alright, but I've had much better Thai food on the east coast. We had the fried dumplings, green curry, shrimp and vegetables, and the fried banana ice cream dessert. Our bill was about $50 which is not bad, but you couldn't pay me to go back.
2013-02-14,4,Perhaps my new go-to Thai place in Hoboken.Went with a few people and enjoyed all the dishes that I tried.  Everything was at least solid to very good.Tried or had the: lemongrass soup, spicy beef, massaman curry and another chicken dish.Nothing blew off my socks but everything was quite good and I'll be back again soon!
2012-11-18,2,I ordered 3 different dishes togo and I don't think this place wins my vote. I ordered beef with broccoli (asked for beef with mix veggies and just got broc.), beef with pepper (which was good), and green curry (bit TOO watery and chicken was too dried).There were two things I didn't like about my food from Bangkok City; the meat was too dried and didn't taste fresh.  My beef had a bit of stale scent to it which made me question the freshness of the food.  Chicken in my curry was bit too dried but didn't taste old.  Price wasn't cheap either where each dish was $12.99.
2012-11-10,3,Second day here in Weehawken, we were walking up Washington and it started to sleet and snow. We needed to get some food and retreat to the hotel. Stopped into Bangkok Thai and got shrimp fried rice and pad see ew to go. The two ladies disappeared into the back and 5 minutes later emerged with our bag.The food was good, but nothing to write home about. The noodles were overcooked and gummy, and the vegetables were few...and limp. The rice was also good, but was better after I added the chili paste. The best food is when you don't have to do anything to it. Like I said, the food was good, but not great.
2012-10-21,1,I am a Thai food enthusiast. I lived in Pattaya for a year so I am always looking for good authentic Thai restaurants. I have tried two other thai restaurants here in Hoboken so I figured I would give Bangkok a shot. I immediately regretted my decision the second it was delivered to my apartment. As I reached for the bag from the delivery man I noticed a putrid stench permeating from the bag. It smelled as if the delivery bag was sitting next to raw rotten seafood. Needless to say it really made me anxious to try my food. I wrote it off as just an odd coincidence, I was really hungry and wasn't going to let it stop me from enjoying my food. Tom Yum Goon is my favorite Thai treat and so far this is the most bland cup of Tom Yum that I have had. The soup consisted of broth, lemon grass, chili's and 6 shrimp. There were no other vegetables in the soup which was very disappointing and it lacked the spicy kick a good cup of Tom yum typically has. We ordered the Kiew Wan and Gang Dang curries, which weren't bad but also lacked in diversity and was rather bland in flavor.The food wasn't horrible, it just left something to be desired. After wiping down my table with windex and febreezing the living room the rotten stench is STILL lingering in the air, making my stomach turn. What on earth could cause such a rancid stench? Most definitely will not be ordering from this restaurant again and I hope they get a thorough health inspection. If you are looking for good Thai food, this is not the place. Satay still has the most authentic and flavorful dishes I have had.
2012-10-09,1,Ended up leaving because of the sour staff and the fact I had to wait ten minutes for WATER.
2012-10-06,4,This afternoon, my boyfriend and I were shopping in Hoboken, both extremely craving some Thai food. We checked out a few places on Yelp and Bangkok City was the closest one to us at the moment...and I'm happy it was! We made it just in time for the lunch special which was incredible. For $7.00 you can get two entrees (chosen from a selection) and rice. I got pad thai and chicken kaw pad gra and it was delicious! Just enough spice! They do have sauces on the side if you want to add more of a kick to it. My boyfriend got sweet and sour chicken and pad thai...equally as delicious. He also got Thai iced tea to drink. it was my first time trying it and it was yummy! The server was incredibly nice and accommodating! Definitely going back!
2012-09-29,4,Last night my guy and I decided to go to a place in Hoboken that neither of us had been to before.  I'm SO glad we chose Bangkok City.Outdoor seating optional and a nice atmosphere inside.  The service was good but we had four different servers, which was a little confusing.  I tasted some of the coconut soup and it was great - salty and savory with a bit of sweetness.  For entrees he got the green curry with pork and said it was VERY spicy - like, clear-your-sinuses spicy.  I had the Gang Pak, which was delicious.  The brown rice was great and the veggies/tofu were cooked nicely.  I asked for it to be mild and it was still somewhat spicy, but not overpowering at all.Portion size was good too - we were very full by the end of the meal.  The prices weren't fabulous but weren't appalling either.  I would definitely eat here again.
2012-03-17,1,Went to this place with friends. 3 of us ordered vegetarian food. It was so bad that we ended up eating at a different place again.
2012-03-03,2,I wanted to like this place bc the poor old woman had to serve everyone herself. Bt that is why I'm giving this place a 2. Service was slow, food was average (too salty for me), no lunch special, price is higher than the other Thai places around, and they pride themselves on giving customers a homey feel, but I don't think it was homey...Came for lunch on a Friday with coworkers. Therer were about 2 other tables with people. Total customers is around 10.We had to seat ourselves, get our own forks and knives, etc. took her 20 min to fetus water, menu. Took another 20 min to get everyone's order. Portion was either too big or food wasn't good enough. Or maybe both. I don't remember what I got, but it's the one with beef and noodles. It was good at first then it got too salty for me. I couldn't finish my meal so I decided to pack it. W leave the place paying like 11 for each person or something. Get back to the company and I get a stomach ache again. I decided to throw the packed food out.Overall, slow service, not so great food, and better priced Thai resatuarants in hoboken.
2012-02-26,4,I've been to Bangkok City several times and have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The restaurant itself is quite small. Usually, I luck out and come here when it's pretty empty, but when the place is moderately packed, seating is cramped and uncomfortable... something that frequenters of Hoboken bars and restaurants should be used to though. The decor is quite dated and gives the feeling that you're having dinner at your Thai grandmother's house rather than going out on the town for dinner. Service is decent enough, it's usually just the owner of the restaurant and one other waitress. Like I said, I usually come here when it's not that busy so I usually don't have any problem with service, however, I did come when it was busy and the service is quite awful with just one waitress and the owner attending all the customers. The food itself is good, but I wouldn't say that it's exceptional. I usually order the Pad Kee Mow with a side of coconut rice and Thai iced tea, and it's amazing. I dislike a few things about this restaurant but overall I would say that it is a good spot if you're looking for a quick Thai food fix. It might be a little over-priced for what I'm used to seeing with many Thai restaurants but this place is definitely worth trying out at least once.
2012-02-05,2,Of all the Thai options, I would say this is the worst. The food is very mediocre and its more expensive than other Thai restaurants. Between T Thai, Sri Thai and Simple Thai, I don't have any reason to go back to this place as the food is better at all of those restaurants. If this was located in the middle of the country with very few ethnic food options and a lack of diversity it would probably be considered pretty good, but by Hoboken's standards, your best bet is to go with one of the other many options.
2012-02-05,4,This review is for take-out only.  I have never actually sat to eat at Bangkok City, so I can't speak to the dining-in experience (which seems to be the focus of the negative reviews), but this has been my go-to Thai take-out for the last year.  I haven't strayed far from a few favorites, but the nua ma-nua is fresh and bright, the panang is rich and has layers of flavor, the gra-pow is intense with a ton of thai basil, and the pad thai is better than any you'll find in Hoboken.  But be warned: the spicy dishes are SPICY, even if you ask for "mild".  Also, to those who complain about the food being heavy or greasy, A) it's thai food, so don't expect a diet menu, and B) the kitchen is very accommodating if you ask for "less oil".  Yes, the prices are a dollar or so higher than at some of Bangkok City's competitors, but the quality of ingredients warrants the slight mark-up.
2012-01-28,3,went there couple of times , very different taste and texture of same dishes we ordered......................Service was a bit rude and Food was greasy with tons of coconut in it.................
2012-01-27,1,Ordered food, while waiting a mouse ran across my friends foot and we immediately got up and left. Will not be going back there.
2012-01-05,5,Delicious food- flavorful, savory, and large portions. Will return to try more selections from the menu.
2011-12-29,1,RUDE SERVICE . I am torn here. The food is delsih but the owner, who sits on her fat a*s all day and folds laundry at one of the tables while watching the TV way too loud, is vicious. If you do NOT have to speak to her, you will be fine (short, curly hair, drag queen type make up). Hopefully you will get the polite waitress who looks Thai but speaks perfect English ( you can tell she is petrified of Cruella de Vil, aka, the owner.  Bathrooms need to be cleaned badly and I REALLY hate it that "rice is extra" (as in, no matter what you order, you have to buy the rice extra, which is a huge scam).So in short, if you are gagging for yummy Thai and feel it's worth a bit of bad service, you should brave the storm. AVOID OWNER AT ALL COST. SHE IS A 'C U NEXT THURSDAY!'
2011-09-04,2,In as few words as possible, I find their food greasy and their prices way too high.  They bang you a $3 delivery fee and, though the food is very fresh when it arrives (probably because no one else is dumb enough to pay the fee for delivery), it's still painful.  For $8, there was Hae Kun, an appetizer of four "dumplings" that were essentially shrimp and crab meat wrapped in bean curd skin.  It came with a sauce that was half gelatin.  For  $13, there was an order of Pad Thai.  A large portion suited for 2+  people but with very little flavor.  I felt I needed to add something but couldn't place what. Overall, I was disappointed.  I might give them another shot but with at least one or two other Thai options within several blocks that are way more impressive (and delivery for free!), I doubt it.
2011-08-24,4,Good food, Pad thai was bit sweet with too much peanut sauce but other than that it was fine.
2011-08-20,2,Food was alright. Other reviews are a bit misleading; no regrets but not impressed at all.
2011-08-06,3,Had dinner here for the first time the other night, and I was really torn between giving 3 or 4 stars.The food came out to be really good. I ordered the pad sew ew with chicken, and it came out delicious! There was mountain of food, it was chock full of veggies, and the sauce was really on point. They even serve beer, which is not typical for small Thai places (most I've been to are BYOB)The reason I gave only 3 stars is I had a few issues with the place. First of all, I've been to several Thai places in my life, and at every single one you have the ability to ask for a spice level for your meal. When I asked for my pad se ew to be medium spicy, the server said this dish does not come spicy, but you can get hot sauce in the side...I've never encountered this before even though I've ordered pad sew at many other Thai restaurants.My second, and even bigger, complaint is that my meal, for some odd reason, came out like 10 minutes after everyone elses at the table. There seemed to be no logical reason for this other than they started on my dish later than everyone elses; we all got very similar dishes that incorporated noodles, veggies, and some type of protein (you would think its pretty simple to make a big batch of noodles and then mix in the different items for each dish).So, for poor service, I have to give Bangkok City 3 stars. If the just got their act together a little bit, they would definitely qualify for 4 stars because the food is really quite good.
2011-07-20,5,This is hands down the best thai place Hoboken has to offer. I have no idea why we always had passed this place up when walking down Washington. The food was fantastic. The Garee puffs (chicken & sweet potato puff pastry) and dumplings were perfectly made! Definitely worth going to, you wont be disappointed!
2011-07-05,4,Pad Thai is one dish which I compare Thai restaurants with one another. Here, Pad Thai is pretty good, has some kick to it. ThisPlace also offers Red/Green/Masamon curry's with/without coconut option. My friend tried without coconut and liked it. I would go here again.
2011-07-03,5,Huge fan of this place! It may not be the most authentic food, but they give you enormous portions of tasty Thai curries. I had the Massaman Curry with beef, and it's a massive tureen of meat, potatoes, onions and peanuts in a mildly spicy curry broth. The beef satay was huge chunks of sirloin in a spicy peanut sauce, and the Sticky Rice with Mango was a perfect chaser. An amazing deal if you go there for the weekday lunch specials. I barely finished my meal, but it was too good not to!
2011-06-22,3,I'm mixed. I've been here before without any problem-- the ambiance is nice, and they have outdoor seating-- however, I definitely wish their exhaust fan worked in the kitchen so it didn't smell like a seafood dish was being made AT the entrance... (which is also why we decided on outside seating, even in 85 degree whether). Two of my friends ordered pad thai (one chicken and one veg)... but for some reason that influence the amount of sauce they put in for the pad thai and the veg was DRENCHED in a heavy smoky overly cooked pad thai sauce..I had red curry, while a friend ordered green curry- while BOTH were delicious and the veg's were cooked very nicely, they were the SAME...  I wish she repeated the order because my friend specifically ordered a green curry (flavors are very different and the spice kick is also better), but had to eat something she didn't order. I will go back I think, just to give some redemption-- but after I try Hi-So Thai which is getting good reviews.... but a little outside the "Washington st." main Hoboken area
2011-05-15,3,A reasonable Thai place though on the slightly pricey side.  One of the only ones in the area with outdoor seating, on Washington no less.One of my big pet peeves: rice is extra.
2011-04-13,5,I am a big fan of Bangkok City. I first ate here in January 2010 with two of my friends when we came to visit Hoboken. We live about 45 minutes from Hoboken, but go every now and then a couple times a year just to hang out, walk around and eat at one of the many delicious restaurants. This is definitely my favorite.The service is very nice and friendly and the food is always so good! My favorite is the Pad Thai, in my opinion they make it the best. My friend who actually is Thai really likes it as well, she doesn't think it is the best but she gets it a lot as well. As an appetizer I also recommend the Yum Nua - Beef Salad. Very unique and full of flavor, as is everything you get here.I also love the Chicken Sate with the yummy peanut sauce they serve it with. Don't forget to try the Thai Iced Tea. Definitely different but delicious! I will be going to Bangkok City as long as it is still there!
2011-03-14,4,I stopped here on Saturday to get some takeout with my lady.  We decided to get shrimp pad thai and a salad.  Even though we were just getting takeout, the service was very nice and friendly, the older gentleman that took our order was great, I kind of want to come back here just to interact with him again.The pad thai was ok, but I was really impressed by the salad.  I know what sounds stupid, but anytime I am in the mood for a nice fresh simple salad, I will be coming here to get my fix.
2011-02-23,4,Pleasantly surprised by a recent order....got two of their soups, and both were extremely flavorful and delicious. Also ordered the thai beef salad, which was really different and tasty, but the beef was not tender, a bit tough. The shrimp w/ red curry sauce was da bomb.
2011-02-19,4,I love this place. They have the best Thai food in town and it has the most authentic flavor. I have eaten here at the restaurant a handful of times. There is only one door at the entrance so it could get quite when you are sitting by the door. The decor is nice, the pictures/statues and smell of this restaurant brings me back to Bangkok. Ah... The only funny thing is that they have big TV in the corner that's always on. Also, there is a round table towards the back designated for the owner and her husband. They're usually hanging out reading news paper, or cutting some vegetables. lol. That's cool. There is one waitress who always says "ka" after everything. Which is the Thai way of being polite. Love that.The food always come out quickly and piping hot. Some of our favorite dishes include: - Pad Kee Mow - My fave dish! This has a little kick to it unlike other pad kee mows out there.- Shrimp & Squid in Prawn Sauce (Goong & Pla Mueg Nam Pic): My husband always orders this and it is delicious! The sauce might sound a little intimidating but it tastes just like a sweet chili sauce.- Pad See Iwe- Crystal Pad Thai: It's just like pad thai but with the clear noodles. - Stir Fried Bean Sprout with Bean Curd- Steamed Dumplings- Mango and Sweet Sticky Rice- Tom Yum Delivery: yes for dinner; no for lunchEnjoy ka!
2011-02-16,4,i used to live a few doors down from this place so it was always my staple for take out. yesterday i went and sat down for the first time and honestly, i think i'd rather just continue to take out. it's a small place with probably less than 15 tables, very quaint. the hdtv was playing wheel of fortune, solid! they sell beer and wine, very reasonably priced. and the food was delicious! very flavorful and nice sized portions for a very good price. but the waitress brought one person's dish out a full five minutes before bringing out the other dish - and that to me is extremely poor service. why not just wait until both are ready, there are only two of us?! so yes, i will continue to order form here but no i probably won't be back to hang for dinner. there are cooler atmospheres in hoboken...
2010-12-02,4,I've been visiting this Thai gem in Hoboken since they opened about 20 years ago. Bangkok City was my first experience with Thai. They have never disappointed me. The food is always top notch and the owner is just sooo welcoming. Their Tom Yung Koong soup is the best I've ever had and is the standard against which I measure all others. My only regret is that I am not often in Hoboken.If you find yourself in town I'd highly recommend visiting Bangkok City
2010-09-02,4,I only give 4 stars because I have only had delivery, so I can't speak for the ambience.  The food we got was incredible.  I got a thai basil and thai chile dish with chicken.  It was honestly a little too spicy for me to finish, but my friend who prefers extra spicy enjoyed it very much.  I get a similar dish at most thai places I visit, and this had one of the most flavorful sauces of any I've had.  My other friend was not all that fond of the green curry she ordered, but this is my review and I would never order that anyway, so I'm going to act like it didn't happen.  According to one of my Filipino friends who spent many years in the far east, Bangkok City serves the most authentic Thai food in all of Hoboken.  I highly recommend!Update:Try the Panang Curry.  Very tasty!
2010-05-22,2,Went back there another time and their green curry chicken was super watered down.  Customer service was not too great either.  Not sure what happened here?!
2010-03-16,4,I've eaten Thai from most places here in The Boken and was skeptical to try Bangkok (if for no other reason than the name makes me giggle).  The reviews here on Yelp were pretty awful but were also outdated.  I'll preface my review by saying I'm not a fussy eater, but I can distinguish  great food from just average.Now, I cannot speak for the ambiance since we ordered in, but I can tell you that our food arrived hot AND with plenty of chop sticks.  It took a tad longer than I thought (from the time I placed the order on Delivery.com to the time it arrived, about 55 minutes) though we did order 4 items:*  Pad Kee Mow (Drunken Noodles) w. Pork ($10.95)*  Crabmeat Fried Rice ($12.95)*  Gai Gra-Praw Entree ($10.95)*  Pad Thai - pork  ($9.95)I like my food super spicy so I keep chili garlic sauce on hand but alone, the dishes had a great spice and flavor to them.  The one thing I did miss about the presentation of the pad thai was a wedge of lime (commonly given when I order from Sri Thai).Everything was very tasty and I will order from Bangkok again (hehe).
2009-12-08,3,A few months ago, I dated a Thai girl for about a year, and one of the best parts of the relationship had to have been her mother. Her mother spoiled me, and every day she would cook for me authentic Thai food for lunch and dinner. I joke with my ex nowadays that I sometimes miss her mom the more than her, but it's all in good fun. In any case, since the break, I've been craving that delicious Thai food that I was spoiled with, but no restaurant could really compare, until this one.When you first walk in, the dim lights, fancy glass and silver wear, and the chandeliers give the place that high class feel; however, when you take a closer look at things, you find out that things just don't match up. Maybe it's just me, but a waiter dressed in a "Corruption" T shirt, jeans, and sneakers doesn't really scream high class to me. But again, maybe it's just me. His level of service didn't help too much either. It was 2 pm and we were the only ones in the restaurant, yet it still took 30 minutes to refill our waters after we asked. Then at the end of the meal when we were paying the check, they decided then to tell us that the credit card machine was broken. Thankfully, my guest had enough cash on him to pay the meal otherwise I might have spent my Wednesday night washing dishes and clearing tables.Even though they are fronting class and had service that wasn't up to par, the food is really where this place shines. From 11am - 3pm, they have a super cheap lunch special that includes soup or salad and a main course with rice for the very reasonable price of $6.95. It was so cheap, we decided to order 3 specials and have a family style lunch. The chicken Thai soup that they served was quite delicious and had a nice spicy Thai kick that I enjoy. For the main courses, we ordered Red Curry with Beef, Pad Nor-Mai with Chicken, and of course, what visit to a Thai restaurant is complete without Pad-Thai with chicken. The Pad Nor-Mai was good but nothing to write home about, and the Pad-Thai was well cooked, but didn't offer any options on how spicy or what kind of meat to put in it. However, the Red Curry with beef was especially delicious as it was exactly what my ex-girlfriends mom used to make for me. The beef was a bit over cooked but the sauce was made perfectly. To finish it off, we had ordered their fried ice cream for dessert, and I am happy to say that it is definitely one of the best I've had in town. A common problem is that the ice cream is too doughy, but theirs is crispy and delicious. It is served with chocolate syrup and whip cream, which makes for a very tasty treat. Usually when I form my opinion of a restaurant, I try not to let minor infractions in service and ambiance affect my overall rating of the restaurant. I am a firm believer in letting the food do the talking, but there are some things that cannot be ignored. If the deÃÅcor and the service match the quality of the food, then this place would be a real gem.
2009-10-05,2,Skip the delivery service, it took 1.5 hours for me to get my food.  The service is amateur at best.  The food itself was okay, definitely not worth the wait.
2009-06-13,1,By far the worst place ever, we went there a few days ago for dinner with my sister visiting. We got there at 9.30 to be greeted by an obnoxious hostess. We order the food and they tell us it's the last order when it was only 9.45. The food was like the last order so you know it's the left over's of the day, it tasted horrible, there was nothing THAI about the food. My wife found hair in her food and called the hostess who instead of apologizing just takes the plate away and does not return. Finally we got fed up and called for our check only to find they had included the dish with the hair in it, I called the hostess and she raised her voice saying "What should I do"  I had to request her to deduct the dish which she did after a rude facial expression. Trust me the FOOD is extremely not worth the attitude. I am not a blogger so they must have done something bad for me to actually post, the rest is your choice.
2009-05-07,4,Like the others said, the place is a very mom and pop restaurant. From the outside, the place does not look that appetizing, but once you set foot I think you'll change your mind. From what I ordered I thought the food was great. However, the service was rather slow, considering I went on a random rainy Wednesday night. Regardless, I still loved the food. I ordered the chef's lamb special (to try something new) and my friend, being in the not so adventurous mood, ordered the Pad Thai. My lamb was fine, although a little on the rich side. However, I would have to say my friend's Pad Thai was rather tasty. I have tried Pad Thai everywhere from Thailand to my own kitchen, and I was not disappointed with Bangkok City's Pad Thai. If you're in Hoboken and tired of the uber-sweet Pad Thai served at the other restaurants around, or you want to try something new, I suggest you check out Bangkok City.  **NOT BYOB**(learned the hard way)
2009-01-28,5,This place had the most amazing red curry I've ever had. And I'm a HUGE fan or red curry. It's basically the only thing I eat when I go out for Thai because it's so delicious. My favorite dish. I can't say much about the pad thai, though. I tried it and wasn't impressed. Their sticky rice is SUPER sticky and delicious as well.
2008-03-12,4,very mom and pop thai! i loved it. super authentic! the green curry made my body hottt i rec.the green currychicken and beef sataythe soft shell crab (your choice of preparation)i went there twice during my stay in hoboken purely for the green curry!
2007-12-16,4,It's very inviting.  There is not even a front foor, but a SIDE door you go in so you fell like a real member of the Thai family.  Nice noodles, nice Veg's.  They say there is an arts and crafts store downstairs but alas it's more like a "store room."  Bravo, Bangkok City!  You have a chain location in Dallas.  Two of them.  Have a look at the old white sommeleier in the back and the nice copper coffee machine - This Ain't no Mr. Coffee if you hear me!  I wish you had people in there with better hairdos though.
2006-09-20,3,It's crowded and cramped but the food is tasty. The owner will come out to chat with you and makes sure you are having a good meal. I've been lucky enough to get a beer comp'ed for me and my date. They are just nice people and the pad thai is yummy. It's great for a quick bite especially on a cold evening and you are in the mood for Thai, this is the place to go. I've enjoyed their lemongrass chicken and I happen to love green curry so I do that whenever I eat Thai. It's spicy and good. I recommend the chicken with your curry and get the sticky rice. Always the sticky rice.
