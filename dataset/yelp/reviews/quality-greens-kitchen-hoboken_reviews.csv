2021-10-25,4,Delicious I make my own salad here sooo good kale is fresh, and all the sides and additives are fresh I believe you get 4 add ons included in the salad, anything extra and you have to pay for it What I ordered:1. Create your own salad 4.5 with heavy on the Caesar dressing Base - kale, cucumbers, tomatoes, chick peas, cooked broccoli, --(add on: avocado, dried cranberries)2. Max n cheese 4.5 3. Spicy string beans 4.5 (I add them to my salad so delicious) The hot food options also look good. Many options here. Quick, no hassle service, fast food without the fast quality. Food is actually really good. There are both Indoor and outdoor seating options, although they are sparse in my opinion. Only complaint or the lines are confusing to me they should make the lines more convenient. There's a line for the hot plates and a second line for the salads, but what if you want to order both ? Can be confusing for customers.
2021-10-19,1,This place is pretty dirty. There are flies flying around the salad area. Also, one of the employees making my salad accidentally spit on the salad bar while asking what I wanted in my salad bowl. Yikes I was pretty grossed out by that. Will not be returning.
2021-10-15,5,So yummy! Great healthy options and the food was is super fresh. They give you big portions and everything is packed and seasoned well. Definitely recommend if you like Dig.
2021-10-11,2,Great food... not so great service. Came in for a salad and I wanted to add a few crunches and chicken and a girl with blonde hair was extremely rude. She added a scoop of chicken and overdid the crunch. I asked her nicely to remove some and she took a huge chunk of my salad and threw it out. She tossed my salad and some landed on the table and she scooped the salad in my bowl and even what was on the table she scooped. I didn't say anything just to get out and she gave me my salad and came to the front and was having a whole conversation with the girl ringing me up. She snatched my card and when I asked for my receipt she didn't give me it. And they both walked away laughing. Terrible SERVICE!!
2021-09-30,2,Been ordering from this place ever since it first opened, and we love it. But we've noticed that portions keep getting smaller and smaller. You only get 4 small slices of steak for a $16 bowl. Roast chicken about 5 small slices without the crispy skin like before. Salmon is way smaller. :( Sides are salads are still very good though.
2021-09-01,5,Great selection of salads and artisanal plates. You know the food is good when thinking of it makes your taste buds jingle
2021-08-04,1,This is one of my favorite places to eat and order from but today is my last time ever. I got the steak bowl with rice. All the pieces of the steak was undercooked, bloody, and you can see the white fat pieces on it. The steak wasn't even chewable. I'm sorry but how can you serve this or even give this to a customer without double checking? I had one bite and now my stomach hurts. This is so disappointing. You can get people sick. I had to throw my whole meal away and now I lost $$$ since this place is already overpriced and now undercooked. Do not come here unless you like to eat raw meat.
2021-07-30,2,I was really excited to try this place in hopes it would taste like a similar spot called Fresh Kitchen in FL. Unfortunately it did not at all. I don't feel like the flavors are very fresh as I may have anticipated. There wasn't anything so delicious or cooked so well that I feel the need to go back here. If someone wants to go, sure because it's not horrible but I won't go out my way for it.And unfortunately the tables inside and outside were not maintained or clean, which I was surprised.
2021-07-24,2,I ordered a Rosemary Roasted Chicken Plate with Sautéed Broccoli and Macaroni & Cheese. The food was not great. The chicken lacked flavor and the macaroni and cheese was dry and not cheesy. The broccoli was a little over cooked, but I liked the lemon flavor.
2021-07-01,3,Definitely a Hoboken staple for healthy food. Service has a little room for improvement. Ordered Tuesday for lunch, got the roasted chicken delivered with a solid 2 slices of chicken breast. Ordered dinner tonight, decided to switch it up and get the herb marinated steak: got the sides, rice, and no steak to be found.
2021-07-01,4,The food is very well seasoned, a bit too salty, but all in all delicious! The portion size was enough for me to have both lunch and dinner. The only thing I would suggest differently is that they don't charge $0.10 for a bag to carry it out in. I'm pretty sure the average transition is close to $15.
2021-06-19,5,Awesome and high quality food! Chicken is organic, salmon is sushi grade. You can add any toppings.I took a bowl with salmon, Brussels, fried carrots, avocado, and kale - so tasty and healthy.
2021-06-07,5,The food was seasoned well and very tasty for healthy food. Proportions are pretty large. The mint lemonade was very good as well! Only wish is that the prices were a little lower, over would eat here again.
2021-05-25,5,i always order from here and their food is always so delicious and healthy! i love the sweet potatoes so much i get extras every time.
2021-05-23,5,Yes, I began to eat and then proceeded to take the picture. This spot is always good. I get the chef's plate with the steak & this time 'twas served with sauteed broccoli and half an avacado.  Healthy, filling, and light. The walk-in set-up to order is breif. IN-&-OUT.
2021-05-18,5,I don't typically right reviews but the service stood out to me in this particular case. I walked in after a run hoping they had Apple Pay since I didn't have my wallet on me. One of the employees was very understanding and instead of just apologizing and letting me walk out, he offered to comp the meal in exchange for spreading the word about Quality Greens Kitchen! I couldn't believe it, that's the last thing I would have expected to hear especially during Covid. There's something to be said forgreat customer service because now I tell everyone I know this story which is worth way more than the meal. I personally did not think it was enough so I also went back the next week, bought another delicious meal and paid for the comped one. Unfortunately I did not ask for his name which is my fault, but he knows who he is and I greatly appreciated it!
2021-05-15,4,Ordered their umami crunch salad for pick up. They're very flexible and let you replace a lot of the ingredients, which I appreciated. It was a bit salty (specifically the chicken), but it was fresh and the dressing was mixed very well. Hit the spot!
2021-05-07,2,The steak tastes well, smallest portion i've seen around. just a bit over  1/2  of a similar dish from dig inn. the salad base is about  of what you will get from dig inn. over all about  of size of a chipotle bowl (food is not comparable, as they are different styles, just to give an idea of the size of a portion)one star for the steaks and one star for the staff.
2021-05-07,1,Food taste is alright. This place is NOT cheap at all. I paid about $14 for one bowl, but the portion of the food is way too little.  It's like eating a kid meal. Dig Inn is better than this in term of the food taste, portion, and healthiness. It doesn't make me want to go back.
2021-04-13,3,Solid healthy food, but the delivery service is lacking. They consistently forget my drink orders, it's a bummer to have to call and ask for a refund every time.
2021-02-27,5,My husband and I order from here a LOT and the food is always really good.  I really cannot even remember once when we were not happy.  It is difficult to do food consistently and yet they seem to be able to do it and DELIVER it!  Wow.  I called the restaurant to say thank you for the amazing food and Satma was so gracious, we really appreciate the kindness and the happy voice on the other end of the phone :)Note: The salmon is the only salmon I will eat unless I prepare it myself. I only eat wild salmon because I am not crazy about the taste of salmon most of the time.  Quality Greens Salmon...OMG so good.  Thank you Quality Greens!
2021-02-24,5,So what started as a bit of a frustrating situation ended up being rectified professionally and handled with so much kindness. The way Alyssa (I think that was her name) and her team handled the confusion with our order was the perfect example of great customer service. The food here is great, and the people working tonight really made an amazing impression !
2021-01-06,4,Decent spot for salad and healthy options. Taste is ok and you can customize all the additional items. Pretty much like dig innNot the best as the prices are on the higher side. Portion sizes are big enough to fill you for one meal. I ordered through ubereats and nothings came soggy . Everything was well packed. They attached the promo code coupon to my order which I am adding to this review. Feel free to use it.
2020-12-21,5,I'm having one of those days where I want to eat healthy but can't bring myself to cook...thankfully Quality Greens Kitchen delivers! If you're a fan of Dig Inn, you'll love this place. I actually like it a little better, the protein portions are bigger and they give you more dressing on the side.I loved the maple sriracha brussel sprouts and the kale caesar sides. I'll absolutely order those again. The bowl comes with two sides, but I ordered the mac and cheese side as well to share with my fiancé. We both agreed it was great (and plenty to share)!My only complaint was the salmon was a little dry. However, once I added the horseradish sauce, it was much better.I'll definitely order from here again! I know some reviews on here mention quality inconsistencies, but based on this experience I'm a fan.
2020-12-11,5,Ordered via Uber Eats, the food was delicious! I was hesitant upon ordering as I wasn't too sure about the true quality of food here but everything from the chicken, maple sriracha Brussel sprouts, the whole bowl was delicious! Perfect kick of spice. Chicken was delicious and wellCooked not too dry. Mac was cheesy goodness! Looking forward to ordering again soon picture does not give it true justice.
2020-12-06,4,I have recently given this place another try and they seemed to have improved. I hope they continue to take the necessary steps to ensure food quality.
2020-12-03,3,I got a the caesar salad and my bf got the chicken/brussel sprout/sweet potato combo. Food was good! However giving 3 stars because I ordered for pickup at 545 and when I arrived at 535 the food was cold.. so I'm sure the food would've tasted way better had they been freshly made.
2020-12-01,5,Healthy, wholesome and sooo tasty! My new favorite spot! Shout out to the kitchen & delivery staff!
2020-11-18,5,The food here is amazing and the service matches it!  I ordered the salmon with the Brussels sprouts and curry cauliflower and my friend ordered the chicken with the Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes.  Everything was seriously so tasty and fresh tasting!!!!  You can tell they use fresh quality ingredients and the best!!! The delivery was the issue as it arrived 40 mins late but I called the restaurant and they did everything in their power to contact the driver.  Apparently, they don't use their own drivers, so the driver took too many orders.  Anyway, the manager Rich was super nice and had another order sent out immediately and offered a discount and an additional side.  He was super friendly and I highly recommend this place!
2020-11-10,4,After giving Quality Greens a second chance, it appears that my previous review might have been a one off situation. As of recently, their food quality is pretty good and the portion size is decent. It's a struggle sometimes to finish in one sitting. It's a good option when you want something healthy yet delicious. Some of my friends feel the way and are regulars at this place. I would recommend.
2020-11-10,5,Have ordered from these guys a ton - their food is amazing and if there is ever a hiccup, the owners reach out to make sure you're taken care of. Customer service is just as good as their food. Highly recommend ordering from here. They make tremendous food and care about who they serve - great aspect of the community.
2020-11-07,5,I get my salad every day here for lunch. No complaints. Good selection, fresh ingredients, I'm happy.
2020-11-06,1,Good food, terrible service. After today I won't be coming back. The staff seem to hate working there and don't even pretend when the customers are around. Every time I walk in, I feel like I'm interrupting their conversations and intruding on their space. And this is not the first or second or third time I've been there. If the staff was professional I would be back all the time! They talk openly about how they dislike the management, how they want to quit, all whilst ignoring the customers and passive aggressively serving food. This is the only review I've ever written! Shame because the food is good.
2020-10-30,5,I've enjoyed meals at a number of places in Hoboken, but what I like most about Quality Greens Kitchen is their diverse menu of options, particularly for corporate catering.  I've used them a number of times for events and even my pickiest eaters find something they really enjoyed.  I certainly don't think of many restaurants if I'm catering for clients or thinking about lunch.  Great spot.
2020-10-17,1,If you value your safety, please do not order from this place!  First of all Laura the night time manager was rude and racist!  They don't care about their customers.   Now to the food... it was cold when it arrived and my daughter got sick.  I'm convinced it was food poisoning.  This place should be shut down by the health department!
2020-10-07,5,QGK is like if Dig Inn was actually good. Unparalleled. The best ingredients, the staff are friendly/courteous/fast, the delivery is always in the best possible condition. They do everything well and I frequently alternate my orders - it's hard to pick a favorite. Everything is just that good. Five stars.
2020-10-07,5,Quality Greens was a fantastic experience for me - the food was delicious and the customer service was awesome. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a good fast casual spot in Hoboken.
2020-09-10,5,Alaways good, always fresh. I have tried numerous salads and never disappointed.  Just got a salmon dish, it is delish.  If you like alot of protein, double order.  You might just have enough for leftovers.  Delivery to Weehawken usually around 50 minutes.  Non complaints.
2020-09-09,1,I loved their salads but I just ordered off uber eats and am greatly disappointed. One of the items I ordered was missing (which may have been a problem on uber eats end). But what is not acceptable is there was a nail clipping on top of my salad!!! The first bite and there is a nail in my mouth. You can see in the photo and that it is not my nail color. Will not be ordering again
2020-09-04,4,Love the umami crunch salad, the kale salad (though they really DOUSE it in dressing when you order delivery, it literally leaked out of the container into the bag and the bottom of the bag ripped when I picked it up and other items fell out), and the three bean ceviche the most. The chicken is pretty good. The steak is kinda gross. It has this irony gamey taste.  Not sure what grade of meat is used. The chicken sometimes is chewy. But I do enjoy mostly everything else.Also y'all go way too heavy on the rosemary for the carrot fries. It tastes moldy.
2020-08-31,3,I'm not a fan of how this business presents itself. Lettuce everywhere, they don't clean up as they go. One girl didn't have her mask fully on and was working with preparation of food. Overall appeared disorganized.
2020-08-20,4,Delivery for dinner tonight. My husband has been on a salmon kick. I was craving meat. I ordered a salad with both chicken and steak. Both were cooked perfectly. Salad was tasty and fresh. My husband enjoyed his salmon. The piece was a bit small. We ordered the roasted beet salad on the side which had amazing flavor. A great choice. Healthy food - hit the spot. Not to fussy. Simple - good flavors.  Great for take out or delivery.
2020-08-12,1,Although customers have been supporting this business during the pandemic, they have started skimping out on ingredients. A few months ago I noticed that the kale Caesar had less and less: tomatoes, cheese crisps, chicken... same price, no note.I finally called to complain because my last order didn't have ANY parmesan crisps AT ALL on my two Kale Caesars (we all know this is the best part of the salad...) and was told that only one salad would be refunded... oh and the response about the deteriorating quality: they need to watch their portions due to the pandemic prices and they are doing customers the service of delivery from Hoboken... yeah delivery customers pay for.Never buying from here again... I could make my own Kale Caesar. I'm sure I could even figure out how to make my own Parmesan crisps.
2020-07-29,5,Never been there but have ordered from them countless times directly from their website.  I work in town, and it's one of my go to lunches.  The delivery is also super fast (never used a third party to order like seamless so I think that helps with delivery cuz I do it on their website).  It's healthy and delicious and consistent but kinda pricey - hey, isn't everything tho in Hoboken?I love the veggie trio - my fav sides are avocado, sweet potatoes, curried carrots, and the spicy sweet Brussel sprouts.I get the steak salad but tweak it to customize to kale, walnuts, apples, Edamane while removing less desirable ingredients so the cost remains the same.This place is yummy!!!
2020-07-27,1,I will give zero star or -1 Star if I can. Rude, stingy owner I have never seen such like this. Black list forever the last restaurant I will go to. Already spread the words to my friends around. I will give my money to all other restaurants around that are truly caring for their customers.
2020-07-20,2,I've ordered here numerous times with Uber Eats/Grubhub with no issue. In a bid to put more $$ into the hands of the restaurant, I decided to order directly from qualitygreens.com. This is the 3rd time I have ordered which has been a disaster. The first two times it took close to two hours to be delivered. This last time, my order never arrived (after waiting for 1.5 hours) and the driver supposedly delivered it. Needlesstosay, I won't be ordering again.
2020-07-16,1,Picked up lunch from here on 7/15/2020. The place was practically empty, only two other customers, one of which was not wearing a face covering while indoors. The 9 employees I counted working behind the counter at the time didn't care to say a word to this man as he walked about the space and gave his food order. It also took almost 5 minutes for one of the 9 employees to even acknowledge my presence, let alone offer to serve me. I would NEVER recommend this place as it became clear they do not care about customer safety or customer service. Wouldn't be surprised if they have a COVID-19 outbreak within....
2020-06-25,5,I ordered for the first time today and I was blown away. Everything was delicious, and tasted so fresh. Absolutely loved it and will be eating from here again!
2020-06-18,3,Food is decent, decent is the main word when you found a HAIR in your protein bowl. I read that a few other people had experienced the same thing - MAKE YOUR EMPLOYEES PROTECT THEMSELVES! Hello, personal hygiene is right up there with wearing a mask.
2020-06-05,5,I never leave reviews for places but this absolutely deserved a review! I am a picky eater but this food was soooo good. I got the Vegetable Trio and it was  absolutely amazing. I'm so happy i ordered from here will def be back soon
2020-06-01,4,Got some really tasty salads they were made quick and made to order no complaints. They are in a way more of a deluxe salad so they are a little more pricey. They have a decent Variety and strong flavors.
2020-05-27,4,I love this place, always delicious fresh and tasty salads and meals. The sauces are spectacular! I only have a suggestion.. I just ordered a salmon salad with extra toppings and they sent it in a deep narrow plastic bowl .. the greens were like mashed inside , presentation awful for a $27 dish (incl tip and fee)  otherwise, great dish!
2020-05-11,5,Man oh man their food is really great. It's always so fresh. The Mac and cheese is killer. Their rice is always cooked nicely as well. I don't eat meat anymore but when I did, their chicken was the only restaurant's that I enjoyed in town. The staff is always soooo helpful with making choices. They also have some really great unsweetened hibiscus tea. I love this place so much. It's right next to chipotle. Anyone who chooses chipotle over this goodness has no idea what they're missing. This food is awesome.
2020-05-08,1,Very bad service and everything. My friend ordered food for me for good but seriously this is the worst restaurant I can ever imagine. The person who owns the restaurant is very rude and doesn't even care about customers. I already warned all of friends living by. This is not the place you should spend your money and eat. Don't even consider this restaurant they are VERY bad. Support other restaurants that deserve it!!
2020-04-07,1,Ordered, got wrong food. Asked for correction. Wrong again. At least it only cost 50 bucks for two salads. I look forward to robotics advancing to the point that the people that can't do the most basic of functions to no longer be involved in the process.
2020-02-29,3,UPDATE: They refunded me for the order and the owner reached out to me after I left this review to apologize.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Their food is great, but do not order through their website. After ordering a couple times through Uber Eats without any problems, I tried ordering directly on their website with a coupon they had sent in one of the orders through Uber eats. They estimated the delivery to take between 45 minutes to 1 hour, but it took them nearly 2 hours from the time I ordered to deliver it.I called the store asking about it after it was already late and they told me it was out for delivery, nothing else. No apologies or an updated ETA. I called again to ask about it after it was 30 minutes late and someone I spoke to said they would check and call me back, which they did not. When I called a THIRD time, the same guy said the delivery person was "a little late" and my food should arrive in 5 minutes, which it did not. When it finally arrived, although cold, the food tasted great.I understand problems happen and honestly hope their staff is more respectful when dealing with customer complaints.
2020-02-23,5,When you want something light and healthy this is so good! I have been going here since it's opened. I normally go for the Mac and cheese with chicken or steak honey Siracha and horseradish sauce is so good.
2020-02-17,3,The food is alright but way overpriced. I paid $14.95 for that measly piece of salmon which tasted really fishy. I'm giving it three stars just because the brussel sprouts and sweet potato were good. Also the woman at the register was mad rude.
2020-01-24,4,I love this place for lunch and/or dinner! It's like a better version of dig inn!The sides are always delicious and everything seems fresh for the most part. My only gripe is sometimes the salmon portions are a little small. It's always delicious though! Luckily the picture I'm uploading has a nice size piece ;) I also took my parents here and they've given their approval. My mom is very picky and my dad is a big Italian "tony soprano" type. They definitely enjoyed their lunches! In addition, this is a good option for catering. I sent my friend a "quality greens care package" when she recently gave birth knowing she doesn't have time to cook. She loved it!
2020-01-23,1,The people that work there are SOOOOOO rude constantly. Made me not want to go there anymore. It's a shame because the food is good, I just can't stand the impertinent people who look like they would rather be anywhere but there.
2020-01-21,2,the only word i can really use describe this place is "disappointment". when it opened i was really excited because hoboken truly needs a good salad place but this place kinda sucks. way too overpriced for the quality of the food (mediocre).
2020-01-19,4,Love quality greens, great fresh ingredients, wonderful service. My go to is the chefs plate. I love their roasted chicken with sweet potatoes and Brussel sprouts. They have a wide array of food choices wether you are whole30, vegetarian, vegan. Wish there were more locations!
2020-01-13,5,Our whole family loves quality greens! Especially the kids, we love all the tasty and healthy options. The staff is always friendly too. Any chance there will be some high chairs soon? (Fingers crossed :)
2019-12-25,4,Been here several times and I have never been disappointed with any of my orders.  The chicken Cobb salad is amazing and so is the salmon dish which gives you the choice of two sides.  Just thinking about the Cobb salad makes me want to pick one up, yum!!  Worth the aggravation of looking for parking on Washington St. In Hoboken.
2019-11-21,1,The food's actually ok...But I gave it 1 star because the portions are RIDICULOUSLY small. Ordered a chef's plate with salmon, which came with 2 ounces of salmon. For $13 I basically got a fish stick with some rice and veggies. It's a joke.
2019-10-27,4,Unlike a lot of the reviews I saw where they ordered online, I actually went to the store. Large, clean store- very simple, very basic. I ordered a custom salad and it was excellent. Asked for light dressing and they did a pretty good of keeping it light. Nice and varied selection of greens and toppings. Definitely hitting them up again.
2019-10-27,5,I've gotten food at the store and ordered delivery serveral times, and it's always been great. The portion sizes are large and the food is flavorful. I usually get the tofu with brown rice, carrot fries and another side.The carrot fries are a must get! I also love the variety of dipping sauces available. 5 stars for what has become a go to of mine!
2019-10-24,2,You'd think a place with precooked ready to serve food would be quicker, the people behind the counter apparently have time to chit chat instead of taking peoples orders. It really shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to put pre-cut chicken, a scoop of rice, and a scoop of mac and cheese in a bowl and seal it.Food is alright, but two stars for me just sitting there and no one even saying "be with you in a moment, sorry for the wait"
2019-10-04,5,Staff was very friendly. A lady help me and was nice and chatty the entire making my salad. Just started work in the area, and was glad to encounter friendly faces. Salad was great (Tex mex) and they ask how much dressing you want WHICH IS A HUGE PLUS! Variation of Beyoncé was playing the entire time, which was a lovely plus
2019-10-02,3,Been eating their salad twice a week on average since July. 1. Overall good quality ingredients.  2. Dressings are in general fairly overpowering, so drizzle with care. 3. Cooked options, e,g., in chef's plates, a la carte, are in general on the salty and oily side, which presumably most customers would enjoy.4. Quality control is hit or miss. I've had plastic pieces, staples, missing proteins, stale ingredients in my salad. Tried to send feedback over email but never heard back. Still the best salad option in Hoboken. I felt both grateful and remorseful.
2019-09-28,2,This was my favorite place to get a healthy meal in town until today. I went in to get the butternut bliss salad and there was not a single piece of butternut squash in the salad. The employee making my salad clearly had no idea what she was doing, she didn't even know what was the right lettuce to put in my salad. Giving this two stars since if they make the food right it's good, but my salad today was literally missing the main ingredient. And paying $10+ for bad salad is not cool.
2019-09-23,3,I stopped in for lunch to go. The line was really really long! It moved at a decent pace however.You choose your salad and toppings. It was ok. A little pricey but satisfied my salad craving.
2019-08-27,3,i really wanted to like this place but i was so underwhelmed. i had a brown rice bowl with salmon, greek salad, and broccoli. the salmon was okay but the sides fell short and were lacking in flavor. my friend ordered the carrot "fries" as a side and after one bite they were untouched - they were an oily, soggy mess. the icing on the cake was the abrasive employee who helped us. i don't see myself ever coming back here.
2019-08-15,5,Convenient location, friendly staff, and delicious, healthy food. I did the make your own salad, and loved the wide variety of ingredient choices. Every time I'm in town on business, I will be stopping by at least one!
2019-08-12,2,SO SALTY AND OILY! Yuck. Stay away from their carrots . I've come here for lunch a few times and let me just say this food is no good. How can you be a healthy Quality Greens establishment when some basic vegetables dishes are drenched in oil and salt?
2019-08-02,5,Super healthy options at a great price! I come here for a quick bite every so often and the quality of food and service is phenomenal.
2019-07-21,1,Trash. I went there for a chefs plate with chicken quinoa salad and a half avocado. They said I couldn't have avocado that it was only for their salads when their menu stated otherwise. I look over at the salad bar and there were 20 cut avocados right in the food bar. I asked again that they had avocado and they told me again I couldn't have it with quinoa apparently. Rudely may I add by two employees. I'm never trying to come here again. Super annoying. I would've paid extra if needed.
2019-06-16,5,Love coming here for a healthy choice besides fast food, always clean. Quick service.  Love the quinoa and chicken
2019-06-15,4,My boyfriend and I had the Tex mex salad. The portion of the salad was great! The only thing I didn't like about it was the chipotle sauce; I feel like it needed a little bit more flavor. And on the menu the cheese is described as "white cheddar" and they serve you regular cheddar. Don't really understand that part but okay!
2019-06-12,4,I go to quality greens weekly with my coworkers for lunch, and always get the same kale Cesar salad because I'm obsessed with Cesar salads. Quality greens is overall very delicious and their salads are quite large and filling, but even still I find it to be very over priced. I hear the hot bowls are very tasty, and my girlfriends always make their own salads and they absolutely love it. I love how they ask you how heavy you want the dressing, light, medium or heavy. I feel like that's a competitive edge QG has over other salad places. The lettuce and condiments are always fresh, and there's usually a ton of employees working during rush hour so even when the lines nearly out the door it goes quickly. I find quality greens to be a quick and healthy lunch option.
2019-06-12,1,I had terrible experience in this location. One of the staff was so rude and said i wasnt loud enough for her to hear. I always order online but for the first time I dropped in to take a to go. Never coming here ever again.
2019-06-01,3,I've always loved quality greens; however lately it's been ok. Brussel sprouts are no longer in season so they don't have them anymore. Also, not sure if kale is no longer in season but they don't have them either. I got the broccoli and squash medley as my two sides. The broccoli would be great if the stems weren't too long. The quinoa is also a bit dry. The squash/zucchini is ok but wouldn't be my go to side. Maybe offer different sides for the season like cauliflower, sautéed spinach, etc?? Or try and get customer feedback on what sides they want during the summer?
2019-05-15,5,Ordered dinner through Uber eats. The food was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect since it was very "healthy". Really delicious and good for you.
2019-05-02,5,Delicious!!! We ordered on Sunday evening through Uber eats. We ordered 2 steak dinners with sweet potatoes and quinoa. Delicious! Just really nicely done. Portions were a good size. Food was filling. I called prior to ordering to ask questions about sizing food and preparation . Staff was incredibly nice and friendly.  Food was healthy, of high quality, and fresh! I did not taste salt or other harmful ingredients. Will definitely order again! We were very happy with the order and staff.
2019-04-24,2,Quality Greens used to be my go-to, but I'm noticing all of their hot sides are way over oiled and extremely greasy lately. Also, they must have started to use some spice infused olive oil medley. All warm sides are way over oiled/ over spiced/ burned. It hurts my stomach . It's because of this that I wouldn't exactly call the warm veggie sides healthy. Not sure about the other menu options.
2019-04-02,4,This place has a very fresh and sterile feel to it. All of the various types of salad greens and ingredients are on display which is neat. One of the staff members was filling the corn bin with kernels using a corn stripper so it was nice to see that the ingredients really are fresh. I ordered the Butternut Bliss salad which was decent but nothing to rave about. To me, this place feels overpriced for what you get. The space is nice though, friendly staff and there are a lot of options to customize your meal.
2019-04-01,2,Reminds me of Cava set up. You can order either a salad or rice bowl with whatever protein you desire & sides. I got the rice bowl, two options for rice: brown or couscous. I was offered to try only the couscous, so I just went with it. Nicely seasoned & not dry. I got the rosemary grilled chicken & was not dry & tasted good. Those were the only 2 things that tasted great... the 2 sides that were included that I had were overpowering: the maple siracha brussels had what seemed like, in fact, too much sweet chili sauce rather than siracha, and the kale was just not seasoned well. It was not tasty. My friend had the sweet potatoes which were much better than the sides I had.I do not think I will return unfortunately, despite the friendliness of the staff.
2019-03-17,5,My fave salad bar! Always fresh, great variety to make a custom salad and pretty fairly priced, it's a nice place to eat in too. Even in the week during lunch rush you don't have to wait that long to be served.
2019-03-11,4,Long time customer of quality greens. Delicious food, big fan of the umami crunch and chef's plates. One serious concern about the roasted Kale on the menu currently, why is there more garlic than kale? I say the in jest but for a 1/2 cup potion there's at least 4-5 cloves per serving. It's a bit concerning because I think it's a mistake. Second time having it with the level of garlic. Is this normal?
2019-03-11,5,I love this place, and I come here almost every day!  So happy to have Quality Greens in Hoboken!!  However, lately the chef's plate's side "garlic kale" has had so much sand/dirt in it.  I had to throw it out just now because there was so much.  It even even ruined my rice where the kale had been.
2019-03-05,4,Great healthy, delicious lunch spot in Hoboken. 5 stars for food and service! However, I deducted a star because I find it a bit overpriced.
2019-03-03,1,Loved that there was a place like Dig Inn in Hoboken, but the quality and portion size was quite disappointing. The salmon for my quinoa bowl was tiny. There was a piece of hair hiding in the sweet potato, and the maple-Sriracha brussel sprouts were soggy - typical when cooking frozen sprouts - and did not appear to have been roasted but rather charred.
2019-03-01,5,Great place to get a salad in Hoboken. I have gotten the Steakhouse Salad or a custom salad many many times and it has never disappointed. Their sides are all very good too, especially the maple-sriracha brussels sprouts.It's a little pricey for a salad but their portions are very generous. I'm never here during the weekday lunch rush so my experience has always been very good and quick service.
2019-02-24,4,It's definitely a good place to get healthy alternatives around Hoboken. Unfortunately because of its popularity, the wait time to order food and even pick up an order is ridiculously long so it can be a bit of a hassle to go for lunch.Would recommend the Tex Mex Cobb salad and the Chef Plate (steak, rosemary chicken, salmon, tofu or 3 sides). For sides (depending on their seasonal menu) , my go-tos are usually the maple Sriracha Brussel sprouts, caprese salad, carrot fries, and their Mac and cheese.
2019-02-06,4,Quality Greens Kitchen is the best salad workday lunch spot in Hoboken! Think of Quality Greens as a combination of Sweetgreen and Dig Inn. Quality Greens has Market Plates (just like Dig Inn does) and Tossed Salads (just like Sweetgreen does). I almost always get a salad when I visit Quality Greens - my favorite is the Umami Crunch! The Umami Crunch tastes great and is an affordable lunch option to either take back to work or eat in the Quality Greens seating area. The restaurant's has a decent sized seating area, so you could go with a few friends and probably find space to all sit together. Beware: Quality Greens gets super crowded during lunchtime on workdays! Quality Greens is probably the most popular workday lunch spot in Hoboken, so maybe go elsewhere if you are in a rush.
2019-02-05,3,I have ordered from here several times and it is a solid choice for "healthier" delivery. I say "healthier" with the caveat that the sides are overly greasy and salty.  I ordered a side of the curried carrot fries and they were SO salty I spit them out as a reaction.  It was incredibly unpleasant.  My sister in law ordered a side of roasted sweet potatoes and the container that they came in was completely saturated from grease.  The mains including the chicken, salmon, and tofu as well as the salads are usually pretty good.
2019-02-01,2,I had high hopes for this place. We really needed a good salad place in Hoboken. It was great in the beginning. Now, each time i order for delivery, they mess it up. First they left out brussel sprouts. Today, it was the chicken. For $15 a salad, they should atleast include the protein! I will also add that the salad is mostly lettuce..and today, again for $15, my lettuce was days old and brown. I will not be ordering from here again.
2019-01-26,5,Great for a healthy home made feeling meal. Interchangeable sides and mains plus they had salads also
2019-01-25,4,This is my healthy go to lunch/dinner. The reason it's only 4 is the size of the salmon has recently gotten smaller and smaller and the pricing isn't cheap! The roasted sweet potatoes and sirracha Brussels sprouts are always sooo amazing. The way they cook the salmon is consistently good as well- just wish it was a bigger piece for that price $$$
2019-01-16,3,Ordered through Seamless. I got the "Avo Salad" because its star ingredient is - you guessed it - avocado. Guess which ingredient was missing from the salad when it was delivered. I called to let them know, and my 2 options were to get extra avocado next time or to be refunded the cost of the avocado.  I'm a bit unclear how you forget the namesake ingredient. 3 stars because the salad is still good and it came quickly (although not delivered to our door and left at the front desk downstairs). Not likely to order from here again which is a shame since it's one of the few places to get a salad in Hobo.
2019-01-08,2,Ripoff. Order the salmon and you'll see what I mean! Almost a joke how small the portion is for $14!!
2019-01-07,2,Had the Fish Taco signature salad on the seasonal menu. Aside from the sickening medium rare salmon, the salad was somewhat tasteful. The sriracha really spiced up everything. The pickled onions also gave the whole salad a good kick. Other than that, it was nothing special. Probably will not order anything from this place again. Of course I didn't finish it, but that nearly raw salmon had me nauseous.
2018-12-30,2,The food was ok, I guess. I may have made a mistake by getting the chef plate and probably could've been solid getting a salad. After all, how can you mess up lettuce, tomato, salad dressing. Anyway, the food in the chef plate was basically "cafeteria food". Overly salty and oily. The cooked kale and cooked carrots were like drinking a bottle of straight canola oil *glug glug glug*. But thats ok, theres worse stuff. And the bowl was kinda padded out by an excessive amount of quinoa.But the real problem was that these people WEIGH OUT the chicken breast that goes in the bowl with a little scale. Like the type of scale you would measure your organic chemistry yield in college (or that a villain in Miami Vice would use to measure 'product') Such a bad look. The guy takes a whole chicken breast, then slices it up and puts a couple lil slices in the scale and then puts it in the bowl. SO stingy. If I'm paying almost 11 bucks for basically an entree, don't be all mosquito's tuchus on the portion.Even 'evil' McDonalds gives a whole chicken breast on their chicken sandwich, and I took it for granted. Sad stuff.Now the skeptics may say "oh thats not so bad". Well, when I saw the whole piece coming out, I anticipated a whole piece like a normal place. ANALOGY ALERT: This is like when a woman on a hot date invites you in "for coffee" and you literally just drink coffee...And then she gives you only like half a cup. The owner will prob be like "but chicken is expensive wahhh wahh". No its not. I buy packs of WHOLE chicken breasts and its like 4.99 for 5 of them. It's like $2.50 a pound. (Sometimes if its on sale for cheaper). So, you guys prob get them in bulk from the wholesaler even cheaper than that. If you start giving whole chicken breasts, it'll feel more natural. And....i'll come back if you do!
2018-12-28,5,I cannot count the amount of times my office and I have eaten here at the Hoboken location, but consistently the best health option in the neighborhood. I work and live in Hoboken, so eating out is a hobby of mine for sure. Quality Greens does not disappoint, some may say its an expensive salad, pricey, yes, but the portions are outrageous. I cook a lot, and no doubt this place uses top ingredients. The customizability of there dishes, provides for a different meal every visit. During busy hours, when ordering online, I do recommend not showing  up at the time, when they say your meal will be ready, for obvious reasons, they are a very busy location, and a wait can be expected, but nonetheless worth the wait.
2018-12-05,4,It's hard to find a good "just salad" place in New Jersey that's comparable to Chopped in New York. Quality Greens comes close. Went recently for the first time and was pleased with the selection. I only wish they had more signature salads for the indecisive person ... I had a Kale Caesar. The salads are made to order and the ingredients are fresh. The Cesar dressing was amazing. The salad was plentiful as well. I had no complaints. They also have bowls with your choice of protein and sides . I'll be back for those !
2018-12-04,1,This place used to be amazing until....1) the prices are jacked up Uber eats..... what, why? There is no justification for this. 2) at least 1/2 of the orders have skimped on meat and sides. They used to give a normal amount, now it's the equivalent of rabbit portions3) meat is ALWAYS over done4) customer service, this is paramount because it is absolutely horrible. I have encountered a few nice and patient employees who swiftly disappear. They are disinterested and ignore customers when they literally ask for help.5) the African American woman who I believe is a cook of something is especially rude. She talks down to everyone and basically has the "not my problem!!!" Attitude. 6) orders take far too long from Uber eats but what else is new. Whatever, you guys suck now.
2018-12-03,5,The find of the year! Stumbled on to this place and am so thrilled to have another great option in our rotation. Delicious, healthy, organic options that arrive plated akin to what you'd find in a nice restaurant, all for a very reasonable price. So happy to have something new and different in the neighborhood (or at least new to me!) and will continue to add this to the repertoire on repeat.
2018-12-02,1,Ordered on grub hub. Delivery was fast but there was about two bites of avocado in my Avo salad and the tortillas were soggy. Am a little disappointed that I paid $12 for a bowl of kale.
2018-12-02,4,Decided to come here after had a week of heavy meals. I got a salad with salmon, it was very fresh and tasty. It was a lot of food and I felt very full after. I would come back again to try the other items.
2018-11-29,5,Yummy good for your soul food. I usually have to warm it up though as it arrives not piping hot but that's ok. I just wish they delivered with napkins and cutlery as I just moved house and everything is packed away. I spent an hour looking for a fork and instead have resorted to eating my meal with a wooden spoon.
2018-11-15,5,If you're tired of ubiquitous "bar food," and/or are looking to get your appetite and waistline back to reality, this is the place to go!Great selections of steak, salmon, and other delectable for your salad, with a knowledgeable staff to offer suggestions.Whether you eat in, take out, or have it delivered, you won't be disappointed!
2018-11-07,2,Food is fantastic, quality is great and always well prepared. Nice variety and some seasonal options are always available.However! Nearly EVERY SINGLE TIME we order, at least 1 of our "Chef's Bowls" is without the requested sauce. You'd think it's a trivial thing and maybe it is. But some of us order the meals SPECIFICALLY because we like the flavor combo with the sauce. Tonight my nice steak bowl arrived without the horse radish. And again I debate not ordering out anymore from them, because unless I'm there to demand the sauce in person it invariably does not show up.
2018-11-07,5,Ordered roasted chicken w quinoa, miso kale, and sweet potatoes delivered via Grubhub... not only did it come early but it tasted completely homemade and delicious... will definitely be my new go to place!
2018-10-30,3,This place was okay. The food was good but not amazing. The music is super loud and the energy feels super tense and hectic. Good price though for healthy food.
2018-10-25,3,I have enjoyed Quality Greens in the past but was disappointed today.  We ordered delivery for our family and tried the salmon for the first time.  (Previously I had only had the chicken.)  The portions of fish were ridiculously small.  My 4yo polished his off in a couple of minutes and immediately asked for more.So, don't bother paying the upcharge for the salmon!  I felt ripped off!
2018-10-23,4,Was so glad when this place opened because we needed something like this in Hoboken!  I've yet to try their salad but the chef's plates are delicious, particularly with the steak.  Most places like this overcook steak badly, but Quality Greens has a perfect pink medium rare every time.
2018-10-20,5,Wow, far exceeded my expectations!  Ordered for the first time from here (off of their website), the food came within the allotted time and everything was beyond delicious!  The quality of the food is so good and nothing lacked in flavor.  Ordered several sides, and literally enjoyed all of them. Portions were big, prices reasonable, not one negative to say. Will definitely be ordering from here again (got to come in person as well).
2018-10-14,3,We ordered takeout and surprisingly it came 20 minutes earlier than the projected time. Our food however was cold which I'm not sure how that works. The GF Mac and cheese was pretty good as well as the kale and brown rice. The steak and roasted chicken was very dry as they do not provide any sauce for the meal. This was our first time trying QGK and not quite sure that we would try it again. Pictured with the steak you will see sweet potatoes and citrus beets (which I wasn't too fond of)
2018-10-02,1,Three ounces of salmon for my salad really??? Also while the food is always on the border of decent the staff is always slow and yelling at each other.Update the owner responded with a review that speaks for its self...every time I have visited it takes no less than 10 minutes from start to finish for my salad to be prepared....usually after waiting 5 minutes to be served in an empty establishment...that is a very long time to wait. Additionally, I mentioned that the staff constantly yells at each other because they do and no it is not because they are at the other end of a large establishment. The most recent encounter was when they were yelling or speaking very loudly and debating who would mop and where the bucket and mop were located. If the staff is yelling about cleaning it makes you wonder.... I also find it quit curious that Steven referred to my review as "overly defensive" when I am simply giving my experience. thanks for your feedback quality greens ownership : )
2018-10-01,3,Amazing food and good prices. Only reason for 3 stars is the service. Everyone is very nice but the wait is exponentially longer than similar "pick and choose/grab and go" restaurants. They always seem to have ten people on staff but quite often only one person is helping the customers build their meal. I would also like to add that I went around 8 pm, which I have done multiple times before. The wait time is significantly longer than as opposed to peak hours such as lunch time, even though there are more people at lunch time. I know they take pride in their quality and organization, but there has to be a more efficient way to reduce the lag time between customers.
2018-09-19,5,Quality Greens is delicious!  I have been getting lunch delivered for corporate meetings and getting such positive feedback.  Steven is a joy to work with and always helping me find the best way to make everyone in the meeting happy.  We will continue coming to Quality Greens!! Thank you all :)
2018-09-05,2,This review is based on delivery only! I have ordered delivery twice and both times it was super late! The first time I just figured it was a one time thing. The second time I called. The person who answered was disinterested and seemed confused. He then said... "well you live farther than Hoboken... we have to deliver to Hoboken first." Um... then why deliver to my area at all? Why give an estimated time if it doesn't matter because Hoboken addresses get pushed before others. When the food arrived it was ice cold. We had to heat up all of it! Let me tell ya... no one wants to microwaved steak and gluten free Mac and Cheese that they just ordered! You shouldn't have to heat up delivery food. When we called back to say the food was cold... another bored sounding employee answered. After telling her the food was cold she said "oh... ok... well we can refund you $7 dollars..." Cool. So we spent $50 on cold food and 5.99 for delivery that was late and we got $7 dollars back. That doesn't seem like great customer service to me. And I've worked in the service industry so I'm not just some brat who doesn't understand how restaurants work. It's a shame because the food is pretty decent. And it's a good concept. In conclusion... don't order take out unless you like cold Mac and Cheese and don't expect anyone who works there to be helpful. Bummed but will not be ordering from there again.
2018-08-30,5,I love the kale caesar!! Nice big portion. Staff is always very polite and efficient.
2018-08-29,4,My husband and I love this place. The food is so fresh and yummy. We always get the same items. Which is a a big beautiful managoat salad and a salmon platter, with veggies and brown rice. I will say we were very disappointed with the size of the salmon. Usually it is a decent size and we share it. Not super big, but big enough. Tonight when we went all the portions were about 3 inches. We both ordered our own and it still was not enough.Almost $8.00 to add another portion. Please management go back to the original size! We always appreciate that the staff is always friendly and accommodating. Definitely a must try!
2018-08-28,4,Finally a "healthy" restaurant that gives decent portions and doesn't break my wallet!! Pleasantly surprised. Quality Greens Kitchen offers both rice bowls and salads at a competitive price for Hoboken. It's nice to finally get a place that offers healthier options that isn't a million dollars. I got the hang beef as my protein ($13.50) and was surprised that it wasn't over cooked and actually quality beef. I'm interested to try the salmon as well (they give a whole filet!) The chef bowl also comes with two sides. I got the kale with onions and the sweet potatoes which were both tasty. Took a star off because I would have liked some more options (especially for delivery). The drinks were also not very good. I'd want to come back to give their salads a try!
2018-08-18,5,Awesome option for takeout, even in the food desert part of Jersey City - my neighborhood, McGinley Square. This will be my new go-to place. Fast, fresh and delicious!
2018-08-12,4,Very healthy option. I ordered Avo signature salad, it's a good mix of different greens w avocado. It's very similar to Chop't.
2018-07-25,2,The food was alright . But if you call yourself quality greens kitchen , get some staff who are educated on how many calories your salads have or better put it on your menu!
2018-07-22,5,Great healthy kitchen in town with plenty of space for family or friends, they have plenty of gluten free options from cookies to entrees or delicious soft served fruit   $5.75. I ordered the wild salmon grilled marinated in dill and caper oil $13.50 served over rice or quinoa. They have vegetarian options, they take cash or credit and have bathrooms available. There is bike and parking outside.  They also sell Kombucha or cold press juices so they are very health oriented as you can see their menu. They also do catering just have to ask.
2018-07-17,5,Got the chefs plate with chicken, sweet potatoes, broccoli and the ginger soy dressing. Everything was delicious!!! Wish I lived nearby so I could go again.
2018-07-05,5,The staff is wonderful, I get lunch for numerous people at my job from them at least once a week, sometimes twice.  Big orders and the quality of the food is always 5 Stars!!!  Try their Kale Caesar WOW!  Silvana
2018-07-02,5,Delicious and nutritious.  So fantastic to have a healthy option in town. I had the roasted chicken and quinoa with sweet potato and kale as sides.  The salads looked really good too.  Portions were plentiful.
2018-06-29,5,I can't say enough great things about this place. The custom salads are huge and they're so delicious. The produce and veggies are so fresh. The quinoa bowls are yummy and everything is cooked so healthy that you don't feel any guilt. Highly recommend!
2018-06-29,5,I walk past this place several times a week and always see it's busy. I'm not much of a person to try to new restaurants, but I decided to try it. Now I'm hooked to it, its healthy eating for my diet. But at the same time the food is incredibly delicious!!!!! Great atmosphere, wonderful staff, and good food that'll make me come back again.
2018-06-29,5,I was highly recommended to this place from a family member. I Had to try it out and it was better then expected. Amazing food, great service, and I'm definitely coming back. I definitely recommend this place.
2018-06-27,1,Foods decent, really awkward when the staff is all yelling at each other and screaming.  Waited 15 minutes for my order when no one was there and they had over 10 people working.
2018-06-26,3,Pretty good with lots of options. I got the salmon, quinoa, broccoli, and sweet potatoes and it was pretty good overall. This was my first time going and I'll go back. The only reason why it wasn't more stars is that the price compared to quality and size of the salmon was not even. The salmon was very small.
2018-06-22,4,The location is great, plenty of staff,helpful and quick.Modern/rustic interior, clean & good vibeall around.  Lots of dude's picking up orders for two, always a good sign.Varied menu, salads & food food, nice selection of drinks including my favorite kombucha, GTS Trilogy.I ordered the TexMex salad with chicken, hold the corn & chipotle dressing.My salad could have had more stuff ... or less lettuce.  Next time I'll build my own.My friend ordered the wild caught salmon with roasted veggies & a side of kale with avocado & edamame. We drank water.Everything was fresh and visually appealing. The total bill came to $30We will return.
2018-06-12,5,decided to check out this place for lunch and was thoroughly impressed! i had the avo salad with steak on top. it was delicious! pretty pricey, i'll give you that but it did not disappoint :)
2018-06-04,5,So happy I found this place. I love that each time I go I can always mix it up and get something new. Sides are amazing!! Everything is so yummy and delicious.
2018-06-02,4,Ive came here twice!! ive tried the platters both chicken and salmon. Let me just say if you're debating which to get... GET THE SALMON. omg so delish. The flavor was extremely good. The chicken for me personally didnt have much flavor sadly:( But the salmon was amazing. The price is decent for the location . Their portions are also decent. But the food is so good so i will definitely be coming back. I got greens with salmon sweet potatoes and avocado. the sweet potatoes are to die for . AMAZINGGGG. Will definitely be coming up:)
2018-05-26,4,The salad I had was really good... I didn't particularly care for the dressing but that was my choice and they have other really great options.  I ended up getting a few sides... Macaroni and cheese, and also brussel sprouts. Brussels sprouts are really good because they had a little kick to them.  I don't know that the portions were worth the price for the size but I would say get the brussels sprouts if you're going to get a side! Overall I had a good experience here... The place is clean and has lots of options for everyone
2018-05-24,5,First time here and I'm glad I decided to stop in. It's so hard finding a place that's healthy and good. I must say I love it. My servers was very nice and smiled the whole entire time, which I love. I tried the Avo salad with chicken and it was amazing... I definitely will be back..
2018-05-22,4,I really love this place for delivery. They have a really healthy set of dishes and I never feel like I'm over indulging. I've had the steak with quinoa, and sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts are spicy, and a little over sauces. The chicken definitely isn't my favorite, it can get a little dry. They could use a few more options on delivery.
2018-05-18,5,Stopped here for lunch with my daughter yesterday!! Food is so fresh and amazing. Beautiful restaurant. Very efficient! I had the salmon with brown rice, maple Siracha Brussels sprouts and the sweet potatoe!! Everything on point! I highly recommend this restaurant if your looking for something delicious and healthy!!! Bravo!!!
2018-05-16,5,I don't know how I missed this place for so long. Fresh ingredients. Super friendly staff. Portions are good for the price. Tasty and fast!
2018-05-06,5,Super impressed with everything, especially for takeout. Was expecting tiny portions, messy packaging, dry or overly cooked meat. Complete opposite! Moving to Hoboken soon so I can't wait to be more of a frequent visitor! Ordered the Mac &Cheese, loved that the onkly option is gluten free, smart. Ordered the Herb marinated steak bowl with brussels(sooooo good!) and the sweet potatoes over salad. Must get the chive sauce for the steak!!Boyfriend got the TexMex Cobb and it tasted similar to a ByChloe salad, big portion!Will 100% return!!
2018-05-04,2,I really wanted to love this place but both salads we ordered were so bland. Inhad the steak salad. The horseradish chive dressing had no flavor and the steak was cooked completely through unfortunately. I felt like I paid 12.50 for what was mostly salad greens.The other salad we tried was the texmex and it too lacked any real flavor.Such a bummer because their Instagram account had me dying to try it.
2018-05-03,5,This is my favorite place for healthy and fresh delivery. The selection is limited but the food is consistently delicious.
2018-04-26,4,Got the Avo GF/Vegan salad to go last night; skipped the romaine and got kale-only. It was really good, and I would definitely try it again! The only reasons that I didn't give 5 stars are trivial: first, the kale wasn't chopped very well and I felt like I was consuming a large, pokey leaf at times. Also, since it was to go, there was a minuscule side of the avocado chimichurri dressing to pour on top, which wasn't nearly enough (which is saying something, since I am NOT a dressing aficionado). In all, would definitely recommend, especially for the price ($8.99) of this decently-sized salad. I'll return soon and hopefully have a 5-star experience to report back on.
2018-04-22,5,I've always been skeptical of the salad-focused fast casual restaurant ever since an ill-fated trip to a Saladworks. However, with so many salad places stepping uptheir game, from Chopt to Sweetgreen, I had to finally try one for myself.Went to Quality Greens Kitchen for a late lunch; it turned out that they were vendors as part of the annual Hoboken Wellness Crawl. With that in mind, the staff was offering samples of their non-greens products, including gluten free mac and cheese, roasted veggies, sriracha tofu, chicken, and steak. I tried the mac and cheese and the sriracha tofu. The tofu was nicely spiced and flavorful, while the mac and cheese tasted homemade. I would not have noticed the gluten free elements! Amazing!As for my standard salad order, I chose the Balsamic Blue, and it turned out to be a solid choice. The greens (mescalun and arugula) were fresh and crisp, with yummy fruit and nuts from walnuts to craisins to apples. The blue cheese was not too chunky or too pungent, and the vinaigrette was balanced and acidic. Overall, I'm thrilled that I've finally found a place close to me that has truly made salads great again! Would highly recommend!
2018-04-19,5,One of the best organic healthy eat spots around Hoboken/NYC! Great taste, awesome service
2018-04-16,4,Shout out to Derek!! He's got great customer service and really made my day when I came in. Keep up the awesome work.  Food is great and love the location too!!
2018-04-15,5,Finally- a quick, healthy place that makes quality food  with good value for your money! Tried the chicken and salmon bowls-- the chicken was my favorite. Plentiful portion and it just tasted fresh. Try the Brussels sprouts- so good! The cauliflower is ok but I probably wouldn't order it again. Caesar salad is also good- has a kale base.I was literally full for 24 hours from eating a bowl. Definitely will return!  Highly recommend for a satisfying and healthy meal.
2018-04-10,5,This place is on point. Large portions, healthy (yet flavorful) eats, and a good price point. A welcomed addition to Hoboken!
2018-04-10,3,Great salads however the staff is extremely rude and unfriendly. As a Hoboken resident I have gone several times and on multiple occasions I felt like I am bothering the staff. Would recommend delivery since going in makes you second guess why you even went.
2018-04-09,5,i order a custom salad every time and they make it perfectly im so shocked i found a good place to eat at thats healthy bless up
2018-03-20,3,Food is always good. Love their customs salads and all the options. Why am I giving them 3 stars? Because their service is terrible. Every single employee looks like they hate their lives there. Not a single smile, not a single thank you, just throw your food in front of you and move on. Customer service goes a long way. If they don't want to work then don't work. Change up the employees because that experience I had sucked.
2018-03-12,5,My son 9 years old had built his own bowl with Arugula, chickpeas, black beans, corn, raw mushroom, wonton strips and roasted chicken. And he loved it!! I have the salmon quinoa bowl and plenties of vegetables. My husband had the kale caesar salad. It was all wonderful. As I always teach my kids "Eat the Rainbow!!" This is definitely the place!!! All the veggies are fresh!! The only thing I would say is I hope the quinoa would be cooked with less salt. Otherwise, all healthy choices, place is clean, service is excellent!! People who serves there all wear a beautiful smile!! My daughter loves watching them cutting the fresh veggies through the glass window too!!
2018-03-11,2,This is the third time my wife and I orderd from Quality Greens, a healthy option we have been excited about. However, each time we have ordered from here, something was left out of our salads. When you're starving and recieve your delivery that you have been so ready for, only to find that its missing an item, its not likely you feel like waiting another 20+ mins for your last ingredient. This time (tonight) my wife ordered the goat cheese salad with a side of chicken. There were only 3 pieces of chicken, which I understand when restaurants are stingy with the avocado, but chicken???? There also was no goat cheese (the main attraction, i.e Goat Cheese Salad). Is the food tasty? Yes. Are the people nice when we have called in the past? Yes. But unfortunately it seems that we can't rely on them to deliver our meal completed. Typically I don't like to complain, but this time given my wifes dissapointment I felt compelled to do so.
2018-03-06,5,My colleagues and I just ordered to our office in Jersey City.. we've been searching for a good place to order from for the past two years since we re-located from NYC.... We've FINALLY found the place! Quality Greens Kitchen was awesome! Everything was so fresh and delicious. Some of us got salads some got plates and sides....everything we got was great! We would highly recommend!
2018-03-05,5,I really enjoy the salad selections from this place. I also really like their warm options. This is a perfect choice for when you don't have the time or feel like cooking something healthy. Thanks for being open till 10 ish and the staff are extremely friendly! The salmon is very delicious
2018-02-26,5,This place is great for vegetarians and vegans! I can be picky when it comes to tofu, but the tofu here is spot on - especially topped with that delicious maple sriracha sauce. Though I cannot yet vouch for the salads, the chefs plate is delicious. Warm roasted veggies and tofu on top of a bed of quinoa - mmm mmm! I'll be back.
2018-02-25,5,Finally, a place in Hoboken with lots of vegetarian options!! The chefs plate vegetable trio is great! The maple sriracha Brussels sprouts are to die for!! (And I am not a huge fan of Brussel sprouts) the staff is always very friendly and the food is always fresh!! So much better than Honey Grow....
2018-02-23,5,OK giving this gem 5 starts because PRAISE GODNEY, Hoboken finally has solid, custom, quality salad options. For a short period I actually worked AND lived in Hoboken and lunch was always a struggle - good salads were often overpriced and not at all what I was used to having had access to Chop't, Sweetgreen, and Just Salad in the city.I thought about giving 4 stars because despite having 10+ people working at any one time, as the only person in the store I will sometimes wait over 10 minutes before I can even place my order, but I think it's worth it. I've learned to order ahead for pickup using GrubHub on my walk from the PATH home.My go to - salmon market plate w/ brown rice, roasted sweet potato, and maple sriracha brussels (I now have found a hack to make this at home - soOoOo delish) + side tzatziki and sriracha.
2018-02-15,5,Wow best lunch spot ever. Super fresh and tasty, and in addition very healthy. I need need Tom where more often, the chicken and tofu is just outstanding.
2018-02-07,5,I was a skeptic but was PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. We both had the roasted chicken with brown rice, sweet potato. I got caprese as my other side and the fiancé had brussel sprouts which were all amazing. The chicken was not even a little dry and if I'm not mistaken it was brined beforehand. Perfectly seasoned. This was an identitcal version of Digg Inn. Huge competition for them.
2018-02-06,4,Huge fan of this Quality Greens! Felt like good, fresh and healthy options were lacking on Washington St. and I was pleasantly surprised to see this Dig Inn-type fast casual spot open up. The inside is very spacious and immaculate with ample seating for in-store dining. They're open seven days a week and do delivery via Seamless, and market themselves on their "craft salads, quality meats and creative vegetable dishes." If those are their key messages, then they're hitting all of them! They also are very vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free friendly to all my health bunnies out there. Also, they serve Chloe's soft serve fruit ice cream!! They have an array of salad options from SIGNATURE SALADS ranging from $8.99 to $13.50, and CUSTOM SALADS, which start at a base price of $7. Notably, there is a CHEF'S PLATE, which I ordered, and it is most similar to a Dig Inn-style platter. It includes a protein and two sides - I ordered the wild sushi-grade SALMON ($13.50) which came with a delicious tzatziki sauce, as well as a HALF AVOCADO and MAPLE-SRIRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS. The Brussels sprouts were unique and delicious, sweet with a little bit of a kick, but not too spicy. I also ordered a side of the MAC & CHEESE, which was tasty and creamy - loved the combination of the bechamel, cheddar, swiss and parm cheeses. My whole meal came out to about a little less than $15, which is pretty pricey for lunch, but the quality and taste of the food made it worth it.Everyone working had a great attitude and was very responsive to all the questions I had. Even though I do wish it was a little cheaper, I highly recommend this spot and will be returning.
2018-02-02,5,YUM! Really well executed place. I normally make my own salad but stopped in here hungry with nothing in the fridge at home. I got the Ali salad with tofu. I think I will tell them to skip the tortilla chips next time but otherwise the salad was great. The woman who helped me was very helpful and personal especially when putting the salad dressing on bit by bit because I loathe too much dressing. I can't wait to try it again. I am really glad that a salad place like this is finally in Hoboken and very close to my place!
2018-01-27,5,For whatever reason, I can't leave this review on Seamless so am leaving it on Yelp. I rarely review any business, positively or negatively, but wanted to share some great customer service. I placed an online order with them but never received it. They actually reached out to verify whether I had received my order because they weren't sure it had been delivered. It hadn't, so they apologized and sent it out for free even though I had already been refunded by Seamless. This was without me even asking and I'm also not a frequent orderer from there since I had only ordered once before. I was a bit hangry when they called but the owner seemed really committed to "making it right" even after I told him I had zero plans to leave a negative online review. Oh and the food is legit delicious. Historically I have stopped after work at SweetGreen to pick up a salad, but Quality Inn's salmon is tastier than sg's trout + it's on my way home. I'm going to split my business from now on. The prices are in line with what I have paid at Dig Inn and sweetgreen. It is expensive to order but that's the case in Hoboken as a whole and has nothing to do with this restaurant in particular. I find that the serving sizes on the salads at Quality Greens to be very generous and can be split over two meals (for me). Overall a nice business that I plan to support.
2018-01-20,4,Quality greens is a great addition to Washington St. The concept is like if dig inn and sweet green met and had a baby it would be quality greens. The food quality is great, the staff are super nice and it's really healthy. I've only been a couple of times but my boyfriend goes a lot more. He mentioned that once while he was waiting for more salmon they overcooked their newest batch (which we have all done before) and apologized and asked if he wanted to wait for another batch or get something else. I've definitely been to restaurants where they'll just serve you the overcooked salmon so this is a sign of how much they believe in quality. My go to is their salmon chef plate with mixed greens and two sides. The portions are good and I'm not left hungry like I am at dig inn.The place is also always clean. Check them out if you haven't already.
2018-01-08,5,Sooooo good. The chicken is so moist and delish. Had the spicy Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes and quinoa and all really good. Great salads too.
2018-01-05,1,I wanted to like this place and so I gave it 5 tries before writing a review.  It's been consistently pretty bad in many ways.  The only good thing is that the chicken, which is the protean I usually get, is cooked well - not dry but not undercooked.  Aside from that, I don't really have anything good to say about this place.  The sides are usually overcooked and terrible, particularly the mac and cheese which has been so overcooked there is no cheese left and it's just a dry, mushy, inedible mess.The way they handle the lines are also a big problem.  They make everyone wait in 1 long line even though there are separate counters for the salad and the hot food.  It always causes confusion and delays.  On top of all of that, they charge way too much for what you get.  A small amount of chicken with some poorly cooked sides shouldn't cost $13.
2018-01-02,2,Could be way better after coming here 3 times....Visits:1. Wasn't memorable2. Mac and cheese was way too salty, almost inedible3. Umami crunch salad was either under dressed or not dressed at all, can't really tell.. probably easier if they let people see how much dressing they're applying and tell them "when" than the whole light,medium, heavy question...Healthy options are limited but I hope this place improves.
2018-01-02,4,We were in search of some quick takeout for an enjoyable evening of dinner and movies, when I instantly thought of the new Quality Greens Kitchen.  I had walked into the restaurant just after it had opened in order to grab a menu.  I was thrilled to see that they had been focused on healthy ingredients and superior meats, making me eager to try it.  So, this was the perfect occasion.  While my friend built his own salad, I wanted a warmer option to soothe me on that cold evening, so I decided to build a Chef's Plate instead.  Each platter started with a choice of brown rice, quinoa, or greens.  I decided to use a mix of quinoa and kale for my base.  I then opted to skip the protein and do a Vegetable Trio, for which I selected three warm sides.  The Roasted Sweet Potatoes were cubed and dressed in a spiced olive oil that seemed like it had been infused with what might have been paprika.  The Brussels Sprouts had been marinated in a house-made maple Sriracha dressing and baked to a crispy brown.  The Roasted Curry Cauliflower florets had been tossed with chickpeas for added texture.  All three vegetable varieties were nutritious and flavorful, each with their own balance of sweet and spicy flavors.  The brussels were a bit oily, but were terrific regardless.In fact, I enjoyed my satisfying meal so much that I revisited for lunch only a few days later, ordering almost exactly the same meal, but selecting all greens instead of incorporating quinoa.  Quality Greens Kitchen offered a quick and healthy addition to the neighborhood, catering to both the local college students and the mature diners trying to maintain their fit lifestyles.
2017-12-19,5,Walked by this joint the other day. Brand New and my wife and I checked it out. At first I thought, "Another salad place, okay" But then I discovered their Chef's Plates. Pick a grilled protein (Steak, Salmon, Tofu, Chicken) and then pick amongst two of their really flavorful sides. Personal favorites include the Sriracha Brussel Sprouts and Curry Cauliflower. You also get a choice if you want it over rice and Quinoa. I've now been there twice in the same week because I found myself enjoying it that much. I've tried both the Salmon (get the tzatziki on top) and the Steak (with the horseradish sauce on the side)  and both times I've been both full and pleasantly surprised on how flavorful everything is. It's a little on the more pricey side, expect it to be around $15-$20 per person with a drink but it's a really good meal. My wife and I both had a meal and a drink for around $35.
2017-12-02,5,Fantastic experience at Quality Greens! Ate here last Tuesday with my friend who was in town for Thanksgiving. We were just looking for a small snack before meeting some folks for dinner, and didn't know what to expect.Felt welcomed instantly, Veronica greeted us and made us feel right at home and instantly found ourselves chatting about very important topics such as sriracha sauce.Since we said it was our first time here she went over the menu for us. It turned out that not only were we new to the restaurant, but that the restaurant was in fact new to Hoboken, and had only been open one or two weeks. Despite this, the food was fantastic and we found them to be extremely organized and helpful, including during peak hours. (This trip was during an off hour, but I ate there again this week in the middle of the lunch rush, and it was equally fantastic).We were very impressed as many of the features of higher-end dining yet at a build-your-own salad / chef's bowl style restaurant, where you order at the counter. Despite a casual restaurant's vibe, we were able to sample one of the chef's sides since we were indecisive, and Veronica gave us a sample of their specialty smoked sriracha sauce which she highly recommended.What we ordered:"Rosemary Roasted Chicken" Chef's Plate, which includes choice of brown rice or quinoa plus two sides.  The most obvious aspect of the more "gourmet" side of this restaurant, was where were the proteins? After plating our sides, normally there is a big bowl of each protein option to add on top of our order, but we did not see any such thing. Instead, the rosemary roasted chicken is grilled chicken breast sliced to order, leaving it super tender and juicy instead of drying out like at other restaurants. This may not be obvious at first glance, but you will taste the difference. At another restaurant during peak hours the quality difference is less pronounced since they are constantly making a fresh batch to keep up with the orders, but get there at an off hour it will have been sitting out for hours! The difference is well worth it and I think this is a great improvement that the Quality Greens folks have come up with.For our two sides, we first sampled the Sauteed Squash Medley and Macaroni and Cheese, both of which were perfectly seasoned and complete on their own. We settled on the Maple-Sriracha Brussels Sprouts, were grilled and slightly charred with a sweet and slightly spicy sauce that was very flavorful, and the Roasted Sweet Potatoes, were roasted till soft and had paprika and a sweet sauce, though did not taste overly sweetened.Compared to the overall high prices in this area, we got a generous portion of chicken, plus a grain, plus two sides for just $11.50. Good value!Note: their sriracha sauce is not your classic sriracha you are used to, but I highly recommended it! It is made in-house and has the added hint of maple syrup, along with a slight smoky flavor.I think there are a few small areas to be improved, which I will write in an update for my second visit, but overall 5 stars. Food quality fantastic, staff was awesome, and reasonably priced.
2017-12-01,5,Love these guys!  Salads are so fresh and custom made. Choose from proteins such as salmon, steak or chicken, but the salads are so good without these things. Great addition to Washington Street.
2017-11-30,5,I'm coming out of Yelp retirement to share how much I have enjoyed my experiences at Quality Greens. I've had both dine-in and takeout, and all of the food I've had has been fresh and delicious--especially the salmon with tzatziki sauce and the maple sriracha brussel sprouts. It's shocking that the quality is so good for the price. Plenty of stroller room, so it's a very mom-friendly place to go. I was a little disappointed by the lack of a changing station at my first visit, but I sent an email, got a speedy response, and the management has already installed a sturdy changing table in the bathroom. Hooray! Totally great for little ones (and their moms).And I just realized they have delivery! Looks like they'll be collecting more of my money soon...
2017-11-26,5,Finally a quick healthy option comes to Hoboken! Great salad with really fresh ingredients. Was most impressed by the friendly staff!
2017-11-25,5,I cannot say enough good things about Quality Greens.  They make some of the best food in Hoboken.My favorite item is the chef's plate with salmon.  They use a sushi grade wild salmon which they cook to a perfect medium-well.  For sides, their sweet potatoes, curried cauliflower and Mac and cheese are all terrific.Their salads also look phenomenal, but I love the chef's plates so much, I stick with those.We are lucky to have this place in our city.  My intuition tells me they will be expanding this fantastic concept in the near future.
2017-11-21,4,Finally had a chance to check out this new Hoboken spot.  Quality Greens Kitchen offers lunch and dinner, from salads to full meal plates.The restaurant is very large with lofted ceilings. There are about 30 tables comfortably spaced. Seriously, they could have squeezed in another twenty tables, so if you go on the off hours, it's about as relaxed a casual dining set up as you'll get.  It's a cafeteria line set up and you can see everything going on in the kitchen. The offerings are basically two categories. First, salads that start at $7 with a wide variety of included toppings and extra-cost options. The other, a Chef's Plate consisting of a protein, rice or quinoa, and two sides and starts at $11.50.  I went for the Chef's plate with salmon ($13.50), brown rice, brussel sprouts, and mac&cheese (I know, cheater!).  The salmon was a modest portion, about 1/4 lb, skin-on filet that was cooked nicely. I'm glad I got the tztaziki on the side because I didn't care for it. The brussel sprouts were excellent, roasted and charred with a splash of sweet and spice. The mac & cheese was good but needed a little salt and pepper to pick it up.  The brown rice was cooked perfect. The lemon juice soda for $2.50, well, I know it's a healthy place, but honestly a Diet Coke would have been just fine. About $17 for everything.I have to also mention the nice staff, efficient and courteous.  I'd say I had a good first visit, 3 1/2-4 stars and I look forward to trying a few different dishes and updating the review.
2017-11-12,5,Food was very fresh and had great flavor. Loved the cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. Great selection of salad ingredients. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Steak was cooked perfectly.
2017-11-11,4,I was excited to hear a place like this had opened in Hoboken as I typically eat a salad with protein for dinner each night and have had little time to prepare things myself given the workload at work.  As a result, I went to Quality Greens on the first Monday it had opened and was impressed with the organization and quality given its newness.  I really enjoyed my salad and have returned multiple times each week.  The staff is friendly and give off the vibe of being a small business rather than a large salad chain like chop't.  I like the fact that they offer wild salmon rather than farm-raised and am looking forward to trying it.  I vacillated between a 4 and 5 on my rating.  Since it's a new business, hopefully, it remains consistently high quality and gets even better.
2017-11-08,3,More like 3.5 starsGreat for quick lunch/dinnerPlace looks clean, they did great job with the decor.Food taste great and healthyThey have chef plate dishes and salads. I tried salad both time I was here.I ordered one of their signature salad, umami crunch. When I got home( I ordered to go) realized they forgot the edamame. Overall it's still good, love the chicken and the wonton strips.You can build your own salad, but plus with the protein and the crunch price can added way up. Really wish that they can added quinoa without charge extra ( sweetgreen spoiled me, I know), here it's extra $1.50Service could be faster, but since they just opened, I think its acceptableWill be back in the day that I'm too tired too cook , their chef plate looks promisingAnd another thing, really don't like their packaging, two times I order to go, they both spilled, hope they fixed/change this lid container in the future
2017-10-30,5,I just tried this place for lunch and it was amazing! I can't wait to get the Brussel sprouts and sweet potato as sides again. Lemon Tarragon dressing was delicious. So much flavor. Everything was well seasoned and the women working there were so nice. Excited to go back! I couldn't tell what was organic bc I was focused on the menu.
2017-10-28,4,with the health crazed society we have right now this is a perfect place.In my opinion a meal where you only eat salad is a wasted meal but thats just me. I came here with my wife since she loves it and i figured to give it a fair chance.I like how it is quick service and the employees were very helpful. This location is big so you have plenty of room to sit and eat without  being on top of other customers.The salad with salmon was pretty good. It is fresh and a decent size.  It is not my thing but i can see why people love it.If you are on a health kick try it out. Solid place
2017-10-20,3,Quite tasty, but $11.50 is quite a lot of money for 2 ounces of chicken.
2017-10-18,5,Finally a real 'quality' place to grab a healthy meal in Hoboken. It reminds me of Dig Inn in the city. When I worked at Flat Iron I would eat there every single day and never get bored. Quality greens is just like it! Except maybe a rotating menu like Dig Inn. Meats preparations were different on different days and locations. Nonetheless, QG has a plethora of choices to pick from! People said it is pricey but the portions are great so I could eat a meal in two portions. I hope they maintain the freshness and quality of food as time passes. I will be a serious regular!
2017-10-18,5,YES! Welcome to Hoboken friends! What a delightful dining experience. Fast, fresh food served up with a smile and good attitudes. There are few other places like this in Hoboken, especially for that lunchtime salad desire. They have something for everyone and play to all different dietary needs.You do need to be prepared to spend a little more than planned for food there, but you are investing in your health and tastebuds for sure. As much as I liked the food (got a chef plate), I think I liked the personalities of the folks working there even better. Even the cashier told me to get home safe as I grabbed my "to-go" bag. Thanks for being so kind! More people should be like that. Can't wait to go back!
2017-10-17,4,The good: the food was fresh and clean.  They were very friendly, probably bc they just opened.Suggestions: they should put the menu on the wall.The bad: the chips for $2 is a ripoff.  They dont really have a large drink selection.
2017-10-14,5,As a Vegan...THANK YOU! The tofu is unbelievable and so flavorful! The salad options were endless and it was one of the best meals I've had since being in Hoboken. I am so glad that there is an easy healthy option like this now and I look forward to coming back over and over again!
2017-10-12,5,This is definitely now on my list of lunch/dinner spots to frequent in Hoboken.  It's basically a combination of Dig Inn (which is a great) and a salad spot.  The decor is top notch as well and there is plenty of stroller space which is a must for my family.  The staff was very helpful and pleasant.  A nice departure from the usual Hoboken bar and pizza fare.
2017-10-12,4,4.5! Very very happy with this new addition to Hoboken! When I saw this place was opening I was excited as it is similar to Mulberry & Vine by my office in TriBeCa. Also the salmon plate for under $15 seemed like a great price to me as I don't normally eat fish due to the cost. So I got the salmon chef plate which comes with rice and as my two sides I got sweet potatoes and zucchini. Everything was SO good especially salmon and sweet potatoes. I'm spoiled by my moms salmon cooking with the crispy skin but she's not cooking for the masses. Anyways very happy and can't wait to try other options! The salads do seem overpriced but that's just me, I won't pay a lot for lettuce.
2017-10-12,5,You can tell the owner spent a LOT of money in this place. It was beautifully done. Food was great- owner was micromanaging a bit, which is good but it wasn't the most professional way to handle things. I loved that they carve the chicken right there in front of you. Half the sweet potatoes were undercooked but none-the-less, salad was very filling, my boss loved the Brussels Sprouts. All around a great experience.
2017-10-12,5,A much needed go to lunch spot in Hoboken! Great for a hearty meal (Chef's Plate) or a light salad. I have only had the Chef's Plate and highly recommend the tofu and brussel sprouts!Slightly pricey but nothing more than the average prices in Hoboken. I would pay for a tasty, healthy quick meal.
2017-10-10,4,This place just opened and it looks very clean with white subway tiles throughout the walls and a good amount of tables to sit. The menu is shown above the left and is easy to read. The choices are good from different salads to entrees served with 2 side dishes.  I ordered the Tex Mex Cobb salad which tasted good-served in a bowl, just thought the price was a bit too high $13.50 for. salad!
2017-10-10,3,Service is WAY too slow. They're new but need a better manager at lunch time. At times no one was ready to take an order. They need to study Sweet Green in the city during the lunch rush.
