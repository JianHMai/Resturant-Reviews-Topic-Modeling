2021-08-04,5,A pizza place with the best Mac 'n Cheese in town?!? Now THIS I had to try! JK, I just had pizza and the beef rice ball. I looove rice, but I think I'll stick to not deep frying it from now on. I mean, it was worth a try and might sit better for someone with a sturdier stomach. Pizza was phenomenal and the staff were patient, helpful, and pleasant. Great place to grab a slice!
2021-08-02,1,Ahhhhh i dont like to leave bad reviews but this is no where to being even close to Fat boy approved The white truffle lobster mac and cheese was definitely cheesy but they forgot the lobster or it was very limited we also tryed the bacon cheese burger mac and cheese again very cheesy unfortunately they forgot the burger they also forgot the 2 liter ginger ale which would've helped to wash down this, Never again my friend, only thing that was good was the Cajun steak wrap, the other wrap a simple chicken Cesar was not something i would like to share, so sad that this place wasn't good at all
2021-07-26,5,We ordered the Mac n cheese and the vodka pasta and were stunned by how high quality both dishes were! We'll definitely be back to try the other Mac n cheese options
2021-07-05,1,I sat down and waited 25 minutes and the girl kept saying she will serve me. My kid and I watched everyone get served after us and the girl a long withvlike 8 othercpeople just relaxing and talking. Full of kids. Terrible service.
2021-05-17,4,I've had one bad experience, every other time the food was amazing. During high school, I once got a salad, which comes with bread, and after I got back to my school to eat, I realized the bread was covered in blue spots. I was given moldy bread, luckily you're not charged extra for it, so I threw it out. As for what I do like about this place, is the pizza and the Mac n cheese. Me and my friends have been coming here for years. My favorites are the Bbq chicken slice, the Bacon Mac n cheese slice, and the White slice with tomatoes. Their Mac and cheese is amazing and has many varieties including buffalo chicken, and bbq pulled pork Mac n cheese. Their salads are huge, their Wings and other appetizers are great too.
2021-05-02,5,A slice of chicken bacon ranch and the old fashioned tuna casserole Mac and cheese hit nic on a sunny Saturday.
2021-04-20,3,I've been here a few times for pizza and it's great every time. Today I decided to venture a bit and got the Mac and cheese. I honestly felt like that was a waste of a purchase. The noodles were undercooked and the dish was just overall bland. I didn't even eat my food. I would definitely go back and get the pizza any day of the week, it's top tier. But I will never again get the Mac and cheese.
2021-03-28,3,I've only ordered Pizza Republic for delivery. The pizza is ok. It's nothing spectacular, but it'll get the job done if you're craving pizza. There are definitely better options in the area. The wings are always hot and fresh and above average compared to most other pizza places in the area. The delivery can be hit or miss. We once waited over an hour longer than the ETA and the guy ended up in the building next door. It's understandable, but by the time I got next door he decided to leave and cancel my order.
2021-01-27,4,Packaging was decent regular pizza box and wings came in a tin foil case no complaints there. I want to say I got a medium of small pizza which can feed 2 people with a small appetite but I ate the pizza alone had help with the wings though lol.The pizza and wings were actually really good you won't be disappointed I'm just salty that I had tomato's on my pizza but that's not a big issue at all I prefer the Margarita pizza the traditional way.The food came in about 15-25 mins which is reasonable no complaints about that. I am a satisfied customer and would recommend.
2021-01-13,3,Mac n cheese here is actually quite good, but this chicken Marsala was a mistake to order and I kinda should of known to stick to wings or apps here so that's my mistake. Chicken had not a single resemblance to a Marsala besides the breading and mushrooms ; was otherwise bland with roasted peppers (why?) and overcooked linguine. I need at least some type of Marsala wine taste, which they clearly don't use or at least enough of it and the addition of the peppers was really weird. Stick to the Mac n cheese and you'll be good!
2020-08-03,1,horrible service... I placed an order through their website, 2 hours later there is still no food. I call and they said they "just saw" the order, meanwhile i got the confirmation that they had accepted it when i first ordered. the man tells me that they cant refund it and that i'd have to do it myself. I will never be ordering from this place again.
2020-05-25,5,Came to Hoboken for the day to take pictures,  I was craving a calzone and stumbled upon Pizza Republic. Ordered a large calzone to go, which was humongous. I was only able to eat half of it. The dough was perfect and ricotta and mozzarella inside super abundant as for the tomando sauce on the side it was absolutely delicious. Totally worth the prize. Considering I lived in Italy for years and speak Italian fluently I know more than the "Italians" from New York and this place gets five stars.
2020-03-01,5,Stopped in to pick up a pizza for lunch.  Had traditional pepperoni, cheese and mushrooms.  Fresh from the oven to the box and a 4 minute walk home.  Pizza was still hot and fresh.  Best pizza in Hoboken and the best price.
2020-02-16,2,I order from this place prob twice a month. Food is usually pretty good but WTF is this? Just thought throwing a whole ass raw onion on a slice would be cool?
2020-02-07,2,Do they have  new owners? I used to love their pizza.  Haven't been here in a long time. I ordered a plain slice and a spinach and tomato slice. The plain slice was lacking in cheese and a flavorful sauce. The spinach and tomato slice either had moldy cheese or was just sitting around all day (or from yesterday) that the cheese looked like mold. I had take out. I tossed the slice when I got home. It was so unappealing that I will never go back. The staff also was different. Not overly friendly, not weLcoming. I won't go back.
2020-01-25,5,Best delivery place in Hoboken, big selection and always fresh and quick. GF pizza is great if you're looking for that, wraps are great too and I had to post this review bc I get chicken soup here often and tonight's was literally the best chicken soup I've ever had! Can't go wrong here!!
2019-10-04,5,Best pizza place in Hoboken!! My favorite is the "spinach,ricotta, tomato" slice! Everything is always fresh and the Owner and staff are always kind and welcoming. Clean environment. Menu with endless options. Did I mention they also have vegan pies as well!
2019-06-11,5,Another one of my college favorites!! The pizza isn't bad, and despite the name, the macaroni is even better. By far my favorite thing on the menu is the chicken noodle soup, they use spaghetti noodles and for some reason it's the only thing I want when I'm sick. I have yet to find any chicken noodle soup that compares. Delivery is fast and convenient as well. Calzones are excellent.
2019-06-01,3,Not the best Mac and cheese but not the worst I had it with breaded chicken it felt very dry and the cheese was burnt definitely over cooked the cheese didn't even stretch but I had the garlic knots and they were fantastic.
2019-04-13,5,Visiting family in Hoboken, stopped in at the Republic.  This pizza was amazing!  So, happy we found it.  They also have gluten free options which was really appreciated as well! Enjoy Hoboken & amazing Pizza!!
2019-03-28,5,Trekked over to Pizza Republic from Jersey City during lunch b/c I heard their Vegan pizza was good. Tried to order by the slice, but they said they don't sell it this way, so I had to order a small pie, which was a bummer for me, but my colleagues didn't mind when I came back with leftovers. All said, the pizza was delicious, the cheese was creamy and the crust was perfect. A friend was with me and tried a slice and couldn't believe how much it tasted like cheese pizza. They are famous for their Mac and Cheese, which all looked delicious, just disappointed there was no vegan option. Not hard too hard to do guys, just some Cashew cheese and macaroni's.
2019-03-17,4,A lot of variety on the menu, staff is very nice and the food is made quickly! Extra points for gluten free options like mac and cheese and the pizza. Food isn't AMAZING but it hits the spot and the prices are decent, especially for the portion. The buffalo chicken mac and cheese is super cheesy (and oily) with plenty of chicken, which you can choose to be mild or hot. I'll be back when the craving strikes.
2019-03-12,5,I love pizza republic !! Huge slices (see profile pic), delicious toppings and sides too. My fave pizza to get when I'm craving something easy and filling. The cheese fries are amazing too. And they're always so friendly!!! Thank you to everyone working there for being awesome and making awesome pizza too!
2019-03-10,4,I order pizza republic on a night I'm looking to indulge, and it always hits the spot. I'm a very routined person and always get the classic Mac n cheese and bruschetta chicken sandwich. The classic Mac n cheese is perfect, very tasty mixed with different kinds of cheeses and topped with a crust with breadcrumbs on top. You can tell they bake it in the over to create a crust on top which is absolutely delicious. The bruschetta chicken sandwich is very good, the bruschetta itself has very fresh ingredients and is very tasteful. The chicken cutlet is pretty good, always very thin and sometimes a bit overcooked, but with a layer of melted mozzarella over it I don't mind! I would definitely recommend pizza republic. They usually deliver faster than anticipated too!
2019-02-27,1,Waited for delivery for an hour and a half. Driver said he called my phone which was a complete lie because I had the phone on me at all times, and I was waiting downstairs. Food is mediocre at best and definitely not worth the wait. Just an FYI, if your hungry don't order from here you'll probably end up starving.
2019-02-16,1,Ordered a large pie with toppings for delivery and arrived as a total slop, with all toppings piled in the corner of the box as if the pizza was stored vertically during delivery. Weirdly, the pizza was essentially sauceless as well. Have ordered here in the past without too much of an issue but after this experience never going to order from them again. Too bad!
2019-02-09,4,Very very solid pizza! Consistently good and one of my new go-to spots. The pizza is great but the rest of their menu is full of tasty treats. Some of my favorites: Chicken Vodka Parm hero, Fried Mac and Cheese Bites and garlic nots
2018-11-24,5,I ordered the Bacon Classic -- the bacon had a great crisp, crunchy texture while the macaroni was as creamy and fluffy as it gets. Prices were great and Stevens students get a nice 10% discount. Service was fast and friendly. They're really generous with napkins.
2018-11-16,2,The pizza has always been terrible but they used to have a good selection of great Mac and cheese. The quality isn't what it used to be and it's way over priced for what it is. Plenty of great pizza joints in this town so I'd stick with those.
2018-11-09,1,The worst customer service in all of Hoboken. Waited 40 minutes outside of the quoted "45-60" minute window and I was somehow made to feel in the wrong for calling to check on our order and was hung up on TWICE. Rude rude rude. Will never order from this restaurant again.
2018-11-02,1,Do not order on seamless from this place. They have screwed up our order almost every time. Most recently they sent ONE out of FIVE dishes we ordered. I called the restaurant and they insisted the driver delivered it. He didn't. Not to me anyway. They said they would find the food and send it ASAP. I called AGAIN 30 min later and the same story; they insisted it was delivered. It wasn't. They said they would put in the order and send it in about 25-30 min. TWO HOURS after the original order. When I asked her why they were JUST putting the order in she hung up on me. RUDE ASSHOLE. We contacted Seamless and they told us "for some reason they are no longer processing deliveries". Nice. F*CK YOU Pizza Republic and your at best mediocre food and single digit IQ management who can't even manage to sling a plate of burnt pasta into a bag and drive it .6 miles.
2018-10-13,1,I asked them to give me more shrimp on my wrap and I literally got 2-3 shrimps and paid 10$ for a lettuce wrap... even the shrimp was good, that's still annoying.Then my boyfriend got a sandwich and it has so much balsamic vinegar, it's sour and mushy. Took a bite and literally spit it out.. & the mac & cheese was so much cheese, it tastes weird and too much. I'm upset I spent 40$ and ate nothing... lol can a manager call me back?Update: manager is ass. Told me that she can't do nothing to call "grub hub" lol I paid in cash and thru Yelp? So that wasn't helpful at all & now I have to order from somewhere else literally.
2018-10-06,3,Aghhh! Today my pizza sucked and I have to say... my feelings were hurt because not only today, but the last few times prior to today wasn't good visits either. I got two plain slices and it just didn't have that bang to it anymore. I'm guessing since they lost some employees the pizza hasn't been made the same.
2018-09-24,3,This place really should  just stick to being known as Pizza republic as opposed to  as the "MAC daddy of Hoboken " . I love truffle Mac and cheese and when I had a taste of their white truffle Mac and cheese I was highly disappointed. I was expecting that cheesy , truffle flavor explosion, but it just wasn't there. I appreciate their portion size ,but this was a no for me. Their pizza's are good and they have so delicious sandwiches. If you come here make sure to get their pizza , that they know how to make, Mac & cheese not so much. Customer service really should improve, your worked Should not look like they hate working there. That also added to this bitter experience. Would I come again ? Only if I was craving some yummy pizza or one of their huge ,tasty sandwiches (try the chicken bruschetta)!! , but definitely will give the Mac and cheese a pass.
2018-09-23,3,For the self proclaimed "Mac Daddy of Hoboken," you'd think they'd know how long to cook pasta for. Got buffalo Mac and cheese and the pasta could have used a few more minutes in the pot. Aside from the firm pasta, the cheese and buffalo chicken was good. You aaaaalmost nailed this one! But not quite
2018-07-27,5,Great place, amazing service, food options are great and  tasty! Blacken shrimp wrap ( favorite). You wont be disappointed
2018-07-09,4,My husband and I had lunch here this passed weekend. I ordered the mac n' cheese with bacon pizza slice with an order of (3) garlic knots and he ordered the "Mac Daddy" which is made to order, gooey macaroni and cheese with what looked like crunchy onion (think of fried onion bloom, but crunchier) on top. We enjoyed our lunch. I especially liked that their garlic knots were not greasy or overly garlic-y like other pizza shoppes that I've been to.
2018-06-29,1,Pizza smells like dirty feet, and service is horrendous. They forgot my drink so I called. I let them know and she kept insisting she put it in the bag. Finally offered to refund, or asked if I would like to wait and have it delivered but it would take a while. Horrible all around.
2018-06-05,5,I go here way too often for the cheese fries... the best in town. Plz never change. I also love the variety of Mac and Cheese, also my favorite in town.
2018-03-24,2,Have ordered pizza and salads from here a number of times. Have had no issues in the past. This time, there was a number of human hairs in the pizza. As you can imagine, the pizza and sides went in the garbage. Didn't bother to call the restaurant. Management has an attitude.
2018-03-04,3,After work I was running errands and stopped into pizza republic for a quick slice to go.  The slices are a bit bigger than your average regular slice which I did not mind at all! The guy at the counter was super friendly and quickly warmed up my slice.  The place looked clean and had tables that allowed you sit and order pizza as well as meals.  Behind the counter there were a few different types of slices, Stromboli and rice balls.  The rice balls looked delicious and if I had enough time I probably would have gotten one.  My slice wasn't the best in Hoboken but it was tasty.  I enjoyed it and if needed something quick to eat I would go back.  Plus the size of the slices won't leave you hungry!
2018-01-25,1,Totally disappointed in Cobb Salad.  Description says "crisp romaine, plum tomatoes, avocado, hard boiled eggs, red onion and grilled chicken with red wine vinaigrette".  Besides the absents of any kind of dressing or bacon, the lettuce was mostly iceberg (much cheaper), the tomatoes were chunks of much larger (cheaper) tomatoes, not the taste plum type. There were cut up cucumbers missing the seeded part in the middle. It's like they needed to get rid of rotting cucumbers! All in all, I'm sorry I ordered from here and will not order again.
2018-01-14,5,This is my favorite Mac and cheese spot! one of the best mac and cheese i ever had ! The Penne alla vodka sauce is to die for! i have to eat here at least 3 times a week! the cashier lady is the very nice as well!
2017-12-23,5,I keep coming back for the Mac and cheese, the amount of options and the fact that each one actually tastes good is the best part. Highly recommend.
2017-12-21,2,Good food and good pizza. HORRIBLE and nasty attitudes. Every time I come here, regardless of who is tending to my order, is always rude. I'm not even going to get into details about my many encounters, but it's a shame because I really like the pizza here. Because of their attitude, they don't make you feel welcomed; that alone, regardless of good food or not, is enough to make sure I don't return. Word of advice to the owners/managers, if you want to be in the customer service industry, make sure your staff is good at customer service, especially if your business thrives on customers. Hoboken is competitive spot for a pizzeria, so just something to think about to possibly take your business to the next level. You should also consider speaking to the girl with the glasses about her very horrible attitude. I came here on Tuesday evening and just because of her attitude, I canceled my entire order.
2017-11-15,4,Good place for late night pizza and reasonably priced. Have yet to get a slice here that I didn't like. Chicken rolls are pretty good as well.
2017-09-24,1,Don't bother.  Ordered through seamless and was told to pick our order up over a block away from our apartment.  Explained that this was unacceptable only to be hung up on  by their disrespectful staff.  Spoke to seamless and was issued a refund and decided to order food elsewhere.  I'd suggest you do the same.
2017-09-04,5,I catered 2 full trays of mac and cheese (Truffle and Classic) for my party, can't decide which one I like better.  They were a big hit with kids and adults alike.  The mac and cheese reheated very well the next day.  I'm so glad I found such a great mac and cheese catering source for my parties.  I'll definitely be back.  They were super helpful on the phone and delivered to the office for my convenience.  Hoboken is bit out of the way for me now but for me it's worth the trip.
2017-08-12,5,I had an amazing lunch from Pizza Republic. The Bacon Mac n Cheese with sautéed broccoli and grilled chicken. It was really great! I ordered it online and by the time I got there it was done. My coworkers also order with me they got the Sausage and peppers, black truffle and the mamas classic Mac n.Cheese. Everyone loved it and practicality licking the left over plates! Good Job!
2017-08-12,5,The mac and cheese pie is a must have. Really nice counter people and they have a nice outside dining area. I work down the block and it's always my go to for Pizza.
2017-08-06,5,I have ordered pizza here often usually pepperoni. Always perfect. But My daughter and I where walking on Washington Street and stopped in for a salad. We got the tropical salad. Great. Also the women who served us was really pleasant, kind and curtious. All around a great place to go. Enjoy.
2017-07-01,3,Delivery was fast (or, exactly on time according to the Seamless estimate) but the pizza honestly tasted like a Digiorno. Maybe it was because it was a 12" pie but the crust was too thick and a bit gummy/chewy. The cheese also tasted like plastic. Plus one star for their sense of humor.
2017-06-29,4,I've wanted to try their famous Mac & Cheese for a while. They offer numerous variations on the classic version, and after reading through the options, I ordered their Black Truffle Mac & Cheese (& also, a garlic knot because they looked good)! I didn't have to wait long. Service was quick and friendly enough. They serve the Mac & cheese right in the skillet which is a nice touch. It was hot & cheesy, just the way you'd want it, & sooo filling that I got half of it wrapped up & got 2 meals out of it. The garlic knot was also excellent. I'll definitely be a returning customer, either for more Mac & Cheese, some pizza, pasta, or one of their salads.
2017-06-09,3,They could easily be a 5 star restaurant , but because of the attitude from the woman at the counter I'm giving them 3 stars. I get it ,  its hot outside your stuck inside taking cash all day. I would be pretty bummed too. But its not my fault. After being too lazy to walk any further on Washington Street I just settled for this place. I'm happy I did because their pizza is phenomenal. Now if you know pizza you know that the crust is the most important part. Don't ARGUE with me lol. Their crust is so soft and yummy I think God made it himself. The marinara sauce definitely is not from a can. Everybody knows the first rule to eating pizza is tip first and honestly the tip is the best part ;)  But today I broke that rule. I ate my crust first and then I ate the pizza backwards. Everything about the pizza was great , its a decent sized slice , one will do the job. Its also very thick. I noticed alot of people were ordering the mac n cheese. So maybe on my next visit I'll be sure to add that to my meal. 1 slice of pizza was 3.75. If you can get past the attitude of the evil woman at the counter then you'll be fine. Also their was no wait time , I was in and out. I will most certainly come back.
2017-05-26,4,This is one of my favorite pizza place in the area. The pizza is very BBQ chicken pizza is the best. If your skeptical about where to grab a slice, look no further.
2017-04-25,2,Your food is tasty but your delivery service has disappointed me to no end. Mac and cheese was so hot that the plastic cover melts into it? Impressive. Yes, this happened to me the last three times. Also, there were no utensils in my last order. I wouldn't wish that upon my worst enemy.Unless... Are you motivating me to dine in? Wow... What a fucking strategy... Genius.On the bright side, thanks for staying open late. That way, when the delivery person disappoints me, I can blame it on the time of day.
2017-04-23,4,When I'm craving something quick and not so good for me I order here :-) The calzones are delicious and a great priCe. I also lovvve the mac and cheese. The caprese is a classic.
2017-04-14,5,The best pizza! The red sauce was made by some bodies grandma! Sooo yummy. Garlic knots were fresh and fluffy! Stop in food was quick and plenty of it!
2017-03-24,4,My favorite pizza slice anywhere.  Lunch special is two big slices of any specialty pizza and a bottled drink for $5.50.  Such a deal.  They also have a wide variety of really good Mac 'n Cheese dishes.  A great informal  counter service pizza lunch spot, but very informal and not a sit--down "restaurant".
2017-03-20,3,The truffle fries I loved but I have an affection for French fries. We also ordered wings and Mac and cheese but were a bit disappointed with both. The delivery was very fast.
2017-03-13,5,Love the pizza, rice balls and the meatballs are to die for. When I see the owner I always promise him a good review and here it is. Never ordered anything here that wasn't 100%.
2017-03-07,2,I used to order from Pizza Republic all the time but I was forced to stop. Countless times they would mess up my online order and sending me something completely different or some combination I didn't request. Such a shame because you when they have everything put together their Mac and cheese bowls and amazing.
2017-02-13,5,This is my absolute favorite pizza place in Hoboken. Try their bruschetta pizza, or any of the baked mac&cheese (the Mexican is my favorite). Other great pies? Veggie deluxe, and the Grandmas pie. They have a great lunch special. $7-something for two gigantic deluxe slices and a drink. $5-ish if you just want cheese. For sandwiches, try the vodka-eggplant-parm. It's really great.
2017-01-24,4,Me and my wife ordered large pizza half veggies and half bbq chicken and the it tastes great my only comment is the bbq was a little bit too much. Friendly staff, but I have few comments that i hope the owner would into it.Delivery guys sits around in the restaurant and they talk to each other in a language that I speak and understand as well as my wife, which i have no problem with that at all even if we don't understand.But they were talking to each other and cursing loudly which made my wife a little bit uncomfortable sitting around. I'm sure they didn't know that we understand, other than that pizza is great.
2017-01-17,3,Stopped here for a quick dinner on a Tuesday evening. It is a true pizzeria with a simple interior to match. The Margherita pizza was very good-nice crust and not a heavy sauce. Also good was the tortellini in a light pink sauce. There are many other selections on the menu so you are not limited to just pizza. The staff was friendly. A good stop for solid pizza and a few other choices to boot.
2017-01-11,4,Great food! Mac and cheese bits were awesome. Even had a nice salad.
2017-01-08,5,Easily my favorite pizza place in Hoboken, and I have tried at least 10 different pizza joints.  The pizza is amazing, but the mac & cheese is second to none.If you want fast delivery, it's not the quickest, but well worth the wait.
2016-12-22,3,From the pizza snob point of view, I was not super pleased with the quality of this pizza. The service was sub-par (I think they were short handed on this day). It was pizza. Sauce and cheese on a crust... pizza. Not the best, not horrible.  I always expect "the best" when businesses have their signature item in their title. However, remember, I am a pizza snob. I love the stuff. So any pizza, pizza bagels, stromboli, pizza rolls, pizza pocket etc... I love it. Any who, if I ever want a slice and I'm in the Hoboken area, I may not return but visit another spot on Washington.
2016-12-13,1,The food is ok, but delivery was so slow and the woman who picked up the phone was very impatient and unfriendly!
2016-10-30,5,Been coming here for years. Excellent service, excellent food. Open late. Not to be missed. The best pizza and mac in cheese in Hoboken!!!!!!!
2016-10-25,3,The food is always great but the delivery is extremely horrible. Always later than estimated and when you call to check the girl answering gets annoyed. My last 5 orders have taken longer than what I was told. Consistently told "oh it will be there in 5-10mins", sometimes it shows in that time period and sometimes it's longer. Wish the delivery experience wasn't so frustrating.
2016-10-08,5,I think I've passed this place so many times but never gave it a chance.  So glad I did!  I  normally go to Grimaldi's for gluten free pizza but I tried this place and it was just as good.  Other places in Hobo don't know how to do gluten free like Johnny balooney something (horrible place by the way)    the service is friendly and the quality of the pizza was very delicious!   Wait time is never too long if you walk in or do pick up.  Delivery may take a while from my experience but that's just the business.  I will definitely be a repeat customer!
2016-09-25,1,I ordered via Grubhub my food arrived after about 45 mins but that wasn't my issue. My issue is that the delivery guy was beyond RUDE when I told him he should bring my food to my door.
2016-09-22,5,This place is a solid eat. My staff and I order from here at least twice a week. They have a great diverse menu and where most places fail, they do a great job with all the food I've tried so far. But my absolute favorite is their homemade Chipotle Aioli....I put that sh*t on everything.
2016-09-20,5,Nice staff.  Great place for a quick pizza slice.  Slice and service I had here was better than Tudinos believe it or not.  Buffalo slice.
2016-08-12,5,Excellent food l! Amazing management the staff is very helpful and the Mac n cheese is out of this world
2016-06-17,3,I ordered the Caprese Mac and cheese. Unfort. it wasnt so good. It hardly had any basil, the roasted tomatoes had no flavor and they were hard. For $10 it wasnt good. My friend picked the bacon cheeseburger and said it was amazing. Also, I would train the staff a little more with the register. I wanted to pay seperate, but she didnt know how to so i had to put the whole bill on her card,  little annoying.
2016-06-02,2,Hope you like LIVE BUGS with your food. We got the surprise of a little green bug in the arugula salad when we ordered takeout. When I called the restaurant to notify them, not only did the restaurant refuse to refund us but the owner didn't have the decency to call me back to discuss. With a 2 week newborn, I couldn't risk getting sick, so I threw out all the food from the order. I am giving Pizza Republic an extra star because as long as you don't mind extra EXOTIC PROTEIN in your food, it does have good Mac and cheese. I will miss this place.
2016-05-18,5,Amazing mac and cheese and pizza! Definitely a must visit if you are in hoboken! I had the buffalo chicken mac and cheese and it was absolutely delicious.
2016-04-20,5,We just scored some zeppoles for desert from this place. They were so good everyone's diet was broken. It was so good. There lunch is great. We come here every Wednesday for lunch and have yet to be disappointed. The music is on point and the cashier always brings us our food with a lot of love. Thanks PR
2016-04-17,5,I eat here 7 days a week like a degenerate, but that's how good this place is They have almost any kind go food you can think of. Enjoy
2016-04-03,4,I was working in Hoboken and could not leave my desk. I placed an order today and it seemed that 15 minutes later, my food was coming in the door. Fast delivery and the food was Hot!! No soggy fries. Chicken fingers were perfectly cooked! I appreciate the quick service!
2016-03-25,5,Moved to Jersey a year ago and this is by far the best pizza we've had including in NYC! The pizzas are huge and delicious and the Mac and cheese is honestly the best I've ever had!! Love this place! We take all our out of town visitors here when they come up!
2016-03-23,3,I went in here for lunch today after seeing a sign in the window advertising a wrap lunch special. I got the portobello mushroom wrap on wheat with a side salad and a can of soda for $7.95. I like that they don't upcharge for the salad, and it came with a decent amount of toppings (tomatoes, cucumbers, black olives, croutons and onions--if you are that guy).The wrap came out quickly and was a decent size. Here's the thing with mushrooms, they are delicious but a pretty delicate flavor. This wrap also had roasted red peppers, romaine, mozzarella and a balsamic vinaigrette. Besides there being an overwhelming amount of dressing on it (check out the photo after half the wrap!), it was also a really strong flavor to combine with the mushrooms AND roasted red peppers. Basically, it tasted like balsamic flavor squishy items with some lettuce. But, the wrap was warm and it held together well. I wouldn't order it again and I'd be hesitant to get any to-go unless they could put the sauce on the side.  Speaking of to-go, I overheard the two workers talking about how the delivery guy forgot three different items for to-go orders yesterday and they were wondering if they people were going to complain their next orders. I don't order a lot of to-go, but shouldn't they have called...removed that item from their ticket...gone back and given it to them...something? That seemed odd to me. Anyway, for the price, it wasn't bad but I wouldn't go out of my way to order a wrap from here again.
2016-03-06,1,Terrible terrible service. Yesterday, my husband and I stood directly across the counter from two women behind the cash registers. Both of them pretended not to see us, at one point they even started whispering to each other. Neither one of them asked us for our order or if we had any questions about the menu.  They literally never acknowledged us.  After 3-5 minutes of standing there being completely ignored, we walked out. I will never go back there again.
2016-02-21,2,Perhaps the worst sandwich I've ever got from a pizza place. Reminds me of food from the student center at my college. The 2 women that work there are quite nasty too.
2016-02-20,1,Took 45 minutes to make a pie.Found a pubic hair in the pizza.On our margherita pizza, the tomatoes were clearly uncooked.Poor service, poor food, there's nothing to redeem this place whatsoever.
2016-01-21,4,Bacon mac n cheese ahhh. So good. They lose a star for the few times that delivery was super slow and I don't loveee the pasta but the mac n cheese is awesome and their pizza is solid.
2016-01-13,1,grease is the word.  Okay may be it is oil but feels like grease.  pizza was greasy.  the pasta and sauce was loaded with oil.  no taste and it all just seemed glued together.  Once i saw the inch of oil at the bottom, i was done.  A  bad first experience usually leads to no second experience.  too many other options in Hoboken to return here.....
2016-01-02,5,Yesterday I was walking around Hoboken with my mom when we decided to give this place a try for their Mac and Cheese. It was both of our first times going here.First impressions: The place looks like your typical pizza place which I don't necessarily find appealing but it serves its purpose. We were greeted when we came in and the lady behind the counter was very friendly with us and helped us decide on our order.We decided on the portobello truffle oil Mac and cheese. It came out fast and was delicious (my mom also said it was the best Mac and cheese she ever had).In short, great service and food. Will come back if I'm ever in the area again.
2015-12-27,2,Have tried to like Pizza Republic, but really haven't enjoyed either of my 2 experiences. Recently ordered delivery, and pizza was cold and lacked flavor. Mac and cheese warm but not great, but would recommend the Mac and cheese over the pizza.
2015-12-19,5,Omg the mac n cheese!! White truffle mac is all you need in your life, trust me. I got the snickers bar dessert which was also amazing. Haven't tried the pizza or anything else so this review is based purely off their fire mac n cheese, def trying the four cheese next. Worth every calorie
2015-10-15,5,Possibly, the best thing I ever ate.       On lunch, searching for a Jamaican Beef Patty with cheese. Which is non existent in Hoboken for some reason. I went into Pizza Republic and picked up a White cheese slice. It was fantastic! I mean, like perfect crust right amount of temperature heat and just the right amount of cheese. The portion was generous. How good can it possibly be, you say? When you start chewing slower to make it last longer, thats when you know.I started to ponder other pizza's I have had in my travels. This one by far has taken the throne. Don't change a thing! New fanboy, right here. Exceptional !
2015-10-08,5,I read Kyle's review and the owners response. I eat here all the time. I love the food and never have a problem with it or the service. Kyle why would you be upset over $1. If your upset that you didn't get a discount that's a horrible reason to bash a business that is trying to survive a bad economy. I looked at some of your other reviews and it seems as though you use yelp as a weapon to hurt people and businesses when you don't get your way. That's not very nice !!!. To be honest I concur with the owner and find you to be the jack ass. You appear to be very self righteous and a very unhappy person. I will continue to give my business to pizza republic because I enjoy their product. In your review you said the food was mediocre at best, you didn't bash it which leaves me to believe you enjoyed the food and are just trying to hurt their business. I would love for someone to tell you how to run your business however I don't think you have the heart to risk so much. You would rather knock someone for having the courage. Your probably not very good at your job either which is why you sound so unhappy and spiteful. Get a life Kyle. This is the first time I ever responded to a review and it's because it was easy to see that you were upset over ONE DOLLAR, pathetic....... You must be one of those people who when the check comes you go to the bathroom in hopes that you won't have to chip in
2015-09-28,4,Love the chicken pesto pizza. Its just awesome. I am ordering it regularly and still not bored of it.Will highly recommend the pesto chicken pizza.
2015-06-29,4,Didn't try pizza but we had the Mac and cheese. Portion size is big. Get 2 for 3 people. Very cheesy and tasty. Truffle Mac was good and Mac Daddy full of yummies.
2015-06-18,4,Mac and Cheese/Calzone   The mac and cheeses, for the most part, are great in winter when food feels like theextra down coat you can't possibly wear over the one you already have, so you wear the mac and cheese UNDER it....and get to the gym. Otherwise it starts hangin' aroundin unwanted places. Delivery is quick, except on Friday nights around 8 to 10 p.m. and prices, not terrible.    Otherwise, the calzone, very darkly toasted, with calamata olives and truffle oiljust works.  I have tried other combos but they tasted off somehow.Ask for two little cups of tomato sauce and good luck getting them.  The pecan bar is a good dessert in a sugar jones storm.  The others arejust passable.  Zeppole are great, but lots of extra carbs.  Salads are not so worththe money.  For the price, you can do much better buying the same ingredientsand having them around.   The delivery guys are cordial and always have change.  If the order takersmake a mistake, they apologize, try to fix it and don't get all pissy. Who needs the agita on a weekend, right?
2015-06-17,1,i ordered the food over 1.5 hours ago, and it has yet to arrive.  i live less than a mile away from the place and at this rate, i could've walked to the restaurant and made it back with time to spare.  called twice and still have yet to see my delivery.  so while i enjoy the food at this restaurant, i'm not sure i'll be ordering from them again.
2015-06-17,5,amazing Mac & Cheese. Saw this place one day, walking up Washington on my way to East LA. The menu outside is what caught my attention, seeing all the different choices so I knew on my next trip to Hoboken, this place was my next stop to grab a bite to eat. Little did I know I was setting myself up to LOVE the food. Not only was the Mac& cheese delicious but the service was amazing. I tried the Buffalo Mac&Cheese & my cousin the 4 Cheese, & with those fluffy garlic knots  perfect combo. Def. coming back soon and trying another dish.
2015-06-17,3,I have to give them props for being friendly and a good sport about allowing my friend and I let our toddlers run amok in the place. The salads were great; the pizza slices were ok too but one thing I have to mention: THE PLACE IS FILTHY. Bring hand sanitizer and wet wipes. They need to HOSE the place down with Windex. Everything is greasy, sticky, smeared- just gross!! Wtf??Would not even think about putting my 2 year old in their high chair or booster seat; they all have rotted food and whatever else all over them. YUK!And Ladies, beware: the "hot" water in the bathroom is hot enough to boil eggs in it. It will scald your skin right off. Other than that, cool place. Just f*cking CLEAN it for crying out loud.
2015-05-04,2,I did not enjoy my experience. I asked for mac and cheese pizza and they gave me baked ziti and they charged me for mac and cheese. I think $5 dollars for a slice of pizza is outrageous. To top off, they not going gave me the wrong slice but also it was undercooked. The crust was still dough and the macaroni was hard like it has been out all day. I will never go back there. It is hard to find bad pizza in the NJ/NYC area and this place has undercooked pizza.
2015-04-25,1,Ordered delivery through Seamless.  They forgot to include $8 in side orders but refused to authorize a refund for even that amount.  The food itself was not even worthy of the 1 star given.  It's bad, like really bad.  There are better options in JC for better prices that won't give you a hard time when they mess up your order.  Pass on this one.
2015-04-23,1,The food is really good but sadly the customer service is not. The food would get five stars and so in the restaurant business these both work hand in hand.
2015-04-21,3,So their website says they deliver to me, but apparently they do not. So instead of cancelling my order and giving me a call to let me know this, they just cancelled it and let me think I was getting food. When I finally called to ask when delivery would be they told me "oh we don't deliver to you". I said "then why on your website does it say you deliver to my address???". The answer was "we don't deliver to you" -- and they hung up. Didn't even get to ask if they were planning on notifying me at all. Not thrilled with that customer service, but I am addicted to the Republic mac & cheese so they at least get 2 stars.EDIT: forgot to add that they had indeed delivered to my house 2 times before the above incident, so my guess is that they just didn't feel like delivering to me -- i do live in JC and they are in Hoboken, but don't advertise that you will deliver to JC if you don't want to.EDIT 2: was contacted by management about this review, they really didn't comment on what happened but offered a 15% discount on my next order......but only if the manager who contacted me is working when i place the order. Ill add a star for that I suppose.
2015-04-08,3,As a huge Mac and Cheese fan, I can definitely say that at this place, the Mac and Cheese would be perfect...if it weren't for the disgusting amounts of grease I've found on the bottom of the dish each time I ordered here! Great Mac and Cheese does not have this much grease in it-please try to change this in the future.Also, the service is not only a tad slow, but also, from my perspective, it seemed like the people working there were frustrated. From their faces, you could tell that they'd rather be somewhere else. No matter how true that is, you should never make that evident to customers!Bottom line: Good Mac and Cheese (save the grease), and overall, great food. Bad service, however.
2015-02-27,4,Awesome~ thoroughly enjoyed the phenomenal, Parnesan truffled macaroni n' cheese and a delicious kids meal of fresh chicken tenders on top of good ol' American macaroni n' cheese. TOPS Planet Mac truly!
2015-02-24,2,So, I ordered a pizza, Mexican Mac n cheese (no jalapeños), and bacon poppers. It arrives in a timely manner and I realize its cold out but my food arrives luke-warm. Also, my Mexican Mac that clearly says "no jalapeños" on the order receipt has *ta-da!* Jalapeños and not much else. I couldve sworn it said there was more going on in here than just mac n cheese covered in tortilla chips and jalapeños!The pizza is OK. I can't complain too much. I realized I wasn't terribly satisfied when I bit into my warm bacon poppers that they were just warm Mac n cheese poppers. C'mon guys, I didn't think this was a tough one.In summary; the food is OK and I would've liked to have a little more attention to detail on my order. Maybe I'll try em again...idk
2015-02-19,4,This a go-to Hoboken restaurant for every type of food. They have excellent salads and wraps, baked mac & cheese dishes, italian and pasta dinners, heroes and pizza. They have a few tables inside & outside, but if you're with a big group, it's probably best for take out. However, if it's a smaller group and you do want to dine in, it's byob. Because you order at the counter and sit down, you wouldn't expect it to be byob but it is :) I highly recommend the steak salad or the baked ziti! DELISH.
2015-02-13,1,My coworkers wanted to order here one night for delivery. I chose the turkey melt and 2 hrs after I ate the thing,(i only ate half of the sandwich since it was a huge one) and i started feeling indigestion and vomited til 5 am. I ate the sandwich about 5-10 mins after delivery and it was past 9pm. That was a Tuesday and I was still sick til Saturday. NEVER AGAIN WILL I ORDER FROM HERE. My doctor said it was food poisoning. So beware.
2015-02-09,5,Another solid experience at this friendly neighborhood joint. If you like mac n cheese, go now!
2015-02-02,4,Have ordered from here probably 30+ times. Solid, consistent, good variety in their menu.My favorite is the Grilled Chicken/Fresh Mozz Sub. They give a giant portion and it's got great flavor. Pizza is good too. Overall, just a nice go-to.
2015-01-31,3,Fast delivery but I should have read the reviews and gone with the Mac and Cheese. The calzone was mediocre at best and not come with marinara.
2015-01-21,5,Great local place... Slices are large!!!!! Friendly staff and cheap!!!! A must go to pizza joint .... U will love their mushroom slice!!!! And they deliver !!!!
2014-11-25,2,Good food... Incompetent staff. We use to order from them once, maybe twice a week, but their service is either, A) unbelievably slow (taking over an hour), or, B) they get orders wrong. No joke the last five orders I've made have had a mistake.  Never ordering here again.
2014-10-25,1,So disappointed! I've had their mac & cheese and their salads and both have been pretty good- but tonight we ordered a pizza. I ordered the Margherita (which is a little pricey here but I figured it would also be good) and it is the worst Margherita pizza I've ever had. Besides the fact that is arrived totally cold - it is square, and the crust is pretty thick and under cooked, and it is basically just a plain pizza with a few cold sliced tomatoes and basil leaves thrown on top :(  I'm really pretty annoyed that I wasted the money and our meal on this.
2014-09-13,3,Warning: Delivery took a lot longer than the estimated 30-40 mins (over 1 hour), so be aware!Ordered a Republic Pizza, White Truffle Mac N Cheese and Kid Mac N Cheese. Portions are very big, so we were definitely filled up. Food itself was decent. Pizza had a good zing, and M&C had a great truffle aroma. However, everything seemed a little soggy, which took away from the experience. The regular M&C that came with the kids order was pretty bland.Pros: Price, portionsCons: Service
2014-09-01,1,We ordered delivery. It arrived 20 minutes after the 30-45 minute estimate, which was annoying (especially since I called and was told it was on the way).  But the sad part is that the food is just bad.  We ordered salad mixed with dressing and got salad with no dressing (at all - not even in the bag). All the bags were leaking and the food was lukewarm.  The cheeses in the salads and the two pasta dishes were so rubbery that even my kids wouldn't eat them (and they live on Mac n cheese).  Nothing was seasoned.  It was just a total fail.
2014-08-20,3,Ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. The crust was solid, a little crispy, not too doughy or too thin. I like my food spice. When I get Thai, I ask them to make my curry Thai spicy and not white girl spicy. This pizza was so hot it was almost inedible. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars because the crust held so much promise and I haven't had the regular pizza sauce to truly judge. But for all you buff chix lovers out there, be forewarned.
2014-08-09,4,Last night I got a sudden mac n cheese craving, just as I had ordered some other food, so I  decided that today I was gonna go INNNNNN and treat myself to a huge order of mac n cheese.  I read the reviews here and people said the portions were big, and the reviews were very mixed about the mac n cheese.  So I decided to form my own opinion.  My favorite mac n cheese place EVER is MacBar in the SoHo, but I didn't feel like going in to get that, so I was really hopeful I'd find a place I like just as much here in Jersey City or Hoboken.  Well, I didn't like it as much as MacBar but it was pretty good.  I got the Bacon Cheeseburger Mac with whole wheat pasta (penne).  I didn't know it was going to be penne, and I prefer elbows for mac n cheese.  I don't know if their egular mac is elbows or penne....  The breadcrumbs on top were really good, but overall, while it was really good it was just slightly bland.....I just added a little garlic salt - the closest thing to me - and that did the trick!  YUMMM!!!!  OH...I also had fresh tomatoes added to the dish and that was a great addition!  People were saying it's very greasy and too cheesy but I didn't think that at ALL  I think I would have preferred more of a creamier béchamel base - which I didn't defect - but overall it was very good and I will definitely be ordering again, and just know I'll need to add a bit of salt, and find of if the regular (not whole wheat) pasta is elbows instead of penne.SO, that's my mac review....not let me get to what I LOOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVED and will now be ADDICTED TO AND OBSSESSED WITH....the Tropical Salad!!!!!!!  I had a bit of a sweet tooth mixed with the mac n cheese craving, but I also wanted to get a salad...this was the perfect solution!!!!  It's a very basic salad but the combo just WORKS!  It was lettuce, grilled chicken (seasoned perfectly), diced pineapple (YUM!), chopped walnuts...and literally the best salad dressing I've ever tasted!  I usually don't like creamy-type dressings, nor do I like a lot of dressing on the salad.  So I got the dressing on the side, and started off by pouring on just a little bit.  Let's just say that by a third of the way through the salad, I poured on the rest and was literally scraping the sides of the little container.  It was THAT good, and next time I will be ordering extra.So, I ate everything - whole salad and whole mac n cheese order.  And I'm a chick....that could probably out-eat most dudes, but still....it was a LOT of food to be eating at once.  Let's just say I regretted that binge for a while afterwards, especially because I did 45 minutes on the spin bike and 45 minutes of weights like an hour afterwards, but it was totally worth it!!!!
2014-07-17,5,Everytime I go here the slice is impeccable. I've never been disappointed! (And I'm an Italian woman who loooooves her pizza, not only but also a chef so I'm hard to impress!)It's always nice and crispy yet doughy crust, perfect flavor in the sauce, and exactly the right amount of cheese. I'm always satisfied! Not only is it good, but appropriately prices. $2.75 for a well sized slice of deliciousness!I recently had my sons 2nd birthday and was so busy that week with things instead of cooking we ordered from pizza republic.. Atleast 10 people at the party made it a point to approach me and ask where the pizza was from and even for the number!They also do whole wheat pies which makes my health conscious man happy hahaOur son is a huge fan too .. When we walk by he goes "yummy pizza!" And can polish off a slice on his own! :)I also enjoy the atmosphere, everyone is always nice.. I often grab a slice before work and one time I didn't have my wallet and they told me "you're here all the time, catch us next time no problem!" And even urged me to grab a drink on the house. That's something you don't see at a lot of other places! That's the family feel of hoboken I love..Don't hesitate, grab a slice.. You won't be disappointed!
2014-07-08,3,I have very mixed feelings about pizza republic. First- the good. They have a pretty good Cobb salad with grilled chicken. The Greek salad was also pretty good. Total surprise for a pizza place.The bad- just about everything else I've ordered- chicken cutlet sandwich (deep fried to the point where the chicken dried up and I pitched it in the trash), chicken Marsala (sauce was terrible and the chicken wasn't so edible), and cavatelli and broccoli  (mushy and flavorless). Lessened learned- stick with the grilled chicken salads. Delivery is quick and the people on the phone are usually pleasant.
2014-06-20,5,Hoboken is a place where restaurants can give less than acceptable service with crappy food and get away with it because of the ambiance. Pizza republic does not fit this stereotype. The pizza is huge and its full of flavor. Their mac and cheese is out of this world. I originally was going to get the black truffle,  but after a conversation with the owner he recommend I try the four cheese mac and cheese and im glad he did. It had the right amount of cheese and it was a generous portion.What I really liked about this place was the service. I was greeted by the owner and t he workers with a kind smile and a genuine welcome. When I asked questions about the menu even though it was busy the owner answered my questions patiently and sincerely. Highly recommend this place but good luck finding parking outside.
2014-06-20,4,I found that they have the best salads in Hoboken. I also love their pizza .... Being a New Yawker weaned on the best pizzas in the country 'D, I find Pizza Republic has one of the Best in Hoboken! I've yet to try their Mac * Cheese but from what I hear it's really good. It gets recommended many times by locals and visitors.
2014-06-03,5,Pizza Republic is always our go to place when ordering out.  Our favorite is def. the Mac and Cheese dishes.  When ordering for the first time online, I made a mistake and choose whole wheat pasta for my husbands dish.  I called up and explained and they sent out a new order right away and no charge!!!! Awesome customer service!!!!
2014-05-30,4,Ordered this for lunch one day, it was between planet mac or this, but i chose pizza republic because of the reviews.They have a great selection of mac and cheeses, i ordered the new black truffle mac and cheese because I have never had black truffle before. Trust me it was a hard debate between the white truffle and the black. Anyway, i also ordered a side of garlic knots.the garlic knots were the best I have ever had. I got it delivered but they were still hot and fresh and soft and garlicky, it was awesome!I was a little disappointed with the black truffle mac and cheese however, maybe i just had high expectations. I read the white truffle was to die for so i assumed the black truffle would be similar. The portion is huge, definitely enough for 2 people. It was TOO cheesy for me though. Mind you, i love cheese, but this was just too much. It was a little bland but i just added some marinara sauce from my garlic knots to give it some flavor. Although i didnt like the black truffle, I would still definitely order from here because i want to try all the other ones!
2014-05-28,3,Three stars for food but four for cust service. Just ordered from here and my sandwich was not as ordered. They offered to send me another and were very apologetic. For that reason I would order again. Their Mac and cheese is  good too.
2014-05-26,4,Hands down, on my list for Mac and Cheese.It's funny because usually I would have to go into the city just to get Mac and cheese at that level. Good thing we found this place! We ordered bacon mac and four cheese - it was delicious. People here were so friendly and even made me laugh at a few jokes while I was waiting for my food. You would have never guessed they sold Mac from their store sign, but it's definitely a hidden gem of Hoboken. A must try.
2014-05-01,1,I had seen their sign "Mac Daddy of Hoboken." for awhile and was looking forward to trying the mac and cheese.  I had their pizza before which was just okay...not like pizza from NY, but edible.  I should have read the reviews before I decided to give it a try.   I ordered the Mexican Mac and my friend had their bacon mac.  They were both more Mac & GREASE with very little evidence of cheese.  The edges were burnt with dried out macaroni stuck to the sides of the aluminum pan and the mac tasted like the aluminum pan. We ended up going Five Guys since we couldn't actually eat it and were still hungry.  Lesson learned:  I know better than to try Mac & Cheese from a pizzeria again.  And I definitely need to read reviews BEFORE I decide to try something.
2014-04-23,5,I eat here about 3 times a week, The food is always homemade, the prices are very reasonable, the portions are perfect and the mac and cheese, well that's just hands down gourmet! my favorite is the Mexican.  Pizza is great, slices are decent sized, but the margarita slice is my favorite hands down.  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming with the TV on the wall and open kitchen.  Highly recommended.
2014-04-03,4,THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR MAC N CHEESE ONLY!Their Republic Mac N Cheese is something I crave on a bi-weekly basis. I'm kind of a mac n cheese snob (not ashamed) and the combination of cheddar and gorgonzola NEVER disappoints. Whether it's delivery, or eat-in (I almost prefer delivery because the flavors have more time to meld together), it's always piping hot, gooey, salty, cheesy deliciousness.
2014-04-01,5,Love eating here!!!!!!! The service is GREAT. Walking in you can tell everyone who works there is very attentive to the costumers. The food is even better. My favorite is the pizza of course and the Mac & Cheese. Love the location because its close to my job. If you want a good place to eat in hoboken i recommend Pizza Republic for sure!!!!
2014-03-01,1,They scrapped the regular price off the menu and charged us $4 a slice for cold rubbery pizza. While we ate we watched an employee make pizza boxes. He placed the wax paper sheets in the pizza boxes by licking his finger touching the paper in the middle on the top and putting it in the box. His saliva will be on each slice for the next 100 boxes of pies that go out the door. Mangia!
2014-02-20,5,The mac and cheese isn't always exactly the same from day to day but it's always delicious. Very healthy portions. I've never finished an entire pan myself and usually get two full meals out of it which is great for the price.
2014-02-18,4,Great Pizza. Got it delivered and it was on the money. Cant say anymore.
2014-02-06,3,Good enough, but staff needs to pay attention to what customers are saying. Orders are frequently incomplete and mistake prone. Owners don't make the mistakes but the staff does, every day.
2014-02-03,3,I'd been walking by this place for months salivating over the prospect of so many different varieties of mac 'n' cheese. I don't usually eat it because it's so fattening but today was a snowy day and I just decided to go for it.I opted for the-four cheese.  The price was rather steep ($9 with tax) but considering how rich it is you get about three servings, so it evens out. Flavor wise, I'd rate it just okay. Also, and it's hard to imagine it's possible for something with "cheese" in its name, it's actually too cheesy. It drips off the fork. I'd say it could use about 25% more macaroni to match the cheese-pocalypse. As I say, it's too cheesy but I still have a couple of servings left so I can add more macaroni of my own.Nobody beats my grandma's mac and cheese though.
2014-02-02,3,Good chicken tenders and meaty wings, what you'd expect from a pizzeria.  Decent sandwiches.  Haven't tried the pizza.Update: could use a friendlier staff, woman behind the counter was nasty.
2014-02-01,5,As the saying goes; "if it ain't broke don't fix it" and the bacon Mac N Cheese ain't broke at all! Mac was nice and cheesy, had great flavor, tasted great and looked fantastic..The service was prompt and professional as the guy at the counter helped me to narrow down my selection. They have a variation of menu items. The portion size is large, so you get your money's worth with some left over :) Overall great experience, the place was clean the staff is friendly and informative and the service is quick.
2014-01-27,2,The wings we ordered were pretty good, but the gluten free pizza was unsatisfactory. Won't order that from here again.
2014-01-27,3,Ordered a Cobb Salad for lunch and it came out to about $12, including the deliver fee. received it in a timely manner, but here's my deal. You have to pay an extra $4 for crispy chicken. Really? I'll pass. Luckily, the grilled chicken was tasty.
2014-01-02,1,Pizza Republic recently started advertising that they offer gluten-free pasta for their mac and cheese.  I was excited to try it out.  After ordering a traditional mac with gf pasta, I waited about 20 minutes for my food to come out.  I noticed immediately that my food had breadcrumbs in it.  Um...ordering gf pasta and then having them put breadcrumbs on it kinda defeats the purpose of the whole gluten-free thing.  I sent it back and they took another 15 minutes to re-make it.  I ended up dumping it in the trash because I didn't trust that they knew what they were doing.There was one woman working there who was legitimately sorry and tried to accommodate, but overall a bad gluten-free experience. Definitely will not return.
2013-12-04,5,There are seriously not enough awesome things to say about this place. I love pizza and I LOOOVE macNcheese. And here they are under the same roof!I've only ever had bites of their pizza as every time I'm in I always order a macNcheese skillet. Even the bites of pizza I've had are good and the slices are HUGE.My heart lies with the skillets though. They always come out piping hot and cheesy and it's just pure golden, gooey heaven.
2013-11-26,5,Out of all the pizza in town I love the pizza here! It is doughy, the sauce is really tasty, and not too heavy on the cheese!Edit: we ordered a tray of their baked ziti for a family party at the apartment and it was really great -All of our guests loved it! :)
2013-10-30,3,PR really lets you get to the heart of your passion for bready bready cheesey meaty goodness.I can't speak to the mac and cheese, but I do enjoy their subs (meatball parm is my favorite) and any kind of salad with their red wine vinaigrette is a good choice.  Their pizza is good, again, not the best in Hoboken but decent for that particular block.It fits the bill for dinner on the cheap and you can order through seamless any time of day.  Good for late nights, midday, early evening, dinner, lunch, snack, and any time in between.Also: very good drunk food if you find yourself walking around that area of Washington Street post-bar scene...or are drunkenly ordering food from your seamless app.
2013-10-10,1,My experience with this place overall was disappointing. I ordered 1 mac and cheese dish (the Mexican style one) and 1 order of baked ziti. I was kept waiting about 20-25 minutes for both of these items. Multiple people had come in, placed orders, received their food and left, as I sat there and waited. When I got my food, I walked home with my friend to finally eat dinner. I was just as disappointed with the quality of the food. When a place advertises as specializing in Mac & Cheese, you expect quality food. This Mac & Cheese was not good at all. It was dry, seemed old and just had no real taste. The baked ziti was no better - just tasted bad overall. Not to mention an hour or so later, both my friend and I didn't feel well...leads me to believe the food was probably old, since it definitely tasted as if it was left sitting out under a heating lamp. This was a big let down, my friend was visiting from out of town and it really put a damper on the end of her visit. I'd never do go there again. Even though they have other options on the menu, the wait alone was a big enough turn off.
2013-10-02,2,I've ordered from Pizza Republic before and have, up until my latest order, enjoyed their food (the white truffle mac and cheese in particular is delicious).  However, my boyfriend and I were a little disappointed with a recent delivery order.  We ordered a large pizza and noticed that the delivery time was taking longer than usual.  After waiting about an hour, we called to check on the status.  The girl we spoke with was rude and abruptly told us that the order was "already out" before quickly hanging up.  Not really the kind of service you would hope for.  The pizza arrived soon after and was a little greasier than we were used to.  I'll order pizza elsewhere from now on, but I would definitely order the white truffle mac and cheese again.
2013-09-27,3,I really wanted to like them. We ordered through seamless. Delivery was inside the time limit. I ordered the San garnere Mac. It had Italian sausage, pepper, onion tomatoes. I was shocked how large the portion was. I could save it and feed my family on thanksgiving with that size. They get plus. Unfortunately, I have to take the star back. I HATED IT!! It was dry- the panko crumbs on top were hard. It had no flavor. It was no creaminess to it whatsoever. The sausage was nasty.. They put to much. I took only 4 bites and had to count it as another money loss. My husband got the fries and chicken strips. Nothing special.Although I wasn't happy with them, I am willing to give them another try. The next time I'll just order the basic. If its dry and no flavor... It's a wrap. Won't try them ever..
2013-09-12,3,Ok not too happy :( got the classic and it's oily and not so tasty, I mean not bad but I wouldn't come back for it. Wish I would've stuck to my original plain of Indian food because this is not worth the calories.
2013-08-28,4,I've only tried the salads here but they are delicious. I would definitely recommend pizza republic for a good salad or if you are in the need for some delivery.
2013-08-23,1,I used to think this place was ok (Benny Tudinos is so much better) but today something happened that I think I need to bring to the towns attention being in the food service industry myself. We had our meal delivered only after digging in and thinking it was ours to realize it actually was not correct. When we called back to let them know this and ask for a correct order they told us the driver delivered the wrong order to us and our order was at someone else's place!  So the RIGHT and LEGAL thing to do is to replace both orders as quickly as possible but instead the delivery person delivered our meal after like 15 min (which was so cold at this point) and asked for the other wrong meal back meaning that they brought each of us our correct food after being in the other persons apartment which is ILLEGAL!  I am speaking with the necessary parties about this horrible situation but in the meantime I wanted you to know how they handle this type of situation. No good.
2013-08-14,3,pizza was good. mac and cheese was like a big bowl of cheese with some macaroni in it. it was very intense so if you think your even a little bit laktos intolerant i would stay away. every one that worked there was super nice.
2013-07-22,4,Salads are the best menu items. The mac and cheese is creative, but sometimes a little dry (needs more cheese). The specialty steak sandwich with Gorgonzola is large and delicious. The pizza is not the best in town -- it's doughy.
2013-07-14,1,Waited two hours for delivery and they 'forgot' most of the food I ordered.  Said they would bring it back but never came.  Would never order from here again.
2013-06-27,4,I like their pizza a lot.  It's been very good every time I order from them or stop by.  The main issue I have had with this place are some really questionable delivery people.  I haven't had delivery from them in a while because of it, but I will stop in for a couple of slices sometimes.  I hope they hire better delivery people so I feel more comfortable ordering delivery from them.
2013-05-25,4,Solid spot for delivery or takeout. Some of the best pizza in town, and their salads are fresh and delicious. I'm a big fan of their spinach salad, and if you add grilled chicken, you get a solid 8-10oz of chicken. The boyfriend usually gets the subs, and they are enormous. Mac and cheese is decent. Good choice for all your pizza and pizza related cravings in Hoboken!
2013-04-23,5,By far one of the best pizza places in hoboken, and the mac and cheese is also awesome. You defiantly get your money's worth here.
2013-02-24,5,Great pizza (even my toddler loves it). Great mac and cheese, although really bad for my diet. Which makes it great food.
2013-02-23,2,I literally was left waiting at the counter for 10 min trying to buy a bottle of water. I eventually put the bottle back and walked out the store. Although, their mac and cheese (this is a judgement based entirely on aesthetics) looks pretty edible.
2013-02-09,4,Stopped in here for a quick bite with niki c in hopes of finding some eats to calm us until we got home... And I'm quite happy I did! White truffle - great for vegetarians, and AMAZING.Cheeseburger - just the right amount of meat chunks and bread crumbs Ask for it to be extra cheesy for all you cheese lovers out there (me). I'm sure it's good with regular cheese, but this put it over the top!
2013-02-08,4,"The Mac Dad will make you - Jump! Jump!" -Kris KrossThis joint is nicknamed "The Mac Daddy of Hoboken" and Jump is certainly what their freakin' mac & cheese made me do!  Here I was, innocently trying to prevent a hangover while chilling on the couch with some friends, but after taking the first bite of this incredible mac & cheese, I HAD to keep jumping up off the couch for some more!!SO glad I stopped by this place the other night after a Yelp Elite event where the cocktails were a flowin'!  So my boy "Shams T." and I were in the midst of after party planning at our building and decided to get not one but two mac & cheeses to go:  The Cheeseburger was incredible and everything you could want if you are a meat lover like me!  Creamy in the middle with ground beef all throughout and a lovely, bread-crumby crust on top!  Yes, I realize this sounds a bit like hamburger helper, but trust me - I would not steer you wrong!  Besides, I can also recommend the White Truffle Mac & Cheese if you identify more with the bourgeoisie set - divinely decadent with white truffle & parmigiano reggiano!  Ahh - I swoon!
2012-12-27,2,Proof that marketing is just as important as food.  Pizza Republic has a cool name, decor, and slogans.  That seems to be enough to get it a bunch of customers.  I was drawn to this place also. How disappointed I was.  The food here is not good, its pretty standard.  Tried the Mac n Cheese a couple times because they claimed it was the best in Hoboken.  First time the Mexican, which was pretty much flavorless.  Then the 4 cheese which was also flavorless.  What I don't think they understand is Mac n Cheese is only good if it is creamy.  Here they just melting some cheese over a heap of macaroni in the pizza oven.  Also the Cheese:Macaroni:Toppings ratio is pretty bad, seemed like it was 70% macaroni.  Compare the Mac n Cheese at Mike Squared to here and you'll see the difference.Pizza Republic is just a very average pizzeria,  The cool sign, cool name, and cool font's doesn't = good food.
2012-12-12,4,First and foremost, the pizza here is decent, though it isn't anything special.  This place is your typical pizzeria that has your specialty pizzas, subs, heroes, calzones, pasta, and other Italian style dishes.  However, what is GREAT here is their mac & cheese!You would not know it by the name "Pizza Republic", but once you see their sign outside for the different kinds of Mac & Cheese, you should be intrigued to try one of them.   They have around 14 different types of Mac & Cheese platters to choose from.  Out of the ones that I have tried, here are my personal favorite Mac & Cheeses:White Truffle  -- Parmigiano Reggiano & White Truffle The Mac Daddy  -- Meatballs, sausage, cheddar & homemade sliced crispy onion rings.Four Cheese -- Cheddar, American, Monterey jack and Asiago cheeses.The others I've tried included:San Gennaro -- Cheddar and  American cheeses, Italian sausage, onions & peppersPesto  -- Pesto, goat cheese, white cheddar & Gorgonzola.Take a look at the Mac & Cheese menu yourself, and see what you may want to try, people will always have different tastes!As for the prices, all the Mac & Cheeses are around $9 (except for the Mac Daddy at $11) and you get a pretty sizable platter.  I can honestly say they give you a lot for the price you pay and its a great bang for your buck price.The decor is like a normal pizzeria and if you want to try something different and good, don't go here for the pizza, just try the Mac & Cheese! Note: They are able to take orders online from their website, so that can help if you're into doing that.  I have never tried getting food this way though.
2012-12-07,5,Try the mexican or pesto mac and cheese. Also the mac and cheese poppers are incredible. And their cheese fries! They are carb masters.I actually think their pizza is great too, especially their specialty pies. Try the white pie with tomato and fresh garlic, and the mexican chili pie (your choice of meat or veggie chili). Out of the salads, I'd recommend the arugula.I order for delivery from them constantly and have never been dissatisfied! Their online ordering is also easy and convenient, and they'll immediately call you if there are any issues with your online order.
2012-10-15,5,So this is a review for just their mac n cheese and garlic knots. And for that I give five stars because this has got to be one of the best mac n cheese Ive had in a long time.Let's be honest, the place isn't the nicest on the inside but who the heck cares when you're indulging in cheese bubbling, crispy bread crumb covered, skillet served truffle mac n cheese! The girl we ordered from was definitely right when she said that it was enough for 3 people to share. I ordered a side of garlic knots and dipped the fluffy balls of dough into the cheesy goodness. carbs with a side of carbs. why not. My friends ordered two slices of pizza but ended up taking one of them home because the mac n cheese was so much. Pizza looked okay, nothing out of this world. But I would definitely come back to try another one of their MANY mac n cheese options.
2012-09-03,5,The pizza was great. Their Mac and Cheese was unbelievable!
2012-09-02,3,The Pizza's not worth raving over, but their $6 wrap special at lunch is a great value - 1/2 wrap, salad or fries and a soda! Their multiple creative Mac-n-Cheese options are pretty yummy, too. Great for getting food to go.
2012-07-25,5,If you are looking for AMAZING food, quick and friendly service and a  great variety of food that is not found in your everyday Pizzeria then you are golden with Pizza Republic.  Their Mac and Cheese is insane, their pizza is awesome, I thought their garlic knots were really fresh and kind of addicting.  This is the perfect place to order from on Friday nights when you are hanging in with friends and some beers.PS:  They also have rad salads for the healthy eaters out there.
2012-07-19,2,Their mac and cheese is good, not great.DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING DELIVERED! It will take well over an hour and be stone cold when it gets to you.
2012-07-12,1,I ordered delivery from this place about 5 times now...1 time was good the others however were significantly worse and the last delivery I got prompted me to write this 1 star review.I ordered a meat lovers pie...i threw out 6 of the 8 slices.the pepperoni was soooo nasty the meatballs tasted funny and the pizza WAS EXTREMELY SALTY...like EXTREME.it was difficult to eat.I will never ever order from here again based on that pie alone...
2012-07-07,5,Although I have never actually eaten in Pizza Republic, I order delivery with them all the time. I can't comment on their pizza because I've never actually gotten it, but the other food I have tried from them is AMAZING.Their mac and cheeses are outrageously good (and huge, you really get a bang for your buck). I really enjoy the truffle mac, which has to be my favorite, but I've tried a few others and like them as well.Their disco fries are awesome. You can feel your arteries closing as you eat them. Their fried mac and cheese balls are absolutely addicting.I actually just ordered a mozzarella tomato sandwich from them, thinking it would be a normal sandwich size because I didn't want something too large or heavy. I received a FOOTLONG sandwich. Mozzarella, tomato, roasted peppers, balsamic, basil all on a ciabatta sub. I obviously couldn't finish it but I'm definitely saving the rest for later. Delicious.Overall, their delivery is fast, their food is great (if you're looking for something not so healthy), and it always hits the spot. I highly recommend this place.
2012-06-29,2,i stopped in for pizza and mac n cheese and i was thoroughly unimpressed.pizza: not the worst i've had but not great considering hoboken standards. sauce and cheese were good, bread tasted very unfresh, dry, and generic.  with benny's a block away, i have no reason to have this pizza ever againmac n cheese: SUCKED. i love cheese and carbs so this should have been an easy win.  WAYY too much cheese- crappy, fake, oily, tasteless cheese. it cost me an offensive $9.  me and my bf (both total porkers) only ate a third. we paused munching for about 5 min (tv) and when we returned to the mac n cheese, it was a solid, nasty-ass mass of inedible garbage. with kraft and velveeta available in A&P nearby, i have no reason to have this mac n cheese ever again.to add insult to injury, the staff wears shirts that say "gourmet pizza".  what a joke. there is nothing remotely gourmet about anything at pizza republic.
2012-06-28,4,Oh man, this place has a lot of varieties of Yum. Their Pizza is good to great, usually the latter. But here's where it starts to get amazing. Their Macaroni dishes and various french fry dishes are incredible! Nice staff, overall friendly service, this is the place when you want to reward yourself for going off your diet or cure your hangover. It is delicious. A Hoboken must. Your waistline will hate you but your stomach will love you. Oh yah, their delivery service is good too.
2012-06-26,4,Pizza Republic has great WHITE pizza, and I'm also a big fan of their giant party pie for when my kids have parties at home.  The mac and cheese is also delicious, but I try not to order it too often, as I'm sure it's so unhealthy (but delicious)!
2012-05-23,2,The pizza isn't terrible, but it's nothing to write home about either. The garlic knots tasted like they were stale, which is not very appetizing. But probably the worst thing is that I ordered my food for delivery (from Seamless) at 7:53pm (Yes, I am being exact here). They rang my buzzer to deliver my food at 9:15pm. No offense, but if I'm going to wait over an hour and 15 minutes for food, it better be amazing. But alas, I am left trying to force down cold pizza at 9:35pm because it's either that or go to bed hungry.Try somewhere else- at least for delivery.
2012-05-16,5,Can I just say, I like to personally refer to myself as some what of a Mac and Cheese connoisseur. I LOVE all things Mac and Cheese. While I have tried lots of different types of Mac and Cheese in and around the city the Mac and Cheese here is superb, some of the best I have ever had. Not only was the staff, nice and courteous they were pretty funny too!  I ordered the Bacon Mac and Cheese and it was top notch. If you love Mac and Cheese as much as I do, this place, my friend will be your paradise. Tell them NYC Mac and Cheese girl sent ya :)I think I might need to move to Hoboken. My mind is telling me yes, and my thighs are telling me noooooooo.
2012-04-26,2,Had a late night at work, so I used my seamless app to find a good place. Haven't ordered from Pizza Republic before, so thought it would give it a shot. I placed my order at 7:45 and shortly after received a phone call saying I owed an extra $3 that Seamless didn't charge. I was too tired to question it, so I said ok. Flash forward to 9:00 and I'm still waiting for the food. It finally gets to me at 9:15.It's hard to rate food when it;s room temperature. I don't know if the driver got lost or if he made 9 deliveries before mine, but the food wasn't even close to being warm. Not likely to give them a second shot.
2012-04-03,2,Blech. Save your mac and cheese indulgences for another place. Breadcrumbs are nice but not when the mac and cheese is dry. And tasteless.Garlic knots were little hockey pucks too.
2012-04-01,5,The cobb salad is where its at.Probably one of the best ever!Delivery is VERY quick too.
2012-03-26,4,Went here with my brother, his gf, and my other buddy Nobel since he gets his haircut next door. I've always walked passed Pizza Republic and have heard rave about their Mac n Cheese. If my review of this place is based on how happy  my tummy was, this rating suffices. I'm actually surprised to see this place rated so low with fellow yelpers, but then again I haven't tried their pizza yet.We ordered two Mac n Cheese meals to split among four: the Mac Daddy and Pesto. Being incredibly bias to pesto, that was naturally my favorite. The crumbs, pesto, and cheese were well blended, although I'll admit a tad oily. If healthiness isn't on your mind, this is obviously a non-issue lolThe Daddy was essentially a loaded dish of Mac n Cheese: sausage, cheese, crumbs, and a ton of onion straws on top. That dish, although good, did not impress me as much as the pesto despite its more generous portion.I'm definitely coming back here as a promise to my brother and friend. We're going to try ordering every Mac n Cheese on the menu. Yeah. We're fat.
2012-03-13,2,Went here today grabbed a slice of buffalo chicken pizza ..i liked it..it tasted like the chicken was marinated in like a hot sauce or something..either way it was ok, i was full off of 1 slice, I also ordered to go the Mexican Mac n cheese since this is SUPPOSE TO BE Hoboken's mac n cheese destination...I beg to differI am not 1 to wast food but i ended up throwing it away..there was NOTHING special about it..it just seemed like a bowl of boiled elbow macaroni noodles with some basic ass cheese on it...for $9 i expected it to really look or at least at set much better than it did...I may grab a slice but thats all from here.
2012-03-03,4,Oh-em-gee! Best macaroni and cheese ever! You must try the Four Cheese Mac & Cheese. Heard good things about their mac and cheese, so I had to try it out. This dish is gooey, cheesy goodness topped with toasted, crusty bread crumbs. Delicious! The combined texture of the cheesy macaroni with the crispy bread crumbs really went well together. This place also has other varieties of macaroni and cheese like White Truffle Mac & Cheese, Pesto Mac & Cheese, and their famous Mac Daddy Mac & Cheese with meatballs, sausage and crispy onion rings. I definitely have to go back if I ever hit up Hoboken soon! As for the pizza, I haven't tried, so I have no say in the pizza.
2011-12-31,4,4 star rating based on the Mac n cheese.  With a sign outside they boast to be Hoboken's Mac n cheese destination.  The short Mexican cashier wasn't the friendliest and the place kinda had a fast food restaurant ambiance.  We didn't have pizza so I don't know bout that.  My girlfriend and I ordered a single 4 cheese Mac n cheese dish for around $9.  It came out in an iron skillet.  It was very good, the cheese was flavorful and the pasta was cooked very well.  My girl wants me to say that it was "really really cheesy".  The best part of it was the crusty bread crumbs atop the cheese.  It added good texture and completed the dish.  One skillet is more than enough for 2 people.  So again four stars based on the dish itself.  I believe the three star rating is closer to the truth though.
2011-11-01,1,Worst buffalo chicken pizza ever.  Oh yeah, their mac and cheese sucks too.  Buffalo Chicken Pizza with tomato sauce underneath???  It tasted like a cheese pizza slathered in Musclemaker's Texas Chicken Strip sauce.  Just awful.  Got the sausage and peppers mac and cheese.  It was almost like they held the cheese.  Totally unacceptable.  Don't call yourself the "mac daddy" of Hoboken if your mac and cheese blows.
2011-10-19,3,I ordered delivery from  Pizza Republic last night.  It was alright.  I had to try the mac n cheese after seeing that it was one of the specialties on the menu.  I received an extra 15% off for ordering through Delivery.com.  This discount wasn't available through SeamlessWeb. Based on the reviews, I ordered the Parmesean and Truffle Oil Mac n Cheese.  Someone wrote that it wasn't cheesy enough so I added extra mozzerella.  However, I thought it was TOO CHEESY.  I probably would have been better off just getting it normal without any other extras.  I also ordered the Brocolli Rabe (appetizer), but it was very very salty and buttery.  They give you half a loaf of bread with this dish.  The quantity of food was alot though.  I definitely will be eating this for 2 more meals today and tomorrow.Next time, I'll try the caprese mac n cheese because it's got lots of good reviews too.
2011-10-02,3,I like the sandwiches they make here. I would pass on the other stuff. Make sure you get the sandwich untoasted. When they say toasted they mean your sandwich will be like a rock when you bit it. If you order an entree the bread that comes with it is also as hard as a god damn rock. This place gets a 3 because they have some good sandwiches. Other than that I think I would pass on the other items.
2011-09-18,4,Best Mac&Cheese.Should be called Moms' Pizza place. Place is Full of Moms and Kids. Pizza is great too. Big portion and tasted great.
2011-09-09,2,Bring your Dog & sit outside! OR do Takeout ~ Best Mac N' Cheese ~ Good $5.50 Lunch Specials Restaurant & Pizzeria - Pizza Republic was formerly called "Filippo's" and is now under new ownership of Greggory Kronhaus. I just had a very nice evening here with my friend, we both brought our dogs and ate dinner for four (us + 2 dogs) for under $20.00. You can sit outside order at the counter and they bring it out to you. This place is known for their incredible mac n' cheese so I of course had to try that, they also have my all time favorite kind of pizza, buffalo chicken, disappointed with the pizza but loved their specialty mac n' cheese. I have heard some vague things about their new gourmet salads so that remains to be determined. Alli's Report Card:Food: Some great specialty items such as the mac n' cheese, however the pizza is not so good.  Pizza Republic has some good specialty pizzas such as buffalo chicken, grandma's style (square pie with cheese on the bottom) and pizza salad (arugula, vegetables, parmesan). Slices are $2.75 and they are nice and big. The pizza was not very good, the buffalo chicken pizza was a little too much tomato sauce and not enough buffalo sauce, overcooked, not cheesy enough and had to ask for blue cheese, uh hello blue cheese should be drizzled/baked on there or AT least come on the side. Truffle Mac n' Cheese ($8.95) totally awesome. Cheesy with parmesan reggiano & white truffle baked with bread crumbs on top, served in a crock. The portions are big so you can have it for lunch the next day. Warning don't build your own they charge $1.50 per topping. Lunch specials are $5.50 for slice of pizza and can of soda. Booze: Does not exist.Decor/Layout: Regular pizza joint, some tables outside with umbrellas. Servers: Staff will bring your food out to you but you order at the counter. Girl could have been sweeter, guy servers were funny they loved our dogs. Plating: For a pizza place - not too shabby my mac n' cheese came in a crock with a little sleeve for the handle, nice touch. Date Night: Could make for a nice casual encounter. Girls Night: Skip this place, if you're in the mood for pizza go somewhere a little more festive. Large Party Gathering of Friends: Nah, this place is a bit small.
2011-07-22,2,Ordered the garlic knots and caprese mac&cheese-The garlic knots were undercooked, and therefore had doughy textures. The mac & cheese was overpriced, and unflavorful. You honestly would have no idea it was caprese unless someone told you. Mac Daddy of Hoboken? I don't think so.
2011-07-17,5,Magnificent mac & cheese! A bit of a wait for it, but worth it. Fantastic fries too.
2011-05-29,1,Yuch!  Salty, old slice, Pepsi products, and flies.  I know a lot of people like Pizza republic, but I'm wondering if they're drunk when they eat it!
2011-05-21,2,Mediocre food.  Also..don't ever make the mistake of "building" your own mac n cheese.  Cheddar mac and cheese with mushroom, bacon, jalepeno, and olive ended up costing $14.  They charge like $1.50 per topping and they are VERY skimpy.
2011-05-07,3,One drunken night in Hoboken, my boyfriend and I were trying to find a place where we could simply use the restroom, and we stumbled into Pizza Republic. We didn't buy any pizza, but I took a menu home with me.Fast forward 2 weeks later, completely sober, and completely starving. I literally had a dream of mac n cheese and woke up craving it. A light shined onto my pizza republic takeout menu from the drunken night 2 weeks prior, and when I saw they had not only mac n cheese, but a ton of varieties, my boyfriend and I headed over there.I ordered the parmesan and white truffle mac n cheese (I forget the exact name) and my boyfriend ordered the Mac Daddy (sausage, meatballs, cheddar, american, and fried onion rings). I thought after ordering it that I should've told htem ot add ricotta or mozzarella since mine didn't sound like it would be super cheesy, but it was too late.I was right...it was hardly mac n cheese. It was basically pasta in oil. You couldn't taste ANY cheese. The bread crumbs added a nice touch, but if I was to order this one again, I would definitely do as I thought and add ricotta. My boyfriend's Mac Daddy tasted a little cheesier, but not as cheesy as we would've liked. Everything was super oily, hardly cheesy, and not creamy at all.I would still maybe go back if I was in Hoboken and happened to be craving Mac n cheese, but I'd never go out of my way again. Also, the woman serving us wasn't exactly friendly.
2011-04-24,4,I was visiting hoboken and seen this places mac and cheese menu so i had a bacon mac and cheese it was awesome. I took advantage of the outdoor seating which was very nice if your a people watcher .The prices for the two bacon mac and cheeses and two bottles of water were $22.50 which is a little pricey since its about the same i pay at mac bar in soho but the portions were good so it didn't sting too bad.I recommend giving this a shot
2011-04-06,4,tired of pizza? then again hoboken has tons of spots that has pizza spots, gino's, benny's but heck i gave pizza republic a shot. for one get there cheese garlic bread its so good. then me and my boyfriend got the mac and cheese....  it is god! and they have different flavor mac and cheese. need something different that is also comfort food this is the spot to go!
2011-02-24,4,Honestly, I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn't such a cheapskate.Went here for dinner with two of my very good friends after work last night.   None of us had eaten much that day, so we were pretty hungry to say the least.  Each of us ordered a mac & cheese dish (one ordered tuna, the other ordered cheeseburger, and I ordered the caprese).  With a bottled soda, each came out to a little under $12.  My experience with mac & cheese was making it out of a box in college either studying late at night, drunk, or exhausted.  In any case, I wasn't expecting much.The portions look average upon first receipt, but we quickly realized we were definitely bringing home left overs!  It was definitely filling!  Each plate came out on skillet-like dishes with a handle wrapped with an oven mitt thing.  Piping hot and delicious!  I tried both of the other dishes, but not enough to write a decent review.  My caprese mac & cheese was amazing!  The presentation was beautiful - the m&c was topped with toasted bread crumbs, a whole sun dried (Roma?) tomato, and some whole basil leaves (there were also tomatoes and basil throughout the dish).  I was pleasantly surprised at the cheese - it was so gooey and smooth (and not orange like I was used to)!Service was good.  Everyone who worked there was polite, made conversation, and checked up on us from time to time.  We met up here for a reunion of sorts, so we were definitely not meek as mice.  They didn't seem to mind.  It was pretty empty, but a bunch of people came in to pick up orders and didn't stay to eat.All in all, I enjoyed my meal and if I come back, I will be splitting my mac & cheese with someone!
2011-01-26,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PIZZERIA! Yes, the very best in Hoboken. Wanna taste the GREATEST meatballs in the Tri-state? GO there. I never ordered anything that wasn't delicious. The staff is wonderful & delivery is quick. Benny's who? P.S. You MUST try the mac & cheese. The "Kid" Mac comes with chicken strips and is big enough for 3 kids. My 3 year old son wouldn't eat anywhere else.
2011-01-19,4,I waited about 20 minutes for my food, chicken hero.to tell you the truth I think they forgot the order, once I got it though it was delicious! My friend got the lunch special: two pizzas and a soda. I'd definitely go back for the lunch speacial.
2011-01-16,1,Maybe it was the time of the evening but the chicken roll was a little stale and the mac n cheese we ordered was a little bland.   I'm not a big mac n cheese fan, but I LOVE when the Brass Rail's bar menu version of it.  Or even S'mack in the city...  And I have dreamier visions of the chicken rolls I've had at a Costco...  A 3rd member of my party said the pizza slice was ok but she wanted to pick it up but the eggplant on it was heavier than the pizza could hold.  Afterwards, I wish there was an undo button I could have hit.
2010-12-07,4,We decided to eat in at Pizza Republic because of their ads touting their mac n'cheese. We shared the garlic bread and two mac n'cheeses - the gorgonzola and the tuna between the two of us.Liked: The mac n'cheeses were fabulous!   And very good portion sizes - you can definitely share an order and even have some left over Disliked: the service (but then again, it's a fast food joint), the garlic breadWould I come back: Yes!  for the mac n'cheese!
2010-11-24,5,I've eaten everything here from the pizza, to the mac and cheese, to the entrees and it has all been great... the owner is extremely friendly and you can tell he really cares a ton about running a successful business.  I eat here at least once a week, my favorites: the chicken parm, hamburger mac n cheese, and of course you can never go wrong with a couple of slices
2010-11-14,4,I am a fan of their mac & cheese, but not their pizza. First, I should mention that I am not usually a mac & cheese fan as I find the dish to be rather boring (the whole dish is the same thing) but their mac & cheese is done well enough (baked to a nice crisp up top) that I would actually eat it.  There was enough soft, velvety cheese, flavor and crispiness to it so that every bite was slightly different, offering some form of variety in this basic dish. The ambiance is that of a pizza place - not the place to bring your first date.
2010-10-06,5,Mmmm... hamburger mac & cheese... Mmmm... I ventured in here to go and decided I needed a little bit of protein with my heaps of cheese and pasta - so glad I went that route! I ordered my dinner to go, so they baked the mac & cheese in a pie tin instead of in a crock. It really retained it's heat the entire walk home. When I got home... gloriousness! It was so yummy! Plus, 1 serving of mac & cheese literally lasted me for 5 meals! No joke. And the beef in the dish was excellent and seasoned, not just added hamburger meat. Dear Republic, I am a fan and in the words of the Governator, "I'll be back."
2010-09-30,4,*review of delivery, i haven't yet been there in person!the thing that turned me on was the wheat crust option, which can be difficult to find unless you're making the pizza yourself. so i went through the ordering thing on seamless, got the confirmation email and like 2 minutes later got a call from the restaurant telling me that they had run out of their whole wheat crust and wanted to know if they still should continue with my order.disappointed--sure but more so psyched that they called to let me know, rather than just make the pizza and send it to me anyway.so of course i still wanted my pizza, and when it came it was awesome. loaded with toppings and perfectly cooked. (loaded w/toppings to compensate for the lack of wheat crust? maybe? i dont care!)i'll have to try the mac and cheese next, but the pizza is good, go eat some!
2010-08-09,4,While venturing on delivery.com, I came across one of those coupons for 15% off the first order for Pizza Republic and boy am I glad I ordered from here!! This has quickly become one of my favorite delivery places with their superior all around food. Despite what a lot of negative reviews had said, I received my pie all the way in Jersey City in a little over a half hour. I definitely have no complaints about the service... yet...With a name like Pizza Republic of course the first thing I'm going to try here is the pizza. I had a pepperoni and sausage which turned out to be one of the better pies that I've had out here in jersey. The ingredients are pretty fresh and the crust is thin and crunchy-- just the way I like it! They also offer whole wheat crust for the health addicts, which makes it a little saltier and adds a kinda weird taste to it. But all in all the pies are pretty solid and come at a decent price.What really makes this place stand apart from every other pizza place in Jersey is the Mac n Cheese!! Be sure to include this on the order, especially if you're going to take advantage of the 15% off coupon!! There's about 8 different varieties of mac n cheese and I experimented with the bacon mac n cheese--- doesn't bacon make EVERYTHING better?? This has to be some of the best mac n cheese that I've had in some time, and I'm not even a huge fan of mac n cheese! Everything was heated up perfectly and this is definitely the real deal-- not the velveeta crap they give you at cluck u or atomic wings. I will be sure to never forget to add on some mac n cheese to my order from now on!Some of the best takeout I've had in a long time, but honestly this place should be called Mac N Cheese Republic... its too bad the pizza couldn't get me as excited as the mac, otherwise this would be a 5 star no brainer
2010-06-25,2,Had pizza there a few times. It's ok, but no way does it beat Benny's.I'd go back, but definitely not the best pizza in town.
2010-05-03,3,While walking downtown looking for a bite after work, a buddy suggested we head here. I was in the mood to pizza anyway, but didn't feel like Gios or Benny's, so I figured, what the hey, why not?I ordered a chicken roll and a buffalo slice, came out to around $10 or so, not too terrible, typical 'boken prices. I noticed that the one fellow behind the counter may have been italian, but that was it. The rest of the workers were spanish, asian, or of middle eastern descent. As an Italian myself, that kinda did perturb me a little bit, but I kept an open mind - some of the best sauce I ever had was cooked by a drunk Irish guy at the deli back home, and my German/Irish mother- albeit the latter learned from the best, la mia nonna da familia di mio padre, but I digress.Everything seemed fine except my buddy, who was standing behind me and waiting by the counter after I ordered, was still not recognized. Even after I sat down and waited for my food and he was standing there, no one bothered to take his order. Now granted, maybe they originally thought that we were sharing something, but I mean, he's a pretty big guy, there is no way that just a slice and a chicken roll would be enough for him alone, let alone both of us. Also he is rather soft spoken, so he wasn't about to speak up or say that he was waiting, despite numerous workers walking around behind the counter.He finally gets taken care of and orders the cheeseburger mac-and-cheese. It takes a little while, but comes out hot and fresh, so one can't really complain.I would like to try a couple of the other varieties of the mac-n-cheese. Anything with bacon is A-OK in my book ;)
2010-05-01,4,My friend's and I had a pizza and mac-n-cheese delivered to her place on a weekday afternoon. They didn't take too long to deliver, however, on other occasions, my friend said that they've taken over an hour. That might be a deterrent for some people... but the pizza is SO delicious. We had the goat cheese pizza and the mac-n-cheese caprese. Everything was amazing. I loooooved the mac-n-cheese so much! Pizza Republic... you are definitely a force to be reckoned with. Watch out Benny's!
2010-04-14,4,Having just moved into the area I was anxious to try to find a good pizza place. My boyfriend has been going to one or two places in Jersey City with his friends but I decided to put a little spin on things when I came down and it was my turn to order. Now we have a standing order for pizza; large pie with pepperoni and garlic. What arrives is a piping hot pie with just the right amount of sauce to cheese ratio and on a crust that's crispy but pliable enough to fold without snapping.  Pizza is not all they do well either.  Shortly after seeing them I also noticed people talking about their Mac & Cheese.  Indeed it is some of the best Mac & Cheese I have ever had outside my own kitchen.  Rest assured the stuff will kill you, but with 10 different varieties you'll be sure to find a kind you will like to share.  I've yet to find anything I'm disappointed with and for delivery it can't be beat.
2010-02-01,5,My  husband and I eat  here every Wed . with our grandaughter. It 's our favorite  pizza place in Hoboken. The pizza is consistently good and  everyone is very friendly. It's definitely kid friendly. Cleanliness is important to me and this place is very clean.
2010-01-25,4,We were on our way to Benny Tudinos and thought we would give this new place a try instead.Delicious. Its been awhile since I've had good pizza, and this was by far one of the best. Good sauce, even better than Benny's in my opinion.The owner was very friendly and raved about the mac and cheese, which I swore I would try next time.A good fit for Hoboken.
2010-01-10,1,I ordered from this place a few nights ago via delivery.com, mostly because they offered 25% off your first delivery order.The delivery took an hour and 20 minutes to arrive. When I called after an hour, they told me it would arrive 'any minute' . 20 minutes after that phone call was placed, my order arrived. It was ice cold and completely inedible.I called Pizza Republic to let them know that after waiting so long for my order to arrive, it was cold. The lady who I spoke to responded with "So what do you want me to do about it?" She offered to send out another order -- however, I was so fed up at this point, I told her I didn't feel like waiting another hour to eat.Delivery.com called to straighten things out (as I have been a loyal customer of Delivery.com for almost 3 years now), and Pizza Republic refused to issue me any sort of refund or apology.I will never order from this place again, nor will I ever step foot into Pizza Republic. You would think a place new to the neighborhood would do everything in the power to keep a good reputation.
2009-12-26,4,In between 4th and 5th Ave, at what once was Filippo's is the new Pizza Republic. Under new management, Pizza Republic enters a market all ready saturated with pizza places in a town with a proud Italian heritage, and replacing Filippo's is quite a task. For those that have been to Filippo's, the first thing you'll notice is the fresh facelift that Pizza Republic has gotten. Brand new furniture and decorations are able to give a modern feel without taking out the old school pizza place charm. You can order at the counter and the staff will bring out the food to after you sit down. The waitress/cashier was rough around the edges at first (which added to that old world pizza place charm), but warmed up once she cleared the busy restaurant. It's hard to miss their recession lunch special advertisement in front of their store for 2 slices and a drink for $5. It's even harder to ignore when you are on a tight college budget, but how does it stack up against the pizza benchmark of Hoboken? Although smaller than the slices I have grown accustomed to, their pizza was more firm and crispy than other Stevens favorites, which was a nice change of pace. However, I could not just evaluate a restaurant on their pizza alone. For an appetizer, I ordered their garlic knots and calamari. The knots were fresh, soft, and packed with garlic, but the calamari was a major disappointment. Although they used real squid, the calamari was far too chewy. The points they lost on the calamari, they more than made up for with their sausage and pepper sandwich and their homemade macaroni and cheese that I also had there. They had an assortment of mac and cheeses, and if they are all as good as their traditional, then you will be in for a real treat. The sausage and pepper sandwich was packed with delicious All items were at such reasonable prices that I was able to grab some desert a few doors over at Koa-Koa.While I may have subconsciously been comparing Pizza Republic with its predecessor, the current owners proved that they didn't just put lipstick on a pig. All the upgrades have not gone to waste, and really make Pizza Republic a force to be reckoned with.
2009-11-09,2,I ordered here using Delivery.com. They were running a special for 25% off your first order on there, so I figured I'd give it a shot. The delivery order took over an hour to arrive and the Pizza Republic delivery guy forgot our pizza and had to come back to make a second trip to deliver it (obviously it was cold by then).The wings were sub par, and I would not recommend them again. The veggie pie was average. The Calzone was a pretty decent value. Hopefulyl they can work out the kinks.
2009-11-02,4,Really nice meatball parm hero. Fresh, crusty bread. Great sauce/cheese. Even better the next day heated in the oven.
2009-09-09,4,I've only ordered once, but I'll definitely be ordering again!Average delivery. Average price. But, most importantly - delicious pizza. This town has some stuff competition, but I think Pizza Republic can hang with the best. We ordered a spinach and black olive pizza and it was flavorful, cheesy and awesome. I hope to try some new toppings in the near future!
2009-08-30,5,Ordered two times and had two awesome experiences.  Pizza was great and toppings were fresh - Crust cooked to perfection.   Everyone's experiences varies - Ciao!
