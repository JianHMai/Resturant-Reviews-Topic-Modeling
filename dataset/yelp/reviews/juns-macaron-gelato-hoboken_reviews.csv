2021-10-04,3,Tried Jun for the first time. I liked the cookie and cream ice cream. It was very sweet ans consistent. The rose lychee macaron was okay not very great.
2021-09-27,3,Very overpriced. Cake tastes like something you'd get from the supermarket. Same for the cookies. The nutella croissant donut id out of this world though. Insane that it costs $6 but it's really good.
2021-09-17,5,The carrot cake, salted caramel macarons, and dark chocolate hazelnut gelato here, will rock your world.
2021-09-09,4,Randomly found this spot while walking down Washington Street on a Saturday afternoon. Small dessert/drink shop with currently no seating inside (though there are three tables outside).Decided to split the Nutella-Filled Croissant Doughnut ($5.25). A bulky glazed doughnut filled with a substantial amount of the chocolate-hazelnut spread. Usually with these gimmicky items, the actual pastry is stale. This doughnut, however, was flaky and soft. Filling was a bit of an overkill, as it became too sweet by the end (thankfully was sharing, so was able to finish).Pricing is high, yet can't take anything away from the product. Worth a stop if passing by.
2021-09-05,5,My kids and I loved their gelatos. Coconut flavor is to die for. I would have the entire bucket! Their safe Covid-19 protocols for customer transactions are a big plus. Always appreciate that these days.
2021-08-31,5,I ordered on the Yelp app and the restaurant called me directly when they had sold out of the raspberry and chocolate sorbet flavors. I asked for banana instead and there was no worries. I thought I was having an allergic reaction at first so I called to confirm the banana was a sorbet. She kindly ensured me this creamy sorbet was dairy free. The banana flavor is delicious!!! Very kind place, will continue to support!
2021-08-30,5,The croissant donuts are amazing!  Likely the best I've ever had.  My favorite is the Nutella filled one.   The macaroons are also very tasty.  I'm definitely trying the ice cream next time.
2021-08-14,4,I came here for dessert and was captivated hy the crepe. I love crepe and I haven't had it in a while. It tasted good; I especially felt that the gelato was delicious (pistachio). But the cost was heftier than I had hoped.Their croissant donut was bomb. I will certainly come back for one of those as well as to try some of their other tasty looking desserts.
2021-07-04,5,One of the best gelato shops in Hoboken. I ordered the peach mango gelato. It was very refreshing and the flavors are superb. It was creamy and almost had the texture of a soft serve. There is an assortment of flavors, including other fruity flavors and chocolatey ones.
2021-06-27,5,Best Macarons and Tiramisu in the area. I am big fan of their Tiramisu especially. I have tried multiple places in the Hoboken area but they have the best flavor. It's a must try if you have sweet tooth.. They also have multiple flavors of mousse as well. I have tried 4-5 flavors and all of them are super delicious.
2021-06-23,3,The cronut is better than average, but the fillings aren't that great. I'd get get a plain cronut from here (don't recall if they have them).- Boston cream pie: nice chocolate topping and cronut, but the cream is flavorless- apple cinnamon: nice sugar coating and cronut, apple cinnamon flavor is decent.- jelly: nice frosting and cronut, jelly was okay.Coffee Gelato isn't gelato and lacks intensity, don't recommend. Wouldn't get again.Cupcakes weren't that great. Had the oreo cupcake and the strawberry cheesecake, neither were flavorful or rich. Wouldn't get again.
2021-06-08,5,Delicious late night treat! We were highly pleased with the flavor of our desserts. The salted caramel and cookies and cream gelato are perfectly creamy. The strawberry cheesecake had actual chunks of berry in the glaze on top.  Everything is flavorful and hit the spot on a muggy June evening. We will be revisiting this location for more sweet treats.
2021-05-30,5,They don't have the rolled ice cream anymore due to covid, but their crepes are amazing! Just enough ice cream and fruit for a sweet dessert. The place is very small, as per Hoboken Washington st standards.
2021-05-16,5,Ordered delivery and was not disappointed!! My fav color is teal and you bet yo ass I bought the blue velvet cupcake!!! I also got the brownie cupcake . Also very good!!
2021-05-09,2,This place is okay. Not good and not terrible. A little bit more expensive than I thought. Location is good. It is Hoboken main street. Easy to find.
2021-05-09,5,1st off can I just say WOW!!!! These were AMAZING!!! Secondly, I've read A LOT of reviews of how terribly hard these are but instructions clearly state to let thaw for at least 15 mins BEFORE consuming! In any case, they were delicious thawed & cold. The. BEST.  MACARONS. I've ever had!!! I ordered from uber eats so I can't speak for the store front but I will definitely be ordering from them again!
2021-03-12,1,If I could I'd give it 0 stars . I guess they changed owners because I went there before COVID and the macaroon I had with my gelato was amazing. HOWEVER, the 6 macaroons I bought for OVER 3 dollars each I might add were OLD and hard as a rock. If I had to guess it was ATLEAST 4 days old. DO NOT COME HERE.
2021-02-20,1,So disappointed :( worst macarons I've ever had. Tastes like they're 2 days old and super hard to chew. I expected way better quality when they charge 2.95 per cookie!!
2021-01-22,5,Firstly I like the set up they had to ensure social distancing. It's a little hole in the wall spot that you'd never think to try. I was craving a macaroon & some how came home with much more. The passion fruit macaroon was so fresh; best I've ever had. The croissant donuts are PHENOMENAL. If you are a Nutella fan, you need to try the Nutella donut!
2020-12-12,5,This place is amazing their Cronuts are unbelieve best in the country/that i have ever had
2020-11-30,5,Yummy !!!! I'm on a no sugar diet but whenever I feel like cheating it's only Juns for me ! The Nutella filled croissant donut and the slice cakes are heavenly!!!
2020-10-27,3,I might over overhyped this place in my head because of the combination of a macaron in gelato sounded amazing, but I thought the dessert was average, but i would give this place 3.5/5!I initially wanted to get the macaron gelato sandwich but there were only a few left, maybe because we went on a weekday night at 8pm so the supply was running low by the end of the day? not sure.anyways there is a big selection of macarons and gelato which was really nice, lots of unique flavors, lots of sweet and fruity flavors and other fun options.it's a bit pricey, but they do give you a lot of gelato packed in.I tried a new flavor that I normally would that I had heard was popular, so I'm thinking that played a role, so will give this place another try in the future!
2020-09-29,5,If plump, delicious macarons are your thing, look no further!! Slightly expensive than usual, but totally worth it. Tried their pistachio, orange blossom, rose lychee, chocolate and cookies&cream, extremely good flavors and satisfying size. Will definitely go back for more and highly recommend.
2020-09-19,3,Had a late night dessert craving and this seemed like the only dessert place delivering at the time. I ordered the New York blackout cake and a New York cheesecake. I personally wanted the blackout cake to be a bit more moist and a little less sweet. The cheesecake was way too sweet for my liking and I didn't even finish it later. Overall, disappointed with the cakes as I was hoping for better quality and taste after reading the reviews.
2020-07-31,5,Very tasty gelato and crepes. Highly recommend the Tiramisu, Hazelnut and coffee gelato!! Their strawberry- blueberry crepe with nutella was yum!!
2020-07-11,4,My friend and I had finished dinner and were craving frozen yogurt or something similar. I consulted the Bible, aka Yelp! This place was highly rated and open late which we appreciated. We pulled up and double parked illegally. First I went to check it out. look at flavors. Then my my friend ordered. It seemed the norm here on this street to hang out. People waited in line to see the menu and to order and were respectful of distance. Service seemed quick. I got the banana and the coconut in a cup. It was a very generous portion. I liked the coconut a lot. It had pieces of coconut in it. I would get it again. The banana was ok.
2020-07-10,5,Ordered the 3 assortments of croissant donuts and they are like nothing I've ever had. They're delicious and light and pair perfectly with my coffee. I ordered them through Uber eats, specifically asked for vanilla, glazed, and chocolate. They were out of chocolate and if my phone was not on do not disturb I would of been able to answer their missed call. They were trying to find out what I wanted to replace the chocolate with! Very great service and highly recommend!
2020-07-01,1,I love macaroons, however this is the third time when we're buying macaroons here and all the time it's hard and stale. Seems like it's were laying there forever and then they sell it to customers. I'm very disappointed and never come back there again
2020-06-29,3,I ordered strawberry milk snow but it was kind of disappointing. I go to palisades park or NYC enough times where I know what bingsu is supposed to taste like. It wasn't that silky texture I am looking for from milk bingsu. It was a little icy to me. I wish they had at least some amount of red bean inside of the strawberry bingsu. if you go to ktown cafes, they usually put some red bean to balance out the bingsu flavor but this was literally just strawberry strawberry syrup, ice cream, and condensed milk. And their gelato is also not the best. I would rather buy a fancy tub of gelato ice cream or go somewhere else.
2020-06-11,4,Great dessert spot. They have a variety of flavors for both gelato and macaroon. I recommend getting a gelato with a macaroon.
2020-06-11,5,Have only been here twice but love their tiramisu gelato. I got the dark chocolate macaron with it and it was delicious too. You could tell that the gelato was really good quality. My boyfriend got the dark chocolate hazelnut gelato and liked it too
2020-06-08,5,Omg... the donut croissant was DELICIOUS!!! I got the plain, vanilla and Nutella and it was amazing!! The coconut gelato was also so good! It wasn't too sweet and it had little chucks of coconut! Oh man!
2020-05-16,5,Found Jun's on UberEats...WOW!! Ordered 3 cronuts (raspberry, boston creme & nutella). They sell 3 for $10 and we were happily surprised by how big they are. We also ordered soft serve vanilla ice cream with toppings as well as 2 types of chocolate cake. Everything was really really good! If you get a sweet tooth this is the place to order from.
2020-02-22,5,Excellent macarons and cronuts! Several different flavors and options to choose from. Haven't tried the gelato yet, but waiting for the weather to warm up! Hidden gem in Hoboken! You won't be disappointed!
2020-02-03,4,I ordered dessert delivery from here and was very impressed! Order came a little early which I was fine with. We got three doughsants: Boston Creme, Apple Cinnamon, and Raspberry. We cut it all up so that we could try a little of each. Boston Creme was my favorite, apple cinnamon least, but all were good. If I had a full one for myself, it would've been overwhelming.The pastry part was done well. Crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. There was a sugar glaze on the outside for two, and chocolate icing on the boston creme. The fillings were very generous! Apple cinnamon tasted like apple pie - fresh and tart with a sweet cinnamon. Raspberry also tasted super fresh. Boston Creme was fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness.
2020-01-15,5,The rolled ice cream and cheesecake are PHENOMENAL.UPDATE: those cronuts are absolutely delicious. Don't even stop making them.
2020-01-12,5,Most delicious croissant donuts. Not our first time ordering. In particular, we love the nutella and Boston creme filled ones and recommend.
2019-12-27,5,Sean is a solid server,Love the gelato and macarons this place is always keeping up their quality.
2019-11-22,5,Five stars for the Croissant Donuts! We got a Nutella cronut and Apple Cronut. DELICIOUS!We tried the gelato a while back and didn't like it. We also ordered a cupcake today and we didn't like that either. It's not fresh and Sweet is sooooo much better for cupcakes.Anyway, if you go here, my boyfriend and I highly recommend the Cronuts!! Especially Nutella if you like Nutella. It has nuts on top. Warm them up and indulge! Soft and fresh. They're advertised as homemade. They smell amazing! They have plain, vanilla frosted, chocolate frosted, Boston cream, apple, raspberry, and Nutella. YummmmmWe tried the chocolate frosted the following day and the raspberry, and wow! 10/10 for everything about these  croissant donuts!!! We met Grace, Jun is her husband. Amazing woman! Great customer service too. BEST DONUTS IN HOBOKEN!!!****
2019-10-27,5,WowLove this place it was fresh, good customerservice  and nice little tables to sit on.
2019-10-17,5,We decided to go here because I was craving desserts but didn't want to walk too far from where we were. The place is small. The seating is not that clean. But the gelato was so good. I had a small toasted marshmallow. I wish they allowed 2 flavors for the small as the size is enough to get full. I also ordered the macaroon with gelato which had hazelnut gelato. It was worth it for me since I love both. I highly recommend coming here if you are in the area.
2019-09-26,5,I walk by this place a lot but have not had a chance to try it.  Tonight I tried it when I had a major craving for chocolate.I looked at their menu on seamless.  They have a wide variety of cakes, gelato flavors, and pastries.  They also have the new donut croissants.  Also a variety of coffee drinks and milkshakes.I went for the peanut butter cake.  They do charge a high fee for small deliveries.  That's the downside.  There's a delivery fee too.  So it is a little more expensive than ordering in.I was not disappointed with the delivery.  They were five minutes early which was fantastic.  The cake itself was rich and decadent, and also not too much.Overall they get 4.7 stars.  Taking off a few points for the delivery fees.  But I would love to stop by and try something else on the menu.
2019-08-15,5,We found this place on our way back from dinner and I must say, it was one of the best quality gelato ice creams I've had till now. I tried the dark chocolate Hazelnut which had tiny crumbles of toasted hazelnuts in just the right amount. Definitely recommend this place to anyone craving some delicious ice cream.
2019-08-13,4,Whoa! What a great find! Love a gelato that tastes fresh and has tamed amounts of sugar. Also nothing like ordering in cold dessert that gets delivered ASAP and intact. At 10pm if I might add. So much for that solid core class. Here's to a balance in self- love woop! In conclusion... I love gelato. But I particularly love Jun's gelato.
2019-08-04,5,Great gelato and the pistachio macaron is phenomenal! It was very creamy and fresh. I was very pleasantly surprised.
2019-08-03,5,I found this place on Yelp and let me say it is so so so good.I love the flavors. These icecream taste fresh as if they make them. The mango and passionfruit taste like the actual fruit. I also tried the bingsoo and that was also good, just that I wish they had taro and green tea bingsoo with cheese. Everything I tried was delicious.
2019-06-22,4,First time to this area came here because it was near a store I was shopping in so I had to come and try the gelato Nutella And banana crepe with a scoop of Oreo cookie gelato ice cream. This made my day and my taste buds excited lol.
2019-06-18,5,Delicious gelato, crepe, and macarons! Definitely worth trying if you're in the area. The owners were super friendly and maintained the store really well.
2019-06-10,2,Was waiting on our train at the station and decided to check this place out since it was only a 10 minute walk and we had time to kill. Unfortunately they were not open like their hours said they should be so it was a waste of time.
2019-06-09,1,I don't know about their products but the owner(s) of this establishment are doing their business in a bad way. I walked past this shop and I saw familiar photo that I know it was ice cream roll photo from the shop in Manhattan (Because I am following that shop's Instagram) So, I checked on that shop's Instagram and Bingo!! The photo I saw on this shop's board is NOT this shop's product!! This shop stole other ice cream shop's photo to show it as theirs! That means they are doing false advertising!! They are lying to customers. I did notify this issue to the shop in Manhattan. I don't know if the owner of the shop will contact this shop, but I really hope they did and I hope they sue this shop!Such a bad business move. I really don't like to support any shop that doesn't respect others!Btw, I recognize only 1 photo but I believe that other photos on the board are not their products neither.
2019-05-12,5,Amazing! Scrumptious! I've only ever gotten delivery from here but the gelato is just so delicious. Beyond that we have the lovely option of a bingsoo which is also heavenly. I intend to keep getting dessert from here--it is quite worth it :)
2019-04-24,5,Delicious came here with my son on a hot spring day. Macarons looked delicious will definitely return. Purchased a vanilla and chocolate ice cream even added sprinkles to the ice cream for my son.
2019-04-19,5,Delicious gelato served by a very nice gentleman. Probably owner. Thank you and see you soon!
2019-03-10,2,I don't get what the hype is about this place and why it has great reviews. I went here for the first time over two years ago soon after they opened. I ordered gelato and the taste was just... watery. I love ice cream and rarely turn it down but this stuff just didn't taste like ice cream should - creamy, sugary and full of joy. I ended up throwing the last half away because it wasn't enjoyable. Two years later, I saw the reviews pile up and decided to go back and try their rolled ice cream. Again, very disappointed and it tasted watery and bland. One of the toppings I got was marshmallows and they were stale and crunchy :/ This is the last place I would go to for ice cream in Hoboken, I would 100% choose a McDonald's McFlurrys rather than go back here.The positives: A lot of variety on the menu - gelato, rolled ice cream, macaroons, milkshakes, frappes, smoothies, milk snow, coffee, iced coffee and tea; free toppings with rolled ice cream; and the shop is cute and clean.
2019-02-24,5,Creme Brûlée, Gelato, slide of cheesecake. Some of the best Brûlée I have even had. Wish I had gotten two. Also the gelato was beautifully smooth and tasty and a packed container for the price. Just moved here yesterday and can't wait to try in person. Tim
2019-02-16,5,Closest place to carry my fav macrons  I really like how they are open until late too. Very organized place with great selections of macrons. Their gelato is pretty good too.
2019-01-27,4,Stumbled upon this place while looking for dessert in Hoboken. Didn't know they offer crepes here so I had to try one. The ice cream was really good, I had the tiramisu and the coffee. Both were extremely rich, and I was so excited to try it with the crepe. The presentation of the crepe was really good, the holder had a nice design. The actual crepe itself was okay, not the biggest fan and the mix with the banana and Nutella were standard. I've had other places that looked a lot more embellished so maybe I was comparing but overall it was a solid dessert crepe. The ice cream was really good, I'm sure their other offerings are worth it. The ambiance could be updated, or more inviting since it's a bit cramped. Other then that def worth a try!
2019-01-18,5,BEST DESSERT IN HOBOKEN! Hands down this place is the best!!! They have fantastic gelato, crepes, and macarons! A great selection of everything your sweet tooth could crave with awesome quality and a kind staff. This is one of the only places I go for dessert in Hoboken and I am never disappointed. Do not miss!!!!
2019-01-12,5,Ugh, what a cute little dessert shop  they open late which is a plus. The only downside to this place is the scarcity of available parking spots, tight & narrow side streets , & pothole infested roadways but it IS in the middle of the nightlife in Hoboken so the owner picked a great spot for business. The sitting space was limited, but everything was cleanly & well maintained. The owner made suggestions & answered all of our questions. There are a variety of options here. The gelato is homemade & is vegan friendly! There are also some gluten-free options FYI if that's what floats your boat. What's interesting is that they also offer Bulgogi and a few other Korean-style dishes. Next time I wanted dessert near Hoboken, this is the spot to be. I've taken some pictures of the available flavors of macaroons, but please be advised if you opt for the GELATO MACAROON SANDWICH- yep, that's what I said- they only have it in hazelnut, Oreo, chocolate, and pistachio. ($3.50 per) Oh yeah, did I mention they have crepes too?
2018-11-10,5,I spent a week in Italy last week and walking around Hoboken today, I discovered that we have as good artisanal gelato as any I tried in Rome! I had a taste of the pistachio and had to take a pint home. Jun's is squisito!
2018-11-05,4,Solid ice cream shop. Came by when my friends and I were looking for rolled icecream and we were immediately impressed with all of the different ice cream varieties they offer. The gelato and crepes looked awesome, but we stuck with the rolled ice cream we were looking for. There were so many different flavors that we weren't sure what to pick, but were happy with the caramel cashew crunch. It's so fresh that they literally mix the milk and other ingredients in front of you. It was quick, tasty, and you even get 3 free toppings. Definitely worth checking this place out!
2018-06-22,2,We were here today and we bought a waffle cone with icecream. The waffle cone was so old that the paper cover on it wouldn't tear off. When we pointed this out we were told that's how the company gives to us we don't manufacture it here. I would think as a responsible owner someone would either say sorry and we will raise a complaint with the waffle company or some such.A rude pointless statement would only make you loose customers.I gave them a two cause the dark hazelnut icecream did taste good!
2018-04-17,4,If you haven't been here yet, you have to check it out immediately! This is the most amazing ice cream place in Hoboken. The flavors are strong and so delicious. The rolled gelato is so beautiful and tastes amazing. Prices for gelato are very reasonable, although I thought the macrons were pretty pricy. My friend got a matcha green tea macron and I tried a piece. The filling was not very good in my opinion, but I think the main attraction anyway is the gelato and ice cream which I can't wait to have again! BEWARE- milk snow cone is not for one person! It is big! Service was also good and quick. I will be back for more soon!
2018-03-24,5,The ice cream here is amazing! This place was the closest to real Gelato in Italy I've had in the US so far. Absolutely loved the pistachio and chocolate flavors.
2018-02-18,4,I tried the mango flavored snow milk item on their menu. It was pricey but well worth it. I usually take my time eating frozen dessert just so i dont suffer brain freeze. Unlike shaved ice, this yummy dessert melts at a slow rate. Its wasnt soupy and you can taste the fresh quality mangos and  the fresh strawberry in the gelato. I give it a 2 thumbs up!
2018-02-09,5,Best macarons I had so far and they were very quick to deliver it, especially the coconut and creme brule flavored one was over the top.
2017-12-15,5,I came here during thanksgiving break and first I tried 2 macaron and it was AMAZING and i got 2 boxes more Togo one for me and the other one was for Antonio back home and it was good and he loved it and I would go back
2017-08-23,2,I've never tried the roll up ice cream.. I was eager to try it. Coffee is my favorite flavor so I asked for the coffee crunch. I found out the crunch was hazelnuts and asked if we can switch it out for Oreos or something since I don't like nuts  and the woman said no, sorry, it's pre-made already. Along with more than half the roll up menu (had nuts in it) Which was a bummer.. because I wasn't a fan of the flavors that didn't have nuts in them. I thought ice cream shops are supposed to be fun, and playful and creative where you can change things and cater to your guests?.. Not here! I even asked if I can have an extra roll up and I'll pay more for it. The owner said flat out, no, I would have to buy 2 orders.I ended up just getting the coffee gelato, which was weighed on a scale... Yummy, but nothing to rave about.
2017-08-22,2,Friendly staff, expect nothing good other than that. Amount of sweet is unbearable. I cant eat at least half of gelato. Worst selection of toppings, I was able to choose only two toppings, even tough I got three options. Very expensive, I paid 8$ for serving, that's only size available
2017-07-08,3,Personally for me, I've had better gelato for a better price. I ordered a a gelato and 2 macarons and it cost me almost $13. Definitely not worth it for the price. The macarons were very sweet and honestly I've just had better. The gelato was average at best. They do sell a plethora of desserts there as well as beverages so you do have other options. However there are too many great places for me to come back here twice.
2017-06-18,1,Rude, money hungry, and just outright disrespectful. More concern with you paying first than fulfilling your ice cream desires.
2017-04-22,5,Get the rolled ice cream. Surprisingly delicious and fun to watch them make in front of you.
2017-03-06,3,My husband loved frozen berries gelato but when I tried it, I felt it was more water based and lacks quality. If you want to try amazing gelato go to Bucket and Bay Craft in grove street. Pistachio macaroon was good but this place is lil over priced.Also, $5 minimum otherwise you need to pay by cash.
2017-03-05,5,Love this place ! Amazing ice cream! The staff is so nice! The ice cream rolls are so good! And made right in front of you! Def going there more often!
2016-10-30,5,I went here around 9:30 the other night, and wow is this gelato tasty.  The chocolate gelato is on point with gelato you would get elsewhere in new york!  I would highly suggest trying out gelato here!
2016-09-10,3,One of the very few places to get gelato nearby. They have pretty good flavors and the place is clean. However they are expensive. Additionally they don't allow two flavors in their small size, meaning if you want variety you have to up sell to the medium, which is again, expensive. But again, the gelato is good so it's worth giving the place a shot.
2016-09-05,2,Visited this place for the first time last night. The two Asian guys working there definitely lack some customer service skills, didn't feel welcome at all. Second, macaroons are the same price as macaroons at Laduree and you can't even taste what you're eating. How is that possible!? Gelato in my opinion too pricey.
2016-08-26,5,The macarons and gelato were great! Definitely going to come back again. Adds some nice variety to the area!
2016-08-19,5,Place is small and comfortable but who cares about the decor, they're macaroons and gelatos are fantastic and that's all that counts. If you have a sweet tooth, this will cure your cravings
2016-08-13,5,I stumbled upon this gelato spot after having lunch in Hoboken.  I have to say that this was one of the best gelatos I've tasted since my trip to Italy. It's easy to miss so be sure to check it out- a nice way to cool down on a hot day like today!!
2016-08-04,1,Not only a 5$ shake made with 60% milk 30% water and 10% half decent vanilla gelato and horrible lemon gelato but additionally horrible service. Go across the street to Ben and Jerrys.
2016-08-04,4,Wait what.... Gelato AND macaron?! I was intrigued by the concept so I had to stop by, but they don't execute it very well. You basically have to buy each thing separately then ask them to put it on top. Ehhh not as exciting as I thought but whatever. It's about $7 for a small gelato & macaron. The gelato here is PRETTY amazing. The macarons... Not so much. They were way too sweet. I tried the pistachio one but I'm not sure I would get the macaron again.The gelato, however... I had the toasted almond and hazelnut flavors and I LOVED them. Between Rita's and this place, you can't go wrong with ice cream in Hoboken.Since this place is new, I can see why they don't have too many customers yet. I think they can really step up their marketing and offer better deals for having the macaron + gelato. Overall, I would recommend this place for solid gelato, and highly instagrammable gelato + macaron. 3.5 stars.
2016-07-21,5,Just stumbled across this little gem after work today and I'm so glad I did!! It's such a cute little place! And the gelato & macarons are deeelliisshh!! If you're a huge almond and coconut  fan like me, definitely order the toasted almond gelato & coconut macaron !!
2016-07-14,5,Excellent gelato and macarons just opened on Washington St!  I don't even think they have a website yet - but it's worth getting down there for some delicousness!!
