2021-08-20,5,Pier A Park is one of most beautiful parks with amazing views of Manhattan skyline by Hudson River. The ambiance is really cozy & relaxing and it is definitely one of the best spots in Hoboken. There is a huge & well-maintained open grass field in the middle of the park and it's perfect for picnic & gathering, especially during the pandemic. We enjoyed our time hanging there and will visit again if we are in the neighborhood.
2021-05-22,5,Beautiful large park with lots of benches, lots of grass for picnicing or boss tossing. Great views of New York City and a nice area to just stroll around and enjoy the nature/breeze after walking down the streets of Hoboken.It's very close to the Hoboken train station. If you are in town, it's worth a quick (or not so quick) stroll around to enjoy the calmness that comes with the nature.
2020-09-11,5,Large park with a phenomenal view of the NY skyline! People are surprisingly very good at adhering to the social distancing guidelines. Super calm. Super beautiful. Just beware it does get very chilly by the water!
2020-08-19,5,Pier A Park is the first park right when you get off the PATH to Hoboken. It's right on the waterfront and has a beautiful water fountain and path around it. It's a decent size piece of greenery for lounging, sunbathing, you name it. The pier is pretty large and also goes out in the water decently far and offers that classic NYC skyline view. Even in the middle of the current pandemic, I feel that this place is large enough for you to get out and walk around or even just hang out while still maintaining a good amount of distance from you and everyone else. With plenty of open space and benches to go around, it's a must visit for anyone in the city who needs to get out and stretch their legs and get some fresh air.
2020-07-17,4,If you feel I veer too much toward Covid-19 sociology, now may be the time to click the back button.Sunbathers and sociologists may find value in Pier A Park. Have you heard the story of the city that established one of the nation's first coronavirus-related curfews - partly because of a bar fight (?!) - and just months later became a hot spot of Lake Of The Ozarks-esque merriment? These maskless revelers aren't doing a political "Muh Freedoms" thing here, it's strictly about avoiding tan lines on your face.In other words, Covid Conservatives will want to be careful if it's above 65 degrees and partly cloudy or better, though I don't consider the walkway itself scary. If you dare, you'll find superb views of the Empire State Building and Hudson Yards, and if you have an expensive camera you may get a glimpse of the George Washington Bridge.
2020-05-17,5,a beautiful, spacious, clean park with great views. Perfect for lounging around, reading a book, sunbathing, strolling/running, picnics, etc. the park is peaceful and offers a fantastic view of the ny skyline across the river. Plenty of restaurants, bars, coffee shops in the surrounding areas as well.
2020-04-19,5,The Pier is a perfect place to lounge out on a nice day. It has a big grass area with a walkway around it.  I have made this part of my running route for years now and I love it. The view is second to none and will never disappoint.  The pier goes pretty far out into the water too so you are pretty close to NYC with an unobstructed view. So nice!Years ago they had a concert here so not sure why they don't do that anymore. It was a pretty fun time too. They do have movie nights in the summer on Wednesdays I believe.  It does get crowded in the summer so come get a spot but usually you will be fine and have your space.  They also have a 9/11 memorial here for all the people from Hoboken that we lost in the tragedy. It is a really nice tribute to them. Pier A is one of those places that is unique to Hoboken and makes the city what it is! Come check it out!
2020-03-09,4,TL-DR: One of Hoboken's local retreats, offers a place to do your morning run, hang out with friends, do community events, fish, and not only enjoy Manhattan's skyline, but have fantastic pictures too! Stop on by if you're in the area, and spend some time if you're waiting for your next NJ Transit train/bus, ferry, or PATH train.A very overdue review on Yelp, but I think I'll stick around a while longer to contribute much more after a long break of absence! Hoboken's Pier A Park is one of the city's many parks, and one of several lining the Hudson Riverfront. It's fairly easy to get to, especially within the "Mile Square City". It's a short distance away from Hoboken Terminal and the ferry port / PATH station, off the bike path lining the river, and a short distance away from the downtown area. The whole park is slightly larger than one of Hoboken's city blocks, so there's definitely space for everyone. Being close to some of Hoboken's transit hubs, you won't run out of options on how to get here: several NJ Transit train routes, PATH's JSQ-HOB / HOB-33rd / HOB-WTC lines , several ferries going to/from NYC, local NJTransit buses, even a local Hudson Bike Share rental stop. Outside, the park offers a spacious, sprawling green field in the middle, surrounded by foot paths, with a gazebo in the east edge of the river. There's trees that in late spring/summer provide relief and shade for hot days. Since hours aren't listed, it's presumed this park is open 24/7 and public, but do exercise caution if you're going to be out late in the evening as always.Pier A Park, in my opinion, is maybe Hoboken's 2nd most important park in the city, with Sinatra Park a bit too the north being the best. Whereas that park has a soccer field, a restaurant, and an amphitheater, Pier A has almost the minimum to be considered a good park, and fortunately it's good enough for locals and tourists/visitors alike. A good place to do runs, family & friends hang out, a place to do photography or see NYC's skyline, fish, the works. Even in the summer and weather improves, you'll get more people outside, and possibly events too. I'm not certain if you can even bike here, but in my opinion I don't really see many bikers inside the park itself, since most of them use the dedicated bike path outside of the park. During winter/spring, you'll see a lot of waterfowl such as geese, seagulls, ducks that would be around the park premises and grazing on the field. It's not rare to see their... leavings, on the grass, so do keep in mind where you step on!For me personally, I do find myself going to Pier A plenty of times when I'm in Hoboken, rather than going with Sinatra Park a bit north. Sure, I would want more in this park, but at the same time, less is best. It's a place where I can snap good photos (& even better with a dedicated camera), relax, get to mingle with locals sometimes, and bide time waiting for late NJ Transit trains or PATH trains. Winters here can get grueling cold, summers sometimes scorching hot, not the place you'd want to be when it's raining a lot (the gazebo doesn't help sometimes). And as what most people are aware of, if you want a good view of Manhattan, you'll have to do it from Hoboken or Jersey City.In conclusion, Pier A Park fits in with the typical city park vibe, but offers a comfortable spacious environment to relax, and have fun close to the Hudson River. Sure, added features would help out, but stick with what has been great for the past few years.Hope to come back soon!
2020-02-23,5,Beautiful. Absolutely stunning, especially at night. I proposed here before ever having been to the park, and did not regret it.
2019-10-15,5,This is a relaxing and clean park to get a great skyline view from downtown Hoboken. If you're hanging out in downtown, you must stop here
2019-06-26,5,The best thing about this park is the cool fountain with benches set up around it.   In the sweltering heat of summer the area around this fountain is nice and cool.
2018-11-21,5,Aside from it being FREEZING cold this was a super fun park.Nice huge open grass spaces, pleasant walking paths.Beautiful trees, and plenty of benches.There is a gondola at the end of the park and several guys were there fishing off the bank.We got some great shots of the tress as they were changing colors too.This park also has some amazing views of New York and when the sky is blue with white fluffy clouds everything just looks like it's going to be alright.This is a bit of a wind tunnel during the day and it was quite cold.But really a great spot to run, exercise, walk, layout, relax, and enjoy the scenery.
2018-07-04,5,Beautiful park, with a beautiful view. Enjoy the skyline, river and scenery. Many people running or just laying out. Can easily catch the ferry from here, terminals is just steps away!
2018-07-03,5,I love boardwalks and Pier walkways. I love to be able to walk for miles with my kids with the bay or ocean breeze hitting us on a nice sunny day. There are many that I've walked or frequented over the years.Moving back north last year, this one is very special. I was born in Hoboken, and much of this was not here when I was a kid. But now its a beautiful and sprawling walkway. I love it. With numerous park separations and excellent access to all kinds of food nearby along with random street vendors, this is a perfect spot with one of the greatest city views to sit and have a nice picnic or lunch rendezvous. It is very well maintained but there is still a hint of vagrancy that cops are usually on top of but you still have pockets of aggressive vagrants who can disturb the peace. But that is rare these days. The only issues, really, in my opinion, stem from construction on barges or the upcoming construction that will be ongoing in the area which will kill the ambiance with noise pollution along with other diesel smells. Locals are usually good about their pets not leaving behind little "presents" but you do need to be careful around the edges of the walkways that some lesser responsible locals do end up leaving behind their pet waste. Overall, it is a beautiful park attaching to the larger pier walkway, a place I recommend everyone come and see for themselves.
2018-05-01,5,Pier A Park is a park in Hoboken. It has great views of Manhattan. This is one of the parks along the Hudson River. It makes for a good stroll along. There are lots of good places to sit. It's easy to see Manhattan from here. In Hoboken there are a few parks along the river. This one is closest to Hoboken Terminal. It also has lots of green space, which is hard to find in this area. The majority of the parks seem to be huddled along the river. If you're in Hoboken you should walk along the river. It's easy to get to shops from here. There's many places to run or just sit.
2017-11-05,4,Views for days! I stopped by here while in Hoboken, New Jersey because Pier A Park has one of the best views of the NYC skyline!  The convenience of Hoboken is that it's just across the Hudson River from New York, making it a prime location for the epic views of the Big City.  I visited on a weekday morning, so the park had only a few visitors.  There is a gazebo here, where most of the people congregate, yet the park has plenty of open space.  It's also very conveniently located to the main business centre of Hoboken and public transportation.  It's also open 24 hours, so do visit at night, just to see the city lights.  Overall, this is a nice park in Hoboken with a view worth checking out.
2017-10-21,5,Came to their Harvest Festival. Completely family oriented. Parking isn't that great; yet, Hoboken's parking isn't ever great. We did find parking within 15 mins of looking. Not sure how long they've been doing this but know that my experience here was great! Can't go to the farm? They brought the farm to you. They had free pumpkin picking, free petting zoo, free arts and crafts, free pony rides and a few other things to do. We didn't get to do the horse hayride, inflatable bounce, sand art and train ride. The lines in each area moved rather quickly. All workers were polite and helpful. Safety was good as they had police officers on site and workers were very precautious. Such a great way to bring a positive atmosphere to town and it's people. Every town should do this!
2017-04-27,5,My favorite place. The second I reach the grass (which is the best grass I've ever felt) I feel relaxed and happy. The view is amazing the atmosphere is like none other. I miss it terribly.
2016-10-03,4,Movies Under the Stars is a great option for exploring this park, though it's definitely not open 24 hrs like the listing here implies.
2016-08-09,4,The best place for laying out on a hot day or watching movies outside on the big blow up screen they have on Wednesday's in the summer. The views are amazing; I've been a resident of the town for 8 years and they are still and always will be mind blowing. If you are just visiting Hoboken head all the way out to the edge for pictures your friends will be jealous of. One thing I wish they had were fountains or a sprinkler system or SOMETHING. It gets SO HOT out there in the summer and while I love it there is no place to cool down except to just leave.
2016-08-09,5,Frequently at pier a since i was a little girl and its one of the best places to relax and fish on a hot summer day. Just wish that the bathrooms werent so far away at the terminal.
2016-07-14,5,Summer concerts in the park! Fitness in the park! Movies in the park! Yoga in the park! It's all happening right now....almost every week and it's so much fun! Get your summer on! The best part of Pier A park is that it's right outside the Hoboken terminal.....so you can just walk out and get a few minutes of complete bliss.  Sit on a bench and watch the world go by or bring a blanket and have your own picnic gazing at the NYC skyline. Either way, it's a win-win!
2016-07-10,5,Morning, Noon or Night, any day or anytime of the year ! This is one place where you will never get bored. Rain or shine the park gives you the most exquisite views of the Manhattan skyline rising over the Hudson River.Do as much photography you want or just enjoy the riverfront, the park offers something for everyone. There are numerous restaurants at Washington Street to enjoy food and then you can take a nice walk at this park.Tip: Be prepared there are no public restrooms at at the park / riverfront. If you are visiting NY, definitely plan a half day visit to Hoboken. The place is well connected to NY. Hoboken Terminal is right at the corner of the park
2016-06-26,3,These parks along the Hudson, sadly, have not lived up to their potential. Sitting here on a Sunday with kiosks closed for business, I wonder why there are no concessions or bathrooms. The boathouse is always closed (for good?). The little beach area is dirty and closed.
2016-03-11,4,For those who Instagram their lives, this is probably the best spot in Hoboken to get your selfie on. Your backdrop is the panorama of Manhattan, and there's plenty of space for you to spread out, while still leaving enough room for walkers, runners, bikers, loiterers, etc. to do their thang.
2016-02-29,5,A very nice place to just relax for a bit. I've been here on busy sunny summer days as well as quiet winter days. Fall and spring are also nice to just wind down and relax. You can jog, bike, or skate if you like. Or just take in the nice scenery. Take pictures or videos if the mood is there. Very nice park.
2016-01-28,5,I've lived here for years and this place never gets old! It's a great place for running, exercise, lounging and picnics. During warmer months, Hoboken hosts "Movies Under the Stars" which is always fun. Pier A also is the starting point for 5K events and various food festivals. Oh, don't forget your camera when visiting, the NYC views are spectacular.
2015-11-04,5,We were having a few days in New York, and decided to pop over to Hoboken. When you come out of the station, on the way to Hoboken proper, you can't help but notice this lovely park.It has the best view of Manhattan, loads of benches, and just a really relaxed feeling, especially after the hustle & bustle of being in the city.I wouldn't come all the way to Hoboken just to go to a park, but if you're there anywhere, stop by, grab a seat, and enjoy the lovely view!
2015-11-04,5,Clean, spacious, best views, movie nights under the stars in the summer. Pier A can't be beat. Great place to relax.
2015-09-02,5,Yet another review of Pier A Park in Hoboken. As a 70 year old X-Staten Islander (now a North Bergener, NJ), Pier A brings with it a feeling of tranquility and convenience I used to experience on Staten Island. I travel everywhere now by NJ Transit Bus and jitneys. I catch the 85 at Kennedy Blvd and Summit Ave. It terminates at the Hoboken Terminal. How convenient is that? That area of Hoboken is full of stores, shops, Post Office, banks, lawyers, and quaintly arranged   streets that lend themselves to avid walkers like myself. So I do my banking and shopping, with a pleasant bench sit down at Pier A Park.This park is perfectly situated. If you walk all the way out to the tent style building, you have a view of lower Manhattan (Freedom Tower) and if you gaze up the Hudson River (on a clear day) you can see the George Washington Bridge. If you turn around facing the Atlantic Ocean you can see the Varizzano Bridge and my old stomping grounds, Staten Island. The park itself is almost an even split of a grassy (sun worshiper's paradise) area and a gray, totally tree covered area with benches and bicycle paths. One last thing. How many times have you ventured to Manhattan and other busy areas (like Hoboken) and tried to locate a bathroom? There is a well maintained men's room and I suspect the same for the ladies right in the terminal itself. If you can't find a restroom during your excursions through Hoboken, the terminal will always bail you out.If you're anywhere around the Hoboken Terminal, you must visit Pier A Park at least one time. I guarantee you will want to return.
2015-04-19,4,This park is one of the reasons I love living in downtown hoboken.  It's an expansive part that juts out into the Hudson river, giving you both great views of downtown and midtown manhattan.  There is a walking path and surrounds a grassy area where people love to congregate in the summer with towels and chairs to enjoy the nice weather with a view.  Day or night this is a beautiful place to take in the NYC skyline. There are a lot of restaurants and shops nearby and you can walk along the water from here almost to the other end of hoboken.  Whether you live here or are just visiting this is a great place to start your travels around hoboken.  Such a great city!
2015-01-30,5,grossed out by people who leave negative reviews of this park. do you not realize this park provides the best view of the greatest city in the world? everytime I go running I ALWAYS use this park as my personal track.. seeing the city is motivating, inspiring and breathtaking. a perfect romantic make out spot, place for a Sunday walk, people watching, sun bathing or snowman making. anyone who leaves negative reviews of this place has either a bad outlook on life or had an unfortunate experience which was not the parks fault!!
2014-10-02,4,Can't beat the view. Directly across from and overlooking NYC. Always clean, lots of grass to lay out in the sun, play frisbee, or just sit with lunch. I live in downtown Hoboken so this is my go-to park since it's a close distance to my apartment. During the summer they do movie nights on Wednesdays and set up a huge projection screen and play some good movies. This year the shower Life of Pi, Frozen, Lego Movie, Mrs. Doubtfire and more. (Definitely kid friendly). Overall it's a very nice park.
2014-07-18,5,Great pier:1) If you are a sucker for sleeping on the grass, this is your place. 2) They have movies under the stars nights called "Movies under the stars Hoboken". LOL3) The views are amazing. 4) It is free and open 24/7.
2014-04-07,5,I love Hoboken's Piers, it's really one of the best reasons to jump on a Path train and come over. Pier A is the largest and closest to the Hoboken station so why not start there. There is a bike path, plenty of benches, a playground, a large field, and a wonderful view of lower Manhattan. It's extremely clean and safe. They often hold events here like concerts and outdoor movies. One thing I wasn't a big fan of is that they have a sort of grove of trees with just gravel underneath and not the grass that I saw posted on a few of the photos on Yelp. Regardless it's hard to give this pier anything less than 5 stars.
2014-03-05,2,I've been here a couple of times ... but why?The first time I walked here was to take pictures of the supermoon ... but I got kinda weirded out because a group of guys were there & two of them started to fight? Like an actual fight. Yelling, arguing, "HOLD ME BACK!" and "CMON MAN!" and so on. I packed up my camera & left in a flash. Nahhh, I just wanted some nature & a view, Hoboken.The second time I walked over here was to take a picture of the big ol' shiny Roman numerals for Super Bowl XVIII. There was a huge police presence in front of the park, which already made it feel a little safer than last time. I cut through the non-grassy part, which was mostly occupied with wires & generator trucks (probably powering the lights?). Walking down to the numbers, I saw a small but loud group clustered around a tiny blow-up curling course. They were really enthusiastic about it with their brooms & everything, and it's the first time I've seen anyone do anything sporty at Pier A, so I'll let that slide. (Get it? Slide? See what I did there?)The XVIII was pretty cool. It was set up to overlook the Empire State Building, and the lights changed every few minutes or so to reflect the teams playing. About a dozen people were there too, taking pictures of the lights & climbing on the numbers. But other than that, Pier A was bare, slightly snow-covered, & dark.It's not comfortable, or lush, or anything "parky" really. I've never been motivated to come to Pier A to relax, or watch the animals (other than squirrels?), or look at flowers (I haven't seen any there). The grassy area is bumpy & sparse. And it's just a little sketch. Honestly, the best thing about this park is that it boasts a lovely view of the city, and for that it gets two stars.
2013-11-09,4,Thanks to my Yelp friend Evan M. who lives in Hoboken and gave me a little rundown on the places to visit, I took a half day during my NYC vacation about 1.5 months ago to visit Hoboken. The first stop was Pier A Park, where you can sit on the grass and watch the midtown Manhattan skyline. It was a nice little break from the hustle and bustle of NYC. It was only a 10-minute train ride for me from the 9th Street PATH station. Once you get to the Piers, the downtown area is within walking distance (only a couple short blocks away) and there are plenty of good restaurants to choose from. The famous Carlo's Bakery is on the Washington Street near the City Hall and is definitely worth a visit if you are into desserts. yelp.com/biz/carlos-bake...
2013-08-01,4,Bummed that I didn't know about free outdoor movies in Hoboken prior to this year. Oh well, better late than never! Thanks to one of the events posted on Yelp, I found out about the free outdoor movie screenings in Pier A Park. Google "Movies under the stars Hoboken" and you can get the schedule.The movies are aired on Wednesday nights at 9:00 pm in June and July and around at 8:15 pm in August. I believe the movies to be screened are decided via a survey on the website of City of Hoboken. They have a pretty good line up in 2013 - a number of award winning movies and animated ones too. On certain days, live entertainment is also scheduled before the movie starts screening.You are allowed to bring in food and beverages (non-alcoholic). There were a couple of porta-potties at the entrance to the park. For the best seats, you might wanna come in early.  I reached a bit early and managed to grab a spot close to the screen, the park got pretty crowded later on. Bring picnic blankets or chairs for watching the movie comfortably. And extra blankets or jackets if it's windy or a little chilly.There were a bunch of speakers around the park, so the audio was pretty good. As for the video, the screen is a inflatable thingy so the picture is not the greatest quality. A number of times during the screening, the screen was about to collapse in the wind, but the volunteers did a great job running quickly to the screen and supporting it.Watching the movie under the stars and the backdrop of NYC made for such a lovely setting! I am definitely going to watch out for next year's line-up. There are 3 more movie screenings in 2013, I already know that I am gonna be back to watch at least one of them.
2013-07-28,2,Writing this review strictly regarding the 2 concerts I've gone to at this park.  First Mumford last summer and MMJ, Wilco and Bob Dylan this past weekend.  Bad experiences both times and it's entirely due to poor planning and logistics.1 star for great acts/music they've booked.1 star for incredible setting/view up against the city.That's it!Here are the gripes with the venue.   Issues we had last summer for Mumford were chalked up to first time and inevitable hiccups that surely would be fixed the next time we wanted to see a show here.  Alas, that wasn't the case.  Same issues happened this time around and they are:1.  Beer lines WAY too long.  Is this some way to regulate how much people drink?  Make them wait in hour-long lines so they'll never want to go back and sit on it again?  Well success!   2.  Same goes for food.  I showed up hungry and left hungry mainly because we had to choose between beer line and food line...and gotta have beer!  so, left hungry.3.  Once the sun goes down, they have these horrible spotlights trained on the crowd so that you are blinded once you try and turn your head to find your friends who have been gone seemingly for hours to get an elusive lobster roll and maybe a beer to wash it down.  2 years in a row our group lost each other and left separately because it was impossible to find anyone in the oddly dark and at the same time blindingly bright location.Get it together Hoboken!
2013-07-08,5,I'm a sucker for grass.  I'm a sucker for views of the manhattan skyline.  I'm a sucker for convenience.  I'm a sucker for sitting by a river.  I'm a sucker for watching athletic young men chase each other around with balls and frisbees.  Pier A Park has all of the above, and is awesome.
2012-12-04,4,A visit to Pier A Park wasn't a planned stop, but after parking along Sinatra Drive with some time to kill, I thought, "Why not?" Jutting out into the Hudson River near the Hoboken train station, the park is simple, yet serene. I walked around the entire perimeter, taking everything in...joggers hustling along the brick walkway, fishermen casting lines off the pier, guys playing a game of touch football on the grass field, a couple staring across the river into NYC. Although it was hard to see anything at a distance on such a foggy morning, I enjoyed the short, relaxing stroll along the edge of the city.
2012-10-13,5,Love it here. I'm a real sucker for parks, but this one is amazing. They have music festivals, concerts, etc, and the like here on some weekday nights. You can find out what's coming up with a quick Google search. The park really makes for an amazing venue. Why?- Gorgeous views of the city from across the water- Well kept- Plenty of room, large open grass area so you can grab a towel and just lay down all day longLove coming here. Have been here a million times, will be here a million more. If you're coming to chill on the grass with friends, excellent. If you're coming to run around all day, still excellent. If you're coming just to watch the city and take in the beauty of the scenery, you're on the right track. Me personally - I love to grab a book, a towel, and just read away while taking in the beauty of the scenery. You have to go here - especially if you happen to find yourself in Hoboken for any reason. Not a contestable option.
2012-09-27,5,What a beautiful and relaxing spot to either sit on a bench, walk the dog or play frisbee. An amazing picturesque setting with the breeze from the Hudson and treed area with room to roam. Highly recommend this spot for relaxation and views of the city and river.
2012-08-22,1,The rating is for the misleading nature of the event.  I went to the park based a Yelp event and the NJSO was not there or never scheduled to be there on that day.  I wrote the host and did not get a response. Yelp needs a better outlet to vet this sort of stuff.  Now I see the host has another event on the newletter, are these events real?
2012-08-21,4,We found a music festival and a new park walking around after dinner. It is the Pier A park. New to us, but it opened in 1999. It is on Frank Sinatra Drive, It is within walking distance of Carlos Bakery. carlosbakery.com theboken.com/hoboken-hea...The event  was sponsored by Ben and Jerry's. They gave away FREE ice cream! We found the park  by accident and it was so very nice!The people were all there to have a good time! There were people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. The event was hosted by MTV's Matt Pinfield and featured the headliner band Tokyo Police Club. Other bands will include Vacationer, Shinobi Ninja, Body Language, Lights Resolve, We Barbarians, The Nightmare, River Band. Pilsener Haus was also provided and a free Biergarten at the event as well.In the past I was never a fan of Ben and Jerry's ice cream  But I am going to rethink it. I will do some more investigating of Ben and  Jerry's.  They had new flavors and frozen yogurt. It was pretty good! What was different than in the past was the texture it wasn't super frozen like the Ben and Jerry's I have had in the past. We had peanut butter banana and Raspberry chocolate chunks. The peanut butter banana was much better. The chocolate chunks were too frozen. But the other flavor was good and the texture was great!The park itself was really nice with a view of Manhattan's sky line.There were a lot of dogs and puppy's which I love too!It looks like there are always nice events in the park. hobokennj.org/venue/pier...It is a lovely park, residents are fortunate to live near by.
2012-08-07,4,I saw Mumford & Sons on Pier A.  I was surprised at how well this venue was setup.  It was very well planned out and I had a great time.  I could only hope that Hoboken puts on some more big name shows on the Pier.  I will definitely come back.The sound was absolutely phenomenal.  It was loud enough and brought such energy to the crowd.  Plus, Mumford & Sons are a pretty damn good band.  A+
2012-08-03,5,Great venue for a concert! They had food trucks, several beer tents (brooklyn brewery, coors light, corona ~$7 for 12 oz), a good amount of porta-potties (weird writing out that word...), 5 minute walk from the PATH train, a good amount of bars within walking distance for pre/post show (though, keep in mind the general demographic of Hoboken. LMFAO - Shots is still a relevant song apparently, beer pong is played on Weds night, and polo shirts and laptop bags are the official uniform). Sound was great, skyline behind the stage was great, Mumford & Sons put on an amazing show. The only negative I can think of is the fact that the bathrooms and beer and food are all on the left when you enter. So if you actually venture into the crowd, and walk all the way to the right of the pier - you better hope you dont have to leave that spot for the entirety of the concert. Could be alleviated with some barricades creating a path on that right side so you can walk around the perimeter of the crowd instead of cutting through and pissing off a whole slew of people.
2012-08-02,5,was an amazing outdoor venue for a concert.  saw Mumford & Sons here and the show ended in fireworks!
2012-07-18,5,Great views of Manhattan, nice wide open grass area, spitting distance to the Hudson river.  This one is hard to beat.  I also recommend the events they hold here in the summer like Movies on Wednesday Nights, they just had the Party with Purpose 5K here and in August Mumford & Sons are playing!!!!  Also, you are walking distance to the great restaurants and bars that Hoboken has to offer.This is one of the nicest parks I've even been too in Jersey.
2012-07-06,4,I came here to see the 4th of July fireworks.  I have always gone to Jersey city to get a  good view of the NYC Skyline in general, but Pier A is just as good.  The grass goes on forever, and there were many people laying down for a picnic. You do not get quite the same experience on Hudson place.
2012-06-12,4,I love this place... I really do. This is what I affectionately refer to as the Hoboken Beach, since everyone loves to lay out here. Great pier to run around (which I do 5 times a week), and great place to just sit and and hang out and enjoy the breeze and view and water.My only complaint is the homeless people who have claimed this land as their own... go for an early morning (.i.e. before 6 AM) expect to be heckled by homeless people, or at random hours, expect to see homeless people living and occupying the perimeter of the park.
2011-09-04,5,Love this place! Awesome place to hang out any time of the day, and any time of the year.
2011-08-22,5,My son is a huge Cake Boss fan and we discovered this park by accident one day several years ago while walking around Hoboken.  It has become one of my favorite places on earth.  Any time we go into the city we drive to Hoboken, grab breakfast and eat down by the water before we hop on the Path and we try to spend some time at the park before we head back home.  The view is amazing and it always quiet and peaceful no matter how many people are there.  It's my happy place!  :)
2011-03-20,4,Pier A Park is one of the best things about Boken, and by far is the best way to see Manhattan and the Hudson. Expect a lot of people laying out in summer, and expect to see some guys at the end fishing all year long. This is a great place to relax, walk around, and they have done nice improvements over the years adding the water kids area and 9-11 memorial. Pier C is a nice addition up the river a bit also.
2010-12-11,5,Pier A park is a great part of Hoboken. Its iconic Manhattan skyline views probably rank in the top 5 vantage points. The fountain in the warmer months is beautiful. A good chuck of the grass area was removed  about 7 years ago to plant about 50 ginko trees to remember Hoboken 9/11 victims, so you can't complain about that, but that area is missed.During June through August movies are shown every Wednesday night on one of those large inflatable screens. It's a great place to bring a blanket, some take-out dinner, and some clandestine wine, to enjoy a movie under the stars.Pier A is also great for people watching. From joggers and people doing yoga to people fishing, there's always something interesting to see.
2010-10-15,4,One of the best parts of living in Hoboken is that you can run along the river at Pier A park and enjoy an incredible view of Manhattan.  This park has plenty of seating and is a little oasis just a few blocks off Washington.  The only thing that I would say is a drawback is the fact that there's an abundance of homeless people who sleep in this park so super early morning runs aren't the best.  Anyone I've taken here, though, has been incredibly impressed.  It's a staple on my "This is why I moved to Hoboken" tour...
2010-09-06,3,It's a tiny park but I like it.  It juts out into the water so you get an awesome view of Manhattan.  There are tons of benches surrounding the park, so you can sit and watch the people go by.I like it when urban parks are active and this one is.  There are tons of people with their kids, jogging or walking by.  Granted, today was a holiday but the other time I was nearby, the park was also active.When I was there today a HUGE Holland America cruise ship was sailing down the Hudson and back out to sea.  It made me sort of jealous as I've not been on a cruise in over a year.  That's what makes this little park great.  You've got tons of activity from the people around you but also the activity on the Hudson. There is also that great view of the city.  The fact that it's a hop, skip and a jump from all sorts of transport is great too. I took the lightrail from Liberty State Park (boring...skip it) to the Hoboken terminal.  Then I just walked over to the park and hung out.5-stars is reserved for the awesome of awesome parks, like Yosemite.  This little patch of green is unexpected and does the trick when you just need to relax a bit.
2009-05-23,4,I quit my job on Wednesday, and on Thursday, I grabbed lunch, a book, and a towel, and spent several hours in this park. It was the first thing I thought to do when I finally had a day off.If you're falling out of love with Manhattan, and the smells and the noise and the prices and the people are too much, do yourself a favor and grab a quick PATH ride into Hoboken. About a block north of the terminal, close to the water, is Pier A, which will remind you of the true majesty of New York City.I bet some residents of the Palisades will dispute this, but this park has one of the best views of the western skyline. Because it's on a pier, you have unobstructed views to the north and south sides. You're also probably close enough to swim right across (but don't. The Hudson is nasty.) There are trees for shade, wide open patches of grass for sunbathing, and a gravel memorial garden for 9/11. A bike/skateboard path run through the park, which I believe will connect to a county-wide waterfront path. Ooo.The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because there are signs ALL OVER THE PARK saying to keep dogs on paved walkways and leashed, and yet every time I go there are several assholes with their dogs unleashed and pissing on the grass where people are laying and kids are rolling around. Hoboken dog owners are so disgusting and irresponsible.
