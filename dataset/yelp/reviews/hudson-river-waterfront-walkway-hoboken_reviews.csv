2020-12-16,5,Owned by Jennifer Hudson, Rock Hudson, and Hudson Hawk, I've got a few huds at my place, and now it's time to put my huds on and do this review.This riverfront walkway on the Hudson river is in Hoboken New Jersey, and I actually sleep here whenever I'm in Jersey and want a place to nap with a beautiful view. Don't tell anybody that, but when I come to New York and I'm on the Jersey side, I'll park right along here and I'll sleep.I think they tried to do some things to make that illegal lately, but I've still gotten away with it up until now, no tickets as of yet. It's a wonderful place to sleep and you wake up to the most beautiful City Sunrise with stark and intense views of Manhattan Island, Midtown literally right across the water like WHOA as Mya would say.It's impossible not to give this a 5-star rating, situated right along Frank Sinatra Drive or whatever it's called.
2020-12-15,5,I absolutely love and enjoy going on walks here specially during these covid times! Literally one of my favorite things to do while living in Hudson County. The Walkway is super long so you can literally go from North Bergen to Jersey City. You will find people walking, running and even biking. The view is a major plus because who doesn't love a nice walk with an even better view?? I know i do!
2020-11-25,4,Located on the western shore of the Hudson River in Hoboken, the Hoboken Waterfront Walkway runs from the tip of Bayonne to the George Washington Bridge. All along the waterfront walkway there are photographic views of the Manhattan Skyline, day or night. This vibrant area has a wide paved walkway allowing joggers, walkers and bikers to maintain social distancing.Along the way there are fenced in bog parks, children's play areas, access beaches to the Hudson river, ramps for wheelchair access, marinas and piers for ferries into Manhattan. Much of the walkway is tree lined and all of the walkway is pedestrian friendly. There parking garages a block from the river but they are pricy by most peoples standards. Some parts of the walkway have free non-metered street parking which is hit or miss.Lots of dining options are available 1 or 2 blocks up from the riverfront on Washington Street. Cowabunga Coffee Roasters is located right on the riverfront with Starbucks a block in. I had a few drinks at the Madison which is 2 blocks in on Washington Street.
2020-08-19,4,I enjoyed this place.  It is a nice place to just take a walk, jog or ride your bike. They are places to sit down and relax as well.  Visitors are treated to spectacular views of Manhattan. There is limited street parking available nearby. The view of the NYC skyline from is is great. It provides many good photo ops. I visited during the day, but I would imagine that the view would be more impressive at night. This is also home to the Weeehawken 9/11 memorial, a memorial that honors the city's residents that perished in the 9/11 attacks. The memorial is simple, but still powerful.  There are restaurants all along the waterfront and nearby neighborhoods. A nice place to just kick back and relax, be active (jog, bike) or both.
2020-08-19,5,The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway is probably one of my favorite things about jersey living. This pathway is massive and I believe (sorry if I'm wrong) but I think it goes from Jersey City all the way up through Hoboken and more (they all have Hudson Riverfront paths). You can walk for miles with unobstructed views of different parts of the NYC skyline depending on where you are over on the jersey side. You can walk, run, scooter, bike, and even sit along the numerous benches along the walkway and just enjoy being outside. This walkway also goes through numerous parks, cities, and piers, and is easy to get on and off of in case you need to divert your path for facilities, food, or more. This long stretch of walking path is incredibly clean, easy to navigate, and offers stunning views of the NYC skyline. The views can't be beat and it's a wonderful way to get out and get active. 15/10. I'd recommend anyone to come out here and take in the views and take a long relaxing stroll.
2020-04-28,4,Catching up on some past due reviews now that I'm staying home all day from covid-19. I visited my friend who lives nearby and loved walking along the waterfront here. The views were really nice looking across the river! It's relaxing to take a walk here, great for running as well. It's a spot where locals come out to hang out and there are parks around the area for families with kids. It's fun for people watching too during normal times. I'd come back again when things are back to normal!
2019-04-21,4,Overall a pleasant place to stroll along the Hudson on the New Jersey side with marvelous views of Manhattan across the way.  From where we ended our walk (at the Mitsuwa marketplace/Target), we were pretty much directly across from the Riverside Church at around 120th St. and a spectacular view it was.  We also revisited the walkway (at The Promenade shopping area) after sunset to see the city skyline lit up, spotted the Empire State building downstream and the GW Bridge upstream.  While it's a great place for a daytime or nighttime stroll, we did note that there were quite a few spots where the walkway was in poor shape, with crumbling bricks, unattractive fencing, empty lots - and if visiting at low tide, unfortunate views of garbage and trash half-buried in the river bed (like Target shopping carts ... ).  I guess you can time your visit at high tide which covers all these sins, but hopefully, some attention will be paid to cleaning up this otherwise potentially wonderful walkway.
2017-09-23,4,Best view of empire state and world trade center" - Was trying to find a place to see both iconic buildings clearly at same time... From Newport, you can have the best view of wtc, but empire state is little far and you can't have the best look...But Hoboken has it all... In the night, just sit around on the benches, relax and enjoy the view. You can walk around, there is a mile stretch of it. There is little park out there too for kids.
2017-09-14,5,This place is so lively independent of the time of the day. This place is amazing at night with all the lights and reflection in the river and pretty during daylight with breathe taking view. I envy the Jersey people for having such a place. This endless stretch of concrete offers such a pleasant view. There is so much to do nearby as well. Plenty of pubs, bars, food places.
2017-04-24,5,They say if you walk in someone's shoes, you can really feel how that person feels. Well, I felt more than fine after a few hours strolling this side of the Hudson and I envy the Jersey folk who get to stroll along this walkway. It sure is pretty here, for all you New Yorkers who are reluctant to cross the river. The civil engineers here have decided to landscape miles along the river, to help you forget about all in life that may be driving you batty. Listen to the water lap the waves, and the cry of the birds, feel the wind blow your hair. New York seems much prettier from this side, and you won't have the huddled masses yearning to jog, bike, run--all at once, as it sometimes seems on the Manhattan side. Even the pooches walked along here seem happy. I had a friend who lived in Edgewater, and I'm sorry she never really got the chance to appreciate or go for the long walks. It sure is relaxing and spacious on this side of the river, and you should let the Jersey folk know you're savvy enough to come over and bask in all the wonderful creation that is the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway.
2015-11-23,5,Hi my name is Dexter and I like to take long walks on the beach.  Doesn't that sound like some dating site commercial?  Well in the same regard the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway looks like it's the backdrop for any of those said dating site commercials.  Instead of an endless stretch of surf and sand, this amazing stretch of concrete offers visitors a view that can't compare.  Nearly level with the Hudson River, everyone young and old is treated to a gorgeous and I mean gorgeous view of the New York City skyline.  It stretches many miles through a least five towns and there is no site that is bad.  Think about that.  As you walk through this path of urban fare, you look across the river and there before you is the vast wonder of the modern world, the city of New York.  Whether you walk, jog, run, saunter, scamper, bike, Segway, or jump rope and juggle your way through this wonderful piece of work is perfect for any day or occasion.But just as you think that the view can't be any better the night hits and it's a whole new level of amazing.  The lights of the city illuminate from a distance and the reflection on the river creates an almost near mystical view that I say can only exist in the movies.  But alas it is real-life and seeing this magnificent view on this same walkway is as real as it can be.  So going back to what I was saying before.  Hudson River Waterfront Walkway may belong in those dating commercials where couples enjoy its grand view, but it's certainly for every age to enjoy.  I guess I should change what I said in the beginning.  Hi my name is Dexter and I like to take long walks near the Hudson.
2015-10-01,5,I went here completely by accident, I was looking for parking and then came across this area. It was absolutely beautiful. Very warm and romantic. I ended up taking a stroll wi th my boyfriend and then had dinner. If you want to the edge you can see beautiful views across the Hudson and see NYC buildings. It's great for pictures and just for a quiet night of talking.
2015-05-03,2,So much potential, and yet so poorly executed! I'm reviewing as a runner (most of my gripes will not be a problem for people who are just going for a stroll, or people who are biking), and also fully realize the futility of writing this review (because who's going to read my complaints and do anything about them?)To its credit, the path is a great idea - I love waterfront running/walking paths (especially after living in Chicago for five years, right by the lakefront trail) and this one has a wonderful view of Manhattan. A good view makes long runs so much more enjoyable. However, you only have to run about a quarter mile on the Hudson River Waterfront Walkway before you realize it was not designed by anyone with any running experience. There are 90+ degree turns every 30 seconds - which is terrible for your knees if you're going at a decent pace (not to mention that it makes it very difficult to keep your speed constant). There are also detours every half mile where it's unclear exactly where you're supposed to go in order to eventually get back to the walkway, so you're forever detouring onto the street. The parts of the walkway that are boardwalks (i.e. docks/planks rather than concrete) are poorly maintained and uneven, with planks sticking up every now and then that are easy to trip over. I run 20-30 miles a week and after half a mile on this walkway today, I couldn't wait for my run to be over. So, the path is really only good for walkers (I'd even be wary of trying to bike on it, since those uneven planks can't be good for road bike wheels, and the constant zigzagging every which way makes it hard to maintain good pace as well).And the people. Oh, the people. The walkway is packed with clueless tourists walking five-wide, parents letting their small children have full reign on their scooters and tricycles, couples inexplicably making out in the middle of the sidewalk (why???). Is it so much to ask that people keep to the side of the path if they're moving slowly?TL;DR: I'm glad that I'll be back in Manhattan soon so I can move my runs back to Central Park.
2015-03-13,4,In 2014, I biked close to 1,000 miles, 99% of it on the HRWW.  I can't say enough about it-it's perfect for strollers, riders, runners.  I'd love some more awareness of those using it-keep to your right, mind your kids and dogs, and generally have a clue-I'm a polite rider who announces myself coming upon groups ('on your left') but weekends and lunch times can be problematic with selfish people.I'm quite happy that the HRWW has now re-opened alongside the Port Liberte community after Hurricane Sandy repairs.  I'm adding a pic taken this week on the walkway where it's alongside the Port Liberte Canal-always a great place to stop and sit on a bench and rest or read for a bit.
2015-03-12,3,I'm an avid user of this walkway.  I walk on it.  I run on it.  I ride my bike on it.  The views are unparalleled.  It's supposed to run from the Bayonne Bridge to the George Washington Bridge, uninterrupted, eventually.  It's got 5 stars for effort but 1 star for execution.  The issue is, there are so many spots that are non-existent, or under construction.  You constantly have to go onto the sidewalk or street to continue your journey.  Once they actually do complete it, it's going to be such a wonderful thing.....
2015-01-06,5,The waterfront walkway in Hoboken on the Hudson River is absolutely beautiful! It is breath taking both morning and night. I feel like we don't really appreciate its beauty because were so conveniently close to it. This park is huge and great for a nice gathering with friends, a stroll in the park just to clear your mind, a romantic dinner at a near by restaurant while enjoying the view, or even a romantic picnic, or just simply watching some kids playing around with huge smiles on their faces. Its a nice place to unwind and just forgot about all the stress of work, bills, problems..etc...What to save some money? Use this free area to bicycle, run, stretch, jump-rope, just do activities that you would normally do in the gym but for free.. :-) It's a great way to meet new people especially if there walking their dog, its a good conversation starter especially if your single. I loveee coming here all year round, even though its the same view, its still an eye catcher and truly breath taking.
2014-08-20,5,This park has so few reviews because it is  broken up into many different local parks. It goes along the Jersey City - Hoboken waterfront for miles. Originally from New Jersey, we now live in Sonoma County Ca. Love our Regional Parks, they have great views but every step of the Hudson River Walkway has of view of The Empire State Building, World Trade Center and the entire NYC skyline. It is absolutely incredible and can't be duplicated anywhere in the world.It is very wide and alternates between wooden boardwalk and cement - decorative block. Walkers, joggers, bike riders all mingle together and it is never crowded.Plenty of coffee shops, sandwich places etc along the way as well as  a couple different NYC ferries, PATH trains and the NJ Transit train station on the Hoboken waterfront.  Forgot to add that leashed dogs are allowed.The Hudson River Waterfront Walkway may be the best freebie anywhere in the US. Enjoy!!
2014-07-10,5,I visited Hoboken and New Jersey for the first time over on the HRWW and this is such a beautiful place to overlook NYC, enjoying dinner and drinks, watching the city and people from this amazing view is so magnificent, glad I was able to visit on a nice summer day. Incredible. this is such a great place to visit if you are in from out of town.
2014-06-20,5,Amazing place. Just amazing. I love coming here to walk around, well long walks. The views are amazing of NYC, and the wind of Hudson River is great on a hot day. They have nice houses surrounding the waterfront. Plus, there is a nice bridge you can walk, and also a 9/11 memorial which is a hidden gem. Also Hamilton had his famous duel to death here.
2014-06-05,5,A great way to enjoy one of the best views of the New York City skyline.  The walkway sits right on the edge of the Hudson River and cover 18 miles from Bayonne to the George Washington Bridge.  Some parts of the walkway are still under construction, but the it detours through sidewalks, paths and other safe areas of travel. There are many areas to hop on the path but if you drive, be sure you don't park in residential reserved spots. The Weehawken Waterfront park is a great public place to park from dusk till dawn.It's one of my favorite places to bike, run or walk anytime of day!
2014-04-13,5,I love the Waterfront Walkway!  It's one of my favorite things about living in Northern NJ.It's a great place for a stroll along the water.   I love to go there with my dogs.   The only bad thing about it is that sections are closed off due to previous flooding and in some parts the pavers have been lifted up and not replaced yet.  (the section to the south of Whole Foods is closed off, as an example).I like to park near the Crab House or Trader Joe's and walk south.  The views of midtown and Southern Manhattan are fabulous.
