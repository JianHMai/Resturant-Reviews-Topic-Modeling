2021-10-31,4,Stopped in , around the corner from Carlos Bake shop, for a quick coffee. Very good Coronado. Hip little joint, quick service, delicious coffee
2021-08-26,3,We were attracted by the decor of The Roost Outpost and it looks really artsy & cozy. They sell not only coffee & pastries but also clothing & some cool stuff. We would like to purchase a bag of coffee bean which they used in store, so we asked the staff for help. However, the staff didn't focus on her work since she was playing with her pet (or might be a customer's). We ended up buying nothing since the conversation with the staff wasn't pleasant and we felt disrespectful.
2020-09-02,5,Really quality coffee and wonderful service. Shop has that Pacific Northwest feeling to it, love that.
2020-08-28,5,Not cheap but very yummy! This place is very boogie and has laughably expensive merch inside, but the drinks and food are good and only a little expensive. Loved the seasonal rose latte and pumpkin spice tea latte with oatly oatmilk. They also have a few solid gluten free snacking choices.
2020-05-11,5,This spot is still open and making deliciously unique coffees, teas and lattes! They took COVID19 as an opportunity to redo and revamp the shop a little and a I can't wait to see the final result, but even through the construction, the cafe part of the store is still open! I got a really delicious iced turmeric latte yesterday to take to the park and celebrate the beautiful weather. Over the past few weeks since being locked down in Hoboken, I've stopped in a few times with my boyfriend and have gotten something different every time. Hot coffee, mint tea, iced turmeric latte, a maple coconut latte (maybe that is wrong) that caught my eye from their sign outside. It's all been wonderful. All employees have been wearing gloves and masks and they make sure any customer inside the shop are wearing a mask as well. They usually have half the shop dedicated to clothes, accessories, etc (more geared to men I think) but that is the section that is currently under renovation. It can be a little pricey, but nothing too crazy or out of the ordinary for Hoboken. Next visit I'll have to try some of the baked goods that I always see. Thank you for staying open and keeping me caffeinated!
2020-04-29,3,The Roost Outpost is pretty good, but it's not quite my favorite. Really cool atmosphere inside and the staff is friendly. I've stopped in a few times for cappuccinos when I'm in the neighborhood and I find they tend to make Lattes no matter how I order. I think the coffee/espresso itself is decent. I really like the atmosphere inside. It's got a cool, authentic, "old Hoboken" kind of feel when so many other places are cookie-cutter Poke or Acai bowls shops. I really wanted to give this place 3.5 stars.How do we get 4 stars? Step up the cappuccino game with some of that thiccc foam on top! Step up the pastry game a bit!Want 5 stars? Offer up some sfogliatelle from Dom's bakery. The best around!
2020-02-20,5,A very Cozy Coffee house with a good variety of options. Great spot to go to to chill or just finish up some work.
2020-01-23,4,This is a mix between a coffee shop and a retail store with a super cute aesthetic. Very hipster vibes.Their coffee is great here with unique drink options as well! I usually just go for a latte.There's a good amount of seating, with the sides for more individual seating and couches in the middle for chatting. Definitely recommend you check this place out if you're looking for a chill place to do some work on your laptop.
2019-10-17,3,I really like this place and come here every time I'm in Hoboken, but I give it only three starts this time because they seem to have changed their policy on refills, or else I just never tried to get one before. The coffee for eat in is $3 and it is a normal, relatively small sized ceramic cup, way smaller than even a small to go cup, but you pay full price for a refill.  It should at least be a discount for the first refill.
2019-08-31,3,I definitely chose the wrong menu item and got the Pomegranate iced tea. Regardless, they have great bakery items and cute interior. There are random surf stuff so it feels like a weird beach shop/city cafe hybrid. Not much seating but the windows seats are great!
2019-08-20,2,Love the coffee here but the experience all depends on the barista. There's one very sweet female barista with long blonde hair but today the male barista told me to wait b/c he was backed up on orders and I did so. Gave him time and then he seemed like I was an imposition for wanting a latte...he said he needed a break and appeared so unhappy to be working it made me want to leave and go elsewhere...
2019-07-30,4,Super cute coffee/retail shop.  It's on first and Hudson, right next to what is the soon to be artichoke pizza location in Hoboken.I love this spot for a few reasons:  1) despite its proximity to the path, it's fairly quiet and has a chill vibe, 2) the coffee is excellent (try the pour over-it's one of the best, most smooth cups of coffee I've ever had), 3) there's lots of space whether it's the counter facing the street, or the couches in the center of the shop, 4) their prices aren't severely out of control for the quality of coffee you're getting.There are a lot of places to stop for a cup of coffee in Hoboken, and a lot of places right near the path (cup o joe, soon to be simply chai, I think there are a few small delis, one other small coffee shop a block down from the post office, etc), but this is worth a trip.
2019-06-09,1,Love the place, the vibe.  But the lady at the register had a friend or niece? or someone who was hanging out right by her register and playing her laptop videos out loud for a long time like an hour? even though there were other customers in the cafe quietly working..... it needs better management and educating the staff on keeping the place professional.  It's not your home.
2019-05-02,4,The Roost Outpost offers such a unique, hip coffee shop vibe which Hoboken deserves. It's nestled right behind Washington street making it a great location to get enough foot traffic but is quiet at the same time. I got an iced tea which they ran out of after my order but it was a nice day in Hoboken so that's pretty understood. The only downfall was that there's a $5 credit card minimum so as someone who rarely has cash on them, I had to buy a cookie. But the upside to that was that the cookie was a gluten free almond flavored cookie and was absolutely delicious! Highly recommend trying it out on your way to the Path/Train Station as an alternative to Starbucks!
2019-03-10,5,I was visiting from New York and couldn't find a Starbucks around Hoboken that had nitro cold brew. Feeling very grateful for that now because it led me to look up places around there that did and the first thing that came up was the Roost. The second I walked into this place I was hyped, the music was good! I did not catch the name of the guy working at the time, it was on Friday afternoon but he was great. Made me feel like a regular. Lastly, they have vegan options and that just made the experience even better !
2019-02-22,3,Location is off Washington. They have a sign out front. Cute decor inside. Staff is friendly. Coffee is okay. We've had better. I like that they offer dairy free alternatives. They charge for flavor too just like the coffee vault. So I didn't get a flavor. Ordered a latte with almond milk. Probably will not return. $9 for two lattes, one with almond milk. They have plain cups and they do have their label on the sleeves. Choc o Pain is a better flavor.
2019-02-15,5,I like this place! Hip local spot for Coffee. Paulo Is A awesome Barista:)
2019-02-10,5,Stopped in The Roost Outpost for a coffee while checking out Hoboken. Was met with a friendly guy behind the counter, David. Tried the charcoal mocha and although I was initially hesitant, it was actually really good. Great espresso/latte, cool vibe and friendly staff. I'd recommend stopping in!
2019-02-08,4,Awesome coffee spot with a chill vibe. They have a good amount of seating for being in Hoboken. There baked goods are amazing we had the croissant and the coconut pastry both were amazing. It's a little bit slow to get your drinks but worth the wait!!The coffee quality is fabulous. We got lattes and they tasted amazing. We will def be back!!
2019-01-23,5,Fave coffee shop in Hoboken! Same owner as ABC city Manhattan location. Way more space than the Manhattan location. Nice leather couches or grab a seat at the window to watch the world go by. Staff is friendly and coffee is good. Love the clothing store coffee shop combo. I'll be back!
2018-11-28,1,Best coffee in Hoboken, WORST service. They never open on time, charge extra to put a slash of almond milk in your coffee and are never open on time- waited 30 min post 'opening' time to get a simple cup of coffee. Not worth the bother
2018-11-07,1,The customer service was horrendous on November 4th at around 10am. When arriving the environment is welcoming even though the barista was not. When time to order he did not greet us or anything. He then proceeded to mess up the order and stated it was because we were talking as to why it was messed up. In discussing the situation with my friend he proceeded to announce to the entire coffee shop the we are being rude when in reality the only rude one was him. The shop needs a customer service course. For someone serving coffee he certainly needed a cup he was so cranky.
2018-11-05,5,Great tea and coffee selection! I had an earl grey tea but I was impressed by the specialty coffee selection.
2018-10-20,4,Swung by in the morning for a matcha latte. Staff was really friendly, latte was great. Cute little spot to discover! Great little area to sip your coffee and people watch.
2018-09-23,1,We've been coming to Roost for awhile and the coffee is good but we showed up at 6:30 pm for coffee and it had clearly been closed for awhile. The Hours dictate that it is open until 7. This is unacceptable considering we paid money to get an Uber and ended up with no coffee. Won't be coming back here for awhile since we now deem it unreliable unless something is done to convince us otherwise.
2018-07-12,4,This is a first, espresso cafe that also sells clothes...  They are cool clothes and some accessories.  Wonder how the business model is working.  The cold brewed Nitro and espresso donut I had were really good, worth returning for.  Baristas were both nice and accommodating.  2 small couches w/table and a bunch of stools along window counter are comfortable.
2018-04-15,5,Perfect latte with skim milk and a pistachio and cherry biscotti.  Yum, yum, in my tum... love the ambiance here, too.  Perfect place to sit, relax for a moment with a coffee and watch the world go by....instagram.com/p/BhmNslYh...
2018-04-10,5,Cutest shop with amazing coffee and merch gems! So awesome to see a new spot open up in Hoboken with such character. Will be back! :)
2018-01-26,4,Great little coffee shop. Couldn't find wifi, but they had good esspresso and window seats so I can work for a while. There was also a shop inside with some local clothes and other sundries. Friendly and cozy
2018-01-08,5,First time at The Roost Outpost and there were no regrets! There were a variation of teas, lattes and coffee. I went for the almond chai latte and it was delicious, it was not overly sweet which I appreciated. The atmosphere of the coffee shop was relaxing and modern. Definitely will stop here whenever I visit Hoboken again.
2018-01-06,5,Stranded with a dead battery on one of the coldest days of the year. Ran across the street for a cup of joe and found a gem of a place! Great coffee and pastries and a warm and comforting vibe. What a treat!
2017-10-30,5,A hidden gem!  Upscale coffee shop sharing space with a men's clothier.  Love the atmosphere as well as the coffee and pastry options. Staff is super friendly. Skip the Starbucks a block away and have some real coffee here!
2017-09-30,5,Nice vibe. Good tea and coffee. Interesting merchandise. Great for a date, catch up with old friends, or just a change of scenery.
2017-06-30,5,It's all about the beans, you know. Very picky about my coffee and have no hesitation sending back too bitter an espresso or too weird tasting a cappuccino even in some upscale places. Roost gets theirs from a small batch roaster in Union City and the flavor is smooth and very consistently good. I'll often get iced cappuccinos here and put them in the freezer for that slushy effect. Have not tried their cold brew yet, but intend to. The baristas are friendlyand the vibe here is laid back.  Kind of over Starbucks and for the same money am getting a better quality coffee. Next door to the old barber shop and across from Walgreens, its a greatlocation on the way to the Path.
2017-06-27,5,Roost has absolutely delicious coffee. My boyfriend just moved to the area and this has been our everyday go to coffee place. The iced coffee is outstanding !
2017-05-25,5,This is a very trendy/hip cafe. It is a mix between a cafe and mens clothing shop with other fun knick knacks.I def recommend the cold brew here. It is soo good! They also have a small selection to munch on but I would definitely go for the drinks - they seem to specialize in unique latte combinations.Service is great, coffee is great, prices are comparable to others in the area and it's a very chill atmosphere.
2017-05-21,5,I was on my way to a different cafe when I passed by this store. I saw one person inside (who happened to be the employee or he could've been the owner), so I figured it'd be quicker just to get a cold brew from here. Honestly before I walked in I thought it was just a cafe, but as it said in the front of the store and on the glass it's also a general goods store. I should've taken a quick look around because it looked like a neat store to buy things from, but I just bought a nitro and left. The nitro was pretty much what you'd want out of a cold brew. So the least I can say about this spot is that it has a great coffee.
2017-04-16,5,This is a great little cafe in Hoboken with very friendly staff, great coffee (especially cold brew), and a relaxing interior.
2017-04-03,4,The barista was friendly despite having a broken arm. He was knowledgeable about the coffee sold by The Roost Outpost and the products sold in the Brower Club. I can only speak on the Nitro coffee because it's the only thing I ordered but I thought it was smooth and creamy with the perfect foamy top. Pros:- They have a loyalty program too: every $1 spent gets you 1 point. - Outlets near the window seats.- Pet friendly (I saw someone bring their dog into the store as they sat by the window to have coffee)- Baked goods from Balthazar's. Cons:- Limited seating (maximum 8 plus however many the couch can fit but the couch is actually a product they're selling in the store)- Service was a bit slow so may not be the best for those rushing during a morning commuteTry it on the weekend on your way to the Path or detour off Washington. It's pretty easy to miss but it's worth the trip on a lazy Sunday.
