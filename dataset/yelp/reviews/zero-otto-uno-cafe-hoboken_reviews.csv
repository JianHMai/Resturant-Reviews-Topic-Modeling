2021-10-15,2,We ordered most of the same things on this most recent visit but everything was oilier and saltier. The best was still probably the mushroom pappardelle, although it's a really rich dish and probably not something you could eat entirely by yourself.We were the only ones dining there on a Sunday at around 1. Our waiter looked like he did not want to be there at all. Not one smile, and barely made eye contact with us.With so many new Italian restaurants always popping up in Hoboken, don't think we will be back to this one.
2021-10-12,5,Had dinner here last Saturday with a few girlfriends. Thankfully we had reservations because the place really filled up! It is BYO, so don't forget to bring what you'd like to drink. After ordering, the food came very quickly but I am pleased to say that it did not feel like we were being rushed through our meal or rushed out the door.We split the arugula salad, Fiamma pizza (spicy sausage, tomato, mozz), Vegetariana pizza (tomato, mozz, eggplant, zucchini), and spinach & ricotta ravioli. I strongly recommend saving room for dessert because the Nutella calzone was warm and gooey and delicious. You won't regret it! :)
2021-09-19,5,I am a native italian girl so without  being arrogant  I know my food and I know what I am talking about.I love zeroottouno.It's a great place , located on the  main street and they have one of the best pizza I ever ate in America.Whenever I feel homesick I come to eat here.The meat and cheese plate is delicious too.Very fresh.I tried once their pasta with mushrooms and truffle and it was fantastic.Mostly, I eat pizza there and it's great.The owners are authentic southern italians , I met them personally.Waiters are usually very friendly nice spanish guys.I highly recommend this restaurant.Grazie zeroottouno!
2021-08-29,5,Wow wow and wow. Had a Sunday al fresco and the food, bread, pizza, and app amazing flavors and quality. Bottom line, don't read delivery reviews, you can't deliver this greatness, it has to be kitchen to table not kitchen to driver to car to your apartment. First, get the calamari shrimp dish, has some peppers and even fried lemon. Presentation is a A AND the flavor excellent. One of the best in this area.Pizza, fresh quality ingredients and a real Napoli experience. Equal to Italy. Fusilli Shrimp w zucchini dish had a perfect texture and sauce. Chef nailed everything!Would definitely return, BYOB, wine store on next block so easy. Service with Joseph Efficient and quite amiable.
2021-08-22,5,Literally everything was amazing. When we first got there, it was pretty nice out but started to rain shortly after.  The hostess moved my party of 6 inside and the deliciousness began! The mussels and grilled octopus were perfection! Will 100 percent be going back!
2021-08-21,5,Delicious food and outstanding service.  I was looking for a place to take my sons and nephew to dinner and wanted a reasonably priced BYOB with option to dine outside.  My son suggested Zero Otto Uno based on a past experience.  I was concerned when I read the yelp reviews but made a reservation anyway as my son has lived and dined in Hoboken for years and this was his recommendation.  We started with the burrata prosciutto special and it was incredible!  The pizzas were delicious, as was the shortrib pasta dish (I'm told).  I had the caesar salad with salmon.  I was delighted to see wild salmon on the menu as it is usually farmed which is a non starter for me.  Our server was fantastic.  He was personable, engaging, fun and on top of our every need.  Will go again!
2021-07-26,2,My fiancé and I stopped by for dinner tonight and were so disappointed with our meal. The server was very friendly, but the food was extremely lackluster. We started with the mussels in a white wine sauce. The mussels were tender, but the broth lacked any flavor. Then we ordered the margherita pizza but the sauce tasted bitter and there was no basil. The other pizza we ordered was decent, but certainly not worth the price. Overall, we would not return. We could have ordered a better pizza from one of the other pizzerias in town without the hassle of doing a full sit down dinner and waiting too long for our pizzas to come out when it wasn't a full house.
2021-07-26,2,I've never been to a restaurant that had such a disparity between the quality of the food and the service/experience.  We chose this restaurant as it was empty (literally no other customers). Pre-pandemic we would never have bothered but here figured as long as the food was at least decent we would prefer the comfort of being maskless as the only patrons. From a flavor/quality perspective everything we ordered was between average and very good, which in my book counts as a win. However, there were multiple issues that made this a one and done choice for us.  For starters, the staff didn't seem to have any experience. This is sort of understandable given the work situations that have played out over the past year so somewhat sympathetic there. However, when you ask a menu question, "I don't know" isn't a suitable response. The customer shouldn't have to then request the waiter go ask about it with the kitchen/chef. This happened on multiple occasions and we frankly had no confidence that we were getting accurate information. Do they really not use egg in their fresh pasta? Maybe, but I've never seen that as standard at any other restaurant. I've never been asked at a reasonably nice restaurant to hold my used silverware while they take plates away to then reuse on the next course. I don't really care about it, but it was pretty ridiculous holding a fork and knife with smears of arugula and cheese on it for several min while the next course was brought out. Seemed off they didn't either provide new ones or a small plate/napkin to rest it on. Again, I don't really care and didn't mind it, but it seemed like something I'd expect at a cheaper restaurant and not something that is tying to pass itself off as nicer. The worst problem we had though was the garbage. I'm not sure how sanitation codes work but I've never seen the staff wheel garbage out through the main restaurant area and by customers. I was under the impression there were side/rear entrances for that. It literally smelled like diapers/rotten cabbage while we were eating our food. We actually cut our dinner short and left earlier because it was that bad.Anyway, the food was good so maybe give it a shot to go. But definitely not worth eating there.
2021-06-29,4,I read so many awful reviews about service I had low expectations- the funny thing about that is the service started off great and then went to crap. The team was clearly just pre occupied and easily distracted. The bus boys worked their butts off- I really appreciate all their help the entire evening. The waiters not so much.Anyways I'm not going to judge only on service so moving on to food! We started with sparkling water and then tried the fried seafood (fried calamari/shrimp) very good and perfect to share! I then tried the spaghetti carbonara and my friend had chicken scarpariello which he loves. The bread to start was also delicious. I'd give eat their again  but would like to try pizza and salads next time!
2021-06-29,3,We came here because we did not have any other option around that we hadn't tried. I order the pasta Bolognese and was extremely creamy (please don't put heavy cream on Bolognese). The pizza was decent, and the service was okay. Prices are high for the quality of the food. Overall I will not be coming back, nothing memorable.
2021-06-25,5,Amazing meal. Very fresh. The salmon was amazing as was the spinach ravioli. Nice ambiance we sat outside.
2021-06-20,2,Went for the first time this weekend after a recommendation from a friend. The food was good but just couldn't get past our horrible service... We had a 430 reservation for 6 for an early Father's Day dinner on a Saturday and were the first and only customers for about an hour and were so disappointed by our server! He was just so inattentive and unwelcoming that it makes you almost uncomfortable to even ask for water! I could understand if it were busy but when you're the only customers it's unacceptable. Lived in Hoboken for years and have never had such poor service at any restaurant.
2021-06-14,3,Ordered a squid ink linguini for delivery. It had pretty good flavor with a generous amount of shrimp and tomato sauce, flavored strongly with garlic. Overall I'd say the sauce was excellent, but the pasta was just slightly overdone and could have had a bit more squid ink flavor.3.5 stars
2021-05-09,1,Had a confirmed 6:00pm reservation tonight to celebrate Mother's Day for my fiancé and her sister. Arrived at 6:00pm.  The server said that he wasn't aware of a reservation. As we waited, he allowed a similarly sized party--all White--to be seated before us.  We asked to see the manager but the server refused and told us he was both the "owner and manager".  I've never experienced such deplorable service and discrimination. We decided not to patronize this racist establishment. Also, large groups of guests were not wearing masks as they congregated outside and inside. Very cramped space and not a covid safe setting.
2021-04-18,5,I went for dinner here on a weekend for date night. The staff was really accommodating with everything. I booked my reservation on open table. It is BYOB. Everything we ordered was delicious! We will be coming back :)
2021-04-17,5,Great food. Great service. Sonny was super accommodating. Easily the best Neapolitan pizza in Hoboken and likely Hudson county. Rest of their Italian dishes were superb as well. Don't miss out on ordering expresso and dessert after enjoying byob.
2021-04-11,2,We had a really terrible experience at Zero Otto Uno.Last night, I hosted a birthday dinner of 12 people (2 adjacent tables of 6) and was very upset with the service we received. The wait staff was incredibly rude to both myself and members at both tables. Waiter (Danny) and other who I dont have a name for, was treating us like we were such a burden to them when we went above and beyond to be respectful as we too work in the restaurant industry and understand the trials that come from such. The birthday boy was incredibly embarrassed. They were so rude, in fact, that it monopolized the conversation for the entire night. It was our first and last time going to Zero Otto Uno.
2021-04-10,1,Made a reservation for 2 on open table came in 5 minutes before the reservation and checked in. We were then told that the reservation did not matter and they did not have a table for us(2 tables were open) Things happen but no apologies from the employee and he didn't even pretend to care that they didn't have a table for us. This has turned me off of this place for good. Luckily it's hoboken and can get Italian elsewhere.
2021-03-29,1,This is the worst service I have ever experienced in Hoboken. The owner here does not care to take the time to read the specials etc. he was so rude in fact we stood up and left. Three other tables got up around us because they overheard him. Definitely not coming back here!!
2021-03-19,1,Horrible customer service. Had a reservation and the host didn't even ask what the reservation name was and skipped over me and sat 3 other tables that checked in after us and said they had earlier wait times which wasn't true because the other guests told me they had the same wait time. Unfortunately not coming here again.
2021-02-28,2,I have been dying to go to this restaurant for months. I finally decided to make a reservation. I DMed Zero Otto Uno on Instagram that morning asking if they take cards because I had a friend who went who was told it was cash only because "the card machine was down". Zero Otto Uno responded to my DM saying they take cards. We arrive to the restaurant for our reservation and there is a sign up that says cash only. After the wait staff rushed us through our meal they came over and let us know it's cash only and they're not taking cards. We then showed them the DM and they proceeded to say the "card machine went down 20 minutes ago" meanwhile the cash only sign was up the entire time. They then told us we could pay by zelle and they would not take a card. Poor customer service all around. Will not return.
2021-02-16,1,I took a girl here on a date. Big mistake. Other than the food being disgusting and the pizza being soggy, the service was even worse. The owner/manager was trying to get me to leave prematurely because he was anxious about customers waiting outside. When I politely asked him to grant me another few minutes to finish my wine, he said "Maybe if you were spending more money, I'd let you stay. $63 is nothing" and then he walked away. That was very embarrassing for me. If the food was good I'd give this place 3 stars but it sucked.
2021-01-30,5,I've had a lot of Italian food in the area and I have to say- this place is definitely one of the best around. The Rigatoni Bolognese was one of the bests I've ever had. The environment is cozy. A great spot for a date night! And it's BYOB which is always a nice option! 10/10
2021-01-23,1,I was planning to go here for a friends birthday so planned ahead and made a reservation for our party of 7.  I emailed their contact us on their website A WEEK IN ADVANCE and got confirmation back via email that we were "all set".  When we all showed up for dinner they had no reservation for us. Which I can understand mis-ups happen especially during these crazy covid times.  BUT the way the waiter completely disregarded it and didn't apologize at all just kept going on working was very disappointing.  He didn't even offer what the wait time would be  I wish you all the best but my advice - customer service is important.
2021-01-20,5,I'm so happy I came across this Restaurant and I'm even more happy that they are staying afloat throughout the pandemic. The pizza here is one of the best In the area, wether it is the special pizza of the day or the margherita you won't go wrong. Also tried some pasta and appetizers no complaints here, will be going back for more, staff is friendly.
2021-01-16,1,Last weekend, I made a reservation for two over the phone.  The host confirmed. We arrived at the restaurant about 5-10 mins before our reservation, along with 2-3 more couples.  The host asked me what my name was for the reservation.  I told him, and he said that he didn't have any record of it.  No big deal, but it was evident that they overbooked for that time slot.  We waited outside.  Fast forward 20-30 mins after our reservation, and there is still no table ready.  My girlfriend walks inside, and sees the host setting up a table for a party of 4-5.  Mind you the party is not at the restaurant yet.  She asks him when our table will be ready, and he told her that we need to keep waiting.  We decided to leave at that point.I've worked in the food industry for years.  This is not how you treat customers.  The host made a mistake, and overbooked for our time slot.  He could've at least made an effort to accommodate us, but did no such thing.  I don't even recall him apologizing or showing any remorse.  I get it, your restaurant is popular and we're just a party of two.  But you made the mistake in the first place.  At least attempt to get us seated less than 30 mins after our reservation time.
2021-01-15,5,The food was delicious and the service was stellar.  I had one of the specials for that night shrimp risotto.  It came out piping hot (which for me is very important.  We also ordered the skirt steak, salmon and had the chef creat a simple meal for our picky eater.  Everything was memorable.  We ate here about a month ago.  Sorry for the late review.
2021-01-13,5,Always amazing whenever I have this spot! This time bad pistachio and spinach/ricotta ravioli which were bomb! Truffle pappardelle GOODNIGHT. Meatballs were super moist and flavorful. 4 cheese white pie with half prosciutt was fire. Can't go wrong here!!
2021-01-04,5,Favorite restaurant and even better during covid. Great atmosphere and covid safe. Such a tough and near impossible environment for small business with the extremely overreaching restrictions out in place for Nj. Glad it's we these guys doing what they can to survive, with great food and working with the restrictions to best of their abilities.
2021-01-02,1,I ordered a pizza and the delivery guy (Mohamed) refused to walk up to the 4th floor where I live. So we agreed to meet half-way on the 2nd floor. When I got to the 2nd floor, I saw he left the pizza box on the floor. I told him it was poor service and he left laughing. The pizza was cold even though I live just one block away. Never again.
2020-12-29,1,If you want COVID or any other communicable disease, run don't walk to this restaurant. However, if you are not looking to have an extremely disturbing experience I'd stay away. While dining there, the table next to us got the wrong order. Despite this, they started eating and about five minutes later decide they'd rather have their intended dish. They handed their plate to the waiter, the waiter scooped off their uneaten shrimp pieces, and realized hey that table over there also got this dish, so let me give it to them. Twenty seconds later the waiter is at our table dropping off a half  eaten plate. It was so obvious the lettuce was flattened and some of the food missing. They didn't make any attempt to even hide the fact this food had been already eaten.Immediately suspicious, we ask the waiter 'is this the food the guy next to us just ate' and he got that oh shit look on his face & said yes. But he still didn't make any attempt to apologize or get us a new plate, but ultimately we force him to. Later we confront him about it and he goes 'I didn't realize he started eating it'. Umm wtf? You can't drop something off to someone and then five minutes later expect to give that to another diner.This is despicable even not in a pandemic & we didn't even get an apology. To me it seemed like this was a normal thing they probably do all the time. The establishment should be embarrassed. For now, I'll settle with spreading this far and wide that everyone stay away from this place. Food sucks too. They will try to take this review down but it's true so deal with it.
2020-12-24,1,Server was condescending to the party at entree placing, staying "no need to order, you don't want food" for a skinny woman in our party. Server removed appetizer plates while food was still on the plates. Appetizers of fried seafood and octopus smelled of low tide, not fresh. Pass on this one.
2020-12-24,1,The worst experience for that restaurant, but the worst thing was asking to talk to the manager and to know that the manager was our server...
2020-11-23,5,Came back to taste their pizza. It's Napolitan style, again they use the best ingredients. Had the truffle prosciutto pizza and it was yummy. Definitely worth the visit when you are in Hoboken.
2020-10-31,4,BYOB delicious italian food. They have a good outdoor setup and a liquor store next door. The salad was great to start off with. The pizza was the special with black truffle proscuitto and burrata. The pasta was also very good but I like the pizza better. Great service and very friendly staffs! Def will come back for more pizzas!!
2020-10-27,5,Overall great service, great food, great set up. BYOB. We indulged in the specials for the night which were a really nice steak and fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp. Will definitely keep coming back. Although we dined inside, they have heaters in place for outdoor dining.
2020-10-18,5,My friends and I had a wonderful dinner! We started with the burrata and then split two pastas and a pizza. All were excellent but the favorite was the truffle pappardelle! They also had specials that sounded great as well. I would definitely come back.
2020-10-12,3,A solid 3.5 stars for me if it were an option. Even with a packed house, the restaurant was very accommodating when I requested to move the reservation 30 minutes forward about 3 hours prior to arrival. The service during our meal was also good. The fiamma pizza was very good - maybe could've used a few more pieces of soppressata, but the perfect amount of cheese. The pizzas are probably too much for 1 person, but not enough for 2. The rigatoni bolognese caught good reviews from the table, while the gnoochi special was average. We did not have dessert. This place is BYOB and I would return.
2020-10-05,2,Quite disappointed with our recent visit after hearing others liked the food. Unfortunately, the chef overcooked the appetizer and one meal. The other meal was good, so I'll give points there. But the service? Oh my, where to begin? I'll make it quick.....the staff is quite rude and doesn't care if you enjoy yourself or your meal. There are a million other places in Hudson county to spend your hard earned money. Go elsewhere.
2020-09-15,1,I'm extremely disappointed to be leaving a bad review as I had high hopes for this place. We ordered takeout for my sisters birthday-2 pastas, 2 entrees, and a pizza. The food arrived almost 2 hours later. Not only was it cold, the "fresh" pappardelle and bolognese had absolutely no taste. We called the restaurant to see if there was a possible error and our call was received with hostility. As someone who spent over 10 years in the restaurant industry and is a lifelong resident of Hudson county, everything about this place disappoints.
2020-09-13,5,Last Sunday, our party of 8 stopped by for dinner after exploring the Hoboken waterfront. We stopped by on a whim after another establishment near the waterfront disappointed us and couldn't seat us without a wait (although they had plenty of seating available). As we walked up to Zero Otto Uno, we noticed a few tables were available and told the staff that we would even split up, if need be, if they could accommodate us. The gentlemen who greeted us surveyed what was available and asked us if we wanted him to maybe setup a few tables adjacent to what was already set out, so that we could all sit together. We jumped at the offer and thanked him for doing that. A couple of other staffers were summoned over to get our setup completed sooner. Talk about service!Once we were seated, we were brought over disposable single-sheet paper menus which displayed all their offerings for the day. We asked for non-pasta suggestions and our server said the salads were great - and shareable - and that their pizzas were fantastic.  We decided "to start" with 3 salads and 5 pizzas and that ended up being enough for all of us. The salads were good and a nice starter, but the pizzas were the stars of the meal! Upon being dropped off at the table, I could tell they were very similar to the pizzas we had on our trip to Italy. Biting into them confirmed that as the crust was thin while being perfectly chewy with the right amount of crisp & char. The ingredients were top notch, too, and everything was in good balance. I honestly couldn't get enough of them!While the salads are shareable, the pizzas are close to being just enough for 1 person (if one is pretty hungry). They do not serve any alcohol, but the server told us that we were welcome to pick up something from a few doors down and bring it open, and that he could bring out wine glasses and open wine for us. Talk about a win/win - you get to bring your own wine and not have to pay the upcharge you would expect for the same bottle if the restaurant had provided it!Our server was attentive throughout and pleasant, and the weather was perfect for dining al fresco. The bill came out to almost $150 (before tip) but the quality of the food made it worth it. I would come back here again in a heartbeat when we are back in the area. Next time, I may have to force myself to pass up the terrific pizzas and try some pasta. Or maybe I'll have both
2020-09-07,1,Service was not good at all. Had to ask several times for water and the waiter kept saying sure. Then the meal came. I asked for grated cheese several  times and finally got it when my meal was warm to cold. The comes time to pay and waited 20 mins for the check even though he gave the check to other customers. Maybe you will get a better experience, but I won't be going back. Good Luck!!!
2020-09-07,4,This spot has fantastic italian food. Presentation is very nice, taste is excellent. I definitely recommend the appetizer special which includes burrata, cantaloupe and prosciutto, and the Fiamma pizza. Desserts are good, espresso is delicious. It's a slight bot pricier than what I'd like it to be, but worth it.
2020-09-05,1,Ok at best very bland sauce the zero in the name is a good representation of the food
2020-09-04,5,I write this to you as I sit here reflecting back on how amazing the food is here! Authentic, perfectly cooked no nonsense Italian food. Not to mention amazing service, ambience all around. We started with the caprese  and nonna salad. Both great for an entree or sharing dish for the table. If I had to choose between the two I'd select the caprese. For entrees, if they have a special go for it. Tonight's special was the fusilli with pink sauce and salmon. I opted out for the salmon, but hands down best pink sauce I've ever had. The pasta was cooked to perfection and my husband almost licked the bowl. It's also not heavy feeling which sometimes happens with pink sauce so feel free to enjoy! We also got the linguini with clams. Comes in a butter wine sauce and it's the first linguini and clams dish my mother ate to its entirety. It's the only dish she orders at Italian restaurants and said hands down 10/10 best one she has had. The other star of the night was the pizza! They have a brick oven inside and we took the Margherita. The table next to us had the white pizza that was also delicious. The pizza was perfectly cooked with not a floppy bottom! Another 10/10! Other bonus points for the fresh bread and bomb olive oil served with it. This is my new go to in the neighborhood!
2020-09-01,5,Exceptional food & service! Got the shroom pasta, meatball app, and nutella dessert pie. Byob -- liquor store right next door.
2020-09-01,1,The head waiter at this restaurant is the rudest person I have ever come across. Everything about this restaurant made for a terrible experience. Would highly recommend taking your business elsewhere.
2020-08-30,5,One of my favorite Italian restaurants, great service and amazing food. Also love that it's byob !
2020-08-28,5,This place is sweet, romantic, authentic and in accordance with all covid 19 guidelines. My date and I were late for our 9pm reservation on a Sunday and were seated immediately. Specials were still offered as was everything on their menu. Tried all courses and the dessert. There isn't anything I don't recommend you try if you are looking for true italian food. I also recommend coming here after the dinner rush for dates. Its quiet, well lit and gives an opportunity to walk on the strip after dinner.
2020-08-17,5,I've tried all of the individual sized pizza from Zero Otto Uno & all were so so good! I couldn't wait to take a picture for Yelp! It tastes like Pizza tastes in Italy. It reminded me of Vesuvius in Florence, IT. During the pandemic, since wecouldn't eat it fresh, we ordered pizza to go & put it in the oven for 1-3 min and it was just like eating it at the restaurant. Yummy!
2020-08-15,1,Tried ordering takeout from here tonight. I waited in the restaurant for 45 minutes before giving up and walking out on the order. The wait staff was extremely rude and basically ignored me. When I did manage to get their attention & explained my husband and 2 year old were waiting in the car for me, they kept telling me a couple minutes (thanks for managing expectations!). Fortunately their ordering system only had a cash option so I didn't need to fight to get my money back. By the time I left there were a bunch of other people waiting and angry too. I can't speak for the food because we never got it (although stuff going to the tables looked good) but this was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. DO NOT ORDER TAKEOUT FROM HERE!!!
2020-08-06,5,This place is sooooooo good!!!!The pizza and pasta literally imitate dishes that you would normally be served in Italy. So authentic and delicious. They have a great way of pairing ingredients to create the perfect flavors.  Outdoor seating for the summer and BYOB makes it even better! I highly recommend the black truffle and porcini mushroom pappardelle - all of their pizzas are amazing as well.
2020-06-29,3,Not sure how many stars to give business that can't update their business hours... went there at 3pm from jersey city because on yelp it shows "open" but they are closed until 4pm  so upsetting considering you have to keep going round the block to find parking... luckily pizza republic is nearby and open.
2020-06-28,5,During the covid 19 review: It's been a while since I had a nice Italian meal outside at a restaurant. This was great! Grilled seafood had calamari, scallop, shrimp and how they were grilled was spectacular. Grilled to perfection. I don't love scallop but they were prepared to perfection with crisp outside. Truffle parpadelle was awesome. It wasn't exactly what I expected because I thought I saw freshly shaved truffle in another help picture but it was not fresh truffle. It had good amount of mushroom and pasta was cooked perfectly. I think they just started doing the outdoor sitting. I think it's a MUST try in Hoboken!
2020-06-22,2,Not impressed. Was psyched to try the salmon salad. It came thrown together in a cardboard box. Salmon was clearly farmed and not wild-caught as stated on menu. They also could have at least let the fish cool down for a few minutes before plopping a hot filet onto my salad greens. I don't get the hype. Won't be back.
2020-06-03,3,YES TO THEIR PIZZA, NO TO THEIR SERVICEThere are not many places in Jersey City and Hoboken where one can get good pizza, hence we have decided to try Zero Otto Uno regardless of the bad reviews on several platforms regarding their tardiness and bad service. My average rating is simply due to the fact that I cannot agree more with people who mention their subpar service and the staff friendliness. We went with two friends (we were all Italian) so we are quite used to small places and a 'creative' service - however, we are not used to rudeness and carelessness and none of us accepts it.We had booked a table and the table wasn't ready for another 35 min to which we told ourselves "ok, let's open a bottle of wine and wait" - no complaints here. We finally sit down, and the Italian-american waiter takes our order and we do some small talk on our origins and so on.  When we ordered, I specifically asked and repeated twice that my mozzarella di bufala to be added once the pizza comes out of the oven (you will NEVER, EVER see an Italian person ask for their mozzarella di bufala to be oven-cooked. never.). The rest of the party asked for three different pizzas. We all get our pizzas and mine was clearly placed in the oven the whole way through. Once I told the waiter about it, the first thing that comes out of his mouth is "but you didn't tell me that" - which is the most dreaded answers a client wants to hear when they mess up their order. Whatever, I told him I was sure that I had told me and ate my pizza anyway. To be fair, he did ask me if I wanted another one, but I am not a Karen, so I just ate what I had received. Long story short: go there for the pizza, don't go there for the service.
2020-05-28,5,One of our go-to Italian places! Phenomenal pizza and pasta, and they even have my favorite salad in Hoboken, the Della Nonna with salmon! The staff is always so kind and accommodating - they make you feel like family! While our absolute favorite thing to do is come here and sit outside with a bottle of wine on a nice night, we've been loving ordering from them during quarantine! Delivery is super fast. I can't say enough good things about them. Really can't wait to dine there in person very soon!
2020-05-16,5,The best decision I made during quarantine was to order from ZOUC. Fresh, house made pasta, great flavors, plus friendly and quick service. The pizza was fresh too, everything arrived hot. What to try next...
2020-03-13,4,Ordered Regina margarita pizza one night for myself. The delivery was super quick and the pizza was good. Sauce wasn't too salty and had a hint of sweetness to it. Could've used maybe a tad more cheese, and maybe a slight crunch to the bottom. (But that's just my preference) Crust texture otherwise was amazing and similar to Italy. It was thin yet puffy around the edges. Overall a delicious Neapolitan pie!
2020-03-01,5,True Italian restaurant!! Excellent pizzas and the pasta is fantastic.
2020-02-29,5,Quiet, attentive, and lovely restaurant.  The meal was perfect.  We had the salad, pasta, and pistachio dessert.  We will come from Astoria again to eat here.
2020-02-23,5,Our favorite Italian restaurant in Hoboken. Always accommodating whether it's for 2 or 8! The menu is perfect. The food is always so fresh and the service is great. We share a pasta and pizza every time we come. We love Tony he's the best!
2020-02-18,5,This is now my favorite italian byob in Hoboken - came here twice and both times were incredible. Love the meatballs and pizza and pasta are just lovely. Service is great! The decor and ambiance is great for dinner with a friend or date.
2020-02-16,1,After confirming on two separate occasions this would not be a pre-fix menu on Valentine's Day, once we sat down we were handed a pre-fix menu. The menu was 90% seafood. No plain pasta or pizzas could be made to accommodate for non-seafood eaters. The wait staff was rude and one of the waiters was drunk, repeatedly messing up our orders and speaking gibberish. I felt our meal was extremely rushed as waiters came to our table asking to clear plates that we were still working on over 10 different times. When we finally got to the dessert, after giving us the wrong plates at first try, the red velvet cake was frozen. Could not even get a spoon through the cake to eat. Will not be dining here again.
2020-02-09,5,Amazing italian type pizza! Antoine was a very good host. I highly recommend this place.
2020-02-08,5,Wonderful little Italian restaurant with tasty pizza and very friendly servers. Tony is the best! We all got pizza so next time I go back, I'll have to try their other entrees and appetizers.
2020-02-04,1,So it was a Saturday night, me and my bf walked in and place was packed. They told us that they have a table reserved for 4 people. Then another couple came so they decided to let go the promised reservation and gave us a table. This is BYOB restaurant and I wish I knew that before coming there. Ok not a big deal. We weren't hungry and just wanted to order couple of dishes so we can share. We've got an octopus salad and buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto pizza. Food was delicious, even though I honestly didn't see or taste a buffalo mozzarella. The sad part is that our dinner lasted for like less than 30 min. Food was served super fast, they didn't even give us a chance to enjoy our meal and atmosphere. They took a salad from us when we didn't finish it, no one asked. Since we didn't have a bottle of wine with us, they purposely rushed us so we can leave asap. Felt like a fast food place where you grab'n'go!
2020-02-02,5,Best Italian Restaurant ever in Hoboken New Jersey and maybe in all US. People friendly , professional service and Food really 100% Italian. Quality very high , they use ingredients fresh I can test. Prices reasonable. Look the
2020-02-02,4,Terrible first impression!!! (But great food and great service...eventually). I made a reservation a few days in advance for a large group on Saturday during peak hours. However, when we got to the restaurant (10 minutes before our reservation) all tables were full, with about 4 other groups already waiting for their tables. We later discovered that a few of them also had reservations for the same time...Long story short we were sat down 40 minutes after our scheduled time!Clearly someone dropped the ball here...it would have been fine to have them say "sorry we're full" or "we don't take reservations" or "your group is too large" when I first called but to have them take my name down and then stiff us at the door was frustrating!!! We were such a big party that going anywhere else at that time would be inconceivable, (minimum wait of 1.5 hours for other restaurants nearby) so we decided to wait...Thankfully we didn't have any plans afterwards.Once seated the waiter and manager were attentive hosts. Orders came out right away with no issues.The food:Pizza- Great, Neapolitan style. We got two for the table to share as an appetizer.  Pasta- (our group pretty much tried all) Fresh pasta, good sauces, would recommend the tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms and truffle oil. I give this place 4 stars because this may have just been an off day for the place and then food made up for the wait in the end.
2020-02-02,5,Top notch Italian restaurant in Hoboken. Service is great, BYOB, pastas are perfectly cooked with tons of flavor. Great date spot.
2020-02-01,2,Don't know about the place, but they delivered the worst pizza.
2020-01-16,5,We have ordered for delivery several times and always fast and wonderful! Definitely recommend the Veal Meatballs or the Short Rib Tagliatelle. Pizzas are tasty as well!!
2020-01-12,4,Since every other place in Hoboken was packed for dinner and I was getting hangry we decided to give this place a go. There was a 10ish minute wait for 4 of us at 7:45pm. The table was a little tight (this place is small!) but it was cozy and totally fine. I also freaken love BYOB spots so once Dominic (who I believe is the owner) uncorked the bottle, I was instantly feeling better. We had the buratta for an appetizer-so good. I ordered the eggplant rollatini (it was on special) for my entree, even though I think it was supposed to be an appetizer. It was so cheesy and good holy crap. My husband ordered pne of the meat pizzas and he really liked it. I tried the lobster special and homemade pasta. I had a tartufo in espresso for desert and also tried the tiramisu-both super delicious. This place is a really good spot to go for dinner!
2020-01-08,5,My friends and I had a large party of 16 people this past weekend for dinner. The staff was so accommodating and attentive. Food was amazing! The best fried calamari to start plus toasty bread and burrata. They were able to accommodate my allergy on the fly, and I didn't feel left out. Wood fired pizzas were some of the best I've had- pillowy crust, charred bits, so good. The pasta was perfectly al dente, delicious tomato sauce with sausage and eggplant, my friends had the ravioli and raved about it. Nutella calzone was a pleasant surprise for dessert! Pillowy crust and melty warm Nutella filling, not too sweet and not heavy- so delicious! Amazing meal all around, so hospitable and accommodating for our large group!
2020-01-04,5,Very good pizza. Italiano style dough, tomato sauce seems to be fresh and made by real tomatoes. Very good quality ingredients.
2019-12-28,5,Fantastic food and great energy! The staff was super friendly and helpful. The food was amazing and I will definitely be returning again.
2019-12-22,5,My go-to Italian food restaurant in Hoboken. Mostly because their creamy pastas are bomb. And tutta pesca is for special occasions... cough$ cough$.Who can't appreciate a good BYOB!
2019-12-17,5,Byob. Great salads and pizza. Amazing ambience for a date. Not too noisy. I really love this place. Definitely my go to dinner spot in Hoboken. Prices are reasonable too.
2019-12-17,5,Oh my God, the food is so good! I love the buffalo mozzarella! I've had it in a burrata and on pizza and it's so divine. And the tomato sauce and dough with the pizza is just like so indulgent yet light at the same time! Pasta super fresh too. I had one with garlic and lots of sun-dried tomatoes as a special.Best Italian place in Hoboken, though I have not tried them all. Great BYOB too. Liquor store right down block.
2019-12-14,4,A classic Hoboken Italian joint. No complaints here. Food was great and would go back to try more menu items. Good veal, good branzino, good apps.
2019-12-14,1,Took over one hour to deliver two pizza and one pasta and meatball. Every thing is cold and saggy and pizza is burnt. Do not order take out from them eat in instead
2019-12-14,2,Definitely not a memorable meal or experience. The place is cute and nicely decorated. BYOB is a plus. However, the food and service was not good. 6 of us dined here and the only meal that was decent was the pappardelle pasta with truffles. Pizza was fine and burrata and meatball apps were good, but definitely have had better. Do not recommend any of the entrees we had - veal parm, eggplant, chicken Parm, and shrimp risotto. My dish came out 15 minutes later than everyone else and we had multiple issues with the bill.
2019-12-09,1,Horrible customer service. I came here with a group of 7 on Friday night and the wait staff could not be more rude. Because I was aware the restaurant is rather tight, we arrived at 5:45 before the dinner rush so we were not taking up a large majority of the restaurant. When we arrived we were the only ones in the restaurant, and the waiter still rolled his eyes and clearly did not want to seat a group that large.Once we were seated, we put in an order for 2 appetizers, 1 side dish and 4 pizzas to share only for the waiter to tell us that wasn't allowed. He told us they no longer allow parties to share, you must order one entree or one pizza per person. The pizzas are not personal, so ordering 7 pizzas plus appetizers would have been an egregious order. I understand the restaurant not wanting 7 people to share one pie, but we were ordering plenty of food to serve the group. Not to mention, the Burrata appetizer is more expensive than a margherita pizza, so I am not sure why that order would not suffice. The waiter was not willing to work with us, so needless to say we walked out. There are plenty of other restaurants in Hoboken that will allow you to share dishes within a group.We took a walk to Dozzinos and shared some appetizers and pizzas without a problem!As a fairly regular customer to zero, I was so upset that we had this experience. My roommates and I would go in and be treated like family by Gus, the best waiter. Gus was not there the night this occurred, which might explain the poor service. I used to recommend it to others, and go in for a pizza or pasta every few weeks and I am sad to say I will not be returning. Hoboken has other Italian restaurants that you will have a better experience at.
2019-11-19,1,I have eaten here 3 times and last Saturday I was rushed to order my dinner and was told by the waiter Johnny  that they need our table and you need to order your main course now. At the end as we were finishing our meals the waiter again said you have to leave now because we need you your table. I have never had a rude waiter that forced us out of the restaurant and would not recommend eating here. I was told by Johnny that the owner Domenico would call me and it's been 2 days and never heard from him. I was very upset and not happy the way we were treated. I will not be eating here anymore and will not recommend the restaurant to our friends.
2019-11-15,1,Don't bother making a reservation because they won't honor it. They have two open tables but refuse to seat us even though we have a reservation. The reason is because we have a party of two and the open tables are for party of fours. Would be a decent reason except for the fact that we made a reservation a week in advance.
2019-11-15,1,The service is so subpar. We ordered plain fries and the guy still put cheese on it. Said that he didn't know that we wanted it without cheese. Ordered a pizza to be lightly cooked and not burnt and it came out black. For this price the service needs a revamp from the ground up. Update: you can clearly see based on the owners response that they don't take any responsibility for errors and will always blame the customer. Avoid if you want good service.
2019-11-04,5,So good and fresh! Felt like I was at dinner at my Nonna's. The staff was so friendly, the atmosphere was cozy, and the food was literally the best Italian I've had in Hoboken. As a 1st generation Italian, it isn't something I say lightly. Everyone should go here now :) I've changed my tune and think you're missing out if you don't go. We had a Margherita, linguine with clams, penne melazane, and grilled octupus -- all were incredible!
2019-10-02,5,Wow how did we not come here sooner?   We have lived in Hoboken for nearly two years and just discovered our favorite restaurant in town!   My parents were visiting and we decided to try Zero Otto.   The atmosphere was great, the food amazing and the Zero Otto staff awesome!  Tony our server I have to say is the one of the best and incredible people I have ever met. What a great an amazing person.  From the moment we walked in he treated us like family and made us feel so welcome.  We had such a great time that we have eaten here 3 times in the past week and it has been equally as amazing if not better!
2019-09-29,5,Great place for some homemade and fresh pizza! Along with the other tasty items on the menu. Very Welcoming staff!
2019-09-20,4,The food was phenomenal. I've been looking for a place similar to Pizza Vita and I think I found it. We got the One with spicy soppressata. The service. However, was odd. We had a reservation, and upon walking in we saw two open tables outside for two. When we came in, I told him we had a reservation and he still tried to seat us inside even though I was like we have outside seating so....? And he was okay just wait until one is open. None of this made any sense. I waited for 10 minutes then I gave up and ordered to eat inside. I did not enjoy that.
2019-09-16,2,The owner / server is not only rude, he also lies. We had a big group with folks who had allergies so I asked if he will accommodate these restrictions and he said that he will do anything. But when we showed up, he refused to make any changes. Then he went and served others while we waited for 30 minutes to place the order. During this time we saw that he was rude to at least 3 other people in the restaurant,  accusing 2 of them of lying and then walking them out of the restaurant.  Some of the food was very good and other was average.
2019-09-11,1,Everyone who says the service SUCKS is 100% correct. The guy making the pizzas is a f***ing asshole, and the next time he stares me dead in the face when I ask him a question, I will reach over that counter and slap the sh*t out of him. Ordered from seamless twice here for pickup and both times this m'f-er stared me down like he was looking for a fight. Don't get it twisted; I'm a woman but I'll give him a fight if that's what he's looking for. So tired of these goddamn trendy joints in Hoboken where, even if the food is decent, the whole experienced is marred by shitty, rude, aggressive, nasty f***ing servers. F--- this place and f--- that little pizza-making, staring m'f-er.
2019-09-01,3,We had a mixed experience. Initially, we had to wait for really long for our orders to be taken. There were a couple of people who came after us, whose orders were taken before. I wasn't very happy with the vegetarian options. The menu that was presented to us was different from what we saw here: zeroottounopizza.com/ima... and apparently, we were told this is a take out menu. The pizza that I tasted fine but didn't wow me. It looked like it was made in a hurry by throwing in some artichokes, olives and mushrooms on a margarita. I was expecting better from a fine dine place.
2019-08-21,4,When Zero Otto Uno Cafe first opened on Washington Street, it just blended in with the neighboring shops and cafes on the block, but once it caught my eye, I grew curious.  My friend and I decided to try it for dinner one Saturday evening to see just how it stacked up against the other Italian restaurants in town.  I arrived first and was shocked to find that there were only 2 empty tables; I suppose I took its popularity for granted.  The manager was extremely unfriendly as he sat me at one of the small, cramped tables.  My friend soon arrived, and we proceeded to enjoy slices of tender, flavorful semolina bread.  I then ordered the Siciliana Insalate topped with Salmon for my main course.  The salad included mixed greens, orange wedges, red onion, sliced fennel, cured black olives, pinoli nuts, and extra virgin olive oil.  The hearty, Mediterranean ingredients paired well with the perfectly cooked wild salmon.  The fact that the fish was not farm-raised, as salmon usually is, was very much appreciated.  The complex salad was really delicious and satisfying.As our delightful meal was wrapping up, the manager grabbed a sauce-filled plate from the table behind us.  A spoon slipped off the dish and splattered tomato and olive oil all over my companion's jacket and scarf.  The manager proceeded to assure her that her outwear was unharmed, but she showed him some stains.  He rudely sighed and rolled his eyes, arguing with her that nothing had happened.  A neighboring diner jumped into the conversation to try and remind the man that the customer should always be correct.  After escalating the issue to the owners, they agreed to pay my friend's dry cleaning bill, for whatever that solution was worth.The food at Zero Otto Uno Cafe was phenomenal, but the service was so appalling that we did not think we would return.
2019-08-19,5,I got the meatball appetizer, pizza with mozz and prosciutto and the papardele with truffles and black shroomies. I've been to Otto Strada twice and this blew me away dish by dish.And i came in on a slow Monday. Definitely exploring this menu further
2019-08-14,4,This review is just for the delivery, not the dine in service.I placed an order for delivery.  I ordered the fiamma pizza (pizzas come in individual sizes).  My food was here in under 30 minutes.  It was also hot when it arrived.I don't like it when pizza is too greasy or when the crust is really thick.  Lucky for me, this wasn't the case at all.  The pizza was hot and covered in cheese and sauce.  The meat was thinly sliced, crispy, and salty.  The personal pizza has 4 slices.  I had 3 because I was too full to finish the entire pie.Overall the pizza was really good.  I have yet to dine in and to try more items on the menu.  But overall I was very happy with the food and the service and can't wait to dine in.I highly recommend if you're looking for quick pizza delivery that isn't too greasy.
2019-08-12,5,Best Italian restaurant!!! This is absolutely my favorite place for date nights! We come here every couple weeks for date nights, and look forward to it every time. Every single item we have had here has been phenomenal! The waiter Tony is our favorite; he's always happy, helpful, and funny! He's wonderful, as is the other staff we've interacted with. The meat and cheese board is a must, it's the best I've ever had (including the cheese boards I've had in Italy)! The buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto pizza is to die for as well. I can't say enough good things about this place! Thanks to Tony and the rest of the staff for producing such a wonderful meal and experience each and every time we come.
2019-08-12,5,Hands down the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken. My girlfriend and I have been coming here consistently for the last 6 months since moving to Hoboken, and both the service and food are unmatchable. A great choice for a BYOB (with a liquor store two store fronts down), it's the perfect combination of a social spot to hang out with outdoor/indoor seating options as well as an awesome dining experience. Every time we've visited, we always start with the Meat & Cheese board as an appetizer (10/10). Following this, we always choose a pasta dish and a pizza. We've tried countless things on the menu and everything has been impeccable. Tony has been our server every visit and has made us feel completely at home. He's incredibly attentive and does an excellent job providing menu recommendations. Highly recommend!
2019-08-01,5,Always a great dinner! Great vibes! - Rustic, exposed brick intimate Italian restaurant. Meatballs are our favorite. Pizza is amazing too. Friendly, attentive service. BYOB. Our go to spot in Hoboken.
2019-07-21,4,Another good pizza restaurant in Hudson County. A welcome addition. The pizza was delicious and the crust was perfect. Nicely charred with doughy bubbles at the edges! The meatball appetizer was also good. Very spicy. Service was very friendly. Just wish it were easier to park on Washington street! We came on a late weekday afternoon so we got lucky.
2019-07-17,1,I went to this place because of the "good reviews" what I found was: the pizza was so incredibly hot the cheese and sauce kept sliding off, it was bread with a dip on my plate of the cheese that fell. Waiter kept making "jokes" and got my order wrong then tried to blame it on me, kept asking if I'm sure I didn't order other item. Overpriced, no flavor, keep your money and go somewhere else. Good for people that want to bring their own bottle and hopefully the alcohol will make them forget about the terrible service and lack of taste of the food.
2019-07-04,5,Loved the whole experience. Convenient spot to meet friends in Hoboken. Super comfortable setting. Great service. Delicious food. Fun night out! Highly recommended
2019-06-27,5,I have no idea why this place was completely empty around 7pm on a week night because the food was reallt great. We absolutely loved the mussels app, as well as the salad and the veal chop parm we shared. Very high quality food and good service.
2019-06-21,5,Really quite delicious and authentic, coming from a person who rarely goes looking for Italian out (because I'm often disappointed).  I've enjoyed their delivery multiple times and the one time I ate at the restaurant.  I think the pastas win the day here- some of the best in town.  I've tried the pasta Amatriciana and the truffle pappardelle. The pizzas are delicious too, very thin crust but not stiff, and I love their Sicilian salad.  A great addition to town and the quality is worth a slightly higher price tag.  All the times we've ordered dinner around 6-630 it has arrived quickly.
2019-06-14,3,I've seen plenty of good reviews for Zero Otto Uno Cafe; however, unfortunately we did not have the best experience. The service was great... the food, not so much.  We ordered 2 pizzas, buratta, pulipo, 2 nonna salads and 3 entree specials.  The pizzas were bar pie size and soggy. The Pulipo was completely inedible. The best word I can think of at the moment to describe the dish is putrid. It was served and we immediately could smell it. We eat octopus and squid in many different types of preparations both cooked and raw; however, we my wife suggested we just try it before we say anything.  We both attempted to eat it simultaneously and almost instantaneously spit it into our napkins. The server came by and checked up on how everything was tasting and we notified him at that time, in a very polite manner, that we thought there dish was bad. He apologized but left it on the table. We had to cover it with a napkin as the strong fishy odor emanating from it kept wafting over my way and killing me. Finally after finishing our meal and they began to clear the table the server again asked how everything was and if we would like anything else. We said no thank you but wanted to make sure he had the chef smell/taste the pulipo because as coming from a family in the restaurant industry, feedback and criticism of all types is always welcomed... not to mention you don't want to be serving something bad to other patrons.  Candid feedback is always the best in my humble opinion.  The server appreciated the feedback and brought it to the chef's attention. As he approaches back with our check, he said the chef said that it's good and that the smell is normal as it's the way most octopus and squid is frozen and packed to be transported.   Although we didn't come out and ask, I guess they had no desire to remove the dish from our check.  You would think after we advised two times that we thought it was bad and the plate look untouched, they would have offered to remove it or at least apologize. Maybe even offer my children ice cream.  Nope. Nothing.  Poor management and customer sat. This was a first and last experience.
2019-06-09,5,Me and my wife try to find good restaurant around Hoboken university hospital because my baby was bone at there. When we enter, they just opened. We order margarita pizza, mussel, and fried seafoods. They serve their own bread which is like pizza dough. Taste is sooooooo amazing. Pizza, of course, is great because of it. You should try this place for pizza.Their service is great and fast. They keep watching our meal time. We really recommend this place.We will def come back.
2019-06-02,1,Pizza was a soupy mess, completely soggy. Service was horrible. Will never go back again.
2019-06-02,5,Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. Fortunately I was able to beat the crowds. Had the fried seafood platter and Margherita pizza. Delicious. The prices were reasonable and the quality of food was great. The service was stellar. The waitstaff was very accommodating and nice. BYOB is a plus. I would highly recommend.
2019-05-29,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. The staff is very friendly and helpful in offering suggestions, and when they aren't busy, they love to chat.  The owner is often present, and very nice as well.The pizza is the best in town, and I appreciate BYOB policy.Decor is simple, but elegant and when I dine solo, I am never rushed.
2019-05-27,5,This place has the best pizza and pasta. We order from this place fairly frequently. Love their veggie pizza and margharita pizza. Penn eggplant is a go-to as well. The sauce is amazing. If you're looking for a decent Italian place in Hoboken, this is the one.
2019-05-24,5,OMG This place...is the bomb! The food is outstanding. The service is super. Sitting outside on a nice spring day is priceless. The pizza dough is divine. You could make a dress out of this dough, it's so pliable. This pizza ruined me for all other pizzas. Oh and the Nutella calzone is out of this world. Love it and will be back next week!
2019-05-20,1,I've ordered food several times from these guys thru Grub Hub.Tonight I ordered a burrata salad. The burrata was sour. I called the restaurant to tell them this. The man who answered said that this could not be the case and HUNG UP ON ME. Will not be ordering from them again. Rude, rude, rude.
2019-05-11,1,I live in the neighborhood and have been to this place twice. I have returned BOTH the times without having a meal here. Why? Because the owner/server is very rude. I was offered a table by one of the servers, only to be asked by the owner to vacate the table which was then offered to someone else. Dining is not just about food. It is about experience and memories. I will never visit this place again. Rating: 0/5
2019-05-03,1,If I could give this place zero stars I would. Recently went to here to celebrate my cousins birthday. Lets be real, parking in Hoboken is a skilled game. 2 people out of our 8 person party were parking. The owner refused to give my cousin her reserved table because the entire party was not present. Mind you there was a large table available. Instead the genius  owner SPLIT UP our party onto two tables, two tables that could in no way be combined. 2 members of our party had to sit in a cubby hole and watch us conversant, we in turn shouted at them to include them in the conversation. A larger table was directly across from us, with no patrons. The owner was rude to my cousin and gave her an attitude about the table situation. To add insult to injury, the waiter ignored our tables, not even bread was given. When the tables attempted to order apps, they were told no ordering until the entire party arrived. Thanks for that assholes, cant order food and no bread for you while you wait! The worst part,  the large empty table across from us was filled with another party, and one member of that party was parking the car. however, the owner sat themall at the table, gave bread and allowed themto order without waiting for the missing member of their party. I was ready to flip my table over. And how nice, their party got to sit together for someones birthday. The waiter and owner for the rest of the evening was rude and extremely passive aggressive to our party. It was unacceptable, I will never return to this place.
2019-05-01,1,The worst all around. The waiter was creepily on top of us the whole time complete with death stares and kept coming over to ask if we were ready. I started to feel like this was some type of timed exam. Also he was beyond pushy, trying to bully us into ordering more. Literally said "our portions are small. You're not gona be full. You should get an app" after we ordered a seafood pasta and a pizza for two people. Didn't  know telling customers you give miserly portions was a selling point. Food was just fine nothing to write home about. Pasta was bland we both poured the whole pepper shaker into it. Not to mention, my dear boyfriend inexplicablely got explosive runs that night. We literally just ate what we already ordered and went to the restaurant next door for more apps. Never again
2019-04-28,5,Fantastic Salads, best Pasta in HobokenLove it
2019-04-15,3,When people say Hoboken is known for its Italian food, they weren't lying! Even my dad who only likes to eat Chinese food was into Zero Otto Uno, he cleaned every plate we ordered! Two stars off for the waitstaff's inflexibility to let us sit at the tables we wanted to sit at (we came with a reservation too!), they insisted on seating us right under the loud speaker and right next to a table of 6 very intoxicated girls. You can imagine the noise, and most parents don't like to scream when trying to make dinner conversations. Overall a decent meal, but I will think twice before returning.
2019-04-10,3,Came here on Sunday for a day date after walking around the city ... it's BYOB so we grabbed a bottle of red wine from next door ...there was a few guest inside but we had nice seating near the door ...... we order the fried seafood appetizer that listed calamari , shrimp and cod fish the order came out in about 10 mins and as the server is dropping it off I asked "where's the cod fish " he replied  "good question" and after poking around the plate with a clean fork (of course)  he says oh this my be a piece but it was clearly calamari :| cool no prob , "will you be bringing out the cod separately ?" He saids "no , hold on" walks away with the plate comes back ten minutes later with less calamari and three pieces of bite size cod fish ... comical , but tasty . *The time was than 6:45pm * Any who the assuming our entire orders are coming out soon we are on the edges of our seats with anticipation renaming the menu items we choose and plan on sharing , looking out the window at the beautiful sights , looking at the dishes coming out all around us ,we even joined in on the happy birthday song for the table across from us . Happy birthday mark lol Before you know it it's 7:13pm and we see what we hope is our pizza going into the oven ... and sure enough the pizza was pulled out and served to us by 7:20pm with the pasta dish accompanying it .... everything was absolutely delicious just not sure why it took so long and we were they last to eat in the restaurant even after the guest who arrived after ya but any who I'm willing to go back and have a better experience hopefully
2019-04-05,4,This place was overall a great experience! The meatball appetizer that we got was DELICIOUS. The pizza was very yummy as well, but I did find that the center of the pizza seemed slightly undercooked which could just be how they do it. I like a crispier pizza, but will visit again!
2019-04-05,5,I've been here twice, and both times were great. The 1st time, I had the pizza which is great. The owner (from Italy) made the pizza in a wood-burning oven so the pizza was authentic and delicious. The 2nd time, my husband and I each had pasta dishes (both were delicious and cooked to al dente perfection), and we shared a delicious appetizer (the burrata was great and so fresh) and dessert. The restaurant is a bit small, but it's cozy and comfortable while still being sleek and modern. The staff was very friendly and welcoming, the food was great, and the vibe was really nice. Also, it's a BYOB and there is no corkage fee, and that's always appreciated. We love this spot!
2019-03-30,5,Amazing food and Amazing service, I highly recommend this place! Nick, our server was so professional. He's the best! We had the prosciutto pizza and the penne something plus it's BYOB !! Perfect date night spot!
2019-03-22,4,Loved it first visit. Pizza is first rate among the best of the best neapolitans in NYC NNJ area although I think their crust is a bit crispy for neopolitian style - still great. Fantastic cheeses and Salumu and perfect hospitality. Also had goat milk ricotta cannoli - nice surprise and real true authentic southern Italian. Great place.
2019-03-16,2,This place is very unprofessional on taking reservations. I called them,they said they have table right now and I told them to hold the table for me cuz I was 10 mins away. And when we got there, there were no tables. We were the first group waiting and somehow they seated 2 other groups that came later. I'm not sure if they were being discriminative, but we left after waiting in cold wind for 20mins. Will never come back. Food was OK, I ordered delivery before. But come on it's Hoboken, we have other options for Italian food.
2019-03-10,2,Poor servers with slow kitchen. Had high hopes for this establishment but the service falls short of the prices they ask. I hope these reviews spark action because it has the quality of food (portions are ok) to be a staple in Hoboken. Also, I understand management needs to service x-amount of tables to turn a profit but being packed in like sardines does not lend itself to an enjoyable experience. Constant bumping of servers and other guests. Last - and most weird - Ariana Grande was on repeat for an hour. Not sure if I place this in the pro or con column. The table 4inches to our right had a good laugh with us.
2019-02-26,5,Went with young kids at 6pm and everything was fantastic. Had the caesar salad and eggplant appetizer and both were great. Their Caesar is much different than most places and portions were great. They were accommodating to kids and allowed them to stand at the bar and watch the pizzas be made and cooked (pizza takes under 3 mins) loved the authentic neopolitan thin light crust for the margharitta for the kids and the smoked Mutz and eggplant for us. Other families came in as well as a group lead by a native Italian who vouched for the quality as well. Didn't bYOB tonight but love that it's available.
2019-02-23,5,Great family time!  Delicious!  Great service!  Highly recommend. Get there early to snag a table. Kid friendly, too.
2019-02-22,5,Amazing! Great location. This was our first time in. We were immediately greeted by Oscar. He let us choose where we would like to sit. He made excellent recommendations. We started with a fresh green salad called Siciliana Insalate with endive, blood oranges, olives, and pine nuts. Delicious salad! Highly recommend. Great portion size too. Then we ordered two of the personalized brick oven pizzas. The margherita pizza and the prosciutto E bufala pizza. Prosciutto was fresh and delicious! Best in town. Basil was fresh. Crust folded perfectly and had amazing flavor. I believe they are 10" pies. Perfect size! The business is family owned from a father and his two sons who moved from Italy, which I LOVE. Authentic Italian food! Incredible! Tiramisu is made fresh daily we were told and we really wanted to try it but we were so full! We will definitely return to try more. I highly recommend this place for incredible Italian food!! Prices are great too.
2019-02-19,4,I was excited to try this place because I'd read a lot of good reviews.  In summary, the food has really good flavor and is superior to other "Italian" restaurants in town. I do think there are some atmospheric and menu issues that could be improved.The margarita pizza was very flavorful, but was a bit soggy in the middle.  And while the entrees were huge and delicious, we were disappointed they didn't come with a side of vegetables or pasta -- we literally had a huge hunk of meat on our plates which would have been complemented by a side.  We also tried the penne with eggplant and it was absolutely delicious, and the portion was perfect.The restaurant is small and the tables are literally 6 inches from each other.  This wasn't a real issue for us because the restaurant wasn't packed, but I could see how it could get really loud in there.  And finally, the waitstaff attentiveness could be improved - our waiter gave us our food but never came back to check on us. I'll return for the food, but I hope they work out some of the kinks. I'd love for this place to survive.
2019-02-17,5,We had Tagliatelle al RAGU di mango and Squid ink linguini. We loved it! The sauce of Ragu paste tasted very fresh with pretty good amount of meat. The Squid ink linguini was amazing!! The shrimps were so big! I thought they put eggs in the sauce but it's actually crab meats! Super tasty! The price was a little higher than average pastas but worthy!
2019-02-14,2,I will start off with the positives. This was probably the best Italian food I've had in Hoboken. Every dish was great. Had the buffalo mozzarella caprese appetizer, the nduja pizza, and the short rib ragu with tagliatelle. All very good. Here are the negatives. And mind you, I have never posted a negative review on yelp before, but felt obligated to tonight. I went on Valentine's Day, and it was very obvious that they were cramming people in to take advantage of the holiday rush. There was about 6 inches in between tables. The waiters couldn't even access some of the tables they had set up, and instead were yelling across the room to take orders and passing food in between and over the top of people. It was extremely uncomfortable and the people around me were noticeably agitated. To top it off, one customer who was leaving could barely squeeze in between my table and the one next to me, and knocked a full glass of red wine all over me. It was abundant to everyone around me that this was not the customer's fault, but rather whoever (the owner?) decided to pack this place as much as they did. I began to feel bad for the wait staff because it was so outrageously crammed and they could barely do their job. What a mess. It's unfortunate because I loved the food, but I will likely not return due to this being one of the worst and most uncomfortable dining experiences of my life.
2019-02-10,5,The place has nice ambience, good food and a very warm friendly service. Highly recommended for good hearty Italian food.Its a nice, cozy and warm restaurant with good ambience. The restaurant has brick walls with tungsten filament lamps giving a rustic modern look. The service was excellent, the waiting staff was very friendly and explained the dishes patiently. The food was really great with good portion size and reasonable pricing. The menu is vegetarian friendly with at least a couple of vegetarian options for each course and the deserts were to die for. The restaurant however doesn't serve alcohol and you can BYOB. Fun fact: there is a 7-11 around the corner from where you can pick something quick.Must tries are:Appetizer: Caprese Di Bufala (Caprese Salad)Pasta: Quadrati Con Ricotta E Spinaci (Spinach Ravioli with Lemon butter sauce)Pizza: Regina MargheritaDesserts: Tiramisu or Chocolate Hazelnut Cream
2019-02-04,5,This place is fabulous! The waiters are friendly, and the food is excellent! We always feel right at home from the moment we walk in the door. Definitely recommend but suggest making a reservation if dining on the weekend.
2019-02-04,5,If you want to try the authentic Neapolitan pizza, you must definitely try this one! I am from Naples, used to live in Manhattan for several years and recently moved to Hoboken. I tried many well known pizza restaurants in Manhattan and can tell you that this is the best pizza you can eat in NY and NJ! My favorite pizza is Fiamma, which is spicy. I also recommend Regina Margherita, Primavera, and Capricciosa. Deep fried calamari are super good! AllIngredients are clearly super fresh and all imported from Italy. Finally a piece of my hometown here in Hoboken!!!
2019-01-23,5,These guys know how to cook!!!  Such beautiful, delicate flavors from Italy. No, drug you with a pound of cheap melted cheese/oregano and call it Italian here. Staff excellent!
2019-01-06,5,BYOB, an amazing pizza and delicious pasta. Finalmente in Hoboken! Service is good and not overwhelming. We also ordered the delivery which was very well organized and the food arrived warm (in winter time!) and the delivery person was very polite (because it's very difficult to find my building). But pizza! Remember and trust me, I know the good pizza and this is the only place in Hoboken! Highly recommended!
2019-01-06,5,Very delicious food here! Warm vibe and excellent staff, our server Tony was fantastic. Menu has a great variety and has delicious seafood selections. Highly recommend. I have been to a few Italian restaurants in Hoboken and haven't really found anything that made me excited to come back for more but this was a great exception and can't wait to return.
2019-01-06,5,Fist time eating here and had an excellent dining experience. Our server Tony was the best and the food was out of this world. We ordered the Mozzarella in Carrozza, Squid ink linguini and Nduja pizza. Almost feels like we are back in Italy! Can't wait to try new things on the menus next time.
2019-01-05,5,By far one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. This is true, authentic Italian. The pizza is easily the best Neapolitan style I've had. The desserts constantly rotate and are all homemade. All the servers are extremely inviting and welcoming. Every time I go, it keeps getting better. And it's BYOB. Highly recommend!
2018-12-23,5,If your looking for authentic Neapolitan Italian pizza and dishes, then this is your destination. Amazing home cooked dishes reasonably priced with the at home family atmosphere. Domenick, the owner, a true restaurant connoisseur. Beautifully decorated and comfortable.
2018-12-23,5,Top Italian restaurant in hoboken! The food is phenomenal and the staff is very friendly and super accommodating! Highly recommend!
2018-12-22,5,Great Italian place in Hoboken. Had a delicious meat and cheese tray to start and shared two pasta entrees. Atmosphere was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful.
2018-12-21,4,I can't believe this place has been around for 7 months and I haven't stopped by! Popped in for lunch takeout and it was very quiet (but it is the Friday before a holiday so a lot of people leave town). I placed my order on Seamless and there was a $7 discount for first time orders here- score! So the $24 dish was mine for 17. I got the squid ink linguini upon many yelp recommendations. It was very good! I would definitely get it again, but also want to try the pizzas. My order was exactly on time and the waiter who helped me with my pickup was charming, with an Italian accent. I loved seeing the chunks of crab and lots of fresh garlic in the sauce, it felt super made to order. My order also came with a bunch of slices of fresh bread which was a nice bonus! Would definitely recommend.
2018-12-20,5,It was a rainy day and I came to Hoboken for my doctor's appointment. Me and my hubby was craving really good pizza and pasta so we did some yelp search. We came across this cute cozy place. We were perfect in time for their open hour. We order several dishes including margarita pizza and squid ink pasta, and etc. and I loved all of their dishes!!! They were absolutely delicious to the point where I just fell in love with this place! Their pizza dough is simply amazing, it is different from any other pizza in New York. Moreover, service is beyond expectation. Very attentive and friendly server. One more thing is that their homemade tiramisu is the best!! I will definitely come back soon! FYI, this place is byob so feel free to bring in your favorite wine!Thanks to Tony.
2018-12-18,5,Been there a number of times now. Food never disappoints. Definitely in the top 2 for Italian restaurants in Hoboken that you can 'walk in'.
2018-12-16,5,A gem in Hoboken! Truly excellent Italian food and great prices. We had the octupus, Vongole and Burrata. The service was amazing-Tony is the best!
2018-12-09,5,Fantastic BYOB Italian. Great pastas, pizza and main dishes. Reasonable prices. Guys straight from Naples. Been there 4 times since discovering it last month. As good as anything in Hoboken. Love it.
2018-12-06,5,Some of the best Italian food in Hoboken! Hands down, one of my top three favorite restaurants in Hoboken. When I first heard that a new Italian place was opening in Hoboken earlier this year, my initial gut reaction was "do we really need another?" But being a lover of burrata and Neapolitan pizza, I first gave it a try via delivery several months ago and immediately fell in love with the pizza. Then I once again had a craving for margherita pizza and did a pickup order. Walked into the place and knew I would need to come back and sit down for a meal there. Loved the ambiance and it seemed like a good date night spot.I also realized it was a BYOB spot, of which Hoboken does not have very many, so I got pretty excited about that. So, my husband and I went on a Friday night and we loved everything about the experience. The staff were friendly and we had great service. The food was delicious - fresh ingredients and most imported from Italy! We have quickly become regulars and went several weeks in a row after that night. We are on a first name basis with Antoine and are created with friendly faces by the rest of the staff whenever we go. Everything we've orders has been great - several of the different pizzas, different pasta dishes, salads and of course the burrata.Highly recommend! Definitely give it a try!
2018-12-01,5,I was extremely pleased with my first dining experience at Zero Otto Uno! The service was absolutely amazing. Throughout our meal multiple people were checking in on us making sure we had everything we needed. Tony had great recommendations for us and was extremely friendly an funny!The Della Casa is MUST order for an appetizer. It was a very large portion of buffalo served with roasted peppers and prosciutto. The veal and beef meatballs were no joke! We split the Genovese pizza, seafood pasta, and veal chop parmigiana. I would not hesitate to order any of them again.For dessert we ordered the Cannoli, Hazelnut Tartufo, and Pistachio Gelato. All three were excellent but the cannoli was one of the best I've ever had.  One of my new favorite restaurants in Hoboken and its BYOB!  I can't wait to come back!
2018-11-25,5,This is officially my new favorite place in Hoboken. After getting back from Italy a month ago, the food, & the great service brought us right back
2018-11-24,5,Went for the first time recently and I loved everything about the place! The atmosphere was warm and inviting. Everything we ordered was delicious: meat and cheese combo platter; octopus appetizer; meatball appetizer (melt in your mouth fresh, perfectly spiced); Buffalo mozzarella + prosciutto pizza (great crust; tomato sauce tasty but not overpowering); desserts (my layered chocolate gelato had a delightful crispiness). BYOB always welcome. Head guy Tony was super friendly, helpful, and funny. A+ all around! One thing I should point out -- if you're looking for "Italian American" food -- chicken parm, spaghetti + meatballs, etc. as I saw in someone's angry review -- this is NOT the place for you. This is authentic Italian cuisine, and my friend Giuseppe would know!
2018-11-16,5,Can't believe I'm saying this, but, my new favorite italian spot in Hoboken. I went two nights in a row because I literally dreamed about their pasta. I had their papardelle with truffle and mushrooms. Absolutely delicious. I've also tried 3 or 4 of their pizzas and they did not disappoint either. Highly recommend.
2018-11-11,5,Delicious restaurant amazing service feels like home. Eat here every Sunday for a reason !
2018-11-09,5,My husband and I are Italian food lovers and when we saw this place had open we gave it a try,it was so good we went 3 times in one week, needless to say we loved the food and the service.
2018-11-04,3,This place was packed when we went on a Saturday, so make sure you get in before 6pm if you're looking to eat here. Our experience started out great since the staff definitely tries to make sure you received enough attention at first. We ordered the combo cheese platter and honestly we think they probably have one of the best cheese boards in town. They are generous with the prosciutto and they have an amazing piccorini cheese with black truffle. Their jam is a little bit too sweet but still delicious. If you dip their bread in the honey they provide you, ugh! So good! Now here's where our experience starts to trail off. In addition to the cheese board, we ordered burrata, but we never got it. And we ended up getting charged for it as well. My partner checked the receipt after we had left and noticed we still got charged for it even though it never arrived at our table. Definitely our fault for not double-checking, but they could also. We ordered the squid ink linguini and the tagliatelle. I personally thought the squid ink was amazing (not what I ordered). The tagliatelle was good, but maybe not my style of pasta. We then ordered their pistacio custard  and that's to die for! I'm not a huge fan of pistacio flavored stuff, but that was amazing. We asked them to box our food, and they handed us the check almost immediately. The restaurant was getting packed so after waiting about 10 mins for our food, we decided to just leave because our seats were really close to our neighbors so it's difficult to get out and we decided we should just get a move one. We we're bummed about not getting our food back and then finding out we got charged for the burrata... If you like a good cheese board, check them out!!
2018-10-29,5,After my midterm at Stevens, I decided to stop by and see what this place has to offer. I must say this place blew me away completely.First, the service was phenomenal. Attentive, thoughtful and beyond respectful. Second, the decor is cozy, warm and very welcoming. But finally, the food! The food! It was amazing. I ordered a salad as a starter thinking I would get a minor leafy dish to open my appetite, and got not only a gigantic plate, but it was so flavorful and fresh that it made thank God I ordered this on a whim. The pizza is like the Gucci of pizza and I do not say that lightly.I will be back!!!!
2018-10-27,1,Service sucks ...!! I made a reservation for 7.30pm , did not get a table till around 8.15pm. When we were standing with kids inside the restaurant we were asked to go outside and it was cold. Later the guy who served us dropped the our food and did not apologize. We ordered vegetarian, we were served pork or whatever ..I agree mistakes happen but attitude.....we off-course felt insulted , our religious sentiments were hurt (especially after repeatedly mentioning and confirming even after the order arrived 'YOU SURE THIS IS VEGETARIAN" and it was assured it is vegetarian) .. post all this they did not apologize and were expecting a TIP.. weirdest experience ever
2018-10-18,5,Great little BYOB Italian spot! Our waiter (Oscar, I think) was so friendly and explained the menu to us, pointing out some of the faves. We had the pizza, a pasta special and the grilled fish entree. All good! Pasta was homemade and delicious! We were too full for dessert, so I'll have to go back to give it a try.
2018-10-14,5,The best pizza I have had out side of Italy! Simple but amazing menu every one needs to try this place. That's all I have to say but stupid yelp needs this to be longer for some dumb reason but what ever have the pizza it's amazing
2018-09-30,5,Thank you  Tony!!Amazing.How could this happen?? The best Italian food I've had outside of my cousin, Chef Riga's kitchen!!!
2018-09-26,4,My SF based son was in town on business and visiting friends in Hoboken and wanted to have dinner with us. He suggested a few places, I picked Zero Otto after checking Yelp.  Great find.Joseph, one of the owners (formerly of S. Egidio in Ridgewood) has fashioned a vibe and menu very similar to that at S. Egidio with a stylized wood burning Italian oven which cooks many of their offerings. Pizzas, pasta's, cured meat anti pasti and all sorts of small plates with bread olives and pesto excite the palate. It's BYO so do so to make the best of this trattoria style eatery.We ate the bufala caprese, pulpo in tomato sauce, pappardelle with black truffles and porcini, squid ink linguini, frito misto and a truffle pizza.The caprese salad was beautiful to look at and ate as good as it looked. The bufala mozzarella was authentic, with just a thin pellicle holding the cheese together. The pappardelle with truffles and porcini was BOMB! I love mushrooms so I'm a sucker for fungi -- and they were front and center in this dish -- with perfectly cooked pasta. Squid ink linguini was also very good -- the seafood served with was plentiful and fresh although I'm not sure linguini was the best vehicle -- A larger gauge pasta would have worked better for me.Get the pulpo! Octopus can be chewy but this preparation melts in your mouth and gets just enough acidity from the tomatoes and olives. Similarly delicious is the frito misto -- delicately fried with a killer sauce.I was a bit disappointed with our pizza. It was limp and chewy, but on the plus side, loaded with tasty truffles. The crust is not what I expected from Zero's Neapolitan wood burning oven. I mentioned this to Joseph the owner when leaving.  You expect some hiccups in new kitchens and told him so and left it there.Our server (Mario) was terrific all night long and overall the service and ambiance was stellar.This is authentic Italian trattoria dining in a bit of a cramped space -- but nicely fitted out. Worth a return trip for us and a look for those of you who like this sort of dining.
2018-09-17,2,Went here for dinner on a Friday night. Very busy and service was very very slow.  I appreciate not being rushed, but this was way too slow.  Our appetizer took forever, then 5 min after the appetizer arrived, they brought out my meal while we were still working on the appetizer.  THEN, they didn't bring out my husband's pizza for over 10min after I received my meal. Very disorganized and not acceptable service. We had the Polpette appetizer, it was tasty.  I ordered the Squid Ink Linguini - very fresh pasta and sauce, BUT I only received 3 shrimp and barely any crab meat. The shrimp were about the same quality as the frozen ones from grocery store, not fresh or tender. Charging $24 for what was basically a plain pasta meal is quite high for Hoboken.  My husband had the prosciutto e Bufala pizza, he liked it, said the dough was very thin and a bit soft but he likes it that way.  Overall, food good, prices a bit high on some meals and service was bad.  Disappointing b/c we live in the neighborhood.
2018-09-16,5,Amazing. I already went to Zero Otto Uno with friends 1month ago and I know that the food is really good . I think they getting better day by day  ,they are new so is normal have some bad reviews ,but I think there are some people that didn't understand the real Italian food for this they write something bad. My experiences was good so I decided to come back for  my husband birthday this weekend and I'm so glad I did. The greeting was super friendly from the moment we hit the doors. The place was very full but running very organized and efficient. The server was very informative about their specials which we ended up getting and we're not disappointed. The food was well-prepared presented just beautifully and We can honestly say that this is some of the best food you will ever have in NJ. The Pizza was delicious like the one I have had in Napoli last summer .We also ate truffles pasta ,burrata, octopus alla luciana and Tiramisù ,everything was delicious.The servings were generous we was full and had enough to take home and have some a little later. We will make it our business to visit ZERO OTTO UNO again because we feel in Italy of there.Thank you !!! Do yourself a huge favor and visit this establishment as soon as you can.
2018-09-16,5,Love this place!!! Been to Italy many times, and this place is really legit. Finally a good Italian restaurant in Hoboken.
2018-09-15,2,Great food with poor service!! The first time I went there, I felt may be the poor service was due to busy hours but the second time it was clear that the place treats different customers differently! Well be sure to ask for bread and oil because they surely do not serve all like I said!! I wish they read this and improve the service. Disappointed!!!
2018-09-14,4,After a long work week, I felt like I was worthy of a delicious Italian dinner which is what I got!  No shocker there are a lot of Italian restaurants in Hoboken but surprisingly only a handful serve fresh pasta.  As recommended by the server, I ordered the Tagliatelle which came with a delicious short rib ragu.  I would definitely come back for this dish. The sauce was so flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  We also got the Pugliese which was a burrata and truffle pizza.  The pizza was a little watery from the burrata and difficult to eat, but honestly you can put burrata and truffle on anything and it is amazing to me.  Also, I'm not normally a "crust eater" when it comes to pizza but the bread was so good, I couldn't leave the crust to waste.  For dessert we ordered nutella pizza which was filled to the max with nutella.  It would be perfect for the type of person that eats nutella out of the jar.  Personally, I would have liked maybe some bananas or strawberries in the dish to complement the nutella but for nutella purists out there, this is the perfect dish for you.Service was somewhat slow but we didn't mind since we had a bottle of wine to finish.  Also, this place is BYOB which is great since the items on the menu are a bit pricey.  Pastas and Pizzas were around $20+, maybe less for more basic items.
2018-09-07,5,So good! Great spot on Washington Street. Delicious food- can't say enough about the spinach ravioli. Tasted very fresh and authentic! Great place for dog watching!
2018-08-24,4,We went to dinner here about a month ago. Food was good. I had the rigatoni with eggplant. It tastes light and very fresh. Service was good as well.
2018-08-23,4,Really, really solid. BYOB! But thankfully there was a liquor store a block over, and no corking fee. Pizza and pasta were both delicious, as was the exceptionally good cannoli. Even the shell was above average! My dining companion loved her tiramisu, but it kept her up into the night so note the high caffeine content! Great job. Deserves more than 4 stars, but sadly I can't give it a 4.5 on Yelp...
2018-08-15,5,What what can I say if they say in Italian food I don't know what is it was unbelievable to put a shoot all mozzarella the Z all my Lord it was so good my wife was so happy my children were gone crazy I'll be back here real soon maybe even tomorrow thank you
2018-08-10,4,Italian food...what more could you want? Very intimate byob addition to Washington Street. I dined with a large group of friends and we decided to share a bunch of items so I was able to try a lot. Everything was delicious! The salads, the pastas, the pizzas, you can't go wrong with anything you order. I would recommend the hazelnut truffle for dessert, it was to die for and I was sad I had to share it with my girlfriends. This is a great date night spot with your significant other. I only took away one star based on the fact that it was a very tight for a large party. Before we left we spilled wine and broke a glass. No we're not clumsy, it was just super cramped for a party of 10+
2018-08-04,5,A new gem in Hoboken.  Amazing prosciutto, salad, pizza, ravioli, bronzino and...above all...SERVICE.  Also a BYO.   Topped off with amazing dessert.
2018-08-03,3,Very expensive for what it is. I ordered a pasta and a pizza and the total came to 50+ for really not that much food. They also got my delivery order wrong. The wrong order of pasta was good, but the pizza was low quality. So many better places in Hoboken.
2018-08-03,5,Best vegetarian pizza I've had anywhere. The pizza bases are thin, softer toward the center and crispier toward the crust. Delicious. The Quattro formaggio pizza was also very good. Friendly efficient service and a byob. Very reasonable pricing too. They gave us homemade bread to start with olive oil, it was so good I wanted to take some home.
2018-07-29,4,I thought this place had average written all over it but it actually had good food. Restaurant is a little small so you will be sitting close to other guests. Didnt do much to renovate other than add the pizza oven from the place it was before. Pretty straight forward decor. Ambience was not an italian place... not sure what it was since the music was like 90's pop.Overall, food was extremely surprising. The pizza was napolitan style. Light and flavorful. The pasta was cooked al dente and you could tell they have a passion for what they do. I will be back.
2018-07-28,4,A nice pizza spot in Hoboken, BYOB. The menu is definitely more than pizza, in fact a lot of items drew my attention. The wait staff was incredibly friendly and waited on us nicely; our wineglasses were never empty. One star off bc I wish the pizza was a bit more crispy in the center. Next time I will ask for well done.
2018-07-28,2,A few things:- Overpriced for the quality of the pizza ($24) and pasta ($18) and small pasta portion size, service was also *extremely* rushed. Not sure how this place has 4 stars. - The minute we got in the door we were rushed with ordering. Every other min the waitress came over to ask for our order when it wasn't even busy for a Friday - We ordered the Burratta for our appetizer and the Amal pizza (white pizza with truffle and quail egg) and Paccheri pasta dish for our entrees. Since we felt rushed we double checked with the waitress that we'd get the Burratta app first and she said yes of course- Legit 10 minutes after ordering, our pizza and pasta came out before we've even had a chance to finish our first glass of wine or enjoy the bread as a starter. The waitress comes over with the entrees and forgets we got the Burratta after we reminded her. She seemed very confused and responds by saying "sorry" but assumed we still want the Burratta. We told her at this point - no - because the rest of our food will be cold by the time we get so they take it off our check- The pizza (mind you, personal size and $24) was pretty gross and undercooked. When we received it, we told the food runner it's not ours bc it looked like a white pizza with regular mushrooms. There were large chunks of truffle (kind of strange) and the quail eggs were SCRAMBELED and the egg white was undercooked. The dough wasnt all cooked and you could still see the mozz strings from not being melted. It was very gross and super sloppy. Quail eggs are almost always sunny side up so this was a complete surprise that they were scrambled all over our pizza. Suspecting it wasn't quail but regular eggs.- After our waitress gave us our food, she never came to check on us for a solid 30 minutes or asked if we needed anything Bottom line, understanding they are still new, they definitely need to work on the service and not rushing customers (also noticed how quickly they were bringing the food out to other tables) and atleast offering a dessert or something on the house. Still very confused about the pizza with the scrambled quail eggs that were very undercooked. The pasta dish also wasn't anything to write home about.
2018-07-23,5,New place in Hoboken and BYOB. During a business lunch we started off with two great wood oven pizzas, followed by home made pastas we shared (meatballs, squid ink with shrimps and ravioli). As is this weren't enough calories the chef invited us to have some lemon cake, espresso on ice cream and of course cannoli. Excellent from A to Z - we will be back soon!
2018-07-22,4,A very decent Italian restaurant in Hoboken. The food is very fresh and authentic as per my taste buds. The only thing I found very discomforting is the noise level. The acoustics of the restaurant affects the sound level. Whenever there is a table with people who are totally drunk and start to get having more loud conversations , it adds in a lot of noise and headache to the people in the room. Unfortunately, this might be very trivial issue and at the same time a very sensitive point of view. So , I would suggest to sit outside when the weather is friendly. Note: a BYOB only. No cocktails , beer or wine served.
2018-07-20,3,Pizza was great but the service and ambience left a lot to be desired. It was extremely loud inside (not their fault but next time I'd probably wait longer to be outside). Soon after my husband and I sat down we asked for water and ordered a $15 plate of prosciutto. Prosciutto never came, and the waiter brought empty glasses and only filled them with water about 15 minutes later when we asked again. When our pizza came we told him to forget the prosciutto order and he seemed confused ‍ But again, the pizza was awesome and I'd def give it another chance for that.
2018-07-19,1,I placed an order for a Margherita pizza, a salad, Mozzarella carozza & a pasta to feed 5 people. It took over an hour and 1/2 for the order to arrive (called twice to complain) and when it finally arrived everything was COLD. The pizza turned out to be a PERSONAL pie which was not stated on the menu, small slices to feed one person ($14.00). The mozzarella carozza was (2) small pieces but the worst was the $25.00 pasta which was basically a small tin container which I wouldn't even consider a half portion of pasta. Some I paid a total of $76.00 to feed one person, this place is a joke. Never again!!!
2018-07-15,5,Awesome restaurant, and just slightly edges out Otto Strada as my favorite Italian place in Hoboken. ZOU is BYOB, with plenty of seating and quick service. We started with one of the antipasta platters with prosciutto and mozzarella. This is BY FAR the best mozzarella I had while I lived in Hoboken. We followed this up with Tagliatelle al Ragu di Manzo and the Nduja Pizza, both of which were incredible. I'll be back every time I swing by Hoboken.
2018-07-13,5,Loved this place ! The Italian Food was great and decent pricing as well ! The owner is super sweet but some of the waiters are a bit slow. I actually do recommended this place to anyone who is looking for a casual/ great evening with friends :)
2018-07-12,5,I went here tonight with my boyfriend and friends tonight and it was delicious and authentic! We all ordered pizzas, veal, and salads and everything was fresh and tasted right out of Italy!
2018-07-08,2,Came here the other night with some friends to try out this little byob. I can't say anything bad about the service, they were attentive and kind but the food is extremely average and relatively pricey. We had a meatball appetizer, which was OK but pretty small for $14. We also split a Regina Margarita  $(18) personal pizza, which to be honest, was pretty bad. The entire bottom of the slices were saturated and slimy, which imo, is the worst way to have a pizza. All in all, definitely better pizza places around and I probably would not go back.
2018-07-02,3,Stopped by within the first month of it opening in town it was lunch time and the menu was limited not to mention we were served breadsticks on actual bread the drink menu is limited as well left us stuck between what we want and what to order the pizza was delicious was definitely overpriced $20 for a personal good but not amazing not worth the price shall visit another local spot again not returning
2018-07-01,5,Really good staff, neither too intrusive nor too dismissive, Brought our two year old and they handled it well. Ordered the pizza, met expectations. Nice to write a good review.
2018-06-28,1,Great authentic food but racist staff!Let me tell you why?We (I and my fiancee) tried this place twice and the same experience -We sat down, 10 mins past by, and no one asked for water. I am looking around and everyone has water who came after me. I have to call someone and ask for water.Server comes and ask " what you want?" We said, "We want XYZ appetizer" and give us 5 mins to go through the menu for main course.Server - "You have to order everything now! although we won't bring everything together"We - : "Ok! We will take Foo pasta and one  Foo Pizza"I look around and everyone is having complimentary bread to start with. I was sure, this isn't coming to our table. And guess what, It didn't. 10 mins later - entree, and appetizer is on the table. They certainly didn't like brown skin.15 mins later while we just finished our appetizer, Server - "Do you want me to pack things for you"We - "No, we are still working on it"And more happened. What I am trying to say is just great food doesn't make a restaurant special but the staff and experience makes it special too. Although, I really love this place but won't go ever again.
2018-06-25,4,Pretty solid Italian restaurant in Hoboken that wouldn't be too out of place in non-Little Italy Manhattan (that's a compliment). Easily walked in and got a table for two outside on a beautiful summer evening. Bread service came with complimentary cheese, prosciutto, and peppers, which was a nice touch and cut above what you usually find. We ordered the meatballs, bucatini amatriciana and some sort of pizza with spicy soppressata. The meatballs weren't my favorite as the texture was  a little too soft for my taste, but the sauce with ricotta cheese was fantastic. Bucatini was cooked al dente and the sauce was tasty (loved the speck); however, there was too much liquid as it was practically swimming in tomatoes. I didn't try the pizza that day as I was stuffed by the end of the meal, but the leftovers were delicious and I ate them throughout the week.For dessert, we split the tiramisu and cleaned the whole plate - highly recommended!No drinks as it's BYOB, but there's a liquor store nearby.
2018-06-23,5,Mi piace questo ristorante! Having had the chance to go to Italy several times in recent years has made me a much pickier eater of Italian food back home.  So happy to have found this place (via Yelp).  Super high quality ingredients with an owner who really cares about his place.The burrata was the best I've ever had outside of Italy.  Fresh pasta was totally delicious.  Steak special was on point.BYOB spot that I will be returning to; hopefully again and again.A must try.
2018-06-20,5,Tried this new Hoboken Italian - food is absoluty delicious!  - from tasty meatballs with excellent sauce, to a delectable vegetarian tanglier (antipasto), buffalo mozzarella margarita pizza (that was so good we almost ordered an extra to go) and ravioli and pappardelle with porcini mushrooms that left us wanting to come back tomorrow night - a must try!
2018-06-20,2,Ordered the Margherita Pizza. After waiting almost an hour, the delivery guy showed up with the wrong order. When he called them to tell them, they kept trying to get him to give me the wrong order to make up for it but I obviously didn't want it because it's not what I ordered. So I had to wait for the delivery guy to go back and return with the right order and I still ended up with the wrong drink. The pizza was good but it wasn't worth waiting an hour and a half.
2018-06-10,1,Very unwelcoming to my daughter and family from the waiter to the chef who could not accommodate the most simplest of orders. We asked for pasta with butter and cheese and they flat out refused to make it. My daughter has a very testy palate and it was the biggest turn off ever. I highly recommend you not go there and send them packing like most restaurants Who think think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Can't wait to see the for rent sign coming soon .
2018-06-09,5,This place is a welcome respite from the usual red sauced Italian joints in Hoboken.  In fact it wouldn't feel out of place in West Village, just so happens that Mamoun's is even next door.  However you are quickly reminded you are still in Hoboken when you walk out and sink knee-deep into potholes on Washingston St.Someone's grandmother may not be hand rolling pasta doughs in the kitchen, the food tastes authentic however, in a good contemporary way.  If you don't see the chef, he is probably around the corner smoking near the pet store.  Authenticity aside, when the pasta tastes this good, I wouldn't care if he was putting cement shoes on someone in the bathroom.  The young guy making pizza and slicing the salumi in front is equally as gifted.  He made my two takeout order pizzas in under 5 minutes and they were terrific.Even their fritto misto isn't a breaded mess.  This will be my Italian go-to in Hoboken from now on.
2018-06-08,5,This place was extremely busy on a Saturday night and we luckily snagged a table outside quick. Started out with the comp bread which was delish and quick wine service. We ordered the mozzarella en Carozza which was very good and came with two sauces : pesto and tomato sauce.   Devine! For the entree portion my husband and I split two pizzas -- a margherita and a fiamma.  Both very good.  I love the sauce you can taste the tomatoes! Delicious  Can't wait to come back. Make a reservation!
2018-06-03,5,Stumbled upon this place on a quiet Sunday. At first glance, I was apprehensive, especially since Hoboken is home to so many pizzerias and "Italian" joints. Nonetheless, the pizza craving won out, and I'm glad it did.The restaurant itself is on Washington St. in Hoboken, near 5th St. The decor was inviting in an intimate, romantic way, reminiscent more of an Italian restaurant than an Italian-American counterpart. I was seated fairly quickly and took a chance to look at the menu. Upon further observation, I got a clearer picture of what kind of food this place had. If you're looking for lush salads, homemade, Neapolitan style pizza, and assortments of meats, cheeses, and pasta, you've come to the right place. If you're looking for chicken parm, there are other places to choose from.I chose a Rustica Margherita pizza; a simple pie with tomato sauce, basil, buffalo mozzarella, Parmesan, and EVOO. The pizza itself came out quickly and hot. Taste-wise, it was quite delicious! The sauce was made with San Marzano tomatoes (a sign of authenticity), with a sweetness that wasn't too overpowering. The cheese had a good pull and was chewy, with a crust that was soft, but cooked thoroughly. I did add a little extra Parmesan, but to me, it was just as good regardless. Overall, would absolutely come back here again and strongly recommend this place for those looking for a true authentic Italian experience in Hoboken.
2018-05-29,5,I'm so glad I decided to try this place. My family is from Naples and it is very hard to find true Italian cuisine in this area. The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious! 5/5 stars! I will definitely be back!
2018-05-22,5,This place is great! Finally a good Neapolitan pizza place opens in hoboken. If you like Porta's pizza in JC you'll like this! Great job, welcome to the neighborhood! Plus its BYOB
2018-05-21,5,I have been waiting for a truly authentic Italian restaurant to come into Hoboken and this place hits the spot. Everything on the menu is authentic Napolitano cuisine. We had the Buratta, which was impeccable and fresh beyond my wildest dreams. The prosciutto melted in my mouth. We each got a pizza and it was perfetto. Thin, authentic, Napolitano pizza. The fresh mozzarella was delectable and the sauce, bellísima!I truly felt like I was back in Napoli. The family who owns it is from Salerno and spoke Italian with us.We had such an incredible experience. I could go back and eat a whole other pie. It was THAT good. My family is from Napoli and this food is exactly how it is in Italy. Enjoy.
2018-05-14,5,Awesome authentic Neapolitan pizza!!! Fresh ingredients attentive service. The place is a gem in Hoboken. We definitely coming back to try some more delicious pizza and typical Neapolitan food. Great job!!!
2018-05-12,5,Outstanding!Went last night for the first time. Had the Bronzino .. best I've had!Pizza was also very good!Place is definitely a keeper.
2018-05-11,2,Nice service but let's get something straight: this isn't Neapolitan pizza. It's a gas oven and the pizza is average at best. Good ambiance that is byob that strives to be more than just a red sauce joint. You want to be considered a great Neapolitan pizza place? Make a real, wood fired oven. Instead, you have just joined the long list of decent Hoboken pizza places.
2018-05-07,3,Just ordered tonight based on good reviews. The $18 pizza was the size of a personal pie and didn't even fill me and my bf. luckily we also got meatballs also. They were good, but not the best and not for the price. This place would prob be better to sit down and dine and not order. Having trouble finding good pizza in Hoboken.
2018-04-29,5,If it were in the city might have given it four stars but this is a badly-needed real Italian (as opposed to italian american) restaurant in Hoboken. True neapolitan pizza that is double zero flour San Marzano tomato Buffalo mozzarella simple very light probably will not deliver well but very tasty. Bucatini amatriciana was perfectly cooked good Al Dente bucatini and the sauce with pancetta was very well executed, maybe would have liked a littke more pepoeroncino. They achieved quite nice ambience for such a small space hope they keep it up, can't wait to try other dishes as well.
2018-04-28,5,Went there for lunch today have to say i finally found. Good Italian restaurant for me to recommend to family and friends. We got the prosciutto pizza and it was so light and delicious; the meatballs were delicious. The cheese selection from the chef was fantastic!! They had so many other menu item I was dying to try like the squid ink pasta but saving it for next week!! Great addition! The service was great as well!! The staff was very attentive. We had a baby with us and asked for a plastic cup which they didn't have but they went out and bought it from the near by 7-11 for us!! It was greatly appreciated!!
2018-04-28,5,Best meatballs EVER! The cheese plates was paired perfectly with honey and assorted nibbles. Pizza was heaven.
2018-04-27,5,FEEL in love with this place, BEST pizza in town. Finally we have a authentic Italian restaurant in Hoboken.
