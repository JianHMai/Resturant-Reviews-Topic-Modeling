2021-11-07,5,I went to Orale Mexican Kitchen late on a Saturday night with a few of my friends and boy this place did not disappoint. The interior is designed perfectly with a "Dia de los Muertos" vibe and it's definitely a good spot for a date night or boozy dinner with friends. I ordered the Enchilada Suizas and sauce was made to perfection. It had the perfect combination of creamyness and taste, where the cream doesn't overpower the natural taste of the sauce. Overall, I highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat.
2021-10-24,4,Stopped by Orale after spending the day in uptown Hoboken. We didn't have a reservation (highly recommend you make one in advance) but luckily there were seats at the bar and we were able to be seated within 15 minutes. I ordered the chicken tacos, it came with 2 tacos and a side of rice and beans. The tacos were bigger than regular street tacos and it tasted really good! I would recommend pouring a little bit of Orale's spiciest hot sauce on the tacos to give it a spicy kick. My boyfriend ordered the enchiladas suizas and that came with 2 enchiladas. We loved the creamy tomatillo sauce, probably my favorite part of the meal!
2021-10-18,3,The 3 types of guac dip are pretty good. The shrimp tacos are decent, a bit too plain for me. I did not like the barbecue beef. I did not like the enchiladas at all either. Otherwise, the drinks are pretty good, and it is quite a nice environment. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I just did not enjoy the food all that much.
2021-10-13,5,Orale rocks - we were fans of their Jersey City location, so when we wanted to dine out on a date night, we didn't waste any time before booking at Orale Hoboken when we saw it! The location is kinda on the northwest tip of Hoboken, which still made for a challenging parking situation (we circled the empty-looking block once) and waltzed in for our reservation via Resy. The place had that legit, festive and distinct Orale aesthetics and we were led to the side dining room with its own smaller but no-less-gorgeous bar, and sat in front of a wall of backlit Jarritos. We started with the Crab & Shrimp croquettes special appetizer the day which was tasty, but a bit cheaply-made because it had a few more grains of rice than I would've liked instead of being more packed with crabs. My wife and I were loyal fans of their street corn we once had on the side at their JC location, so we ordered Esquites Gratinee side, but it turned out to be not the creamy street corn we wanted, but more of a breaded-crunchy street corn. It was still delish though not as awesome as its creamy kin. For entree, we ordered Juan Wayne tacos and the Shrimp tacos. I'll say Juan Wayne was a home run. It had delectable COKE sauce and juicy meat. Shrimp taco was also highly recommended by the waiter, and was good, though paled to the Juan. I also enjoyed their Raspberry margarita which was a nice and strong compliment to the meal. Service was quite attentive despite the place being busy, and the place has just got the right vibes! We left quite satisfied and saw many diners outside along the street (they have a lot of outdoor tables - extending to the front of the next store) enjoying their food, esp. the monstrous, envy-inducing, Truffle Ribeye Burrito. Highly recommended! So bring your friends, families, or go for dinner dates!
2021-10-07,1,We have come here numerous times since we live a block away and regret it EVERY SINGLETIME. The drinks are weak and the food is so over priced that it's disturbing. $27 for a burrito that is mainly rice and tortilla. No thank you. $22 for 'vegan chimi' (which is just a vegan burrito). Literally just a fried tortilla with rice. No thank you. Save your money and your calories.
2021-09-29,5,This is one of the best Mexican spots I've been to. The service and food was amazing. Everyone was so friendly and hospitable. Answered every single question my guests and I had. The ambiance was also beautiful. The next time I visit Jersey, I'll have to come back to Oralé.
2021-09-22,5,There wasn't a thing here that I tried that I did not absolutely love. Even the shrimp ceviche was a little too spicy for my liking but I risked GI irritation for it. I also had the chicken tacos (2 per order) which were nicelyPlayed and full of yumminess! Don't even get me started on the drinks! Just go! You cannot lose with a menu, ambiance, and service like this!
2021-09-03,5,Stumbled across this place since I was hungry and in the area and I'm very happy I did. This is definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to. Our waiter, Sebastian S, was the best. He was very attentive and friendly. The margaritas (both on the rocks and frozen) were awesome, and the entrees were delicious. I will definitely be coming back. Highly recommend!
2021-08-31,5,I only went to Orale for drinks, but I really enjoyed this spot. They have indoor and outdoor seating during the summer so we opted to sit outside. Seating is along the sidewalk so if that's bothers you, you may want to sit inside. The drinks were really good and our waiter was knowledgeable on the drinks and the menu. He was patient and very attentive to our table. I tried one of the mezcal drinks and one of the mango tequila drinks and both were so good! I love a good refreshing cocktail. We nibbled on the guava and chips sampler, which I wasn't too impressed it, but it's okay. I just like regular guacamole - all the extra fixings weren't for me, but if you're into that, go for it. This place is great to check out with friends or a casual date.
2021-08-31,4,Came here for brunch a few months ago, really good experience and is the second time I was there.The food is very very good, though it does feel a little bit heavy. Great burritos, and I really enjoy their dessert.The service there all the times goes between good and great. There's always someone checking up on us in my personal experience, and there is never a problem.The aesthetic is really nice, especially when they open up the garage door/window. Definitely a nice place to eat.
2021-08-11,3,The decor in this restaurant is beautiful, artsy, fun, hip, and a bit of a "Dia de la muerte" themed. The drinks were nice and strong, always a plus. The food however was a bit disappointing. The carnita tacos were too chewy, and bland. The octopus app was rubbery and flavors were not well developed. The pot of seafood was way to spicy. There was even a guy in the bathroom having a full on sweat stroke from the spice. If you love picante dishes this is your spot. I would definitely come back here for some tequila tho, they have a whole tequila menu!
2021-07-31,4,First time at órale.   We tried coming here a few months back for dinner and the wait time was almost an hour.  We decided to skip the wait by making reservations this time and also going at 3pm on a Friday. Their Instagram posted a story that said they had happy hour with days/hours below (ie:1pm-5pm Friday/Saturday), so we went expecting happy hour, but was told it's only on thursdays.  They also don't open until 3pm on Fridays- which according to the insta story, they open at 1pm.  This was disappointing, but were ordering drinks either way.  The drinks are a little pricey but good.  We stuck to the margaritas here. They gave us complimentary queso and chips for starters.  Soooo good.  We ordered the octopus as a starter and had more fried veggies than octopus.  It was decent but would probably try something else next time.  For entrees, we ordered the shrimp tacos and steak burrito with truffle.  The shrimp taco serving was huge (5 tacos) and the flavor was a Smokey bbq flavor with a kick.  It also wasn't smothered in sauce so the taste of the shrimp was still present.  Would def order again.  If you like truffle, get the burrito.  It was soooo good.  It also wasn't packed with rice like your traditional burritos. The steak was also cooked perfectly. They gave us a side of rice and beans to share with our entrees.  This was one of the better rice and beans we have had. Everything was so fresh And flavorful. We will definitely come back here again. If you're looking for a good atmosphere, good drinks, and Mexican with a twist- this is the spot.
2021-07-31,4,After going to several Mexican restaurants in the area, this one takes the cake. They take traditional Mexican food and put a awesome twist on it. We decided to go really early (3pm), and it was empty which was great. The service was top notch and the drinks were so dang good. The queso dip was amazing, I could eat that everyday! The octopus I could of done without. It was very good but just not enough. My gf ordered the shrimp tacos and they came in five!! Well worth the price, they were delicious. I had the truffle ribeye burrito, all I can say is....that was the best burrito I've ever had. It wasn't super filled with rice and beans like most burritos. They give you a healthy portion of steak and drench it in truffle cheese sauce. Honestly I can't wait to get back here to try some of the tacos. It was def worth the price!!!!
2021-07-30,1,They served old frozen chicken with my chicken tacos. The vegetarian dish was just beans and rice with avocado in a wrap and was bland.  The shrimp tacos, fish tacos were ok. The chicken enchiladas was decent. The guac platter was super small. Extremely overpriced for the quality of food served. Disappointed.
2021-07-27,3,We came in for Taco Tuesday, which should be 50% off their grossly overpriced $19 tacos if you pay in cash. I paid in cash and asked the waiter to reflect the discount on our receipt. He didn't give the discount in spite of me asking twice and then expected a larger tip.Otherwise, food is good quality. Seitan vegetarian tacos are very tasty if you top with salsa/sauce.
2021-07-18,4,We ordered frozen margaritas and nachos. It was good! Bartender is nice and overall nice service, will come back next time!
2021-07-16,5,Food was delicious. The charred was fantastic, cost a pretty penny but it was great. Andres the waiter was fantastic. Highly recommend!!
2021-07-12,2,Came here after going to the jersey city location a few years back. Chips came out a bit stale, definitely not fresh.Ordered the guac trio- nothing to rave about. Why would you put the guac which you have to scoop out in a small bowl that looks like a twisted triangle- who's genius idea was that??? Ceviche was ok but small portion for the price Blue corn toasted calamari looked better than it tasted- definitely nothing to rave about. Drinks were not good eitherFood and drinks not worth the $$ So discouraged we decided to grab dinner elsewhere. I mean if you can't get the appetizers right...
2021-07-05,5,This place was amazing!! The experience was excellent from beginning to end. The drinks, Guacamole everything was delicious.
2021-06-19,5,The service was amazing here, our server Mario was a delight to have as a server! And the food was fantastic! Will definitely be back to Orale!
2021-06-18,3,Ordered delivery. Food was prepared quick, fresh and packaged very well. The Sureño Taco was a bit dry, though a good amount of portion. The Puebla Cemita I Sandwich was huge too but again kinda dry and wasn't very flavorful. Both decent. Complementary sides came along were fries and rice and beans.
2021-06-17,5,That tacos are good and fulfilling but the drinks man  they are on a different level I enjoy the frozen drinks and it's typically a special flavor for the day it's never the same but taste delicious and has a kick 2 it! Two frozen drinks and your feeling it
2021-06-07,5,Excellent place! There's nothing we didn't like except maybe the $$.  But since everything was good it didn't hurt. Started with the  queso with warm tortilla chips, it was mild melted cheese and not like a saucy dip like some places. There were 3 different sauces for the table and the kind of flavors you could put on cardboard and it would still be delicious. My favorite was the cilantro one, which was the medium of the 3 sauces. Our cocktail was fantastic, too.For mains we had the enchiladas suiza and grilled chicken tacos on a flour tortilla. The tacos were extremely flavorful, with a balance of crunch and tanginess. The pico de Gallo added an extra element of flavor as well. The tacos came in a generous portion. As for the enchiladas, they were smothered in a creamy and delicious tomatillo sauce. The portions were perfect for us, and the chicken was cooked well. With our entrees, we received a small bowl of rice and beans, which was delicious as well.                                 Dessert did not disappoint either, we ordered the cookies and the tres leches cake. The cookies were served warm and soft, with a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top. It also came with some smooth vanilla ice cream. The presentation of   the cake was beautiful, and the cake was tasty but a tad dry. The place is beautiful aesthetically, and had a vibrant, artistic, and fun ambience. The front rooms were a bit loud, but the back rooms were quieter. Service was fast and friendly, and everything was served hot. Overall, Orale has great food and a fantastic environment. We'll definitely be coming back here.
2021-06-06,5,Came here for lunch and drinks on a Sunday and I was pleasantly surprised we were seated quickly. The host was helpful and accommodating in offering seating at the bar or table. We were promptly greeted by the bartender and given a great suggestion of a frozen Guava Margarita (Sangria? --not sure on the name but it was delicious!!). The bartender was also helpful in ensuring we were able order Brunch Menu items before the time cutoff (greatly appreciated!)  We enjoyed the Guac Trio (House, Octopus and Pork Belly--highly recommend trying this assortment). We also enjoyed Breakfast Tacos and Shrimp Ceviche (great salsas on the side). I would definitely come back for the fun atmosphere and great food/drinks/service!
2021-06-05,4,Perfect vibe for a Saturday night in Hoboken. Wait staff was very attentive and had all the earmarks of a bar restaurant crowd. The Carolina Burrito was filling and just what was needed for the night. Will comeback again this time with a date!
2021-05-22,5,The staff and service was amazing and the food was great as well. I had the brisket tacos. As someone who lived in California this was solve of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Thank you to the staff who accommodated us on a busy night
2021-05-16,2,My gf brought me to Orale on a Saturday evening.  She had been there before and was excited to have me eat there as I had been wanting to eat Mexican food since I moved here from San Antonio, TX.  We had a reservation but showed up early and were sat quickly.  That was to be the end of good service, though.  It took a while for our waitress to come and give is the menu qr code and when I asked about getting some chips and salsa she said they just had Guacamole and chips, so I took that.  I later found out they had many kinds of guacamole I would have rathered had I been told.  I asked what was on top and she said a few beers including Corona so I ordered it, as well my gf ordered a skinny margarita with an extra shot of tequila.  She took 15 minutes to return with a can of Corona and a margarita with a shot if tequila on the side.  When we complained about how long it took and the fact that the beer was in a can (we still hadn't ordered any food) she just said, "I know, right?".  We decided to just get the check and leave.  Even though I said I didn't want the beer I was still charged and my gf's drink was $28!!  We talked to the manager that just threw his waitress under the bus but did comp our "meal".  My gf was super disappointed but we went to the Biergarten around the corner and had a really great time!
2021-05-10,5,Came here for Cinco De Mayo and this was one of my favorite dining experiences in Hoboken by far! Great decor, music, and atmosphere. Our server was a delight, so much fun, and really on top of his game for a busy holiday night at the restaurant! I was so impressed. Phenomenal margaritas and guacamole! Obsessed! Can't wait to come back here again.
2021-04-23,1,Orale used to be my favorite place! My father went in yesterday after a long day of work to grab a few drinks and beers. He was dressed in jeans his shirt from work. (He does construction). He said the behavior towards him was AWFUL. The person who sat him down told him well you had an hour to sit here because we have other people coming with a very nasty look. Then when he ordered his drink they took over ten minutes to bring a corona. He felt that because of the way he was dressed he was treated poorly. .No one should be treated poorly due to the way they are dressed. He said a couple came in all dolled up and were greatly nicely and told not to rush. I am so disappointed.
2021-03-21,1,Management was extremely Rude and nasty. Very loud music for a small restaurant. Not sure why someone would put club music so high in a Mexican restaurant.
2021-03-16,5,The piña colada tastes amazing. Their tacos seem a bit pricey but there are 6 tacos per order and they all taste delicious so it's worth the price. Great atmosphere, great food, great drinks. Highly recommended
2021-03-14,5,Dinner was amazing so decided to come for brunch and again was a hit everything was amazing order so much didn't even know what I ate lol but was just perfect the service is amazing deff coming back.
2021-03-13,3,Pretty tasty food.. the complimentary rice and beans although smelled and tasted like a pack of cigarettes which totally turned us off to the rest of our meal.
2021-03-07,2,I was surprised to see the small portions for everything we ordered (vegetarian tacos & enchiladas, guac truffle hot honey, yucca fries) and the lack of flavor in everything but the guac. There were literally 2 scoops of guac and 7 yucca fries. The sauces were great, so we just drowned the tacos, enchiladas, and fries in them. Otherwise it was a very dry meal, especially the tacos and fries. I would have been less disappointed if the prices matched the quality of the food, but we paid $120. Maybe the experience would have been better had we dined in...
2021-02-28,5,Orale has been one of my go to spots for years. I was so happy when the hoboken location opened! Great cocktails, great food and great service! The frozen margaritas and flautas with some chips and guacamole are my favorite options, but everything I've tried has been amazing!
2021-02-20,4,Portions were great. Elote was to-die-for; we ate it all up in all but five minutes. Their drinks were really great, too. They were following pandemic safety protocols. The staff was super friendly and inviting, all of them had a smile and were very welcoming. The atmosphere was exceptionally fun and vibrant- great spot for a night out!
2021-02-14,5,The steak burrito is amazing. I would bathe in the sauce. Dip everything in it! The chicken sandwich while not Mexican flared was so delish.
2021-02-14,5,We love this place.  Even with so many wonderful options in the area we keep coming back here. The food is just great.  Well executed and consistently outstanding.  The drinks here are great as well and love the ambience.  Winning combination!
2021-02-14,3,A few hits and misses... the ambiance is great. Love the dim lights, music and feel of the restaurant. Great for date nights or friends dinner. They also have delicious fun cocktails. The food on the other hand could have been better, the queso wasn't a true queso. It was like eating melted cheese that wasn't melted. It was almost solid and the cook and waiter didn't notice???   My chip broke every time I dipped in. For a Mexican restaurant you expect the guac to be amazing and it was just okay. Not the best food but at least the place was clean, and fun. I get Valentine's Day is always busy but a restaurant which is usually good really made a negative impression us last night. We will try it again just never in a busy holiday.
2021-02-12,1,I've given this place two chances and was disappointed both times. The first time I ordered the guac app and then tacos dinner. Both just ok, tacos not so great. My moms special burrito was pretty good but it was all wildly overpriced.Then, I visited again with a friend. We both ordered enchiladas. Typically, at a mexican restaurant, enchiladas are served with at least three and a side of rice and beans. This dish was two enchiladas, but was a good serving size for me as a small girl. However, the service was poor. Our waiter was M.I.A. for a solid while.. finally ordered another $17 wine from him (his recommendation .. go figure..).  Then, he drops the check as we're still starting our second drink. He then comes back and tells us that we only had an hour and a half on the table. There were at least six empty tables around us ... what? It's not like we weren't continuing to spend money. I thought that was SO rude but I did not say anything and figured I'd leave less than 25% tip. (I'm always leaving 25% or more in COVID times.) I get the bill, give credit cards, go to sign and then realize gratuity was already included. Isn't it illegal to include gratuity without explicitly stating that on the menu?! Anyway, signed and was out of there. Considered asking for a manager but did not bother, as I do not want to spend high prices on mediocre food anyway. Will not be returning and will surely spread the word not to go. For how empty they were on a Friday night, seems like other people have also had poor experiences.
2021-02-11,3,The place is much prettier than it tastes, just like the food. Loved all the decor and food presentation but everything lacked taste. The corn did not have enough chipotle Mayo. The fish tacos were extremely fishy, need more like or lemon and the cole slaw on top should have had chipotle Mayo on them . They didn't taste right. My sisters carnitas tacos were crunchy but needed seasoning . The guac was very limey and the desert did not wow me. There was no choice of holding on the spice, which should be an option for all foods. Not a fan !
2021-02-01,3,BOUJIE Mexican restaurant. Arrived for a 7:15pm reservation on a Saturday and was seated right away. The vibe was great. We wanted something lively and this place was it. Music was playing pretty loud, but when drinks started flowing it was def a good time. I had the house margarita which was really good. However, We felt rushed. Since we weren't ready to order after the server brought us our drinks, he stated "I'll be back to order your appetizer AND entre" as if we needed to get both orders in ASAP. There was a 1.5 hr table limit but we hadn't been sitting for more than 15 min. Anyways, food and appetizers arrived quickly (no surprise). My bf ordered a burger which he said was good. I had the 22$ shrimp tacos (2) which, for the price, were not that great. Came with a side of rice and beans which were good but overall the food didn't taste like authentic Mexican food. I guess the prices reflect the area which I understand, but I would have rather gone to a hole in the wall Mexican restaurant to get better Mexican food, better portions and better prices.
2021-01-19,3,3.5- my boyfriend and I went for date night and truly enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. The drinks were a 7.5/10. The food came out ridiculously fast and tasted delicious. It was a little pricey and we decided it wasn't completely worth the pretty penny. The churros are delicious, and my boyfriend really enjoyed his peking duck tacos.
2021-01-09,5,This place is amazing. From the decor to the music, from the Jarritos Wall to the Food. The margaritas are good just sucks that passion fruit flavoring is limited to a specific drink (I'm Dominican We love passion fruit and Tamarind lol) the dishes are amazing the Octopus appetizer with beet sauce mmmm the fish beer batter tacos man just pull up and have a Casa Migos Margarita with no Salt on the brim
2021-01-05,3,I've only been to the Orale Hoboken location a couple of times; I use to frequent the Jersey City location a lot more but since COVID I've been staying closer to home.  I recently came to the Hoboken location for their Taco Tuesday night and also on a Saturday night for  dinner.  You can make reservations via Resy.com however they do require a credit card for a $25 cancellation fee - even for same day reservations just hours before.On Tuesdays, they have 50% off certain tacos (excludes the more expensive ones like the duck, shrimp, etc) which brings in a decent crowd.  The only catch is you have to pay in cash - which is not advertised on their website or menu.  They really need to advertise this - unless they hope people won't have cash and won't be able to get the discount.  They also don't have an ATM in their restaurant.  I'm surprised they are still forcing people to pay cash in order to take advantage of a discount when the CDC recommends that restaurants use touchless payment methods as much as possible to help stop the spread of COVID-19.    I've had the fish and carnitas tacos.  You get 5 small tacos of each and it came with a shared bowl of rice & beans.  I thought both tacos were very good but I probably would only order them on Tuesdays since $19 for tacos is a bit steep.  I've also tried the duck tacos - they had a little bit too much soy sauce for me.  For starters, I've had their duck nachos which are very good and the Serrano marmalade guacamole - also good if you like a little kick.  They don't have a spicy margarita on their menu, but they'll make a decent one if you ask for it.  The frozen coquito they have now is also really good - although the bartender accidentally went overboard on the cinnamon when I ordered a second one.Overall, Orale is an okay restaurant.  The Hoboken location is pretty big inside so even with the reduced dining limits, you should be able to get a table.
2020-12-26,5,Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and beyond my expectations! This is not just an ordinary Mexican restaurant. Top of the line, with an amazing culinary flair! The quest is amazing!  The spicy margarita is everything! They do not skimp on the alcohol here. I ordered the shrimp ceviche and I absolutely enjoyed every bite. This place is fire and I'll definitely be back!
2020-12-22,5,Ok so I'm usually not a fan of mexican food overall but this place is great. I came here for a birthday dinner this past weekend and was pleasantly surprised. I always like to look at the menu ahead of time before I go anywhere so I was pleased to see that they did have a burger and steak option. COVID wise I felt like they did alright. There aren't temperature checks at the door but they do have everyone spaced out and separated with barriers. All of their staff are wearing masks the whole time and the tables and area were clean. Our waitress was very attentive to us and our table was clearly so quickly once we were done with our food. We ordered a lot of drinks (I got a mayimbe, YUM!) that they gave us a round of shots on the house! For food, we got the chicken flautas and pork belly bao buns. Like i said before i'm not a fan of mexican food but I have had flautas before so I was pretty satisfied with how they make theirs. A little spicy but overall good. For entree I had the Barrio Burger and my boyfriend had the tacos. The portions for tacos aren't huge so just keep that in mind but the burger was great. I wish I would've taken pictures but I'll def be coming here with my friends. Also, the music was AMAZING! Shoutout to the host for making sure the vibe was lit overall.
2020-12-18,5,Highly recommend this place. We had our dinner indoors, which we typically hesitate to do but with the weather outdoor dining was not possible. Thankfully, their layout and plastic barriers made us feel very safe, and their decor is really nice inside. We had the enchiladas and carne tacos, which were both excellent. Service was friendly and on point. We will definitely be back soon!
2020-12-13,3,This place was great for the vibe, the music, and the drinks. I wouldn't say that their Mexican food is authentic there is definitely a spin on it. However, if your looking to try some fun food this is a great place. We had their pork belly tacos, their duck nachos, their chicken tacos, and the guacamole. We definitely recommend the nachos and the wood fired chicken tacos! The staff was great as well. Definitely on their pricey side as well!
2020-11-27,1,I was very disappointed..I did many Uber eats here and the place looked amazing...I've been wanting to come here for ever...The only thing good here was the draft beer..I ordered duck tacos....they gave me 2 little pieces of duck and the rest just crunchy stuff that till this I don't know what it was...and it was not even that good..Chicken enchiladas were ehhh...guacamole was weak....nachos were just ok...paying 30 dollars for 2 little bad tasting tacos w barely any meat is insulting...I could make those tacos at home for 3 dollars..the sauces were no so authentic...the food overall did not seem so fresh...my friend that came w me also agreed...good atmosphere not so great food...can't believe you have to make reservations to eat here
2020-11-01,5,Delicious! Cocktails were amazing, service was great and the vibe with music was fun. Highly recommend the truffle burrito and duck confit nachos!
2020-10-25,5,This place is fantastic. We made a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday for outdoor dining about 5 days in advance. We were seated immediately close to a heater which was a nice touch for an October night. Sampled 3 guacamole's- all delicious and fresh. I would recommend the Serrano Marmalade one. Carne asada was cooked to perfection and their tacos were delicious. Everything is so fresh, including the cocktails. The menu is a little on the pricey side so I would recommend coming here for a more special evening out, not your regular taqueria. Overall a wonderful experience with friendly staff and great food and drinks.
2020-10-24,5,Awesome cocktails! Awesome appetizers! Awesome entrees! This place is always doing an amazing job! I brought my father there for the first time, he enjoyed the guacamole, margarita, tacos. Even during covid, this place is always on there game!
2020-10-18,3,Was there this past weekend for the first time since I usually frequent the JC locationThe place is in an odd location that can be missed if you don't frequent the area. It is nice inside and a perfect place for a date, dinner with friends etc. It is also a bit dark inside but the music and vibe is great! Upon sitting at the bar waiting for a friend, I ordered a regular margarita on the rocks. I noticed 2 small black things floating in my drink. I didn't want to make it obvious so I removed it with my straw and placed it on the coaster. After looking at it further I realized that it was actually 2 small gnats in my drink!! If it was a fruit flavored margarita I would have assumed it was pieces of fruit but this def wasn't the case. It's so dark in there that it's easy to go unnoticed if the drink was colored but with a regular margarita, which is light, you can notice things floating inside your glass Not sure if they were already inside the tequila bottle and came out while he poured it in my drink but I was pretty grossed out by itI didn't make a scene and quietly let them know I had bugs in my drinks and was skeptical to get another. They did replace it and it was fine but it makes me question the cleanliness of how they maintain open bottles of liquor Food is great but drinks, I would definitely inspect them all upon ordering if I return to that location
2020-10-13,5,Got the vegetarian taco and it was delicious. Food and service was A+ But where this place really shined is the COVID precautions that every.single.person there was taking. Can't tell you how many places I passed on bc people cooking or serving had masks off their face, or only over their mouth - with their nose hanging out. (I wouldnt stop for to-go or dine in either way).I know it's not easy, y'all. Thank you so much for hanging in there and being caring and responsible with  COVID protocols. It makes people like me feel safe dining there.
2020-10-12,4,Huge improvement since the last time I came here. I ordered the 3 guacamole which was regular, spicy, and pork belly and it was all very tasty. I ordered the truffle steak burrito and it was super flavorful although I must say the sauce was an overkill. The sauce and burrito was delicious  but my burrito was dowered in sauce. I kept pushing the sauce to the side so the burrito wouldn't be soggy. My boyfriend ordered steak medium rare with fries and it was perfection.
2020-10-11,3,3.5...Mixed feelings, let me start off with all the things I liked. You can make a reservation prior on Resy, staff was accommodating and drinks are strong. We loved the guac/salsa and warm queso- chips were good and great to share! We didn't feel rushed at all, which I appreciated. We also ordered BORRACHO -(5) fried fish which was very salty (yikes) and CARNITAS - (5) crispy pork, very dry (double yikes)!  They don't allow you to mix and match tacos which is kinda a bummer. Tacos were just OK- not great at all. Maybe it was an off night? We were sad about it but I'd definitely go back and try other entrees or appetizers. Great vibes and atmosphere for girls night or a date spot as well!!
2020-10-10,1,Came here Saturday night I was sat outside around the corner next to a backed up sewer. Hostess and staff were aware of the smell and sat us by the smell. Asked over and over to be moved, clearly they  don't care about there patrons how can u enjoy your food without smell. I put my phone on with music and had a racist lady approach me because I had Spanish music on my phone. It was disturbing to her and she complained to management.  Never again! Beer Battered Fish Tacos.. this review was posted while I was waiting on bill. The server came over and confronted me about my yelp review. I felt shamed and it was unprofessional of him to demand an explanation. No freedom of speech allowed.
2020-10-08,5,The food was very delicious. The appetizers we ordered were the guacamole which was amazing, and the grilled octopus. We also ordered an array of tacos, vegetarian, grilled chicken and shrimp! Everyone loved their food. The atmosphere was a lot of fun, good music playing, it almost felt like a lounge! Overall great experience! Will definitely be coming back!
2020-10-06,4,This is a go-to place of mine and my friends because of the great vibes! The food is a bit expensive, but the taco tuesday specials make the tacos worth it (but cash only and only at the bar). The margaritas are strong and delicious. Big fan of the queso!
2020-09-27,5,Amazing amazing amazing!!! The beef tacos are the absolute best. I had the opportunity of going there last week and I loved there drinks.
2020-09-25,5,Orale mexican kitchen is one of our favorite spots in JC for mexican, so we wanted to try the Hoboken location. They had a great outdoor section out front, lots of tables. They had a special spicy watermelon margarita on the menu, so of course we ordered a ton of these. Didn't seem to be too strong, so that was my only complaint. For the table, we ordered the Serrano Marmalade guac (Serrano, lime & agave), which is great of you like sweet things. Also, the queso flameado which is a straight up go to app at a mexican restaurant. Both were very good, and both must orders. For entree, we ordered a ton of tacos. So much that our waiter hesitated when two people ordered this much. My favorite taco is the Machin (roasted bone marrow topped with crispy pork belly and shredded cabbage). It's very rich and a unique flavor profile. From what I've had, can't go wrong with any tacos. From the fish to barbacoa, all are delicious.No real difference between the two locations. Both spots have great food and ambiance. Top place for mexican for sure.
2020-09-22,5,The service was really great and the seating felt distanced enough to make it safe. The food was delicious and my drinks were fantastic!
2020-09-16,4,Went on a Tuesday night. They have a taco tuesday deal if you pay with cash! Half off tacos (except for the halibut, shrimp, and tuna). I tried their carnitas tacos that were like small pieces of chicharron (crispy pork belly) and ordered the Borracho (crispy beer battered fish) taco. Really liked the fish taco. The outdoor tables were spaced out enough. Good for smaller groups of 4 or less. Excellent service too. I'll definitely go back! Right next to the Gravity Vault Hobokeb so you can grab a celebratory drink after your climb sessions!
2020-09-12,5,I was an usual customer in JC, but this location is fantastic! Glad to see the same faces from JC and my amzing bartender now a Manager!Food is amazing same flavors just different location. Carnitas tacos are great with the lilCrunch of the pork and the skirt steak is like butter that melts in your mouth.
2020-09-12,5,I had heard how delicious the cocktails were here, and after finally trying this place, I am glad I did! As a group of 4, we all tried a different margarita with no complaints at all. I would like to try a different flavor next time because the menu had so many good options! The drinks came out at the same time as the food which was a little weird, but it was fast service. I love eating outdoors (especially in this climate) so it was fun to be at a picnic-style bench & table for dinner. The road is a little loud but nothing too bad that wouldn't make it worth going. I got the Carolina barbacoa tacos which had 5 small tacos and came with grilled pineapple and a very spicy sauce. If you're okay with spice, you must get these! My fiancé got an enchilada which was a smaller portion than expected but still delicious. He said he preferred my tacos. We also got the chips and guac which was good. Nothing special about the guacamole, but you can't go wrong with a classic. Definitely will be returning soon!
2020-09-11,4,Very cool vibe and great food! I would rate this place a little higher but I did find it pricy for tacos! Regardless, we plan to be back soon.
2020-09-08,4,My boyfriend has been RAVING about this place for months so today we WENT ! It's taco Tuesday so I was expecting pretty basic Mexican food but that's NOT what this place serves. The food was great & I tasted every ingredient. I rated his a 4 ONLY because my lobster dumpling appetizer was pretty cold when eating it. I would still recommend everyone to try this place for GREAT quality good for a reasonable price.
2020-08-28,5,This place was Amazing, Capital A! Started off with margaritas that hit the spot. My date and I ordered the lobster appetizer and was delicious. I went to order the halibut tacos and they were seasoned so well and was fabulous. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu items!
2020-08-27,4,I have been to Oralé so many times, whether for a substantial meal or just for chips and margaritas, and I always enjoy it.  In fact, even during these "post"-COVID days, I continue to stop there to relax outside with a cold beverage.  The restaurant actually seems to be the best I have experienced in terms of following the correct safety procedures, such as touch less menus, tables spaced 6 feet apart, plenty of hand sanitizer available, and a staff wearing proper PPE.On my recent visit, we started with a basket of tortilla chips, which they serve with a pico de gallo, rather than a more puréed salsa.  The pico included diced red onion, heirloom tomatoes, and hot peppers.  The chips had the ideal amount of crunch and salt, enabling them to stay firm when scooping up the wet, chunky dip.   I ordered the Wood-Grilled Chicken Tacos, which came as two giant wraps, rather then the 5 or so small tacos that seemed to be the form for the other varieties.  The Chicken Breast had been marinated with guajillo chilis and honey, creating a sweet and fiery glaze around the poultry.  I liked the addition of the white cabbage slaw topping for an extra crunch, which was an especially nice enhancement since I asked them to leave off the cheese that was typically included.Lastly, I paired the food with a Skinny Margarita.  While I often order their Mezcal Marg, I wanted something a bit less sweet on this visit, and the Skinny version did not disappoint.While the Oralé menu might not be extremely traditional, it is very creative and offers a wide variety of options for every palate.  Their beverage list is no different.  This place is worth a visit!
2020-08-25,2,We went toward the end of the night food was good. They didn't offer us any seats that were available instead made us wait about 40 mins. They gave seat right away for 3 girls. So yea service was bad .
2020-08-19,3,I mean I liked this place but I was pretty disappointed about the food and drinks overall. Their overall ambience is very good. The food overall was just ok. It wasn't spectacular. Drinks were alright as well. Nothing special. Ambience is the best part of the restaurant.
2020-08-13,5,Orale is the best place for a great margarita and friendly service. The staff is impeccable and attentive. The food came out in a timely fashion and was delicious. The restaurant has a summer vacation vibe with its picnic tables and outdoor seating. Go visit the sidewalk playa!
2020-08-05,1,We were exploring the area and were excited to try a New Mexican restaurant. the vibe was fun, but unfortunately the food was just not really good a. Steak was chewey and poor quality for $32, lobster dumplings had virtually no lobster. Enchiladas were bland with what tasted like chicken from a can and tacos were sloppy, drippy and hard to eat. Very disappointing for a $200 meal for 5.
2020-07-31,3,The apps - grace and the queso. Wow oh we, I could eat it all day! They are incredible, the service is great, the drinks are delicious! The entrees need work -- the vegetarian tacos claimed to seitan -- it was tofu and marinated In soy -- extremely salty with no other flavor.  I have also had the enchiladas here and whatever sauce they use it's all pretty much Tabasco sauce - insanely spicy.
2020-07-02,5,love, love, love this place...perfection... and really nice people! It just got  so crowded, pre-Covid. Margaritas, guac, just everything was pretty great!
2020-06-17,2,Have always loved this place and have been there many times before COVID. Today was first time went with family after COVID. Be careful with the happy hour rates they show you on the menu and what you get charged before gobbling down those margaritas (that is bar only rate, well bars are not open so why mislead people by putting it in menu).The owner Alex (at least that is what he identified himself as) came down with attitude when asked for explanation. I understand restaurants are under pressure with the situation we are in, but attitude and being cocky doesn't help either. I'm sure there are folks like me who want to help businesses but your (Alex) attitude was big turn off.I was left disappointed with my family to re-think if I should ever visit again.
2020-06-11,4,i'm gonna start with shrimp taco . pickled red cabbage, perfectly cooked shrimp with tomatillo salsa. it has the greatest texture when u take a first bite and everything just comes together , it's really good . if i have to pick something bad .... ? there is none .. perfectly seasoned has the acidity, salty , spicy, sweet . 2 . pork bao buns this was my least favorite .it's an interesting dish . too sweet for my food preference . BUT shocking news i have put left overs in my fridge and .. it actually tasted better when it was cold ... weird ... 3. puebla cemita - this is something ! i never had sandwich like this  . this could be totally different experience if i ate this in the restaurant not by uber eats . thin sliced fried chicken gotten a bit harder when it arrived to my location but the flavor of the chicken is really great ! on the menu says "black label buttermilk brined and fried" no wonder why it has such a bold flavor . it comes with chili lime fries but again it could have been better if i had this when it was freshly made instead of my food sitting in the uber car for 10-15 min . cuz the fries were very soggy . didn't taste any chili lime flavor . this is a heavy heavy dish but delish! i def recommend this restaurant .
2020-05-14,5,The guys here are sooo nice super sweet! Energy great!! Go to beverages and delicious!!! When me and my partner went home with out "kit"the drink was amazing! During these times I recommend stopping here get a KIT AND GO HOME AND GET LIT !!! Can't wait to try there food!!!!!
2020-05-05,1,Order was canceled 30 minutes after confirmed, while waiting in a crowd of people during social distancing. Staff member was handing out mini tequila bottles to appease people on line, with no mask on. He was the only staff interaction we had and seemed to be juggling a lot. The restaurant opened on cinco de Mayo, Tuesday, for the week and was not ready for the demand on a holiday associated with the cuisine they serve. Poor preparation, experience for my first time ordering and no care shown for those in line. Terrible experience
2020-05-05,1,Terrible experience ordering during our first visit. We drove from North Bergen during an already crazy time, to wait in a crowd of people, not social distancing and some not with masks, to just get an email 30 minutes later that our order was canceled. What kind of practice is this? On the day you reopened for orders and on Cinco de Mayo? You put people at risk having them congregate in front of a window, to wait and hear for their names to be called. You could at least have consideration for your staff and patrons during this time.
2020-04-28,4,I haven't had the pleasure of eating here yet however, they serve some amazing coffee out of the the front. Really nice staff, coffee was exactly what I needed and you can order online. Thanks so much for being there I truly appreciate ya and you made my day!
2020-04-10,5,We come here twice week! Great staff and food. Awesome ambiance. Definitely recommend it
2020-04-08,5,We did "pandemic takeout" at Orale and start to finish the process was so easy.  They have a great pickup where you walk in, grab your bag and go.  The food was excellent.  Be sure to leave a huge tip!
2020-03-16,4,Orale is a very welcome addition to Hoboken, and I would consider it the best Mexican food in Hoboken. Their Taco Tuesday deal is excellent--50% off tacos! Their margaritas are also delicious, and we love their guacamole. Also the atmosphere is very cool and fun. An excellent option for a group or a date night.
2020-03-10,5,Such a fun and delicious birthday celebration! I chose the seitan tacos for my entree and the serving is huge , definitely Enough to spilt with someone else. We told the waitress is was my birthday and she brought out a huge sombrero and a candle in our churro order. Love this place!
2020-03-08,4,Been here now twice for taco Tuesday's.  Make sure to have cash to get special.  The two types I have ordered were both tasty and like come with rice and beans.  I like mine hot so happily used some of their hot sauces.   Place is big as has two areas each with own bar.  One in first room has been full both times but able to get a stool at other one.   The sangria was good and recommend getting the half carafe.
2020-03-06,1,Worst food you could ever taste. It's not even worth the money. The drinks taste awful. The service was bad. We didn't even finish eating and they took our plates away. Next morning I woke up with the worst stomachache. I would not recommend anyone to go here. You can find better tacos that actually taste like Mexican food somewhere else and much more affordable
2020-03-05,5,I recommend the guacamole sampler and octopus appetizer. Duck tacos are a great and they offer a wide selection of craft cocktails. Usually easy to get a seat and if busy can always sit at one of the bars.
2020-03-03,5,I've been here a good amount of times and recently, I took it to the next level and had my birthday party here! I had a large party of 16 people and they were so accommodating. They created a pre-fix menu for my friends and I, where there was definitely no shortage of food. We were all buzzed and stuffed by the end of our meal. Even when you come for a dinner with a friend, you're still going to leave Orale happy, full, and buzzed. The wait can be a bit long if you don't have a reservation, but it goes by pretty fast if you have a small party (4 people max). But overall, I LOVE this place and HIGHLY recommend it!
2020-02-29,4,Let's start at the top - I visited Orale Mexican Kitchen with a group of gal pals. Luckily we had a reservation, when they're filled to cap there's no knowing how long the wait can be. As a general practice especially with groups larger than 5 I'd suggest making a resy. If the whole group is not present, you must wait until everyone in your party is at the resturant to be seated. As we waited for some of my gal pals, we decided to grab a drink at the bar - drinks were served up strong and tasty.When the whole group was present we were seated upstairs (the restaurant is 3 levels - 2 levels of eating, 1 level of restrooms). The decor in this place is full of life - such vibrant colors and fun details were placed all along this building from inside out. We had a trio of guacamole to start (who knew there were different types) and then we each broke out into our own taco choices. Overall we had a great time here - the food was delicious, the drinks were strong, the service was great. I'd highly recommend it!The one downfall for me, is parking - there is none. It's street parking, but the location is in a very particular area where there isn't much of that either.
2020-02-17,3,The food at Orale is actually really, really good. I think it's a tad bit better at the Jersey City location, which opened first, but the Hobo spot is relatively new, so I'm assuming it'll perfect its dishes soon. I like the Jersey City one better for a few reasons. One (and this is hands down costing a full star) is the service. The service in Hoboken is extremely slow and it's the type of place you'll want to order two drinks at once because it takes that long for you to get your drink order. I hate when food comes out before drinks, but that happens here because the bar is busy. Very busy, especially on a Saturday night. They are good at maintaining availability somehow (better than JC location), but I think that's just because the space is better. If you happen to sit in the room with the bar you're in for a pretty noisy night and you have to yell to whoever is across the table from you. Also, there are couches in this room lining a few of the tables and you sink right into them - makes for a pretty horrible posture/eating experience and I was sadly affected by this this time around.Guac trio - always great. Really unique combos and is served fresh. Usually I have no complaints about the guac but on this particular evening it was hardly mashed and definitely on the firm side. Needless to say, chips were breaking. Definitely do get the pork belly bao buns. These are delicious and there is nothing to complain about here - all around great app. The pico de gallo comes with acidic fruit and tomatoes - very acidic so if you have acid reflux, stay away. Future husband was affected.Most of the dishes at both Orale locations are spicy, there's almost always a kick in any entree you order so I would just be sure to ask while ordering. I think this place could do well by adding the flames to the menu - I.e   = medium = mild, and so on.I ordered the salmon and my piece of fish was delicious this time.Drinks are always tasty here, but like I said, just slow to receive. I got one of the smoky marg ones - forget what it was called but it was quite refreshing. They can make any drink on the menu "skinny style," which I naturally love. = zero headaches tomorrow morning.Altogether the complaints in service and crowdedness and slouchy couch have to kick the fourth star for me. Hopefully things improve.Other nice touches? The candy bowl at the front which is always filled with stuff I like to munch on ahead of being seated (and after the meal) AND the ambience aka design here. Really cool, funky vibe.
2020-02-15,1,Went to this location thinking that the service and food would be just as good in the Jersey City location.  I was wrong the food and drink was horribles de the service was  just as bad . I definitely won't be back toThis location.
2020-02-09,3,Food is spicy and the margaritas are strong, but wow is this place "New Jersey" on a Saturday night. This spot could easily be like a Rosa Mexicana or Dos Caminos, but they kill that with the loud, dated (linkn park?), top 40 music. Orale could seriously be so much cooler, but the vibe was truly tacky and unhip -- not much different than any other dive bar in Hoboken. Disappointing!
2020-02-02,5,My friend and I went for Sunday brunch, really good.  Food was good, spicey choices of hot sauces.  Margaritas were delish.  The place itself is nice and casual and there was a Mariachi band playing, not too loud at all just perfect.  The bartender was super nice and made sure we were happy with our food choices.  I will definately return.
2020-01-28,3,The food is mediocre and not great. Beer battered fish tacos had barely any fish and just feels like an oil bomb in your stomach. The carne tacos were very oily as well and felt greasy. Yuca fries were good and so was the guacamole but you will have better tacos at chipotle.
2020-01-24,4,I love this place.. the atmosphere is lovely and it's a big place. I've been here a few times with either friends or my boyfriend, and every time has been an overall great experience. The food is always good and so are the margaritas. They also have vegan options which is always a nice plus - especially when seitan is involved . Overall solid place with good food. If anything, I find it a tad expensive, but you're paying for the ambience.
2020-01-19,5,Accidentally dropped by while shopping in west elm next door , Awesum ambience with greatt choice of ccocktail and food, definitely coming Baal with more friends
2020-01-15,4,Came here for a late dinner with my husband one night and the place was fairly empty. Which was to be expected, I think it was a Monday night and we were having a hard time finding an open restaurant.   We got the pork buns, which were pretty tasty considering it's a Mexican restaurant. We also shared the Peking duck tacos and the queso. It was a genuinely tasty meal. Though we didn't get much, the service was rather slow. Which was a little weird considering there was us and maybe 2 other tables. But the food was delicious and the lack of other customers made it pretty romantic.   I would definitely like to come back for drinks and apps with friends. This feels like the kind of place, that on the right night, would be pretty fun and entertaining.
2020-01-12,4,Went here for a work party and would highly recommend... the service & food was great! All food was prepared with fresh ingredients and food was very appealing.
2020-01-11,3,Somewhat disappointed. From outside looked v cool. Ambience: Busy, crowded if sitting near the bar area, ie customers nearly sitting in your food at times. Bass seemed quite deep, lotta folks trying to talk at their tables but really shouting to be heard. Felt like they just wanted us out for next customers, handed check never asked whether we wanted anything else which I thought a tad rude.In general not so different to every other mediocre Hoboken restaurant, a town of culinary disappointments. Probably would've given it a 2.5 if available.
2020-01-10,3,I'm going to go ahead and say...overrated. Went on a Saturday night without reservations. We waiting in the non-existent lobby area which meant we were hovering over other diners waiting for our table. 45 minutes or so later we are given a table right next to the door (gee-thanks). Now the interesting thing about this is, you could hear other patrons come in, check in at the host stand (also) without a reservation and be seated before our table of two. So with all this waiting I was hoping to be blown away by amazing food. Nope. I wasn't. It was pedestrian at best. It felt like their food quality could not keep up with the volume. I prefer a more "traditional" take to Mexican food so doubt I'll give this place a second shot.
2020-01-05,5,After visiting their Jersey City location a few times, I was super pumped when Orale opened up in Hoboken around the block from my apartment! The vibe and decor are really cool, especially the lit Jarritos wall! The menu is definitely innovative compared to other traditional Mexican spots, but the food tastes authentic and is very good. We've come for brunch and dinner and have found ourselves eating at the bar more often than tables. The bartenders are super friendly and the cocktails and margaritas are bomb. We recently ordered bone marrow tacos and tuna tacos and they were phenomenal. They have an extensive guacamole list and good homemade sauces. My only wish is that they had salsa to pair with the guac. Fun for date night, family in town or large groups!
2019-12-29,4,Orale is a fun place!  Very nice decor. I don't think it's the most authentic Mexican food but it is a fun place and the fusion mexicanish food works. Would go back with a group.
2019-12-29,5,This place is great and perfect after rock climbing next-door! Service was fantastic, we sat at the bar and Alex was awesome. The only possible knock on the place, I would say is that the drinks are a bit overpriced. Granted we are in Hoboken so I understand the increased price, but still a bit high, even though the food was a pretty good valueChips app (several different guac flavors) - 5.0Fish tacos - 5.0Specialty drinks - 5.0We had something called an orange crush margarita I think? And this purplely drink pictured. Both were awesome but like I said above if they were a little less expensive this place would be literally the best restaurant I've ever been in
2019-12-28,5,I've been to this restaurant four times now and it's hands down my favorite Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. Great food and drinks. The service is always excellent. It's perfect for a family, or a date. I highly recommend the blood orange margaritas and the tuna tacos, but beware, the spice will knock your socks off!
2019-12-13,5,Loved our dinner here. The decor is vibrant, with colorful tiles on the tables, wall graffiti and a back-lit display of day-glow Mexican soda bottles. Happy, helpful wait staff. All the food tasted very fresh, and well-seasoned. We had enchiladas and tacos carnitas. Can't wait to go back. ($6 happy-hour margaritas too.)
2019-12-03,5,I went to Oracle for lunch on Black Friday with a few friends and my husband. It is a nice place for lunch with good atmosphere, great ambience and plenty of room to enjoy a meal with friends. I had the pork belly tacos which were fantastic and the grilled octopus which I though was okay as I prefer more char grilled octopus but my husband really enjoyed it. The service was great, the servers were very attentive and we were there for 5 hours and did not feel rushed.
2019-11-19,4,A nice mexican restaurant; slightly away from the hustle and bustle of hoboken downtown (which makes it easier to find parking). The decor is trying hard to be authentic baja style but does work on some level. The food here is great. They have limited vegetarian options but whatever they have is well made. I specially enjoyed the seitan tacos (which I do not like seitan). The vegetarian enchilada was good as well. We even got the guac tasting platter and the warm blue corn tortilla chips made it for me. Would come back again for the seitan tacos!
2019-11-16,4,Very friendly welcome! Amazing, edgy decor. Was pleasantly surprised to see they had a brunch menu. Ordered a huevos rancheros type dish and it was a bit small and came with a side salad. The guac was delish though! Would recommend.
2019-11-02,1,EDIT- I went for dinner with a friend for the all-day Thursday happy hour. The waitress suggested a few drink (we ordered 2 of her suggestions) and apparently they were NOT on happy hour (which we were not told). I called a few days later and spoke to a manager to complain about our experience. The manager Carlos listened but then lectured me about not telling the manager while we were in the restaurant. He was supposed to call me back 2 days later after he investigated but failed to do so. I followed up with him and APPARENTLY whoever is at the table has to order an entree each to get the happy hour. We BOTH ordered entrees and multiple sides and appetizers. This place is a scam and the manager Carlos is very defensive. Don't bother, go somewhere with real Mexican food that won't rip you off.
2019-11-02,3,The vibe inside is really cool, very spacious. The staff was extremely friendly and on top of it all. I had a sangria which was carbonated, very interesting it was still good. Ordered guacamole and chips which tasted the same as any other guacamole and chips. Me and my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it had bacon and arugula and other stuff and a little spicy sauce as well(if you think everything is spicy like me don't order!) the sandwich was ok. in my opinion the bacon threw me off. it came with a side of French fries which were delicious and rice and beans that were good as well. It was a very Americanized Mexico's restaurant but I want the authenticity!
2019-11-02,4,IF YOU LIKE SPICY FOOD YOU HAVE TO COME HEREFound it in the sponsored section on yelp so I decided to go with it. Looks like it has a great reputation. First thing u notice is how wel put together the place is. The jarritos lit up on the wall, the art on the wall and the bar is really cool. This is NOT the type of place u want to go to to get authentic Mexican food tho I will say. Don't judge it based on that. It's the type of place u want to bring friends and get apps and drinks after a long week or before doing something on a Saturday night. I really liked this place but I might have just gotten the wrong thing food wise. But the little things they do makes this place really great. They bring out their own spicy sauces for the chips before the food comes out and their signature sauce for the fries is incredible.
2019-10-27,5,Orale was the first place me and my brother-in-law ever went without my sister when we decided, after nearly a decade, we were going to take a stand against how long she takes to get ready and leave without her. Sometimes a girl and a dude gotta eat. It was at the bar, over the margarita du jour (we couldn't decide if it was peach or passion fruit but the details aren't important), he somehow went from chosen family to blood brother.Of course, we waited for my sister to actually eat. The meal was fab. She loves the bone marrow tacos and we like to get 3 different options and split them amongst us. I will say, I almost docked a point because they didn't call the guacamole with grilled octopus "guactopus." They really missed an opportunity there.
2019-10-21,4,The food is good, can't go wrong with the tacos here. Some of the appetizers and drinks are a little pricey for what you get. Sometimes there is a bit of a wait, but makes a good date spot.
2019-10-18,3,I went here a few months ago. Disclaimer - I'm gonna say that I am a tough critic of Mexican food only because I lived in southern California for 5 years and became spoiled there . And while I would say the food here was definitely  good and tasted fresh, I wouldn't consider it something that would satisfy my craving for "real" Mexican food because it has its own fancy spin on entrees with fusions of atypical ingredients and flavors,  and it's not like street food. Prices pretty standard for the area. It was a little too loud and packed in there for me, tables very close to each other and felt a little claustrophobic
2019-10-15,4,I have been to Both locations. Jersey City and Hoboken and both are equally great! Me and my friends are huge fans of the pork belly nachos and delicious tacos . We have also tried the octopus dish with potatoes as an appetizer option and different variety of guacamole ! Can't wait to go back for another fun weekend evening of great food and cocktails !
2019-10-09,5,Amazing! Came here for a quick stop Saturday brunch before heading to our Airbnb for the weekend. Service was initially slow though the place looked empty (the space is actually huge with 3 separate serving rooms. But once seating we were pleasantly surprised. Food was amazing, drinks amazing ambiance and decor was the best part. Even our vegan friend found something great to eat off the menu. The food is relatively cheap especially for the amount of food you get (some dishes can deffinately be shared). The drinks had a mixologist feel to them... Very creative and delicious. Great place for photos and open seating for great conversation. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would definately drive over from NYC to eat here again!
2019-10-08,3,I really dig the ambience. I like the food, but have honestly had better, cheaper Mexican that I wouldn't say this is my go-to spot. Don't totally understand their happy hour as it's a bit limiting - you can only enjoy it if you sit at the bar. Which is more so of a "first come, first serve" philosophy.
2019-09-26,5,I loved this restaurant. The food was tasty. I had the ceviche. Not what I was expecting but it turned out to be delicious. I recommend it! The sweet and sour guacamole was one of my favorites. And the guac with pork belly as well. The cheese skillet was great! The tacos and chicken bowl are up there too. I can't wait to go back to New Jersey to indulge in other menu items :)
2019-09-21,5,A group of us went to Orale on Friday night for my birthday. The staff, food, and service were all outstanding!  I could not have asked for a more accommodating group of servers. The bartenders were attentive and anticipated our drinks. The severs were prompt with delivering food and clearing plates. The tacos were outstanding. I can't recommend Orale enough to anyone who is looking for a great night out in Hoboken
2019-09-17,5,Very cute place, such a great atmosphere and some really amazing food. We tried the "tasting" of three different guacamole's (pork belly, regular, and octopus) and they were all amazing. I had the carnitas tacos and my mom had the barbacoa. Both amazing. Also, the fries are great! Overall a great experience and great service as well.
2019-09-15,5,We were in town for work & went to this Mexican restaurant last night...wow was I impressed! I've been to loads of Mexican restaurants from here to Acapulco & Orale is the best! The house specialty margaritas made with agave were amazing & as a group we ordered the right side of the menu to share. I sampled almost all of their fresh made, authentic, flavorful tacos and there wasn't one that I didn't love. I would highly recommend this place! Can't wait to go again!
2019-09-15,5,Checked out this establishment with co-workers.  Margaritas were on point (classic, smokey and mango were tops!) Started with the 5 Guacamole app- all the flavor choices were yummy! Esp the blue cheese!A wide variety of the tacos were the choice of the evening and we all tried tapas style. Very hip and trendy interior, a bit loud when busy but well worth the visit!
2019-09-06,3,If you're familiar with Orale on Grove street then this is their twin brother. Hip Mexican restaurant vibe with a menu full of classic Mexican dishes. Unique features include an entire menu section for those looking to add some flare to their guacamole experience. Fun fact: shortly after placing your food order you're presented with three small hot sauces each with its own varying degree of heat. Pros:Good date spotGood "Instagram worthy" backgrounds + platesHappy HourCons:Desserts are limited (no churros)Parking is trickyFar from Hoboken PATH station
2019-09-02,3,$14 cocktails in Hoboken is a bit absurd , this isn't the city.  Good ambience. Food is good NOT great.  Service is good. The thing that is absolutely absurd is that if two people order an entree and both come with rice and beans, they only serve ONE rice and beans per table. I've been to 500 Mexican restaurants in my lifetime and every single one of them serves the entree with rice and beans. NOT one place ever had a rule where it's one rice and beans per table.  Management needs to change this immediately! Typical bullshit baitand switch! Never will go there again!
2019-08-31,3,Decor and atmosphere here is super nice. The food is mediocre. I'd go back for the corn tortilla chips next time instead of any of the entrees I tried. I think I would probably like this place better if their prices matched the quality of their food. It doesn't.
2019-08-30,4,Good vibes, good drinks (get the Watermelon Margarita) and good service. What's not to like? I had the tuna tartare flatbread, yum! Enchilada Suiza for my entree, it was good. I will definitely be back to this place. Great for girls night or for a date.
2019-08-28,5,Super yum! Loved the decor and the service was outstanding!!!
2019-08-25,5,Orale is such a wonderful hidden gem! The entire experience from the ambiance, flavorful food to the excellent service. Russ the bartender was fantastic! He had a full bar and was equally attentive and accommodating to all the customers. His charm and professionalism is the main reason why my family and I will return, the place is lucky to have him! Also he makes the best margaritas of all time! Thank you for everything
2019-08-25,4,As someone who doesn't like Mexican food, I really enjoyed my meal here, I had skirt steak.  Fun spot in Hoboken, good service. Would definitely come back.
2019-08-23,1,Never again ... Eddie the waiter was the worst ... extremely the worse miserable waiter ever ... food was not fully cooked... my friend had a fly in her glass, she went and told him and he didn't even apologize or comp it... we had asked for a box so my other friend could take her leftover, that never came. Never got asked if we wanted dessert all he said was " are you done" wth ... never again
2019-08-23,2,Our daughter introduced us to Orale's for dinner. It is nicely decorated and the guacamole is very good (watch out for the red chunks in the Truffle Hot Honey guac ... they will knock you out of your chair!)  There are problems. Orale is extremely LOUD. The three of us had to yell to hear each other. I ordered a beer and liked it. When I ordered another one, the server said they ran out of it ... and she brought me a citrus beer that was undrinkable. Never have I left beer in my glass before!  It was horrid!  I ordered Chicken Fried Steak Tacos. Now ... I love chicken fried steak. You know, the best part is the sausage gravy. But, these tacos used the chicken fried steak AS the taco ... creative idea ... but so dry and tough ... and without the sausage gravy to give it greatness. It fell flat. My wife said the sangria was good. And the time spent with our daughter was priceless. But, Orale ... adios.
2019-08-17,5,We had dinner last night with our baby and they gave us a great seat so we had room for stroller.. Food was great and dessert was unreal .. Very nice people great service and food .. Place is on the money
2019-08-16,1,Before writing this review, have been to this place at least 4-5 times in both locations in last year -Grove street and Hoboken.  Have recommended to others and also been there with friends. Food and drinks good, however, the attitude and service a big "Zero." Recently went to Hoboken location and experienced the worst customer service. They jack up the drink prices in the final bill In spite of them recommending drinks from the all night Thursday happy hour specials. When asked the manager said the, "server must have told you that you've to buy an entree for the happy hour pricing on drinks and I trust my server not you." Even when there was an entree on the order, he refused to honor the prices. We just felt cheated at the overall experience.
2019-08-12,3,Yeah....no. Came here after driving past and noticing it always seemed busy so must be good and it had inviting decor.Service was good but food very ordinary. Tacos filled with some kind of pork sludge. Had to send fries back as they were burned and dry. For the price it wasn't worth it. Drinks expensive also.
2019-08-11,3,If you're looking for decent drinks, a lively atmosphere, and pricey, mediocre food, this is your spot. Service was very good and quick. My classic margarita on the rocks was tasty enough, and worth its $6 happy hour price. Guacamole was bland. I had the carne tacos, and a friend had the beer battered fish tacos. They were both just OK - 5 small tacos with skimpy filling. Nothing special. There are other much more authentic and reasonably priced Mexican spots in jersey city, where you'll get 3 large delicious stuffed tacos for $8 (Tres Chillitos & Taqueria Gloria) I'd go to Orale again if invited, but would not voluntarily return myself.
2019-08-07,2,It was a bit pricey for food that wasn't that great. The chips that came with the queso dip tasted stale and the dip tasted old kind of like they warmed it back up after they made it earlier in the day. Basically, it didn't taste fresh. The tacos were 1/2 off for taco Tuesday's deal, so that was a cute idea but not worth it. The only thing I enjoyed was the dessert- cookies and tequila infused gelato. I expected more since the restaurant is nice and in Hoboken. I did like how the staff thoroughly cleaned up each section of the restaurant as they were about to close for the evening.
2019-08-07,5,Loved our time here! We checked in earlier than our reservation time so we had a drink at the bar and the bartenders were super friendly! Also, love that you can add muddled serrano peppers to any drink - love spicy drinks especially with Mexican food! Our server was also so nice and patient with us as we took forever to decide what to eat. We got the nachos, and were surprised that they were able to substitute meat for seasoned seitan - it was delicious! The ambiance is really loud so you have to yell to have conversations, but as long as you're not expecting a quiet, peaceful dinner, this is a great place :) Can't wait to come back!
2019-07-30,3,I have to be honest, I'm not a fan of this place. Conceptually, it is perfect but the food isn't that great. I have eaten here twice and have felt sick after each time. It's also extremely loud. I'm bummed because it's around the corner from my apartment :(
2019-07-27,3,The place is pretty cool. Interesting atmosphere and a very hip place to go to with friends. Unfortunately the food is very disappointing. The guacamole was not only served in a tiny weird plate but it was very bland, nothing special. The queso was also super over done to the point of it not being enjoyable. No need to complicate a simple & delicious dish. Tacos were very ok. Can't really recommend any dish at this place.
2019-07-27,3,Food was honestly not super great. Pretty good but not great. Service was kinda slow, took a while to get more chips and water. Definitely overpriced. I think the up the prices because it's the only sort of "hip" Mexican in this area. Fun atmosphere though, seats, tables, napkins I liked a lot. Music was really loud which honestly I didn't mind. Added to the fun vibe but they should have a separate room more quiet.
2019-07-26,2,Pretty expensive and not really worth the hype in my opinion. The carne asada was good but the other items we ordered were ok at best and the chips that came with our "guacamole sampler" were cold. We had reservations and got seated in the almost empty back room of the restaurant. Overall, it was a lackluster experience for the high cost and I don't think i'd go back.
2019-07-25,5,My wife and I went here for our 20th anniversary, and we couldn't have made a better choice.  From the time we walked in the door, the host and manager were welcoming, quickly greeting us, and taking us to our table in the "Dead Room".  The server was exceptional, and we took his recommendations as we ordered.  Each time he was spot on.  From the food, to the drinks, to the ambiance, this place was 5 star.  To top it off, the manager came over to congratulate us on our anniversary, and when we left, thanked us (by name) for coming.  It is the simple things, like knowing someone's name, that will make this place successful for years to come.  Can't wait to bring our friends back and introduce them to Orale!!!
2019-07-24,2,Giving it two stars because the food was actually good. However the service was horrible. Our waitress kept hovering around and the whole meal felt rushed and awkward. While we were eating we could see her standing next to our table ready to take our plate even though they were full. Would definitely not return after the horrible service.
2019-07-23,4,Just a bar review - the bartenders were awesome. Super friendly & attentive. Prices are pretty high. Other than that the drinks were great. Unique tap selection for a Mexican place!
2019-07-20,5,Best Mexican I've had since moving to the east coast, right in Hoboken!  Started with guacamole tasting.  My wife liked the blue cheese.  I liked the octopus.  We had the barracho fish tacos and South Carolina barbecoa.  Both were fantastic. These are the best beer battered fish tacos since I left San Diego.  They also have unique house sauces.  These are not your average gringo sauces!  The elite margarita was generously poured and mixed perfectly.  Be sure to "add heat" - very tasty.  The service was polite, attentive  but not pushy.  Can't wait to to try more of their surprisingly diverse menu!
2019-07-20,4,Great food! Good service! Little loud and if you take cash on Tuesday's you get a discount.
2019-07-20,2,I was super excited to try Orale -- I've walked by this restaurant a handful of times where the vibrant decor and energetic atmosphere caught my attention.   Unfortunately, the decor is just a facade for the incredibly mediocre food and service.SERVICE.   Upon arriving, the hostess was unwelcoming.  We wanted to sit in the 'day of the dead room'.  She was being difficult as she said those tables were reserved (not surprisingly, those tables were still empty when we left).  In addition, we ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food as we watched other tables that were seated after us get their dishes before us.  FOOD.   We came here to try the tacos and the house guac.  All taco entrees come with 5 tacos with the exception of the wood grilled pollo (2 tacos).  The tacos also came with a side of rice and beans.- Guacamole Casa.  It's a small ice-cream-like scoop of guacamole.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  The dish needed additional seasoning.  Complimentary chips are given.- Carnitas Tacos.  Pork belly tacos were dry and had no flavor.- Borracho Tacos.  Beer battered fish tacos that had a strong kick of jalapeno.  This was probably the better dish out of everything we tried.  - Machin Tacos.  Pork belly and bone marrow tacos that were very average.  This was similar to the carnitas - pork belly was overcooked.ATMOSPHERE.  Beautiful.  The atmosphere is very energetic, however it is VERY loud with the music.  Loud to the point where you kinda need to shout over each other.Overall, Orale was not for me.  I would not recommend or return given the poor food and service.
2019-07-19,3,Super cute atmosphere but super overpriced and not great service. Don't even give chips and salsa on arrival! And guacomole is so small. Foods decent but not phenomenal. Such a shame cause it's a cute spot.
2019-07-18,5,Love their vegetarian tacos! Great atmosphere but it does get loud and crowded so make reservations to ensure you can get a table.
2019-07-17,3,I've been here twice and both times were ok experiences. Coming here for dinner at night is a little bit of a pain, the restaurant has very dim lighting so you're essentially eating in the dark. The happy hour is ok in theory but not enjoyable for most patrons. It's from 3 or 4-7pm during the week but only applies to the bar (which seats about 15 people combined), so if you're at a table be prepared to pay regular price for your drinks.  The Taco Tuesday special is half price tacos BUT only if you pay your ENTIRE bill in cash, so be sure to go to the bank before hand. Service was good the first visit, but the second time we felt really rushed (it went past quick service to chill can I enjoy my drink before you give me the check!) it really soured the experience for me. The food was their only savior! Grilled octopus and guac for the table(which is not complimentary, their tone will imply that it is) and I've had the tuna and beer battered fish, both tacos were good the tuna was better.
2019-07-14,4,My wife accidently found this place and we absolutely love it. We used to go to a dif place but Orale is so delish we return there over and over again.
2019-07-14,5,A Must Visit!! An eclectic and delicious menu with excellent service. Hands down one of the best in Hoboken. Highly recommend!
2019-07-14,5,Finding a restaurant that suits both vegans and meat eaters is tough to come by. This restaurant has killer options for both! To start, we were greeted by the manager who informed us we would need to wait about 15 minutes. This was no problem at all as it was a Saturday night. He kindly led us to the bar to get some drinks as we waited. The signature margarita was phenomenal! Every day there is a special frozen margarita flavor of the day. On the day I went it was a blackberry passionfruit. The employees were so friendly. I don't know if it's part of the job requirements but all the bartenders were extremely good looking, lol. My server was so nice!! They offer chips and guacamole as you wait for your food; upon informing my server that I had a severe avocado allergy, she immediately substituted fresh Pico de Gallo for the guac. The chips were so delicious I could've eaten them all day. For my second drink I tried something different that I ended up not liking at all. My server was SO kind and understanding and brought me the signature margarita I had loved earlier. For my entree, I ordered the vegetarian chipotle seitan tacos. It came with 5 small tacos (which were VERY filling!) and a side of rice and black beans for me and my boyfriend to share. The tacos were phenomenal!! I was in veggie girl heaven. My boyfriend got the barbacoa tacos and was just as in love as I was. I wish I could give this place 6 stars. Amazing food, drink, atmosphere, and staff. This is our new go-to date night spot in Hoboken!
2019-07-13,5,I would recommend this place for your friends, office party or just a cool hangout place which serves delicious nachos and they have best vegan options available. And I love the different guacamole tasting they offer. Frozen margaritas they offer are really good too!
2019-07-12,5,Orale was a wonderful addition to Hoboken! The decor is absolutely beautiful and the restaurant is very spacious - we had a party of 9 and fit perfectly (unlike some restaurants where seating is literally on top of one another!). The bar area has a nice open window, which is PERFECT for summer nights. The food and drinks are all fantastic - our group got a ton of apps and entrees and everyone enjoyed. One recommendation would be to ask for level of "spice" because one of the only complaints was some entrees were SUPER spicy.Last hint - the other location is in JC and sometimes the # to make reservations automatically brings you to that location. Make sure you ask which restaurant you're speaking to when you make reservations!
2019-07-10,4,Nice ambiance and spacious, not specialty on coffee though. Good alternative for brunch.
2019-07-03,4,Our neighborhood hangout!!  Great food and drinks. The margaritas pack a punch. The tuna in lettuce wraps was flavorful and tender. Everything is good. Will  definitely continue to patronize this place.
2019-07-03,4,I came with two other people and got the carnitas and the fish tacos on Taco Tuesday. For apps, we got the barbecue pork nachos and that was a great start. Each taco came with a set of 5  so we were stuffed by the end of the meal! For the price point on Tuesdays, it was a great deal!!
2019-07-01,4,Good restaurant great vibe. Apart from the food from the pictures we ordered pork bbq tacos and tuna on naan which were magnificent. I think they can do better at veggie enchiladas. But overall good experience
2019-06-30,5,Fabulous food and friendly staff.  You have try their specialty guacamole!  I had steak and it was fabulous.  The chicken is also very juicy.  Very healthy portions as well and fun ambiance.
2019-06-22,4,For happy hour on a taco Tuesday this is a great deal!Fab decor at a spacious restaurant with options to sit at tables the bar or in the windowGreat margaritas before 7pm at the bar for happy hour and half price tacos on Tuesday when you pay cashGreat, friendly staff
2019-06-14,5,This is my favorite place for Mexican food in New Jersey! This is really an upscale restaurant so come with those expectations.  If you've been to their location in jersey city you won't be disappointed; the service and food is very consistent. My wife and I come here often and have had many different menu items and drinks. The tacos mostly all come with 5 small taco wraps and the guacamole variations (as appetizers) are each equally amazing. We had the 3 guacs for $12 sample and it was a great choice, especially if you're sharing and allHave different tastes. We had the Serrano marmalade which was delicious and spicy along with two more savory options.  To drink we had the illegally aged (Smokey and sweet) and the Elite Margarita (she said it was delicious)! For dinner we had the tuna tacos and the bone marrow tacos. The Bone Marrow tacos were very unique but if you're a real carnivore I can't recommend them enough! To top it all off we had the bang cookies and "milk." Great dinner and great time!
2019-06-13,5,So glad that this Jersey City staple has finally made it to Hoboken! My boyfriend called ahead for availability for Sunday brunch and we figured that it would be best if we came as early as possible. Sure enough, it was empty.The Hoboken location has two rooms (one kid-friendly, the other adults only) but both are as bright and colorful as the JC location. We sat down in the adults-only room and ordered margaritas with one of their MANY tequilas. The drink was that perfect balance of sour, sweet and strong, a classic margarita. For food, we ended up ordering two dishes. He ordered breakfast tacos with a side of home fries, whereas I ordered huevos rancheros (this IS a Mexican restaurant after all). Service was attentive and very friendly, and the waitstaff was very transparent about pricing (no gotchas) and substitutions. First off, the food is decorated beautifully, regardless of what you get. Personally, I LOVED the huevos rancheros. They had a beautiful amount of heat, with richness and spice dancing on your tongue with each bite. The textures were complex, from the crisp fried leeks, the chunks of hominy, the soft arepa bottom in lieu of tortilla, the and creamy queso fresco.The mix of flavor was even better, moving from savory to spice to heat in the span of two bites. I had to stop myself from devouring the whole thing. My boyfriend also enjoyed his meal. The tacos were soft shell and made with fresh tortilla, the eggs were cooked perfectly and all the accoutrement paired well with each other. We were both impressed by the home fries, which were less like home fries and more like very thick-cut potato chips; crispy, with a touch of fluffy softness.A must-try in Hoboken, and worth the trek uptown!
2019-06-13,4,Great food and drinks in a cool atmosphere.Can get a little loud but def worth it!
2019-06-09,5,Excellent tacos, excellent service, nice atmosphere and very funky deco. I prefer this location to the crowded Jersey City location. Happy to have you in Hoboken now.
2019-06-08,5,Orale Hoboken is one of the best places in NJ. I'm the pickiest person alive but l can say they serve best vegan tacos and margaritas. Our server Lucas was great. Special thanks to him.
2019-06-04,4,The food is great. The drinks are okay. Tried a few but it wasn't up to its prices. But def visiting again. The designs are beautiful and the music is solid.
2019-06-02,5,I really liked the atmosphere and energy in this orale spot. The drinks were great. The wait staff was great. There was no wait when I got there, was immediately seated. The decor was beautiful and trendy. Only thing was that I felt that some of the food was lacking salt, but over all was still delicious.
2019-06-01,4,New restaurant in our neighboring township. We came for brunch.  They have frozen daily flavored margarita options. Today was pomegranate and mango which we got.  Weird that they tasted like regular lime margs but very good.  I got the heuvos Benito which was eggcellent.  My husband got the heuvos ranchero with arepas.  Food was awesome.  We ordered ceviche to start but it never came but the waiter gave us drinks for free since he failed.  Would definitely come back.  Love that it's on the outskirts of town and you don't have to go deep in and get lost with Uber expenses.
2019-05-31,5,Just writing this review because I read a bad review about the bartenders and felt it was not an accurate depiction. I've been here twice. Both times packed. Both times went to the bar to wait for a table and even while standing, within less than a minute, a bartender (bar inside to the left) came up to us to get us drinks ASAP. Nevermind that the food is amazinggggggggggggg! Love it here.
2019-05-29,5,Great ambiance, great food and EXCELLENT hospitality from both the wait staff and management. Bring cash for their 1/2 off Taco Tuesday deal and you won't regret it.
2019-05-28,2,Horrible Bloody Mary. Sub par huevos rancheros - don't like the arepa style carb they have. Service is mediocre. Felt very rushed the entire time.
2019-05-25,5,Great Mexican cuisine in Hoboken. Food, drinks and service are great. Best spot in the area. Great value as well
2019-05-22,5,Omg I love Oralé-- and I don't know what I love more: the vibes or the food! Every time I go here, my food is on point! I've had lunch, brunch, and dinner here. My favorites are the fish tacos (both versions), nachos, and THE FRIES. I know, I know.. a Mexican place shouldn't be known for their fries but honey, they hit. I've had two kinds: the chili lime fries, which are the best freaking idea, and the other fries that are made in beef tallow (I think?). Those are the best-- super tender, possibly double-fried, perfectly browned fries.Equally enjoyable here is the whole vibe. The decor is energetic, even on the Dead side; the staff is so friendly which is big for me because Hoboken is the least inclusive neighborhood I've roamed in (ugh); and the drinks are strong! It's a great place to hang out after work or on the weekends. It's cute and chill and in the afternoon and live & fun at night. This is a great place to get cute and hang out with girlfriends-- or after rock climbing next door which is my fav because it makes me feel like I've earned my meal!Thank you Oralé Hoboken for a great experience EVERY visit!
2019-05-19,2,Food is ok, but service at the bar sucks, bartender just pays attention if you get drunk and flirt with him. It takes forever to get food or drinks
2019-05-18,4,Amazing food and ambience! This is now my fav Mexican restaurant in Hoboken. Their guac is a must try, we tried 3 diff flavors and all were delicious. We also tried the chicken tacos and another chicken entree and they were pretty filling and yum! I will recommend this place for a date as well as a good family dinner!
2019-05-16,5,They were very accommodating to me and my party. The food was delicious, the guacamole, tacos and drinks were great. A little pricy BUT you get FIVE tacos in a serving. Decor and ambiance was also very enticing. I highly recommend if you're in the area
2019-05-15,2,Food is fine but the service is subpar... children are treated as a disease at this place -not sure why.  Staff should be more welcoming considering there is so much competition for similar cuisine in the area.
2019-05-12,5,Loved this place! I went with my friend to grab some tacos and some drinks a few months ago and the whole experience was great. We've been to the JC location before but I worked in Hoboken so we were just a few blocks away when this one opened up. There was a wait but they let us sit by the bar in the back and order food. The whole place was so spacious yet cozy with the fire place. We only had a few drinks, two shots and an order of tacos. The manager was very friendly & welcoming too. Chances are we'll be back!
2019-05-12,1,We made a reservation for Mother's day. It packed but that was expected. They seated is right away. The host and hostess was very polite and even took our wet umbrellas. The waiter was a jerk. I asked him about the steak and if it came with sauce as my daughter was picky and he obnoxiously said no but when it came it had sauce anyway and the steak was not seasoned. The flautas are mediocre and overcooked. The steak tacos were good according to my son and my husband had the burrito which was also good. The drinks were watered down and for the price very disappointed. I reccomend the Jersey City location. It is much better!
2019-05-05,5,My boyfriend and I always have the BEST time here! Eddie makes a top notch margarita too
2019-05-03,4,Good service. Place clean and fancy.The decorations of the place is very Mexican but also modern.Nice atmosphere to have a good time with friends or family. The place is very spacious so no time waiting to get a table.Waiters are very helpful. Food is ok but not the best flavor I ever had. There are cheaper Mexican restaurants not that fancy like this one with better food.However, I had a good time with my friends and that is all what it matters:)
2019-04-30,2,Feel like you are paying for the ambiance here.  Came for drinks and dinner one night with a group of girls. We ordered guac and then tacos - they come 5 to an order - too many. Wish I could have had the option to get 2/3. The carnitas were sliced up in to such small pieces that they were crispy and dry - not what I was expecting. Overall, great job decorating the restaurant, but the food is just ok.
2019-04-26,5,Great spot in Hoboken for great cocktails! I stopped by this location after watching a movie at the theatre nearby. I wish I knew sooner of this location. Definitely worth checking out the food and the selection of tequila and mezcal. The prices are great for the area. Staff was great and friendly! Definitely will go back and check out the food and more cocktails!
2019-04-24,5,I think I just found my favorite Mexican restaurant of all time! Orale has quirky "Day of the Dead" decor and a huge tequila selection. The restaurant is divided into two dining rooms: "live" for a la carte and "dead" for 21+ only. I've tried majority of the menu and I would highly recommend the below for your next visit: Guacamole: Bombero (4/5) - there's 11 types of guacamole but I would stick with the classic, Bombero (house special blend). Consider yourself lucky if you get a basket of warm chips! Don't forget to ask for the house hot sauces to add a little heat, the green is my favoriteCeviche Nano (4/5) - extremely fresh lobster and shrimp, however, the portion is a little sadTuna tacos (4/5) - forget the tortilla, these are wrapped in lettuce! Machin tacos (3.5/5) - these roasted bone marrow and crispy pork belly tacos are no joke, it's super rich and flavorful. It's also fun to eat because it's literally wrapped in bonesWood grilled carne asada (5/5) - HOLY SHIT. This is the one of the best steaks I've had! Can we also talk about the duck fat bacon Parmesan truffle fries? Please do yourself a favor and get this dish, your belly will thank you
2019-04-23,5,Very delicious and great vibes inside but very expensive.... $15 for a marg that is gone in two sips.
2019-04-21,3,I'm a tad bit disappointed, but I may have ordered the wrong dishes.Space and ambiance - Beautiful and definitely much better than the one in Jersey City. The dead room is gorgeous, but it's also the louder room. The live room transports you to Mexico (less fancy than the dead room) and reminds you of summer.Food - The guac and chips are delicious. Highly recommend! As for the entrees, neither the veggie tacos nor the tuna tartare flatbread were a hit with my friend and me. However, their protein-based tacos look more promising so I will give them a try next time. The flan was a pleasant surprise--portions are too large (in my opinion), but this would be great for couples!Perfect for - Happy Hour, Friday nights, casual dates, fun birthday celebrations
2019-04-21,5,Came here on a Wednesday night and it was packed! We sat at the bar. We ordered the following:- Queso Flameado: melted Oaxacan and chihuahua cheese in cast iron skillet with chips (excellent)- Flautas de res: crispy taquitos, beef tinga, salsa verde, chipotle orange, queso fresca and crema (good)- Barrio Burger - 2 4oz pat lafrieda dry aged burger patties, Serrano tartar sauce, chipotle aioli, pork belly, Marinated red onions and cheddar cheese served with hand cut beef fat garlic and parsley fries (AMAZING)The service is excellent. The burger however might have been one of the best I've ever had. So pop good and the fries were also fantastic. Why get a burger at a Mexican restaurant - because it's fantastic!!!
2019-04-20,4,Tried this place in a Thursday and it was packed . The ambiance is stellar: cool, sheik but not pretentious ( a bit noisy but expected) . Service was excellent and the food was very good as well as the spicy margs.  Tasty sauces , large portions and nice seasoning . We had the tuna lettuce tacos , nachos with guacamole,  amazing queso , and the filet was grilled to perfection . Only knock were the fires which were seasoned nicely but cold Overall and 4.5 - great find
2019-04-19,4,Trendy Hoboken restaurant bar. Service was very good especially considering how crowded and boisterous it was. Food was good. Not authentic Mexican but much better than most trendy Mexican restaurants. Wife had tacos. I had the enchiladas. Started with guacamole and grilled octopus. The enchiladas were quite good as was the octopus. Tacos were fine but nothing special. Had the tres leches for dessert. That was very good. The drinks were excellent.
2019-04-19,5,Food was great, service was good, drinks were awesome! Atmosphere cooler in jersey city, but food better at this location.
2019-04-17,1,Order chicken tacos and they tasted like they bought a pack of "taco" seasoning at shoprite and hoped it worked. It didn't. Doesn't taste authentic, taste like what Americans think Mexican food taste like. Do not plan on eating here again. Go across the street to Taqueria for real Mexican food.
2019-04-15,4,Orale is a fun new spot in Hoboken. It's a pretty big spot, in a kind of lonely spot of town. We got the guac trio sampler- and had casa, blue cheese, and the spicy honey. All were amazing, especially the blue cheese one. we also got the frozen margaritas with "added heat." Very delicious. For our entrees I got the vegetarian tacos, which were peppers and seitan. Very tasty but would have been nice to have some cheese or some sort of sauce in the tacos. I was adding hot sauce before every bite to add a little more flavor. My boyfriend got the fish tacos. We were pleasantly surprised by the portion size of 5 tacos per plate when we were expecting 3. Overall it was a good experience though quite pricey. The quality of the dishes and drinks were enough to warrant a return.
2019-04-09,4,This place was good. The service was great. The food tasted good.... But I won't ever go back. This place is not made for the people who can't handle their spice. Even the Mayo was spicy. Now again. The food was great. The guacamoles were amazing. The steak was better even two days later when I reheated it. The fish tacos were amazing. The queso was unbelievable. But you need to like spicy food. Highly recommended for those who like it hot.
2019-04-07,4,There's a lot to love about this restaurant. The decor. The staff. The drinks. However, the food gets a little more complicated. Started off with the house guac which was the perfect texture and filled with really good, perfectly ripe avocados. That said, the actually taste left me a little cold. I realize that guacamole in Mexico is a bit more subtle than what most people are used to but I think if it was a little more like, say, the Rosa Mexicana recipe it would prove a big hit. A little bit of layering of flavors. I then had the battered fish taco which were well presented and put together. The only thing is that for a beer battered fish, they were a little fishy. But overall, nice. My friend had the enchilada suiza which was fantastic. His black beans and yellow rice were also spot-on. The house salsas are fantastic.This place is a great addition to Hoboken and most Mexican restaurants here are far below the standard of this one. But with its cool LA vibe and ambitious menu, I think more is expected of Orale than the others.
2019-04-02,4,I give it 4 stars! Everything elwas BOMB! Dope decor! Ridiculous drinks ... MARGARITAS were BANGIN!!
2019-04-01,4,Great cocktails and loved the trio of guacamole dip. There was a lot of variety on the menu. Also, loved that the room in the back had a really pretty fireplace
2019-03-30,2,If you like Mexican food, stay away from this place. The location is beautiful and the service is great. However, the food is terrible. The food is overpriced and it is as Mexican as Pizza is Chineese. Also, I ordered a Michelada and the waiter informed me they didn't use Clamato in their micheladas. A michelada without Calamato is like a screwdriver without orange juice. And to make the experience more awful, I bit into a lobster shell that was in my guacamole. It was so hard I almost broke my tooth. They did offer me free dessert and I appreciated it. But I could've broken a tooth, swallowed the shell, or had an allergic reaction. Very irresponsible.
2019-03-30,4,Good happy hour spot! The happy hour is only at the bar or the outdoor seating area. We had the red sangria which wasn't too sweet. For appetizer we got the tuna on crackers with mango salsa. I think that had to be my favorite dish of the night! I honestly wasn't too crazy about the tacos. The chicken one was just ok and the pasta one was not too great. The service however was great! Our waitress checked in with us a good amount of times to make sure everything was good!
2019-03-29,2,Food was over priced.  Fish tacos were awful.  Steak tacos were just ok.  Drink specials were confusing as happy hour all night wasn't really happy hour.  Giving 2 stars because the staff was wonderful and the ambience was beautiful.
2019-03-27,5,Came here for drinks with a large group and the staff were SO kind and accommodating. Nothing but smiles and fabulous cocktails. Makes such a big difference when you're greeted with a smile from staff! Thanks for greats drinks and happy faces!
2019-03-23,1,Terrible. Went for a birthday.. food was good, waitress was good. Management SUCKED. Food came out cold and wasn't fresh. Definitely don't waste your time coming here.
2019-03-23,5,Food was excellent. Service was very good. A little loud and when I went quite full so good to make reservations ahead of time.
2019-03-21,5,Lovely place, amazing food, great ambience. What's more to ask for? I visited this place with my husband. We did not have a reservation so we ended up getting seated at a communal table. The place is huge. I mean really HUGE, given the size of restaurants/apartments in Hoboken. The food was definitely delicious. Had a good number of options. We went for chicken enchilada and a sandwich. Both was scrumptious and looked good. Will revisit soon to try other options.
2019-03-18,3,As a Mexican food AFICIONADO, I was so excited when Orale opening up near my house. I been here twice with my friends and after giving it a fair shot, I feel like this place is just ehhhh. I was so excited to try to guacamole samplers, but they weren't anything special, even the main house guacamole was just subpar. I was really hoping to love trying all these different guacs, but I just didn't. The first time I ordered the vegan enchilada and my second time the chicken enchilada. I was surprised to find out the enchiladas just come with 2 and no rice or beans- a bit off putting for a Mexican restaurant. The taste of both weren't bad, but not something I would ever crave or bring someone to try. Overall, this place is an overpriced, Boujee "mexican" spot. Don't get me wrong- I LOVE a boujee dinner, but I need it to have something special. There's nothing really special about this place. I gave it 3 stars for the amazing decor and great service. If you're looking for some truly great Mexican food with an equally nice ambiance- I recommend Charritos in Weehawken.
2019-03-17,1,Probably had the worst dining experience ever!!!  Let me first say that the food is amazing and the servers were very attentive. You are probably thinking what could be wrong then?  Let's start at the beginning... there were 6 of us, all adults, and we decided on an early dinner as our friends had an early flight to catch this morning.  The hostess sat us in the large dining room right in front of the fireplace. As we soon as we sat down, we started to hear a child shriek at the top of his lungs - and watched while his mother laughed at the sounds coming from her child!!! The other diners around them - who were actually friends of the family - the server said they had to split into 2 tables due to the size of their party - started to clap and scream across the tables to each other. We proceeded to ask the host if they could possibly move us to another table - by the opposite corner (again restaurant had many open tables). First they said the corner would be too tight to fit us?  It's a table for 6?  Then it was couldn't do it since it was reserved?  Then it was we can move you if you wait 30 min for another table - in a restaurant where there were many open tables!!!!  It was the worst decision as we should have just left the restaurant. The children at the other table proceeded to scream and shriek for the rest of the 90 minutes. You could see all of the other diners in the area flinching every time those children started running around screaming. The parents should be ashamed of themselves as this is not their own private home - this is a restaurant where people go to enjoy a meal!!I do put the restaurant at fault as they could have very easily asked the parents to not let their children run around the restaurant screaming. Or they could decided to put ADULTS WITHOUT CHILDREN in another part of the restaurant if they wanted to condone that behavior!!!
2019-03-15,2,I love Orale in Jersey City but this one has too much attitude because it's the hot new thang. We tried to reserve 3 hours before and told that we weren't allowed. When we showed up, we were told we had to wait 2 hours. We told them that we had tried to reserve and it didn't seem as if the maitre d' cared at all. Boo! The guys at the bar seemed friendly and served nice drinks - saving these guys from a one star rating. Sadly, I have to recommend that folks who want to have good Mexican should just go to Baja around the corner... or the Orale in Jersey City. Much less attitude. So much more pleasant an experience!
2019-03-09,4,Another Yelper said they wish they could give this place a 4.5 and I completely agree. It's a solid 4.5. Ambiance is perfect for a high energy date night or group of friends. Tacos were on point (5 tacos for $16 but the shredded beef they used had been marinated by the gods)!! The drinks were also rock solid--they have an extensive drinks menu featuring all the tequilas and margarita options you can want. I tasted my husband's marg and it was smooth, made with Milagros (my favorite). But strangely I was in a wine mood and the bartender was happy to let me taste test some wines before I settled for my glass of Malbec. Dessert options are fun too, as all the desserts are made for two servings. We had the tequila-infused vanilla ice cream with two double chocolate cookies from none other than Bang Cookies Bakery (I'm not sure who came up with the idea to incorporate cookies from the best cookie bakery in Jersey City but it was genius).Here's why it wasn't quite 5 stars for me: when I go to a mid-high end Mexican restaurant like this, I'm going to expect fresh chips and salsa to be available. Here the options were guac or pico de Gallo, with chips that were just alright. Would it have been so hard to have fresh, hot tortilla chips? Maybe this is another regional thing but fresh hot chips with some salsa would've really been the icing on the cake. Tip: if you're going on a Friday/Saturday night call ahead to make reservations! We had to wait 45 minutes just to get two spots at the bar. Again, it's a solid 4.5 place so plan accordingly and enjoy!
2019-03-08,3,Over priced and strange staff. My boyfriend and I went one evening. Food was pretty good, but not great compared to some of the awesome Mexican food you can get in Jersey City. It was extremely loud and dark in the restaurant. When it came to pay the waiter was extremely pushy trying to get us to pay with cash b/c on "thursdays only there is a discount on paying with cash"-it was extremely odd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2019-03-07,5,I love this place! Period! This is my go to place for food for drinks and just for a good time! Correction... great time! The ambience is just perfect and the food never disappoints. Anwar, the bartender is the bomb! He makes his own concoctions and I always end up loving every drink he comes up with. We love sitting at the bar thanks to him. Such great service! Finally a good place to hang out in Hoboken!
2019-03-07,4,Could be one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Literally like something you would find in New York City for the cocktails and menu. The restaurant is huge. Might be one of the largest in Hoboken, plus they have a back room that could easily seat 50 people. Food is outstanding, I tried the seared octopus, which was extremely fresh - I could cut it with my fork, I didn't need a knife - and but the portion size was just one tentacle. I kind of was hoping for more than just 1 tentacle, especially for $13.  Tried the salpicon tacos which were five soft tacos with cripsy halibut, maggi, lime, guac, chipolte aioli. I gobbled them up quickly. That was $23 for five small tacos. I was feeling hungry even after eating that, and considered ordering a second entree.Ordered the red sangria and the smoky Manhattan cocktail. Both were delicious and would order those again - or try something new. They have an extensive premium liquor list. The bartenders are very knowledgeable, and hats off to Alex for a good conversation.The food here is 5-star. The cost is going to be prohibitive to some people. It falls into the category of gourmet dining with higher-than-normal prices. If the cost is too expensive, I would suggest other places in town, but their food isn't going to even come close to what I had at Orale. You aren't going to walk out of there stuffed, patting your stomach like you were just eating the $10 buffet at a Golden Corral. I'd probably give this closer to a 4.5 only because after spending $70 on dinner (including tip) I could have likely ordered 1 more entree to feel full. That would be my only knock and why I removed 1 star.I don't think that should stop you from going here, and I wish them the best of luck.
2019-03-05,5,I hosted an 18 person party at Orale in Hoboken on Saturday and was very pleased with my overall experience.  We had a 2 hour bottomless brunch and a pre-selected menu (that I chose in advance).  The menu for the 2 hr brunch had A LOT of options which was awesome.  We arrived early because it was a surprise party and we were allowed to set up and get seated prior to arrival time and i appreciate that so much! Frozen margaritas were strong, everyone seemed to have plenty to eat, and the staff was really friendly and accommodating. I would recommend for large group parties (there is a back room that could seat a lot of people) or for a regular dining experience.  They did a great job!
2019-03-03,5,Came back for a birthday dinner and had an excellent experience. This time I tried the burger. It was so freakin good, I highly recommend you ordering and trying. The beef was melt in your mouth, the pork belly nice and salty. It was awesome. The birthday boy tried the mole chicken and also said it was two thumbs up. Again great service and food. Keep it up!
2019-03-02,5,I went to Orale last night for the first time with my boyfriend, and we LOVED it! We are big foodies and love a buzzing atmosphere, and Orale was the best of both worlds. We arrived 30 minutes early to get a drink at the bar (8:30pm) and the place was packed, but luckily we found one seat at the bar. I got the Blood Orange Margherita and he got the smoked Old Fashion, and both were amazing. Our reservation was for 9:15pm and online I requested we sit in the Dead room, but found out in person that's just a request and they can't guarantee it. By the time it was ready for us to be seated the place cleared out a bit so we ended up sitting in the Dead room.  There we ordered a frozen Margherita and a Mojito and again drinks were fantastic. I did a lot of research beforehand and knew to get the duck appetizer and it was no disappointment. We agreed they were the best nachos we both ever had. As an entree he got the carnitas tacos and I got the halibut tacos, we weren't as blown away with the tacos but still good. Each person gets 5 tacos each which is a very generous portion. And complimentary from the restaurant they give you a a side bowl of rice and beans which were phenomenal. Drinks at the bar were $30 and dinner was just under $100. Pretty good prices too.
2019-02-16,5,This is a dope spot! THIS location is a classic example of when upscale blends well, dare I say marries, that bad boy from the street and I like it! The food was amazing. The vibes were something you could only find here. I was super impressed by the drinks, they gave great flavor and an even better buzz. The duck nacho! Where do I being? Let's just just muy bien! If you want to experience authentic Mexican food with a chic atmosphere this is your stop! Oh one last thing the decor is perfect for photos!
2019-02-16,5,Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Must try the truffle guacamole!! The margs are strong and delicious.We will be coming back soon for more!
2019-02-08,4,Love This place. The one in JC is too small and this one is huge, much better. The food is great as well. The only thing is that they are on the pricier side but the food is delicious and the drinks are very strong. It's worth it
2019-02-08,4,This is the new spot in town so you know Dr Eats needed to try it out. Looks like they have other locations as well which is a good sign since it means it is a proven concept. Heres what I think:I started with a drink at the bar. I tried the malbec and even though this is a mexican place I had to try the wine since it was on the menu.  After looking at the menu this is more mexican fusion than traditional mexican. Not a bad thing but dont come here expecting what you would find in guadalajara. I went with the halibut tacos for my entree. For appetizers I tried the bao buns and guacomole trio.  The bao buns were solid and a unique preparation. Unfortunately I didnt take any pictures of it but give it a try.  It sounds weird but I enjoyed the flavor combinations. The guacamole trio were interesting. One of them was extremely spicy almost too much to handle.  The halibut tacos were pretty good. I was worried about how fresh the halibut would be but it hit the mark. It wasnt oily either and so the combination of ingredients worked. There is a decent atmosphere here. It is a little lively between the bar and the dining room. It is good for groups and for couples. I like this place and it is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.
2019-02-05,5,If you're in the mood for tacos on Tuesdays this is the place. Half off some of the tacos on the menu and amazing happy hour! Definitely 5 outta 5
2019-01-31,5,One of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to. A bit crowded on weekends but if you can manage the wait it is definitely worth it!
2019-01-30,5,Awesome atmosphere!! Very good food too. Drinks were delicious and very cool signature drinks. Happy hour specials weren't great though
2019-01-28,5,So so happy Orale moved into my neighborhood! The food is great, the vibe is awesome. A great spot to have dinner with friends. I'm happy they expanded to this location and I hope they're here forever. Such a great addition to Hoboken.
2019-01-25,1,Called to make a reservation last week and was told they do not take them. Came tonight and was told I need a reservation. When I asked another staff member what time the next reservation was available I was told that once the party arrives it would be no problem to seat me so I did not need one. After my friends parked I came back 10 minutes later with my entire party of 3 and was then told that nothing was available for 45 minutes. Everyone I spoke to was extremely rude and it was incredibly off putting. In the past I really loved my experience at the Jersey City location however the management in this new Hoboken location is an awful representation of the name.
2019-01-24,4,Amazing atmosphere -- it's so fun to travel between the two differently-themed bars! Food was delicious, too. I highly recommend the panzanella salad, as well as the taquitos. Our waiter provided us with lots of information and (what turned out to be) great recommendations!The bathroom was not great. A generally unpleasant experience. If it weren't for this, I'd have given this place a 5 star review!
2019-01-21,5,The food and service here is amazing! I went on opening day and can't wait to come back... there's two selections in the restaurants you can either go to the dark side (like I did) and there's a selected drink menu for that or for the bright side.. it's a fun place!
2019-01-17,1,I seriously just got thrown out of this place because my son ( who is in middle school) stopped by to grab tacos in between his wrestling and basketball practice. Apparently we were sitting in a dining room for 21 and over patrons...yes the whole dining room is for 21 and over! 3 different staff members came over to let me know that I was breaking Orale's rules and could not stay even though he had to leave for practice in 20 minutes. He was extremely embarrassed .  I was told that he would ruin the other patrons ambiance! What...so disappointed bc we have been frequenting the Jersey City Orale location for years. What has happened to respect and good judgement?
2019-01-17,1,Tonight I was thrown out at a birthday party!  I was told that my 11 year old son was not allowed to be located in a dining room.  The entire dining room was 21 and over!  He was only going to be ther for 20 minutes between wrestling practice and a basketball game at Wallace.  I am appalled over this situation and will be reporting this to the better business bureau.  They said my son would ruin the other patrons ambiance.  We have been frequent visitors in the other JC location and can not believe this treatment.  My son is extremely upset over this situation and embarrassed.  Three staff members had to escort us out like we were gang bangers!
2019-01-14,3,It's good. A little expensive for what it is - it's 3.5 star food with 4.5 star prices (Eg price exceeds quality), but if you're in the mood for this sort of joint it's not bad.
2019-01-12,5,Make a reservation in advance! The wait is typically longer than an hour on the weekend. Great ambiance and a new trendy vibe for Hoboken. If you get there earlier you'll have to wait at the bar until you are seated - good chance to take a look at the cocktail menu. I started with the Blood Orange Margarita and it was very sweet, also strong which was good. My second drink was a classic Margarita made spicy which was still very sweet. We ordered the Casa guacamole - next time we will get the sampler - it was great, their spicer option and went well with the hot sauces. For entrees, we ordered the Enchiladas Suiza and Cripsy Fish tacos. Added a side of Duck Fat Truffle Fries - probably wouldn't get them again but they were very tasty! Overall, the food was great. The service was excellent and they checked in frequently to ensure everything was OK. Can't wait to go back again and try new things. Seems like the best order is the 3x Guacamole sampler and splitting 2 taco entrees.
2019-01-11,1,I would give this restaurant 0 stars if it were an option. The host/ co-owner, Alex, has a terrible attitude and is rude to his customers. He told us there was an hour wait, and after an hour, never came to inform us that our table was ready. The food at this restaurant is mediocre at best and way over priced. In addition to the awful service and food, one of the staff members who works in the kitchen was in the bathroom at the same time as me, and walked out of the restroom without washing their hands, and then proceeded to go back into the kitchen, and cook the food we ate. I wish I could say that this restaurant was great as Hoboken needs more restaurants, but I will NEVER return back here again.
2019-01-10,4,When I went, they were not taking reservations, so it was first come, first serve. We had to wait about 45 minutes for a table of two, but the time flew by, as we were able to go by the bar and order amazing drinks and appetizers. They have a great vibe throughout the restaurant and sort of a lounge feel in essence. I recall the truffle honey guacamole was absolutely amazing! We ordered a variety of tacos which were delicious. A downfall for was their short rib, which clearly needed more time cooking to tenderize, as well as there tres leche, is very untraditional, dry and more of a cake then the moist tres leche which is usually expected. The gentleman that served us at the bar as well as our waiter were very attentive. I would definitely go back for another try, but change up certain food choices for sure.
2019-01-06,5,Great food, great vibe!!! Just what Hoboken needed! I with there were more places like this in Hoboken! My husband and I originally went here on a date and then just came back with our one year old and friends who have a 9 month old and we were worried they wouldn't be accommodating but they were amazing! Nice to be able to get out as a parent for trendy drinks and food with friends other than just local pizza because you have a kids! Great job guys can't wait to go back!
2019-01-05,5,Oh, yummy! I was wandering around Hoboken, and checked into Yelp to see what was nearby to eat. Orale was at the top of the list. I was rolling solo this night, and sat at the bar. The bar tenders were very kind, and recommended Carnitas tacos. So that's what I ordered. Well..... that, and guacamole de casa, and white sangria. Everything was great.The white sangria had only a bit of fruit, which is fine when you're getting a smaller glass of wine. My chips were fresh. I make guacamole at home, and ended up adding salt to mine. That was the only thing that could've been better.My carnitas tacos were AMAZING! I expected them to be okay, but they had so much flavor, and each little cube of pork was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It came with 5 small tacos, which was two more than I expected. Great place to eat. Found myself at the one in Jersey City within a week. That review next....
2019-01-03,4,Welcome addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene.  Two separate rooms - one allows kids and the other does not.  If a kid even approaches the threshold I think a silent alarm goes off and the staff swarms.  Very cool funky décor.  Extremely loud.  Music is pumping, not a place for quiet conversation.  Queso appetizer was excellent as were both of the taco plates that we got.  Very interesting cocktails and good margaritas.
2019-01-03,4,Such a great new spot! The interior is perfect for both small and large groups, and the decor is super fun. I came here with a group of 6, and we had a blast. The sangria is delicious - though I preferred the white sangria. The guacamole comes in a trio, and you get to pick from an array of flavors. I highly recommend the Serrano Marmalade. I will say the size was a bit small for 6 of us, thought it would be perfect for a smaller group. The queso was also amazing - though also small for 6 of us. We should have ordered two. My main dish was just ok. I ordered the Enchilada Vegetariana, and it was so spicy to the point where I couldn't finish it. I'm usually pretty good with spicy, but this was too much. I'm sure this could be modified, but there was no spicy label on the menu and our waiter didn't mention anything. I probably should have read more into the ingredients, but i was a bit disappointed. However, I would definitely go back and order a different entree!
2019-01-02,1,Staff is clearly not fit for the money you pay here. Waiter rushed us 4 times in a span of 5 minutes even though we weren't done with our meal. Snarky management - they don't take critisism well. If you address a concern, they'll laugh at when you walk out. Some guy (looked like the owner or manager) was openly vaping behind the host's counter. You are 5 steps away from the entrance but you have to smoke inside to make a statement? Makes me wonder what goes on in the back end.
2019-01-01,5,I spent New Year's Eve here and it was utterly insane in the most amazing way. First of all the decor and ambience of the restaurant is fantastic. You don't feel like you are in Hoboken. The host Corey was super accommodating and got me and my friend great seats at the bar. When we sat down we were warmly greeted by Anwar and Ashley Who made sure our drinks were never empty the entire night. Now to the really good part the food! The food is fantastic - generous portions and tasty. The management staff including the owner and a guy named Christian kept coming around and checking to make sure everybody was having a good time. New Year's Eve at Orale exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to go back for dinner
2019-01-01,4,The dessert Tres Leches is a must! The tacos were flavorful. The guacamole is just okay. I think a bit overpriced for size portion. I'd come here for the vibes, cocktails and tres leches. I'd go to Charritos in Weehawken or Hoboken for warm chips and larger portions of yummy guacamole.
2019-01-01,5,I'm so happy that Orale opened up in Hoboken!!  I'm a huge fan of the location in JC, so I was delightfully surprised that I received the same great service and food.  Orale features more trendy than traditional Mexican dishes like ahi tuna tacos on lettuce cups (my absolute favorite) and crispy port belly tacos (my second favorite).  The margaritas are also fantastic.  I love the cool decor and vibe of the restaurant.  Make sure to make reservations when visiting or prepare to wait a while.  Also plenty of metered parking in this area of Hoboken.
2018-12-30,4,Great new Mexican restaurant in Hoboken. The food was delicious and service great! We had the duck nachos, carnitas tacos and duck fat fries. There are 5 street tacos... so much food! 4 stars instead of 5 because the music was so loud I could barely have a conversation with anyone at our table.
2018-12-29,4,This place is great! I just went for the first time yesterday and for a new spot they seemed to have most of the kinks worked out already. The decor and entire vibe of the place is awesome. Service was great, very attentive and helpful waitress, bussers and runners. The food was also great. My bf and I shared a guac trio where you get to try 3 different flavors for 12 bucks. it was more than enough for two people and the chips were home-made and delicious. the guac was great as well. We also tried the Flautas for an app - they were good with a strong chipotle flavor. For the main dish we both ordered the carnitas tacos. I was expecting 3 tacos but they give you a generous 5. they also give you three sauces to try with your meals, chipotle, a salsa verde, and also a spicy sauce. All were delicious and fun to try different combinations on your tacos. We were way to full to even think about dessert. maybe next timeAll in all i would definitely recommend this place and will be going back. The only two things i might change is that the music was very loud so i had to speak pretty loud for my bf to hear me across the table, but it was a friday night so i get it. Also, i wish that they would have charred the corn tortilla for the tacos for a minute or two. they were great, but i feel like throwing the tortilla on the grill would have made them even better. Cant wait to go back or try the original spot in JC!
2018-12-29,5,Finally a great Mexican restaurant in Hoboken that has it all! Long over due, no need to go to Jersey City anymore. The food is amazing (generous portions 5 tacos), cocktails esp. spicy margaritas are on point, and ambiance is super fun! Staff are very attentive and accommodating. Plus this place is stroller and kid friendly. I live downtown and this place was worth the walk uptown! We will be back!
2018-12-28,4,Finally Orale has come to Hoboken and it's just as great as the original! The frozen margaritas are a must try along with all the guac. The staff is new since the location recently opened, so they aren't the grade A staff like the one at JC but in time I'm sure they'll get it together.
2018-12-25,4,New, hip, Mexican spot. Overall excellent vibe with good food. It's a great addition to northern Hoboken since more of the restaurant selection is towards Washington St and the central area. We got the Guacamole Casa, Carnitas Tacos, and the Wood Grilled Pollo Tacos - all were very good. Guac portion size was a bit small and it came with no salsa, which was a surprise, but no real complaints! Isaac, our waiter, was fantastic and took the time to explain recommendations along with the types of hot sauces they serve. We were here for dinner but the happy hour options look great as well. Will definitely be back and would certainly recommend!
2018-12-24,5,Best Restaurant in Hoboken! Food is amazing, have ordered almost everything on the menu and can say it's pretty much top notch across the board. (The only thing we haven't like so far is the bone marrow soup). The staff is great and the drinks are amazing too. They really put a lot into the decor and ambiance and it feels like a really cool NYC restaurant. The only slightly negative thing is that since they're so good there can be a long wait if you don't make a reservation, but you can just grab a drink by the bar. The wait just speaks to the quality of the experience, if it sucked there wouldn't be a wait. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed.
2018-12-23,1,The staff manager was an extremely rude guy. Also, they asked us for tip even when it was not mandatory. We paid the bill and when we were walking out, the staff manager rudely told us that don't come next time if u don't want to tip. The staff manager insulted me and my friends by being extremely rude with his comments. I politely even requested for beans as a substitute of meat and they rudely rejected my request. I am okay with that but it was a worst dine in experience for me because asking tip and taking tip from me in such a rude manner was extremely harsh. I felt an amount of racism from the staff manager. I definetly gave extra tip and when i was apologetic about it, he kept on speaking rudely!! Very very disappointing experience
2018-12-21,4,We went here last night for dinner. So this place is trying to keep children sectioned off to the front which is fine. But I was trying to order a drink at the bar and my son got treated like 2nd class citizens. The food was good I see that it is not just hype. We got the cheese to start. My son got the hamburger we got the chicken tacos and the fish tacos. The drinks were really good too and there was a special on drinks too so bonus!
2018-12-18,5,I loved their tuna taco and the margaritas are stupendous. I must not forget the waiters are phenomenal.
2018-12-17,4,I've been a fan of the Jersey City location for a while. This Hoboken location is definitely classier . The decor is awesome and it's much more spacious. I like that it has two bars in two different rooms. The staff were friendly and attentive.. almost too attentive. Please do yourself a favor and get the duck fat fries ..they were so delicious. I had the Dinosario short Rib which was excellent however I could have used just a little more polenta. The polenta was good and extra creamy but it was barely there. I like that the cocktail menu is better than the Jersey City one. The margaritas, however, were not up to the same quality as the JC location.. I looove the margaritas there and this location they were just ok. My one main gripe with both locations is that when ordering guacamole they give you the world's smallest serving of guacamole. If you have a large table each person would need their own. We need a larger option for the guacamole.. avocados always make things better.
2018-12-16,4,This new uptown Hoboken joint is has an amazing vibe and great decor. The place looks like straight out of Dia de Muertos with all the skulls and graffiti. I loved it. Came here on a Sunday evening and the music was pumping. The joint has two sections on the first level (I believe there is a 2nd as well), one section is for families and one is for adults only. Both sections have a full bar. My bartender was very friendly and hooked me up with a Dark & Stormy (+great pour... one drink was all I needed).I ordered the Bone Broth Bowl which had a nice flavor with a good amount of meat. At $25 it was a 3 star entree. I'm bumping this place up for the great decor and friendly staff. I do wish they had to-go menus. We'll be back to check out more of the menu. And snap more photos! I confused this joint with it's Jersey City sister joint which has over 1000 photos so I didn't take any. Mybad yelpers... I'll step it up next time.
2018-12-16,5,So great!  The margaritas, the food, the incredible atmosphere, no wonder why it's perpetually busy for a new spot. Just like the Jersey City original, it's a cool, bustling spot for a date, meet friends, or just grab a drink at the bar.  Favorite feature.....adults only dining section when you don't feel like being surrounding by the little ones!!!!  Congrats Orale, you got the right formula!
2018-12-15,5,I am a huge Mexican food foodie and I can honestly say this was the best Mexican meal I can ever remember.  Food and service were outstanding.  I highly recommend the guacamole tasting, the carnitas tacos and the Illegally Aged margarita.
2018-12-15,5,Cool vibe, good food, great guac and lots of margarita options. And a block from home. What could be better? Sound level is pretty loud. No reservations yet. But all in all excellent.
2018-12-14,4,This place was great. The food was good. Drinks were good. Service was awesome and the atmosphere was spot on. The general manager stopped by to greet us (nice touch) and informed us they've only been open 3 weeks. They are doing it right so far. As a local, I hope this place keeps it up. My only critique is with the margaritas. They taste a bit watery, but I'm certain it's because they use all natural ingredients. I think a bit more lime and simple syrup would kick them up a notch. Otherwise the cocktails are good. I'm looking forward to going back!
2018-12-11,5,This place is amazing!! Came in for taco Tuesday and left with a full stomach and a smile on my face!! I heard this place was great from some friends but wow!! Had a seat at the bar and had two orders of some amazing tacos( the carnitas and the fish- check them out)! Also had a lovely conversation with the bartender(joel- also check him out) I can't wait to come back!!! Try a margarita. The staff is amazing and so is the food!!
2018-12-11,5,I genuinely enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The service was phenomenal! The selection of tequila was amazing and the food was very good. High quality establishment. The atmosphere was the best I've experienced in Hoboken. I have no problem recommending this place I will be back.
2018-11-30,5,Love it! We have been to the JC location and tried the Hoboken one out on one of the nights in opening week, the first Saturday. I was worried that the food service would have some kinks to work out but it was great. Would have never known they were freshly opened. Food lived up to expectations- the guacamole flight was yummy and my husband loved his carnitas tacos. I got the pollo tacos and the chicken was so tasty. I also love the rice and beans here. So so good. The cookie for dessert was amazing- two warm and gooey chocolate chip w gelato. Can't wait to go back. Ty was our server and he is amazing. Had everything out quickly, good recommendations, speedy drink refills from the bar and he was so nice.
2018-11-26,5,Excellent food, drinks, vibe, bartenders, service. We are so excited this finally opened up in our neighborhood!
2018-11-21,5,Went to their Hoboken location last night and I would say make it a point to visit this fabulous restaurant as soon as you can! Already a big fan of their Jersey City spot and this one takes it up another level. From the minute you are greeted to when you roll out you are treated to top notch service, cocktails, and food. Menu highlights for me are duck tacos, NY Strip, and grilled octopus. Cocktail choices are plentiful and and expanded beyond JC location and the place is a visual stunner. Enjoy your visit - no doubt you will be back like me!!
