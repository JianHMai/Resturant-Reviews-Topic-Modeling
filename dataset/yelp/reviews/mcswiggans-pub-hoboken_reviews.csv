2021-04-22,1,One of the owners Paul is a racist and a misogynist. I've been frequenting this bar for over 10 years and this buffoon has made it so unpleasant that residents no longer desire to patronize the establishment.
2021-03-21,1,How do you keep customers during a pandemic? Well you double your pieces, cut drinks down and cut your menuNOTWHAT A JOKE THIS BAR HAS BECOMENone of my buddies will go anymore-And after today neither will I9.50 for spiked seltzer? The specials and menu changes like the wind and the service-She never came back!I'm sorry but-New management is needed NOW or else this bar will not lastA favorite and a regular spot for us for so many years is done
2021-03-08,2,Bar atmosphere is fun and both the servers are bartenders are attentive! Food is very subpar; I wouldn't eat here again. Ordered a High Noon and I believe it was $12, which is super overpriced IMO. All around, just ok.
2021-02-28,1,I came here with my husband for some drinks to end our night before heading home. The place was super crowded considering Covid restrictions. We were sat a table outside since inside was full. The table was still dirty from whoever sat there before, I sprayed it down with my own alcohol. I ordered a jalapeño margarita, it only tasted like sour mix on ice. My husband had a Strongbow cider which was not cold. We decided to order pickleback shots, one of our favorites...big mistake. The whiskey was so watered down and tasted like nothing, so disappointing. We told our server about it and he said it was Jameson, that was definitely a lie. I aldo used the restroom which was really dirty and smelled terrible. Completely disappointed with my experience here and will not go back.
2021-01-20,5,Best bar in Hoboken. Francis is the best bar tender I have ever had, nicest guy around. Always come back to see him. Love a good Irish bar
2020-10-24,1,Not safe. Don't go here. Totally packed. Someone should call the mayor. Gross. It's really just an average beer / shot beer with kinda good boneless buffalo wings but absolutely no personally or character.
2020-10-23,1,I will never spend another dollar at this bar. First of all, the drinks are super watery and not cheap. 14$ for a watery vodka club. Second, the food is disgusting and tastes like it has all just been reheated from the freezer. Their Mac and cheese was not edible and who can mess up Mac and cheese? Potato skins- gross. Wings- tiny and cold. Third, I have never had such a bad experience with a waitress, ever. I think her name was Sarah, and she was absolutely just mean. You would think I murdered her family when I asked her for a water. Openly miserable and was giving us such a nasty attitude, when we are just customers trying to order drinks/food. We were a group of 8, I understand we were a big party, but her attitude was unwarranted and made us all uncomfortable. She even went behind the bar after we ordered more drinks and we saw her waving her arms around and clearly going off about us to the bartender. To treat us the way she did, she is not in the right industry!! Most people would be excited to get a large party and that means a large tip! Nope, she blew it. Horrible experience overall and with such a competitive market in Hoboken - skip this place !!
2020-10-18,3,Finally got here early enough to snag "OK" seats for the Pats game. I say just OK because while there were ample TVs playing the game (with the sound on - love!),  the way the high-tops and low-tops are laid out (high-tops in front, lows behind and two steps down) mean that there's little to no good viewing available from the outdoors seats. Simple suggestion to the bar: maybe switch the two -- that way all three rows get good viewing and everyone is happy. While we were waiting for the game to start, we saw three separate parties sit then leave in the table by us because of the viewing issue. One quarter in, we are standing up during key plays to see the game over the front rows' heads. With few bars playing the Pats game with sound, we just deal with this annoyance but honestly the quick fix would make a world of difference! Food is decent/typical for a sports bar and appreciate the $19/bucket of beers, though limited to Bud Light and Miller. This place gets jammed for Football Sunday when the weather is nice, so plan accordingly!
2020-09-10,4,Mc Swiggens has literally kept my friends and I sane (and buzzed) during COVID. The owner is so nice and really cares about his business. Outside dining and drinking has been dope. When there's not a global pandemic taking a hot steaming dump on our lives, Mc Swiggs is good if you want to dance in a poorly lit room. The attract people of all ages but it definitely attracts young 20's crowd. 4 stars because food is ehh, but you shouldn't come here with the intentions of a good meal, decent meal yes, good is asking too much.
2020-09-06,4,Came here for summer streets and it was fun! They have a good beer selection and the staff always keeps it entertaining there. I also got the mozzarella sticks and they were really good!
2019-11-22,5,We love McSwiggins! Amazing bar staff, excellent food, good weekday drink specials, and trivia tuesdays. Come out and try to beat us! Again, let me emphasize the amazing bartenders!
2019-02-07,5,New England Patriots bar aka best bar ever!!! I was in town for work and I met a friend at this bar, so I am not from the area however they have great drink specials and they also sell food. It is a great spot to meet friends and just grab drinks (or bar food). They have a bunch of beers on draft and daily drink/food specials. I went for the AFC championship game and I was surprised by the level of service. The venue was completely packed, yet they were VERY attentive to all of the guests. I would definitely come back here if I am in the Hoboken area. I also started following them on IG. Cheers!
2018-11-27,1,Come here only if you want them to over tip themselves on a credit card tab.Came here on a Sunday, got 3 beers and two shots which came out to 49.50, which is pricey but not unheard of. Then I checked my credit card bill to see they added an extra 5 dollars to their tip, which is illegal in jersey.Thankfully my credit card company will deal with it.
2018-10-29,4,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken. Atmosphere is good. Not to big not to small. Bartenders are always on point. Gets very crowded on the weekends. Great location. Fairly priced.
2018-10-16,4,Good bar spot! Odd when we all first walked in. Saturday around 2ish and they had no servers so all orders had to go through bar. I got chicken Caesar wrap and sweet chili boneless bites. Both good! I would go back!
2018-10-08,4,Had so much fun here. I found the drinks a bit pricey for the atmosphere. Looks like a dive bar but they have darts and a pool table. Both were very hard to get a turn on but my friends and I did and up playing but we had to play with the people who were already playing.
2018-09-07,3,This place is good for going out at night and for the nights they have live music. Came one day when they had a $5 food special and the food was below average, there are far better bars and restaurants in the area to eat.
2018-07-19,2,I've been to this bar a few times & I think it is just alright. Is this a bar that will be one of my top choices to go to, no. At the same time, this is not a bar that I would refuse to go to either. To sum it up, I would not persuade my friends to go here on a Friday/Saturday night but if they all wanted to go, I would not protest. My biggest issue with this place is that recently they started to charge a $5 cover on weekends. I'm sorry but this place should NOT be charging a cover at all. Most bars in Hoboken (unless there is a live band which I'm totally fine with) don't charge a cover so I don't know why this establishment thought it was a good idea. Very flawed thinking if you asked me.
2018-06-24,4,I like this place. I came here w my bf on Sat night. The vibes and music were just right. Beers were pretty standard, but a few more options than other bars.Food was not great tho. I ordered Salsa & Guac, my bf ordered beef burger. Both of us barely ate...
2018-04-14,1,I was playing pool and one of the staff forcibly ended the game early even though my team was shooting at the 8-ball. Savages wouldn't wait two minutes for the game to end.
2018-01-01,1,I had a terrible experience here, we came on a Monday, and it was a holiday, so it wasn't full, and they have a 5$ all you can eat wings. We were 2 people and ordered our first basket of wings that took 30 minutes to come and were cold. That was after the waitress being rude to explain that we could not order more than one basket at a time, which was not written anywhere. The second basket come in, we asked for the check and left. The bar was noise, but that is not surprising in the Hoboken bar scene, but the music selection was good, I have to given them that.
2017-12-22,3,Our group of 4 came by on a Thursday evening, right after happy hour ended, and it wasn't too crowded. I figure this is not always the case, as we came during holiday season (aka most students in the area go home for the holidays instead of frequenting the bar). Felt a little awkward going to the restroom because the room it was in was partitioned by a curtain - turned out there was some sort of speech/small event going on.I asked for a screwdriver, and was basically given a glass of OJ. Also, we JUST missed happy hour. Non-happy hour prices were reasonable though - 2 beers and 2 well drinks came out to about 28 bucks.
2017-12-20,1,Came here for the first time with a few friends on Saturday night for my friends birthday. Wasn't too crowded, but the DJ was HORRIBLE. At the end of the night we were the only 4 left in the bar and we're hoping to have the DJ play a classic (Birthday Sex) in her honor and he was SO rude and refused. He was just chatting with another worker the whole time instead of playing music. Out of nowhere, DJ became very angry and he started a verbal altercation which turned physical. One of our friends was  just standing nearby and they put him in a chokehold for absolutely no reason other than he's black. They are clearly racist and do not value their customers!!! Stay away!! Absolutely disgusted with this place
2017-12-17,5,One of my favorite bars in town! They have $5 food specials that are different each night of the week. Seating outside in the summer is really nicer than you may expect and inside there are high tables and bar seating. Always a blast on the weekends for a night out too. Great local spot just off Washington St and still close to the PATH.
2017-11-18,4,Always a fun time here! The bartenders are cool, and they play great music. They also serve their mixed drinks in full sized cups (you don't have to choose single or double) which is always a plus for someone on a budget :) It gets pretty packed but nothing unmanageable.
2017-10-19,2,Years ago I had Wachos... waffle fry nachos... here. They were awesome.. back then. Meaty potato-tasting base with a good amount of meat and toppings. I had them last night... the exact opposite. Greased-up, fried-to-h@ll spuds with barely any toppings. Terrible. Booo this man.
2017-09-16,2,We usually have a great time here but beware of the bartender with facial hair on Saturday. He demanded to know our entire groups order and then wouldn't let us split when we upfront said we wanted separate checks. He also filled a pint glass when we asked for a regular as if he was doing us a favor and then made up the prices or charged us for "doubles when he should be charging triples" even though we never ordered that in the first place. He's clearly drunk, super arrogant and continues to act as if he's "doing us a favor" after the fact even though he's backhandely charging us without any warning.
2017-09-16,1,This place is gross. It smells like a combination of licorice ans sewage. Also the staff is horrible and apparantly drunk. The bartender asked me what I wanted and I said "two vodka clubs make them light please" Then he gave me doubles and asked how much I wanted to pay for them. Obviously I said $5 each jokingly... he then charged me $30 for two doubles I did not ask for. I was confused but just decided to pay and walk away. He was very rude and drunk I think. I will not be back.
2017-09-16,3,Sooo this place is definitely meant for a younger crowd! It reminded me of a fun, sloppy mess,  college bar. Came here on a Friday and the place was packed from wall to wall. The dj was pretty good and there is a dance floor in the back of the bar. Spent my night getting hit on and /or  shoved by drunken 22 year olds (who looked like they may actually be 18 haha). I'd recommend it to the under 25 crowd.
2017-08-23,4,A decent bar for conversations, drinks and maybe a live acoustic act at times. Food not really great but the ambience would cover up for that. Good place to catch a any live game.
2017-08-04,2,This place is ok but the dj is extremely rude. It was our friend's birthday and he not only ignored us but wouldn't play a popular song that happened to include the word birthday in it. When we asked him not only did he ignore us but the security was extremely rude. We are here trying to celebrate and we will definitely not recommend to friends in the future for birthdays or any type of celebration. At least pretend you're going to take requests.They also charged us for water which is ridiculous. Do you want people to throw up everywhere? Give them water goddamnit
2017-06-08,1,I did not have a good experience here. Make sure you check how much the bar tenders charge you before ordering. They like to swindle customers if you know what I mean
2017-04-30,1,We were asked to leave because we were on motorcycles.    Who else are they prejudice against???Don't spend your money at such an ignorant, prejudice establishment when there are so many other small businesses that appreciate all patrons!!!
2017-04-05,2,Make sure you go before 8pm to get the good deals. Afterwards the prices are the same or more expensive than NYC. 2 yeungling draft, 1 lagunitas and 1 vodka soda with lime $34 before tip - pretty steep!!! Especially for a half empty bar on a Wednesday in Hoboken. The vodka sodas are extremely weak also - tastes like water, can't feel anything, wouldn't recommend
2017-03-24,5,Really nice place and lots of live music sets almost every day.
2017-02-01,4,Second time here , the first being Halloween.  It's a sports bar/Irish pub with a pool table in the back. The Table placing is good and it keeps this open for people to move freely from the bar.They had live music playing and the local artist was phenomenal.  Try their Phoenix shots once. It's cool for a dry ice bomb . Kind of sweet. I think they're 5 dollars each. It was a long night.I like this place but since I'm from NYC I only stop by if I'm in the area for an event
2016-12-19,1,$5 all you can eat is a SCAM. It lasts 1 hr, they give you 3 wings/ 2 ribs and take so long to come back to you that you would be lucky to get 6 wings or 4 ribs total!
2016-12-05,5,So im on my day off and ive always wanted to visit this this place. My cousn and i come and we hear 4 dollar miller draft, 7 dollar personal pitchers, and 10 dollar towers! My face went from blah to wide eyed cheekey smile. My cousin's. Eyes were like O.O anywho Victoria the bartender tells us this so we have a tower a piece and we shoot pool. (yea they got a pool table only a few bars have those in hoboken) so i see these two other bartenders Mike and friggin Jay, i met two knew friends. They offered me and my cousin the Pheonix fire bomb. In 5 min we did another and in the other 5 min i swear my cousin and i were brand new men. These guys took care of us they made us feel at home i appreciated it. When we had the munchies we had 2 celtic burgers with sweet fries. Sizziling crispy canadian bacon. And they toasted the bread. YUM! come here its dope
2016-10-19,3,Cool pub in downtown Hoboken. They do offer $5 all you can eat every weeknight. Starts from $5 AYCE wings on Monday; $5 AYCE ribs on Tuesday; $5 AYFE boneless chicken on Wednesday; $5 AYCE oysters on Thursday and $5 AYCE nachos on Friday. That's pretty good deal if you're starving. $4 all drafts till 8pm on Wednesday night. See you tomorrow for oysters. Lmao
2016-09-20,3,All you post college/Stevens kids, have I got a place for you!!!!  This place is a drunken mess.  I don't mean that as an insult.   If you are young and want to hook up, dance, and get drunk this is your place.  I wouldn't dare eat here.  It is a fun party bar.  It is a pre game and get drunk bar.  I have great memories and non memories here.  The bartenders are good here.  Have the ladies order for you because they might get some extras!  I can appreciate a bar like this.
2016-09-15,5,A "shot and a beer" bar but a shot and a beer bar done right. 5 stars all the way. Also got absolutely Jerried here during the snowstorm.
2016-08-30,1,They charged me of the drinks that I didn't have and when I asked them to fix the bill the bartender said that it's too late for it and whether I want the drinks (jameson shots and a beer) that I was charged extra. The lights were on and the night was over, we were going out and I have already had a lot and I couldn't drink it. Then they said if I was sure, and they were sorry. The whole time this convo was happening a bodyguard was next to us listening and giving me the look. Will never be back. I suggest you not.
2016-08-03,5,This bar is the Phenix Bom.com! LOL If you don't know they serve these shots called Phenix Boms that look like they r smoking and if you don't know Guy Fiereri says good things are the bom.com so know you know the joke. LOLZ Guy should come too this bar for Triple D. They have all you can eat ribs cooked in Gunness and they play the sickkest music like Linkin Park and 3 Doors Down.The one drawback is that I tried to get them to put Battlebots on TV but the girl said peeple were watching the Yankys.
2016-07-12,5,This is my favorite Bar in Hoboken. Brandon J Mike and Viktoria. They are all so wonderful and friendly. Whenever I walk in there I always feel like I'm part of the crew. I've been there for the games and for the drinks and occasionally for the food. If the staff like you enough you don't ever have to wait for a drink. I'm always greeted with the red carpet treatment and they never forget my favorite drink.
2016-06-23,3,One bartender for the entire place that was able to handle the entire bar and seating area.  I was shocked that for game 7 of the NBA finals there would only be one bartender.  Food was mediocre but a good selection of beers.
2016-05-31,4,Decent place, typical divey bar, but everyone was having fun there so no complaints.  Drinks were reasonably priced, nothing unusual.  Pool table in the back.  Fleet week guys were there, maybe it's popular with them.  Overall it's good to for a drink
2016-05-30,4,Ah, McSwiggan's.I hate that I have to go all the way downstairs and back up for your bathrooms, but am glad you have a pool table and an actual dance floor.Plenty of TVs and a decent, but not impressive draft and bottled beer selection, but apparently, that's not why people are going here anymore anyway. The Smoking Phoenix Bombs are the new kid on the block, but one was enough for me.
2016-05-14,4,Typical Irish pub in Hoboken. They have cheap happy hour specials and $5 all you can eat wings on Monday, boneless chicken bites Wednesday and oysters Thursday. I've only had the wings and they're pretty decent for 5 dollars. The staff is friendly and the overall vibe of the bar is very laid back. There's two dart boards and a pool table as well which is fun.
2016-05-02,5,Been going to Swig's for many years, still my favorite stop. Greatest bartenders, cozy space, like coming home each time I go
2016-04-18,3,I had a really fun time there on a Saturday night!! The people were all happy and fun, more chill than any other Hoboken bar. The dj was fun and had such good music!! The beers are decently priced! And all around happy night out
2016-03-25,5,Best pub around to hangout!! Love the atmosphere here especially during weekends. I am usually here with friends, colleagues during weekends. Love the beer & vodka shots. The DJ is rocks the dance floor late evening.
2016-03-19,3,It is what it is.... And it is below average.The setup of the bar makes it difficult to get served if you are on the one side. Everyone seemed to have the same problem.Not much to this place but pool table is a plus. Also the tvs were a decent size so you could definitely catch a game if needed. For my money there are better places in hoboken.
2016-02-17,5,Favorite frat bar in Hoboken. This bar is the reason why it's called Broboken. Bartenders are great and friendly and so are the bouncers. Never a cover (exceptions: leprecon, santacon, Halloween, NYE)Flaming shot specials all the timeGreat music and usually when it's dead at all other bars, it's still a party at mcswigs
2016-01-24,4,My third favorite bar on First Street. Fun on a Friday and  Saturday night good dj however not  my place  during the week. Would  not go here  for  food and the  draft selection is weak and they are a bit  pricey . My friends and I usually skip Swigs when they have a line and  hit  up  Mulligans or Marty O'Briens can't understand the attraction at times as the other bars in  the  hood are just as good if  not better.
2016-01-23,3,Not a bad spot in lower Hoboken to hang out and watch a game. Decent draft selection. Would go back again. Love the fact McSwiggan's carries the 12 oz. cans of Dale's Pale Ale! That's an extra star rating from me. Jets fans beware - I think this a Patriots bar.
2016-01-22,5,This is my favorite Hoboken bar. It combines all the elements of what you're looking for in an Irish bar. It is classy yet comfortable with a delightful local neighborhood feel. The bartenders may indeed know my name. The trivia night is fun and it's the kind bar that turns into dancing late night. Even on the slow nights McSwiggans is a sure bet. The bartenders make this place truly a pleasure to visit.
2015-12-10,5,basic beers, above average pub grub, great staff, Pats games on Sundays
2015-11-04,1,McSwiggan's you just lost my business and any endorsements I would (and have) give you in the future. The lack of any sort of acknowledgement or service when I came in tonight was astounding. Your bartenders are more interested in chit-chat with the closest customer in front of them than serving customers who are patiently waiting at the tables.
2015-10-30,3,Came here for happy hour and to catch up with some old friends and it was pretty empty on a Wednesday night.  Plenty of room at the bar and at the tables around the bar as well.  Solid drink specials that include 4 dollar drafts and 4 dollar well drinks and they had a 5 dollar chicken tender special as well (all you can eat until 9pm).  The service was okay and the one complaint I had was that when I ordered whiskey ginger ales, I felt that it was 85% ginger ale and I could barely taste the whiskey.  Not a bad spot for a solid happy hour though.
2015-10-27,4,Some of my best nights out in Hoboken have been at McSwiggan's. It's a no frills sports bar but unlike all of the other surrounding bars in the Irish corner (Marty O's, Mulligans, Dubliner) it's a guaranteed crazy and fun time.I used to DJ at a sports bar during my college years, and because of that I'm pretty nit picky about bar music. The DJ here passes with flying colors. The music choices are the perfect blend of top 40 hits and old school gems. No surprise that there is always a dance party here. I also love that there is a large outdoor area. If you are in for a casual happy hour you can post up outside or if you want to get yo' dance on you can venture to the dance floor for the party. It's just strait up fun here. Bars in this area can be very hit or miss and McSwiggan's always presents itself as a solid choice!
2015-09-27,3,Always a fun bar especially during football season! They have various drink and food special. The food special is not that great... They have $5 wings and $6 nachos - sounds like a deal but both are not worth it... You get the skimpiest amount of nachos and wings. Skip this place if you're looking for wings but come here for drinks!
2015-09-05,1,I was told to go somewhere else due to a "fake ID" which is my state issued ID. I will never go here ever. The guy didn't look at me either, just my current ID.
2015-08-24,5,My friends and I went here to celebrate my birthday last Thursday night. It was 2 for 1 vodka drinks and fireball shots night, and YES we took full advantage of it. (They were very generous with the vodka!!) The music was SO ON POINT the whole night! It was a nice crowd of people of all ages (pretty much from ages 21-30 from what I could tell was the majority), and friendly people overall. Only a little crowded by the bar but that's normal, nothing overwhelming. The bathroom was very clean and I like how there were 4-5 stalls. If you get around Hoboken a lot, you know how hard it is to find a place with a decent bathroom.We were able to find parking a block away which was so nice since we were worried that we'd have to drive around looking for a spot. We got there around 10:45pm.The only gripe I had was that our table was really sticky, so my purse/phone ended up getting sticky when I placed them on the table. One of my friends asked someone who worked there to wipe it down, which he did, but the table was still sticky afterwards. But it wasn't a mood-killer or anything.And that's all I can really remember about that night lol. SO much fun can't wait to do it again!(P.S. I love how this bar plays Red Sox games during the baseball season. This is so incredibly hard to find especially in NJ/NY. I visited once before a couple years ago with my boyfriend and dad to watch a game and grab a bite to eat. Will be back for sure!)
2015-08-23,5,Have visited McSwiggans countless times and always leave a happy customer. The bartenders and servers are extremely friendly and make attempts to remember repeat customers. Their $5 all you can eat deals are also amazing. Favorites are:Monday - wings (all are great!)Thursday -oysters (hit or miss. Some are great others seem poor quality)I wish they still had wachos as an option for the $5 deal. Nachos on top of waffle fries-- while it's still on the menu, it was sad to see that $5 deal go. The real wood burning fire is a great touch during the winter and the outdoor seating/retractable walls set a great atmosphere in the summer. If you like a casual "homey" feeling to a bar, McSwiggans is definitely worth a try.
2015-07-05,4,Came here as part of a pub crawl and it was mid afternoon, so probably can't compare to evenings.  Plenty of outdoor seating in the sun and an average selection of beer at reasonable prices.  The big thing for me was how friendly the (Irish) bar staff were.  We chatted about rugby before the rest of the crawlers arrived and the place filled up somewhat.  The staff seemed completely on top of everything and there was no delay when I went back to get a "Smoking Phoenix Bomb".  I don't remember what was in it other than it had dry ice and orange soda.  Who really cares what it tastes like when there's dry ice, right?Fun bar, will return next time I'm in Hoboken.
2015-05-19,3,Beware, this is a Patriots bar!McSwiggan's does something I wish every bar did; during football games they put a label under each TV saying what games it will air. That way you can pick a seat accordingly. So smart!When I was last here the was a special on Bud Light and wings, but you have to order them together. We missed out on part of the deal because we were not sure of what we wanted. They only have a limited number of beer towers so grab one when you can.I had ordered the gaelic burger which would have been great except the burger was cooked to medium well and killed the flavor. Show me some pink in that medium! All in all we had a good time though.
2015-03-05,4,I've been here a handful of times, and it hasn't disappointed..other than the fact this this is RedSox/PatsNation..but I won't hold it against anyone.There are two types of bars, Cheers and ..the others. My usual spot recently underwent a bit of personnel reorganization, which means I may or may not be in the market for a new norm. So far so good, strong bar menu AND weeknight specials ($5 AYCE WINGS ON MONDAYS!), chill non-creepy crowd, good music on the weekends, and the staff is aright. At the end of the day, the regular spot is all about the relaxed, low-maintenance, and easy-going homies--  friendly witty banter a plus. We'll see how it goes, but at the very least it's a reliable go-to.
2015-02-21,4,This is a divey Irish bar and I love it. Friendly bartenders help a lot. And every weeknight is a $5 all you can eat of something (ribs, wings, oysters, etc). And while it is definitely bar food and not the fanciest set up (simple red plastic baskets), the food a pretty decent and they don't gripe at you when you order re-up baskets (or, for instance, change you wing sauce for the second round). I've also been here for a weekend night out. The music/DJ is pretty good. Bar is averagely priced and its a fairly large space. It's always been a good time when I've been there.
2015-02-06,1,We arrived and the bouncer who is seemingly the owner was very nice. We had a great time until we walked  up to the the bar and seemingly crossed this group of drunk people. Unfortunately for us they were friends with the owner. Although we did nothing but walk up to the bar to try and order a round of drinks the owner got in my face and told me he did t want trouble. This is my first time I Hoboken. I can say I will never return to this bar.
2014-11-25,4,I have nothing bad to say about this place. They fed me during Sandy. They have a hot bartender who gives me free shots. They let me blackout to Nelly- Country Grammar... Enough said.
2014-11-04,3,Stopped by for football and left full and tipsy which is always a good sign.  The service was attentive and nice but beware the upsell, they know what they are doing.  The food was standard, deep fried bar fare.  Nothing new, nothing different, nothing homemade, but it's football Sunday are you looking for something more?  I expected better specials but again not terrible.  Better deals in Hoboken for sure but not bad in a pinch.
2014-09-30,4,Had a good time here on a Friday night! Beers are cold and the music is all from the radio. But when I'm having a couple I like to know every single song that plays. There is a cute area outside (see pic) but unfortunately it closes at 11:00 p.m. This a good place for dancing and mingling. Never ate here and I don't plan to do so. There is no cover and the drinks are moderately priced. It gets super crowed though!
2014-08-18,4,This is my favorite Thursday night spot. Great beer specials, the bartenders are super fast and attentive. Good music and great crowd.
2014-08-17,1,Do you enjoy spending $13 on a well vodka and cranberry? That's what I was charged for one at this fine establishment. It was the first and only drink I ordered, and for a friend since I was on antibiotics. I placed the order with the bartender who nodded, repeated the order back to me, and then walked away to take other customers' orders.  He then gave them their drinks and did not give me mine. He took more orders and continued to neglect mine. I had to wave him down again a few minutes later and ask him if he made my drink. He said "vodka cranberry, right?" and then--and only then--made my drink. He then charged me $13. For a well drink. I'm sorry, but that is absurd for an establishment like this. My shoes literally were sticking to the floor, it was so gross. Do you realize that that is a comparable price to those charged for (fancier) drinks in much more reputable spots in downtown Manhattan? I don't care if the bartender was having a bad day or didn't like my attire or whatever ridiculous reason was behind the crap service, bad attitude, and price. I'm never going here again. Ever.
2014-07-24,4,All you can eat oysters for $5 eh???? Starts at 5:30pm and the run out before 7, smh!!! It's a good place but when you advertise ALL YOU CAN EAT for $5 you better be prepared for some EATING... I gave 4 stars because it a good place to come but come on you guys need to buy more oysters.. Let's see how next Thursday goes.. TBD....
2014-07-23,4,Can you really complain with $5 all you can eat wings on a Monday evening? - 3 choices including Buffalo, Sweet Chilli and Bbq sauces. You are served 5 wings each at a time, and when you request your next portion you have the option to choose a different type, which I thought was great! Good customer service and our server would ask if we wanted to order more before we had finished our plates. Cheap & cheerful. I believe they also do other $5 deals on other weeknights too.
2014-06-19,5,I visited this bar a few weeks ago after work on a Monday just to grab a drink with a friend. It was my first time there & I will for sure be going back. The bartenders were so friendly & funny. They made me feel like I was at a bar back at home in Michigan.. They have great weekly specials & good happy hour specials as well. The bartender said they're always open & never close early ever (which is a big plus for all of us that work in the same industry) and need a drink after work. My favorite thing that made me want to come back here is how friendly & welcoming the bartenders were.
2014-05-12,4,great place, a lot of interesting people there on a friday and satuday...
2014-03-14,4,This is such a great place!Its reasonably priced with a good selection of drinks and food.They were giving away complimentary drinks of gingerale and whiskey(forgot the exact name 2gingers?! I think) which actually tasted great.We tried the waffle fries with irish curry sauce(u hafta try that sauce),chicken bites and chicken pot pie(loved it).The music was great..very peppy.There was a pool table(cudnt play,someone else was already playing:().The servers were really friendly and fun to talk to.All in all,we had a great time here!Will probably be back on a monday for the $5 all you can eat wings!
2014-01-07,4,Went here on Saturday night with a group of 8 people for a birthday party.  I haven't been in years.  Cold beer, decent draft selection, pool table, and televisions everywhere to watch the game.  Sure why not.  Did not try any of the food.
2013-12-04,4,Great for weekend nights out as well as weekday specials.  Can't beat $5 sliders on Wednesdays.
2013-11-11,2,When all the lines were out the door at every awesome place in Hoboken this is your place to go usually. Its kind of tiny, and no one was utilizing the dance floor unfortunately. Maybe because it was early still? who know.Solid prices for a typical bar. every so often the DJ will yell out a special drink or shot and you can buy it at that time at a discounted price. For a place with no cover it was not that bad but not my favorite place in Hoboken. Nothing special, just a bar.
2013-10-06,1,Took me awhile but I've come to realize this place is quite terrible for Sunday Funday.Terrible railroad layout where everyone just stands around in the only walkway, blocking your view if you're at a hightop. I want to see the game, not your thinning hair or bald spot.If you're at the bar, be ready for people reaching around (not in a handjob way), bumping you, or breathing/sneezing/coughing on you. I get you assume some of this by sitting at the bar, but it's constant.The bartenders used to do a good job of giving buybacks to people they see every week. Put in your time, spend an afternoon there, get a complimentary beer because your patronage is appreciated. Must be hard times or the bartenders just don't like me (both entirely possible) but, damn, I've helped support their smoking habits for, like, 4 years now and nothing anymore. And, goddamn, it's MePa prices now.Playing DJ at every commercial break? Yes, please, crank up the jams! I do not know how I could get thru 30 or 90 second spots without them. I DON'T CARE, I LOVE IT. Woohoo, hey girls hey!The crowd is brotastic maximus. You want to hear about fantasy football, black outs, frat life, or quotes from "old school," "wedding crashers," or "anrchorman" (yeah, people still think it's funny to quote those) then this is your place. Ladies, I feel so, so bad that you've settled for "that guy." It's a "Pats bar" in that they put the sound on, but not like you'll hear much (see above paragraph). There is nothing to really engender the team spirit or camaraderie. No raffles, door prizes, specials, or anything imaginative. We all should mobilize to take our business elsewhere (but we're all too lazy, myself included). If you're a Pats fan in the HOB and want to relocate, contact me, let's do it. F this place.
2013-09-12,2,This is a decent bar/sports bar, but it is in NO WAY a Patriots bar. My experience there was two guys in Pats jerseys, and then some tepid support of the Pats. Again, there were some good drink/food specials and the staff was attentive, but as far as watching the game, it was not a special experience. I'll have to continue to go into the city for the real Boston sports bars.
2013-09-06,5,5 dollar all you can eat wings Monday: actually worth the bargain because there delicious!! Ask for Diana, best bartender there!
2013-08-28,2,if you like overcrowded bars that smell like vomit 24/7, then this is the place for you! It amazes me how expensive drinks are at this place. Let me save anyone considering a night out to McSwiggan's the trouble: there's nothing special here. This place is a prime example of many bars that attract large crowds simply due to convenience and location. If you want a decent place to go to with a less trashy crowd, go right across the street to Marty O'Brien's Social Club. The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the sheer brilliance of its location. It really is the best place if you use it as a jumping-off or pre-game spot before the bar gets PACKED. One more thing. Be very careful going down the stairs to the bathroom.
2013-08-03,4,hmmmm, there are reasons why i love and hate this place all at the same time. If this place didn't get sooooo freakin crowded, i would love it. They play great music, good bartenders, and good times. ON Fridays and Saturdays, it gets to the point where i feel like i'm back at college frat parties b/c the crowd is usually young and they pack in people like none other. When it gets that crowded, i just have to leave. However, I do always try this place out b/c i like to dance my butt off!
2013-07-24,4,$5 all-you-can-eat Oyster Thursdays is all you have to know!I was somewhat hesitant to try out of fear those oyster may have been fished out of Hudson but after braving 2 meals, I was hooked. My only complaint is the waiter service - apparently there's a rule that they can't put in another order until your plate is clean and some waiters/waitresses are sticklers for enforcing this rule.The do not advertise their weekday specials anymore - well at least not anywhere a human eye can see but rest assured, all you have to do is ask. Really relaxed atmosphere during weekdays happy hour, decent prices and a diverse menu - highly recommend this place!
2013-07-10,2,A mediocre bar in Hoboken.  I rarely, if ever go here.  The service is less than stellar and the food is blah.  They have some oyster special, but I dont know if I would trust the quality.  The drinks are watered down and overpriced.  But, if you like bad music and too many dudes, this may be the place for you.
2013-06-28,4,I have to say I only go during the weekdays, because it gets to crazy for me, but I absolutely love coming here. This place makes me feel like family and the bartenders here are one of the best in town!!!
2013-05-14,4,Part of the "Irish Corridor" in Hobo.  This one is a usual stop in the nightly bar hopping.  I enjoy it because I know what to expect when coming here.  Its a little crowded, they play decent music, and the bartenders actually are speedy in service.  Definitely not an "upscale" place but just a good stop on a casual night of bar hopping. *Enjoy
2013-05-08,4,Those 4 stars only apply to their monday night special - $5 all you can eat wings! I'm a sucker when it come to wings, this deal is like a gift from heaven. They have three wing flavors - BBQ, buffalo, and sweet chilli. BBQ  is my favorite, not a fan of their buffalo, way too salty. But for $5, it's all good! One down side is that they serve you wings plate by plate, 5 wings pre plate. You might need to wait for awhile before you get your next plate.
2013-03-17,4,This is a fun cute little bar hidden in Hoboken away from the main street of bars.  The servers are EXCELLENT and the drinks are great and the food is even better.My friends and I celebrated St. Patrick's Day there yesterday and had the time of our lives from 11 am until about 8 pm.  It was a great day and McSwiggan's made it so much more fun for us.
2013-01-12,3,I've been on a Wednesday and Friday night. I didn't have a bad time, but I don't think I'm the target demographic. Girls in their early 20's will do well here as there is an abundance of bros, cheap simple drinks, a lot of bathrooms to retreat and talk about said bros, and a DJ spinning lots of pop hits. Just be careful, it's dark in here so your "cutie" might actually be fug.
2013-01-03,4,A fun, reasonably priced bar with not too much hoopla, except of course for Pats games on Sunday! To my knowledge, the only New England Patriots bar in all of New Jersey, McSwiggans will always be my token Sunday destination. In fact, I held a long streak of being the very first customer in the door on Sunday mornings, anxiously awaiting the first Guinness of the day along with a hearty, and true to form Irish Breakfast.But so far the best thing about McSwiggans has been the service. Bartenders are speedy, fun, and accommodating. Sarah stands out as a fantastic bartender. My Guinness is already settling by the time I take my final sip. My only knock? She's a Giants fan, and proud to show it. She'll still reluctantly ring the bell whenever the Pats score. Got to give the people what they want.The food is pretty standard Irish pub fare, with sandwiches, appetizers, salads, and entrées like Shepherd's Pie and Bangers and Mash. I haven't had anything I haven't liked, though none of it will floor you. The menu is large enough to satisfy a broad range of palates, and the portions are large enough to satisfy a broad stomach.There is a pool table for the billiards enthusiast, loud music for the dancers looking to get down on a Friday night in Hoboken, and of course some crazy shooters, like Phoenix Bombs (borne out of the ashes of their previous venture, which burnt down some years ago) which involve pouring a shot of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum into a shot glass with a false bottom, perforated with small holes so that the rum drips on top of the cube or two of dry ice, causing a smokey effect. Then you drop it into half a glass of Fanta Orange. Seems to keep people happy, but I'll be sticking to my Irish booze.Gets very busy for football on Sundays. Although it is a Patriots bar, there isn't any Pats/Red Sox/Bruins/Celtics apparel draped on the walls or from rafters. If not for the sea of Gronkowski, Brady (including myself), and Welker jerseys mobbing the long bar on Sunday, you wouldn't have known it was a Boston bar. Furthermore, they show as many of the games as possible, and are relatively flexible about placing the games to accommodate fans of all franchises.
2012-12-04,3,After walking past a few other places bursting at the seams with people, I popped into McSwiggan's, which was completely the opposite with just a few visitors. No problem. I wasn't in the mood for a rowdy crowd anyway. I just wanted to relax and watch some football, which was exactly what happened.With decent drink selections, a pool table and friendly bartenders, this place is A-OK. I mean, any bar that will play James Blunt's "Beautiful" followed by NWA's "F&*k Tha Police" is certainly worth the unexpected experience.
2012-10-22,1,My friends and I sat down for NFL yesterday, and the entire afternoon was a comedy of errors.1. We asked what's good and the waitress suggested the chili nachos.  We later found out she doesn't eat meat so she wouldn't know if it was good or not.2. The nachos - NACHOS! - took 20 minutes to arrive in an empty bar3. Instead of chili nachos, they brought us chicken nachos.  So we asked & got a free cup of chili on the side.  The chili was terrible - just ground meat and a few beans.  No flavor or seasoning at all.4. We asked for Yeungling, since they had a special.  turns out they were out of Yeungling midway through the 1pm game, so we had to order another beer.5. I ordered a sandwich with Swiss instead of the American cheese it came with.  Turns out they were out of Swiss as well.Our waitress was good looking.  Other than that, I can't recommend this joint.  In a town full of bars, you gotta fix these problems or people won't come back.
2012-10-13,3,I would only come here on a weekday, really. I'm the kind of person that hates being smushed against 50,000,000 people when I stroll in on a weekend night. If that's your thing, you'll love it here - lots of pretty people and fun crowds, but it gets PACKED. The music is booming, the crowds are wild, and the bartenders heads are spinning.There's never a line outside and there's never a cover.
2012-09-02,3,McSwiggan's is, for lack of a better description, your typical Hoboken bar. I mean this not in a derogatory way (i.e. obnoxious drunk frat bros, fist pumpers, etc. etc.), but rather in an endearing way. It's a straightforward bar with club music, a crowded front area, and a good location.Getting inOne of the saving graces of this place is that there is never a line (compared to the Shannon next door, which almost always has a line after 11pm).  No cover, and as far as Hoboken bars goes, the dress code is pretty casual (tees, sneakers, etc.). The sceneAs I touched on earlier, picture in your mind the most "Hoboken" bar you can imagine: 21-29 year olds packed in near the bar, girls dancing and screaming along to "Call Me Maybe", bachelorette parties doing all sorts of crazy things, and Miller light bottles in everyone's hand. This is, in essence, McSwiggans.  It's fun for a bit, but if you're here with a group it's a bit tough to navigate since there are few places to sit down together.The music is again pretty much what you'd expect (house/rap mixes), although the last time I was there they put on some throwback hip hop and reggae, which pleasantly surprised me. The problem is that this bar is not really a dance spot, so at most you'll have people bopping along in place with the music rather than dancing (except for the "Call Me Maybe" girls).DrinksNo surprises; pretty standard Hoboken pricing ($4-5ish for bottle domestics).  If you can get to the bar, the bartenders are actually pretty quick about getting you a drink. The problem is since the bar takes up a good chunk of the front area, people will just set up shop and it gets hard to push towards the front.ProsNo line; no coverConsNothing amazing about it
2012-07-11,4,3 stars for drinks & price. 4 stars for everything else!It is a Red Sox written all over it kinda bar..which is cool! Has awesome crowd, and the people, bartender and the atmosphere is not as uptight as in Manhatten, NY.I liked the music since it was a healthy mix of pop with R&B and Hip-Hop...I found the drinks to be expensive..but then, afte being in all those NY clubs, I should not complain. Guess will be coming back here, but will be careful about opening a tab.
2012-06-12,3,I won't lie... I liked this place better before it burned down and was redone. Before the fire, this place was a chilly, POS dive bar where you were guaranteed to have a good time. Now, it is a trendy wanna be place. Is there a bunch of pretty people here? Yes. Is it pretentions? Absolutely. Will I come here again. Yes, I will, but not because it's a great place.. more because it is a scene where people come.
2012-06-05,2,I've never had a bad time here.  But I've never really had a great time either.  The bartenders aren't great, the beer selection is average, and the crowd can be annoying on the weekends.It's your average Hoboken bar.  Good in small doses or on a weeknight.
2012-04-15,2,Hey, I miss college as much as the next guy.  That said, McSwiggan's is the next best thing to a frat party.  With its rustic interior and good music, it's a great place for the young(est) crowds in Hoboken.  Bartenders were very efficient and friendly.  What can I say, I had fun.  Cons:  Gets incredibly crowded.  Phoenix Shots (overrated) are good, but at ten bucks each, you should stick to beer.  Good bar only in small doses.
2012-04-11,5,Been here on two separate, completely different nights. One was a Saturday night with some friends, the other was on my own to catch the Sox on a Monday. Both nights were great. The crowd on Saturday was fun as hell (as was the music) and nowhere near as stuck up as the Manhattan bars I'm used to. Monday was quiet and empty -- save for the birthday party at one of the tables -- but had live music from a pretty good guitar/vocal duo. And best of all, THEY PLAYED THE SOX GAME!! I know that won't make me many friends in the area, but, as a New England transplant, it's good to find some vestige of Red Sox Nation in enemy territory. Beer was reasonably priced and the service was great. Seamus is the man.
2012-01-05,4,Came here for Sunday Football. If you get a seat towards the center of the bar you'll have a nice view of a bunch of games. The only thing they screwed up in my opinion was switching to the 4:15PM games before some of the 1:00PM games were finished which meant that the end of the Lions/Packers shootout was not on anywhere!! There was a nice crowd there throughout the day but nothing crazy and it got really crowded and lively for the Giants/Cowboys Sunday night game. The food I had was good too. I had the Chicken Curry and then BBQ wings later. Definitely wouldn't mind coming here to watch games again.
2011-12-12,1,Be careful of stolen coats in this place!  Had my dad's old overcoat stolen here that he gave me many years ago and it was his favorite.  A very special coat to me.  So if you're the thief reading this, bring it back to this place, please!  You can keep my jcrew sweater that was stolen too.
2011-11-28,3,Expensive.. But the bartender was on his game and he got me my drinks quick quick quick. I appreciated this very much haha. Kinda danced right in front of the bar not tooooo much space.  Spent the rest of the night here and stayed after the bar closed with numerous people. You be the judge, but again if you're trying to save money and want doubles do not go here.
2011-10-25,4,Good times. Chill bar. I liked this spot because it feels like a good 'ol neighborhood bar and avoids the pitfalls of other more modern places with harsh lighting and too many tvs. Instead, on a weeknight, McSwiggins feels like a strangely intimate spot for locals to sit back and enjoy a beer, a game, or a convo - or perhaps a game of pool - without the young overly enthusiastic fist-pumpers rearing their ugly heads and ruining the vibe. Happy hour is a must do, especially with the $3.50 house ale. An enjoyable visit... I'd hit it up again!
2011-09-30,4,Yay! I'm a fan. A Boston fan that has found a sanctuary for all Bostonian's who want to watch their teams with other fellow fans. McSwiggan's is a sports bar that televises Red Sox games, Patriots games, and if there is a god, Bruins games. It gets packed on Sundays and Mondays when Football is on. Usually on Sundays the majority of the fans will be Patriots fans, however you will also find Bronco fans, Cowboy fans, and many others. It is like the bar that takes in all the fans who are displaced from their hometown teams.The place is pretty large on the inside and can hold a lot of people. The place has ample seating at the bar and the tables that are positioned around the place. The place will get pretty loud on Football days because of everyone screaming for their teams, but I think it just adds to that cool sports atmosphere. The prices are just like any other bar in Hoboken and they almost always have a drink special going on.The staff working there are very friendly and enjoy what they do. If they are not busy making sure everyone's glass is full, they will be cheering on their teams, talking with drunkies, or doing shots with people. some of the coolest bar staff I have ever met.Overall I gave McSwiggan's four stars because of their great staff, good atmosphere and yes I am going to be biased and say that they are getting it because they show Boston sports games. I highly suggest it for anyone who watches Boston sports teams and finds themselves the only one doing that in the place they currently go to.
2011-09-28,4,Happy Hours...gotta love em.-I've never been in this joint when there's light outside.  Its bigger than I thought, especially with the patio area open.-Last time I was here the bartender with the Irish accent asked my name and used it whenever I ordered drinks, this time, he shook my hand as soon as I sat down.  Keepin it classy, brah.-$3.50 for McSwiggan's draughts....uh, yea, I'll have a bunch.-Lots of TVs showing the BoSox blow it and miss the post-season.  This IS the home of Red Sox Nation in 'boken.You have to chaperone me again, Holly N(onsense).
2011-07-02,4,I was out with a friend last night and this place is super close to his apartment. It was a little crowded when we got there, but nothing ridiculous. (It was also about 11:30). You know it's a good one when they play "Stereo Love" when you walk in. The bartenders were super cute and looked like they were having as much fun as most of us drunkards. My Ketel and Diet was stupid strong (no complaints, no complaints) and the random spurts of dancing that broke out were fun!
2011-04-07,5,I lived in Hoboken for a very long time... most of my 20's (when Red Bull & vodka came out of my mouth as much as 'just a beer') and spent a lot of time here.  Recently I was back in town for a wedding and some of the old crew got sitters and met us out.The place is still great.Patrick, who used to bartend down the block, is now here and somehow has more hair than before.  Same Patrick... quick with a smile and a drink, also has his eyes on who needs another and ready to point trouble out to the bouncers.Like I said, I lived in Hoboken a long time and experienced this bar at one time or another, every night of the week.  Each night is different, but each is great in its own unique way.  Will it get crowded on a Friday at 11:30?  Sure, but most decent bars in Hoboken will (even the un-decent ones).  Will is maybe attract out of towners who are less than cool?  Sure... you can't prevent that, it's Hoboken.  Honestly, like where I live now in San Diego, each bar has its time and place for everyone (at least I think so).  If you're not having fun here, you're in at the wrong time.But, 99 percent of the time this bar is fun all of the time, with good people, music, drinks and beer.  You don't have to be Irish to enjoy McSwiggans, but when you leave, you may wish you were.Keep up the great work guys.
2011-04-02,2,I hate how when I'm out in Hoboken somehow my friends and I always end up here. There are much better bars to go to. First of all this place is kind of dump, but at least the bathrooms are nice and clean. Also the drinks are over priced, the service is alright, but my main problem is that the music is loud and there are people dancing, but this bar is not really that kind of bar, and there are much better bars to go to in Hoboken if you want to dance. It's not the worst bar out there, but I would try some place else
2011-03-21,5,It was a pretty fun group, and got a bit busy-but the bartenders rocked, didn't get in a frenzy.Amanda was the best- her drinks rock hard core.Can't wait till next weekend to have me s'more!
2010-12-23,3,This one could just as easily be a 2 star or a 3 star. Most of the bartenders are lousy, drinks are steep for the type of place and mixed drinks are weak.  One or two good bartenders mixed in, so try your luck I suppose.Not sure what it takes to earn a buy-back here, but several hundred dollar tabs here have yielded none for me so far. Not an awful place but better choices around.
2010-12-23,3,Pre-Fire this was my favorite bar in Hoboken.  It used to border on being a dive, and it used to be far less crowded, two qualities that I liked about the place.  I don't want to criticize the owners for all the work they did after the fire, as I'm sure it didn't make sense to just restore the bar to it's prior state.  And the restorations really did make the bar far more attractive inside and out.  But...this also made the bar far more attractive to other people...which...well, let's just say I never say any Ed Hardy shit in there pre-fire.  For the record, there would be a 4th Star.  But they're a Pats/Sox bar.  And that shit is unforgivable.
2010-12-14,5,I really can't think of any cons for this place other than the fact it's kind of a pain to get to for Manhatanites but I can't hold that against them. I've been here twice for Sunday football games. This is a Patriots bar so be forewarned about that. I'm going there to watch the Patriots so this works out well for me. I usually get there with some buddies well before game time to make sure I have a table. They serve pitchers of beer and you never have to look for your waitress. Brunch is served all day which is always a big plus for me. The food I have tried there has always been excellent. Though mostly standard bar food, they have some other items as well. The wings are perfect, the waffle nachos are a great indulgence, and the pizza is awesome too (not great but perfect to satisfy you craving). We were there for so long we even got some shots on the house. There are plenty of TVs and they show almost every game, but will always have the sound on for the Pats, so make sure your team isn't playing when they are. The upstairs bathroom is also very clean which is a HUGE plus for anywhere around here. Though it's a pain to get to for NYCers, it's worth it if you plan on parking it for a while and don't feel like dealing with the crowds of the city.
2010-12-12,2,I happened to come here on a Saturday evening (7ish) for a few drinks. They played the same holiday playlist with the same 4 songs all night.  Very annoying.
2010-09-12,3,Saturday DAYTIME review!!  Please note that I wouldn't touch this place with a ten foot pole on a Saturday night. Pluses:TVs and plenty of them Outdoor seating with view of said TVs$15 buckets of Corona or Corona LightNice bathroomsCons: Crowd (Saturday daytime is bearable since it's not packed)Not-so-friendly table service waitstaffNot great, not bad...I'd go again on a sunny Saturday afternoon to watch a game but can't say I'd go there when it's dark out.
2010-06-28,4,So I happened to land here with a few friends during the day to watch the world cup game and I was pleasantly surprised at this shot in the dark. OWTR!!!!Decoration:Pretty much your standard Irish pub type of decor with flat screen tvs, bar stools, tables and a lot of beer decoration. Outside area was simple and had an added touch of privacy from the street thanks to a separation made by wall made of garden bush. Location:About one block away from Washington street away from the water, keeping you close to that frenzy but still out of the way and resting right on a corner. Food:Here is where I was definitely surprised! The food was very very good - the Swiggans "nachos" were great (even though they were actually waffle fries) - HUGE potato skins. Its all standard pub food - but all of it was done very right. Drinks: Again - Pleasantly surprised. Good selection and their specialty drinks were actually good. Nice tough on the "Ghetto" sangria (ghetto because it contains no fruit) as it tastes good, and I come from Sangrianation. Price:Affordable and will not break your pocket. Standard prices and even the specialty drinks were not crazy, considering their size. Staff:Ok - here is where there was a bit of a screw up. The staff was VERY VERY courteous - but VERY VERY inattentive - and VERY VERY Irish. If they were not understaffed, then something was not right. There was not a significant amount of people to cause a few disappearing acts by the waitress, but I do state that later on, she did remember us. Again - this area takes a low score because her service was slow - but not lacking courtesy. Ambience and Crowd:I came here during a soccer game and it was pretty much your local restaurant owned by a friend. Big mix of people, even had a dog taking a nap in the outside area. Very casual, comfortable and enjoyable. Good soccer fans too. I'd have to return for a nightlife version of this category.Overall:Cool spot that is perfect for a mid day hang out with friends for eats, drinks and pre-game for a festivity. One can definitely hang out here for hours in a social foray of conversation, food and drinks. Pros:Great foodGood drinkOutside areaGood sizeGreat sports ambianceIrish staffCons:Disorganized serviceNowhere to parkH-Cane Final Spin:Again -for a daytime kinda joint this was the perfect place. In the mood for some bar food and a beer? This is a good selection. Simplicity executed very well. Grab a Guinness, grab some chips, grab some friends and take a round of Jameson during your discussion about why there is only one female Smurf.
2010-06-07,2,This place needs a new attitude.  For a bar in Hoboken they are Way Way Way over priced.  I was paying $5 for domestic beer.  The food is OK at best.  Why people go here I will never understand.  There are so many better places with better prices that you can walk to.
2010-05-24,3,Went here on a Saturday night. Place was a packed. Music was good. Had to wait on line to get in, but it moved at a pretty good rate. Bouncer even let me leave to make sure my gps was hidden without going back on line. I wouldn't say they did anything wrong to get 3 instead of 4 stars, but the place is essentially a big room, with loud music, with 4.5 bud light bottles. Nothing special there. FYI If you open a tab, there is a 5 drink minimum.Might try again, but wouldn't go all the way to Hoboken to come again.
2010-04-23,4,Where do you go on a rainy monday night in Hoboken?  McSwiggans.(1) there were actually women(2) there was a solid live band(3) the bartenders took care of us like we were their own (thank you ladies for helping us build a scotch castle btw)(4) they let us sit in with the band (I sang, extra instrument for by wingman.  Thanks guys)(5) plenty of sports on flatscreens(6) great pool table and darts in the back.'nuff said.
2010-04-11,3,Went out for a friend's bday. Nothing special. No place really to dance, but they played good music. Prices were okay I guess -- a beer, 2 vodka clubs for $31? Seemed a little NYC to me, but Hoboken likes to pretend they are.The male to female ratio is insane and def. the best reason to go here. While Positive K may have said, "I got a man", my friends sure don't and I left and grabbed a cab back to my favorite island just as they were all starting to talk to prospective suitors.
2010-03-20,2,ehhhh.... i always end up here for some reason, then never have that great of a time..drinks are weak (not enough alcohol at all)... and the old blonde woman who bartends there is the most evil woman i have met in my life. always has a nasty comment towards my friends and i for no reason at all -- told us to "do her a favor and order from another bartender next time" because i didn't get out my debit card fast enough -- give me a break.another time, i asked the bartender to please put more vodka in my drink -- it tasted like pure cranberry juice. to be facetious, he took the bottle of vodka and poured enough in to kill a 300-lb man. ridiculous.anyway, head down the street to mulligans and skip the line AND this place.
2009-12-07,3,This place is always packed. I didnt know it pre-fire, but now its crowded and busy. The crowd is rowdy the dancing is random and sporadic and we can all take bets on which dood with geled hair will take home which girl with big hair. No it's not really my scene but its a good time. Drinks aren't terribly priced and the staff is polite. When I review a bar in Hoboken I need only compare it to green rock to find if its piss poor or not, since green rock is the epitome of crappy Hoboken bars. On that I give Mcswigggans C-
2009-10-11,5,Swiggs is a great pub for it's atmosphere and food.  They have a glorious version of fully loaded chili nachos with waffle fries substituted for chips.  Heaven in your mouth.Cool patio space for the warmer months and the nicotine dependent.For you sharks out there they have a pool table area all nights with plenty of stick room, unlike Hobson's.Sláinte!
2009-03-31,3,Ever since the renovation, this place has been more packed than it's original building.  And even more so when the weather is nice and they open the windows to the outdoor seating (but they have to close those windows and have everyone come in by 11pm).It's really nice, they did a great job in the design of the place.  The inside looks very ski lodge-y and all of the windows open up into the outdoor seating during nice weather.The food is good too.  The sliders are one of the best mini-burger appetizers I've ever had.  Curry fries are awesome.  Wings are good.But because this place gets WAY too packed especially late night, I want to give it only 3 stars.  Come on, it's friggin' Hoboken, there shouldn't be any kind of WAIT at the door.  LAME.
2009-03-19,4,I forgot to update this late last year when it reopened and say that it looks more upscale than before  Definitely the it place to be during nice weather since they now have plenty of outdoor seating.I have only been in for a drink but the crowds are back and enjoying themselves with enough noise to have the neighbors complain.  Still have to try the food -- but friends say it is better than ever.
2008-11-11,4,I thought McSwiggan's was decent for a "dive" bar. It apparently burnt down about a year ago, and expanded their square feet in the renovations process, heightened the ceilings and added a pool table in the back. They have tons of large, flat screen tv's which is good for watching sports. It kinda has a log cabin-esque atmosphere which I liked!
