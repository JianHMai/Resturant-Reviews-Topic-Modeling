2021-10-24,1,Shocking how poor the service is here. The food is hit or miss. I've had a good steak a couple times but I've also had a terrible steak a couple times. Last time I tried going the girl at the entrance was so disengaged and aloof that I decided I will never go back. Past experiences with the service weren't great so I won't be giving Dino and Harry's another chance despite having lived in town for many years and my overall desire to support local businesses. Wish they would take heed to the reviews that are online because the service is commonly panned
2021-10-17,1,Owner is arrogant disrespectful uncontrollably unstable. The place is so disorganized I would never ever recommend this establishment to anyone out of 1 to 10 I give this restaurant to one. On top of all that we saw two Cockroaches.
2021-10-14,3,I have been coming once a year  every year for years .I feel its not as special as it used to be. Service not as good  or attentive food quality has gone down.Ceasear salad nothing  special not even flavorful. Steak was good.i think I'll try someplace new next time!
2021-09-17,1,Without a doubt the worst steak I've ever been to.  The customer service was lacking and it should be a crime to charge $50 bucks for the steak that turned up (overcooked and full of fat).  Save your cash and go find a real steak house in the city.
2021-09-11,3,Friday night dinner outside for 4 in September.   Food was good and porterhouse for 3 was well cooked.  However, the bill contained a $30 fee for paying with a credit card.  Really?  We spent $377 on dinner for 4 and we are getting charged a giant fee? And without communication.  Not ok.  Will not return.
2021-09-01,5,We were a big group, went on a Saturday night and managed to get an outdoor table.  Inside was packed and I would not have enjoyed it, crowded and noisy.  For a steak eater, this place is as good as it gets.  For others, salmon and shrimp dishes were the same as were the salads and side dishes.  Service was attentive.  Portion size was very good.  Prices were on the high side.  Parking was a major pain.  There's a private lot a block or two ago.  Street parking is tricky and whoever designed the parking signs on the streets must have been drugs.
2021-08-11,5,This was our first visit to Hoboken, and I never want to eat anywhere else.  Wow, what a great experience!  We are very choosy about our restaurants since my wife is an amazing cook, and Dino and Harry's did not disappoint in food, service or ambiance.  Apart from the steaks and appetizers,  I was very impressed by the quality of the wines for what I thought were reasonable prices.   My family and I met an old friend I hadn't seen in many years and his wife, and Dino and Harry's made the evening perfect.
2021-08-06,3,Came on a Saturday night. Ordered fried calamari to start, medium rare porterhouse for 2, creme brulee corn, gnocchi, and creamed spinach. Everything was just Ok. Nothing was bad, just not amazing. Porterhouse came out medium rare on the strip side but well done on the filet side. Service was mediocre - waitress was not that attentive. Did not leave feeling like I had to go back anytime soon.
2021-07-19,5,love the service. delicious food. I would recommend you to try, especially Salmon! I loved it. Thank you.
2021-06-25,4,I don't normally go to steak houses because I think it's a huge rip off, but this was a special occasion for work and I'm surprised to say that I was satisfied with my dinner here. My table ordered the octopus, calamari, and empanadas to start. The octopus was fantastic. Extremely tender and cooked to perfection. Calamari was great as well. The empanadas were just okay. I ordered the 16oz porterhouse and it was very good. They cooked it exactly how I asked (medium rare) and I enjoyed every bite of it. All sides are a la carte. Dino & Harry's is your classic, upscale neighborhood steakhouse.  So, if you're feeling bougie and in the mood for a good steak, this is the place for you.
2021-06-20,2,Used to be good but service has completely fallen off. If you're not friends with the owner, forget it. You'll have to wait forever for a table. Also don't even bother trying to use the website for pickup or delivery. Doesn't work.
2021-06-04,1,Absolutely horrible, this is the most expensive restaurant in all of New Jersey and most in NYC. The quality and taste of the food does not justify the price either. They also try to sneak 20% fees for credit cards on top of tip. The owner was so disrespectful, rude and treats his customers like trash. Would not go back to this place if anyone paid me.
2021-05-22,5,I honestly can't believe there would even be a single review under 5 stars for this place. Everything about it is terrific, from the ambiance to the staff, and of course the incredible food. Highly recommended.
2021-05-15,1,Disappointed is the word that comes to mind. Here is a full review on food, pricing, service and attitude: 1. Food: we ordered appetizers, dinner and dessert tonight. Crab and Avocado app was a 8/10. Good taste but bad presentation. Filet cooked right for medium rare and scallops golden well: 9/10. Sides: Brussels sprouts bad. Spinach ok. Corn good. 6/10. Desserts were not intricate and lacked a decadent taste: 3/10. 2. Pricing: It was expensive for the overall experience. 3. Service: I like to keep in mind covid so in 2020-2021 I don't hold it against most restaurants. I was disappointed that the waitress did not explain a 20% gratuity on a table of only 6 not 8. In addition, there was a credit card fee of $20.00 I have never seen. We split the bill among couples and each CC got charged $20.00!! 4. Attitude: when we noticed the $60.00 up charge it was brought up to the owner/Manager. Rather than explaining he went on the offensive escalating it into a heated argument. We asked how/when it was disclosed about this up charge since not on the menu and not pointed out by the waitress. They pointed to one small sign on the side window behind the door that is typically open. It simply doesn't add up for a fine dining experience. I recommend skipping this restaurant. Spend your money on a local place where they treat you right and the food is better than your own grill.
2021-05-15,1,What a rip off. Manhattan prices and inferior food. Stale bread. Mediocre dessert.  Filet was not up to par. For the prices they charge  it's a steal. To add insult to injury they charge extra 3.5 percent credit card fee and neglect to mention it    never going back
2021-04-25,3,So underwhelmed. Seems like they just couldn't get anything right. Brought the wrong wine, greasy flavorless tuna tartare, medium rare meat was charred on the outside and cooked through, no mask on our server, didn't even have paper towels in the bathrooms and had to hunt for toilet paper. Expect so much better for the price. Who's running this place? Solidly mediocre food and service.
2021-04-21,1,Very disappointing.  Steak was tasteless and pasta was ordinary.  Very expensive.  Def not worth it.
2021-04-06,4,Excellent tomahawk for two. I would return for a date and to try more cuts of meat. Oysters maxwell were tasty too.
2021-03-21,5,Hi,    Is Dino and Harry's the "former" Frankie and Johnnies steak house?
2021-03-20,5,Went to Dino and Harry Thursday for dinner again another amazing meal and service try the corn creme brûlée wow
2021-03-14,5,My friends and I came here for dinner and it was some of the best food I've ever had. All the staff were very friendly and accommodating. Nick served us and gave awesome menu recommendations and attentive service. We all tried a bit of everything and the porterhouse and gnocchi were incredible. Great drinks as well. The food is definitely worth the price. Will definitely be coming back often!
2021-03-10,5,Came here in February for a night out with friends. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did have plastic barriers between tables allowing everyone to feel a bit more comfortable. We showed up right on time and were seated immediately.Food:Everyone got steaks, i got the prime burger. We also had oysters and a few sides. My burger was fantastic, you can tell there was a nice mix of meat and it was cooked exactly how i asked. As for everyone else's food, everyone had nothing but good things to say. Plating was beautiful, and everyone's order came out perfect with nothing to send back. Service:We were seated immediately, and the waiters were hanging in the background to take our orders as soon as we were ready. I was happy the food came out quickly.Atmosphere:The restaurant was definitely at capacity, they had the plastic barriers between tables but it still seemed a bit crowded, especially around the front door. Crowds of people waiting to be seated seemed constant throughout the night, i do wish it was a bit emptier but i felt comfortable personally and it was not a big deal. I did not use the restroom but i was told it was clean, the front of the house was also clean and i had no issue with anything. Overall this place was great. I think the prices are a little high but you get what you pay for. The food was delicious and you're eating at an upscale Hoboken steak house. I would absolutely recommend this place, and i would come back. Nice work Dino... Harry, you get the pass this time
2021-01-30,5,What an amazing place to eat! The ambiance is so pretty and relaxing and the food is even better. I made a reservation for my boyfriends birthday this past weekend and we were fully taken care of from the minute we sat down!Make sure to order the Trio of Empanadas, they're delicious, I'm still thinking about them now. The lamb chops were so good and the porterhouse steak was mouth watering! We ended the night with a chocolate lava cake that melted in your mouth, and definitely filled you up!Thank you so much for such an amazing night and experience, we will definitely be coming back again.
2021-01-24,5,We ventured to Hoboken to try this place and it was worth it! Cute ambiance, food was excellent - I would highly recommend
2020-11-09,5,I dined outside last Friday night and it was a great meal!  Their outdoor heaters work very well, but it wasn't too cool of a night and we got through most of the meal without using it.   Service was very good and our waiter was helpful answering questions.  I started with the french onion soup and my friends shared the chopped salad.  It was nice they split the salad onto two plates without us asking since they knew they were sharing it.  The soup was delicious. For our mains, we each got the petite filet medium rare and we shared sides of the mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts with bacon.  Was the right amount of food and everything was cooked perfectly. After dinner, we were able to go inside and grab a couple empty seats at the bar for one last round of drinks - they have live music on Fridays so we got to hear the end of their set.  Such a great night!
2020-10-31,4,Rarely eat beef and the night we came here Steak was calling us . We searched up steak and found this place on the top of the list when we searched in Hoboken and I'm glad it did. The host was our waiter and he did a good job managing both since the place wasn't too packed and the atmosphere was very quaint and peaceful. We ordered the porterhouse for two which was absolutely delicious and wet down like butter prior to that we had the wedge salad as a starter with some old fashions. The drinks were just average (wifey liked them, ask for no ice) I would probably stick to beer or wine that's the only reason I gave it a four star. Service was great we also ate a side of spinach and finished the night off with some cappuccinos which were actually surprisingly coffee House material if not better lol. I'm glad to say that we will be returning whenever we have a craving for some banging ass steak
2020-10-24,1,I read so many wonderful reviews and had high expectations of this place, but it was simply NOT GOOD. We waited 45 minutes and finished appetizers before receiving a drink, which we ordered as soon as we sat down. We kindly asked for more bread and were told we couldn't have more because it was "being rationed," and were later told they "ran out" as we watched another table being served bread. The drinks are not good, the food is mediocre and the service is painfully slow. If you're looking for a good steakhouse - go elsewhere. Not worth your time or money. We had to send back one of our drinks after waiting 45 minutes for it as it literally tasted like water. The "truffle" gnocchi tasted like it hadn't touched a truffle in its life. The waitress was sweet, but that didn't make up for everything else. This is a hard pass.
2020-09-28,5,Dino and Harry's has always been exceptional. I've had family dinners here, dinner with friends from out of town and most recently dinner at the bar with my boyfriend. The steaks are amazing (porterhouse for two).. Also love the cod, octopus, burrata. So much good stuff. Great wine by the bottle & martinis. Very kind bartender and owner.
2020-08-15,5,Took the boys and wife/significant other out to this wonderful restaurant last night for a bday celebration.Lovely waiterBill came and didn't review, simply left 20%. Didn't realize tip was included with 6 or more. Left. The restaurant credited back the 20%.Remarkable; maybe there is still honor in the country.Kudos.
2020-06-29,3,I had their porterhouse for 2 ($94) and oysters. I thought it was so-so. It wasn't not good but I was a little disappointed because I thought maybe that would be my go-to steakhouse in the area. I feel like I would rather go to a nyc steakhouse with the price and quality I get.
2020-06-27,4,Food:5 starsCocktails: 5 stars Wine list: 3 stars (short list for steakhouse)Price: 4 stars (typical steakhouse price but 48oz steak used to be $98 for two. Now it's $140 for 3.)Desert: 3 stars (lack of variety)Decor: 4 starsTheir new porterhouse for 2 36oz $78 is too thin compared to their old on 48oz. Not happy that Dino changed the old 48 oz for 2 to 3, then raised the price from $98 to $140. Still very good steak. May need to get the 48oz again next time even if my family don't finish them.
2020-06-22,4,I had been to Dino & Harry's Steakhouse years ago for a charity dinner, but had not been back since.  However, my recent visit was also my first time dining out as restaurants reopened after the pandemic.  We were a bit hesitant to sit outside, surrounded by other diners, but the tables were just far enough apart, and actually more spread out than at other restaurants nearby.  Our server and all of the food runners wore masks and gloves, which we appreciated.When our bread basket arrived, I tepidly reached into it, pushing my germ uncertainty aside for a bite of Italian bread.  Sadly, it was dry and not very fresh.  My disappointment was redeemed with an excellent glass of Cabernet Sauvignon that was fruity, smoky, and a perfect pairing to my upcoming steak.  I was not entirely sure who had crafted the glorious wine, but the dinner check referenced the name "1919 Cabernet"; through a quick Google search, I would assume that this was Lopez Noceti's 1919 Cabernet Sauvignon from Mendoza, Argentina, a region typically more well-known for its Malbecs.  In terms of the food, I could not have been happier with my 6 oz. Petit Filet Mignon.  It was cooked to a perfect medium temperature with a crisp and lightly salted crust, as well as a generous topping of sautéed mushrooms.  My side of Sautéed Spinach had the ideal texture and was not mushy at all.  There were shavings of garlic cloves sprinkled in for an added kick.  I also sampled the French Fries, which had a flavorful hint of salt, but were a bit too fried for my liking.Overall, though, I really enjoyed my meal and first night out in quite some time.  The steak and spinach were both excellent, and I look forward to enjoying them again soon.
2020-05-22,2,I was so excited to order from Dino & Harry's for my brother's quarantined birthday! But after my experience, I don't think I'll order again which makes me really sad because I went by majority of the reviews and was expecting good food especially for the price I paid. The porterhouse steak for 2 was very bland, all I tasted was butter. The panko chicken cutlet tasted very VERY plain, no seasoning at all. The blackened salmon was pretty decent, it came with a side of tomato and avocado slices in a vinaigrette. I was honestly expecting larger portions of the sides...Spinach, asparagus, mash potatoes, au gratin, Mac & cheese....So disappointed with the Mac and cheese! If you're looking for plain, bland foods, then this must be a good spot for you. New York prices, just not worth it.
2020-03-02,4,Rarely do I ever find myself venturing out in uptown Hoboken. On this rare occasion, I went for a friends birthday party. Dinner reservations were all set for a Friday night at Dino and Harry's. This being my first time at the restaurant I got there early and scoped the place out. The restaurant reminded me of an old school saloon filled  with wooden decor and a piano front and center. To start we wanted wine, RED WINE. The waiter offered us some of his favorites and we went with those (they didn't disappoint). We then  ordered a bunch of appetizers as there were eight of us. Clams, mussels, and calamari-the usual for a group of Italians. Seafood can be hit or miss especially at a steakhouse but this place really nailed it! Now for the steaks. Most of us ordered the surf and turf special (SEE BELOW). The steak was one of the most juiciest flavorful cuts I've ever had in New Jersey. The lobster tail was equally as tasty as it successfully complimented the dish. The only negative I have to point out is that the price of the steaks was similar to New York steaks but didn't match up to the quality of the meat. Overall great meal and great ambience making for a great night.
2020-02-18,4,3.5 stars. The drinks and apps were great. The utensils could have been cleaned better, they had some food bits. For being a steakhouse, they didn't do a great job with the done-ness of the steaks. My medium rare didn't have much pink if any, and my friends had similar issues. The staff was very polite and helpful which was nice.
2020-02-08,5,I must say that I love this plaace. The food is amazing and the service is great. The prices are fare for the quality of food. The drinks are great. Nice people. Great vibe
2020-02-02,5,One of our favorites Uptown places for dinner and drinks.  Classy old school type of steakhouse with amazing steaks (love their porterhouses to share), fabulous sides (thick cut bacon , potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach and my all time favorite, corn brûlée).For less formal dinners, grab a seat at the bar and any of the bartenders will make you a perfect dirty martini while you wait for your food.  For dinner, they also have a very impressive wine list.Friday night features live music and always packed.Come for the atmosphere, stay for the food and drinks.   this joint!!!!
2020-02-02,4,Celebrated a friend's birthday here with friends. The bar and restaurant is a beautiful space. I ordered off the restaurant week menu and had the kale, arugala salad, the cheese ravioli with mushroom sauce and apple crisp. Wow..the ravioli was delicious! Hubby had snowboken for dessert which was fantastic! Apple crisp was large, hot and crispy. We had a great night! Thank you!
2020-02-02,4,Service was wonderful although we went on a late Thursday night. After reading reading about a rude waitress I was a little worried when the only waitress (all others were waiters) happened to be serving us but she was great!! My husband's steak was a little overdone and she gladly brought him a new one. I had the grilled shrimp entree which was sort of a salad but way better! far beyond my expectations and really delish. The ambiance is nice, think rustic steakhouse (steakhouse meets pub?) rather than mod steakhouse. Price was okay but also my only major negative because I felt like it was NYC prices
2020-01-30,5,What an amazing time I had with my family and friends, and D & H helped to make our time  together  the best ! Food Was delicious, my steak made to perfection. And a  yummy  apple crisp and snowboken. Deserts.Customer  service was friendly and attractive.   Well  done, I can't wait to come Baal soon.
2020-01-23,4,My 1500th review goes to Dino and Harry's!It was my fiancé's Dad's birthday and we were looking for a last minute dinner spot after Augustino's gave our table away. We found a reservation for Dino and Harry's so it was perfect - we've been meaning to check it out anyway. It was MLK Jr. Day so it was pretty empty at around 6 pm. To start, they brought us the best bread basket ever. It included hot/freshly baked rolls, bread sticks (the crunchy sesame ones), and flat bread crisps. It was nice that they provided a variety. For food, we ordered a bunch of things to share amongst four people. We ordered the Scallops (roasted cauliflower, Pearl barley with a morel mushroom sauce). The scallops were perfectly cooked but a little too salty. Luckily, the rest of the dish was not. I loved the creamy mushroom sauce. Paired with the Pearl barley, it was very innovative. For steak, we did the 32 oz Porterhouse. The menu says it's for two people but this with the scallops and two sides was more than enough for us. We even had leftovers. The steak was good but pretty oily - probably the reason why we all filled up rather quickly. Creamed spinach and brussel sprouts with applewood smoked b weacon were the sides we picked (all sides are $10 each). The creamed spinach was a bit off to me. For some reason, it tasted minty to me (it was just me though). Surprisingly, I enjoyed the brussel sprouts even though I normally don't like them. Food was good overall, service was great - definitely don't mind coming back for another special occasion.
2020-01-19,5,Great atmosphere, great for date night or just a drink at their bar - however , u have to stay and enjoy something off the menu   . As some say NYC prices however you get what pay for. I have tried many dishes on their menu and it NEVER  disappoints.Drinks: are not weak and all properly prepared   Porterhouse; always made to your liking fresh and tender Pasta; perfectly made al dente Thick cut Bacon ( appetizer)   It's very thick cut and has a greaT flavor to open the palate for the main course Grilled  Octopus;  is very good, just wish it was a larger piece .Lamb chops: wow !   They are large pieces perfectly  chard on the outside and med inside ( as requested )  They are my new favorite  at Dino's Desert: are light and just the right amount to share                I personally enjoyed the  lava cake more over     the cheese cake Over all great staff and very attentive  , The only complaint  you might have is the wait for a table, however  it will be worth the wait.
2020-01-14,1,The food is not the problem here. By the way, its good steak. My fiance and I went to dinner here with a friend of ours who is pregnant. We were early for our reservation but the door staff wouldnt seat us until 30 minutes after our reservation. The part that really dissapointed us was that it was a busy Friday night and our friend was not offered a seat at the bar or a chair to wait, and when we asked kindly for an update we were given a dismissive response. Our friend was great about it and didn't make a deal of it despite having to stand in a crowded bar for a half hour, but I found it to be the least compassionate service I've ever encountered- especially when we already had a reservation.Just know this is what to expect if youre expecting.
2020-01-04,3,Walked in early on a weekday, empty. Needed a table for dinner. Host said "we are booked". I laughed. He was serious. Ok, then he worked some apparent magic to get us a table. He said reservations are pouring in now. Ok, gotcha. Hours later after we finished a full steak dinner with apps and dessert, the tables surrounding us were only partially full. Next time Mr. Host, make your guests feel welcome, not like you are doing them some grand favor. Food: steak good, oysters great, wine list ehhh. Sides good. Dessert, abysmal. The bread pudding was microwaved rubbery crapola. Sent back and said no way. Price: higher than NYC prices, holy moly bring your Amex.
2020-01-03,4,4 STARS, but be careful at the bar...The drinks are always good and the steaks are excellent. However, my 3rd time as a single man attending the bar I have felt highly judged due to my age or possibly looking younger than the rest of the crowd. I am in my mid 30s, but have frequented the dining room numerous times and always enjoyed. Most recently for a Christmas dinner which was amazing.Unfortunately, as mentioned my 3rd time at the bar continues to be terrible. I usually sit down around 6pm when it is half full. I order my drink and I am the only one asked if they would like to start a tab. I have never refused and gladly hand a card over. Tonight, I realized I was the only one when an older man and wife made a joke that they thought I was being carded. Everyone else who closed out before me was given a check and then handed a card to the bartender.All this aside, the bartender than asked me to move over after another man sat down. The guy (who I assume frequents) laughed and said sorry I did not tell her to say that. I said no problem at all and moved again after I had already moved when he sat down. The bartender obviously has never seen the front of her bar and does not realize that there is a large piece of wood protruding from the corner edge where I was seated. I had already moved down 5 minutes earlier for a female to have room so she would not hit her knee on the bar corner.I was going to let it go, but the bartender in a condescending tone states you had a lot of room. Again, there is a large wooden engraved piece of the bar that is at the corner. No one can sit at it comfortably. Just terrible service at the bar for anyone looking under 40-50. 4 stars for the food and drink, but I took my business to the usual Madison's or Bin. Won't be back as a single person at the bar. By the way, never offered a menu, because I assume she thinks people in their 20/30s can't afford steak.Thank you to the dining staff!
2019-12-21,5,One of the best steaks I've ever had!! The flavor radiating through the entire steak. There was a 30 minute wait and we waited exactly 30 minutes. Everything was so on point if you're looking for a great meal in the Hoboken New York City area with a great atmosphere I would totally recommend this place. The waitress was friendly the bartender was friendly everyone in the restaurant made us feel comfortable and we had a great experience.
2019-12-07,5,I've been to a lot of top steakhouses in NYC, but I must say this spot in Hoboken really rivals the best.  The atmosphere sets the tone for your elegant with a dash of old-fashioned steakhouse meal.  The service is top-notch.  The bacon appetizer is a can't miss.  We ordered the porterhouse steak for 3 and both sides of the steak were incredible.  We enjoyed the sides of potatoes lyonnaise, Mac and cheese and asparagus.  This was our second visit and we will be certain to return again soon.
2019-11-16,1,New York prices. Jersey service. Take a Pass! Arrived on time for reservation and sternly told to wait at the bar. The bar is crowded so stood around. Hostesses/Maitre D are downright rude. Food is good to very good. Service is basically summed up as "stack them high and move them out", waiter was ok but not fine dining. For a business dinner or special event you take a risk coming here.The mark up on the wine we got was almost 300% over retail.  I assume that is over 400% on wholesale. Really? Why?
2019-11-14,4,Excellent N.Y. style steakhouse in Hoboken. Food and drinks were great with a nice vibe in the place. Ribeye was great, service excellent too.
2019-11-11,1,Every single person in there was nice except our waitress. We were the first to arrive for dinner and were told that we can't sit by the window. She said because kids sit at the back but she'll sit us in the middle(of an empty restaurant). I should have walked out at that moment but I obliged. Her entire aura was just off-putting like she just didn't want to serve me but HAD TO. No matter how nice I was.We ordered the lamb and it came charred. At that point, I just asked for the bill(which she just dropped on the table and walked away) and left. I was the first customer of the day, how do you burn my lamb and still send it out to me? Shameful!! The prices are reasonable but the service sucks, don't waste your money.
2019-11-02,5,Delicious Saturday night dinner here! We arrived around 6:30 and sat at the bar for dinner. Ordered Blue Point oysters and a Ceaser to start followed by a Porterhouse for 2. Great service from the bartender and would definitely come again. You can't make reservations for groups under 5 on Saturdays so expect to wait for a drink at the bar before getting seated. If you don't like people for drinks during your meal I wouldn't recommend sitting at the bar.
2019-09-08,2,The food gets 5 stars!  The porterhouse, truffle gnocchi and mac and cheese were delicious!This is getting a 2 star from me not because of the food, but because of the waitress we had.  Her name was Charlotte and it was by far the worst service I've encountered at a dining establishment.  My boyfriend and I wanted to try this spot for a date night since we had never been but had good reviews.  We were sat pretty quickly and had our bread basket brought out.  Another couple was seated at a table right next to us about 10 minutes after we sat down.  Charlotte went straight to them to take their drink and appetizer order and then decided to acknowledge us.  We ordered our drinks and after receiving them, she did not come back for the rest of our time there.  Our food was brought, she didn't check in and ask if it came out ok or anything of the sort.  Meanwhile she's taking photos of tables, chatting up her other patrons in this section AND checked in with the table next to us multiple times.  The food runner was more attentive and had to be the one to offer us dessert.  Needless to say, we asked for the check and promptly left.  At the end of it, the one commonality of the patrons getting such good treatment, were Caucasian while my boyfriend is Ecuadorian and I am half Hispanic.  The fact I even have to go there with this is awful because I know there are way worse examples of prejudice and discrimination than what we encountered during our meal.  I hope that Charlotte learns that ALL her patrons deserve to be given proper attention when dining and she does not overlook the next round of diners who don't match her blonde self. Bottom line, if you go here, ask to be seated in the section that Charlotte does not work in. The food was amazing so we'll be back, but we will not sit in her section.
2019-08-23,1,This was one of the worst steakhouses I have been to in the area! Ordered a steak medium-rare and received it well-done+...Service and drinks was their saving grace, or I would have wished for a Zero Star. For $300 we had a very over-cooked Porterhouse and sides that seamed like they were from a frozen package.  The apps were good, highly recommend the empanadas or Shrimp, but if they don't change the chef, don't invest in a steak!
2019-08-05,5,About out fourth or fifth visit , and still have to say this is the best steakhouse we've been to . That would include topping Peter Lugers , Quality meats , and capital grille . Never disappoints . The bacon appetizer is still a must !!!
2019-06-25,1,Surprised I saw this place have over 3 stars. I came here last week due to the hype that wasn't worth it. Aside from the Piano player, everything else was subpar. The ribeye was not the steak house quality that I expected. This steak was about the same quality as Outback Steakhouse. It was not as big as some of the other steaks houses I've went to. All in all I paid $126 for a steak dinner that should've been about $25-30. I wouldn't recommend this steakhouse simply because it is over priced and over-hyped. I recommend saving the money and going to another establishment.
2019-06-22,5,Dino and Harry's is my favorite steakhouse in the area. I've gone multiple times, but tonight was the best considering we sat in the front of the house next to the piano. I went with my boyfriend and his brother, sister in law and their friends and we had a great time. Spent about 2.5 hours there just chatting and eating great food.The cocktails and bottles of wine were fantastic, along with our many appetizers and entrees. For appetizers we got 3 orders of the crab cracks, an order of the calamari, 2 orders of the Cesar salad and an order of the burrata. The crab cakes were big and had huge crab lumps in it and it was unanimously the best appetizer. The fried calamari and Cesar salad was also great, but at the same time very standard. Fried fish with a side of marinara, and the Cesar salad had shredded cheese on top with a few croutons. All very delicious.For my entree I shared the porter house for two with my boyfriend as we always do, and we agree it's the best porter house in the area. It's so juicy and there's always juice leftover on the side that I love to dip the meat in. Makes it so much more tastey. For sides we got the baked Mac n cheese, baked potato, sautéed broccoli and the Brussel sprouts with bacon in it. I only got the taste the Mac n cheese and it was so creamy and was topped with a crispy layer of panko. Everything else looked so delicious but I was too full to even try them.Aside from the food, the ambiance and was fantastic and the live music was phenomenal. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who of course loves steak, but is also looking for an upscale meal.
2019-06-19,1,Not kid friendly...even on a Tuesday night 9pm.  This is the third and last attempt I will try to go there with kids.  The place had music and there were some people but there were a lot of empty tables and not full.  My kids wanted to sit near the band.  There were 2 big empty tables right near the band but they said it "was busy" and we could not sit there.   Instead they rudely asked us to sit in the back.  We left.
2019-03-23,2,Solid C+ steak. Price point is the same as the real steakhouses, but the meat quality and preparation is just not there.  Cappuccino had unexplainable chunks in it.
2019-01-22,2,I came here recently with my husband and a few friends for dinner.  My husband has been many times back in the day when I guess things were a little different.  After our meal recently my group collectively agrees Dino & Harrys is a rip off.  The one positive is this restaurant has nice ambiance and is on a nice block in Hoboken.  In terms of the negatives, this restaurant charges you NYC prices,  but the food really does not match up.  Their petit filet is about $45 and I believe is a 6 oz - its very small.  I dont know what the 'regular' filet was, but that is what the petit filet should have been, and that was $55.  All of their appetizers are about $20, and can feed maybe 2 people, and similarly their sides are probably made for 1 person and they are $10 each.  All of this definitely adds up in a per person price. The final negative point which many other reviewers have stated is their staff is definitely a bit rude.  I had called their restaurant months ago to inquire about renting a large space for a party.  After many calls I finally got in touch with a woman who could only tell me that I need to call back when an owner was there.  She was not even willing to take my name and number so HE could call ME.  Overall I would suggest taking a peak at their menu before deciding to dine here.  If you want a higher quality steakhouse that is worth the price I would suggest Ruth Chris or Fire & Oak in Jersey City.
2019-01-07,5,Got the ribeye. Absolutely delicious. Nice crust. Great sear. Girlfriend had the sirloin. Highly recommend
2019-01-07,5,Porterhouse steak was amazing. Best steak I've had in years! Lamb-chops were a very good dish as well. Very juicy and tasteful. Loved the ambiance and the waiter was very personable and welcoming. 10/10 would eat again!
2018-12-25,4,Bar is great. Hard to hear convos if you sit in the back due to the ceiling design. Wish they offered more salad options and fish. This place rivals river palm in edgewater.
2018-12-22,1,UPDATE...unfortunately Wow. WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!! I wish I could give them negative 5 stars! Service was poor, to say kindly. For drinks, I had a mule. Said I couldn't have Tito's vodka; makes me sick. Bartender says that's odd it's pure. Do not insult me. It's rude. Got grey goose. Charged me $13! Insane. Food was terrible! And cost is outrageous! For starters we ordered the blue point oysters. Not fresh. Tutta Pesca is way better for oysters and less expensive. We ordered lobster. Lobster was severely over-cooked! Rubber would have tasted better. The butter was cheap and didn't have flavor. Definitely didn't save the horrid lobster. NOT WORTH $32!!!! We ordered the filet mignon. Filet was so dry. For $54, we sent it back. No thank you. Bartender says it looks like it's cooked perfectly. Really?! We ate it and it was DRY. Filet should be juicy! Especially medium rare cook. Bartender told us it will take a while. Really? So because our steak was cooked incorrectly and had poor quality, we now have to wait? Okay. Brought the same steak out and tried to cook it more. That would dry it out MORE! Bartender seen it and corrected them. But I noticed this scene. He gave us free $2 asparagus that was wrinkled. Either over-cooked or not fresh. Gee thanks! Second steak came out and was much smaller. We were never asked how any of the food was. Horrible horrible horrible service!! So disappointed!! DO NOT COME HERE. Waste of money!!! Over-priced, poor quality food, and less than mediocre service!! I do not recommend it. Shame.
2018-12-22,4,We were seated on time, party of six in the bar area. The bar was very busy, appeared to be lots of locals just in for drinks. Too loud for dinner! We were told a table in the back was not available appetizers were mediocre, bacon did not compare to NYC steak house. Side dishes small yet steak and service were excellent
2018-12-12,5,Came here as a total surprise (boyfriend wanted to celebrate six months together, and he planned a late Sunday reservation that I was blissfully unaware of)! When I realized where we were going, I was excited! I heard positive things from a coworker who also had a date night here, so I was optimistic we were in for a treat.Our waitress was very helpful, especially when it came to drinks. She handed us an ipad that had the entire drink menu, wine and cocktails. My boyfriend got a Tito's cider mule, while I got a strong glass of Italian red wine per recommendation of our waitress. Beyond this, service a little slow comparative to the busyness of the restaruant (i.e. for a Sunday night, not very busy). The wine itself was delicious, and the cider mule, while also well-made, was definitely a little dangerous, so my boyfriend switched to craft beer. As for food, we ordered the Hearts of Lettuce (i.e. their wedge salad) to share, along with two steaks-- one "black and blue" 11 oz filet with sauteed mushrooms for me, and a medium rare 16 oz sirloin with blue cheese butter and fries for bae; potatoes Lyonnaise, and creamed spinach.The food is solid steakhouse fare, with options for pescetarians. I'm normally a pretty staunch purist when it comes to steak (no adornment, just meat), but I was willing to expand my horizons with the mushrooms. The meat iself is was cooked like a true "Pittsburgh blue" steak, charred heavily on the outside, with a cool, blood-red center. It was flavorful, but the mushrooms were well-cooked and provided a solid enhancement to the filet. The potatoes Lyonnaise were not traditional potatoes Lyonnaise (they did have bacon), but were nonetheless hearty and delicious, if a little on the oily side. The creamed spinach was divine; well-executed and creamy. I could eat it in vats! My boyfriend loved the spinach as well, and he adored his steak; cooked to order with creamy blue cheese butter and the crispy fries. For dessert, we decided on the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. The crisp was heavenly, probably my favorite part of the meal. It was warm, sugary, and golden brown with sweet apples. It tasted homemade, and the vanilla ice cream was a perfect pairing.Overall, my boyfriend did well with this perfect date night setting with great food and great cocktails. A must-try in Hoboken!
2018-12-09,5,One of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Can always get a great meal and an excellent cocktail.
2018-12-02,3,I wanted to try this place since it's one of the only steakhouses in Hoboken. Had a reservation at 6PM on a Friday and was promptly seated in a section of the restaurant that was secluded and a little cold. Wine list was unique and a little hard to navigate but our server was able to help us pick a nice Syrah. Ordered the fried calamari and the oysters Maxwell, which were both great. Had the filet with mushrooms on top and sautéed spinach both of which were soaked in oil. That was a huge turn off to the meal as I had enjoyed everything up until that point.
2018-11-17,5,One of the best steakhouses in the tri state, a little pricey but well worth the money! Amazing cuts of steak,sides, rockin moscow mule and a burrata platter sent from the gods
2018-10-07,3,The food is meh and its expensive.  For that cost you'd think they'd stop by to see if you need a drink.  Keep in mind that the Dino and Harrys steak sauce is just repackaged ketchup.
2018-09-19,5,Wonderful steak and nice environment.I had the sirloin steak with sweet potato French fries. The steak was the best I had and the potato was ok. I highly recommend. High quality and great service.
2018-08-29,5,*** review update! We dined on Monday and everything was perfect! The service was great and my steak was cooked perfectly! I had a spinach salad which was large and can easily be shared! Overall great dining experiences and I can't wait to come back!!
2018-08-14,1,I have gone to other high end steak places before and in comparison, this was horrible. I was expecting this place to be outstanding for the price.  Thank god I went during restaurant week. If I would have paid regular price I would have been pissed off. First the service was HORRIBLE.  I had to get up to find out server. Then the food was under cooked & under flavored. It tasted frozen.  And the desserts were sub par. For the prices listed on the menu, I expect phenomenal food and service.  You can get a better meal else where.  Don't waste your money here.
2018-08-04,5,Had a magical time here. Every component of our meal was suburb - make sure to get the truffle oil gnocchi it's absolutely to die for. We will 100% be back
2018-07-24,2,Had dinner here last night.  My husband and I both ordered the Sirloin Steak. I asked for mine rare and he wanted his medium. They both came medium rare. Mine was overcooked and my husband's was undercooked. The name of the restaurant includes the name Steakhouse.  You would think they would know how to cook them.
2018-06-09,5,Went here with a party of four, and I couldn't be any happier. The atmosphere, piano player, tin ceilings make for a relaxing night just to begin with. Then to the most important,,,, the food!! We started with a crab cake, this was delicious large Lump crab meat, tasty and fresh. Comes with some avocado on the side, outstanding, next was the Tuna Tartare soooo good fresh and tasty, we also had the oysters which were also,, delicious!!!  The steak we had was the porterhouse for three, this was a excellent steak cooked the way we ordered it medium. The char was perfect very very well prepared piece of meat! My wife got the filet and hers was also equally delicious. For sides we had Sautéed spinach, and Baked potato's all three thumbs up. I will most definitely be adding this place to my list of must go to restaurants. And the owner, Dino a complete gentleman which makes it even nicer!
2018-05-23,1,Over-priced, over-rated, just go into ManhattanI have tried Dino's a couple of times, and every time something has been just off. The servers feel like they have been there forever yet don't know the basics (i.e. able to give any wine recommendation from their list, I know wines but like to trust a server, and it is always a good steer for how well they know their job, if they recommend the most expensive then they are just looking to boost their tip, if they recommend something mid range and unusual, they can be trusted, if they can't point to anything then they shouldn't be working in a restaurant). The appetizers were forgettable, the steak mediocre at best and then after dinner, we wanted to look at the drinks list and, it is terrible. For a steakhouse, I would expect a decent drinks list and a good Scotch selection, they did not have that. I asked for a brand that I had checked was on the bar and was told twice that they did not have it. I asked for it with rocks on the side (a very basic request) and received a shot glass of single malt, and a pint glass of ice.Overall there is nothing more premium in the experience than eating at Arthur's, and the prices are like Luger's. seriously if you want a good steak, and experience go to Del Frisco's, and get a water view, friendly, knowledgeable service and better value.Lastly, living close by to here, walk by on any Saturday or Sunday morning and you'll see un-bussed tables in the front window. If the staff and owners cannot be bothered with these real basics of keeping a clean restaurant, they cannot be expected to get the high end right. Should've known better, will not go back.
2018-05-13,4,Good food, good service but totally overpriced. 3 people, one of them.a little kid, no alcohol, came to almost $250, as good as the food was, won't be going back.
2018-05-02,4,Nice spot. Definitely has an old world rat pack type of feel. The bartender was great and the apps (shrimp and oysters)were great too. The server was there when we had an empty drink and/or needed him. He took great care of us but didn't hover. The t-bone was great as were the mushroom and onion mix. I would definitely return the next time I'm in Hoboken.
2018-04-30,5,Bacon appetizer - amazing. Seafood tower of bluepoint oysters, crab, clams, and monster shrimp - ample and refreshing.Porterhouse - perfection.Service - Louis and crew were great for our large table.D&H could do no wrong for our meal. Will definitely return...
2018-04-28,5,Dino and Harry's has always been a steakhouse on my list, and I finally got to visit this past week. We had reservations Saturday night, and had a great table. What made this table so great, was sitting next to Cal Ripken himself. He even came over to your table and introduced himself. Quite the experience if you know who he is (you should know who he is). As for the restaurant, I started out with my classic martini win blue cheese olives. They make a great martini. I ordered the T Bone steak because it's something I normally don't make myself. It was cooked perfectly to my medium rare request and was delicious. I added a blue cheese butter spread for my steak. If you can't tell yet, I'm obsessed with blue cheese. For sides, I ordered buttered asparagus and creamed spinach. My meal was fantastic. D&H blew my expectations away and can't wait for my next visit.
2018-04-28,2,Food was average for the price point but the real problem with this place is the live entertainment. I understand, live dinner music vs speakers I get it but the but a piano in the middle of the place and hired a guy to not hold back and play it all out plus he has a microphone and sings very loudly. It's all great if your going to a concert or maybe if it was a larger place but tables are a few feet from this in my section. This made dinner conversation impossible. You had to lean in to the person right next to you to say anything and forget the person at the other side of the table. You might say the person writing is old, as I do sound like an old man but the avg age at the table was about 31 so it was just to loud at any age. What you didn't hear me I said it was to LOUD, I said to LOUD, L O U D. Never mind I'll tell you after dinner.
2018-04-05,3,Came to Dino and Harrys on a Wednesday evening. Reservations for 630. The place is charming and old but classy.  A grand piano in the front. Our seats were great - off to the side by the window so as not to be in the noisy main area - was feeling the more serene scene. The service was uninspired but adequate. There is a large wine list but no sommelier...the wait staff "know the wine". Not sure that they really know the wine but they knew enough I guess. Here's what we had:- Bread to start (warm and crusty)- Bacon (very good)- Penne cacio e Pepe (excellent - crisp peas and asparagus and al dente pasta. They split with no issue for an appetizer)- Porterhouse for 2 (it was ok. Something was off though. A little too chewy although it looked ok)- Creme Brûlée and Oreo desert (both good)- Bottle of St. Emillion (very good and reasonable)The reason for the moderate rating comes down to the sleepy service (it took a long time to get food), the "ok" porterhouse and what I'm currently feeling which is stomach pains. My friend also is feeling the same. In any case - I've heard the ribeye is better so I will be back at some point and hopefully have a better experience at which point I'll definitely increase my rating.
2018-04-04,5,Awesome experience, me and boyfriend came for our anniversary and it was so good !! We started off with the grilled octopus and oysters which were amazing especially the octopus !! Then. I had the 16 oz ribeye myBoyfriend had the porterhouse both perfectly cooked, we enjoyed it with string beans and augratain potatoes both cooked perfect aswell ! Ended the night with a espresso martini and creme brûlée my boyfriend had the Nutella sundae so good !
2018-03-15,4,Conssumtate NJ steakhouse experience. I have been coming here for over twenty years, when it was Frankie and Johnny's. Every time I visit the NY City area, I come for dinner at this feel-good spot in Hoboken. Tasty steaks, cooked to order, same wonderful staff I have seen for many, many years (always a good sign) and still my favorite house steak sauce. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
2018-03-11,5,This place over-exceeded expectations. The atmosphere was lively.  The food was delicious.  The service was impeccable.  THE Cal Ripken Jr. (who we're told frequents this restaurant often) was sitting right near us!  How can this place be bad??
2018-02-16,1,I had a bad feeling about this place from the moment we stepped inside. The areas around the maitre d's desk and the bar were packed with people still waiting to be seated for their 8pm reservations after 9pm (kind of defeating the purpose of a reservation at all, especially since they require a credit card to make one). No one seemed happy, ranging from mildly agitated to infuriated. It took a while for anyone to speak with us. The maitre d eventually reported it would be around 15-20 minutes, to which another guest responded "it'll be an hour" (another guest waiting for their 8pm reservation). Needless to say they had a few thoughts to share with management.Another guest with an 8:30 reservation started to complain again. He was curtly told there were still people waiting from 8pm. At this point I lost interest in dining here, as they clearly lacked basic customer service skills and were blatantly lying to their guests in order to keep them angrily waiting. Definitely a shame, because I've heard the food is quite good. When we tried to cancel our reservation, the maitre d attempted to keep us waiting, pointing out it had only been 10 minutes after our reservation. Once I told her I just heard her say they were backed up by over an hour, she finally relented and let us cancel the reservation.Apparently the people who stayed regretted their decision, due to the long wait and poor service during the meal, so I'm glad we left. We ended up having an amazing dinner at Lola's down the street.
2018-02-15,3,Food was above average.  Steak a little dry for the prices.  Had a terrible experience the first time as the service was the worst ive experienced.  However, I gave it another shot, and was very pleased with the service.  The lack of consistency in service is why its 3 stars, along with the quality of the food not matching the pricing.
2018-02-14,1,You're better off eating at Red Lobster. Food was way overpriced and completely underwhelming. Service was atrocious from the Maitre d to the wait staff.  Either scale back to an Olive Garden or take yourself into the city for a proper steakhouse with edible surf n turf. Not worth wasting your money, your patience, or palate on this place.
2018-02-14,2,I actually loved the food but the service here was terrible. I went here for my birthday dinner on February 7, 2018 and the hostess was absolutely nasty. When we went to the bar to order a drink it took 10 minutes and the bartender was just standing there.
2018-02-13,5,This is one of the best places in the tri-state. I remember this place as Frankie and Johnnies when I started to attend special events like political functions to birthday celebrations or taking my family for an amazing meal. The service, decor and food are 5 stars.I never had issues here just amazing memories. I highly recommend to start out with the Applewood Smoked Bacon ($16) and the Fried Calamari ($17).  For entrees I would recommend the aged steaks whether it's the T-bone or Sirloin steak (16 oz - $41.00 or 22 oz. - $52).  (They have their own house steak sauce). If you're not into meat I recommend the Chilean Sea Bass Atlantic Salmon ($33) or the Alaskan Halibut ($33).I think the T-bone is a bit farrier which gives a little bit more flavor than the sirloin but for a nice 16 oz. You're going to be just fine if you enjoy a nice steak! You have to try to make room for dessert which are amazing as well, I recommend trying the Snowbroken (an oreo dessert) or the strawberry rhubarb which is sweet and tarty.The owner Dino is mostly there and very friendly to approach and if you're lucky they have a pianoist or a band performing on certain evenings which is delightful and let's you make some requests.They accept cash or credit just make sure you area able to find parking prior, there are lots available which you can find.  I believe for 3 hours and it costs around $8.00.
2018-01-27,3,Food was nothing special. Went for restaurant week but there are better steak places around
2018-01-14,4,I would give 4.5 stars if that were an option... We had dinner here last night for the first time. We started out with a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. For an appetizer we had the grilled octopus which was good, but not great. For dinner I had the petite filet and my husband had the 22 oz. sirloin and for sides we had the gnocchi and brussel sprouts. Everything was very good! The ambiance was great and our waitress Leslie was amazing! We will definitely be back!
2017-12-01,1,The worst hostess you will find.  We had a reservation and were told that they were running 30 minutes behind.  30 turned to 40 then an hour.  The hostess was dumb as rocks and asked us why we kept asking for our table! By the time we got our table the kitchen was about to close and no apologies given.
2017-11-09,5,So I'm 8 months pregnant and my husband wanted to take me out for one last romantic dinner before we become a family of 3.  We came in on Saturday night and the wait was going to be about 45 minutes.  There was a sweet young hostess named Genesis who took one look at my swollen ankles and found us a table right away.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere was pleasant.  I don't think I could have stood for very long and I won't forget her kindness or the great food.  Looking forward to coming back as a family of 3!
2017-10-11,4,I have been here a few times and overall great place. The food is excellent, They have someone playing the piano for some peaceful entertainment.  Probably would give 5 stars but I feel they are a bit over priced. I would definitely return but probably only for a special occasion.
2017-09-19,5,My favorite steakhouse in the world. Nothing compares to the quality of food at Dino's, HANDS DOWN. Honestly don't think you'll find a better steak anywhere else. Service is unbeatable. Worth every cent!
2017-09-01,5,Only order the Filet sandwich and peach cobbler dessert and both were fantastic. I rarely order a steak sandwich but the filet was tender, the provolone cheese and mushrooms were perfect. Fried onions on the side were the perfect compliment. The peach cobbler dessert was a fine finish. I recommend both highly.
2017-08-05,5,Every bite was perfect.  I had a mixed greens salad with pears and almonds.  Followed by mignon medallions on a bed of green beans and truffle mashed potatoes.  The steak was med well and so very tender and juicy.  It was the right amount of food.  This was Restaurant's week $40 menu.  Usually all sides are a la carte and the steaks are a huge portion.  For dessert I had the peach cobbler with passion fruit sorbet.  Margarita on the rocks was perfect.  7 out of 10 cocktails I don't like but I was pleased with this one.  All around it was a great meal.
2017-07-28,3,Good spot.  Decent restaurant week specials.  Got the filet medallions.  I'd def check it out again.
2017-07-28,4,The food is pricey but delicious!! Service was great and the drinks were strong. The atmosphere is a classic steakhouse vibe and decor. A great place for date night or a special occasion. Get the ribeye! You won't be disappointed!
2017-07-26,5,Yay! For restaurant week. Parking sucks, however, there is a garage just one block away. 3 hours = $8.00. The decor and live music (pianist) made for a romantic date night. To drink: I decided on the Pinot Nior, my usual go to red and my date opted for a Moscow mule. To start: (restaurant week menu) we ordered an arugula, almond, blue cheese, fennel and apple salad and the chick cut bacon. Both were well balanced in flavor and very tasty. For entrees: we ordered the filet mignon medallions which were accompanied by mash potatoes and string beans, and the branzino, which was a beautifully pan seared filet over cauliflower rice. Both were very good. The filets were seasoned and cooked perfectly and the branzino was prepared very well. I would say top three branzino filets I've had thus far. Desert: we had the trio sorbet which consisted of tamarind, coconut, and mango over a watermelon sauce and a fudge, Oreo ice cream sundae with coconut chards. I will be back soon for a special occasion to try their regular dinner menu.
2017-07-26,4,Very hard to find parking utilize a parking lot if you can't find anything. I went for restaurant week, so the food may have been altered for the restaurant week menu. A pianists on the piano, makes for a great date night and a different venue style in the area. I had a salad (nuts, blue cheese, apple cuts), very good. I had the filet mignon and it was great and tender not much more to say about it. Ordered the orchard mule (apple/pear mule) $15 but great size and tasted great. Also, I had a desert, I can't remember the name of it but it's vanilla ice cream with fudge and coconut shavings (great for chocolate lover).
2017-07-11,5,Dino & Harry's has been my favorite restaurant for about 20 years.  I have never had a bad (or even mediocre) experience there.  The the service is excellent and the food is fantastic.  The pricing is also reasonable for a quality steakhouse.  I highly recommend Dino & Harry's.
2017-06-28,3,Porterhouse for two is excellent and a huge portion - I will give them that.  Wine selections by the glass are subpar.  Service also very slow and unattentive.  Be sure they don't seat you by the bar or else you will be glaring at the noisy drunken regulars all night while trying to eat.
2017-06-19,5,We had a great Father's day dinner. The sat us at a nice table right on time for our reservation. The waitress and bus staff were prompt and helpful. Attentive but not over bearing.The bread and breadsticks were fresh and tasty. The butter was at the proper temp, firm but not hard or melting.We ordered cocktails. They came quickly and were a nice size pour, especially for the expensive scotch I had ordered.We had oysters as an appetizer.  They were fresh and very good.The steaks came next. I had the 16 oz sirloin and my wife the 16 oz. prime rib. Both came prepared properly to our requests.Over all an excellent meal.We skipped desert. We walked to the river and got ice cream at 16 handles. Sat by the water to eat it. A nice end to a great evening.
2017-06-15,2,I don't know the history, heritage, legacy or legend of this place, but to put it mildly, was extremely disappointed. Do not make the mistake of assuming you are going to a first (or even 2nd) rate steakhouse.The positives: Started with the "Beef salad" and was pleasantly surprised with the well aged, and perfectly prepared thin strips of beef layered on top. $16 The negatives: ambiance, price, and taste of the lamb chops and fillet mignon sandwhich, $26 and $30 respectively.They simply don't know how to prepare medium well lamb (or beef). The chops came out way too charred and my wife couldn't eat them. I joked that I wouldn't even feed it to our dog. The fillet mignon sandwhich was also prepared medium well as requested but was just strips of not very tender beef with unimpressive flavor. I neglected to mention that I don't like cheese on mine, so when it was brought over I was hoping they would make another one for me, but no luck....I guess understandably so at $30 ($8 at any other diner - same flavor).Anyway, long story short...would I ever go again? HELL NO! Kinda surprised how they stay in business at those exorbitant prices, unimpressive flavor, and inability to properly cook meat to 'medium well'. They wouldn't survive in NYC and I am baffled as to how they stay open in Hoboken.
2017-06-07,4,To begin, the service is amazing. A seasoned crew makes all the difference in my opinion, our waitress was knowledgeable and attentive. The jump shrimp cocktail was the highlight of the meal, great quality and flavor. The thick cut bacon was a bit overdone by the flavors were great. The scallops were perfectly cooked with a. Nice char and properly seasoned. Not my first visit by far, but certainly a Memorable one.
2017-05-15,5,Great food the atmosphere is excellent I enjoyed the piano player.  I haven't been in the tri-state area in 15yrs I felt as if I had never left.  I will return regardless of business or pleasure.
2017-05-08,5,This was our first trip to New Jersey and decided to try an independent restaurant instead of a chain and it truly paid off. The place in itself is spectacular due to the history and the staff showed us marvelous service. We ordered the rib eye steak which was cooked to our perfection as well as our side dishes. Very fkavorful. The biggest disappointment is to think we'll  have to travel 1800 + miles to enjoy  the food and hospitality again. Linda
2017-04-29,3,Tl;dr- The only thing holding this restaurant back is the extremely high prices of their food. If this place wasn't so expensive I would visit again in the future, but I will not because I am not upper-class.  This place is just too expensive. We had an 8 o'clock reservation and were seated immediately. The waitress was good. our waiter was not invasive and waited on our cues for when we were ready to order. Our waitress was actually really goodThe interior was lit well enough to be able to read the menus and it was dark enough to provide that warm setting it is going for. It's actually really nice and decorated well. The tables are spaced well enough apart so it does not feel cramped. The restaurant is not that big. Because it is not that big it can get pretty loud sense the bar area is front and center.I had the fillet mignon medium rare. It came out to order which is good. Your meal will not come with any sides as you must order them as extra. Meal was good.  it came served with dice the mushrooms on top. The exercise I ordered I got brussels sprouts. Theu were good too.Before I begin to discuss the matter of the pricing, you will notice I've given this review three stars. If the prices were better this would be a four star review. The restaurant is priced as an upscale restaurant and as a matter fact is more expensive then many restaurants in New York City that I have been too. My filet mignon was $51 and the Side ofbrussels sprouts was $10 which means that my dish was $61. My girlfriend got the petite fillet mignon which is 6 ounces and it was $41. We split the brussels sprouts and probably should have got one more side because there wasn't enough food. This is mainly sense the filet mignon is a smaller steak which I fully understand though the sides should come with the meal. Wine by the glass was a bit pricey at $11 glass cheapest.Our bill including tip was 158.
2017-04-26,2,Mediocre food, exorbitant prices.  Clearly here to take advantage of those that don't care about either food quality or price.Most redeeming qualities are the antique bar and the piano player.
2017-04-21,4,This is one of the better steaks you'll find in Hoboken. It doesn't stack up to the upper echelon of NYC steakhouses (Peter Luger's, Gallagher's, Del Frisco's), but it gets the job done.It was a group of 6 and we were hunnnnn-gry. To start off we went with Grilled Octopus ($21), Tuna Tartare ($20), Burrata ($18), and Sliced Tomato and Onion ($13). That last one was something my boyfriend's dad ordered that I would never normally opt for. But he's an extremely picky eater and doesn't like basically anything, so he went for us. The octopus was cooked perfectly and wasn't chewy or rubbery at all like you find at even some nicer places. The tartare (or is it "tartar"?) was held together by a great mayo/sauce that really made the dish. The burrata was rich and creamy, just like you'd want.For my entree I got the Atlantic Salmon with roasted potatoes, Brussels sprouts, and a "grain mustard emulsion" ($33). I'm not exactly an emulsion expert, but I might become one. My boyfriend's mom got the Sea Scallops with sweet potato puree, lobster beurre blanc, and sauteed green beans ($34). I had a little bite and they were as good as any scallops I've had at non-seafood restaurants. My boyfriend and his dad split the 32 oz porterhouse for 2 ($80) and then we got a bunch of sides for the table - mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, Brussles sprouts, and steamed asparagus (all $10).Our waiter was really nice, I'd rate the service 5 stars. The ambiance is classic steakhouse - lots of wood white tablecloths. The wine list was pretty extensive. There was nothing that I'd say was "cheap", but there were bottles across a number of price ranges. Apparently, there's sometimes live music and there's also a TV if you care about a big game or something.I don't think I'd make a trip across the river just to come here, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good steakhouse in Hoboken or that general part of NJ
2017-04-06,5,We had dinner here last night for my husbands birthday and brought our two year old with us as we couldn't get a babysitter. The food and service was excellent and we will definitely be back. The staff was great with our son, especially our server (female but I can't remember her name) in making sure that he had everything he needed.
2017-04-05,5,Cozy atmosphere, perfect service and delicious food; what else can be said? Thanks...
2017-03-30,4,Great meal! Besides the steak, get the TRUFFLE GNOCCHI. You won't be the same afterwards.Amazing bar tender//great vibes overall.Below average service/server other than that.
2017-02-15,5,Came here for Valentine's Day. Unbelievable food, steak cooked to perfection, great service. No complaints. Wish I could afford to eat here everyday.
2017-02-15,2,Came here on Valentines Day. Food was really great. We started with a special appetizer which were seafood crepes. Small crepes but really tasty, basically like a bisque sauce on top. We had filet mignon, portions were of a good size and the steak tasted incredible. We also order bacon brussel sprouts and 3 cheese gnocchi which were both delicious. The food was not at all an issue. Problem was the service. It took me a little to realize why I felt the initial conversation felt awkward and it was because the waitress came over and said "Anything to drink?" Didn't introduce herself, didn't say we have some specials, happy Valentine's Day, didn't even say HELLO. Just, "Anything to drink?" I normally do not care about service too much but if I'm dropping $250 on a meal, you better dance, curtsey, and treat your patrons with respect. I wish I could address which waitress it was but because she never told us her name I can't. You shouldn't address your patrons like you're at the damn Malibu diner at 3am. On top of that, after our appetizer came we had to literally hunt down this waitress to get a second round of drinks. You think if we're dropping $30 for a round of drinks the waitress would be constantly asking if we wanted more drinks. Nope. Just the initial incredibly rude asking of if we wanted drinks, and then never again until we hunted her down to get more drinks. If the food wasn't over the top this rating would be a 1. But on Valentines Day you think you'd have your best foot forward at your restaurant but they didn't. Really unpleasant experience with the service. I won't be coming back because of it. There are plenty of places I can visit in the city and drop a hefty amount of money and feel treated with respect.
2017-02-15,2,Restaurant did not seem to be ready for the holiday rush of Valentine's Day. People around us were complaining where their meal was. It did take a while for us to get our food and when we did receive we were never asked how things were or anything until we were done and ready for the check. The meal that was ordered had tree nuts on it despite not having said it on the menu, which I was allergic to but couldn't tell the waiter since he was MIA. Food was pretty good but for the price I would not go back.
2017-01-31,4,Had a great meal on a Sunday night- we stopped in for the Hudson Restaurant week! What an awesome deal 40$ for an app, 14oz sirloin and dessert- the gentleman that took out order was very attentive and always filled our glasses with water. The bread basket to start was great as well- the menu is normally very expensive and I would recommend you go for a special occasion or celebration. The toffee bread pudding was awesome!
2017-01-28,2,Even though we had a reservation, we waited about 25 minutes.  Took some time to be greeted.  Bread arrived after our appetizers.  Second drink never came.  Food was not not great.  For the price, I'd expect more.  Our server was completely inattentive and barely came by.
2017-01-23,2,I came here once and it wasn't that awesome but we decided to give it another try. It was actually worst than the first time. For starters, let me just say that as a steak connoisseur, this place's steak is nothing to write home about. Good but nothing amazing. In addition, the service sucked, the bus boy might as well have been our waiter, as he serviced us more than the god forsaken waitress. My friends steak was too well done, and the waitress didn't even bother to check on us. She was all over the table near us though. The bus boy ended up getting my friend a new steak, but they took his fork so he had to wait another five minutes to eat the steak. And where was our waitress? Hawking some table nearby, didn't bother coming back, didn't apologize, I don't even think she's the one that took our check. If you didn't wanna serve us you could've assigned another waitress to us.  Again, the steaks weren't all that, but I would have given it a 3 maybe even 4, but the goddamn waitress really pissed me off. Nice looking place too. Waste.
2017-01-08,2,Where oh where do I begin? Lets start with the good.We came here to celebrate New Years Eve, with no reservation, so that was cool. The ambiance was REALLY nice!  I instantly felt good being there. Our server was an older woman who seemed like she would rather be anyplace but there...and it showed. After we ordered wine, she left so fast we didn't get a chance to tell her that we already knew what we wanted to order. Some time after we place our order, I asked for a side of cilantro. The server looked at me as if id asked for it in German.Once our food arrived, it took me QUITE a while to cut pieces of that steak....it was sooo tough. Wasn't any easier trying to chew it. I was only able to eat about 1/4 of it. Speaking of the size, it was the SMALLEST porterhouse I'd ever had. Suffice it to say, that was the FIRST and LAST time I try to have a steak in New Jersey. Next time, we will go back to the capital grille (in Manhattan) because they are always amazing.
2017-01-01,1,This was our third visit last night. We dined early. Each time I say for the price the food is not very good. Our first visit the server was rude.  The second time my Salmon was cooked to complete dryness and this time the Halibut had no taste, no seasoning on it.  We also shared the Buratta appetizer . It  had  no taste, the little tomato sauce which they called something else which I cannot remember on the side tasted like ketchup. It's as if they ran out of salt.  Dinner for four with tip was around $270 with one bottle of average red wine. I never complain about restaurants but I don't like to be ripped off and that's how we felt.
2016-12-27,2,My husband & I have been to Dino & Harry's probably five or so times over the course of the last few years. Up until the most recent visit, it has always been very pleasant. It became our "special occasion" restaurant where we'd go to celebrate and treat ourselves. That's why it was the logical choice for my husband's 30th this past month. I included the fact that it was his birthday in the comments of the online reservation.When we arrived (early for our res, actually) we were brought to the very back room of the restaurant where our tables were literally on top of the other tables. No exaggeration, there was MAYBE two inches of space between our table and the ones on either side of us. It was basically a communal table - the opposite of what our romantic/celebratory date night was supposed to be.Our waiter could not have been less friendly; aside from taking our order he didn't say a word or interact with us at all the entire time we were there. My husband & I had originally planned to have dessert there since we weren't having his birthday cake until the following day with friends, but agreed to get the heck out of there the second we finished dinner.All in all it was a super disappointing & frustrating experience. We won't be back.
2016-12-19,5,Best steakhouse in Hoboken, far and away. Dino's can also go toe-to-toe with some of the best NYC steakhouses. Classic selections done extraordinarily well. Highly recommend the bacon appetizer and porterhouse for two.
2016-12-12,3,Unfortunately since my last review I've had a bunch of really mixed experiences here that force me to rethink that stellar 5 star review.The last time there, they screwed up the temperature on my steak TWICE.  I ordered rare and the first one came out medium well to well... I hate to send items back, I might send one item back a year if that.  But the steak wasn't even the slightest bit pink.  Now I knew what was going to happen but there was nothing I could do it about it.  The next one came out purple.... basically meat sushi!  I wasn't about to send it back again but I didn't order black and blue, so they screwed up the order twice.  They did the same exact thing to my buddy as well.  Out of the 10 steaks ordered, 5 were cooked correctly.  50% is not ok.  Also, they missed one of the sides when everything came out.  So it was all just a bit of a mess.They of course did nothing to apologize, no here's a slice of cake for us messing up over and over.  Yeah, it's going to be a while until I go back.
2016-12-09,3,As a steakhouse, you need two things: thick steaks and good service. Unfortunately they have neither. I ordered the ribeye, and got a steak you'd find in the supermarket. It was ok but just not at all what you expect from a restaurant that calls itself a steakhouse. It wasn't very tender.. a great steak doesn't need sauce, and theirs definitely did.My wife's filet mignon  was undercooked, and just not great. That wasn't the deal breaker but it didn't help, either.The service was poor, attentive, but not knowledgeable servers. Went on a Saturday night, too. Had a good wine, and creamed spinach was ok, good ambiance, but I won't be returning.
2016-12-05,5,This place can give any NYC steakhouse a run for their money. Delicious bacon, steaks, and sides. Oh, dessert too.
2016-11-05,1,Food was good and pretty quick.Our previous visits have been good but today, other than the food a complete disappointment.  Waitress was friendly enough but after taking orders we never saw here again - not to check after the food arrived, not for a second drink, nothing. Until we were done.  Half way through the meal we asked for a manager and nothing. No one came. After my wife confronted the waitress she comp'ed a bunch of stuff. So OK, fine. On the way out the owner really couldn't seem to care less - a little apology but attitude was really pretty obvious that he didn't particularly care one way or the other - they got busy and we were off to the side apparently...  just excuses...For a place that charges what they do they need to be better ($30+ for 5 Raviolis!) Management/owners clearly don't care and it showsSpend your money elsewhere.
2016-11-02,5,I've swung by once a year for the past few years with a large group of guys...about 15+/- because we're all married with kids, and we don't have an opportunity to get together like we have in the past.  What better place to relive the bachelor party days than to break bread at a fine steakhouse.   Steaks have always been excellent, great ambiance and prompt service.  Always a great place to people watch and soak it all in.  Only negative which is typical of Hoboken is the parking situation.  I've been to almost every steakhouse on both sides of the Hudson, but for my once a year fix, it's always Dino's.
2016-10-24,5,Best steakhouse east of Chicago...old school with a modern flare. They age there on beef and serve great value !
2016-10-09,4,We were there to celebrate a birthday... our reservations were made through Yelp. From the beginning to the end, the experience was great... the food was excellent, the service was excellent, and they even provided a complimentary dessert for the birthday girl. I would absolutely recommend Dino & Harry's... only drawback is trying to park the car - eventually at pricey lot around the corner.
2016-10-08,5,I was so hesitant to come here but I went last night and I had the best time I skipped on dinner because I do not eat red meat and I do not support steakhousesBut we did get some great wines and met some wonderful people to network with and you were able to meet wonderful people became friends with us immediately we all shared a table exchange business cards so it's a great place to network and get some great wine they do have other food options but I haven'tAnd opinion on the food but everyone else at the table enjoyed what I had I did get to meet the owner do you know when he was very niceI thought the location was good and I thought the employees were agree they had a nice karaoke thing going on which made it kind of fun and I'm not even into karaokeMy single guy friends and I got to me for single attorneys and just have a really nice time for the entire evening with good music and a really good vibeI definitely recommend if you want to meet people of a higher class people are friendly there are no dramatic weird fights so it's definitely my level of taste I just don't eat red meat so it feels very awkward for me to sit in a steakhouseI mean it even bothers me watching people Chew on steakBut I will return
2016-09-23,1,Never, ever, order food to be delivered. Great food if done correctly. It rarely is. I was enough of a sucker to keep trying. No more. Steaks are seriously undercooked, forcing me to grill them after delivery. Sides are missing or the ingredients are changed without notice. If you can go in person and correct their mistakes, great - the steaks are delicious. But never, ever, ever order from them. Worst attention to detail I have ever seen in a restaurant that delivers. Maybe they should stop.
2016-09-10,1,Worst service, Unaccommodating, not helpful and rude. Suddenly when we had a problem there was no manager or owner on a Saturday evening???We just live down the street and it has been a few years since we have been there but we will definitely not go again. I will not recommend go there, a lot better choices around.
2016-08-12,5,One of the best steakhouses you will find.  Great service at the bar and table.  Nice piano entertainment.  Filet and Ribeeye as good as you've ever had.  Never miss an opportunity while I'm in Hoboken.
2016-08-06,2,I've been here once before and absolutely loved it, but my experience this time was terrible. I went for restaurant week and ordered the arugula salad, filet medallions and lobster scampi, and lava cake - all recommended by the awful waitress we had. I think we had the same waitress as another reviewer that said her waitress was cold and forgot their wine, as this was my exact same experience. The arugula salad was very bland. Nothing to it whatsoever. The filet and lobster was awful. I couldn't cut (or chew) through pieces of the filet and the lobster was definitely too small to actually be a lobster, so I'm not sure what crustacean it really was. Mashed potatoes tasted like prepackaged garbage. Lava cake had no "lava" in it and tasted terrible.Not sure if they skimped out on us because we ordered from the fixed menu, but that's a sure way to lose business. Really disappointed.
2016-07-28,1,My husband and I have been here several times before and have enjoyed it.  Last night, however, was simply awful.  Service - what can I say...I felt like I was at a diner.  The waitress was cold, robotic and not very good.  It's like she wanted to be anywhere else but there.  We were halfway through our appetizers and we still hadn't received the bottle of wine we ordered.  We had to flag her down and ask about it.  No apologies, just "oh what number did you order?"  Food - shrimp bisque was, well, not really shrimp bisque.  It was a watery fishy broth.  Flavor was ok, but couldn't enjoy it since it was so not what I expected.  Filet and lobster tail was ok, nothing special.  On par with mediocre wedding/banquet style food.  Dessert was bad.  Peach crisp had thick pieces of uncooked peaches, raw oatmeal/flour taste and way too much sugar.  Needless to say I left most of it.It was $200 not well spent.  Sorry to say I probably won't be back.
2016-07-27,5,This my and my husband's "celebration" spot! If you're going to splurge on a night out, Dino and Harry's is hands-down the place in Hoboken to do it. The service is so attentive at all levels, and our waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and was able to guide our selection. We had the tuna tartare and Ceasar salad to start. Both were delicious and the perfect amount of food to start. I had the petite filet and my husband had the sirloin--both steaks were cooked exactly as we ordered and were out of this world! I couldn't recommend a better place for a celebration or a reason to get dressed up. We love Dino and Harry's, it's a Hoboken gem, and we will be coming back time and again!
2016-06-29,1,Let me start by saying - minus the food poisoning, the experience at Dino and Harry's was amazing. The service, the food, the piano player, the bartenders were all wonderful. However, I was violently ill after my meal and almost went to the hospital. When I called the restaurant 4 days in a row since then to notify them to check their seafood, they did not pick up. When I emailed them TWICE, they did not respond. What I should be doing is reporting them to the department of health - but I wont. After a $300 meal and no response from their management, I will just Yelp.Thank you Dino and Harry's for the concern of your customers and locals. Very disappointing.
2016-05-11,5,We had an excellent dining experience here. The staff was very accommodating since it was my fiancé's birthday and I wanted a birthday dessert for him. Our waitress was very nice and got my drink order just right (vodka club with a splash of cran and two limes.) We split the Hoboken salad and the special crab cake. Both were very good. I got the cauliflower scallops for dinner and he got the T-Bone for one. I asked him how it was and he said "if we weren't in public, I would be sucking the meat off of the bone." If that's not a great review then I don't know what is! For dessert we for the Snowboken. Do yourself a favor and order it. It was delicious! Everything about this place made for a high end dining experience from the piano player when you walk in to the furnishings. Will definitely be back!
2016-05-09,5,It's the food that earns this place the five stars. The steaks are amazing! I got mine black and blue the first time, and it was perfect. The second time I went, I ordered a rare ribeye, and again, it was perfect.The appetizers are phenomenal too - the bacon is a must-have. The service can be brusque on occasion, but it's worth the minor inconvenience for the delicious food.
2016-04-30,4,I've been to Dino and Harry's before but never put a review into anything. I finally had the chance to come back and I'm glad I did. Just like many other Hoboken restaurants, it's pretty crowded and noisy. In this place, part of that "noise" comes in the form of live entertainment, which is fun to hear. Our server was excellent and very attentive to the needs of our table. Our table ordered blue point oysters, French onion soup, and Simple Cobb type salad. The oysters were flavorful it but I didn't think they were fresh enough. The salad was simple but delicious. The French onion soup had a wholelotta cheese so I didn't take a bite of it. rib eyes and a petite filet mignon for the main entree. Our sides consisted of creamed spinach, au gratin taters, asparagus, and Mac n Cheese. My steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare. It was the right size (16oz). For dessert, we ordered the strawberry rhubarb dessert and snow broken (Oreo crumbs ice cream and coconut shavings). Both desserts were delicious! I would come back for the steaks and desserts. However I would recommend sitting away from the kitchen because the noise level in the back by that kitchen door got pretty loud so conversations turned into yelling. Hah! If you drive in, there's a parking lot a block away (they don't validate) so save yourself the hunt for a parking spot and hit the lot!
2016-04-29,5,Went to this place on Thursday evening, they had band playing and owner Dino was really nice. Food is great, atmosphere and stuff outstanding Best Hoboken Steak House !!!!!! And They have my favorite bottle of Wine Chappellet!
2016-04-25,5,It's not perfect, but, the steak is, and that's what earns the five stars. We share the porterhouse, cooked medium rare. Delicious. Also recommend the apple-wood smoked bacon. AND THE LAMB CHOPS! Best lamb I've had outside of Australia. Don't bother with the desserts.
2016-03-28,5,It's been a while so I popped up tonight...ribeye (perfectly cooked) with some gnocchi and corn brulee. And started out with the Applewood smoked bacon. One of my favorite places in Hoboken. Service excellent.
2016-03-16,5,Very delayed review but my wife and I took our son for his 14th birthday to D&H and this carnivore loved it...very happy with everything.
2016-03-12,4,For the price this is the best steak hands down! The thick cut bacon is amazing great atmosphere love this place
2016-02-25,1,I've visited Dino & Harry's a few years ago, and LOVED it. Sadly, I can't say the same about my most recent visit. I made a reservation weeks in advance, as my mother was coming to Hoboken from PA to celebrate her birthday. When 1 of our party of 5 was running late, the hostess told us there was no way the 4 of us could be seated until he arrived (which I informed her would be in a half hour). We were hoping to be seated and order appetizers and drinks until he arrived (generating the restaurant revenue). She told me when he finally arrived we would be seated. The restaurant was excessively crowded, and we shuffled around the piano/bar until our 5th finally arrived. When I returned to the hostess to inform her we were ready to be seated, I was met with attitude and told we'd have to wait another half hour for our table. We were finally seated an hour and a half after our original reservation. Our waiter treated us as if we were an inconvenience, and we had to flag down other servers for requests, like a missing baked potato (which was comped). The food was underwhelming, the ambience was loud, and the customer service was TERRIBLE. What happened Dino & Harry!? You used to be one of my favorite spots in Hoboken, but you've really disappointed me this time!
2016-02-24,4,Delicious meal and good service. I always forget how much i like it here, and when I come back I'm always pleasantly surprised.
2016-02-19,3,Just left the restaurant.... Can't complain about the food but very disappointed in the service at bar.  The female bartender was rude and this was possibly the worst service I have had a restaurant.  We were not offered water, bread, wine list etc.  She didn't seem to care that we were there except when she wanted us to leave and pay out check.  During the entire two hours we were there the bartender did not ask how we were doing or how our food was.  I'm just surprised that her behavior is acceptable, this was NOT how I wanted to spend my Friday night.
2016-02-18,1,This is probably the most disappointing experience I have had for a fine-dining experience. My boyfriend and I had been waiting to go here to celebrate our anniversary on a Friday night.  We had both checked out the menu beforehand, and were really looking forward to great food and great service.  Walking in, the ambiance is great: beautiful bar, warm lighting, piano player, etc. We were seated at a nice table in the back.  The mood changed abruptly when our server waltzed over, pad in hand, and said "What can I get you?"  - no greeting, no introduction, no explanation of food or wine menus.   We had already selected a bottle of wine and asked for more time with the food.  She unenthusiastically walked away, and was not seen again for 20 minutes.  We ordered a salad and the octopus to start, followed by the porterhouse for 2 and a side.  Our steak came out immediately!  As soon as it came out we asked about our starters.  The waitress looked confused and then told us that they were out of octopus (no apologies) but that she would bring our salad with the steak... AND THEN THE TABLE NEXT TO US WAS SERVED THE OCTOPUS.  They arrived after us and ordered after us.  We were completely flabbergasted.  The steak was good, but the whole experience was completely unsavory.  We spent close to $300 on a meal that left us with a pit in our stomachs.  Dino and Harrys, get your staff together.
2016-02-12,5,Went there the other night, again was very happy. Steak was perfect, cream spinach needed some salt but still very good. Then the mad corn Creme brulee, sounded crazy, tasted like dessert but somehow went well with dinner, thats why its offered as a side instead of dessert.Service was great, wine always good as well. All this a cool old school steak house feel with live music, what could be better?
2016-02-07,1,Wow...Not clear how people keep coming back with the lackluster service for the extremely high price.  I had reservations for a party of 5 for a Saturday evening.  Last minute, my one friend cancelled because of his sick child.  When I went to the restaurant and said we are now a party of 4, the "hostess" said well that's unfortunate- now you will need to be treated like a walk in!  We don't take reservations for less than 5.  OK ...what?  This is a restaurant that counts on customer service ?  I was about to walk out but my other friends who drove an hour wanted to wait.So we did..40 minutes...They sat us down....only to give us one menu...for four people....and left us ..for another 15 minutes.I will say...Great wine select.ion  "old school" steak menu...nothing inventive on the menu...or a reason to go back.After the appetizers were served we didn't not receive our entrees for another 55 minutes and when we did:  Two steaks overcooked..  When one one sent back (mind you $52 steaks) it basically came back raw. My one friend could barely finish her steak and asked to have it wrapped.  "Oops" they threw it out!!!!!  I cannot make this up.  This owner should sit his people down and have a long chat about customer service and consistency.....  Save your money and go ANYWHERE else in Hoboken.   Seriously...anywhere.
2016-02-06,5,We came here for Hudson restaurant week and absolutely loved it!  it has an old-time feel, like it was a place that your parents might have gone to on dates.  Definitely bustling, with an active bar and a piano player adding to the ambiance.  We ate in a back room, which I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a date experience and an opportunity to hear your dining companions.Dinner, we were blown away!  We had read the previous reviews on yelp and they did not disappoint!  We had a craving for oysters, so tried both the Oysters Maxwell (probably the biggest surprise of the evening - would definitely order again!) and six blue points (delicious, good mix of sauces served with them).  From the Restaurant Week menu, we tried the brie salad (again, what a nice surprise! loved the apple relish/garnish) and the bacon.  We both did the 14 oz sirloin and it was perfect.  I ordered rare, my boyfriend ordered it black and blue and the steaks were cooked exactly to order.  We finished with the waitress's recommendation of the toffee cake - yum!I had the meomi pinot on the menu and it was delicious - a tried and true that pairs well.  My boyfriend stated with a beer (they have a fairly limited selection) and switched to a scotch.We will definitely be coming back!
2016-02-05,5,I have been going to this spot for many years and it is fabulous! The service is good, the food is amazing! I love the ambience and the owner, Dino! I recommend the cream of spinach and filet mignon!!
2016-02-03,5,I came to Dino and Harry's for restaurant week on a Monday night. My expectations were not high, being that it was restaurant week but i was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food presented. As an app i ordered the apple-wood smoked bacon!!! IT WAS SOOO GOOD! I highly recommend it. As for my main course I ordered a 14 oz Sterlion Steak-medium well. I must say that it was just amazing! ( It should be noted that the wait time from order to getting the food was about 15 minutes. )They cooked it exactly how i wanted it and the flavor was great! The service was good but could be better. I think this was because this place was somewhat busy. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for great steak!I would rate Dino & Harry's as follows: Price is 4 Stars, Steak is 5 Stars, Atmosphere is 5 Stars and Service is 4 Stars.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-02-01,5,I went with my roommates for Hudson county restaurant week after dreaming of steak all day long. Service was average/slightly above average but food was everything id been looking forward to. Had the Brie salad to start - just the right amount of cheese (think Brie mozzarella sticks). Had the sirloin for an entree and the steak was cooked perfectly and was a beautiful cut of meat. Trio of sorbet for dessert was average, but that's my fault for ordering sorbet (trying to watch this figure :)). I'd definitely go back again for a special occasion, since a normal dinner can get fairly pricy.
2016-01-30,4,This was my third time at Dino & Harry's. It truly is the best steak I have ever eaten.  The filet mignon melted in my mouth. The rest of the menu is equally delicious. We had shrimp, salad, soup, and dessert and no one in my party had anything but rave reviews. The service is excellent. We go to Dino & Harry's for celebration dinners because the a la carte menu is pricey. There was a $40 price fixed menu available which was a good deal. I would give it 5 stars except for their use of the physical space.  It is always crowded which makes the space a little tight and noisy. I felt badly for the piano player because the noise level on this Friday night drowned out his beautiful music.One huge complaint was the bathroom situation. You have to go down dangerously steep stairs to a FREEZING basement. The bathroom was also very dinghy for a upscale thriving business.
2016-01-18,4,When in Hoboken this is our "go to" restaurant for steaks and pasta..Great service and great ambiance...also generous  drinks!!!
2016-01-18,3,I have my reservations about overpriced steakhouses, and Dino and Harry's, unfortunately, reconfirmed those. The food was very good, but the service was not even close to adequate for the price point. No initial greeting/spiel, cocktail service/recommendations, specials. Nothing. The water and bread was brought out by the busser and we didn't see our waitress until 10 minutes in when she simply said, "Are you ready to order?" Ordered a Caesar salad, the bacon, and grilled octopus to start. The bacon came out quickly and was great. Then we waited for the others. They never came. We were served our entree (the porterhouse for 2) without any acknowledgement that our salad and octopus never came. Alerted the waitress, who said they were out of octopus (they weren't; the table next to us got it 10 minutes later. It was comical) and the salad would be on the house (it wasn't, she tried to charge us for it).Porterhouse was ordered medium-rare and it came out straight mooing. We didn't say anything because it was still very good, but pretty disappointed that it wasn't played or presented by our waitress, nor were the sides.Again, food was good, but for a fine-dining price point and a final check around $250 for 2 people, the service should be attentive and impeccable. It was not close. I won't be back unless someone else is treating.
2016-01-12,5,Great steak place. My steak was good but my sides were amazing. Next time I'll get the T bone and then 5 sides! Good service and good atmosphere!
2015-11-30,5,My husband and I had dinner with our boys on a Sunday evening and I have to say these kids are still talking about it...The Steaks were incredible. We had the porterhouse for 2 and our sons all had the Sirloin Steak...the Bacon appetizer was delicious and my French Onion Soup was cheesy hot perfection...our waitress Charlotte was friendly and attentive really made you feel at home..we cant wait to go back!!!!
2015-11-28,5,I've been to a lot of Top steakhouses and I have to say Dino and Harry's is among the best.. Service is great friendly staff and the food is fantastic. Their Steak has a wonderful flavor seasoned to perfection... Go! You won't be disappointed...
2015-11-18,5,Terrific steak and a great atmosphere. My partner and I got the porterhouse for two. WOW! Huge and delicious. Fantastic wine selection, and we really enjoyed the classic vibe of the place. This is a "you get what you pay for" steakhouse. Worth it!
2015-11-05,1,In the mood for steak and not wanting to travel back into the city, or Weehawken for that matter, my fiance and myself, along with a friend decided to give it another shot here.  I wish I hadn't wasted $360.  This is the second time I've been here.  In these two times, we've ordered a total of 4 steaks.  Out of 4 steaks ordered at a steakhouse, ZERO of them have been cooked properly to temperature.  In the previous review, they may as well have served a cow on the table this thing was so rare.  This time, my fiance got a ribeye rare.  I had a T-bone, and our friend had the sirloin.  Fiance's came out Medium well (ordered rare).  Mine came out well (ordered medium). Our friends came out well (ordered medium).  It's beyond shocking to me that a STEAKHOUSE can't cook a steak properly.  My fiance knew the steak was overcooked before she cut into it just by pushing on the meat.  If she can figure this out, how is someone employeed to cook these cuts of beef not able to do it properly?Everything else was immemorable so I won't bother boring anyone else on the details since I don't remember.  Never again.
2015-10-25,1,Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!  I had been here before for a business dinner I hosted and I was not that impressed but I guess we drank so much wine I didn't pay attention that closely.  We came in late this time on a Friday and I guess the staff was ready to go (around 10PM).  The service was rushed, the wine was not what I had ordered (the year was off and when I pointed it out, the manager shrugged it off like it was no big deal - the menu listed a good year, what was served was a bad year).The steaks were charred and awful, the starters were only passable.  NOT COMING BACK!!!!!!
2015-10-07,5,Soccer Dad's night out is always a steakhouse! Decided on this as the Pope was going to be in town that day. Great choice - good location, very old school atmosphere. Smoked Bacon and Calamari as appetizers - the bacon was very good. I had the Rib Eye med-rare and it's better than Old Homestead, it was perfect (at $52, it better be). Mashed and asparagus as sides and it's a perfect steak dinner. Service was friendly and professional.
2015-09-27,2,To some this place might be nice, but I urge you to try ANY steakhouse in the city to understand how short this place falls from a service perspective. Unfortunately this place is trying to be a Manhattan steakhouse, so it's going to get reviewed like one.....I was hoping for good things based on some other reviews, but sorely disappointed. This place makes a killing taking advantage of New Jersey people that haven't travelled across the river. Instead they are presented with service comparable to IHOP with prices that arguably beat Manhattan. It started on the wrong end with attitude and waiting 45 minutes to get a table we reserved. Good thing this place is basically an Irish pub that serves steak, so we had some Manhattan priced drinks getting nudged by server traffic every 30 seconds. We tried to stay patient because this is supposedly THE place to go for steak in Hoboken.We were just about to give up and we finally got seated. On a positive note, our server was very friendly and helpful. But when I'm spending $150 per person on a meal, I expect service to match. There was our server and maybe one bus person for the whole place. We spent a lot of time with empty drinks and finished plates sitting in front of us. They didn't even refresh bread plates with appetizer plates, so I got to enjoy some bacon dipped in olive oil and bread crumbs. Then came the main course....Most steakhouses when serving steak for two will take the initiative to serve the first portion, not this place. Here's a knife, go....here's some sides, go...The food, overall, was just okay. The steaks were not the best cuts, but they were cooked as ordered. The sides were much smaller than usual places in the category. We were unable to get much more than a tablespoon serving to each of the 4 people at the table.I'll give this place 2 stars for a friendly server, but I won't be going back again.
2015-09-23,5,Dino and Harry's is always a great meal and last night was no exception. Whether it's fish, fowl or steak you can't go wrong and the variety of sides and starters is great !!
2015-09-03,3,Enjoyed my dinner. Lamb chops were perfectly cooked med. rare. I did not give it another star because it took a very long time between courses. I thought they had forgotten us. After asking the waitress why the delay she said it takes a long time to cook lamb chops!  Really?
2015-08-14,4,Came here three times over the past 6 months and the food has been consistently good.  Highlights:1) Steaks were cooked the way you ordered and were flavorful2) Thick cut bacon was always delightful3) Corn Creme Brulee Improvement Needed:1) While service is usually pretty good, there are times when the servers aren't really paying attention to your needs. Overall one of the better steakhouses in Hoboken
2015-07-31,1,Just got in with reservations and I was informed that I have to wait 10 minutes. Not impressed so far. What's the point of reservations if I have to wait for a seat.
2015-06-26,3,If I was rating Dino & Harry's on the food alone, it would easily be a 5 star experience. Unfortunately, dining is about more than just the food, so the service plays a big part in my rating. Dino & Harry's was on my boyfriend's "must try" list of Hoboken places, so we headed there for his birthday on a Saturday night. Because we had other plans that night with friends, we went for an early dinner (around 5:15). When we arrived, the restaurant was basically empty, yet we were still seated pretty far back. This wouldn't have been an issue as we were dressed in a dressy casual way, so could see why we weren't front and center. The service was chilly at best, and extremely rushed. Within a second of being seated, we were asked about drinks and our server seemed annoyed when I said that we hadn't looked at the menu yet. She was back minutes later, so we made a rushed wine decision, though our instincts were right because the wine was delicious. As soon as drinks were delivered, our waitress was back to take appetizer orders (the applewood smoked bacon for BF, Caesar salad for me). Appetizers arrived quickly. The bacon is absolutely beautiful to look at, and my boyfriend said it was incredible. The pieces are cut thick, and again according to him, are perfectly cooked. My salad was also very good - Caesar salad can sometimes taste too fishy or overdressed, but this was great. I ordered the Chilean sea bass for dinner and boyfriend ordered the filet mignon. Again, entrees arrived very quickly. The sea bass was lovely, cooked perfectly and was a great portion size. The filet was as a filet should be - cooked beautifully, which is what a steakhouse is all about. This place, as to be expected, is NOT accommodating to vegetarians, but again, it's a steakhouse so that should be assumed. Pescetarians can enjoy a variety of seafood dishes. Like I said, the food at Dino & Harry's would give the place a five star, and that may be what some are looking for, and that alone. I would not return there because for $150+ for two, I'd also like good service, which I do not think is not asking for too much. For arriving at 5:15, we were finished with wine, appetizers, and dinner by 6 pm, so not even an hour later. The experience was much too rushed for me, and not the caliber that I would expect from somewhere with such a great reputation in Hoboken.
2015-06-15,5,Great steaks, great atmosphere (a scene from "On the waterfront" was filmed here.I almost always share the porterhouse for two, great presentation and service, there are two older ladies who I like and a younger brunette named Jennifer.Drinks aren't cheap nor sides, but it's worth it in the long run.I'm not crazy about their steak sauce but their steaks are so good you don't need it.Mac and cheese a d Brussel sprouts I'd recommend.I like it better than Ruth Chris, Morton's, or Wolfgang s
2015-06-15,4,With Capital Grille, Ruth's Chris, and Morton's popping up in seemingly every mall parking lot, I embraced frequenting a local establishment for a friend's recent birthday dinner. The vibe at Dino and Harry's is spot on classic steakhouse with a mahogany, mirror, and glass bar, vintage tile floors, warmly painted walls and low lighting. The room was bustling on a Friday at 8:30, packed with rosy faced men in button downs on their second (or third) happy hour cocktails.We were seated at a table in the bar area by the front window, the hostess explaining that it was more fun there as a musician was about to begin his set. My take is we were markedly younger than other patrons and she thought we wouldn't be as bothered by the noise. It was too loud and the music, heavy on Ben Folds Five and Coldplay did not fit the environment.Of the appetizers, the thick cut applewood smoked bacon was a hit. Flavorless with unseasoned batter, the calamari was not. All of the sides, lyonnaise potatoes, macaroni and cheese, sautéed spinach, and Brussel sprouts, were delicious. Everyone in our party ordered filet. Though boring, this coincidence offered an opportunity to gauge the kitchen's skill in cooking meat to temp. We had 2 medium rare, a medium, and a medium well. I was happy to see that my medium rare filet had a hard sear outside and was warm and red in the center. All of the temperatures were perfect. When it came time for dessert, the waiter, who was notably absent after taking our orders, apologized and offered us a complimentary round of drinks, a highly appreciated gesture. The desserts were unremarkable, easily the worst part of the meal. But I enjoyed my serving of port and my friends loved their beautifully presented coffees with Bailey's. While D&H doesn't match the very best spots, it delivers a great steak without having to venture to the city.
2015-06-13,4,Great food great service. A bit loud couldn't hear the piano player, table was super small and  too close to the other tables.  I would visit again maybe not on a Friday.
2015-06-09,5,I would recommend this place to ANYONE! Both the food and the service are fantastic. It's such a nice place for both locals and visitors!
2015-05-28,2,Ordered my steak medium and they gave me it well done. Server took it back and it came out rare the second time. Overall, not a good sign of a quality steakhouse. Too many good steakhouses in nj/nyc area to come back here.
2015-04-18,5,My only regret about Dino and Harry's is that I waited so long to finally come here!!  My fiancé and I recently went here for our anniversary, and our experience all around was excellent.We started with oysters, and shared the sea bass and rib eye with a side of the creme brûlée corn and a bottle of Shiraz.The oysters were the only thing that were so so to me, just because they were very large and I prefer smaller ones.When we ordered and asked to split the two entrees, the waitress was nice enough to perfectly split the sea bass across two plates and have the chef cut up the rib eye into pieces porterhouse for two style for us.I'm not usually a huge fan of fish, but we wanted something light to start. Let me tell you, this fish was perfectly cooked! Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. The balsamic sauce it was paired with had me saying OMG and I nearly licked it off the plate!The rib eye was sheer perfection - crispy crunchy outside but a nice bleeding medium rare on the inside. Might be one of the best steaks I've ever had, and I've had Peter Lugers.  Also, the corn was amazing, it was sweet but I was expecting that and I like sweet creamed corn.  The Shiraz we had was very reasonably priced for such a fancy establishment.Also, our waitress was sweet and always made us feel like a valued customer, just wish I remembered her name so I could give her a shout out.  We will definitely be coming back for more!!
2015-04-14,2,The space is so beautiful with details that make the room really sparkle... too bad the food was mediocre (both entrees and dessert), and the service, less than genteel... felt as though we were at a diner. How disappointing.... may be have a drink at the bar and order the bacon appetizer (yum) then go for dinner elsewhere.
2015-04-13,4,Went here for a large group birthday dinner.  This is a bare knuckles, old school steak house.  It looks and feels like Peter Luger but making reservations for large parties is a lot easier.  This spot gets crowded quickly even though it's away from the crowds of downtown Hoboken.  There's a good variety of items on the menu and it's hard to think of this place as a steak house through and through given the fact that there's almost as many non-red meat choices as there are steaks on the menu.  Like most steakhouses you won't be disappointed by the seafood.  Hard to believe that butchers and connoisseurs of the cow can be so good with the meat from the sea but this is one more example of a steakhouse that serves up great oysters, clams, prawns and other seafood items.  The service is attentive and friendly and every once in a while you feel like you're in the old world confines of a Morton's, The Steakhouse of old - private, intimate, reliable with prices (not completely reasonable) to remind you of Luger or Morton's today.  However, it's definitely worth going back.  Cheers!
2015-04-06,1,Worst Steakhouse Ever. If you want a good steak don't come here. We ordered the porterhouse which came out raw. Our waitress was miserable and couldn't be found. I finally had to get up and grab a bus boy and asked him to please have the chef cook the steak a little bit more. Still no waitress. When he brought the steak back it was charred on the outside and still undercooked. (we asked for it medium) We finished our bottle of wine...still no waitress. Very poor service, menu seemed outdated. Asked for our check, yeah!!! finally saw the waitress, who BTW could care less that we were unhappy. Plopped the check down and walked away. Such a shame! We drove a good distance to try this place.
2015-03-14,2,Steaks were definitely not worth the price.  Waiter was very rushed and service was poor.  Won't go back unless I hear that they have better service and steaks that justify the very high prices.
2015-02-25,4,Excellent Porterhouse. Cooked exactly the way it should be. Cons included slow service and they were out of the 2 wines we tried to order. And the one we finally ordered came but was a different vintage from the one on the menu. Im just nitpicking thouigh becuase the steak was unexpectedlygood.
2015-02-21,4,The food and service are excellent and I like how rooted they are in Hoboken specifically and Hudson County generally.  I'm knocking a star off for the same reason I see others have: they do not execute on some little things that should be easy for a place that aspires to be a classy joint.  My party and I all came from work and it was cold so we had jackets and whatever bags we bring to work but there was no chance to check them.  The menus are also in disrepair.  Very odd things to not get right.
2015-02-19,5,Service and food was unbelievable. Made reservations for Valentine's Day and couldn't be happier with the choice I made. Didn't feel too crowded although you know they were busy. Never felt rushed at all. Drinks always filled up. Portions were amazing. Steak was really steak they were huge. I had the porterhouse and wifey had ribeye. Unbelievable flavor and cooked to perfection. The food was still just as good the next day after warming it back up from being in the fridge. Definitely would come back and definitely recommend the French onion soup, ribeye, and the porterhouse.
2015-02-17,4,A year later I went back for a second run, I was actually pleasantly surprised this time.  Steak was prepared perfectly and seasoned just enough.  Sides were scrum and they even split the wedge for us after we said we were sharing it, which was also delish.  Bottom line is they will go in to the rotation, no every week but a couple times a year for sure.
2015-02-16,2,A sad, mediocre, and ultra expensive steak house with no identity. If it's wasn't for the owner hard work, and charm, the staff, would run the place out of business in a month or so. Why's still open, is because of him. Yes, him, the owner, the Duracell charged - Martini Funny and loving man. Without him, nothing will exist.The last of the many appearances, the pretend to be millionaire club clients, and the day of stock broker seal the deal are always in the front line table; why ? Because they like to be seen..What is not to be seen instead is a high quality meat, served to an absolute imperfect temperature - Almost burned perhaps requested medium rare. I am writing this after 5 long wait dinner at D&H - how sad. The menu is a old stale amount of buttery dishes - that's don't even talk about the dessert, three out of five visits I order the entire dessert menu and they seem to have had a serious lack in identity of flavor I'm not sure the reason of why they're even on the menu if they taste the way they taste- wait how do they taste again?! It's 2015, there are a very versatile amount of restaurants and great eatery in the area opening up and ready to welcome you and your family. By the way, it's time to change those cigarettes butt smell like - waitress that hardly come to check on your table. Fastest response you get from them is a minute before you asked for the check... the check it's been dropped without notice.Sad to share these news - hoping for some changes here.
2015-02-06,4,The one and only steak house in Hoboken. Love the old school steak house feel. They have a coat check right up front. There is a long bar and several different seating areas that are cozy and romantic. We were there for Hudson Restaurant Week. The staff was friendly and quick with water refills and checkins. Nice bread selection prior to the meal. Meal was very yummy- we started with the bacon and then had the steak and for dessert had the snoboken. All was very yummy and big portions. Would love to come back for another fun and romantic night.
2015-02-05,4,One of the better steakhouse around. Come for the steak or don't come at all, actually come for the atmosphere or special occasions
2015-01-22,4,I really want to give this place five stars, but I can't. Let me clarify; five star food with good service, but some things were off that a five star restaurant would never overlook.The restaurant itself if beautiful. You feel as though you entered into history. We arrived early for a 7pm reservation to have a cocktail at the bar. The bartender made excellent drinks - I have an Old Fashioned and my wife had a dirty martini. The first thing I noticed, however is that there was no music playing, but instead ESPN was on the TV. Look I have nothing against sports...I love sports. But when I walk in to a steakhouse on a date during dinner hours I expect some music for ambience and the TV - if there is one - should be on mute. When we finished our cocktails the hostess sat us. Now mind you it's the middle of winter and we have big jackets. She never offered to take our jackets from us. As you enter the dining room you see people sitting with big bulky jackets on the backs of their chairs. I typically don't even like to check my coat, but I expect certain things when going to a traditional steak house and that's one of them. Is that weird? Anyway...When we're sat we have a beautiful table next to the window in the quiet side room. We're greeted by our waitress who drops off the menus. When I open the menu it's FILTHY. I mean really filthy. Blood and drinks stains all over the menu. Look if you're charging $50 a steak (which is worth it by quality) I expect that you are properly managed and looking through the menus daily to see where you need to print new menus. I mean they are literally printed on printer paper so it's not hard. For our dinner we ordered a bottle of the Etude Pinot Noir. Roughly a $80 bottle. Not crazy, but not inexpensive. The wine was lovely, but the bottle, like the menu was a bit dirty. It had wine spills on the label. I mean c'mon, blood on the menu, wine all over an unopened bottle. Keep it clean people. But I digress.... The food!I ordered the Filet med rare. It was perfect. I mean absolutely perfect. My wife ordered the petite filet med plus. It was also perfect. Cheers to the chef. With the steak we ordered creamed spinach and brussel sprouts. Amazing.So as I said above, I really want to give this place 5 stars. I love it and I'll return, but if you want to be the best you have to act like the best and it seems as though owners and managers are not doing their jobs 100%
2015-01-19,5,Beet salad was substantial, cocktails expertly prepared, filet perfect and tuna was done perfectly. 3 people,  1 cocktail, 1 bottle of wine, 2 salads, 3 dinners, three sides of veggies, 3 after dinner ports $500 with tip.
2015-01-09,2,First of all, we were recommended by a friend to come here so we were expecting a great experience. However, it ended up being the complete opposite. The food was definitely good but the service absolutely sucked. The hostess had such an attitude and seated us at a very isolated area of the restaurant when i clearly told the hostess it was my dad's birthday; I even put it in the description box when I made the reservation. In the end, the hostess did not care to communicate the information to our waitress and had such an attitude throughout the whole process of switching our tables. The bottom line is: the food was good but the service, especially the hostess, was absolutely awful!!
2015-01-02,4,Came here New Years Eve so this place was mobbed and looked like the staff was overwhelmed.  We actually had an issue as we had an additional person in our party and was flat-out and rudely told by the front desk that they would not accomodate any additional people.  We did not want to leave but obviously all wanted to eat together, but we had then been told if we decide to leave they will charge the credit card $50 a head.  Next comes a chat with Dino.  After explaining the situation to him he goes off on a tangent! This is a business, this and that yata yata yata.. Perhaps they were all stress as it seemed like we were being treated like jerks when we were simply asking for some options.  Anyways i'm not sure what happened but Dino's mood changed and he looked into trying to accomodate us.  In the end it could not be done but we appreciated the fact that Dino tried to do his best.  We shared some shots and ordered for 4 while the other rotated through the bar.Now comes the food part.  We ordered the porterhouses med-rare and they were outstanding.  Absolutely delicious steak.  Their steak sauce tasted like they mixed ketchup and worcestershire sauce but that didn't really bother me.  The sides were all great as well, we had the potatoes, corn and onions.Overall, the decor is what you would expect for a great steakhouse, the owner Dino turned out to be a great guy, and the food was outstanding.  I would certainly repeat.
2014-12-29,4,Great food, good service. I ordered the roasted chicken which was delicious but my boyfriend got the steak... His dish was even better. I was pushed up against a wall in a tony, dark room (poor ambiance) but besides that no complaints!
2014-12-29,5,So, Im actually annoyed with myself for not having eaten here sooner. Rookie mistake for a long time resident. I just recently came for dinner with girlfriends before the holidays and was totally thrilled with my experience and meal. I got there early so I had martini by the bar and I have to say it was absolute perfection. How hard is it to screw up a martini I know right? well trust me I've had enough crappy ones to appreciate the great. Once our party arrived we were seated promptly in the back. The atmosphere was nice old time but quaint. Loved that they have a piano player. Feels like you're taking a step back in time while you enjoy your meal.  Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. She kept the wine flowing which was much appreciated. As for the most important part.. the food. Incredible. For apps we had some oysters, shrimp tuna tartar and these short rib balls that were awesome. For entrees myself and a girlfriend ordered each the petite filet and split mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. Our steaks were cooked medium to perfection. Another friend got the scallops which she loved and the last ordered 1/2 order pasta dish. We left stuffed, tipsy and happy! This isnt your every day restaurant- well my every day restaurant- but for a special occasion or on someone else's dime this is the place to go.
2014-12-28,4,This place is amazing. We got a Caesar salad and French onion soup and then we split the porterhouse steak for 2 with a side of sauteed spinach. The soup was the best French onion I have ever had. It was delicious. The salad was good but you could really taste the anchovies in the dressing. I'm sure most people like that and that's probably how real Caesar salads are supposed to taste but I wasn't a huge fan. The steak was insanely good though. It was cooked perfectly and the outside had this crispy crust on it that we couldn't stop talking about. We were so full but we ate the whole thing because we couldn't stop. The spinach was really good too. I've been here 3 times and have never been disappointed with a meal. It's really expensive but it's worth it when you want a good steak once in a while.
2014-12-22,5,GREAT food and beautiful restaurant. Our server was super friendly and very funny! Will be back for sure :)
2014-12-19,4,It really is a beautiful setting if you like the dark wood, stain glass, steakhouse look.  There is a big bar as you walk in that is welcoming and well run.  We had octopus for an app., shared a chopped salad and on to one sirloin, one rib-eye, and one salmon.  All very good.  Service was good, not great.  Wine list is very appropriate with good  prices.  I like having a solid steakhouse in town without crossing the river.  Is it the best you will ever go to?  Probably not, but no complaints.  As all good steakhouses go it is not cheap.  There is also, as always, a strong testosterone feel to steakhouses.
2014-11-18,2,Two experiences here, both decidedly two stars.  (I'm not happy about this either.)  First time my husband and I came it was our first week in Hoboken and we decided Dino & Harry's would be a great celebratory dinner to celebrate our move from NYC.  We used to live down the block from Knickerbocker Bar & Grill in Greenwich Village and were hoping that Dino & Harry's would be our new neighborhood steakhouse and we could eat there once a week like we did at Knickerbockers... unfortunately, we left the experience knowing that would not be happening!  We didn't make reservations so we were seated at the bar... which didn't phase us at all because we LOVE sitting at the bar.  However, this particular bartender didn't acknowledge us upon sitting down, we had to ask for menus and he didn't seem to care that a drunk guy was crowding me and spilled his white wine on me (obviously a regular as the bartender knew him by first name).  As our dinner progressed and my husband and I were trying to enjoy ourselves, the bartender continued to ignore us and talk over us to the drunk group next to us and specifically the drunk guy who took up standing behind me.  I was pretty disgusted as I thought this would be an upscale steakhouse.  I had the sea bass and it was decent.. but I was bitter that my $34 entree order yielded such a ridiculously poor service experience!  We left highly disappointed and feeling pretty much disrespected.Three months later we decided to give it another shot since, well, there aren't many steak options in Hoboken.  This time we made a reservation and were treated kindly by the waitstaff.  They were highly professional and did their best to serve us.  However, I feel the kitchen failed us this second time.  My husband ordered a T bone steak, which he enjoyed and was cooked exactly as he wanted (medium rare).  I was not so lucky.  I ordered a special of the day, which was a skirt or flank steak that came with string beans.  I also specified I would like it medium rare.  When it came to me, the steak was completely cooked through and there was so much juice on my plate that my steak and string beans was swimming in liquid.  The dish was just totally unappetizing.  My husband's steak was perfect though.  I guess my lesson learned is order the steak... straight up!  I would give it another shot but so far not impressed.
2014-11-11,1,Hostesses are rude and obnoxious. Zero customer service skills. I won't come back after being a loyal customer for 10 years.
2014-11-10,1,Writing this in efforts of making myself feel better about the awful service we received here. We came to celebrate my boyfriend graduating from his MBA program. While they do not take reservations on Saturday nights, I called earlier in the week to see what time they suggest we get there for the best chance of getting sat. They recommended we come at 7PM, which we did. The restaurant was fairly empty and we were told it would only be 20 min for a table. My mother lives out of state and had also called earlier in the week to inquire about buying us a bottle of wine to be sent to the table as her way of saying "Congrats" She was told she would have to call the night of, no problem. My mom calls shortly after our arrival to purchase the bottle of Wine and was told "We're too busy, sorry". She was infuriated, as was I. You're too busy to take $125 dollars? That makes sense... After being told lie after lie from the Hostess about how "our table was being set", "we're giving the server time to catch up", etc etc....We were finally sat almost 2 hours later. Everyone that walked in the door after us, got sat before us, but yet they don't take reservations? I have no problem waiting, but I do have a problem with being lied too, and basically indirectly being told everyone else in there was more important that you are. They food isn't that great to be treated like garbage. I'll go into the city and make a reservation and get an even better steak, thanks. Meanwhile we still ended up spending over $300 dollars, totally not worth it. So turned off I don't think I'll go back. Thank you for ruining a special night for us, I'll take my business elsewhere next time.
2014-10-27,2,So I will start my review with Dino and/or Harry himself, whom seem to be confused as to why people are actually calling the restaurant when picking up the phone. Whether it's to make or confirm a reservation, the man behind the phone is short, snippy, and utterly confused. I made a reservation for 7 people about 30 days in advance, again Dino/Harry seemed unsure on the phone as to why I was calling so far in advance, but this is supposed to be the best steakhouse in Hoboken right? Arrived Friday night to an "upscale steakhouse" that looked no different inside then a local Irish dive bar. Told the hostess our party was here and they gave the typical answer that everyone needs to be present in order to seat us. We waited, took up the entire entrance of the place, were basically sitting on the piano, until they allowed us to sit at our table 1 foot away while still waiting for 1 more person to show up. I asked for a table in the back and they said they could not accommodate a table of 7 at the moment back there, but then again, did someone actually call over a month in advance for a table? Onto the service, our waiter was good, did not find him overly friendly or overly accommodating. Felt that we had to pick his brain to ask him what he recommended. For appetizers we orders oysters, bacon, the short rib special, and the fried calamari. The table seemed to enjoy them but I recommend skipping out the fried calamari (definitely came from a frozen bag). Onto the entrees, I will speak for myself only, I ordered the fillet minion, which had 0 taste. No joke, no taste at all. Ordered it medium, it came out medium well........and it was tough to cut. Others at the table ordered other cuts of meat and they really enjoyed it. It seems those cuts (prime rib, porter house) had more flavor then the fillet. For sides I had the string beans and French fries, pretty standard, pretty tasty.  For dessert, it always perplexes me as to why a restaurant would not offer a chocolate option. The "snowboken" was the chocolcate dessert, which consisted of VANILLA icecream coconut, oreo crumbs, and chocolate drizzle. It was good, but I wanted something chocolate.  I had a bite of the toffee cake, it was warm and it was the closest thing I was going to get to an actual chocolate dessert. So in conclusion, I guess I cannot compare this place to NYC steakhouses. But definitely does not come close, does not compare, and there is no need for me to come back to this place again.
2014-10-13,4,Beautiful ambiance. Feels very upscale and is one of the nicer restaurants in Hoboken. My bf and I ordered salads for appetizer and filet mignon and creamed spinach for dinner.The Caesar salad was a bit bland dressing wise, it needed salt or parmesan cheese. I had the Hoboken Salad, that was tasty, light and good. The steak was excellent except that our medium cooked steaks were both rare in the middle. Creamed spinach was good but a little too creamy for my taste. I will go again but order a medium well cooked steak next time, and probably order the potatoes as a side dish, as the table next to us had them and they looked excellent.
2014-10-02,4,Excellent, upscale restaurant in uptown Hoboken. You get what you pay for. It's very expensive but you are getting great quality food.  This was the best filet mignon I've ever had (granted I haven't been to many upscale steakhouses).  I ordered the 6oz petite filet mignon with mushrooms. It was like butter! So delicious! My only negative comment would be that the mushrooms were a bit too salty for my taste. But they were still great. The ambiance is perfect for a romantic date or special occasion. I would definitely go back.
2014-10-02,4,Went there last night for dinner and the food was AMAZING! First of all the bacon appetizer is unreal. So are the oysters-I could have just eaten those two and been completely satisfied. My entree was the petite filet & Brussels sprouts. So so good!!! I loved it here. The place was average size but felt intimate. They're was a man playing the piano-it sounded so nice while we were eating. The only "complaint" I have is that the service wasn't great. The waitress was nice but didn't check in as often as she shoud have. We had to flag her down several times & the place wasn't even  packed. Other than that A+
2014-09-19,5,The place is the best.  Good food, good vibe, good service.  Food comes out quickly.  Well priced.  Been going for years, will continue to go for years too.  I saw a bad 1 star review on here about a woman being followed to the sidewalk.  I highly doubt this happened, not the owner and staff here.  I've found that when people write a book long negative review about places, it's usually spite and unwarranted, often false.  Look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews here.  Place is awesome
2014-09-07,5,Excellent restaurant in Hoboken! Nice dinner by candle light, with a live piano player in the background. Food was amazing...for starters we got the oysters maxwell which was very good. The highlight of course was my sirloin which melted in my mouth. Best steak I ever had! Lastly, we got the strawberry rhubarb for dessert which was a nice mix of hot and cold with the vanilla ice cream. Very expensive but highly recommend for a special dinner!
2014-09-07,5,Best filet mignon I've ever had in my life. Worth every penny... Can't wait to come back!
2014-09-05,5,I love this place.Last time I dined here was during Hudson Restaurant Week.  The pre-fixe consisted of three courses.  My appetizer was a thick cut slab of smoked applewood bacon.  It was perfect.  My wife had mussels which she also greatly enjoyed.Both of us chose a 14 oz porter steak with bleu cheese butter for our entree - medium rare of course.  The was spread just right to maximize the flavor and the steak was cooked very nicely.  I tried a ricotta cheesecake for dessert which was very good.The service was great as well.  Our waitress was not overbearing nor did she ever leave us in the cold.  You can't ask for better than that.
2014-08-25,3,Came here with a buddy to enjoy some steak.  Filet Mignon was great, cooked perfectly and super tender.  Sides were delicious.  Definitely closer to the $$$$ side though.  The atmosphere was very chill, piano playing, not packed.  Good for a business outing.
2014-08-19,3,It's good, not spectacular by any means, but good.  Service is a bit spotty and the seating is odd (got shoved in a corner even though the place was empty).  The meat is very well cooked... everything else is ok.  Wine is pretty pricey.  Typical Hoboken.
2014-08-07,5,Oh yea, the steak is good too. Dino's has so many delicious dishes always perfectly cooked. And the dishes come as complete meals, as opposed to the steaks which are generally a la carte as in most steakhouses. The salads are perfect, sides amazing (a secret is the hash browns), and all courses consistent and tasty. We also just went for restaurant week and that was fantastic! Compared to other steak places this is a great deal and love the diversity of the menu. We find we can never go wrong here.
2014-08-05,5,We hit Dino & Harry's last night, as soon as we got into town. Absolutely amazing. Everything was on point. I had the bone in ribeye, it was cooked perfectly. The sides were great and the wine, Flora Springs, Trilogy, 2010, was delicious. The staff was very accommodating, and our experience couldn't have been better.
2014-08-04,5,Incredible food, but obviously expensive, so more of a "special occasion" place
2014-08-03,3,Food was good but over priced, after hearing such great things we expected much more. We saved this place for my boyfriends birthday... When I made the reservation the receptionist sounded like it was his first time doing it and seemed extremely confused. So I called back to confirm the night before, and that person sounded equally as puzzled. I didn't think making a reservation for 2 people at 7 pm was that difficult! In addition I had requested a surprise dessert to be delivered at the end of our meal and that message failed to be passed along. Our waitress also seemed like the most miserable person in the world. The steaks were well cooked and the portions were large but definitely not the best stake I've ever had. And $10 for a side of plain boring mashed potatoes is a joke! Whereas the Brussels sprouts were amazing and well worth the $10. The scallops entree and tuna tartare were delicious and well priced. The wine also seemed over priced... It was cheaper to get individual glasses then to get a bottle which doesn't make any sense. Overall the food was good but not mind blowing as expected. Disappointed with the pricing and staff. Would go elsewhere.
2014-06-21,4,Me and my husband went there for our anniversary. Really romantic atmosphere with live piano music. Food was amazing, we loved bacon for appetizer and porterhouse for main dish.The place is pricey but it's worth it.The only thing we didn't like that the waiter was always in a rush. But we understand it was very busy that evening. Highly recommend for some special occasion.
2014-06-17,4,Always a great place, food is very consistent and one of the finer dining experiences in Hoboken.
2014-06-03,5,Excellent food, excellent atmosphere, excellent service.  The only problem is they don't take reservations on Saturday nights for small parties. Other than that it is great and even worth the wait on a Saturday night!
2014-05-19,3,Very good steaks, but just very expensive.  Service is just ok for the prices but not bad by any means.  I did see that the staff when closing down was in gym shorts/jeans etc which I found pretty unprofessional.Also not really a big deal but they don't validate parking anymore even though it says they do here on yelp, so may want to change that.
2014-05-03,5,Expensive but well worth it. This is a classic steak house with a very nice bar, incredible food, very attentive service. We consider it our go-to for a nice evening out.
2014-04-27,2,Food was amazing but the service was terrible. Both hostesses hardly acknowledged my boyfriend and I when we walked in. Neither smiled or looked happy to be working there. Our server was the same..not friendly, didn't smile and rushed us through dinner. She also forgot to put in my friends scallops and didn't even apologize, just tried to blame the kitchen. So her food came out after everyone else was halfway through their meal. Found out when she dropped the check that gratuity was included already bc we were a party of 6. That explained a lot. Probably won't go back...no matter how great the food is I want a friendly staff making me feel good about spending hundreds of dollars on steak and wine.
2014-03-31,3,This former Frankie and Johnnies steakhouse serves up high end dry aged steak dishes at high end prices.An ala cart menue that includes all the "big boy " steak selections you could want, as well as pasta and sea food dishes that rival some of the top NY steak houses.For me it's hard to beat the bone in ribeye , with sides of creamed spinach and baked potato.Complete with classic NY steak house looks (dark wood interior,high cielings, piano bar etc) all it seems to lack is the service of a high end place.My wife and I have been coming here for years to celebrate special occasions, in fact,  I proposed here nearly 12 years ago!And let's just say it's always an adventure.On several occasions I have made reservations here only to be told there was no record of it. Each time they found a table and made it work.The "highlight " came shortly after our engagement when we came here during the Xmass holidays to have our parents meet for the first time, another special occasion for sure.I actually called the owner Dino a week earlier when I personally made the reservation. I told him how I was planning this special evening, and asked for a nice table to be put aside for the occasion. He was cool and was on board with the plans.I pulled up front checked in with the valet attendant , and checked our coats.The place was decorated so beauitifly for the holiday, with the full size Christmas tree, and the piano player in the bar area, decorations adorn the entire restaurant.It seemed the perfect setting for the family's first meeting together.We all went to the bar and got to know each other while I checked in with the hostess only to be told, you guessed it ...     "what reservation." ?!!  Ugh! I then saw Dino, sitting at a large table of partying people ,enjoying a meal . He was deep into conversation and drink, unapproachable to help - just perfect! Once again, they eventually found us a suitable table and we enjoyed our meal just a table away from where I proposed to my wife a month earlier.Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and the evening was a good one .We got out coats , the valet brought up our car and home we went.Once home, I found another persons car keys in my jacket pocket, the one I checked in at the restaurant. I called them and asked if they were missing Saab car keys , they didn't seem to care, but did ask if I could return them right then. It was now nearly 11:00 pm and I had a house ful of guests, so I wasn't about to drive the 30 minuets back there .Again, they didn't seem to care one way or another. I felt bad for whose ever keys they were. Meanwhile, what happened here? Did they use my jacket to park another persons car and forget to put the keys on their board for return!??? I must say that the food is typically good here and I will go back, knowing full well that anything can happen, least of which will be the enjoyment of a great tasting steak dinner...
2014-03-26,5,Porterhouse. Calamari. Ommegang on Tap. All Wonderful.
2014-03-22,2,I went here with my boyfriend for a dinner date! We ordered the porterhouse for two that was $99! It's undeniable that the steak was good, but it was definitely not worth the money!The atmosphere was nice and quiet, and I had a wonderful meal! but I don't think I'm coming back, it was wayyyyy overpriced.
2014-02-28,4,Went here on recommendation from friend. This is a very nice steakhouse, by any standard, and won't hesitate to return. The selections are plentiful, and both mine and my partner's steaks were done perfectly (I like med rare, she likes med). The side were delicious...sauteed green beans and mashed potatoes.The wine list is nice, not overwhelming, but broad.The only thing  that prevents a 5 star rating is the desert menu, which left me without desert. perhaps if the creme brulee wasn't *espresso*, I'd have tried it...The staff is attentive without being overbearing, the wait was not bad.Watch out for the parking...all the streets are residential permit only, so we ended up in the garage around the corner...but that's was all of $8.00. not an issue, IMO.bottom line...go for diner and socializing. you wont be disappointed.
2014-02-19,5,If there was an option for 10 Stars I would give that! This place is the BEST steakhouse I've been too thus far. I took my dad here for his birthday along with my boyfriend and it was by far one of the best dinners. The Oysters were so fresh, I could have eaten another dozen, very well cleaned and perfect balance for the horseradish cocktail sauce. I had the lamb chops which were amazing, my bf had the blue cheese encrusted steak which I was allowed a small bite of and the flavor was absolutely incredible. Dad had the calf's liver with bacon and onion which he thoroughly enjoyed as well. We had a few bottles of the Simi Pinot Noir wine (stellar!) And to finish off the evening, the chocolate cake. This is the second time I've been here and cannot WAIT to go back! The steaks are perfectly seasoned and just melt in your mouth! Book without hesitation!
2014-02-19,4,Wonderful Steakhouse. Our absolute go to when I visit from California for a small town, great service steakhouse. I am a man that loves to eat at the bar with my lady. We always enjoy the times here and our meal is simple: go in looking nice,  smiling,  order jameson and beers, sharing oysters, more drinks,  pork belly,  a wedge,  and a medium rare bone -in rib eye (sliced), shots with the bartenders if possible,  and a delicious Snowboken for dessert. Kisses all around and a fun walk home. Try it.  Cheers.
2014-02-01,4,It's our first time here. Food was great. Drink was awesome. Piano was beautiful. But later guitar sucked badly...just simply annoying.
2014-02-01,2,Decent steak but terrible service.  I've only been here a few times over a 3 year period, but each time I had a bad experience with the server.  They seem real nice to the regulars, but treat everybody else with indifference.  I understand that you may be understaffed, as it seemed like the whole restaurant was covered by two servers.  But if you're selling $50 steak, you better have full coverage.  This isn't the Malibu Diner.  We started out with with dirty martinis, which were not bad.  We mentioned to the server that we wanted to order wine with dinner so we kept the wine list at the table.  We then got some fantastic oysters and jumbo shrimp for appetizers  Then the server stopped by for a second to asked if we wanted another drink but we took 3 seconds too long to find the bottle we wanted so she hurried away from the table, not to be seen again until just after the entree came.  At that point we ordered glasses of wine, instead of a full bottle so she lost the restaurant about $40.  I would have loved to enjoyed a bottle of wine, but instead we got a glass with about five bites of food left.I ordered the ribeye and the GF had a filet (as always).  Hers was great and mine was super fatty.  But what I could eat was very good.  The brussel sprouts and pancetta was good but the potato au gratin was bland and sort of watery.  We received the glasses of wine halfway through dinner but they turned out to be good.  After dinner, I'd normally be in the mood to order dessert, but I just wanted to get out of there after that experience.I feel like because it's been popular for so many years, that they are getting a little complacent.  Time to get some fresh staff in there, to match the food prices.
2014-01-26,5,Went to Dino & Harry's last night with a group of four for a friend's birthday. The reservations were made online and the date somehow got switched, so we showed up unknowingly reservation-less. They were very accommodating and were still able to seat us within 20 minutes. We ordered crab cakes as an appetizer and everyone loved their meal. They brought out pumpkin cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting and candles as the pianist played the birthday song for my friend- also delicious. After dessert we ordered a bottle of champagne, sat around and chatted for a while and never felt any pressure to get out or pay the bill. The waiter Louie was awesome, everything was great. Definitely will be back!
2014-01-21,4,My boyfriend and I went to Dino & Harry's for our anniversary last week. We weren't aware that it was Hudson Restaurant Week, and appreciated that we weren't pressured to order from the Restaurant Week or regular menu. We did both end up going with the Restaurant Week menu since the selections were good and the price was even better. I had an arugula salad to start, which was just okay, and my boyfriend had the bacon, which he said was amazing (I'd assume so, since he didn't let me try any!). We both had the 16 oz. sirloin, medium rare, as our main dish, and both were cooked perfectly. The seasonings they used on the steaks were delicious as well, and the 16 oz. size gave us plenty of leftovers to take home. For dessert we both had the molten chocolate cake, which was excellent. I'd also like to note that the service and the meal were paced perfectly - our server didn't try to rush us (I was afraid this might happen since we ordered from the Restaurant Week menu) and each course was well-timed.The ambiance upon walking into the restaurant is nice - it definitely has that old-school steakhouse look. There was a pianist playing in the bar area, and it would have been nice to sit near the action. The bar and restaurant were loud and pretty crowded, but we were sat in a strange little hallway-like area near the windows which, while quiet and cozy, wasn't the ideal spot for us.All in all we had a very nice dinner, and hopefully we'll be back for another special occasion.
2014-01-20,2,This restaurant hates babies. Dino hates babies. The hostess hates babies. Let's set the scene: 2 couples and a baby go out for a steak during restaurant week. Make reservations via Open Table and in the notes section request room for a baby accompanying us to dinner. I arrive early, check in with the hostess. Hostess scolds me for making the incorrect reservation, I apologize. She agrees to seat us reluctantly but once again reiterates how wrong I was in making the reservation incorrectly... Once again I apologize and thank her for accommodating us and allow us to eat their $50 steak. We get seated quickly, once again get scolded since our friends arrive 10 mins late after looking for parking. At this time, I'm annoyed - we get it lady, you're impeccable and we're the worst at being diners. Cut to: being seated. All's well, waitress is friendly, can't wait to eat steak. A man comes over and introduces himself as Dino. Rants for about 5 minutes on how wrong we were in bringing a baby without calling ahead. I tell him I wrote it in the notes section in the reservation. He says he is too busy to read notes. I apologize. Sorry, my psychic powers were turned off that day. He continues rant about how accommodating they were in allowing us to eat at his establishment. Friendly waitress then profusely apologizes for Dino's behavior. We eat good steak, mediocre wine and chocolatety dessert. A for food; F for customer service.
2014-01-15,5,What a place! Simply a great local joint for those in / close to Hoboken.Old school steakhouse atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food!I usually start with the bacon and possibly a wedge salad or shrimp cocktail and then cap the night off with a beautiful Porterhouse or Filet, depending on my appetite.Wash it all down with a glass of wine or your choice of cocktail and you have yourself one of those great Hoboken nights.
2013-12-09,1,I've been going to D&H's for several years and never had a problem. Always enjoyed the food and service.Unfortunately, this past Saturday night my opinion of this place changed forever. A few points to preface. First of all, my wife, son and I have probably eaten here half a dozen times in 2013 alone. We always come between 5:30pm and 6pm and never have an issue getting a seat. Also, they do not take reservations, so it is first come first serve. On Saturday, we brought our nephews so we had five people in total. When we arrive, at 5:55pm to a restaurant that is 75% EMPTY, the hostess says it is going to be a problem seating us because a party of over four people needs a reservation. I hate when restaurants go in between like this. Either require a reservation or don't. There is no point in doing both.She checks with the manager and they say the next time they can seat us is 7:30pm. This is impossible since my son is 2 and would be a wild man halfway through dinner at that time. This brings up another interesting point. They are counting my son as a fifth when a two-year-old really shouldn't count in the equation.Since they were unwilling to help us out, even though we had three children, all under the age of 10, we left. The manager sensed we were quite angry and chased after us saying "what do you want me to do it's the holidays, I have a lot of parties coming".Maybe take care of your best customers, especially when they are trying to show their nephews a nice dinner in Hoboken.I will never go here again. I hope they don't treat future families like this or they'll be out of business quickly in a town that has a lot of other dining options.
2013-12-08,4,I was here for an all-guys birthday dinner. Great place for that... steak and Scotch in an upscale atmosphere. We had the fried calamari and empanadas for apps, both delicious. I had one of the specials, the 18 oz. sirloin steak covered in blue cheese... and it was delicious. A few of the guys got the 24 oz. Porterhouse... man that steak is a beast... and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Another enjoyed his filet. All-in-all, a good time.
2013-11-29,4,Went here last Saturday (11/23) with my boyfriend with no reservations and we were seated quickly, which was surprising as it was past 7. We sat at a cozy table for two in the back and ordered a glass of wine each (I ordered the 1919 Malbec and he ordered Merlot), both of which were excellent. For appetizers, I had the crab cake with remoulade sauce and he had French onion soup. The crab cake was huge and could almost have been a meal, and was stuffed with giant pieces of succulent crab meat. For our main entrees, I ordered pan-roasted salmon with potatoes in a boullionaise sauce and my boyfriend ordered porterhouse steak (medium rare). The salmon was cooked perfectly, but was so large I couldn't finish it. Likewise, my boyfriend couldn't even get through half his steak. The service was pretty good, if a little slow, but a word of caution: do NOT eat any of the flatbread sticks in the bread basket. They are highly addictive.
2013-11-16,2,Cannot believe that this joint has gone down hill so fast.  We've been here a number of times and the the steaks were generally pretty good.  Last night all the food was way below average.  Bone in filet was just bad- the salad was tasteless the fish was dry...the good things were the piano player and the $150 bottle of wine I purchased.  Our very expensive meal as a means of celebration had us leaving very fast without eating even half of our entrees...it used to be so much better.  Note to management:  the quality of food that you're buying is saving you money but you're losing customers as a result.
2013-11-14,5,THE BEST SIRLOIN I HAVE EVER HAD. PERIOD. (I worked in a big name steakhouse in manhattan for 10 years...) The service rocked also. Love the old school experience. A LOT.
2013-10-18,2,Picked up to-go while on business in Hoboken.  Typical steak house atmosphere, nothing special and neither was the food.  My biggest beef, :), with this place was the service.  I will give them the benefit of the doubt, being that it was only 6:00, however the hostess literally pointed me to the bar without saying a word.  The bartender, just gave me my total.  That was it, no hello or good bye or anything else for that matter.  And to cap off the horrible service, they didn't even add silverware to the bag.  Wont go back.
2013-09-10,1,Everything about this place was terrible.Tables on top of one another with no ambience whatsoever. Old decor and a dirty bathroom. Now onto the food.... I ordered the rib Eye and half of it was complete fat. My girlfriend ordered the sirloin and asked for medium and it was overcooked.
2013-09-10,1,If you've ever had good steak and service, don't bother going here.  My husband and I were craving a nice steak dinner (think Striphouse or even Del Frisco's) and this place has a pretty good reputation (in Hoboken).  We were so disappointed.  It felt like we were dining on a groupon - based on the quality of the food and service.  The waitress acted as though she was working at Ponderosa and gave us an attitude when we wanted to change one of the selections we made.  The tables are packed on top of one another.  Don't bother trying the strawberry shortcake dessert - it's basically a scone which tastes as though it's made out of crisco.  For a better local alternative (still not great) go to Ruth's Chris in Edgewater.
2013-08-29,3,Went here for a surprise 40th birthday party.  The place itself is really nice, the decor is old school with lots of dark, rich woods (rich Mahogany anyone?)  I had the Porterhouse steak, which was OK.  The filet side was like butter, so tender.  The sirloin side was a little more tough, even though I asked for it medium, it was more medium/well.  Overall, I am not a huge steak guy though I was not disappointed going here.
2013-08-28,5,My experience at Dino & Harry's was long overdue after multiple recommendations on the place. I had only seen the restaurant from the outside for quite some time before I said screw it and made a reservation for my birthday. The best way to describe Dino & Harry's is that it's a necessary establishment that belongs in Hoboken. This is the only steakhouse in Hoboken that matters. Yes, there are restaurants that have good steak in Hoboken. But this place has it all. Between service, ambience, and excellent food, I'd recommend Dino & Harry's to anyone who's looking for a great steakhouse experience. Sure, you can visit Ruth Chris in Weehawken, but it's not the same. There's nothing about Dino & Harry's that feels like it's a chain or franchise. The best part? I am a little unclear on whether I had a bone-in ribeye or NY strip. But I will say it was perhaps one of the best cuts of meat I have ever had.
2013-08-26,4,A MUST for Hudson restaurant week! Also a really nice place for a special dinner out. The bacon appetizer is dreamy.
2013-08-09,4,Never had a bad meal here.  I stick with the ribeye and porterhouse for two.  The applewood bacon app is great and the Brussels sprouts and pancetta is a great side
2013-07-28,4,I love this place. I usually go for steak but tried the ravioli last night and it was the best I have ever had. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was not so lucky with his choice. He got the penne with chicken and it looked, tasted, and smelled awful; like a frozen dinner. This was the only bad experience we have ever had here, but everything else is delicious.
2013-07-07,5,Between atmosphere, hospitality, service and food, this restaurant is the holy grail of fine dining in Hoboken. Upon walking in, the stately decor is intriguingly offset by the diverse combination of both old and young diners. My boyfriend and I were sat in a cozy nook by the windows, off of the main dining room. The loudness of the dining room was pleasantly muffled and made for a romantic experience.Our server was a lovely, grandma-esque lady who was attentive but not overbearing. We began our meal with the Salmon Tartare, which was incredible. A perfect combination of the fresh fish flavorfully combined with ingredients that stood alone yet melded together in harmony.Our main course was the 48oz Porterhouse for 2 - Medium Rare, Augratin Potatoes and Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta. The steak was very well seasoned (perhaps, for some, overseasoned) with a nice dark crust, and the Filet portion was perfection. Unfortunately, we discovered that the New York Strip side was gristly and inedible for the price tag. Our waitress realized something was wrong, so we told her our disappointment with the steak. Without hesitation, she offered us an entirely new Porterhouse, despite the fact we had demolished the Filet side. Seeing so much meat as overkill, we suggested that she simply bring out a new NY Strip, which she quickly fulfilled.We left Dino & Harry's with full bellies, an entire meal of leftovers, a bill charging us only for a NY Strip versus our 48oz Porterhouse, and a renewed faith in humanity.
2013-06-17,2,I called 3 weeks in advance for a reservation for father's day.  Upon arrival the unfriendly hostess told me we'd have to sit directly behind the hostess stand in the bar area as all of the other tables in the restaurant were reserved.  Food was good as usual and service was friendly.  As we went to leave I realized the 15 other 4 person tables had not been used at all during our hour and a half meal.  Super disappointing especially on a holiday.  We won't be returning.
2013-05-26,5,I came here to celebrate an anniversary with my girlfriend. Very classy place with live musicians playing on certain days. Service was excellent. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and delighted to answer any questions about the menu and wine in detail.  The salmon was delectable and the steak even more amazing. Quite possibly the best in all of Hoboken. Definitely pricey, but they definitely know what it means to create the perfect dining experience.
2013-05-16,5,I'm a fan of this place.  Came here with two other people, both meat eaters and I'm a vegetarian.  We had the octopus appetizer, salads, steaks, three veggie sides (asparagus grilled, broccoli steamed and the sautéed broccoli rabe).  Also had a baked potato.  It was all very well prepared.  Given that I got three veggie sides each cooked a different way it was a nice surprise to see that they did each one just right.  The guys had a t-bone and a filet and both were really happy.  We had visited a Ruth's Chris a couple weeks ago and my date said the steak here was more flavorful, and really tender.  For dessert we had the molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream and the Snoboken, which was like a chocolate sundae with oreos and coconut flakes.  That was not shared but was completely finished.  The molten chocolate cake was really good, warm and gooey as promised.Amongst us there were three draft beers, one Hendriks and tonic, one sambucca, sparkling water, two decaf coffees and an iced tea.  The total without tip was $254.  Service was professional and efficient, nothing came wrong and the timing was good so we left $60 tip.Must also point out that the music at Dino & Harry's is really good.  We came at 8pm on a Thursday and there was a pianist adding, like someone else pointed out, a nice touch.  Toward the end of the night a three person band came on.  Looked like a cello being played as a base, a guitar and I think bongo drums.  Sounded odd, but it was great.   We lingered after dinner just to enjoy them.  The music sounded original and the singer had a terrific voice.  The set-up of the restaurant is such that the music can be enjoyed without taking over the dinner, unless you're in the bar area.I'd come again just for the ambience.  It has real charm, they're confident and it's very comfortable.
2013-05-09,2,Had an 8 pm reservation on a Friday night. My wife and I had a table so close to other diners that we couldn't hear each other over their convos. Prices were a bit high, and my wife's chicken/pasta dish was mediocre. I loved the salmon though. This was supposed to be a nice date night for us, but we didn't enjoy the atmosphere because we could hardly talk to each other over the music and other diners. Won't be returning.
2013-04-14,4,#MeatcomaI guess I should update- since my last review, I have in fact joined the dark side. I just shared a porterhouse for two with my husband (medium rare, obvi) and it was absolutely luscious. A nice char but still mooing inside, with just the right amount of fat cocooning it. Whew. I need a cigarette. Again we ended up here when we couldn't get a table anywhere else and it was a happy mistake. The pianist playing "We are never getting back together" and a generous pour for my glass of Malbec made for a perfect evening.
2013-04-12,4,Have been going here since Dino was associated with Frankie and Johnies - New York, locally known as On the Waterfront.   There is never a wait (for me) for a table. Probably helps to be a regular.  Waitstaff is long standing and very helpful and polite. Prices are medium to high.  Food is good to excellent.  Chopped salad is among the best - anywhere.  I am not a meat eater (anymore) but the fresh fish is excellent. If you want to eat in the very  that Marlon Brando danced with Eva Marie Saint in "On the Waterfront" go here!  If you want to have a drink at the bar where Karl Malden slapped Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront" ; go here!.
2013-03-24,3,The food is certainly 4 or 5 star quality. Let me get that out of the way early in the review. My deductions come in the other aspects of the restaurant experience.Food*Nice selection of steaks and prepared expertly. Our table had 3 filets and a ribeye and all that was left was the bone.*Sides of asparagus, potatoes, and mac 'n cheese. The mac was a bit plain, but fine nevertheless. *Tremendous bread basket.*Tempting dessert menu. Sorbets were flavorful and a deceptively generous portion. Looks small in the dish but kept us working for a bit.Drinks*Really great wine menu. No matter what your palette, they'll have something for you by the glass or the bottle. Reasonably priced by the glass, too, or as reasonable as you can expect.*I'd love to go back for a glass of wine or cocktail at the bar to kick off a night.Service*Here's one star off. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, although didn't seem entirely confident. He just seemed to go missing for stretches at a time. We had an early reservation and the place was pretty empty for most of the meal, so not sure where he went. He also forgot one of the sides we ordered but it didn't show up on the bill so no harm, no foul. Turns out we didn't reall yneed it anyways. He also had some trouble maneuvering around the table. Plates also stayed on the table for a looooonnngggg time before getting cleared. Maybe there was a disconnect between service and bussers, but just wasn't the well-practiced service I'd expect from some place with such a reputation.Appointment*The atmosphere is very charming. Beautiful space with nice features and designs.*Piano is a nice touch.*It is a unique place for Hoboken...*...until the crowd starts showing up, then it's Jersey with the capital J. D&H is running a business and I get that means having to seat everyone, but what happened to class and social graces at going to nice restaurants? Bar filled up with central casting Jersey guidos. One guy in a track suit, others in jeans and tight shirts. Swearing, yelling over each other. Boisterous and obnoxious. The tables seated next as our night wound down were the trashy stereotypes. Talking on their phones, absolutely hilarious outfits/hair styles/tans/makeup, and just didn't know how to act. Just zero class. Glad our bill came when it did.*Factor in the piano and the goombas and it was impossible to hear anyone at our table, but we heard loud and clear that "yeah, mah sistah's comin' from bayonne, save huhr a seat. hey, tommy how ya balls?"Great meal, so-so service (or maybe just someone new, in which case, much respect), really awful crowd. Been wanting to try it for awhile and glad it's crossed off. Not sure I'd go back because there are plenty of steakhouses that know how to how to attract, manage, and filter the right type of crowd.
2013-03-22,5,I went to Dino and Harry's with my family of 6. First and foremost, the staff was genuinely engaging, friendly and attentive from the second that you walk into this warm old-style Hoboken atmosphere. We had a reservation (made about a week in advance) and had no issues. Although we arrived right on time, we opted to have a drink at the bar prior to being seated and there was no rush to sit down. Once seated, our meal was just excellent. I personally split the hearts of lettuce salad, porterhouse steak and the truffled shrimp risotto with my sister; all of which were amazing and I recommend to everyone who goes. No one at the table had anything but greats reviews for each and every item on the table. We also sat just outside Eli Manning and David Diehl's table which had the curtain drawn after they walked in... that wasn't so bad either :)
2013-03-17,2,Went with the recommendation of the waitress, which was the ribeye.  Ordered it medium-rare and was not overly impressed.  Service was sub-par, it was very hard to get in touch with my waitress.  I would consider going back but i would absolutely not not to expect a great dinner.
2013-02-23,4,We enjoyed a fine meal at Dino and Harry's last night. The place has old-school charm with a jazz pianist and a dark, wood interior.Drinks are well made and service was quite good (although not quite up to snuff for the prices.)  The meals were excellent. We started ours with the tomato and onion appetizer, served with an excellent blue cheese vinaigrette. My wife's filet medallions were quite substantial and I enjoyed the petite filet and baked potato. The cuts were very good and preparation was tasty.All in all, this is a very good place for steak and a quiet dinner. It is a touch pricey and I'm not sure the food and service quite matched the expense, but I'd still return.
2013-02-06,5,I was told this was a best steak house in the area.   Better than Peter Lugers. I had the chopped hearts of lettuce with blue cheese and bacon.  Amazing!  Had the 10oz filet which was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The service was top notch as well.  Very polite staff. The ambience is very classy. I will be back for sure.  It's embarrassing I've been living the area this long and haven't been here before. Cheers Dino and Harry!
2013-01-12,4,The last time I made it to D&H's was on a holiday weekend, and it was an incredibly mild scene.  Though the food & service were great, it was a lackluster evening.  This time, was exactly the opposite!My fiance & I had dinner here last night, and loved every minute!  The bar scene was vibrant, with a piano going & people crowding around.  We sat at a table in the back.  I will say that it was crowded, and the table next to us may as well have joined us.  Would be nice if they took one or two tables out to make it a little more comfortable.Beyond that, I have NO complaints!  I had a martini, Hendricks, which they were glad to garnish with a cucumber (try it, trust me), and she had a Cabernet.  We started with some Blue Point oysters, and moved seamlessly into our entrees - she had the Rib Eye & I the T Bone, which we accompanied with the ridiculously good mashed potatoes & some sauteed spinach.Great cuts of steak cooked perfectly.  Nothing more to say about that.Another update from last visit: the service was great.  Prompt, friendly, accurate.  What more do you need?$$$$, but with two 24oz steaks, we have enough for lunch today!
2013-01-04,4,After reading many positive reviews about Dino and Harry's me and my wife decided to give the place a try. I was already expecting a Peter Lugers type of masculine atmosphere and there were no surprises in that department, the atmosphere is simple and classic. We ordered the appetizer of thick cut bacon which was very flavorful and my wife had the special butternut squash soup which left a lot to be desired flavor wise.  for dinner we had the 24 oz ribeye which was very well flavored and aged to perfection and the petite filet was buttery and very juicy. For sides we ordered a baked potato and creamed spinach, both very good and we washed it down with a bottle of Valpolicella. Service was very straight forward and no frills which was fine but felt more like a diner than a nice steakhouse and the host could have been more personable as well but like most reviews state you go here for the steaks, and steaks only.
2013-01-02,5,It is the best steak (and maybe restaurant) in Hoboken, and, yes, New York City as well. The only possible superior steak would be from Peter Lugers in Brooklyn but, if you are already in Hoboken, why go to there? Seriously, anyone that gives this place a less-than-stellar review either had the rare misfortune of getting a bad cut of meat, work for another restaurant, or feels slighted by the down-to-earth service (for the record, the service is great, but some people just need the continual white-glove, ass-kissing service that some restaurants have). The steaks are unreal (even though the sirloin is the signature cut, try the filet--comes in petite and large varieties). They also have a gorgeous porterhouse, with both the sirloin and filet, but I prefer the off-the-bone filet the best; a-la-carte sides are amazing (creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and tomatoes and onions are my favorite) and the appetizers are very good (shrimp cocktail, especially). Additionally, they just started doing a pasta dish (ravioli of the day kinda thing). Without a doubt, the best pasta I have ever had, and this includes Italy, an Italian mother, and Augustinos in town. My only complaint is that the pasta is a bit pricey for what you get, but it is so difficult to make and made to order, so I understand the cost. Therefore, my complaint is nullified. I routinely go here with some other extraordinarily finicky eaters and we are always loved and impressed by this placeFor the record, I do not work here, so its not one of those fake reviews. I just noticed that there were no reviews and people should know how amazing this place is.
2012-12-17,3,I loved the food at Dino and Harry's so my rating is based on the whole experience. I had the tomato/basil soup for an appetizer, which I must say may be the best I have ever had. It was thick and bisque-like so I really enjoyed it. For dinner I had the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the porterhouse. Although both were medium rare, I thought his steak was way more flavorful. Either way I enjoyed both ! For sides we had the lobster mac and cheese which was to die for and the mashed potatoes, also very good. They had a great wine selection and the drinks were nicely made. So why not 5 stars you ask? Well for starters the hostess sat us almost 40 minutes after our reservation. She was on her cell phone when we arrived and after about a minute looked up so I could tell her my name. For the 40 minutes we were at the bar (which was not bad since we had some coctails) she proceeded to tell us that she didnt know where the bus boy was and that our table would be cleaned any minute. This was not very professional at all. Once seated our server was a little slow getting everything to us and only checked on us about once. The ambiance was very loud as well. Not what I expected for an upscale steakhouse. All in all, if you don't mind mediocre service and disruptive noise while eating this will probably be your favorite steak joint.
2012-12-16,1,Looked forward to finally eating here after walking by so many times on our way home from working in the city. Friday night, 7 pm, bar is full, piano player in a festive mood, no one seated at a table, ahhh yes. We didn't make it past the two hostess's who looked us over like we had two heads and said there was an hour wait. My boyfriend who is much easier going then me, politely asked if they could get us in sooner, being their were empty tables. No explanation of why we couldn't, no offer to us to have a drink at the bar, just a look like, go away.Very disappointed, maybe they should have read the book, "How to Make Friends and Influence People". I must say, the coat check person was very sweet and polite, too bad she was not at the hostess' desk.
2012-11-16,2,The good: Staff is friendly, and the restaurant lends itself well to that steakhouse vibe. Oh, and my steak was cooked exactly how I asked for it.The bad: The quality of the steak did not seem to be Prime, nevermind aged. The sides were ok, but not of the quality one would expect from this establishment, or the glowing reviews found here. Finally, the espresso was something you'd get from Dunkin Donuts: no crema, kind of bitter, probably overextracted.I'm not sure I'd go again. There was simply nothing outstanding about my experience with them.
2012-11-14,2,Not a person in the placeand we get walked to a little side alcove. Felt very alone...candles were not lit till after we ordered the wine.Sevice is OK...but we saw more of the bus boys than the waitress...Bread...seriously...commercial bread sticks with sesame seeds,  bland COLD baguette...maybe local but about as pedestrian as you can get...butter was close to frozenOdered a Caesar Salad...please...I know this tells them I am a scum... but it should have been alot better...chopped lettuce,  dressing was light...and it came so fast you knew they had them either plated or someone was just waiting...pacing in a nice place is important...at least make me feel like you did some work on it.Bottle of Heitz Cellars Cab...best thing about the night...but if you are having trouble keeping the wine room stocked...the waitress should not look at a cheat sheet and go "Whew...we have that one...great!"By the way...the list says "05"...we got an "07"...Steaks came...my ribeye was medium...not a juicy bite in it...the cap meat along the outside which is the best part of the steak was well done. Don't tell me to send it back...it was $45.  My partner had a sirloin...it looked fine.Steak was tough...did not seem aged...it looked good....tasted good with the House made Steak sauce. on the tableScalloped poptatoes were fine...a little sparse but tasty.Salad, Steak, Wine Potato ...230 bucks...plus tip   which I am OK with.Bus boy offered to box up leftovers (Waitress???)...each of us had some steak...and some potatioes...he put the potatoes in a huge tin foil pan...and when I opened the steaks when I got home...one was missing. Oh well...we left after about an hour...two large parties had come in...place was still empty...the owner was at the bar talking...he waved thanks...what would it have taken to come over to our table and say hello...I might not be writing this...We had a great time because the wine was terrific and the steaks passable...but for a five star place...Zagat rated...didn't do it for me.
2012-11-06,5,This is my FAVORITE place to eat in Hoboken. The food is devine, the atmosphere is sophiscated and classy and the service is the best.
2012-10-29,4,I had a great steak and a great time at Dino and Harry's.  But for one mistake, this would have been a five star experience.The Mistake:  I ordered my porterhouse medium rare, I got it medium well.  This is obviously a huge mistake.  However, this can't be the chef's fault.  Steak chefs know how to cook a steak medium rare.  Odds are, the server plated and served me the wrong steak. I showed the server my overcooked steak, she apologized and returned the steak to the kitchen.The Fix:   I had a perfectly cooked, delicious medium rare steak on my plate within 10 minutes.  Steak was tender with that hearty, buttery flavor I love.  Before I had my steak, I enjoyed the applewood smoked bacon appetizer, which was delicious.  Although this spot is expensive, you certainly get what you pay for.  Considering the amount of food/drink we ordered, our tab really wasn't that bad. Come here for a special occasion or guy's night out.  Say hello to Dino if you see him around.  I met him and he's awesome (you'll know him when you see him).  I'm looking forward to coming back.
2012-10-06,2,The two star description says it all.  I've experienced better.  One would expect that they would give you a great steak since it has been there for a long time, and is a bit famous.  I did not get one of those good ones!   As usual, I bought a local deals thing for Dino and Harry's, so I am not all broken up about it since it did not cost me full price.  What I was not happy about was that after I mentioned I had brought the coupon, the waitress was no longer as friendly.  The bus boy was great though.  If I took two sips of my water, he was already over there filling it back up.As for the steaks...they are nice sized.  Maybe they put some salt and pepper on them to add flavor.  I had the ribeye steak.  It was one of the fattier ribeyes I have had.  It was not cooked right either.  I asked for it medium rare, and got it pretty rare.  I ate it anyway since I was really hungry!  She had the strip steak.  It was good, but not great.  I am a believer in you get what you pay for, so I expect to have a great meal if the restaurant charges a lot for their entres.  I didn't think that was the case here.
2012-09-30,4,Excellent Local Steakhouse!  After 3 visits, I rank this as my fourth favorite steakhouse.  I recommend the Sirloin Steak (rare) as your main with either the trio of empanadas or the calamari to start.  Generally, I always go with the Rib Eye at most steakhouses, but after having both, the Sirloin Steak edges out the Rib Eye by a little bit.As far as dessert goes, The SnoBoken is great, but I drop the coconut flakes because I hate coconut.  Oh, non-steak foods you say?  Wife had the daily ravioli entree (wild mushroom) and it was excellent (for not being a rare piece of meat).  The side's are solid,  but nothing stands out as well as the Sirloin.
2012-09-27,4,I went here during Hoboken restaurant week because there was a great deal.  The place is quite nice/classy inside.  I had a bacon appetizer that was tasty if you like bacon, and was a larger portion size than I was expecting.  For my entree I had a filet, which was very flavorful and cooked great to the temp I ordered (rare).  I also had a side dish of gnocchi which was also very good.
2012-09-05,5,Over a year has passed since my previous review of this restaurant and we decided to give the place another try being that we wanted steak but not Manhattan. Glad we did.     The food, like my last visit was excellent. Tuna over salad was nice but too small for the $17 price tag. Bacon, excellent as were the fried onions. Really scrumptious. The hit of the night was the 24oz bone-in rib-eye steak. Cooked to a perfect rare, juicy, tender and full of steak flavor.Best steak I've had in a while. Totally worth the $44 price.      Best of all, the service was nice and pleasant. Piano player in the bar was a nice touch. None of the negatives from my last visit, thus the 5 star rating. The only negative is the price. For me this is a special occasion restaurant only since the bill was $300 bucks, before tip. Ouch. Unfortunately, steak houses have become prohibitively expensive, though we certainly over did it, this time.
2012-09-03,4,We really enjoyed ourselves here. The food was great and our waitress was very attentive. Enjoyed the piano player as well.
2012-07-28,5,Best steakhouse in Hoboken. Applewood smoked bacon appetizer was amazing! Lovely wines. Can't fault the fantastic service. Absolutely delicious melty steak. Wife is still drooling over the cheesecake. AND they have a piano player!!
2012-07-28,4,One of the perks of being good at your job is a free a dinner once a quarter.  Luckily it was an awesome dinner.  I opted for the ribeye (medium) and man was that bad boy all kinds of yummy!  I'm a big boy and can eat but I was no match for that big slab of meat.  In retrospect I should've skipped appetizers and started w.desert.  Sadly since there was no room in my belly I skipped desert.
2012-07-18,4,My best friend lives in Hoboken and we always go to Dino & Harry's with our boyfriends. My friend and I don't like red meat and didn't think we'd be crazy about the restaurant but we were presently surprised. The shrimp risotto and scallops are delicious!  The wine list has a great selections and the live piano create a great atmosphere. I've enjoyed myself and had a great meal every time I've went!
2012-07-16,5,I love this place.   The porterhouse for 2 is the best cut you can get.   Don't get the one, don't get the porterhouse for 3, Stick with the 2.    Don't know why but they don't cook up the same as the porterhouse for 2.   I don't agree with the reviews here that say service is bad.  I've been to this place at least 25 times and the same servers have been there for awhile.   They have always been top notch in my opinion.   The ambiance is great, the dishes are great and I simply love coming here.    Every person i've brought to this steak house loves it.   The owner is great too.   A real nice guy.
2012-06-20,2,Steaks were overlooked - black & blue was medium at best. Dining room was at least 78 degrees. Not worth the time or $$$.
2012-06-08,5,My husband and I LOVE going to this steakhouse. Nothing like walking to the movies and eat at Dino & Harry's :) All steaks and pastas are yummy. Great service. Love the ambiance, different from all the college bars in downtown.
2012-05-30,5,We are long time customer's of Dino & Harry's 20 Years. Love the food, a wonderful wine selection and the best service in town. I also like the crispy chicken. The food, the music and the people - a great combination.
2012-05-09,4,If I was poppin' dollaz I would be at Dino & Harry's every week.  Sadly, I live the meager lifestyle of a recession-era college graduate, so I will be saving my pennies for my next trip.I've had a few steakhouse experiences in my life (all on other peoples' dimes, of course), and have to say this is the best steakhouse I've been to.My BF and I went for a quiet Sunday night dinner and were happy we did.  I loved the quiet and intimate setting of the side room off of the main dining room/bar area.  The waitstaff was very helpful and knowledgeable in both the food and wine menu.My BF had the porterhouse, and I had the pork chops.  Both were fantastic and very large (we both ended up having enough leftovers to gorge ourselves for lunch the next day).  I could have asked for better quality and quantity of the asparagus side dish we ordered, but the potatoes au gratin were out of sight.But I have to say the highlight of the meal was dessert: New-York style cheesecake.  I've made and consumed a lot of cheesecake in my day, and have to say it's the best cheesecake I've ever had!  It was incredibly creamy and not overly-sweet like most, with a delicate strawberry sauce on top.  Even if I can't afford to do the entire meal experience again sometime soon, I will go back for a cocktail or espresso (also incredible) and a piece of that cheesecake.
2012-05-04,4,It's no Ben and Jack's, but considering it's 10 blocks away from me, I'll take it. We made our second trip there this past Sunday night. We tried the bacon, which was cut a lot thicker than we would have liked. We also got our usual Porterhouse for two, black and blue, and it was cooked perfectly, although it took a looooong time to come out. The sides are fairly average. You can skip them if you're really just in it for the meat.Definitely the best steak in Hoboken. And we saw Artie Lange on the way out!
2012-04-27,2,Thé fond was not as great as thé place for sure.The clam sauce was just ok, very tomatoe tasty! Thé Brad was not fresh.Thé béarnaise sauce cost $4 and was not réally good. Thé potatoes augratin was more creamy Than cheesy!I think that you pay thé design of thé place and the live music, but defenetely not what you are eating! I Will not go back.
2012-04-18,4,After knocking back a few mugs at the local beer garden one night, we decided to go out in a blaze of glory and cap it off with steaks. Seating/host seems to be an issue for some of the other yelp reviewers but we got here at 9PM on a Saturday w no reservations, and were still seated within minutes. Like to believe we got by due to our looks & charm, but it's probable we just got really, really lucky.We ordered the porterhouse for three. How a steak is cooked is pretty subjective -different strokes for different folks - and we ordered ours medium rare and it was prepared just as we liked it. Sliced, sizzling and served with the bone. No complaints, with plenty of red right down the middle. Certainly one of the best I've had recently.We also ordered a side of asparagus and creamed spinach. Sides seem to always be a hit or miss at steak houses, but I personally enjoyed the spinach. We skipped dessert. All in all, an excellent meal - don't think I've ever stuffed this much red meat down the gullet. Totally content, my friends and I made a solemn, brotherly vow to hit the gym the next day as we bloated our way back home.
2012-03-12,5,Hands down the best steak house in this area. It also helps that it's only 1 block from my home. :)
2012-02-24,5,Went for drinks and stayed for dinner.We ate at the bar even though they had a table for us.Firstly the lovely girl behind the bar was so friendly and welcoming,and knew how to make a Margarita, from scratch no horrible mix!She was very knowledgeable about the food menu, and made some goodrecommendations, I went with her suggestion and had the petite filetmignon,OMG it was Delicious cooked to perfection, my husband had the same.For a starter (appetizer) they made us the most wonderful Greek salad(not on the menu) having a Greek Daddy am fussy when it comes to Greeksalads it was spot on.We were introduced to the owner Dino who was a really lovely chap,again very welcoming.The fellow playing the piano is sooo amazing, I made a request for any Sinatrasong and he played a complete medley, all without music, it was wonderful,the whole evening was such a lovely experience, would really recommend it,prices a little bit high but totally worth it........ don't hesitate go and enjoy.
2012-02-12,1,I would recommend checking out David S. review a few before mine. I went to dinner with him and a few of our friends. His experience was a little worse than mine as he ended up waiting longer than the rest of us for his food, don't get me wrong I also waited waaaay toooo damn long.I'm looking through other reviews and just can't figure out why they are so high for this restaurant. Maybe it's because when you first walk into a restaurant you really do feel like you're in a steak house, I for one always care about ambiance but that doesn't compensate for all the other negatives.Service was terrible, the waitress was nice but once again that doesn't compensate for fact that we waited so long for our orders. Took about 20 minutes after sitting down to even get a chance to order wine, in the mean time we had to split 2 pieces of bread between the seven of us. It was restauant week so you knew everyone was going to order appetizer, entree, and desert. So why was it so difficult to bring each of the courses out together? there were 3 appetizers to choose from and we ended up ordering at least one of each for the table but they all came at different times, personally i feel so awkward having to eat my food as a friend sits there without his arriving yet. then by the time his arrived we were already getting our entree. This isn't applebees so i don't understand why the service was so poor.D&H is supposed to be a steakhouse, so how come every single one of our steaks was cooked incorrectly. Either undercooked or overcooked, I'd understand if some of the other food wasn't done right since it can be expected from a steakhouse but how can you scew up the only staple a steakhouse is supposed to have?As far as i can tell the only part of meal that surprised everyone was how delicious the snowboken desert was. But once again, this was a steakhouse so how can the desert be best part of the meal?
2012-02-06,3,I would give a star higher had the first steak I received not been too tough to eat.  I ordered a porterhouse and I couldn't even cut the one side because of the fat. Now, this happens with steak at times (it shouldn't happen often at a supposed great place) but I would give them a pass since they asked me what I wanted and brought me a filet instead.  The filet was excellent.  The brocolli rabe was very good and the potato and salad was very good.  The other not-so-positive comment I would make is they weren't too apologetic over the bad steak and a manager didn't come over to check on us about the bad steak.  Also, we weren't even offered a complimentary drink or dessert.  The food, service and ambiance were good, but this place is very pricey.  It's about equal to a Ruth's Cris.  I would probably pick a Ruth's Cris or Morton's over this place at equal cost (Or, Delfrisco).  However, it's more convenient than those others for me.  It was $200 before tip for two people.
2012-02-03,1,I went there with several friends for restaurant week because I've heard great things about this Dino & Harry's only to be terribly disappointed. We went on Wednesday night and it was fairly busy, but no more so than on a typical weekend night. After waiting several attempts to gain our waitress's attention, we finally succeeded in ordering a bottle of wine, which took no less than 20 minutes to receive. We had nearly finished the entire wine bottle by the time someone came to take our order. There were 3 different choices of appetizers for restaurant week and between the table we had ordered all 3. The soup came rather quickly. After a reasonable wait, the salads finally arrived. Everyone tried to be polite and wait for everyone to get their food but at some point it became intolerable. The soup and salad eaters had finished their appetizers, and had their plates cleared before the bacon orders were served. At this point I had waited so long for my food that I would have eaten it raw, it wasn't raw, in fact it was cooked just fine but I for steakhouse bacon, I would say its OK at best.After another extensive wait, the steaks were served. We rejoiced as a table even though we had to wait another 5 minutes for the last person to get their steak because there "wasn't space on serving platter." Personally, I had requested my steak to be served medium-rare, if I had ordered medium-well, I would still have considered a bit over cooked. I have never sent back food at a restaurant but I was really considering it this time. If I wasn't aching from the hunger and didn't think that it would be another half hour before I received a replacement, I think I would have in this case. I'm not picky with my food, especially steak, but this was far too dry to enjoy, even in my state of hunger. Just about everyone at the table faced a similar problem, of the 7 of us that went, 1 received their steak cooked as ordered.The desert did not take long to come out and was quite enjoyable. Everyone was happy with their desert order. This did not make up for how poor the rest of the dining experience was. The dinner in total took 2:45, cost $66/person, and the food was far below expectations.TL;DR The dinner took forever, the food was sub-par, the steaks were not cooked as ordered
2012-02-01,3,Steak - delicious.Arugula salad - perfectly dressed (pairing it with beets and goat cheese is a little too obvious, but it's a great starter).Creme Brulee - NOT creme brulee. I almost walked back to the kitchen to do a little demo on how to make proper creamy custard. "Dulce de Leche" is also not really a tasty version of it. The atmosphere was amazing. There was a piano player (reading sheet music from an iPad!), playing classics and new hits. The wait staff and runners were pleasant. I see other reviewers raving about the wine list, but it is definitely not impressive. I can think of at least 10 bottles of Oregon pinot noirs and California cabernets that would pair well with steak and would be on the more affordable end. No need to put La Crema, Santa Margherita and Sebastiani on there as the "affordable" options.Overall very pleasant experience, but I had to voice my disapprovals :)
2012-01-29,5,If you love steak, this is a great place.  I went here for my birthday recently.  My Dad and I split the Porterhouse for two.  It was incredible.  We had a few great bottles of Pinot Noir to compliment it.When it comes to steak, Dino and Harry's is fantastic.  I highly recommend it.
2012-01-18,4,Just a quick one - I read the blistering reviews regarding the service, so expected the worst when coming for a business dinner last week.  I was pleasantly surprised - everyone, from the hostess, to the coat checker, to the bartender, and to our servers were all very pleasant, welcoming and accommodating.  I didn't really stress the service with special requests, but in any case it was great.  Superb steak, really outstanding.  Classic old-school atmosphere - nothing has changed here in decades, and it's good to see.  It's pricey as others have noted, but comparable to any higher end steakhouse.  Excellent experience.
2012-01-08,4,I made a reservation online but when I arrived they said that even though I had a reservation I had to wait 45 minutes for a table for two.  Despite that, they were nice enough to give us a call when our table was ready (we went to another bar to kill some time).  As with other reviews, don't go here and expect great service, just go here for the food.  The hostess wasn't very friendly and I think I only saw our server when she took our order and when she dropped off the check.  We both ordered steaks which were cooked perfectly (medium rare) and tasted awesome.  We also ordered sides of spinach and mashed potatoes which also were amazing.The old school decor makes for a very nice ambience also.  Five stars if the service was better, but definitely going back.
2011-10-28,5,amazing night all around. my +1 is fabulous and took me here because it's one of his favorite restaurants in hoboken and he was so surprised that i'd never been. we didn't need a reservation but i assume you would want to call just to check availability, especially on the weekends. i enjoyed the hoboken salad for an appetizer (yummy dressing!), him the french onion soup (lots of cheese!), and we both had steaks and red wine for dinner with the asparagus and au gratin potatoes - make sure you order the potatoes! mmm potatoes... our waitress was so very attentive and reminded me of a really awesome blackjack dealer (bonus!). great service, great food, great company. i'm already looking forward to going back.. for the potatoes, and to try the dessert!
2011-10-04,5,Here's the Deal: I've been to this restaurant many times...I've never had a bad meal...love the environment, the owner is always around to ensure you're having a great experience.   You can catch some celebrities or athletes coming in from time to time!   They provide a great variety of wines and an experienced staff always makes this place special!   And oh...their Porterhouse for two is amazing...
2011-09-04,5,The people who write bad reviews about this place should get their head out of their but and maybe that big stick too. Top notch food- service- atmosphere.
2011-08-02,4,Came here during Hudson Restaurant Week with my girlfriend.  Prix Fixe menu included the steak as an entree, so after all the great things I heard about it I got it.  Pretty small filet, but you have to expect that at most steakhouses or anywhere to be honest.  I started with the applewood smoked bacon with coleslaw which was delicious.. ambience was great, drinks were pretty expensive but we saved a bunch with the prix fixe so it wasn't a big deal.  Desert was amazing, if there definitely get the snoboken (mix of chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and coconut in a wine/cocktail glass, delicious!)would recommend the steak to any steak fan and my girlfriend got the ravioli which was also delicious.
2011-07-29,5,Still outstanding food in an old-school environment.  Piano/bass two piece band greets you when you walk in.  I thought the service, aside from someone in our party speaking to someone who was rude on the phone, was otherwise excellent.The steak is far and away the best in Hoboken.  Our table shared a bunch of appetizers - empanadas, calamari, bacon - all excellent (although I like the longer strips of the double cut bacon as opposed to the shorter, quadruple cut they served), and everyone passed around 2x porterhouse ($88ea)  for 2 and a ribeye ($43 maybe?), everyone's two favorite cuts, and either was as good as any steak I've had.  Wine list featured a wide price range, starting at $30.
2011-07-28,4,Very big and bold flavors however some times it was overdone (salad was very intense with too much dressing). Steak was excellent but maybe not New Jersey's best. The wine list lacked wines by the glass but if you asked for that, they have it, but not on a menu. If you like bacon, the app is incredibly flavorful but full of fat.
2011-07-25,4,Food *****Petite Fillet, Sirloin, Lamb Chops were all up to par and flavorfulNote- "medium rare" is closer to medium, but lets not play that gameDecor ****Pretty cozy away from the bar...bathrooms were nothing to write aboutServiceNo I did not forget the stars, it was totally lacking. Our waiter had no personality but managed to give us some attitude. The owner also wasn't super friendly.Overall ****Reviews are about food and ambiance therefore I would return. Definitely a great steak spot in Hoboken, and an enjoyable night.
2011-06-21,3,great porter house   ... sides were  ok ....very pricey but i will be back .... like the vibe there and i hear the quality in the steak has been there forever
2011-06-12,3,Great Steak - Big old style steak house a-la-Jersey.  You can imagine Tony Soprano and the boys sitting at a big table in the back chowing down on monster steaks that would feed a whole village in hungrier parts of the world.  As other's have written here, the hostess is awful.  I suppose if they know you it's different but both times we went she seemed dis-interested, talking with other staff and rude.  Get past that to the bar, particularly on Satuday when Frank (I think that's his name) is there, and its lot's of fun.We ate at the bar the first time and the food did not disappoint.  Unless you are a linebacker for the Giants most ordinary people can share a steak entre.  The brussel sprout and spinach sides were great.  Pretty typical steakhouse fare but well done.  The meat itself was tender and juicy.  The next time we went, the hostess was also impossible and we sat at the table in the big room.  The waitress who had probably been there since they filmed "On the Waterfront" there in the early 50s was pleasant and all business but the food from salad to entres all arrived at once and we felt rushed.  This is full retail steak house pricing so we think the service and front of the house aspect could be improved.  Honestly - would Tony Soprano and Phil Letardo be happy if the steak arrived 2 seconds after the clams???    Notwithstanding - we would go back because it's still the best steak this side of the river.
2011-06-06,3,Went here with my husband for his birthday dinner.  The food was fine.  It came out way too quickly, though.  We were in and out in under an hour.  I get that steak doesn't take a long time to cook, but I didn't like how quickly our courses came out.  Steakhouses don't generally do it for me, and it looks like that goes for this one as well.
2011-06-03,4,Old location of Frankie and Jonnys. Very good steak but very pricey for hoboken. I would rather spend that much money in the city. I knew going in there it was going to be expensive but at least expected to be slightly cheap than the city. If this place was in the City it competes with other top steak houses for quality of food, service, and atmosphere.
2011-05-06,4,The food is absolutely amazing, and the service from our waitstaff has been consistently great.  I do take a star off, b/c to agree with another reviewer - the hostess is just terrible.  We were greeted with a scowl, and giving our name (and spelling it), she said "For 4?"  We responded "No, just 2" and were met with a hostile "Well, SOMEONE called.'  We assured her nobody in our party had, and she said that the (name somewhat similar to ours, but clearly different) party had made a short notice res.  We are generally very easygoing people, but had to correct her in an equally curt fashion.   Response: "Oh, yeah, here you are... OK"They were NOT busy, so there was absolutely no reason for the rushed/terrible greeting.  Again, a fantastic place otherwise.  You can't beat the historic setting and great food. - if you can get through the front door without your heart rate being raised.
2011-04-16,1,Awful experience! Hostess didn't greet us when we arrived. She sat there with her arms crossed and looked annoyed that we were trying to check in for our reservation. We went to the bar to have a drink. When we asked the hostess about sitting down, she said you have to sit right now, otherwise you'll have to wait. We said that we were ready to sit and she asked us are we sure. At that point we turned back to the bar, amazed at the way we were being treated. The hostess came back over to us and at that point we told her that she was rude to us and we decided to leave. On the way out the hostess & presumably the owners (a man & a woman) were at the hostess stand and the woman said to the other two, "they're canceling their reservation". I was astonished that no one cared that a party was walking out of their restaurant w/o even asking why. I told the owner that they have terrible service and an attitude and that I would be writing a negative review about our experience. He followed me outside and said that I threatened him!!!! My husband got upset and told him not to speak to a woman like that.  He took out his cell phone and offered to "see how many cops he could get there". He caused a scene on the street and everyone inside the restaurant could see what was unfolding. Someone from the restaurant had to bring him inside b/c he was following us to the corner screaming at us. Don't go here if you expect to be treated like a human being!
2011-04-02,1,Where do I start? We made reservations for 8PM, but we had to wait 15 mins to be seated at a table that was clearly available, and ready, to be seated.  To pass the time, we sat at the bar waiting until the bartender felt like taking our order.  Once seated at the aforementioned table, our server promptly greeted us and took our orders.  Our bread, wine, and raw oysters came out promptly but I can't say the same for our steaks.  It took over 80 mins for our steaks to arrive from the time we placed our order.  The server said it took longer due to the party in the back.  However, the table next to us got their food ahead of us, yet they showed up later than we did!   My steak was decent, but I've had better without having to drop $42.  It was more on the mid-well side than mid-rare.  But at that point, I just wanted to finish and leave.  The brussel sprouts seemed like it had an identity crisis and they should've been ashamed of their mac & cheese.  Our server comped us for a round of drinks and a piece of chocolate cake.  Nice try, if she didn't seem indifferent half the night, or if it wasn't a different server that finally gave us the bill.  Perhaps we showed up on the wrong night.  It happens.  Or perhaps we don't fit the Hoboken/Dino and Harry's demographic.  It happens.What a way to celebrate our 5 year anniversary!  I will be perfectly happy going to Arthur's next time or even going to Manhattan where you pay more, but you get more.
2011-02-16,4,This place is expensive but delicious!  I enjoyed thoroughly.  The porterhouse for 2 was so delicious. The $9 brussell sprouts were amazing though lacking in quantity.  The desert was great.  Again expensive but a really great steak and quality of food. I even forgot the best part - the special appetizer - the Crab Cakes - AMAZING!A decent ambiance, a live piano player - they have free parking - I would go back for a special occasion.
2011-02-05,3,Food was good but the service was terrible. We waited 30 minutes for our table to be ready and two hours until we got our dinner! Sadly, I will have to think twice before heading back.
2011-01-13,5,Best steakhous ever. the porterhouse and filet mignon is fantastic the best i've ever had.
2011-01-07,4,My girlfriend and I went there for an end of a "stay-cation" dinner. It was a Monday night, but I called and got reservations anyway, but we really didn't need one. When we arrived the hostess was very friendly and said we could sit anywhere we want because it was slow. First off, this place is beautiful inside, cherry wood bar, beautiful ceiling and a great ambiance. I'm not much for a modern feel so I instantly fell in love. There was also one guy playing piano and another a stand up bass...awesome!I ordered the Prime Rib and a side of potatoes au gratin. My girlfriend ordered the Jumbo Shrimp. I don't eat seafood but she said it was excellent. The Prime Rib was cooked perfect and tasted like heaven. The au gratin was also spectacular, not for those counting calories though, lots of cheese and heavy cream. We weren't in the wine mood so I can't really speak to their selection. The waitress was friendly and helpful, kind of the no BS type which I like. She said nah, you need to get this, and get it cooked like this...and she was spot on! We ordered the Snowboken for desert, it was chocolate fudge coated in a wine class with chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream and coconut on top. It was delicious as well. Not the best desert I've ever had but very good.I don't like to give 5 stars, but it was definitely worth the trip and I'd definitely return. The only problem was the annoying kid whose parents couldn't control, and she was like 10 and her voice carried over the whole place, really annoying when it trumps the piano and bass directly behind me. At the end of the meal the waitress just kinda plopped the check down and that was it, no "thank you or good night" to me that's just something that's standard, especially as someone who waited tables for 5 years. The host was great and called us a cab too. I'd definitely check this out again!We came back again, had the same waitress, older lady. She is actually a riot, dry sense of humor. Cracked me up!
2011-01-04,5,Used to go here when it was Frankie & Johnnie's and I ate steak. They change the name and I stop eating meat. I think it's incredible! I am writing this for all the non-steak lovers that get dragged here by their carnivorous friends. I am a fish and poultry girl but will definitely have a filet here and there. But let me tell you, I ate every piece of fish imaginable here and it was all delectable! Started with oysters and shrimp cocktail. Oysters were fresh and decent size. Shrimp were colossal. Crabcake special was next (yes, we devoured a million apps) and it was tons of lump crabmeat, not just a packed piece of breading with some crab thrown in. I opted for the cod - it was so fresh and tender. I loved it. I took a chance, as I was not sure how much I loved cod. It was cooked in a light sauce with tomatoes and zucchini, just yummy. Too full for dessert after eating half the ocean. My husband ate the ribeye and said it was fantastic. Bottles of wine, delicious seafood, reasonable prices and great ambiance make this a joint that can't be missed.
2010-12-06,4,What great steakhouse- the tbone is awesome here and all the a la carte sides are good size. You won't leave hungry. The shrimp cocktail is great too with giant shrimp. The wine list is a little on the light side for a steak house but they have a couple standouts, especially the Italian selections. Overall a nice place without the manhattan prices
2010-08-28,5,My wife and I ate here prior to a RiffTrax show. Wow, what a lead-in. I had a well prepared Porterhouse while my wife had the salmon. I'd love to say that I tried the dessert but we were both too full from the excellent dinner to add anything on top of it. Nice selection of beers also.
2010-08-04,5,Wow. Needless to say, I have never had such a great restaurant week experience! Service, food, everything!Did dinner with the roomies, and definitely happy we chose Dino and Harry's. The waiter was VERY tentative (in a not over bearing way). He over heard me rave about a recent wine I had and loved, and went out of his way to find a similar bottle that wasn't on the menu. Love it. We ordered off the restaurant week menu, and per the suggestion of our server, we ordered everything and split . He wasn't kidding when he said it was a lot of food. The calamari were so yummy. And the trio of empanadas, I could eat those forever. The spinach ones and chicken ones were moist and flavorful. My entree was the petite fillet steak (I had to!) -cooked to perfection. It tasted amazing, and when I asked for medium rare - that's exactly what I got. The inside was a nice shade of pink, but it was not bloody (gross haha). Sat on a bed of sauteed bite sized mushrooms. Yum!Dessert.. oh dessert. We got one of everything (of course) and the creme brule was beyond words. It was the perfect ending to a good meal with good company :)
2010-06-23,5,I've to Lugers, I've been Morton's.  I crossed the river for a steak so bold.  I've been in my mind......  OK the Neil Young reference is most likely lost on anyone under 40. But listen up anyway.  This is the best steak place in the tri-state area.  period.  the end. no more discussion.  I have NEVER had a piece of meat taste so good as it did here.  You can tell me about Sparks, or the Palm, or Dylan's this or BLT that.  It doesn't get any better than here.  I'm done now. Time to flip the album.
2010-06-19,4,Best steak in Hoboken.  Always great service in classic, comfortable environment.  Not the best wine list for a steakhouse though
2010-06-10,3,Ordered a Porter House for 2... Almost as pricey as NY Steakhouses but not nearly as good as Wolfgang's in NYC or Peter Lugers in Brooklyn.. Dessert was surprisingly good.  Service was kind of slow.... good place to go to if you can't make the trip to NYC.. Overall, solid Prime Steakhouse on par with Morton's and Ruth Chris'...
2010-04-30,5,Great steakhouse. Excellent service. They make you feel like family.
2010-03-05,2,The bill for two ribeyes, a bottle of B Side 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley, some drinks, a dessert, and some shellfish came to ~$200. The service was so-so, the steak unbelievably overcooked and tough (medium rare requested), the fancy martini oily/yucky, and the wine awesome. Oh, the tres lecheswas not at the proper temperature. The decor is exactly as it should be.
2009-12-10,5,I really had no complaints. None. As good as a typical old school Italian steakhouse in Hoboken can get. Service was excellent. Steak was cooked perfectly, and the sides were flavorful. Get the side of potatoes with your steak...and the porkbelly and grilled apple appetizer.
2009-11-03,3,Nice little steakhouse in uptown Hoboken. The ambiance is great here, they had live piano music even though it was a less-than-crowded Monday night. I do find it odd that the dinners are very expensive but don't come with a salad or any vegetables though. I don't eat steak much, so maybe that is normal for a steakhouse? Anyway, the food was good and the service excellent. I would reserve this place for a special occasion though, when you don't mind spending over a hundred bucks for a dinner for two... (2 steaks + 2 sides + 1 soup + 1 beer + 1 glass of wine ~= $140)
2009-06-22,3,Last year we ate here for Father's Day it was called Frankie and Johnnie's--this year we ate here and it was Dino and Harry's but the cow remains the same. Turn of the century gentleman's club decor, Lugeresque steaks,  a bacon appetizer as thick as a Chunky bar, attentive but amateurish service. New Jersey dining at Manhattan prices.
2009-06-15,3,After passing Dino & Harry's every day for over two years I finally made it there last night with a few friends.  We shared the tuna tartare, porterhouse for two, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.  While the food wasn't mind-blowing, it was very solid steakhouse fare.  The porterhouse was cooked exactly as ordered-- medium rare, the mashed potatoes were creamy.  They also pour some nice wines.  I particularly enjoyed the house cab... and by particularly I mean I was totally overserved and didn't make it to work today.  Overall, Dino & Harry's was a good experience and I look forward to returning.
2009-04-11,4,A first-rate neighborhood steakhouse.  They do a good job with what must be regarded as the chief mission of any steakhouse: porterhouse for two or three.  I'm more favorably inclined to them of late not so much because of any change there but due to a string of disappointing experiences at Manhattan steakhouses which once seemed to be a rank above.
2008-11-12,3,Frankie and Johnnie's is now called Dino and Harry's.  It doesn't measure up to some of the better steak places in the city, however it's a stone's throw from my apartment and they do serve up a decent porterhouse.  Plus they seem to tolerate belligerence and other manly shenanigans.
2006-10-27,3,Had a great meal on a quiet Monday night here. Great service, old school feel, reasonable prices for an upscale steak house. Tasty steak. The martinis were crisp, clean and cold.  Somehow, I don't think that asking for the foo foo martini in this place would be a good idea, which is allright with me. Old school is the operative word here.
2006-09-05,4,The steak here was as good as about any steak house.  I shared the 72oz Porterhouse for three, and it was excellent.  The sides were good, but they didn't offer hash browns - which is my favorite.  For dessert I had the key lime pie.  I was served in a tiny martini glass with no whipped cream.  I felt it was a bit too tart, but maybe that was only because it was sans whipped cream. The atmosphere feels more like your neighborhood grill than a steak house.  If you have the choice, I think you'll do much better having your steak in the city.  If you do want to travel here from Manhattan, take the #126 bus from the port authority.  This will drop you off in front of the restaurant in about ten minutes.
