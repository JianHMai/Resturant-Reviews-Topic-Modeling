2021-10-29,5,Love this place. Very cute takeaway spot. The salad I had was sooo good and filling. Better than sweet green. I like how it comes tossed. The breakfast burrito is HUGE and so delicious. Add the chorizo! The donuts are tasty, specifically marscapone, but they are COLD. Got them first thing in the morning and they were weirdly cold like they'd been defrosted? Still tasted good and fresh-ish. Can't wait to try more salads
2021-10-22,5,The nicest people in the world work here + excellent food. I order here the time; Manny their delivery guy is rocks!
2021-10-14,5,Fresh and clean, great interesting salads. Wonderful bone broth and lattes. Service was great, and portions were ample!
2021-09-25,5,My go to salad place..Salad is delicious and very filling. Customer service is amazing made a mistake on my online order and called they fixed it immediately. Eat here trust me!
2021-09-22,5,I was wrong about this place. Very wrong. I have ordered here a couple times since my first time and have been impressed. As simple as it sounds my favorite is the chicken caesar wrap. It isn't overly dressed so you get the different textures that makes the sandwich pop. They also have really good salads. The menu is smaller but the stuff they do is quailty. The delivery also came pretty quickly which is always what you want when hungry. I do recommend this spot if you want healthier options without sacrificing quality and flavor. Check it out!
2021-08-17,5,Worth every penny. It's a little pricy for a salad but I honestly think it's worth it. It's a great size salad and the ingredients are super fresh. Quick delivery with door dash/Grubhub. Order was made correctly with a create your own salad. I really like how they allow you to pick how much dressing you want instead of just giving a standard size cup, it really makes a difference. Cant wait to get another salad from here!
2021-08-02,4,What a lovely little spot! Came here on a Monday afternoon to get some work done after work. Unfortunately I discovered this gem right before my internship ends so I won't have gotten the most utility. FOODWas craving lemonade, got the ginger turmeric lemonade, $3.50. Can't find these prices anymore these days! It was just ok.For drinks, I'd only seen coffees in pictures of the menu but I was pleasantly surprised to see some cold teas/juices. They were very welcoming when I asked to sample a couple.They also have some amazing looking donuts and salads that I'd love to try, all pretty well priced.MOODSuch a cute hipster interior! Gives me LA vibes. Solid wifi with a couple outlets. Plenty of seating when I went on a weekday evening - a variety of booths, high tables, and benches. They're also the coffee shop that's open the latest in the area. At first I sat in a spot facing the back kitchen counter where I felt a huge draft, but was able to move to a warmer table.'TUDEGreat friendly staff, no complaints.
2021-07-25,5,Their turmeric drink is soooo refreshing. Their salads are fresh and the service is super quick. My go-to salad place in Hoboken.
2021-07-20,5,The breakfast burrito is incredible! House made chorizo and a hearty size overall. They always give a red and green salsa as well. The red is spicy and tasty while the green salsa is off the hook. Mild, creamy texture, notes of cilantro and so good I could eat it stand alone. The whole menu is good to having tried everything at least once.
2021-07-16,5,This has become my go to lunch place during the last year. We order from Alfalfa almost once a week and it is fast and consistently great. The people there are also nice which is a bonus. One time, they forgot to include my donut (yes, I have a donut with my salad) and I called to let them know, so they gave me three donuts when I went back to pick it up. C'mon, now that's customer service.
2021-07-11,3,First, it's has a display feel to it, not a place you would sit down and eat. The breakfast chorizo burrito was a bit dry and lacked moistness. They did have a great display of donuts. Seasonal, jelly filled, mascarpone filled, amber maple, Oreo, vanilla lavender fairy bread, and chocolate sprinkles. I would recommend giving it a try, the ginger turmeric tasted like just simple lemonade.
2021-06-17,5,They have the best salad in town. My go to joint for salad. I wish they had one on river road too up on port imperial!
2021-06-02,5,Alfalfa is my go-to when I need a healthy, quick, filling meal. Their salads are all delicious - I love the Greek, Buffalo cauliflower and the one with the strawberries and dates. The breakfast burrito is amazing too and the chai latte. Have always enjoyed the food I got here, so highly highly recommend.
2021-05-24,3,Excellent service!! Unfortunately the food is not special. It's not bad and it tastes fresh, but I feel like it's missing something in the flavor department. They give generous portions but it's also priced to match; wish they had half-portions for half the price. Also most disappointingly they do not have alfalfa sprouts!! For a salad place named Alfalfa this feels like a no-brainer
2021-05-21,2,Got the chorizo breakfest burrito yesterday morning, which I've had before. Good portions and tasty. Always had been tasty.However, today it made my extremely ill, where  I'm still feeling awful 12+ hours later and have spent a large number of those hours in the bathroom. Honestly a bummer, as not sure that I can go back after this experience.
2021-05-18,5,Alfalfa hands down has the best salads in Hoboken. They are always delicious and full of fresh ingredients -no skimping! I love that you can turn any of the salads into a wrap if you want. Their crimson Palmer - so tasty and refreshing.  Also. They. Have. Donuts.
2021-05-01,4,This place is awesome for lunch salads and breakfast burritos! I love the dear darla and cardini salads. I've tried a few others I'm not as huge of a fan of, but always have a great experience! The staff is super friendly and the ambiance inside is great.
2021-04-24,5,The donuts are awesome. Have been stopping in to grab one every time I pass by the restaurant.
2021-04-23,5,To say I love this place is an understatement. I've never had anything I was disappointed by, but will say I struggle to change my order from my usual West Coast salad... I recently moved out of Hoboken, but make it a point to order from Alfalfa at least once every time I'm back. The salads have the perfect mix of ingredients - without any overpowering the other (i.e.: too much lettuce, not enough extras). The fact that you can customize how much dressing you want & if you want it mixed/on the side is a huge bonus, as well.If you're in a "treat yo'self" mood, do not pass up on getting a donut. They're so fresh & not "too" sweet. And hey...if you wake up early and it's not time for a salad yet - their breakfast burritos are also a 10/10.
2021-04-15,3,Ordered the 12oz latte with almond milk for delivery along with a chocolate sprinkle donut, amber maple crunch donut, and a gold sea salt chocolate donut.Delivery arrived on time. One donut was upside down at the bottom of the bag and I had to put all of the Cinnamon Toast Crunch back on top. It was a sticky mess. The other two were wrapped in paper and chocolate got stuck to it. I'd rather have had them in a little box vs wrapped in paper they stuck to in a bag. We still ate them regardless.The lattes I thought were going to be hot since I didn't order iced lattes. But they were good anyway.The best donut was the amber maple crunch! Lots of maple flavor and the Cinnamon Toast Crunch is a fun crunch on top.The chocolate sprinkle donut didn't have much flavor. Wouldn't waste the calories on it again.The new gold sea salt donut had good chocolate on top a bland donut. It's pretty but I wouldn't order it again either.Next time we would get some of the food menu items to try and a hot latte lol. I appreciate that they gave almond milk. I also don't think I'd do delivery again. My total was $21 and that seems a bit ridiculous for just coffee and donuts in Hoboken.
2021-04-03,5,I've lived in Hoboken for a while but have never gotten around to coming here until today! My boyfriend wanted to try their specialty donuts, so we ordered 3 to share: the Oreo, the Maple crunch, and the Lavender. The donuts were so delicious! I also got an iced chai latte and it was very good. We sat outside (indoor seating seems to be closed right now) which was great but the inside is very cute too. I will definitely be returning!
2021-03-30,5,I don't know why a reasonably priced and fulling salad is hard to find in a foodie area.. until Alfalfa came along. I cannot get enough of their salads.  These are not the type of salads that make you feel like you just ate a fast food meal.  The salads are filled with fresh ingredients! I always order the Laguna with chicken or the Peruvian Chicken salad.  I literally ordered the salads three times in a week for lunch one week because you cannot find a quality salad anywhere else.   The portions are a good size and you have the option of having your dressing mixed in and can pick how much dressing you want.  The amount of dressing they put on it is always perfect.  Pre Covid Ive definitely broken my diet with the donuts they sell as well. If you're trying to diet do not look at the donuts when you go in... you will get one.  During covid this place is not trying to have you breathe all in their store. You order your food ahead of time and they sit it all bagged and ready on a shelf in alphabetical order.  You cannot get passed the entry way.  The staff still greets you in a friendly manner when you walk in to pick your food up even though you have no reason to interact with them. Love the salads, love the covid process! Its the perfect place to get a quick and decent salad for lunch.
2021-03-26,5,This has been a new favorite of mine. My Go-To order is typically either the Autumn Buffalo Cauliflower Wrap or the Far East Salad! But if you're going for breakfast, both of their breakfast burritos are incredible options and come with yummy salsas on the side. Another recommendation I would be is to get their iced matcha latte with oat milk. So glad to have this delicious, trendy little spot in Hoboken!
2021-03-07,5,What's not to love about Alfalfa? It's been my go-to delivery spot during COVID. The salads are so fresh and you can't build/add/customize basically anything. My order is always the Greek Salad with chicken. The portion sizes are large enough you'll have lunch and dinner. Ingredients always taste fresh! No need to worry about a soggy salad showing up at your door. My order always arrive a few minutes a head of schedule. I've never had an issue with delivery here. Oh, and the donuts! We ordered the donuts for a fall housewarming party and everyone raved over them. The Oreo donut is incredible. I typically don't order a donut with my salad, but I might have to start.
2021-01-23,5,Choose from 4 different organic greens for the base & build your own or choose from the menu. No skimping on the good stuff, this alone sets Alfalfa a part from the competition.  Call ahead, up town, so worth it!
2020-12-15,4,The first time I order pickup via Toast (online) salad was ready for pickup before the time I picked which was great. The woman at the front was very friendly and greeted me upon entering. I ordered the Laguna Salad with Peruvian chicken thighs and light dressing as I don't like my salad drenched in dressing. It was pretty good! Nice little kick from the red onions and Peruvian spiced chicken. The portion was great, double the size than most places! I have lunch for the next day! I think next time I'll order medium dressing mixed in as the light was a bit too light for me but now I'm aware.
2020-12-07,5,Amazing place the ownership is truly amazing one of a kind,the best breakfast ever ,salad amazing,dear dara wrap was the best ever I will always love the food and customer service superb at alfalfa
2020-10-19,5,This place is the the best salads are dreams very fresh great service ownership and workers have been such great customer service and I would recommend them all day long
2020-10-09,5,Hands down the best salads! Highly recommend the west coast with grilled chicken. You cannot go wrong with anything on this menu!
2020-10-01,4,The food is delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced. I love it; this is my 4th time ordering from this place. However, I ordered an hour and 15 minutes ago and the order did not arrive even though I live 10 minutes away from the store. I called them to see what's up with my order and I learn that the food did not leave the store yet. I hope they get organized with their deliveries.
2020-08-22,5,This place is my go-to. Amazing iced matcha latte, I can't go anywhere else cause no place makes it the same. I love the harvest bowl, far east and autumn buffalo salads. Their crimson Palmer is the perfect pick me up drink now that it's summer. Alfalfa is a pick above the rest when it comes to finding quality food in Hoboken
2020-08-22,1,Was my first time ordering from here. Pick up time was great although I asked for dressing on the side and got none. The quality of the mixed lettuce (romaine, butter and kale) were limp and appeared old- did not taste good for a place that churns out salad after salad. The apples in the salad were mushy and tasted like lemon. Don't know what the hype is about this place.. not impressed.
2020-08-14,5,Absolutely delicious! We've picked up from here 2 nights in a row. The food was as fresh as can be and ready right on time. Highly recommend!
2020-08-04,5,Amazing new restaurant in hoboken that has the best salads in town and you must try their amazing doughnuts  everything is fresh and they do deliver and accept  credit cards. Highly recommend this healthy spot in town. Parking is available for cars and also for bicycles.
2020-07-26,5,Everything I had was delicious. Donuts were great. Favorite was the lavender vanilla. Breakfast burrito was great. And Laguna salad was fresh. Great guys too.
2020-07-21,5,Salads, donuts, and coffee all done well. Not sure what else anyone needs in life. They're always super friendly, too- and the space is beautifully designed.
2020-07-15,5,Fresh well portioned salad and huge wraps! I'm so glad I found this place now that I'm WFH! I can't wait to try more items on the menu.
2020-07-08,5,Oh. my. Goodness! I'm enjoying this salad so much right now I couldn't even wait to finish it to write this review. DELICIOUS! Fresh. Healthy. And a huge portion size for a reasonable price. This is my first time eating here and definitely will be eating here again and often from now on! I got the Far East salad by the way. With a size medium honey soy ginger dressing on the side. And added avocado. Next time I'll get a large dressing since the salad is enormous and you can use the extra dressing on other things (it's amazing). And no avocado. Don't need it.
2020-06-24,5,I love their salads, I could eat the West Coast salad every day. Delivery is so quick and the people working are always very nice. The best!
2020-06-22,3,Decent salads but who to wait 20 minutes past your preassignes  pickup time??  Terrible.
2020-06-20,5,During a hard day, we will order from here and 100% recommend to all our friends. We love this place and were so happy when they reopened post covid. They have great donuts and I love the west coast salad. If you want a healthy spot, great food, and awesome customer service, this is the place to be.
2020-06-16,5,So yummy and healthy. I love the Greek salad with quinoa and roasted chicken. I prefer to leave my dressing on the side and I add it as I go. Highly recommended!!
2020-06-02,2,I was very disappointed that the delivery person was not wearing a mask as it makes me doubt their safety and practices. I unfortunately didn't get to try the food for that reason. Please have your delivery folks wear a mask.
2020-05-31,4,Great salad spot in uptown Hoboken. The ingredients are super fresh and the salads are very refreshing. They have a lot of pre-made salads, which are super good. I've had both Laguna and Wild Harvest salads and both were really good.
2020-05-29,5,My coworker & other locals raved about this place so I placed a delivery order today and WOW. I'm hooked. The quality and quantity is great for the price. I'm almost full and I haven't even dented the salad. I appreciate how fresh this meal is and look forward to ordering much more often. Huge thank you to those working!! This is the salad of my dreams. I was told the wraps are insane too, can't wait to try.
2020-05-28,5,Literally my new favorite spot. Never disappoints in person or with delivery. Worth every penny. The best breakfast and donuts in town! And then the salads... if I could order this place all day for every meal, I would. Pick up a Dirty Lemon when you're there! It'll change your life.
2020-05-26,2,normally love this place, but my order showed up today without a lid on it, and almost half the salad was in the bag and not in the bowl. salad's great, just half of it was inedible.
2020-04-30,5,I work at the hospital in Hoboken and have heard great things about alfalfa from my coworkers but unfortunately never got to make it here before they shut down due to the covid lockdown. Was so excited to hear they were reopened so I stopped by tonight for the first time and I am hooked!! Alfalfa is definitely now one of my go to spots in town
2020-04-29,5,I live in Edgewater and I decided to use a food delivery service to get lunch today. To my surprise, alfalfa, located in Hoboken, was available. Yesss!!!! I ordered the Dear Darla wrap and it was absolutely delicious. The ingredients were super fresh and it tasted amazing Highly recommend.
2020-03-21,5,Alfalfa is always fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly too and they keep the place nice and clean.
2020-03-21,5,So good! They delivered quick and the Darla wrap was sooo crispy and flavorful!They also serve homemade doughnuts which are fresh and yummy!
2020-03-03,3,Not bad. Not amazing. Kind of a sparse cold decor. Which they sort of kept after the last owner. But have no idea why. It's essentially an old luncheonette, but you feel none of the warmth or personality of one. There are many cozier places in Hoboken.
2020-02-13,5,*disclaimer this review is only for delivery, I have yet to go in person and order*Everything I have eaten from here is fresh, delicious, and exactly as requested. The container is always stuffed and requests for dressing are provided exactly as needed. Highly recommend, especially if you work in Hoboken.
2020-02-11,5,WE LOVE ALFALFA!!! First time ordering from Alfalfa...this was for a team meeting and hands down, all 10 colleagues said this was by far, the best salad they've had from any other salad spot in Hoboken!  The greens were super fresh, the dressings were phenomenal and paired just perfectly with the salads.  Everything about the salad combos were perfect!  We ordered the Peruvian, Autumn, O.G. Cardini, Flower Girl and a few others and they were all tasty, mixed just right and super fresh!  The donuts are also out of this world!  They are not super sweet, very flavorful and light/airy.  After such amazing salads, the donuts were truly a welcome treat at the end of the day.  We are definitely looking forward to ordering again and catering for our bigger meetings!  Thanks Andrew to you and your team for the wonderful and prompt service!  We ordered online and requested a specific time, our order was here exactly as we requested.  Truly happy with every aspect of this order!
2020-01-30,5,Tremendous cafe! The salads and donuts are always fresh and delicious. Such a trendy spot to read a book, meet a friend or just hang out. One of the best new spots in Hoboken.
2020-01-27,5,I literally have eaten the autumn buffalo cauliflower  salad every day for a week, and am still loving it. It is so fresh  and flavorful. I also am going to be very honest and say that I hate salads in general. HATE. But this one salad has converted me to actually being someone who craves and enjoys them. It is so filling, and has so many yummy things in it that I would have never imagined putting together, but that compliment each other so well.  I feel the best part of the salad is how generous they are with all the ingredients. Brussel sprouts, buffalo cauliflower, sweet potato, sunflower seeds, wild rice, goat cheese (that I omit), Alfalfa salad mix, Green Goddess dressing ( I might be remembering the name wrong but it is a ranch base) Sincerely, as a vegetarian, who is always hungry and bored of variety, thank you so much for creating something so amazing! Please don't make it seasonal. I need this in my life.
2020-01-26,5,Hands down, the best salads in Hoboken. Located on Washington ave. This place is clean and fast. The Service is great. At lunchtime the place is always jamming, and you'll see a lot of Uber eats coming in and out to grab their delicious salads for delivery.
2020-01-25,5,I love this place! I've only been once, but the food and drinks were great... the service was great. It's super clean and cute inside. I sat facing the window because I was by myself and wanted some sunlight. I ordered the wild harvest bowl and I enjoyed it so much. Big portion that filled me up! (Which you never know when you order a salad)I purchased an iced matcha latte and it turned out they ran out of matcha after I paid for it! So they gave me the little amount that was left along with a new drink. I chose the ginger lemonade and it was delicious and refreshing. Can't wait to go back!
2020-01-17,5,This place is great for a healthy and delicious meal. I love the Greek salad and the soups are tasty as well. Definitely recommend for lunch or a light dinner.
2020-01-11,1,If you're coming for the donuts, you're better off going to Dunkin' Donuts. I was a huge fan of Schnackenbergs and ate there almost weekly. Today I was craving a donut, so I figured I'd give Alfalfa a try. I got a chocolate frosted with sprinkles that cost me $3.20 (Schnackenbergs was $1.60 by comparison). I'm fine paying over $3 for a donut, and do so all the time at places in the city, but for donuts that are larger in size or for a speciality flavor. Not only was this donut small, but it was pretty flavorless and the frosting tasted like they just coated it with Hershey's syrup. Definitely wouldn't recommend and wouldn't come back here again.
2020-01-03,5,If I could give Alfalfa 10 stars, I would. This salad spot is hands down a win every time. Not only are the salads fresh, filling, and delicious, but the owners and staff are some of the most pleasant people in the business. And don't forget to try the incredible donuts as a treat! Having said that, I was not at all surprised to learn that Alfalfa was on Yelp's most popular NJ restaurants in 2019. Eating healthy in 2020 will be an easy thing to do with Alfalfa!
2020-01-03,4,I order from here very, very often and must say, one of the best salads in the North Jersey area! They use really fresh and high quality ingredients, have some awesome dressing options and give you an insane portion for a normal price. I love that you get to pick if you want the dressing on light, medium or heavy and they don't charge extra for heavy. Something people may not know is that the egg wrap is one of the best egg "sandwiches" I've ever had, so tasty, packed with freshly scrambled eggs, potatoes and cheese, served with both the red and tomatillo salsas. It's one of my fav things there.But of course, they can't be perfect, the donuts are more like a heavy bread dough, not a pinch of sugar, like eating bread with frosting. I tried it with some friends and we all had the same thoughts. I'm looking for a classic donut or baked cake donut if doing a healthy twist, or brioche dough like my fav, Salty Donut in Miami. Anyways, everything else is a winner.Lastly, the soups... the soups here are so delicious and fresh. I only wish they had more daily options or they made whatever the best seller is everyday and then a second daily soup. I've tried many and so far, I've liked them all!!
2019-12-29,5,We live 35 minutes away on a good day. One hour ten minutes during traffic. But this is our go-to and we've been there with our 5 kids at least 30 times. We all love it. We even took 17 family members there one time. Highly recommended. The staff are all so nice, the salads are huge and delicious and the place is clean. Our only complaint is that there's not one in nearby hotspot Ridgewood.
2019-12-23,5,Ok- so I came here with HIGH expectations and... I wasn't disappointed. I was always a loyalist and lover of Sweet Green in the city and was excited that people were comparing this place to SG. So since I'm off from work, I decided to give it a try. I got the Laguna salad which is similar to the Avocado Greens salad or I forget the name from SG. I subbed the cheese for charred broccoli and the broccoli was my favorite. I did ask for the lemon herb vinegarrette and it was perfect. Portions are hearty so come hungry. The service was excellent as well. Staff is sweet and make sure you are happy. I chose to eat there and the salad came out soooo fast. I recco if you are looking for a filling delicious salad fix. I will certainly be coming back!
2019-12-14,5,Love love love Alfalfa! I've been getting a salad there practically weekly since they opened, and they are always delicious & healthy! They have some very creative ideas too, like they taught me that dates in a salad are THE BEST. Also the cutest vibes inside. Definitely recommend for salads.
2019-11-21,4,Very cute interior with a lot of seating and wifi. I came here for a quick bite and was drawn to their donuts. There are many flavors to choose from and had decorative frosting designs.
2019-10-18,5,Just moved to Hoboken not to long ago from the city and Alfalfa has replaced my love for Sweet Green!!  The salads and food are not only DELICIOUS, they are creative and healthy.  The portions are massive, I still have trouble finishing my salad in one sitting.  Finally got a chance to try their new buffalo cauliflower bowl and it does not disappoint   Make sure to also check out the variety of drinks, the ginger lemonade hits that spot without the sugar rush and nasty after taste.Only thing missing is a gluten free baked good, but I hear the donuts do not disappoint
2019-10-09,5,Super cute little cozy spot for a scrumptious yummy salad ! I love the Alfalfa website because I can create my own salad and I had it waiting for me on the counter in a crisp white tote bag ! Salad was super fresh and the ingredients were killer good ! I snuck a peek , while more like gawking and drooling like Homer Simpson , at these gorgeous decadent donuts ! Can't wait to try one ! Totally stoping in mañana to get another salad :) and a donut ..d'oh !
2019-10-08,5,Everything is just great and fresh.  Salad is a salad add toppings choose your dressing and enjoy .  There coffee and lattes are my fave not to mention there outstanding donuts     I'm obsessed with alfalfa the team and over all atmosphere. Good satisfying heathy food
2019-10-03,5,Love this spot! The Laguna salad is my favorite, but my other friends have said the Italian salad is good too! I tried their matcha green tea latte and the vegan chocolate cupcake too at the Hoboken girl event they just had and they were really good too! Can't wait to keep coming here again
2019-09-29,3,I love your salads but, today was the 2nd time there has been a bug in my food. I'm disappointed because this was my go-to salad place. I'm only writing this review so you can take the proper measures to make sure this doesn't continue to happen.
2019-09-26,5,Absolutely amazing! As someone who loves salads, I can honestly say this place had the best salad I have ever tasted. Delicious and filling. I was raving about the meal for days. Can't wait to go back.
2019-08-24,5,#Alfalfa- making appearances at the farmer's market, to pop-up, and now to having their own cozy space in Hoboken. Lots of natural light and seating (also free WiFI). Whenever I am craving a fresh hearty salad -Alfalfa is the place I run to. I know people mention it being pricey (it kind of is- paid $30 for two salads) but you are getting fresh ingredients and a huge portion size. The O.G. CARDINI is my fav: Alfalfa mix, Freebird roasted chicken, grape tomatoes, homemade croutons, parmigiano-padano, sliced almonds, Caesar *dairy free dressing. I added avocado but i do think they held back on how much they added. My sister loved the Laguna Salad. They offer coffee, wraps, and I saw the doughnut display (they all look delicious)!*I agree with another Yelper that stated that it would be nice to see the ingredients from the display or at least it being made in front but the setup has the kitchen in the back. The service is fast and the staff is always friendly. Will continue supporting!*Tried the peanut butter doughnut - DELICIOUS!
2019-08-22,5,Stopped in for lunch and was blown away. High quality salad ingredients and great menu variety, including lots of extra goodies. Try an espresso with a gourmet doughnut! The Vybes strawberry lavender CBD drink was stellar as well. Great place for a meal with coworkers, friends or alone!
2019-08-06,4,I went into Alfalfa to see what was so special about the salad pop-up, and honestly, I was not blown away.  Yes, the ingredients were fresh; the salad was huge and packed with my selected toppings; service came with a smile; and the food was brought out almost immediately.  However, I was not overly impressed by the salad green options (no arugula or spinach) or the toppings (no mushrooms, extra fee for fancy peppers vs bell ones).  I just felt like they could really step up their game with additional options.  Also, when I build my own salad, I like to select my ingredients from a display case in front of me, rather than off a boring menu.  Here, you must compose your order blindly, while they construct the salad in the back kitchen, leaving you unsure of what your first order will look like.  Overall, great food and service, but needs more variety.
2019-08-05,4,Super cool new salad place.  They did a great job remodeling the diner that was there before it.  They've also paid homage to the former tenants by maintaining a selection of super indulgent donuts and small treats.Kind of an odd pairing, but the salads are huge, healthy but tasty, and not exorbitantly expensive which is good.  I haven't tried their donuts, but if I were in the mood for a really sinful sweet treat, I'd try theirs.  They have free WiFi, plenty of space to sit and work, eat, and they have water and lemon water available for everyone at no charge with tin cups for sustainability purposes.Definitely worth swinging by for one of their  salads if you're in the mood for a healthy, hearty meal.
2019-07-29,3,Having seen positive reviews, I gave Alfalfa a try. I ordered the Seasonal Bowl, as the ingredients looked great, but was bummed at the "Alfalfa Mix" of salad provided. Mine contained mostly crunchy Romaine lettuce pieces -- missing the great taste an arugula, kale or spinach could provide. I will say that the spicy dressing was fantastic, though.
2019-07-07,5,Alfalfa is amazing. Ordered the West Coast salad and it was soooo good. Fruity and goat cheese. Then we had the donuts and it was unbelievable. We had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and the Huckleberry. YUM!! Also- owner is super friendly. Great vibes great food great price in a great spot on Washington. GO!!
2019-06-11,4,I came into the establishment early and asked to sit down now and order later as I planned to work on some paperwork. The atmosphere of the restaurant is definitely something I have long seeked for in Hoboken and it is imperative that the managers of this place only promote and preserve this atmosphere that I think is the unique factor. The lighting is very bright and the seating is comfortable with an airy view of the entire restaurant from almost any seating position. The tables are made of wood but are relatively flimsy as they were sticky to touch and easy to rotate as if it was not attached to the leg properly. I feel a quick upgrade in the tables is definitely a power move. The menu itself is very easy to read and the options are there. They should add a section where add-ons can be available such as grilled chicken or of the sort. I ordered the Dear Darla and it was definitely a new salad I had not tried elsewhere in terms of the taste and the dressing used. Give this place a try!
2019-06-09,5,My husband, brothers-in-law, and I have taken out and dined in Alfalfa numerous times now and have had exceptional service every time. Not only is the interior design modern and cozy, but the food is very fresh and separates itself from the other healthy "fast-food" places in town. The manager and staff are also highly attentive to their clientele and remember their regulars in no time! Alfalfa is a great place to stay and chat with friends or do some work as well as take out for a quick and refreshing bite!
2019-06-09,5,Their salads are so good. Tasty and nutritious. I think they are better and better for you than Honeygrow. Small steel cups are used for table water and paper straws shows they are eco-friendly. I love that they kept the schnackenbergs home made donuts. Nice atmosphere. I highly recommend them.
2019-06-09,5,Alfalfa was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had in a while. The place itself is very clean and modern, staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. The Seasonal Salad was so fresh and flavorful. I'm a larger person who eats a lot and I can say it might be the first time in my life that I've taken a salad home (because it was large enough and good enough to eat again). Will be recommending to anyone in Hoboken.
2019-06-06,5,I was so pleasantly surprised with this place. The salad combinations are creative and go do well together. I got the salad with the tofu and broccoli - Far East. It was finely chopped and soooo good. The dressing is also spot on. I hope they stay in town.
2019-06-04,5,Laguna is quite possibly the most delicious salad I've ever had! I requested the dressing 'light' (so nice that they ask if you want light, medium or heavy) and it is still very tasty! Some reviews commented that it is pricy, but it is a huge portion, very fresh and high quality, so in my opinion it's priced fairly. Service was prompt and friendly, and the space is bright, nicely-decorated, and welcoming. The donuts are also sooo delicious, just one more reason to visit often!
2019-05-20,5,Have ordered take-out several times from here and love the salads every time. Order is always ready on time and have never had an issue even when I swap toppings from their salads. Recommend it!!!
2019-05-20,5,I love this place!  Better than any take-out salad place I've been to in NYC or Jersey.  I am obsessed with the Laguna salad (I add chicken) and also love it in a wrap.  The ingredients are so fresh and portion sizes are excellent.  It's so nice to have a solid lunch place like this in North Hoboken.  Can't wait to try breakfast options and donuts!
2019-05-15,5,Customer Service here is second to none. (Aside from loving their Dear Darla salad and ordering it weekly). I ordered a salad from here via ubereats and after an hour of the order not being picked up called the restaurant. There was an issue with the driver and Alec immediately offered to DRIVE the order right over to me. After waiting a bit longer not only did Alec insist on driving the order over to me, he threw in a donut and a $15 gift card so my next salad was on them. This was an ubereats driver mix up and not their fault, but Alec took full ownership and I couldn't be more impressed. THANK YOU ALEC!!!
2019-05-15,5,I am so glad that I stopped in to try this place out. I had been avoiding this place because I thought that the salads actually included alfalfa in them. For you alfalfa haters, the salads don't actually include alfalfa!  This is my new weekly go-to place for a healthy and delicious lunch. Great and friendly staff, too.
2019-05-12,5,Salads are great here, they are definitely 2 portion salads and if you are vegan- only 10/12$ which is crazy! The staff is still pretty untrained and some employees seem a bit lost but everyone is very nice and happy to help. The place is pretty echo-y so it might be hard to concentrate on work depending on your work style- if you are coming here for work. A little sterile feeling. Donuts look good and they are a cute tradition carried over from the previous Schnackenbergs. Haven't tried them so cant say much about how glutinous they are. Second time here for salad.
2019-05-11,5,Excellent service! They have great salads when you wana be healthy, and amazing doughnuts (and pastries) when you need something for your sweet tooth. Highly recommend
2019-05-07,5,Amazing!!!!! I've had Alfalfa twice now and I'm so obsessed with this place.  My go to is the Laguna (can't go wrong) but I definitely want to try out a few more. These salads will fill you up & make you feel great after. I'm so tired of places giving a tiny amount of salad- Alfalfa is definitely not that with their huge portions. Try this place, you won't regret it!!
2019-05-06,5,I only went there once but I will definitely go there again many more times. I shared with my boyfriend the lavender donut and the huckleberry, they are to die for. Huckleberry is my favorite one. That donut is so fluffy, nothing to compare with the big chains donuts. I also had the chorizo buritos for breakfast and it was all perfect. Don't forget to try it with the green sauce. I can't wait to try their salad.
2019-05-03,5,This is probably my new favorite spot in Hoboken. The food is super fresh and incredibly tasty. I had the bone broth, and Laguna salad. The broth was nice and hot and the salad was a very large portion. Not to mention that the service is top notch. I plan to be a loyal return customer. You can definitely tell that these owners really care about the integrity and reputation of their restaurant. When I encountered a horrible Uber Eats delivery experience, they were quick to step in and fix the issue. Bravo to the team at Alfalfa for being a real cut about the rest!
2019-04-27,5,Great Fresh Salads And Great Customer Service!! My Go To Lunch Spot! A Must! Lunch In Hoboken
2019-04-19,5,I don't usually write reviews, but my experience here had me running for my phone the second I finished. This place is amazing. The cold brew was the best I've had in New York, the salads were fresh and huge, and those donuts were amazing. The overall vibe is great, the service was even better, and overall this is a great addition to the neighborhood. Excited to come back!!
2019-04-17,5,Great addition to Hoboken.  Fresh, trendy, exciting, different... welcome..
2019-04-09,5,Excellent salads,service and cleanliness.  Love that you have the option to create your own, lime cilantro dressing is delicious. Much needed uptown, lots of luck
2019-04-05,5,Best salad place in Hoboken. Only been open for 3 weeks and already my go-to place. Owners are very nice and only put the best ingredients in their food!Vegan cupcakes are a must.  Love the Far East salad!
2019-04-01,4,These salads are amazing! So fresh with high quality ingredients. It would be great if they could have a few additional options for food but overall absolutely fantastic. The ambiance and seating area is great and definitely a place where you could eat in and not just take out
2019-03-28,3,Filled donut without filling. Schnak donuts were really great and I wish these guys didn't try to reinvent the wheel and just had the same delicious kinds.
2019-03-27,5,Great salads and even better portion sizes! Turn around time is very efficient and I love that I can keep half for lunch tomorrow. This time around I ordered the West-coast salad but had it with their honey soy dressing swapped in.So so good!
2019-03-27,5,Got the seasonable bowl, maple latte and maple donut. All were to die for!!!! I will be coming back to Alfalfa! Highlight recommend for a great lunch or dinner spot!!
2019-03-27,5,I'm obsessed! Their "dear darla" salad is so delicious and fresh, I enjoy it every time and it never disappoints. The ingredients are so fresh and the dressing so delicious. So happy to have found a lovely salad spot uptown. The space itself is very vibey and relaxing , customer service is also great! Highly recommend
2019-03-27,5,Awesome salads that are super fresh! The people who run it are enthusiastic, friendly and excited about their business. Happy to have a solid salad spot uptown - My go to place!!
2019-03-25,3,Forget the salads, come here for the chill vibes and doughnuts! The boyfriend and I stopped by on 3/10/19 for lunch and we got the OG Cardini and Far East. The salads were not impressive, however, I would love to spend an afternoon working here.
2019-03-23,5,Have been here a few times since it opened. Highly recommend, salads are great and employees are very nice/respectful. Can be a tad pricey for a salad but seems to be the expectation these days for quality ones similar to Sweetgreen
2019-03-23,5,Such a cute, new salad spot! The service was wonderful and the Italian salad was delicious, I highly recommend!
2019-03-22,5,So glad I discovered this place!  They have amazing, fresh salads and equally amazing doughnuts.  Have a healthy salad, and treat yourself with a doughnut afterwards--brilliant!  I also love the decor.  It makes me feel I am in Miami or back home in California.
2019-03-21,5,The place is cute. The food is flavorful and fresh. The employees are kind. Hoboken has needed a place like this for a very long time!
2019-03-21,5,This place is seriously great! The food was really delicious and fresh and the atmosphere was  friendly and warm. We had two different salads and they were both so good we couldn't decide which was better, so I have total faith the rest of the menu is great too. It's fresh, healthy, quick food--just what uptown needed! Can't wait to go back!
2019-03-17,5,I never write reviews but this place is great! I was accidentally given the wrong salad when I walked out and these guys went above and beyond.  They came and delivered a new one, let me keep the old one and also gave me my next one for free.  I ended up trying the one I didn't order and it was delicious too, will definitely come back!
2019-03-17,4,I first tried Alfalfa when it was just a pop-up shop. Now that it has its own storefront it's just as good. The place is bright, airy and pretty. It's been empty the three times I've been there, but hopefully that was just a fluke. I've only seen one guy working at the counter (I assume they're keeping a slim staff for now) and he's been very friendly.I've only had the Laguna so far with added roasted chicken. It's delicious, fresh, and hearty. I'd like to try other salads, or maybe make it into a wrap sometime, but I like it so much as-is, that it's going to be hard to stray.My only pings against Alfalfa are that $14 for a takeout salad with chicken feels pretty steep and they are on seamless but it always says they're closed (which I assume will change over time.) Regarding the pricing, I know this is hoboken, but that just feels like a couple of dollars too much. Still delicious, though!
2019-03-13,5,Wow, how excited am I this place opened a block away from me! I finally got to try it tonight and it was awesome! I got the Laguna salad. It was fresh and full of flavor. The dates added a nice surprise! Very clean and the guy at the counter was very pleasant! Will definitely be back again! I would have posted a picture but I ate it to fast!
2019-03-13,5,The grand opening of Alfalfa is a dream come true! Let me start by saying I am a salad snob. It's been hard to locate a good salad spot in town that delivers fresh ingredients without breaking the bank. I met two friends there today for lunch and got the Seasonal Bowl because I saw it had a light hot sauce drizzle (after years of doing that in my own kitchen it was fate). It was incredible. Portions are big for the price! Sometimes salads leave me feeling "if only it had 1-2 more ingredients...". This was absolutely not the case. I just wish I got the CBD drink - something for next time.The place itself is wide open and spacious with lots of natural light. The owners are extremely nice and helpful to first timers. This will for SURE be my go-to spot for lunch, coffee and a little computer work!
2019-03-08,5,Alfalfa's salads are fresh & delicious, the donuts are impeccable and the service cannot be beaten. We had them for a catering event and our office could not have been more thrilled with Alfalfa! Highly recommend for any business considering healthy catering options!
2019-03-08,5,I can't say how happy I am for these young men!!  They have created a wonderful establishment that serves fresh, delicious food in a town that needs more healthy options. The expanded menu with soup and wraps only adds to their appeal. Cannot wait to make this my regular spot!!
2019-03-07,5,Yes! Yes! Yes! Currently, my favorite salad is the West Coast. I'm obsessed with the dates, avocado and goat cheese combo. Though, I equally love The Italian and Dear Darla. You really can't go wrong. Also, I LOVE the texture of the butter lettuce. Why did I not know about this type of lettuce before Alfalfa?!?!? This is my first time trying the springbone broth. It's great!! Definitely an awesome way to round out my salad and keep me feeling full.
2019-03-02,5,So good! i was looking for a big healthy chopped salad and the Laguna salad I got was so satisfying! :-) service was really quick and owners are super friendly
2019-02-27,5,Initially I was very sad to hear that Schnackenberg has closed. Where will I get my sweets cravings and donuts from? So... I found out that Schnackenberg's pastry chef did not leave and stayed on to work here (yay!). Despite being a salad place, they do offer donuts and cookies. Their selection is relatively small but I think they are still in their "soft opening" so they are trying out different things. Minimally if you miss Schnackenberg's fresh donuts, they still offer it! Their salad is solid. Today they have 4 types of salad offering (again soft opening) and they were so nice to explain their offerings to me. It's been a struggle to find a good take out salad place in uptown Hoboken. I am so happy that they offer healthy alternative to my diet.
2019-02-22,5,FINALLY a good healthy/salad option in Hoboken! So excited for this place to officially open. I tried it when it was a pop-up and so excited for it to be a lunchtime staple!
2019-01-14,5,This place is the best. The salads taste great and the ingredients are really fresh and clean. They are super friendly and take pride in the quality of their products.
2019-01-09,5,Alfalfa is a POP-UP in Hoboken Monday - Friday at the vintage luncheonette Schnackenbergs between 12th and 13th on Washington.  It serves up a healthy fare of salad an wraps BUT not your run of the mill formula.These things totally melt in your mouth - these guys totally know what they are doing.   I totally love this food. They construct perfect bites of healthy but perfectly tasty and satisfy perfection. Thanks ALFALFA!!!
2019-01-09,5,One of the best salad's I've ever had, and by far the best salad in Hoboken. Also all of their to-go stuff is compostable. For a new place, they've taken the time and effort to be green, which is vital for all businesses to do.
2019-01-08,5,Amazing, by far the best salad I've had in a long time. Honeygrow and the other local places similar should take notes. The goat cheese in my salad might be the best goat cheese I've ever had. I'll be back - thanks again!
2018-12-28,5,Best salad of any place I've tried!!Fresh ingredients, everything perfectly ripe- even the avocados (which is always what most places mess up.)I got home from work and of course have nothing really to eat- so tried looking through Uber Eats for something around here- which was where I first heard of Alfalfa.  I put my order in- but unfortunately the app wouldn't let it go through because they were approaching closing time.  Since I had invested so much time and effort already in my "make your own salad," I took a chance and called the place directly to see if I could still get the order in.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that yes they would get me in under the wire! The guy of the phone Andrew, and the guy who delivered my salad (very quickly!) Dan, were very nice and accommodating, and I got my delicious salad almost immediately.I will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future!Thanks guys!
2018-12-27,5,Best salad I've had in Hoboken. Ingredients were fresh and the dressing was fantastic (apparently all the dressings are homemade). Haven't found a good salad spot in Hoboken until now. Will definitely order from here going forward.
2018-12-26,5,Honestly - the best salad place in Hoboken. I never personally liked salads, but always made due. That all changed after eating at Alfalfa. The Laguna was honestly the best salad I had, you could tell everything was made fresh. I usually don't care too much about service as long as my food's not late, but for those that do, the owner's were incredibly nice. The entire staff went out of their way to make me feel welcomed and to inform me on what exactly was going into my salad.A must grab for anyone looking for a healthy place to eat in Hoboken. Fresh salad makes a huge difference, and these guys prove it.
2018-12-18,5,Just popped in there. Needed a snack and didn't want a pizza slice and saw this place. Not sure which salad I had (it was the chicken one) but it was bloody brilliant. Very very tasty. Highly recommend this place.
2018-12-18,5,I don't normally write reviews, but this place is AMAZING and the owners are super nice. The Laguna wrap is my new go-to. So happy there's now a healthy salad/wrap place in Uptown Hoboken. Definitely give it a try!
2018-12-14,5,This just became my favorite salad place in Jersey. I got the west coast salad with chicken. Definitely would recommend it. Reminds me a lot of Sweetgreen. Owners were really friendly as well
2018-12-05,5,I'm not a big salad guy but I love to support local small businesses and a few more vegetables in my diet couldn't hurt. The first time I tried Alfalfa was at the farmers market on 14th street and I ate the entire bowl without hesitation. I knew instantly they were on to something. Andrew and the guys mentioned to me they were looking for a more permanent location and I couldn't be happier with where they opened their doors. Right on Washington St. between 11th & 12th, a much needed addition to uptown Hoboken. I have been craving another salad since my first taste over the summer and the second time was just as good. I never thought I would say I eat Kale and I like it, but here I am! Keep tossing those salads guys!
