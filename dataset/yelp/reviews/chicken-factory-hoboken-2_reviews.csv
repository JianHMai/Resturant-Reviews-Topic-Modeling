2021-09-17,5,Stopped to eat in-between classes and it was really good. I got the lunch deal (Wings, Coleslaw, Rice) and I was impressed.
2021-05-24,2,Had a delivery and it was disappointing in many ways. I ordered soy garlic wings and they barely had anything sauce on them. Most tasted like plain wings. I don't know why they got so stingy with the sauce. Second, the breading was off on some pieces. Finally, I ordered through Yelp and it was advertised as having free delivery. (I am located less than a mile away). After the order was places, I get an email from Grubhub that the restaurant added $3.20 for a delivery fee. That felt like such a scam because my decision to order from them was partly based on that and they didn't even call me to discuss why they are charging me this.
2021-05-03,5,This place is great for Korean style fried chicken. I usually get the small drumstick, which has 7 total drumstick. They give you two flavors, spicy/sweet and soy garlic. However, don't come too hungry, Korean style fried chicken takes 15-30 mins to make.
2021-04-24,4,This was my first time ordering from here. I normally go to Fort Lee or the city for Korean food. This is a great place to get your fast food Korean fix! But here's the thing-I would have come here sooner but your name does not indicate that it makes Korean food! I always thought this was a regular fried chicken place like the old Chicken Delight I bet if you changed your name you would get more customers. I had the bulgogi bipimbap which came on a huge bowl. I was impressed with the portion. The veggies and bulgogi were cold though. Probably because it cooled off during delivery. The bulgogi is ground up. I'll come back with my husband to try the wings. Thank you!
2021-04-08,5,By far the most exquisite chicken wings I have ever had. Upon walking into the establishment, I was told of a 20 minute wait. Although I shouldn't be infuriated from this wait, I was due to my insane hunger. However, once the first wing entered my mouth, I told myself that I would've waited 5 hours for these wings. I highly recommend this restaurant, and if you go, ask for Jose to cook your meal.
2021-04-04,5,These are delicious- be warned that if you sit with the box in front of you, you might just end up eating 11 pieces by yourself!  I have no regrets lol
2021-02-27,4,Soy garlic wings amazing and the fries !!! So crispy and good  I  wish they had more flavors for wings but what can we don
2021-02-10,5,Best fried chicken in Hoboken! I've lived here for 2 years and just came across this GEM
2021-01-23,4,Just ordered from here for the first time and the wings were incredible! So crisp and tasty. We got picked radishes as well and they were just okay. Will definitely order those wings again though
2020-12-23,5,I have eaten here multiple times and it's fantastic. They do a terrific job with every order. The consistency is just the best and my go to place when I crave wings.
2020-12-17,4,Love ordering delivery/takeout from here. FOOD: Food smells heavenly and tastes amazing too. We savor every bite. Both sauces are a nice sticky sweetness and if you get your order fast enough it's still plenty crispy. The spicy sauce ranges from 2-3/5 in terms of spiciness depending on the day. Don't get the plain. We ordered all three flavors once and it was so boring in comparison. PORTION: One large is good enough for two people, but we usually more in case we're especially hungry and save the rest for leftovers. Reheating them is still good. PARKING: Obviously the parking situation is awful because it's Hoboken. SUGGESTIONS: Please introduce more flavors! We're getting a little tired of the two sauces and it would be nice to shake things up here and there.
2020-09-10,4,Got there half soy and half spicy chicken.. I liked that it was hot when I picked it up.. wish they upped the spicy flavor a little more. But we definitely enjoyed our meal!
2020-08-11,5,My boyfriend and I agree that this is the best fried chicken we've had .. far better than Bonchon in the City, too. People working there are also very nice. We like the Soy Garlic sauce, and we get the large order of drumsticks .. even for 2 people who eat a lot, it's a lot of food.
2020-08-05,4,I wanted to try this spot for so long, finally ordered a large spicy chicken, it was great. I wish it was littleBut extra spicier than normal. I've tried many korean fried chickens this one is definitely on the medium spicy level when comparing with other spicy korean chicken. Overall, food is great, definitely will order again.
2020-07-27,5,Best Korea fried chicken in town! We were so sad not being able to go to ktown during the SIP so glad we found this place!!
2020-07-16,5,If you're looking for a place to get take out, look no further. Seriously incredible food. There was not a bite of it that wasn't savored. The wings and fried chicken meals are my go to. The value is amazing, you get four sides with the large main dish. How is place was rated anything less than 5 stars is baffling to me.
2020-07-12,5,Ordered delivery from Chicken Factory...When the delivery guy called to say he was here I scrambled to throw my clothes on and had forgot if I tipped so I was also shuffling cash around in my wallet. I opened the door and went down to our front entrance. The food was sitting inside the front door and I looked out to see the delivery guy waving goodbye to me outside. This is the third time we've ordered delivery to our new place and I'm still baffled as to how the delivery guys keep getting in the coded front door without me giving them a code. Anyways, I took the food upstairs and waited for a minute for Olive to let me in since I had forgotten my keys. We tried watching Hot Fuzz but I didn't have it on any of my streaming services. After like 10 minutes of trying to put it on I gave up and put on The IT Crowd and started eating. Mind you the food had probably been sitting in the box for like 30 minutes at this point, but WOW was it HOT and CRISPY. I ate so fast that I could differentiate between the two flavors I had chosen but I didn't care. Perfectly fried, HUGE pieces of chicken (especially the drumsticks) and a decent serving of 8 or 9 wings for $13. I couldn't finish them all. Also, they have these awesome fries that are super crispy and crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I've had other Korean fried chicken before in NYC and Baltimore and this was definitely on par with those. Just as good as Bonchon if not better! I'd definitely recommend this place for delivery if you're in Hoboken and have a hankering for Korean fried chicken. Delivery was FAST and the food was FRESH! Will definitely order again when I'm hankering for Korean fried chicken.
2020-06-29,4,My Go-to place when it comes to fried chicken. It's super legit Korean Fried chicken. It's crispy, juicy, tender, sweet and spicy awesomeness. Their delivery is fast too. (20-30 min in hoboken) I tried their bibimbap for the first time during pandemic and that was good too. I HIGHLY recommend if you like korean fried chicken. They used to give pickled radish with fried chicken but it doesn't seem like they do anymore. You usually eat korean fried chicken with radish so I was surprised and disappointed when they stopped.
2020-06-08,5,Small spot in downtown hoboken. It's nice to have a korean fried chicken option in hoboken so I was excited to try it out when we were in the area. There's a simple menu with friend chicken, bibimbap, etc. I opted for the small fried chicken with half spicy and half soy garlic. My friend and I also got takeout from another spot so I didn't get a whole meal here. It took about 20min for my order to be ready. We then took it to the riverfront to enjoy. The chicken is crispy but not greasy. It's also not too saucey which I liked. I would recommend this spot if you're craving for wings or a fast-food style korean food.
2020-04-07,1,Ordered bulgoki bibimbap last night- the portion was terrible. Literally half spoon of beef. I couldn't taste the beef at all.  The worst was the customer service. When I called the manager adidya insisted that that's the right portion. Beef bulgoki is my favorite Korean food and I have never seen such terrible portion anywhere! It's really sad!
2020-03-08,4,These are the only Korean chicken wings I've ever had so I can't speak to how authentic they are but they're definitely good. Chicken and fries were both crispy, just the way I liked them. Picking up my to go order was very easy. They only gave one packet of blue cheese, I would've asked for ranch but it's okay, the flavors of the wings didn't really need sauce. The soy garlic was my favorite of the 2, but spicy was very good as well. Different than your typical burgers and fries spot!
2020-02-15,5,There aren't really and korean fried chicken joints where I live, so Chicken Factory is the perfect place to get a quick fix for your korean chicken cravings! The soy garlic wings are to cooked marinated very well and fried to perfection (for both bone-in and boneless).
2020-01-06,5,Food is really good here. The chicken is always hot and crispy.  I like to get a mix of both sauces, and their coleslaw is the perfect side dish. Great service.
2020-01-03,5,Love this place!!! My go-to place for Korean fried chicken. Just the right flavor and crisp! Staff is always nice.
2020-01-02,5,I have been coming here for almost a decade and let me just tell you, this place is AMAZINGGG! You can't go wrong with whatever choice of dish you make. Everything is cooked fresh when ordered so the food always tastes great. This has been my boyfriend and I's favorites go to spot every Saturday night after a long day of work, and we are NEVER disappointed. Being that they cook to order its best that you order in advance! Oh and did I mention how they're 100 times better than Bon Chon?! Love this place!
2019-12-02,3,The first time I went here was so good. The chicken was fresh and the way they cooked it was so delicious. But second time, I felt like I was eating leftovers. Or heated chicken. Plus the sauce wasn't that good.
2019-10-27,3,This fast food chicken place is located on the main Street in Hoboken which is Washington Street. Small location with about four tables available for seating. They serve basically only Korean chicken, white rice and salad. I ordered the mild chicken wings only and an order of white rice. The chicken wings were good. They had a nice flavor to them. Some kind of Honey with soy sauce flavor, but it was good. The white rice was awful. It was clumpy with no flavor whatsoever. No salt no pepper no flavor it was awful. I gave them three stars because their chicken is pretty decent so if you're in the mood for chicken wings this might be a good place to hit up.One thing I did notice, there was a young lady tending to the front and taking orders that was very professional and very attentive to all the customers that came in. Kudos for having a very good employee receiving your guess at the front of your place.
2019-10-05,4,The wings here are really good! I definitely would recommend checking this place out if you're in the mood for wings. Hands down, the best wings place in Hoboken. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. However, it is on the pricier side and had a long wait time. Generally, wings are considered a relatively cheap and quick meal, but that wasn't the experience I've had with the food here. If you have the time & money and a craving for wings in Hoboken, this is the place to go.
2019-09-20,5,Love the chicken here, hands down best wings in Hoboken. The owner is kindhearted and accommodating and makes the experience welcoming. 100% recommend the lunch special or wings for dinner. The kimchi is great! Can't wait to order again :)
2019-08-15,5,I drive 35mins one way to eat at Chicken Factory. This is the best KFC in the Tri-State area. Staff is always kind, warm, and welcoming.
2019-08-07,5,OMG I love korean fried chicken and this place is good. I've really only had the wings from here (original, soy garlic, spicy) and all flavors are amazing. Super crunchy and good size wings. Always enjoy takeout from here.
2019-07-24,2,Their food is not consistent. Its half and half. Its half of the time good and other half are bad. Today I had a bad chicken. It was all soggy and oily. The chicken wasn't fresh, it stank. I tasted like they used fermented chicken.
2019-07-16,4,Yummy Korean fried chicken that hits the spot. I am spoiled by the places in Queens, which are definitely a notch up, but if you want to schlep an hour and a half for fried chicken be my guest; shorter wait times for me. Don't forget to add the Path/subway fares to the cost of your meal :)Order in advance even if you plan to eat in since food is cooked to order and takes 20min to prepare. I usually order for pickup and grab a bubble tea from gong cha right next door to go with.Just a tad expensive I feel, but not out of bounds of reason. You do get generous portions of food and leftovers reheat well, so feel free to get the whole chicken or the large drumsticks for a slightly lower per-unit cost.
2019-06-30,5,Excellent service, always enjoy the food there. Lidia is amazing. No complaints whatsoever in the two years I've been going here. Perhaps the best wings in the area by far.
2019-06-09,5,It is amazing korean style fried chicken. I ordered spicy and mild taste of them. It is very crispy and tender inside. Delivery time is little bit long but it is ok. I will make orders when i have any party in my home.
2019-03-11,4,One of the best things about working in NYC was discovering the wonders of Korean fried chicken through BonChon, so I was happy to see a similar place near my current job in Hoboken. While I'm not going to say this place is better than BonChon, it's pretty dang close. The soy garlic sauce tastes almost identical to BonChon's and the wings are similarly crispy. Price for lunch is fair, too - $8 for seven wings plus rice and coleslaw. My one notable complaint is that I really wish the takeout container was microwave safe rather than styrofoam, as my meal was lukewarm by the time I got back to the office. But otherwise, this place completely satisfied my korean fried chicken cravings.
2019-03-06,4,Some of the best Korean fried chicken I have ever tasted. Super quick delivery but just a tad bit pricey.
2019-02-09,3,I don't know if I ever have had korean wings so I had to try. These are known for there crunchy coating which comes from being twice fried. I ordered one of the flavors I forget which one but it had a muted taste to it. I ordered the small and there were enough wings for one person. The wings did not impress me too much I prefer the regular style wings to this. It did have a nice crunch but thats about it. I also tried the bulgoggi which was not good at all. The meat was grossly overcooked and the accompanying sides missed the mark big time. The only saving grace was the cole slaw which was decent but come on its cole slaw. They also charge an arm and a leg for this stuff. It was definitely on the expensive side and not sure it was worth it. I would use it as a last resort but with so many options in town I would go with somewhere else before this.
2019-02-03,1,This place is so bad. They take forever to deliver. Always. The food is decent but the delivery process is just terrible. On top, they don't answer their phone. Don't ever order from them!
2019-01-15,5,I went in today to try their wings and they're so good! I definitely recommend the soy garlic if you're not a spicy eater. The bibimbap was also spot on! Definitely going back!
2019-01-02,4,I ordered delivery from this place a while back. I paid around $22 for a large order of chicken wings, half spicy and half garlic. Both varieties were very, very tasty! These were not puny wings either; our selection included about 6 large drumsticks in there. Plus they delivered our meal fast!I would certainly order from here again.
2018-12-31,5,Favorite Korean fried chicken in Hoboken! Sweet and spicy! Wow! Great flavor, great texture. Very juicy and tasty!
2018-10-29,5,Best Korean fried chicken in Hoboken! Worth the wait. But order ahead so it's hot and ready when you get there. Sweet and spicy sauce is so good, but the plain is tasty too!
2018-10-19,1,Awful experience. Not once, but 3 times. We all love the food here and the chicken is very good, but 3 times back to back it took them close to 2 hours to deliver my food, and it was completely cold and soggy and not edible at all. The third time I ordered through GrubHub to avoid their incompetent delivery system, but learned that it doesn't matter. When I called and told them this food is not edible for me and is too cold and soggy they just offered a meaningless discount for the next order. I asked them to refund me and come take the food since I was going to throw it out anyways, and also asked them to tell the manager to call me. But neither one happened. The driver told me my food was his 7th delivery, which is quite silly since there's no way one driver can deliver 7 deliveries and expect the 7th one to stay warm and edible. It's a shame a place with such good food can't handle decent deliveries and the people who work there when the owner or the manager aren't around are so incompetent. Don't think I'll ever order from them again!
2018-09-26,5,Very clean tasting Korean style fried chicken.If you ask, you can get the plain regular fried version without any sauces, which imho tastes the best.From the taste, seems they use clean oil and fresh tasting chicken.Would definitely go back.
2018-08-07,1,you get very little for your money. we ordered a bucket of 12 pieces of chicken and half of the bucket was very skinny chicken wings. If I wanted mostly chicken wings I would place order for chicken wings. nice family but if they do not start doing the right thing their customers will not return.and there is no reason to charge 11 dollars for a stingy side of onion rings and very tiny light pieces of what appear to be corn bread.
2018-06-26,5,If I could, I'd go to chicken factory every day!!!!! The chicken is sooo flavorful (or as some say,"full of flavor") and is nice and fresssshh. The packaging is totes adorbs and easy to carry! Every time I think of that spicy chicken I taste those jolly flavors
2018-05-21,5,Great place for Korean fried chicken. We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was empty. Chicken was tasty and crunchy. We also got the scallion pancakes with seafood and the portion was good, worth the money.
2018-05-19,3,It deserves 3.5 stars. Not quite a four though which is why I gave it a 3. Ordered wings and drums. Very flavorful. Order was ready when I got there. Nice late night Friday night meal. Will be coming here again.
2018-05-06,3,Ordered Bibimbap Vegetarian. It's a very health choice for dinner. Vegetables are fresh and the kimchi sauce was delicious w rice. The soup w the meal was disappointing tho.
2018-04-26,1,Ordered chicken with delivery.com took over 90min to Jersey city and food was cold. Also, response from restaurant was "We had very busy evening, cannot process refund or discount since owner is not in right now." VERY un-professional.
2018-04-02,4,Super yummy Koren fried chicken spot in Hoboken. The restaurant is very simple as the menu is not expansive, which works fine for me. I ordered the Large wings and drumstick combo and an order of french fries. They offer two sauces for the chicken-- garlic soy & sweet & spicy. Both sauces were delicious. I preferred the garlic soy but my partner loved the sweet and spicy. Chicken was freshly prepared and juicy the way fried chicken should be. Pricing wasn't bad, service was quick, employees were very friendly.I've never done their take-out so I can't speak to that experience.
2018-03-25,4,Good place to get fried chicken with Korean-esque sauces. The food itself is pretty good and I eat here at least once a month. They have a good looking store and their prices are roughly the same as most Hoboken establishments. Their two sauces are decent, although the quality of the sweet and spicy sauce is much higher then that of the soy garlic, and I do wish they'd add more sauce options, with only two things get boring pretty quick. Unfortunately Chicken Factory has a pretty long wait time for food to come out of the kitchen. When you finally get it, the quality can very quite a bit. In each box we find around  the pieces are great looking and taste/feel great. The other pieces can be shriveled or have immensely hard/crunchy portions, some pieces have too little sauce on them and all you taste is the chicken. The size of pieces very as well and some are far too large. As for their non-chicken dishes, their cole slaw is decent but I find their Japchae to be of poor quality. As other people have said, sometimes their rice is burnt. Overall a decent place for a lunch or dinner in Hoboken.
2018-03-21,4,I've been here for their lunch special a few times, and for $8 you get around 7-8 wings with a side of rice and coleslaw. It takes around 15-20 minutes for the food to come out, but its worth the wait. This place has nothing on the Korean fried chicken places in Queens, however it does the job of fulfilling my sticky, soy fried chicken cravings. They also offer other Korean dishes like bibimbap and french fries, and do delivery.
2018-03-06,4,My boyfriend recently tried this place out and after he told me it was delicious, I found Chicken Factory at the top of my "take out list" (I hope I'm not the only one with that type of list haha). We ordered the large wing and drumstick combo, half sweet & spicy half soy garlic with a side of fries. We placed the order through Yelp and was pleased to see how easy it was to use.Upon picking up, I wanted to redeem the check in offer for a free bottle of soda, but the employee was very short and said that they "don't do that".. I was more disappointed at how the employee handled it than not receiving the free soda. After being turned down, we picked up the order and were on our way to eat at the comfort of my boyfriend's living room. When we unpackaged the food, we saw the chicken to be sufficiently sauced, which is a very important to me, and that the fries were soggy from the steam. I wish the box was ventilated, even with 3 or 4 poked holes, to let the steam out a little.Despite the soggy fries, the chicken was delicious and seemed fair for the price that we paid. The interior the restaurant was not very clean or cozy, screamed "take out" more than "eat in", so I was expecting a little more in terms of packaging of food for take out. All in all, the food was definitely a hit and deserves a solid four stars.
2018-02-18,3,I ordered delivery here recently and the chicken really hit the spot!  It was very tasty and just what I expected it to taste.  Prices were just a tad on the pricey side since we had to pay a delivery fee, tax and also tip.  So if you can avoid delivery, go pick it up.  I ordered the jap chae as well and that was a rip off unfortunately.  For the price, you get a teeny tiny portion.  It comes in a bento style box with rice, salad, pickled cucumbers and cole slaw.  Now that might sound like a good combo to you and worth the price, but it is not.  A typical order of jap chae for the price they charge is just jap chae by itself.  It's usually a large portion and filling and bang for your buck.  This was not the case here.  Do not order the jap chae here.  Not worth it.  Go elsewhere where they serve it properly.  There was only one option on the menu and it didn't indicate it came with the rest of the stuff.  The stuff it came with were just cheap fillers that don't cost much.  Definitely a rip off and not worth your money.  I repeat do not order this.  I have a feeling the other dishes besides the chicken might be like this too so make sure before you order so you know what you're getting.  I would eat the chicken again here, but I would not do delivery.  It's too bad because their chicken is actually good.  It's just a shame it's so expensive, they charge for delivery and rip you off on stuff like the jap chae.  I hate it when places nickel and dime.  This is not how korean places usually operate.  It's probably because it's the only korean spot in the area so they can do whatever they want.
2018-01-21,1,Horrible service. Erika night shift manager is the worst - these employees as a whole are horrible and do NOT care about the quality of the food or service
2017-12-26,4,Tried this place for the first time and got both wings and bugolgi. I'll start with the bugolgi which I'd say was 3/10 it had decent taste but just didn't taste fresh. It also came with salad rice and 2 other sides which I did not order and there was no mention of on the menu. I thought for the price I'd get 2-3x the amount of meat I was given considering the menu states only the meat and rice were in the meal. I would not order again and would not recommend it. I also got a large order of wings and split the sauce. Most people complain that the soy ginger doesn't taste like soy ginger at all but what I got was a nice crispy wing that had a touch of soy flavoring which was nice because it didn't over power the great taste of the chicken. The spicy sauce was also a tad spicier than what I would normally like but had fantastic flavor. I appreciated the mix of large drum sticks with wings. It was also pretty great biting into the wings and having them still steaming hot even though I ordered delivery. Wings were 9.5/10 in taste texture and were a decent value too. I would highly recommend either sauce or even splitting it if you don't mind spicy.
2017-12-13,4,Quick delivery even in the snow. I got wings and drumsticks. Wings were really good, crispy and flavorful. The larger  drumsticks were not crisp and were a bit chewy and tough. Pretty gross. I recommend the wings.
2017-12-01,5,It is very delicious! The best chicken wings in our town!
2017-11-22,4,Chicken was awesome, crisp beyond belief. Sauce was amazing. Cons: I actually wish they were smaller, I hate big ass wings. Blue cheese comes in a dressing packet, huge blue cheese guy.
2017-11-16,5,Korean fried chicken is amazing. Although the preparation takes a bit longer than what you might be used to, the thin and crispy skin is worth it. We love getting half spicy and half sweet. Really hope this places stays open because it is a gem!
2017-11-13,4,I was really excited when a Korean anything came to Hoboken, especially Korean fried chicken. The chicken is great and I've ditched Cluck U whenever I have a craving. It can take awhile though (at least it's fresh!) so I suggest ordering ahead of time if possible (they're on seamless which is so convenient). The other Korean dishes are fine, but not something to write home about. I've tried a few diff varieties of the bibimbap (mixed rice with meat and veggies) but I'd recommend you save that dish for a trip to KTown. Overall, I give the chicken a high vote of confidence. I like to get the half wings / half drumsticks in the garlic soy & the sweet and spicy two sauce combo. The half and half combo is pretty clutch! The spicy is a bit spicy for me, so I let it cool down and I swear the kick isn't as bad.
2017-10-01,5,Chicken and fries are really nice. The amount is large, it is not too sweet and not too salty, it is just right on the taste. Keep me back again and again
2017-09-30,4,Korean takeout + excellent wings.  What is not to love!  Plenty of vegetarian choices if you swing that way.  We enjoy the bibimbap both with meat and without.  Try the fried chicken cutlet with rice if you have little ones who aren't ready for the spicy stuff.  Solidly in the rotation for the forseeable future.
2017-09-30,4,I've had it to-go. Very good fries! Check was good (obviously). No complaints about the food. Can't speak for the interior since I had it to-go.
2017-09-02,5,I think delicious and fresh food is the best,the kimchi can be better if they make it more salty\()/
2017-08-30,1,It had not friendly, the seafood pie was very bland and I just could feel the taste of onion
2017-08-19,5,very good fried chicken and very good delivery service as well.Definitely would order again.
2017-06-26,5,Looove love love the chicken here! Whatever I get, it always includes a combination of the sweet spicy and soy garlic. Like previously mentioned, I'm sure it's not the best choice for a health conscious person but a treat once in a while doesn't hurt.
2017-05-28,4,Ordered delivery from here last night. The wings are just as good, if not better, than Hansel. I got the mixed bucket and both flavors were great and the wings were nice and crispy! Fast delivery but make sure to ask for extra blue cheese or ranch as the packets are a bit small. Will definitely reorder from here again soon.
2017-04-09,5,Taste nice, even better than a lot of Korean style Fried Chicken in the Korean Town in nyc. But it is a little pricy
2017-02-27,5,this is the best fried chicken i ever eat! much better than korean town in NYC! Love it
2017-02-19,1,There was no flavor in these wings except cloying sweetness.How can you call a flavorless wing Korean? I had to put my own sauce on which sort of defeats the purpose of ordering (very expensive as far as wings go) food.
2017-01-31,5,Best chicken in new jersey. Highly recommended. I prefer this place than other franchised one
2017-01-07,4,we have been doing kfc since bonchon first appeared in manhattan. been to all the usual suspects in manhattan and queens. i gotta say that this little place on washington ave is on par with their cousins in nyc. very limited menu, but the chicken pieces are large, crispy and moist. great place for a quick bite as you walk around or drink around the town.
2017-01-06,4,Love their mixed bucket of wings - half sweet spicy and half soy garlic. Nice thing is you can request the exact split you'd like (at least they let me do it :))!Flavors are awesome, super hot, cooked perfectly. GREAT skin on these things - I assume they are double deep fried? So not good at all for a health conscious meal...I haven't had anything else of theirs so don't feel right giving them a full 5* rating. Hopefully more to come!
2016-11-01,4,KFC (Korean Fried Chicken) in Hoboken?! Sign me up.I came here with 3 other coworkers and we ordered wings/drumsticks, large fries, and the original bibimbap. Odd combo but we finished everything! The chicken can use a little more flavor, but it was freshly cooked and yummy. The bibimbap and fries were pretty good, but I thought the fries were slightly overcooked.Our lunch came out to $55, so about $13.75 each, which was pretty reasonable for the amount and variety of food we had. The owner is super friendly and she even gave us tons of free radish for our chicken! Overall, a solid lunch spot in Hoboken. Can't wait to come back to try their other dishes.... and have more KFC.Important tip: The fried chicken is cooked to order, so make sure to call in advance! It takes about 15-20 minutes, so if you're coming for lunch, it's probably best to have the chicken come out when you arrive.
2016-10-09,5,I don't know what they add to this chicken or fry it but it's like crack (I think) the favors are amazing and they manage to fry it to a perfect crisp, yet it doesn't come out greasy or dry. JUST RIGHT!! Oh and they must have a French fry fairy preparing the French fried BECAUSE THEY are always the right crisp never never soggy. I thought it was a one time deal but every time i order its consistent!! YUMMMM
2016-10-08,1,If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. If you ever plan on ordering delivery from here, DON'T. After taking 25 minutes longer than the expected delivery time, the food that arrived was soggy (to the point that it was actually wet) and cold. We called the restaurant and told them the food was literally inedible and we hadn't eaten any of it. They then told us we had to TAKE A VIDEO OF OUR FOOD to "prove" that it wasn't right. We pointed out it took much longer than expected and that's why the food was cold. We were then told "We'll send the chicken, but we're not sure about the fries". I guess they didn't believe our uneaten fries had enough proof that they were complete trash. Waste of time and money. Will never go back.
2016-09-24,1,There was literally no meat in the bowl, all veggies like I'm a five year old. This place is so weak, save your money and go get a cheesesteak.
2016-09-23,4,Great chicken, if you've never had Korean fried chicken, then this needs to be on your list of places to eat in Hoboken. A bit pricy for the quantity of the chicken, but if you were to eat in a restaurant you can expect to pay around $12 dollars for your standard 15 piece buffalo chicken wings, you get roughly about 10 pieces of chicken for the same price point. Long story short, I order out from here about once, maybe twice a month, and everyone who I've recommended is hooked!!
2016-08-29,5,Great service, the wings were lit. You gotta try the sweet n spicy wings. They were amazing!
2016-07-02,5,The best Korean fried chicken in Hudson County. Crispy, savory. The hot is hot without burning a hole in your stomach and the soy ginger is awesome!  Rivals the best chicken places you can find in New York or Ft. Lee/Palisades Park!  Small place not many tables. Best for take out or delivery.
2016-06-29,2,I used to love their BBQ chicken very much, but if you are looking for delivery when you are starving, definitely not this one, waited way too long to get my order (I live in Hoboken) and called the restaurant, girl on the phone was rude. My friend told me BonChon is now delivering to Hoboken, tried them once and their delivery is fast, and they are in JC! Really wish Chicken Factory can improve their delivery service. I will still go to Chicken Factory only for pick up.
2016-05-21,4,Just moved here from VA, and all we have there for Korean fried chicken is Bonchon. So with going from a standard like that, I'd say Chicken Factory is about on par, if not better than the flavors of soy garlic or the gochujang spicy chicken like Bonchon. If you haven't been to Bonchon or Kyochon, going here is definitely great option. Coming back to try more of their actual Korean cuisine
2016-05-18,4,Me and my boyfriend had the garlic soy chicken. Honestly probably the best chicken we've ever had. Amazing!! So much food too! Definitely worth the price.
2016-04-27,2,Being an "as long as it's fried" chicken fan, I really wanted to love this place. Stopped here after a long day. Despite the Yelp warnings, I didn't order in advance. After a 25 minute wait, my half sweet and spicy and half soy garlic wings were ready. You can only imagine the anticipation as I walked back to my apt. A few bites in of each and I was disappointed. The flavor was average, the chicken besides the skin was bland and some parts were soggy and didnt have the crunch Korean fried chicken is famous for. Sadly, it wasn't worth the wait or the cost. I'll stick to BonChon on Newark Ave in JC or even Cluck U Chicken right on Washington for my fried chicken fix.
2016-04-17,4,Korean style chicken wings. Yummy!! Even small size came with a lot of chicken wings! Seafood pancake was also very good! love Korean food.:)
2016-04-06,1,We just finished moving and were starving so we decided to try it out. The photos looked so delicious.... but the food was subpar, overpriced and took forever to come out.-The bibimbap ( rice mixed with vegetables) came in a plastic bowl half empty. I dumped a crazy amount of red sauce after my first bite because it was just so bland. I would not recommend ordering it! You're better off with just rice. -The fried chicken looked pretty good, but it was just alright. Again not much soy garlic flavor. We were all starving, yet the three of us couldn't even finish an order of chicken and rice. I would much rather take the 20 mins path ride to ktown than eat here again.
2016-03-25,1,The worse costumer service !!! The girl who takes the orders over the phone (iyeska) is very disrespectful rude and nasty to costumer.!! My self and a friend ordered lunch from here a few weeks ago , the order was completely messed up, when we called to let them know there was an error she filed out and cursed us out saying "we placed the wrong order " Like really? I think I know what I want to eat!!" I then has ask to speak to a manager! She replied she was the "Manager" WOW!!! I was very unhappy and refused to pay for food I didn't ask for along with poor service !! Also the chicken was extremely cold yuck!!! I sent the food back and took my business else were, my friend and I enjoyed chicken  at BonChon !!! Much better!
2016-03-24,3,Not bad. Fast and friendly service. But I have bu far had better korean fried wings. These weren't terrible, a little dry and salty, enjoyable enough, but I would go elsewhere. As of yet, nowhere tops Cafe Soho in Philadelphia as far as wings go!
2016-02-29,4,Got take out from here one day. Thought the wings were very good and fries to.
2016-02-24,5,im interested to know how to submit my order on yelp. There's no submits click to click on!
2016-01-27,4,Delicious chicken wings. Korean fried chicken is one of the best tasting treats you can have, it's truly an experience that is unlike any other.I've gone here several times, )usually after some drinking is involved). I have friends who live in Hoboken and we always bring back an order of two of the spicy garlic wings. These things are amazing, super crispy and spicy and leave you wanting more. Definitely the most addicting chicken wings I've ever had.As for the prices... Not too friendly. They have two choices,  small for about 13.99 or a large for 20 and change. A small is more than enough for one person who isn't extremely hungry, but it definitely isn't cheap. Best bet is to get a large and split it with drinking buddies.Also, calling ahead is a smart idea because these wings aren't cooked until you order them, so you could wait 20 minutes or more for their food.They are open decently late and the people are pretty friendly. If you want amazing wings that will definitely leave you wanting more, look no further.
2016-01-03,4,To start off this is a awesome Korean chicken but Only four choices for you to order of how you get your chicken....boneless, sweet and spicy, soy garlic, or both in one order. (Wings and/or drumsticks)...you also have side orders of fries or rice....*rubs hands togeather* lets get to what I got? I got to taste both soy garlic and sweet & spicy...my preference As a fat kid is the soy garlic but that's just me! Lol...of course the pricing is Hoboken eatery prices...but you get the bang for your buck at this joint, trust me from a chicken head like me Ctfu... A Must try that is something different from the usual crowns,kfc,Popeyes chicken you're used too!
2016-01-03,1,The worst service ever. You ask to speak to a manager and they tell you she's not in at the moment. But it's strange someone has to be in charge. Do not leave menus in a building 2.6 miles away from you guys if your not going to deliver. Just because the food is great the service can be horrible. Stop hiring unprofessional people to answer the phone. They should know what everything is on the menu. I'm sorry but for service you guys suck !
2015-10-08,1,Absolutely disgraceful customer service.  Ordered delivery and was given the wrong order.  Called to ask the to exchange the orders and the girl on the phone said I was lying and she did not make a mistake; therefore, she would not exchange the order unless I walked to the restaurant and showed her proof of her mistake.  Tried to cancel the order through seamless but restaurant would not cooperate.  Had to walk to restaurant to "prove myself" and they wouldn't even refund the delivery charge and gratuity I paid even though I had to walk there.  Terrible business acumen and a disgusting way to treat a customer. Definitely will NOT return.
2015-10-02,5,This place is so good.  I always get delivery.  Soy garlic wings and small kimchi.  Not too pricey and the wings are delicious.
2015-09-23,4,Good for korean cravings during lunch hours. They make a good bibimbap and fairly ok wings. Lunch menu is pretty reasonable. Excellent service, I was 50 odd cents short on cash and they didn't take credit card below $15, but the staff was nice enough to waive it.
2015-09-04,5,Listen...plain and simple the best mutha f'in fried chicken I ever had in my life! I always order the large boneless with both sauces. For real though, the best fried chicken ever!!!!
2015-07-12,5,We used to live in Hoboken and this was a favorite. Now it's a must stop when we're up North. GREAT chicken. We always do the half and half.
2015-07-05,3,We love the chicken. Half and half but this one time. Burnt rice. No chicken factory. Just NO! And how the heck do you even burn rice on a rice cooker? Congrats on doing that but next time just scoop around the burnt parts.
2015-06-28,5,Best chicken ever and from the outside you would never know it was so good.  The decor was nowhere and clean. They seemed to have more delivery orders then inside orders, but the wings were heaven even though they only have 2 flavors. I will definitely return.
2015-06-28,4,We have ordered buckets of both their sweet and spicy wings and both are super delicious. I prefer going to pick it up because delivery can take a while. Ranch is much better than Blue cheese for these wings. Only issue is that I always wind up feeling sick after I eat it.
2015-04-12,3,Go for the wings not the Korean food.   The Korean food is flavorless.  The bibimbap is too wet because they don't squeeze the water out of the veggies.   It's disappointing when you need your Korean fix in Hoboken.   I wish they would take their Korean food more seriously or another place would open.
2015-04-02,3,When Chicken Factory first opened, it was a definite 5 star, but over the last few years its really gone down hill.  I honestly feel its more of a 2.5 star but Ill give it 3 because its the only option in Hoboken and Yelp wont let me,  When it first opened, delivery would take about 1.5 hrs and was great, but I feel they probably got a bunch of complaints and decided to sacrifice quality for speed.  I also feel the quality of the chicken itself was much better when it opened.  I still occasionally thrown them an order when I want a fried chicken fix, but it nowhere near some of the great KFC places in the city.   Sadly back in the day I would put it up with the best.
2015-04-01,5,I guess I can't say much more than what others wrote.  I haven't been there in almost two years because of a bad experience on Super Bowl Sunday 2013.  But I went back this week and I'm so glad i did.  The soy garlic wings are just so good.  And $13 for the small (12 wings approx) is much better than BonChon.  Hoboken is lucky to have local Korean fried chicken this good!
2015-03-24,5,Great chicken for the price. Only place in this area worth trying without having to go to Ktown in the city.
2015-02-10,5,The chicken wings in soy garlic are phenomenal. Korean-style chicken is unsurpassed. Their bibimbap is also good but not the best I've had. However, the owners are super-friendly and courteous. Once you've eaten Chicken Factory wings, it's hard to eat regular buffalo wings.
2015-02-09,5,Best wings in Hoboken! I have had both their spicy and soy wings. I prefer the spicy. The wings are very crispy and don't get soggy when you order for delivery. Their vegetarian bimibap is also really good. If you love wings you should definitely give this place a chance.
2015-01-03,5,YESSSSSS. Always hits the spot. I just wish they gave you more for the price you pay! But there are no other wings, than Korean wings!
2014-11-17,5,Best wings in Hoboken.  This is korean fried chicken in all its glory.  I always go for the Large order 50% spicy, 50% soy garlic.  Compared to other Korean Fried Chicken places, I feel like the spicy version here is more bearable.  My only complaint is that it doesn't come with free korean radish - which all the bonchons i've been to usually include.  But honestly, you cannot go wrong with these wings.
2014-10-26,5,Love love their chicken wings. I haven't tried anything else here so I can only speak for their wings. I have tried a lot of Korean Fried Chicken in NJ and Manhattan and this is my second favorite. Best is at mad for chicken in the city but this place is the best in NJ I've tried. Get the Korean radish with the wings. It will help with the oily fried taste. I only do pick up orders and they are always ready within 20 mins. I eat here regularly at least every other week. If you haven't tried it yet, I recommend you do. The spicy flavor is sometimes really spicy and sometimes not so spicy. I recommend this place and I don't say that about many places.
2014-09-21,1,Ordered my meal at 8 pm, estimated Time of arrival was 45-60min, at 9pm I called to check on the status and I was told it would be here by 9:30, but instead it showed up at 10:15pm. When I asked if I could have my money back if it was cold, they ignored me and said they would call back. The customer service at this establishment is horrendous.
2014-09-13,3,I have had tried Korean style fried chicken from many places around the city and jersey and this place is just OK. We ordered delivery for haemul pa jeon appetizer,  a large wings+drumstick combo, and a small wings for almosy 60 dollars and we found it wasnt emough food for four people. Also a lot of wings did not have enough meat and a lot of breading. The sauce is nice but not worth the price. Next time I would just go for regular wings for third of the price and save some money for beer to go with wings.
2014-09-02,2,Eh, the service is not good and the food is a little worse. Small but open place and has outdoor seating. I would keep looking if you are into Korean chicken.
2014-08-17,5,The fried chicken here is the best in Hoboken . And the portions are huge, it's always cooked to perfection and u can tell that these guys change their oil everyday. The owner and his wife are always there and on top of their business , very kind and sweet. Please go check them out !!
2014-08-08,5,One of my top 3 go-to places in Hoboken for delivery.  The chicken and portions here are just awesome - tried both the soy garlic and hot, and prefer the soy garlic flavoring.  I have only ordered delivery so can't speak to the location, but everytime I have ordered (4-5 times in the last 2 weeks) the chicken has arrived within 30-40 minutes nice and hot and still crispy.I also thought their bibimbap and kimchi were quite good, especially considering the lack of Korean in Hoboken, but their chicken is definitely the prize here.  One note - their "small" size wings is actually pretty large (would say 10-12 wings) which was a pleasant surprise.
2014-07-21,5,***TIME: Anytime, once a week.***FOOD (5/5 stars): Best hang over food, best PMS food, best chicken wings, best put-me-in-a-better-mood-after-shitty-day. Chicken wings (4/5 stars): ALWAYS order same large size (about 22-24 wings), which is half spicy and half soy garlic. Had delivered for 8 relatives, but had to deliver for a second time within the same hour because they loved it so much. Same with my parents and a house party we threw. People eat it at least twice before they leave....that's also because I paid for it but mainly because it's so addictive. Make sure to order radish with it because it cleanses your palette and tastes good!***SERVICE (4/5 stars): Not sit and get served, so I cannot comment on that. However, service is typical for an asian place.***CUSTOMERS: 95% of the time we order to go to get it delivered, so not sure about the customers.***ENVIRONMENT/SPACE: About 9-12 tables in the front.***WILL I COME BACK?: Yes and have been. So does everyone I refer!!!! Ahhh want some now, but cannot because they're closed and it's 11:58pm now :(
2014-06-28,2,Although the chicken is tasty, the Yelp offer for a free bottle of soda was not honored. Not trying to be a cheapskate, but if your establishment offers an online deal, I believe you should honor it. Ugh.
2014-06-06,4,Pretty awesome Korean Fried Chicken.This place was a gas saver when it opened up during my time at Stevens. My friends and I no longer had to make a drive to Fort Lee for BonChon to get our KFC fix. The food is made to order, as is the case for most KFC places, so you'll have to wait a bit unless you call in advance. They serve other Korean food too, but I haven't had any of it. The service is pretty good and the lunch specials are a good deal. The place is clean and has outdoor seating. And they deliver if you're lazy. Overall, it's a good, unique addition to Hoboken.
2014-05-31,3,I really am trying to like this place because it's the only Korean joint in Hoboken.  Got the bimbimbap lunch special ($9.99) which was really good. Wish it came with more of the spicy sweet red pepper sauce. The miso soup that comes with it had no tofu or seaweed and was super bland, they didn't use much miso paste in it.  The chicken wing lunch special ($7.49) was good, not better than the kyochons and other Korean chicken places in NY though. It came with rice and coleslaw. The coleslaw was pretty bland. Wish it came with kimchi instead. Usually Korean places give kimchi for free but you have to buy it here ($1.99). I'd still come back when I have Korean food cravings but probably only for lunch specials because dinner is the same exact thing but $3 more just cause.
2014-05-06,5,Yep, still the perfect Korean fried chicken you can get outside of Korea town. Oh yes.
2014-04-12,5,I was skeptical but boy was I wrong. The chicken is delectable, made fresh to order. Tasty spicy or sweet skin and juicy on the inside. Does take a wait since made fresh to order. Bibimbop delicious too, as well as the cole slaw. Found myself daydreaming about the chicken the following day which means it was really really good!!
2014-01-09,5,The name is not necessarily appealing but hands down the most delicious sweet spicy wings ever!!! Like eating chicken candy. I also really like the bimibap, usually get the vegetarian but they are all good, and nothing greasy or oily. I don't think you will be disappointed. You might be addicted.
2013-10-17,5,Really slept on these wingies; I've lived across the street for 3 years and just tried them yesterday.  Large order for pickup netted me 2 doz crispy meaty wings, both soy and sweet n spicy were tasty.  I prefer other flavors to buffalo, so I'd say these are possibly my new favorite wings in town?
2013-10-12,4,My first visit and I liked it. Chicken Factory has Korea Town style takeout/delivery chicken.  I chose the boneless chicken with half hot sauce and half soy/garlic.  Both were very tasty and please note the spicy is not for wimps.  The service is polite and efficient; expect to wait a while for your order but in my opinion, that means it's likely being made to order and that's a good thing.  $11.99 for a small order is not necessarily cheap, but there was plenty of food, and you can save half your order for the next day.  There is some seating, yet it looks like the majority of their business is out the door. I'm sure the wings are equally popular and I will try them on a future visit.  I'm not a regular for fast food chicken, but Chicken Factory will certainly satisfy the occasional craving and I'd recommend giving them a try.
2013-08-25,5,I ordered there yesterday. Forget about the bibimbop, this place is for chicken lovers. I used to have many Bonchon or Kyochon chicken before. But this one is just better. The chicken tastes good and is perfectly cooked. The soy sauce and garlic drumsticks are bigger and way better than Bonchon and I also had the boneless sweet and spicy chicken filet. Awesome!!! Not only it has the right balance between tenderness and crispyness, but also the quantity is great compared to other Korean Chicken joints. GREAT!!!!
2013-07-21,2,As a Korean American who lives in Hoboken, I'm torn about giving this place a poor review because this is the only Korean-ish restaurant in Hoboken and I wish there were more. But as much as I tried to like them, I just didn't enjoy my experience there. The chicken was okay. We got a mixed drumstick/wing plate. I think the wings are better because the proportion of batter to meat is probably higher and you get more of the tasty flavoring. The chicken was pretty good but it not as good as Kyochon.At first, I thought the chicken was overpriced but when I got through my meal, I was pretty full so it's deceptively filling.The bibimbap was pretty bad compared to ones you'll find in Koreantown. I would not recommend it unless you really can't eat anything else.I thought the eating experience at the restaurant was pretty poor. They should give people hand wipes since it is chicken. Also, even though it wasn't an extremely hot day, it was still fairly warm and they didn't seem inclined to turn the A/C on, which made me think they were really cheap and stingy. I think I'm going to avoid this place and just drive up to Fort Lee or go to Manhattan for Korean food.
2013-05-26,4,Your standard Korean wings place. Hoboken's Bon Chon. A little pricey and takes a long time to make(as do most Korean wings places). Prepare for long wait if you do delivery, however the wait is well worth it. Both flavors soy garlic and spicy are both good. Other entrees and appetizers are good but nothing to go crazy about. If I order here I always get just the wings.You have a Korean wing fix to satisfy? Chicken factory will satisfy,
2013-05-03,4,It is hard to find less-oil healthy food on the Washington St with great taste, but their Bibimbap is one of the few. All 4 flavors of Bibimbap they offer are actually more or less the same but taste quite good! Also, The restaurant is very clean and comfortable, too!However, honestly, the food is a little bit expensive.
2013-04-29,4,Food 4/5 - I have only tried their chicken wings and they were very good.  (Note: I am not a huge Korean Wing fan)Price 3/5 - Very Expensive.  You should NOT be charging that much for wings ($20).  Oh my goodness.  I ended up taking it home and it made dinner for 2 more nights so I guess the price was Atmosphere 4/5 - It looks a lot like a Boba Milk Tea chain store only it is not very busy.   It is very clean, which I appreciate and I liked how they had a Chicken Wing tin for you to put the bones.  On a side note, I advise that they advertise more, especially to the growing East Asian community in Hoboken, this place looks like it could be a little hotspot!Come Again?  Yes, I want to try the Bibimbap!
2013-04-22,3,I've had better bibimbop in K-Town (Manhattan) but I live just a block away from Chicken Factory so it's conveniently located for me. The bulgoki is delicious but the portion isn't big enough to justify the high prices here. I come here once in a while and the food is always good and fresh, but don't expect a lot of bang for your buck.
2013-02-23,3,The no denying that the wings are delicious. The only reason I don't eat here much is because they're food is ridiculously expensive. It's hard to overpay for a meal that doesn't fill you up. On the other hand, the staff is very friendly. So if you have some extra cash lying around I say give it a try.
2013-01-03,3,This is knock off of BonChon Chicken- KyoChon, Chicken Factory, whatever you want to call it... Nothing compares to the original BonChon.  Might I also add that here on the this side of the Hudson, a small order of chicken means: - 9 pieces for $11.99-- how is this small and how is this cheap?  You can mix and match the flavors and chicken types.  I got the wings and drums- note that the "drums" are not the small drums, but rather, whole chicken drums.  I didn't know this. A whole drum is too heavy Korean Fried Chicken style- so stick with just the wings; you get the small drums too. - 20 min wait for double fried chicken- which is pretty standard-A dry "Soy Garlic" and a way too saucy/tangy Sweet and Spicy Sauce. The latter seems to be unique to Chicken Factory, and it's prob. their take on the American Buffalo wing as the Lord knows American is pretty rampant here in Hobokes.. it was too messy, saucy, and tangy for me. Unlike the American buffalo sauce though, it was actually spicy.  The Soy Garlic was done wrong completely- Soy Garlic is never supposed to be dry and lacking in flavor. This Soy Garlic didn't have enough 1) Garlic, and 2) Sauciness. There are two tables to dine in, so I suggest taking out or going Seamless.. which seems the route most go.  On the other hand, the girl at the counter was really nice and friendly.
2012-11-15,5,This place is great - kind of a hidden gem in Hoboken. Everything is always fresh and cooked to order, and the soy garlic flavoring is incredible. Menu is simple, but still has a lot of options. Their wings are cooked with just a little bit of flour, which is good for low carb. Kimchi is delicious, and my very picky friend loved the bibimbap when he tried it. Only problem with this place is its kind of addictive!!
2012-10-14,4,I'm always orderin' me a box full o' boneless filet. With an exclusive selection of 2 sauces, I find myself goin' the good ol' sweet & spicy route. That spice is to die for, y'know?The chicken here is good. From the places I've managed to find in Hoboken to satisfy my chicken fix, I think this may be your best option in these parts. They've got the whole Korean fried chicken thing going on - if you find yourself a fan of places such as, oh, Bon Chon, you'll love it here. They've got the fix you need if you find yourself a Hoboken local.You will get your wallet kicked in if you order from here regularly. On top of squeezing you dry for their food (it is worth every penny, or close to it, anyway), you've got high delivery minimums and the like. $19 for a large thing of boneless filet, plus a few cans of soda, plus tip, comes out to around $27ish in total. Oof. Starts to add up after a while. I've never been inside this place, so this review is strictly on delivery.- Usually on time (within 35 minutes)- Always gets your order right- Your wallet will be crying and your credit card company will be thankful this place exists- Chicken is yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!- Sweet & Spicy is thebomb.com
2012-09-28,5,I was introduced to Korean Fried Chicken at Mad for Chicken in NYC. After my first bite I was hooked!! I was so ecstatic to find Chicken Factory in Hoboken when I moved to the area!! The crispness of the skin, juicy meat & the favors of the sauces (both the spicy & savory) are to die for!! I will miss it dearly when we move to Australia!
2012-08-28,2,As my comment depicted, I love Korean food and was very excited when I learned I could get Korean food in Hoboken. Big mistake. Although my son liked the chicken, I didn't appreciate the feather stubble. Smdh. I also tried the bulgogi. The portions were small and sans kimchi, which borders sacrilege. Luckily, I had kimchi at home, but I'll drive to H-Mart the next time I want Korean food. Do better CF, please do better.
2012-08-28,1,Horrible Food. Delivery took more than 1 hour, despite $2 delivery charge plus tips. Avoid!!
2012-07-19,3,I ordered a small take-out order from here, half spicy and half soy garlic. It was decent and just enough for one person. I preferred the spicy sauce. I think it was a bit overpriced though. Considering there are no other options for Korean food, I suppose the pricing sort of makes sense. I don't think I'll be going back here unless I have a weird craving for Korean fried chicken.
2012-06-29,4,i am indeed a fan. there is nothing else in hoboken that can satisfy a munchy chicken craving like chicken factory.both of their sauces are delicious, the chicken is meaty (legs are huge, but my fave is the boneless fillet), and prices are reasonable.  my chicken has always been nice and hot  and i almost get the sense these are made to order (can't be sure since the kitchen is not visible). people working there are pleasant and helpfulcons: closes too early, only 2 sauces, and you have to wait 10-15 min for chicken.  if they were open late night they would make a killing!
2012-05-16,1,I had a grilled chicken salad. By far one of the most unsatisfying salads I have ever had. I wouldn't recommend it...unless you wanna waste $8. I'll have to try something else next time...that's if I feel like experimenting. The service is fine. A little on the slow side. I'm strictly reviewing based off the one salad I had. ick.
2012-05-06,3,I got hooked on Chicken Bon Chon in Northern California and was happy to see that the trend had made it here. Koreans have mastered the art of barbecue beef, but the fact that they're doing wonderful things with chicken wings too, well, is just plain awesome.I really didn't expect to find a good bon chon place in Hoboken and now that I've eaten here a few times, this place has good chicken and that's it. I've now tried the jap chae and the bi bim bop and they're all sub par.The chicken though is just plain delicious. Try to eat it as soon as you get it though for maximum crisp. As far as whether to go soy garlic or spicy, it's a tough call. The spiciness is the real deal though. Don't get it unless you're ready for the business end of some major fire. It's a good burn though, not fake crazy burn that some places go for.
2012-05-01,1,Gave this place a try, ordered 3 different styles of wings.  They were all good....they were tasty and crispy.  But I got sick within a few hours....so I won't be coming here again.  Sorry!
2012-04-20,1,Tried to order wings for Superbowl Sunday. Placed the order early in the morning, to be delivered at 6:15pm. But half an hour past that time, they still didn't arrive. 45 minutes later, and they still didn't arrive. So we called them to find out if they've even started making it, but they were stumbling around trying to find our order. They said they lost it, and kept us on hold for a long time, while they kept looking for it. Eventually we got fed up and told them to cancel the order. The imbecile just hung up on us, without acknowledging the cancellation. Never ordering from here again!
2012-03-30,1,This place actually used to be really good, I don't know what happened. It's like they're resting on their laurels of being the only Korean fried chicken place in Hoboken. The quality has become absolutely disgusting. KFC should be crispy, not soggy. We've tried it three times since this downhill slide hoping they were just one-off instances, but we've had enough
2012-03-07,4,I love that almost every place in Hoboken delivers! I was stuck in my hotel room during the first snow fall last October, so I was super happy when the folks at Chicken Factory said they could deliver to my room!I ordered the half soy garlic and half spicy sweet wings with a side of steamed rice. I really liked the spicy sweet wings - crunchy outside, tender inside and a perfect blend of sweet and spicy! The soy garlic wings were good too but the spicy sweet were my favorite.
2012-03-03,1,Don't order from here. I ordered 2 orders of spicy wings from them for delivery, they delivered 1 order of spicy wings and 1 order of soy garlic wings. When I called them back about the wrong order, the MANAGER asked me to return the 1 order of soy garlic wings, knowing that I had already eaten a couple, so they could (and I quote) "RESELL IT IN OUR STORE." It also took about 45 minutes for delivery.
2012-02-14,4,Quick pickup place for Korean fried chicken. They make the order on the spot so it does take a while, sometimes 40minutes, so call ahead. The chicken legs with the honey garlic are the best. High quality chicken with a very crunchy outside. Better than other Korean Fried Chicken places in Korea-town. Friendly service. I just hate the name, a little embarassed to go to a place calle the Chicken Factory with all the talk of the inhumane way chickens are farmed, maybe it should be called the The Korean Chicken Shoppe.
2011-12-17,3,Bibimbap. In Hoboken. My prayers were answered when I discovered this. Unfortunately, Chicken Factory helps maintain the theory that Hoboken is lacking in quality ethnic food outside of Italian and falafel.  Bibimbap is not even close to the best I've had but at least it's an offering. In order to meet the delivery minimum ($20!), I ordered french fries.  These were off the HOOK. They must fry them in chicken fat (*anti-vegetarian alert!*), I'd guess? Honestly, I'm not sure I really care as these bad boys were amazing. 2 stars for the bibimbap quality, 5 stars for the fries, 1 star for the ridiculously high minimum for delivery..
2011-11-06,4,This place reminds me of Bon Chon!  I ordered wings, half soy garlic and the other half spicy sweet.  I got the one with bones it it.  My girl got a couple pieces of boneless.  For me, eating it off the bone taste better for some reason, but thats just me.The chicken is super crispy!  Bon Chon definitely have some competition.  I love Korean Wings!  They need more of these places all over New Jersey!  Oh yeah service was pretty quick even though the place was bumpin!!!
2011-09-27,2,I was really excited to see a Korean fried chicken place open up in Hoboken.  The two things I've always found lacking in Hoboken (based on random night cravings) are Korean fried chicken and bahn mi (RIP americanized bahn mi version at Dino's).  However, I was so disappointed by this place.  The whole chicken looked like an anorexic chicken and the flavoring was not as in your face as other Korean fried chicken places I've been to.  I would prefer a Bon Chon over this place.
2011-09-17,5,They have limited selection, but the chicken is superb. The wings and the drumsticks have great flavor, your choice of spicyor soy ginger, and you have the option to get both. Its advertised as natural, and it tastes that way, very fresh and unprocessed. Not oily, just the right amount of crispiness. Mmmm, getting hungry just reminiscing. The kimchi is super spicy, so beware. $22 with tax for a box of wings, but oh so worth it.
2011-09-08,3,I got some take-out from here last night.The quality of the chicken meat as well as the quality of the cooking was very good. I am not so sure if I like the flavor of the sauce however. All in all it's not bad but not that great either. I might have to try it a second time with a different sauce.It takes them about 20 minutes to get an order ready so make sure you call ahead.
2011-08-14,3,I've only had the bibimbap from here, and I had it delivered... but for delivery bibimbap, it was crunchy where it needed to be crunchy, and still attractively presented.Only negative was that the amount of meat was sorta pitiful.  I could have used about an extra half-portion of what was presented.  That's a pretty big negative.  Will try the chicken next and follow up!
2011-06-20,4,I ordered a small wings and drumsticks with sweet and spicy sauce late Sunday night to have as post flag football pre Game of Thrones meal.  The small was a large portion and on par for the $11.99 price.  The wings were excellent with a great crunch despite being delivery.  The sauce was awesome, it was exactly what you think sweet and spicy should taste like.  I will definitely order from here the next time I am in the mood for fried chicken but it would be nice if they expanded their available sauce flavors.
2011-06-17,3,Not bad but the chicken here does not compare to how good Korean fried chicken is in some spots at Palisades Park or Fort Lee area. As far as the other entrees like the bulgogi, dont bother. Its too expensive for what you get and tastes like ready to eat Korean, or a microwavable meal.  If you want real good Korean try Palisades Park.
2011-06-02,4,Ordered Bibimbap and a small order of sweet and spicy wings and drumsticks--both awesome!  I called ahead to pick-up, and they were right on time when I arrived.  The chick who took the order tonight (no pun intended : )) was very pleasant to deal with both over the phone and in person.  A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for . . . this chicken will not disappoint you--the drums were just as tasty as the wings, which is usually not the case with korean fried chicken.  Ahhhh, so good . . .
2011-04-26,5,i honestly come to this place at leaat once a week. wings are freakin awesome, bulgogi is pretty good, and the service is great.i live way closer to the Bon Chon Chicken in Jersey City, but the wings just do not compare so i take extra 10-15 minute drive to this place (because of Hoboken parking).service is also always very good. theyre super nice here. just wish they had more seats. just be sure to call ahead because they make wings fresh n it takes sometime. keep up the good work chicken factory!!
2011-04-21,4,One of the better Korean fried chicken places in NY and NJ.   They have a sweet and spicy flavored fried chicken which is amazing.   They make the chicken when you order it, so it's fresh and steaming right when you get it.  So if you want fast food, go to KFC.    Their spicy sweet flavor is much better than other places and other notable korean fried chicken places do not have.     Their spicy sweet flavor is better than Bon Chon and BBQ.Even if you get it delivered or take it home, it's still crisp like you expect it to be.
2011-04-10,4,Don't come here if you're in a rush. Come here if you love crunchy, crackle-y chicken wings slathered in sticky sweet & spicy or garlic soy sauce. These wings stay magically crunchy and delicious even after sitting in the box on the long walk home. The seafood pancake was too greasy for me and the chicken salad was a bit of a disappointment. To sum it up- sure, they're slow for a fast food place, but every second is worth it.  Just get the chicken, it's what they do best.
2011-04-10,5,Best fried chicken in Hoboken.  This is genuine Korean Fried Chicken.  If you are unfamiliar with Korean Fried Chicken, it is crispy and flavorful without the grease.  Google for the NYTimes and Saveur articles.   Each order is made fresh and takes 20 minutes so call ahead before picking up your order.  Do not skip by this place just because it looks empty inside.  Most of these KFC-type places always seem to look empty. Perhaps its because people call ahead, come to get their order, then rush home to enjoy their meal.  The $20 large is the way to go.  Ask for a mix of both flavors.Give the Beef Bulgoki Wrap a try too!  Ask for it with beef and kimchi only and skip the lettuce and tomato.
2011-04-03,4,super friendly staff and local Korean Fried Chicken, meaning soy garlic and spicy sweet. they also deliver if you order $10+ in hoboken and $20+ outside. how could you beat that?!  AND they have chicken tenders (boneless), for lazy people like me that don't like to get their hands dirty. oh and they're not just chicken. they have bulgogi, bibimbap and kimchi. if you wanna get your drink on, they're byob.i went there a big group of people and they only had 4 tables available, but they brought out an extra one from out of nowhere to accommodate our group... how awesome are they?! another plus? this place is pristine. (check my pics) will i be going back?  pssshhh  i'm already there!
2011-04-01,4,It's good to call in advance and place your order. That's what I did. They said the order would be ready within 15-20 minutes... and it was! They prepared my order on time and the cashier was very courteous as well. As for the food: the chicken tasted AMAZING! I ordered a large #3 - wings & drumsticks (for me and my parents to share). It comes with 14 wings and 7 drumsticks. I ordered for the 14 wings to be soy garlic flavor and for the 7 drumsticks to be sweet spicy flavor. I didn't have any of the sweet spicy drumsticks but my parents said they tasted great and were quite spicy! I enjoyed eating the soy garlic wings. They were delicious! I love the chicken at Bon Chon but this is definitely better. I will not hesitate to order from here ever again! :)The only downside is that I didn't like their french fries. They kind of taste like the fries that Five Guys serves. Bon Chon DEFINITELY has the better fries.
2011-04-01,5,Ordered the Bulgoki (Korean BBQ with Rice) the other night, and have become an instant fan!This place rocks! Great tasting healthy food, Good size portions, and quick delivery.I'm making this place one of my main staples.
2011-03-21,5,I hate chicken wings!  I hate buffalo wings!I do however love the chicken that comes out of this place.  I will say I think the name is really awful and it does them a disservice but the wings are phenomenal.I've had other dishes there as well but the wings are the most flavorful.  I usually split the box with mild and spicy as I enjoy both of the flavors equally.  These wings have more of an Asian flavor and the chicken is not nasty.  It's a high quality and extremely tasty.The location itself has some seating and is very clean and orderly.  It looks almost like an Apple Store.  Delivery always comes quick and the people that work there and deliver are extremely polite and do an awesome job.I love to just order these on a Friday night for my wife and I and throw on a movie.One of the better fast food options in Hoboken.  This stands along with The Taco Truck as one of my Hoboken favorites.
2010-12-02,4,I love it! bon chon in jersey city (and i dont mean the one in nyc either) mind you sucks (but thats a different review) chicken factory is great tasting and delicious. the atmosphere is cute and bright.  and it is located right in the middle of hoboken on washington street which is great. the chicken came out crispy and the soy garlic and spicy chicken are delicious. crunchy and savory. the spicy chicken is spicy too =] why didnt i give it four stars? because they didnt have pickled radishes! really? authentic korean chicken without radish?! i think not.  the man who worked there, maybe the owner, said he would eventually have them. so ill be back, and maybe there will be some radishes! btw the owner was just great and very kind. they had a few other things on the menu, but  i have not tried them since i was busy scarfing down chicken. if you want korean friend chicken come here! but if its your first time go to bon chon in fort lee for the radishes. woot.  oh and if you never had korean fried chicken before, dont forget to call ahead!!!!!! we did and it was ready to eat the moment we got there.
2010-11-21,3,The chicken is cooked very well and there is a good amount of meat on each wing; however it's certainly no substitute for buffalo wings. the flavors are much different. Its also fairly expensive for wings. $12.83 for a small (12-14 wings - that's small???) and comes with a free soda. Overall I liked it, but I don't see what all the fuss is about.
2010-11-19,3,I have walked by the place several times before trying the food. I guess the name " Chicken Factory " didn;t sound very appealing to me. My overall opion of the place is that it's just okay. I am not sure what I should have expected, but the food was decent, the decor was okay and I would consider trying it another time with different food choices before making my final decision if this will be a regular spot for me to order
2010-11-14,3,The logo and name of this place doesn't strike you immediately as Korean cuisine, but the small tag line under their logo mentions it. Given that I'm not Korean, I don't know if the food here is necessarily authentic. Nevertheless, the 2 dishes we tried were good. We had the chicken drumsticks (both flavors -- garlic and sweet & spicy), and the spicy was a bit too much for me (but I can't eat much spicy foods) so if you can't take spicy foods, avoid that. The garlic flavor was good -- not too garlicky at all. We had the beef and rice dish (forget its name) and it was tasty.The con about this place is that the food takes a long time to get served as they cook it when you order. Hence, go there when you are starting to feel hungry, not when you're already starving!
2010-10-30,3,Dahl in Hoboken? I try really hard to give more Stars but the place is just to new and my coworkers didn't find anything extraordinary. Chicken is great and C.F menu aka lunch specials are average for the area. Would I recommend the chicken to my friends? YES!
2010-10-22,3,A sold three+ stars after experiencing their sweet/spicy whole chicken.  Overall, the flavor, juiciness and crispiness of the chicken was excellent.  The combination of spices in the sweet/spicy mix was very good and not too hot or overpowering.   The dark meat was flavorful and very juicy and the breast was very moist.  Altogether, definitely a good bird....but overall, not enough to be considered firmly better than average.   First, like many of the other reviews, I do think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  Second, although I do understand and value anything that is made-to-order, I had to wait 25 minutes at 2:00, while I was the only one in the restaurant.   Finally, the three carrot stix and three celery stix they gave me were laughable.Would I go back again?  Yes, indeed.  But there are a lot of chicken places in this town and just having a unique heritage does not automatically make you a standout.
2010-10-18,5,I really liked the food there. They have very unique style of chicken there. They are very friendly and they dont pre-cook like others. The store is very clean, not like any other place in Hoboken or NYC.
2010-10-13,4,Probably the best chicken wings in Hoboken. I don't say this with an off-the-cuff statement. Order the sweet and spicy wings. They are perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, with the combination of spicy that won't burn your mouth, but will make your nose run a bit, and sweet that makes you want to just devour another one.The only reason I give it four stars is the price. I'm all for paying good money for good food, but I kinda wish there was a 6-8 wing (appetizer) option for $8. The small size for wings is about $12 for 12 wings. OK, $1 a wing. They should make a smaller option here for someone looking to grab 8 wings. But trust me. You will eat all 12 of those wings in a heartbeat. They are that good.
2010-10-13,4,Yum! So glad that there is actually a Korean restaurant in Hoboken!  And a good one at that~ The chicken combo here is just as good as the Bonchon chicken in Manhattan.  It also comes with a side of radish which goes so well with the chicken.  I have tried both the spicy and soy garlic flavor and the chicken is very crisp and nicely infused with these flavors, subtle and not overpowering.  The bulgogi dish here is also very good, and the portions are pretty big.  Thank you for bringing Korean chicken into Hoboken!
2010-10-03,2,Watching football, searched "wings" on yelp and i found this place where the name literally sounds like its a slaughter house.The menu made me think of the tasty korean fried chicken i've tried before.What we got were nicely cooked fried chicken wings that were large and tender. But what was missing was the flavors of soy garlic and spiceyness you see at places like bon chon chicken. This was a total let down. Not to mention it was overpriced. They also don't double fry their chicken here. I thought I had found my answer to NYCs bon chon chicken in hoboken. Which I've actually had dreams about. What I got was flavorless overpriced chicken. I don't see this place being able to charge $20 for a large order of wings if they continue to put out the same The bulgolgi lunch special was so so dry. Basically beef jerky in a sauce. Honestly a very sad display of korean food. Overpriced slop. It went straight into the garbage after one bite.
2010-10-01,3,I'm a fan of their hot wings - crispy on the outside, juicy and meaty inside. The lunch special is a good deal which includes sticky rice, cole slaw, and a soda though the plain white rice could use a sauce or something. They make everything to order which is a good thing but it also takes about 15-20 minutes so order ahead if possible.They have only a few small tables inside (and some techno-oriented pop playing, ecch!) so it might be more suited as a take-out place.
2010-09-23,2,I've been anticipating to go to this place since last week when I found out about this place. I checked out their menu on-line and they had other stuff besides chicken like Bibimbap and bulgoki.I've been to quite a few Korean Fried Chicken spot already so my taste for this type of chicken is not new. Went for Lunch today and we ordered Lrg Wings(mixed), Bibimbap, and Bulgoki. The owners was nice and friendly. The wait was as suggested at 20 minutes or so, as we ate in the store. We got are food, the preparation was nice. Looking at the chicken, it was kind of scrawny and small. There was barely much batter on the chicken and the flavor wasn't there for me. Tried the bibimbap next, it was alright. The spicy sauce was buffalo sauce which I thought should have been like spicy kimchi.  I've eaten better bibimbap before for lower price. And same with the Bulgoki. All in all, I was pretty disappointed. Nice place, nice people, but mediocre food. I've tasted better Korean Fried Chicken and I've been to a lot of different spots.
2010-09-14,5,I had this for lunch today and it was great. The Chicken Meal was good for the price. A coworker had the Bibimbap and said it was delicious too. We ordered the spicy & soy garlic. I like that their spicy was still palatable. It wasn't like other spicy Korean fried chickens that you couldn't eat because it was too spicy. The spicy from Chicken Factory was spot on. The soy garlic was actually not as sweet as other I've had and I prefer it. I will definitely come back and I've already told some friends about it who might be going there for dinner tonight! =D
2010-08-25,5,A-MAZ-ING! We've been Boom Boom lovers for years, but it's not at all convenient. So we've been resolved to eating Bon Chon and Kyo Chon, both of which are very good. But tonight, as we bit into our first drumsticks, we knew that even Boom Boom couldn't compare to this succulent, perfectly spiced chicken. My husband and I shared the large wings/drumsticks, and as we approached the last of the chicken, we both agreed we could eat another whole large order. Of course, we didn't, but we could have...and that's the point. Seriously thanking the Universe for bringing Chicken(s) Factory to our 'hood!!!PROS:Best KFC EVER!Great pricing!Perfect amount of spice on the spicy (at Kyo Chon we cannot enjoy the meal it's so hot!)HUGE, MEATY wings and drumsticks!CONS: We only got one order!!
2010-08-23,4,Korean Fried Chicken in Hoboken?!?! What? Tastes just as good as Bon Chon? You've got to be kidding! I kid not!Chicken Factory in Hoboken serves up their food with more diversity and variety than Bon Chon currently offers. For the chicken, you have the option of 2 different sauces, Soy Garlic and Sweet Spicy and for the chicken you have the option of Wings, Wings and Legs or the Whole Chicken! Yessss the Wholleee chicken. Thighs, legs, and breast.. white meat or dark meat. Not only that but this place serves up some of the more popular korean dishes such as bulgoki, bibimbap, and jab che! All great options that will keep everyone satisfied, not to say that the chicken doesn't do the job but it's always great to have options.I ordered the large whole chicken, mixed with both sauces for $20. I'd say a large order is more than enough for 2 people. With every order you also get a side of their pickled radish and a soda, which is a great way to end the meal. The skin was so crispy and the chicken was also juicy, just the way it should be made! The thighs were definitely the best pieces and the white meat was so-so. It's great that this place is so close to home to, I can stop by practically whenever I feel like it. TIP: Just like Bon Chon, they make their chicken to order and each order takes 20 minutes, so if you plan on eating there or at home, call ahead of time if you don't want to wait!Soy Garlic Chicken:4/5Sweet Spicy Chicken:3.75/5
2010-08-20,5,I love Korean fried chicken, so I was excited to see this place finally open up in Hoboken (it was under construction for most of the summer). Being a lover of the chicken wing, I was nervous about this place, but I was very pleasantly surprised. These wings are delicious. I got the mix of sweet/spicy and soy garlic, both of which I liked very much, but think I prefer the sweet/spicy.Two thumbs up! Finally, a place in Hoboken where the take-out is awesome! I can't wait to try their other food as soon as they begin offering it for dinner (they are serving a limited menu for now).Note that the small size costs $11.99 but it comes with 14 pieces of chicken (I couldn't finish it in one sitting), traditional pickled radishes, and a can of soda. Not too bad of a deal.This place also seems to be a bit better for take-out, as there are only a few tables. And make sure you plan to wait about 20-25 minutes for chicken as they fry it up on the spot for you (or order ahead of time).
2010-08-05,4,Very good but pretty pricey for takeout!We had the bulgoki, bibimbap, and small order of wings. Both flavors are good. The bibimbap is good but they don't give enough vegetables.bulgoki was tasty but the side of coleslaw was almost milky. My only question is why don't they give you any kimchi? It's a korean staple!
2010-08-04,4,Just finished devouring my very first order from Chicken Factory, a Korean-Style fried chicken place in Hoboken.  We normally go all the way up to Fort Lee for this style of double-fried super light and crispy chicken, and it's great that now we have something this good close by.How did they do? They nailed it. the taste, crunch and aroma matched my experience and the better known Bon Chon chicken exactly. We had our order delivered and it still arrived as hot and crisp as I hoped for.   It might seem expensive, but the large order of wings and legs fed my family of four. I hope as their menu grows they add french fries as good as Bon Chon's! Next time? I'm trying the spicy!
2010-07-19,4,I was making a walk of shame around lunch time yesterday.  Halfway home I stumbled across the Chicken Factory.  The menu is not to diverse.  Its just chicken wings and 2 flavors.  I ordered the spicy drumsticks.  While waiting I noticed the place was clean and basic looking.  Not to much going on there for looks.  I get my sticks and finish my walk of shame.  When I got home I dug into the box and on the first bite I was WOW'ed.  even after a 10 min walk they were still crispy.  The flavor was amazing.  I ripped through 7 sticks in about 2 minutes.  Then I was depressed I was out.  I was very tempted to get more or order some more dinner.  Well its been over a day now and I am starting to develop the shakes from not having it again.
2010-07-17,5,Watch out Cluck-U Chicken. Here's the place that's going to put you out of business. Tasty KFC (Korean fried chicken) comes to Hoboken. Top notch flavors and friendly staff round out Hoboken's best chicken wing experience. I think the spicy is better than the soy garlic. In any case, no more waking up in the morning in shame after eating the garbage they serve at Cluck-U. I understand they intend to offer a few Korean food items as well. Looking forward to it.
