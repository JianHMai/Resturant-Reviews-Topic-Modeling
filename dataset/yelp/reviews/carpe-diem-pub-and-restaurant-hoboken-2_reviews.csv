2021-08-21,2,Pictures look way better than food tastes. Friends spoke highly of the place... I had the balls to tell the waiter I think I got the wrong flavor of chicken wings... he assured me they were Buffalo. If that's Buffalo, I don't know what's happening. Asides from food, staff was friendly and I appreciated his positive attitude especially when running between inside and outside in a rain storm. Just wish the food lived up to the hype.
2021-07-29,5,I've been here many times and this is one of my favorite restaurants.  I've had about half of their appetizers, some of the sandwiches and wraps as well as brunch.  Everything has been really good.  The prices are also good and the people who work here are great.
2021-07-03,5,Amazing!!!FOODI got the INCREDIBLE brie burger. Has bacon in it. The bun was a faintly sweet brioche, just how I like it! The brie was all melty on the patty. I ordered medium rare, but I think next time I'd get just medium. It had slightly raw vibes for me. The burgers and sandwiches come with fries which were PERFECTLY fried. My friend's sweet potato fries were incredible too. I usually don't like those but they were done well!I got the St. Germain cocktail which did not disappoint! I wish maybe there were another layer of flavor to the elderflower but it was great nonetheless. My friend got a strawberry margarita which she really enjoyed.MOODInside was SUPER dark so pictures weren't that great :('TUDEFriendly and attentive servers. No complaints. All in their 20s I think.
2021-05-10,5,This is my all time favorite spot in Hoboken for a good burger, a beer, and a friendly, casual atmosphere. It's a no nonsense pub which is hard to find in Hoboken which is very much into the very trendy scene. The staff are so nice and love to just chat and have a good time while you're sitting at the bar. It had been a while since we dined in person because of covid and I'm so glad nothing has changed! Their menu has wine and beer pairings on it for each item so you know what goes best! The bacon and Brie burger is my favorite but I'm also known to get the mini burgers. I ALWAYS sub my fries for their sweet potato fries and famous Moon sauce! Trust me, it's amazing! They're also known for their Buffalo wings and have won awards, you won't be disappointed! They have a dining room with a cozy fireplace or the bar room with a few high top tables and bar seating (my preference). Now that it's nice out, they also have outdoor dining and a streatery across the street under the viaduct! I cannot recommend this place enough!
2021-04-17,1,We sat indoor upstairs. Upstairs is more quiet so that's normally good. However, the music was awful. A mix of Michael a Jackson and Wagon Wheel? Idk what's that's all about. French fries were good/decent. Banana bread beer was good. They gave me a cup full of ice for my magnet cider that was already cold, idk why. The rigatoni vodka pasta was so flavorless, I was so annoyed. I would have preferred store bought vodka sauce at home.
2021-03-18,5,Awesome food and even better service!  Hands down the best Buffalo Wings on the whole dadgum planet!    Can't wait to return to Carpe Diem and throw back some wings and Guinness!
2021-03-15,5,Amazing Buffalo wings! Reasonably priced, strong drinks and good beer selection. A relaxed vibe to get lunch with a group of people
2021-03-09,5,I can't say enough nice things about this restaurant and their delivery service. I might've been there once before Covid, perhaps twice, but during the lockdown we've ordered from them probably 15 times. It is always here quickly it is always hot it is always Incredible. Oh, they are the most polite people on the phone when you are ordering.
2021-02-14,5,On a trip with my daughter, saw pictures of food on maps ,called for reservations, told them 3 pretty girls were starving,they say see you in a few ,arrived in minutes, to be greeted with friendly ppl and food was delicious, service fast and awesome our waiter "D" took very good care of us , very attentive and personable being from Buffalo, I never eat wings anywhere else, but when I saw the trophy,I said I would try next time I visited, we had a great time, portions were good we took a lot back to the hotel!
2021-01-22,5,Big fan of this spot before covid.  Post covid, they still continue to exceed any and all expectations.  They had one of the coolest outdoor setups in Hoboken (under the bridge) and one of the coziest indoor environments near the fire.  The owner and staff are always so kind and accommodating.  Food is VERY good and the wings are INSANE.  Best wings in Hoboken in my opinion!
2021-01-05,5,Love this place.  Cozy dining and bar areas, friendly staff, great food.  Mushroom soup is the best we've had.  Our go-to local spot.
2020-12-06,5,Food at this place is stellar. We got wings and fries, basic pub food but the wings were super juicy and the buffalo sauce was tangy and delicious. The fries were like diner fries and a huge portion. Staff were great too!
2020-11-19,4,Carpe diem wings. What else is there to say? They are hands down the best wings in town (even if you get them delivered!!). The food portions are good, the food is fresh and always delicious. Over the summer they had this super super yummy cocktail list.
2020-11-09,5,Came here for brunch with a few friends last weekend, as this was one of the few places nearby that had an outdoor/patio table available with an awning/covering when we called ahead. Despite the rainy weather, they had heaters set up and it was just overall just a cozy, relaxing place to have some drinks and good food. The menu has a lot of traditional American and Irish pub food, but there are still a lot of different options. I decided to go with the Gourmet Grilled Cheese (which was really good!) and my two friends loved their California Burger and Egg White Omelette as well. Portions were generous, and service was great too.
2020-11-06,3,We used to love Carpe Diem for their burgers, sweet potato fries, beers, and cozy atmosphere. However, we experienced symptoms of food poisoning after eating there, and have not returned. (Normally, I'd rate a place lower for that... but I still miss how tasty the food was.)
2020-11-01,5,Carpe Diem has the best "bar type" food I've had in awhile! They were quick to seat us (on a Saturday night) and our service was quick and friendly! This is definitely a new favorite spot.
2020-10-18,3,Came here for a weekend brunch and drinks . Firstly, service is very good and plenty of seating . Unfortunately they were out of many of the beers I requested on the menu , but it happens . As far as the drinks , Bloody Mary wasn't bad but no olives or celery in it ??? Now on to the food . I was looking forward to it but it was not great . We ordered SW chicken rolls to start which were lukewarm in temp and taste . I ordered a burger with the fries . Burger was average as the meat had no taste but the fries were stellar. My buddy got the breakfast burrito and he ate a little more than half - mediocre as was the burger Overall , there are much better pub food options in Hoboken. I hear a lot of great things about Carpe but today was not one of them
2020-09-20,4,Stopped in yesterday for takeout and our order was ready right on time. It was nice to see how they had the tables set up for outdoor dining. The staff wore masks both indoors and outside.I got the California Burger which was HUGE and perfectly cooked. Really loved the cilantro/jalapeño sauce on it. The fries were perfectly crispy as well.Great option for takeout or outdoor dining if you're in the area.
2020-09-13,5,I'm glad they are open and still serving great food!  Had the buffalo wings and southwest chicken rolls which are still delicious!
2020-09-01,3,This restaurant was alright. The wings are not the tastiest. It tasted like fake chicken. The burger was to meaty. Tasted like balls of grease. The service was amazing tho. Everything is disposable because of the corona virus. They have outside seating. Call ahead to make a reservation!
2020-08-03,5,This place is solid American pub food. There aren't many Irish joints of this caliber in Hoboken.
2020-07-29,5,First time stopping by for dinner during quarantine. Really great food and service! Will definitely have this restaurant now in our regular rotation of places we frequent. Service was awesome, outdoor dining is set up nicely and food portions are generous! Loved everything we ordered wings, California burger, Guinness and watermelon margaritas. Also good to see a nice local crowd vs the out of towners on Washington. Hidden gem we will be back!
2020-07-11,5,The food and service is always beyond belief! Joe & the staff truly make every effort to make you feel at home and at ease. The burgers, wings, salads, specials, and drinks are all wonderful. What they have done during the pandemic should be commended. The food and service has not lost any of the personalized touch it had. Thanks Carpe Diem for always a wonderful experience!!!!
2020-06-25,5,10/10 experience! We had to wait a little bit past our reservation time so they gave us complimentary drinks. For appetizers we ordered the goat cheese bruschetta and it was AMAZING. We also got the coconut shrimp with the sweet chili sauce and it was just as good. For my entree I got the Penne Alla Vodka with shrimp and it was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Service was fast and polite. Highly recommend going!
2020-04-19,5,I've been a huge fan of Carpe Diem since it's inception. It's a great feeling when you step into this hidden gem and the bartender greets you by your first name and knows what your order will be. Carpe has also helped me out with organizing events in their private room upstairs many times. Truly one of the best bars in New Jersey. And the food? Out of this world! Thank you Carpe Diem!
2020-04-18,5,Really good, hearty, tasty pub fare.  We just had a delivery from Carpe Diem for the first time, great food, delivered hot, super efficient delivery - we will be ordering again...
2020-04-12,5,Five stars for this casual, cozy Irish pub. BEST WINGS IN HOBOKEN.I'm very particular with my buffalo sauce. I find that a lot of buffalo sauces are "sweet" buffalo sauces, which is typically not what I prefer. I tend to lean towards the more savory/spicy sauce. Carpe Diem has a sweeter sauce, and I STILL think they're the best wings in Hoboken.As good as the wings are, it's quite the opposite with the fries. The buffalo wings are remarkable, and the fries are remarkably underwhelming. No biggie, plenty of other things on the menu. Plus it's all about the wings.
2020-03-10,1,Went here about 6 months agoVery Generic decor that was trying to be groovy. The rather worn out  Irish Bartender that was in love with himself and appeared to be drunk only talked about  what a great photographer he was and how he hated bartending.. Big turnoff as a customer!! FORGET THIS PLACE
2020-02-14,5,Came here with a couple of piatelli's and was greeted by a pretty good piatelli. Only thing missing was the Toomeyclause. Will definitely be back.
2020-01-18,4,Really solid wing and beer selection. Nice environment w good bar up front and dining area w fire place in the back. Good fish and chips also. I recommend this place on a wintery day, park yourself by the fire place have a couple beers, a couple wings a couple laughs? Movie theater isn't too far a walk from there, maybe 3-4 minutes? You know what, go there, have some wings some beers some laughs and then check out a movie. Let me know how it goes.
2020-01-11,3,Service is left to be desired. The food was okay. The buffalo wings were really good but everything else was just "ehh". They messed up a salad order...twice. So that person ended up not eating because we all had our meals already. Just a miss all around. I would skip this place
2019-12-19,5,A cozy little local watering hole. With great company and even better food. The staff here are very friendly and always welcoming. The usual menu is delicious, but be sure to try their specials as they are tasty switch from the norm. The fireplace in the dining area is the perfect comfy spot in winter. Definitely try the wings!
2019-11-18,5,We ate here this weekend prior to shopping at Trader Joe's. It's a very cozy, Irish pub, despite the Latin name. Service was good and friendly. Our food was good too. I had a turkey sandwich with gravy that was almost like the day after Thanksgiving. My wife had a very good burger with blue cheese and mushrooms.The place is kind of small, but cozy. We sat in the dining area, which had a fireplace for a nice added touch. Prices are not bad at all.
2019-10-26,5,Great little neighborhood bar to catch a game and a Guinness. The bar food is awesome. Wings are amazing. Very simple all around but they just do it right...a new gem in my local rotation.
2019-09-18,5,One of my GOTO spots in Hoboken. Great staff and vibe. Highly recommended as your new 'local'
2019-09-07,5,Eat: pasties (meat and potatoes in a pastry with amazing gravy), wingsGood bar food, good service, and very reasonably priced! What's not to like? Plus, there's not much else in tbe neighborhood. Perfect dinner spot for before or after the movies.
2019-08-15,5,Amazing spot, great food, staff is always super nice, bartenders are always great. Love it. Favorite place for an after work beer!
2019-08-01,4,This is a great spot for casual food. The service is typically on the slower side but they have outside seating where you can relax and have a few drinks. The wings are one of my favorites the salads are also really good. They also have a fun brunch menu!
2019-07-26,5,Wings, steak sandwich with sweet potato fries and the delicious sauce that comes on it are to die for! Me and my boyfriend are always here and we order that every time along with a couple of Guinness's. The atmosphere is great and at night it's a quite romantic setting and perfect for date night! We live it here!
2019-06-16,4,Cute and intimate back room perfect for date night, front bar room is small but quaint. Not too loud unless there's a sports event .... appetizer was good, nicely done in a wine gravy, called pasties (flakey crust with meat inside). Wine and cocktails recommended.
2019-06-02,5,Everything was delicious , fresh and on point. First time here and wasn't disappointed. I would definitely recommend and hope to be back soon. We saw this place after watching a movie in the theatre close by
2019-05-25,5,Food is awesome, great brunch menu. Staff is really nice. There's a room upstairs for private parties. Outdoor seating in the summer.
2019-05-19,5,Best wing spot in town! I never have a bad meal at Carpe. Their outdoor seating makes the experience even better. A bit off the beaten path in Hoboken, but definitely worth a visit!
2019-04-27,5,Great neighborhood bar and surprisingly great food in the quaint attached restaurant.  Great for families or for date night. We have done both there with great results. .
2019-03-14,5,The WINGS! Best wings in Hoboken, hands down. Gem of a joint with great pub feels. Come here after work, especially when the weather is nice to chill outside and sip on some good brew. In a town saturated with pubs, this one stands on its own.
2019-03-06,4,As a vegan, the salad I had was huge!! And good. The entree selection however seems like it could be good from the menu but I had the veggie mash sandwich and the bread was sooo disappointing. Cute place, probably better for bar food. My boyfriend has the burger and was underwhelmed. Very cute atmosphere though!!
2019-02-18,4,One of my go to spots in the area. Their wings taste great. Could have a little more spice to it. But thats just my love for spicy wings. Otherwise they are perfect. The service is great like walking into your friendly bar. They give a lot of food for the price.
2019-02-03,1,If you order wings for the SuperBowl. Plan to sit around and wait for 30 min to an hour past your scheduled pick up, because they're service is terrible. 2 years in a row now, the same thing
2018-12-30,3,Have visited Carpe Diem on a couple of occasions, on a weekday daytime is a great cozy pub. On an evening, the relatively small bar area is transformed into a distractingly, noisy mess with tv screens all over the place. Carpe Diem, is a welcoming pub without the TVs and music during the day. Currently it's almost as if a frat boy moved into their grandparents living room. On a weekend afternoon, a different staff, different atmosphere and loud music "has to be on at this volume, it's one of our rules, sorry." 95 decibels of loud pop music, with five couples or small groups trying to hold a conversation or watch football. Typical bar food was average and bar staff believe they "have no amber beers." Have ordered wings from here before and they were excellent. Not sure why there isn't a comfortable, welcoming, relaxing bar in Hoboken. Being a shouty, loud fratboy-focused TV space doesn't appeal to me sadly.
2018-11-14,5,Love Carpe Diem! Fun and trendy vibe going on with good food. It can get pretty crowded so you might want to plan for a wait if you're here for food. Would recommend for a few friends or a casual date with good eats and drinks!
2018-11-12,5,Cozy but lively neighborhood pub with the best wings in Hoboken. Their buffalo sauce is crack. A bit off the beaten path, so it attracts the more mature uptown Hoboken clientele unlike some of the fratty sports bars that line Washington St. Bartenders and servers are always friendly and make you feel welcome. I love the decor inside - walls are filled with portraits of every American icon imaginable and there is a fireplace inside the dining room. Living a block away, I find myself here about 1-2 times a week. Some of my other menu favorites are the Southwest egg rolls, Katie's Way sandwich and, randomly, their chicken noodle soup.  Solid menu and beer list with lots of different options, but really wish they had nachos!
2018-11-11,5,Great local bar. And while most "bars" in Hoboken inevitably flip over into a club or a sports bar, this place keeps true to its identity all hours. Above average if not great food, good beers, wine selection etc. A bit off the beaten path but that's why this place works well. Thursday is half price bottles of wine. Pair that with the rigatoni vodka.
2018-11-08,5,I love Carpe Diem. Don't come here though because i want to keep the population down and always want a seat at the bar.
2018-11-04,5,This might be the happiest review I've ever written for a restaurant. My partner and I are obsessed with their Brunch menu (might be only available on weekends). We honestly love their black pudding. We've been to Ireland and that's where our black pudding love began and I think this place does a pretty good job of meeting expectations for black pudding. I absolutely love white pudding as well, but I'd say their white pudding is a little lacking. But don't worry, their food is still amazing. I love their Irish breakfast and my partner really enjoyed their steak and eggs. We've been looking for a good breakfast spot in a long time and we're happy that we've found this place. We're a little bummed that brunch doesn't start until 11, but honestly super worth the wait!! We were there yesterday and plan on coming back today just for their food. I will say that their service could be a little better, but there's this woman who is amazing server (don't know her name but wears a dark lip and has short hair maybe?). If you're not bothered by finding the service, then this place is for you. We seriously love the brunch menu!!
2018-10-28,4,High end bar food in a great spot. As everyone says, incredible wings and the food is above average. Bar is a great spot to chill too.
2018-10-10,5,Been here twice, and the staff we encountered were extremely friendly.  In addition, the food tasted great as well.  Our favorite was the steak tip appetizer, which is delicious.  Only knock I have on them is that they charged me a dollar when I asked for some bread to dip into the sauce that came with the steak tips.
2018-09-24,5,Great "higher end" pub fare.  Service was great.  Food was great.  Crowd was fun.  Small bar but still plenty of televisions for sports.  Seating also available in back (a couple TVs as well) and outside.  I wish I had more specifics, will update review with pictures next visit.  We had burgers, "pasties" (essentially mini beef pies in puff pastry brown gravy) south west rolls, wings (phenomenal wings), it was all good.  Very clean inside as well.  I hate sticky tables or bars, this place has none.  They also did a ton, absolute ton of take out orders so I'm sure the word is out on the menu.  Thankful for places who still care about the food quality.
2018-08-25,5,Came here on a Saturday night after catching a 730 Crazy Rich Asians at Bowtie. It's a pretty and cozy space with a huge beer menu as well as signature cocktails and good wines. The classic burger was excellent, with a lovely soft bun and hot crisp fries and the chicken fingers were pounded thin and fried great. It's also cheap. Will definitely be back but you get what you pay for and more.
2018-08-16,5,Great food and great service. Guinness is highly recommended. Always a fun and chill night in Hoboken at carpe.
2018-06-05,5,Arrived 7pm with our 2 grand kidsSat outside - beautiful eveningService was excellentFood arrived quicklyVery nice experience
2018-05-05,2,The food here is good, but the service is phenomenally bad. The waitress takes 20 minutes between visits to the table and is the sole reason we will never come back here. We waited 20 minutes just to put in our drink order. Then, after waiting for 30 minutes for our appetizers, she didn't even ask us if we wanted to order our main course and we had to go inside to hunt someone else down just so we could order. We were told the girl "went upstairs". The people who sat behind us came after us and ordered, ate, and LEFT before we even started our main course. I wrote this review while sitting at the table because that's how astoundingly horrible this experience has been.
2018-04-15,3,I've been here before for drinks but my friends and I heard the food was good and finally got a chance to eat here for dinner last night. It was the first 70+ degree weekend day this year so of course it was busy. We were super underwhelmed by the food and the service seemed to be a bit understaffed. Our burgers were ordered medium rare and they came out more like medium well. The French fries were yummy though! It took forever to get anything including our drinks and we were pretty let down. We've decided to go back again on a less busy day to give a fair chance, as the reputation of the place is so good, but hoping that won't be sub par as well! Also we were charged extra for asking for sides of mayo.
2018-03-31,5,We were pleased! Sums up EVERYTHING lol . I ordered the chicken blt and my boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich, and we have no complaints! The appetizer was soooo good, i rarely eat red meat these days but for some reason the spicy steak stood out to me. Dont be afraid to dip your bread in the sauce, it brings out the flavor in the bread! We shared the appetizers.  I saw alot fo buffalo wings being ordered, so Ill probably try them next time.We came a little early because after a certain time the restaurants and bars in Hoboken  get packed and I didn't want to deal with that.  We walked in and was seated right away. They had a nice fireplace in the dining room, added to the ambience. The wait staff was on point, she refilled my water, without asking. She brought anything i needed quickly! I mean, what more can i ask for! We will be back!
2018-03-27,4,Carpe Diem is a great spot for folks living in uptown Hoboken.  It's not too big and has a nice, cozy ambiance with a fireplace in the back. Believe it or not, their pasta dishes are great.  Their rigatoni alla vodka is SO good - way better than some of the Italian restaurants in town I've ordered take-out from and cheaper for a healthy portion!  I recommend it with chicken added.  I've also ordered a bolognese pasta that was on their specials menu one night and that was equally good.  It's a good local gem to just grab a few drinks at the bar too.
2018-02-26,5,Somewhat of a hidden gem in Hoboken if that term is possible. Really good and quality beer selection. The option to sit by a fire is pretty cool as well. Rugby and soccer dominate the tvs if the games are on and it doesn't feel like hoboken (in a good way)
2018-02-05,4,My friend and I had finished watching a movie at the theater catty-corner from the Hoboken classic, Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant, and she suggested that we head there for a drink.  I told her that I had actually not eaten dinner, so I was much more in need of some food.  She then mentioned that she had eaten at Carpe Diem in the past and that it was pretty decent.  The place had been there for years, but I had only once briefly stepped inside, found a non-descript pub, and walked out.  I had made a mistake, judging the book by its cover, because when she took me in there, I was introduced to their adorable dining room that laid just beyond the standard bar.  There was a burning fireplace in the corner; and red velvet curtains enhanced the romantic feel in this room of simple wooden tables.  Despite my hunger, I ordered a drink before I made my food selection.  The Apple Cider Negroni sure was seasonal, but it had such a sweet and artificial fruit flavor that I could not drink it.  I was finally able to flag down our server and replace the offensive cocktail with a lively glass of Monforte Prosecco from Veneto, Italy.  The sparkling wine was not too dry nor too sweet and had an essence of ripe pear flavor.  My friend ordered a Boozy Hot Chocolate, which was covered in mini marshmallows and looked like a great treat, but was over-priced at $13 for a meager mug.  The dinner menu at this "Irish" pub actually offered a cross-continental sampling, with everything from a predictable shepherd's pie to hefty hamburgers to even chicken stir-fry and penne alla vodka!  It was already later in the evening, so I wanted something light and opted for a large bowl of their Homemade Chicken Soup.  The broth had the ideal amount of salt and onion flavor, as well as a massive helping of white meat chicken chunks, carrots, and celery.  Though I had the option to incorporate rice into the dish, I kept it carb- and gluten-free, saving room in my belly for the high-quality poultry instead.  This hearty soup was perfect for the cold evening and something for which I would exclusively venture to the restaurant, helping me upgrade my rating from 3.5 to 4 stars.Don't let Carpe Diem's uninspiring facade fool you, this pub has been continually successful because of their terrific food and neighborhood feel.  It also acts as a jovial place to catch up with a companion after a few hours of sitting in silence at the movies!
2018-02-01,3,I heard great things about this place, but the food leaves a lot to be desired. I got the steak sandwich and it might've been the worst steak sandwich I've ever had. I ordered it medium rare, it was like chewing a tire, the bread was soggy not toasted, the sauce wasn't sauce. Just didn't seem like any effort went into the food. It also took over an hour to get it. The fact that this place has over a 4 is pretty surprising.
2017-12-02,4,The buns for the burger is tooooooooo big. Can we have thinner and more crispy, hotter buns??? The patty is so small compared to those two fat huge buns...... good restaurant and service in general!!
2017-11-25,5,Came up from Florida to see family. Wanted to go to a "Real" Irish Pub !! David the bartender ( real deal Irishmen) outstanding service. Food was excellent and prices fair. Highly​  recommend. Bar is clean and atomsphere is quite friendly.
2017-10-29,4,cozy spot. food is good. prices are good. staff is usually friendly.
2017-10-10,5,Love love!! Everything I've had taste all good! Best wings just wish they were kosher or halal then I could invite my friend to experience this yummy wings
2017-08-02,3,This review is based on a very limited experience as I had about 40 minutes to kill before a meeting nearby. I sat at bar and service was as good as expected. This is clearly a neighborhood bar and the locals (which ranged from residents to construction workers) were graciously welcomed with their regular drink. My gin and tonic didn't seem right, not sure why, but was assured it was my regular gin. Who knows... anyway The curiosity to me however was the wings. There was a trophy as apparently these were best wings in. Hoboken. Who doesn't want to try the best!?!?!  They were good indeed, but the best? I'm not sure how they are judged but my guess is they won for being simple. The wings were average in size, but cooked perfectly. The meat easily pulled from the bone and they had the right amount of crisp. The sauce was more or less traditional, maybe medium. There was a touch of sweetness to the sauce which might be the only innovative thing about them. Not too messy. Trophy? These are just typical wings done well. I'm guessing hoboken is esteemed for other things besides wings so the competition may not have been too fierce. I wish the trophy was never mentioned so I could have just enjoyed a really good wing without pretense or rumination.
2017-07-29,5,We stopped in just before our movie at Bow Tie Cinemas started and it was the right call. Happy hour was going on until 8 so we had 30 minutes to enjoy $5 house wines and $4 wells. Bartender was super friendly and conversational. The bartender couldn't be better, which I think helps set the tone for the whole pub. I also loved the old photos of celebrities everywhere, added a very nice charm to the place. Everyone was casual, friendly. We also enjoyed the $5 appetizers (popcorn chicken) and just the overall vibe of the pub was perfect. When it was time to check out there was no long waiting for the check. I pray the place never changes its character. Perfect way to start off the weekend. Hubby and I will be back!
2017-07-08,1,I went here for lunch today and will never be going back. I would rate this restaurant a zero if I could because that would describe the personalities of the waitstaff here. The service is terrible, the waitstaff is miserable, and the food is not even that great. Today for lunch, we placed an order of wings, a salad, and a chicken sandwich. The wings took about 30 minutes to come out and then we proceeded to wait another 30 minutes before asking on the food status and were told it will take, "a few more minutes."  Meanwhile, a family of 6 came in and were already served their food while we continued to wait. No explanation was given, no apologies, nothing. 15 more minutes passed and we finally just got up, found the waitress, and asked for the check because we were leaving. The waitress then brought the check over without saying one word and then disappeared into the kitchen.  No words were even spoken, not even a simple, "i'm sorry about that." Just scurried away to hide in the kitchen. I guess if I had no personality and was a miserable person I would just hide as well...Oh well, no loss for me. There are plenty of excellent restaurants in Hoboken that I will be spending my money at and this is NOT one of them.
2017-07-08,1,This place has always been a dump inside, but it's a neighborhood bar and I liked the wings...at least I used to like the wings.  Went in today for lunch, and after waiting 30 mins for wings, they come out and are over cooked, with not much meat on the bone.  Sauce still good, but the chicken was garbage. But that's not even what I'm upset about, they get the one star because the service was HORRENDOUS.  Absolutely AWFUL. Waitress took our order and then disappeared to the back somewhere.  The 2nd waitress that took over had the personality of wet sock.  Looked like she was miserable and was not at all interested in serving my fiance or I.  Asked for water, got a nice glass of warm water, no ice....mmmm. I didn't complain or say a word until the time started adding up. After another 20 mins we start asking what's taking so long.  There was a party going on in the upstairs room.  I assume that this may be the issue, the kitchen is busy etc.  Nobody says a word, I'm just guessing that this may be factoring in, and I'm sure if they read this review that would be their excuse.  However, this idea goes out the window due to the fact that a party of 6 that walked in 20 minutes after us were served their food. Ask about our food again, told it will be a few minutes (my fiancé ordered a salad!) I finally had to demand my check so I could pay for the terrible wings they brought and leave.  I don't know who the manager was, I let the bartender know (who had nothing to do with this) that we weren't happy on the way out. Long story short: It's a dump, food is going down hill, and the SERVICE WAS HORRENDOUS.  Had an hour wait (for a salad and a chicken mozz sandwich) and only received the appetizer..with no explanation and ZERO customer service. You can not hire people like this and expect people in the neighborhood to give you repeat business. I will never ever go back. However, If you like to be treated like sh!t and potentially never be served your meal then this is the place for you.
2017-05-15,2,I like this place. The wings are amazing and the drink specials are great! This review is all about one horrible server. The guy who was a shit server at Elysian and we were glad to be rid of him but then he resurfaced here. I honestly want to punch him in the face. He's so bad and so snobby. He has literally WALKED AWAY while we were talking to him because I guess he got bored or had something else to do. Sorry if we weren't ordering fast enough for your liking. He's infuriating and I cannot believe he's working at another one of my favorite places and have to see him again!!
2017-05-10,4,We stopped in for lunch, were able to sit outside, and had a very enjoyable meal.It was a great day so we snagged an outdoor table and had a wonderful lunch. Our food (I had the club sandwich - solid!) was prepared and delivered rapidly and our waitress was very friendly.Additionally, we've been here for drinks on a few random occasions (once in the reservable room upstairs) and every time we've had a good time.For just drinks or an entire meal you cannot go wrong here. We'd certainly return in the future.
2017-04-12,1,Walked in once... it smelled like old prom vomit & sweat.... walked out. (The poor lighting and tattered decor didn't help either)
2017-04-04,5,Good service better food. Really good quality bar bites. Only had the appetizers but highly recommend the mushroom pastie i think it was called.
2017-03-31,4,Wings wings wings! The best wings in hoboken hands down. They don't have a list a mile long of sauces and they don't have anything fancy - just some solid simple and delicious buffalo wings. They might have BBQ too but I'm a sucker for the buffalo. The drinks are also great - the bartenders know what they're doing that's for sure. The service is also good with a consistent wait staff who are genuine and down to earth so even if things take a little longer I don't mind. The atmosphere is also unique to other bars and gives more of a locals feel but without being a dive bar. Living in hoboken for 8 years, truly good bars are hard to come by but thankfully this is one of them.
2017-03-22,5,Went for DinnerFood - 5/5. The coconut shrimp has huge flakes of coconut that give flavor and crispy bites. The shrimp itself has the perfect shrimp texture and goes really well with the sweet chili sauce. Southwest Chicken Rolls are probably the best thing on their menu that everyone should try when they visit! The amazing blend of chicken, southwest vegetables, beans and cheese wrapped in a fried thick egg roll skin dipped into the zingy chipotle mayo is the most wonderful western-style egg roll experience. Everyone should get their own!Service - 4/5. The staff here are friendly and easy to speak to; the kind of staff you want at a bar!Value - 5/5. The price is pretty above average in all fairness but the food is absolutely delicious and well worth the price. The menu has a good variety of options but the southwest chicken rolls alone are a good enough reason to visit.Parking - Street (Metered)
2017-02-16,5,love everything about CD! We have been going for many years and never dissatisfied. We have even rented the private upstairs space for a special party and the owner and staff were amazing! There has been a lot of staff turnover in the past few years, as well as more families with kids that dine-in. Still, we go to Carpe once a week for great food, drink, and ambiance.
2017-02-08,4,When I first got there service was a 3 out of 5 but by the end they totally redeemed themselves. I was by myself, sat at the bar. Since I've been back in Jersey these were the best wings I've had in a while! Texture and crispness was on point without being too dry. Great flavor, just enough spice (buffalo). Even the veggies that the wings come with very very crisp and fresh. Sometimes you get those garbage veggies that have been cut for days and you aren't sure how it's all going to end up. Blue cheese dressing also seemed to be homemade. That was a plus. Pretty decent drink selection and the bartender doesn't make things too sweet or too strong.I was very happy overall and now that I know this little hole in the wall is there I will definitely be back and I'm sure bring some people if I ever make any friends on the east coast. Haha!
2017-02-04,3,Best wings in hoboken? Not so much. As an avid wing guy I expected better after hearing they had "the best wings in hoboken". Gave them a second try and was not impressed for a second time. Will keep looking for a go to wing spot.
2017-01-11,5,Best wings I've ever had! From the city but travel to Carpe Diem for their wings. Always consistent and always the best! Started with the buffalo then switched it up to honey BBQ our first visit. Then our next visit we tried the Sweet Thai chili. Amazing! We never no what flavor to get so now we just get them all and there is never left overs. Along with the wings, all their food is just superb. The burger I think it was Clair's Fave on the menu cooked to perfection; Med rear. Perfect. Bill is amazing! The best mixologist and our glasses were never empty! Always had water, napkins, our sauces; everything. My go to place. Service is always stellar, food is always perfect, atmosphere is cozy and romantic and they cater to my sport loving boyfriend. Simply perfection. Thankyou!
2016-12-23,5,I absolutely love this bar. The food is great (best wings in Hoboken - as advertised and the sweet potato fries are fantastic`), the bar staff is incredibly friendly and welcoming. It has a comfortable vibe (better than a dive, but not as pretentious as an "upscale" bar) and fills up nicely after happy hour with a friendly, local crowd. The restaurant area has a great fireplace with comfortable chairs for a date and plenty of seating. If you are a soccer or golf fan, this is the place to be on the weekend. Multiple TVs so you can watch all the action and the bartenders are more than willing to put the volume on for whatever game you're into. Sundays always have the final round of the golf tournament with volume, which is rare. This is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken.
2016-12-19,4,Fun place, but can get really crowded around the bar.  We sat at a table near the bar, haven't tried the restaurant area with the fireplace yet.  But it's good for a drink and appetizer after seeing a movie down the block.
2016-11-25,3,Downtown hoboken resident for many years so when we see a movie we usually hit up beer garden but will go here instead once in a while. Wings are solid and wine and beer are too. I wouldn't ever get a burger here however with so many other places in hoboken that are SO MUCH BETTER. Yes it was Cooked medium rare like I asked not not juicy at all! So either it's frozen or horrible beef. Yuck. Bacon didn't even make up for it. Everyone who eats a burger knows if you get it medium rare, juices drip off of it. Nope- dry as could be. Never again!
2016-11-08,5,Tried this pace because it's across the street from the lodging I have here in Hoboken, SO GLAD I did .   Service was spot on and my pear salad with pecans, goat cheese and shrimp was excellent.   The Malbec I had was an excellent addition   I will be back!
2016-09-29,5,Wings are the best in Hoboken and Burger is on point. Make sure you get there early to get a spot at the bar as it is small and fills up quickly.
2016-09-10,5,I've only ever sat at the bar here. The service is prompt and friendly. The wings, you must get the wings! Drinks are good and reasonably priced. Quaint local spot.
2016-09-09,5,Love it here. Food is always consistently good and is a great place to grab dinner before a movie right across the street !
2016-07-20,5,My girlfriend lives in Hoboken so each weekend we go out to dinner and try new places all the time, we keep coming back to Carpe Diem. It's the best bar in Hoboken, off the busy path in town, real neighborhood feel where the staff knows all the regulars and treat new guests like they've been going their for years. From the burgers, to the apps, the happy hour menu is fabulous. Also have the best wings in New Jersey, in a state where it's hard to find a good wing, they fry them then finish them on grill for a charred flavor. Love this bar and will continue to go back.
2016-07-19,5,After reading some Yelp reviews I decided to try this place. A great little neighborhood bar with homemade bar bites. I had mozzarella bites, chicken fingers and burger slides. All three were very good and definitely cooked to order! I loved the food so much I decided to visit again this week for a late night snack. This time we got buffalo chicken slides with French fries!!! I enjoy very much with a big glass of wine. The service was very well and I will be returning soon!
2016-05-30,5,An absolute hidden gem. The food here never disappoints. My personal favorite is the veggie burger (I'm not a vegetarian) and sweet potato fries. They make it from scratch.  Since it's off the beaten path, it's never too crowded. The bartenders are great so it's always fun to sit at the bar and have a few drinks. P.s. The wings are the best I have ever had. The sauce is perfect.
2016-05-20,1,I don't write low star reviews very often but really felt the need for one here. The place has a nice atmosphere and service is good but the food is just not thereWe ordered the steak tips and they came out swimming in a soup of sweet soy sauce. Then I had the goats cheese bruschetta. Given the name, I was surprised that I really had to search for the goats cheese. It was a small smear in the middle and then covered in bruschetta. The tomato and onion mixture on top I would estimate was at least two weeks old. Bad. Nothing else to say. And $8 or soThen my daughter had the fish and chips. Now they do say the chips are cut thin but I expected something akin to McDonald's fries - not potato chips like lays. And then the fish we received should have been tossed as it was over cook and far too darkWe wanted to like this place. It is always popular but based on tonight, we won't be back
2016-05-03,4,Lovely and cozy pub/restaurant uptown Hoboken. Very good food and great selection of beers. Jalapeños poppers are a must! Bill the bartender is so nice and friendly! Always a great time!
2016-04-30,3,I ate here with a group of 5 today. The space is great and the food was tasty but the service was pretty terrible. The waitress was short with us the entire time. Just felt like she was giving us the cold shoulder. I don't expect her to be our best friend but at least make us feel welcome. Also the runner who brought us food mixed up the orders. Also they asked me how I wanted my burger cooked. I said medium but it was super well done. My friend asked for medium rare and had the same over cooked burger. I am not picky at all so I just ate it, but what's the point of asking if you're not gonna follow through? Meh
2016-04-28,5,absolutely amazing. our server Danielle was great, informative, and super sweet. and don't get my let started on the food!!! AH-maz-ing. will def be back and highly recommend it. great deals, food and drinks! I'm so upset I've lived in Hoboken for 25 years and I just came for the first time today.
2016-04-28,4,The food is delicious, the atmosphere is very laid back and relaxing, while still being social and entertaining, and the service is great (especially with Danielle)! Highly recommend trying this place out, especially on a Thursday night because they have half price bottles of wine and $5 apps until 8pm! Come and visit:)
2016-04-28,5,The food was excellent. The service was excellent. Danielle took care of us all night. I will be back!
2016-04-26,4,Very small restaurant. Food was excellent. Had the best appetizer ever called Pasties (basically mini shepherd pies). Drinks that we ordered were not good at all though. Next time..definitely going to stick with beer or wine.
2016-04-26,5,Great bar to have a few drinks and some delicious food.  They have a good variety of specials that they cycle through.  The bar area itself isn't very big so if you are looking to watch a game with a large group, don't expect everyone to be able to find a seat.  They do have a back area for dining and an upstairs for private parties. When the weather is nice, there is a decent sized patio to eat outside.  This place makes the best non-buffalo sauced wing in Hoboken.  The bartenders and staff are all friendly and engaging.   Overall a good place to go if you are looking for a calmer setting than most bars on Washington Street.
2016-04-23,5,Chicken wings were not what I was expecting for regular buffalo wings but we're so much better! It was a little sweeter likeThai or honey wings but delicious! The server was so friendly too.. Great place!
2016-04-22,4,Great place to host a party in Hoboken. I researched and called a bunch of places to see what their options were for private parties. Carpe Diem was DEFINITELY the best choice out of all of them. They have an upstairs section that you can book for a private party as long as you have at least 30 people participating. We opted for an open bar, which was a per person cost ($30) for anything that's not top shelf. You pay at the bar for a wristband from the bartender. Also, we get the bartender all to ourselves as it's a private bar for the upstairs room - no having to wait for drinks! :) The bartender was super attentive and also very helpful when it came to taking out and preparing the cake, hooking up our music (you can bring an ipod or phone to hook up with their aux cable and play your own music on the speakers in the room?), etc. Those who didn't want to do open bar could still pay for individual drinks (no wristband) and be at the party (but you need 30 people participating in open bar to book the room at all). You could also opt in for a food package for the party, but we chose to just order our own food individually if anyone wanted to.When speaking to the management on the phone, they were super thorough and helpful when it came to how to set up the party, since it was a surprise. You can tell them how you're planning on doing the surprise, and they'll follow along the plan so it all seems natural. It was all executed perfectly.I've also been here just to grab a couple drinks before at the downstairs bar. It doesn't seem to get too crowded. It's a small-ish place in uptown Hoboken and most bars/people are downtown, so it's not the location easiest to get to if you don't live uptown, but when you're there, very easy to get drinks at the bar and you'll enjoy a chill vibe here. It looked like they have regulars who come by often and know the staff/bartenders. A casual, cool place.Great management and staff. Very happy with my experience here.
2016-03-14,4,A night out exploring and we ended up here because someone had told us they had some amazing burgers,  anddddd they were right. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and with sweet potato fries and my friend got a classic burger with some veggies. The burger was really good, the meat was a big and cook nicely,  the bacon and cheese was also of a good ratio. The sweet potato fries could have some improvements. They were soggy and I had wished them to be as crispy as their regular fries (which were wayyy better).The classic burger was also huge and the veggies  gave it a very fresh taste. I will definitely be back for more!
2016-02-22,5,I can rarely say this about an establishment, but please, never change :)I enjoy your food, your drinks, your choice of music and most of all the fact that I get the same quality food, drinks and music every time I go to Carpe Diem. The taste of my favorite dishes is always the same, and that's a good thing, because they are excellent. The cocktails are always superb. So far I've never been disappointed once by going there. Thank you for that, and I hope it lasts.
2016-02-14,1,0 stars if possible!!!!!!!!!! Came here on Valentine's Day with my best friend. First I understand that it is a busy day for the restaurant as the place was packed. However, our waitress was no where to be found the whole time. Our food took over 50 minutes to come as we watched other tables get their food when they sat down after us (we ordered 2 apps and 2 entrees). After 50 minutes of waiting, our food arrives where she brought the 2 apps out with our entrees. Then as we proceeded to try to tuna tartare with the cheesy bread, the bread was basically a frozen. Most of our food was cold and she actually put in the wrong order for one of the entrees. Can't even put into words how appalled I am by the service I received here tonight.
2016-02-11,4,Went here for a Friday night dinner with the husband. I definitely vibed the scene they were putting down. It was the perfect mix of young singles and young families. I don't know who was running the music but I was jamming to the mix of oldies the entire time. We got the goat cheese bruschetta to start and it was AMAZING! I would go back just to have it again. It this balsamic glaze that had the perfect tang with the goat cheese to just complete the taste. That being said I was super disappointed with my steak sandwich. There was just NOTHING going on. It was slim picking as far as the steak portion goes and I was overwhelmed by all of the extra bread. The ratio of bread to everything else just ruined entree for me. I will definitely go back and give other things a try. The atmosphere, the drinks, the appetizer, it definitely deserves another shot at dinner.
2016-02-03,5,Hands down my favorite bar in hoboken! The food is wonderful. Their Wings are award winning, fish and chips are great, and if your lucky enough to come in when they have the lamb special ORDER IT! The drinks are also good they have fun mixed drinks as well as a large beer selection. I also have to give credit to nick (you can find behind the bar most nights) he's so friendly and outgoing definitely makes the night more entertaining! If i could of given 10 stars i would have, love it here!
2016-01-12,5,Best restaurant/bar in Hoboken. The food is always amazing and it has a great atmosphere. This wings are the best in Hoboken and the Katie's Way opened face sandwich is my recommendation. I've recommended this place to all of my friends and they all love it. This is a must go to for anyone in Hoboken.
2016-01-03,5,This place is definitely under rated! Easily my favorite hang out in Hoboken. Low key, friendly pub atmosphere. The food has never disappointed! They serve pub food and bar fare. I usually get sweet potato fries when the option is available, but here I always go for the regular fries. The sweet potato fries are good here, but there is something about the regular fries that seal the deal.Great place to come and watch a game or hang out and chat with friends. They don't crank the music so loud that you can't hear anyone, like most of the other bars in Hoboken. The drinks are regular Hoboken prices, and are pretty standard. They have a couple decent beers on tap, some craft brews, and all your standards.Literally everything you could want in a bar.
2015-12-30,4,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken! Cozy and great service with a nice beer selection.
2015-12-30,5,Carpe Diem is my new favorite bar in Hoboken. Great food, wonderful service, and cozy atmosphere! Will be returning!
2015-12-18,4,A lovely retreat from the brunch and bro madness in Hoboken. Carpe Diem is located in a northern nook of town. It has plenty of TVs, so it's good enough to be a sports bar. It can please the foodies and has enough beer options to keep most recreational drinkers happy. The spicy steak bites are great to nosh on as you wait for the real good stuff. The Kate's Way and the Claire's Fave are both delicious. The Fave uses fine ground beef to make a succulent burger. The Way drapes bacon and turkey in gravy. The only quibbles are that the beer selection is limited if you're a beer nerd. Still, make this a must-consider place if you're ever in Hoboken and in need of a good meal.
2015-12-14,5,This is by far my favorite bar in Hoboken. Why you ask? Because it's just a bar, being a bar with great bartenders, good food and an actual pub like atmosphere. To be honest, this is where grown ups go to have fun.Sure, there is always a time for the 3 different Black Bears downtown but that time has past for me. And Carpe delivers a good time without the Ho-bro-ken scene. Every time I come here I always say "I don't come here enough". This is a great place to sit down, have a drink with friends or strangers, you'll always wind up striking up a conversation with someone, whether you know them or not, and that is why it gets my vote for the best bar in Hoboken. I have to give a shout out to Nick behind the bar, he is also probably the best bartender in town. He remembers you, talks to you and makes you feel at home, whether it's your first or 100th time in. The food is also pretty damn good, I've had burgers, wings, chicken sandwich and a bunch of the happy hour apps. I haven't had anything bad. I love their wing sauce, but prefer it on the buffalo sandwich over the wings. I like carbs, don't judge. The happy hour is also great because it goes til 8pm Monday-Friday. If I had to pick I'd say the popcorn chicken and spicy egg rolls are my favorite happy hour apps. They have a pretty good beer selection, but I do miss Yards on tap.This is a simple but great neighborhood bar that is always worth a visit.
2015-12-12,4,Perfect place (small yet warm & intimate with a fire place) for a really good pub grub type of meal for couples.  Hidden away in the back of Hoboken it has been a neighborhood gem for locals for many years.  Many people will eat here before and after viewing a movie at Hoboken Cinemas across the street.  A favorite restaurant/bar stop of mine.
2015-12-12,5,Great atmosphere! Food was awesome, had the chili wings, and short ribs. My boyfriend had the shepherds pie which was also great. Love that the menu pairs theropod with suggested wine and beer.
2015-12-04,5,Hands down the best restaurant in Hoboken. Carpe Diem is a little off the beaten path but it is well worth the walk! To start off with the service, the servers/bartenders are always extremely friendly and offer up great suggestions for food or wine. Their standard menu is incredible but they still manage to impress with the daily specials. My personal favorite is the Katie's Way Sandwich, but their burgers are not to be missed either!In addition to their fantastic food and service, they offer some really well priced happy hour specials and half priced bottles of wine on Thursdays I believe (it might be Wednesday so definitely call to check).They also a great venue for medium sized parties. They offer the option to rent out their upstairs room for a very affordable price. All you have to do is put down a refundable deposit and they offer a 3 hour open bar for a great rate! We've had a few parties here in the past and they are always a hit!
2015-11-13,1,Disappointed. Never got a chance to try the food. This review is for not updating their web page with accurate business hours. I work nights locally. A coworker and I wanted to order food. Both Carpe Diem website and Yelp says this place is open until 3am on Friday nights! When I call to place an order I'm told they close at 11pm! WTH??? Fix your webpage!
2015-10-25,4,Love this place! Super cute ambiance and great food. I love menu and how it pairs with beer/wine! Genius. A staple in our go-to restaurants!
2015-10-10,5,Came back to carpe diem after a few years.....the happy hour appetizers were amazing. We had the popcorn chicken, Shepards pie, spicy chicken wraps, and the amazing steak bites. Food was great and service great. Will definitely be going back more often.
2015-10-08,5,Gotta thank Yelp for giving me the inside scoop on this place. I've been looking for somewhere to go in Hoboken that isn't a total bro-fest, and this place is it. I came here on a football Sunday to catch the 4 o'clock games and it did not disappoint. For starters, the atmosphere is very warm and cozy. You feel right at home, next to the small yet intimate bar area. There's plenty of TVs to catch any game you're looking for and the people there get into the spirit of things and it encourages you to get into it too. Secondly, they have a great variety of beers to choose from. They even have little notes on each beer to give you an idea of its flavor profile. Huge plus for me, since I really only like a few types of beers. Thirdly, and certainly not the least important, the food was amazing. This is the farthest from your average bar food. I ordered the California burger expecting your average, run-of-the-mill chuck but it had a ton of flavor and was perfectly cooked. If you're going to stop by for a game, come hungry!Overall, if you're tired of the average bar scene and are looking for a place to have fun with a good crowd, this place seems to be it.I still have yet to come here on a Friday/Saturday night, but if it's anything like it is during the day, I'm sure it's a great time.P.S. - Danielle is an awesome server and made the experience that much more enjoyable!
2015-10-07,4,Decided to check this place out before my movie (right across the street, super convenient location). We got there around 8:30 and it was packed so I suggest giving yourself some time if you're also catching a movie. Great food & ambience, we got spicy steak bites and fresh mozzarella which were both so tasty. Spicy Steak bites are spicy and they do have jalapenos in the dish, and not the pickled ones! So it does have a kick but it's not overwhelming. I will definitely be going back again!
2015-09-25,5,Omg. Best. Happy. Hour. Ever.  $5 apps which are HUGE and delicious (see pics). Will def be coming back for HH. Great food, great selection of beers and wines.
2015-09-21,4,Probably my favorite low key spot in Hoboken. The wings are out of this world  (and gluten free!). So many cider options (rare finds like Pear Magners). Great for football Sundays or a casual dinner date night.
2015-09-14,5,Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. Food was excellent, the quality of the happy hour food was superb! If I could take this place to LA, I would! Jim our bartender! Top notch! Looking for good, affordable, food, with GREAT service.. Look no further than Carpe Diem!!! This place is a hidden gem in New Jersey! I recommend there CHICKEN WINGS & SPICY CHICKEN ROLLS!
2015-09-13,4,Terrific service, food and ambience. The first time my wife had the risotto and I ordered a shrimp salad, both were freshly made and a delicious. Since then we have tried their vegetable burger, chicken sandwich, salad and soup, each time the order was consistent in terms of quality. Another reason we appreciate the service is because once we forgot our son's jacket, couple of days later we were walking by, the staff recognized us and handed over the jacket. Such personal attention is impressive. Tip for next time, try to visit on Thursdays when they offer half off wine bottles. Only suggestion, if possible could the area outside be completely smoke free? Since we come here with our 9 month old, we would appreciate if the customers are requested to move further from the dining area when smoking.
2015-09-11,5,We love this place. The food is incredible, and the ambience is comfortable and cozy. It feels like you're eating in someone's home that makes killer appetizers and burgers. The Mon-Fri Happy Hour appetizer and drink specials are great, especially the Mushroom pastry thing (it has a french name).To top it all off, the staff is super friendly - they really make you feel at home. My sister just moved into town about a block from this place, so I'll be here even more often now!
2015-09-03,5,Best Burger I've had in a while! I had my first experience with Carpe Diem this past week for dinner. Service was great, and food was even better! My boyfriend and I started with the Goat Cheese Bruschette as an app and we split the Brie Burger and Gruyere and Mushroom burgers as the main. The bread from the Bruschette was toasted perfect, and the amount of "filling/ topping" was actually a larger portion than I expected. We were eating what was left and wouldn't fit on the bread with our forks. Then came the main event, the burgers. Everything from the bun to the patty was cooked perfectly and they were just DELICIOUS. I honestly couldn't choose which burger I liked better. I also really like how the menu suggests which beer or wine to pair with the food of your choice. I will definitely be back again!
2015-07-29,4,Loving it! The bar tender Bill is super cool and actually knows his drinks which is a really refreshing and he makes really great drinks! Try the Basil Gimlet its amazing!!!  I love his passion actually thats what he says drinking is,  his passion and hes not talking in the alcoholic way, he wants to wow people. I respect that. He is awesome and Im truly impressed.
2015-07-07,5,Food is excellent - we had spicy steak bites, fish & chips and a buffalo chicken sandwich, all were excellent. Thursday half price bottles of wine is a great deal! Very attentive service and a decent (if not occasionally loud) atmosphere.
2015-06-28,4,Decided to come here to sit outside on a lazy Sunday night. Was not disappointed. We Had The veggie burger and the Kate's way sandwich. Both were really good - priced reasonably and tasty.  They are pet friendly outside too so if you have a dog you'd love it. Extra plus:  it's across the street from the movie theatre so you can easily grab a quick bite before a movie.
2015-06-16,5,Man the food here is bangin'! I was not expecting this pub to be so good! First off, it's got a little something for everybody. Bar area with TVs, tables and high chairs and a back restaurant area. The service is great, the bartender and the waitress couldn't have been nicer and the food was on point.There was a group of 4 of us so we did a few apps and drinks in the bar area while watching a Stanley Cup game.Spicy Steak Bites - SO GOOD. GET THESE (if you like spicy). They were not too spicy, but they do have lots of jalepeno slices in the dish which are totally edible and tasty if I do say so myself. This dish is cubes of steak in this awesome sweet soy sauce with jalepenos for the kick. I'll definitely order this again and again.Chicken Fingers - Very tenderized (thin) pieces of chicken and very crunchy! They came with a honey mustard dipping sauce.Coconut Shrimp - Pretty typical as you would get anywhere else. The shrimp were somewhat small and came with a sweet dipping sauce.Wings - typical hot wings you can order with buffalo sauce, bbq, sweet chili or honeyThis place really surpassed my expectations. It's far uptown and it's right near the movie theatre so it's great to stop at when you're in the area!
2015-06-03,2,This was our fifth or sixth visit over the past few years and once again, we were reminded why it is that we rarely come here. The food is average to good, but our experience with the wait staff has been less than desirable. While I would like to have tried the pasties appetizer, I never got a chance because the waitress forgot to put the order in. It would have been nice to dine with our friends (there were four of us) but our entrees were delivered ten minutes apart!!! If you place an order all at once, why can't the food be delivered to your table the same? I think she must have forgotten our dessert order as well as it still hadn't arrived 15 minutes after we placed it. Yet, we could clearly see her "behind the curtain" texting someone when she could've/should've been doing her job. Worst of all, one of the owners was sitting at a table next to ours as we were complaining about not getting our food in a timely manner (or at all). I would've expected him to "seize the moment" and come over to apologize but he just sat there ignoring the situation. WTF??? We've got a lot of choices for mediocre pub food here in Hoboken so my advice is to skip this place. DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND!
2015-06-01,5,This place is a hidden gem for small private party space.  The owner (Joe) is very flexible and really allows you to create the perfect event.  The food is an added bonus as everything we ordered was DELICIOUS!  The location is fantastic and the parking garage around the corner made it really easy for people to travel to.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
2015-05-31,4,It's always great when you find a nice hidden gem. This place is definitely solid.The service was great, as soon as we walked in we were greeted with smiles and helped to a table. We went on a Thursday around 6:30p and stayed about an hour. The happy hour was till 8p and we all had $4 drafts the whole time.The waitress made sure we knew their buffalo wings were award winning and that we should try them. We did.... And they are AWESOME! Definitely recommend.
2015-05-07,5,I had my husband's surprise 40th birthday party at Carpe Diem and I can't say enough about how great this place was to work with.  The owners were responsive and easygoing, the food was excellent, and the party was tons of fun. They have a private room upstairs that holds 35 people, you get your own bartender, a single bathroom upstairs, and you can hook in your own ipod.  They were super cool about letting me put up my own decorations and bringing in a cake.  Also, the pricing was very reasonable.  Highly recommended for your next bash!
2015-04-19,3,Bar Excellent, Table Service, not so much.Slow inattentive outdoor service and the fish and chips is inedible drek, seemed to me like cheap frozen fish sticks with overdone kettle crisps, so disappointing after other really excellent experiences there.   Google fish and chips photos and tell me if you see potato chips anywhere; no?  There is a reason for that. The interior of the fish sticks was grey and squishy.  Disappointing on so many levels from a place that has such good bar service.  I'd stick with the burgers, they are very well crafted.  Sit at the bar and the service will shine. You live, you learn.  Not contemplating going back any time soon.
2015-04-10,5,Best Bar in Hoboken! Food is DELICIOUS especially the buffalo chix wrap & wings. Bartenders are the friendliest. It is such a cozy bar - we go at least once a week!
2015-03-26,5,This is THE neighborhood pub!!!! The staff takes the time to introduce themselves and actually remembers you when you come back. Extremely friendly and knowledgeable staff always greets with a smile. I love this place. Definitely feels like home to me and I have no issues calling it home. Jimmy is absolutely amazing.  The man Is a Mencia!!! Ask him anything. Nick works Thurs Fri and Sat the man is a sports guru. Go in and ask a question. When I moved to this area I was looking for a nice quiet pub that had amazing food and great beer. I definitely found what I was looking for at Carpe Diem. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
2015-03-22,5,I don't eat a lot of chicken wings in general, but I had to try when the hostess told me Carpe Diem's were award winning. The honey chicken wings were so delicious that I wondered if it was possible to return here every night to eat them. The menu is also very helpful by giving suggested beer or wines for each dish. They only had one dessert offering, the apple strudel. I almost passed, but so glad I didn't. I will absolutely return.
2015-03-14,4,Very interesting food!    If I'm stuck on the menu and can't decide between 10 different things that look amazing, then you know they're doing a good job. I went with the Tilapia on bed of spinach with dried fruit (wow!) and white wine sauce.   It was amazing. My date had the pulled pork sandwich, also very very good. I'd also recommend the Southwest-rolls appetizer.    Service was excellent.  I like the fireplace they had going in the back.   Very cozy & casual atmosphere.  I will be back to try more things on that menu,  I have my eye on the Gruyere burger. The reason I give 4 instead of 5 stars is because I found the seating to be a little crammed and awkward - my back right up against other people eating, felt a little claustrophobic for a place not packed.
2015-03-10,4,Since we come here almost once a week, I thought I would write an update.  I still love their burgers and Guinness.  I've also tried the pasties app and it was really good.  The spicy chicken rolls (HH app) are yummy and come with green sauce that is awesome.  In our experience, the service at the actual bar is much better than the bar tables or the restaurant with the exception of the guy server in the bar area.  If I only ever sat at the bar, they would get five stars from me.Thursday is 1/2 off bottles of wine and happy hour is 4-8pm.  I appreciate that they always check right before the end of happy hour to see if you need anything else.
2015-02-25,3,Came here for dinner with friends of ours specifically to try out the wings that Carpe Diem is so well known for (indeed they won best wings of Hoboken I believe). I have to say the wings were pretty good but I didn't find them extraordinary, sweet and spicy flavored but a little under cooked and way too big, I tend to prefer the smaller ones.  The decor itself is pretty cool, with a fake fireplace in the back, a good vibe for a pub!  I was really impressed with my main dish the Penne with Vodka Sauce and shrimp, it was incredibly creamy and flavorful, one of the best I have had in a long time!! However, unfortunately my hubby had the fish and chips which he deemed worst than a high school cafeteria meal :/ Our friends split a burger which they enjoyed.
2015-02-23,5,My boyfriend and I love this place.. It's are go to for a great burger Shepard pie Cesar salad or pasta.   The beer selection is great and the fire place adds to the ambiance go here it's great!!!
2015-02-01,5,Came here for a quick dinner on a Saturday night before going to the movies right across the street. Staff is extremely friendly and the food is amazing!! Ordered the fried fresh mozzarella, the basil dressing that comes with it was absolutely delicious, I wanted to ask for a container of it to go. Also got the chicken quesadilla which comes with a delicious jalapeño sour cream which gives it a little mild kick. My fiancé ordered the chicken BLT with a side of sweet potato fries. Not too sure what the sauce that came with it, could have been honey mustard? But it was extremely sweet. They also toss the sweet potato fries in a sugar/cinnamon mixture which made them very interesting. They have TVs throughout the bar and dining area. Seats in the dining area are a little tight. There was also a fire place with 2 seats in front of it. (Might ask to be seated there next time on a cold night).
2015-01-12,5,WINGS WINGS WINGSi am very picky with wings, but this is the ONE!plus free wings during NFL halftimes! awesome bartenders too! love it here!
2014-12-04,4,There's a lot to like about Carpe Diem.  First of all, customer service goes a long way. Walking in for the first time, we were greeted nicely by the bartender and the hostess. The dining room in the back is nice, quaint, but since an upstairs party was spilling over into the dining room we felt the bar tables were a better bet tonight.  The high top seats/tables at the bar are reasonably comfortable. Table service in the bar area was friendly and efficient.  Chicken fingers for an appetizer were on the crunchy side but no complaints. My friend ordered shepherd's pie and enjoyed it. I went for the broiled tilapia over spinach and thought it was very good.  Two entrees, one appetizer, and two drinks about $55 total, not bad at all.The modest-sized bar has a comfortable pub feel; the walls are loaded with vintage photos and the Van Morrison music enhanced the overall vibe. The bar was busy early so I'm thinking they have a decent happy hour special.  It's across the street from Bow Tie Cinema so you can certainly work Carpe Diem into a 'dinner and a movie' or 'movie and a drink' night.  I really enjoyed visiting and I look forward to going again.
2014-11-28,4,I've been here twice while visiting friends in the area.  Once on a weekend night where there was a great party atmosphere, people dancing, friendly bartenders and just a general good time.  We also just stopped in for dinner where prices were reasonable, portions were good and the food was tasty.  Defintiely would reccomend.
2014-11-17,4,What a hidden little gem! This place is a block from my apartment and I never knew it existed. It was so good though! They give out free wings during half time for Sunday football games and the wings were amazing. I had twelve before ordering my meal because I couldn't stop eating them. We also got the fresh fried mozzarella balls and a burger. The mozz balls were delicious. The burger was only ok. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with a fried egg and chipotle mayo. It sounded amazing but it was kind of disappointing. It didn't have any sauce on it and the egg was cooked all the way through (not runny like I was expecting) so it was pretty dry. The bacon also was more like ham than bacon.  The fries it came with were really good though! Our waiter was awesome too. I will def be back!
2014-11-03,4,The food was excellent! My burger was well seasoned and well cooked. I can't wait to come back and try so of the more unique fare.
2014-11-02,4,Carpe Diem is a cute place. Very cozy, reminded me of a place I like in Hell's Kitchen. It was a cold rainy day so soup sounded perfect. I had the mushroom soup which was delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken soup which was also good with big pieces of chicken and vegetables. Pretty nice portions, a little too big for an appetizer. For the entree I tried the vegetable risotto and added shrimp. Everything was cooked very well, lots of veggies and the risotto was creamy. Overall a very good dish. My boyfriend had the chicken stir fry. It had nice Asian flavor serviced with rice. Exactly the style I would make at home. Great beer, cider, and wine selection. Their menu even suggests beverage pairings with each dish. We really enjoyed this spot. It's tucked away under the bridge on 14th. I'm glad we found it. We will definitely be back again.
2014-10-23,5,Wanted to test-drive this place for a few months before reviewing. We used to walk by  on the way to Pilsener-haus when we moved uptown and actually went in out of sympathy because we never saw anyone outside...what a gem! This place really is a local and the "off the beaten track" location (below the overpass) works and keeps out college pub crawlers such as you see on Washington...Yes it is a bit small (bar seating for 12 or so) and table seating for 10 (there's a dining room out back) so you have to be early..but it's absolutely worth it. Enough TVs, great friendly service (for a Liverpool fan, Jim's great, and so's Nick), my wife loves the wine selection (unlike most bars) but the food is off the charts, so much so that a few friends who are also bar tenders, eat there before going to their place of work...I was going to ding this place a star because they let Jets fans in, but 'hey' nobody's perfect.
2014-10-21,4,Some friends of mine and I dropped in here on a Tuesday night while we were grabbing a movie at Bowtie. We were running later than expected and needed to eat before the movie. We walked in and asked if they could whip up food for 3 in under 20min. The bartender shook his head and told us not to risk it. However, the waitress (I feel awful but I never grabbed her name) heard us asking and confidently said she'd take care of us. The waitress narrowed down our options to about half a dozen items they could whip of quickly. She also pointed us to the happy hour specials that were happening which were great. We settled on the spicy chicken wrap, popcorn chicken, & mozzarella balls and then a round of drinks (good selection). Our waitress was absolutely fantastic: got us our drinks quickly, our food came shortly after, and she let us settle the bill before we ate so we could get going as soon as we were done. I really liked everything (spicy chicken was favorite) but we were also kinda shoveling in order to make the movie.While our time here was brief, the food was good and service was attentive,  personal, and fun. Recommend.
2014-10-16,4,LOVED THIS PLACE!!We went to a movie across the street at the Bow Tie Theater, & although we had planned to go to another restaurant, figured we'd give this place a try since it was literally across the street.When we arrived, the bar was fairly full, but no one was in the dining room. That didn't stop us, we took a corner table by ourselves & settled in for a romantic end to our evening. The drinks & food were good (wings, burger, brucheta, coconut shrimp), but the highlight was our waitress DANIELLE. She was the most pleasant, friendly, upbeat server I have had the pleasure of experiencing for a long time. She was funny & interacted with us, while still letting us have our privacy when we wanted it.She is definitely a great asset to this place & while the food is pretty good, the 4th star is for DANIELLE! Go see her, tell her I sent you :)
2014-09-22,4,It was between this place and The Clinton Social to have a laid back night with a few drinks. I ended up Yelping both and Carpe Diem won due to its great drink specials (Monday through Friday - 4 pm-8pm). A glass of wine at Carpe Diem was $5 while the other spot charged about $10. It's a solid spot. The bar area was crowded. It is away from the Washington area so I can see why. There's high top seats for 2 around the bar, and my friend & I were able to grab one. If not, there's also an eating area in the back for bigger groups. And there's a private room for parties upstairs. We had our Stoli drinks at $6. They also have a good selection of beer at $4 .I went for the Brooklyn lager. I ordered a side of fries, which were good. They offer other specials for appetizers as well. Our waitress was nice but she seemed to disappear by the end of the night. We waited....and waited. We could've easily walked out of the place without paying and she would not have noticed. But my friend wouldn't go along with the idea ;) because we like the spot so we do plan on returning!
2014-09-01,4,Solid establishment.Awesome happy hour specials...$4.50 draft beer and $5 apps from 4pm - 8pm. Eight beers on draft. Jalapeno poppers were very spicy, but much better than your typical frozen type. Buffalo chicken sandwich (made with the same tenders mentioned in other reviews) with fries was spot on.Hit this place up after a stop at the biergarten up the street for some reasonably priced pub fare.
2014-08-29,4,Good food and service, great atmosphere.  Doesn't feel like you're in a "Hoboken" bar which is nice.  Location is off the beaten path but that makes it all the better.  They have some outdoor seating which I haven't yet experienced and the bar area is pretty small, but the dining area is nice and intimate.  There are two TV's in there and a fireplace with two comfy chairs.  Someone recently told me Carpe Diem was voted "best wings in Hoboken".  I had their wings last night and while they were very good, the "Buffalo" wings weren't spicy or very "buffalo-y" in my opinion.  They were more on the sweet side.  They were good and pretty meaty, just didn't seem like your traditional game time buffalo wings.  I love the sandwiches and burgers.  The Brie Burger (substitute the burger for grilled chicken) is great.  The fries are crispy and the beers cold!  Have been here at least a handful of times and will of course be back!
2014-08-19,4,Carpe Diem is an unknown gem! The bartenders are great and the bar is sometimes busy, sometimes totally quiet...either way you get good service. The waitstaff is usually very good and the food is surprisingly really solid. Best chicken soup ever. :) I'm only dinging them from 5 stars because it's usually FREEZING in there and the wine options aren't good...but what do you expect from a pub, I guess!
2014-08-03,4,Great portion size for their apps. We stopped here for a beer, our first time even though we've lived a block away for years. For some reason good from a pub didn't entice us. We were wrong to discriminate. Their lightly breaded Chicken fingers came with delicious homemade honey mustard! I could tell from the lack of food coloring and abundance of flavor. The waiter confirmed it. My wife had goat cheese bruschetta drizzled with a homemade vinaigrette which balanced perfectly with the cheese. The bar features a very fun decor with its Trophy full of wings and walls covered in pictures (includes everybody from Joan of Arc to Conan the Barbarian). A fun place to stop on for a drink. I hear the sweet potato fries is no joke, will have to make this a regular watering hole so I can take advantage of that!
2014-07-31,5,I can not say enough about this place!! One of my favorite places in Hoboken! The staff and service is great and the food is delicious! We (jokingly) made a comment to the bartender about a dish that wasn't on the menu and within a matter of 10 minutes it was sitting in front of us! Just a great local place with a lot of friendly people. Staff and customers alike.
2014-07-25,2,Maybe it was because it was a summer Friday but when I came in here with a buddy and our girls the music basically stopped.  It was 90% guys hunched over the bar.  Just sorta creepy vibe.  I have been few a couple of times and never really got a warm fuzzy welcoming feeling.  Could think of worse places to spend the night but considering the location and general awkwardness of the space, plus cold demeanor, I'll pass.
2014-07-19,4,One of my favorite bars in Hoboken. Off the beaten path, but great menu, great beer selection and drinks, and friendly and prompt staff. I'll come here before a movie, or just to grab drinks with friends.They offer either sweet potato fries or normal fries with sandwiches. I will typically always go for sweet potato fries, but the regular fries here are so good I cheat!They also have an upstairs party room with its own bar, as well as a fireplace and armchairs in the main dining room. Love it!
2014-06-30,3,This place isn't great but its not bad. The food was average. The brie egg rolls weren't as good as I'd hoped for. Probably won't return but it was suffice. It is down the road from the beer garden but coming from the other side it seemed to be in a sketchy area. But the service was decent, they were nice people.
2014-06-21,5,Great place. Went there before a movie and they gave me the check with the meal so we wouldn't be late. So great service. Shepard's pie -- best I ever had. On one wall they have a picture of the Chieftains and below it a picture of the Sex Pistols. These guys know what they're doing.
2014-05-27,5,There wasn't a single thing wrong with our meal, the atmosphere, or service. The prices were more than fair for the quality of the food and the menu is surprisingly diverse, even for a one page rundown. My boyfriend and I had our anniversary dinner here before taking in a movie across the street (under the bridge, bow-tie cinemas) and he ordered the Penne with Alfredo and Bacon/Basil in the sauce, completely delicious and filling, as well as fair priced. I had the Fish N' Chips, which was battered in Blue Moon batter, a soft batter with a lemony aftertaste, really delicious and different from typical fish n' chips I've had in the past (in a good way!). We were lucky to hop in during happy hour so we could get 5$ appetizers, I suggest the mushroom von (a puff pastry with bacon, mushrooms, and whiskey sauce) while my man ordered the mini shepard's pies (a small set of four, reminded me of mini cupcakes, but quite delicious and the gravy that came with them with fucking divine.) We'll definitely come back sometime soon! I'm not easily impressed by the cozy interior, the warm service, and the well priced and delicious menu made me a devotee.
2014-05-13,5,great neighborhood spot!  I shied away from this spot for years since it was in a remote area and not a big fan of unhealthy "bar food", but this place impressed me!  Now that I live in the hood we frequent a lot and always have a great dinner.  From what the staff tells me, they make everything in house from scratch.  So all sauces, etc. are homemade.  Which makes me feel a bit better.  The buffalo chicken sauce is amazing!!  The staff is all friendly especially Chris!
2014-05-11,5,Was there on Sunday last for brunch with my wife , great pint of Guinness , Irish breakfast was very good , Bar tender was very nice , I will be back !
2014-04-28,3,I like that it is like 30 feet from Pilsener Haus Beergarden...so when you've had too much to drink and don't want to be engulfed by 2000 drunk patrons anymore, you can motivate to this spot.I like the sweet/spicy wings and deelish sliders.I like that it doesn't get mad packed.I like that they serve Tempranillo.I don't like that it's alllllll the waaaaaaaay north of the PATH station.
2014-04-16,5,Carpe Diem provided us with a phenomenal meal on a Wednesday night. Chris served us great and I definitely plan to return. Protip: the sweet potato fries are unbelievably good.
2014-04-13,4,It was such a beautiful afternoon that my wife and I sat outside for Sunday Brunch. As mentioned in other reviews it is kind of hard to find with all of the construction on the viaduct and road closures. For an appetizer we split something a little different, the Brie Egg Rolls which was brie, honey roasted walnuts and spinach, it was served with a light berry sauce. For our entrees we went Classic Irish comfort food.  Shepherds Pie and the Irish Breakfast.  The portions are large.  The one thing that threw me with the shepherds pie was they may have used something tangy in the meat. Maybe sour cream?  It was just something I am not used to in Shepards Pie.  It didn't stop me from finishing it and then having some of the wife's Irish Breakfast.  We washed it all down with their Bloody Mary which was ok. Weekend brunch is served from 11 to 3. Happy hour Monday through Friday from 4 to 8. Also of some note is they have a private party space upstairs.  But parking may be an issue.  If this helps when on Grand Street and 14 th Street head towards the flag of Ireland.  Slainte!
2014-03-24,4,Came here once before a few years back but never ate here... When I walked into this place I felt like this bar had a good vibe... Finally had lunch here on Sunday, place was super packed for their Sunday brunch... We were a bit confused when we walked in cause we had no idea if we were to be seated, there was no host to greet us and let us know where to be seated but as we were walking towards the restaurant part of it a nice couple siting near the window had informed us they were leaving and offered us their table. Also gave us good input to order the wings... I'm a vegetarian but my girlfriend isn't. She is a wings kind of girl... Couple told us about Carpe Diem winning a Wings Challenge so her lights lit up and I knew she would order them lol! So we ordered the wings, she rated them and said "they are the best wings she has ever had"... So I guess I would suggest if you go here, order them.  It was the Honey glazed wings, they came with a white dip and carrots with celery sticks.  I had the special which was Tilapia Sliders with sweet potatoes fries.... It was delicious.I got to say... I would definitely come back here
2014-03-21,5,Loveeeee this place! good happy hour- great happy waitress and perfect environment (especially with the fireplace!).   good drinks- good food and good environment just a little far otherwise i'd definitely go more often!
2014-03-15,5,A bit hard to find but worth the search. Very comfortable, cozy Irish pub. My wife had the "Katie's Way", which consisted of fresh turkey, bacon, gruyere cheese and gravy over bread. Very hearty and a huge portion which could have fed two people. My son had the Barbecue Bacon Cheddar burger and it was excellent. I had the Fish and Chips which was made from tilapia and was very moist and tender. Next time though, I would substitute the chips (which were ok) for the sweet potato fries. The only downside was that a party of twenty people came in right before us. We waited over an hour for our food. We weren't in any rush (and had a few Sam Adam's Cold Snaps in the process.) Our server was very apologetic and the manager took all of our beers off the check. Very classy move. We will definitely be back.
2014-03-03,5,Brunch, steak and eggs. Perfectly seasoned steak, eggs cooked just as ordered. Bartender extremely friendly without being intrusive. This was the day after Hoboken's  infamous Leprecon (an event that I don't participate in). The place showed no wear and tear from the day before. I'm sure it had been crowded all day long.I've been to Carpe for events, dinner, and drinks before the movies. (located across the street). It's a perfectly placed gem that is hidden away from the "Coors Light and big screens" bars that populated most of the town.
2014-02-23,5,First noticed this place on my way to the Biergarten, so I stopped in afterwards. It's a small bar area but they have a nice different selection of beers on draft. The staff was nice & friendly and very attentive. For visiting on a Sunday it had a decent crowd of what seemed to be regulars. It's definitely one of Hoboken's hidden gem bars. While I didn't eat, the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked delicious and I didn't notice any plates left with food on them. Definitely stop in if you're in the area.
2014-02-21,4,Count me among the "hidden gem" crowd. Great spot to grab some wings and a few beers.  Sliders and grilled shrimp also very good.  I will try the fish & chips on my next visit.
2013-11-04,3,This place has a lot of potential.  Love the location!  Off the beaten path, close to the movie theater (great for food before or after the movie and gellato) or a quiet spot to grab some food drinks if you want to be away from the busier areas in the city.  The place has a nice decor, couple good TVs by the bar for football, nice drink selection on tap, and a fun food menu and it tastes great.  Prices are very reasonable.Unfortunately, I have to concur with many other folks who have reviewed the spot.  The service is slow, and it's pretty frustrating.  Further, the staff seems rather indifferent towards patrons.  I would def return because the food is good, it's quiet, and convienent, but you should be aware of the service issues.
2013-11-02,4,Ate here today. Brunch menu was great. Good light, good atmosphere, and the dining area looks to be romantic.  Good music and great smells. Good place for a date / movie date.
2013-10-12,4,Enjoy this place, its a hidden gem tucked away near the uptown beergarden. The area is a little beaten up  -- could see that being an issue as it doesn't feel so safe.  I recommend ordering the buffalo wings, they are meaty and delicious, they will deliver copious amounts of protein to your muscles should the shi* hit the fan!
2013-10-06,1,Got here one hour before a movie at Bow Tie cinema. Let the waitress know as much. For a half empty restaurant, it took awhile to get our seats.Our food wasn't out with 15 minutes before the movie started. The waitress said it would be no more than 5 more minutes. 12 minutes later our food never came. I left a $20 on the table for 2 drinks and left.I'll never go back.
2013-10-04,2,Food was great. Service was TERRIBLE! Literally took us 45 minutes to get our food and another 45 minutes to get our check when done eating. It wasn't even busy. There was a table next to us that was never waited on, so they ended up just leaving before ordering. Could have been an off night, but it was pretty frustrating.
2013-09-27,5,Carpe Diem is a wonderful place !  It's warm and cozy and the food is very good.  The staff is very friendly and if you go there more than once, they remember you, and may even remember what you ordered, especially if you ordered in more than once !Carpe is also very family and kid friendly.  They have an intimate dining area with a fireplace.For sports fans, it's a great place at the bar to see any sporting event !It's a great place, we'll see you there !
2013-07-26,4,Definitely off the beaten path. You basically have to walk alongside 14th St. and go under the underpass. It's a bit hard to find, but it's right next to the movie theater. I came here with my roomie had drinks and dinner on a quiet Friday night around 8 PM. We were able to snag outside seating right away. Our waitress was really sweet, Prompt, and didn't rush Us. My roomie got the special burger, Clare's way or something like that. She said that it was really good and had way too much Gorgonzola cheese, I saw that it also had a lot of onions...it  was a pretty big burger. As it was said, she ordered a  side of sweet potato fries. They were actually pretty chunky and not to fried so not too greasy. The meal was $14.I was way too full from lunch, so I had was the wins apps. For nine dollars the wings were definitely plentiful I think there were at least 10. They had a bunch of different flavors like barbecue, Buffalo, sweet chili, honey mustard. I ended up getting sweet chili and it was just right for me because it was not too saucy. I still felt that the wings were really crispy.We both had a glass of wine. I had the malbec which is actually not too dry and rather  fruity  and my roomie had the Pinot Grigio which I don't really care for too much but she seemed to enjoy it as she got a second-glass. 8-9 dollarGood decent bar pub food without the obnoxiousness  of many other Hoboken places, I would definitely come back.
2013-07-03,1,Bartender was extremely rude, came in for a beer but bartender refuse my party service because we couldn't remember his name. Which he never told us to begin With. Maybe he was drunk???
2013-06-12,5,Love the owner Joe. Great spot, kid friendly and very accomodating staff.Food is fantastic, especially the pasties!
2013-06-10,4,Mike's bottom lineGreat bar , great staff, great selection.Great place to start or end a Saturday night bar outing with some bar hopping or some post gaming after an early movie to get your day started.This is a nice little dive bar in a bit of an awkward spot to get to , off the beaten path , but none the less a fun little place to go hang out with friends.Tends to be on the mellower side, but cheap drinks good food and an even better staff.The only downside is the parking especially with the new rules. It used to be you could go to this side of hoboken and park just about anywhere, now 90% of the streets over there are permit only and believe me they enforce it even on weekends.  So you either park on the man street and get a meter (2 hours max) , park someplace and pay , or take public transit .
2013-04-10,4,I have been here a couple times for drinks/apps and once for lunch. Each time was a great experience.  The bartenders/servers/other patrons are super nice.On my boyfriend's birthday we decided to go out for some beers and appetizers, his favorite kind of meal. It was early-ish on a Thursday night and we sat at the bar.  The bartender was very attentive and the food was great. We could tell we were amongst regulars but everyone was very welcoming.  My boyfriend mentioned that he had called and they told him there was a dartboard but he didn't see one.  The bartender let us know that it was in the party room upstairs but that we could go up if we wanted - which was awesome to have the place to ourselves.We just went back recently for lunch with a friend and all three meals were delicious.  Definitely plan to be back for both the food and atmosphere.It is however located pretty much below an overpass which is a little creepy to walk to at night.
2013-04-05,5,If your not doing anything on a Friday night this is the place to go. Great bar, Great food, good service, really cool , friendly employees. i look forward coming to this place because Christina and Nick make me feel at home, their very attentive. I never have to wait hours to get seated or serviced.  Place is very clean which is extremely important to me.
2013-03-14,3,Carpe Diem Pub & Restaurant is located on Grand Street in Hoboken. It is underneath an overpass, which makes it kind of sketchy at night. Over all, the place is nice.  However, I expected to pay a little less for a beer on tap.
2013-02-23,4,This restaurant is a really solid. I've always had a good meal here. Tonight I ordered the "Fresh Mozzarella" appetizer as meal. The app is fried mozzarella balls, but it's lightly fried.  Not too heavy. I was really impressed with the service.  The waiter gave my friend a good sized sample of the draft beer.  Then when he ordered the actual beer, it took awhile to get so the waiter gave the beer for free.  I really appreciated the waiter's pro-activeness. I need to come here more often!
2013-01-20,5,I love this place. It's a low key hole in Hoboken uptown across the street from the movie theater. Good beer and food and late night they set up a couple tables for beruit if your interested.
2013-01-16,5,Brought a freelance client here and was very pleasantly surprised. Great food, ambience and beer list! The service was solid too.
2013-01-14,3,Been here a few times and it's been hit or miss for me.  Like other reviewers say, it's way off the beaten path in hoboken, but i view this as a plus- parking is easier to find and the crowd is more bearable.  First time.  5 stars.  dinner on a weeknightBF and i were blown away by the burgers!  Sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had.  no complaints on service.  2nd time. 3 stars. dinner on a Saturday night.brie eggrolls were a let down but the pasties were great.  burgers were good, other entrees were average.  i got katie's way which is an open face turkey sandwich.  it was massive and overly rich (and trust me, i can eat).  i had about a quarter and was paralyzed for about 4 hours after.  service was spotty, felt forgotten about at times.3rd time.  5 stars. Private party upstairs.probably the best deal in the area on private parties.  $30 open bar for 3 hours in a private room upstairs.  the room is nice and comfortable, you can order food in advance, decent selection and you have the freedom to use an ipod hookup for music and a dvd player.  well-done carpe diem! HIGHLY RECOMMEND for parties.  We had a great time4th time.  2 stars.  Brunch on a SundayDespite being one of 3 tables, service was slow and inattentive and 3/4 meals were overcooked (the 4th meal being a salad).  when i say overcooked i mean a burger ordered medium rare came out medium-well, eggs overcooked, and chicken was charred.  highly disappointing.  sweet potato fries were still amazing though.with some consistency, this place could easily be 5 stars for my standards.
2012-12-24,5,This has become the spot for a few friends living nearby and we've found our way here pretty often.  Staff is great and friendly, beer selection is always good, and the food is definitely a step up from the normal pub fare - go for the hot turkey, bacon, and "some kinda cheese" sandwich!  Not necessarily a spot to sit and watch the games but they do have a number of TVs, a decent amount of seating, and a great vibe.  Never a bad experience!
2012-12-12,4,Interesting beer selection.  The food came out hot.  Carpe Diem kitchen makes food that is easily a step up from 'normal' pub food.The location is a little hard to find, we were coming from the 126 bus.  There is some road construction going. However, once inside the restaurant...you'll find a cozy spot.  Lots of TV around, if that your thing...Well worth a stop if you are in HOB.
2012-10-27,4,This place is pretty awesome .. great food .. really good chef .. like the fireplace ambiance and if Pilsner Haus is too packed, you can always come here for a good time
2012-09-19,5,Good food, brew, and staff!Im from LA but was in town on business and wanted to grab a burger and beer to shake off the jet lag.  The place was empty with the exception of a few locals around the bar.  I grabbed a seat next to the bar and ordered the mushroom & gruyere burger......simple and delicious.  After finishing my meal the bartender and locals made me feel very welcomed, giving me the heads up on the local points of interested.  One pint turned into 6 with the conversation going on and I went back to the hotel a happy man!  I'll definitely go back when I'm in town.
2012-09-01,3,If you're driving up the bridge, you missed it. Turn around.  A little tricky to find.  I'm waiting for the surrounding area to improve before I return.  Didn't stay long enough to try the food.  But the place had a nice feel to it.
2012-08-19,3,I've only been once and it was ok. The shepherd's pie wasn't too good, but the place has a nice relaxed atmosphere. I won't go back to eat though.
2012-07-28,4,We tried going here twice before, it was WAY too crowded, third time was the charm!  Ordered the asparagus puffs appetizer, AMAZING! The pear salad was also a winner. I had a burger for my dinner, definitely one of the BEST burgers in Hoboken! Cooked just right, with hot perfectly cooked fries. This place is tiny, try going during an off hour like we did (late Saturday afternoon) & you should have no problem getting seated. Love this place, we'll be back!
2012-07-28,5,Went there for the first time last night and i gotta tell you,  i had a BLAST.   I was out until 3 am.   We were dancing like crazy and it was just a great time.   The bartender (guy) was GREAT and played great music.   I cannot wait to go back
2012-06-28,4,Solid beer selection at reasonable prices ($2 off aka $4.50 pints during happy hour, which goes till 8pm), great food, ample outdoor seating, friendly staff, and far enough from Washington street to keep away the usual "Hoboken clientele". I'll be a regular.
2012-05-30,5,Best hamburger in Hoboken, hands down.Also great soup.The veggie mash sandwich is bland - and the only disappointment I've had.I've been here so many times - I'm only writing a review now because I'm new to yelp.The service is friendly - and fast. I took my 1 year old here the other day - and he trashed the place, as 1 year olds will do. The staff did not make a fuss - and told us not to even try to clean up. I'm waiting for the right occasion so we can book the upstairs there.
2012-04-30,5,Without a doubt the best Bar Food/Irish fare I have ever had and one of the best restaurants in Hoboken.    My fiance and I came here before going to see "The Five Year Engagement" (decent movie, not great) and really enjoyed our meal.  Quite frankly, I was shocked at how good the food is here.  My sandwich was delicious (great with the gravy) and my fiance really enjoyed her burger.  The sweet potato fries are the best fries I have ever eaten.The service was very good and the crowd was really friendly.  Best of all, the beer selection was great and the prices were just right.We had a great time when we came here for New Years Eve.  I'm so glad we came back for dinner.  It's a bit off the beaten path (I live downtown), but I will be back as often as possible.
2012-04-02,5,The Carpe Diem Pub is a great little restaurant.  I have a friend who is getting a divorce and she was heartbroken and I took her and her parents out to dinner there.  I looked up yelp to find a good restaurant and The Carpe Diem pub came up with great rating so I took them all their and we had a New York strip steak and orange chicken salad and the shepherd's pie.  The food was very good and everybody was very satisfied with the service.  I always loved to find great little restaurants like this.  This is a very good restaurant.
2012-03-16,4,Located in uptown Hoboken, this bar is located close to the movie theater. Went here with the yelp squad to try the drinks. The place is nice and cozy. As soon as we walked we were welcomed by the server and she arranged tables for us(we were 10 of us).This place offers a relaxed and inviting setting to enjoy a refreshing brew, cheer on your favorite team, or just catch up with friends and they also have a fireplace, located in the dining room.They had a good variety of beers on tap and also had a wide selection of wines.Overall it is a nice bar to have a good time with friends.
2012-03-16,3,I went here for my birthday dinner a few weeks ago- we went because of the yelp drink special going on. I had had a particularly terrible horrible no good very bad day at work and was looking forward to celebrating and letting loose! this place is SO HARD  to find if you don't know where you are going! I never even knew it existed! You go down a seemingly dead end road with construction near the beer garden and POOF there it appears out of nowhere!The decor was good- good job on the fireplace. Our waitress was mehhhh OK. She wasn't especially helpful and seemed to be serving her very large breasticles instead of good service. Can't even remember what she looked like, just cleavage. The food came out and it was OK, nothing to write home about. I got the burger and it was a typical greasified goodness of a burger in a pub. Drinks were OK, nice selection of beers. This place is just so chill, not somewhere you want to go when you are looking to have fun and get CRUNK. So this did not satisfy my desires that evening. The best part of the night was when we got the check and it wasn't too shabby! The place was not bad, but not memorable. There are tons of bars restaurants in Hoboken and most of them are easier to get to and more fun than this place. I would probably only return here if I lived within walking distance.
2012-03-12,3,HMMMM... This place is weird to eat dinner at but I am sure it is a great place to go "belly up" at the bar. Totally off the beaten path for Hoboken.We had an early evening meal here during the Yelp Drink special week. The service was lacking as we needed to ask for silverware after our food arrived and hound the waitress for waters and beer refills. She was nice but clueless.The food was okay but I have to remind myself we were at a bar not a white tablecloth establishment. The menu is outdated as they no longer offer some of the items listed on the menu. The tab at the end of the night was the best thing about this place. Totally affordable little hole in the wall.
2012-03-05,4,I used to come here all the time.  It's on the outside edge of Hoboken, so it's not always easy to get to, but that's why I love it.  It's a local Hoboken crowd.  Beer selection is good and includes some local NJ beers and other craft beers.  They do serve food, although I have never eaten here.  The layout is great, don't seem to be many bad seats.  TIP: Try the Banana Bread Beer.  Anything associated with Banana Bread is great, and this is no exception.
2012-03-04,4,Came here on the invite of Steph. for the Yelp drinks event here. Gotta say I had a really good time. The peeps I met were/are really awsome. This is more of a four stars for the time I had than the place itself. Although I gotta say had the fried cheese app. and it was killer. Prices for drafts were really great and my wife enjoyed the house pinot. Will deffinatly try this place again soon.
2012-02-12,4,Amazing amazing wings!!  I cannot wait to go back for more of them.  Super friendly staff.  The bartender is awesome.   Love this bar.   Love the fireplace in the back.
2012-02-03,4,Carpe Diem is a really cool little joint that I never would have found if it wasn't for yelp. And this is why I shall yelp until my dying days, because it is so great to find fun little out of the way spots! Clearly I am not the only one either, when I headed there for dinner a few weeks ago it was packed, especially in the bar, on a particularly chilly Hoboken evening. It was extremely cozy inside especially by the fire. The waitress was very friendly and efficient. And the harvest salad I had there was light yet delicious and just enough food for me. I love when pubs have good salads, I feel like I can go to a fun place without leaving feeling like I ate 1500 calories and need to be rolled out in a deep-fried haze. Good times! Looking forward to a return visit for sure.
2012-01-20,4,I've been here twice now, both were private parties in the upstairs area of the restaurant. There were 4 different food options in the buffet, but everything was delicious(especially the penne vodka). Space is limited, but the staff are accommodating and very nice. The bartender who worked the private party had a heavy pour, but he was also friends with the host of the party, so he took good care of us. When we did go downstairs to leave, I got to see how intimate the dining area was, but everyone was sitting so close together and its seemed pretty loud. This also probably had a lot to do with the fact that it was getting late and people were getting pretty rowdy at the bar. Definitely a nice place for a small gathering upstairs, and the bar seems to get pretty packed later in the night.
2012-01-06,4,Excellent diamond in the rough type place 'round the 'boken! It's easy to hit up for a meal before or after a trip to the movies or the brand spankin' new biergarten if you're looking for German beer but not German fare. The dining room is rustic with a fire place and close tables, yet the decor is clearly cute and intentional with interesting photos in a collage-style arrangement. I had the Belgium Onion Soup - like French Onion, but slightly lighter in color and with gruyere cheese. For my main meal, it was the turkey burger done "California style" with a side salad. The burger was good, seemingly homemade-ish, but the bun was overwhelmingly large and overpowered the burger so I ended up removing the top part of the bun. The happy hour specials knocked a couple bucks off of the brews, so I had a Stella with my dinner. I'm looking forward to another stop here. For drinks or for food, the vibe is great and I like that it seems to be a well kept secret!
2012-01-03,4,No more Palm on tap at Carpe Diem but I'm still a fan...It's still comfortable, still not super crowded, and still has quality draft beer.
2011-12-04,3,I came here with a few friends before going to see a movie across the street, and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this place! It's a cute and cozy bar with a huge menu. All four of us had a hard time figuring out what to get because the menu was extensive. The goat cheese bruschetta and wings were tasty apps, and I got the Kate's Way sandwich, which is actually drenched in gravy. I definitely didn't need that much gravy, but the dish was delicious.The only reason I'm not giving it 4 stars is because the server was SO weird. I don't know if she just didn't want to be there, was having an off night, or just sucked, but she was very short with us and not helpful at all. It really sucks to have a great dining experience ruined by the service, but it was hard to look past.Either way, I'll definitely go back the next time I'm uptown. The brunch menu looks great, too!
2011-11-15,4,I'm a fan of any place that doesn't assume I mean "gin and tonic" when I ask for "gin and soda". Seriously, that happens more often than not. Cheers, Carpe Diem!
2011-11-02,4,In Hoboken you either live Uptown (10th and higher) and love the relaxed atmosphere  at night sans drunken 20 somethings roaming around being loud and obnoxious or you live downtown forced to eat and deal with over crowded places.This place is a hidden Gem of Hoboken and really represent the meaning of community and pub life. I love this place and it's such a great escape.  Something so cozy about the bar and the staff. It's a really welcoming place to get away from a getaway (Most Hoboken Bars) The food is all excellent and reasonably priced. I love the all their burgers and their sweet potato fries, so yum!. I would say the food overall is great but the atmosphere is even better.I always have a great relaxed experience when I come here.*Music Choice is Great also ...(I could write more but I almost don't want to draw more attention to this place)
2011-07-18,5,Roomie and I had dinner here before we went to the movies. Let me just say...what a hidden gem this place is!I got the Orange chicken salad, which had a really awesome orange vinaigrette and had black pepper chicken, orange segments, tomatos and almonds and  carrots. Also got a side of asparagus.Roomie got the Harvest Chicken salad, she said it was super good.I don't spend all that much time in Uptown Hoboken, but I probably should, if restaurants like this are hiding out! Service was quick and efficient and we were out in about an hour to catch our movie. Before tip, the big was about $40 for 2 salads, a glass of wine and a side.We'll be back no doubt!
2011-05-18,4,This hidden bar is a gem in Hoboken.  The beers on tap are the standard plus a few unique good ones (Palm).The food is bar food but good nonetheless.  It is very reasonably priced.  Carpe Diem is a great uptown bar if you are tired of the over priced & over played scene at City Bistro or Madison's.  Also, you should go to Restaurant.com to buy a gift certificate.  Carpe Diem is one of the few Hoboken Bars that offer Restaurant.com gift certificates.
2011-05-16,4,The bartenders are awesome and generous. Nice crowd. The food very good but is a bit expensive but what isn't in Hoboken.
2011-05-06,3,You know .. it does have a pretty bum location, as far as hoboken goes. The addition of the movie theater has to provide for a biz bump and truthfully, they deserve it. As long as you take them for what they are, then you will be just fine! We had stopped in before a movie and didn't even make it there after all.We enjoyed a couple of burgers ... started off with some wings and over all we were certainly satisfied. It will not stay in our memory as the most incredible meal to date but you don't got here expecting that ... gimme a burger and a beer !
2011-04-26,4,The Bartenders here are awesome...always generous with the pours.Most of the menu is your typical bar food but they have some excotic dishes like stuffed asparagus (the bartender did not recommend).It's a bit off the beaten path so it doesn't get too crowded and there is an upstairs you can rent out for parties.
2011-04-11,4,My fiance and I love this place.  The brie burger is amazing! The service is good too. My only complaint is that the music can sometimes be a little loud, especially if you're in dinner mode versus going out mode.
2010-12-22,4,A great spot to grab dinner before a movie at the theater across the street. Reasonably priced and good food. I especially like that you can order half portions of their sandwiches and meals if you're not feeling too hungry or don't feel like bringing leftovers into the theater.
2010-11-16,5,Carpe Diem exceeded my expectations. We went there for dinner on a Saturday night had the grilled shrimp appetizer which was a little small, but delicious. My boyfriend and I both had the chicken soup which was out of this world and unlike most Hoboken restaurants where everything is a la carte it comes with the sandwich (as one of a few side options).  Then I had grilled chicken and he had the buffalo chicken which were both excellent and big we took 1/2 home. We also had sweet potato fries that seemed to be hand cut. They were yummy and well done. I can't wait to go back and enjoy  dinner by the fireplace.
2010-02-21,3,Carpe Diem is a small Irish pub. when I say small, I mean, the main dining area can fit maybe 25 people. so it does have that whole cozy feeling. I believe I saw a sign which said there was a larger room upstairs, though.the pulled pork sandwich with chipotle dressing (interesting, but tasty combination) was great, and the sweet potato fries (one of my tests of a restaurant's quality) were incredible.aaaaand they have Magic Hat on tap (oh ho ho yeah!) - awesome sauce!service for food was fairly fast, although it took a long time to get our check. and, go figure, we were in a rush to go see a show, so we were a bit miffed about that.I did like that there were two comfy chairs and a fireplace. the perfect setting to sip brandy and discuss the latest news from the outer colonies, mmmmyes?the only real gripe? it's quite deep into Hoboken, and while it's not a bad place, unless I was already in this end of the neighborhood, I probably wouldn't go here.that being said, I feel a 3-star rating is what this place deserves. it's fairly priced, the music isn't blasting (so you can -gasp- actually have a conversation with your friends), and the food/beer choices are good. if you're in this end of Hoboken (say, to go to the new movie theater), check it out!
2010-02-19,3,I rated ok for the service, the same waitress was not rude when I went twice but this Irish Pub does need more helpers.  Waited a little longer than expected.  I love the sweet potato fries.  It's a must try!  Burger is good too!  Good for family though it gets too "vocal" during sports season.
2010-01-04,3,This cool little Irish bar is situated in uptown Hoboken, right near the new Clearview movie theater, which makes it a perfect spot to stop by for a drink before or after a movie.  Very friendly service and they always seem to have good drink specials like half price bottles of wine or free buffalo wings during football halftime.  Fireplace is also a nice touch, especially during this cold winter.
2009-12-13,4,This is a hidden germ in the upper west side  of Hoboken.  There are fresh beers from the tap, delicious Irish beacons that were perished when Ted and Joe was gone.  The steak and egg was so great that I felt so happy in the rainy gloomy Sunday afternoon.  There was a cozy fireplace in the corner of the back room on the first floor where we can have some family time. We still can hear the cheers from the fans for those touch down.  It is VERY Irish!  BBQ chickens are great  Don't leave without a bite of it.  There are 2nd floor available  for private party.  Can not wait to go back to meet my pals...
