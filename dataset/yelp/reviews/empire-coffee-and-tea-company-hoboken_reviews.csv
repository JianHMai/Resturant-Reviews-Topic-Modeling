2021-11-02,4,The coffee is quite tasty and they carry unique varieties from around the world. All of their blends have been very impressive. My only issue is that they are located within 50 yards of a middle school so I am not legally allowed to come here during school hours.
2021-09-22,4,Amazing coffee spot in Hoboken, if not one of the best. They have bags of fresh beans if you're interested in purchasing some coffee to take home. I recently went and ordered the Mexican spiced iced coffee, which is their iced coffee blend with cinnamon and nutmeg. It's very flavorful, definitely will come back for that.
2021-09-19,5,Love their Mexican spiced coffee! There's just so many flavors going on but they blend together really well. Also, even when you walk by the coffee shop, there's such a great smell of coffee.
2021-08-05,5,one word: orgasmic. thank you for making such a great coffee. holy wow. i stumbled upon this place and i'm glad i did. it smells heavenly inside and has the sweetest quirkiest vibes. coffee lovers check this place out.
2021-07-10,1,I ordered a large super food tea. The counter person told me it had flavors of pineapple and a list of other things. First off, the tea was so weak there was almost no flavor. Definitely not a strong brew nor a strong infusion. Secondly, I realized there was a small bug in my drink.
2021-06-21,2,Cute little shop with fairly large selection of roasted beans. Made the assumption that the coffee drinks would be equally impressive. Small cappuccino consisted of a weak shot and a large dollop of foam. Insult to injury, not particularly friendly service. Me thinks not.
2021-06-06,5,Super cute ! And the coffee is amazing I couldn't believe how yummy it was+ super fast! Lots of coffee inside for sale!
2021-05-01,5,This place smells so good when you walk inside. The coffees to go are great, they have a good coffee and muffin deal during the week. In the summer I like the iced Mexican lattes. I come here to buy coffee beans, I usually go for the Hoboken blend or starry night!  The graham cracker didn't have much flavor but still tasted good.
2021-04-02,3,Coffee is good.  Staff is generally incompetent and lazy.  Every time I go in there they eff up the punch cards.  Every. Single. Time.  And they give attitude when you ask to correct.   Also almost time I'm in there staff is making fun of another staff member not there.
2021-01-06,5,"I love Empire! When you walk in you're greeted by a plethora of coffee beans which takes the comforting "coffee shop smell" to a whole other level. The service is always friendly and quick, even if there's a line I usually never wait more than 7 minutes. They have such a large selection of coffee, teas, and anything else you can imagine. And honestly, I'm a chai tea latte kind of person, and theirs is one of my all time favorites in Hoboken. You won't be disappointed."
2020-11-28,5,The air has an excellent coffee smell and there are surprisingly diverse offerings on shelves and on the menu. Mentioning the separate entrance and exit doors might may be one of those 2020 things that makes my Yelp reviews less cheerful, but it's also a sign of Empire's attention to detail.The Mexican spice coffee is an awesome mocha-adjacent concoction with ingredients including cinnamon. I'm glad I visited Empire today instead my earlier plan to go to a large chain (not THAT one the other one).
2020-11-22,5,I'm not a coffee drinker, but the Mexican hot chocolate here is amazing! Hands down my favorite hot chocolate place in Hoboken now.
2020-11-19,5,Empire is our go to coffee spot and has been for at least the past 10 years. They have a HUGE variety of beans, teas, and even decaf beans! Their flavors are all so unique and yummy! We love the staff and see them multiple times a day.. because.. coffee is life!
2020-11-17,2,Not a fan!! I had a basic cappuccino that was burnt and didn't taste like coffee at all!  My friend had the same to say about her cappuccino as well! There was a great assortment of coffee beans and a grinder to purchase some fresh coffee but what I was served was far from it!! I was hoping to give this place another chance but I was also sold an expired peanut butter chocolate cups!!! I was really looking forward to my chocolate with my hot drink on this cold day, but my candy was disgustingly old and had odd texture- I ended up throwing it out and just chugged my coffee while it was warm. I did not have a good experience and while they may have a great assortment or coffee beans and chocolate knick knacks, this place feel short for me.
2020-09-08,5,Great iced lattes & ground/bean coffee for sale. Sarah and John were there today -- running the show with absolutely epic vibes. I go here 3-4x/week. Looooove it.
2020-07-19,5,I absolutely love coming to this place. If you're a coffee lover then you're going to love how upon immediately entering, you're just hit in the face with the sweet scent of coffee emanating from the brew and then the many bags of different coffee varieties. The baristas are very helpful in guiding you through the selection process if you're buying whole beans and they brew amazing coffee and serve it quickly. Bonus points for taking social distancing seriously during the Covid19 pandemic. There's one door for entering and one door for exiting. On top of that they have placed tape markers for spacing people apart from one another and don't allow more than 6 or 7 customers at a time in the store.
2020-06-30,5,The smell when you walk in Empire is AMAZING. This has become my go to coffee spot over the last few years. I even have out of state family request I bring beans from here every time that I visit. The staff is helpful with suggesting different roasts based on preferences and grind based on your coffee maker. If you don't see your favorite blend just ask, I've learned some of their seasonal blends are their regular blends with festive names. I almost always pick up a coffee while I am in there getting beans and have never been disappointed.
2020-06-29,4,It's an awesome place if you buy your own coffee beans. They have many varieties and they have decaf beans too. They have loose tea leaves in the back too if you are a tea lover!
2020-04-29,5,I really like this place, and I buy a pound of beans (Try the "Uncle Paulie's" blend) every week. The staff is really friendly, it always smells great, and they make good drinks. I'd say this is easily my favorite coffee shop in Hoboken. The biggest draw back to this place is that they don't really have much seating, so it's more of a grab and go place. The other thing I really dislike is that you cannot leave a tip for the employees when you pay by credit card. I'm told it's at the owners direction. Now, while I'm sure there are legitimate reasons why this would be preferred, I do think it's a bit unfair to the employees. These aren't exactly high paying jobs so the tip money is important. I try to remember cash for the tips, but honestly, how often do you carry cash??
2020-04-29,5,Since we are all brewing at home these days, I thought the spot where I've been getting my beans from deserved lots of extra praise. The past month or two (how long have we been inside for?) their coffee beans have been getting me through the day. My go-to is the Starry Night blend but since we have nothing but time, I've gotten a bit more adventurous and usually get a second bag of something different. The second runner up is probably the Uncle Paulie's Favorite. Note: the butterscotch coffee will make your entire house smell like butterscotch. They are doing everything they can to keep themselves and their customers safe and I definitely appreciate it. They have 6 foot tape markings along the floor, all employees are wearing gloves and masks and if you use a card they don't ask you to touch anything to sign. The biggest thing is that they are lucky enough to have two doors, so the front door is for entering the store while they ask customers to leave through the back door. No one is ever walking past one another this way and you never feel crowded. Thank you for keeping me spirits and my energy up, Empire!
2020-03-28,5,The nicest people and wonderful courteous service. Excellent assortment of coffees which are roasted, flavored and ground to perfection. At this time of coronavirus, I urge all coffee lovers to support our local merchants. This is the best coffee shop in town and works to deserve your business!
2020-02-03,5,Best coffee in Hoboken! The line is always long but worth the wait.  They have lots of flavored bean options. Haazelnut, s'mores and ghandi's choice are my favorite blends.  Staff is always super nice!
2020-01-27,5,By far the best coffee in hoboken. Also it's adorable and has a bunch of cute mugs and trinkets inside. Support local business and make this your go to coffee place!
2020-01-21,5,best coffee place in hoboken. absolutely love it here. get the nutella latte (iced or hot, both are amazing). also the creme brulee flavor is bomb.
2019-11-16,5,My husband and I grabbed a coffee from here and the coffee did not disappoint. They have endless coffee to choose from if you want a pour over and for drip coffee they had four options (decaf, regular, pecan, and hazelnut). I got the pecan flavored coffee and it was so delicious. The service was great and the ambience was relaxing and unique. Ill definitely come back here if I'm in the area.
2019-11-04,2,When I go to a coffee place that isn't a chain, I typically expect it to be a little higher quality. I ordered a gingerbread latte and an americano, both of which tasted flavorless and burnt. I ended up not drinking the latte and just throwing it out. In addition, the service from the 3 people behind the counter was pretty subpar also. Not friendly service at all. Muffins were good though...so I guess there's that lol
2019-10-30,5,RidiculouslyAwesome selection of fineRoasted beans to try. Highly recommendFor your caffeinated needsAlso try the tea!
2019-09-10,5,I think the coffee is great and the owner's regular staff who work there are incredibly friendly and attentive as soon as you walk through the door. They have always made me feel like I'm right at home! Thank you guys for such pleasant service and always great attitude and a smile :)
2019-09-02,5,I've heard from a couple people the coffee isn't good here. I totally disagree. It may not be a refined coffee house but that's not what they are going for. My husband loves flavoured coffee and this place delivers with something like 20 different flavored beans. Also their prices are totally reasonable. As a new mom I don't want to be spending $6 on a 12oz coffee like I did in the pre-baby days. Here you can get an iced coffee and a pastry for that price. Also their customer service is great and they always remember me.
2019-08-18,4,Good coffee with great service! The coffee has a nice chocolate-y flavor to it. I bought a bag of Ethiopian beans for the office once and it was a hit. No real place to sit except outside in the summer FYI. I also prefer to put in my own cream and sugar but they do it for you (it's just a preference, I wouldn't knock points for it).
2019-08-13,5,Love this place. The coffee is great and the staff is very helpful and you don't need to bring your own sweetener.
2019-06-09,5,This is my favorite coffee place I've ever been. They have all of their beans on display in the shop so when you walk in you get hit with a fantastic aroma. The staff was friendly even though it was very busy (few and far between these days). The coffee was obviously fantastic - I recommend double espresso over ice.
2019-04-01,5,You can get an excellent large almond latte, regular coffee and a fresh biscotti here for approximately $7. I'm not a coffee connoisseur but I thought the latte was on point, rich and strong. A small cappuccino is roughly $2.27- can't beat that! Besides, the quaint look and feel of the place, huge barrels of coffee all stacked to each other, the people in this small coffee shop are really nice... warm, patient and welcoming. No wonder there's a long line almost always, but it moves fast and the coffee is SO good! With so many pluses, this is a true Hoboken gem!
2019-01-25,5,Cute little coffee shop off busy Washington in Hoboken. You are hit with the aroma of coffee beans as soon as you walk in due to the display of coffee available for purchase. They have a standard coffee menu, with a few seasonal/daily specials or blends and when you purchase beans they will happy grind them for you they way you need (Keurig, drip, French press). While they do have tables both inside and out, the seating is scarce, so I would suggest taking your purchases to go or sitting out in the nearby park if it's nice.
2019-01-07,5,Amazing place! Fresh beans when you walk in that make the place smell amazing.  The staff is excellent and very helpful when it comes to choosing beans.  Excellent selection of coffee and teas!
2018-12-09,5,My favorite coffee shop in Hoboken, from day one. The place is so cute with open bags of grounds making the place smell great, too. Staff have always been super friendly and will give a reco when you want one. Flavored coffees and the muffins are delicious. Not too much for seating, especially in the winter, but it's great for grabbing on the go.
2018-11-05,5,This is my favorite spot to go to here in Hoboken! Their fresh coffee beans are delicious! And the drinks they make there are just as delicious. If you are someone who appreciate good coffee and not just your classic Starbucks, then this is a must try spot.
2018-10-08,5,I absolutely love this place!! All of their coffees, espresso drinks, and teas are amazing. And the girls that work there are always so nice and accommodating
2018-09-16,5,Friendly people, cute place, excellent coffee. My favorite is the Mexican spice coffee!!
2018-09-03,5,My favorite coffee shop in Hoboken! You can buy beans by weight or coffee/tea by the cup. The space is small with only 2 small tables inside but there are a few tables outside as well for days with good weather. It's also right across the street from the park so you can take your coffee to-go and spend some time outdoors. Coffee here is freshly roasted and freshly ground, and you can taste the difference. This place also has a huge variety of different coffee flavors. It's also cheap- less than $2 for a simple drip. I have yet to be disappointed by any of the several different brews I've tried so far, they have never been too acidic or bitter and the flavors come through beautifully. I'll keep coming to Empire for my caffeine needs.
2018-08-30,5,Everyone is super friendly and easygoing! Try their coconut flavored coffee! You won't regret it
2018-08-24,5,Love this spot! So many flavors and choices. They flavor their own coffee beans and grow their own beans I was told! Amazing! Tried the Nutella frozen blended latte. Yum! Tasted like mocha coffee - not as great as Nutella lol. But yummy coffee. Cute area to sit outside and the prices are comparable to Starbucks. Will return to try more flavors! Staff was friendly and offered options.
2018-07-20,5,What a wonderful little discovery! A fantastic coffee shop just out of the way from the hustle and bustle of Washington street with a great selection of fresh beans from all over the world. They had a lot of flavored beans, like Graham Cracker, and Salted Caramel, which I don't go for. But they did have a variety of strains from Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Costa Rica, Columbia, and many others. No Yirgacheffe--but that's ok! The service was great, and the shop had a nice little area to sit outside. I have another great spot for fresh beans to choose from for my various blends. I'm a happy camper!
2018-07-20,5,Great coffee, great service and wonderful little shop! Good place to sit and enjoy a brew with friends!
2018-07-11,5,This is a super cute, quaint coffee and tea stop. The employees are incredibly helpful and friendly, and have a wide array of beans to choose from that they grind to your liking there. Definitely recommend!!
2018-06-26,5,Delicious german chocolate iced coffee - no added sweeteners.  Excellent customer service and a warm welcome to Hoboken.
2018-05-29,3,I have been driving past this colorful little corner shop for almost two years and was excited to finally get in to check it out and try their lattes I had been reading about on here.Upon entering, I was very pleasantly surprised by the HUGE assortment of coffee blends displayed openly with tags and descriptions of each roast. Further, beyond the register bar to the left is the Tea room which has another HUGE selection of Teas displayed on racks in glass jars.I opted for the red velvet cake latte and requested it be a little less sweet. The server, although diligent in explaining the composition of their specialty 'Famous Funky' lattes, was not very friendly. Beyond that, I had anticipated based on their fun and whimsical outdoor decor that it would be a cozy, cute coffee shop to enjoy my latte in and possibly open up my laptop to pump out a few emails. It was quite disappointing that they have such minimal and uncomfortable seating even though they have space for better/more with their large sidewalk space/terrace in front outside and inside. The bathroom was also not nice. All in all it is a coffee shop that has a large eclectic variety of teas and beans, but if you choose a prepared drink by their baristas, plan on taking it TO GO.
2018-05-01,5,Great coffee and prices. The employees are very friendly. That's all you need for a coffee place
2018-04-25,5,Great little coffee and tea spot that's not on Washington Street. I was back in Hoboken for a few days before heading to Long Island to see my fam and I was hyped to discover this place.Lots of great teas and lattes, along with loose leaf teas to buy and take home. Snacks as well.Note, it will get crowded and in the winter, there's not a lot of seating, so be warned!
2018-03-07,4,Stopped in here on a Saturday morning looking for a fun flavorful latte. Empire has a ton of beans that you can purchase for home, like at least 20 different varieties (and a check in offer to save when you purchase a pound).  It's a small place with a few tables in the front. When I got there it wasn't too crowded and they were well staffed to keep the line moving. I decided to try the red velvet latte. Pricing was great. A medium which is pretty big cost less than a small at some other coffee shops. The only problem was, I wouldn't exactly label this flavor as red velvet. Like to the point where I thought they might have given me the wrong coffee. But low and behold read the other reviews saying the same thing. This is definitely too sweet, overwhelming with a fruit flavor, to be considered red velvet. Regardless of this flavoring faux pas I would come back to try something different, as the service, pricing, and atmosphere made up for it. Maybe something more classic or maybe a Milky Way latte...
2018-03-04,5,I went here for the first time this morning. The place has that amazing fresh coffee bean smell. They sell good snacks other than just the coffee, like various types of chocolate, some bbq sauces and also has gift items. The staff are also really helpful if you're not sure which beans to buy.I bought a half pound of one of their ethiopian coffee beans and had the best cup of coffee I've had in ages with it. I'm so happy we have a coffee bean shop like this in Hoboken
2018-02-11,5,Very cute coffee shop to stop in and get a coffee or to buy beans to go. I use to love buying different beans every week and exploring the flavors - they also have a super cool rewards program so that you keep buying beans then you get one free.
2018-01-31,5,My boyfriend recently moved two blocks away from Empire and I couldn't be happier. When you first walk in, you're quickly greeted by the friendly staff. There are over 30 varieties of roasted coffee beans, both flavored and unflavored, lining one side of the wall and coffee makers/teas/snacks lining the other side. When we told them that we were looking to buy a pound of coffee beans, one of the staff members enthusiastically came around the counter to help us. She thoroughly explained the different types of roast they have and helped steer us in the right direction based on our preferences. We decided to get 1 pound of the winter wonder blend at $7.99/lb and asked for it medium ground.We've also stopped by for quick cups of coffee in the morning before work and have never been disappointed. We're so excited to keep coming back for more ground coffee once we finish the pound we picked up!
2017-12-16,3,Hoboken has a plethora of coffee shops and restaurants alike- and empire coffee is a nice addition!As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by strong aroma of freshly ground coffee from exotic locales!There are also hard to find cookies and chocolates stocked up nicely!Now for the coffee we had- we did the mistake of trying the red velvet flavored coffee which was so overtly sweet and weird that I could not go beyond a few sips. It was also not very hot!Hopefully I get to try their regular coffee which might be good.
2017-11-27,4,This place smells amazing upon entering the establishment - I may be biased since I love the smell of coffee. The coffee here is strong and delicious. The shop is big, for the beans and random merchandise being sold here, but the seating area is very limited and not spacious so I wouldn't recommend this spot for people trying to get work done in a coffee shop environment. They do have a rewards card here so don't forget to ask for one!
2017-11-26,5,Love love love this place! Best hot chocolate I've ever had! And the muffins are sooo good!
2017-10-28,4,A Hoboken institution I have been coming here for 13 years, great coffee and drinks in general, they also sell coffee and tea, there is a whole room of loose tea in the back hidden away, a gem.The only thing that I find annoying is the people working on laptops doing skype calls shouting at there screens but ... you know who you are and how important everyone else is not !!
2017-09-29,1,They might be better at speciality coffees/morning drinks, but regular iced coffees are gross here. Took two sips this morning and threw it in the garbage. Likely won't return.
2017-09-26,5,This is definitely one of my favorite places in Hoboken to spend my hard earned money! The staff is always chill, very knowledgeable and overall just very pleasant to deal with. That means a lot to me these days. Dozens of kinds of whole bean coffee that they grind down to your specifications. Always perfectly packaged.
2017-07-30,5,Coffee is great and not too expensive but the best thing about this place are the fresh beans. Used to love being able to walk and get a cup of coffee plus a pound of fresh ground beans. Lots of beans from lots of different regions plus some pretty awesome blends. As well as a lot of flavored beans and some unique seasonal flavors. Check-it out you will never want to leave after smelling how amazing it is in there.
2017-07-23,5,This place is a fantastic option whether you're looking for a standard cup of coffee, a latte, or coffee to take home (ground or whole bean) They have a ton of fun flavors, and seasonal ones also. I love the Hoboken blend and also the Irish Cream. My husband loves their sexy teas, and I really like the Fluffy Angel latte when I'm craving something sweet.  The staff is super friendly and nice as well - genuine.
2017-06-29,5,If you're looking for a local coffee shop instead of a Starbucks this is the place to go. Not the biggest fan of their iced coffee which is my go to drink in the summer but everything else is fantastic. Love their muffins. Really good prices and high quality products. A large iced coffee and a muffin is about $5 and is a great deal compared to any other place I would go to for coffee and a snack.
2017-06-11,5,I stayed just up the road from this place and i ended up going 6 out of 8 days I was there! The place is small but not cramped. The staff where all friendly except one who I only saw twice. The coffee was excellent (Strong New York style coffee- this is not a place for the faint of heart) and they made sure to make everything fresh and quickly.The store itself had a lot of fun elements. There was plenty of coffee and tea related merchandise and lots of in house roasted beans. I ended up taking some of them home when   I left. There's seating available but I recommend just walking up the road to the pier and having your coffee there.
2017-05-31,3,I want to love Empire but I sadly find their iced coffee drinks to be extremely bitter. Regardless, a great place to go to buy a variety of beans and teas.
2017-05-20,5,The moment you step into this place you will understand why it's so amazing. The aroma of the coffee beans are so tasteful! They have a pleather of coffee beans that you can choose from! Best coffee shop in Hoboken by far!!!
2017-05-12,1,They've been fairly rude on repeated occasions. I understand if it's a one-off event (we all have bad days), but this has been consistent enough for me to leave a review. Hope things pick up.
2017-05-07,5,My favorite place for coffee in the morning! I also frequently buy their looseleaf tea. Never had a problem with quality.
2017-04-02,4,Cute place! Coffee is good and scone was nice and crumbly. Plus they have almond milk - would be even better if they had stevia.
2017-04-01,5,Cute coffee shop with tons of beans everywhere  and knick knacks. The staff is always warm and inviting!
2017-03-05,2,Average coffee shop. Cool vibe, but coffee did not taste very good...I actually threw mine out. It had a bitter taste. I also want to note that their menu is deceiving. They charged me an extra $1 for flavor, which on the menu does not look applicable. I will not be returning.
2017-02-25,5,Great coffee and excellent service! They've been in Hoboken forever and there is definitely a "regular" crowd. Their coffee flavors change every week and you can go wrong on any but if your feeling adventurous, go for the iced Mexican spice coffee - not even sure what's in it but you won't regret your decision! Also, ask for a punch card while you're there. Every 10th drink is free!
2017-02-16,5,Favorite local coffee shop... they've got great coffee great service great products to shop around and great muffinsThe vanilla chip muffin is my fave!
2017-01-27,4,I love to support local small businesses, and this is one of my favorites in Hoboken. They're just a tiny little coffee shop, but their coffee, tea, and hot chocolate are always delicious, and their customer service is the best!The prices are comparable to any other coffee shop, and even if the line is long, it always seems to move pretty quickly.
2017-01-21,5,If you like supporting small business specialty coffee shops, this is your place. If you walk in on a sunny Saturday the line literally is nearly out the door. But with all of their specialty drinks who could be surprised? Everything here is made to order, and if I didn't like Starbucks points so much, I would come here more often. There is one coffee drink with coconut that sometimes I dream about though! Highly recommend.
2017-01-12,3,Great Coffee place to buy coffee beans. Terrible on making coffee. Sorry but if you sell you should know how to make a latte.
2017-01-02,4,When you can smell the aroma of coffee beans from half a block away, you know you're going to the right place.I'm so glad to have found Empire while staying over my friend's down the street. I was severely jet lagged after my flight in from Asia and needed 3 cups in a day to keep myself going and very glad that Empire's prices didn't break the bank.The cafe has 1-2 tables inside and around 3 tables outside. All of them are two seaters. So this isn't an ideal place where you sit down and do work. The tables are quite small too!Make sure to ask for the frequent buyer punch card! I came for two days until one of the employees noticed that I was visiting often!No minimal charge for credit cards!
2016-12-17,4,My favorite coffee shop on earth and I don't even live in Hoboken. My friend makes me bring beans from this place to south jersey... that's how good it is. If you have your own coffee maker the beans are amazing. They grind them for you. Try the mocha java... now the Mexican spice coffee is amazing if you are buying a cup to go. The staff is always friend and wonderful. They are attentive and remember what I get every time. My only gripe: I wish there was more seating especially in the summer. Also the cups and lids.. the coffee drips from the lids for some reason and it's just a terrible thing. Otherwise everything in the place is amazing .. I also adore the mugs there to buy
2016-12-17,5,Very nice small coffee shop! This is my go to place to buy my coffee beans!Staffs r very friendly Only down side is the coffee shop is very small. So it can be crowed when you have 10people waiting on line for their coffee purchase or drinks
2016-12-03,5,The best coffee in Hoboken! Love their daily roast flavors. Tried s'mores today - yum!
2016-10-12,5,Wonderful, quaint coffee shop with a huge selection of fresh roasted beans. Staff is always pleasant and willing to help you pick out beans and even create different combos. Every since discovering this place have not been able to switch back to mass-produced branded coffee!!As far as the cafe, they have a wide selection of different drinks and I've always enjoyed them. Once I brought a friend who didn't like the way hers tasted and they remade it no problems asked!!Shop also has a selection of coffee accessories like presses, mugs, filters, packaged pastries, etc!
2016-10-03,4,Great offshoot of the NYC OG, though oddly didn't smell as great.
2016-10-02,5,My Hoboken resident friend told me that this was *the spot* for coffee. The store is fun and eccentric, filled with a nice selection of teas and store-roasted beans in a wide assortment of flavors. The merchandise on display was also quirky.Had the Mexican Spiced- Snooki was ridiculously good. I love a good spiced coffee and having nutty hazelnut coffee with it was just genius. A little on the sweet side but not overbearing at all. And 3.50 for a medium cup, a total steal to this New Yorker!Will have to get some beans next time!
2016-09-27,3,I've been here several times now, given it's accessibility and convenience. As a coffee enthusiast, I would say this coffee is not bad, but also not memorable. This is not a cafe with much of a seating area, so take your coffee date elsewhere. I will say that the raw coffee beans they have for sale are quite good and not as pricy as others in Hoboken. If you are looking for a new funky coffee or espresso drink, this is your place.
2016-09-17,5,Their menu is amazing and everything was great - particularly the hot chocolate and the creme brulee latte (at least out of what I tried.)They also made things amazingly fast - which I appreciated.  They were nice too - I was running back and forth between Hoboken and Midtown like a crazy person, and several times I was juggling phone calls with ordering my coffee, and never once did they give me dirty looks or anything.
2016-09-10,5,While I am undeniably blessed that the Hoboken side of my morning commute only consists of a short walk to the PATH, the biggest downside of said commute is that Empire is not on my route. I have been a frequent visitor of this shop for years for a few reasons: the menu is extensive, the beverages never disappoint, they offer a large array of interesting snacks, their loyalty program is great (when I don't lose my loyalty card) and the staff has always been kind and helpful, providing great recommendations and awesome service. Whether I order an iced coffee or chai latte, a signature Sexy Tea or Sexy Arnold Palmer in the summer (very much recommended!) or their insanely delicious hot chocolate in the winter, I am always happy with my choice. Beyond beverages, I often stop in to purchase snacks that they sell, such as different varieties of chocolate and/or chocolate-covered items (bacon, pomegranate, salted caramel, graham crackers, etc.), for myself and my coworkers. No other coffee place in Hoboken is quite like Empire, because Empire is the complete package - a family-owned spot with a great menu and wonderful employees. I only wish there were another location closer to the PATH!
2016-08-08,5,Great coffee (and selection of coffee), decent prices, friendly service. Worth checking out if you're in the area - they have plenty of options in terms of specialty drinks as well.
2016-07-24,5,Empire's selection of coffee beans is impressive and the names/descriptions are clever and made me chuckle. They also have a pretty good loyalty program- after you buy 10lbs of beans your next lb is free. They also have a good deal on weekday AMs- small coffee and muffin for $3- which is convenient if you're passing this place on your way to the PATH. And it will taste way better than Starbucks for half the price.
2016-06-17,4,Really nice staff. We were tended to as soon as we walked in. They have a nice variety of coffee and will grind it for you if you like!  There are also other things you can buy in there like tea, mugs, cookies, and the like. The only downfall is I realized that the coffee may not be fair trade. :(  I am not entirely sure but I didn't see any signs. Also, my iced latte was okay. Perhaps too much milk to coffee ratio?  Mexican hot chocolate is deliiiicious though.
2016-05-04,5,Great local coffee spot. Wide variety of whole beans, ground to your liking. Excellent hot or cold coffee. Always great service.Don't forget to get your loyalty card punched if you are local.
2016-04-29,4,Awesome little coffee shop.  Tons of fresh roasted beans, and I was surprised at how cheap the regular hot coffee was.  Very nice staff as well!The one thing that would probably limit me from buying more fresh beans for my own cold brewing is the fact that it looked like only one of their ~2-3 dozen whole bean selection was fair trade.
2016-04-24,5,Just walking into this store makes me incredibly happy.  This is what heaven would smell like.  My wife and I start every morning with a delicious batch of freshly ground beans from this gem of a place.  Truck Stop Fiesta and Santos Brazil French Roast are our absolute favorites.  Its magical to brew your own excellent coffee every day for 11 bucks a week, far less than you would spend going to Starbucks every morning.
2016-04-12,4,After wandering Jersey City for about 6 miles, I made a pitstop at Empire Coffee and Tea company for some much needed rehydration. It was a cute tea shop off on the corner with some outdoor seating. It offers a whole bunch of teas, coffees, coffee beans, snacks and tea/coffee merchandise, like a hello kitty tea pot. The personality of the shop is eccentric and fun. I got their sexy tea, which reminded of starbuck's passion tea but twice the size for basically the same price. Very refreshing. My boyfriend got the Arnold Palmer and it was just as delicious, subduing our thirst. Overall a great place to pick up some tea and coffee.
2016-04-11,4,Great ground coffee and drinks. Can definitely go up against the Stumptowns of the world. I just wish they had more seating room inside to enjoy their delicious brews.
2016-04-10,5,This is my favorite coffee shop in Hoboken! They roast their own coffee and they are super friendly! Try their flavored coffee of the day -- you won't be disappointed.
2016-03-26,5,Hands down best coffee in all of hoboken. Almond Joy latte is my go to. Friendly staff and wide selection of whole beans to choose from. Space is a bit small but the park across the street is a great place to enjoy the coffee.
2016-03-26,5,My absolute favorite spot in Hoboken. The best coffee I've ever had. The employees are SO nice and remember your order if you are regular :) A true joy of a place. I also pick up coffee from there whenever we go away for the weekend because it's simply the best. So many different flavors and I love how they swap out their special flavors weekly / bi-weekly. Cannot say enough about this place!!!
2016-03-13,4,I'm usually not a coffee drinker, but my girlfriend is. She recommended this place and I'm so glad she did! Their coffee is rich and very flavorful. This is quality stuff.The only small downside is when my girlfriend asked the cashier if she can mix the sugar and cream herself (my girlfriend likes her coffee to have a certain amount of sugar), but the cashier didn't honor her request... and unfortunately, added more sugar than needed. Otherwise, we had a pretty decent experience and we were happy with the coffee.
2016-03-03,5,The best Americano in Hoboken, and anywhere I've ever been to be honest. I am a loyal Empire coffee drinker, it's not worth going anywhere else in Hoboken. They have a long list of specialty coffee and tea beverages but I stick to my iced Americano which is always excellent. The shop itself is amazing and welcoming. The moment you walk in you're hit with the beautiful aroma of their roasted coffee beans. While you wait in line you can browse the shelves or have a laugh at their coffee mugs. What I like most about Empire is that if they have a long line there are people behind the counter taking orders and making drinks, but also there's usually someone who will walk out to the people on line and take their drink orders. It's very efficient and shows that they care about the customers.
2016-03-02,4,The smell of coffee is in the air here!! Everything smells so fresh! With tons of beans and choices any coffee lover in the area should enjoy a fresh cup of joe from empire. I've had those pumpkin in the fall and iced Carmel in the spring or even just regular in the winter!! Never been let down!
2016-02-27,4,Best coffee in Hoboken I think, there's also not many options, at least downtown. So this compared to Starbucks or Dunkin is phenomenal. I've been to bwe uptown which is also good but since it's so far away I never go. Lattes are great ask for an extra shot if you like them a bit stronger and less heavy on the milk. They have cute little gifts too if you need a quick something for someone who is a coffee/tea drinker.
2016-02-24,4,Love their coffee but coffee spills all over me by the time I get to the path train station
2016-02-23,5,Best coffee in town. If you have never been here before, you are missing out. For a cold drink I  recommend the Mexican Chilly Chiller blended drink.  For a hot drink I recommend the Mexican Spice Coffee. Next time you're passing by, definitely stop in!
2016-02-20,5,Every morning I would walk up to Stevens Institute of Technology from Madison St past this wonderful coffee shop and grab a coffee on my way to class. I am sad that I had to move and I  no longer have the ability to go as often. The quality of the coffee is phenomenal and the service is great as well. I went so often I even was one of their VIP's and got a stamped card every time I bought a coffee. The only thing is I wish they could expand and have a seating area inside (similar to Bwe). Other then that the coffee is great and the service as well. How can you not rate this 5 STARS*****!!!!!!
2016-02-11,5,The go to for coffee in Hoboken. On weekends usually has a line out of the door.  Small establishment with good coffee and a plentiful bean selection. Different flavored brews daily.  Love this place, must go to.
2016-01-01,5,Very very good!! Loved the latte my husband and I got here.New Year's Day it was so packed. There was a line almost to the door and I felt a little rushed in the nj/ny environment. But I chose the espresso roast quickly because I LOVE espresso. They had a "k-cup grind" that was available so I can use it in my Keurig at home. I'm so excited because my latte was delicious and the owner said its the same house espresso blend that he sold me. You can get the beans whole or ground. There is also a tea room where you can choose from a lot of loose leaf teas. They looked delicious and had a lot of options!! They also had a wall full of coffee mugs, packaged teas and little candy snacks to choose from that we didn't even get to. Definitely recommend it!Ps. Second time here I got the Mexican coffee (or snooki) -- spice blend with cinnamon and cayenne I believe.  Omg so good. And pre-sweetened. Delicious! Check it out.
2015-12-17,4,You can smell the coffee the second you're near the door of Empire, a small, local coffee shop. Inside the beautiful, bright colored neighborhood shop are bins and bins of beans from all around the world with descriptions of each, as well as little chocolates, muffins, and teas. You can also order cups of coffee/tea/etc at the front counter.Prices are incredibly reasonable - most average at $10/pound for whole beans (I typically buy half a pound of one of the seasonal blends, and half a pound of the Truck Stop, which is the BEST). Incredibly friendly and helpful staff, awesome variety, and 10% discount with a check in!
2015-12-07,5,Stumbled upon this nice coffee shop while walking down Bloomfield Street. I got the Mexican Spiced Latte which consisted of cocoa powder, hazelnut and cinnamon and was an absolute delight. For a coffee lover, this is one of my favorite drinks I've ever tried. This cafe doesn't really have places to sit since many people just grab-and-go their drinks. A must try!
2015-12-02,1,I wanted to try this place having seen all the great reviews.  Just got a regular cup of coffee.  It was abysmal - watery, flavorless, undrinkable.  Had to pour most of it into a storm drain.  Not impressed.P.S. Bwe was recommended by a reviewer here as a superior place.  It isn't.  Got an espresso there and husband got a latte.  Both of us were disappointed.  Mine tasted stale.  His watery.
2015-11-14,4,I was visiting a friend in Hoboken and her husband recommended this place as it's his favorite in the area. The coffee was great and it's also a cute place with fresh coffee to buy and little snacks etc.
2015-11-14,5,The staff are so friendly and the selection  can't be beat! So much more than coffee, this shop has snacks, ice cream, chocolates, and much more!I go there for the coffee, of course, but more so to buy gifts for friends and family. Definitely check it out and see the unique selection for yourself!Five !!
2015-09-27,5,Awesome coffee shop!  Not sure why we have never ventured in here, but thank goodness we finally did! The aroma of the coffee beans is just heavenly (and I am NOT ) a coffee drinker, but a tea drinker    My daughter enjoys the specialty coffees and they have a nice selection of cookies and biscotti to go with your drink of choice.  You would definitely find a nice gift here for a hostess or the coffee or tea lover.  Seating outside to sit and relax a bit and enjoy.  Super friendly staff too.
2015-09-06,5,Shut the front door! I was walking to my car when a customer came out & left the door open and the sweet, earthy coffee smell just hit me like a puff of MJ. The aroma just lured me in like a whore to her bed. I was really surprised by this little coffee joint. Very hipster and just perfect! I approached the counter and the employee immediately offered assistance, I asked him if they had a lemonade & tea drink he said no but that he could make me one. He presented me with different teas but I stopped him by saying: Surprise me! The drink was refreshing, not too sweet and just good almost like having crack on ice... Does that exist? I couldn't leave without buying half a pound of coffee, I was happy to see they carry Ethiopian coffee beans which if you don't know it's the best coffee in the whole world. They grind the beans to your choice: regular, dark, espresso. If you check in they give you 10% discount on coffee beans. They have chairs inside and outside. Highly recommend this place. I will definitely be back!
2015-09-05,5,Not only does the coffee draw you in, but their sexy tea is also divine! Try the biscotti. It's yummy!
2015-08-11,5,Empire is the neighborhood staple coffee shop in Hoboken, and if you haven't been yet I highly recommend you do so soon! I have nothing negative to say about this place whatsoever. the service is great. the staff is super friendly, and if you frequent this cute little coffee spot, they'll be sure to memorize your signature order and know your name in no time. like many other reviews have stated, the loose teas and coffee beans are endless. not to mention, they have a tun of prepackaged gift baskets, treats, and kitchen needs, too. I usually get a cup of their drip coffee (depending on which flavors are available that week) and if I'm in the mood for something sweet I'll grab a biscotti or muffin to go with it (the biscottis are incredible as are the muffins, too). I haven't tried many of their specialty drinks but because many Yelpers recommended the Snooki (hazelnut coffee mixed with mexican chocolate spices and milk) I had to get it and it is definitely worth the hype. they also make a very good pumpkin latte during the fall. make sure to get a rewards card so that after 10 coffee purchases you get one for free! and trust me, you'll be surprised at how quickly you can rack up the points for that free coffee.literally the best neighborhood coffee spot in Hoboken. check it out!
2015-08-06,5,Great local coffee spot. Everything is awesome. Cold, hot, flavored or not. I forgot how much I missed this place having moved away.
2015-07-26,1,So not my place for a cup of tea or coffee its very small my oppinon since everyone has one the worst
2015-07-01,1,Would never come back. Last time I was here I had to wait in line forever to get a coffee.  Why? Because the two college kids behind the counter were either flirting or fighting, I couldn't tell which. The coffee tasted burnt as well. Not a fan.
2015-07-01,5,Where to begin with Empire Coffee & Tea Company. It was a Wednesday morning (today, in fact) and I was just searching for a hot beverage. Walking in, I noticed the cute and cozy atmosphere. There was baskets full of coffee beans off to the side of the shop, and there was a counter in the back. I noticed they had quite an extensive amount of tea bags above the coffee bean baskets. Back behind the counter, they had the brand "Stash" teas. I was looking at the menu and decided on London Fog tea/latte sort of thing, which I have never heard of. The friendly staff was happy to answer my questions and they told me it is Earl Grey tea (which normally I am not  a fan of), frothed milk, and a shot of vanilla. When I got my drink, I took a sip and got pure froth. I didn't like it so much, but I realized that I did get a latte. I was starting to second guess my decision. But then I took another sip. I drank the actual tea itself. It was amazing; it was the best type of tea I have ever had. Continuing to drink my tea latte, I found that I loved it more and more. I highly recommend all reading this go to Empire: it is a cute coffee and tea shop and have super friendly and nice staff.
2015-06-25,3,My father had a large cup of lemon ginger herbal tea. He enjoyed the hints of bitter lemon zest, zesty ginger, and earthy lemongrass. However, it was a commercially bought tea bag so I can't say it was flawless and extravagant.      I got a cup of banana flambé coffee which tasted like New Orleans. The sweetness of the caramelized brown sugar, the fruitiness of the banana, and then  floral hints of vanilla bean made it a cohesive cup of coffee. I would definitely come here again for some banana coffee.
2015-06-25,2,Stopped here for some tea and was met by a very friendly and helpful lady. We ordered a green tea and a lemon ginger tea. Nothing special. They have a wide variety of coffee beans that fill the place with a wonderful aroma. I love the smell of coffee. If I was still drinking coffee regularly I would have bought some beans. They have a cute place to sit outside and relax. However there is a guy there working that is so rude and no personality and the only thing he had on his face was a frown. If it wasn't for the nice lady at the counter I would have walked out and went to the over commercialized Starbucks because at least their employees are smiling and happy!
2015-05-13,3,They have a great selection of teas. I have to give them that. However, it really bothers me when coffee places have coffee beans exposed to the elements and sitting in open sacks. Beans lose their quality by having them exposed like that -- quite simply, they dry out. I don't know if they cover them up at the end of the night or what, but its just not the way coffee beans should be sold. The coffee selection (the ones they make) are okay. They have different flavors and special lattes. I like their location and the people that work there are super nice.
2015-04-30,5,Absolutely LOVE Empire! Definitely the best coffee around, great service, and fun options. The Mexican Spice coffee is my favorite! Wish I could come here every morning!
2015-04-28,2,Sorry, wish that I could say that my first coffee experience in Hoboken was better after leaving seattle but my coffee order got botched, then they got defensive when I called them on it. But most of all, it was just a bad, burnt, over-heated latte. Even starbucks could do better and they suck.
2015-04-10,5,I wish I could come here more! Starbucks and Dunkin' are just so much more convenient. This is the perfect place to stop on a Sunday morning/afternoon while walking around on a nice day. They have some of the freshest and best grinds I've ever tasted. Support your local coffee shop!
2015-04-03,4,So quaint!  RRRRMAAAZIng cappuchino.  Nice selection of teas and accoutrements for tea time, like Walkers Shortbread.  For those Downton abbey fans they have tins of tea with the characters on it. Including one with Lord Grantham who looks just like my friend Damien. #FancyEnglishmen #ILiveUpstairs #YouLiveDownstairs
2015-04-02,4,Just like their New York City location, here you will also find a fine variety of whole bean coffee and a wide selection of teas. I particularly love their Colombian Supremo Vienna roast and the Decaf Mocha Deluxe French roast. Ask about their BUY 10 pounds GET 1 pound Free card if you are a regular ;)
2015-03-29,5,GREAT selection of lattes, consistently friendly and efficient service, my only complaint is that I wish it was bigger and had more seating to relax and enjoy the delicious drink offerings. Also fun to peruse the chocolate, tea, and coffee bean selections. Two thumbs up :)
2015-03-20,5,I don't know how they do it...but I'm glad they do! Empire Coffee is the perfect mix of "upscale, high quality" and "friendly, chill vibe". Perfect to get interesting, unique coffee and food gifts for someone (or yourself!) and also perfect to just grab a quick coffee on your way too work.I have been a loyal customer for years and will continue to be for years to come!
2015-02-18,4,Excellent place to buy tea or coffee, kind and warm service. Cozy place but limited seating.  Not my favorite latte, however, come here to buy decaf tea or coffee blends. Lots of coffee and tea accessories for sale in store.  Smells delightful when you walk in and smell the bags of coffee beans.
2015-02-09,3,Their coffee and tea choices are numerous and delicious! The only negative I would say is that for a coffee shop, it is really more of a pick up and go; there is hardly any room for sitting and chatting. I had the seasonal Apple Cider Chai tea - amazing! AJ had the Red Velvet Latte, which was good but not as sweet as you would think. This is a great unique, Hoboken coffee shop but not the place to meet up with friends or colleagues.
2015-02-09,5,This place makes me so happy for a variety of reasons.They carry my favorite tea brand, Republic of Tea, and they even get the seasonal varieties in (hello Pumpkin Spice!). I'm always stopping in to try out a new flavor.Empire also has a great loose tea room in the back of the store. The selection is varied and the price is great for a good-sized package of loose leaf. The staff is friendly and they'll help you find what you're looking for.This is a good spot to pick up a last-minute gift for anyone who loves coffee, tea, chocolate, or specialty snacks. I've done this a couple of times myself on my way out to a birthday party. Gift dilemma solved!
2015-01-18,4,Love this place, great coffee, teas, lattes, etc. Two downsides-no seating and their hours aren't great for a coffee shop. Would love to stop in here on my way to work but it doesn't open until 7:30am during the work week and much later on weekends. Open earlier and I'm sure your business will increase! Walking into this place just smells like heaven for all coffee drinkers, stop by.
2015-01-16,4,Amazing selection of legit beans and all things hot beverage-related. Seriously. They have 20 bags of beans on the display and a whole wall of mugs, kettles and other bric and brac. One point for lack of seating. Otherwise this is THE Starbucks killer in town.
2014-12-28,4,They are always friendly here and entertain my constant barrage of questions. My family loves coffee so I always pick up a few half pounds before going home. I've only personally had the coffee a couple times, and some flavors are better than other. I've gotten mixed reviews from family, but I think it all depends on personal preference. It smells divine when you walk in, which is always an added benefit. I did purchase one of their flavored lattes the last time I stopped in, it was just ok in my opinion. Still love coming here and learning more about all their coffees!
2014-11-29,5,Best coffee in Hoboken! Love this place! Always bring home ground coffee for my parents and they love it. I always get a latte and every time is delicious! Highly recommend this place. Wish they were open a bit earlier on the weekend.
2014-11-08,1,NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.  Recently stopped in to find a nice alternative to Starbucks.  The minute my 3 year old got near the coffee beans on the wall, however, the rude woman behind the register began yelling at her and us.  And she continued to get worse.  Wow, you would think a neighborhood coffee shop would be a bit friendlier to its neighbors.
2014-11-01,1,A coffee shop that doesn't take credit under $5 is about as useful to me as a chocolate covered tire.
2014-10-22,4,I love this small, cozy, and quaint coffee stop in Hoboken, NJ. They have a huge selection of coffee to grab on the go or even beans to take home. Whenever I spend the night in Hoboken, or happen to find a spot (miserable part about hobo) by this spot, I always have to stop in, no matter what time of day.My favorite is the Nutella Latte... pure perfection if you ask me!
2014-09-25,5,Where do I even start? So many thoughts enter my mind when I think of Empire, the most prominent being 'when am I going next?' But I'll begin with the smell that encompasses your olfactory glands when you get close to 4th and bloom. Already, you're drawn in, and even if you're not a coffee drinker (which was me a year ago), your nose and interest has just perked up. It doesn't just smell like coffee. It smells like Santa giving the Easter bunny a hug on the first day of summer. With butterflies and puppies somewhere in there.Enter and you'll be surprised to find a wall of loose coffee beans, and the selection will astound you. I've been a tea person my whole life until this past year, and I strongly feel that (besides my job) Empire has made a vital impact on my lifestyle change. I've considered investing in a fancy coffee maker just to try out all the flavors they have on display.You're greeted by the friendly and (now) familiar faces of the staff, who are ALWAYS smiling. Although now that I reread my review, I understand why. They are so happy to help you, and if you ask them for suggestions, they will not steer you wrong! The extensive and supremely creative beverage menu alone may either inspire you or intimidate you, but the people who work there are pleased and patient to assist you. I've gone in more than once and just asked them to make me something tasty (like an underage chick's first time at a bar). They've nailed it every time. However, I've now found my favorite seasonal drinks... The Apple spiced chai, which is on the fall menu, and a special coffee that Danielle made for me, which is not on the menu. I've asked everyone there to recreate it, and they do it, no questions asked. It's iced coffee with hazelnut syrup, soy milk, and vanilla powder. Perfection in liquid form.Empire will make you a believer of incredible coffee. And if you don't believe me, I'll meet you there and buy your first cup. It will be a great excuse to try another masterpiece recipe.
2014-09-09,4,Good coffee, great staff.  If you come here regularly for coffee, the $10 tumbler pays for itself pretty fast through the $1 refills they offer.  There are lots of nifty cookie options, too, but the best part is the variety of coffee beans on offer.  Try the Tanzanian Peaberry!
2014-08-17,4,My fiancée and I recently discovered Empire and it's now our go-to place for whole coffee beans. The coconut is delicious! I also took a peak in the back room that houses all of their teas - a pretty extensive collection! Can't wait to go back for some loose leaf tea!
2014-08-02,4,Great coffee shop. Their cappuccino is perfect and there are many other options to try out. It's also very quiet on Saturday morning
2014-07-13,5,By far the best coffee place I've ever been too! I travel a lot and have been to small mom and pop coffee shops, but this one is above everyone. The employees are all amazing. They have my coffee ready before I even get to the counter. It's cheap! Way cheaper than a Starbucks or even DD and the quality of the coffee is so much better! So many varieties of coffee to choose from, it can make your decision difficult. The atmosphere is great, very chill and relaxing. A must go!
2014-07-08,4,Their ice coffee / coffee paired with the blueberry scones / or muffins are to die! It's very quiet here Saturday mornings  even with their proximity to the park. Grab a seat in the front, they have outdoor seating tables. Plus they are open early.
2014-04-25,3,I felt a little bad about my previous review because all my interactions with the people at Empire have been great, including the owner response to my less-than-accurate review regarding the freshness of the beans. However, I'm going to stick with my 3 star review. The vast majority of their coffee beans are either blends, flavored coffee or dark roasts -- all of which are major no-nos if you are a coffee snob. But in my humble opinion, "good" coffee is a lightly roasted, single-origin coffee, of which Empire only sells about 5. And among those 5, only 1 was of African origin, which happens to be my favorite. So basically I was left with only one option at Empire. Darkly roasting beans masks the natural characteristics of a particular type of bean, so you end up tasting the roast and not the bean. The one coffee that I did end up buying -- the Ethiopian Harrar -- was pretty good brewed on my pour over dripper. Lightly roasted, single origin. Very good price for it. Something similar would be 50% more expensive from a specialty roaster.I understand most people out there are not coffee snobs and businesses which cater to these folks need to exist. But if you run a business, you choose who your target customer base is and perhaps I prefer to go to businesses that assume their customers have discriminating tastes and not ones that target the mass market. I think Empire could benefit from the surge of interest in single-origin coffees by getting rid of 5-10 of their crap beans like the flavored garbage and some of the blends, and adding some more single-origins.
2014-04-10,4,Is it possible to always have a smooth cup of coffee ready? Yup! It sure is at Empire. Now, I must say, the drips they serve almost always taste the same no matter what the flavor is but at least they taste great. Their beans on the other hand, are made to perfection. I've tried several varieties and I really love them. Great prices for a cup of coffee and beans, as well. Staff is extremely friendly, welcoming & will answer any question. Glad they're here.
2014-04-07,2,Walking by this place was like heaven as the aroma of what smelled like vanilla coffee hit me like cupids arrow. My boo and I went in and we got a caramel latte and a chocolate, caramel latte. We walked out and took a sip. Disappointed :( it was OK.. nothing special, I would of been more pleased with a DD caramel latte.
2014-03-20,5,The coffee from Empire is in a word...awesome. I'm currently enjoying a signature latté, in this case Nutella. It's quite sweet, and for five bucks after tax, not a bad deal. I was a regular when I lived in my old apartment in midtown Hoboken and the folks that worked there still remember me and my order despite the fact that I moved last year and haven't been in nearly as often. This says a lot about the people who work here. They are super nice and pleasant. Once it was really busy and I left a bag with like $100 worth of records from Tunes in there. They made sure to keep it behind the counter for me until I returned like 15 minutes later freaking out. This proves that they both are cool people to do that and attract a clientele that is awesome enough not to steal people's stuff. As you can tell, it's a really cute little shop. I'm not exactly one for cute little shops, but something about Empire says "come in and check me out!". The most impressive thing about Empire is the variety of full bean coffee in bags on the floor ready for purchase or grinding on the spot. It's fairly priced and really good. I've never counted the blends, but there's a lot. I noted there's an Obama Blend. I guess you need to be President to have a blend of coffee...so my dream of a Carl Blend will never happen. This saddens me. There is a Snooki Latté so maybe if I do something crazy on reality TV, there's hope for me yet. There's a smaller tea room in the back with loose teas. Check it out. It's a hidden gem. Also there's a lot of cute mugs that I know could definitely fit the criteria for that "last minute mom birthday gift tiny add on" if need be.By the way, to quote George Carlin, "I don't do transitional material".
2014-03-09,5,LOVE THIS PLACE!  We can't get enough of their coffee.  We buy beans once a week and then always get a coffee or latte to go as well.  It's a perfect local coffee shop with excellent products and excellent service.As for the gourmet food selection - I did a lot of my Christmas shopping here.  I even was able to put together my own gift basket with all sorts of coffees, cookies, hot cocoa, and other treats.
2014-03-08,3,Not the best chai latte I've had but also not the worst. Plus for having outdoor seating and giant chocolate scones.
2014-03-06,4,good capuccino freshly roasted coffee
2014-02-15,5,Quite possibly one of the best coffee bean shops west of the Hudson... and that covers a lot of ground. Empire has an eclectic collection of whole beans for purchase along with some interesting combinations for lattes, hot and iced coffee. I have been getting whole beans by the half-pound/pound for the better part if a year now and, admittedly some are much better than other, but the choices are rather epic, for lack of a better word. It's a bit of a process to find your favorite, but it's kind of a magical moment when it happens.
2014-01-21,4,I love the coffee from this place, I just haven't been able to have any since I had my son.. Super difficult to get in with a carriage :(
2014-01-12,5,Delicious! It's so great to be able to support a local small business with a quality product. The menu is outrageously awesome with so many different thing to try each time. We are big fans of the coconut hot chocolate and the soy chai tea latte. The people who work there are always incredibly kind and laid back (even when the place is mobbed!)
2013-12-26,4,I love walking into Empire and smelling all the open roasted coffee bags that line the wall. Empire has good coffee and friendly service. They also have a nice collection of coffee items, such as coffee cups, kettles, grinders etc. I usually make my own coffee at home but if I don't have time I will usually get a cup at Empire.
2013-11-08,4,Cute little cafe with a variety of coffee & tea. It really is like coffee heaven. I wish the place had more seats to sit down inside but most of the space is taking up by the coffee bags. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. I had the soy vanilla latte which was absolutely delicious and a vanilla chocolate chip muffin that I will be back for.
2013-10-29,4,I think Starbucks filed a missing persons report on at me after I discovered this little gem in my area! Now that I have the Empire, I don't need the evil empire.This place roasts their own beans, and they have a huge variety--both flavored and regular--all at a reasonable price (most are $10/pound). They also make great coffee and espresso drinks. One of my favorites is the Snooki. Their plain drip coffee is also very good. They usually have a regular and a couple flavors on hand every day. And at $1.75 (including tax) for a medium it's very well priced.When you walk in, to your left is a wall (and floor) of coffee beans in sacks and shelves of tea. On the right is a wall of candy, cookies, jam and other specialty products. If you want coffee beans, ask one of the helpful staff at the counter. The beans are not self-serve, but the staff (who are great!) will get them (and grind them, if required) for you in no time!Make sure you get their punch cards--one for beans, one for drinks. For each, after you buy 10, you get one free.Credit cards accepted, they request a $10 minimum purchase for using them.I only wish the place was bigger, as I'd love to be able to take a seat and spend some time there, but there are only a couple tables inside and a few outside, and it's not really conducive to hanging out.
2013-10-21,5,The people here are good, and the knowledgeable guy worked with me to find a blend comparable with my favorite coffee from where I used to live. The blend he made tastes really good, and a few dollars less in price than the original he tried to match. You can also get a good range here, including Blue Mountain. There are a lot of teas and other goodies, too, but I go for the coffee beans. Glad I can walk here rather than go further.
2013-10-20,4,I generally come to this place for their ground coffee which I have them grind for my French press.  So far my favorite has been the Hangover Blend, although I also like the Pumpkin Spice coffee.  I also like the fancy chocolate, pastries, trinkets they have over there...seems like a nice place to stop and sit.I've only bought an actual cup of coffee there once (or maybe twice)  a while ago... some specialty drink named after snookie or some other Jersey Shore star.  It was nothing special...I imagine their average cup of coffee is pretty good since the coffee I've been buying is good quality.
2013-10-14,4,Very cute coffee boutique. I ordered the pumpkin spice coffee with milk. Pretty decent. The place is set up really nice and the girls working there were friendly. They have a small seating area and on a nice night they open up the doors and it extends to the outside. Great prices!
2013-09-24,5,I highly recommend their Red Velvet Latte (white chocolate & raspberry)! My favorite so far :)
2013-09-09,1,Oh my goodness, why all the great reviews?  The coffee here was SO bad!  I got a cappuccino and my friend got an Iced Americano and we both ended up tossing them.  So sad.
2013-08-23,4,Friendly staff. Same price as Starbucks. Seating indoors and outdoors. It's quiet on that block, so you can definitely get some work done. I wouldn't say their tea and coffee is exceptional, but it's good. Just ask for the wi-fi password if you need it.  $5+ for a credit card.
2013-08-11,4,The Sexy Tea is on point - do yourself a favor and order one! I can't guarantee you'll feel "sexy" but your taste buds will thank you. One word - TASTY! But seriously, this place is great for tourists (like myself) or locals. Its an awesome, eclectic, little spot :)
2013-08-11,5,Nice cozy area where you can actually purchase some authentic blue mountain coffee.
2013-08-04,5,My fiance and I actually met back in college when we both worked part-time as baristas at a Starbucks.  So, needless to say, we are fairly picky about coffee shops.  This place is great!  The staff is always incredibly friendly and make you feel like part of the family.  The atmosphere is great, as is the vast selection of drinks and beans. If you're looking for a place to grab a nice cup of coffee and relax, this is the place to go!
2013-08-03,4,Not a place to get coffee and sit, but a fantastic place to buy beans & a cup to-go.  Staff is wonderfully friendly and is a great help in selecting from their fun varieties of beans.I really wish they had a seating area, it really is something missing in Hoboken: a local coffee spot to chat or use your laptop.
2013-07-16,4,Cute corner shop!! The coffee was good. I had an iced dirty chai and it was tasty. It was a hot and humid day, so I'm glad it was cool inside. I was visiting the Hoboken area and I will return.
2013-07-12,4,very welcoming and homey, nice staff.lots of "check in" benefits - ie free coffee, $ off of coffee beans.HUGE selection of beans - no touching though :( small assortment of grinders, coffee machines, and other product.we have tried 4 different coffee beans and have liked all of them. We have also had a few of their menu items and have been pleased.
2013-06-30,4,I pop in here for a cup and a snack on occasion. They have beans and an assortment of cookies/bars and candy for snacking. There is also outdoor seating . Oh yea and they make a great cup of bean!
2013-06-18,4,I make an effort to stop by here on the weekend while I am running errands and the staff is always friendly and their coffee is great. I'm going with 4 stars because their lines tend to be long and slightly slow, they are occasionally out of things, or they quickly forget about my request for skim and give me 2% or whole (which I don' notice until I am down the block). They also have annoying hours so this place is not for the super early bird.
2013-05-18,3,Good but not great.I like that its not a massive chain, but I think if you are willing to walk a bit you could find better small coffee shops in the neighborhood. They pretty much brew your average teas and flavored coffees but give them cute names. I like the big selection of teas and that they brew their own coffee, but I really haven't loved anything I've tried. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Brian C. order "Can I have a Sexy Tea please?" Haha. It was good but nothing too special just a basic sweet passion fruit blend. Personally, I think brewing the basic Tazo Passion Tea at home tastes better.They have delicious sounding dessert flavored lattes like Red Velvet, Almond Joy, and Creme Brulee, but the one I tried just tasted like really synthetic flavored syrup and was not delicious at all. There's not much by way of seating, so its really not a place you can sit and hang around either. Good place to see a good variety of teas in one place though.
2013-05-17,1,May be the single worst latte I've ever had. Barista just scooped coffee into the basket and didn't tamp it down.  She just leveled it off and used it. Tasted like a bizarre cup of bad coffee rather than a latte so unfortunately it went to the trashcan as I walked out.  Maybe their drip coffee is okay?  But it's brewed on a circa 1970's bun office type coffee pot that's not using pre-infusion type technology you'll find at more modernized coffee shops.
2013-03-10,4,While I hate admitting it, I'm a frequent flyer at Starf*cks. Not because I like it...they snared me with that damn app that lets me pay with my phone.That said, when I'm down by Fourth Street I make it a point to stop at Empire. Small on the inside, this place is bursting with whole bean coffee varieties for your homebrewing pleasure. As far as drink options, they have a handful of flavor varieties brewing daily. If lattes or hot chocolate are your thing, there are several varieties of each available in creative combos like white chocolate coconut.Only real downside in my book is limited seating. This place fills up fast, making it a little hard to come here to get work done.
2013-02-27,2,Atmosphere is nice manager name Abby has a bad attitude poor customer service.
2013-01-31,5,I found Empire Coffee about 3 years ago; literally because it was so close to my daughter's school...prior to that I was always a Starbucks junkie.     Empire was love at first sight for me.    The staff is wonderful and while it can get a little crazy; everyone is fast and efficient!My absolutely favorite thing is getting coffee beans there.  They actually roast their own beans and I've never had anything better.  EVER!     They've got great gift baskets and it's the perfect place to get someone else a little thoughtful "something" - as a rule; I always bring fresh ground coffee when visiting my dad as he LOVES it too!Empire is a must have and Abbe and Paul (the owners) are spectacular people and always have a smile on their face!   Their son can often be found there and he's a total cutie too!
2013-01-25,4,Best place in town to buy ground coffee beans.  Huge selection of dark, light, blends, etc.  If you like flavored coffees, some of the good ones are the Swiss Chocolate Almond and the Yummy Caramel.  They have a few Kona's that are super expensive.  There are a few tables inside and a few outside, but I wish they had more space for seating/hanging out.As a bonus, they also sell some coffee/tea accessories and even some gourmet foods and even Hoboken Eddie's barbecue sauces.
2013-01-22,5,A frequent stop on my afternoon walk and a great place to get an excellent cup of coffee  The staff is always friendly and helpful. $2 for a large coffee and some creative flavors and options also.  Plus they have an extensive selection (at least 25 different flavors) of coffee beans that they will grind for you. My current favorite is the Hoboken Blend.
2012-12-30,5,There is nothing bad to say about Empire. I love local places, coffee and nice people and Empire has all of the above and then some. Starbucks can kiss it asking almost 3 bucks for a regular cup of coffee and dunkin just isn't the best in my opinion. Empire always has a great selection of coffee and for 2 bucks a large..and I love ordering a large coffee not a wannabe trendy Italian word for large. They also have the typical lattes and stuff, but I like coffee flavored coffee and don't drink that stuff (opinion alert.) In my opinion the larger your coffee order the bigger the a-hole. Anyway...they have a great selection of coffee to take home at 10-12 bucks a pound and they will grind it for you. They also roast their own beans. They have a great assortment of coffee/tea accessories and cute little gifts and things like that. It's a small place, but there are a few tables outside.The staff are always amazing, and knowledgeable they are always smiling and friendly. They have muffins, scones and what not but they aren't made there, either way they're the right price and tasty!
2012-12-26,4,I'm an unabashed evangelist for this place and you will be, too! Please, quit that Starbucks sh*t and support this place. A quaint coffee shop with a kind staff, creative menu, and bags heaping with beans from around the world. I mostly stick to coffee and appreciate that there's always a few different choices every time I visit. If I feel like I've earned it then I'll treat myself to one of the lattes, which are rich, sweet, and downright decadent. There are plenty of bean options for whatever your palette is into with grinding on-site. There is also a nice selection of teas and treats. They do have a tea room but I always forget it's back there until it's too late and I've purchased the packaged kind. The staff is usually wonderful and helpful, and always friendly. The turnover doesn't seem to be too regular either, which tells me people enjoy working there. Always a good sign. Some of the longer tenured employees have my order fixed before I even get to the counter, and it's the little things like that help make the world a better place. There is a tall guy with glasses who has a good sense of humor and an endless supply of hilarious T-shirts. The staff also (usually) has good taste in music. It is not uncommon for the staff to get the door for you if you're hands are full or help a stroller in and out.As much as I love Empire and am proud to support it, there are a couple minor frustrations. There's not much seating and even less when it's cold out. Empire isn't a place to hunker down although the lucky few that can get one of the tables seem to make a go of it. There is a park across the street and another two blocks past Washington on Fourth. The waterfront is just past there, too. If you hit Empire at a peak time then you may be waiting a bit. This is no fault of the shop, they can't help that people love them but if you're in a hurry then realize it may not be possible on a Sunday morning. Things seem to run smoothly during the weekday commuter mornings. I could also stand for some more food options. There is always a selection of muffins and biscotti, but can a brother get some croissants?Sadly, neighborhood places like this - especially if they don't serve booze - are an endangered species in Hoboken and like cities/towns. I'm proud to support it and hope you will be, too. Take care of our own and enjoy good coffee.
2012-12-25,5,My favorite coffee shop in Hoboken. Truly a staple. I always take out-of-towners here and they love it.
2012-12-16,5,The aroma from Empire Coffee has now become a familiar scent in Hoboken. You could be walking in the neighborhood, and even if you weren't craving a cup, you will begin to. They have a wonderful selection of coffee ranging from Ethiopian to regional blends, the trouble will be deciding which delectable beans you want to take home with you. No worries if you cannot make up your mind, their friendly staff are always there to offer a few suggestions. They will grind it for your specific needs, and since it is unlikely you will be a one time only visitor, I recommend picking up a loyalty card. You can earn your way to to a free bag of coffee. For those who prefer teas, they have plenty of those as well. I love visiting around Christmas time to load up on coffee for me and gadgets for family and friends. If you're in Hoboken and in need of a break, be sure to stop by at Empire for a cup of amazing coffee and a biscotti. They even have seating if you have enough time to actually sit and sip your coffee - a much quieter scene than the overcrowded Starbucks.
2012-12-15,4,NotGreat forFreelancingBut coffee, tea,and snacks are grade A. Good way to start day.
2012-12-14,5,Best coffee shop in Hoboken. Usually have 5 different brews on any given day, with standard light/medium/dark roasts and a seasonal flavor or two. Empire is also a must visit if you like to brew your own coffee at home - they must have at least 25 different types of coffee beans that they will grind and bag for you.It's cheaper than a Starbucks/DD, and has better coffee than both places, so it's quite literally a no-brainer that Empire is the place to get your caffeine.
2012-11-10,5,I happen to be in Weehawken visiting from Los Angeles while the hubby is doing business here. I visited Empire four times in the few days I was here. First time we got small Mexican hot chocolates, Snooki style (with hazelnut syrup) and soy milk. Yum! It was so good, we kept sipping and looking back at the cups like, "Really? It's THAT good?" It was.All the other times after, it was "the largest cup you got" for us! Service was superbly accommodating and the vibe was very welcoming. This is my favo chill out spot in Hoboken, so far. I wanna try their teas, but can't bring myself to not order my chocolate...
2012-11-04,4,My first mission when I found out Hoboken would be my new working grounds was to find a coffee shop. Sure DD and Starbucks are closer but I'll be dammed if I drink that everyday. Then there was Empire. Just a block and a half walk away. During the week, their opening hours are perfect. I'll be honest as their weekend opening hours are a little late (9am) but lets face it, I'll wait just so they can fix me my morning cup of joe. Service is great. Drinks are made quickly. They have punch cards. Their prices are hella reasonable so it makes the $5 minimum purchase for plastic seem impossible.  Their variety of coffee available is endless, and they also have fancy coffee bevies such as a Milky Way or Nutella. A coworker said their iced teas are also quite magical. Is it summer yet?! This green corner shop is my Hoboken coffee oasis.
2012-11-03,5,After Hurricane Sandy, they were giving out small coffees for free and mediums and larges for $1.  Ordinary prices are just as fair -- $2 for a large!  Really gained a lot of respect and appreciation from me for their post-Hurricane response.
2012-10-25,5,Best place for coffee in Hoboken.  I wish I lived a bit closer honestly.
2012-10-08,5,fantastic coffee shop right next to church square park. As you can tell from the pics, the store offers a bunch varieties of whole bean coffee and their own brews to order. I ordered the Redeye, very smooth and strong.
2012-09-14,5,delicious coffee.  loads of variety (coffee, espresso drinks, lattes, tea, ground coffee to go). fast, friendly service. cute shop in great location. completely reasonable prices.mexican spice and graham cracker make my taste buds melt.what more could one possibly want? so happy there's a solid alternative to starbucks out there! love it!
2012-09-13,4,Update- I am lowering by a star, because I feel the quality of their coffee has gone down a bit. What's happening Empire? Why is the coffee so weak now? I miss going everyday for my coffee and Almond Poppy muffin!!Love their coffee. Love looking at all the stuff they have for sale in their little shop. The staff is amazing and friendly! I'm so afraid places like this will close because of starbucks and d&d.  Especially because their quality is so much better!
2012-09-04,4,As I said in my earlier review, the coffee here is great and the staff is super friendly.  However, they should seriously consider changing their hours of operation to accommodate people who drink coffee in the morning and/or on their way to work (aka, the whole world).  How can you justify opening up at 9am on the weekends?  Way too late!  From a business perspective, Empire may be losing customers to Starbucks and D&D by opening up so late.  Gotta give the people what they want.
2012-09-02,4,This is my favorite place for to-go coffee in Hoboken. They have creative latte flavors like Red Velvet, Creme Brulee, and The Snooki. I regularly visit to get fresh-ground fair trade beans to make coffee at home in my french press. Prices seem average but the quality of ingredients is definitely superior to Starbucks. Another perk is they give rewards cards for purchasing ground coffee and drinks.The only drawbacks are that it's a small space so you if you want to stay and chat you have to hope one of the three tables outside is available (during the warm months), and the line can be out the door on weekends, but it is worth the wait!Another tip: They prefer cash if you spend less than $5.
2012-07-30,5,I make a trip here just to get my coffee and tea.TruckStop blend.Excellent.I also buy the ONLY tea ...Assam.I always have some iced Assam, (so friggin A that they have this available) with some vanilla soy and chill for a little bit before heading home.Very cute corner shop w some coffee or tea accouterments and outside seating area.
2012-07-12,4,Feeling nostalgic for home...love love love LOVE EMPIRE!!!I used to stop here every bitter morning for a hazelnut soy misto. The people who work here are so sweet, and the coffee is inexpensive. They also sell beans, as well as pastries and snacks. There's a few tables outside too.I'm a Starbucks slore, but Empire is definitely hip and indie. And they usually have fun coffee flavors brewed (gingerbread? yes. eggnog? DOUBLE YES.)see you LDW, empire!
2012-06-22,4,Empire is my go-to coffee shop in Hoboken.  Great coffee, friendly service.  Generally, I just get a regular coffee.  My fiance gets one of several hot chocolates.To bring home, Truckstop Fiesta & (when available) the Obama Blend are my favorites!
2012-06-12,4,Great alternative to starbucks (which is a good idea by itself any day). Also, tons (and I means like 40 bags tons) of coffee beans to bring home if brewing your own coffee is your thing.Support your local coffee shop instead of Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks!
2012-05-13,5,Place is the best in Hoboken!.  My girlfriend and I go the quite a bit and it never disappoints.  One thing I like is that there are not thrills to mask the coffee.  Their coffee has great flavor and is very rich.  My girlfriend gets their lattes and is in love.  Her new drink is the green tea latte.  Overall this place is wonderful and will continue to go back.
2012-04-04,4,This place. Hm, I go to school near here so in my free periods I skip over to this cute little place for a little refresher...The 'Red Velvet Latte' or whatever it's called is quite good. The place has an array of exotic choices and there are bags of coffee beans lining the entire wall! (How chic)They also sell an assortment of chocolates--I get the chai tea infused one but there are SO many choices.Such a cute place, great coffee is you're one to avoid Starbucks. Much recommended!
2012-04-03,4,I have been going here for many years now, and I really appreciate this place.  They have a great selection of coffee of the whole bean variety, and are knowlegible about their stock.  Their chotchy-wears are sometimes a bit much for me, but the little gifts are some nice ideas.  Their tea selection isn't bad, and I've really enjoyed some Darjeeling I splurged on when I was there last.  Its a different attitude in this place, some good and some bad. Their low stress, easy going nature is great, but the carelessness sometimes is reflected in their drink preparation. On more than one occasion, their flavored lattes (this is hear-say from my bf) were not mixed well.  Additionally, I find their espresso to be a little too caustic for my liking.  All in all though, I really am glad Empire breaks the mold of Hoboken's trend of coffee joints.  Check it out for a chance to try really anything you like.
2012-03-20,5,coffee coffee ..very close to my apartment and I enjoy every second of itwhen you walk in, on the floor is coffee beans every where. The staff every attentiveand will help you through what ever "HOT BEAN JUICE' you need. only complaintI have is i wish it was open later other than that. In the town of drunken frat boysEmpire stand alone to prove there are still GEMS in hobokendo they have blue mountain coffee from Jamaica??? umm they do if you one of those BIG SPENDERS.. ...best coffee in the world IMO
2012-03-09,4,Super cool coffee spot off Washington street in downtown Hoboken. Just a few tables inside with a few tables outside as well. Super chill, coffee bean oriented place with a nice array of biscotti and what looked to be super moist and delicious muffins.  There are huge barrels/bags of fresh coffee beans from around the world and you can purchase them by the lb and half pound and grind them on the spot.The prices are BEYOND reasonable, one may say cheap. My medium coffee was $1.75 with $.50 additional for an expresso shot. It was good but I do think the coffee was a wee bit old (it didn't taste too fresh). To give it up though, I came in at 4:00 on a Friday afternoon, I'm sure they didn't just make that pot of coffee.I'll most definitely come back when I'm in the hood and need a little pick me up or if I need some good coffee at home, fresh beans to go!
2012-03-01,4,I love this place! Before I moved to Hoboken I would visit my cousin and HAVE to go here. The atmosphere is great and I love the Snooki! They also have great little snacks and gifts for the holidays. And if you like good and exotic coffee beans this is the place to go, they will grind it there for you.
2012-02-24,4,great priced coffee, and wonderful staff.  my only qualm is that while they have wifi and outdoor seating, but this place is probably best served as a grab and go place (limited seating).  the custom lattes + teas make it so i would prefer to come here over the starbucks nearby!
2012-02-18,4,you want all kinds of flavors of coffee beans? you want a whole room dedicated to loose tea? well, comrade, this is your spot.prices are great. $1.70 for a medium coffee. I went for the cinnamon Vienna blend, which had that perfect mix of sweetness and bitterness that you look for in coffee.staff are friendly and helpful.this is definitely one of the great places you'll find by venturing off the beaten path of Washington Street in Hoboken.
2012-01-31,2,I had tried the other location in Manhattan a few days ago, and I was excited to hear that there is an Empire Coffee in Hoboken as well.  So I went, thinking that the experience would be similar.Unfortunately, I had what was probably one of the worst coffees I've ever had.  I got a decaf mocha, and it was already LUKEWARM to begin with.  There was little to no froth (the other place had a lot, which was cool), and by the time I got to the chocolate part, it was still really watery and had little to no mocha flavor.  What kind of a mess was this?  Not to mention that a small was more expensive than the one in Manhattan -- I paid under $3 while here it was around $3.25 + taxI also got a chocolate muffin for $1.89 - it was pretty chocolately and all right.  But that still did not make up for the horrible cup of coffee.Too bad - the atmosphere of this place is really cute, with the snacks and coffee beans for sale.
2012-01-24,2,Honestly, it's just OKAY. I like the "atmosphere" at empire. And I think that is what a lot of people get hung up on. And the location is pretty good.. close to the park, close enough to my apartment, on my walk to work - which is why even though it is mediocre, I will still go. Really, the coffee is pretty watered down. And the lattes and flavored drinks are wayy to sweet. Their flavors are all syrups. Maroon is MUCH better... if only they had a better ambiance there. They are a little more off the beaten path, but worth going. The owners there know their stuff, make everything to order, and their flavored coffees are brewed - not just added syrups. Overall, sorry Empire, you are overrated.
2012-01-21,2,We went to Empire after a long walk up from Jersey City on a cool, but pleasant weekend morning in early January. We wanted to get a cup of coffee during our long stroll and to warm up, and wanted to avoid Starbucks, so there we were.The baristas were nice enough, but distracted, acting somewhat like they just don't like working there. The one guy screwed up one of the drinks pretty bad (coffee with cream and no sugar turned into a shot of hazelnut syrup and a lot of sugar), and the one that was correct tasted burned. While they were gracious enough to correct the beverage, the end result was a sub-par cup of coffee anyway.The store devotes quite a bit of space to gifts and novelties, and the coffee shop part is almost a second thought. There is very little seating, and what there is is pretty uncomfortable. While I do appreciate that they're trying to make a buck and not fall into the swill of being just another coffee shop, the entire experience was tremendously lackluster.End result: decent in a pinch, but I'd actually rather go to Starbucks. Huh.
2011-12-05,5,Great coffee drinks and lots of coffee beans to make your own.  Plus tons of cute mugs and tea pots, etc.  Great local alternative to Starbucks :)  Not really much seating, but in the summer there is some outdoor seating.
2011-11-30,4,I love Empire! I have to try to resist every day on my way to work! They have a punch card for buy 10 drinks get one free or buy 10 pounds of coffee get one free. They have great pumpkin spice coffee and their other flavors are good. I buy my coffee beans there because they are much cheaper than other chain coffee stores (ahem..).The only thing I wish they had was more room to sit and take advantage of the Wifi, but it is a small space.
2011-11-29,5,Empire is one of the most amazing places I have been to in terms of coffee beverages...for almost the same price (and sometimes even less) than starbucks you get a made to order latte/tea or coffee !!!! In a world of serve yourself coffees and teas with only a handful of run down options it is so refreshing to come to a place where they learn your name, the way you like your coffee and serve it to you HOT! They make a fresh pot every 7-10 minutes so no "sat in the pot for an hour" cup of coffee for me! Also their lattes ARE definitely worth a try they're sweet, milky, and give you the shot of energy you need to get over the afternoon shlump!The staff is pleasant and cheerful, they know their teas and coffees and are always willing to help you find what you are looking for! As a Hoboken native, I am proud to say that small businesses such as these are present in my community!
2011-11-23,4,I have been to Empire Coffee & Tea twice now and I am definitely a fan. The coffee is amazing. So smooth and not over-roasted and burnt-tasting like some large chains that I might have to go to in other cities. It is about the same price as said chains so that is a good deal in my opinion. Also it smells incredible in there. Oh boy, the smell of fresh coffee beans is like crack to me. I also like the location, it is nice and quiet not being right on Washington Street. And everyone who works there is really nice. I especially appreciated them the first time I came in, I was on my way to see my apartment here, had a big suitcase, and had no idea how far it was, and they gave me directions and told me it really wouldn't be too bad of a walk.I would think it is a five star place but I am a big fan of snacks to go with my coffee and I do think the pastry selection could be improved. However they do have a large selection of chocolates and other treats. I just like my treats to be made of wheat products I suppose. And it would be nice if they had more seating so you could get coffee and loaf around inside. But that won't stop me from coming in for coffee quite often!
2011-09-23,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE Empire Coffee! I pretty much stop in every day although sometimes I just buy the beans and make it at home! Wayyyyyyyy better than Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks!! The service is awesome and the place is so cute! Try the Mexican Spiced coffee too! Delicious!
2011-09-11,4,So happy that this place is right around the corner from me! I love supporting local businesses and Empire is hands down way better than Dunks or Starbucks. I love their punch cards (10 drinks will get you a free one, and the same with pounds of coffee), and it's a great incentive to keep coming back here. I love treating myself to their iced lattes! I also love that they come up with fun drinks every season. If you're used to paying Dunks prices, you may think it's a little overpriced, but it is a way better value than the overpriced crap at Starbucks. The staff has always been friendly and knowledgeable. Also, if you ever need to get a gift basket done, they are great! I have gotten some of their pre-made baskets for my customers, and got one assembled by them for my friend's bridal shower with some stuff I bought from there and some stuff I bought elsewhere, and it worked out perfectly!
2011-06-28,5,UH-MAY-ZING. If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. My absolute favorite place to purchase coffee. I used to live in Hoboken and would frequent Empire often. The staff is amazing, so sweet and chill. The COFFEE; however, is incredible. I have never experienced such a delicious cup of Joe in my life, until having it here. There are roughly 40 huge bags of fresh coffee beans upon entering this cute little place - and tons of flavors to choose from. I now live about 20 minutes away, but still go into Hoboken just to get a few pounds of freshly ground coffee. GO HERE.
2011-06-23,5,Empire has great coffee and super friendly service.  Even though it's not close to my office and there are about 6 other places to get coffee between here and there, it's worth the walk.
2011-06-08,4,Picked up a pound-and-a-half of coffee beans today. Friendly, helpful service. I'm going to buy my beans from here instead of Manhattan. I need to try some their nosh next time. Does anyone know if the have free wifi?
2011-06-03,2,A nice little spot, albeit nothing special. The entrance is inconveniently inaccessible for strollers and the seating area is cramped and not the cleanest. My tea drinks have never been spectacular and sometimes too sugary. Unfortunately the gentleman working the counter when we went there last was rude, impatient and even snapped at my son who touched something in the store. Really, sir - being kid-unfriendly when your business is located on the corner of a playground in HOBOKEN is just ridiculous.
2011-04-20,5,The best coffee in Hoboken...the service is very friendly and they have quite a few delicous blends of coffee.  There's also outdoor seating.
2011-04-09,4,Great little neighborhood coffee spot with some inventive drinks. I've been here on two consecutive Saturday afternoons and there's always a seat available, even outside. Really cool spot to bring a book and sip a latte. The red velvet latte is awesome, but the sugar and spice latte I tried had a little too much cinnamon for my liking. I could easily see this place becoming an obsession of mine.
2011-01-02,4,This is a great local coffee shop.  They roast all their own beans and have a great selection of by-the-pound coffee.  In fact, I bought their Italian-Mexican blend for my dad, a crazy-obsessive-coffee-connoisseur as a Christmas gift and he LOVED it.  I frequent Empire at least a few times a week when I'm not on the road for my morning coffee.  The only thing that would make this place better would be seating...There's really no place to sit inside which is a bit of a bummer.  If you want to meet a friend for coffee/tea, Empire just isn't going to cut it in the wintertime.  Other than that, I'll continue to make this a regular stop!
2010-12-29,4,I am pleased to announce the winner of the best cup of flavored coffee I have EVER had! If you like spice, you mist try the Mexican coffee! Rico!!!  I now live in Seattle but am originally from Michigan. I'll admit, I am surprised that flavored coffee I not at all popular in Seattle! So, upon finding this shop, I bought 2 lbs of wonderful flavored coffee beans. Hopefully this will last me until my next trip to NJ:)This place would easily have 5 stars if they had more room for sitting.  I love the vibe and would have enjoyed the opportunity to stay comfortably and take in the coffee aroma longer!
2010-11-28,5,WOW!  My mouth and lips have never tasted a more delightful latte until I walked into Empire Coffee today.  These guys make the most amazing, soft, sweet & sexy Red Velvet latte.  In fact, it was hands down the best latte I've ever had in my life.The store was super cute wtih organic and all natural products lining the walls.  There were barrels of coffee beans lined up on the left side of the store.Once the winter gets rough, I don't wanna go anywhere, but hell yeah I'd make the trek up the extra 4 blocks on my way home (barefoot, in the snow)  just to get that double dose of sweet tasty java.  This place makes you wonder how everyone else gets coffee wrong so often.(this post was originally on the NYC wall until I realized this was intended for the Hoboken one)
2010-11-09,4,I go here every day before work, just wish they opened before 7.  Haven't had anything but the regular coffee, but it's A-OK with me.  And I don't use sugar cause I'm damn sweet already.They also have a great special that is $10 for a travel mug (size of a medium), a free first fill, and $1 fills from then on (normally $1.50).  There are a couple outdoor tables and two indoor tables in case you wanted to meet a friend for cup o joe.  Place smells great, too.
2010-10-26,4,I really like this place. The coffee is always fresh, there is a great variety and the staff are very attentive and friendly. If you tired of the Starbucks thing and want to enjoy a local coffee house ,you won't be dissapointed.Hey we got to support the little guys out there !!
2010-09-05,5,The aroma of coffee beans when you first walk in is enticing.  I love this little coffee shop. They're very friendly and helpful every time I'm there. I usually buy ground coffee there and really appreciate the variety of flavors and the fact that I know my beans will be freshly ground when I buy them
2010-07-19,5,This place is awesome! I just went there today with a co worker and both got iced sexy teas which is a passion fruit-black tea mix. It was really refreshing and tasty. Huge fan and I'll be back to get one of their numerous coffee blends.
2010-05-25,4,Yummy coffee and cookies.  Excellent beans.  Cute locale by the park.  So much better than bux or panara.  Support local business.
2010-04-02,4,I like this place and I stop by almost every time I'm in Hoboken. The one thing that distresses me a bit is the out in the open coffee beans. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't coffee beans be roasted and then sealed in an air tight container? It looks and smells great but I'd be hesitant to buy.
2010-01-31,4,Have been trying to branch out and try more local places instead of Dunkin coffee all the time.  Just got a cappuccino single shot, which was only $2.50 and it tastes amazing. Really great coffee for pretty cheap.  A double shot was less than $.50 more....$2.95.  Unfortunately Empire is about 6 blocks in the wrong direction of work in the morning, so I probably won't be stopping in before work, but this will be my new go-to place on the weekends!!
2010-01-27,5,Delicious and inventive drinks. Awsome iced tea and they have Mallow Cups at the counter! It's my favorite candy ever and impossible to find in North Jersey. The Baristas are always very nice and are knowledgeable about the various coffees they sell, which are excellent.
2009-12-16,5,The best place to buy coffee in Hoboken.  They have a great selection of single-origin and blended whole bean coffee.  I've never asked but I assume they will grind it to go.  The coffee drinks are excellent as well.  It gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside to be supporting a local store instead of a nationwide chain.Parking is almost non-existent.  Sometimes you get lucky circling around the area but it's probably best to leave the car somewhere else.
2009-10-20,5,Since i live about 20 minutes from this place the only complaint I have is that it closes too early! Everything is great, from the Frozen Hot Chocolate to the Sexy Arnold Palmers. I do know the dirty gossip about the company since I am very close to some of the employees but i won't go there ;) All I'll say is that if your not looking for overly strong immitation coffee (Starbucks) then this is the place for you. They also have other cool trinkets for the kitchen goers in youe life, I have gotten so much Christmas shopping done at this place. And one thing i absolutely love to do is get one of those chocolate covered spoons and stir them into my coffee or cocoa...TO DIE FOR. Bottom Line: this place is worth the wait. When there is one!
2009-10-01,5,Go here! Well, if you live in Hoboken...I'm not a coffee drinker, I'm a tea drinker. But their selection of loose-leaf tea is something to be contended with. On a pretty day, I like to take any one of my coffee-drinking cohorts and make a game of spinning the muffin trolley to see which muffin is going to end up being my breakfast. They have a cute little area to sit outside and discuss the day's prospects, and for me, there is not a more enjoyable morning.
2009-07-28,3,Had a nice time hanging outside with my okay-chai. But they have great variety products inside, good coffee blends, and cool staff. I was just disappointed with the chai *sniffles* The latte was better.
2009-07-12,3,Strawberry no long works here, and I guess she took the joy with her, because none of the remaining baristas have been as friendly and upbeat during my subsequent visits in the last few weeks. (Luckily, the great coffee and Sexy Tea have remained.)-1 star.
2009-05-15,5,i love the cute cozy coffee shop feel.. the vibe is great the staff is so nice!  the flavors are amazing..def the best coffee shop in hoboken !
2008-11-22,5,Empire is the real deal! The real neighborhood coffee shop, the way is was meant to be.   Friendly staff, cozy vibe, and of course excellent coffee they roast themselves.  Go get a cup, and take home a few pounds too.  I recommend Uncle Paulie's Blend (after all this is Hoboken) and Starry Night. Truckstop Fiesta is good too, but does a number on me.  I don't drink the fancy drinks so I can't comment on those.  But the place is definitely authentic.  Also, it's cool because they are dog-friendly to boot.  Support the local economy and F*$% Starbucks!
2007-11-02,5,We became addicted to their coffee a few years ago. They roast all the coffee beans themselves in their facility in Upstate NY. All the beans are very fresh and they sell lots of bulk to local restaurants. Now that we've moved away from the Hoboken area I regularly pick up 2 to 3 lbs. of whole bean coffee when I come in to visit friends. A plus is that you can order their coffees online, but I like coming in to visit.
