2020-04-16,5,Great people, beers, and pup friendly. We LOVE this place.
2019-09-08,5,The Ale House simply rocks. The drinks were great and reasonably priced PLUS it's dog friendly, daily! What could be better than that? We luckily went on a night that was a charity event for the Liberty Humane Society (Yappy Hour), and we actually ended up winning the raffle for a Tito's Vodka dog house for my little Pickles. Needless to say, we had a great time, and we will be back!
2019-06-21,5,Free pool.  Great beer specials.  Friendly staff.  Dogs everywhere.  What's not to love?  Unless you're a person allergic to dogs, then this isn't for you.  Kim C below unfortunately feels otherwise.  I tried to make her understand it's HER responsibility to do her research on bars before going there.  Unfortunately some people are truly nonsensical.  Here's a snapshot of the conversation.
2019-02-24,3,Bartender was quick to take our order. It was strong that was great. A big group of guys walked in and she decided to pull her hood off and I'm thinking lord girl not the yoga gear. I hope they tipped her big for effort. I guess if you're a huge dog lover it's great you can bring your dog. I love dogs but I don't appreciate sitting next to one at the bar. There should be at least a rule they stay on the floor. Unless of course you will like to get sued by a patron who has been bit by someone's dog at the bar. If you're looking just to get a drink and shoot the breeze it's an okay place. If you're looking for great music this is not your place. Last but not least security were super friendly. Not scary but those are big guys so I wouldn't mess around in there.
2019-01-25,5,HOBOKEN: the last stop on our visit to Hoboken was to The Ale House for their Yappy Hour event! The Ale House is always dog friendly inside, but every month they host yappy hour to raise money for the Liberty Humane Society! It's a $5 donation to enter and 100% of the proceeds benefit LHS!! So cool! We walked inside and it was a parade of happy doggies! Beverages only, but you can bring in your own food! Check their schedule for other events including trivia, happy hour, and other specials!
2018-12-19,5,The Ale House is dog friendly - how can it get better? Well, if you're into karaoke (let me tell you, not a lot of places in Hoboken offer karaoke nights) then this is the spot for you! I usually come for karaoke nights because my friend and I have been wanting to go to a place nearby that doesn't require us to cross the river because it's just not worth the car rides there and back just to sing and drink - let's be real. We love the karaoke host as he sings and engages with everyone that participates and though the bartenders are probably not pleased with our performances (LOOL), they are all incredibly kind. We especially love the security person that checks ID's. The staff are all very chill and just want you to have a good safe time. Thursday nights are half price drinks for women so it's nice to have that, but they also have tons of activities that go on during the week. I've seen geek night, trivia night, etc. They definitely are a very inclusive space and truly want you to have a good time. They have a pool table in the back and I've seen tons of people order food and eat it there! Love this bar
2018-06-09,4,Had one of my fav golden ale here, Big Wave, not too hoppy. It happened to be their cocktail week recently, i tried Ale House Mule, not bad. They have different specials/ events on different days. I have to say this is one of the most "try to do marketing" bar i've been. They allow puppies. I guess that's why they have many returning customers.Played Dart and Shuffle w my bf here. Wish they had live music. Kinda boring at the end.
2018-05-06,3,A classic neighborhood bar -- reminds me of the bars back home in Wisconsin. No frills. An adequate selection of major brands and craftier beers. Darts, pool and shuffleboard are available for your enjoyment. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd probably be a regular.
2018-02-06,1,Ehhh okay local bar. Went on a Friday night and it wasn't too crowded just a few people playing pool. The drinks are pretty good, prices are reasonable, but the bartender here gave my friend and I horrible service! First of all, she made us pay for our drinks up front while everyone else was able to keep open tabs. Also, there's a jukebox in the bar and other customers were playing rock songs which were fine with the staff. My friend and I decided to use the jukebox and we chose to play some mainstream Hip Hop songs and as soon as it even played the female bartender skipped the song!!! She apologized and returned our dollar but this is completely unacceptable!! We finished our drinks and left. On our way out she chased us asking us to pay our bill when we paid each drink up front and our last drinks were actually served by the male bartender. Terrible service!
2017-09-10,5,One of the few great hangout bars left in Hoboken.  Good beer selection and free popcorn!  Plenty of room for pool, darts and shuffleboard.  Lots of tv's for sports viewing.
2017-08-07,4,Good divey spot for grabbing a few drinks or a casual night out.  They have dart boards, shuffleboard, and a pool table.  They also have trivia on Wednesdays (not sure if this is just a summer thing or year-round).  The trivia did get super packed and there was not anywhere to sit at the bar, so I would recommend going early if you are going for that.  This is a dog-friendly spot and it seemed like tons of people did have their dogs with them.They don't serve food but I believe you can order delivery from the pizza place on the corner.  The only issue we've come across is that they only had one bartender on trivia night which made it difficult to get a drink due to the only bartender running around like crazy.
2017-08-02,4,Cool spot to hang out on a weekend. We came here in a lazy Sunday afternoon before visiting the newly opened Trader Joe's close by. Very attentive and generous bartender esp. Brian (with eyeglasses) who served us and kept the conversation going on currently what's happening in Hoboken.
2017-02-20,4,Fun little spot. Beer selections were okay, not a whole lot of choices but the options here were good enough.They have a dart board and pool table as well. This place likely doesnt get the same traffic that Washington or anywhere else near the PATH does, which probably makes it more likable if you don't want to fight a crowd to have a drink.They have a popcorn machine, which is a cute additive. If they had little side dishes to munch on that would seal the deal.
2017-01-06,5,Great place with a great crowd. Good for most ages but if you're under 35, you're going to really love it. Tons of TVs for every conceivable sport. Pool. Darts. Shuffleboard. Lots of beer. One of the places that carries Hoboken Ale, so that's a huge plus.
2016-11-27,5,Whether your stoppin in for a bu lay / Jaimo / or quick dart game, this place is great to catch a quick one. Also the awkward middle aged DJ sometimes present on the weekends will get you Jerry'd! #raiseheavies
2016-11-12,4,Went here on a Friday night and had a great time! The bartenders are nice, they have free games (shuffleboard, pool, and darts), a good beer selection, and most importantly...they are dog friendly.
2016-11-07,4,The Ale House is great if you're looking for a chill place to just get a few beers and play some games. There's shuffle board, darts and pool - all of which are free! They used to have great specials but on a recent Saturday trip the bartender thought i was crazy when I asked for a $2 can of PBR - they also used to have a surprise special (the bartender would blindly reach into the cooler and no matter what they pulled out it was $3) - both are no longer there. The bartender also didn't like the music we were playing even though we were the only ones in there so he shut off the touchtunes after we had loaded it up with money to turn on his own death metal music.
2016-10-24,5,This is hands down my favorite bar in Hoboken. It has a great neighborhood feel, tons of beer on tap and bottle (I'm attempting to try them all), free pool, darts, and shuffleboard, and a killer jukebox. The staff is totally awesome (except for the muscle head bar back, he's just ok), amazing management, and just a great atmosphere to be in. Will definitely come back a few times!
2016-09-30,4,formerly McMahon's, the new ownership cleaned it up a bit, and I dig it. have been here a few times and it's a good hangout spot if you just want a low-key night.it's still awfully narrow and with a bit of an odd layout that seems to create a bottleneck in trying to go between the front and the back, but I guess they can't tear down the wall like both Pink Floyd or Ronald Reagan demanded. leads to it getting a bit packed in the bar area some nights, but that's the nature of the beast and I can't really fault them for it - though perhaps adding a bartender on busy nights would lessen the queue time.good bartenders and a solid lineup of beers and whiskey.karaoke once a month, and a solid jukebox that I like to spam with rock and metal.there's pool and shuffleboard tables (which both seem to be maintained well enough) as well as dartboards. more importantly, the games are free - despite the fact that crooked politicians who misfile their emails and lie to the public are allowed to get away with "pay for play" schemes, I really don't think it's justifiable when a bar that isn't a pool hall wants me to cough up extra money to use a pool table. not so at the Ale House.oh yeah, free popcorn, it's dog-friendly (if that floats your boat), and you can have food delivered there.
2016-07-26,3,I really want to love this place. Between the good beer selection, free popcorn, pool, shuffleboard and cute dogs (you can bring your dog) this place would have a lot to offer... If only the d-bags would get the hell out. Unfortunately I cannot get past the horrible crowd that frequents the Alehouse to harass women and start fights with their boyfriends. Yes, you read that right. This has happened AT LEAST 3 times that I've been here. And the trend seems to be that those d-bags are ALWAYS friends of the bartenders.One night in particular I was there with my boyfriend and a bunch of our friends and there were two drunk assholes who tried to start fights with every single guy in my group as well as many other guys that were just hanging at the bar trying to have a good time. When the guys would ignore the asshole trying to start the fight, he would then move on to saying really inappropriate shit about that guy's girlfriend. He would then antagonize everyone by saying "What are you gonna do? I'm friends with the bartender." This went on for at least an hour until finally someone in my group said something to the bartender (the guy's friend). The bartender didn't do anything so then someone else told security. Security told us if we didn't like how he was acting then we should leave. So we did just that and I don't really plan on coming back.
2016-06-01,5,I guess I should write a review here.  I've been here a number of times.  Short and sweet review: The bar has a great staff, reasonably priced beverages, and free pool, darts, shuffleboard, and popcorn.  I've never had an issue.  Also, it's one of the few places to have karaoke in town (even if it's only once a month :P)If you want quieter, come during the week. You want a busy night, come during the weekend.For a bar off the main drag in Hoboken, you can't get much better than this.
2016-03-30,5,A great place to meet up for darts, pool or shuffleboard. Excellent staff, great service and how can you beat $2.00 Rolling Rock pints? Hard to complain about buy backs with prices like that. Popcorn (fresh and free) is excellent touch too. Joe, the owner on site a lot to see to it everything goes well, sponsors a lot of teams in the leagues and dog friendly
2016-03-14,1,I've given this place many opportunities to gain my loyalty since it reopened under new management. I'm done with it after my recent experience. The female bartender was not attentive. Our glasses sat empty far too often while we tried to get her attention.  My arm was getting tired trying to waive her down. She must have been overwhelmed by the 2 other customers in the bar.  We had more than 5 beers each without a single buy back.
2016-02-23,5,Love the vibe at this bar and the staff. Love the atmosphere with the games. Good for any night of the week.
2015-11-19,2,Cannot understand the authenticity of the reviews, have been going in since the remodeling and it is always so sterile, and as for talk of service being great I'm afraid that's tosh. Not once has a barman/lady ever actually done anything aside from serve drinks eventually then slinked away. Look at how empty this place is all the time!  I wish them well and it is my closest but have tried to get a drink there 2x in the past 2 weeks, first time doors locked 20 mins after opening time, last night walked in to an empty bar, i.e. No patrons and no staff! Waited at the bar for 2 minutes nothing, unless it was DIY night, that's bizarre! Good luck!
2015-09-25,5,Stumbled upon this joint on a Friday night. They have a pool table and shuffleboard. Awesome bartender, Brian, told us about $4 mystery beer night where he reaches into the cooler and pulls out a surprise beer. Who can resist!? Got a Stella, Modelo, and a Peruvian beer. Love this place. Will be coming back. Also they have $5 half pitchers of bud or coors light.
2015-09-15,4,Really fun bar that is dog friendly. Free super yummy popcorn, great prices, and a shuffle board and pool table in the back. It gets crowded pretty quickly because it's not a huge space. Other than that, great atmosphere!
2015-08-29,4,Fun bar off the beaten path. Service is always friendly and you can't beat free popcorn.
2015-04-04,5,Booom!!!! Best bar in town. Shuffleboard darts pool. Bad ass bartender arianna who makes mean drinks. Backwall photo montage of the Olsen twins . What's better than that? Go to ale house . Your welcome
2015-04-01,5,Tough to beat the Ale House for happy hour. A good variety of beers on tap, shuffleboard, pool table and dart board. I've been told they have a pretty good league going for all three. Oh and a juke box. Huge plus.
2015-03-21,4,Had a great time here. Large space, high ceilings, good lighting. Pool & shuffleboard tables in the back. Jukebox. Friendly vibe. Would definitely return.
2015-02-26,4,Nice place to have a few drinks and play some music....friendly staff.
