2021-10-08,1,Ordered 2 sushi rolls and 2 salads earlier in the day for delivery at 7:45pm. It only arrived at 8:45pm. The telephone number would either go to voicemail or say it wasn't in service half the time. Restaurant kept on saying "they're on their way" with no eta.Person that had a spicy yellowtail roll and seaweed salad felt sick the next morning. Coincidence? Maybe, but doubt it.Would not recommend.
2021-10-03,4,I'm not sure where or how I haven't written a review? I feel like it disappeared? I've been eating in and getting delivery/take out for over 5 years- solid spot! Huge turn over which means it's a reliable spot in my opinion! Prices have increased over the years but so have a few of the other sush spots as well. I love their rolls, kani salad and hand rolls. Sushi is always fresh! I even ordered a huge delivery order at the beginning of summer and it was delicious! They also have noodles/rice/hibachi options as well! Would recommend - nothing out of this world but consistent and good quality! Also solid delivery option in town.
2021-09-06,1,Ordered delivery and waited two and a half hours to receive the meal. I continued to call the restaurant for status and they turned off their phone line so I could not get in touch with them.
2021-08-30,5,This is my favorite casual sushi place in the neighborhood. Ayame has a menu that reminds me of diner menus. There is so much to choose from. I love their rock shrimp appetizer! They used to toss the shrimp in mayo, but now it's served separately. The bentos are an amazing deal. They come with an amazing mushroom soup, noodles, rice, and veggies. My boyfriend and I always get the fried rice instead of the white rice. It might look plain, but it is so flavorful. Highly recommend the scallop and salmon dinner bento. I believe that Ayame also has incredible lunch deals such for salmon bentos and sushi rolls (3 sushi rolls for $15. Includes scallop rolls.)
2021-08-17,5,I love this place! One of the first sit down restaurants we tried after moving here. Absolutely delicious. Staff is super friendly, food is THE BEST, super clean inside seating. They have outdoor seating as well. A very large selection to choose from on the menu. This has easily become a favorite already. Have come back multiple times already and I can't wait to go back. Rock shrimp is so good I can't recommend it enough!
2021-08-08,4,It was my first time here and the customer service was great, very friendly and quick. I had the vegetable steamed dumplings which were nice and hot and fresh. I also had the king lobster rolls and that was amazing. The only flaw I can say this restaurant has is that there is no wine. They do not serve alcohol beverages, I was sad about that.
2021-06-23,5,This is my go-to hibachi in the area. Always consistently good. Even take out is great. Awesome portion sizes, friendly staff and just a fun time. Highly recommend
2021-06-22,5,Really good!Really great sushi options and delicious spicy mayo sauce. Very good service and nice employees. Family friendly as well, with outdoor seating.
2021-06-22,5,BEST FOOD EVER!!! sushi is amazing and I love the salads. Everyone is so nice and accommodating. I come back here all the time. PERFECT!!! love it so so much
2021-06-19,4,Place gets packed, you might struggle with service. Table was damp wet and we didn't get saucers for our sushi, however the lady taking care of us was very nice.This place is good to come for a drink at the bar, and the sushi rolls are well priced. Food is a bit hit or miss.The special rolls were nice and tasty (spider and sweetheart). I wouldn't recommend the reg spicy salmon and tuna, didn't know you could mess those up, but apparently can, not good. Ordered a dinner entre from the wok section, the peanut chicken, it was the most boring, basic dish i have ever seen/tasted. Just plain rice and plain breaded chicken (they brought the sauce on the side), where's the wok part? We were definitely expecting it to be sauteed in the sauce with veggies or something, so big pass!
2021-04-30,5,Fantastic food here! Super fresh items and they are so busy there is always a quick turnover.
2021-03-28,4,Tried this place the other weekend for takeout, and got on of their combos. Great value for 3 standard rolls and miso soup, and it tasted great. I'll definitely be going back to try their special rolls next time I'm craving sushi.
2021-02-25,4,There are a lot of sushi spots in town and it is always hard to choose when ordering delivery. Ayame does things right and I enjoyed the sushi I ordered. No matter what type of specialty rolls a place has I always go for the classic ones.  The key is simple rolls with fresh ingredients. That's what Ayame does. I went with the avocado roll and peanut avocado roll. The peanut avocado roll is my favorite roll in history. It is a weird combo of flavors but it works. I didn't get the tuna or salmon but I am sure those are good as well. The sushi rolls were not rolled tight but still all good. The delivery was quick and easy.In the end, I would definitely reorder from here because of the quality of the sushi rolls. Its also convenient when you are hungry since it comes quick. Check it out!
2021-01-28,5,Hibachi is something you think of as an in-person experience. Well, it was my birthday and dang, I missed Ayame Hibachi. We ordered and it was just as DELICIOUS as in-person. It really hit the spot. We also YouTube'd a hibachi chef - it felt like being in the restaurant! Can't wait for an in person dinner & a show.
2021-01-12,4,Sushi rolls were great the sweet potato was my favorite all the textures mix together very well! The sea treasure was In a very good & tasty sauce the salmon was a bit dry but good Nonetheless. Definitely enjoyed the food would recommend eating here.
2021-01-03,4,Picked up some sushi and sashimi. The presentation and quality is good. The concern I mostly had was their wait time. I came to pick up via Uber Eats at a certain time. They said give them 15 mins and it ended up being me standing there 40 mins while asking every 20 mins. Seems as though they were swamped with orders, but they finally got around to finishing up my order so I can go.Sushi and Sashimi Platter was good.Salmon girl set was good portion.The Amaye Roll to me wasn't worth it. It was ok.Overall, I would like to give them another try as the food was solid.
2021-01-03,2,This is my second time getting ayame in the last month. The first time I had it every piece of sushi fell apart. I thought maybe it was a different chef working so I decided to give them another try. Yet again every piece of sushi broke apart once I picked it up. I will not be returning going forward.
2020-12-29,5,I must say this place has some of the BEST sushi in Hoboken. I've had their hibachi too and while it is a bit pricey, it was great!I would recommend their special rolls, fish is always consistently fresh and tasty.
2020-11-08,4,Came here for a quick bite and was happy with the meal. They have lunch specials till 4:00pm everyday and we made it just in time to avail it. It's 2 rolls with a soup or salad for $10- great deal!! We also got the kani salad and pork dumplings both of which were delicious. The food came out quickly, the service was great, everything was super tasty and we left with full bellies without forking over a lot of money. They have tables on the sidewalk and it's all spaced out. Will definitely be back!!
2020-11-04,5,Best sushi in Hoboken!! I love the Crazy Tuna Roll and they have a great variety of special rolls. I have gotten take out and delivery a few times from here during COVID and they haven't let me down once! Even got take out hibachi and it was DELISH. Totally recommend!
2020-09-01,1,Good food, lousy delivery guyThe delivery guy calls me from the building's lobby to inform me the food is downstairs to which I've asked him if he can please bring it up.His reply was then that the food is downstairs (as if he didn't hear me), so I politely ask again and he replies again and I ask again and he hangs up and leaves the food downstairs. Nice move, excellent service.Used to order food from Ayame at lease 2-3 times a month. I suppose there are other sushi alternatives in Hoboken.
2020-09-01,5,THIS PLACE HOOKED US UP. SOO GOOD. So much food for the price I'm so glad I found this. Thank you Ayame
2020-08-22,5,This place is SOOOO good!!! Went with a friend and it just became my favorite sushi place !!
2020-07-29,5,Loved the option to choose three rolls for $16. It was more than enough to fill me up and tasted very fresh.  I've tried many other sushi places in the area and this one is my favorite in terms of freshness and pricing.
2020-07-14,4,This is my absolute favorite sushi spot! Always fresh food and nice staff. They never rush you even if they're packed! Gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because if you're sitting close to the hibachi tables you might smell like them later when you leave the restaurant. But food is amazing!
2020-02-29,4,I ordered postmates and it was actually pretty great for takeout hibachi!! Fried rice could use more seasoning but everything else was pretty great
2020-01-29,5,Love this restaurant, go with friends once we ordered sushi sashimi and wasabi cracker. By looking at the sushi and sashimi you can tell it is fresh and good source of fish, beside this the wasabi cracker shock me, this become one of my favorites, definitely will visit again
2020-01-23,5,I had been here 5 times, and now it's become my favorite restaurant. Their ingredients and seafoods are very very fresh that so important for make sushi and other kinds of food. I recommend everyone come to try their any kind of seafoods sushi, it tastes so good and fresh.
2020-01-12,3,Lunch special was okay... small portions compared to what I got in the past, not sure if it was because of lunch special or because they just decreased portions overall. Decent service, nothing crazy. Food is very good tho, sushi especially.
2019-12-09,1,I ordered my food at 6:46 PM and it was supposed to arrive between 7:40-7:50 PM. 2 hours later when I call the restaurant they say sorry we're late it's raining. I don't think rain is a valid reason for almost 2 hours to delivery, especially not sushi which is fresh fish that will go bad from being out that long. Has happened repeatedly and every time I say never again. This time it's really never again. Horrible customer service!
2019-11-24,1,Tell your delivery driver working 11/24 to calm down. Obnoxiously ringing the door bell over and over without waiting is uncalled for. Guy needs to check himself.
2019-11-24,1,This the most unorganized place. Made a reservation for a large group of about 17 people. They only had one person cooking at a time. The entire group ate separate. Terrible!
2019-10-14,4,Came here for a hibachi dinner for my birthday! This place is super lively and fun, so it's a great place to celebrate! The chefs are fun and interactive. I got salmon and scallops and it was pretty good! It's BYO. Service can be slow at times though.
2019-09-24,4,Finally returned to dine in for dinner one night. I think for the quality and price, Ayame is probably the best option in Hoboken. This time, we had the American Dream (salmon, avocado, cucumber inside, spicy king crab on top), White Dragon (spicy scallop, avocado, with white tuna and spicy garlic sauce on top), Hoboken Monster (spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, mango, avocado, masago inside, soft shell crab tempura, mango & eel sauce, black tobiko on top with gold leaf), and a maki combo of white tuna, tuna, and salmon. The special rolls were pretty good but I must say, they all tasted pretty similar to me. I actually liked the plain maki rolls better because it was simple. They also didn't put too much rice in the maki rolls, which I really appreciated. I think I found my new go-to spot in the hood!Tip - BYOB
2019-08-24,4,I ordered here on seamless and was extremely impressed . Fast , fresh and delicious Hand roll , sushi rolls and soup . I will order again. Much better than the typical "go to" options
2019-08-14,4,I have been to this restaurant a few times before, mostly for friends birthdays. This time we were a group of 16 people and were accommodated well by the venue. They were really good at taking the order and making sure that the vegetarians were separated from the non-vegetarians. The food is all really good and well-made with good portions. You can even split a meal between two people, which I highly recommend because the portions are still enough and it saves you some money. It was really nice of them to bring out dessert at the end for the birthday boy. Our chef was funny, and had some cool tricks up his sleeve. He made sure to get the birthday boy with sake and even went around the table for every person and asked if they wanted to be a part of it. I would highly recommend except for the one issue we had which was we saw a cockroach running around under our feet.
2019-06-24,1,I discovered a long black hair buried in my salad after I already ate half. brb going to go throw up. This is also not my first negative experience at this establishment.
2019-06-22,5,Finally found a solid sushi place in Hoboken that won't break the bank. Very good selection and the staff is quite attentive. They are BYOB which is always a must for Sushi. Never tried the Hibachi they have in the back but might give it a try someday.
2019-06-11,5,Loved the place. This was our second time there and the staff is amazing. Had our table ready for us and we're very patient with us as we waited for our group to complete.
2019-05-28,5,The filet mignon and fried rice are always great choices! My hibachi grill staff have always been kind and worked hard to put on a great show. The owners are also wonderful people who are earnest, dedicated to their work, and invested in providing the best food and experience to their customers! A Hoboken must see.
2019-05-16,1,My fiancé and I ordered from this place and overall the food was average at best.  We ordered the miso black cod app...it was by far the worst piece of food I ever had... the black rice was hard as a rock and the cod looked like an overdone/dry piece of grilled chicken We called and the manager was supposed to give us a refund for this and it has yet to happen.Please don't waste your money on this place as there are many better options
2019-04-15,4,I ordered the "out of control roll" it was delicious but definitely a bit pricy at $15. My friend ordered the lunch special of 3 regular rolls and salad. I'd come here again but it's a slight splurge. Roll came out at a decent time and service was fine. We ate outdoors.
2019-03-26,5,Best lunch specials ever, I come to eat here at least twice a week! The miso soup is pretty tasty and same with hand roll sushi. Portions are fairly big. Bento box has a good variety.
2019-03-24,4,Good choice to go Ayame Hibachi Sushi. Service and server were great. And one of my favorite food in this restaurant is salmon it was wonderful.
2019-02-16,1,This place is absolutely disgusting. There was a cockroach on our table and and then on the wall behind my head. The waiter grabbed the cockroach behind my head and laughed in my face when I got scared. How is this place in business ?
2019-02-01,5,Definitely a sushi go-to. Though the rice is a little bland and the gyoza could use a little more filling, the sushi here is one of my favorites in the area. They have great soups as well. If you're going in to dine rather than take out, it's definitely worth doing the hibachi as the food is made right there and is very fresh and flavorful. If you're doing delivery, the food always arrives on time!
2019-01-26,5,This has to be my favorite place is Hoboken to eat. The interior is beautiful and minimalistic without seeming low maintenance and the food is absolutely delicious. Like I would want this to be my last meal. It's also so affordable and the service is the great. The waiters are so sweet as well and overall, the place is a place to make beautiful memories you will never forget.
2019-01-20,3,My friends and I ordered takeout from here and while we liked everything we ordered, didn't think it was anything spectacular. The fish seemed fresh and the prices are pretty reasonable. For the group we ordered edamame, miso soup, seaweed salad, sweet heart roll, spicy girl roll, spicy tuna roll, Philadelphia roll, shrimp tempura roll, tuna tartar, gyoza and sashimi. Overall I thought everything was pretty average, although I particularly liked the gyoza and the spicy girl roll (must try!!). Delivery was on time. Would probably order from here again given the food is pretty good and priced fairly.
2019-01-06,5,I haven't been to many Hibachi restaurants before, but I really enjoyed my time at Ayame. The hibachi was really good and there was a lot of it. I especially enjoyed the show they put on while making it! Sadly I did not get to try out the sushi. The staff were all very quick and attentive, and the atmosphere was quite fun. I would recommend this restaurant for any group that is craving hibachi.
2018-12-27,1,I became sick with food poisoning after eating the spicy tuna avocado rolls and steamed veggie goyoza. Stay away!
2018-12-17,1,Ew! Don't eat there, place is dirty, and food was disgusting. I rushed home to trow up.
2018-12-17,1,Please be warned. Do not eat there! My wife and myself went for dinner and we regret it. My wife threw up after we got home since the food was not fresh. Believe the reviews about bugs and mice! We started noticing many flies even tho it was dark in there. Thank god we didn't finish our food. Absolutely disgusting place. If for whatever reason you decide to eat there, please open up the sushi and inspect before you eat.
2018-09-25,1,There was a cockroach in our bag which we noticed after eating one of the two dishes we ordered through GrubHub. We asked them to take back the food but the restaurant asked for a photo for PROOF? I did not think to isolate the cockroach and keep it contained, my priority was getting rid of it in the toilet. They claimed they could not refund me because I had gotten rid of it before showing them, so now I am disgusted and out over half my money paid for the meal.AVOID.
2018-09-16,4,Ayame has a nice atmosphere, attentive staff, and a wide menu. I was very happy with the outdoor seating and hibachi tables. The food itself was fine. The sushi wasn't exceptional, and the hibachi was okay. Overall it's a standard hibachi place if that's what you're craving.
2018-08-12,1,I ordered online and the delivery was over an hour late. I called and spoke to someone who was very rude and clearly didn't care that I had ordered my food over 2 hours ago. She also took zero effort to find out where my delivery was. She just said "it's on its way." Definitely will not be ordering from here again. I could've ordered from a different place and gotten it delivered faster after their "estimated" time of arrival.Food was meh. Should go without saying that the green tea mochi was a liquidy mess. It also exploded for whatever reason. Maybe the delivery guy stabbed it with a toothpick or something.
2018-08-08,4,Great option for sushi in Hoboken. Quick, friendly service and reliable, fast delivery. When ordering over the phone, they have your phone number linked to your address and credit card which is super convenient. Because they can be a bit pricey, if you plan on ordering a bunch of rolls, stick to the rolls and hand rolls on page 10 of the menu. For a night in, I usually get the oshinko roll, dragon roll, and cucumber roll with a side of white rice, house salad, and edamame. If you're planning on getting a special roll, you'll be impressed by the plating.However, I don't find their hibachi or other entrees to be that impressive. And the pop music always gives me the wrong vibe. Not sure I want to listen to Top 50 when out to dinner, no matter the venue.
2018-07-23,5,My girlfriend and I have dined at Ayame on several occasions, and we love it there! The staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the prices are nice and reasonable. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!
2018-07-07,1,Ok where do I start since this place has now been the definition of a nightmare twice. I guess let's start from the beginning I went in January with 5 of my friends for my birthday which started normally. Around the half way point of our food being prepared I notice the manager whisper something to the the chef and the whole experience becomes extremely rushed, while they sit a table of 20 on the table across from us with 6 people starting to stand directly behind us. Around this time we've been sat down for maybe 30 minutes they grab our plates and tell us we need to leave to fit this birthday party, mind you it's also my birthday. After trying to get us to pay full price they argue with me for 10 minutes and ruin a great night out with my friends. This brings us to a friends bday yesterday which I went in with an open mind since I've worked in restaurants and understand things happen. That was until a huge cockroach runs over my phone and towards my plate. I tell the manager and try to just forget it happened being a good sport. About 5 minutes later a second comes crawling out of the chefs grill table to which the manager acts like we're seeing things and again I don't want to ruin my friends night out. Then about 2 minutes later a third cockroach comes out and goes right under my plate and at this point I'm demanding the manager deal with this. When he arrives he grabs a napkin and tells us it's only rice we're noticing. Ok sir I'm obviously just imaging this ..... ooooo until I tell him to lift the napkin in his hand which is two cockroaches he's trying to hide from us and other tables. One thing to have a dirty restaurant another is to pull the stuff I've had happen in my only two times there.So in summary great place if you want a dirty cockroach infested rude experience. I do think they have good food if you can past these small problems. Bon appetite?
2018-06-14,5,Excellence is par and parcel of this hibachi establishment. Everything was perfect from the time I was seated to the price. I ordered the salmon girl and it did not disappoint. From the. First taste to the last I had wonderful experience and would go again.
2018-05-16,2,Ordered delivery from here last night. The sushi fish was chewy (gross) as was the seaweed, so overall it was not a pleasant experience. I won't ever order from here again.
2018-04-02,3,I been here twice the first time with a large group and I thought the food was good and the chef was very entertaining so a few years after I decided to give this place another try. In all honestly I don't think I'd go again. I rather order Chinese take out for less. I came here with my boyfriend on Easter night the place was empty and we were quickly seated the place is byob so that's a plus. The whole experience lasted 20 minutes we barley ate and took it to go we paid 70 with no dessert or appetizer the chef took about ten minutes cooking and he wasn't  even funny and the food wasn't good.  The worst part is receiving large portions of something that doesn't taste good. Maybe they had a bad day but the food was very salty and then the miso soup was super salty. It's not always quantity it's quality and I know it was bad because my brother eats anything and I realized after leaving it in the fridge for two days he only ate like three pieces of chicken.
2018-03-05,5,My favorite sushi restaurant in Hoboken! Fresh and tastes great! Love it!I have been at to many restaurants and for real,you must have try this one!
2018-02-16,1,I don't think I can eat hibachi ever again.... it was that bad. When they had us catch food - a huge broccoli floret was thrown - easily could've choked - I'm happy I missed the throw. Very dirty restaurant! Not a good experience and it was overpriced for the amount of time the hibachi chef cooked our food. The food was rare and the management didn't say anything or seemed to care after we complained. This review should be 0 stars
2018-02-11,1,Everything was very dirty - from floor, utensils to chairs (do NOT put your hands under chairs). Service was okay... seemed like nobody cared. We mentioned to the waitress that we weren't happy with our experience. She said she was going to get the manager and she never did. Nobody acknowledged our complaint and concerns. The cooking was done in 10 minutes - the food was undercooked. The food overall was tasteless, lacking seasoning. Slightly overpriced for hibachi. The hibachi chef cleaned the grill as we were eating. A massive cloud of smoke and a chemical-like smell from a dirty rag came upon us as we were eating. I'm not sure why this restaurant has 3.5 stars - a very terrible experience (food, service and atmosphere).
2018-02-01,2,This is what you would expect for Hoboken Hibachi. The restaurant was entirely too small for the amount of tables/chairs in there, but I guess they make it work. There is no way this restaurant is up to code lol. Our group sat at a table in the back, half of us slammed with our backs against the wall. The food was very good and they put on a great show. However, there was a huge bug crawling on the wall next to me after my meal, and I was too crammed to move! This was likely a one off situation, but still... it was not an ideal way to end a meal. If you're in Hoboken and want Hibachi, this is your only option. Not great but okay.
2018-01-01,4,It's a very decent Japanese restaurant for a simple meal. My bf and I had spicy salmon, spicy scallop and Ayame sushi and later we ordered white tuna, squid, unagi, spanish mackerel sashimi for shared. White tuna and mackerel are worth trying.
2017-12-31,1,We made a dinner reservation for 7:30pm for 5 people for hibachi. We arrived a few minutes before 7:30 and when we were seated it was cramped allowing us barely an inch to get into our seats. The seats we were seated at were also in a row next to the grill which allowed 2 of the 5 of us to be seated behind the chef's back. This also did not allow us to be able to talk with our friends. When we asked the manager to seat us elsewhere they told us there were only seats for 4 which looked more spacious than the ones we were given. After being told we could not move seats, the chef comes out and confirmed the other guests' orders across the grill from us. The chef then ignores us and does not get a waitress/waiter to come get our orders. The chef immediately starts cooking food for the others seated at our grill. The other party had a reservation for 7:30 as well, might I add. After waiting a good 5-10 minutes and discussing options with our friends, we decided to finish our glass of wine and leave the restaurant. The manager, waiters/waitresses, and staff did not have any explanation for what was happening. Customer service was terrible. Needless to say they have officially lost a few customers that night.
2017-12-29,5,I don't know how this place doesn't have five stars.  I've been an avid sushi-lover for over 10 years and this is legitimately my number one spot. The salmon sashimi is always fresh and they give generous portions.  The prices are moderate considering it's right on Washington Street in Hoboken. I love Ayame so much here's a picture
2017-12-22,2,Highly disappointed with the hibachi dinner.  It was tasteless.  Who makes hibachi without garlic butter???
2017-12-03,5,Great sushi place that is byob! Favorite sushi spot in Hoboken!! Sushi is very fresh and the service is good! They have a good variety of rolls and have really good hibachi too!
2017-12-02,1,Terrible customer service. My boyfriend and i ordered take out and stated no peas in the fried rice as my boyfriend is deathly allergic to them. When the food arrived to the apartment we notice there were peas in the fried. We called the restaurant and let them know there were peas and that we would like another fried rice with no peas like we ordered. They accused us of lying and they wanted us to send a photo of the rice to her phone. They didn't seem to care that my boyfriend was severely allergic to them. Won't be going back anymore.
2017-11-20,4,One of our favorites in Hoboken.  Fun, family friendly atmosphere.  Have only ever done the hibachi although we see lots of sushi being ordered as well.  The chefs are engaging and deliver a great experience.  Always happy with the food.  Huge portions.  Always leave with lots of leftovers.  BYOB so be sure to come prepared.
2017-11-19,4,Ayame we have only ever been to the hibachi grill the place is consistent and good. They give you a ton of food a lot of rice and noodles. It is better to go with a large group for the show but even when we go with our small family we go and have a great time with lots of leftovers and it is BYO.
2017-10-29,5,Sushi is great. Always quick response when ordering pick up. Pricing is good. Atmosphere inside is nice.
2017-10-26,5,We ordered delivery and I must say we got our food quickly. The food was very fresh and delicious. We will definitely visit soon.
2017-10-10,4,I've only been to two sushi restaurants in Hoboken, and this one is my favorite thus far. My only "negative" thing to say about Ayame Hibachi & Sushi is that due to its tight space, the hibachi grills make the restaurant warm and stuffy so those who are there for sushi only.  Everything else is pretty great.  They offer a vast selection of rolls, many of which are creative, their sushi is delicious, and they have a creative selection of sushi appetizers.  To start our evening, we popped open a bottle of sparkling rose (Ayame is BYOB) and shared the Salmon Skin Salad and the Avocado Mini Ball.  The Salmon Skin Salad was a perfectly executed - the salmon skin was crisp and warm while the leafy greens were cold and crisp.  The Avocado Mini Ball was just the right size for two to share - arriving in a shallow bowl, ours was marinated spicy white tuna (you have a variety of fishes you can choose from) tightly wrapped up in a skin of avocado slices.  It was served at room temperature which I personally wasn't a fan of, but it was tasty nonetheless.For our entrees, we shared three rolls, the Ayame Monster Roll, Cajun Tuna Tataki Roll, and the Out of Control Roll.  The Cajun Tuna Tataki Roll tasted like a hybrid California/Spicy Tuna Roll and didn't really stand out, but the Ayame Monster Roll and the Out of Control Roll were delicious - especially the Ayame Monster Roll!  All of the additional topping on each piece of the Ayame Monster Roll, especially the seaweed salad, greatly enhanced each bite making each piece delicious and completely satisfying.  And, what's not to like about deep fried shrimp tempura and soft shell crab wrapped into a roll?  In addition to the rolls, I had two pieces of sushi - one uni and one ikura and my friend had a hand roll.  While I cannot comment on the hand roll, I heard it was delicious, and each sushi piece, while I can't say were the freshest, they both melted in my mouth because the seafood quality was good.  Not only were our eyes hungrier than our stomachs, but each food entry was generous in portion and so we had roll pieces leftover that we packed up to go, and a few hours later they were still delicious!Service is always just as important to the dining experience as the food, and the staff here at Ayame is friendly and accommodating - we asked to switch tables and they were very gracious about it moving us without the bat of an eye, the table next to us had a toddler who smashed one of their plates to the ground and the staff totally kept their cool and didn't make the family feel bad, and they were great about forming new tables for customers to sit at without making those that were still eating their meals feel rushed and pressured to leave.  The next time I am in Hoboken and craving sushi, I will definitely be coming back!
2017-09-19,4,Sushi is great!  Order her often!
2017-09-17,1,Really upset to be writing this review, and we thoroughly enjoyed our sushi here. Great food, and BYOB is always a plus. I have to give Ayame 1 star though, because on this past Friday, 9/15, I saw a rat scurry across the floor in the restaurant. We had just finished out dinner in the outdoor seating area, and I went inside to use the ladies room. While I was waiting for the restroom, I jumped as the rat ran right in front of my sandals and under a hibachi table. One of the waitresses saw the same thing as I did, and had no reaction whatsoever. I then saw the rat run under another table. I didn't wait for the restroom, I was just so grossed out that I wanted to get out of there. Before leaving, I pulled who looked like the manager aside, and told him what I had seen. He didn't speak the best English, so he didn't say much back to me. As he started looking under the tables, I left. Very concerning to have a rodent in a restaurant, especially if it is carrying diseases. Hoping the health board sees this and does some investigating ASAP! Will not be returning.
2017-09-16,5,Always delicious and always fresh! I've so missed this last few months! Long time customer and I've never been disappointed. I've yet to try their hibachi maybe next time
2017-09-04,1,Pretty small place. Do not trust the people at the door when it comes to wait time. They told us 30 minutes and then after we sat down for about 10, the server came and said it would be 45 more minutes. Yeah maybe find another hibachi spot.
2017-08-31,1,The owner is very rude ! Argued with me because he didn't feel like I tipped the waitress enough!
2017-08-12,5,Everything about our visit here was great. We wanted to take our 2 year old grandson and our daughter for hibachi in Hoboken. The staff was very friendly and accommodating upon our arrival. We ordered and the hibachi chef was great! We go to a lot of hibachi places in Westchester and have never gotten so much food. Only thing that was really lacking was the veggies , seemed like the least expensive items could have been more plentiful, that was disappointing. But everything else was in abundance so much so he was splitting all the extra among us 4. It was also all delicious! The chef was animated and interacted so nicely with our grandson! We will be back!
2017-07-31,4,This is my favorite hibachi spot in jersey! There is never a wait we always get seated right away at the hibachi tables. The food is always delicious and they give you HUGE portions so almost always do we have leftovers! Dinner is pretty quick so it's not a restaurant that takes all day long to serve you. Service is okay nothing exceptional, but the chefs are entertaining. The sushi here is also good and the soft shell crab! Parking sucks overall in this area, but there's usually street parking nearby. I am always craving this food and will be back again soon
2017-07-15,1,My boyfriend found a hair in his food 3 bites in and they still made him pay full price and included tip. I'm disgusted so never again
2017-07-10,2,I have such mixed feelings on my experience at Ayame last night. The positives - The food was delicious and reasonably priced. It's a BYOB also.The negative came after we paid the bill. To set the scene, it was my 31st birthday dinner with my entire family. The bill was around $200 and my parents tipped the hibachi chef after he finished cooking because they wanted to make sure he received a good tip considering he did most of the work - cooking and serving the food. The waitress took our order, brought water, and cleared the plates. After we paid, the hostess came over and asked my Dad if everything was okay. She was acting very odd and kept asking if we enjoyed our evening. She finally cut to the chase and told my Dad that our tip was very low. He explained that he left half of the tip in cash with the chef and the other half on the bill. She continued to push back and argue with him (in public, in front of the whole family).I've never had this happen at a restaurant and was totally disgusted. His tip is up to his discretion, not to mention that between the server and chef, he left more than 20%. If the restaurant doesn't feel this is adequate, they should include gratuity rather than harass customers. Really shitty ending to a great evening!
2017-07-09,4,Originally came here for the Hibachi, unfortunately when we were seated though, the chairs were so cramped back against the wall that it was difficult getting it. After a few attempts to maneuver the chair we opted to sit at a regular table and save the hibachi for another night.We got bento boxes which came with a lot of food and it was all very good! Cant wait to come again and try some of their special sushi rolls, as well as do the hibachi.
2017-07-08,4,Overall the dinner bento box was pretty solid; however, I was disappointed with how packed their hibachi tables were. Some seats against the wall were almost impossible to even fit into.
2017-07-08,5,Frankie. If you are reading this, I want you to know that because of your cooking, your performance, your passion, and your entire being, our lives have changed for the better. Me and a group of 8 other guys (who are well versed with Japanese food) went to this restaurant with pretty high expectations. Let me tell you that the expectations were beyond exceeded. I'll start off with the atmosphere. Every other customer around the tables could be seen smiling and laughing and our group was no different. Next is the chef. Our chef was absolutely beyond exceptional (That's you Frankie!) and gave us the ultimate hibachi experience. He not only made us all more than welcome to the restaurant, he connected with us and showed amazing skill with his art. I call it art because that's exactly what he made it out to be. Fire going everywhere (safely I might add), food flying everywhere, and laughter being a constant factor. The food itself was amazing and the one of us who got the sushi loved that as well. All in all, this was a night none of us will ever forget and we have this restaurant and Frankie to thank for that. Absolutely check this place out if you're ever around it, it is a must try. (And ask for Frankie!)
2017-06-23,4,Delicious sushi!!!! Lots of options with reasonable pricing.  Fast service with a window seat in downtown Hoboken. Not much of else to say - would come back and try more. Only negative is the parking in the area - really really tough. Would suggest walking if possible.
2017-06-06,4,Smaller sized Hibachi, BUT awesome for groups. They have very limited seating towards the front if you are not there for Hibachi so it's best to get there at a reasonable time. The sushi are pretty fair priced and I have no complaints on the quality. It's also BYOB! Have been here multiple times and definitely will be coming back.
2017-06-04,5,This place has the best sushi in Hoboken. There is a large variety of sushi and good appetizers. You can usually get seated right away and there is also outdoor seating. Definitely a place to try out.
2017-05-26,5,LOVVVVE this place! I have never waited longer than 15 minutes for my delivery. Food is always piping hot and delicious. My go to is shrimp tempura roll, spicey tuna "crunch" roll, and a specialty roll. You cannot go wrong. Best sushi delivery in Hoboken. Their ginger dressing for the salad is on point! Rock shrimp tempura is perfectly crisp, not greasy at all and I love that they put the sauce on the side so that it doesn't get soggy! This is a must ! My Friday night delivery spot for sure!
2017-04-08,1,Asked us to move after we were already seated just to make other customers happy. Lucky we are Christian and let this happen.
2017-04-07,1,You could call it a disaster. Call at 7:30, make a reservation for 9, arrive at 9pm - only to be asked how many. Waited 40 minutes to be seated, jumped by a group of 15 who were deemed more important. At least they gave us glasses to drink our BYOB wine at the bar. We then sat at the hibachi table for over a half hour before having our chef arrive. Reservation: 9pm; Start time: 10:25
2017-03-14,3,The food was good nothing extraordinary but it was quite pricey. I went in to grab some takeout and it took quite a while & it was beyond loud like I mean ridiculous I was so glad I didn't decide to dine in.
2017-03-03,2,I ordered here all the time (over 3 years), the food was great but I must say this week I was very disappointed.  I ordered for delivery 3 times this week, not far from the restaurant.  I was told 30-45 mins, after an hour I called the store to follow up on the order, they told me it's on the way, waited another 30 mins. Even walking would take only 15 mins tops. It happened all 3 times this week. it's over 1.5 hour now and I still haven't seen my order yet.  When you tell someone it's on it's way, it shouldn't take another 30 mins and no explanation why it's taking so long and no apologies for the order being late, just "it's on it's way" and hung up. Definitely not what I expected after ordering here for over 3 years.
2017-02-10,3,It's the only hibachi place in Hoboken soooo it doesn't leave you with much to compare, but.... it's pretty good and who doesn't love some hibachi every once and a while! The chefs are friendly and fun and since they aren't always packed you aren't slammed into a table with a ton of people. Food tastes pretty identical to any other hibachi I have had. When Yelp adds half stars I will be happy because I feel like this definitely is more a 3.5. I recommend it on a cold Saturday for a late lunch and long nap after haha.
2017-01-30,4,The place was packed Saturday night. Everyone was having a great time.  Sushi was delicious, fish was very fresh.  All the server's were very nice.  Only downside was the noise level.
2017-01-06,4,Great deal for habachi . Posted below the following 1-6 come wth each habachi order and range from 22-29 but so worth it ! Usually you only get a soup salad and entree  but this place really sets the stage for great deals. 1) soup or salad 2) 2 shrimp 3) entree of your choice (chicken , steak , beef, veggies , shrimp and premium options such as scallops etc.)4) choice of white/ brown or fried ( anything other than white is 2.50 but worth it$ 5) lo mein 6) grilled veggies P.S ITS BOYOB !! All food was delicious and as usual the show the chefs put on serve as great entertainment. This place has a few different tricks/ jokes than the usual repetitive ones which is good too!! place is small so call Ahead !
2017-01-06,5,Hibachi is so nice and entertaining. Sushi is also creative and tasty. Recommend crazy angel.
2016-12-15,4,Usually love this place, the food is great and the environment is always festive. Have been coming here for a long time but giving three stars today because it was not crowded at all yet I had to wait over 30 minutes for the hibachi to start. If this hadn't happened I'd totally give 5 stars. Awesome place for a fun time but sometimes the wait gets both
2016-12-15,1,Hands down the WORST customer service I've ever experienced!  I was excited to order from here because I had a great experience dining in the restaurant, but unfortunately this time was the complete opposite. My order came incomplete with the extra sauces I paid for missing, and the incorrect soup.  The volcano roll was complete mush and inedible. I called to have my order refunded and the restaurant was unwilling to issue a refund or come pick up the food. They even hung up on the grubhub customer service operator.  Grubhub was nice enough to refund the order at their own loss.  Order with great caution, because they will charge you anyways.
2016-11-21,1,The one star is solely for today's service. I've actually been a regular here because I love their sushi and sashimi but the second server who served us today was straight up rude and her attitude was horrible. Aren't you working to get paid? I'm not sure how you expected us to pay you a decent amount of tip with that behavior. She rolled her eyes at me, turned away and waved her hands at me while I was asking her questions and even while making orders (which she had to talk over from the register asking what our order was again because she didn't bother to listen to me beforehand), etc. Fyi, we were one of only two customers that were there so it wasn't even busy. Couldn't even enjoy our meals because of her glaring at us the entire time. After she saw how much we tipped (minimal of course), I guess she realized that she was performing poorly and eagerly asked us how the food was as we walked out the door. Anyways, the first waitress was nice though and she certainly had her manners together.
2016-11-19,4,I ordered some sushi to go from here last night, and everything was amazing! My fiancé and I wanted to share a couple of rolls. I suggest to get the Maki Entree Combo, which includes three rolls (we chose Spicy Yellowtail,  Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Salmon) and a side of soup or salad. We also got a Philadelphia Roll, as well as an Eel Avocado roll. They were sweet enough to call and remind us that the restaurant was closing by 11:30pm (and we set the pick up time for 11:25pm. Whoops!). Everything was delicious. I would order from here again without hesitation.
2016-10-22,5,Delicious rolls, always fresh. I went on a Friday night and the Hibachi area gets really loud with drunk people. Ask to sit in the front area or in the summer months ask to sit outside.
2016-10-17,2,I've tried every sushi spot in this one-horse (well, OK, one-BMW) town, and Ayame doesn't crack my Top 3.  Given the options here, that's saying something.Ayame sushi suffers from a common flaw:  bland, under-seasoned rice that lacks the proper texture.  If you can't get the rice right, you'll never make great sushi, and this place doesn't get it right.  Some Yelp reviews recommend the Playboy roll.  I tried it, and found it borderline gross.  It's all fried ingredients and goopy sauces.  The kind of roll that somehow manages to be distinctly unhealthy, which is hard to pull off.  It's basically sushi for someone who'd rather be eating a burger. For the record, my Hoboken sushi Top 3:  #1 - Okinawa.  #2 - Robongi.  #3 - Hmm, maybe you'd be better off ordering pizza?
2016-09-30,5,Anytime you do a Hibachi dinner you're guaranteed two things: 1. An entertaining night and 2. Full from lots of food. If you don't mind getting food thrown at you (attempts in your mouth that may or may not fail) and fire on the grill that get can super close at times than Ayami Hibachi Grill is your dinner choice for the evening. Let me just say I love that there even exists a hibachi grill in Hoboken. Usually I would make the journey to Mt. Fuji on 17 for this type of dinner but Ayami gets check marks in all the important categories.For the amount you pay for a dish it is worth every penny because you get a ton of food. I ordered the Ayami special for $31 which is the chicken and filet mignon. Any hibachi dinner you order will come with the following: soup/salad, 2 shrimp, white/brown rice (additional $2.50 for fried rice), lo mein, vegetables, and then your dinner. My goodness the food does not stop coming. Everything is cooked how you would want it and is fresh and extremely fun to watch. Trust me when I say you will leave out of there stuffed and for good reason. Plus.....its BYOB! Perfect additional to this already great place. Make sure to check it out and bring your appetite.
2016-09-23,4,I have only done sushi here.  It is a solid sushi place in Hoboken.  Here, Robongi, and Illuzion are the places I would recommend for sushi.  The service and decor are both good.  It is BYOB.  I just love that at a sushi place.  I can't let that influence my rating, but it is great to have that at a sushi restaurant.The menu comes with pictures!  I hate to sound childish, but it really does help!  You can see the roll and judge by what is on it, if you want it.  It is a really good idea.  It does make the place look a little cheesy, but it is so helpful.  I give the place an upgrade for this.The food is big.  They really don't skimp on the roll.  They are robust and you will be very full.  I had the playboy roll, lady gaga roll, spicy scallop roll, salmon avocado roll and the fantasy roll (sharing of course).  They were all big and all yummy.  This place isn't a hardcore strict sushi place.  They have fun with their rolls and it shows.  They do have the classics as well.  They are well stuffed as well.  They have some really good combinations of ingredients.  They have lots of variety and not just spicy sauce and fried this a that everywhere.  Lastly, really firstly for the meal, miso soup.  You can really only mess it up and their soup is good too.I would recommend this to anyone looking for sushi.  You really can't find A+ sushi in Hoboken, but you can still have a great meal here eating sushi.
2016-09-07,3,I've been here twice now for hibachi. It's what you would expect from a standard hibachi restaurant. Food is tasty and you get a lot of it. My plate was jam-packed by the time I got everything. I've had the dinner combo each time which included soup, veggies, noodles, fried rice and a choice of 2 meats/fish. The steak and shrimp were good. They do charge extra for fried rice, but trust me you'll want to get it.Even with reservations last Sunday, we still had to wait a bit to be seated.
2016-09-04,5,Hands down the best sushi place i have ever been to! I am amazed on the customer service i always am presented with here and they make you feel welcomed
2016-08-12,1,My credit card was fraudulently used on 8/4/16 for $137.00.  I live in Virginia.  My card was in Virginia.  You took a card without viewing it.  My bank will be retrieving the money back.
2016-07-22,5,This review is exclusively for the Hibachi which is great. Its slightly pricey, but the portions are quite large. They especially give you lots of rice and noodles, which taste quite good.Pro tip: order slightly less, for two people I recommend a regular order + a side order. They typically don't allow this, but if you tell them you are not that hungry and can only eat that much they generally let it slide. Don't order the shrimp as they give you a couple anyway.I also don't recommend ordering anything that's not hibachi, like sushi, but this is not a recommendation against their other stuff, hibachi is the best stuff they have.Hibachi is extremely good for groups, almost bad to not go in a group of at least 4. Great for family style.
2016-07-15,5,Best sushi delivery in Hoboken. Fish is always fresh, and love their selection of rolls. Have never had a problem with their delivery service - they're always here faster than the estimated time!
2016-07-11,5,Lost count of how many times I've come to this restaurant since my first time there with my family. I, for one, am a pretty picky sushi lover. Yet, I can never get enough of their dragon roll, rainbow pie, and sushi sandwich. Their rock shrimp, dynamite, and hibachi dinners are exceptional as well! Btw, the hibachi chef called Ronald is hilarious and super fun!Definitely recommend this place for parties and get-togethers.
2016-07-11,1,Waited over 2 hrs for delivery with the delivery man telling us over and over for two hrs that he would arrive "in ten minutes". Terrible service and ruined our evening.
2016-05-31,4,Ordered delivery to Jersey City from here via Seamless. I immediately loved their website - great, colorful menu photos and lots of options. The Tiffany roll was great. Decided to get the miso glazed cod (since I've had it at several other places and it was always delicious) and was very disappointed. The $11 appetizer was tiny (see photo). Not impressed with the taste at all which just makes the inadequate portion that much more frustrating. I think I still prefer Okinawa but they close at 10pm and this place is open until 11pm (at least on weekdays) so that's an advantage.
2016-05-18,5,The place was smaller than Teppan in Jersey City. The restaurant was within walking distance from the PATH train station.When I walked in, I was initially given a seat at the front until I told the waiter that I am here for the hibachi. I later sat at the hibachi table where another group of two were already sitting.I ordered the hibachi angus steak with scallops. There was only one hibachi chef. The performance was about 20 minutes long. We had fun, where the chef was entertaining us while grilling the food.I choose to come here by PATH as it was cheaper and more convenient than the NJ Transit buses, which the fare is distance based, as getting to the Port Authority Bus Terminal costs up to $4.50.
2016-05-15,5,This is my go to spot for sushi! Everything is always fresh and delicious. I order the edamame to start and it's always super quick. My favorite special roll is the bagel roll which is deep fried with cream cheese..to die for! I also enjoy their Philadelphia roll, spicy tuna, and California rolls. I've brought friends here before and they love it! I've yet to try the hibachi style dinners but whenever I go the place is always crowded with large parties having a blast doing saki bombs. The chefs are always always fun to watch even if youre not sitting front row! Would definitely recommend!
2016-04-25,4,One of the best restaurants on Washington street. It's not cheap, but I really enjoy their lunch menu roll combos. There's no guilt after eating at Ayame Hibachi.
2016-04-24,2,The teriyaki chicken tastes bland, the veggies under it tastes better. I always thought it's safe to order teriyaki chicken because it's kinda like the same in most japanese restaurants. The spider roll is good though. But what pissed us off is that our server is rude. We just requested our soup to be heated again and he gave us an attitude.
2016-04-02,5,The food was great here glad I came here!I hope they stay open forever! I recommend this place to everyone!
2016-03-30,5,I've been going here for years and the service and food are fabulous!! They know me by name now and I recommend this place for sure!
2016-02-27,5,I went here for a friend's birthday celebration. I really enjoyed the food I ate: calamari, Dynamite (this was my favorite, I highly recommend it), sushi sandwich, tempura ice cream, and more. The service is also great; they accommodated all of my friends' requests quickly. The hibachi chef was also accommodating and was fun to watch the tricks he had.
2016-02-14,5,BYOB and food portions for hibachi are huge! Well worth the money hibachi lunch/dinner includes soup or salad, noodles, vegetables, meat or vegetables and sauces. Vegetarian go to is the vegetable hibachi lunch or dinner portion.
2016-02-10,5,Ayame is great! The service is good and the hibachi chef is amazing! He was really funny and put us all in a great mood, which definitely made the meal more enjoyable. The appetizers we ordered, (beef negimaki, sushi sandwich, sushi cake, and dynamite) are to die for! There was a great balance between the food and the sauce so all the great flavors were there. For hibachi, I would definitely recommend the filet mignon, which was tender and perfectly cooked, and the salmon, also very tender and fresh! Don't forget to finish the meal with some fried ice cream for dessert!
2016-02-10,4,tastes good and good services on hibachi. But, sushi here is a little too salty for me.
2016-01-21,5,Food is great! Just want to add a tip, if you're eating hibachi get in on all the fun. Catch the zucchini in your mouth, take pictures and videos, and even drink some sake if you want (or kids sake- sprite). Have a great time and you'll be fine.
2016-01-08,5,ayame is a solid choice for Japanese food in Hoboken. The service is professional and the quality of the meal is always high.A friend and I were celebrating and ordered:Spicy girl roll   Which is real yummy !Playboy roll and mango dragon roll Overall, the food is excellent. The roll had very good sized cuts, very fresh fish and melt in your mouth textures. Do expect to drop a good amount of money here once you figure out how to read the menu. As the ingredient quality is superb and the service is attentive, I think is definitely worth it.
2016-01-04,3,This was one of my first times out for dinner in Hoboken. Only reason we decided Hibachi was because my cousins had never had it before (shocking, I know). Con: Anyways, we had parked our car right in front of the place and STILL didn't recognize the place because the sign for it was SO small. We walked back and forth a few times until we realized it -_- We opened the door to a sweaty, disorganized, chaotic, and cramped room. In the tiny dining place they had crammed as many seats and tables as they possibly (there were 5 Hibachi tables). Our reservation was for 7:30pm and we were seated at 8:15pm which was kind of annoying that we had to wait, but it made sense because it was SO crowded (btw, we went on a Sat night). Con: Once we sat down we didn't have to wait too long to place our orders, however our waiter was so rude. My cousin had a few questions on the menu (because she had never had hibachi before) and he just mumbled with "can you just place your order please" he COMPLETELY disregarded her!!! wth! I understand it was busy, but that was no way to treat a paying customer. Pro: The food was really good! This is why I rated it 3 stars instead of 1. The chef was friendly, funny, and accommodating. Side note: The interior of this place def needs some remodeling. I noticed there were Christmas decorations up (random red stockings taped to the walls along with a wreath). There was a big 'Happy Birthday' banner hung on one of the walls, and there were pictures of flowers, sailboats, and butterflies hung up. How does any of that relate?!
2015-12-25,4,Excellent food and wonderful food and company on Christmas Day !!  Service slightly off had to request tea and water refills but otherwise great !
2015-12-18,1,I used to enjoy coming here, but after being treated rudely, with disrespect, I can assure you that won't be happening again. We waited for a hibachi table for a half hour, which we were understanding to since we did not have a reservation. After waiting for a half hour, they finally came over and said that they don't actually have a table for us. If they had told us that from the start I would have been understanding, but after a half hour wait I was not appreciative. The manager we dealt with was rude and unapologetic regarding the issue, we will not be going back.
2015-12-07,5,Great sushi and spot in Hoboken. BYOB too! Staff is friendly, restaurant is clean and the sushi is great.
2015-12-01,5,Yummy and delicious sushi ,all the fish is fresh ,Came here several times, never let me down And the waiters so nice,food server very fast,My overall experience here was really good  I plan on coming back other weekends. And small tips, if you want to try hibachi,you would better make a reservation  ,coz  sooooooo busy on weekends .
2015-11-28,3,Food is good. BUT there is a waitress with extremely long hair. It smacked my boyfriend in the face 3 times during dinner! Unpleasant experience and unacceptable. She didn't notice it either! Must happen a lot.
2015-11-22,1,I've been here before in 2012, for the first time. I remember it being good. BYOB. I went here for lunch over the weekend. The restaurant was dark. I like when the lights are dimmed but we were relying on the sunlight from the front of the store, haha. There were 3 waiters sleeping on the tables toward the back. Legitimately sleeping. A few others on their phones, including my waitress. Couldn't get her attention, she was busy on her phone.Halfway into eating my salad, I found a hair. They didn't really handle it well. The communication was off. Then the habachi wasn't good- the qaulity of the rice alone was poor. The entire dish was drenched in sauce. It was disappointing. Weird experience. The waitresses would just walk away and go talk to the manager about it. Manager didn't even know the dishes on the menu. Not coming back. Not worth it.
2015-10-25,1,Skip it Overpriced and while BYOB is nice I couldn't drink enough to get drunk enough to ignore absolutely poor service today.      We were there for lunch and California rolls sat ready for us for 12 minutes while 4 workers sat in back staring at the phonesWhat did me in was the chicken was so chewy and grossWhile more expensive nothing beats benne hanaSkip this
2015-10-22,4,Good Sushi and overall love the vibe on Washington street (this place is middle of all action). Navigation inside with a big group can be tight. Food was awesome, went for a business dinner with a co-worker and it was well worth it. The servers can be trained much more better in serving and kitchen skills.
2015-10-12,5,Food is excellent!! BYOB is a plus! Thou the server needs a little more training since he wasn't too familiar with our orders! But who cares! The food is outstanding!!
2015-09-02,1,First time there the servers are very rude after they messed up the order. I thought I'd give them a second opportunity...should have known better. Had dirt in my water cup this time.
2015-07-20,3,Hibachi was ok. Liked the fried rice and the steak was cooked well. Wasn't a fan of the flavors of the sauce on the vegetables and steak. The noodles were not great. Just meh. Wouldn't pay almost 30 dollars again for mediocre food. Haven't tried the sushi so I can't speak to that.
2015-07-12,1,Came here before and was okay. However, we placed an order from this place and while we received our food in a timely manner, we discovered a cigarette butt in our hibachi dinner. Disappointed and grossed out. :(
2015-06-29,5,The day I chose to eat here it was pouring outside-- but that doesn't matter because I had the best experience! The hibachi chef was very friendly and funny. He really got us all involved in the show. The food was SO good, the noodles were cooked to perfection as well as the rest of the food. After dinner they brought me some green tea ice cream which I love.I recommend coming here for a birthday event. This place is also BYOB.
2015-06-20,1,I would love to start off saying how much I used to love Ayame. The food used to be amazing, have great prices, generous portions, byob, etc. Unfortunately, the prices have gone up, the food quality has gone down, and the portions have gone down tremendously. It is still BYOB which is great but it's not enough to continue to give them service. Tonight, they gave my boyfriend double chicken on his plate and then asked him to give half of it to the lady next to us bc the cook messed up and didn't give her any. Besides this being a violation, how disgusting is it to have to give/take food from a stranger. They also charge extra for fried rice and I didn't even get enough rice to fit in a small bowl so I was not happy. I love hibachi but this place has just gone down a lot lately
2015-05-06,5,Came in for dinner with a big group of friends and we had an absolute blast. Everything in my previous review holds true but I would like to say that this is a GREAT place to have dinner w/ a large group - TONS of food, great and friendly staff, fun atmosphere. Come in for a meal, you will have a blast.
2015-04-29,1,NEVER AGAIN!We had a 4 person reservation at 8:45pm, which they called to confirm earlier that day.  Below is a timeline of how it went, with respective patience levels from 1-10 (10 being very patient, 1 being no patience):8:40PM -- We arrived on time, and told we would be seated in "a few minutes."  So, we waited in a cramped area between the sushi bar and cashier station, along with several other impatient parties waiting to be seated. (Patience Level: 9)9:00PM -- I could't help but notice that each Hibachi table was occupied by a large party that hadn't even ordered yet, and one that just started to have their meal prepared.  I mention my observation to the manager, and noted that it was obvious we wouldn't be seated for some time.  He said, probably 20 minutes or so. Upset by the fact it should have been apologetically mentioned and was not, we decided to patiently wait another 20 minutes. (Patience Level: 6)9:20PM -- It is clear that the table who was having their food prepared was in the process of paying, and we would have a table shortly.  Then, to my surprise, a large group of about 15 girls came in from waiting outside, and appeared excited to sit at the opening table  I politely told one of them that it was likely our table since we had an 8:45 reservation, however, she informed me that it was certainly theirs because they had a 8:30.  Meanwhile, none of the other tables look anywhere near finished.  Now, they're testing my patience (Patience Level: 3)9:30PM -- I once again mention to the manager that this is a bit unacceptable, and his explanation is that "people arrived late."  I told him if that was the case, they should have lost their reservation, especially if it was late enough to cause a 45 minute seating delay.  He just rudely laughed at me. (Patience Level: 2)9:45PM -- I watch the manager tell one of the waitresses to put the pressure on one of the tables to pay their check and leave.  Great for me, horrible for that guest.  In their defense, most of the people still seated have paid and are simply drinking their BYOB shots/wine. (Patience Level: 1)9:55PM -- We are finally seated over 1h 10m late.  At this point I'm just happy to eat because I was starving upon arrival, but at the very least I am expecting a reasonable discount (10-15%) for such an unreasonable wait. I mention this to the manager and he agrees.  (Patience Level: 4)10:05 -- We place both our appetizer and entree orders, and within minutes a chef is beginning to prepare food. (Patience Level: 4)10:15 -- Our appetizers come out (couple sushi rolls) and they were mediocre at best. Simultaneously, we are served our hibachi entrees, which was just as mediocre.  For me this is a big no-no, and should be for anyone.  It makes you feel rushed, and any good, self-respecting restaurant knows this. They're obviously in a pickle, and having worked in a restaurant, I slightly sympathize.  (Patience Level: 3)10:35 -- We have finished out meals, and we ask for the check.  The check comes, and their is no discount applied.  I explain this to the waiter and he calls over the manager, who then asks me what the issue is, despite having agreed to compensate us for our ridiculously long wait.  He says he will be right back. (Patience Level: 1)10:40 -- The manager comes back to tell us he is not able to provide any kind of discount he originally agreed to.  I angrily express my discontent as respectfully as possible.  He then says "If you want 15% off then don't pay a tip."  It was then I absolutely lost it.  I could not believe that a restaurant manager would even consider suggesting we screw over an innocent (though, not so terrific) server, because of his inability to properly manage the place.  We paid our bill, and personally handed the waiter his tip in cash. (Patience Level: -94945034980845)I WILL NEVER, EVER, GIVE THIS PLACE BUSINESS FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE, AND I WILL ALSO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE NOBODY I KNOW DOES EITHER.MANAGER OF AYAME:  If you are reading this... I would like you to know that you are a complete and utter embarrassment to ever suggest a patron screw a waiter on a tip due to your own inability to properly manage your establishment.  You should be ashamed of yourself.   I wish you the worst of luck.
2015-04-23,4,This is the best place for a large party - girl's night, a birthday, etc.  It's BYOB and the food is great. They will take a reservation for a large group at the Hibachi table even on the weekends. The hibachi chefs are always fun and engaging with the group and everything tastes fantastic! The sushi is also yummy in case not everyone wants hibachi. They are also great for take out - quick and always correct.
2015-04-11,3,The hibachi chef is fun and the whole experience is entertaining.  The food tastes good and there was plenty of it.  The only downside is the management it seems, this guy was constantly pacing around miserably, changed my kids chairs for no apparent reason and rushed us out as soon as we were taking our last bites.  As I was walking out, the staff was literally pushing me out the door and closing it on my back.  That was weird.  But we will still go back since it's fun and love the BYOB.  PS they seem to have cut back on the watered down saki.
2015-04-01,5,I absolutely love this place. The food is excellent, both sushi and hibachi. My boyfriend and I go here and order 1 hibachi meal and a bunch of sushi rolls to share. I find the hibachi to actually taste better when you sit at a regular table and have it made in the kitchen. The out of control roll is my all time favorite sushi roll.
2015-03-29,1,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. The owner was very RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL and RACIST. We were there on a cold evening night celebrating my friend's wedding anniversary. We made reservation for 6 PM for a party of 15 people. We arrived about five minutes late. The owner indicated that our table was already taken and we will have to wait. Well, after two minutes he told our party to wait outside. We told him "it is cold outside." He said "I don't care just wait outside."I have been to many restaurants in the country before. I have never been DISRESPECTED, HUMILIATED, and "KICKED-OUT" of a restaurant before, less without being seated.Please find a better Hibachi & Sushi restaurant in the area, there are plenty of them.
2015-03-26,4,always nice to find a good sushi place! place was packed when we got in around 830 for a Saturday night dinner. A lot of people doing hibachi, we were there just for sushi. I got the triple color sushi combo for 30 bucks. came with 9 pieces of sushi and a special roll that I cant remember... so a total of about 15-16 pieces I'd say, a bit pricey but most places are these days. It's a BYOB place so that's always a good deal. Saw one of the hibachi chefs do a trick where his hat was supposed to light on fire and he ended up lighting up his whole back... hahaha and he was so boss about it and just walked off into the kitchen like nothing happened. I think that's a hibachi chef's equivalent to dropping the mic.Service was good, food came out quickly and they didn't rush us to leave. I wouldn't mind coming back here!
2015-03-14,4,Who knew there was hibachi in Hoboken?! Came with a group of 4 on a Friday night and it was great! Really fun and lively but not too crowded either. The hibachi chefs were great and the food was awesome. I tried the red snapper and salmon which were both notably awesome. My friend got a Kani salad that really looked good. No one got sushi but I will be back to try it. The only reasons for the deduction of a star was they charged us for side noodles when we didn't order them (noodles are included with hibachi), and when we told them they took that off the bill and then added fried rice. My friend did order fried rice w/her hibachi (yes it's an extra $3...) but it felt like adding the noodles instead initially and then adding the rice they were trying to pull one over on us. Just at your bill closely! Also unlike other hibachi, you don't get ice cream or any dessert. Lame!
2015-03-12,4,I love Ayame. The service is great, prices are fair, food is delicious, and it's a byob. What more can you ask for? The fried rice is my favorite and I loved the scallop/salmon combo I got the last time I went but you will probably be satisfied with anything here. Oh and they always keep the saki flowing! Can't wait to go back!
2015-03-07,1,Wow, I had been here a few times and this was by far the worst experience Treated us like cattle and seated us at a terrible table. Rude, rude rude service, mediocre food and the cook wasn't even funny. If it wasn't for the fact that my daughters find it entertaining I would never go back.
2015-02-24,4,Food was delicious!! Its BYOB so the crowd is very young and Loud. Great for a big group of people. definitely make a reservation because this place gets packed easily!
2015-02-17,1,What a terrible experience. I went here with a few friends over the weekend and I wish  I had not. Ayame's waiters provided the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  SERVICEThe service single handedly ruined my night. My friends and I were repeatedly asked if we were done with our food after 20min of receiving it. They seemed to be rushing us which was the first strike. The bill came and we asked for it to be split. Once we received the split checks, we noticed the waiter added an additional money to the checks. Strike 2. We told him about the extra charge and he seemed confused about it until about 15 seconds later he realized his "mistake." Once the bill was corrected, the waiter hawked my table down as just a few feet away as we signed off on the bills. We had not gotten up to leave our table yet and the waiter comes rushing to out table, snatches the receipt off the table to see if their was a tip. Stike 3. I was disgusted with this behavior and based on other reviews, Ayame needs to properly train their waiters in common courtesy and hospitality. They made me feel utterly uncomfortable. FOODDecent. Nothing special. I ordered a hibachi meal and the food came out in 5 minutes which was odd. I would not recommend.
2015-02-16,1,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!Let me start off by saying, I LOVE Hibachi so I was excited to dine here with my friends yesterday (2/15/2015).  When we arrived, the host was friendly and sat us immediately.  My party and I were weary about eating here because of how cold it was, it was one of the coldest winter days and they didn't have the heat on.  We literally saw our breath inside of the restaurant, that's how cold it was.  I felt like they were relying on the flames from the hibachi grill to heat the restaurant.  Despite the cold, we stayed to eat. The waitress took our order, the food came, everything about that process was pretty standard.  I will mention, one of the people in my party attempted to order brown rice and the waitress was VERY adamant that she really should order the fried rice, it was very uncomfortable and considering the fried rice is two bucks more, very assumptive. The quality of the food was ehh. My noodles were significantly colder than everything else.  I've definitely had better tasting hibachi for the same price, the quality was definitely disappointing but it wasn't horrible.  HORRIBLE is what happened after we ate, so the bill comes and I guess for hibachi it's pretty standard.  There are four people in our party, we split the bill in half (two cards) and when the receipts returned to the table, the waitress had charged each card an additional TEN dollars, so pretty much, if we hadn't been paying attention, Ayame would have received a free $20 bonus, in addition to whatever percentage we were going to tip.  After talking to management, we were each refunded our $10.00 (in the form of cash) but only after it was suggested by staff to take that money and leave it for tip SMH!!! VERY FREAKING ASSUMPTIVE. What kind of logic is that? You over charge us $20, then instead of refunding the money initially, you suggest we just put that money towards the tip? What if we wanted to leave a cash tip? What if we wanted to tip more than that or less? We did get the money back though, but the ultimate turn off was when another waiter came to our table and asked us if we were going to leave a cash tip, I've never been asked that by a waiter before.  I understand the importance of tipping your waiter and if you're good, I'll hook you up but not only was the food mediocre and the service bleh, you are pushing me to tip, I don't need a friendly reminder. That's rude and uncomfortable.  Never going back to Ayame and I highly suggest, if you're craving hibachi, you don't either.xoxo,Court
2015-02-04,4,Obsessed with hibachi? This place is pretty good. Came here with my friend last weekend for dinner. Totally should have made a reservation, this place was packed when we talked in. As busy as it was they had a table ready for us within 15 minutes. We wanted to sit at the hibachi grill but again didn't make a reservation so that was our bad. We sat at a regular table and were still able to order hibachi even though we weren't at the grill - a lot of places normally don't do this so we were super happy! I ordered the shrimp hibachi and let me tell you - THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE! Seriously, if I realized how much food they were going to give me I would have brought a family of 4 haha, had left overs for daysssss. The food here was good, but nothing out of this world. Pretty standard. Will definitely come back, next time i'll be making a reservation though. PS ITS BYOB, don't forget your booze!!
2015-01-12,3,I'm giving this 3 stars because the food here was phenomenal, but the customer service was absolutely terrible.  I made a reservation at 6, they seated us, and then didn't wait on us for an HOUR.  The chef arrived at our table at 7. Luckily the chefs personalities and amazing cooking skills made up for the terrible service- but I may be eating at other hibachi places if I have a large party again.
2015-01-05,2,Oh Ayame you were A-OK I guess but the most recent experience causes me to say you are "meh". Knowing you're the only hibachi in town does not a great dining experience make. I have been 4-5 times here and every time is just kind of average. Now, if you are lucky enough to get at the Hibachi grills most of those chefs are pretty great and enjoyable. Most times we've been we have been larger groups.Now, this last time was New Year's Eve. Trust me I get it, large groups suck and can be a pain. I worked in the business I know the pain it  can sometimes cause. But, they are customers and should be treated accordingly. We had booked the reservation about a month out from Dec. 31st. And subsequently the person who reserved it called back 4 times between then to confirm and adjust numbers by 1-2. At around 1pm on the day of the reservation a not so friendly manager called to say they are going to cancel our reservation unless we gave them a credit card and charged us $100. This was never part of the deal. Basically they held our reservation for ransom. And the dude was a jerk about it.We suck it up and pay, because it's too late to get a reservation anywhere else except Johnny Rocket's for a large group, like I said...held for ransom. The manager was so nasty when seating us, aggressive and basically inconvenienced by the large group coming in all at once (per their request), he was yelling numbers out 10-12 how many do you have?! It was just awful service.The wait staff was pretty much non existent. They kind of took our order, just hovering over us and not even asking who they wanted to go next or, 'what would you like" just standing there. It was awkward. Our meals came out piecemeal (pun intended of course), a hot dish here, a sushi dish here, nothing was consistent. They just literally yelled across the table what the order was until one of us raised our hands. The wait staff just weren't good. My food was ok, it was a chicken dish, it was kinda boring and I added a bunch of soy sauce. Everyone else liked their sushi. I don't eat it so I can't comment on that.When it came for the bill, they brought it to us without the already charged $100. We were not happy, so we said something and the jerky manager finally voided the original $100 charge. Well, after this debacle the original check didn't have gratuity added, but after we complained about the $100 magically gratuity was added. They knew how bad the were and they knew we were not happy. I would never stiff anyone but they were afraid we were.Overall I will never come back here after this service and so/so food.
2015-01-04,4,The special rolls here are delicious. I got the Hoboken monster roll and loved it. Fun atmosphere with the hibachi tables in the back, and it's a byob which is nice too. Service was good. Will definitely come again.
2014-11-22,1,I always enjoyed this restaurant until we have food poisoned last night. The fish was not fresh and the tastes of our orders were awful. Although we complained about it, they did not seem that they care about our concerns. When I told the waiter that there was something wrong with our orders, he just smiled as if he knew about the problem.
2014-11-15,4,Awesome place!! The chef was super cool :) delicious food and the fact you can BYOB makes it 10x better! Def recommend you to check it out and sit by the sushi bar .
2014-11-12,3,Not The best Japanese restaurant in the world but there are not many options in Hoboken.
2014-11-01,4,Had a late lunch here. We ate outside, which was nice. My friend loved the sushi roll (Tiffany Roll & White Dragon Roll). They're specials were pretty good as well. Except I did feel a little rushed when they brought the bill with the dessert (Green Tea Tempura ice cream). I would go back again.
2014-10-26,4,When you show up for hibachi you always get more than just a meal, the chefs put on quite a show.  I have been to a few hibachi places now and Ayame can hang with the rest.I spent $19 on red snapper, rice, noodles, veggies, a show, and saki being poured into my mouth.  Woo!  I also volunteered to have veggies thrown in my mouth too.  If you have never done hibachi before, just go for it.  You also get a special treat if its your birthday.Ayame is the first hibachi place I am aware of to setup in Hoboken and it is certainly worth a try if you have never experienced hibachi before.
2014-09-29,5,I have tried every sushi spot in Hoboken more than once and Ayame takes the cake.  It's reasonably priced for the market area and the food is always fresh and delicious.  Their fish never disappoints.  For the tuna lovers, I recommend the Sweetheart roll and the Tuna Boy sashimi.
2014-09-01,2,As sushi goes, it's solidly C+, which for Hoboken equals A-.Not sure what it is they're passing off as Lobster tail, but it eats like a rubbery piece of composite fishstuff. Stellar for Hoboken. Would be laughed off the block in Brooklyn (which Hoboken so desperately wants to be).
2014-08-21,4,Food was delicious.  Me and the hubby enjoyed the different arrays sushi and sashimi they had.  We got our usual rolls but changed it up with some differant items like Tuna apple Sashimi, Sushi Sandwich, and Cajun Tuna Tataki.  No complaints here on their originality.  Best part is I didnt walk out hungry and my pockets didnt feel like they were robbed. Price was really decent for a place in Hoboken.
2014-08-19,3,Went with a large group and did the whole byo hibachi shebang. I don't get why gainfully employed adults want to get sprayed in the face with bottom quality sake (aka lighter fluid) out of a ketchup bottle, but gotta admit it was entertaining to watch. There was a bevy of bachelorettes there that evening as well, which was quite a treat. Overall, the show was the star of the evening, not the food. The hibachi was typical but overcooked and my food was slathered in so much of that hibachi sauce it was almost inedible. No one else had any complaints, though, so will chalk that up to unlucky exception. Come prepared or mediocre food and great people watching and you will not be disappointed!
2014-08-12,5,I like it---a lot. The soup, the salad, the sushi... everything. Japanese food is always healthy and clean.
2014-08-08,5,This place is owned by the same people as the former establishment Aroma.. which was a chinese food place 3 blocks downtown from Ayame. I'm a fan of both places and order takeout regularly. The quality of the food is always spot on, and the costs for Hoboken are competitive. I always find it mind-boggling when I see no wait for outdoor seating at Ayame, but two stores down people at Robongi are waiting on the sidewalk. Ayame is BYOB (who doesn't like that?!), and the sushi is tasty and fresh. Also don't forget this is the only Hibachi place in town.... They cater for birthday parties and the chef pours sake into your mouths too sometimes! What I think is a steal is the "maki combo"... 3 rolls for $13! Nobody can beat that! And it comes with soup or salad! I will admit the roll options for dinner are pretty basic, but I get around that by ordering the lunch special maki combo (lunch is considered 12-4 ) and that has way more roll options... and you get 3 rolls, soup, AND salad for lunch all for $12.If you don't want basic rolls like the maki combo offers, the special rolls are gigantic and well worth the money. There's also a ton of options on the menu to cater to your liking. My favorite menu item? Try the Tuna Dumplings... SO DELICIOUS! It's basically a "dumpling" made with Tuna on the outside, filled with spicy crab and avocado and some special sauce inside. SO GOOD.
2014-08-06,5,Loved the sushi! I'm very picky with my sushi and loved this place. Tried it for the first time due to a friend and was delighted. BYOB and amazing food.
2014-07-06,1,I give this place a 1 star because of the terrible service we received today. PARENTS, here is why I will never take my children back here again:Terrible rude SERVICE: When the waiter came to ask what we wanted he was so annoyed that we were not to order yet. 1) Ok our fault for being ~10 mins late to our reservation but there was only one other couple sitting in the restaurant (not at habachi table). 2) We have kids so it's not that easy to just sit down and order within a few mins. Besides, I double checked their website, they are open 12-10:30pm. So what if it's lunch time for the employees? If they don't want to serve customers during their lunch hr, then they should close the restaurant down for their lunch time!Our friends' 2-year-old was frightened by the fire trick and got scared every time the habachi chef made any kind of gestures with the spatulas. The chef kept making fun of him like "awe, poor baby" and "awe just go to your mommy". REALLY? The kid is 2 yrs old!!! Kids cannot help that the get scared! And he kept making snide comments. My fed-up point was when the chef said "SHUT UP... ha haha". REALLY, he said THAT?!?! However, if our friends were not going to say anything, I didn't think it was my place to say anything at the time. In retrospect, I really should have! That was so mean and unacceptable! #1 who says that to a customer? #2 who in their right mind would yell at a 2-yr-old like that?!? Even if it was a "joke"!FOOD: We've eaten here a couple of times before and thought the food was okay. That's why we decided to take the kids there. But the habachi experience this second time around has left a BAD tasted in my mouth.  The sushi is standard: 3 stars (though I think Robongi is better). The habachi taste wise is 2.5 stars because my salmon was just a little too salty and dry for my taste. The noodles had no flavor except for the soy sauce flavoring. (And just for the record, my first time at Ayame was mediocre too but at least the chef didn't make fun of anyone.)In conclusion, I won't be coming back here as there are plenty of sushi restaurants in Hoboken that has similar or better food. And I am just annoyed with the TERRIBLE service.
2014-06-21,5,Really good sushi. Reasonable pricing (you can get out under 40.00 for two easy)   Staff is super nice. Don't go on the weekends unless u like the annoying crowd.
2014-06-20,3,Hibachi good time, chef is an entertainer, fried rice, steak, scallops, BYOB, noodles, veggies. Food is A-OK... nothing to rave about. Come here for the cooking antics. It is a bit gimmicky but its fun for the family.
2014-05-30,4,Ayame serves you tasty Sushi and appetizers. Plain and simple. Their sushi offerings are so varied and interesting and price is not so expensive as well. They also offer Hibachi although I never tried it but saw the cooks performing and it looks like a fun experience. The servers and owners are very considerate and offer great service. The place is really clean and I cannot recommend this place enough. Our favorite sushi place!
2014-04-15,4,BYOB!!!! Pretty reasonable. Small but cozy. Food was good for price...not overly crowded. Good to go with group. You will feel like you rented the place out. Service was decent. I mean byob makes it worth it!!!
2014-04-08,5,I would give them 4 stars but they get 5 stars by default. After visiting many sushi restaurants I jersey and NYC Ayame is the only one that reminds me of California sushi. This is the I only place I can go and not have to worry about being bored or unfulfilled. Good service, FRESH fish, nice portions, good value. All this outweighs the ambiance and what ever at other sushi bars especially in Hoboken. Fast delivery as well.
2014-04-03,5,This place never disappoints! My husband and I order sushi from Ayame quite often (basically weekly, if not more) and we are continually pleased with the quality of both the food and the service. From the cheerful lady taking the order on the phone to the quick delivery and fresh sushi, Ayame does a great job! On the very rare occasion a mistake was made with our order, they more than made up for it on the following order. They have great signature rolls.  Oh... And I highly recommend the yellowtail jalapeño appetizer and the tuna apple sashimi!  In my experience, this is the best sushi place in Hoboken if you're looking for delivery. Two thumbs up!!
2014-03-31,1,it's sad really.  hoboken needed a "go-to" sushi place.  i thought this was it.  we ordered from there a handful of times and it was pretty good.   it's expensive: $55 for 2 people. but ultimately, it WAS the best sushi in hoboken.  we ordered from there 3.29.14 and it was bad.  like really bad.   i ordered 3 different spicy rolls that weren't spicy at all.   the soft shell crab was pretty nasty and it looked VERY old. It was painfully obvious that it was not made for my order.   i'm hoping that it was an anomaly, but  it will be tough to try it again at $50+.  i think the moral here is that hoboken can not sustain a good sushi place.  food is 2 stars, but when coupled with the co$t, it's a 1 star joint.
2014-03-23,1,I'm not sure what has happened to this place in the last 2 years but I won't be going back here.  The sushi quality has gone down and the service is absolutely terrible.  We had a reservation as a group for 8 people for 9:30pm.  We got there and proceeded to wait almost 45 minutes until we were able to be seated - it was very clear that no effort was made to hold the seats until our reservation which we were 5 or 10 minutes early for.  If you have no intentions of holding tables for people that is fine but DO NOT accept reservation then.When we finally did get seated it was nearly 10:15 and the place pretty much died down.  The 2 people waiting on us clearly did not want to be there and barely even answered a couple questions I had for them.  No smile, no water refills until I somehow managed to get their attention while they were in the back looking at their phones.  (The hibachi chef was great though)By the time our meal was wrapping up around 11 and the only other people in the restaurant left it was a full on rude push to get us to leave.  All of the staff was standing at the kitchen (probably about 10 of them) staring at us and made me really uncomfortable.  Someone who I presume was the manager made a comment to one of the other people about how we should go.  When I walked outside I expected to see that they closed at 10:30 or 11 - that we were the last seating and the staff really wanted to leave.  Not that that's any justification for the way we were treated but I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt.  That's when I checked the hours and saw that on Friday's they are supposed to be open until 11:30!  It was not even 10 minutes after 11pm when I was outside - a full 20 minutes before they were supposed to close.  Now I've worked at restaurants in total for several years when I was younger and as frustrating as it is to have to wait on people to leave so you can do your sidework and get out of there - I was never frustrated with people if they were there while we are technically OPEN or for a little bit after we were closed.  I can't imagine any restaurant/manager I'd ever worked for tolerating a tenth of the attitude and rudeness.  And it wasn't one person - it was the entire staff.  Ayame used to be my go to sushi & hibachi place but if I want sushi I'll be going to Illuzion! Way better sushi and much friendlier.
2014-03-15,5,This place is a not-so-hidden gem.  It seems like most people go here for hibachi but their sushi is the best I have had in Hoboken/Jersey City.  The sushi is phenomenal and extremely well priced.
2014-02-25,4,I had a blast here.  Food was good, prices were great. But best part is BYOB..  Would definitely come back for another party again..
2014-02-13,1,I had made a reservation 4 weeks in advance for a birthday, and I invited 6 of our friends in from out of town to celebrate.  Do not ever expect them to honor your reservation.  The manager was extremely rude to me and my friends when we asked when we would be sat.  He shrugged his shoulders and said "Whenever.."  I do not usually lose my cool in situations like this, but when he laughed at me when I was inquiring as to why I wasn't being sat an HOUR after my reservation was scheduled, I could not take it!  This was all after the manager was ignoring me and serving cake to another party.  When I asked to take my wine, beer, and cake back, he acted like he didn't know what I was talking about.  Again, I had to get loud and angry myself until he would go in the back and look for our things.  This was extremely disappointing because I had previously had a very positive experience here, but I have to say, that as a Hoboken local, I will NOT be returning after being treated so rudely, and I will also not be providing a positive review to anyone that asks about this place.
2014-02-11,1,Do not expect them to keep your reservation. We had a large party for a birthday and they delayed us. Fine, no problem, when we came back 30 min later they said there was no way to accommodate us and our party. Extremelydisappointed in how they handled that when we had our reservation weeks in advance.
2014-01-21,4,Went here on a Friday night If you are looking for a nice quite night, or a date night this is not really the place. It was loud, and tightly packed - which depending on what you are looking for, could be a lot of fun. The hibachi was pretty tasty and BYOB is always awesome. They opened our bottle of wine and gave us glasses right away. Services is 'meh' at best. We got seated fairly quickly but our sushi we ordered took a while and there seemed to be some general confusion, Overall - good food and fun place.
2014-01-18,5,Amazing sushi, great service. We come here once a week although they're many other sushi restaurants in the area we continuously go to this one. Get the playboy roll.
2014-01-10,1,NEVER AGAIN! Not only did the sushi come unrolled, it made me sick. Even worse, mid-meal the owner asked my party to move seats to accommodate the next party....so rude. Never again will I go for bad, rushed food with TERRIBLE service.
2014-01-07,1,We walked in, smelled the dirty old grease smell, saw all the staff standing around looking bored and annoyed.   We sat down, but the old grease smell was too much, we got up and left and went next door to Robongi.   I'm writing this in case the owners ever check the reviews for feedback.   They have to do something about the smell in there.  Of course the first step is to change the frying oil, the second step is to give the place a good scrub.
2013-12-29,1,Ate here during the holidays and was incredibly disappointed. The quality of the sushi is very low. It tasted like the freezer it was stored in.  I ordered a sushi/sashimi platter and could hardly eat it. The tuna was horrific and I got sick at the restaurant as a result. To add insult to injury they informed us that they were closing early AFTER we sat down and they took our order.  The only thing half decent was the soft shell crab, and the specialty roll we ordered wasn't as disgusting as the rest of the food. Most likely because it was made with shrimp tempura and well masked by the rice. I eat sushi frequently and this was one of the worst sushi experiences I have ever had. Certainly not a trust worthy sushi restaurant by any means. I can't speak to the hibachi and have no plans of returning to try it either.
2013-12-07,1,I still have to say that the food is great, the sushi is fantastic but extremely disappointed at how the management handled the situation when my wife discovered a cockroach crawling around between her plate and our son's. She caught the roach and placed it in a napkin to bring to the manager. When she showed him, he proceeded to take the napkin and throw it away in the trashcan, told her to sit down, continue eating and that he'd take care of it. Needless to say, my son and wife lost their appetite and didn't finish their meals. His version of taking care of this situation was taking $30 off our bill. Sorry, that doesn't cut it. Also while we were there, the hibachi chef was going through his cooking routine for another group that was seated where we were. While he was juggling his cooking utensils, the spatula fell on the floor. You'd think he'd replace it with a clean one or wipe it off? No, he continued cooking with it.Eat here at your own risk. As much as our family loved eating here, time to eat somewhere else.
2013-11-17,3,Stopped into Ayame a few Friday nights ago with some friends.  There was a wait but it wasn't too long before we were seated.  We chose the seats in the front of the restaurant, not at the Tepanyaki (sp?) tables.We had brought a bottle of wine with us (I love a good BYO, policy) and they brought out a container to keep it cold.We started off with an order of Beef Negimaki and Wasabi Shumai.  The shumai were good but we all LOVED the negimaki.  Tightly rolled strips of beef that were juicy and flavorful.  YUM.I had the Godzilla roll for my meal.  I believe it had spicy tuna, spicy shrimp, and spicy scallop involved some how.  It was good and I would get it again on my next visit.Everything was priced reasonably, I thought.Our service was ok, not great, but I blame that on a busy Friday night.
2013-11-10,1,I used to eat there when it's just opened and the sushi was good, however now that's it's been open for a while not only the sushi is really bad, and the fish is not fresh but also the service is very bad, many times they miss something in the order and when you call it's sometimes so load that you have to scream over the phone to be heard.
2013-11-03,5,I LOVE this place, this is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken.  The fish is always so fresh, the service is great and it's BYOB.I've been here many times and I've never had a disappointing experience.  The delivery is super fast too.  I'll place an order and it's at my door within 30 mins.  I highly recommend this place.  I haven't had the Hibachi yet, but I hear goo things about it.
2013-10-30,4,I would give more of a 3.5 star review, wait wtf, why does something like yelp rate it out of five?Does that even make sense, let me see, from 1 to 2, how funny am I?  I need a 1-100 or at least a 1-10!Seriously, one to ten is twice as good as this rating system, are we rating them in Michelin stars?Anyway, this hibachi place is cool, BYOB at its finest...Brought a bottle of Captain in and everyone, i mean everyone, left happy...I would recommend bringing in a bottle, you have more than you need to drink, and it is a community table.  So you could socially lubricate the entire table basically less than you would spend on four drinks individual  anywhere else in the HOBO...Ok, sometimes the servers do not understand you; but what they lack in communication they make up in kindness and misunderstood laughter...The food is actually pretty good, hibachi wise, and the chef was Mr congeniality (he did look a little like Sandra Bullock)...I would have loved to try the sushi or sashimi but I dont like raw fish served around a grill (something to do with ideal bacterial replication conditions), maybe that is just me?   I met some really cool people(strangers) who we actually hung out with later at Finnegans on Willow; tangental i know, this is becoming another story.Key Points:Sometimes they dont understand you, but they try!Sometimes you need to ask a few different people the same questionThe food is good (at least the hibachi) and is pretty decently priced...I would recommend to give it a chance, and more importantly I will come back for more!
2013-09-12,1,Won't be back. Usually loved the sushi and byo. I always take people here when they come to visit. Went tonight with my family of 8, and they had to sit us at a Hibachi table there was no other room. At no point did they mention while sitting us there that 4 people needed to order to get the show. 3 ordered hibachi the rest sushi and they wouldn't do the show and would be cooking it in the kitchen.It is a Thursday the chefs are there they couldn't seat anyone else at the table nor could they move us anywhere else for better flow of conversation. Very disappointed in the customer service as a Hoboken local I expect more. I won't be back
2013-09-07,4,Had a great time at this restaurant. The cook like to squirt saki into our mouth. And the food was great!  All eight of us had a fun time!
2013-09-01,2,I'm sad to give this review :(I'm a fan of hibachi. I like the fire show and the food especially. The people who work the grill are nice, but a little raunchy. The grill-men all have the same saying that they holler before they either squirt sake into your mouth or blare Gangnam Style and then squirt sake into your mouth. "More sake, more happy! More happy, more babies!" I haven't been here in a while, so I don't know if anything's changed, but definitely do this without kids under the age of 10 or 11.
2013-07-18,5,This is a review for the sushi, i have not come here for the hibachi. Huge selection, really well executed. I've had sushi in almost every spot in Hoboken and this is the best I have had. I've seen a lot of complaints on here about service but the wait staff I had was always helpful and attentive.
2013-06-20,3,This review is for hibachi (not sushi.)I really love hibachi. I want to eat it once a month (sometimes weekly.) I came here on a double date with some good friends. Something I like about Ayame is that it is BYOB. That was wonderful. The price is reasonable and you get a lot of food. They give you noodles with your hibachi dinner (which seems standard for hibachi restaurants these days.)The front of the restaurant is a traditional layout and seems more for sushi diners. The back has a couple of hibachi tables. Honestly, the place seemed too small for the big grills - but it worked. (It was a little cramped.)The food was OK (I think it takes a lot to ruin hibachi) and the service was good.
2013-05-06,4,If I called them to order food, they would be on my speed dial.  That is, if it was 1993 and speed dials were still a thing.  I might even play it Seinfeld style and hide them in poison control. Thankfully, its 20 years later, and I can tap tap tap on my iPad / Seamless app / I'll have the usual / done.  Or...walk there.  Or drive there.There are a bunch of sushi places in Hoboken, all sporting their own decor and spin on the traditional roll, and as far as I know...this is the only Hibachi / sushi place in town.Nothing fancy here - don't expect the bright lights and rhythmic bass of Teak - but do expect to find ridiculously low priced food that is absolutely delicious.  The fish is always fresh, and the rolls are always huge.Stuff yourself silly on sushi, bring a 6 pack, and be in and out for less than $70 for two.  Hell, bring a bottle of Jack and make your own party.  Tequila?  That works too.  Marie Brizard?  Yeah, now we're making it a good kind of weird.The Hibachi is consistently delicious (I recommend the fillet with fillet, the lady loves it) and any roll i've ever had has been fresh, delicious, and created with a fish to rice ratio of no less than 3:1.Feeling lazy?  Sure.  I Seamless Ayame all the time, and the food comes in 20 minutes, rain, sleet, shine, or sheep.Treat yourself to (what I think is) the best sushi in Hoboken.  I find it hard to (and usually don't) go anywhere else to satisfy my raw fish cravings.
2013-04-13,1,I would give this place zero stars if I could. First you wait an hour to be seated even though you have a reservation. The manger, Bill showed me a list of names and asked me why my name was not there. It was. They will happily double book you for hibachi.  Once you sit and order it is the most disappointing hibachi food ever. Should have went to 7/11 and got beef jerky.
2013-04-10,5,A great spot for a big group or birthday party. Plus it's BYOB so you save money on booze and they aren't shy about giving you free saki on the grill. Hibachi is delicious. I always get the filet mignon. Also some of my favorite sushi in Hoboken. Highly recommended.
2013-04-07,4,Ayame has been hit or miss for me in the past...or maybe I was just judging because at first glance, it isn't as upscale as some of the other sushi places in Hoboken.  Hoboken really has some great sushi, so it's hard to stand out with ten other restaurants serving a similar menu.That being said, I feel like I have to give them a thumbs up tonight because I just ordered in and I'm eating the best speciality sushi roll (think it's the spicy bad girl), kani salad, and hibatchi clear soup I've ever had.Delivery was quick-arrived within 30 minutes during dinner time on a weekend.Three of the specialty rolls I've had have been excellent, also had the fried rice from the Hibatchi menu last time and that rocked as well.Overall, excellent food but only go for the dine-in if you're looking for something casual.
2013-03-27,5,Just went there last night for dinner with my sorority family and it was FABULOUS! The hibachi and sushi there are delicious and you definitely get your money's worth. The only downside last night was that we had a reservation for a group of 12 people for 9pm and weren't seated till 9:20pm. But they were kind enough to ask the group of 4, that were finished since we walked in but were just sitting there, to move to another table so that we could be seated. And we didn't have him last night but I LOVE the Hibachi chef, Jimmy Boyfriend as he likes to call himself.
2013-03-03,1,Never order takeout, they forget entire parts of meals and then argue about redelivering. Food (aside from sushi) is not great. Udon noodles are pastey, pork is tough, chicken katsu is just fried chicken over white rice (no sauce, veggies, egg, etc)
2013-02-17,2,Dropped by Ayame on a Tuesday night. I've heard good things about their sushi and hibachi, so I gave it a shot. What's nice is that this is a BYO, I picked up a cabernet from a shop a block away.We started with a Cajun Tuna Roll, because it was Fat Tuesday after all. The sushi was delicious, I'd order it again for sure. It was a spicy tuna roll topped with Cajun tuna and tabiko.I ordered the steak and salmon hibachi combo, with fried rice, noodles and mixed veggies. They started me off with a brothy soup that I wouldn't quite call miso soup. The Tepanyaki chef was not very talented, he was bored and was incapable of grabbing our attention. At one point my friend said that if the chef didn't do the volcano with the onion that we were walking out, I'm glad he opted to do the volcano. On the upside, the food was tasty.Right before we left, most of the patrons started coughing and we realized the place started smelling of vinegar. I guess they decided to clean their ovens during business hours and opted not to use any vents. When we asked them to turn on the vents, they stared at us and laughed... that's some customer service...Good food but that ending made me think this place is more suitable for takeout which isn't promising for a tepanyaki grill
2013-02-15,4,I've been to this place a few time and have always had a great time. The food is good, it's a pretty standard hibachi selection. Anything from the grill is always good but I wouldn't bother getting the sushi there.The best was going there for a friends birthday when we had 20+ people. They were very accommodating and did a great job to take care of us. They were all about us doing sake bombs and having a great time.
2013-02-07,4,We just got sushi delivery here and we were surprised how quickly the food arrived. The rolls were so good! We had yellow dragon rolls which as huge and so delicious and for such a reasonable price. lots of fish stuff into this roll which made it so good! We also had spicy tuna and mango dragon rolls which were also delicious. THe mango roll had many slices of fresh mango. I thought the fish was super fresh and better than competitors down the street. This will now be our go to sushi takeout spot and we hope to go to eat at the restaurant soon with friends.
2013-01-27,5,The best lunch special around. $8.95 for two sushi rolls and a soup! Super fresh fish and a friendly atmosphere! Always playing fun music as well. Nice and funky decor. Service with a smile what an underestimated thing these days...
2013-01-21,1,We just left Ayame, party of 4 and we stink! All of our clothes need to be cleaned or dry cleaned.  The exhaust vents above the hiabacci grills are there for looks only, the smoke was so thick we were choking, you could barely see from the back of the restaurant to the front due to heavy smoke.  The food was OK, but the whole experience was horrible, I was wishing we could just get up and leave
2013-01-16,2,Stopped in for dinner with three others, we picked a spot near the front. It's noisy and fun inside where the hibatchi is, but we weren't here today for that - we were trying out the sushi. Dark inside, not particularly well-lit. Noisy, but not unbearably so. A TV above the sushi bar.The miso soup, right on target, though not enough tofu for me (it rarely is). The salad was cold and crispy under plenty of ginger dressing. And the edamame was salted just about right. They gave two soy sauce holders for the four of us - it's a good thing we were couples.  The appetizer of fried calamari rings was tasty, dipped in a slightly spicy apricot sauce.The chirashi... eh, it wasn't that exciting. The fish wasn't as good as I have had at other Japanese sushi restaurants, but it was a nice selection of a few different pieces, decently cut. The rice, though a nice touch with the roe and bonito flakes to make it crunchy, was a bit dry underneath. Biggest issue - lack of wasabi and ginger for the chirashi plate... not sure how you forget it, but they did.The chicken teriyaki... forget it. There's minimal flavor in the sauce, it's little more than soy sauce in a cornstarch gel on some grilled chicken breast and steamed veggies.One serious negative note - one of the group became sick from the food that night, even before she left the restaurant! No good.
2013-01-14,1,This place is horrendous.  Been here a few times before because I was hoping it would get better, but it has not. They take forever to serve diners while they watch take out and deliveries prioritized over them. My husband and I just walked out of there after waiting over 30 mins... On a Monday night!  They didn't even start our stuff yet.  We walked out and I looked in the window and watched them laugh about it.  SHAMEFUL! We then went next door to Robongi and they got us our food in 7 mins!!! Thank goodness. Love them.
2013-01-12,1,Currently at Amaye. We had an 845 reservation for 8 people, we were sat an hour later. Immediately after being seated the owner advised he was going to seat seven additional people, that would never feasibly fit, at our table. The waiter opened half of the parties wine and took 25 minutes to bring glasses. After waiting an hour to be seated, it was almost another hour before our orders arrived. Overall the staff is rude and the management is ruder. With the endless food options available in Hoboken, choosing Ayame is foolish.  You're presence is a burden to the staff and management and nothing else. Be wary and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
2013-01-12,5,This best probably is the best sushi spot in town because he has a bigger meal than all the other places, all of variety of sushi and other as well as this place is BYOB
2013-01-07,4,This is one of my favorite sushi spots in Hoboken.  The rolls are fresh, delicious and creative and fairly priced- $56 for two people sharing four specialty rolls.They were able to accommodate a reservation for our group of 8, and everyone had a good time.  The fact that it is BYO also adds to the positive experience.  We sat at the regular tables, as most people ordered sushi in our group.  The only negative- its a small space, so even though we did not order hibachi, we left smelling like it.Can't wait to go back, and sit outside in the warmer months.
2012-11-20,4,BYOB Hibatchi... what's there to complain about? The chefs are entertaining and the hibatchi dinners are consistently good (I don't come here for the sushi).
2012-10-25,5,I know many people may disagree but I do not enjoy Hibachi places. I love the food don't get me wrong but the show is so overrated. I give those guys all the credit in the world for what they do, but you will see that show of flipping shrimp and creating onion volcanoes anywhere. I tried thinking of a way to get the great Hibachi food without the Hibachi show. I decided to sit at the normal tables and just order off the Hibachi menu. The food came out quicker and just as good as the Hibachi chef making it in front of you. The sushi was fresh and delicious. There were a few rolls that were huge and packed a ton of ingredients. I am not complaining but just stating that they have some wonderfully designed rolls. For entree, I always get the steak and shrimp hibachi. It is amazing. The shrimp is so tasty and the steak is cooked perfectly. If you are one of the few that is sick of the show and just want to eat, make sure to go to a normal table and get ready to eat some fantastic Hibachi.
2012-10-23,4,3 stars for standard tasty hibachi and show +1 for sake showers!Wouldn't go often but this was just a step above the albeit limited other hibachi experiences I've had.  The food is pretty good but nothing legendary.BYOB keeps the price down - you'll leave feeling full and smelling of a mix of hibachi and sake.Give it a go!
2012-10-22,4,Was a good night out. Good food, BYOB. Also Jimmy the Hibachi grill man was hilarious...
2012-10-10,3,Last week I trekked out to Hoboken, New Jersey to check out Hoboken's latest hibachi restaurant, Ayame.We arrived around 7 p.m. on a Friday night and the place was busy. There were some open spaces at the sushi bar and hibachi tables but aside from that, there was a wait to sit down. I recommend making a reservation.The inside of Ayame is equipped with a few hibachi tables in back - enough to comfortably fit our party of 14 - along with a sushi bar and some outdoor seating up front. There are no frills here and the inside mimics your typical Japanese or Chinese restaurant. The smell is a different story. The smell from the food cooking on the hibachi tables radiates throughout the restaurant and it sticks to you. Forewarning, be prepared to smell like Ayame for the rest of the night.Our hibachi chef for the night was Alan. He definitely doesn't look like an Alan, but who am I to argue. Alan was perfect for our large group. He was energetic, funny, interactive and had fun with us - exactly what I want in a hibachi chef and it helped make our night.There are a bunch of different options on the hibachi menu but all of them revolve around some sort of meat, chicken, seafood or combination.I ordered:    Combination of steak and scallops with fried riceAll hibachi meals come with two pieces of shrimp, soup or salad, and vegetables, all of which were delicious. As for the steak and scallops, they were tasty, but heavily doused in sauce which most likely disguised some of the natural flavor. The food was neither mind blowing or sub-par, but that's OK since I was there for the entertainment. Our hibachi chef, Alan, put on a show for us - flipping pieces of fried eggs into our mouths, squirting sake from a spray bottle into our mouths but instead dousing us in it (his aim wasn't that good), and flipping lots of food up into his awaiting hat.Word to the wise, Ayame is BYOB so make sure you stock up on wine, beer, sake or whatever you plan on drinking with your meal.
2012-09-24,5,Ayame was FANTASTIC!!!  I'm obsessed with Hibachi and I thought the food was delicious.  I had the steak and chicken but also tasted the scallops.  Everything was cooked perfectly with the right amount of soy and butter.   The show was silly and fun.  Typical hibachi antics but with a shot of sake!   It's great if you are looking for a fun entertaining dinner.   Also, BYOB ROCKS!
2012-09-19,1,Terrible... Absolutely terrible... Went there on a Thursday night at around 9:30pm with one other person.  It was a nice night out so we wanted to sit outside (other customers were sitting out there as well).  I asked the guy who sat us (assuming he was a waiter, who spoke terrible English) if it was ok if we sat outside.  He nodded that it was ok and then I made it clear that we didn't want to rush and if we were going to be rushed then to just put us inside to start.  He acted like it was no problem so we sat outside.  Ordered our food and literally while we are in the middle of eating the wait staff starts packing up the tables and chairs from outside, making a huge disturbance.  Then the owner/manager comes over and explains to us that they are closing and we have to move inside to finish.   So if it wasn't bad enough that in the middle of eating we get shuffled inside, then once we get inside another waitress immediately hands me a check (without me asking).  Mind you, I'm still no where close to finishing my food.  Then she proceeds to stand right next to the table until I pay the bill.  I call the manager over and asked him "do you want us to leave?"  He then replies, "Well, yes... We have to close soon."  REALLY??   It was 10:00 on a Thursday in Hoboken, not midnight!  The food wasn't good and the service was horrible... Plain and simple.  I've had bad service before, but this takes the cake.  Staff was unhelpful and outright RUDE.   I'll never go back.
2012-09-12,3,a random saturday adventure led us to a hibachi craving - so we stepped into the empty restaurant and sat down. we waited for awhile for someone to take our order and right before they were about to serve us another group walked in so we had to wait a little longer for our hibachi show to begin than we would have liked. totally understandable and no big deal. i don't like that you have to pay extra for fried rice (for both lunch and dinner hibachi) - which usually comes standard at any other hibachi restaurant. the portion on your plate is tremendous and you will most definitely leave with leftovers - the total upside to any hibachi outing :)  our hibachi man was friendly but we were truly surprised that he didn't know what "garlic sauce" was when we asked him to supply that instead of the traditional two sauces that are normally served. it took about 5 minutes to iron out, which to me is 4:58 too long. overall the experience was pleasant and the food delicious. though it wasn't at all crowded on a bright and sunny saturday, every time i pass this place during weekday dinner hours it's usually full, inside and out. bonus: 15% off everyday (except sunday) 4-6PM for their early bird special. would i go back? sure, because it's convenient ... but i've had better.
2012-09-06,4,I was really surprised at how good the food was here.  I sat at the hibachi tables in the back.  The service was good and the hibachi chef was funny.  The chefs do the same demos every time, but for some reason, its still fun.  He did the onion volcano, the beating fried rice heart, egg spinning and more.Besides the show, the food tasted really good.  I had the Filet Mignon and Shrimp.  The steak was cooked perfectly as I like it (rare) and the shrimp had a delicious sauce.  I tasted the Hibachi chicken also, it tasted quite good.They gave plenty of food for the price.  The prices are normal for hibachi.  Not cheap, but not breaking the bank either. If you like Hibachi and are in the Hoboken area, this is definitely a place to go.  Its good for groups too.Beware that the hibachi chef may try to throw Zucchini at you to catch in your mouth.  He also will deliver a few shots of sake into your mouth as well.  Im not really a fan of this, but other people might be.Give it a try.
2012-08-20,1,I'm sad to write this review because Ayame used to be one of my favorite places in Hoboken. The one star is not for the food quality but for the management. I made a reservation for my birthday dinner there last night. I arrived early but sadly my friends were 9 mins late. While I was sitting there in front of the owner/manager (place is pretty small), waiting for my friends, the owner/manager gave away my reservation without telling me. When my friends arrived the owner/manager said we'd have to wait since they were late. I understood at this point because my friends were late. We were still waiting for a hibachi table 45 minutes later!!! We should have left then. Our fault. Then the owner/manager told us that another table was being saved for a reservation (post reservation time). I guess not all reservations are equal since it was past their reserved  time. To make a long story short, birthday reservation at 8 pm. Friends arrived at 8:09 pm. Seated at 8:50 pm. Hibachi chef came to table at 9:40 pm. Owner/Manager did not apologize but made tons of excuses. Not a way to spend a birthday. We will not be going back.
2012-08-14,4,Great for group nights out.  Hibachi is a ton of fun, always delicious, anddddd it's BYOB.  Staff is friendly, menu is pretty extensive.  Sushi is decent as well.
2012-07-20,5,A friend and I satisfied our sushi craving at Ayame after a workout last night...and let's just say I'm glad I was wearing stretchy pants. We ordered their Mango Dragon Roll, regular Dragon Roll, spicy salmon roll and Play Boy Roll, all of which were generously sized and absolutely delicious - the Mango Dragon Roll came with slice after slice of tasty mango on top. The two of us stuffed our faces and couldn't even finish all 4 rolls - I had enough left over for lunch the next day. They don't charge extra to substitute brown rice on anything, which is great - not to mention they have adorable outdoor seating. Their special rolls range from $10 - $15 each and the regular rolls are around $6 - $8. Considering that $50 covered an app, four rolls and my lunch the next day, I think it's a great value for the price. I'll say this - it's better than anything I've had in Manhattan.
2012-07-17,4,I visited for the first time and it was a wonderful Japanese restaurant.  The sushi was delicious, and they give you HUGE portions.  I ordered 2 of the specialty rolls and had a very hard time finishing it.  My friends and I brought a few bottles of wine with us and the waiter was very handy in setting up our glasses, giving us an ice bucket for the white wine and pouring our first glasses.  The service is a bit slow, but it was very much worth the wait.
2012-07-16,5,Great service and delicious food!Had the Hibachi Chicken and Steak with Hibachi fried Rice! Everything was yummy and the portion was huge!The best Japanese food I've had in a long time..!!
2012-06-07,4,I really like this place!!! It is my favorite place in Hoboken at the moment. I have brought a few friends here and they have all been very happy. The sushi is amazing. They have a TON of rolls to choose from and the prices are great considering their size. The rolls are fresh, inventive and taste great. The only thing I will say is some of the rolls are big and they can go heavy on the sauces. They sauces are great but if you want just a bit of sauce, I would order it on the side. I have also had the chicken yaki soba which is really great. A little heavy on the onions but I just order it without onion now. Its has an almost BBQ flavor that I love. The hibachi is really great too. I haven't sat at the hibachi and orderd it but I ordered it for lunch at a table outside and its really good. The salmon and the filet are both fantastic. The tuna mango salad is also one of my favorites. The menu prices are all very fair. They are even a little low if you ask me my honest opinon and who would complain about that. It's BYOB which is always wonderful! Service is good. Sometimes there is a language barrier but they all seem very nice and eager to please. They aren't perfect but it's not a 5 star place either. They forgot part of my order once and they have other little issues with service but again, this isn't Per Se or Nobu NYC. It's a little asain restaurant in Hoboken. I am always very happy when I eat at Ayame. Big Fan!
2012-06-01,1,My husband and I went there for the first time for dinner last night. We ordered the tuna mango salad, aged tufo and grilled squid and thought it was really good but the waitress took forever to bring us a few things that we asked 4 times.I am happy with the food so far, so I decided to order the sushi deluxe...THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE!!!  Ate one bad piece of sushi and had to ran to the bathroom and vomitted everything out. Meanwhile my husband paid the bill and then told the manager that I ate a really bad piece of sushi so he might want to check on that. Thought we were being nice by warning him that but instead the took it the wrong way. He was really really rude!!! I should've vomitt at the table, instead of trying to hold it until I get to the bathroom.PLEASE BECAREFUL WHEN YOU EAT AT THIS PLACE!!!!
2012-04-19,5,I gave 5 stars because we had a party of over 8 people and they accommodated our party. Their tables only seat 8 people so this was great of them!Food was really good. There were a lot of orders and a lot of specifics but the cook was very good at remembering everything and everything was great. The cook was also very funny in terms of Saki shots for the birthday boy and throwing food in our mouths. We laughed a lot and enjoyed the food. Also, there was a lot of food!
2012-04-08,1,We visited Ayame on a Saturday afternoon, happy to have found a hibachi place nearby that was open for Saturday lunch.First off, the atmosphere isn't the best. The uncomfortable chairs are placed way too low to the high table. In addition, the blasting techno music (as another reviewer mentioned) is not conducive to a relaxing atmosphere.We have eaten at many hibachi places and are also very accustomed to Japanese food. The food at this place was acceptable ... if you were actually served the meal you ordered.We came here for our farewell dinner with friends visiting from the Netherlands. Three of us ordered hibachi and one ordered sushi and something else. The hibachi chef was nice enough and did a few tricks as to be expected. However, it struck me as very strange that whilst we were halfway through eating our hibachi, not a single item of my friend's had arrived on the table. She was incensed as were we, but the worst part was that none of the staff thought it strange that she was sitting there with an empty plate! It's their job to make sure we are happy and we certainly weren't.When we were finally able to summon the waiter over, even though it was a nearly empty restaurant, we asked about our friend's food and the waiter didn't really answer, so we were left wondering what was going on. I suspect that part of the issue was the language barrier because our waiter's English comprehension did not seem the best. That said, that is no excuse for crappy service and rudeness because we received no apology whatsoever.When the food was finally brought over, three of us had actually finished our meals and my friend had pretty much lost her appetite because she was understandably so pissed off!We complained to the manager when he finally deigned to come over and his piss-poor proposal was to offer us "free ice cream" and, failing that, 10% off our bill. But what really incensed me was that he was full of excuses about some customers having special requests about food being brought at different times. Well, we didn't make any such requests and we made sure to tell him this.  As a businesswoman myself, I'm well aware that you can't afford to treat paying customers in this manner. If I make a mistake, I am the first to own up to it, apologise and make a serious offer to remedy it. This gentleman however was unable to see or admit that he had made a mistake. Read the other reviews about the poor service and you will see that this is unfortunately not a one-off. To top it all, as we walked out the restaurant, we were ignored and the manager didn't even bother to look up to bid us farewell.Ultimately, if they had admitted to their mistake and given us a proper apology, we might have graced their restaurant with our presence again, but as it stands there is no bloody way that we will ever darken their doors in the future.This review represents my subjective opinion based on my personal experience.
2012-04-02,4,I had dinner here on Friday night and it was delicious. Not only was the food good, but it was creative too. The service was decent, but they made an effort to only bring out one dish at a time and didnt try to cram out table or rush us. We had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated, but it was well worth it. We just went across the street and had a drink at Farside One thing that i liked was the music, unlike the neighboring Robongi, it was not techno and made it pleasurable dining. Again the food was outstanding, best sushi I had in Hoboken in a long time, (and i lived here for 10 years)
2012-03-26,4,I came with a group that had a reservation a few days prior so I'm not sure how crowded this place can really be.  That being said, they did have two very large hibachi grills and a decent sized sushi bar.  The food was good.  They did my salmon just right and the sauces were amazing.  Complements also to our chef who put on a fantastic show and struck the right balance between being entertaining and allow us to hold our own conversations.  Although this place is very good, it's nothing spectacular.  I've been to a few hibachi places before and it just doesn't stand out.  That being said, I am a fan and do recommend this place for great Japanese food in Hoboken.Word to the wise.  This place is BYOB.
2012-03-22,1,So I'm going to start off saying that this food was okay, not the best I've had but not the worst.  I came with one of my friends and our waitress was very attentive at first, she came over a couple times before we were ready to order which was nice, but we were chatting instead of reading so it took us longer to order.  I ordered the hibachi and she ordered sushi.  My hibachi dinner was supposed to come with a soup or salad, I ordered soup, and my friend ordered edamame for an appetizer.  I didn't realize until my dinner came that I never got my soup, it didn't come out when my friend got her edamame (strike #1).  I was going to ask about my soup when the waitress came around to ask how our food was/if we needed anything, but she never came by (strike #2).  I had finished all of my water, and I was really thirsty so I wanted some more.  No one noticed my glass was empty and I was still hoping she was planning to stop by to see how everything was, she NEVER came back (strike #3).  I had to grab some other waiter walking by and ask him for some more water.  A third waiter showed up at our table bringing the check, before I got water, and my friend and I were planning on ordering dessert, so I told him we wanted to get dessert and that I was waiting for more water (strike #4).  I finally got my water after my meal was done and we got the fried ice cream which wasn't anything special.  Again I emphasize we NEVER saw our waitress again, and no one came up to us saying she had left and someone else was taking care of us or anything so that was really rude.  We got the check, and told the waiter to put X amount on my card and Y amount on my friend's.  He switched the amounts and put Y amount on mine and X amount on her's (strike #5).  My friend was done after that and didn't leave any tip.  I felt a little bad so I left a couple dollars, but that was the worst service experience of my life.  It's a nice place and the food isn't bad, but expect to have poor service.
2012-03-20,3,Atmosphere: 5 Stars! Food and Service: 3 stars! Call me tacky but I've never not liked the corny jokes and awesome looking tricks that the Hibachi guys do. I think its fun, and plus add in BYOB into the mix and really anything becomes fun! Sushi rolls had way too much cream in them and the service was hit or miss. Was a super busy night but were seated quite quickly. I would go back and try the Sashimi and Nagiri rolls just to see how the true sushi is. But overall I would go back, and was an enjoyable experience.
2012-03-11,4,We came here tonight for dinner, and I was a little nervous after reading the reviews, but we had a great time!It was busy, but not packed early on a Sunday night. We were seated right away and took the 2 corner seats so our party of 4 could converse more easily. They did seat other people at our table. The two people who were seated on our side must not have liked how cramped the seats were (which I totally agree with) and they moved to the other side, which was empty. I saw a lot of complaints about the service, but we found the service during our visit to be fine. We didn't have any issues. The chef was entertaining and the food was delicious. They used a ton of garlic on the steak and filets, which I loved. The rice, noodles and veggies were all very flavorful.I also noticed complaints about the music, which I didn't notice because we were sitting all the way in the back. I did notice the music and flashing lights on the way out, which I did find a little odd. I guess it would only bother me if I was seated at the tables in the front.Glad to finally see a hibachi place in Hoboken! We'll be back for sure.
2012-03-01,4,i have only ordered take out from this place and it has always been really good.  I order the dynamite app and the kani salad.  both dishes rock!
2012-01-31,4,I certainly wasn't happy to see Frozen Monkey disappear from the Hoboken scene and was not thrilled to have ANOTHER  Asian spot opening up but at least they got it right ... a good meal at the right place with a friendly staff and anything you'd like (except for the booze, it's a byo) ...So good that we actually got takeout from their not a couple days after our last time in ...
2012-01-17,1,WORST SERVICE IN RECENT MEMORY.  I so wanted to give the waiter a 10% tip but felt bad at the last minute.  He was absolutely horrible and rude.  First of all he made us feel uncomfortable.  Being one of the few people in the place, he stared at us as we talked and looked over the menu.  When we were finally ready to order he gave me major attitude! He questioned my order and when I repeated myself he said I GOT IT!!! I specifically requested the salad be brought out with the sushi NOT as an appetizer because I had ordered soup.  Of course minutes after order out came this "salad", now I know that most japaense places have shit iceburg lettuce but at least the dressing usually makes up for this.  This salad was so disgusting looking, I actually tried to turn it away, but the waiter refused.  When I said I wanted the salad to come out later, he took it away and placed it feet away from me.  LOL it was actually kinda hilarious because it was so bad.  The food was decent, sushi not the best quality and I would be interested in the hibachi but this man was so horrible I can't give this place more than one star.  If I thought it would make a difference, I would have said something to his manager but I got the vibe it didnt matter what this guy did.  WILL NOT RETURN OUT OF PRINCIPLE!
2012-01-12,2,B.Y.O. is always a plus, but this place was VERY VERY salty... overly salty. It's really a shame, I love hibachi. My girlfriend and I are going to go back at some point and see if that was just a one time experience. I'll update my review accordingly.
2012-01-09,4,Great new addition to Hoboken. Prices are pretty good for hibachi ($17-$25 per order). Plus: you get both rice and noodles and the garlic butter sauce you use is phenomonal. Minus: you get soup OR salad, not both. Not sure what their policy on reservations is because sometimes they take them, and sometimes they tell me they don't. Either way, it is a great place with good food, BYOB, and very reasonable prices for a fun night out. Just expect to wait for a table on a Friday or Saturday night.
2012-01-04,5,Ayame is definitely our go to place when we want good food and a fun night out. It's BYOB, the chefs' are charismatic and entertaining, and we've never really had to wait too long for tables! For those trying out Ayame for the first time, definitely get their crispy duck roll...absolutely delicious!I have tried their sushi and I liked it. The sashimi was fresh and the sushi was aesthetically pleasing (and yummy!)If you do hibachi, they give you tons of food which we always take to go. It makes a great post-drunken night out snack!
2011-12-27,5,This place is great. I have been to every sushi place (that I know of) in Hoboken and this one wins thus far. They have a picture menu in addition to the regular one and the dishes come out looking exactly as they are on the picture. They get an A++ for presentation and creativity.
2011-12-14,4,This Hoboken, NJ BYOB spot is great for a fun night out with friends. The food is pretty good, but like any hibachi, can get a little greasy. The sushi is fresh. Some of the chefs are truly great entertainers. The reason why I cannot rate this any higher is because on our first visit, the manager asked us to get up from the table before we were finished to accommodate other customers. While I can understand that the restaurant is small and they is almost always a wait to get a table, we had not been there an exorbitantly long amount of time and we had spent a pretty decent chunck of change. This is something to keep in mind when considering Ayame.
2011-12-12,4,I had my birthday here in July and the hibachi was pretty good although our chef did not put on much of a show which was basically the reason I chose this place. So that part was a bit disappointing. Moving on I came here on Saturday for the lunch special 2 rolls plus soup and salad for $8.95. I had the Alaska roll and the yellowtail scallion roll. They were both really good with huge pieces of yellowtail in the yellowtail scallion roll. The dressing on the salad was delicious and actually might have been best I have had in Hoboken. Unlike some of the other reviewers I loved the music.  It was great and not too loud.  Actually makes me want to have a lunch party there. Lastly the server was one of the most attentive servers I have ever had. She was about 5 feet away when I mentioned to my friend that I should  have asked for no ice in my water, heard me and brought it without the ice. Also she saw I dropped a chopstick and immediately replaced it. I too love Roboji, but this was a nice change of scene i will be back soon and often.
2011-12-05,5,First off, I have to state that I've only gotten takeout from Ayame, so I can't comment on the actual restaurant or the waitstaff.  BUT the sushi is DELICIOUS!!!!  Definitely the best sushi I've had yet in Hoboken (other than Robongi-mind you i haven't been to Sushi Lounge).I love the yellowtail dragon roll (salmon, tuna, yellow tail, avocado and spicy mayo and eel sauce - $10.95)...so yummy!  I also really like the standard shrimp tempura and spicy tuna rolls.  They are actually pretty large in size, too.  Prices are very reasonable for sushi.Delivery is fast!  Can't wait to dine at the restaurant!
2011-11-30,2,I went here for sushi recently with two friends after finding out that Robongi had a crazy long wait.  I can confidently say after my experience that Robongi is significantly better. My biggest problem with this place was their yellowtail with scallion roll.  I don't know what happened, but they must have made mine with scraps that they collected from the dregs of a piece of yellowtail.  It was essentially yellowtail paste with scallion.  The weird part about it is that my friend also ordered a yellowtail and scallion roll and hers was significantly better than mine and consisted of  ACTUAL pieces of fish.  I have an issue with food preparation inconsistencies to begin with, but its an even bigger problem when two people at the same table, eating the exact same thing are having drastically different experiences. I also tried their California roll and it had way to much cucumber. The tuna roll was a tuna roll. As far as price is concerned, I doubt you would be saving more than a few cents here and there by choosing this place over Robongi.  Personally, I would be willing to spend a few more dollars to get something that I know is consistently good. What is it with sushi places in Hoboken and their need to blast techno music?  Robongi does it and so does this place. Before going out for sushi in Hoboken, my experiences have always been calm and relaxing.  For some reason these places want me to pop a few ecstasy pills and dance on the table.Overall, Robongi is better tasting and is a better bang for your buck. In the future I will try to have the foresight to make a reservation there when I have a sushi craving so it can be sufficiently satisfied.
2011-11-19,1,We will never go back to this place.  I've read all the reviews about how the service at this place is bad and the owner is a jerk, but I never would have expected it to be as bad as the experience we had....We were excited to try Hoboken's only hibachi restaurant for the first time, and made a reservation for a small group.  A few members of our party arrived late, but that did not seem to matter because we waited around for another 15 minutes after placing our order before our chef came over to start cooking.  No big deal, we weren't in a rush.  Or so we thought.....We brought wine, saki, and beer.  The chef was nice, and somewhat entertaining, although he did not do a volcano or flip any shrimp around or do anything fancy.  He did an oil fire in the beginning and squirted sake into our mouths near the end, and that was about the extent of the entertainment.The hibachi food was pretty good...nothing spectacular but about what you would expect from a hibachi restaurant.  Members of our group had a variety of hibachi items plus sushi and there were no complaints at that point.And then things turned ugly.....We had just finished our meals, and we were having our drinks and we were ready to order dessert.  We had been there a little over an hour, which is normal at a hibachi restaurant.  All of a sudden, our bill arrived!  The owner came over TOLD US WE HAD TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED OUR TABLE!!  How rude!!!  But it got worse.  Just then, I noticed THEY TOOK THE REST OF OUR WINE AND BEER!!!!  We had about 1/3 of a bottle of wine left and I had a half of a Sapporo beer left (the big can) and they just took it from us WITHOUT EVEN ASKING, HOPING WE WOULDN'T NOTICE!!!  I asked the owner what happened to our alcohol and he said he "thought we were done" and I told him nobody asked us and to bring it back.  He brought back the wine, but not my beer.He came over AGAIN a few minutes later AND ASKED US TO LEAVE!!  We told him we paid good money to come eat here and that was no way to treat his customers, and that we would have wanted to order dessert.  His response was "this is a business", so I stood up and told him THEN WE WILL TAKE OUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE, and we took the rest of our wine and walked out of the place.  We told everyone waiting in line to go somewhere else because THIS PLACE TREATS THEIR CUSTOMERS LIKE GARBAGE.  We were happy to see a few people turn around and walk out the door.We didn't even mention how much saki they stole from us because we brought 3 bottles and they definitely kept some of it in the back room based on the amount they brought out for us.  But at that point it wasn't even worth it anymore.I have never been treated that way in a restaurant before.  I don't know what makes these people think they could treat their customers like that...it is really sad because obviously other people have had bad service there as well.  It is so unfortunate because the food was good, but there are so many other places to eat in Hoboken that have much better food AND appreciate you as a customer, so we have no reason to ever go back to Ayame.  We wouldn't even order takeout from there because there are so many places with better food and even this place was the best food in town (it isn't even close) I still wouldn't ever give them my "business" again.
2011-11-14,4,Ayame is the only place in Hoboken with hibachi tables.. Hooray for being something different! There are so many Asian places in this town, it can be hard deciding where to go.I have been here a couple of times for the hibachi and have not been disappointed. The food is very good, hot and fresh, and the chefs are very entertaining. I also love that it is BYOB. My friends and I like to come here for Birthdays since they can accommodate larger parties, have a fun atmosphere, and pretty decent pricing for the amount of food that is served.My only semi-complaint would be the music. They blast some sort of house-techno music, and I don't think that really goes with the rest of the theme (if there is any). I highly recommend it for the hibachi and larger parries, but cannot comment on the sushi aspect (I'm pretty biased towards another place in Hoboken for sushi).
2011-09-13,3,** Based on delivery**Pretty good sushi place.  For my money, though, I'll stick with Robongi if I'm going high-end.  I was a little disappointed with my chirashi. Rather than a couple of pieces of many different fish, I got about 5 tuna, 5 salmon and 5 mackerel.  I prefer a mix, and a few of the more odd ones thrown in, like octopus.Overall, though, it was a fair amount of food for the price and the fish was fresh and of good quality.
2011-09-13,2,One day, my friend and I were bored and decided to compare Ayame's sushi with Robongi's sushi FOR FUN. My friend and I have spent more than a year in Japan together for college and have a good knowledge of sushi. We knew that the quality would disappoint us but we just cannot understand how these places are have so much hype with such crappy sushi and high prices!! Ayame is a little (like maybe a dollar) cheaper than Robongi. First, they are not using sushi rice and the prices are too high for the low quality fish. I could just taste that the fish had been frozen. They could of made up for the quality by increasing portions they way non-Japanese sushi places usually do, but NO. We tried 4 different rolls but they were so unspectacular that I can only remember one of them -the spicy scallop roll. When you put the spicy sauce on sushi, it masks the flavor so that it is harder to tell if the sushi is not fresh which is why this roll stood out. Also, my friend and I agreed that Ayame's spicy scallop roll tasted better than Robongi's spicy scallop roll... but Ayame's other 3 rolls were worse than their competitor two doors away. Also, everyone who works here is Chinese and confused. This place is far from authentic. The kanji (Chinese characters) on the front of the store does not read AYAME!  should read Yamamizu or Sansui. While I was paying, I asked the lady at the counter in a nice cheerful way if they were hiring because my friend speaks fluent Japanese- the lady gave me a dirty look and said scolded no at me like I had just begged her to give me some money! I later found out from neighboring businesses that she is the owner's wife.  So that's 1 star service but since I did not have to throw up my sushi, I am going to be generous and give them 2 stars. While I have not tried their hibachi, I doubt that the quality would be THAT much better than the sushi for me to give it a try for around $20 a serving.
2011-09-12,3,We ordered delivery. The dragon roll was very flavorful. It got here pretty fast as well. Not bad. Over the phone the place was very loud.
2011-08-22,4,what can i say about this place? i didnt see the habachi show but i did have their food twice. their sushi selection is great. haven't order out from them yet i think its best to sit in this place it is very nice. i dont really have much to say since i have been to other hibachi places and they are all the same to me. i think the price is great, i honestly thought the price would be a bit higher because it is in hoboken but it is a great price and their food is delicious...
2011-08-16,4,This place is 5-star for delivery.  the food arrives fresh and hot in a container that neatly separates your authentic hibachi (not like some other places in town that say hibachi when they just give you some chicken teryaki and rice).  Only thing that is missing from the delivery is a guy to pop some shrimp into his hat and make onion volcanos..Dining in..Food is just as good, but I kind of prefer traditional decor and ambiance.  They are blasting club music.  I guess the owners had jersey shore marathons playing on the little seat tvs on the plane over from Japan...So it's not their fault, they didn't know any better..the people are very nice, however.  It's just the music is irritating.
2011-08-01,4,Have been to Ayame twice now and will definitely be back. It's great to have a hibachi place we can walk to and the food has been delicious. We've had gyoza, spincy crunchy tuna rolls, alligator rolls, hibachi filet mignon, scallops, and shrimp. All of which I'd recommend. I think it's really nice that they give you a ton of options when it comes to Hibachi service which I haven't seen at other places like Red Snapper or Chilean Sea Bass.. You can also combine most items (chicken, filet, shrimp, scallops, etc. into a combo. The service has also been super attentive and friendly which is always appreciated. I do have to agree that their music was a strange choice. It made me feel like I should be fist-pumping at some club at the Jersey Shore. Definitely messes with the ambiance. Also they had a NASCAR race on the tv- Definitely strange. But other than that I really do like this place
2011-07-14,4,Good $12 three roll sushi lunch special here.  I had the yellowtail jalapeno roll, salmon roll, and eel avocado roll.  Nice and fresh, and it includes miso soup and a small salad.  I hope to head back to try something more adventurous.
2011-07-07,4,we love this place!!!! i went there w my family last sunday night,we sat by the big hibachi table, the chef was fun and entertaining,the food was great and sushi was awsome  .the server ,wait ,i forgot to ask his n ame,he was friendly patient and very nice.we would definitly come back. good luck!!!
2011-06-29,5,This is a follow-up to my first review I did earlier this month. I have eaten at Ayame several times since my first review. The food just gets better and better. I am amazed at how consistently fresh the sushi is.No sushi place in Hoboken I have been to has ever maintained the same fresh consistency that Ayame does. Trust me I have done the research! I eat sushi at least 3 times per week. I have not eaten sushi anywhere else but Ayame since my first time. I have gotten my staff hooked on it as well, and these are people tht think California rolls are real sushi.  I love that they have a computer system that lets them know who I am by my phone number. I think it is ever nicer tht I am greeted by myt first name. I have to say I was not crazy about the volcano roll, but that's because I don't beieve cream cheese is an acceptable ingredient in sushi. Other than that nothing has disappointed me! I can't wait to actually go to have sushi at the restaurant and try the hibachi too. I will keep you posted. Watch out other sushi "places, houses, and lounges in Hoboken. There is a new sushi master in town!!!
2011-05-05,4,Ordered takeout and it was very good and fast. The only thing is that I am use to "Special Rolls" (I had the Tiffany Roll)  being bigger and more dressed up than regular rolls since they are about double the price but in this case they are the same size.
2011-04-30,4,This is what was missing in Hoboken. Great entertaining dinner and very good food.However I would suggest they stop the radio in the restaurant and maybe play something more "japanese" to create a real Hibachi ambiance. Additionally, you will feel that the place and chefs need more practice (noodle in my sauce, rice everywhere...). It may not be the best Hibachi I tried but it's good to have one in Hoboken.
2011-04-30,5,Great new place! Delicious sushi and good service!
2011-04-28,3,meal- hibachi shrimp dinner was delicious: the meal was inclusive of noodles, rice, vegetables, and either soup or salad to start. considering other hibachi restaurants, the portions here are smaller while the price is about average.decor- pretty lame, compared to other japanese restaurants in hoboken. the interior resembled that of a cheap asian buffet restaurant.staff- our hibachi chef was pretty entertaining, serving up both tricks, jokes, and a great meal to the entire table of diners.drinks- this place is BYOB and the server/bus boy is just awful. upon his initial attempt to pour the wine that my date had purchased at a nearby grocer, the server spilled an ample amount in my glass of water before actually filling my wine glass. when he returned to refill our glasses, the server failed to watch where he was pouring and saturated my date's plate of food with the wine. the server neither apologized nor did he even acknowledge his accident; he simply smirked and carried on. overall- this is the only hibachi restaurant in hoboken that i know of so it's going to fare pretty well. i suggest not only bringing your own wine/beer/liquor but also handling it yourself so as to avoid the disaster that i encountered last night. also, try not to expect much from the overall ambience...this place is not going to impress a date.
2011-04-27,4,Hibachi was actually entertaining AND delish.  This is a great new addition to Hoboken's "International Row" (Washington between 5th and 6th).This place is brand new, so give it a few weeks to work out kinks but again, our meal was really fun!*****BYOB!!!*****
2011-04-27,4,GREAT hibachi food, decent prices, and amiable-attentive staff.  I was only able to have the veggie tofu and fried cheesecake...  Both SO delicious.  Great place to go for an entertaining dinner.  The chef Eric was well skilled working the grill, and our waiter Joe was very nice.  We felt so welcomed.  FYI its BYOB.
2011-04-26,4,There are dozens of Japanese restaurants in Hoboken, but not of them have Hibachi grills... until now. Yay for finally something a little different. The prices aren't too bad, either.
