2021-11-14,2,A big NO. Food looks and tastes bad. Service is okay.  Would not recommend to anyone. And definitely won't be back
2021-09-14,4,Cute little cafe on Washington street! There's a few tables inside and more seating outdoors by the entrance. - Service was very quick, we had a 12pm reservation for brunch on Sunday. I'd recommend making a reservation, pretty much every table was full. - $3 per person for BYOB, but they don't uncork your bottle...so you're basically paying $3 per person for an ice bucket. That's on top of paying for mimosa mix. - Food was good! I ordered the cheddar and bacon omelet, which was a large portion and came with potatoes on the side. The bacon was on top of the omelet instead of inside, which was interesting. - The potatoes weren't your typical breakfast potato, tasted closer to a potato salad (I prefer mine crispier like home fries, but they were still fine). Overall I think I'd come back in the future (maybe not for BYOB though). The croissant breakfast sandwich looked very tempting and I was told their lattes are amazing!
2021-09-03,4,Cute little bistro. It's been awhile since I've walked down Washington and was going to sit at a Starbucks and do work, instead saw this on my way and decided to get breakfast and sit outside.  A small little place but had a good amount of people on a Friday at 11AM. Had an avocado toast and orange juice. Quite tasty and staff was really sweet.
2021-09-01,5,I came in on a Wednesday afternoon looking for breakfast.  I was currently the only person there and it was awesome. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet with potatoes which came out quickly. The service was great as well. This was the best omelet I've ever had. Whatever they seasoned it with just topped it off. I'm not from the area but this a great breakfast spot even for lunch time. I'll be coming here tomorrow and next time I visit.
2021-08-15,5,Very yummy food and good portion sizes here! Makes for a great brunch on a weekend, especially if you have a lot of time. The service was a bit slow, but there were only a few people working there. The servers were very funny and when we had to get their attention they were polite. The brioche French toast was amazing! I also got an iced coffee. My friend got the avocado toast and usually I think that's a waste of money but this one looked so great and definitely not something most people would make at home, so if you're interested I'd try it!
2021-08-08,1,The manager is SO rude. I used to like coming here but the food has been going way downhill. Everything is so heavy but also flavorless? It's kind of nauseating.The worst part is the manager. He's a tall older man who has no idea how to treat his guests. You could tell he was frustrated because his tiny restaurant was busy but that's the industry, buddy. If you can't handle stress you need to get another job. Will not return. Edit: It's so sad when a business owner blames the guest for their poor performance and attitude. It really shows where their priorities lie. I managed restaurants across the United States for years and I've never treated anyone the way I've been treated at this restaurant. There's never an excuse to be short and dismissive of the people who frequent your establishment. For the sake of keeping this constructive, I've removed my comment about hoping that you close. You just need to DO BETTER.
2021-08-08,1,If you are willing to have a good experience, this is not the best place. I went there for a breakfast on my own. And was clear that the manager (the guy who managers table) don't see the customers as customers and just like money, was clearly the difference how he treated me different just because I was alone and automatically I was going to spent less then the other people. He asked nice to take one of the chairs from the table I was and but then he told me he needed more chairs and more tables (that was a indirect way to tell to leave). The food super was cold, nobody brought me water. And at the end I asked for a box for my leftover sandwich and a to go cup for my coffee that he didn't listen to, so when he came back just with the box for the sandwich I was for the cup again and he impolitely rolled his eyes to me like I was annoying him. So obviously I am not going back.
2021-08-04,5,The owner/manager here is really attentive to his patrons to make sure we had a pleasant brunch. the food was delicious! I literally bought the ingredients to try to remake this myself the next morning and couldn't do it quite the same. I'll have to come back for more soon! As for the Turmeric latte, maybe I should have asked what was in it before ordering. I think it may have just been milk and turmeric. I still liked it, the turmeric wasn't overwhelming, in fact I think most of the flavor was at the very bottom with the spices sinking. I'd try a coffee latte next time. Loved having crepe options, but they all seemed a little too "dessert-y" for me at the time I was there and hungry. Will save one of hose options for a sweet brunch day.
2021-07-26,2,I guess I didn't read open table restaurant note carefully and did not know La Bouche charged $2 cover fee per person!! I wished they could just tell me on the phone when I called for reservation for 3 people that all reservation subjects to $2 cover fee per person; instead, they told me they don't take reservation over the phone, and asked me to reserve online, which I did, went to their website and was directed to open table for reservation.... Turned out the reservation costs $2 per person.I wished I saw/carefully read the note before I click reserve- big mistake, lesson learned.For people who likes to make reservation (to respect guests and merchant's time), you will be paying extra for respecting time. And you wouldn't know this when you called. Also, no check/bill presented to us before asking us to pay, waitress gave us a total and asked for credit card... I ended up paying first (on behalf of group) and asked for receipt emailing to me. It would be nice if merchant printed out bill/check with itemized cost clearly listed. This should be the basic requirement. Anyway... disappointed to how La Bouche became, and regretted I suggested to go to this restaurant (so I picked up the cover fee for my party).
2021-07-25,1,Charges a $2.00 per person "cover fee" if you want to make a reservation. (And you can only make a reservation through OpenTable, not over the phone, so it can't be avoided.) Am I eating a meal or attending a New York dance club?But even better, when you're heading out, you are expected to pay for your meal WITHOUT SEEING THE CHECK. All you'll see is the total; you can't review an itemized receipt. You will only get a receipt *after* you pay - so, surprise, if there's an error, you've already paid. If you didn't know about the cover fee, you've already paid.If you want to avoid the cover fee, you'll have to take your chances and go without a reservation. Even then, you're going to pay first, and view your receipt second. Flat out, this is unacceptable. If you go to a restaurant and they are unwilling to provide an itemized receipt prior to payment, simply refuse to pay until they do. Or better yet, don't go there in the first place.P.S. To address the owner's reply, in as much as I understood it. I'll keep it simple: 1) There is, currently, no way to make a reservation without incurring a $2.00 cover charge per person, which will also affect your sales tax and tip. 2) There is, currently, no way to actually review your check prior to payment at the end of your meal. You will only have the opportunity after the fact. Hopefully these policies will change. In the meanwhile, if neither of these are issues for you, then you're good to go!
2021-06-29,5,Go. Eat. Here. My friends and I made reservations on Open Table but honestly didn't need them. We went for a late Sunday Brunch. The staff was just delightful and the food was incredible! I have traveled to France a lot and never expect American "French" cuisine to compare to the real thing but this came really close. The tiny little restaurant was very reminiscent of French cafes as well. I'd definitely go back!
2021-06-26,5,The owner is great.  Very caring and worked very hard to make things work.  This place is just the type if mom and pop location that needs to be supported. And I'm not a French food kinda guy...Btw the French toast was great...saw a lot of good plates as well.
2021-06-12,3,Ambience and food were good, but we were charged a $2 cover charge per person which I've never experienced in any other restaurant...being charged to sit inside of a restaurant seems a little bizarre to me.
2021-05-09,3,Food was above average and service was a bit below average. They were initially very responsive but then kind of lost track of us since we were sitting outside.
2021-04-26,5,We came here on a whim and it was really great! The ambiance was really cute and the staff were all very nice. The location is clean and even though it's pretty small, they do a good job of social distancing and making sure everyone is comfortable. We ordered the eggs Norwegian and the ham and pepper omelet. Both dishes were very tasty and the portions were big. The potatoes were flavorful and cooked perfectly, nothing burnt and everything well seasoned. The omelet was cooked well and everything was tasty. Our only complaint was the toppings were bunched up in sections (one bite would be full of ham, another would predominantly be goat cheese). Not a negative in the slightest but we needed to proportion each bite ourselves. Regardless, it was very good and easily something I would recommend. The Eggs Norwegian were also very flavorful and fresh. The sauce was good and the overall dish was definitely a favorite!
2021-04-10,5,Great service, delicious food, awesome ambiance. Came here for lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with my family. We asked for outdoor seating because we brought the dog along. Two small tables were pushed together and while it was a tight squeeze for the five of us, we made it work. Our server was an older gentleman who was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. He advised us on what "wellness" we should order the burgers based on his chefs. He said that medium rare would be pretty "red" in the center for example. The waitstaff were all very friendly to my dog and even brought her a bowl of water which I greatly appreciated!!!As for the food, I ordered the eggs Benedict which was delicious. I was given a choice of ham or bacon and I chose bacon (of course). The hollandaise sauce was delicious and the poached eggs were cooked perfectly. The dish was also served with mushrooms which I loved. Other things to note: the iced coffee was pretty light and the Coca Cola came in tiny little old-fashioned bottles. I wanted a mimosa but only the mimosa mix was on the menu so you need to bring your on champagne!Overall, we had an absolutely awesome time here and the food was delicious. We will be back!!
2021-03-28,5,Went for outdoor dining this weekend during the really nice weather and loved it! It was easy to reserve a table ahead of time, and a we were seated on the sidewalk in the sunshine. The food was delicious and I will definitely go back to try their other menu items. I had the salted caramel waffle and my friend had the spicy mushroom omelet and we each ate the whole thing.
2021-03-28,5,La Bouche is a darling and quaint little french cafe/restaurant in Hoboken. Let's get the basics out of the way: it's right on Washington St. so it's super easy to find, you might be able to find some street parking if you have residential tags or find a parking garage, but it's really easy to walk here from the PATH, or if you wanna take a car service here, that's even easier. You can make reservations online or try to walk up and get a table. I was able to walk up on a weekend morning with my friend and was immediately sat. They have both indoor and outdoor seating available which is really nice, especially if you're like me and prefer to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air and really distance yourself from others. Their menu is solid. They have a long list of beverages, coffees and mimosa mix (yes, you have to bring your own bubbles if you want "adult drinks" here). They have a dope lemonade that is basically sugar water that is really refreshing and doesn't leave a sugary coat on your teeth that I love. Super light and delicious, would highly recommend that. They have plenty of egg dishes, croissant dishes, omelettes, and then some. I was able to get their standard eggs benedict and the other person in my group got the mushroom crepe. Their potatoes are so good, the eggs were poached to perfection and their hollandaise sauce was *chefs kiss* awesome. The food was great, the customer service was solid, and the price was reasonable. I had issues or complaints to write home about and would highly recommend anyone come here either by themselves or with a group to enjoy a lovely brunch.
2021-02-28,5,Finally a restaurant in Hoboken for brunch that isn't American fair. This French booutique restaurant would be a number one spot in the west village of New York, Boston, or San Fran. We are fortunate the friendly couple that owns it found there way to Hoboken. Lovely food, specialty drinks and charm. Amazing date place and out of this world brunch spot for the sophisticated.
2021-02-21,1,This place is super cute and cozy inside. The food was excellent and has nothing to do with my rating. Unfortunately we did not have a good experience with the waiter. We made a reservation for 3 and called to ask if we could update it to 4. They stated yes and were super rude when we arrived. The waiter gave us a huge problem and was nasty about it.
2021-02-14,5,Great little brunch spot! Ordered the Croque Forstier and a cappuccino, both delicious. Staff was friendly.
2021-01-17,5,This place is a must visit! Cute little spot right on Washington. Service was good and food came out quickly. Burger was phenomenal, so much flavor. Croissant French toast was really tasty and so was the croque madam! Definitely will be back soon!
2021-01-13,1,Last working there is annoying and mean. Espresso is just black coffee. Atmosphere is pretty cool but bad juju with the lady working there. Did not feel welcome
2021-01-13,5,I finally got a chance to stop and try the new location and had such a great experience! La Bouche used to be tucked away off of the main ave and I very vaguely remember stopping in for brunch years back. This new location on Washington had wonderful service, a very cute interior and a menu of my dreams. I met my friend for lunch and was so happy when she suggested La Bouche. I started with a London Fog (my newest tea craze) and loved that it wasn't made too sweet. We spent a while catching up so it took us a bit long to decide on an order but our waitress never rushed us. I ended up getting the warm goat cheese salad topped with grilled chicken and it was delicious! The big heap of warm fried goat cheese was incredible and the chicken helped the salad become a perfectly filling and hearty lunch. I also loved the balsamic vinaigrette that it was mixed with. A perfect spot if you are looking for a nice lunch and great coffee/tea.
2021-01-09,2,Super cute place but that's where it ends sadly. Ordered a cappuccino and croque madam. The cappuccino tasted like the beans had been burned, way too harsh. And the croque madam was really pretty amateurish, something I could have made at home with not much flavor. The greens on the side had no dressing and were kinda sad. Definitely not worth the $18 or so dollars, or really any amount of money. I was disappointed.
2021-01-08,5,I had a lovely experience at this adorable and quaint cafe!I remember seeing La Bouche on a more quiet street in Hoboken, so I was surprised to pass by their store front while walking down Washington Ave. I was meeting a friend for lunch and coffee and La Bouche seemed like a perfect pick.The inside is super tiny and cozy. Think exposed brick and hanging string lights and greenery. I could easily see myself posting up for hours and getting work done here. There are a few tables set up and it was easy to socially distance from other customers.The menu is pretty large and has a variety of brunch and lunch options with a french influence. Sweet and savory crepes, omelettes, croques, breakfast and lunch sammies and more! So much sounded good that it was tough to choose -- especially between sweet and savory!I went with a savory crepe and it was literally as large as an entire dinner plate. The crepe was stuffed with swiss, ham, mushrooms and roasted peppers and it was incredibly satisfying. My friend ordered a salad that looked fresh and delicious and came topped with lots of grilled chicken and goat cheese.Service was friendly and speedy, coffee was strong and overall this was a relaxing and delicious dining experience. I find myself in Hoboken for work every now and again, and if I'm looking for a coffee or lunch spot I will certainly add La Bouche to the list.
2021-01-05,5,Very charming place, with great brunch food. Wholesome, light and flavourful; definitely one of my new favourites in Hoboken.
2021-01-05,5,Love it! Food and atmosphere were great. Would go back for another brunch! The waitress was helpful and nice.
2020-11-30,4,Good service and ok food. Didn't find it particularly spacing. I had eggs Benedict w salmon. Souse seemed plain.
2020-10-31,5,Excellent location and food. Cappacinos are reminiscent of Europe. The service was amazing and owner super gracious. We had the omelets and Belgium waffles, both delicious and came out quickly! Outdoor seating was a nice plus.
2020-10-24,5,Had the French Burger.  Cooked perfectly - probably top three burger in HBK and NYC. Definitely best in HBK. Service was terrific.  Really just a nice group of people who work there.  I won't say "hidden" but this place is a gem.  Also, for whatever reason they served up the absolute best Arnold Palmer.  You think it's simple, but best Arnold Palmer I've ever had.  Summary : go here.  Just to.
2020-10-10,2,Never going here again, the waitress was rude and was rushing us front the moment we sat down. We looked at the menu for not even a minute before she asked us what we wanted. When I said I needed more time she rolled her eyes. During our brunch they kept on looking at us to see if we were done. Our time from start to finish was about 40 minutes. Most places give you 90 minutes during Covid. It was very uncomfortable eating that way. I tried to eat fast so we could get out of there. I didn't notice anyone else being rushed as we were. I had to tell the waitress that she was very rude and her response was, why, what did I do to you and proceeded to roll her eyes again. And she even said that with an attitude. Her partner on the other hand was pleasant. We got the wrong waitress. Bad experience.
2020-10-04,4,Uber Eats order: in a user error, I didn't realize that the meat was an optional add-on in a dropdown error. Restaurant error: the advertised "Balthazar Focaccia" wasn't there, and replaced by apparent plain white bread.The eggs and mushrooms were good, though, and order was prompt. And there were unadvertised potatoes.
2020-06-29,3,BYOB. I usually order smoked salmon, egg, and potatoes, french toast, or waffle. I wouldn't really crave anything in particular but an ok casual brunch place.
2020-04-13,5,I wanted to say thank you for delivering during the pandemic and for being open on Easter!!!!  My food was on time and everything was great!!!!
2020-03-10,5,The best latte i have ever had! Their breakfast was also so fresh and great. The lunch and dinner menu also looked great. I will definitely be back for more!!
2020-02-22,2,Really lame brunch! The potatoes were disgusting and they add 2 sad leaves that they called salad Anyway not worth it
2020-02-17,4,Small, French style cafe for good breakfast or lunch at reasonable prices. Reliably tasty food. Generous portions. Try the prosciutto omelet if you're in to meat. The wild mushroom omelette is very good to as a vegetarian option. Nice people, good service. Comfortable, neighborhood ambiance. No alchoholic beverages.
2020-01-04,3,Best omelette I have ever had in my life.  The rest of the dishes were good.  Unfortunately they lost our reservation and had no trouble squeezing our party of 5 into a table for 4, which was really not acceptable.  We eventually got lucky when another table cleared and they could add one to ours to comfortably accommodate 6, however their complete lack of concern was very frustrating and totally reminiscent of the service in Paris.  Ironic, huh?.
2019-12-25,4,Cute shop! We came here midday for some late lunch and arrived in a somewhat empty cafe. Our server easily sat us anywhere we wished. She was patient and understanding as we skimmed the menu and concluded with our decision. I ordered a salmon sandwich with cream cheese, onions, and avocado. It was pretty tasty although very salty for my taste. However, it was actually very filling, especially since we hadn't eaten all morning. All food comes with a side salad as well. Overall, La Bouche seems to be a nice alternative for clean eating in a small establishment on the main road in Hoboken. Service was great, the shop was super clean and had a cute brunch style aesthetic with pillows on the bench seats. The one thing that did make the cafe experience not perfect was the temperature of the store. Maybe it was an off day but it was freezing for a cafe where you can eat, drink coffee, and just chill. I had to bundle myself with the cold draft blowing in on a December day.Accepts card and cash.Bathroom available in back. Clean!Probably a good place to work.Bon appetit!
2019-11-24,4,Came here for a Sunday breakfast with my boyfriend around 9am, and by the time we were ready to leave the restaurant was already pretty crowded! So this definitely is a popular spot on Washington street. The ambiance and decor inside reminded me of breakfast spots in Paris. We started with coffee, which tasted really good, and then got Eggs Norwegian (smoked salmon eggs Benedict) and it comes with potatoes and some greens. We also got the spicy mushroom omelette (it has jalapeños!) The omelette comes with potatoes and some greens too. The eggs Norwegian was phenomenal! Loved the smoked salmon and the hollandaise sauce! The spicy mushroom omelette was good too! The jalapeños were just towards the middle of the omelette, so you don't taste the spice until a few bites later. Service was relatively quick! Definitely would come back to try their zucchini pancakes! Overall a great experience here.
2019-11-24,5,Clean and cute French cafe. Service was excellent and everything we ordered was delicious. We had masala chais, avocado toast, and the Nutella waffle.
2019-11-13,5,My wife and I ate brunch here (mid-week). I had a Greek omelet and my wife had calamari over arugula with cheese. Both plates were very well done. Friendly and attentive service. Nice atmosphere.
2019-11-09,5,Cute spot with elegant decor.Zucchini pancakes are a must try. It's comes with Greek yogurt topped with olive oil.This spot has good beverages too. I tried coffee and orange juice which was fresh and not bitter.
2019-10-17,4,I had lunch here with a friend and her son recently while I was in town visiting.  This was a cute little French cafe right on the main street in Hoboken. It was not that warm out so we sat at a nice table right by the window.  We could look out without being in the cooler weather.  Though there were quite a few people sitting outside.  I had the Crispy fried goat cheese salad organic mesclun, crispy friend good cheese, strawberries, walnuts w/ pomegranate balsamic vinaigrette.  This was so tasty.  Loved all of the components.  The goat  cheese was nicely crisp on the outside and soft inside.  The dressing was sweet and tangy.  Good size portion.  They had lots of French breakfast items on the menu too. Waffles, crepes, definitely looked yummy. Definitely will come back if I am in Hoboken again.
2019-10-02,5,My favorite local, French cafe. Nice family-ran business that I am more than happy to support. Great customer service!
2019-09-12,5,Delicious food and great coffee. The place and staff are very welcoming. Wifi works great and the music is not loud in case you need to work.I will definitely be coming back
2019-09-07,5,My wife and I come here about once a week for the organic and healthy food options. The place is charming and always has a refreshing and relaxing ambiance.  If you are in the neighborhood, you will not be disappointed!
2019-09-07,2,We went to this place few times.  Service is slow. They messed up our order even thought I asked not to add eggs.  They started to blame each other , cook for messing up.  Didn't even write off fromThe bill.  Water glass smelled like a fish.  I'm not sure how they washed it.  My food was good.  My friend's food was cold. We will be going to bluestone moving forward.
2019-09-02,5,Love this place!!! I started going here since they move to Washington St and can't recommend it enough. Food is delicious and from organic sources the majority of the vegetables and the service is amazing, everyone is so nice and friendly. Definitely one of my go-to spots here in Hoboken.
2019-08-20,3,I wanted to like this place because it's a cute little restaurant, but honestly I was not impressed with the food.  I ordered the chicken seemed fake, like a microwaveable chicken.  It wasn't really grilled.  The bottom of my sandwich was soggy, I don't know why they served it on a wet plate.  Again I feel bad writing a bad review, so I will come back again to try something different and will update my rating accordingly.
2019-07-20,4,I came here on a weekday for brunch with a friend. The servers were attentive, as I sat there for a while because my friend was late. The coffee is really good and they have lots of other drink options. It's also BYOB but I believe they charge you per person (kind of a bummer in my opinion). I ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs and it was really delicious and fresh. The eggs were perfect and it came with a side of well seasoned potatoes. We also ordered the Brioche French toast and it was good but a little dry (needed a lot of syrup/berry sauce). I would come back to this place for sure, it's a little small and I imagine it can get packed on a busy weekend.
2019-07-14,1,We walked in three of us and it was clear our waitress was already upset with us just for showing up. She seated us at one table and after some time took our order and sat another table of four. Which is when a man waiting outside became irate after not being seated because they apparently "had a reservation". We were then promptly kicked out of our seats along with other tables and they put three of us into a small cramped two person table. A quarter of my side of the table was blocked by a pole covered in rope which I scratched my arm on about several times. Had to ask for cups and utensils multiple times. The dirty chi was good, the food was just okay, and the service was terrible.
2019-07-06,1,The worst! Menu was promising but the trouble started with the waitress who barely spoke/understood English or the menu items, coffee order was average, eggs order was wrong so they took the whole plate away for 10mins and returned it with 2 fresh eggs and the rest of the food completely cold. After 15mins of being unable to get any attention a waitress finally noticed my mostly full plate with napkin and asks if everything is ok - I tell her no, it all came back completely cold, her response was "ohhhhh" and offered an empathetic sucks-for-you sad face then continued cleaning the table next to me, she later came back and offered (30mins after it was first cooked) to "reheat it" I told her no thank you I didn't want to send it back a 2nd time nor did I want to eat old reheated food and would instead finish my coffee.  I was then offered a doggy bag - guess she thought I prefer to use my own microwave, when I declined she left the plate as pictured on the table for another 20mims while I drank my coffee then they argued about taking the inedible bits off the bill. If you want bad service, wah wah coffee and cold/inedible/reheated foods then this is the place for you!
2019-07-01,2,I don't like having to give bad reviews, however, this place's only positive was the cute ambiance and decor. Our server did check on us once which was appreciated. We were one of two (or three) customers in there at the time. My boyfriend and I wanted to give this place a try because we heard some good things. Disappointed! We ordered the lemonade (it was recommended), eggs Norwegian, and side of avocado. The lemonade was too sweet for my liking and the lemons were not fresh. I used this to flavor my glass of water. Watered down, it was better. The avocado was $3 which is ridiculous considering it's not even quite half an avocado and it was overripe! We couldn't even finish it. Not fresh at all. The eggs Norwegian; the salmon was the only good part of this dish and the undressed arugula was fresh and good. The potatoes were cooked well but had minimal flavor and no seasoning. Nothing impressive. The bread of the eggs Norwegian was not toasted. So simple a thing. The poached eggs were severely over cooked. Only one of them had a tiny amount of runny yolk. The other egg yolk was completely cooked through. The egg whites were both partially raw on both eggs which is bizarre. How does that even happen when poaching eggs?? I didn't even want to eat them. They also were not seasoned with salt or pepper. The sauce was okay. This dish is also very overpriced for what you get. We will not be returning here. Much better options for food elsewhere.
2019-06-22,2,Gave La Bouche a try, after seeing that they used Balthazar breads for their dishes--which is always promising, as Balthazar Bakery never fails. My SO and I went at around 11AM and were seated outside immediately, and though it was a tight fit, we were able to enjoy the beautiful weather. The service was lovely, with attentive and kind waitresses, and the location on Washington is great; however, the food left much, much to be desired. I got the chicken panini and it... lacked cohesiveness, for a lack of a better descriptor. Each of the pieces of pesto, chicken, tomato, and cheese were distinctly separate--not melded together into a harmony of flavour, as paninis should be. Though the prosciutto panini that my SO had gotten was slightly better, the meat of the prosciutto was extremely tough--unlike prosciutto, and more like deli ham--and the sweetness of the apricot jam overpowered the flavour of the entire sandwich. As a final touch, the presentation of the dishes were surprising in their sparseness; though less important, the dishes would perhaps have better been served without the side bed of leaves. Most definitely not worth the prices, and you would get much better bang-for-your-buck at brunch places elsewhere. Bumped up to two stars for the kind and speedy service!
2019-06-20,2,The ambiance is very cute but execution leaves a lot to be desired.Can you mess up a croque madame? Apparently so. The fried egg was overcooked and the entire sandwich was under seasoned (impressive considering it has ham and cheese). It comes with an undressed salad of greens. I also got the eggs Benedict. Again, salad was not dressed. This also came with Lyonaise style potatoes. Let me tell you that I love potatoes but did not like these one bit! They were bland, boiled potatoes that were not very appetizing. On top of that, it had onion skin (the outer layer) mixed in which tells me this cook was pretty sloppy in preparing it. DO NOT order the cappuccino. You WILL be disappointed.  I ordered a "small" and got a pitiful half mug of what looked like a latte. No foam, very bland. Ugh. Don't order this or else you will want your money back. We came around 11am, and it wasn't too busy, but there was only one server. By the time it hit 12, the cafe was mostly full and it took her forever to get around to all the guests. If you're looking for a cute French cafe, skip this one. You will be disappointed.
2019-06-07,4,My co-worker and I were early for a meeting and we wanted to stop in somewhere for breakfast.   We strolled down Washington Street during an early Friday morning and found this little quaint and charming restaurant.  A very nice selection of eggs, waffles, French Toast, and other delicacies cooked fresh.  I had the cheese omelet which came with bacon and roasted potatoes.  As a coffee snob, I would say the coffee was good.  My co-worker had a fancy omelet inside a croissant.  She loved it as well as the Cappuccino she ordered.  My omelet was very tasty and it was what I would expect from a cute and quaint little restaurant like this one.  Must have been the presentation.  Of course the bacon and roasted potatoes were a good accompaniment.   Service was good and friendly and the prices were very reasonable.  Nice ambiance and there is seating outside during the good weather months.
2019-05-23,3,Listen, I didn't want give a low rating but the dish I got wasn't good at all. I went with a friend for breakfast; I asked for the avocado toast and he asked for the Norwegian Eggs.  The Avocado toast is bad; honestly, stick to French dishes this is not your forté. First, the bread is not thick enough and toasted enough; maybe not even toasted. I am pretty sure they don't even use fresh avocados; and whatever packaged avocado they use, they don't put a lot of it; maybe it's better they didn't. The eggs were perfectly poached; one good thing; but then on top of them they put that  jarred Doritos salsa they sell in any store; which I personally find disgusting.  I had to get it out of my toast immediately; thank god she brought us Cholula. IThe dish also comes with potatos; which tasted good and a some lettuce. My friend's dish was good; he finished it and didn't complain like I did; he also didn't rave about it; so I'm assuming it was ok but nothing out of this world. I have to say, I love how they decorated the place; it's all white and looks super cozy. They play nice music at a good volume. The drinks were also good; I ordered a latte with almond milk, my friend a chai latte.  Anyway, I really wanted to love this place because it's so convenient for me; but not sure I will try it again.
2019-05-22,4,Amazing addition to the downtown area. Also passed it in the morning on the way to work so I finally decided to stop by. Came before 8 in the morning (didn't realize they just opened!). However, the owner was very generous to let me place an order while I was there and return to pay. Can't beat good service and good accommodations.Tried their cheese omelette and their Greek omelette. Omelettes came with a side order of potatoes and lettuce. Loved that it came in compostable boxes! Their iced coffee was also good - added a bit of caramel syrup for flavor. Can't wait to return and try some more of their items
2019-05-18,4,Great restaurant delicious sandwiches/ paninis! Friendly atmosphere and delicious kale salad!
2019-03-17,3,I love this brunch place in Hoboken, one of my favs! Small menu but it has good food so go try it! My fav is wild mushroom omelette and iced mocha.
2019-01-22,4,I came here to get breakfast with a friend and overall was happy with my meal. The place is a little cramped because it's small. I usually don't mind this but was sort of annoyed do to my table being right up against the napkins/condiments area so I had no choice but to actually lean on that. Other than that, the coffee was great and food was delicious. Very good breakfast menu selection. I did notice people giving worse reviews due to the slowish service. But I think that's a positive at a place like this to actually take your time and enjoy your coffee.
2018-12-31,3,Very nice local neighborhood cafe.   Not a lot of seating; probably nice to sit outside when the weather is good.   The goat cheese panini with prosciutto and apricot jam is delicious.   I really like goat cheese and appreciate that is it is evenly spread across the sandwich so that you taste it and the other flavors in every bite.   We also had a chicken and mushroom crepe, which was only so-so.  The crepe was more like a pancake; generous with  ingredients, but not much flavor.
2018-12-26,5,This is probably my favorite breakfast place in town. Quiet, clean, fresh and delicious food. I love the service - always very friendly. Perfect place for a date or for a family meal. You'll never be disappointed!
2018-12-17,5,Visited Hoboken and decided to try this place for breakfast and coffee. Food was good and great coffee. If I ever visit NJ again I'll definitely will return.
2018-11-29,5,I literally created a Yelp account so I could give this business 5 stars. I had a small baby shower here and couldn't have been happier with the service I received. I was told that I had to have a minimum of 10 people in order to reserve the whole restaurant but this was no problem for me, given that I was having a party. I was able to do some light decorating around the place, but it's so cute as it is that I really didn't have to do much.The owner was very responsive and worked with me to create a very affordable menu and ensure all of my needs were met. She even allowed me to bring in alcohol for mimosas and provided orange juice as part of my package. The food was amazing (and plenty) and the servers couldn't have been more attentive. I will definitely be holding another event here in the future. Thank you Ezra and the staff a La Bouche for making the shower one to remember!
2018-11-13,4,We came here a Saturday morning for a low-key brunch. It was exactly what I was looking for. It was one of the first chillier mornings, so I opted for hot chocolate which was so chocolatey ! My fiance ordered a London fog, which also came out delicious.For meals, I ordered the waffles with fruit and Nutella and I was in heaven. Absolutely amazing brunch. Not to mention, the place is BYOB, which is fantastic.
2018-10-23,5,My favorite cafe in Hoboken, it has a lovely, quaint French charm that makes you feel good the minute you walk in.  I just love their decor!  Especially the chandelier with tiny little bird cages hanging in it, and the lived in pastel chair pillows.  The menu is extensive and lovely.  They also have outdoor seating, but so far I've only come here when it's been cold, so have enjoyed some cozy brunches inside.I recommend the French toast - it is made with light and fluffy brioche, and the mascarpone and berry sauce send it over the top.  Tea is lovely and definitely want to try the dirty Chai based on other reviews.  I've had the Greek omelet but have to warn you - it's huge!  Order only of you're ready for a lot of eggs and cheese.  My boyfriend had the eggs Benedict which seems popular here, and said it was great.  We want to come back for lunch and try the lentil soup.  Generous portions and prompt, friendly service.
2018-09-16,1,Came here with my bf, who btw I see once a month due to distance, and was hoping to have a nice breakfast before I went to work. I had work at 12pm and we sat down at 9am. When seated we were told that it would be a 15 minute wait. No problem. It ended up being a 30 minute wait to get our order and then another 1.5 hours to get the food. It was 11 and I still had to get ready and drive to work and we still hadn't gotten our food. The table next to us left angry and without paying for this service. We just packed it to go and I ate it on the way to work. Not how I would like to spend a rare breakfast with my bf and before a long day at work. The food itself is also mediocre and over priced.
2018-07-24,5,You can get a feel of a place when it does the simplest things to perfection. This quiet walk pass spot known mainly to local residents offers a variety of mouth watering choices. The menu has vegan options along with the salty ham and bacon add on for a little extra $$. Don't put pass this small footprint of a place, come in and try one of the many dishes it provides.
2018-07-03,5,The cafe is small and cozy and has an outdoor tables as well. It's easy to access as it's close to the Path station on the 1st street. The food was great and the service was outstanding.
2018-06-29,5,Great place for breakfast! Coming here the second time today. Absolutely cute cafe, with friendly stuff. Coffee is perfect as well as fruity crepes
2018-06-21,5,Go here! Get the waffles! WORTH IT, WORTH IT, WORTH IT! Never been a miss, always great - no matter the meal, but I'm a waffle girl at heart. Their food is so delightful, the midday stop-in for lunch fits perfect into my schedule. The cafe is perfect inspiration for anyone stuck on work or their personal life. It just makes you feel better once you step in.
2018-05-13,3,Cute place, comfortable seating. Food was okay but not what we expected. I wish there was no egg inside the salmon crepe. The cappuccino was great though!
2018-05-06,5,Very cute little spot in downtown Hoboken! Came here a few weeks ago for a Saturday breakfast. Was greeted and sat down quickly and got really tasty lattes to start. Both my friend and I got the avocado toast which was delicious. The flavors were pleasant and the food fresh. I will definitely be back to cover more of the menu!
2018-04-29,5,Loved this café so much, as soon as you walk in you can see how cozy it is. The food is so delicious ! I got the salmon sandwich , to die for ! Also tried their pouched eggs , Omgsh!! So good !! If you're looking for a cute cafe , with tasty food this is the spot to come to !Plus the owner is really sweet , great customer service !
2018-04-24,3,Very nice space however the food was fairly forgettable. Adequate but shame the food doesn't match the nice seating environment.
2018-04-23,5,This is my favorite cafe in town. Great food, great coffee, and the service is outstanding! Outdoor seating available. Definitely worth checking out. I'll be back
2018-04-15,4,The cafe is a cozy spot that looks straight from a rom-com.  I just stop by for a morning treat and it did not disappoint.
2018-03-27,5,My girlfriend and I love this place; it's our favorite brunch spot in town!  Very cozy inside and it does offer outside seating when the weather is right.  As for the food and coffees - they're outstanding (I always seem to get the spicy wild mushroom omelette and it never disappoints)!  Waitstaff has always been very friendly and accommodating.  The only negative thing I could possibly say about this place is that it's a bit on the pricey side.  But it's sure to be a great brunch experience!
2018-01-28,3,Positives: A splendid quiet and cozy atmosphere. Friendly and personal service. A huge omelette, packed with ham and cheddar. Negatives: A bit pricey for common breakfast items. Bacon was seemingly microwaved. Gentleman serving us didn't let us know that both meals came with side of potatoes when we ordered what turned out to be an extra side of potatoes. Somewhere in-between: Eggs Benedict was decent but when served on harder focaccia bread was difficult to maneuver. Pitcher of water was room temperature, perhaps a bit warmer.
2018-01-20,5,Excellent food & service was great! Cute little cozy brunch spot in Hoboken & great prices. Family owned by a French family: super friendly. Definitely will return  it's a very small space with 6-7 tables so the wait was a bit but it was worth every minute!
2017-12-27,3,Came here with my husband and his brother for brunch. After having the meal here, I realized why they had such a low ratings. The service was extremely slow! We were waiting for a while for the food to come out and then for the check to be printed.I had the spicy wild mushroom omelet. I wasn't able to tell the "wild" part. It was a little spicy with jalapeno peppers. My husband had the croque madame, which didn't impress him at all. His brother had a crepe, which seemed a little better but on the dry side.
2017-12-16,3,This place is ok. Nothing special, really.The Croque Madame was one of the laziest I've ever had. For the bread, they seemed to have used packaged supermarket slices. The egg on top was SO overcooked and hard. There was no Mornay sauce or any kind of sauce at all. Don't get me wrong, the whole thing tasted alright, but it was so boring that I almost fell asleep. The coffee did help to keep me awake, but I was a bit surprised that they charge you for refills. It's not like the coffee was amazing or anything, it was just alright.In terms of decor, the place just looks really old school and not very well maintained.The service was decent, but a bit slow. I guess that's just the French style.
2017-10-06,5,Got their french toast, and it was simply delicious. Their service is good too!
2017-10-03,1,Have eaten here a ton of times as well as  take out.  Today I call for take out and go pick it up.  Get home and there is no potatoes with my omelette.  Called them to let them know and went to pick it up.  The waitress tells me that take out gets no sides that they do when you eat in the cafe.  Same price.  That's ridiculous.  Paying the same price but not getting the whole meal like you would if you are eating at the cafe. Disappointed.  Probably will never go again.  It's a shame because it's around the corner.
2017-09-16,5,True French food. Focus on lean meats and veggies with delicious dressings. Friendly staff and cute environment - and best of all, multiple menu options that were gluten and dairy free! I had the Niçoise salad with added bacon  and tea.
2017-09-09,5,Cuuuuute little place, perfect spot for enjoying brunch on a sunny breezy day at its outdoor tables!The French toast was delicious, and adding the mascarpone creamy cheese and the chill berry puree made it even better!The dirty Chai is the best Chai drink I have ever had! The sweetness, the creaminess, and the bubbliness was at the most perfect balance. I'll surely order it every time I go from now on.Will definitely come again to try their other brunch dishes, with the dirty Chai it is! :)
2017-09-05,5,It's a small Cafe at the street corner of Hoboken. I was here for a lazy Sunday brunch and boy did this place make it worth our time. I got an iced vanilla latte which was great and a madame croquet which was a little smaller portion than I was expecting but very good nonetheless. To top it off we had the Bailey's mudcake which was again fuckin A but it was a huge portion and even 2 people sharing it couldn't finish it. But no complains it was labor day but not very busy, the service was good the food was immaculate.Highly recommended and hope to be back here soon !!
2017-09-03,1,Just left this place, been here before a few times with decent food and service.. this time very different. Food came out wrong for one of us, and instead of them fixing it on they're own they awkwardly brought it out saying "ummm, they didn't put the sauce on the side but do you still want it?" Obviously we do not. Then in the middle of our meal the tall man asked us to move to a different table since a bigger party was coming... ridiculous, we did not move. Maybe your severs shouldn't sit a party of three in a larger table. To ask us to get up in the middle of our meals is insane. And then to top it all off, upon leaving the tall man chased us outside with one of our empty iced coffee cups which we brought in from another store. He gave it to me and said "take your trash this isn't from out store" I grabbed it and retuned back into the store and slammed it down on the table. He then grabbed it and ran outside after us again and threw it into a garbage while mumbling under his breath. Yes we came in with iced coffee from a different place, but we sat at this restaurant and ordered food ate and we're paying customers. It was one piece of trash.I live around the block from this place and will not be retuning. Maybe they should learn a thing or two about customer service and manners. Many other spots in Hoboken are better than this little dump
2017-08-06,5,Forgot our coffees until we reminded them after the brunch meals came out. The owner/manager came out to personally apologize and did not put them on the bill. The way in which he did it was so sincere and full of class.These people get it. These people care. Oh and btw. The food was awesome!! The atmosphere was great. 100% returning.
2017-07-30,3,This is a very cute family owned French cafe. The service is good, but food is just alright.
2017-07-18,3,The food is alright, nothing to write home about. Prices are fair and the service is alright.  Good for a coffee and crossiant.
2017-07-16,3,Came here for brunch. My croissant egg and cheese is good, but my wife's jalapeno mushroom omelet has all the mushroom in one half and all the jalapenos in the other half, making the jalapeno half way too spicy.
2017-06-27,1,Cakes were not fresh, after eating here so many times I asked the  owner to call me not a return call to even address the  hard poor  quality cake.. Will not eat here again.
2017-06-25,5,What a nice little spot! If you're not from around here, do yourself a favor and walk down to La Bouche. My wife and I were visiting Hoboken from New York, and this was a great spot for brunch.We ordered a croque madame, the croissant with bacon, egg, and cheese, and a side of their Lyonnaise potatoes. All of it was fresh and delicious. Service was quick and welcoming, and the location is very quaint and comfortable. Perfect for a date or just a relaxing meal.
2017-06-05,4,Get the eggs benedict!!! Every time I come here, my friends and I order the eggs benedict with either mushroom and ham or smoked salmon and it's amazing. I personally like the mushroom and ham better, but both are great. I have yet to try the dessert but I've seen a lot of people get the French toast. The only bad thing is that they don't have AC and limited seating, so I sweated a pound off when I ate outside once in the summer.
2017-06-04,5,been here twice before and will definitely keep coming back! they have perfect brunch dishes, that aren't too heavy but perfectly filling! the norwegian and avocado toast both come with eggs that i usually get runny, which honestly makes the entire dishplus it's BYOB, which is always a good thing
2017-05-16,3,My friends and I had wound up having brunch at La Bouche Café, after we had been turned away from a neighboring coffee shop that had been closed for a private event.  Though it was my first time at the quaint spot, my friends had been there previously.  They had commented on the poor service, but had thought that the food had been fine.  Well, boy, they had not been kidding on the service piece.  On this occasion, we were sitting outside, which could often lead to lengthy waiting times at even the most efficient restaurants, and this was much worse.  Throughout the meal, we had to continually ask for things, such as silverware, water, condiments, and more.  In fact, some of our inquiries had even needed to be repeated multiple times!  f Despite the frustration-producing wait staff, our meal was actually rather tasty.  My Mediterranean Salad was huge and included a bulk of fresh ingredients, such as chickpeas, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, red onions, dill, and black olives.   I also had the option to add sprinkles of feta cheese, but I decided to stick with the base-level version.  Lastly, I had also ordered a coffee, which had been rich and flavorful.La Bouche Café was really an adorable space with a simple, yet varied, menu.  It was really a shame that the service had been so poor, because I would otherwise be much more interested in returning.
2017-05-14,4,Quaint little curbside restaurant. Omlettes are of good size with tastey red potatoes with herbs/garlic. Service is kind but a bit disorganized. A place to go if you are not in a rush.
2017-05-08,3,Came here with friends for dessert, specifically waffles. We settled on the Belgium waffles and had all the toppings (Nutella, bananas, strawberries, chocolate sauce). Later we found out that the chocolate sauce costed an extra $0.50. Had we known earlier we wouldn't have wanted that. Anyway, the waffles arrived shortly and initially we were baffled about the Nutella presence. It was actually on the bottom piece of waffle and not evenly distributed on every piece. The waffle was dry.... But the toppings especially Nutella made up for the dryness. Would have appreciated it being covered with some maple sauce! Probably won't return as the place is super tiny and food is just average.
2017-05-06,5,Loved this cute, charming, family owned French cafe.  Got the avocado egg toast, the bread was gorgeous.  People couldn't be nicer.  So glad we found this gem.
2017-04-23,1,HORRIBLE SERVICE. Had to ask three times for water , and twice for silverware. The couple sitting next to us who ordered their food 20 minutes after we did got their orders and finished their plates before we got our food. No apologies from the staff. I will never be going back.
2017-04-23,2,30 minutes and counting still don't have my mushroom omelette. They did bring my husband's dish, but no silverware....trying too hard to be French...hopelessly America diner tasting brunch. 3 waitresses could not keep track of around 15 tables, not sure if the lack of any smiles is due to the overwhelming tasks at hand, pompous imitation of French demeanor or general poor service .... will not return.
2017-04-13,5,Delicious spicy wild mushroom omelette with mixed greens, avocado and the best potatoes I've ever had.  Cute French vibe cafe with outdoor seating.  The only thing missing was a mimosa!
2017-04-06,2,The restaurant looks cute from the outside but the food was TERRIBLE! coffee was good but brunch was cold and the salad was so bad unlike the other Yelp pictures. My bread was burn as well. The table was not clean and the waiter was slow. Maybe just happened the day I went but definitely won't give a second chance. Forgot to mentioned that my bf had a glass of water with residual salty stains on the cup.
2017-04-04,5,Stumbled on this while dealing with morning commute troubles. Boy am I glad I did. I loved this place. Great coffee and the prosciutto omelette was delicious. It is rare to see this sort of quality any more - will be coming back again.
2017-04-02,2,Every time I come here something always gets messed up with my order. It's a tiny spot with unfriendly staff and unfortunately an overall sloppy dining experience. The only option is to get a coffee and pastry to go....pass on dining in.
2017-03-21,3,Cute small cafe. The food was OK, it wasn't that great. Not as impressed as I wanted to be!
2017-02-13,5,One of the cutest places in the universe, great ambience, great music, super confortable, scones and chocolate mud are top of the notch and Revna is adorable. We recommend this place to all our friends and of course we'll be back.
2017-02-08,3,The first time I came here I was pleased with my order so I went there again today. I'm not sure if it was the owner or manager, but I'm pretty sure she yelled at a worker because she exchange something I had gotten. I didn't know whether to say something but the chocolate cake was not only expensive, but it tasted so bad. The worst thing I've tasted in my life.... I changed it for a carrot cake and I'm sure that made the owner/manager mad. I felt so bad... Also while I was eating, they decided to mop the place, which I found kinda disrespectful because it wasn't like they were just opening or closing. They could have waited until we left since there was no one around... I felt like a disturbance versus a customer. Needless to say I don't think I'll be going back again. PS: I'm sorry to the girl that I might have gotten in trouble. I didn't mean to.
2017-01-18,5,I found La Bouche through Yelp, only 2 blocks from my apartment and had never discovered it before! What a cute little café-like place for some yummy breakfast. I came in with one friend, and we both ordered an omelet and coffee. There were cakes in a display case that looked homemade, and the décor around the place was like a little French café. It was fairly priced, and I will definitely be back. I heard somebody come up to the front and order food to go as well, so as cute as it is to dine-in, also have take out options as well!
2016-12-26,3,Cute cozy place. For some reasons I had high expectations when I walked in but was not too impressed by the food, not bad, just mediocre. Ambiance is great. I would come back for coffee and pastries if I'm in that area but not excited to come out of the way here for food.
2016-12-15,5,Leisurely little café with the best cappuccino in Hoboken. This place is a nice break from reality as it is decorated extremely cute with the Parisian style.  This is not a place to go if you are in a rush, it is definitely more like being on vacation and enjoying your breakfast perfect for a little brunch date when you have the time to relax. I've ordered a couple of things on the menu mostly egg dishes and sandwiches and I think it's really great. I've been here four or five times and never been disappointed
2016-11-26,3,We had brunch here this morning and this place is just okay. Nothing special. I had an omelette and my wife had the avocado toast. Both dishes were okay, but nothing spectacular. We also shared crepes, but they were very forgettable (they actually seemed to lack flavor). There are much better brunch spots in Hoboken (although they are all uptown).
2016-11-17,4,Was visiting friends and had a great brunch here. Delicious coffee. Tiny inside but very cozy atmosphere.
2016-09-25,3,This place has absolutely delicious food especially the brunch. The eggs are light, fluffy and filling. However, their big situation is out of control. Gnats and flies swarm you as soon as you sit inside or outside. It's gross to sit here and eat your breakfast amongst the bugs. If they're bad in the dining area, I shudder to think what it's like in the actual kitchen.
2016-09-15,3,I ate here for a meeting, while we enjoyed our time here, the food was just okay. Very heavy hand with the salt, and that is coming from a salt feign. There was no restroom available which I find odd in a restaurant. The decor was charming, but unfortunately I don't see myself making a return trip.
2016-09-14,2,Food and ambiance was mediocre. Inside seemed very unclean though. There were flies all over and a sign inside the bathroom that said to put used toilet paper in the trash, not the toilet- yuck.
2016-08-28,4,I guess it about timing. Came back a second time and this time it all went well. Reason being it was a very early Sunday with few customers. Food was good. Service friendly. So lesson to learn come here early. LOL!!
2016-08-14,3,This seemed like an adorable little french cafe, and it was. There were mixmatched chairs, vintage furniture pieces, and really kitschy but somehow cute items scattered about. They  made a great dirty chai, and adding a bit of cinnamon made it even better. We ordered 2 and they initially forgot one of them, which was odd as there were two of us. There was a couple sitting next to us and they forgot the cheese in one of their omelettes. They were very friendly but seem to be disorganized. While the mixmatched chairs were cute, one was rather dirty. Definitely charming but not the BEST food or service around.
2016-07-22,4,Love the decor and the space. Small personal little cafe. I ordered the Eggs Norwegian and an iced coffee. Both were delicious. My only complaint is that they sprinkled paprika on my eggs. I've ordered eggs Norwegian at many places since it is one of my favorite brunch options and have never had this. As someone who doesn't enjoy spicy flavors I wish they would have asked if I wanted paprika sprinkled on top. It wasn't written on the menu as one of the ingredients and I personally don't think paprika goes with eggs Benedict. I do know a lot of people enjoy spicy flavors, so I just wish it was an option they asked about. I was able to wipe most of it off, and it ended up being amazing!
2016-07-10,4,Delicious! Went with the fiancé to grab a late breakfast. Cute outdoor and indoor outdoor space, very much the French cafe feel. Service is a leaves a little something to be desired but it is not awful either.I had the Norwegian eggs Benedict and she had the sharp cheddar omelette with ham. Mine was fantastic, poached eggs were perfectly runny and the salmon was an awesome change of pace. Her eggs were a bit "wet" for her taste, so if you normally like your eggs s bit more well done I would ask for it. Both came with some seasoned potatoes and a little salad. Potatoes wetter fantastic.Will definitely return.
2016-07-09,2,Not great. Menu looks inspiring, however food is only so-so and service feels short staffed.
2016-06-24,4,This place is a very cute cafe! It's extremely tiny but quaint inside, great that they have outdoor seating! I ordered The spicy mushroom omelette, it was made perfectly! I think they may be understaffed however, as I noticed the order in which customers asked for something was incorrect. I get that it's busy on a Saturday morning though. It's slightly a ways from where I live but would come back if I'm in the area!
2016-06-22,4,This review is late in coming because I haven't been on Yelp in a while.  Need to get back to La Bouche soon!Hubby and I were here back in Feb/March on the coldest day of the year.  Their simple, fresh menu was VERY appealing, and we loved the funky vibe of the place. The servers are very sweet and helpful when it comes to making menu choices.  We ended up with huge mugs of coffee and amazing oven-baked omelettes.  The slow-cooked omelettes are a revelation!  Super-fluffy, great fillings (cheese, spinach, etc), and incredibly comforting.  The coffee was perfect too.  This place is a tad small, and you'll feel like you're sitting on top of your neighbors, but it's cozy, comforting, and a great find for breakfast/brunch.  Yum!
2016-05-30,4,My friend and I decided to eat here memorial weekend. She ordered latte and the brioche French toast and I ordered croissant with egg and cheese add in bacon and Arnold Palmer. She feels the toast is dry but the coffee is delicious, and I feel the dish is really rich but a little bit too greasy. Love my AP since they used fresh homemade lemonade.
2016-05-14,2,The menu looked really appetizing, but everything was below par. My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and left super disappointed, especially since it is located so close to his apartment.PS: The side of bacon we ordered was like the cheap, microwaveable Great Value type - super thin (the fat strips were see-through like cellophane), and broke into crumble upon picking them up. Cost $4 if I remember correctly, too. Womp.
2016-05-03,3,An ok spot, service was meh so that's why the 3 stars. I've been a couple times. It's a small cafe but with a surprisingly robust menu for the space.We popped in for brunch the other day and it was a bit packed but we got a seat outside. Took awhile for the server to come over, she took our order and that was really the last we saw of her until the check. I got the prosciutto omelette and it was delicious, and huge! The potatoes were a little cold but still not bad. There was a ton of goat cheese in it which I love. My wife got the avocado toast which was also good. We never got an offer for another or even water so drinks were empty the majority of the meal.It's on the other end of town from us, so maybe I'd swing by again but maybe just to grab a coffee and go.
2016-05-02,2,Didn't have an amazing experience here at all. Food meh, service UGH - the only nice thing about this place was the cute outdoor ambiance... They have a seating area out in front, very small and very cute for a spring or summer afternoon to enjoy the sun. The feel is dainty and elegant - a place you'd go to for afternoon tea and crumpets - but in an imperfect, more relaxed sort of way.Now on to the important stuff....Service review comes first because it was that bad. We came to this place on a weekend afternoon for a light brunch, and when we arrived here, they asked us if it would be okay if the three of us were seated at a table for two. That's fine, we said. So we were brought to the outside seating area to a small table with two seats. My friend stood...and stood...and stood as we waited for a third seat to be brought for us. It wasn't. We asked one of the wait staff for another seat, and she seemed confused. And then we asked another staff member for another seat - also seemed confused. The whole situation got so awkward after after a while with my friend standing there as other tables were served and eating, wait staff walking past without noticing... Almost funny (almost).When we were finally all seated (after a ridiculously long time), we waited and waited for someone to come and take our order. And waited and waited to get our food. You get the gist.As for the food, I ordered the Eggs Benedict Mushroom with Ham. It wasn't anything special - maybe because it was cold when I got it. Not impressed.TLDR; vowed never to come back here because the service sucked that bad,; hoped that the food would be redeeming but it wasn't.
2016-04-27,5,My new favorite study spot - soft music, warm lighting, delicious food and a fine cup of coffee! The atmosphere is super cute with a vintage, girly vibe. The staff has that great mix of being friendly but not chatty, there the moment you need something but hands off while you're having a quiet morning.
2016-04-23,2,I wanted to love this place, and the Croque Madame I ordered was pretty good. But the service was terrible. My girlfriends and I went on a late Sunday afternoon and there were about 2-3 other groups eating at that time. It took us a very long time to order and a longer time to get our food. They brought out our entrees at vastly different times (at least a 20 minute difference). When my food finally arrived there was a huge hair in plain sight, which turned us all off. I won't be back.
2016-03-14,3,This place has a cozy atmosphere and the staff is really nice, but the food wasn't that great. I had a panini and asked for no mushrooms. I guess to them that means "add all of the mushrooms in the kitchen in this girl's sandwich". There was one couple that order their food before me and my meal took 20 minutes. Don't think I'll be going back there.
2016-02-23,3,I've been here twice recently for brunch and the first time everything went smoothly and nothing was particularly bad. However, the second time, we had the same waitress and she seemed somewhat off her game compared to the first time; we ordered two coffees (one for each of us) and received one straight away and had to ask for the other one after our food had already arrived. It's a small thing to notice, but really shouldn't be happening in a place this small when it's not even a full house.I liked that this place is very true to its culture. French influence can be seen in everything from the food to the interior design to the name of the restaurant. I would recommend giving this place a try!
2016-02-07,2,Microwave bacon. I've never seen something so offensive before. Microwave f*ing bacon. How do you serve microwave bacon in a restaurant? Does the kitchen even have a stove?Two stars because the place is trying to be quaint and other than the bacon it was okay (not okay as in I would go back, but okay like better than one star because it wasn't an entire disaster and it was pretty cheap). Limited options in Hoboken for good restaurants unless you like chicken wings and bros, so it's unfortunate that this place doesn't make the cut.
2016-01-31,2,A hole in the wall! I should have returned to Elysian cafe, their brunch is superb, same prices, but much classier and cleaner. Never again!
2016-01-05,4,Whoops - I thought I posted this review a few weeks ago and it was still in my drafts!Anyways - I met a friend for breakfast at La Bouche and it was wonderful. The cafe was tiny and the atmosphere was cute, cozy and very friendly. My friend and I chatted for quite sometime before opening the menu and they did not rush us at all. I ordered a coffee, which was delicious...I'm not sure what brand they use but I would like to find out. For breakfast, I ordered the eggs florentine and it was amazing. The eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise sauce had a great consistency and the bread it was served on was AWESOME. It came with a side of potatoes and a mixed green salad, which were equally as delicious. If you're looking for a quite, cozy breakfast, I highly recommend giving this place a try! I will definitely be back.
2015-12-28,3,This cafe serves as a decent spot for people living in or visiting downtown who are looking for something casual,yet more than a bagel on a weekday or weekend morning or afternoon.They do most dishes good enough such as omelets, crepes, and a Nicoise salad. Their take on Lyonnaise potatoes is a particular standout.However, dining here does require some patience. Be prepared to sit in cramped quarters, with a mostly understaffed kitchen and waitstaff. This is not exactly a quick meal. Also, most dishes come with a meager collection of greens that serves more as a garnish than an actual side salad. You will also hear microwaves being used in the kitchen.Given the choices of eateries in Hoboken, many of which are overpriced and forgettable, you could do far worse than choosing to frequent La Bouche. You just have to be prepared to take the good with the frustrating.
2015-12-15,5,I love this cozy little spot for weekend brunch. The staff is really nice and we never have to wait long to get a seat or get our food. The menu is nice with so many tasty options. It's been my favorite indulgence during my pregnancy. My only complaint is that it's always a bit too warm inside for my liking (but I'm cooking a baby inside of me, so I'm always overheated). The perfect place to enjoy a quiet brunch with good company!
2015-11-04,4,Yum! Came here for breakfast on a quiet Monday morning. I got the walnut waffle, which was indeed nutty and filling; it came with maple syrup, of course, but the real treats were the little sides of strawberry sauce and mascarpone cheese. There was a very generous dusting of powdered sugar on top, which I personally could have done without, but it made for a rather pretty presentation.Service was friendly but a little slow despite the fact that we were the only ones there. A couple people stopped in but didn't stay long - presumably regulars just grabbing their morning coffee. But if you're not in a hurry and would like to have brunch in a cozy, adorable little cafe, La Bouche is for you!
2015-10-30,5,First time here, and we LOVED it! Def recommend the smoked salmon and mushroom Benedict and the baked tomato omelette! So delicious!!
2015-10-19,5,Once a week me and my friend come here and drink cappuccino and order eggs Norwegian, so good!!! Nice, cozy place, good food and warm atmosphere!
2015-09-20,3,The food was ok and the service mediocre. We had to ask for water and the check. A club sandwich comes with a "salad" which was just dry spinach. Not sure we will be returning.
2015-08-17,4,La Bouche is a tiny but warm place for brunch. The only thing why I gave it four points is that the "berry smoothie" is not smoothie at all. It's kind of beverage which you can easily get from walmart.  They don't have freshly squeezed juices either.
2015-08-10,5,Came in for Sunday brunch. Even though they were a little understaffed, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was beautiful. Truly a hidden gem!
2015-08-10,4,Warm cozy cafe with a wonderful friendly environment.  I enjoyed their outdoor patio. Great coffee and food options.  Reasonable prices.  I would definitely visit again.
2015-08-05,5,La Bouche Cafe is one of the gems of Hoboken. They have some of the best coffee (Miscela d'Oro) and tea (Harney & Sons) that you'll find in town, they serve amazing bread (Balthazar's), and their own cooking is similarly amazing. Brunch is always delicious, the service is wonderful and personable, and I've never had to wait. The eggs are not to be missed, and the crepes are heavenly. The owner is very sweet.I'm excited to try their new dinner service sometime soon, but for now, I unequivocally endorse their brunch.
2015-07-18,1,Worst place. You will be completely forgotten, with exception when they have to bring your food. I guess they don't want me to pay I had to go to the register myself after 20 minutes and I seriously timed it myself as it was already ridiculous from the beginning. It was my turn at the register and the lady who looks like the owner just kept on reconciling her bills with disregard that I was there in front of her, so I had to interrupt and apologized that I don't want to be rude but I it has been 30 minutes after the lady took my plates,  and I need to pay my bill.  No apology was returned and the waitress who came at the register, just played it off that I left and she thought I paid the bill. What a liar. This place just messed with my morning.
2015-06-14,4,So nice to wake up late on a weekend and walk towards Hoboken. And even nicer to have a quiet place to enjoy a big salmon crepe, with a perfect mixture of cream cheese. The crust was soft yet chewy, love it a lot!Decor reminded me of an ancient French yard. So relaxed!
2015-06-06,4,Got the eggs Norwegian and a deviled egg. Deviled egg is served with capers, and while good, was quite runny and the amount of capers almost made them too salty. Eggs Norwegian was a little overloaded with hollandaise sauce, but eggs were poached perfectly - the temperature of the food was slightly lukewarm though, not as warm as I was hoping it to be. Iced latte was on point. Overall aside from a few things, great food, good coffee and nice people in a cool little setting
2015-05-17,5,My friend and I were looking for a decent brunch spot in Hoboken (since I just moved here from Brooklyn).. This place was amazing! We're coming back next weekend for some more!
2015-04-02,2,Cute atmosphere, but the food is ridiculously over priced. And the chicken was severely undercooked, only three tomatoes and two slices of avocado, basically paid $12 for a plate of mixed lettuce. Services is awful, some douche in a fedora will take 20 minutes waiting to take your check when he's literally standing in front of you.
2015-03-10,4,Have gone to this place multiple times and ordered a variety of foods. everything is delicious. The Mocha is amazing and the staff is very accommodating, even staying open when I have walked in after closing to make me my coffee. It is a small place with about 12-15 seats so it is very cozy, great for a brunch date or to just have a nice hangover meal. The food is very fresh and the waitress always greets you with a warm motherly smile. The barista is awesome and the cook is  top notch. I overlooked this place when I first moved here but now that I've been, it is one of my favorite spots to grab breakfast or and early lunch.Be weary when going early in the morning (very close to opening), although small it can get cold in the winter and cause some menu items from being available before the place gets warmed up but the summer outdoor seating is great and there is hardly a wait to be seated.
2015-01-27,5,Such a wonderful and cozy place. Love everyone who works there. My favorite coffee place.
2015-01-17,5,Great place for breakfast! I got the eggs Benedict and it was delicious, my friend got the French toast and it was very good as well. The ambiance is great! They served the check in a cute vintage looking box which I thought was really cute and original. The waitress was very attentive. I have no complaints about this cafe, absolutely recommend it!
2015-01-01,2,Why do places offer Groupons, then act as if they're doing you a favor and seem upset that you're using it?? If you offer a Groupon, it's for MARKETING purposes. Don't then drive away customers who use it and make them not want to come back.  I actually enjoyed my first visit to La Bouche for lunch a few months ago, the food was pretty good and our French waitress with a pixie cut was really nice and sweet. So I was happy to see a $22 Groupon for 2 drinks ($10 value), 2 sandwiches or salad ($26 value), 1 dessert ($8 value). We go there today, show them the Groupon, the new waiter has no idea what it is, so needs to go behind the counter to ask the owner, fine. So we order an espresso drink and a caramel latte, he has to go ask the owner, comes back and tells us we can only get plain coffee or tea. I tell him the Groupon says up to $10 for 2 drinks which we were well within with our original order, he goes asks the owner, gets the okay.  My affogato espresso drink comes first which is pretty good. Then my bf's caramel latte comes 10 MINUTES later and it's just a regular caramel coffee. He just goes whatever and takes it anyway. Then I order a salmon eggs benedict and he orders a panini, now a more experienced waitress has taken over, goes to ask the owner, comes back and tells him he can only get a sandwich with the Groupon. The paninis are the same price as the sandwiches! Most of the paninis are actually even cheaper. Whatever, he gets the chicken sandwich instead of the chicken panini.  Both are pretty good.Then my boyfriend tries to get a regular coffee refill, they say he can't with the groupon, even though they originally gave him caramel coffee instead of the caramel latte he ordered. Whatever. THEN, we get the brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert which was $6 on the menu.  She brings out a brownie WITHOUT ice cream and says the Groupon doesn't allow for ice cream, even though the Groupon says dessert is up to an $8 value.  FREAKING RIDICULOUS!!One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. Also this is a tiny 8 table place, there were 3 wait staff, and all of them were scrambling and seemed confused. Terribly managed, most likely the owner's fault. Won't be coming back to say the least. I gave 2 stars because the food itself wasn't bad. However the service and how they handled this Groupon situation was so appalling they really only deserve 1 star.  Damn shame because before we came today I was wondering why they only had 3 stars on yelp and was telling my bf how I was going to give them 5 stars to help out their average. They made it impossible to do.
2014-12-26,1,No chance to try any from their menu. It was nice winter day, wanted to sit outside and server rejected us due to he was feeling cold outside and not able to serve. Tried inside, was smelling egg and oil, did not feel comfortable. We'll try in summer when they feel comfortable to serve outside.
2014-11-27,1,I can't believe that their crepe is completely ice cold. so disappointed. my gf's omelette is good though.
2014-11-22,4,The smoked salmon sandwich is pretty amazing. It comes with dill cream cheese, red onion, blue cheese, and on really good bread (crunchy on outside, dough-like on the inside). The service is slow but the menu makes up for it. Their "goaty panini" is delicious as well. It's a panini with goat cheese, fresh warm peaches and prosciutto.   At the end of your meal your bill comes in a tiny little vintage tin. So cute. Love this place, great for breakfast and lunch.
2014-11-04,4,Great breakfast.  Mushroom Omelet was stellar.  Quickly made.  Will be back.
2014-10-11,2,I haven't the foggiest what the appeal is. This coffee shop is marketing itself as a restaurant and serves the most uninspired breakfast imaginable. Each plate comes sprinkled with a few arugula leaves and labeled a salad. I tried the signature chicken sandwich, which was $12, and a total disappoint of cafeteria quality. I also tried the panini which had what appear to be canned peaches on it and is as basic and unappealing as you can make at home, in fact just make your own sandwich at home . They also have an inappropriate policy of asking you how much you want to tip before they run your credit card. The staff is pleasant but the food is not. Price is very off .I think this place needs to re-brand itself as a coffee house only and allow scones to be their only food item.
2014-08-16,2,Nice little French cafe in Hoboken perfect for brunch; however, the food was mediocre at best.My wife ordered the mushroom crepe and was disappointed to find that they simply just poured canned mushrooms and cheese into an oily crepe.  She took one bite and couldn't stop coughing because she must have been allergic to the disgusting canned mushrooms.  When we told the waitress she asked why she didn't say she was allergic to canned mushrooms.  Who says at a restaurant "oh btw I'm allergic to canned food?!"I had the chicken salad which was also disappointing.  It looks like they just put boiled pre-cooked chicken breast strips on top of greens.Although we were willing to pay for the full check our waitress didn't charge us for my wife's crepe (that's why I'm giving them two stars instead of one).  Nevertheless, I don't think we'll ever be coming here again.
2014-08-16,2,Truly mediocre. I had the smoked salmon crepe. Salmon was too fishy, eggs were rubbery. Only saving grace was the field greens and the coffee. Ambiance is cute but service is awful. Will not go back unless I do a takeout coffee.
2014-06-07,2,As a bit of a Francofile, I really had hoped that this cafe would fit the bill. It's charming, I like the rustic French country decor, and the staff is friendly. I love French crepes and looked forward to a very basic mushroom, ham and cheese crepe. The two Creperies in town both use the sweet batter for their savory crepes, which I find disconcerting , but they are basically fast food establishments and don't bill themselves as a French cafe.When the crepe came out and I saw that it too, appeared to be made out of white flour, and not buckwheat, I was disappointed. However, first taste lowered the bar even further! The crepe was too doughy, and fluffy, and tasted like it was made of Bisquick!  Nearly as bad was that the mushrooms were clearly canned, and still cold as if they were thrown into the crepe straight from the can!  There was virtually no flavor to the crepe. Crepes and Things has the consistency correct, and other than not using buckwheat flour, is far better, and three or four dollars cheaper.Sadly, I have no desire to give Le Cafe Bouche a second chance .
2014-05-03,3,not the best or the worst. their french onion soup seems like it's blended cause it's thick and not what I expected but it is pleasant. I haven't been back since the first time I went over a year ago.. nothin to rant and rave about
2014-04-16,3,Decent breakfast food-nice ambiance. Average service.
2014-03-24,3,This place is so quaint! I've wanted to check this place out for a while and I finally walked in the other day. I did not get any food since I had just eaten a bunch of free pizza. But I had a DELICIOUS chai latte. My only issue is that the place is so tiny! You literally can't fit more than 15 people in there, probs only 10 comfortably.And shoutout to the employees who had to deal with those biatches who were giving them such attitude. Remember Yelpers, you have to respect the working man. No one deserves to be talked down to. Well, now that I've vented, I'll definitely be back for brunch or lunch soon!
2014-03-22,2,La Bouche never lives up to what I imagine, based on its appealing look, it will be - and I always trick myself into believing maybe, just maybe, this time will be different (maybe because I live so close by). But, I think I'm finally done with that. The food isn't the problem - it's the service. It's terrible, On multiple occasions, I have waited far too long for my food - or worse, have gotten my food and had to wait 10+ minutes for whomever I've been with to get theirs, with no explanation or apology from the server. No sense of urgency whatsoever. The other issue is how small the place is - which might be fine if there were great service - that small cafe cordiality we all love - but, instead, it's just cramped. Also, their setup makes it seem like you could just walk in and order a coffee to go, but it's always awkward. The servers have to wedge by you to get from the kitchen to the tables, and the diners to get from their tables to the bathroom. It needs a better set up, for many reasons, but also because their coffee is good!I just wish it lived up to the potential that's clearly there.
2014-03-21,2,veery disappointing unfortunately- All i remember with their food was it was not good    : (
2014-03-12,4,This is such a perfect place to meet up with a girlfriend for lunch or coffee. The decor is classic Parisian, and the menu includes a wide variety of small or larger plates.I ordered a chai latte, which was perfectly chai-y and piping hot. Then my friend and I shared Margherita Mac n' cheese and a salad with warm goat cheese and dried cranberries. Both were delicious. The service was great, in fact, she came to our table a few times to take our order, but we had been gabbing so we kept having to send her away. Next time we go back I need to order one of their delicious looking desserts! Talk about eye candy!
2014-02-09,3,I randomly found this little hole in the wall French cafe after wandering around Hoboken. Generally the brunch I had was good but was not perfect. While the Banana and Nutella crepe I had was out of this world and came pretty quickly. I found it a bit annoying that I had to wait to get my tea until the entree, especially since I felt like I would die without some sort of caffeine. The ambiance is cute inside. Nice pillows line the bench on the wall and there is a very quaint romantic feel inside. Not a huge amount of tables though and a very small interior; I would not recommend for groups of more then four people. Will come back as food was pretty good, but might try take out instead.
2014-01-27,2,It seems such a shame to give La Bouche such a low score - everybody wants it to be good and it has such potential that it just fails to live up to.The good: I've been here twice for brunch.  I actually think the food is pretty good. Based on food alone, I'd give them 3 stars for sure.  I've had both times the egg on croissant sandwich - the eggs are fluffy and well prepared and the dish is solid.  The Monte Cristo sandwich is also particularly good.  Coffee and coffee drinks are really good as well.  Much better breakfast/brunch options than ChocOPain which is just across the street.The bad: The atmosphere isn't great.  It's a cute idea with mix and match furniture, lots of toile and a very French feel.  Unfortunately, the whole place just needs like it needs to be renovated.  It's really dingy with peeling paint and ceiling cracks, and it just doesn't feel as clean as I'd really like either - but I think that's more due to age than anything. A warning, it fills up quick, as there are only about 5 or 6 tables inside.The ugly: The service here has been just awful both times I've been.  I don't know how these people can continue to stay employed here, they have absolutely no interest in the customers or their jobs.  They will come over, take your order, and dump your food in front of you.  Not one bit more.  This past time, the girl working there was playing a game on her iPhone the whole time we were there - making everyone listen to the music and sound effects from the app.  Neither she, nor the other guy there, ever asked how everything was, or offered us refills on coffee, we had to practically assault them to get our check. They weren't even busy - there were only 3 parties in the restaurant.  There was just no excuse for that level of inattention. This place has maybe the worst service I've experienced in a sit down restaurant.So...that's the run down.  Good food, awful service, but such potential!
2014-01-22,4,Came here for brunch today and had the Fruit Granola and a crepe. The granola was a really huge portion, so definitely a whole meal , the crepe was so-so. The location is good and the atmosphere nice. The only thing I really did not like - the door was not closing well and it was constantly breezy cold in the back.
2014-01-19,1,Went here for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago, for the first time hoping to have found a local "go-to" French bakery/bistro. Unfortunately, my hopes were quickly shattered. The food is mediocre at best, the service is horrible and the rudeness is above and beyond even French standards ;-) First the food, every dish we ordered came out at different times. So I had my entrée for 10 minutes, before the entrees of the other people in our party were brought over ( also 5 minutes apart). The crepe is by no way anything special or "French". The side "salad" was a few pieces of droopy lettuce. The waiter screwed up both our drink orders and the entrees. At this point with the confused look on his face, there was no point in pointing out the error as it would only lengthen our misery!  We just wanted out!!When we asked questions about the menu and the specials, the waiter had no idea and would go behind the counter to ask. A shrug of the shoulder and confused look were common with all the employees here. Too bad...we had such high hopes for this place, but will definitely not be returning.
2013-12-30,3,This is by far the most adorable brunch place I have been to yet. I was wondering why such a cute little brunch place would have such a low rating. I had a hunch that got confirmed as soon as I took the first bite of my food. No matter how cute the place is, the food really breaks it. FOOD - Eggs benedict mushroom with bacon: The eggs laid atop spinach, mushrooms, bacon (you also have a choice of ham), and brioche buns, with salad and fried potatoes on the side. While I liked that they tried to make the meal healthier by adding greens (and I actually really like spinach), the spinach made the buns and bacon pretty soggy. Not only that, but my plate was not warm; it was room temperature, as if the dish had been sitting out for a while. At least the eggs were cooked well, but I ended up just eating them alone. - Oven baked spicy tomato with eggs (forgot exact name): Was tasty, but nothing too special. The waitress pointed out that she really likes this dish though.DRINKS - While the food needs improvement, the mocha was great! It was more chocolate than expresso heavy--just how I like it. It basically tastes like hot chocolate, with a hint of expresso. Sadly, they don't do pretty designs on your hot drinks. - The orange juice tasted just like Tropicana. I doubt it was fresh-squeezed, which is something that I really like having at brunch. - FYI: I saw a sign that said BYOB, in case you are interested in alcoholic brunches.ATMOSPHEREI repeat: a-dore-a-ble. There are a lot of sofa seating with colorful seat cushions. Definitely a place to go to with girlfriends. If you bring a party, they will set up a nice spot in the window corner for your group. I would love to come here again and again--if only the food was a bit better.
2013-12-22,1,This place has a lot of charm, but the food is horrible. Don't take the crepes, they use the same paste to do the salty crepes and the sweet crepes. The result is horrible... Their crepes have no flavour, no taste, nothing and their mushrooms are the worst I had in years. It is definitelly not owned by french tenants. It sounds french, looks french but tastes microwaved.
2013-11-23,4,Great neighborhood breakfast spot. Family run, super friendly, and super quick service. Interesting take on eggs Benedict's by adding mushrooms and spinach on all of them, and some pretty good potatoes. Big portions too.
2013-11-12,4,I loved this place. First of all, it's so cute! We just happened to stumble upon this little French cafe when walking around Hoboken. I ordered a crepe and my husband ordered an omelette. The crepe was very good! Not recommended for someone who doesn't like something too sweet in the morning, but I really enjoyed it. It was like dessert for breakfast. Yum! While I thoroughly enjoyed my crepe, I just loved my husband's omelette. I can honestly say that it was one of the best omelettes I have every tried. Made me wish I had ordered that instead. Oh well, maybe next time. Service was a little slow, but our waitress was sweet. I do hope we stop by again when we're in the area.
2013-11-10,3,For the coffees alone you need to go to this place. They are served to perfection: Not too hot, not too sweet, and mesmerizing to look at as they are served in clear cups. For food, I got the French Toast (had a craving) and for an app got the Pear Crostini. I would not recommend either. Their bread is waay to tough and portion sizes for these sweet plates are waay to big, imo. Especially for the Crostini, it looked like the french toast which I did not expect. Will need to go back and try their crepes since those looked pretty decent. Atmosphere was nice, but not suited for solo eaters.
2013-11-08,2,I really want to love this place - great location, cute interior, great outdoor seating...but that's where it ends.  The food is just bland.  I was not impressed with their granola/fruit/honey (honey is a kraft packet?), and their eggs are microwaved.  If I'm paying these prices, I expect some real cooked food.
2013-10-01,3,I'm a sucker for cute little French cafés. They embody so many of the things I love about eating out. I've walked past La Bouche many a'time while on my way to Luca Brassi's and I always think "Hmmm, I should try them.". Well yesterday, I did. Went here on my lunch break. What I found:The inside was as cute as the outside; I appreciated the accent decor of antique-y teapots on top of the counter. My waitress was very sweet, though not super attentive; particularly given the small amount of people (just 2, including me). I ordered the lemonade & chicken panini (with no olives) and waited what I thought was way too long for the lemonade. I watched the waitress do all kinds of things behind the counter while I waited, looking directly into the fridge at the carafe of lemonade. Then she finally finished her activities and brought me the lemonade; it was delicious! It tasted fresh and a little more sour and sweet than most lemonade...which I love. I was initially very excited when I received my panini (which also took awhile). It looked and smelled delicious. My first bite was so satisfying! Chicken, tomato, stringy mozzarella and yummy pesto. I felt I had made the right lunch choice! Then I took my 2nd bite...where's the chicken?! I, then, inspected the sandwich, only to find 3 or 4 more chunks of chicken sprinkled throughout. Color me disappointed. The second half was the same. Also noted: the tomato was cut a little too thick and there was way too much of it. For $11, I certainly expected more chicken in my "chicken panini".Everything took a little too long for me to try the coffee without being late back to work. Perhaps another day....or not. :/
2013-09-04,5,Came here for brunch the other day and was surprised by how good it was. My sister and I shared the smoked salmon eggs benedict, which came on a brioche bun with spinach and mushrooms, and salad and fried potatoes on the side. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the whole dish was put together very well.We also shared the goaty panini, which was excellent. I love goat cheese so that definitely helped but all the ingredients complemented each other perfect. The turkey was savory, the prosciutto and cheese salty, and the apricot preserves and peach sweet. My fiance had the chicken sandwich, which was very good. The ingredients list for it did not include olives, but the sandwich came with them, which was a nice touch.My only complaint would be with the peach macaron that I got for dessert, which wasn't terrible but perhaps a little stale.
2013-08-15,4,What a wonderful place for a relaxing Sunday morning brunch. Situated at the base of the prettiest street in Hoboken.Salmon omelet was divine. Puffy eggs and creamy cheese, with fresh potatoes and undressed greens to cut the salt. Perfect! Forgetful but lovely staff. A very pleasant experience.
2013-08-07,4,Some friends and I went here for lunch. I had the chicken panini, and they had the Niçoise salad and a chicken pear salad. All dishes were presented beautifully, and everyone was satisfied with their meal. I also ordered a small macchiato, which was delicious as well. They give you a little side of bread with rosemary and red pepper flake olive oil, which is a nice touch. The cafe is very shabby chic. Comfortable bench seats and vintage looking tables and chairs. There is also outside seating. The servers were very pleasant, and they didn't rush us out of there as soon as we were finished eating. I get the impression that many people order something and can spend hours in there. It's only about two block from my apartment, so I will definitely be back!
2013-07-30,4,I just like saying the name (or trying to say the name) of this place....This review isn't very comprehensive, since I haven't had much here.  However, my experience has been generally good.  The tables outside are very nice and inviting. Coffee is tasty and the croissants are very good.  Don't quote me on this, but I think they get their pastries from Balthazar in NYC.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's just a little different than other bakeries in town (ex. Chocopain bakes their own stuff).In any case, La Bouche is good.
2013-05-22,4,friendly service.  cozy.  adorable place decorated on a low budget which gives it character. .  food is all fresh and delicious.
2013-05-17,4,They import pastries from Balthazar and Bouchon. They had me there. I envision having brunch here every Saturday after walking my pet pig. We'd order the eggs benedict with salmon and mushrooms. Or on a hot summer afternoon, a cold homemade lemonade. People-watch while sitting in one of the cute tables outside, sipping a glass of iced latte. I've had all the above + one of the chicken paninis. Quality food. Charming ambience. Friendly staff. I'll most definitely return to try the rest of the menu.
2013-05-06,1,Tried it three times and always the same. Slow as can be, overwhelmed 1-2 max waitresses. 2/3 times my coffee arrived at the same time as my food 30 minutes after ordering and even after. I like the look of the place and menu, but service falls far below par, especially in such a competitive market like Hoboken.
2013-04-09,3,Dined here this past weekend for Brunch since our usual spot had a long wait...Gotta love the vibe and the atmosphere in here...We tried the Meat/Cheese platter - very good (They were kind enough to do a 50/50 instead of having to order 2 platters) I tried the Salmon Eggs Benedict with Mushrooms and Spinach - It was good but lacked a bit of flavor in my opinion...(Elysian Cafe still has my fav version of this dish) The others on the table tried the Greek Omelette, Croissant SW and the Savory Crepe with Eggs in it. Everything was good except the Crepe which was very dry but they were very kind enough to replace it with another eggs Benedict. They serve some strong coffee too which I was a fan of..We ended the meal with some of their massive looking Macrons (I tried the Chocolate version, it was yum) I wonder if these are done in house or are Balthazar/Bouchon Imports like many of their breads...
2013-03-21,4,I love the decor in here.. I wouldn't have expected such a cutesy place on the corner of Garden street. I was quite surprised when I entered in and found it to be quaint with all the colorful throws and pillows.. The place is not so big but is worth the wait. They had some desserts from Balthazar bakery that I took along with some coffee to-go for a post lunch treat at my desk!
2013-02-05,3,Okay, so I finally tried this spot out for lunch.  It's cute and tiny with decent service but the food left much to be desired.  I went solely to try their white onion soup.  Whoa, hold up.  What did I just eat?  It was a gross gloppy mess. Yes, you read that right.  Gloppy.  I hate peppercorn.  Hate.  And yes, it's in there.  There were cold spots.  They obviously nuked it. That was what finally killed it for me.  French cafe with terrible onion soup?  No thanks.  Next!Prosciutto Panini - It was just okay but my partner liked it.  Maybe the prosciutto was too thick.  It came with a little side sald.  Yes, it was disgusting.  Some of the leaves were brown and wilted.  Bland and gross. All you need is some fresh lettuce and good olive oil to keep us happy.Pastries are solid because they outsource them from Bouchon Bakery and Balthazar.Coffee was excellent.  Will not be back to dine here but may stop in for some coffee.
2012-12-24,4,The place is very cozy, cute and charming.Their omelette is delicious.However because the room is limited, there's high possibility that one should wait.
2012-11-28,4,Update: Love this place.  I've been back twice.  I have sat inside and outside.  Both times the service was slow and sometimes they forget small things, but the food is great and the atmosphere is like a French cafe.  Big fan.
2012-11-06,3,What untapped potential. There are so many little details that would make this place so much better. The staff is really nice, but really slow. The place is cozy, but staff can be very neglectful of their customers which totally cancels out some of its charm. I'll definitely come back again with the hopes they get their act better together.
2012-11-03,1,Crap.  Went here after Hurricane Sandy. Paid $8 for an egg sandwich on whole wheat toast.  Unfortunately, I went here because only they and Anthony David's were open and I live downtown.  The sandwich was really crappy and I can only suppose they gouged the sandwich price since nobody would consistently pay that price for the low quality product.  Will never go here again.  Walking 8 blocks for breakfast tomorrow...
2012-10-16,4,Admittingley this was our second choice in the neighborhood. Supposecthat at noon on a friday most downtown restaurants in downtown Hoboken will be steady. First things first, 7 tables in a warm and cozy shop, clean your tables the moment your guests leave. You do not have the luxury of lots of tables ... keep it tight. That being said, it appears that their are only two or three staff members (we only saw two but they could be stashing someone else away). The decor is busy and frenetic but with clear choices regarding style. Location and space wise, this is perfect and the sounds of jazz really being a strong pulse to the room. The better half opted for a bowl of Lentil soup and a Miss Piggy Panini for myself. Second thing, be aware of your ingredients. If you serve bread crumbs with an item and know that the guest can not consume dairy be knowledgeable of the contents of said breadcrumbs. Now all of ghis being said, we both eventually enjoyed our meals. The prosciutto on my panini could have been much thinner but I am biased due to my salumeria past ... as for the lentil soup, delicious. A hint of spice sue the generous pinch of pepper and a subtle creaminess even without dairy. They appear to be doing a nice thing here at La Bouche. We are likely to return.
2012-10-04,3,Omelette was very good, pumpkin latte was pretty good, the service was very slow.I'd go back, but it's not my top brunch spot in Hoboken.
2012-09-04,2,I WANTED to love this place.. but in retrospect, just ok. Frankly, the food was somewhat unmemorable and service was quite poor. Or maybe the service was poor enough to make the food unmemorable. At any rate, it seemed like the server was blatantly ignoring us at some points; they double-charged my card and weren't prompt to fix it. Maybe it was an off-day.For someone in visiting, I don't know that this is the place to go. For anyone in the area, its a nice change to some of the more standard brunch options. Maybe they'll sort their service issues as time goes on. I'll be curious to see how they end up doing through the year as outdoor seating closes out.
2012-08-07,5,I really love this place. I have been here twice, both times alone, and I enjoy sitting in this cozy cafe with the lovely French-inspired atmosphere. Great interior decorating and props. I plan on introducing friends to La Bouche and coming more often. The food is really good, I haven't gotten a drink here. I've really enjoyed the Goaty Panini, which pairs up prosciutto, turkey, goat cheese, apricot preserves, and peaches. The flavor combination was excellent. They also have macarons; today I had a coconut lime one. Service is friendly. I plan on trying more items from their menu, especially for brunch and other sandwiches and paninis. Thanks La Bouche!
2012-06-13,2,I came to this cafe looking for a quaint place to have brunch with my girl friends. I live uptown and had passed the place a couple times and checked out the menu before. I was really impressed by the menu-- there were all the classic breakfast items like eggs, omelets and Belgian waffles-- they even had sweet and savory crepes. I was excited for what seemed like a European-style menu (I mean it was called La Bouche, we felt like we were going to a delicious French place).'We were disappointed to say the least.  The food just...wasn't good. I have made simple omelets at home that were light years better than their omelet's. It's an omelet for cryin' out loud,  it's not that hard.  Two of us had omelets-- I ordered a mushroom and cheese (with egg whites) which I asked for with spinach. I got a mixed vegetable omelet with no cheese and it was not made of egg whites.  That's fine-- there's nothing bad about a mixed veggie omelets.  Except for the fact that the omelet looked more like terrible, grey scrambled eggs in the shape of an omelet.  Fine again-- looks can be deceiving.  So I ate it. It tasted really bad. It just tasted like very poorly done eggs (almost under cooked), and there was no seasoning (like they forgot salt and pepper). I tried to finish it but physically could not (neither did my friends).My friends ordered a Chorizo and cheese omelet (sounds awesome right??) and sausage crepes.  The eggs were the same as mine, strangely scrambled, and the color was neon orange. We were all very confused.  The crepes seemed like they would be the winner, but they looked like they were made by someone who had never seen a crepe before in their life.  And validated by the friend who had them-- they were nothing special and extremely greasy--Just like the sides of potato we all had that were extremely bland!BOTTOM LINE: The menu looks like it would be great place to have a leisurely brunch, but it's not! I never write reviews, but I felt I had to share this since the disparity from what I expected for downtown Hoboken, and what I actually had were so incredibly disparate. I could think of giving it 3 stars I GUESS, since the food didn't have dead insects or something in it, but that would be generous. Not only that they got my order wrong and the service was, EH. Don't support terrible food that has a front of being good because of --just make some eggs at home or go to a diner.
2012-06-04,3,Mehh.. Sunday morning we ended up here for brunch. The lemonade was the highlight! We sat outside on a sunny day, great! but the table is tiny, very unstable and has enough gaps to drop the cutlery through them. Chairs very pretty unstable too, not very confi. I had the prosciutto panini which was pretty average.Service was good.
2012-05-19,4,Adorable cafe. Reminds me of little places in Paris. I had the smoked salmon omelet, which was delish. Only negative was the slowish service.
2012-05-09,4,Some mornings I just need a greasy bacon egg and cheese on a roll, but for mornings I want a slightly classier option, I think I've found my place.  The egg sandwich on a croissant was highly recommended so I went with that.  I opted for cheese and bacon as well.  The eggs were scrambled and perfectly fluffy with the cheese mixed in.  The croissant was buttery and fresh.  The only real fault to the sandwich was the bacon was not much to speak of-- very thin and almost...fake.  But I was able to overlook that since the rest of it was delicious.  The iced latte was large and good too.  This isn't a cheap breakfast, in total it ran me about $15, but totally worth splurging on occasionally!The place is cute, the service is a little slow but friendly, and they do have outdoor tables too.
2012-05-09,3,I love the ambiance of this place, I really do. A whole in the wall, vintage type French place with some outside seating and chill music and free wifi. I came for lunch and my neighbor diner had the egg and cheese sandwich that looked unreal but, I went with the $9 salad with chicken and a diet coke. First the little bottle of diet coke cost $2.50 WTF. Really? My salad with grilled chicken didn't cut it. The chicken seemed like the frozen microwaveable kind and really just wasn't good at all and the bed of mixed greens were decent, definitely from the bag. Overall not worth the $9 price tag. The highlight of the meal was the delicious bread they served the salad with. A cut up, toasted baguette with olive oil on the side. I ate that and enjoyed that but, forking over $15 wasn't my idea of a good time. I do want to say that I did not try the coffee or the sandwiches/croissants so they maybe amazing but, definitely wouldn't come back for that salad.
2012-03-11,4,Automatic 5 stars -  because this place shares a name with one of the greatest one-hit-wonders of all time. Deducted a star for service - I thought everything was generally pretty slow. Also deducted a star because my panini had only a little bit of meat/cheese/spinach on it. I was hoping for a bit more. It tasted good, but it was a bit weak for a panini. I did, however, try my friend's iced hot chocolate - AMAZING! It was my first taste of this chocolatey goodness and I absolutely love it now. Adding one star back on for cute decor and comfy seating. Great local spot for breakfast - stick to eggs or something like that.
2012-01-22,4,I think this place needs to figure out the service delivery.  Getting an espresso drink seems to take forever.  Food seems to come out right on time.  Getting a check or a follow up to see if you need anything... that will take a lot longer. However, their menu is super cute, food is good. Treats are delicious... their macaroons are excellent - delicious and light.
2011-12-29,3,Recently ate lunch here.  It had a great atmosphere and very friendly staff.  Coffees were delicious.  The food however was mediocre,  ingredients were not fresh, i.e. precooked processed chicken/canned fruit.
2011-12-09,4,As far as decor, I love this place. If looking for a small, light breakfast, this could be the spot. I think it's cute but it's not a regular spot for me. Do not go with a large group. Preferably for a couple, 3-4 at most.
2011-11-15,4,This place has improved a lot since it opened. I'm actually not a big coffee drinker (only iced mochas for me), so I'm glad they've started stocking a good selection of Yogi teas. Food is solid.Not sure why it's not listed as kid-friendly - it's stroller central around here. Staff is friendly with kids, too. It can get loud, so headphones are a good idea if you're coming in to get some work done.
2011-09-24,3,The place looks very cute + the food looks good. But to charge $3 for a small LIPTON Green Tea is ridiculous. Please get better tea if you are going to charge that much.
2011-09-23,2,My wife and I spent the weekend in Hoboken, and read the reviews so decided on breakfast here.  Very small and cozy place, made us feel very comfortable.  There were about 5-6 workers behind the counter, not really sure what they were all doing, but only one waitress, who seemed overwhelmed.  She could have used a hand from somebody else, but none of her coworkers jumped in.  It took about 10 minutes to even take our order, coffee and omelets for each of us.She delivered some sliced bread with dipping oil while we waited.  Coffee was delivered after a bit, and it was fine.  Then the omelets showed up another ten minutes later.  My coffee was done, and she did not even stop long enough to ask if I wanted a refill.  Now this place is small enough that you can almost shake hands from your table with just about everybody else in the place.  But with that, nobody was checking on the customers.  The waitress had to do everything, including cleaning the tables.The omelets looked like they were made from quail eggs, not chicken eggs.  This was the smallest omelet either of us has ever seen, and it only had some greens on the plate, no potatoes or anything else.  They tasted fine but we had to ask for more bread just to make it a more filling meal.  That was the last attention we had from the waitress.  I even had to go up to the counter to ask for our check.Leaving still hungry, and both of us needed another cup for coffee, we went up to Washington and stopped at the German bakery around 5th or 6th.  Had GREAT coffee, and Something else to eat.So, LaBouche is ok for cozy conversation, but that is really all I would recommend here.
2011-08-21,2,The place is cute, and good music (instrumental jazz), but they need to work on their coffee.  I ordered an iced coffee (not rocket science), and I took two sips.  It watery, flavor-less, and not nearly as flavorful as it should be.  At $2.50 for an ice-filled regular-sized glass, I would have hoped for more.I see that they've gotten good reviews for their food, but I'm skeptical of places that don't have the basics of coffee down-pat.Can't wait to find a high-quality, locallly-owned coffee shop with a good study atmosphere so I can stop selling out at Starbucks.  Alas, that's where I'm headed as soon as I'm paying for my un-touched iced coffee.
2011-08-17,5,I just had lunch at this place for the first time and I am so in love with it!  It's cute, cozy and just a little bit NYC trendy.I had the Goaty Panini (turkey, goat cheese, apricot preserves, peaches). The turkey meat wasn't your standard deli-sliced turkey--it was think cut and probably cooked there. In any case it was delicious. The flavors worked really well together. I also had a cup of coffee and it was very good.What I like so much about this place is that it's different from the standard Hoboken fare. It's the kind of place that you can go to by yourself and read a paper. The decor is cute and comfortable. And the food (omelettes, crepes, etc.) is exactly what you want it to be--well priced, interesting,  simple, yet creative.This is a perfect place to meet friends for brunch. Please go here! This is the kind of place that needs to stick around.
2011-08-16,5,Potentially my new favorite restaurant in Hoboken: La Bouche, 1st & Garden. Awesome-looking panini & omelets with creative & tempting flavor combinations; so far, I've only tried the strong coffee & authentic French pastries. Yum!
2011-07-31,5,I love this cute and charming cafe so close to my apt.  Sorry, Dames, La Bouche could easily become my new favorite coffee place.  The decor is lovely, the service is so friendly, the food is good and the coffee is great!  One could sit there for hours just chilling on a lazy Sunday.  Bonus: Free wifi.  I'm so glad they're here because I've been looking for a cafe like this!  I almost want to keep this place a secret...
2011-07-31,4,Great new coffee place with French charm. Cozy outdoor and indoor seating (gotta love the pillows). Good variety of food and drinks coupled with friendly service. Je ne regrette rien!
2011-07-18,4,This place is way more than just of coffee shop.  They have a well done menu that offers breakfast, salads and sandwiches.  I am definitely coming back here for brunch and bringing a bottle of bubbly since it is a BYOB.
2011-07-17,4,LOVE IT!  The decor is beautiful and very true to the French theme and the food was delicious.  I can personally recommend the banana and nutella crepes and the egg and bacon crossaint, but everything else that came out the kitchen looked good to.  I don't drink coffee, but my husband said that it was some of the best that he's had. Can't wait to go back!
2011-07-13,5,I'm still pleasantly wired from the delicious, fresh, strong cup of Cafe Americain from this delightful new French cafe. Not only is the coffee good and strong, but the Smoked Salmon & Cream Cheese Omelette w/ Dill is out of this world....so flavorful, delicate, delicious. It comes with Balthazar french bread and olive oil....seriously amazing. Charming space, very homey. Will surely return.
