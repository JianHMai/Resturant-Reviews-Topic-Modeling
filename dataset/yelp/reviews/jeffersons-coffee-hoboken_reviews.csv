2021-08-26,5,Love the iced coffee here! 1) happy that they offer regular iced coffee as so many small places like this have begun of offer only cold brew which I don't love. 2) hazelnut is my favorite and they do it well. Many places taste too sugary/syrupy but it's just right here! 3) very accommodating - one time I got home and realized my coffee was missing the hazelnut so I stuck it in the fridge to go back in the afternoon when I was going out anyway, and they apologized and gave me a whole new one.
2021-08-16,3,We love their coffee and food! However, the hours say they open at 7am and we have now had several instances of getting there after that time and it still being closed. Would love to give them business before heading to work, but always have to go elsewhere because no one is ever there on time.
2021-07-14,4,I love the cold brew and nitro here. Legit one of the best coffee around however the almond croissant was very disappointing and did not compliment my coffee at all. I wish their pastries were up to par like their coffee. Hell yeah to coffee, hell nah to croissant. Picture shown, is nitro. It's a must have.
2021-05-25,5,I grabbed Pistachio vanilla latte this morning here.I was studying eating it and I had to write comments!I appreciate this cafe has the coffee.There are a lot of options I can choose.It's only the place in Hoboken I can get Pistachio vanilla latte which is one of my favorite.I'm gonna try Lavender vanilla latte next time.Love you Jefferson!!
2020-11-19,5,My "Thank You Thursday" goes to Jefferson's Coffee. Very friendly service and great espresso.
2020-10-17,1,I'm at literal loss for words with this shop. I didn't think it was possible to be so disappointed with a simple order of two cold brews and a pumpkin spice latte. I came in on the basis of the good reviews expecting a great coffee and left with a cold brew that tasted like toothpaste and sugar. My friend literally thought we gave him a cup of pepsi. How is this place real? The pumpkin spice latte left a chalky taste in my mouth and had...zero pumpkin. Amazing. I would probably be more satisfied getting gas station coffee.
2020-10-12,4,Great coffee, strong and delicious. Being particular but just wish they offered more savory food items lolll but really enjoyed their zucchini cake and banana bread also!
2020-04-18,5,I've been coming here since the COVID-19 stay in place for some coffee. They are open for take out, great coffee great people here. I recommend !!
2020-02-16,5,My go-to weekend coffee spot. Friendly staff, serving up consistently good lattes. I also like their iced coffee in the summer (bonus points for caring about the environment and offering paper straws).
2020-01-12,5,Nice people working there.  Always good coffee.  Lattes always have the right ratio of milk and coffee goodness for me!
2020-01-04,3,The coffee here is usually good. Inconsistent though. They will change the coffee beans on you and not tell you lol. Different flavors. Some of the sugar free flavor options are nice but very light in taste, as in you can't even tell some of them are in your coffee.I like the matcha latte here. I also like that they have dairy free alternatives including macadamia nut milk! Just a little costly. Customer service is usually pretty good. If there's a line you're going to wait since it's one person making all the drinks. They have some snacks available too and sometimes free samples.
2019-11-21,5,This is such a cozy spot. I was just looking for a cute place to get good coffee and stumbled upon this place! The place is small with two tables and a little spot with two comfy chairs but the place seemed homie. I had been on a hunt for a place where they have good coffee. I had a latte and it was good. It wasn't mind blowing but it was pretty good! The staff that helped me was friendly. But I would definitely go back!
2019-08-11,5,Excellent coffee.  Really nice staff.  Ability to sit indoors and outdoors.  There's nothing not to like about this place.  I just went here twice in the last week for coffee.  Both times my drink was expertly made (I only had to tell them once, despite my requests/customizations, and it was dead on both times).  The second time we came (earlier today) they had huge samples out (like a 4th of an almond or chocolate croissant), which were super good.My favorite thing is that they have cape cod chairs outdoors so you can chill and sit underneath the trees on a nice day!
2019-05-18,4,My weekend spot for hot brew! Their local brew is really good, I like the 10th and Madison spot more than the Washington Street. Their cold mocha is ok! I would recommend this place for a hot cuppa of coffee and chat with friends.
2018-10-23,5,Great coffee, yummy snacks, and basically designed for you to comfortably set up shop and get some work done. As I recently started working from home more, Jefferson's has quickly become my favorite place to bring my laptop and actually do work. They only have three tables but they have extension cords between each seat so you don't have to awkwardly run your chargers under someone else's feet. I've gone several times and, although there isn't a tone of seating, there has always been a table available. It might just be because they are a pretty out of the way coffee shop. While most people will walk over to one of the more popular places on 1st St or Washington Ave, I've loved being one of the only people in this tiny little shop all the way down on 10th and Madison.Their coffee is delicious and pretty affordable for Hoboken at only $3 for a large cup of either hot or cold. I've had both their hot coffee and their cold brew and I'd vouch for either. Their snacks range from fresh fruit to banana bread to gluten free treats. They even have different kinds of candies like green tea kit kats (my weakness). It's a small little shop but it does the trick whether you are looking for a place to hang out at for awhile or are just looking for a pick me up on your walk home.
2018-10-10,5,One of my favorite coffee places in Hoboken! Love the variety of coffees and pastries. The baristas are always so friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. Also their prices are incredibly reasonable! Highly recommend!
2018-09-06,4,This place has great coffee and the friendliest baristas. I'm taking one star off because I've tried to go a few times and they've been closed. Stay open longer! :)
2018-07-21,4,Please bring back the non-paper straws. I have to waste half of my coffee when using these straws because they get so soggy, break, and then no longer work.  Or at least have the option of both.
2018-04-14,5,Great service, coffee, and general vibe. We had an Americano, a cappuccino, and split a slice of walnut zucchini bread. All were perfect. I am so picky with my coffee. This is my daily stop from now on. Nice design, perfect team. Thank you guys!
2018-03-13,1,I doubt the Owner know that his lazy employees close early most of the time. We try to go and have a hot cocoa and there's usually a sign taped to door that says "we are closing early today". I ask "why" and the girls always say "just because". Done with this place. There are plenty of other options in Hoboken.
2018-03-11,5,The hot coffee is only $2 and almost as good as those coffee roasters in nyc. It's pretty decent coffee shop in Hoboken. I would visited the new coffee shop on Washington Street three times and they never let me down.
2018-03-03,5,Fantastic coffee, friendly staff and great place to hang out. They've opened a new location on Washington Street and glad to see they are expanding.
2017-11-22,5,Solid coffee shop in a part of town that doesn't have a lot of gourmet coffee shop options. It's a place that'll craft your drink with care. This isn't Starbucks, so don't expect to walk in and walk out immediately. But, somehow, you're okay with that. It's about the quality of drink you're going to get. If you are in a rush you can always pay and grab a regular coffee. Which is always a good roast as well. Not many food options but that's not why you come here. Croissants, cookies and assorted pastries and a cup of coffee are a great way to start the day if you're in this neck of the woods in Hoboken.
2017-11-11,5,Great place. They have their own brand and amazing coffee. Nice place for coffee freaks as I am.
2017-11-11,5,I came this place on a Saturday afternoon. Friendly staff and peaceful atmosphere make me feel like I'm home. The place is great for studying or reading a book. I really liked the mucus they play and Kafette is my favorite coffee here.
2017-11-10,4,I grab my coffee here a few times a week and the coffee is good, not great and a bit over priced but the staff are friendly.
2017-10-17,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I went here every day since they opened, if you love coffee, this is the place to go to.  The cold brew, lattes, and teas are all amazing. The pastries and cookies are all super fresh and very tasty.  The baristas and the owners are all very friendly.  The decor is very nice plus outdoor seating is great. I can't say enough great things about this place! A morning (and afternoon) ritual. Five stars to have you guys in the neighborhood. Thank you!
2017-10-15,1,I went there around 8am. The service was rude and the coffee was overpriced -the self serve -large coffee from the pot was $3.. not warm enough.. very disappointing I just updated my review on google after I got the comment from this place saying I wasn't there not on the camera which is completely a lie.Please do not go if you want to have a good cup of coffee without drama.
2017-10-10,5,Such a friendly staff and a peaceful atmosphere. Incredibly perfect coffee! The atmosphere is really chill and this is a great place to recharge your batteries, awesome hot/ice latte! Really one of the best places for coffee. Prices are reasonable. Over all a nice ambiance & GOOD coffee!!
2017-09-29,1,I'm not sure if I just stopped in on a bad day today but the coffee was horrendous.  It is way overpriced at $3.00 for a 16oz cup to begin with, but it was particularly bad due to it being very weak and lukewarm.  To top the whole underwhelming experience off,  it was completely self service like you would find in any run of the mill bagel shop, Quick Check or NY corner deli just minus the good tasting coffee.  That is all.
2017-07-28,1,3 times in a row the joint was closed during regular business hours. With the lack of good coffee shops out here, it would be nice to have a place open when they're supposed to be.
2017-06-26,1,Do not patronize. They allow dogs into the shop. Clear violation of health code. June 26th two dogs were allowed in and remained inside while their owners were served. 4pm and 4:20pm.
2017-06-26,4,If I lived near here it would be a no brainier. Nothing special but seating inside which is nice. Guy working the counter seemed a little spastic but I think he just wanted to do a good job.
2017-05-30,4,In hidden spots throughout Hoboken you'll find good coffee spots that only a coffee drinker can appreciate. While chain stores like Starbucks and DD are always reliable if given the opportunity why wouldn't you want to support a local business that specializes in all things good coffee. Located on the corner of Madison St. across from Shoprite you'll find this great coffee spot. The theme (if you didn't catch it already) is inspired by Thomas Jefferson. Inside you'll find about 3-4 tables to sit, relax, and catch up on some reading while examining some of the Jefferson memorabilia stuff they have to offer. For regular cups of coffee it is self serve. You can find all the necessary add-ons such as milk and creams in the fridge near the sugar etc. If you're a latte person like myself you can get yourself a hot/iced nice size cup for $4.50 ($5 for a large). Every time I've come I have never been disappointed in my brew. I may slightly be sometimes when I don't get to the fresh baked goodies (limited supply) they have daily but the good tasting latte makes up for it. Add Jefferson's to your local coffee spot and I promise you won't regret it!
2017-03-21,5,So glad they moved into the neighborhood! jefferson's coffee is a fantastic local shop. They have a wide variety of teas and coffees - I'd recommend the iced matcha latte. They also serve pastries from various bakeries in the NYC area - the donuts are to die for. The staff is always super friendly and open to chat about their recommendations. Stop by if you are in the neighborhood, or need to decompress after visiting the Shop Rite across the street!
2017-02-14,3,Great for a cup of coffee if you're around the corner. However, the service can be extremely slow so I wouldn't advise heading here before work or if you're in a rush!
2017-01-23,4,Nothing much to say, had a hot latte, it was pretty good.  There donuts looked great, had a lot of different drinks in frig.
2016-11-26,5,Make sure to try Galapagos  Island coffee! Amazing! Cozy, friendly coffee shop. The owners are friendly and they know coffee!
2016-11-25,4,This amazing lil coffeshop on the corner across the street of shoprite is a perfect place to unwind and have an amazing cappuccino or coffee. I had lemonade in a small container while my sugarbumps enjoyed her cappuccino and ESPICIALLY enjoyed beating me twice in her favorite game LOTERIA ughhhhh....the reason this gets 4 stars is that the place is real small but the counter guy was a cool cat...i recommend u come here!!!
2016-11-25,4,A chill place across shoprite to relax and have a cappichino. The place is inviting and quiet.
2016-09-20,3,I like this place but when I see dogs sitting on benches that's when I stop coming. I like pets but seriously the belong outside or at lease on the floor inside and better be well trained. The owners obviously don't say anything so be warn, you could be sitting where a dog just licked itself. Hope some of you are not allergic to dogs. This whole "service dog" to me has gotten out of hand. Well, sorry but I'll go to places where it's clear NO DOGS ALLOWED"
2016-09-14,4,If you're like me and mostly interested in a good cup of coffee, then Jefferson's Coffee is worth a visit. Their small java is $2 and it is delicious! Always two varieties to choose from each morning. The staff is always smiling and friendly. The space is ok, some small tables and chairs. A couple of outdoor seats are there for nice days.  The food offerings are limited, mostly croissants and muffins.
2016-09-13,4,Really good coffee and big unique flavored of home made donuts. Yummy Will be my new it spot
2016-06-04,5,I've been here twice so far and both times my experience has been great. The first time with some friends and the barista was really helpful and recommended  a chai latte because one of my friends does not like coffee. The second time I went, they had really good Guatemalan coffee. You should stop in if you have the chance.
2016-05-02,4,The coffee and service is GREAT.  They have wifi and it always works well- not many outlets and not a lot of seating but i've never had an issue getting a seat as most people get their coffee to go.  I'm sure they will be much busier soon as this place has the best coffee I've had in Hoboken so far.
2016-05-01,5,One of the best coffee shops I've been to for a while, their coffee tastes amazing; they have organic coffee, which is very rare in this neighborhood. The owners were very friendly, we've had a long talk about coffee. After discovering this place, you'll never wanna go to Starbucks again.
2016-04-15,4,After a few less than stellar trips, things have really turned around. Prices are in line with the rest of Hoboken and the product is quite good. Look forward to dropping by on morning walks. Enjoyed both the drip and the pour over, and would recommend both.
2016-04-04,5,Stopped in Sunday morning with my girlfriend, it was great seeing a new small business flourishing. The Cold Brew was tasty and I've never been a fan, the espresso was also good and not bitter which is appreciated. We might have to make this a Sunday tradition before Shoprite.
2016-04-03,5,Had my Rwanda coffee today. Wonderful coffee store. Convenient after shopping. I love their oatmeal coffee.Jefferson's Coffee is my regular stop in the weekends.
2016-03-13,5,Best coffee store in Hoboken. Tiny, cutest spot with a nice decor. I had cappuccino, it was so nice. This is a great location after my kickboxing.I'll stop every weekend.
2016-03-06,5,Great coffee shop! Great environment with a family vibe. I really enjoyed my time there and the delicious spicy chai latte was a plus!
2016-03-05,5,I am glad to find a  coffee shop that roasts their own beans  with all organic beans. The young lady at Jeffersons told me that when the owners started roasting coffee back in the 1800's organic was the only way when their grand-grand -grand father first started this business!!!How cool is that!!!
2016-03-05,1,Really disappointing. Was excited for this place since it's only a few blocks away from my apartment. Unfortunately it's wildly overpriced compared to other places in the area. Went in shortly after they opened and I paid $10.10 for a 8oz pour over and a tea. Barista actually dumped some of the pour over out before filling an 8oz cup about three-quarters of the way despite me saying I didn't need room for milk. It actually confused me; I didn't know how to respond. Not entirely sure he knew what he was doing. Quality of the coffee was fine, but you can certainly find better coffee at a significantly better price at a number of places in Hoboken or The Heights.
2016-02-28,5,Jefferson's Coffee is a cozy, local coffee shop that offers all types of coffees and tea as well as gluten free pastries.  The barrister's were very attentive and pleasant.  The prices were comparable to other coffee shops in town.  The location is great since you can get a great coffee and then go do your shopping at Shoprite!  So glad Jefferson's Coffee opened up at the 1000 Jefferson St. apartment building!
2016-02-26,5,I finally had the chance to stop by Jefferson's Coffee today and, I LOVED IT! I went for the pour over since it's normally what I drink and am more familiar with when I'm in the city. I have to say, they definitely take their job seriously. The taste was fresh, rich, and carefully brewed. I noticed that a couple of other comments on here are not happy with the pricing. Honestly, I think that for the quality the pricing is reasonable. I go to many quality coffee shops in the city (even Brooklyn) and the price range is just about the same. This isn't Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, that for sure. This place seems to really value the culture of coffee beans and the science of brewing. I was really impressed and I can't wait to come back again. Best of luck to you all!
2016-02-23,5,Great Coffee Shop. My new favorite breakfast spot in hoboken. The baristas are super friendly, the service was excellent. Cannot wait to go back!!
2016-02-22,1,I have been waiting for this place to open up for months so when i passed by Sunday morning i was beyond thrilled to say the least. That all changed rather quickly. I walked in and it seemed like they had just recently opened but i didn't care i couldn't wait to have a coffee place so conveniently close. I ordered an iced coffee and they only had one size which is medium. I then went to pay and when she told me my iced coffee was $6.42 i thought there was a mistake.I asked if it was cold brew or sprinkled with some type of magic for that price when the woman pointed to some machine and told me this was scientifically cold brew. (with a tude). Oh excuse me! The coffee was mediocre at best and I will NOT be returning to those kinds of prices!
