2021-10-26,5,Not sure what they put into these cookies but the matcha cookie is the one to go for! Soft and crispy at the same time, perfect texture and not overly sweet. Loved every bite!Also they gave us our cookies for free for being the first customers ! +1 to them!
2021-10-01,5,My nose brought me to this shop. I smelled some delicious cookies being made and found out exactly where the smell was coming from! I decided to try out the confetti deluxe cookie because it looked fun and I wanted to try something other than a basic chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was so bomb!! It was warm and soft and chewy but the outside was slightly crispy. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet either. Can't wait to go back here and try more cookies.
2021-09-11,5,this place is amazing we get two cookies and they give it to us for free we tipped this place two days in a row when we went! they were fresh baked and perfect! they make everything soft too!
2021-08-24,4,Will I ever be here again, no! But, was it worth eating at this spot once? Yes, for sure. However, is it worth the long lines? No. I got the triple chocolate and the white chocolate macadamia cookies. Both were good. Also, just go to CVS which is open 24/7 for milk (I recommend the Fairlife milk). Don't buy their milk, not worth the price.
2021-08-14,5,Sinfully delicious! Warm and soft. Melting. You just can't pass this up. Got a delivery close to 1 am - arrived quickly.
2021-08-06,1,I want to give this place 0 stars but the other day I came here for the first time with my friend on a night out, there were only 5 people in the store but we waited in line for a good 45 mins. When it finally was our turn, the girl on register wasn't friendly at all and seeing that they close early morning, and it was only 10 pm on a Saturday, they were out of more than half of their cookies. I ordered a half dozen and moved over to the side to check my cookies. I open the box and all the cookies are raw and falling apart. I turn back to the girl at the register and asked if I can switch out my cookies since they were raw and she told me "We can't take back cookies that have left the store" I stared at her for a second to see if she was serious and told her I had been standing in the same spot the entire time.... And she just stared at me with a blank expression until I got annoyed and left. Never again! Wasted about $13I recommend y'all go to Baked Bear instead12/10
2021-07-17,1,So we went the other day for my sisters birthday, it was last Sunday around 10:30. We show up craving these "awesome" cookies we follow on our socials....they tell us, they're ONLY fulfilling online orders. Huh?! Mind you, online, they're marked as open until 1am! But people can only order on line after 10?! It was disappointing to say the least. I'm unfollowing the page & have no intention of speaking on these cookies ever again. Pillsbury, I'm back for good.
2021-07-17,1,Took two hours for delivery. I requested a refund from the manager right before it arrived.  Didn't receive refund even though I refused the order. Had to resolve through grub hub.
2021-07-09,5,The Vegan cookies are delicious! The staff was very knowledgeable about flavors and friendly! I will definitely be back.
2021-07-01,1,Horrible customer service. I ordered 2 cookies & one milk about 2 hours ago. It never came so I called the number they provided multiple times and can't get through to anyone. Will never order from them again. Be warned, they suck.
2021-06-24,1,Didnt receive part of my order and I called them about it and they said they would send it out. That was 50 minutes ago. Called again and they said whenever the delivery person gets back, he'll come out. Who wants to bet he even comes at all?
2021-06-05,1,Literally they move as slow as they possibly could. Is it that much of a process to heat up a cookie and put it in a fucking box?
2021-06-01,3,While the staff was nice, I placed an order 90 minutes in advance for pick up and the order was not ready on arrival. I had to wait another hour for the staff to make the cookies that were missing. That being said, the cookies were fall-apart-in-your-mouth soft after being out of the oven and sorta made the wait worthwhile.
2021-05-30,4,Insomnia Cookies is the reason I cut down Newark St even when I don't have to. Even when I don't stop I'm for cookies because all you have to do is walk by and you get a nose full of that fresh baked cookie smell and it is the hardest thing in the world to keep walking by. I've tried Insomnia a few times and they've always been a wonderful little treat! My fianceÃÅ brought a dozen of them home and they were gone before the next day and a grabbed a half dozen recently on the way to a friends. I ordered via Yelp and picked them up a few minutes later, easy peasy. They have a few different flavors to choose from but oh wow was the macadamia good. I recommend not only a walk by for a good smell, but a stop in if you are looking for something sweet and delicious. Open till 1am on weekends for those late night cookie cravings.
2021-05-29,1,Expect 2+ hour waits for delivery. 5th time I've ordered, 5th time I waited 2 hours. Place is a joke.
2021-05-07,2,They're alright but nothing special and just taste like regular cookies you could get at any grocery store, or even bake at home. Pretty overpriced for what they have to offer. 2 stars instead of 1 only because they were served warm and for the location since we could at least somewhat enjoy them with a nice view. Also the worker wasn't friendly at all and completely ruined my mood. She seemed like she dreaded working there and had no customer service skills whatsoever. A simple hello would've been nice but oh well I won't be returning here anyways.
2021-04-11,5,I used to go to this place all the time when I lived in Manhattan, so when I found out there was one in Jersey I was pretty excited.And I did not disappoint, fresh baked hot cookies all hours of the night. I wanted to try something different so I got an ice cream sandwich, with two chocolate chip cookies and strawberry cheesecake in the middle. Wow seriously one of the most delicious thing I've ever eaten! They have quite a few locations but if you're in the Hoboken area you should stop by.
2021-04-04,2,I haven't had Insomia cookies in so long. I remember loving the chocolate chip ones. My boyfriend surprised me with a cookie icing sandwich. They put white icing between two cookies. When we opened it up one cookie was WAY bigger than the other. It looked so weird. And he said the woman at the counter told him he had to pick two deluxe cookies for the sandwich so the sizes could be the same...well they were not. The cookies were overall way too sweet. The smores one tasted more like a triple chocolate cookie. The center was nice and soft and fudgey but the edges where too crisp. The peanut butter one tastes way to buttery and sugary like there was no balance in flavor at all. I definitely wouldn't get a frosting sandwich again. I did like the icing but with the cookies too it was just a hot sweetness mess. I do want to try the classic chocolate chip to see if its as good as I remember it.
2021-03-20,1,So tonight March 19 around 1:06 am I placed an order for pick up at 1:30,when I arrived I wasn't greeted, the young lady who was making my order made a HUGE stink that I asked for two different flavors of ice cream and went to the back of the store, to talk to the other young lady and young man I'm guessing the manager and talked about my order INFRONT of me not thinking I could hear. If there was an issue about two different flavors and paying more I gladly would have. But no instead the young lady taking my order didn't even ask me if I wanted two different flavors or discussed if I needed to pay more, she instead put all of one flavor. Not for nothing but I spent almost 11 dollars on it, it was just disrespectful. As well she asked the other young gentleman if she could put another cookie in my order, the other young gentleman grabbed the cookie out opened the box then said something along the lines of that sucks or tough luck. I mean seriously? OH AS WELL NO ONE WAS WEARING GLOVES ?? I did not see one person wash there hands, cross contamination, and With COVID? Seriously
2021-03-19,1,Delivery at this place is always a mess. You're lucky if you actually get your cookies 2 hours later.
2021-03-09,5,LOVEEE this spot! My favorite cookies are the classic and the mint double chocolate chip. All the flavors will definitely impress!
2021-03-06,1,Placed the order at 12:15am and the order was confirmed, however the delivery never came. I was charged $19.00 and gave a $2 tip. The rep from grubhub in the Philippines said the kids working there were picking up the phone and then hanging up. I tried calling the place, no luck. Customers nor Grubhub can communicate with this joint. No cookies.
2021-03-06,2,Today I visited Insomnia Cookies after a very long time. I ordered two Chocolate Chunk, two White Chocolate Macadamia, and two Double Chocolate Chunk. All the cookies were freshly baked and warm. If you're a chocolate fanatic, you must try the double chocolate chunk. It's a dark chocolate cookie with melting chunks of milk chocolate chips inside. However, this location has the worst customer service. The person at the register was rude and arrogant. The staff baking the cookies showed attitude and threw the cookies inside the box. I was very annoyed and felt disrespected.
2021-03-03,4,Picture this. It's a wednesday night, I'm sitting on the couch watching bachelor reruns... I click the "submit" button, and 8 minutes later there is a pile of 6 warm cookies at my door. Am I dreaming?The cookies arrived perfectly warm and just slightly underbaked (my favorite). I ordered the 6 pack with 2 m&m, 1 White chocolate, 1 confetti, and 2 choc chunk. If you don't like underbaked cookies I suppose you could warm them in the oven for about 5 minutes at 375 F. Delivery 10/10. Cookies 9/10 (knocking a star because of greasiness and price) Guilt 6/10.
2021-02-20,3,So overpriced. This has gotten tons of hype through social media & it's just not worth it. Candidly, the cookies at Subway are nearly as good!  The menu is exciting and the cookies look fun, but the quality isn't really there--ESPECIALLY for the outrageous price.
2021-02-08,4,Full transparency, I have not stepped foot into this insomnia location but I've ordered from them plenty of times.  Similar to many other establishments they have curbside pickup.  Like many other places in the area finding parking and going in to patronize can be challenging but if you are doing curbside pickup it's easy to circle until your order is ready for them to bring it out.The app online Is easy and I was able to find pretty good specials including buying a dozen and getting a dozen free.  This was my reward for losing the baby weight and weighing 10lbs less than I was pre-pregnancy.  It was a great treat!
2021-02-04,5,First time trying this location. Delivery was quick and cookies were hot and delicious! I was surprised they offered vegan cookies, and they tasted amazing.
2021-01-24,5,Great cookies and very friendly staff!! There was quite a wait though but that's due to COVID. Went around 10pm and there was a line going outside since they only allowed 3 people at a time inside. So if you're going late be sure to dress warm cause you will be waiting or just order online and walk inside and let them know you're picking up. Overall great cookies! Peanut butter and chocolate chunk always the best.
2021-01-20,4,Overall- good cookies, bad customer serviceFaves:chocolate chipwhite chocolate macadamia salted caramel (even though its a little pricier for being "deluxe")I love these cookies. They always taste fresh, and the flavors are amazing...goes great with a glass of milk!They also have ice cream, cookie cakes and other things if you're into that.My only complaint is the customer service! The girl at the cashier was kind of rushing me when I wanted to look through the menu and i could tell they were talking about me as I walked out. Other than the 2 min interaction, I'd still recommend you go get some amazing cookies and get on your way :)
2021-01-17,4,My girlfriend recently stopped by at Insomnia Cookies, and picked up a bunch of different cookies to try. We pretty much had at least one of every classic cookie style. I must say these cookies were excellent.  You can tell they were fresh and just baked, as all our cookie orders came out nice, hot, and soft.  My favorites were the chocolate chunk, double chocolate,  and peanut butter chip.  Although every cookie style was amazing. No complaints by me for any flavor. I was pleasantly surprised how great these cookie were. They were especially delicious enjoying them at home, with a glass of milk (or with some coffee). If your looking for some freshly baked, delicious cookies, this is the spot you want to stop by and grab yourself a variety six pack.
2021-01-11,5,Was having a tough day today, which is what happens when you're a healthcare provider during a pandemic. I walked in and ordered 2 chocolate chunk cookies and the man behind the counter told me the cookies were on him since I only ordered 2. I don't know if he could tell I was having a bad day or if he's just a genuinely nice person, but thank you. You brightened my day and I truly appreciated the gesture. Not to mention the cookies were delicious (obvs)! Please consider ordering from Insomnia Hoboken when you have a cookie craving! FYI bc I'm sure it will be asked - I made sure to tip!
2020-12-26,5,Me and my boy came to this establishment. And was so impressed by the customer service skills the staff had . With the well known reputation of Chick-fil-A. I complemented the staff generosity and service.
2020-12-21,2,absolute shit. I'd rather burn my mon y to Han fucking spend it on this garbage. Cuz it's absolute garbage food. Fuck all of you
2020-12-18,2,I ordered at 10. I got a notification that my cookies were out for delivery at 12 but nothing after that. I called at 12:30 and they said it was a busy night so I waited. Called again at 1:30 cause the tracker said deliver but they weren't there and there was no text message. Apparently the driver hit it by accident and I was told to wait. Called again at 2:30 and was told that the store closed at 1 so there was no way the driver was still out. Got a refund but I never got my cookies and was waiting for four hours.
2020-12-18,1,Ridiculously long delivery times and terrible costumer service. I waited over 3 hours for my order, and when I called to get a status update I was placed on hold for 5 minutes and hung up on. When my cookies finally did arrive, they were rock hard and weren't warm like I've received them when I ordered from other Insomnia Cookies locations.
2020-12-18,1,While the cookies are always fine, the service from this location has been horrible over the past 2+ years I've lived here. Of the past 5 orders I've placed, 4 have been incorrect (missing items/wrong items) and the wait times have been inaccurate and extremely long. I used to be a dedicated customer at a different location and no longer like to order Insomnia in Hoboken as I can assume my order will not be correct or it will come 2+ hours later.
2020-12-18,2,Cookies were OK, definitely under baked and too chewy for me... Not a problem if you're into that. Found a small piece of hair in my snickerdoodle cookie which was a total turn off.
2020-11-29,5,These cookies are underrated I've tried bang cookies and levain.. these are a nice simple warm classic cookie taste that will satisfy your sweet tooth .. I'm so surprised how good and fresh they were when I ordered them online and picked them up.. my favorite is the chocolate chip and white chocolate macadamia!
2020-11-08,3,Cookies are tasty.  Not much of a selection maybe bc they ran out of cookies. But most important the women cashier had major attitude.  Not very nice or welcoming.  I'll try a different location with better manners.
2020-10-25,5,I had the most wonderful experience at this insomnia cookie. My first time ever. Got 2 vegan cookies. Taste was amazing as well as the service. Great workers and great location. Will be returning!
2020-10-14,1,Doesn't even deserve a star tbh. Girls there were high as fuck, so unprofessional. They made us wait 40 mins and only when we got there they started my order. Let a man in without a mask just because they found him cute. Honestly, ew. Never again.
2020-09-30,1,I usually don't take the pains to write a review but I had a downright terrible experience today. I placed my order today at 11:pm and it was supposed to arrive ASAP. So I tried tracking the order on the site. But the tracking on the site doesn't work! I called customer service, they said my order was still being prepared and that I would get an email as soon as it was out of delivery. A couple more calls later at 12:45am, customer service said my order was out for delivery and they were trying to locate the driver. I called back after 15 mins, around 1 am and the customer service lady after taking forever tells me the store was closed! Let me tell you this is not an isolated incident and I have had a bad experience earlier too. My house is literally a 10 mins drive from the bakery and they managed to mess up my order completely. The worst is not knowing where your order is, EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL.I would strongly discourage people from ordering from this Insomnia, their delivery has never been worse!
2020-09-29,3,The cookies were good, staff was crappy. Weren't wearing masks, blasting music, gave us the wrong order...
2020-08-29,1,This location is horrible. Ordered online came on time and they told us its going to be another 15mins wait. After 15mins we went back in and the people there have no idea of what we ordered. They said its going to be another 30 minutes. They lied to us because its not made yet by the previous crew! After an 1 hour and 45 minutes the birthday cookie was done. DONE POORLY!  HALF WAS TOO HARD AND HALF WAS SOGGY CAUSE ITS HALF COOKED!!! This was my son's birthday cookie (birthday cake) that he asked for! NEVER AGAIN! EMPLOYEES DO NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR WORK! No integrity and too expensive for  cookies thats low quality!!!
2020-08-12,1,Horrible. Waited for 1 whole hour. They gave no reasoning as to why it takes that long to make a fresh batch of cookies.
2020-08-12,2,I've never really understood the rage of Insomnia Cookies.  I guess the selling points are that you can always get fresh cookies even late into the night?Like every other Insomnia Cookies location I have been to in NYC, there not much room for customers to dine in, the cookie flavors aren't imaginary (not that they need to be, but doesn't a cookie chain desire to have their own more unique content?), the cookies do come in a variety of sizes, and you can get one or a few so that's always nice depending on how many cookies your craving.  The staff seems to know what they're doing, but ultimately they aren't really trained to be outstanding service staff.  You can get a cookie or a dozen, you can get a cookie cake, or you can get an ice cream sandwich made with their cookies, or maybe just ice cream - but to be honest, they don't use any fancy ice cream either, seemed fairly generic to me. One perk is that you can choose two different cookies to sandwich your ice cream with.  So ultimately, yeah I'd go when I want a fresh cookie, but would I ever crave Insomnia Cookies or anything they have to offer?  The answer is ... no.
2020-07-26,1,Disgusting. The people in there don't bother wearing masks. Too busy being loud and talking to one another instead of taking orders.
2020-07-18,1,Ordered a box of cookies for delivery at 11:15 pm. No sign of cookies for two hours so I called their phone center at 1:30 am and the girl had to cancel my order because the shop had closed for the night. Horrible way to treat customers. I would've lost that money if I hadn't called them to ask about my order.
2020-07-17,1,Great cookies ...TERRIBLE customer service. Just a disgusting vibe from the young girl that took my order. Just terrible, the company needs to take notice on this issue.
2020-07-17,2,If you order delivery and it arrives, consider yourself lucky. Great cookies, but they need to figure out their delivery service.
2020-07-06,5,Have always walked by and never really ordered anything from there. This time we were looking for an ice cream spot during a quarantine afternoon whilst walking our dog and thisnpopped up on Yelp. So happy we stopped by for some cookies and ice cream. I had chocolate, mint for my husband and vanilla for our dog. An assortment of their cookies and it was an afternoon well spent. Staff was great.
2020-07-06,1,Ugh, should have read all the reviews before placing my order last night. Ordered 2 dozen cookies around 9:45 last night. 90 minutes later I called the "call center?" (This location doesnt even answer the phone it gets directed elsewhere) they were super accommodating when I asked to cancel the order. At 12:30 am (3 hours later?) I was rudely awakened by a screaming delivery man. When he handed me the cookies he replied "whats wrong you forgot about the cookies". 3 hours later & a rude delivery guy what a bummer.
2020-06-27,2,You have to know what you're getting yourself into here. When I ordered a half dozen cookies it was still light outside. It's now a phone call later and going on midnight, STILL NO COOKIES! If you do decide to call, your call gets directed to a call center, not the Hoboken location. Imagine having so many issues you literally need a call center to handle your bullshit. 3 hours, STILL NO COOKIES!!
2020-06-26,4,First of all, this place is getting 4 stars because of how amazing their cookies are! Second, never ever get it delivered takes 2 hours. Make the drive to just go pick it up yourself! We love this place.
2020-06-20,1,Absolutely horrible service. Quoted 20-30 minutes and 3 hours later still waiting for the damn cookies to even be baked. Go to Bang Cookies and get yourself a real treat. These guys suck.
2020-06-20,1,This place has the worst service. I have waited THREE HOURS at one time for cookies, absolutely ridiculous awful service
2020-06-14,2,I do love the cookies and they almost always hit the spot... except when they don't come....I'm very upset right now. We ordered 12 cookies last night and they literally never came. I always try to order directly from businesses if they allow it because I figure they get the most profit that way but it kind of backfired on me. We ordered around 1130pm and when they didn't come at 1230 I called and the headquarters (I'm assuming) told me that they're waiting for Postmates to pick it up. In the cookie tracker they were still saying our order is baking. Now it's 130 and we're ready to sleep still nothing. So I call again. This poor guy on the phone has to explain to me that the Hoboken location is not answering so he has no idea what's happening but few people have called tonight with the same issue so they are probably slammed. Just the courtesy of a phone call is all I expected. "Hey we're super busy we can't get to your order." This is like being ghosted by your midnight snack. Not cool! I'm going to have trust issues with future orders :(
2020-06-12,5,Scary! It's addicting lol .. And it's not helping my waistline! And the cookies are ridiculously amazing. I can't see one without eating it. My friend has to hide them from me.. and I always find them before he can eat them!
2020-06-12,3,Insomnia cookies (at almost all locations) are amazing. Cookies are warm, tasty, and a great late-night treat. HOWEVER the delivery service is horrible. I've ordered in many locations in the northeast region of the USA and they almost all deliver the cookies 2-3 hours after you deliver them. It's definitely worth the drive, but don't have expectations for prompt delivery.
2020-05-24,1,Awful delivery service. I ordered cookies flr delivery at 8pm. Around 9:30pm, I decided to call for an eta. The rep on the phone advised that I needed to wait a little bit longer because the delivery had already left, and would arrive within 30 mins. 50 mins later...still no cookies! I called a second time and the repsaid she needed to call the store regarding an issue with my order. After being left on hold for almost 10 mins, she came back on the line and said the order was on it's way and there was nothing she could. By 11pm the order still hadn't arrived, therefore I decided to call and request a refund. The rep told me they call the store for an update and that I needed to wait. At this point I didn't even want the cookies anymore, so I requested a refund. I'm disappointed with this experience because  customer service kept brushing me off and I'm not sure I'll be ordering cookies from this location again.
2020-05-17,1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY:  order delayed 4 hours no notifications about the delay horrible attitude is the customer service over the phone instead of  "Happy Birthday", they wrote "You are the best" - I did not want to say that to my ex-husband!!! Insomnia, you really disturbed my sleep tonight #sucks #avoid #horrible
2020-05-14,4,*Quarantine Delivery Review*Back in the good old days when we were allowed to walk around at our leisure, I would always pass by Insomnia Cookies and it always smelled so good. Now fast forward to my fiance's quarantine birthday. I wanted to get a sweet treat for him so I thought of Insomnia Cookies. I had also tried them at a Yelp event in NYC once, so I knew they would be good. I placed an order for same day delivery and it came exactly when it said it would. We had the peanut butter chocolate, chocolate chunk, double chocolate chunk, snickerdoodle, sugar, and white macadamia nut. My favorites were the snickerdoodle and the white mac nut. The double chocolate chunk was too sweet for me but the sugar level on everything else was perfect. We ate some a few days later (after popping them in the toaster over), and it still tasted great. Next time, I'll be trying the funfetti!
2020-05-10,1,Worst customer service ever!Ordered cookies online for the 3rd time for in store pickup. Each time I went to pick up, my order was not ready. I had to wait 20-30 min each time for them to bake  the cookies. What's the point of taking online orders when nothing is ready for in store pickup? I am done with this place.
2020-04-11,1,Terrible. Called twice to confirm. I sent cookies for my friends bday and they never included my message. I called the company two times after their tracking was unavailable and it was a waste of time. I tried to use them to cheer my friend up for her birthday during quarantine and they neglected to include my message.
2020-03-07,1,Took 3 hours to deliver our order, and we live half a mile away. Once the order arrived, we discovered that only 2 of the 3 sandwiches we had ordered and paid for were actually delivered. Won't make the mistake of ordering from this place again.
2020-02-15,1,This place has great cookies but HORRIBLE delivery service. I ordered about 2 weeks ago and waited almost 2 hours for my order, they said their second delivery guy called out. I thought I would give them another go so I ordered tonight at 9:16pm, got a call at 10:40pm saying they were out of the ice cream I want so I had to pick a new flavor. They also said the deliver time would still be awhile because the only had one driver.So I called the help desk, the woman said It would be another 45 min meaning my delivery would arrive around 11:30 ish....when I ordered at 9:15I chose not to wait almost 2+ hours for cookies so I canceled the order. I'm just upset they can't get their crap together.
2020-01-08,5,I give this place 5 stars because the staff is amazing. Anytime I've been here they always throw a little extra cookie or something in. They don't have to and I hope this doesn't get them in trouble, but they've been incredible. I came a late night around 2-3 am right before closing and they gave our group twoBoxes to take home because they were going to be thrown out anyway. Thought that was a great gesture. Cookies are always phenomenal there and the ice cream is delicious. Love it here wish I lived closer!
2019-12-30,5,Popped in for a late night snack tonight. The location is small. There's not much room for sitting but is perfect for on-the-go munching. It's right around the block from the Path/Lightrail Station.Insomnia cookies are nothing to sleep on. I ordered Snickerdoodle, Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Chunk and they were all delicious. The peanut butter cookie fell apart with practically every bite (it's a good problem to have-- trust me)They also have ice cream for sale, definitely stop by for a sweet treat!
2019-12-17,5,My cookies were great and the cashier was nice too! It was super crowded when I got there but not a long wait. I ordered my infamous sugar cookie with icing filling. It was soft and delicious!!
2019-11-11,5,Okay first, insomnia cookies are great. I don't care what anyone says. Am willing to fight about it. I have to really put effort into NOT punishing a whole box of them every time I go. Second, and the reason I decided to finally leave a review, was the service. Every time I come here, I always see the same guy working. I always forget to catch his name, but he wears glasses and has blondish (maybe reddish?)  hair. He is always so freakin friendly. Tonight my husband and I went in for a free cookie for veterans day, and he thanked us for our service and was just so so kind, that I felt like I should finally write something.Thank you man with glasses and blondish reddish hair! U da best.
2019-11-01,1,The hype is not real.  The only thing that's good about these cookies is that they are served warm. Overly sweet, and artificial sugar flavoring.   you're better off going to the supermarket and buying frozen cookie dough and making it at home you would get a better cookie. Don't waste your time and energy on what people say that these cookies are good. I am as honest as I can be when it comes to my Yelp reviews and this is definitely a bad one.
2019-10-15,4,Came to Hoboken to visit Carlo's Bakery and ended up stumbling upon Insomnia Cookies. I was more excited about the cookies! I've visited the location in Georgetown DC, so I knew exactly what was about to happen... I was about to be in cookie heaven! Insomnia has a very small storefront, so it's a little difficult to maneuver, especially when it's packed with people. The 2 employees kept the line moving, they seemed to have a pretty good rhythm. I felt bad for the guy at first because he was all alone at the front. There were several employees on their phones in the back, and I'm sure there were on their break, but it definitely looked bad. Luckily one of the employees came up to help out. They have a full selection of different types of warm, delicious, ooey gooey cookies; as well as ice cream so you can have an ice cream cookie sandwich. I decided to stick with just the chocolate chip cookies. There's no pictures because.... well.... I inhaled them. And I have zero shame about it. Thank goodness there's no Insomnia near me because I'd weigh 1000lbs. My absolute favorite cookie shop! I will always stop whenever I see one!
2019-10-07,5,This place is simply amazing cookies are always warm service is always excellent and the quality is something you can't find anywhere else. I don't understand how this place has bad reviews.
2019-10-04,5,I was craving tf out of some cookies and remembered there was an insomnia in Hoboken . I'm so happy i did . Drove right out . 23 min ride from Newark and these cookies are the best . I loved insomnia in New York so happy there's one in jersey we might need one in downtown Newark or maybe Montclair .
2019-09-25,5,I was coming back into Hoboken -- my college town-- past midnight from a concert in NYC. A coworker graciously lent me his parking space earlier that day. I was tired and out of it, and all I wanted were two things: food and sleep. Well, thankfully my memory pulled through in that state. My out-of-it self remembered that there was this late night place that sold cookies near the PATH station: INSOMNIA COOKIES! I got a warm mint chocolate chip cookie, an all time favorite since this place opened when I was in college. I used to get a box of 4 of these...no regrets! They're amazing. I also got a cup of cookies and cream ice cream that night which was surprisingly huge. When it's 12:30am and you need something sweet, Insomnia really hits the spot. Tired Chelsea got what she wanted and needed: food and sleep (induced by Insomnia cookies). Thank you Insomnia for your crazy late hours and for feeding Hoboken night owls warm cookies!
2019-09-19,3,Yes, the cookies are good as other reviews have mentioned. I went kind of late at night and I was surprised that there was a pretty long line. The cookies are good, but I have had better and they do not live up to the hype that they have. This is a good place to go to if you want warm cookies late at night and you don't want to bake them yourselves.
2019-08-21,2,Look honestly speaking they are great cookies. No lie! But the wait for delivery is ridiculous!!! Every time I place an order, it takes them about an hour and a half. Literally not that far from me either. So for the delivery reason I give them 2 stars. Please step it up guys.
2019-08-19,4,I am not a cookie eater at all but I went here on a date for desert and tried a few and I must say...WOWThe cookies were so warm and buttery and delicious. We got 3, peanut butter, chocolate chunk and snickerdoodle. My favorite was peanut butter, it was perfect in always from softness to taste ! The location is a little small and crappy with only 4 seats so that was annoying because we had to eat in the car. Other than that it was amazing !
2019-08-17,1,It's weird because I enter at 3:34 on Friday the 16th aka you don't close til 4am so I'm confused as to why the employee closing gave the nastiest attitude saying you were closing. Trust me I get it, I've worked in the food industry but if you want to close early at least try to the hide the cookies in the display and politely say you were closing early. Thanks.
2019-08-03,2,I give it 2 stars simple because customer service is a big selling point.. The employees are miserable.. Not freind at all. When someone is looking to have a night out and grab a warm cookie with ice cream there is no need to give people attitude.  I hope the owners reconsider hiring a better batch of people to represent a great Cookie Idea
2019-07-31,1,I placed an online order at the Hoboken location and it said 20-35 min for delivery and after almost an hour it said the cookies were still "baking". I called the customer service number who placed a call to the Hoboken location and then stated that the delivery person was completing a delivery of a big order outside the delivery zone, and the store would send out the other orders when the driver returned, but they did not know when that would be. This is not the first time we have tried to order cookies to the office with a very slow turnaround. Why not update the turnaround time in the system if you are unable to deliver within the stated window. Very disappointing.
2019-07-11,2,These cookies aren't bad, but definitely over priced for being okay cookies. The cookies are dry and hard definitely needs milk. The service was good, but the price for the cookies definitely made the experience not worth the 11.30 (with tax) dollars for a pack of 6.
2019-06-24,2,Monday night. 9pm. I ordered six cookies and a pint of ice cream. Someone called me immediately after my order was placed to tell me they didn't have the flavor of ice cream i ordered. OK, it happens. I requested another flavor. It then took 90 minutes ( 1.5 hours!) to arrive. This place is less than a half mile from my residence. See the attached picture. The best part is you can't even reach the local store you ordered from by phone. If you try to get in touch, you reach some kind of national call center. Cool, cool. I guess this might be an ok business model if it's 2am and you're a stoned college kid. Otherwise, don't expect...well, anything.Edit: finally opened the ice cream and the "pint" is 2/3 full. LOL, what a f-ing joke
2019-05-23,5,Best cookies ever, hands down. Totally worth spending like $25 for a box of 12 cookies or whatever it is. I drive an hour out from Staten Island (plus an hour back) to buy these cookies cause they're that good. I take them home and microwave them & they taste amazing every time. I remember when I thought subways cookies were good lmfao, insomnia is a game changer. Watch out for all the crackheads in Hoboken though, they get a little too close for comfort sometimes
2019-05-22,1,If you're ordering delivery, make sure to subtract TWO HOURS from the time you want it to arrive, for it to get there on time. This is the second order I've placed that was late. Why even allow customers to schedule delivery if you can't get timing right? Super frustrating. I can't speak to how good the cookies or brownies tasted or not because both times were a gift...
2019-05-06,5,I LOVE INSOMNIA COOKIES! Every time I've come here, which is 4-5 times the cookies are fresh, the staff is friendly, and helpful. I have 0 complaints. I once waited 30 mins vs the 20 they told me for a mini cookie cake but I didn't mind bc it was warm not super hot, falling apart to carry home!
2019-04-30,2,Got the cookies late, called customer service and they were not helpful and rude. I also tried the online chat to try and find out where the order was. They never actually answered my question - just wait they will eventually come back was the response. Then they stopped responding. The. Worst.
2019-04-26,5,One of my favorite go-to spots for cookies! The staff is always friendly whenever I go to this location. I ordered a box of 6 cookies and they were all delicious. My absolute favorite is the peanut butter chip cookie. They always have a different deluxe cookie which is nice. But I think they need to add more flavors to their menu. Overall it's a great place for when you want that sugary baked treat. Parking is a little tough but if you're in the area after a night out it's a great pit stop.
2019-04-16,4,The stars are really for the cookies..... I visited this location twice. My first visit was great! It was later in the evening so I was happy they were open later, and their cookies are bomb, seriously bomb. The mint chocolate chip, ugh, so good!! All of the cookies just melt in your mouth. The staff working that night - super friendly, attentive, made recommendations, and most of all, they were patient.  During my second visit, however, there was a completely different staff working. Because my boyfriend and I had such a great experience the first time, we weren't expecting anything different. The young man working behind the register seem to be agitated or annoyed to be doing his job. We ordered to go: 6 cookies and an ice cream sandwich. He made the ice cream sandwich and placed it on a regular paper plate. Fine, maybe he didn't remember we said to go. When my boyfriend asked if we could take it to go, the young man just grabbed an empty box and threw it at us to box it ourselves. Maybe it was just a long day.
2019-04-14,1,The service here is up and down. Someone they arrive super early, other times they arrive over an hour late with the cookies all mangled and broken and cold. Get consistent with your delivery people. Tonight they only had one delivery person. It was already an hour after I had ordered and I called and they said I was the 5th person after their current order. It was already 9:30. Wtf. Over it.
2019-04-07,4,Not sure why this place has bad reviews. The staff was friendly when my boyfriend and I went. They weren't that busy at the time. It is small inside. Smells great every time we walked by.We ordered the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie (my fav!) with birthday cake ice cream (my fav!). Both were delicious together. The cookie was warmed and had a little crunch but overall a soft cookie which I love. And the birthday cake ice cream was excellent. Cookie id say 8/10 and ice cream was 9/10. Cookie was a bit small and very sweet. Brusters birthday cake ice cream is very close in comparison. Both yummy!
2019-03-16,5,Nice to Insomnia on the other side of the Hudson now (AKA besides NYC) Cookies are always fresh and tasty. When they first opened they only delivered within a couple blocks of the establishment. They finally expanded and come to Newport and it couldn't be better. Those rainy days when all you wanna do is "Netflix & Chill" but want a snack as well but you also don't want to leave your apartment! Yup! This is it. The perfect fix!
2019-03-07,5,Love these cookies! They are always so soft and fresh! They also are open really late which is great for a late night dessert run! The snickerdoodle and white chocolate macadamia cookies are my fav! Just so good!
2019-02-20,3,This place is open late and sells tasty cookies. I have tried their sugar cookies, and the ice-cream sandwich as well. They do cookies well - they were a little soft, chewy and tasty. But the ice-cream sandwiches are definitely not worth it - the vanilla ice-cream is nothing special and they put cold cookies on top and bottom. Customer service isn't good either - I didn't even get a proper box/container for the ice-cream sandwich. Insomnia has good cookies, all else fails to impress.
2019-02-15,4,Ended up at this place after enjoying the night at Lo-Fi bar. The cookies were so good! But I did feel guilty having them because I'm trying to eat clean hahaha.I went for the small cookies but if you want big cookies they have those too!
2019-02-11,4,Really good cookies for not too expensive! I like the double chocolate chunk the best. The red velvet one is also tasty too! Next time I'll try the ice cream sandwich in the summer!
2019-01-07,3,Came here once since I wanted dessert and it was recommended. Got an ice cream cookie sandwich. The chocolate cookie was good, but not the best ever. The ice cream was also good, but not the best. I was upset that I couldn't pick up my dessert to eat it like a sandwich since the bottom cookie was broken when it was given to me. Probably because the people working behind the counter weren't very interested in doing their work. As another reviewer mentioned, not very friendly. What I was mainly upset about is the lack of variety for a dessert spot. There were only 6 ice cream flavors to choose from. The place is also very small, we had a hard time walking out after ordering because so many customers were cramped in. I would come again if I was in the area, especially on a late night since they're open late, but wouldn't go out of my way because of the price, overall quality, and service.
2018-12-17,4,I drop by here every once in a while, when I'm in the area. I think I've been here more than a few times.It's located pretty close to Hoboken terminal, so I generally drop by if I'm eating in Hoboken and I'm craving something sweet.It's a pretty small shop, take out only. I only really get one item here. The chocolate chip cookie. I think I might have tried the oatmeal raisin here once, but I digress. I usually get one or two, because the cookies here are sweet. What I like is that their the cookies are hot and soft, if I eat them right after being served.Prices here aren't too bad, but if ordering you're alot of cookies, it can add up very quickly. Definately give them a shot, if you haven't already. It's a good place for a nice small sweet treat.
2018-11-12,5,The Cookies??...Apparently they are great The Cookies!!! My favorite is the Strawberry Ice Cream Outstanding!! It's a popular place always busy!!! It's super clean and the staff in house are always super pleasant given the busy environment!!!Good Job Insomnia Cookies Hoboken!!!!
2018-11-08,3,This was my first time visiting Insomnia Cookies in New Jersey. I discovered this chain when attending college in Philly. The cookies are always great! Customer service wasn't great, but not as bad as others here are saying.
2018-11-02,1,I just left the store. I ordered a sugar cookie pie to go and when I came to pick up my cookie the guy at the register was having a full blown conversation with the lady who ordered about 108479 cookies with a packed store and no where to move! Also, my pie was extremely cold, maybe if I wasn't waiting for 10 hours to just pay and get handed my pie it would more warm.
2018-10-30,5,These were delicious!! Huge fan of these cookies. Tried it once and can't wait to order them again. A perfect munchie snack. The counter girl was kind of rude but the cookies lived up to the hype. I would def. come back. Not sure if they deliver but would be awesome if they did.
2018-10-26,1,The cookies are delicious, but the delivery service is really, really bad. I have had 2 delivery orders in the last month and waited 1.5 hours or more for it to arrive.Seriously?! It was just a few cookies....I have ordered pizza and pasta and received in half the time. Hoping that they fix their delivery issues.
2018-10-15,4,I recently went here for the first time and the cookies were amazing. Got a six pack between 3 people and we all loved our own choices and even each other's. The only reason I would not give this location 5 stars is because the inside is extremely small. We expected to be able to sit and chat but it was extremely crowded. Despite that, I will most definitely be returning for some amazing cookies!!!
2018-10-05,5,I stopped in here a month ago because my train was delayed due to infamous Hoboken water main breaks. Seeking relief from the heat I decided to stop in for a cookie. Just the smell of the cookies when you walk in will make you start to drool. I'm sure it just blending in with my sweat because it must have felt like 90 degrees outside. I decided I needed to live my best life and get an ice cream sandwich. You get to choose which two delicious cookies you want along with your choice of ice cream. I ended up walking out with mint chocolate chip ice cream smothered between two White Chocolate Macadamia cookies. Sounds like a weird combo but it was everything I needed on a long walk through puddles of dirty jersey water to make it back to the train station. I know this tends to be a late night spot for delivered sweet treats but I would have never discovered the awesomeness of that cookie ice cream sandwhich had I not stumbled in that day! So Suez/Hoboken thanks for flooding the streets so I could expand my palette! Well worth it and I will definitely be back for my next cookie craving.
2018-10-03,4,Customer service is hit or miss. Once I went in around midnight and the young man behind the counter had a dull attitude, never made eye contact. I felt like our roles were reversed: I wore the hat of the accommodating and friendly staff member and he was the annoyed customer. Ha! Another time I went in mid-day and the man working was extremely friendly. The 4 stars is only because of the inconsistency in service but those cookies are amazingly good! Warm, soft and full of flavor!!
2018-09-23,4,Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews! This was my first time going to Insomnia cookies and I had a great time! It was around 2-3 AM and the staff was lively & playing music! I couldn't imagine working at that time & having enough energy to give great customer service. The staff told us which cookies were popular along with their favorites! I went with a classic Chocolate Chunk cookie! The cookie was delicious & warmed to the perfect temperature. This is more of a grab & go place as there are only a few bar stools inside! If the weather is permitting I recommend grabbing a few cookies & sitting by the water front for a great view! I can't wait until I'm back in the Hoboken area so I can stop by and try different Insomnia Cookies!
2018-09-21,1,They have a RACIST teller. My girlfriend and I went in for the first time to try out their popular cookies. As we walk in the teller who was working the cash register (a larger white woman) was a having a, what it seemed to be, joyous conversation with a white mother and her child. Both laughed and both said their farewells, with smiles on their faces. My girlfriend (who is Filipino and who looks asian) comes up to order a cookie. The teller's smile suddenly turns into a sort of annoyed look. My gf tells the teller she wants 1 cookie and the type of cookie. Them says, word for word: "yeah. And what else." My gf says that's all. And pulls put her debit card. As soon as the teller sees the debit card she says, word for word, quickly and sternly "No. Cash or you get two cookies. 3 dollars minimum". My gf didn't hear it cause of how fast she did it. The teller sighs and then looks at her and says, slowly and extremely condescendingly "cash.... Or... Two.... Cookies....". My gf says "ok two cookies". We get our cookies. As we eat our cookies sitting down an African American man comes in and asks for a free sample. She says in a stern and loud voice. "NO" and continues to cut him off by saying "NO" over and over again. He leaves. After a group of white young adults walk in and she suddenly has that same smile, greating them warmly as we watched. For transparency's sake, I am half filipino, half white american and I look more of a white american than Asian but never interacted with the teller. My gf is half filipino and half Chinese and looks unmistakably asian. She was a white, larger woman. One would use the term "plus size". We'll never go here again if this is what they're all about.
2018-09-09,3,Warning:  these are highly addicting! No wonder its called Insomnia, these cookies will have you up at 1am craving them.Whats better than Giant, warm Chocolate chip cookies, especially past midnight? Yup. Nothing! Their cookies are freshly made, they have an array of choices, i personally always get the chocolate chip cookies, basic but you cant go wrong with them. You can get choose between their traditional cookies, or their deluxe ones. Their Deluxe cookies are HUGE! So I just get one and trust me thats more than enough for my taste buds. Get some milk and you have the perfect midnight snack! Tip:  This is a quick in and out place. You order your cookies and you go,  or you can stay and sit down, but its a really small and compressed space, so i don't really recommend that. In terms of  service:  I truly come here exclusively for the cookies, the staff most of the time are young adults who seem like they would rather be doing anything but be there. The couple in fort of me was having trouble choosing what cookies they should order and all the girls behind the counter would do is roll their eyes.  If the cookies weren't as addicting and delicious I WOULD NOT COME HERE. So to the owner of this place, i suggest a talk with your staff members because not once, not twice, but countless amounts of times that I come here and I see how shitty the service can be. Personally, I always just block it out, but it was so rude to see the girls roll their eyes at the lovely couple in front of me. Cookies: delicious, Service, not great. Would I come again? Yes, just for the cookies. So thats why you guys get 3 stars ! :)
2018-09-01,5,Honestly what's better than warm cookies at 2am? This place is the BEST to satisfy a sweet tooth. The service is always excellent and all the cookies are great. The white chocolate macadamia is my favorite and the sugar cookie comes shortly after. If you have enough room I definitely recommend getting a cookie ice cream sandwich or their a la mode, ice cream on top of a warm cookie
2018-08-03,4,I had always heard of Insomnia Cookies, but never thought to give it a try. Cookies are just cookies, right? WRONG! Insomnia cookies are decadent, warm, and delicious! Great chewy consistency and great ratio of mix-ins. I like that they have regular and deluxe cookie sizes. The employees weren't exactly warm and friendly but still took our order and we received it with no issues. I'll be back!
2018-07-19,5,I had six of the traditional cookies and 4 of the deluxe ones. Loved the double chocolate chunk and the snickerdoodles cookies. They were so flavourful, warm and sweet just the way I liked them. Simply perfect.
2018-07-17,5,What hasn't been said? Having a place like this in the college town of Hoboken is a perfect match. It used to be a hike to NYC, but having these warm cookies just around the corner is such a privilege. The best cookies are the s'mores and the peanut butter chocolate chip (which are the deluxe ones, so they're a bigger size), but all are good. In many ways it could be some of the best cookies I've ever had.
2018-07-03,5,These are my new favorite cookies. I used to like picking up a cookie from a place in Miami called Night Owl Cookie, but those things were so huge and decadent eating on was an exercise in not getting diabetic coma's. These are not small, by any measure, but they feel more appropriate in size and taste. They are in the perfect spot in Hoboken. Either you are getting one as you arrive and walk out of the train station as you head into Washington. Or it's the perfect punctuation to a nice day in town as you head home. My favorite is always going to be the basic chocolate chip cookie, while my kids love simpler still, sugar cookies. All of them are fantastic. The staff is polite and very welcoming. There is no real parking in Hoboken, you can try your luck and find random street parking, or just pay the heavy fees in a garage. I barely drive anymore unless we're going to go large distances or across state lines. So really, coming in on train is what I find most convenient. Besides, driving into Hoboken is a whole other mess of traffic that I don't like experiencing often.
2018-07-02,5,I love these cookies. I come here almost every day and get new cookies. So far I have gotten the peanut butter cup cookie, m&m cookie, and snickerdoodle. All of them were amazing. I have only recently tried this place and I love it. 5 star joint in my opinion.
2018-06-27,5,The cookies are so addictive! I love all of them. But double chocolate chunk holds a special place. Sometimes I have the cookiewich which is pure dessert therapy
2018-05-10,1,This place probably has the best cookies in the area. Perfect for a midnight snack, but the only thing ruining the cookies is the manager or whoever he thinks he is. Does not know how to speak to customers and is always rude to anyone in his way. He is always arguing with the workers in the back.
2018-05-05,4,Fine, over priced, average cookies and ice cream...I know...But at 3am I'm a huge FAN...Sadly since I visit around that time theres only a few options left but I take one anyway...
2018-05-03,5,These cookies and really really good. I drive 30 minutes just to come get them. They are a little on the pricey side but they are worth it.
2018-04-28,1,The Hoboken location has an arbitrary policy on the acceptance of bill denominations.  After standing in that long line, I ordered $45 worth of cookies and sales clerk claimed they don't accept $50 bills.  Did you think I printed it?  Wth? Meanwhile, the other clerk was scratching his head and serving cookies.  Disgusting!  Crepes and Cookies in Jersey City, less than a mile away, has no such policy and better service without a side of dandruff.  Needless to say, I found solace in your arbitrariness!
2018-03-08,2,I love the cookies from this place and never really have complaints, hit this location needs an attitude adjustment! I understand that being opened at 2 am in Hoboken can be a bummer because of the drunk people that goes in, but not everyone is like that . So somerespect needs to be shown and not an attitude. I will continue to go just because the cookies are delicious and this is the closest location to me.
2018-03-01,5,To Die For. Oh man. No really to die for. And their open late and they deliver. I've said enough
2018-02-26,5,What's better than fresh baked cookies for an afternoon pick me up?! Insomnia Cookie comes quick, fresh, and always hot. They even recognize their loyal customers and sometimes throw in free products or coupons.
2018-02-23,4,Love Insomnia Cookies!!!  They are so soft and gooey.  Forget the customer service, it's all about the cookies here.  These cookies are a great size and the best part is that they're so soft.  I don't know how they do it.  Even a few hours later, they are still soft.  Pop them in the microwave for 10 seconds and they're good to go!
2018-02-20,1,Worst customer service ever. Came here to get some cookies and the gentleman behind the counter took his precious time scooping brownies/brownie cookies into a box for...get this...no customer in front or behind me. Yes, I was the only customer who stood there like an idiot waiting to be helped, but nope! He kept scooping away. His coworker swung around from chilling by the window to see what he's doing and instead of asking me if I need assistance, he just wanted the other guy continue scooping brownies. Are you kidding me?! What kind of business/customer service is that?? Needless to say, I said, fuck this place and left. I don't want those cookies THAT badly to wait ages for it. Fuck it.
2018-02-08,4,The PB cup cookie hits the spot every time- warm, gooey and with a big chunk of peanut butter cup, how could you go wrong? The service is ok and prices are ok I think it's a little over 3$ for 1 cookie but it is a larger cookie than the regular size since it's a speciality flavor. Have yet to order delivery- I have only stopped in to grab a cookie a few times while walking home. Solid addition to Hoboken!!
2018-02-02,1,I have ordered from this 'bakery' 3 times. ALL 3 times the order has been missing at least 1 and up to half the cookies I ordered. Once may be a fluke, but three times tells me you don't actually care about my business. I HIGHLY recommend you look elsewhere to get your sugar fix.
2018-01-21,1,So I've given them so many tries, and I'm done with this place. They keep messing up my order and sending me expired coupon codes that don't work. The cookies are pretty good but the service is the worst I've ever experienced. Not worth the hassle. One time it took 2.5 hours for the cookies to come (I live 2 minute walking distance away). On top of all of this there customer service number is terrible, it takes 10 minutes to get through to a rep and then they ask you the same questions a million times over. Sorry insomnia, but Bang cookies now has me(much much tastier as well, but a little pricier -100% worth it).
2018-01-15,1,Places an order online called after an hour and 20 minutes. Was told "next driver back to the store will get your order for delivery" she was unable to give a time estimate. Cancelled order.
2017-12-15,4,Wow reading these reviews makes me think I just got lucky on the day I chose to go visit the store. Everyone was helpful, I really can't complain about the employees. Parking is a mess. Took me a good twenty minutes to find something. There are lots but I didn't wanna pay just to stop and get some cookies. The cookies themselves are delicious. A bit on the pricey side but they're worth it. Always warm too.
2017-12-06,5,I couldnt have been more wrong with my original review. The delivery was a little late so I was a ticked off and let my emotions get the best of me... The truth is this is a 5 star place. I have ordered this a couple times since and I have been very pleased.My wife even had a personal message for me when she ordered and they delivered. I didnt know you could do that but it was pretty cool.The smores cookie is the best one. The peanut butter cookie is also out of bounds. The cookies and cream ice cream is also very good. Very creamy and luscious. I apologize insomnia cookies for the 3 star review originally... i was wrong... i can admit it... Great job!
2017-12-05,5,It's literally a place that sells hot tasty cookies.  Like where can you go wrong? Yeah, it's small but like they are really only selling cookies.  The woman who worked there on Monday, national cookie day was very nice to talk to.  I've been here both intoxicated and not, and they are really good at convincing you you need $20 worth of cookies, but that's their job.  I've never had a bad experience here!
2017-11-29,5,These cookies are sooooooo bomb. This location is a little tight but I don't mind it at all. Dark chocolate cookies are the best, the chocolate just melts in your mouth & the cookies are super soft LOVE IT!
2017-11-25,4,I love your cookies but you should really consider delivering to the cast iron lofts!!!! It is closer to your Hoboken location than uptown Hoboken is! Regardless your snickerdoodle cookies are my favorite thing to binge eat.
2017-10-24,2,The cookies here are pretty good (warm and soft) but I wish the employees weren't shitty. The man who rang me up had a terrible attitude. I tend to be indecisive but that doesn't give an employee the right to get frustrated and SHOW that frustration to the customer. TOTALLY unprofessional. I asked if I could have toppings on the side of my cookie sandwich and the guy responded by saying "ugh, yeah I guess". Which then I said "never mind I'm good". I lost my appetite at that point but I was really craving cookies so I purchased anyway. I won't be coming back if that employee is there again. He had black plugs (earrings) and kind of tall. I recommend that the owner of this store adds a customer service program of some sort. A friend of mine said she was treated unprofessionally as well. Or maybe, the employees here need to learn some common sense, like don't treat customers like they're a burden in your life.
2017-10-08,1,Our experience at Insomnia Cookies did not meet our expectations. The staff did not look very professional. You can also tell that the cookies are microwaved. We recommend that you toast the cookies instead microwave them.
2017-10-01,1,Cookies are average. It honestly would be more enjoyable to go the the Hoboken location if the staff there was more pleasant. Im sorry but if you work at a cookie shop you kind of need to have good customer service. This isn't Walmart. But it felt like I was at a Walmart on Sunday oct 1st at around 9 pm. Just nasty service for no reason at all!
2017-09-30,3,I got a half dozen cookies here. It's cute how they put them in a little cardboard box, kinda like a pizza box. And I like that they come warm. Although I was saving mine for later so they weren't warm when I had them. The cookies were okay - nothing super special that blew my mind, and definitely overpriced for what they are. To me, they seem kinda like Subway's cookies, but way more expensive.
2017-09-22,2,Food: The cookies were mediocre. Although they specialize in cookies, I don't think the cookies really do justice for what they represent. I can see why this place would be a hit the crowd after drinking. Some post drinking sugar pick-me-up. I also thought some of them were underdone. Cost: Fairly expensive for these specialized cookies. I ended up purchasing the box of 9 or something I believe and when it was rung up, the cost surprised me a bit. The bigger cookies are also extra I believe.Environment: This particular store was pretty cramped. I don't know if they are all created like this but the store could barely hold 10 people in my opinion. We came at a time when it wasn't terribly busy but I could tell that during the peak hours, the line would extend right out the door.Service: Pretty simple and straightforward. The service was quick and efficient and the people who tended to us were good. Uniqueness: The idea behind this establishment is very interesting. Although I can see why at certain times, people who head here to enjoy some sweets, the cookies aren't spectacular.
2017-09-21,1,My friends and I went there on night and literally got into a fist fight with one of the "managers" the manager attacked us verbally and and physically the Police became involved. He started becoming aggressive and calling us names because he claims we were being loud and disruptive but there were a lot of people in the store with us making noise. He told us to get out and we refused and then he got in our face and pushed us. This is where the altercation began. The manager was a young light skin Hispanic male. Plus the cookies were stale and he didn't give us milk to wash it down.
2017-09-10,4,Delicious and warm cookies! I got the 6 pack traditional cookies and my favorite was probably the double chocolate chunk which had semi-melted chocolate on top. The white chocolate macadamia is pretty good too. The classics with M&M, snicker doodle, and chocolate chip were all okay, wasn't crazy about it, seemed a bit basic to me.
2017-09-01,1,Butter is what makes a good cookie. Unfortunately, these cookies are made of mostly vegetable oil. Flavorless and heavy. Save yourself some money and buy a roll of pilsbury cookie dough. Tastes like crap just like insomnia cookies, but cheaper.
2017-08-10,4,Delicious cookies. Fresh, soft, cookies. Oh and they have delicious ice cream too.
2017-07-01,2,$6 for Ice cream stuck between 2 cookies. Even after a few beers this still struck me as a poor value proposition. And yet, I went ahead and ordered anyway because I am a fat kid at heart.You get your choice of cookies and ice cream. I went with an M&M cookie and some vanilla ice cream. There was very limited preparation involved in this ice cream sandwich. It's not like Coldstone where they meticulously chop and dice your ingredients.  They literally just scoop it in and hand it to you. How else would you make an ice cream sandwich I guess?As I walked out with my ice cream sandwich in hand, a wave of embarrassment swept over me.  I could have walked across the street and paid $2 for a Chipwich Ice cream sandwich at CVS. It's pretty much the same thing.
2017-06-26,4,I came across this place on Yelp when i was looking for a dessert for my father on Fathers Day. The reviews were all so positive and the pictures were mouth watering. My sister placed a order for the 10" cookie to be picked up on Father's Day for our lunch. It was delicious, driving with the cookie in my car all the way home was torture. It tasted even better! I can't wait to go back and try out one of their mixed creations!
2017-06-25,3,I always come here late night after hanging out in hoboken or grabbing some pizza. Every time i come here, they never have any cookies ready like you're favorites. They keep saying if you want to wait 20 minutes we will make a fresh batch. The cookies that were made already needs to be fresh because it does not taste the same. I have been insomnia cookies at Temple University and also in the City and there cookies are fresh. The ones over here are really hard and not up to par. I would rather goto McDonalds for cookies and milk which is practically the same thing except cheaper. However, sometimes when the cookies are the way they should be they taste amazing. Never get this placed delivered.. it takes a long time.. I recommend the peanut butter and chocolate chip sandwich over cookie dough ice cream. The snicker doodle and white macadamia is amazing also.
2017-06-24,1,They delivered over an hour late. As well as trying to get through on customer service was so pathetic. Never ordering again. If you want things in a timely manner don't order from there
2017-06-24,3,Not a day goes by without the security of knowing that insomnia is around. Yet the one in Hoboken is always busy and never at fault for words. That being said, it seems that the insomnia cookies in NYC are genuine while this one is a hangout for the staff and their friends. While their product is excellent the staff needs more pd (professional Development) in customer relations and professionalism. So as for cookies go...as for staff,if you are not their friend...watch out!
2017-06-20,5,I was so happy to find an Insomnia Cookies in Hoboken. The first time I tried one of these cookies was in New York City and they were fantastic. I wanted more the second I was finished with the batch I got. My boyfriend who isn't even a fan of cookies got mad when he find out the rest of the cookies he wanted had been eaten already! These cookies are addicting....if you try one you will want another and another....and another. I have never tried a cookie that has tasted so good before and I don't think that any cookie out there beats Insomnia Cookies!
2017-06-13,4,Haven't had any bad experiences with them. I seem to always go when its empty but the store itself is really small. Cookies are always fresh and warm, a bit on the pricey side but it's worth it.
2017-05-14,5,Just tried insomnia cookies for the first time, and we were very satisfied! My hubby just had back surgery and I thought some cookies and ice cream might cheer him up.  Have to say these cookies were indeed amazing :) They were still warm and completely delicious,   the wait time was pretty accurate, and the delivery guy was very courteous. The price seemed a bit high at first but the fact that they deliver warm cookies to your door at 9pm and you don't even have to put your shoes on is a pretty great treat! will definitely order from them again. thanks!
2017-05-13,4,The best cookies I've had store brought in a long while. They are served warm right out of warming drawer. Taste like they came right out the oven.  Customer service can use a little improvement, but overall I will revisit.
2017-03-29,4,My initial review got erased bummed !    But I wanna tell you guys about 56 Newark Street. Its in such a great part of Hoboken this was my first time in HOBO ever so I was overwhelmed with all the places I could go to eat because there's literally rows and rows of restaurants to choose from but anyway I chose them because they were first on my list and since they don't deliver to my side of jersey I better get it while I'm here. Again they are extremely easy to find no doubt about that. This site is extremely small I doubt more then 5-6 customers can be inside at at time. They do have a little sitting area facing the street. Once I got inside there was two gentlemen who greeted me at the register super nice they let me sample the ice cream and because I had never been there they gave me a cookie to try. I purchased 13 cookies for $13.00 which I thought was pretty good because of the regular pricing of the cookies. So a dollar a cookie isn't too bad.  I will say that the cookies were not as fantastic as everyone and I mean EVERYONE told me, "You need to go to this place they have the best cookies you ever had." womp womp .. NOT TRUE!! ( my best cookie to date was from city cakes) Now I don't want to discount them for the good things I do like about them but I'm sorry its not what I was expecting. Insomnia prides themselves on serving warm cookies. So I was under the impression it would be like fresh out the oven warm not so .. the cookies yes were warm but to me tasted under cooked (sugar cookies) the cookies did taste much better the next day. I got sugar, double chocolate, m&m , oatmeal raisin, and peanut butter cookies. To me the best were the m&m and oatmeal raisin. I can see myself wanting to come here after a night of partying or after having dinner because of their late hours. I'm sure I'll be back.. If you're thinking about it give it a try.
2017-03-28,2,The dessert was great if not a little pricey! The service however was not so great. The cashier was not friendly to us and acted as though we were inconveniencing her. When the next costumer in line approached her she was friendly and upbeat showing she was only rude to us. Perhaps because we wearing religious headscarves? I don't know. Either way it spoiled our mood. The place was also very cramped and no space for more than 5 customers.
2017-03-26,4,It may be pricey with these cookies but totally worth it. Its a bit soft and chewy. Also, it melts in your mouth.
2017-02-13,1,I'm sure the cookies are great, but we wouldn't know.  My boyfriend ordered us a Valentine cookie, seven hours in advance witb a scheduled time delivery. That time came and went, and no delivery. After calling customer service, our order hadn't even been touched. Will not be wasting our money here again.
2017-01-29,2,I work in Hoboken and frequently walk past Insomnia...I prefer to bake my own homemade cookies but haven't had time recently so I stopped in to pick up a Snickerdoodle cookie for my boyfriend. I liked that the cookie was very fresh and taken out of a warming tray but I definitely don't feel $1.75 for one thin medium size cookie is reasonable. I asked my boyfriend for his opinion on the actual cookie since he has eaten every snickerdoodle cookie to cross his path :)  His response was "good" I pressed further asking if it was "just good" and his opinion was that it needed more sugar and was just average. I don't think we will be purchasing cookies here again- I'm sure after a few cocktails it's an amazing but pricey delivery treat. I'm
2017-01-15,2,The cookies are delicious!  However even though this location has been open for a few months it seems they haven't figured out how to smoothly run their business.I had ordered delivery once and it took an absurd amount of time to be delivered and once it did the order was completely wrong.  We were told to call the store but the phone number actually goes to their corporate headquarters, so then you are going back and forth with the customer service team and the Hoboken location.  The person on the phone was so nice and it wasn't their fault, but we basically got our order about 2 hours after we ordered it.  And it wasn't a complicated order.Sure enough - decided to give them another chance - where else can you have a great dessert delivered at all times?  About 50 minutes after the order was placed I was called saying they were backed up and ran out of ingredients 5 minutes ago.  So basically they didn't start creating the order until 45 minutes after I placed it.  Again the person I spoke to on the phone was extremely sweet but it's just crazy that this customer service seems to be the norm.  As delicious as it is.. I will never get delivery from here again.
2017-01-14,4,YUMMMMMM!! There was a long line but line went by fast. All the cookies we ordered was available n warm! Soo good for a late night snack and staff was friendly! Def check out if u havn a late night sweet tooth!
2017-01-08,5,The cookie aroma here was wonderful - but I just wanted ice cream.  After sampling several flavors (Perry's Ice cream), I had Banana Cream Pie ice cream - very creamy with excellent flavor.  The workers were all very friendly and fun making my experience awesome.  colleensicecreamblog.wor...
2017-01-02,4,Pricey but worth it... the cookies melt in your mouth and are still delicious after being frozen for storage and warmed back up. I ordered two dozen with a little bit of everything. I may just be a little fatty but they barely lasted three days. They were sooo good.  Delivery took a little bit of time but nothing unexpected. If I didn't get yelled at from my fiancee for breaking out diet id be ordering these every week hahahaha. What goes better with cookies than milk? Classic combo and would recommend with these cookies.
2016-12-15,3,good cookies, albeit somewhat pricey. I was en route to a holiday party and figured I'd pick up something that my friends who are stuck in the suburbs don't get to have often.it turns out that the cookies actually do travel pretty well - I picked up a box around 7, and they were still soft when they made it to the party around 8. that's including a mile's hike in pretty cold weather.the guy behind the counter lost track while counting and definitely gave me some extra cookies, which was cool...although his constant checking meant I missed one NJ Transit train. slightly annoyed about that, but I suppose that's what I get for wanting different varieties of the better cookies instead of keeping it simple and getting 2 of each.
2016-12-14,5,Warm, melty cookies paired with a cold glass of milk is to die for especially at the late hours of the night!!!
2016-12-11,2,Ordered a which and 3 cookies st 8:25. At 9:30 I tried contacting the store directly but could not find a phone number. After 5min of being on hold for customer service call center someone was able to get information on my order. Apparently there are no direct phone numbers to the stores, you have to speak to customer service. I was told they were down a delivery driver and orders were backed up. At 10:05pm our order came even though my initial order stated 30-40min. 2 stars for cookies still being warm and no melted ice cream. I'll be picking up next time.
2016-12-11,4,Ordered these on a Saturday night at around 11pm; they arrived well within the hour and did not disappoint. Must say I am surprised at the negative reviews; can't complain about our experience. The cookies are packed into a box together, but came hot and hadn't melted onto themselves. Hot cookies delivered to your door--we would do it again!Edit: We ordered them again, and they were amazing.
2016-12-10,5,This place was great. Stopped by in person because the website didn't seem to deliverer to my neighborhood and when I called the 1-800 number and spoke to a generic customer service rep that wasn't aware of what cookies they had at the specific location in Hoboken. Everyone in the store was super friendly and engaged us in conversation. The staff let us know which cookies were their favorites and made recommendations based on our tastes. One of their delivery guyslet me know that they do in fact deliver to my block. Will be definitely going back for more
2016-12-02,5,Best cookies I've ever had! Warm, soft and delicious! My favorite is the triple chocolate deluxe cookie,  it's ahhhhhmazing. The staff is very friendly and the store looks very clean.  I love that they're open pretty early and close super late.
2016-11-25,3,I'm not sure if I enjoyed it because I was inebriated and starving or if it was actually good. My friend and I strolled into Insomnia after a night out drinking. I've heard much about this place but only the ones in the city. We decided to give it a try. I wanted to order the m&m cookies however to my dismay they ran out. The staff informed me that I'd have to wait a while if I wanted it so I opted for the brownies instead. He asked if I wanted it warm which I appreciated and I complied. The brownie was warm and the chocolate was melted and gooey. It was good but not great. There was nothing super special about it. I feel like I could find better brownies elsewhere or even make better brownies myself. Nonetheless, it sufficed my cravings then and there but I probably wouldn't crave it again. The price was ehhh and honestly it was a waste of calories. The place is super small. The one thing I thought was cool was that they delivered cookies. The delivery guy was still working and it was 2am in the morning.
2016-11-20,2,Presentation is awful if you get them delivered and order the 6 or 12 pack. Cookies are never warm. Takes forever even if you go in store.
2016-11-13,1,Extremely disappointed in the customer service at this location. My roommate ordered 6 regular cookies and 1 deluxe cookie. It took about an hour for them to arrive. When the delivery man arrived my roommate opened the door and realized she had left the cash in the other room and told him to wait one moment. As she walked away he yelled the price that she owed. She counted out the money to him which was the total plus tip. An hour passes and insomnia cookies calls my roommate because they are concerned she received the wrong order and did not pay for her cookies. After she hangs up the driver calls her and accuses her of not paying him for the cookies. After she tries to reason with him he says he is outside our apartment to collect the money. She refuses to pay twice and calls customer service who did not help with the situation. We were then put on the phone with the store manager who put us in an unfair situation which was to pay the money or he would have to fire the driver. That is the last thing we wanted to happen so we suggested it just come out of his pocket instead. After a crazy experience like that I will not give business to insomnia cookies again.
2016-11-07,1,You walk into an empty store with employees just hanging out doing nothing. The girl there tells me that the two most popular cookies are the double chocolate chunk and the snicker cookie (cinnamon).  So I ordered the double chocolate chunk and the snicker doodle.   Got back to my office and opened it up to find a regular chocolate chip and snicker cookie.   How the hell does someone make a mistake like that after she told me which cookie was the most popular?Thank goodness the 800 customer number redeemed the situation by giving me some free cookies on my next order.   Too bad the store workers aren't half as competent as the customer service people. If management doesn't clean house at this location, this place will not survive and will be out of business within 1.5 years from now.   Guaranteed.   You can take that to the bank.   I hope they find employees who actually care and put pride in their job.
2016-11-06,1,I got food poisoning from this dump and was sick for three days.  My partner was sick as well.  Customer service was horrible and couldn't have cared less that they got us sick.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE CREEPS!!!!
2016-11-04,1,I'd probably give it less than one star if I could. First time ordering from Insomnia, even though I've heard of it for years. We ordered at 9:15pm and they arrived just shy of 10:30pm. The city is... ONE SQUARE MILE!!!! What the heck. Okay super extended length of time aside- we ordered five cookies. They came room temp. (if that), not hot as advertised and they were basically all piled on top of each other in a giant unappealing mess. So chocolate had melted all over the box, etc. One was even burnt and dry. Def not worth $8.50 plus tip. You can easily make cookies yourself which will taste just as good or honestly even using premade dough. Sigh, so disappointing.
2016-10-29,1,Ridiculously overpriced. Take your extra 70 cents and go to Lavain instead for a far superior cookie
2016-10-28,5,I ordered before I read the reviews but my order came in under 10 mins on a Fri night and every item was correct.  Maybe Hoboken location is getting it together;)
2016-10-25,1,Hoboken Insomnia is the worst. Ordered cookies at 10:30 & called the store to see how busy and about how long. We were told the store was slow to expect in 30-40, almost an hour goes by and we call to check and they were waiting on a car to arrive to delivery. Meanwhile the tracker states our cookies are still baking. 20 more minutes goes by and we call, they say it has just been sent out at 11:36 we wait..12:00am rolls around as we get a not so friendly store rep who is quick to have us cancel our order and tell us that they have just left for delivery. We simply cancel and are left with nothing. So sloppy and such a let down.
2016-10-25,2,Ordered delivery and the cookies were great, but my order was completely wrong, which was disappointing.
2016-10-25,1,I've ordered delivery twice since they opened a week ago. Both of my orders have been wrong and missing items. The cookies are good but that doesn't matter if you don't get what you ordered. Get your act together!
2016-10-23,2,They take an hour to deliver.They also forgot some cookies in my order. I called to deliver the ones they forgot to pack and they never followed through.Only gave 2 stars because the cookies taste good.
2016-10-20,3,Welcome to the neighborhood Insomnia Cookies! We are all happy to have you and look forward to many late night cookies deliveries. Starting with 3 stars here because there is some room to grow in terms of service, efficiency, and perhaps store layout, but their product is pretty good. The store is a bit tight, any more than 4 customers and you are standing shoulder to shoulder. There is seating for 4 at the counter in the window, but perhaps they will do away with that once they see that its a bit tough to be a customer in there. Super awkward. The variety is good, but the pricing is a bit sneaky with the cookies - you get your heart set on a cookie with stuff in it and it'll cost ya. The best cookie: the Smores Cookie. Was even oohey gooey a full day later. The least fav of mine, the peanut butter cup cookie - way too sweet for any average person, except if you are cookie monster. There is a definite learning curve for the staff. When I was in there they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off. One guy apologized to me for making me wait 6 minutes for a cookie and shared that he was the only veteran working... Ill make sure to come back in a month when they are really ready for the customers and try it again!
