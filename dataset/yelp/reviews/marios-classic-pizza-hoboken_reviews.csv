2021-07-24,5,Good pizza, good price, great staff!  Also have sangria sold on mason jars that is delicious!
2021-01-17,4,Solid spot with the right price. Tons of pasta in an order and good flavors. Try the meatball part hero or chicken marsala.
2020-11-22,5,Heard about this place through the grapevine. Solid slice! Crispy and tasty. Friendly staff. Plan on ordering delivery soon.
2020-08-14,5,Best plain slice of pizza in town. Haven't ventured out much beyond their regular pies but they have cheap beer and delicious pizza which is a great combo. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a slice or pie
2020-08-13,4,Solid place for a classic slice and / or a salad meatball , etc etc . Plenty of pizza options from buffalo chicken to Caesar pizza . They have beer and wine too . Super casual and good people I ordered the spicy meatballs with pasta and it was quite good
2020-08-01,2,Every so often I stop in for two slices and a drink. And if the star rating was based on the pizza I would give it a 3 1/2. It's not bad they have a wide variety of pizzas.  so today I went and got a slice of barbecue chicken and a slice of margarita with a small bottle of Coke. I had it the guy at the counter at $10 bill and that wasn't enough came out to $11.50. I was told that the cost of tomatoes and mozzarella one up, but seriously, this isn't NYC. Over &4/slice in Hoboken? No bang for the buck,  no value not for that kind of pizza. My rating is mainly based on what you get for what you spend.
2020-07-12,4,After a long day of shopping at Ikea, Olive and I wanted to get a quick, classic cheese pizza while we assembled our furniture; and that's what we got from Mario's. I don't have any photos but the pie was pretty darn greasy. Nothing wrong with that, I like a greasy cheese pie as much as the next guy. It was what you'd expect from a NY style pizza. If I'm going to critique it, the dough was kinda tough and chewy despite the slices being floppy and limp, and only became more so the longer it sat out. In my opinion, a good slice of pizza shouldn't completely flop over when you hold it up. The only reason I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 3 was because of the quick delivery, and the fact that they gave me 2 sodas when I only ordered one. I'd try it again, but I'm new to Hoboken and want to try the other spots first. All this being said, none of the pizza was wasted and I ate all the cold leftovers later that night. Also, they have a cool hand-printed logo on the box that we cut out and hung on the wall!
2020-06-23,4,This is my go to neighborhood pizza place. Free and super fast delivery if you call to order (instead of placing the order online). It's a great place to stop and grab a slice or 2 if you are walking by. The penne vodka slice is amazing!
2020-06-03,5,Great pizza spot, cannolis are amazing also. Family owned/operated. Very friendly and great people!
2020-03-31,5,Pizza is awesome customer service very friendly food is absolutely amazing I will be coming here often for great pizza
2019-03-12,5,Great local spot for a variety of pizza, homemade pasta, sandwiches, and fresh cannoli.  Good selection of beer and wine.  Great people.
2019-01-09,5,WHY does this place not have a perfect score??? This has been our go-to pizza delivery place in Hoboken for almost 10 years. The crust is not too thick, not too thin - it's just absolutely perfectly delicious. The sauce isn't sugary like so many other places. Also, this place DOES NOT skimp on the size of their large pizza. We feed off it for a few days.Bonus: I've heard Mario's feeds the neighborhood Thanksgiving dinner - for those who have no where else to go.Right now, we are really into their Margarita Pizza which has plenty of fresh mozzarella cheese. I think I'm going to order one tonight.Go Mario, go.
2018-12-11,5,No BS and no frills here. It's refreshing to encounter a classic slice like Mario's in a town where brick ovens, artisanal pies and Instagram bait shops are cropping up left and right. Sometimes the old soul in me just wants to be taken back to Lent Friday's at Catholic school or late night deliveries from Arthur Ave during my time at Fordham, and that's Mario's for ya. The delivery is always quick and the staff is very pleasant. I also find it so wonderful that Mario opens up his restaurant on Thanksgiving and serves up free meals to people in need. This place is a neighborhood gem!
2018-11-29,5,Love this place! The food is great and the staff are some of the nicest people out there. The type of place where they remember your name and greet you with a big smile. I always recommend Mario's whenever anyone is looking for a quick slice or somewhere to get good pizza. They also like to switch it up with their wine selections for a reasonable price.
2018-09-15,5,Mario's provided all the food for my beginning of the year football party. Great pizza, great wings. Awesome service. Will absolutely be going back. Highly recommend their cannolis too!
2018-08-30,2,Came on a quick lunch break and ordered two slices: chicken parm and margharita with a can of soda came out to $9.60, seems a bit pricey to me for OK pizza. Nothing amazing about the crust or sauce. I've ordered chicken parm pizza elsewhere that taste better than the one I had here and the margarita pizza had a lot of mozzarella than usual not enough sauce, it was dry. They do have outside seating which is nice for nice day out since the restaurant is pretty warm inside. They have a nice selection of single slices but not worth the quality.
2018-08-21,3,I was worried since the pizza is a little greasy but it turned out to be a pretty good slice. I am talking about the plain slice which is what I judge every pizza place on. I also went with the chicken marsala square which was pretty solid as well. The crust had a crunch to it and the marsala flavor comes through. As for the chicken wings they are not the best. Stick with the pizza here. It was an amateur move to order wings here but I was in the mood. Mistake.Overall, this is a solid neighborhood pizza place. It is one of those slices you can set your watch to. Reliable, solid, and will satisfy the craving.
2018-08-13,4,Amazing pizza in Hoboken!!! The sauce is well seasoned and the crust is crispy as can be! Only 4 stars because the last time we went the pizza tasted different in a bad way. The cheese didn't seem as fresh and the pizza itself was a little on the bland side.
2018-08-11,5,Friendly staff, pet friendly out door seating, food is on point and very fair prices on their food and beer.
2018-06-26,5,I really like Mario's. It's a great place to come with a group of your friends or a couple family members for a fun casual meal. You are treated like family by the servers and Mario himself! Only problems I have is it can be really hot in the restaurant often and the bathroom isn't super clean Either way- I love the food!!!! Keep it up!
2018-06-26,5,If your looking for a good slice of pizza then you have found the quote place !! Not only is their pizza out of this world, they got great wings!  Pizza is nice and thick, cheesy with a great crispy crust
2018-06-20,5,My boyfriend and I were walking from garden and 4th to Pier 13 and just happen to pass Mario's. I saw in the window that they have $2.50 blue moon drafts and I literally stopped my boyfriend asked if we could eat here (we were looking for a quick bite to eat before getting to the pier anyway). We were on the hunt for our favorite pizzeria place in Hoboken, so we figured why not.When we walked in, I swear I was in pizza heaven. There were at least 10 varieties of prepared pizzas on display with a variety of different options from all veggie to meat lovers. Choosing which slices I wanted was probably the hardest thing, but what was actually the easiest decision was getting a blue moon to accompany our slices haha I ended up choosing a triangle Sicilian (yes, a TRIANGLE) and a bbq chicken slice. My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken and bacon/tomato/chicken slice. We placed our order with a very friendly staff member, then waited for the slices. The slices heated up quickly, so we headed out to their outdoor seating area which was very well maintained. Our beers were delivered to us shortly after.My Sicilian slice was sooooo buttery and delicious. I haven't had a Sicilian slice in so long, so it was everything I imagined and more. My bbq slice had a great balance of sweet and smoky flavors and they were definitely generous with the amount of chicken topping. On top of that, the slices were large. I can't think of a more perfect pizza lunch. Needless to say, I am super excited for the next time we go to Mario's for a slice or two!
2018-06-01,5,Been going to Mario's for 12 years. A lot of pizza places in town and I may use another one here or there depending on what I'm in the mood for. But Mario's is by far my favorite. If you want a large, delicious, classic pie done right every time, with consistently fast delivery this is who you call. Love Mario's.
2018-05-31,5,The food was very tasty and the outdoor seating was terrific -- at first. Then the damn kids racing on scooters came by and ruined the meal. Not only were they speeding but they were using the curb to do stunts. It is pitiful that business owners have been closing done due to the refusal of the administration to enforce safety.
2018-04-27,2,Great tasting pizza (both triangle and Sicilian). Chicken parm was good butI wasn't blown away. Why only 2 stars?A few things rubbed me the wrong way after I made my phone order (cannot order online). When the pizza delivery man showed up I had out my credit card. He looked at me in shock and said that when they delivered it's cash only for deliveries (I've never had a delivery place do that since nowadays everyone has that thing on their phone where you just slide a card on it (forget what it's called). Nowhere on the website did it state that and when I ordered, they didn't ask how I would be paying so I just assumed (shouldn't have) that I would know once the food came. I also saw an automatic gratuity charge of $3. I was told that it was because I was not in Hoboken (according to Google Maps I am only 1.3 miles away and could have walked there in 23 minutes. There is also no toll roads or anything LOL.  I felt this was an extremely dishonest charge since again, I was not told this over the phone, and again not listed on the website. I still tipped the delivery guy since it doesn't appear that he gets that $3. Could have been a 4 star review. Any business that omits the the truth or details from me where I end up surprised is an automatic no for me as a repeat customer. I come to NJ fairly often so I have several other pizza delivery places I could call who would hopefully be upfront about prices and extra fees.
2018-04-10,4,Love the pizza and eggplant pasta dish. Can't beat the 2 dollar drafts! Excellent staff and service.
2018-04-10,5,Been going here almost 3 years now since moving to Hoboken. It's our go-to spot for perfect pizza and they are 100% consistent. I'm actually ordering now
2018-03-14,5,Mario is the best. He's been making pies by hand here in Hoboken for over 30 years. He does it himself and he does it with love. One of my go to places for pizza in Hoboken. Call him up, tell them what you want and it's ready in 20 minutes. While you wait you might even be lucky enough to chat with Mario. Great pizza, great menu variety and great people. You couldn't ask for more.
2018-02-26,4,Pretty good pizza as well as good selection. 2$ yuenglings and 2.50$ blue moons. Staff is friendly and a good spot to grab a slice and beer while watching a game in the summer
2018-02-20,4,Baked ziti with Vodka sauce instead of the red sauce is a game changer. Their red sauce is eh for pasta which is why I stick to the vodka sauce, but their pizza is also pretty good!
2018-02-13,5,Best pizza in Bergen County!! Salad slice is loaded with olives, peppers, onions and more!
2018-02-04,5,The housemade cannoli is the best of NJ and NY, so save room on your main course! The service is great!
2018-01-28,5,Ordered five pies from Mario's last night and my party loved it. Place also has outdoor seating when it gets nice out. Will be coming back for sure.
2018-01-12,1,Horrible!!! Basically un-edible pizza!!! The pizza came and the cheese was slide to one side of the pie! They refused to do anything about it. Horrible pizza and horrible service. This used to be a good place now it's very bad. How do you get cheese under a pie?
2017-11-28,1,Horrible pizza...it was delivered very quickly. makes sense though since it was cold. The cheese wasn't even fully melted on one of the slices. The wings I ordered tasted like rubber. They were tossed in the garbage after one bite. The manager said "i should have called to tell them right away and they would have sent a new order"....sorry i was frustrated and hungry so i ran out to get something else. calling pizza joints to complain about shitty food isn't #1 on my list for Sundays.
2017-10-06,1,I have been going to Mario's for 3 years now. Normally a solid pizza spot with decent wraps and hero's. Tonight... I ordered a chicken parm hero and a chicken Caesar salad wrap for my roommate and I. The order took 2 hours to arrive and when it finally did I found a baby inchworm in my chicken Caesar wrap. It was a good 3 years but it's a deal breaker for me.
2017-08-31,1,If your goal is to end up ticked off and treated like crap after they screw up...then order from there.  Otherwise......DO NOT  DO NOT  DO NOT  DO NOT
2017-08-28,5,This is my go to for pizza by the slice or by the pie. Never had a bad slice of pizza here.  Chicken parm is realy good here too. They have beer here never tried it but looks like its ice cold. Maybe next time i will grab a deink with my pie. Give it a try you won't be disappointed.
2017-08-10,2,Love their pizza, chicken parm sub and chicken ceaser wrap. Only reason I'm giving this place a 2 star is because they CONSTANTLY forget stuff (side of cheese, ranch dressing, and soda) when I order delivery. Otherwise it's a great neighborhood pizzeria.
2017-08-04,1,Rude management.  Yelled at my pregnant wife for placing refuse in an outside trash can.  Seriously?  What a jerk.  Will never support such a character in a town with no shortage of fabulous pizzerias owned by kind people.  MEAN PEOPLE SUCK!
2017-01-29,5,I love pizza.... a lot. Their is nothing better then a good old fashion slice of cheese pizza and a beer. You can get both of these here for less about $5. Their pizza is really good and of course Mario (and Mario Jr) are extremely nice and always thankful for the patronage. I can literally say that this is probably the best slice in Hoboken, unless you want some overpriced artisan pizza, you can have that, I'll take Mario's any day. And don't forget to spin the wheel.
2017-01-27,3,Average pizza for the area. Nothing exceptional but totally acceptable. A little too much cheese for my taste which made crust a soggy.
2016-08-27,4,$2.50 blue moon beer on tap, was the reason my BF and I stopped by while walking around Hoboken. Lots of outdoor seating. Sells different types of pizza by the slice, got a slice of the broccoli rabe and sausage pizza - tons of broccoli rabe and totally worth the $4.28 for it!
2016-07-10,1,This was by far my favorite place to get pizza. I would go maybe once a week until I found hair IN the pizza, not once, but on two separate occasions and now I go to Napolis
2016-04-19,5,Our favorite! Great neighborhood pizzeria, awesome staff, clean inside and nice out door dining. I hope they never close down!
2016-03-03,4,My husband and I enjoyed our stop at this Hoboken neighborhood pizza joint. Pizza was delicious, friendly service, fresh mutz, $2.50 beer, clean and plenty of seating. They've been open for decades. Good for a quick bite.
2015-04-29,4,I'm not sure how Mario's doesn't have better reviews.  They are my go-to spot when I need something quick. My favorites are the chicken caesar slice and the arugula slice- yum!  They are always so welcoming when I come in here and when I'm feeling extra lazy, I even order delivery even though they are a block away from my apartment and it always arrives hot and fresh in a short amount of time.
2015-03-14,2,Came here last nigh for some grub, it was a Friday during lent season..so no meat. It was a little disappointing to see the limited options of non meat slices. You would think since it is lent and what not they would cater to that. Anyway, I went with a plain slice of pizza and a ricotta cheese and broccoli slice. The plain slice was good. The broccoli and ricotta cheese slice was ehhhhh, not my favorite. The broccoli was really hard and the slice itself was dry. It needs something else, Im not sure what but it is lacking. Also ordered a caesar salad and mozzarella sticks. I can't believe I am typing this but the caesar salad wasn't that great (thought it would be impossible to mess this up). The quality of the lettuce was really poor. The mozzarella sticks were ok, just what you would expected them to be. They are definitely just frozen and heated up. The service is always really good, which helps. They also carry my favorite drink ever, Boylans Birch Beer. Huge plus for this place! I'll stick with whats good next time, the plain slice and thats it.
2015-02-16,4,Mario's is definitely one of my favorite NY pizza style slices in Hobo: great sauce, cheese, crust, simply spot on and satisfying. It is also consistent (I have been many times) and the service is always friendly and warm. Once I brought my then 1yo niece who could devour a slice and they kindly cut up her slice into bite size squares so she could eat it. I almost always get the plain but last time tried their veggie sausage which was delicious as well! Will be back soon!
2015-01-31,2,First off, the guys that run this place are very warm and welcoming. They have been around for 30 years so there must be something they are doing right but unfortunately it's not the pizza. Extremely doughy and underdone.  I'd go back for a cheap beer and maybe a sandwich but for pizza I have to go elsewhere.
2015-01-22,4,Love my local pizza place with it's roulette wheel in the front, where you can spin for free soda and pizza. Cute. The pizza is delicious and their salads, large and fresh come with a great vinaigrette dressing. Broccoli Rabe is really good and I also order the chicken dishes here. Great food, great delivery. Sometimes they mess up with delivery so check your order - they are always willing to fix it if there's problem. Community involved place, Mario keeps it fun with big blow up holiday larger than life characters in front. I think it's a terrific place for kids and families to go and pick up a quick bite.
2015-01-10,2,Relatively inexpensive but for the price it's worth it, $14.50 for a 18" cheese pie.  They piled on the cheese and the slices were huge.  The Stromboli had entirely too much butter... When it got delivered it wasn't even in one piece anymore.  I'd be interested to try the entrees.
2015-01-09,5,Anyone that gives this place a bad review is an insane person. The pizza is definitely the best pizza in Hoboken and the bread is awesome. I've had a lot of different pizzas, sandwiches and meals and they have all been phenomenal. Plus, the laid back local feel makes it even better!
2014-11-24,5,They offer free meals on Thanksgiving Day for people who are hungry.  Plus the food is good. What more needs to be said.
2014-11-20,4,I love the pizza here and am also a huge fan of the chicken parm sub.  However, recently, we ordered a chicken pizza for delivery which came to $28 (for just one pizza).  We had to call back to confirm and they said it was $9 extra for chicken.  When we stated that their own menu stated $4.75 they continued to insist it was $9.  So either the menu is inaccurate or they were just making up a price on the spot.  Having said that though: the pizza was delicious.  Still, events like that keep this place from getting a perfect score in my book.
2014-11-15,4,Solid pizza and food. You must try the BBQ chicken pizza! It is delicious and I've had enough pizza in this life time to last. Don't forget to get a root beer w that. Overall, if is a solid place for pizza. I always come after a basketball game when needing much carbohydrates. My friend always get the spinach pizza and even though I'm not a fan of veggies, if was very good as well. I have a other types of pizza but my favorite the is BBQ.And if you guys are not awared, the owner Mario, is a former Yankees player. Even though he ain't no hall of famer, he sure knows how to make a mean pizza
2014-10-28,4,I am a slice girl and they never disappoint. The slice is always fresh and crispy and the best part is the staff is wonderful. I have lived in Hoboken for 18 years and Mario's is still the best in my eyes.
2014-09-13,1,Goddamn you Mario for making me do this!I have been a loyal customer since 2007 and I've been ordering almost once a week.  The food is consistent and the portions are huge.  You can not order anything on this menu and be disappointed.The delivery guys are cool and FAST.  Rarely will you wait more than 30 minutes.With that being said, unfortunately since the start of the summer their service has tanked.  If anyone with a young voice answers (especially a girl) HANG UP.  Don't even bother trying to repeat yourself 30x that you want a plain pie.  Seriously.  The kids working there are similar to the spanish maid in Family Guy.  Save yourself the aggravation and go cook yourself.  Wait.  You think you can persevere?  Okay.  Let's do that old pick-your-adventure thing.  a) You call, young kid answers.  You will repeat your address and phone number at least 40x.  Still there?  Okay repeat the process with your order.  Sit at home.  Wait. Wait.  Wait.  Hmmm didn't I say you usually get your food in under 30 min?  You call back and whoops, they forgot your order.  Okay.  Wait.  Wait.  BOOM.  Delivery guy brings you your salvation.  (Still under 30 when it's right).  Your order can be right, it can be cold, or it can be wrong.  Can someone fact check me -  who has better odds?  Your food order or the roulette table?b) You call, old man answers.  HE KNOWS WHO YOU ARE BECAUSE YOUR NAME AND ID SHOWED UP BECAUSE YOU ARE A REPEAT CUSTOMER AND HE'S ALL LIKE WHAT'S UP MAN WHAT'LL YOU HAVE TONIGHT? YOU SAY CHICKEN FRANCAISE AND A CAESAR SALAD. OK BUDDY SEE YOU IN 20.  BOOM.  YOU BETTER RUN YOUR ASS TO THE BODEGA AND PLAY A QUICK PICK REAL FAST BECAUSE YOU HIT THE LOTTERY.  HURRY THOUGH THAT DELIVERY GUY IS GONNA BEAT YOU HOME.c) Young kid answers, then after taking forever they give up and give you the old man, who in turn is upset that he has to do the kid's job and then gives you attitude on the phone like it's your fault.  You probably will get your food but with extra attitude and a side of fck you.  Or they won't even send your order.True story.  Last night killed me and this review will hopefully tell Mario to shape up before he loses more customers....So I call.  I ask for Penne Vodka and a salad.  After repeating my order again and again I hang up and wait.  25 min later I get my food!  Wait, it's a salad with pasta and tomato sauce.  I call back and the kid gives me the old man.  He proceeds to read what was keyed in and says "We only send what we are told" and after a little back and forth I say okay fine.  Can I please put in an order for Penne Vodka.  He says okay wait for it.  It's now Saturday, Day 2 of the Great Pasta Wait.Seriously what the fck man.  This was my favorite spot and the delivery guys are always on point even when you all suck.  I'm never going to order again unless Mario sends me my Penne fcking Vodka with Princess Toadstool herself.P.S.  WHAT GETS ME THE MOST IS THAT YOU HAVE A COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT SAVES ME THE TROUBLE OF REPEATING MY ADDRESS A BILLION FCKIN TIMES!!! HOW DO YOU NOT TRAIN THEM TO AUTOMATICALLY KNOW WHO I AM?  BULLLLLLLSSSSHHHHIIITTTTTT.  THE OLD GUY TAKES MY ORDER IN 5 FCKIN SECONDS. 5 SECONDS!  AAARRRGGGHHH!!!  HE LITERALLY ANSWERS THE PHONE, "IS THIS 1000 WASHINGTON? ALRIGHT WHAT'LL YA HAVE?"....TL, DR - I hate that I love you.  Awesome spot/horrible kids working there.
2014-08-02,2,If only Frank Sinatra knew what was going on with mediocre pizza in his birth town?  Do you think he would even believe it?I've given Mario's so many chances, and it's one of those places that I really, really, wanted to like.I just can't, though.  Each and every time I go here, I remember why I am dissappointed.  The people who work there are really friendly.The pizza isn't bad, but i cannot figure out how it literally is tasteless.  I've tried all different kinds, and I can't seem to taste anything.  Every time I eat here, I feel like I have been transfered to the Nebuchadnezzar (Matrix reference) where all their food is tasteless.  Also, it's a little more expensive than I would hope to pay.  I'll probably keep picking up pizza here, and one day (if I take the red pill), it will taste like delicious, tender pizza.  Ignorance is bliss.
2014-06-14,5,Staff is always pleasant.  They have great pizza. But seriously, the hidden gem is that they have the best cannolis in the city. Unreal.
2014-05-19,1,I really really want to like this place. The location is so convenient. I have lived around the corner for 6+ years, and sometimes i cave and go there because I am too lazy to walk up to Washington. Every time I go, I promise myself to not go again. This last time we went, I got my usual, buffalo chicken pizza. My husband got a meatball hero, and my son got chicken parm and penne. Lets just say none of us finished and none of us were interested in taking it home. Every time you go by its different crew that works there, not sure why no one works there more than a few months, mostly young (high school) and they don't' seem to care much about customer service. We ordered our food, my husband and my sons meal came, and 15 minutes later, we had to go up to the counter to ask where my pizza was and the young guy goes "oh what was the slice you wanted?" then afterwards, my husband had to actually calculate the bill for  the waitress. Just not worth it, even on those rainy lazy days. I rather do delivery from somewhere else...
2014-03-27,5,My favorite pizza in hoboken. Fresh toppings, great flavor. Its definitely a thicker, chewy crust. So if thin and crispy is your thing, this isn't for you.
2013-03-28,5,We order from here at least once a week.  Consistently great pizza.  And consistently quick delivery, which is huge.Also - the people who work here are super nice.  For the first time in probably close to 200 pizzas we have ordered (I would like to say that's an exaggeration, but I don't think it is...) we had an issue with our pie (it was missing a topping and a new delivery guy had somehow carried the pizza so that half the cheese literally had slid off).  We called to explain our situation (which we hardly ever do when we order even if it's not right, but this wasn't even edible in that state) and they were extremely pleasant and apologetic and we had a new pizza in a half hour.  Boom.  That's what I call customer service.  We all know restaurants are going to make mistakes from time to time, it's called being human. But it's how they handle those situations that makes or breaks them.  And Mario's passed with flying colors.
2013-01-23,3,I am gluten free and finding a decent pizza that is gluten free has become difficult.  I gave this place a try and it was better than I expected.  As far as gluten free pizza crust goes, most places taste like cardboard.  Mario's actually came close to real pizza crust.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It even came with its own plastic pizza cutter (nice touch).  Was it the best gluten free pizza I have ever had? definitely not.  Was it the worst? definitely not.  Would I eat it again?  Maybe.
2013-01-21,2,Itza meee, Mariooooo...I could provide a host of Super Mario jokes, but I'll cut to the chase here: I really wanted to like this place. The service was reasonably friendly and they appeared to have a good selection of slices to go out. Also, they don't have a charge limit.Thus, you can see that my review is for slices to go (not delivery or a whole takeout order). Maybe it's better if you get it fresh. However, I'm questioning the inputs: I got a margharita slice and I'm pretty sure the "fresh mutz" had been subbed with Polly-O. Also, the grease factor was at an all time high. My shirt is bearing the aftermath.Probably would go so far as to say that Molfetta (read my "I'd rather eat the box" review) is better. However, the service here seems a tad friendlier, which can help to compensate.That said, I stand strongly behind my promotion of Napoli and Grimaldi's. Consistently amazing.Okay, I'm not done with the Super Mario jokes:Q: What is Mario and Luigi's favorite clothing material?A: Denim, denim, denim.
2012-09-11,1,I can't believe the rating for Mario's isn't low. This has got to be the most flavorless pizza I've ever had in my life.  Pizza is very hard to mess up, but I think they pulled it off at Mario's.  I was walking along Garden St. in the middle of the summer and needed something quick to eat.  I get there hoping to cool off a bit, and realize that the place has ZERO air conditioning. It was mid-90s out and their solution was to keep the front door open. Brilliant... It is also more expensive than many of the other pizza places I've been to in Hoboken. There's just simply nothing good I can say about it, and would recommend avoiding it.
2012-08-07,5,Wow! So surprised about the number of poor reveiws...this is my GO TO pizza place in town and my husbands favorite as well. ABSOLUTELY NOT TASTELESS!
2012-08-01,4,I placed an order for a plain pizza pie to be delivered on 7/22/12, and when the pizza arrived, half of the cheese on the pizza slid off and was sitting in a corner of the box.  However, the pizza arrived fast, hot, and fresh.  Out of the numerous pizza parlors in Hoboken, I would definitely rank this in the Top 10.  If you like Giovanni's, Mario's is a good comparable pizza pie.  I called Mario's back to let the guy know that the cheese slid off and he offered to comp a free pie the next time I place an order.  I will be glad to give Mario's another try.  Hopefully, the cheese will stay on the pizza next time around!
2012-07-13,2,Tried the gluten free pizza last night.As per usual, the gluten free pizza comes in one size, a personal 12" size, and is priced higher than everything else on the menu.  But, the pizza was OK.  Compared to other GF crusts, not bad, not great.  There is better GF pizza in Hoboken.Just checking out the other pizzas in the shop, I wasn't really impressed.  Didn't look all that appetizing.
2012-07-06,1,WORST PIZZA AND PASTA IN HOBOKEN! DO NOT EAT!!!! Let me do you favor, please do not eat at this rathole.
2012-07-04,1,Really tasteless pizza. I was shocked to go in there on a July evening and there was no AC on and NO fans where the counter is. The place was HOT. The employees should strike until they at least put more fans in. I will never go back.
2012-02-21,3,Solid pizza and sandwiches, priced to please, always some kind of promo, whether it's the prize wheel (spend $10 get a spin; get at $1 Mario Buck, free drink, etc) or a free drink with purchase with team apparel during the playoffs.  Good for takeout, delivery, or eating in with TVs to keep you in the game.
2012-01-18,4,If you live in Hoboken, you know Mario is the best guy in town. He is such a great asset for the community, it's easy to support him. But besides his civic contributions, the man turns out some really good food, and has a nice, cozy restaurant that is a big hit with local families.  Mario makes solid Pizza, but I think his pasta dishes and sandwiches are his strongest suit. The Penne Vodka pasta and the chicken parm sandwich are my personal favorites, but there are a lot of great offerings to choose from. His Garlic Knots are very popular.  No matter what you have in mind, Mario's is sure to satisfy.
2011-07-31,2,This place was great a few years ago.  It has gone down considerably though since then.  The slices and garlic knots often taste stale and old. If you want to try the pie here order a fresh one.  Even then I find it to just be overly salty and mushie.  I feel that some of the people that work for Mario can be really unfriendly as well.The place itself looks great and is extremely well kept.  Mario does a lot for the community and I really appreciate that.  I just wish he would rework his pizza recipe.  It just tastes off.  I want to like the food here cause I really like Mario but I have to say thumbs down.
2011-06-30,4,So far this is my favorite pizza spot in Hoboken.  Pizza is consistently good with quality ingredients.  The calamari is usually good but they've had their off days.
2011-05-28,2,I was all excited for Mario's which I read about on YELP.  I'm now guessing Mario's clientele skews in the 20s and enjoys healthy portions of alcohol.It was very disappointing and flavorless.  I distinctly can remember needing to different kinds of Pepcid to combat the heartburn Mario's graced me with.
2010-11-12,3,I grabbed a slice here on a random day. It was a bit slow when I walked in and the guys working were enjoying the game. They were very nice and asked about my football preferences as I waited for my slice of pepperoni. The atmosphere and staff were great for a little pizza joint, but I found the pizza to be a bit overly greasy. However, I may give this place a second shot since everyone was so pleasant!
2010-05-03,1,I ordered a large a pie with mushrooms. The pizza was decent but the after effects were horrible. The mushrooms were apparently uncleaned which made my girlfriend and I violently ill. I went in the next day to tell Mario what happened and he responded with "What would you like me to do about it". All I wanted was an apology for ruining my entire day and to save other customers from suffering. Don't patronize this jerk.
2010-03-09,4,Mario's is my go-to pizza spot in Hoboken when I actually want good pizza.  I'm not talking about 3am drunk food cause then you can go to one of those big slice cardboard crust shops (Tudino's status).Mario's is pretty good on delivery and the sauce is tasty as others have mentioned.  I'd recommend going with a pepperoni pie, well done, with extra sauce.  Can't speak to the sandwiches.Mario's also has some sort of wheel with prizes inside if you spend over $10.  Never seen anyone actually do this so it might just be a trap.
2009-12-26,5,After living in Hoboken for 6 years and having tried every pizza place in the area, I feel qualified enough to rule in on the ignited debate of best Pizza in Hoboken. Mario's hands down is not only best pizza in all of boken, but best pizza i have ever had in my life. This is not like Benny's, which is only really good when it is 230am and your piss drunk. This is quality. The crust is rich and hefty and has taste by itself. The cheese and sause is authentic tasting and does not taste like cheap stuff used in other places int he area. If you are feeling really adventurous, order a slice of meatball, and you will taste heaven in your mouth.Only complaint - if ordering an entire meatball pie - meatball to cheese ration is worse than when you order a meatball slice. Solution = order pie with double meatball topping... BOOM!
2008-11-20,1,Okay, I have tried this place several times 1. because it is the closest pizza to me apt 2. my roommate loves it. I have been sooo disappointed every time I went. A few of these times I was even drunk. What drunk person is picky about pizza? Not this one! I think if you order a plain slice you are safe. By safe I mean subpar pizza, but not awful. I do not, I repeat do not recommend you ordering any special slices, especially the white slice which is disgusting!
2007-12-28,5,Yum.  Good pepperoni slice.  Even better was the chicken parm slice -- I've never seen deep fried chicken bits on a pizza before.  Genius!
2007-04-28,4,There are a lot of pizza places in Hoboken, and I've been trying to hit them all at least once.  So far, I've found that all of the pizza around there is pretty good, not great, not terrible.  It's all thin-crust, of course, and if I took a blind taste test with samples from every Hoboken pizzeria, I'm not sure I could tell the difference.  So, the thing is, the pizza here is about the same as everywhere else, maybe a little better, due to the fact that they put more toppings on (I hate it when places skimp on toppings.)  There are a few nice qualities about this place that make it my favorite pizza place in the area:1)  Since it's two blocks off the main drag (Washington,) it's a lot quieter and less crowded.  At least it was the day I went.2)  As Danielle C noted, the staff is friendly.  Okay, so they speak to each other in Spanish instead of Italian, and so the place might not be that authentic.  Big deal.3)  Free refills on soda.  Unusual for a pizza place.4)  Spotlessly clean.  Also unusual for a pizza place.Also, since the walls are covered with Yankees stuff, I imagine this is a place Yankees fans will love.  I don't watch baseball, though, so I don't really care one way or another.  All things considered, this has just become my default "go to" place when I'm in the neighborhood.
2007-01-02,3,Reliable if you just want a plain piece of pizza to satisfy that pizza craving.  Otherwise, I've been unhappy with my meals.  I've found some dishes to be of poor quality and taste, leaving me unhappy with their business.  Also, creepy staff. To sum it up, I have continued to go back for plain pizza (the pizzas with toppings have disappointed me greatly in taste), but don't plan on ever ordering an Italian dish from here again.
2006-09-06,5,I absolutely love this place! I go here whenever my boyfriend and I want pizza...for several reasons- We love the staff, because a) they're super friendly, b) they always have on the Yanks game (or soccer during the World Cup), and c) they have one of those spin wheels, like you would find on a boardwalk! If you spend more than $9.50, you can spin the wheel and you always win a prize- we've won a liter of soda, a Mario's t-shirt, and a scratch-off. They also have a great deal on pitchers of Bud and pizza is delicious! In my book, the perfect pizza joint!
