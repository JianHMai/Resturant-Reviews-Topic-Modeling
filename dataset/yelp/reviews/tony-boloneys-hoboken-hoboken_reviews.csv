2021-11-08,4,Placed our order online for the Savage Pilgrim sandwich and the Disco Prince fries. Got a call soon after from an employee to let us know they didn't have the Turkey leg for the Savage Pilgrim sandwich. A bit disappointed but ended up getting the Boloney Rex and was very happy. The sandwich was messy but delicious and the fries were great as well. Assuming the Pilgrim sandwich is seasonal so hoping to get back before it's gone.
2021-11-05,4,Tony Boloney's is in the middle of the late night scene in Hoboken.  If you are out until the wee hours of the morning, it is a good stop on your way home to grab a slice of pizza.  The slices of pizza are huge so one is definitely enough (and they are expensive enough for a whole meal).  The pizza is a bit greasy but has good flavor.  The options are also very unique compared to other pizza places.  I had the duckface which has garlic, bacon, and steak on it.  I would recommend stopping by if you are in the area.
2021-10-24,1,If you're ordering for delivery place the order at least two hours in advance. Multiple times our delivery has been 90+ minutes late and we're currently waiting on an  order that is over two hours late. Orders have been sent incorrectly, cold, you name it. It's unfortunate but moving forward I'd rather support a smaller mom and pop shop.Edit: food arrived two+ hours late, was cold, and missing three items. We also ordered a gluten free crust and the item that DID make it here was a regular crust, which can be dangerous for anyone with an allergy or sensitivity. TB refunded the missing items and gave us a discount on everything that did arrive which was very kind of them, but we are done ordering from here. This has happened far too many times.
2021-10-23,1,Be aware if you place a door dash order they will ignore it and then tell you they never got it when the driver comes to pick it up, and then tell you that they're closed when the order was in a full 40 minutes before they closed. They will not make your order, they will just say they "never got it"
2021-09-18,1,Walking in I came with every intention for a nice meaty Lobsta Roll slice and drink. I paid 14 bucks for a slice thaT BARELY had any lobster on it while the others had big chunks of lobster. when I went to express my feelings on the lack of lobster, they laughed and said "sure We will give you a new one". Their professionalism just had me walk out of the business and not return again. Many said This business was amazing but I don't think they are professional. OH AND TO TOP IT OFF- there was a hair stuck to the crust . Remind you I have dark black hair
2021-08-27,5,Saw this as one of the featured places on Giant Foods you have to eat before you die on youtube, so I drove over from Manhattan to try it. Street parking is available, but be advised it's meter parking only. $4.00 max for two hours, and if you use the app, they charge you an extra .35 cents. They are limited on tables. As far as the pizza, it's probably one of the best if not the best slice I've ever tasted in NJ. It's a bit pricey at $10 a slice but I do recommend the Lobster Roll slice. The dough is nice, and soft, loved the crust, loved the taste. I also enjoyed the $hitfaced slice which cost $4.69 per slice. I enjoyed the food so much, I had to order something different to go. I got the winger fries with added chicken. The buffalo sauce gave it an a nice kick it it. I also ordered the Lobster Trap. It was good, but overpriced at $35 for a sub. Overall, great place to go for lunch, or to grab a pie for dinner. They definitely have an assortment to choose from.
2021-08-14,1,I ordered Taco Taco pizza got soda with it and ice machine was out so I got warm soda but that not really the issue while I was eating one of the employees got on the table where the ice machine was with his shoes and the shoes were touching soda dispenser and utilities for the cups. With COVID-19 it's not sanitary and when I bring this to the attention of the another employee he just laughed at it. Do not recommend buying anything from this place STAY AWAY!!!!
2021-07-14,5,Check another one off of my Food Bucket List! I have been eyeing Tony Boloney's Taco Pizza for at least a year now and thanks to my fellow foodie/teammate Katarina- my dreams came true yesterday! Their video for this pie has over 300 million views on YouTube and now I know why! It's a 30-pound pizza made from pure taco dreams! The three types of tacos are mezcal-marinated steak, chicken, and brisket and are all cooked with delicious Oaxacan cheese and then stuffed into homemade tortillas. It's a ring of tacos around the crust and in the center a pool of guacamole. A drizzle of sour cream and a horseradish crema are the final touches. Two tacos are on every slice! Wow!! It was really amazing and something I will never forget! If you love tacos and pizza, do this in your lifetime. I am still smiling about it! The journey to Hoboken was a first and it's a really cool city! New place, new food and new adventures.There are so many other great pizzas on their menu too! And subs and apps too! I'd love to try the Lobster Roll Pizza next or the Sh$tfaced Chicken Pizza. The names are the best! lol Their motto is "Good Grub for Bad A$$ People." Definitely a great place for amazing pizza, subs and other crazy grub!
2021-07-13,5,My favorite is the winger slice and the barbarian fries without bacon. It's the best comfort food! Tony's has consistent good quality, lots of variety,  and great taste!
2021-07-11,3,After seeing that a famous YouTuber had visited this spot, my friends and I decided to give it a shot even though I was initially weary of the 3.5 star rating. My friends and I (4 individuals) called ahead for the Taco Pizza Pie. The pizza contained philly cheesesteak, chicken, and beef tacos. To be quite honest, I don't understand the hype around it. My group's favorite part of the pizza was the guacamole part on the tip of the slice--that part hit the spot! The chicken on the chicken taco on my slice felt rubbery when chewing as if it was microwaved. The interior of the store is subpar compared to even a normal pizzeria. Our one pie cost approx. $101, which was definitely not worth it. You're probably better off getting a normal plain pie and a few soft tacos from Taco Bell and putting them together. FYI...If you do decide to come here, there is a Yelp coupon for a free drink upon checking in. This place definitely has a few areas to improve, but at this time, I feel it deserves 3 stars.
2021-07-06,5,Best pizza in Hoboken!! We've ordered delivery from this location so many times and finally visited to dine-in. Ordered a half "Burrata" and half "Winged" pie and it was PERFECT! My only complaint is that there isn't much outdoor seating.
2021-07-04,5,I ordered a pie with Moonshiner on one half and Ay Dios Mio on the other. I love the Ay Dios Mio but I also wanted to try the Moonshiner. The Moonshiner has marinara and/or vodka sauce, fresh/smoked mozzarella, fresh basil, and shaved parmegano regiano. Everything was vibrant and the flavors combined very well. Overall, an amazing pizzeria with unique combos.
2021-06-28,5,was definitely worth the price no complaints love this place for it being my first time yesterday. Will be returning very soon.
2021-06-21,5,I used to live right above them and never missed the opportunity to try something new - love that they are innovative and unlike other pizzerias in HBKN always come up with something exciting. I like their salads too. Oh, and matzoh ball soup in the winter is my fav! I miss Tony B!
2021-06-09,1,Update: I ordered the small taco pizza on super bowl day. When I received it from the delivery guy, it was screwed up like picture two. I called the store and they originally only offered me 50% off for the next order. I had to argued with them to get another new intact taco pizza without charge. I also attended their Instagram Super Bowl event to win $100 gift card and they texted me and said I won $100 gift card for Tony Boloney's. Then later they never responded to my text and never send me free gift card. Not sure if two events are related but definitely watch out for their social media scam!
2021-06-04,5,The 18" "Magical Mushroom" pizza has blown me away. The mushroom and the ricotta cheese were so fresh. The truffle oil has brought the pizza to another level. The fresh parsley was is nice touch!! The pizza was on the soft side, very fresh and very moist! The ingredients were generous. It tasted great, and sophisticated. The large fries reminded us of the thrasher's fries we had in Ocean City, MD. (We had it with our own malt vinegar;) The kids loved the salad. It was just okay for me, so no elaboration. The food overall were not heavily salted, which is great;) The seasoning was just right. Now I understand the long line... and will go back and try more;)
2021-06-01,5,So I totally prefer this store over the Jersey city store their pizza was much more fresh location is smaller but my slice was amazing literally out of this world!!!! This slice is a little bit on the pricier side but totally worth it! I also pick up two pizza making kits and I'll be trying to make my own pizza tonight! The kits were only $20 each not bad and the come with everything you need !
2021-05-28,1,Incredibly bad experience ordering online. Food never showed up last night and they closed at 9:30 (order due at 9:20ish so it was after 9:40 when we tried to call)  and when my husband called today - they claimed we weren't home and not answering our phone (all untrue and we have a security camera and phone records). We live in a house. With a doorbell. Not an apartment with security gates/doors. The guy on the phone offered no help - we asked if they could maybe just deliver the food today and he said no and that we'd missed our shot - and tried to fight us on the back end too claiming the same thing with seamless and refusing a refund. We have ordered from them before and had no issues but the person on the phone was so rude and unhelpful. Disappointing. Not sure why we'd want to pay and take a gamble on whether food will show up.
2021-05-27,4,Tacos on pizza Tuesdays :) Weird yet satisfying tastes all in one bite. Brace yourself eating can get messy.
2021-05-23,1,When i tell u the place went down hill it went down. People came in after me and got food before me . I ordered one slice to heat up and an order of crustean fries. WORST FOOD I EVER HAD . The taco slice was so salty i couldnt eat it and was 13.25 for the one slice .... my fries were 12.50 . And burnt to a crisp look at the picture I literally threw everything out. Worst customer service two guys were in front standing around never asked me if i wanted to order a girl from the back had to ask me . It was horrible . stay away!!!!
2021-05-06,5,This place! Omg! So we visited and were dying to get some Philly cheese steaks. We came across this gem during our search and feel so lucky! I got the chipotle ole sub and it was incredible. The sauce alone was so tasty. Not too spicy and just full of all sorts of flavors! The meat was seasoned and tender and just yum. The bread was toasty and the cheese was melted and it was just mind blowingly good! Couldn't get enough! Also got the barbarian fries and I mean, just look at the pic. Delicious. We ordered again through grub hub before leaving back home from our trip and it was just as good even delivered!
2021-05-05,5,Tony Boloney is really remarkable. I went in, thinking it was going to be a 3.5 due to yelp's reviews average. Oh boy, was that average wrong. It seems to be either you hate it or you love it. AND I LOVED IT! I went to Hoboken just to eat the taco pizza, but decided to try a couple others as well. I highly recommend the Duck Town Slice and the Taco Slice. The tacos are probably better than 95% of any tacos I get in the NYC area that so happen to be on top of a nice guac cheese slice. Do yourself a favor, give this place some support and go!!
2021-04-29,1,The pizza and the salads from this place were super underwhelming! I ordered the Roast-vegan and the salad missed brussel sprours and broccoli rabe. The cauliflower was gritty and super oily! I got the tikka pizza slice which was well cooked but also soggy. Not sure how they managed to do that? The sauce was good but the salad just ruined my entire taste buds and I will not go back to this place!
2021-03-31,5,Thrillst, Insider, and Mikey Chen brought me here.I have to say, it lives up to the hype.I ordered two things: the first: the taco, taco, taco pizza. To see that pizza in-person, was like seeing something magical come to life. I've seen it in videos, reactions, and etc. But to eat it myself? Magical. I have to warn you, it is a bit pricey for ONE SLICE (12.50). When I ordered it, I didn't realize the price until my order was totaled.However considering, you are getting a pizza, + guac + 3 very well-made tacos...the price is WORTH IT, and dare I say, A STEAL. (Tony Baloney's, please do not increase the price :/) It was delicious, and although my slice was the last one in per-slice category, it was still BOMB. 10/10The second item I ordered were the K-POP fries. These little potatoes were A LOT. This is a good shareable item, especially if your going with someone [a friend/a date] that your not finnicky with, and would share a dish with. WARNING: IT WILL GET MESSY. It has gochujang, cheese, scallions, and sesame seeds on a MASSIVE BED OF FRIES. 10/10So all in all? Does it love up to the thrill[ist]]? Absolutely. I need to inquire about the Ramen Pizza, because NO INFORMATION WAS FOUND.Mike (the owner), if you see this, lmk!
2021-03-27,5,Amazing food Great location Price isn't cheap but not expensive Wings are amazing best wings I've had.Pizza is greatFries amazing Great customer serviceThey also have salads but yeah the taco pizza is also great.
2021-03-25,1,They're a bunch of frauds here. Overpriced, way below average food. Don't fall for the social media posts. Limp d*ick mozz sticks
2021-03-19,2,It was ok nothing special.   Based on reviews I would of thought it would of been a lot better.  Woof
2021-03-18,3,I've only ever tried the Long Branch loaction and sang praises about the Magic Mushroom slice. This time, I ordered from Hoboken and I'm really sad to say that it didn't meet my expectations.I saw that Mikey Chen and Tony Baloney's were doing a collaboration where you can buy a limited time Hot Oil Pizza to support the fight against Asian Hate. 100% of pizza sales went to a good cause so I do not regret contributing. HOWEVER, in both Mikey Chen's and Tony Baloney's IG posts, the pizza looked a lot more appealing than what I recieved. It wasn't awful, but it just wasn't what was advertised. Basically a crust with only cheese, a brush of oil and red pepper flakes. Also the mozzarella sticks were tiny and sad, so don't waste your money on them. I'm all for supporting a great cause, but it doesn't mean you should put out a product that is lower than your standard.
2021-03-12,5,Absolutely amazing, drove over from CT to have lunch with a friend. Brought back 6 subs and a pie for the family.
2021-03-07,5,Never disappoints!! There vegan slices are bomb and my favorite slices are the magic mushroom, Jewish cowboy and the OG. Yummmm.
2021-02-28,4,Just grabbed a few slices here after being recommended by many people. I ordered through GrubHub for pickup and the slices were ready within 10 minutes. I ordered 1 plain cheese slice which was... just an average cheese slice. I did like how thin the crust was (like paper thin!). I also ordered the General Khan slice and a Thundercat slice. Both were delicious. The hot honey sauce on the general khan slice was a good ratio of sweet to spicy. nice thin crust and topped with scallions and seasme seeds made for a tasty bite. The Thundercat slice was probably my favorite though. It was topped with a creamed spinach... can't go wrong with that! The only issue I had (and why I knocked a star) is that the fried onion toppings on the thundercat slice were burnt. I took a few pieces off and then it tasted fine.Really nice variety of unusual pizza toppings, and even 2 vegan slices (which I will try at another visit) I also thought the option to "build your own pizza" was a nice feature. Worth a visit!
2021-02-24,4,Pizza was great, well worth the trip. Hero was very flavorful as well. I'll be visiting from Ny again soon.
2021-02-18,4,I would give this place 5 stars but their fries were SOGGY AF and felt like they were made yesterday. And I am a lover of fries so fries are super important to me.Other than that, the food was delicious! I got the jewish cowboy pizza which was honestly soo perfect. It seems heavy but the horseradish cuts the heaviness nicely. I also ordered the bone in brisket sub aka boloney rex. The meat was SOOOOO SOFT and that thing weighs a good amount. I would definitely go again and try their other options (minus the fries)
2021-02-18,3,In my opinion, one of the best places to get wings in Hoboken. But sadly, as the restaurant has gotten more popular over the past few years I've noticed the prices have gone up a lot and the quality has gone down.
2021-02-05,2,I used to love love this place. I would get the jumbo pretzel mozz sticks and fries and was always satisfied. But the recent times I've ordered, the fries are always soggy and the mozz stick are not like they used to be. They are these little tiny things with hardly any cheese in them. I could probably get the same kind of mozz sticks in the frozen aisle of Acme. These things used to be HUGE. Really disappointed with the change and probably won't be coming back.
2021-02-01,5,I am long time fan of this place! Tony Baloney's is the place you go when you want elevate your comfort food / pizza experience. The Winger (basically a Buffalo chicken ranch blue cheese pizza) is incredible! Good ratios of all ingredients, the sauce is a good balance of acidity and flavor, and portions are large. For a higher price point, Tony Baloneys definition offers superior value.
2021-01-27,3,Ok, to be fair I've ordered from this location several times before posting this review. Now, I don't think you can argue that TBs gives you a lot of food for your money. And, I've been diligent about supporting local restaurants, especially during COVID as I know they can use it.But...c'mon. The food is packaged just short of throwing it all in the bag and expecting you to just grab a fork and eat it like a raccoon in a dumpster. And for the love of God!! Stop burning your rolls!!!! There's a knob on the toaster, use it! Again, tasty food, but for F sake, take some pride in packaging it for those of us trying to support you.
2021-01-18,4,Really love it here! Have never had a slice that I didn't completely love. Such unique combinations of food that work so well. Most recently had the Taco pizza which I had seen so much about but never had...did not disappoint! The pizza itself was good and the tacos on top were so good they could have been served as their own entrees. We also got the Pinky and the General Khan. Pinky was good but nothing special. Like the pepperoni, the sauce tasted a little more red than pink. Their slices are definitely more on the "novelty" side, and also priced as such, so wouldn't get it for every day pizza, but a nice treat now and then!
2021-01-10,5,We drive an hour to eat here....for a sandwich or a slice. Great food. Great people who work here. Great prices. I haven't found ANYTHING bad about this place. Amazing!  Sandwich suggestion: THE COMMISSION!!!!  Pizza suggestion: WINGER!!!And even the fountain soda is great. Love this place!!!!
2020-12-18,4,Overall: B+Food: BService: APrice: BGood food overall and would return. Their vegan options are delicious but it's a bit heavy - still too oily and fatty for my liking but not bad.
2020-12-17,4,I did not expect to like the taco slice as much as I did, and for the record I was completely sober. It was definitely my favorite from the different slices I tried, which included the moonshiner and the Bangkok boardwalk. The only thing I didn't like was the Ole cheesesteak, which I found to be a weird combination of flavors. Otherwise, everything I would try again.
2020-12-15,1,This place is gross it's so dirty inside and it's way over hyped . Saw it on YouTube . Thought we try it. Bread was stale it's like they try to add too much to their food to be cool and they end up over doing it and ruining it. IMO
2020-12-14,4,We love Tony Boloney's!! They definitely have the coolest flavors and you definitely get your money's worth because all of their food is HUGE!!! Their food is always yummy, hot, and served fast! This is a place to grab your pizza and go. And a place to try crazy toppings and unique pairings!! They also have their famous taco pizza which of course we had to try!! It definitely is an interesting combo and we we're very happy with it :)
2020-11-20,1,It's in a great spot. However, every time I've passed this place and glanced at the pies on the counter, I've thought to myself  'another over priced, over hyped pizza joint in Hoboken'. This evening I thought I'd try it because ate a heavy lunch and could do without dinner to be honest. I'm soo happy I wasn't hungry. The food was soo bad, that even doggie didn't want it. Cold wings and the celery came soaked in sauce. Garlic bread was a six foot state wrap with a layer of dry cheese. I'd give them minus stars if I could
2020-10-22,4,Finally tried the Taco Taco Taco pizza and it was surprisingly good! Honestly, I wasn't expecting much - maybe just a cool IG photo but I was pleasantly surprised. My husband and I ordered this for a small gathering (post our intimate Hoboken waterfront wedding ceremony!) and it was a hit! I believe there are three types of tacos - chicken, pork and beef. The pork (or beef?) was definitely the best one out of the bunch. An 18'' is $80 but if you order through their site, you can get 10% off. My only gripe was that I ordered for an 11 am pick-up time for a Saturday but when I got there, they were still making it. I ended up having to wait almost 20 minutes.Previously, they only sold this as pies or slices on Tuesdays only, but I read on the menu that slices are now available everyday. I wouldn't mind having a slice right now!
2020-10-08,5,The pizza is really high quality. I've also eaten their Asian chicken sandwich which was messy but incredibly delicious.  I look forward to trying more of their menu.
2020-09-15,4,If you're wanting a speciality slice of pizza this is the place to go. Since COVID and it's been take out my slice has been cold every time I get home, but it may be because it's a 10 minute walk. Slices are good, but not great. Worth it for the experience at least once. The garlic knots ARE AMAZING and totally worth the money.
2020-09-09,5,The manager cuddy gave me a free pizza and a hat for my birthdayExcellent pizza , 10/10
2020-08-27,3,After walking around Hoboken desperately looking for somewhere to eat, me and my partner decided to check out Tony Boloney (after seeing this place on social media). Our game plan was to get a couple slices and go have a picnic by the pier (which was a great idea, I highly recommend). We got slices of the winger pizza-your typical buffalo chicken pizza, and the ducktown - which had a garlic bread base with some ribeye and fresh mutz. I wasn't expecting much from a couple pizza slices but they were pretty darn good. LOVED the garlic bread spread on the ducktown. The winger pizza was pretty alright, I liked the breaded chicken on top with the tangy buffalo sauce. They have a pretty big menu with a lot of interesting pizza flavors. They're known for their taco pizza (which is all over youtube and tiktok) I'd love to try it one day with a group of friends. Sadly there's no outdoor dining but like I said, the pier is just a 10 minute walk with all the seating in the world with a fantastic view! Check this place out if your down for a quick slice to go!
2020-08-24,4,During COVID this place is only open for carry-out, walk-in or call. I was very sad about that after finding out only after I had arrived there. There is no patio dining.  With that being said, they only have pizza by the slice available.  Parking can be a little tight, as there is only metered street parking available which is free after 9PM. They take cash, credit and Apple Pay. There is a constant steady flow of customers here, which is a good sign.Now that is out of the way. My group decided to get some of the to-go slices since we were already there and drove a long way. They have a large assortment of pizzas in the glass and they all looked pretty good.  After accepting the large slice of disappointment of not getting to eat there, I ordered 3 slices: Mex Corn Husker, General Khan, and the Winger.They were delicious. My favorite was the Mex Corn Husker. Everyone in my group agreed. They loved their slices too.  This place is a good spot to get a good slice of pizza. I really came there for the world famous Taco Pizza, but they were not doing that. Damn you COVID.  Maybe next time.
2020-07-13,1,I ordered the Seitan Sandwich. Unfortunately I realized it was meat after I took a bite out of it and was simply told to get the money back from Uber which would not cover the price of the deliver and taxes. I really feel sick right now and I just wanted to try them for the first time.
2020-07-11,3,3 for delivery ... in person I'd give it 4 star because the pizza is good but can be very expensive. I got one slice and it was 8$!
2020-06-29,3,Tony Boloney's is a lot. The flavors can be a bit over the top but if that's what you like than this is a great spot to get food. I would say some options are better than others and you don't need to order a lot because the portions are extremely generous. They operate like any other pizza spot in Hoboken but offer a completely different experience. Worth it for the price but once I ordered a Vegan Pie and they put bacon on it :/.
2020-06-27,4,Great pizza and sub spot. The menu can be a little overwhelming but they have a lot of good options. I've tried the bangkok boardwalk, pancho franco, and magic mushroom slices. All were pretty good. The chips on the pancho Franco was a little weird so I ended up taking them off. Chicken parm sub is good too. The only thing i wouldn't get is the tikka pizza. It's not that spicy and the sauce lacks flavor.
2020-06-21,4,Very solid 4.5. This place makes a great modern take on pizza. As a New Jersey native pizza  is very important to me and tony Boloney's does it right every time. If you don't like thin crust pizza, don't come here because that is their specialty. I love the variety and I know that I'll never get bored coming her. Never change.
2020-06-12,3,Ordered from Tony's twice so far, their food looks so amazing on their instagram so I gave it a try and still would like to actually go to the restaurant and to see if the food would be even better than delivery, plus we want to try the sandwiches. S#tfc3d Chicken Slice was yummy, I really liked that slice and I made it blacked out with bacon pieces and Fritos sooo good especially dipped in ranch  cheese slices we ordered first time around were huge, they could be cut in two to make 4 slices since we did order two slices but the flavor just wasn't there, it was bland. Mozz cheese stick samplers were interesting, fresh mozz which I love but with delivery it wasn't the warm mozz sticks I love so much, so I'd definitely try it at the restaurant but if you live close by to them, I'm sure it'd be much more warmer. Now onto our second delivery, we ordered half cheese half chicken pie...it was ok, nothing special, Seemed a bit undercooked and crust was thing which I don't hate but it was almost soggy like, chicken side was much better in flavor most likely due to the yummy. Hi men on top. I wouldn't order this same pie again, I'd probably try one of the many different yummy sounding flavors they have next time, in store. We also ordered mozz & pepperoni fries, 2e made it our own. I really like the small pepperoni they use! But the fries didn't hit the mark either, bland as well, no salt, soft...again, we MAY try it again in store but one of the many different flavors they have.Overall, I love the idea of the many flavors/creations Tony's carry and would definitely come back to try the slice versions when they open up restaurants again after this pandemic but I wouldn't order delivery again, it just didn't hit the mark for us and we do live about 2 miles from the restaurant so food may not be as warm as if we were to order if we lived in Hoboken.
2020-06-08,5,Love the food and the people! Never disappoints! Get the max slide and the shitfaced sub you won't be disappointed
2020-06-06,2,Found multiple hairs all over pizza, gross!  Other items like fries and sub were fine but I don't think I will order from here again
2020-05-27,3,Overrated, overpriced, inconsistent but decent food.Food prices are expensive. $15 for a sandwich in Hoboken is really steep. The few times I've ordered I found the food to be very inconsistent in size. Two slices of pizza from the same pie and one was half the size of the other. Another slice that was $6 had few to no toppings on it. Food tastes fine, but it'll set you back $$$.
2020-05-16,5,I recently stopped by the original Tony Baloneys in Hoboken, on a Tuesday.  I was in the mood for their famous Taco Pizza slice, which you can only get on Tuesdays.  I had originally tried this at the Jersey City location,  but not this location.  Plus my girlfriend never had this taco pizza slice before.  So, I placed an order online, for pickup, for 2 taco pizza slices, 1 winger slice, and 1 shitfaced chicken slice.  The order was ready in about 20 minutes.  The taco pizza slices looked amazing and were so good. Everything was so fresh and just awesome. We started out eating the tacos first, which I really enjoyed you get 3 different tacos on each individual slice.  The guac and sour cream were nice dipping additions.  Then, the pizza itself was really good too. Just from eating 1 of these tacos pizza slices, it fills you up. We ate the other pizza slices the next day. I love all of Tony Baloneys pizza slices. Such cool combos that just work well on pizza. The Winger is my second favorite after the taco slice. This is now one of my favorite pizza spots and I will be coming back to try many more options of their pizzas and sandwiches.
2020-05-14,3,Was in the Hoboken area and decided to try out Tony Boloney's after seeing their taco pizza online! I ordered for pickup through their website which was easy to navigate and figure out what I wanted to eat. Tony Boloney's has so many different options and I was shocked that they have vegan options too! My sister and I decided to try the Ay Dios Mio-Mac, Moonshiner (margarita), and the vegan ole. We also ordered garlic knots but they ran out so we substituted it for another slice of vegetarian pizza.I'm glad that this location has a vacant space in front, where you're really not supposed to park but since it was for pick up I put my hazards on and picked up my food which took less than 2 minutes LOL! Parking is rough in Hoboken!When we got home we heated up our food and noticed that the substituted slice of pizza had meat on it (we don't eat meat) so we gave it to our dad. We were a bit disappointed that 1. We did not thoroughly check our food and 2. We were given the wrong slice but at least we had other food to try. The Ay Dios Mio-Mac was amazing; creamy and perfect! The Moonshiner was tasty as well but a bit soggy due to our 30-minute drive back home and then putting it in the oven so I think eating it right away would've been better. Now, to the vegan ole (oaxacan marinated seitan, chipotle sauce, vegan string cheese, lettuce, tomato & cilantro). It didn't look appetizing and didn't taste the best either. I ended up scraping off the filling and just eating the bread and tomatoes. It was a bit soggy to which again could be from the 30-minute drive back home.I'm definitely going to try Tony Boloney's out again when quarantine is over!
2020-05-03,5,I love the staff so much. They're so laid back but helpful and sincere. Me and my husband used to come here all the time before this pandemic hit. It's pricey but worth it. The atmosphere is awesome. They play really cool instrumental beats. It's a really cute small place. I haven't tried one thing that I didn't like on the menu.
2020-04-24,1,The only place we've ordered from during the pandemic that hasn't had it together. They said our order would be ready in 30 minutes. My husband went to pick up the order after 35 and had to wait another 30! Around other people! Never again. Everywhere else's is like a well oiled machine. I've waited for TB's in the last but it's not worth endangering my health Edit: after finally receiving the pizza it absolutely didn't match the description. I was so excited to try the "dough exotic" which is a square pie with vodka sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, and balsamic. It was so spicy I couldn't even eat it and there was no prosciutto but what appeared to be Oscar Meyer bologna. What a waste of $40. I will never go back to what used to be my favorite pizza place.
2020-04-23,5,Somehow, I've never written a review for Tony Boloney's! When I lived close by it was my go to spot for a slice. Now with my boyfriend being in Hoboken, I feel like we are here once a month. The menu will be overwhelming but just know their pies are fantastic as are their sandwiches. I don't have a go-to and always want to try something different but am never upset about my choice. Back in the old days (pre-Covid) if I just wanted a slice, I'd usually go in and see what looks good (it all looks good). Our last order was for a pie (Covid order). Half Magic Mushroom and half Jersey Fist Pump... you either love or hate the names. The magic mushroom pie was   mushrooms, dollops of ricotta, mutz and truffle sauce. It was amazing. I ate well past the point of comfort because it was just that good. If you love white pies and you love mushrooms, you will have a hard time finding a better one that this. I stole a bit of the Jersey Fist Pump as well and thought it was great. Peppers, sausage, vodka sauce, smoked mutz, mamma mia. Oh, and the crust, these guys just know pizza. We got it delivered and it did take a little long but no complaints at all, we have literally nowhere to be... One thing is you do have to order online, we tried to call in and they told us they only take online orders. Oh, ONE more thing. They are doing virtual classes! Every Sunday night they do some sort of class online (gnocchi, pizza, mutz making) and you can either pick up or get the kits delivered. I haven't done it yet but think the next pizza making class I'm going to pick up a kit. Thanks for amazing food always!
2020-04-13,5,This is the review specifically for the meatball making class that we took on April 13th 2020. The class was a great deal of fun. And the pasta + meatball were delicious. All the ingredients that Tony baloneys delivers directly to your house as part of the cooking process were fresh and delicious. We noticed before the class occurred that we were missing some spices from the package that we were delivered. When we reached out to Tony baloney's they literally brought them over within 10 minutes and gave us an entire additional bag of ingredients. Which was greatly appreciated. We enjoyed the class with the owner. And his children. He moved quickly but we were able to absorb everything he was saying and made a beautiful bowl of pasta and meatballs. The pasta was homemade! I think the best part is that he is donating a pizza for every one of these kits that he sells and most importantly, it is keeping folks on his payroll. So definitely consider this as an option. It is affordable fun and charitable. And delicious!
2020-04-12,3,I'll start with the pizza. I personally think the ordinary slices are actually pretty good, and better than most of the others. The margarita is tasty, and the pepperoni (pictured) was above average. I've dabbled with some of the fun/drunk pizzas and my feeling is that they're fun with a group as a novelty slice but it's not my cup of tea on a regular basis.Wings are decent, mozz sticks are nothing to write home about.The unsung hero at Tony Boloney's is the Uptown Cobb Salad. It has changed slightly but it's a delicious salad any way you chop it. It likely wouldn't be anyone's first thought when Tony Boloney's comes to mind, but they have my favorite salad in Hoboken. Highly recommend.
2020-04-09,2,Delivery was on time but the pizza was completely burnt. I have ordered from Tony Boloney's jersey city and they have never sent a burnt pizza but clearly Hoboken is not the right choice. Needless to say I couldn't eat it.
2020-04-08,1,Ordered from here twice. Both times I was disappointed. First time was really disappointed in the mozzarella sticks. They were cold and the sauce they came with wasn't good. Second time got a wrap which was average. My one roommate's order came completely wrong. My other roommate's cauliflower tasted way too soggy and even rotten. Called to let them know the order was messed up and they offered money back for the sandwich which was good. Just way too hyped up for sub par food.
2020-03-17,5,Just got their signature sub the "Ole" and it was amazing. If you want a nice greasy tasty sub I highly recommend stopping by and trying one of their cheesesteaks.
2020-03-15,5,This place is so freaking great! Omg I haven't tried one thing I didn't like lol and the owner is a cool down to earth guy! His food concepts are amazing. You must go and try out his slices and even his sandwiches are great the salads are also hearty and yummy
2020-03-13,2,Waaaay over-hyped. I tried this place twice thinking they might have had a bad day the first time.. both times were bad. There are many different options here and some very unique ones (taco pizza, corn pizza) but nevertheless, very average. I would only suggest going here for an instagram picture; other than that, not worth it. There are sooo many ACTUAL good pizza places in Hoboken & Jersey City.
2020-03-12,5,Alright so I thought this would be a basic hole in the wall pizza spot, but this place is actually a real unique gem. They have crazy pizzas that are delicious- I got one with creamed spinach on it called the thundercat, and it was awesome.Not only that, the owner walked by my table and said to my friend "hey is that slice burnt?" It was just barely overcooked, not even noticeable, but the owner insisted on bringing him another slice free, and then gave my other pal a free slice on top of that. True hospitality!
2020-03-08,4,It's a pet peeve of mine when the driver "forgets" the soda in the delivery. It's priced too small to hold the store accountable and too late in the morning for my kind heart to force someone to go all the way back for a soda. But, now I have all this rich food and no relief and refreshing Boylan Birch Beer. it's 4am. this is the umpteenth time yelp is nowhere to be found to assist (more than 10 minute wait)
2020-03-06,5,Updating my previous review back to 5 stars as the missing menu items (due to a delivery service menu error) have now returned!  Tremendous food and flavors at TB's - our favorite place in town!  Thanks Mike!
2020-02-29,1,It's been close to 4 years since I ordered from this place, and today was a good reminder why. Overall I'm not a fan of the food here and find the place itself kinda gross.I ordered a few things to go: Jerzey Jezebel (a "Nashville" fried chicken sub), Tikka wings, and Disco Queen fries. While waiting for my order, one of the workers kept pacing up and down past me. He stopped right next to me, put his index finger inside his ear, and vigorously fingered his ear hole, which I found very unappetizing. In fact, at this point, I was really close to cancelling my order.The only positive thing I can say is that chicken sandwich was actually a pretty tasty combination of ingredients. The only problem was that the main ingredient, chicken breast, was of really low quality. There was some kind of unpleasant, rubbery film underneath the crust. The chicken itself was really firm and chewy. Nashville fried chicken, really? Not even close.The Tikka wings didn't taste like tikka masala whatsoever. Isn't it supposed to have curry in it? Not even close, more like marinara sauce! The chicken itself was unevenly cooked with some parts burnt and just not very good at all.Finally, the fries were mediocre at best. They were really soggy, even with the gravy being on the side. Speaking of which, that was the worst gravy I ever had. I can't believe they can call that gravy. It was more like Italian salad dressing.
2020-02-28,5,Steak sandwiches are the way to go in my professional opinion!! The steak sandwich with french onion soup and gruyere was ridiculous. The other cheesesteak with calabria chili's is bomb! This is perfect hangover food or anytime food really. Another sleeper is the geppeto sandwich with rice balls and it is the most underrated sandwich of all time.  A sandwich with only rice balls doesn't sound good but it works! Try it out!FYI, they sometimes shut down seamless when it gets busy on delivery. Had no idea but tried to order through seamless and it was temporarily closed. Delivery.com was however open so I ordered it through there.  Always spot on here! Check it out!
2020-02-07,5,AMAZING!!!  5 stars really isn't enough.  We had Tony Boloney's cater our holiday party and everything came out great.  They were responsive and professional and the cost was reasonable.  We had everything from the Pinky sh*tfaced slices and the Jersey Jezebul sub.  WOW.  It's so creative how they come up with these ideas.  Will deff be back soon!  We need a location in Staten Island ASAP!
2020-02-06,4,I love the pizzas here. Its on my walk back from the train station and I often have trouble not stopping in for a slice. They have an awesome selection of flavours I havent seen anywhere else.
2020-02-02,5,I had heard briefly about this place and there famous 80 dollar taco pizza. Me and a couple of friends  stopped in one drunken night and it was so worth it. The  pizza is great and they get you in and out of there plus their hours are amazing because they're open till late!
2020-01-26,4,Very good pizza if you're looking for unique and fun toppings! Made Instagram famous from the taco pizza, they also have plenty of other wild options to choose from, so they have something for everyone. Mozzarella sticks are also great!
2020-01-24,1,My order sat there for 20 minutes before they realized. I called ahead and showed up at my time. They asked me to feel them and see if they were ok. They weren't. Used to be my favorite place  in Hoboken but have gone downhill.
2020-01-18,4,My friends and I stopped in here to grab a slice on the way to catch a train. Since it was only 11:30 in the morning, there was almost no one else there. They both got the Mexican corn pizza and I got the Ay Dios Mac. Both were really good and the quirky combinations are novel. I honestly feel  like I could get  ideas for a year's worth's of dinners here.If you've ever  read about the paradox of choice, that's the downside to this place! Looking at the menu there are SO MANY combinations of pizzas, sandwiches, pasta bakes, etc. They all sound so good but how do you decide?! I'd honestly rather them have a handful of specials (like 3 pies, 2 sandwiches per day) because at least  then  it's manageable. Something really cool about this place is that they have a  lot of dishes that you can choose a meatless option for (cauliflower, eggplant, seitan, etc.).
2020-01-03,5,An amazing find! My girl friends and I stopped by since we were craving pizza and I'm so glad we did. The slices were heated up and were a perfect crisp.  We got the moonshiner (a take on margharita) and the mex-corn slice (a cheesy slice with well seasoned corn). The flavor was jam packed and ingredients seemed very fresh (the sauce also looked clearly homemade). We also really appreciated the myriad of vegan options available (pizza, mac and cheese, subs, etc.). The place had a cool vibe and the staff was very friendly- they even gave us a free order of garlic knots! I would definitely come back!
2019-12-22,2,This place was hyped up, but it's just average. We went into the shop ordered the food, and the service was horrible! It took 40 minutes for the food, and $100. The staff seemed like they did not care you were there as I was trying to order and they were Turing away, and kept asking is that all after everything I said. There was nothing there that would make me go back. I can go anywhere and receive the same food. I tried their quirky things and nothing was exciting just ordinary. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this place!
2019-12-21,2,Will pull out fresh slices from the oven and still give you cold slices. This place don't deserve more stars because night they're trying to screw you.
2019-12-17,5,when in hoboken its always a good idea to stop at tony baloneys....love the decor and the vibe of thia small place with a great menu...5 stars
2019-12-13,4,The short: -tons of options and interesting pairings-delivers into the wee hours of the early morning-reliable food-you're paying for all of that creativityThe long: Tony Boloney's calls itself "Atlantic City Style" food, and it's menu is comprised of creative, delicious combinations. They offer pizza, subs, burritos, salads, wings, fries, pasta bakes, mozzarella sticks, appetizers, mozzarella and more. Quite the mouthful - Are you stuffed just from reading that?!I originally discovered Tony Boloney's as a meat-eating college freshman craving my week's allotment of carbohydrates during 1AM study session. Sorry for drooling - I'm thinking of the delicious Jamaican jerk chicken nestled in warm bread combined with the brightness of sweet juicy pineapple. Alas, that item has since been removed from the menu and I don't eat meat. But don't fret! Their menu is pages and pages and pages long. If you have the stamina to read through it all, you're sure to find an amazing item and laugh along the way. Otherwise, walk in for a quite bite and select from their prepared slices. And for my fellow non meat eaters! There is hope! If you're tired of eating a basic mutz and tomato sub and looking for variety and flavor, Tony's gotcha covered. They currently have FOUR vegan sub options which include eggplant meatballs, seitan, falafel, and cauliflower. These can also be substituted into any of their sandwich offerings, allowing you to transform practically anything vegetarian/vegan.
2019-12-12,1,( Two stars from me is an average experience based on quality of food and price. )Ordered a Hawaiian Pizza.  It was burnt. From reading other reviews, it appears that this place may have good customer service as far as trying to make up for poor quality of food and service.  ( This is good. )  However, selling burnt food to a customer without just throwing it away in the first place is wrong.  ( This is bad. )It could just be a bad night, but rarely have I seen good food from establishments that will sell burnt food to customers.  Usually this is a sign of inconsistency.I am surprised by all the good reviews.  For the price, I would pass on this place.
2019-12-08,5,The best pizza in Hoboken and one of the best if you count NYC as well. The owner is super nice and we love to pop in for a quick lunch snack. The pizza we will be always coming back to.
2019-12-08,4,Another late night order was a success- ordered around 12am and was delivered by 1am...not terrible. I got 2 slices of my favorite and an order of fries extra crispy with no salt. To my surprise that is exactly what I received! I haven't ordered from TB in quite sometime but I'm SO glad I did. It was the perfect ending to long day of drinking. Would recommend for late night eats!! Also get Ay Dios Mac Slice (has a little spicy kick but in the best way) and vodka/mozzarella slice, my fav!
2019-11-26,4,Love their selection of slices, I suggest the Hoboken over the J.C, because of the better selection. Went on a Saturday afternoon to Hoboken location and loved their Bacon/Egg and the Avocado slice. The SH#TFACED chicken slice is really good! I suggest order Blue Cheese on the side and topping it off, so good.
2019-11-18,4,The pizzas are hella expensive, $17.50 for a small, but everyone knows this going into Tony Boloney's. It's definitely not even close to an "every so often" meal for me because I live so far away from all the locations. However while up in JC/Hoboken, it was a no brainer to stop there for a meal. My bf got the ducktown pizza and I got the tikka pizza. He really enjoyed his pizza, but in my opinion mine was astronomically better. The tikka and paneer were AMAZING, and the pizza tastes very authentic to Indian food. I can't wait to have my left overs for dinner tonight!
2019-11-10,1,I ordered what I thought was a gluten free pizza (I have celiacs disease). I ate a slice only to find out that the pizza we got delivered was in fact not gluten free and I ate a regular slice. I am not looking forward to being sick from this. This is also not the first time this has happened when ordering.
2019-11-01,1,Very dissatisfied with this experience. Order slices from jersey city store all the time no problem. First time doing delivery from Hoboken and what a nightmare!Food was way too overpriced for this terrible experience. Waited almost an hour for the food, Almost $80 worth of delivery and they didn't even show up with the pizza and the the two apps we ordered showed up ice cold and wrong. Ordered the mozz stick sampler and just got a regular order.  Cold. Called the shop and about the pizza and was told the driver gave it to another house. Waited another hour for the pizza. Not worth the money or the hype. Won't be back.
2019-10-20,1,For the second time in a month, received my delivery 30+ minutes late. This time, they claimed to call my phone, but didn't receive any calls. When they finally delivered the food, the wings were missing(50% of the food). This is the last time my friends and I will get food here
2019-10-15,4,Got the chicken Parmesan sandwich and it was very tasty but also very filling. Make sure you don't order too much! The indian style chicken tikka pizza is alright though, but everything else is pretty good
2019-10-12,5,My favorite pizza spot in Hoboken, NJ. It's also opened til late. My favorites are Magic Mushroom and BangKok. My sons' favorites are sh#tfaced & casino carnivore.
2019-10-06,5,Awesome sauce!!! I traveled to try this pizza for my birthday and it was worth it. I don't eat meat and they were able to accommodate me with yummy veggie tacos for half of the pizza. This thing is huge and I probably should have only gotten a slice but I'm driving back home with 2 to-go boxes and yummy smells drafting through the car
2019-10-03,3,The location is nestled a little off beat from main Washington St which I liked. There is a good amount of seating and the weather was nice so they had the front entrance glass opened up.This is a pizza parlor on steroids, maybe literally. The menu took me 20 minutes to read, it's borderline overwhelming. The weird thing was, a few things on the menu weren't even available. The food itself was good, the pizza we tried was a Buffalo Chicken Sicilians, a Traditional Grandma Slice, and their famous OLE(Chicken) SandwichThe best thing was the regular pizza slice. The chicken sandwich was a mess, a bigger roll would of solved a lot of the issues. The buffalo chicken suffered the same fate a lot of pizzerias face, heating it the same time as a regular slice, which makes them just barely hot/warm.The menu is insane, and the food was filling, can't say I wouldn't return if I'm in the area, but for now; I'm good.
2019-09-28,5,I have tried Plain cheese slice few times but it has way too much salt in the sauce so not a fan of that but I like their Tex Mex slice.
2019-09-19,1,A slice of a specialty of pizza without meat was so  salty and I felt nauseous after eating. The most disgusting aspect was the price for a slice and small fountain soda costing $7.75. Too bad Hoboken doesn't have a Two Boots which is less expensive and much better quality. If you're starving and looking for something quick easy keep walking because starving is a better option.
2019-09-19,4,Update: my initial review was too harsh. I kept going back because the food is that good. Moving to 4 stars to be fair.
2019-09-09,4,Tony Boloney's is truly a staple in Hoboken, and I believe better than more NYC by the slice places. I went for a late-night snack on a Friday and there was not a line. We placed our order immediately and had to wait about 5 minutes for them to heat up our slices. The pizza is delicious every time - they always have lots of interesting slices that contain delicious combos I wouldn't think of. The pizza comes out so hot from the oven it's almost too hot to eat. My only complaint is that the pizza can be a bit greasy sometimes. Otherwise, really great place and excellent pizza!
2019-09-07,2,Interesting and different pizza toppings, but extremely overpriced. Hard to support a business that charges such a ridiculous premium to every other pizza place.
2019-08-29,5,This place is great ... amazing creative pizzas and subs . Get the cheesesteak ole. Don't sleep on the salads. The boken girl salad sooo good.They also have the best wings in Hoboken.Can
2019-08-28,5,Not sure why all the bad reviews. My boyfriend and I come here pretty often. Our favorite place for pizza of all time! Every time we come here, no matter what time or day, we get amazing service!! They are fast and professional. We LOVE Tony Boloney's!!! Highly recommend them. BEST pizza ever! We've had nearly all of their pizzas haha. Taco tuesdays are bomb and the buffalo chicks and BBQ slice is delicious. Tonight we had buffalo, bbq, French onion soup (what?!), and margarita slices. Prices aren't bad except the taco pizza but look at all you get with that! It's three tacos and guacamole and pizza...filling! All of our slices were perfect tonight. Vito's has better mutz but Tony's is ok..better on the pizzas! Bought some goat mutz to go tonight. Can't wait to try it! We love all of the unique slices and flavors here! Can't wait to try their wings and sandwiches. The Mac slice tastes JUST like a Big Mac haha. We have never had a burnt slice or bad service! The tables are always clean, the employees are amazing at keeping up with everything! Friendly and always amazing! Consistent and we recommend Tony's to EVERYONE!!Tried the Ole Burrito. It's also amazing!!! Has a little heat with the steak and got it on a whole wheat wrap. Delicious!!!
2019-08-27,4,I'm giving this place a 4 out of 5 only because I've ordered here many times and one out of three times I'll order a wrap and get a sub, which wouldn't be a big deal if it was an isolated incident but I can't help but to see a trend. I can no longer do delivery because of this.I went in on a Sunday on the later side and ta da. I have a sub and not a wrap. Totally fine, used to it, food is delicious. I'm not mad. I just want it fixed, this guy behind the counter was extra for no reason however Rob was perfect in intervening and rectifying the situation. He even went into telling me how favorite items for next time. 5 start service, 4 star accuracy, 5 star selections, 6 star quality.
2019-08-26,3,Always heard so much about Tony Boloney's! 1. Burrrrr-ata slice : I always believed the burrata would burst and spread across the entire slice. Was wrong. It's not as appealing in reality as in the video. 2. Grandma patti slice: it's a three cheese pizza with three with basil. Better than burrrr-ataAlmost 5$ for a thin crust pizza slice is a lot.
2019-08-25,5,The manager was so nice! I placed a large order very late at night and he did not give me a hard time. He was so friendly! Furthermore, the food was delivered on time, nice and hot, and good quality. This was my first time eating here -- I will be back! Ps the Mac and cheese pizza is so good!
2019-08-24,2,Buffalo chicken wrap was awful. The sauce (which there was way too much of) didn't taste like ranch and the ratio of hot sauce was weak. Tasted like a gross chicken ranch wrap.
2019-08-24,4,Ashamed they wouldn't make us a taco taco taco pizza day of. We came all the way from DC just for this pizza. SMH. Also, asked for the WiFi password for the guest WiFi that shows up on phones and am told "the owner doesn't give that out" well then don't fucking put guest WiFi up as a network. Really needed an update SMH again.  Haven't tried the food yet.. will be updated in time.I've now had the pizza and I am upping the review because it was good.
2019-08-22,3,Very clean, good selections. Giving a 3 because the Marinara sauce was too salty, I couldn't eat my pizza.
2019-08-21,2,We ordered delivery from this place.They called after half an hour and informed us about the unavailability of the pizza we ordered and we had to choose a different one on phone.When we finally got the pizza..The crust was very oily and soggy.The toppings were okay.this place is definitely not worth the price nor hype.Never ordering from here again.
2019-08-09,5,That's a fancy cheesesteak!  The restaurant is a convenient walk from just about anywhere in Hoboken.  It's smallish but seems like it could handle a reasonable group.  We got ours to go.I got the Ole as it was the "I won a bunch of awards" sandwich that everyone was talking about.  This thing is huge!  It's not the type of philly I'm used to so I'll just say it was not what I expected.  It was excellent though!  Lots of flavor and the bread thick which kept my hands clean (mostly).I will be coming back to try out more on the menu and will update my review as I do.
2019-07-27,5,The pizza took double to time but it was worth it the taco pizza was amazing. The tacos were just as good as an authentic taco place. Will order again for a special occasion
2019-07-27,1,UPDATE:Tony reached out to me apologizing for his employees and told me to ask for a manager next time. Then promised to send a T-Shirt and a $25 gift card. Never did I receive the gifts he said he was going to send. Regardless i still decided to give them another try, and this time I asked for a manager as suggested. The food still came out wrong! I also messaged Tony to let him know I didn't get anything in the mail. He said "that's odd I'll send it again". STILL NOTHING - LOL This place, it's owner, & all they're employees are a JOKE. WORST SERVICE & EMPLOYEES EVER!!! I've lived in Hoboken a long time & ordered from Tony baloney's many MANY times before because the food for the most part is amazing!! I've even told all my clients, family & friends about it. Well, after tonight I'll have to update them. If you order something simple like fries, it's not hard to get wrong. I order the SAME thing - every time. Pizza WELL WELL EXTRA WELL BURN THE PIZZA WELL DONE. Please. And no blu cheese on the salad because I'm allergic. After I write these notes in my online order I then CALL them to reconfirm they saw the notes. (Since I know from experience they usually don't read them) I just landed from a long flight and am starving... and craving good pizza. I call 3 minutes after placing my order, a girl named Erica picks up and I explain to her that last time (and the time before that) the same thing happened, I wrote the note AND called and it still came out wrong. I asked her to please please follow those instructions because I'm SO hungry and don't want to wait for another delivery if it comes out wrong. She assured me that she'll tell the kitchen right now so it doesn't happen again. 45 min later the pizza comes UNDERDONE & WITH BLU CHEESE!!! Can't catch a break. I call back - & ask for Erica, she's busy, I ask for the manager, he's busy. I explain my problem to the girl who seems like she could care less & she said well, when it went out it looked fine to us. Unbelievable. She cuts me off mid sentence to put me on hold, tells the manager and he sends another pie. This time it comes out well done. So at least they rectified it but why should anyone have to go through this terrible process time and time again? - I had to wait another 45 min for the right order to come out. Guess I should just learne lesson - 3x a charm?Never ordering from them again. Which is a shame because I'm an awesome customer. Just get my order right and I'll buy your food all day every day.
2019-07-20,2,I have ordered delivery and taken out pizza from Tony Baloneys a handful of times in the last year and after my pizza order last night decided I need to find another gourmet pizza place in HBKN.  While the delivery arrived within the hour of ordering with a polite delivery person the pizza itself was sub par.  Not hot nor cold, the pizza lacked flavor, seemed to be missing the smoked mozzarella.  The eggplant on the pizza was more raw than cooked.   I expect more from a $23.50 pizza.  This was your last chance Baloney.
2019-07-19,1,I ordered from them via seamless. They called me twice that they were out of ingredients to make what I ordered. I modified it. After waiting an hour and 45 minutes for my order, I called to cancel. I was told I would have to pay for half even though most of it wasn't what I initially ordered and they missed their estimated time by 45 minute. I truly love TB's but I've never experienced service as bad as this. I'll never order from them again.
2019-07-05,1,This is the second time I've ordered from Tony Baloney's and they've disregarded dietary restrictions and ended up sending food that I couldn't eat. If they're not going to look at special requests, they may as well not be on delivery sites. Seriously, how hard is it to see that I requested an Eggplant Parm sandwich instead of Chicken Parm?
2019-07-01,1,Was excited to try as I live around the corner - came by this past Sunday around 1pm and ordered 2 sandwiches. There were a few other people in and out, mostly eating slices. I waited and waited and waited - about 30/40 min in, i checked on the progress and was told the sandwiches were still in the works. 20 min later and still nothing - not cool!I asked for my money back, which was given without a question, and a free slice.I understand the location is still pretty new, but I hope management gets things running better. It would be a shame for the store to not do well in a high traffic area. Food sounds great, but I'm not sure when i will try to go back.
2019-06-29,4,if you are looking for pizza, this is the place! Best pizza place in hoboken. We had the tikka and veggie; both were good. Crist was very thin just as you would expect in nyc pizza. Chicken wings were not very good. The taste was bland and were not cooked properly. Guess they are the best in pizza and only pizzas.
2019-06-29,1,My Brotherly love cheesesteak was absolutely horrible!!! I ordered for pickup through DoorDash. When I unwrapped my sandwich the cheese wiz literally was all over the outside of the bread. I'm appalled at how poorly it was made/wrapped and to charge so much for that catastrophe of a sandwich is mind boggling.
2019-06-28,3,I like how they have many interesting flavors. Though a bit pricey, the slices were huge. We ordered 5 slices with 5 flavors. I remember I liked the Pancho Franco and the pad Thai ones the best. They all taste very interesting. Bread was a little dry and burned. Overall a very memorable pizza flavor try out experience.
2019-06-26,1,Been living in Hoboken for over 8 years, do not go here. Their food is disgusting, their service is awful. Good luck trying to call and actually talk to anyone there, they will put you on hold for 30minutes (not exaggerating )
2019-06-22,1,Not a fan of tony baloney in AC. Salad came without chicken, one of the pizza's wasn't warm and fries were soggy. Definitely not worth $75! When I called to let the manager know he offer to comp me $1.50. I said "keep you're change". Never ordering from there again.
2019-06-20,5,Ordered through Grubhub...paid $60+ for two soggy AND burnt (almost impressively bad) pizzas. Between the charcoaled cremated corn and low-grade bbq chicken...they were both inedible.This one star should go to Joe's PeTea, as that seems to be the only good thing left on the menu.Can't speak for the eat in experience, but stay away from delivery. Update: Gotta say...customer service saved the day and made up for the bad experience! Humble, honest, friendly & accommodating. I have since re-ordered...and they nailed it. Thank you tony for saving the day and keeping your standards high (for both the pizza & customer service)
2019-06-19,5,Thank you for writing Happy Father Day on the box like I requested ! You guys are the best
2019-06-18,5,Okay, I don't know who would talk badly about this place because it's freakin delicious! The Ay Dio Mios-Mac, the Pancho Franco, the Winger. Literally all of my favorite things in one. Crabby fries, their salads, all delicious as well. Love trying something new every time I'm there and haven't been disappointed yet. My goal is to try the entire menu. I'll be backkkkk.
2019-06-17,1,I ordered 2 subs and a side. ONLY 3 ITEMS. They only got 1 of the three items right. It's not that hard but I guess it is for them. EDIT: They brought the 2 items 40m later. But one was still wrong! Good food though, just don't expect to get what you ordered
2019-06-17,5,OH MY GOODNESS! The tikka pizza was fantastic! We ordered a small tikka pie and a large Oldman Brooklyn, we should've gotten two tikka pies! We were so impressed how the combination of the tikka wasn't overly powerful but still held up to the texture of pizza! Definitely ordering this each time.
2019-06-16,1,This place advertises themselves​ as having "badass​s food" however,​ it is more like bad and ass food.I have never in my life had the​ worst meal. They are insanely overpriced for food poising. I should have been paid to eat there instead.Their truffle mozzarella​ sticks don't​​ taste like truffle but rather expired biter cheese.I could have also made better french fries in my microwave than theirs and it would not have cost me $6 for soggy gross fries.My friend also ordered original mozzarella​ sticks and was not informed that their "original" mozzarella​ sticks are their pretzel mozzarella​​ sticks, which were just pure awful and had no resemblance​ to pretzels. Save your money and digestive system and eat elsewhere.
2019-06-15,1,DO NOT ORDER MOZZARELLA STICKS! I used to love their pretzel crusted mozz sticks to the point where I was raving about them saying they were the best mozzarella sticks I have ever had! I ordered them for lunch this afternoon and could not have been more upset. They are a quarter of the size and just looked overall, sad. I called the restaurant to see if there was some sort of mistake, but unfortunately there was not. They are "working on the recipe" because "some people did not like all the breading". They took one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten, and turned it into one of the most disappointing and sad looking dishes I have ever seen. Will not be ordering from Tony Boloney's for a long, long time.
2019-06-09,3,Ok so I have made two trips to tony baloney's in Hoboken.  For the most part I am satisfied as far as food quality goes.  My first trip was the burrata pie, which is my favorite thing I ordered there thus far.  The mozzarella sticks are great and their fries are also good.  My girlfriend ordered the crab and chicken sandwich (I forget the name), both times and really enjoyed that.  One thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that I ordered the winger pizza (Buffalo and blue cheese crumbles and ranch) my second outting, but with cauliflower rather than the chicken, because I don't eat chicken.  They were kinda busy so I had to wait a while which is understandable.  However when I did receive my pizza they put chicken on it.  I could tell it was chicken just by looking at it.  The guy at the counter insisted that it was cauliflower.  So I had to pry through it and show him the stringy meat and that it was obviously chicken.  After that he still tried to say that, "it looks like chicken but it is cauliflower."  I'm not an asshole nor do I like to make a scene but I am certainly not naaive either.  So after the third attempt and just before I was about to blow a gasket he finally took it back and made me a new one with what was finally distinct cauliflower florets.   Good food but that experience caused them to lose brownie points in my book.  I still don't know why it was like pulling teeth for a place with multiple vegan and vegetarian options to produce cauliflower. ‍
2019-05-29,5,I liked the thin crust mushroom pizzas here. Service was fast and friendly. The mozzarella cheese was so fresh you can taste the difference.
2019-05-27,1,Terrible! Got the boken boy sandwich!!! No fresh chicken cutlets  instead they gave fried chicken and got hard bread
2019-05-26,4,One of the better pizza places, I've had the chance to eat at. The service is pretty great and they take instructions really seriously, LIKE really seriously. Would definitely recommend if in Hoboken or in Jersey City
2019-05-26,1,I don't know why you got one star rating cash I'm told that you can't give me back change there's no No ice I paid for a full glass of soda I get a coffee cup begrudgingly and I looked upon that I am from outer space when I want to change displayed you can count this as a -5 star
2019-05-25,4,Tried this place twice. First time - walked in and the pizza was really good. Second time we did delivery and pizza was soggy on the bottom so I had to eat with knife and fork. It still tasted good, but didn't travel well. We also did an order of the Phuket fries - huge portion and delicious!!
2019-05-19,1,Worst food I have ever had. Overpriced and distasteful. I ordered chicken parm with pasta, it appeared the chicken stayed in the kitchen. $ 19.90 for a piece of garbage. Total ripoff
2019-05-18,3,Never been to the actual restaurant but ordered multiple times online. Food is great! But taking 2 stars off as it can take a really long time to get the food delivered. Wish they would add more delivery ppl on their team. Will try going to the restaurant soon to see the service in house.
2019-05-16,4,This very nice fast casual dining place was great for what we needed in Hoboken. They have a very in-depth menu and a lot of stuff can be prepared quickly. Expect a little bit longer if you're ordering a specialty pizza.The fry order is very large and shareable, or a meal in itself. The garlic aioli sauce was pretty good but next time I might try their more adventurous flavors.They also serve specialty local fountain sodas.The staff was friendly and food quality was a whole lot better than a standard pub restaurant. I imagine this is very much a go-to spot for the locals for something easy, fast, and tasty.
2019-05-08,1,I have never ever written a review on Yelp, ever. But this place was so bad and just absolutely terrible, I wanted people to know. Wings were overcooked so much they were like charcoal, sandwiches were filled was some unidentifiable goopy slop, I took one bite and threw the rest away. Fries were completely soggy and also disgusting. No problem, I will simply never ever order from here again given there are literally 4 better options merely a few yards away from this place. It will be gone within a year, it simply cannot compete given the slop they are serving. So gross, so disappointed, so disgusting.
2019-05-04,5,Delicious vegan options! Highly recommend the seitan sandwiches and salads. Can't wait to try a pizza!
2019-04-25,5,Love this place. One of the few (if only) places in Hoboken that does vegan pizza. I had the "Veatball That Mama Never Made" pizza. It is an eggplant meatball, breadcrumb, herbs vegan pizza. To make it a bit healthier, I had it on whole wheat crust. It was delicious. I have had wheat crust pizza in other places in Hoboken and it was always tough like cardboard. This place, the wheat dough was perfect and flavorful. The herbs mixed with the breadcrumb / eggplant topping was yummy. I will be excited to try their other Vegan options. Plus its a two minute walk from my house. Thanks Tony!
2019-04-22,4,I was inclined to think that my level of exposure to Hoboken frat culture was already high enough without patronizing a place with a menu item entitled "Shitfaced." And I'm no fusion enthusiast.But I'm glad I checked out Tony Boloney's, where the Ole sandwich was an appealing, spicy riff on the cheesesteak and service was fast and friendly. When 1am food usually means pizza or diners, I'm intrigued by the long list of menu permutations.
2019-04-22,5,The baloney in this place is amazing. Would totally recommend that you come and try a slice of this baloney. Be it a piece of a slice, a crumb off the floor or even the spit of an employee after a lewd remark, anything consumed here will surely be a delicious and fond memory. I'll definitely return!
2019-04-20,4,Everything's great they have a wide assortment of options for everybody and really unique flavors. My only gripe is that if you order anything other than a pizza slice it takes a whole century just to get it to you even just five boneless wings.
2019-04-19,1,I ordered Tony Boloney's for delivery last night and never received my food. I called the restaurant multiple times to check on my food and no one answered. I was very disappointed at one point, however when Tony B himself saw this post he contacted me to fix the problem. I very much appreciated that and look forward to ordering from them again in the future.Tonight, I finally got my first order of Tony Boloney's using the gift cards Tony B sent me and it was overall good! The best thing I ordered was the Boken Girl salad, it was a very filling salad with lots of arugula, delicious battered chicken with two kinds of cheeses and sopressata, along with a very light oil dressing. It was absolutely delicious! My boyfriend had the Jezebel sub which aside from him mentioning it might be 2000 calories, it was very tasty, though it was loaded with grits and didn't have much chicken on it. And lastly, we ordered a sampler of the mozzarella sticks which were alright. I wouldn't recommend getting mozzy sticks from here, at least for delivery.  I'm glad I was finally able to get Tony B's!
2019-04-06,1,Went to experience Tony Boloney's pizza after seeing many videos and advertisements.  Me and my fiancé traveled an hour and were pleased to see it empty as we walked it.  We placed our order 2 slices each and 2 knots.  We experienced the worst customer service in our very short time.  After 10Minutes we asked if our slices were ready and they had no idea what we ordered.  We told them again and they seems confused. They kept asking if we ordered Slices that we didn't. The peopleWorking did not apologize and instead were rude when we told them "no, that's not what we ordered. "  We were getting increasingly annoyed and the multiple people working had zero cares in the world. After they finally got our order correct we were so disappointed and disgusted honestly at the service we got.  It was empty, it was just two of us and 4 slices.  I understand that mistakes happen, but an apology didn't come out of anyone's mouth.  Instead we got attitude for asking for the correct slices.  We didn't even eat there. We told them we traveled an hour and still no apology or regard to the crappy service we were receiving.  We were so annoyed and obviously they didn't care about us being patrons, we got our pizzas to go and just left them in the car.  We found another place to eat nearby and had amazing food and great service.  Advertisements and videos bring people from far, don't do all that if you are going to great people with bad customer service.
2019-04-05,3,I have eaten here before and the pizza is awesome. Would recommend if you plan to go here do pick up.  The only issue I have with this place is the delivery timing.  Granted we did order late at night, but no expectation were set for the timing and when we asked about when we should expect it the person on the phone hung up.  It took over 2 hours and 6 phones calls to get a response on the pizza.  And when the pizza came it was on the cool side. Love the pizza disappointed in the responses provided. If the pizza was going to take that long to come just let us know up front. 4/5 - Since this post they have reach out and said their apologies which was greatly appreciated.  Give them a shot the pizza is awesome.
2019-03-31,4,Welcoming a new pizza takeout favorite in the neighborhood. Absolutely love their tikka pizza with a few extra jalapeños for that spicy touch. A little pricey than your Dominos or Papa Johns but definitely worth it! They Vegan and GF options too ! I have also tried a few other pizzas here and I can vouch for their flavor to be on point always. Give their Mexican corn husk a try.  I usually like my pizza with a side of wine and a good movie so probably have no complains about how quaint their place is.
2019-03-31,4,Finally took a trip here to see if it lived up to the hype I'd seen online. The slice I was initially wanted (Mother Italy Proud) was sold out, which was a bummer, so I settled for a few alternatives. All of them were solid, especially the burrata slice. Wings were very good, and if you have room for dessert, I recommend the Carney balls.
2019-03-30,2,Usually Tony Baloneys is one of my go-to late night pizza spots. Their slices are very creative and generally really good! I ordered the Burro burrito last night for dinner (not "late night," like actual dinner...) thinking it was a pretty ordinary Mexican style wrap, and it was SO rich, I was a bit taken aback by the cream sauce on it. I couldn't even finish it because I was feeling sick from it....cut to a few hours later, and I ended up throwing up multiple times overnight due to food poisoning. I wanted to privately message the business about this, but I couldn't find an email, and i also kind of figure it should be public knowledge. Like i said, pizza is really unique and good and I've never personally had issues with it, but maybe stay away from the other menu options. :(
2019-03-29,3,A group in my office decided to order from here to see what all the hype was about... The food turned out to be a bit disappointing. We all pretty much agreed that it was just OKAY. The crust of the pizza is really thin, which I didn't expect, and the fries were alright I guess. I won't necessarily be going back again, but I'm at least glad I tried.
2019-03-29,4,This place is insane. I think I had a 4 cheese, mushroom and onion slice, maybe some other Mexican one too? Can't tell if they change up their menu often. Anyway, incredible pizza. Reeeeeaally long wait for delivery.
2019-03-28,5,A staple of Hoboken. Is this the best pizza I've ever had? No. BUT they are creative, have tons of unique options, and make a pretty great pizza. I've been once before and wasn't super impressed, but got delivery tonight and thought it was good. Again, not the absolute best pizza I've ever had, but I was able to get the unique toppings I wanted and tried something new that I couldn't get at any of the other traditional pizza shops. The garlic knots are good. I'll probably go again and try a variety of slices.
2019-03-26,1,The reason reason why the place is trendy is cause they make "cool pizzas" but it's overpriced and doesn't taste good. 12.50? For a taco pizza that's completely oily and gives cold low quality look tacos? Never again
2019-03-22,5,The NICEST people ever!!!!!  Just got off the phone with a young lady named Gisselle.  She was incredibly nice and accommodating.  We are a little bit out of the delivery zone. We told them we heard so much about them and asked if they can go out of there way since we are new to the neighborhood. They are on there way!!! Me and my wife are very excited !  THANK YOU GISSELLE!!!!!!!  Side note.  Me and my wife were dancing to the hold music on speaker phone.  It's the owner rapping apparently
2019-03-17,1,Horrible horrible service and management, so bad to the point I had to open up a yelp account just to let everyone know how bad your so called "restaurant" really is. Yelling at a customer after you screw up a delivery order. Would give this zero stars if I could
2019-02-23,1,Took the family last week for some pizza... We all ended up with a case of food poisoning. Either your not cooking chicken properly or someone isn't washing their hands. I'm questioning going back after that experience.
2019-02-20,5,Variety and taste is nice. Have tried Tikka pizza and corn husk. I found the flavor to be good every time. My friends liked the other pizzas too. But I preferred to stick to Tikka/mexican corn husk after trying a couple of others. It has become a go-to place for us. The shop is pretty small though. So if you have a big group its hard to get a place during evening hours.
2019-02-20,5,Great pizza but even better were the wings! Best wings I've ever had hands down! If you get a chance, get your wings "shitfaced"! We were staying in NJ, visiting NY from around the DC area. We will definitely return when we're in the area. Great little gem!
2019-02-12,5,Amazing pizzas!! We usually have the paneer tikka pizza which is awesome and one of a kind. The place itself is small but service was nice. Last time we went in the owner was so sweet and even made us a special pizza which was off the menu.It is definitely a bit pricey but so worth it!!
2019-02-10,3,Its kinda what I expected to be....not super bad but not the best thing I ever had, it is...really...okaySmall place, bathroom is in the back area behind counter.  Fountain soda at your own service and what not.  Still a pretty chill vibeOrdered 4 slices cause we couldn't decide which one we wanted so why not.  Order the truffle mozz sticks with marinara sauce and a soda.  Total 35$ soooo it wasn't super pricyOrdered theWingerShitfacedBangkokMex-cornTruffled Mozz SticksWinger - buffalo chicken with bleu cheese - i have to say...this is one of my favorite one of the 4.  The buffalo sauce was not too much, just enough to taste it and have to feel like you drank a bottle of franks red hot.  The bleu cheese is in between bites, so it was layered for buffalo sauce and bleu cheese.  The only comment i have to say is that i didnt like how the chicken taste.  It was definitely cooked when they baked it off and to reheat the food made the chicken super dry and hard.Shitfaced - bbq chicken - note to others - do not eat the bangkok before...im sure the pizza was good...when has BBQ chicken pizza ever gone wrong? but man it was too much sweetness one after the another...but the pizza was a bit on the sweeter side...didnt taste any kick or anything...same problem with the chicken as the first pizzaMex-Corn - finally something to give me a different tastebud from all the heavier pizza - its okay, i thought the flavors blended well but they werent heighten...so it was almost like....hi im here but i dont want to be outstanding.  I think they should have used sweet corns so it help brings out the flavorsBangkok - thai flavor pizza - this pizza is a lot going on...its sweet and spicy...and so much sauce that it became an overkill.  In fact, way too salty...couldnt really enjoy it but it wasnt bad if they turn down a notch with all that flavor.All in all, the pizzas were okay...they were interesting to eat...i wouldnt go to Hoboken just for it but eh...if i was hungry and it was around..sure.  My only thing with the pizza is that chicken being overcooked and the pizza crust.  It tasted like day old pizza crust so it wasnt bad....but it tasted like a day old pizza crust lol.Truffle Mozz Sticks - i have to say...they were better than i expected.  The mozzarella were plentiful and fresh...not like the one bite and no cheese pull kinda deal.  And you can taste that the cheese wasnt the ones you buy at the super market and cut into sticks....And the truffle is blended into the cheese which was nice and aromatic.  The batter could have gone with some herbs to bring out more flavors but overall...it was one of the best thing i had in the whole experience
2019-02-06,5,Funny story about this place, was staying in jersey city and my cousin and I were on the hunt for curly pepperoni. This place popped up on Instagram and we headed over to Hoboken. Stopped by a thrift shop on the way to Tony Boloneys where we actually met the owner(super sweet guy). We got the pepperoni pizza and some garlic rolls, the owner gave me a slice for free, knowing I was out of town (the Mexican corn) omg sooo good! Couldn't even take a pic Bc I inhaled it!! The slices were not expensive at all. The more extravagant pizzas that you cannot get anywhere else, are more expensive but they are worth it. It's a cool, small place to enjoy a great slice and you can walk it off after hahah or you can just order and go. Crazy pizza ideas that you've never seen are in Tony Boloneys!!! Great service and even better pizza.
2019-01-25,4,Got the most decent matza ball soup in Hoboken for delivery. The price is steep but when you want matza ball soup... you want matza ball soup $$$
2019-01-19,4,We came here for Taco Tuesdays. It was my birthday so I convinced my friends (well i don't think i had to really convince them), to come eat this Taco pizza with me. I pre-ordered it on the phone with my credit card, and it takes about 35-40 minutes. If you are driving, prepare yourself a few extra minutes to find a street parking spot. We came around 8pm and the few tables there were filled, but luckily we snagged a table for the 4 of us a few minutes later. The taco pizza is HUGE! Yes $80 seems like a lot but each of us could only eat one slice each. The tacos on the pizza were very good. I reheated a slice the next day and it was still delicious. A great novelty pizza. We will be back for a different specialty pizza in the future!
2019-01-11,4,It's not gourmet, but at 1am I'm looking for greasy, tasty, and fast, and Tony Baloney certainly hits that spot
2019-01-06,4,Can't go wrong here! My boyfriend used to live in Hoboken and lived off of "tobos" cheesesteaks so whenever we're back, he insists we stop to pick up food. I'm not into cheesesteaks or super unhealthy greasy foods and expected to not like anything, but their salads are actually amazing. I always get the boken girl salad with the best lemon vinaigrette you'll ever has. It's definitely not healthy but a better option than most of the other things on the menu. My other go to is oddly the matzoh soup. Being Jewish and growing up on my grandmas version, I doubted tobos would even be edible but was very pleasantly surprised. It's flavorful and the matzoh balls are the perfect consistency. My boyfriend solely sticks to the Ole or diving buffalo chew steak and can eat them over and over again without getting sick of it.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is for the delivery and pick up being pretty slow. If you are in a rush, tobos is not the place for you. Overall though, love it!
2019-01-01,4,My absolute favorite pizza take out place! It's right around the corner from me and the only place in Hoboken with (paneer) Tikka pizza on the menu! This is my go-to pizza place for impromptu  gatherings. Being an Indian I can vouch for their tikka flavor! But that's not the only pizza I like. Their Mexican corn husk is amazing too! The sheer flavor of Mexican corn and jalapeño is the bomb! The only thing is didn't like on the menu is the punjabo sub. I was very disappointed by the cauliflower filling in the sub. It was ver one dimensional. Not something I would recommend if you know what a cauliflower curry should taste like. But however I will keep going back for the pizzas and I am sure all my friends would be in complete agreement!
2018-12-31,1,Ordered half shit faced pizza and half winger but they managed to mess up our order on.l New Year's Eve no less.
2018-12-31,5,Best pizza I tried! The place is clean, customer service is great! I Never leave reviews but this place is bomb!
2018-12-24,5,Absolutely some of the best pizza I have ever had. The shitface pizza was really good. I sampled everyone's pizza in our party and they were also amazing. Very small place but well worth it. Super helpful staff for us out of town newbies.
2018-12-16,1,Drove 30 minutes expecting a unique #foodporn experience. Instead I found that Tony B's is worth neither the drive nor the $30 i spent!! my overall response to this place, if i had to sum it up in one word, is: uuuughi placed my order for an ole sandwich modified with chicken instead of beef. Waited 30 minutes for the food that sat on the take out shelf for what had to be ten minutes before they realized i was still waiting for my order!!! writing this review is angering me as i type because not only did they forget my food was sitting there, they got it wrong! my ole sandwich definitely had beef instead of chicken! so even after waiting patiently for 30 minutes, i couldn't even eat it! wasted my time driving there as well as my money! if there were an undo button for real life, i'd press it on this place. Who doesn't have water available for purchase? THIS PLACE! Smh I should've stayed home.
2018-12-15,1,Placed an order at 3:36 pm, on 12/15/2018.  I paid for it in advance, by credit card.  As of 5:14 pm, it still hasn't arrived.  I called back twice to check up on it.  It still hasn't arrived.  The person on the phone tried to blame it on SantaCon.  But on the phone she told me it that it would be about 40 min.  Well, that was only about an hour (!!) short of the actual arrival, and I"m still waiting with a room full of hungry party guests.UPDATE - still hasn't arrived as of 5:21.  So - 1:50 later, party ending in 10 min., and food hasn't arrived.UPDATE 2 - Now 5:35pm.  Ordered the food two hours ago.  Party supposed to be over.  And nothing has arrived.  I called and talk to them several times.  Nothing ever arrived.  Nothing but sputtering on their end of the phone.  No explanation, no justification.  I got a room full of hungry kids and no pizza as their holiday party comes to an end.
2018-12-14,1,Just an awful experience. They pay special preference to obscene drunkards from the bars nearby and delay pick up times and delivery times to unreasonable extremes. I went there the other day after ordering pick up (foolishly assuming it'd be quicker). I waited 30 minutes. I announced myself and waited, and waited some more. After 20 minutes, I inquired about my food. They'd obviously never checked on it and pretended to do so again. Another 30 minutes passed. Nothing and clear avoidance of eye contact while 20 groups walked in and were served before us. This isn't the first time. I tried again tonight - waited 1.5 hours for the food when the email said 45 minutes. The pizza is cold. What a joke. Too bad because they used to have good food.
2018-12-13,5,Bottom line: freaking delicious pizza. Must visit. Gluten free line: no good. Very sad. Wifey feels excluded. Long line: my mother in law's reaction-"this is one slice!?" Absolutely fantastic pizza. We tried the winger, the taco pizza, and the onion soup pizza. As a hot wing lover, I really enjoyed the winger. The taco pizza is a serious slice and I selflessly assisted in its completion. I would recommend to everyone except celiacs. Please make a GF friendly menu!
2018-12-12,2,The service and professionalism here was appalling. After ordering two slices of pizza, it took them TWO HOURS to deliver it. I had to speak to two different people to ultimately get them to deliver a mere two slices. When the guy finally showed up he lied and said that I provided the wrong address and phone number. I had to pull out my phone and point out that HE was the one who screwed up. The address and phone number were entered correctly and there's never ever been an issue from any other store I've ordered from. But the folks at this place couldn't just say "sorry we screwed up" or "sorry for the screw-up the order is on us". The only reason for not putting one star is that the pizza is good but the absurd lack of apology or professionalism has ensured I will never be back.
2018-12-09,5,Absolutely loved the taco pizza phenomenon. It definitely was not as big as advertised and fed more like 7 of us but it was so delicious. Looking forward to trying other special offerings!
2018-12-01,1,My wife and I love pizza and eat it about once per week. Our go-to in Hoboken is San Giuseppe (which makes excellent pizza btw) but we thought we'd mix it up by trying Tony Baloney's. BIG MISTAKE. One of the worst home delivery experiences in recent memory. First, the order took almost two hours to deliver (about one hour over the time stated in our email confirmation). Second, an item was missing from our order. Finally, and most disappointingly, the food was absolutely disgusting (cold, greasy, and generally tasted terrible) -- the pizza was, in fact, so incredibly bad that after eating a slice of each (we ordered a cheese pizza and a buffalo chicken pizza) we literally threw the rest of each pie in the trash. We will NEVER order from here again.
2018-11-30,3,Tony's is tonys. It's good wings, pizza is great but this is the second time I have tried a sub from them and it's nothing to write home about. Was it decent - yeah, after I dabbed most of the oil off that was soaking through the paper, yes, would I order it again? No. Especially not delivery. Even calling them and not using Uber eats/door dash etc it has always and I mean always been way over the 45 minute wait time. This time I waited from 1:00 until 2:30 for my order to be delivered. It just comes with the territory. At least this time they got my drink order correct- last time I got a cream soda instead of seltzer. But if you want good novelty "pizza" and finger food this is a good place. If you want Italian and your order to be delivered under an hour and a half - try Napoli's.
2018-11-28,3,The food is good but their the past few times I have called they have been out of the vegan meatballs and vegan pepperoni.
2018-11-27,2,Pizza was solid and if you're looking for some hipster toppings then this is your place. The loaded fries on the other hand we disgusting. Big blob of congealed cheese on top. Overcooked stale fries on the outside and soggy grease logged fries in the center then about 1/4 cup of grease are the bottom of the container. I tried moving them to a plate but decided not to eat them when I saw what was at the bottom.
2018-11-16,4,Gluten free specialty pizza!Crazy toppings for sure but no lack of flavor. Something for everyone and every craving.
2018-11-14,5,Been following this place on Instagram for a while now and finally decided go for their infamous Taco Pizza. I live in the Bronx so the drive was an hour going there and then coming back.It was well worth it! The owner is awesome. When Places my order they didn't have any slices left so he made a Veggie Taco Pizza slice from scratch, also ordered their Mac and Cheese slice, Flaming Hot Cheetos Mozzarella sticks and garlic knots. Fucking delicious! The food and service exceeded my expectations. Will be visiting again very soon!
2018-10-31,4,CORN PIZZA. The best slice of pizza in town. Such a variety of flavors on this slice with texture of fresh corn over the top. It also has a nice "spicy" kick to it.Not 5 stars because not all their flavor profiles are compatible to pizzas. They do a pretty solid job in conveying the flavors and cuisines into their pizzas, but it just does not flow as well on a pizza.
2018-10-29,5,The OG's of pizza! go there almost everyday, definitely gaining some weight xD but worth it. great staff! super friendly, definitely recommended.
2018-10-16,4,I'm not the biggest fan of their subs - most recently I have tried the Jerzey Jezebel and have tried two others in the past - but I absolutely love their pizza. My favorite is the Grandma Patti with vodka sauce and sausage. Omg yum! And they deliver - which is a huge plus. Their white pizza and the Oldman Brooklyn are also amazing!!
2018-10-14,5,Great food. Not really into Hoboken pizza joints but the food here is out of the ordinary. The salads are very nice (but perhaps not all that healthy?). Much better than usual family Italian places with interesting flavour and casual benches to sit on.
2018-10-14,5,Freakin' love this place. The shit faced sauce is the best!! I get it on the wings. The pizza is amazing too. Overall you cannot go wrong with this place. Can't get enough.
2018-10-09,5,Great junk food, gained 1000lbs. To much cheese though on the  crab fries, I love cheese too but it was o much it just dried up and absorbed the crab piece and couldn't  taste it. The sandwiches we good but messy.
2018-10-07,5,We had a good experience here. I ordered the "OLE" and my husband the duck melt. The food was really good but kinda sloppy to eat so make sure you grab plenty of napkins. I ordered the racelette mushroom fries and it tasted like there was a lot of wine in the cheese. I would definitely go to this place again, but I would try to order some different items on the menu. My husband ordered another type of French fries with a white sauce that were very good. You only need one order of French fries for two people because the ordered is massive. I was lucky and went there around 6:00pm and the place wasn't busy. But shortly after arriving there was a line that formed. The place isn't too big to sit so in the winter be prepared to take your order to go. The fountain soda  is very good. I can't remember the brand but definitely have to try to when you go!
2018-10-06,4,Pretty good for a Saturday night delivery to Jersey City. We ordered a large pie (half cheese, half pepperoni).  The pizza was good. We just wish it was crispier. French fries were also good but soggy (and I don't usually mind soggy fries).  Although its a bit of a ride from Hoboken to JC, truffle mozzarella sticks arrived crispy.  My husband was impressed with the portion size. They were very rich with the truffle oil/flavor.  Good marinara. I think we would give Tony Boloney's another try.
2018-10-04,4,Tony Boloney's has everything! Every type of pizza you can think of, vegan options, subs, endless types of fries, wings. Its so easy to order way too much when you look at their menu. Everything tastes pretty decent. Their white eggplant pizza is awesome!
2018-09-30,5,Very unique specialty slices. Got the buratta which is basically a penne slice with buratta cheese on top.
2018-09-29,4,The safe bet when you need to grab a vite after a night out. It can be packed after 12 am on the weekends but its worth the wait. The pizza is pretty good. The staff is attentive and quick to help. Ill be back.
2018-09-25,5,You want an amazing, original, knock you pants off sub? Tony Baloneys is your spot. These subs are not for the faint hearted. They are delicious, they are heavy, they are amazing! Also, their pizza is on point too if you want a creative slice
2018-09-03,4,Super thin crust, good tasting ingredients, good service... Missing something... Everything was tasty, right amount of ingredients, the quality and portions are perfect. But IN MY OPINION it could use more flavor, more seasoning, more something. Could use more flavor in general. Fountain drinks are unique and tasty. Plenty of vegetarian options.
2018-08-31,1,Horrible. Way too spicy. Pass-the-dutchie. I felt sick and I will never order again. I ordered $24 worth of food and I asked if they can fix it and the girl just said no without hesitation. That's not customer service.
2018-08-25,3,I've never been to the establishment but I did order delivery via Postmates. The pizza is aight, but it's just aight, and I think the appeal is the unique combinations rather than genuinely good pizza. I can't think of anyone else offering flavor profiles like coconut curry or french onion soup. That being said... I sampled a few slices and found them all to be too salty and overly greasy. The same is true for their sandwiches. Their house fries did not sit well with my stomach and I spent longer than expected remedying that situation. These guys don't seem to realize aioli isn't mayo with artificial lemon juice. Bummer.  The upside? Their 12" pie can easily serve two people, maybe even three, which is honestly not a bad deal, though I find some of their appetizers overpriced. It's up to you if you want to make the trip but you'd probably enjoy it more after a few drinks first if I had to guess.
2018-08-18,5,LOVE this pizza place. Been coming here since they opened and they never disappoint. 1. Their unique topping combinations may sound a little weird at first but they are wonderfully executed and taste amazing! Pancho Franco is hands down personal favorite, a must try.2. They are open super late night, until 4am!Whenever I'm trekking back from the bar scene, this is the place to be. And don't be fooled, they get PACKED after 2 am but still the line moves incredibly fast and the pizza quality never changes. Finding quality food anywhere after 2am is a struggle so I am grateful I have this trusty go-to.3. The owner of Tony's is an absolute doll. He really cares about the community and you can almost always catch him behind the cash register desk. The day of the Hoboken train crash, he and his pizza family brought out countless pizzas to the first responders. As a born and raised Hoboken girl, I can appreciate a down-to-Earth owner who is present in their community.I can't say enough wonderful things about Tony Boloney's. You really gotta try it to believe it. I heard in the news they are also opening a shop in Jersey City which I will definitely be keeping an eye out for!
2018-08-09,3,So I'm giving them 3stars for price factor only. $19 for one sandwich and one slice is pretty steep and technically could feed a family at any average pizzeria. It's definitely worth trying if you haven't .Taste factor it's definitely 4 stars !! We ordered the chicken Po Carver and it was delicious the perfect blend of spices it was a flavor party in your mouth.I also go a Burata slice which was pretty tasty . The decor is pretty cool on the walls and there is some indoor and outdoor seating. Seems they do quite a bit of take out .
2018-08-08,5,My brother and I were taking a road trip to Florida from Massachusetts and we decided to solely take a pit stop in Hoboken just because we've heard about Tony Boloney's and we weren't let down. I got two slices of the French onion soup pizza and holy hell, it taste just like French onion soup and it is the best pizza I have ever had. My brother had a slice of French onion and a slice of shitfaced and we both left happy.
2018-07-31,1,I've heard such good things about Tony Boloney's and their menu sounds amazing. However, I ordered from there recently with high hopes and the food was garbage. Everything horrible. My "boneless wings" were cut up pieces of chicken tenders and they were so dry and chewy I had to spit them out. The cheesy garlic bread with dipping sauce was not only burnt but also covered in herbs or some kind of pesto that was not in the description anwas really unnecessary and not good at all. It also took a long time and was expensive. Very disappointing. ***Also lied about sending me a gift card because of this review!**
2018-07-30,1,What an absolute letdown this place is.  The food on their Instagram looks freaking amazing.  So amazing I've made the trek from Greenpoint Brooklyn twice.Both times sucked.1st time- ordered the Baller. A hot parm style sandwich with rice balls.  The rice balls were cold.  The cheese was cold.  The sauce, cold.  The seeded bun- not seeded.  I suppose i should have asked them to stick back in the oven for another 3-5 minutes l, but it was late, i was tired and hungry and let it slide.2nd time (tonight)- was craving a cold sub.  The Commission looked amazing on the menu but i don't eat meat.  Asked if they could do a meatless version and was told no problem. I asked if i could get the fresh mozzarella instead of the 3 or 4 meats that usually come on it- no problem.  Great!!  Got the sandwich, took it back to my car, opened it up to find a shit-ton of meat.Took it back in.  After several minutes the guys started explaining to me how the sandwich is all about the meat.  Whatever man.  Either you can do the modification or you can't. Cheese sandwiches actually exist and people eat them all the time and love them. I waked out.  No sandwich.  The pricks at Boloney's have my money and the tip I regretfully left.Currently at a grocery store buying bread and cheese and dressing to make my own sandwich.F U T B
2018-07-30,2,We came for the taco pizza and it was definitely #instaworthy, but it tasted just meh.It cost $80 for the entire pie, which comes with 8 huge slices of pizza, each topped with 2 tacos. They smother the tacos in sauce, and then slop on the guac and some white sauce (crema?) in the middle. As someone who hates getting their hands dirty, this pizza was a nightmare. We tried eating just the tacos first, but then realized that left a normal cheese pizza below with whatever pieces of the taco that fell out while you were eating it. So then we tried eating it all together... It tasted okay, but definitely not worth the mess. For $80, I can get MUCH better pizza across in NYC. Social media definitely hyped this place up. They have a ton of different toppings including one with Ramen, another with Smoked Duck. If you're into that exotic type of pizza, then give it a try, but I'll just stick with a slice of Pepperoni from the city for $3-4.
2018-07-26,5,YUM! the slices were SO big and tasted delicious. I loved the Uncle Jemimas slice and the Mac and cheese one. Service was prompt and they even brought us our slices once we sat down outside. We went late at night and it wasn't very busy. I could see the place being packed though during meal times, as it is not too large of a place.
2018-07-25,5,Recently tried this place for delivery. My tech recommended it and told me their pizzas are really good! When I heard the price, I was in shock. $70-80 for a pie?! We all decided to get their sandwiches, which were all reasonably priced. Delivery came pretty fast and food was still warm. I got the Ole sandwich and it was SO DELICIOUS. Not the cleanest thing to eat, super messy actually with all the sauce, but the flavor was well worth the 1000 napkins I used. Will def go in next time and try their $$$ pizza and update my review on that!
2018-07-24,3,Being that i'm a vegan i feel like this place has better options for people who aren't. Had several of the very minimal vegan options available and they're okay. I would suggest creating more vegan options that are very tasteful; Not saying that the options that are available aren't tasty but definitely room for improvement. I'll be back again in a few months to see what will change.
2018-07-20,4,A late Friday night delivery was much faster than seamless predicted. The single slices are big, but expensive. The burritos are bigger than the sandwiches, so definitely worth it to get a burrito if you're hungry.
2018-07-19,5,Me and my girlfriend came across this place on IG and immediately added it to our 2k18 Food tour. Let me say this first, the food looks good in pictures but in person I was blown away. We ordered the Ole' steak sandwich which won a couple of competitions and has been featured on TV. The steak was really good perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, loaded with flavor and the cheese on that thang stole the show. I'm not big on onions and forgot to ask for my sandwich to not have any and I'm glad i did, those onions melted away with each bite like a cube of butter. In addition we ordered the Po' Doc Carver and this was my favorite sandwich. The chicken was amazing, flat out some of the best chicken I EVER had. The chicken could have been sold on its own, that's how good it was. This sandwich will haunt me until I can have it again.The fries? I wouldn't even know what to say. I think they were good but the sandwiches were so amazing and filling, I had maybe 2 handfuls and never looked back.After leaving and just walking around the are we would look at people eating in other places and say "why are they eating there when a place like Tony Baloney's is right there, smh dummies". I will definitely be taking the drive back to Hoboken multiple times for the food.Iight so BOOM. IDk how to write a second review so imma add it to this one. The second time we go to Tony's I get the sandwich the po' doc carver, no thinking or anything, I knew what I wanted and had to have it, so miss thing wanna go get pasta. Yeah, Pasta. I'm looking at her sideways like Pasta? Forreal? after the bomb ass sandwiches we had last time? LET ME TELL YOU THIS!!!!THAT PASTA WAS AMAZING, I looked at my sandwich in disgust because that pasta was absolute cocaine with some noodles and sauce. It was as if Tony went to Italy gathered the ingredients came back and got to work. I'm convinced that no matter what you get at this place it's going to be FIRE, I might even get a salad. One thing for sure though is Imma just let my girlfriend do the ordering cuz she got the magic menu eye.
2018-07-17,2,Brutal. B r u t a l. I have ordered here a couple times, first time was 1.30 minutes, second was 2 hours and 15 minutes. The second time my entire order was wrong and my sandwich was forgotten. I called back to To speak to manager and they said that's not possible? Whatever that means. Pretty rude, and the wrong food items weren't even flavorful. The one sandwich might have been BBQ? And there was such a kick to it. Really liked that though. Only reason it got a 2 Star. Good BBQ
2018-07-16,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! The Sandwiches are hefty, the pizzas are unique; If you are in Hoboken this is the place you have to go to if your feeling really hungry. I have only tried the Hoboken one, but I can imagine the Atlantic City one also to be great. Definitely one of Hoboken's greats!
2018-07-16,2,Came here for the hype but ultimately left very disappointed. Got the mac and cheese pizza + the thai chicken pizza. Pizza is good if you're drunk but if you're sober, I do not recommend the pizzas here... Somewhat stale and pizza was on the colder side.. Will not return for the pizza but will return for the taco pizza or their specialty pizza and maybe provide an update
2018-07-15,5,Highly recomended i have had never taste a better pizza taco like this one because they the only one that make them they the best
2018-07-14,4,This sandwich was absolutely delicious. Make me want to run through fire with gasoline draws on. Fondue Cheesesteak with sautéed mushrooms.
2018-07-14,5,garlic bread with cheese was amazing! i traveled far to get it lol. when u see it on instagram how could you not? they have a huge selection of stuff so i have to come back and try more. but it was very good.
2018-07-09,3,Meh. So many fun flavors to choose from but the pizza was mediocre and had a slightly hard and chewy crust. I've tried the Mex-corn Husker and the Pancho Franco, and I thought both tasted okay/decent but they just weren't "fresh-out-of-the-oven" good and both of the slices could've used more toppings. With so much social media hype around this restaurant, I was expecting higher quality here.
2018-07-08,5,Really enjoyed this place delicious pizza , so much variety, Hands down best pizza in Jersey
2018-07-06,2,Just ordered off their app which I do like and easy to use. Got garlic bread and the new Nashville chicken sub (jerzey jezebel) . Garlic bread didn't come with marinara. The bread was burnt, chicken was badly burnt, only two pickles came on it and I could not even taste the Nashville sauce. Was really bummed because I wanted to try it. Seeing some issues with inconsistency when ordering here. May only be worth going if you're eating there.Delivery man was really nice tho and on time.
2018-07-05,2,Delivery order estimated for 65-85 minutes arrived almost an hour after the 85 min mark.The pesto mozzarella sticks, not sure why more than one type exists, but a friend said they were good when he had them, were burnt to a crisp, either a mishap or closer to the norm if herbs are in the stick breading.The award winning ole sandwich was solid, but nothing special. I couldn't find any Oaxaca cheese on it.The UNCLE PENNYBAGS was a definite winner, nice balance of all the components.Overall, a terrible meal, maybe it was a bad day for them as we've ordered some good pizzas in the past.
2018-07-04,3,Great place but a little expensive in general. Parking was a nightmare for any non resident which was very frustrating.
2018-07-04,5,It is a great place for lunch or diner. Im still working on trying everything on the menu.
2018-06-30,5,The pizza here is excellent. We had slices of the Heart Attack, Mac and Cheese, Bangkok, Crustaceans, and Grandma Patti (my favorite was the Heart Attack). The Saigon wings were amazing - perfectly cooked with thin and crispy skin, and just the right amount of sauce, as were the Winger Fries. My arteries may be clogged, but it. Was. Worth it.
2018-06-24,1,If you like waiting over 2 hours and spending $50 for 2 ice cold pizzas (one they didn't have what we ordered) and 5 tiny chunks of chicken with the wrong dipping sauce, this is the place for you!!! I wouldn't feed this crap to my dog. There's plenty of other good restaurants around here with better food and better customer service. Lesson learned. Never again.
2018-06-15,5,My favorite pizza spot in Hoboken for sure. There's always a good vibe and good service. I ordereda Ducktown pizza and it was one of the best slices I've ever ate.
2018-06-15,4,Came for the infamous taco pizza. Tried a few others also. Everything was excellent. We went on a Tuesday in June around 2 and had no wait and plenty of seating- which is very limited. Staff didn't go out of their way to actually speak or be kind, but maybe that's expected in Jersey.
2018-06-10,1,Worst pizza we've ever had. Ordered the Yogi pie for my pregnant wife and I got an undercooked mess that stuck to the box. We've gotten this order before and it has been fine. The kale on the pie was super sour and the flavors were totally different from usual. Whoever is working in the kitchen tonight should not be left alone and needs a lot more training. The box was absolutely soaked with oil. Unfortunately we will not be ordering from you again.
2018-06-10,4,Think of any possible combo you can put on a pizza and this place has it. They specialize putting different varieties of toppings on their pizzas focusing on different cuisines (mexican, asian, indian etc.) My personal favorite is the pancho franco: avocados, oaxaca cheese, jalapeno crema, topped with jalapeno potato chips. The underlying sauce on this slice is great. I'd also recommend getting the garlic knots as a side. Definitely come here hungry because the slices are very filling, could barely finish a second slice. Can't wait to come back and try a sub!
2018-06-10,4,We came here on Saturday around 2 PM. The restaurant is small, not much seating but they have a few tables outdoors, which is where we sat since it was a nice day outside. We got 4 slices: ay dios mio-mac, grandma patti (chicken parm version), mex corn-husker, and pancho franco. Also got some garlic knots, and cheesy garlic bread. Ranking from favorite to least slice: pancho franco, mex corn-husker, ay dios mio-mac, and finally grandma patti. The slices were sitting out so the grandma patti was a little soggy for my liking, not their fault. The jalapeno crema sauce on the pancho franco was out of this world. It was tangy and spicy at the same time. The mac and cheese pizza could've used some more of the chipotle sauce, it was a little dry. And the mex corn-husker was tasty, you get a kick from the dusted chilis on top. You wouldn't think these combos would work on pizza slices but they're definitely a hit! The garlic knots were amaaazzzzingggg. The dough was so soft on the inside but crunchy on out the outside and they douse the knots with lots of garlic, herbs and butter. Melt in your mouth! Definitely get a side of vodka sauce to dip the knots in. The cheesy garlic bread was also very good. Overall, other reviews on here mention that the slices have been sitting out which take away from the quality of the pizza. I could totally see that, however, I don't think that's really the establishment's fault. Getting a fresh pie would definitely be much better. Will be back to try other slices!
2018-06-03,4,DELICIOUS!!!! I have only eaten vegetarian items like sandwiches with cauliflower instead of meat. The sandwiches were awesome!  The salad was good too but not awesome. Delivery was in about 30 mins to JC.
2018-05-25,2,Working in the food service industry saddens me with this type of service. I called the restaurant ahead after placing the order online to provide my workplace so they can instantly reach me there. I gave them the full 70 minutes for my order, only to arrive 35 minutes late. They claimed they tried contacting me 7 times. I stood outside of my restaurant waiting. Food is ice cold. While it does taste good, I'm sure my food will be a lot better pipping hot. So much for my first time experience.
2018-05-23,5,After seeing Tony Baloneys on TV I went there on a weeknight and ordered a pre-made Heart-Attack slice of pizza and an Ole' Cheesesteak.  The staff were friendly and quick, the slice was ready in a few minutes and just as I was finishing that up the sandwich was ready.  You can tell a lot of effort and thought goes into the ingredients and preparation.  All very fresh and delicious, even though a little messy.  I have to admit, I took half the cheesesteak home and it was almost as good the next day when I reheated it.  I will definitely be back the many other options.  Great place to stop in at or order ahead.
2018-05-21,5,All i can say is sh!tface and the buffalo chicken kind (i forget the name) but thank me later!!
2018-05-15,2,I used to love this place it was a really great addition to the neighborhood especially for late night grub but over the past year the quality has really gone down hill. The chicken is comparable to  frozen chicken patties with pieces of grizzle or some other weird texture that is really unpleasant. I ordered a geppeto sub with meatballs from them last night it was cold, the bread was stale, and over all the sandwich was just bad I barely ate any of it.
2018-05-11,5,Loooooove! Their buffalo chicken "winger pizza" is amazing & we tried the "moonshiner" last night, I'm generally not a white/light sauce gal but wow was it good! I'd eat their food everyday if pizza was zero calories  we ordered on a busy Thursday night, expected delivery was 1-1.5 hours, we got it in a little over 30 minutes.
2018-04-27,5,I crave and crave and crave their food .. i was so sad when we lost the prior establishment after Sandy (lived here for a while) but im so grateful that TBs came to the rescue. They have the best non-traditional and standard pizzas around and a ton of other delicious stuff including vegan and vegetarian options which warms my heart .. 12 stars!
2018-04-26,4,I am not one to write reviews whatsoever but I am extremely disappointed with this restaurant. The pictures and reviews looked good so i decided to give this place a try. Not only did I pay 5 dollars to get A wrap delivered, I waited two hours to receive my food. By the time I received my order, my lunch was over, the wrap was cold and soggy. As a pregnant woman, you guys cannot even begin to imagine how upset I wasI wanted to update my review. The restaurant reached out and offered me a credit so I decided to give it a try. I order the same thing as last time, only that this time it wasn't cold or soggy lol. Def will recommend moving forwards. Thank you
2018-04-24,4,First time in Hoboken and my friend insisted we come here, because it's kind of insta famous for their taco pizzas. I was initially surprised by how clean it was in the restaurant! It was similar to Two Boots, where all of the flavors are incredibly creative and out of the ordinary. I ordered the slice with avocado, jalapeno cream sauce, chicken  and my friend ordered the buffalo chicken. Not sure if I enjoyed it so much, because i was STARVING, but I really liked it and I think this place lived up to the hype! I think each slice came out to about $4-5, which is a little pricey, but worth it for all of the creative toppings. They also have fancy soda, which you should totally check out. Overall, would def return on a Tuesday to try the famous taco pizza!
2018-04-24,5,The first time I went to Tony Baloney's, it was in AC and I've been in love since. I've come here on multiple occasions for cheesesteak sandwiches and pizza - loved them all. Ambiance is very hip - white subway tiles, exposed brick, minimalistic cartoon decor on their pizza boxes. I love how creative their food is and how extensive the menu is! I'm slowly trying to make my way through their different pizzas.Most recently when I ordered from here, I ordered through the Yelp app since there was a huge line (2 AM on a Saturday night). By the time we got to the front of the line, we were told that one of the slices we ordered was sold out, so we picked a different slice and waited while they heated up in the oven. Minutes later and the the pizza was boxed up and we were on our way home. Nothing better than some great pizza, sitting on the couch, and watching Netflix after a night out drinking.
2018-04-23,3,If you're drunk and looking for non traditional pizza then this is your place. In my opinion, the toppings are just way too much for my likings. Even the traditional slice is lacking a good sauce and good mozz. Do yourself a favor, get some real pizza. Not at the top of my list.
2018-04-22,4,Stopped here for lunch while visiting Hoboken for the day.  They have a lot of really interesting pizzas, probably their biggest draw.  Think mac and cheese pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, pizza with avocado and chicken, stuff like that.  I chose the winger, which had chicken and buffalo sauce.  It was really good, although it had a bit too much sauce for my liking...the buffalo flavor was a bit overwhelming.  I really enjoyed the vampire knots, they were delicious, although I wish they came with a side of marinara sauce.  Service was fast and very friendly.  This is a very casual place, you just walk in and order at the counter and grab a table.  It's very, very small so taking it to go somewhere might be the best move if it's crowded.  Overall I really liked this place and would definitely return to try another kind of pizza if I'm back in Hoboken again.
2018-04-20,1,Good pizza, seriously bad delivery service. The pizza arrives on average 90 minutes after I order and is usually cold. The pizza isn't good enough to justify garbage service.
2018-04-17,5,I love Tony Boloney's! Drunk or sober, it's always delicious.I usually go for the Gauchito, Mex-Corn Husker, or the Ay Dios Mio-Mac! but last night I tried the Jewish Cowboy. LOVED it. A Reuben in a pizza.Wings are also on point. I had them as part of a wing competition and voted them number one in Hoboken.They deliver to the Heights (they didn't at first), though you might have to call them if it's a bit late just to check.
2018-04-15,5,I need to eat this spot more often when i make to Hoboken.  The pizza slices are great and whoever comes up with them is a mad genius.
2018-04-10,2,I recently went on a trip to NY with my bf and some friends of all the places I had found on social media that HAD to try this was my #1!! We stayed in Times Square so we had to travel quite a bit to get to Toneys but I didn't care I had to try the infamous Bagel pizza! When we came in the staff just stared at us blankly, no greeting, no how can I help you guys, nothing. I had to make me way up to the counter and initiate the conversation because the cashier and guy next to her were still just staring at us. I asked her if they were serving the bagel pizza and she said yes so I asked if I could order a whole one she seemed bothered and turned around to ask someone in the kitchen and then she replied with "yeah but it's going to take a while" and continued to stare at me again. I said "okay...how long?" She said 45 Mins and I said that's fine we ordered the pizza and left to a bar around the corner to kill time. Again when we came back about 40 min later they again all stared at me blankly as I approached the counter and asked if the pizza was ready they said yes and we sat and they brought out the pizza. Shortly after my boyfriend ended up getting some cups for drinks and when the cashier gave him his change she slammed it on the counter. Overall the pizza was okay, don't expect it to look like the videos on social media ours could've used way more pepperoni. Nonetheless everything you would expect from a bagel/ pizza, but the customer service was so bad. I'm a server, and I also work in retail. I understand if I was being rude to the cashier but we didn't do anything to her, didn't demand anything, or give her attitude? Maybe they were mad they had to make a whole one or maybe they could tell we weren't from town and hate tourists? Either way this review would've been a lot better  if they weren't so rude for no reason. Especially since the rest of the people coming in didn't seem to be getting the same treatment. Probably wont pay a visit next time I'm in NY lots of other places to grab a great slice around town.
2018-04-09,4,Pizza was fantastic, service was under par because the guy that took my order forget to give me a cup and garlic knots that were apart of the lunch special. They are quite unique when it comes to pizza (which I like). I will definitely be back again hopefully the person taking my order will not forget the items that were included in the lunch special.
2018-04-08,4,As a true Jersey Girl, I'm a bit of a pizza snob. That said, I do believe that there is a place for all types of pizzerias, from your mom & pop joints that stick to the classics to your risk takers that go beyond pepperoni and spinach. Tony Boloney's falls into the latter category, and that's not a bad thing at all.Disclaimer: Yes, this is a place that is willing to capitalize on its large social media following, from the infamous Taco Pizza to the oversized Pizza Bagel. With exposure comes hype, and with hype comes overhype. So, I would say that the best way to approach a place like TB's is to manage your expectations a little. That way, you'll get the experience you want.For me, I went to their Hoboken location after a grueling hour at the gym, and ordered two slices from the counter: the Oldman Brooklyn (a classic margherita slice) and the Uncle Jemima (an Instagram staple in its own right; chicken & waffles with maple syrup and cheddar). Counter service was quick and friendly, and pizza came out fresh and hot. Whenever I go to a new pizza place, I always order a standard plain slice and use it as a baseline to see how well the place can make pizza as a whole, especially since it's hard to mess up a plain slice. Stereotypically, in my experience most pizza places that specialize in kooky flavors tend to neglect the classics. TB's, simply put, bucks that trend. The Oldman Brooklyn had a great red sauce that was well seasoned and didn't require me to add my usual plain-slice accoutrement (grated parm, oregano, garlic powder). It also had a balanced amount of cheese, not too little or too much. The only critique I have was that the crust was a little on the thin side, making it hard to fold the slice in half without worrying that you'll end up tearing the slice.As for the Uncle Jemima, I was surprised to find out that it wasn't as heavy as I anticipated, and not in a bad way. The fried chicken was a little on the lighter side, but was well cooked and had good coating, while the waffles and syrup flavor reminded me of my childhood Eggo's (and that's a VERY good thing). The syrup flavor was sweet, if a little overpowering, which gave me the impression that I would enjoy this slice a little more with some ...*enhancements* (liquid or herbal). Overall, I would say that TB's is worth the trip whether you're there for the 'gram or for a standard neighborhood slice!
2018-04-07,4,Good pizza. It was fast and delicious by the slice pizza. I can think of other places higher on my list but it was all around very good pizza
2018-04-01,1,Super disappointed. If you're not from NY or Jersey and don't know good pizza, you might like it. But real pizza lovers- stay away.  The sauce didn't taste good -way too sweet. The Mac n cheese pizza needed more cheese and some salt. The General TSO pizza was gross and kinda soggy. Every slice we had was a disappointment. Sadly their instagram page had us hyped. Can't believe we wasted all that $$$ on bad pizza.
2018-03-31,5,Made up for a bad delivery with a giftcard! Owner made sure we were taken care of and havent bad any issues since.
2018-03-29,5,A lotta bad reviews but they use good ingredients in their different slices. Masala slice, ramen slice and Mac and cheese slice were fantastic. This order was for pickup. I see delivery is trash based on the reviews
2018-03-22,1,Requested a slice of pepperoni two employees gave me a displeased look, and then proceeded to add pepperoni while talking about me under their breath. When I noticed it, they stopped looking at me. This behavior is unacceptable. This wasn't a complicated request. It's a simple slice of pepperoni. 3/21/2018
2018-03-13,2,Don't believe the hype. I've been here five times total, mainly because it's right down the street from me and I'm a firm believer in second (third, fourth, and fifth chances). Maybe that's why all my exes took advantage of me. Who knows, either way, there are so many better pizza places in Hoboken. If you're going to ignore this review and go here anyway, order the Mac & Cheese slice, it was one of the only decent things I've had.
2018-03-01,5,If you want your mind blown with the craziest pizzas, subs, and fries ever, this is the spot. Nice owner, & everything I've had from there has been on-point. They also created a pizza w/ tacos on it...c'mon now!
2018-02-26,5,One of the best pizzas I've ever had ! The veggie options are amazing n so was the pancho franko ! The staff was courteous n gave us enough time to decide coz there is a huge selection to choose from ! Definitely coming back for moreee !!!
2018-02-25,2,Pizza slice was a bit gimmicky, but not bad overall. But the matzo ball soup someone in my group wanted tasted fishy. It was a carry out order, so we only find out way after we leave. Shame on me for ordering matzo soup from a pizza place, but why do they even offer it?
2018-02-23,5,Great pizza, awesome wings, and killer fries!!! Also dig the arancini balls. You can't go wrong with ordering from here. Delivery isn't too shabby, but eating fresh there is the best.
2018-02-21,3,I was here last weekend to grab a slice of the super Facebook-popular pizza bagel - only available in the Hoboken location on Fridays. Here's the website description of it: "Massive pizza bagel pizza. Everything bagel, vodka sauce, smoked pepperoni, fresh mozzarella. Vegetarian available too." Sounds pretty delicious!However, I was a bit underwhelmed. Maybe the pizza was out for too long, but the bagel base of my slice tasted stale which is a shame because the bagel base is reason for all the hype and uniqueness. The toppings, however, were very flavorful. If those exact toppings were on a regular dough (not a bagel) base, I think it'd taste fantastic.The slice was $8, but it's very thick! I could barely fit it into my mouth lol. So for what it's worth, the portion justifies the price. I probably won't come back for the pizza bagel, but I'll definitely be back one day for the Truffle motz sticks and the taco pizza!
2018-02-16,4,Truffle motz sticks. (I should just stop this review there??) They have an arrangement of now famous eats (such as a taco pizza!) and are known to be a great spot to pig out and get in touch with your inner comfort food cravings.
2018-02-16,1,Some of the worst customer service at a pizza place in Hoboken. Placed an order to pick up two hours before I wanted it and showed up at the restaurant and waited 30 minutes to get it. For how over priced the pizza is you think you would get better service.
2018-02-11,1,Tony baloney has some decent pizza, but pissed to learn they charge $2 for delivery even when you call direct to the shop.  I understand the delivery fee with seamless, but to charge a fee for normal delivery is ridiculous when you own a pizzeria.
2018-02-11,5,Probably my favorite pizza place in Hoboken. They have a great selection of creative specialty pizzas. My favorites are the buffalo chicken and jersey turnpike pizzas. So good!
2018-02-10,2,Taco pizza video is all over the internet and I've been wanting to try it for some time. For my husband's birthday, I pre-ordered taco pizza on Wednesday for Friday 7:30 delivery. Boy, it was a mistake... so what went wrong?1. The order arrived 50 mins late. I called them at 7:50 and the girl said the delivery person should arrive any minute. I called back at 8:05 and 8:10 and both times, no one picked up and I was on hold for 5 mins both times! The order finally came at 8:20.2. Taco pizza came in a regular pizza box so the tacos were all squashed. 3. The pizza came cold so the tacos were soggy.... Overall I am so extremely disappointed. Why allow your customers to pre-order food if you cannot meet the delivery time? All can be forgiven if the food is good. The taco pizza was boxed in the short regular pizza box which caused the tacos to be squished AND the taco pizza sat out for too long causing it to be soggy!Side note: We also two large order of fries. Their fries are really good but don't order for delivery. They were so soggy that no one touched them.
2018-02-10,2,This place hypes up their pizza but besides that their hype is nothing but bs. Thin crust pizza sucks and that's all they have. If you're excited about this place then lower your expectations because it sucks.
2018-02-09,5,One of the best pizza choices in the area. Fairly thin crust pizza and super crispy which is what I want in. Pizza. Sauce and cheese are excellent flavor wise. Also recommend the garlic knots. Can be a quick in and out or you can sit and enjoy your pizza there. It is fairly small inside but clean and friendly staff.
2018-02-09,1,My boyfriend and I were very excited to try this, their menu is really different and sounded great. However, I've never been so frustrated with a delivery experience. We ordered through their online ordering service and the order showed up 30 minutes late and was missing our pretzel mozzarella sticks. The delivery man said he would check the car and come back, but of course, he never came back. We sat on hold for over twelve minutes twice only to have whomever was managing the phone, pick up, say nothing, and instantly hang up. We haven't been able to get in touch with anyone to get our money back or get the full order that we already paid for. We are going to have to dispute the charges with our credit card company. It has been an incredibly disappointing experience.
2018-02-04,1,I'd give 0 stars if I could. Placed an order through yelp about 45 minutes ago (4:00pm), and I was expecting my food here within the next couple of minutes (food generally takes 45-60 min). I get a call that they will no longer be delivering out because they are backed up. It is super bowl Sunday. Pretty pathetic that a pizza and wing place couldn't get it together for the biggest pizza and wing event of the year. Furthermore not grandfather my order since I have already waited this long. Not a fan of leaving negative reviews, but the lack in customer service is probably the reasons for the "mediocre at best" ratings they have on yelp. Thanks for the disappointment!
2018-02-02,1,We were to excited for the pizza bagel and boyyyyy were we disappointed. We love Tony Boloney's, however the pizza bagel was terrible. WASTE OF MONEY. I would never trust them again and don't think I could order to Tony Boloney's again - shame on them!
2018-01-16,3,Inconsistent Pizza and sandwiches. I find if you order there own creations when it comes to the pizza they usually come out better. I would say the best one is the Grandpa Charlie.  The sandwiches often are overstuffed and messy, but the boken boy is the best one. Wings and fries are usually top notch.  Try the Moses Wings, they are a truly original flavor. As for the fries the best one is the bastardo fries.The Delivery is always quick and packed well.
2018-01-16,3,They're food is legit! And customer service is solid in righting wrongs. We'll be back.
2018-01-12,5,This is my favorite pizza place in NJ. I found Tony's over 3 years ago and have not been disappointed since!! I love Tony's! The selection and variety keep me coming back for more! I need to try the Taco Pizza
2018-01-07,1,Have you ever been so excited to try something new so you starve yourself all day so you appreciate and devour the delicious food you will order at dinner? Then you get your food and your mouth continuously waters?!  Yeah... well... expect that this place will not achieve that, and WILL disappoint and leave you feeling angry and dissatisfied.Let me just start off by saying - I never complain about food especially to people who work there because 1.) that's a first world problem & many people are starving around the world and 2.) subpar food is still edible. But this tonight's experience at Tony Boloney's really set an all time low.This place is overhyped, disgusting, and NOT worth your money. Even if I was drunk with no sensitivity to taste, I would be better off ordering a slice of pizza from a generic pizza place.Ok first - my friends and I wanted to try this place because of the colored mozzarella sticks. We didn't end up getting it because it's just mozz cheese with a sh*t ton of food coloring. For $20, you can make it at home (TRUST ME). So collectively we ordered 2 small pizzas (Moonshiner and 1900s), fries, cobb salad, Ganja wings, Gravytrain steak sandwich, and Carney Balls. Carney Balls came out first. Stale/chewy, hard, cold. Didn't mind it at first because I have all my REAL teeth and it was doused in hazelnut chocolate sauce. But the more I ate it, the more I realized they were most likely cooked earlier this morning or maybe the day before and just carelessly thrown in a puddle of sauce. These would've been tasty if they were fresh from the fryer.Cobb salad was ok. Good. It's hard to mess up cold salad.Gravytrain sandwich... The meat was cold and the bread was stale. The mozzarella was still hard and not melted at all. The girl at the front said that it's fresh mozzarella and that it's supposed to be like that. Wait, what? If a customer is ordering a hot sandwich, why is the meat cold and why is the cheese not melted? This means that the cooked meat was refrigerated, barely re-heated, and served because nothing that touches a stove/grill top will be cold. Needless to say, my friend threw out the entire sandwich.Ganja wings come out.... COLD TO THE TOUCH.... not an exaggeration!!! Ridiculous!!!! You are meaning to tell me that there was COLD cooked wings back in your kitchen and you just tossed sauce on it and served it to a customer????!? We took it back up to the front, and yet again the girl said "it's just cold bc of the sauce"..... You're joking right? How does the sauce make an ENTIRE chicken wing cold? They took it back and most likely reheated it in a MICROWAVE or some sort of microwave oven. We got the wings back. Opened up 4 out of the 5 wings and there was blood still bright pink in the inside close to the bone. Yet again, we bring it back up. A guy this time in the back said "No it's just a little blood. No big deal, you'll be fine" ......WHAT???!?!?!!?!? You not only serve COLD chicken wings, your food is PREMADE and you just reheat your stale food in a MICROWAVE?!?!?? Then try to justify it?The fries were meh. Ok, but had better. Nothing amazing.Finally, we got our 2 pizzas. The 1900s was so GREASY GREASY GREASY!!!!! SOOOOO OILY!!!!!! Tasty, but OILY!!! They topped it with cubed mozzarella. Which I agree with a review below, tasted like playdoh. Should be a little melted if you popped it in an oven right? Yeah.. no. The Moonshiner was nothing short of way below subpar.You are better off saving your money and buying a slice of pizza across the Hudson in NYC. If you want fresh, tasty pizza and sides, go to Benny Tudino's or Porta. I do NOT and will NEVER recommend Tony Boloney's for anyone who expects quality in the food for they pay for.
2018-01-06,5,Best pizzeria in Hoboken! If you're looking for a specialty pizza, come by Tony's. My go-to menu items are the Grandma Patti & Buffalo Chicken pizzas, Ole & Bad Leroy sandwiches, and any of the jumbo wings. I'm a regular and have tried most of the menu items, including Tony's Taco Tuesday Pizza. The lunch specials are great during the weekdays if you work or live in the neighborhood too. The owner, Mike, is very friendly and his staff is accommodating to everyone. This place is packed on weeknights and weekends!!
2018-01-06,5,Easily the best pizza in Hoboken, and probably the NYC area. Their exotic flavor selections and the incredible taste and texture of a slice are what make me come back whenever I need a pizza fix. My only con to this place is the high price per slice. If it weren't for the price, I'd be dining her everyday for every meal!
2018-01-03,5,Oh. My. Gosh... I HAVE to come into this place ASAP! We did Uber delivery for this joint at like midnight and our pizza was bomb! We ordered the chorizo pizza and it was simply perfection. I love chorizo but never have thought about having it on a pizza. This place nailed it! There's is cilantro and a white cream on it, it's perfectly layered. Simply delicious. I also ordered chipotle mozzarella sticks, which I did not love. I would try them again only if I was dining in. I think the traveling in a container gave the sticks too much moisture and they weren't crunchy or hot and melty.. thankfully the pizza was still hot and crispy and tasted delicious! I'll be in to eat soon!
2018-01-01,1,They have awful customer service and they delivered the food over two hours late. To top it off, they refused to refund our money. Horrible, horrible restaurant.
2017-12-30,2,We have been ordering from Tony Baloney's since they opened in Hoboken. We love the food however as of recent the customer service and delivery has gotten progressively worse. Our most recent orders have been either late or incorrect. Our latest order was one small pizza and a side of ranch. We understand the side of ranch could be a small detail that can be overlooked so after placing the order we called and politely reminded them to please include a side of ranch. The girl managing the phone sounded completely uninterested in our request - not the kind of person that should be manning a phone. When the pizza came, there was no ranch. (Not to mention that we also ordered extra mozzarella and there was no extra mozzarella to be seen on the pizza) We then called back asking for ranch, which came 30 mins later. I really hope Tony Baloneys can get it together and fast. There are many alternatives in Hoboken that are just as good and given the common theme in these comments, people will start buying elsewhere.
2017-12-21,1,Disgusting food. Ordered salads for delivery it was almost $40 dollars and they were filled with water. Called to tell them they said I needed to call delivery.com to handle but they would authorize a refund if I did. I called and delivery.com spoke to the jerk of a manager and he didn't authorize! If you wanna throw money in the trash go here. Willl not be back.
2017-12-18,5,Yesss pleasseee! Environment: Tony Boloney's is a casual spot in Hoboken. There is indoor and outdoor seating. You grab a menu when you walk in and then order at the counter. Pizzas are pre made so you can choose a slice at the glass case and then it is warmed in the oven. Food is delivered to your table. The restaurant is very clean, light, and bright! It's also just a block or two away from Carlo's Bakery so you can wash down your pizza and fries with some kind of sugary dessert...because, why not? Food: Amazing. Besides the taco pizza they magically create, they have some pizza genius that comes up with things like chicken pot pie pizza and French onion soup pizza. There's a long list of specialty pizzas to choose from, along with fries, wings, salads, and sandwiches. Their sandwiches are giant, and the salads are hearty! This is a good spot for everyone since there are things on the menu that could possibly give you a heart attack aka the shit faced fries, which I highly recommend) and options for people on a diet (aka salads)Overall: I can't wait to go back
2017-12-10,4,My nieces love their rainbow mozzarella's cheese. Colorful cheese with natural ingredients. Pizza is ok. Plata is ok. Hard to find a parking tho.
2017-12-07,1,So this was actually really disgusting. Went there today for my birthday and I still am SO disappointed. Didn't even taste like mozzarella cheese more like playdoh. And the pizzas were so greasy i used 5 napkins just soak up all that oil! My friend Jackie asked for a Hawaiian slice and they said they didn't have that but can make it instead. literally gave her a plain slice with HUGE cubes pineapples, and burnt to crisp bacon bits. I tasted the bits and couldn't believe they served that to us! There was no effort at all. I'm so upset I spent $30, $20 for a box of 5 big Mozz Sticks that we didn't even finish. We took one bite and our mood shifted so fast, one small bite was enough for us. I'll be sure to dispute this off my bank account tomorrow morning. The only thing good was the lemonade and black cherry drinks that they get from another company. 1 Star is too generous. Let's hope they don't delete this review as they did to someone else's.
2017-12-05,5,Yummy yummy pizza taco in tummy.. It was definitely worth me straving myself all day for this. Cute little small place
2017-12-03,4,Tony Boloney's has some really great to-go mozzarella that is perfect for jazzing up any homemade italian meal or simply serving on a platter with some cured meats. We love their truffle mutz in particular but they have a rotating selection of flavors that are all great in their own way. Definitely check out their station if you can make it to the Hoboken Mutz Fest (yes, that is a real thing).Tony Boloney's pizza is also great, but my recommendation is to have the slices in-house and eat them while they are hot and fresh. Every good slice I've had of this pizza has been right out of the oven or from a freshly delivered pie. Every mediocre slice has been one that I've either ordered a-la-carte for delivery (room temp for whatever reason) or from the Hoboken Pizza Festival (room temp as well) (yes, another real festival). My very favorite pie is the moonshiner, which is a vodka sauce pie with smoked mozzarella, asiago, and basil - seriously fantastic. I highly recommend ordering this pie in if you're having some friends over and what to try something other than a classic cheese pie. Sometimes you just want a good cheese slice, and this one is truly just a cut above the rest.
2017-12-01,1,We ordered from this restaurant through delivery.com. The food smells so bad that we couldn't ear it and we throw them out without eating. Both sandwich and pizza were smelly. Definitely we won't order from this place again.
2017-11-22,4,Listen, everything at Tony's is good. Not exceptional. But just good. But the diversity of food is outstanding. We're talking Jamaican sandwich's, taco pizzas, mutz sticks with chipotle breading. I can't stress that enough, if your looking for exceptional food check elsewhere, if you want honey bourbon chicken with jalapeños, then they got you.
2017-11-12,4,The manager worked hard to reach out to me to correct this issue. I informed him, the only thing to rectify the situation moving forward is honesty. He agreed and as a kind gesture, sent me a gift card for $25. My husband and I ordered another pizza tonight. FYI, you have to call to use the gift card - there is no where to enter it on their website. I was told 45-55 minutes for delivery. My pizza arrived exactly as ordered, in 45 minutes, and was warm. Much happier with tonight's service and will be ordering from Tony Boloney's again.
2017-11-08,4,Ok ok ok. This place is a big hit on Facebook and stuff but it's ok it's not all that but they do have great ideas for food so it's worth a trip just wish there was more places to sit. But it's a great place for a date lol specially tinder dates
2017-11-06,5,Omg where do I begin... I don't know what was better the food or the service! We were trying to decide what we wanted to order and the staff was so helpful. They notice we couldn't decide from all the wonderful choices and they came over to our table to offer what was hits. I will visit NJ again just to go back to Tony Boloney's. better than any food I at while visiting NYC. Thanks for the great experience.
2017-11-05,5,Ay dios mio mac 'n' cheese pizza and the shitfaced fries are absolutely delicious. I also recommend the tikka pizza, and there are lots of other good vegetarian or vegan options. They always have veggie options available by the slice which is appreciated on a late night walk home! They can be a bit unfriendly, which doesn't seem fit their overall brand. Lots of drunk people blocking you from ordering if you go anytime at night - they don't manage that area of the establishment well.
2017-10-31,4,Their taco pizza here was amazing. It was a bit pricey but it was definitely worth it! They only have it on Tuesdays and their customer service is awesome. I would definitely come back next time I'm in the area. Bring some friends with you because it requires teamwork to complete this mission.
2017-10-29,4,Tony Boloney's specializes in non-traditional pizzas: taco pizza, tikka masala, eggplant, fritos, jalapenos, jamaican jerk chicken etc. Wacky slices, great staff and funky flavors (all good though). Every Tuesday they have a Taco-Pizza or Pizza-Taco, and you can pre-order a pie or just get it by the slice. Prices are pretty steep, an entire Taco Taco Taco Pizza (yes, that's the name!) will cost you $80. Resturant also is known for subs, salads and mutz sticks. The mutz sticks are crusted with Pennsylvania Dutch pretzels and delicious! My personal favorite is the Boken Girl Salad which has baby arugula, Sicilian soppressata, homemade sweet smoked mutz, chopped tomato & hand breaded chicken cutlet w/ a lemon vinaigrette dressing. It makes my mouth water thinking about it! Open late which is a huge plus. Gets pretty crowded after bars close but definitely worth the wait. They also offer a punch card where you can count your subs and slices and get every 10th one free.
2017-10-22,3,I came in yesterday for the first time to visit Tony Baloney's after seeing it on TV. I was impressed with the amount of different pies that they had to offer. I was beyond indecisive after seeing so many different specialty pies so I had asked the girl behind the counter which one she would recommend and she told me this s*** faced was her favorite.  Me not being totally sold on it I asked a customer which one she recommended and the s*** faced was her second favorite so I went ahead and ordered the s*** faced slice. In all honesty I wasn't impressed. It was good but nothing to write home about. Tasted like an average slice of bbq chicken pizza.  Maybe my expectations were too high. I have to guess that maybe part of the problem was the fact that I ordered my slice at 2:30 so I don't know when that pie was actually made and it was slightly warmed up.. it may have been better if it was warmed fully. The staff was very nice and I will say I think the place is a cute little place. I have a feeling though they're going to eventually move into a bigger spot because the place is so well-known. Although my first visit left me unimpressed at some point I will return because I have to try that taco pie!!!
2017-10-19,5,awwww man I loved this place from the moment I saw the pictures, I finally got to try there pizzas. Me and my girlfriend wore craving something new and different so we stopped in and we wore hooked the people wore awesome, very helpful! I don't know what I would if done if it wasn't for the awesome dude at the counter. So to start of they gave this great fountain of soda which has root beer in it! The pizzas wore even better I had a beef patty pizza, chicken and waffle pizza! Awesome! Great! Loved it! And will be back to try that taco pizza..
2017-10-06,4,A place known for Taco-Pizza, Waffle-Pizza, colorful rainbow mozzarella sticks, and of course regular slices. I recently had the chance to try their Beef-Patty-Pizza. It's like a pizza sandwich. The bottom pie looks like an average pizza crust, while the top looks like a different type of dough is used. It looks like a regular pie topped with a centimeter or so of meat with melted cheese or a cheese-sauce and the top part of the pie made with a -different type of dough- is slapped on top of the meat and patted down. I'm not sure how they made it. But it binds well all together to get a lightly thick slice.How does it taste?Though, not great, pretty good!Though, nothing like a Jamaican Beef Patty, having a crunchy shell (which appeared in my head when I heard the name), I say it's more like a beef pizza sandwich or a cheese burger in pizza form. Nothing crisp, nothing crunchy, not much bread-like dough. It's pizza dough, pizza crusted.The meat is not highly flavorful or spicy. I can taste a light flavor spice to it, though. If not liking it for any wow or great flavor/taste aspect. I like the concept, I like the taste, I like how semi-thick and filling of the pizza.I think it deserves more than three stars but not sure it deserves a four star either. But since it surpasses the 3.5 average side, a 4 star it gets.
2017-10-05,5,Tony's is a well known pizza place. So prices are a but high but food is very good. I've only eaten the specialty pizzas. I've had the buffalo chicken pizza and the brisket pizza. Jaw dropping good. Parking is hard, it's Hoboken.
2017-10-05,5,Tony Baloney's among the best pizza in town. Always coming up with unique pizza toppings- I've seen ravioli and full tacos on pizza! Awesome selection of fries. The sandwiches are delicious!
2017-10-02,2,Food: 5/5 stars Service (before tonight): 5/5 The two stars is specifically for the service I received during this visit.Tonight unfortunately was the worst experience I've had in Tony's. The attitude from the girl behind the register (she said her name was Ashley but I doubt she told me the truth) started while we were ordering which we were willing to look past since we were ordering to go and should have been in and out within a few minutes as there were no people waiting in front of us. My order consisted or 2 sandwiches and some mozz sticks, which was placed around 6:20, We took a seat and waited while people came in and got their food and left. At 6:50 she finally asked what my husband and I ordered, only after another customer said she had given them the wrong thing. We told her if the order wasn't ready yet to just cancel it and refund us because we had to leave. She then suddenly decided to check a bag that had been sitting on top of the oven for some time, saw that it was ours, didn't say anything, but instead took the bag to the back, pulled the receipt off and brought it back. My husband asked her if it had been sitting there the whole time and she responded with "no it hasn't" after we watched her take it down, then followed it up with an incredibly attitude filled"it's still warm." With an eye roll. If you don't want to give good customer service, don't work in a restaurant . A simple, "oh I'm sorry I missed it." Would have been a much better response. This girl was absolutely horrible.
2017-10-01,2,Decided to try this for the first time. Ordered an XL cheese pizza for delivery at 8:40pm, delivery guy got there at 10 with the wrong order. The guy left and didn't say anything so I had to call the store and was told the manager would deliver my pizza in 20min. I received a warm pizza at 10:30 from the same delivery guy and the cheese had slid all to one side. So half the pizza had no cheese. Pizza was mediocre at best. Also they didn't refund my $5 delivery fee. Not a repeat customer. 2 stars because they tried to fix the issue asap. Over $30 with tip for a pizza delivered.
2017-10-01,3,Ordered pizza on Slice app at 1:20. Arrived a little after 3:20, after they had quoted 2:30 to 2:45. By 3:20 my friends had all left and I didn't even want it - I was pretty annoyed at this point.It turns out the pizza (plain cheese, Pablo Bastardo, Bap-Bap) was amazing... hence I have upgraded my rating. But beware on the delivery times.
2017-09-28,5,This place is weird but good.  I've never eaten in, but have been ordering delivery for the last few years.  Delivery usually takes about an hour, sometimes a little more, and the food is always hot and fresh.  They're also open pretty late, and will deliver to Jersey City heights which a lot of Hoboken places won't do.  I LOVE their sandwiches and salads.  For a small restaurant they have a huge variety of food and options.  I've never tried the pizza but it's probably pretty good.  My favorite is the Tio Bastardo sandwich (it's basically a pretty good burrito on a decent roll instead of a tortilla).  Fresh mozzarella is really good.  Tony Baloney's is just the perfect great tasty food for when you're really drunk/tired/hungry.
2017-09-25,3,i've stopped in here and ate slices, and i've also done pick up. the place always seems to be busy with a steady flow of customers. they have a ton of fatty food on the menu, prices are at a premium. one time i had a special slice, it was essentially like a garlic bread cheesesteak. it was tasty, but very greasy and definitely upset my stomach later. i also tried the mexican mozzarella sticks. they go for around $12 an order. the cheese sticks are huge! and i really liked the spicy ranch dipping sauce they came with. wasnt sold on the seasoned breading they were deep fried with though... think i prefer the classic style, which unfortunately tony's doesn't have. they do have a pretzel mozzarella stick option that sounded intriguing. for take out we ordered wings and i believe a taqueno salad. the wings were pretty delicious, but a bit expensive. very saucy. the salad was a large portion and the dressing it came with was really spicy! it was supposed to have cotija cheese in it, but it tasted more like mozzarella. will definitely come back here to get more wings and try more of the pizzas!
2017-09-20,4,I finally went to TB's and it was a good experience. However, I cannot say that its the best pizza I have ever had. But its really good pizza. My issue is the price considering I can get a pizza of equal or better taste in the area at a lower price. Now I will not be able to get a onion soup pizza which is why they got an extra star.  Their regular cheese pie is a 3 star, good but not great.
2017-09-20,5,The best pizza in Hoboken New Jersey There were lots of people who were there enjoying themselves We visited our good friends in Paramus and we ate thhere first night We really love it!!!
2017-09-16,1,Awful! Awful! Awful! Customer service is shit! How can someone sign up seamless and then randomly get a message at 1am to say your order is on the way!?Your con artist!? Poor seamless had to refund me! Just despicable! Be ashamed!
2017-09-16,3,Lots of interesting specialty pies, but there are better options for just a good simple pizza in Hoboken.
2017-09-15,1,WOW! I cannot believe the audacity of this restaurant! I have just had the WORST customer service experience of my life at the hand of this unprofessional establishment! I will NEVER eat here again and I will be sure to tell everyone I know not to either!I ordered food at 6:30pm and it did not arrive until close to 8pm.I ordered garlic cheese bread-which arrived soaked in grease and burned to an inedible state and they forget to bring me the dipping sauce that came with it, matzo ball soup-which arrived with dirty carrots that still had the skin on them, and french fries--which were soggy, greasy, and cold.I called to kindly request my money back and the manager, Eddy I believe-told me he would send a delivery person to pick up the food I requested my money back for. REALLY???? As if this was not strange enough, I am sick (I told Eddie this). The manager said they would come pick the food up and THEN issue me a refund. I just looked at the refund and they were CHEAP and did not refund the soup because I picked the dirty carrots and meat out and sent the unwanted items back to them as they requested.I fell asleep waiting for delivery person to come back and pick the unwanted food up-remember, I am sick-I mean I was in urgent care today and left work early. OH, but none of this matters to the insensitive people at Tony Boloney's-they make their sick customers walk burned, greasy, disgusting food bak out to delivery people...The second delivery person WOKE ME UP after 10pm calling to get the food back. Let's recap: -Ordered food at 6:30pm-It arrives close to 8pm-I call the restaurant to kindly request a refund at 7:42pm-The second delivery man calls and wakes up a sick sleeping woman to collect the unwanted food at 10pm-Tony Boloney's restaurant only refunded me for the bread and fries.SO, I called back and spoke to an associate named Aidy (spelling) who informed me the manager "stepped out"-how convenient :-/ Supposedly I will receive a call back from Eddy but I doubt it... I can't believe I had to go through all of this to try to get my money back. Furthermore, I cannot believe I did not receive a full refund! Give me back ALL of my money! NEVER EAT HERE!! I am appalled at this display of unprofessionalism!!!!
2017-09-15,4,We came here solely to try the taco pizza slice on a Tuesday for lunch. It was definitely worth the experience. Place is small and parking can be difficult in Hoboken, but trust me, walk to this place from wherever you parked. You will need to burn off the calories from this indulgence. Eat the tacos on the outsides first then go for the gold and fold the slice with the center taco still on it. Absolutely yummy! Don't forget to hit up the soda fountain for some old school throwback flavors! Fun experience! Definitely would indulge again one day!!!
2017-09-11,4,Sandwiches are delicious! The staff are attentive But the fountain drinks are terrible. Definitely needs an upgrade.
2017-09-04,5,Food is good & hands down with the management stepped up to improve their business.
2017-08-31,5,Tony Boloney's gets 5 stars primarily because they are open until 4 am on the weekends, but also because their pizza is really good. Their menu is extensive and covers just about every avenue and side street in terms of toppings. My favorites would be the Lighthouse Ghost. They also have a great selection of vegan pies!!If I am ever driving back form the city on a Friday or Saturday night, I will usually stop here and pick up a pizza (and if I lived by myself I would have no shame and just pick up 2). It's pretty close to Hoboken Terminal, so if you're coming into the city from NJ Transit and would like a nice low-key lunch I would highly recommend this spot.
2017-08-30,4,I came here shortly after that taco pizza video on Thrillist started making its rounds around the internet. My friends and I came on a Tuesday evening after work and since we had placed an order for a taco pizza the day before, it was ready for us when we arrived. In my order form online, I had specified that I was a vegetarian and to see if it would be possible to add vegetarian tacos onto the pie. The first pie we had received had no vegetarian tacos, but a quick talk with what I presumed was the owner fixed this oversight, and we got our pie, with two slices that had vegetarian tacos on it. As for the food itself? Pretty good. I would recommend eating the tacos first as the whole thing gets rather messy. The pizza itself was also rather tasty, and since the place has so many different pies to choose from, it's worth a revisit. Wish they had more seating available, though, but I imagine that space is at a premium in this part of NJ.
2017-08-24,5,Wacky slices, great staff and funky flavors (all good though). My usual orders are the grandma or the Cuban which are delicious! Grandma pizza: traditional pie with mozzarella, ricotta and sauce but with your choice of meat. I recommend the meatballs because what's a grandma pizza without grandmas meatballs. Cuban pizza: traditional Cuban sandwich on a pizza, literally tastes the same. Can't go wrong. Mac n' cheese slice: spicy sauce with macaroni but has a flavor that I can't get enough ofAnd of course... taco pizza: only available on Tuesdays and well over anyone's calorie budget. Pricey slice but did it for the gram. Personally all my favorite combos so every reasoning why it's amazing and famous.
2017-08-23,2,Hmmm, I was kind of disappointed with the taco pizza tbh. I was really looking forward to it yesterday coming from Philadelphia to visit a friend. the tacos themselves were good but it would have been even better if they didn't forget the guacamole. It was an okay experience to just try once but jeezz an $80 pizza with no guac in the middle.
2017-08-11,5,Amazing variety and so delicious. If you're into craft pizza this is your place. They're open late so it works as drunk food but it's even better when you remember eating it. Location is a bit off the beaten path as far as Hoboken goes but it's worth the trip away from Washington St.
2017-08-11,5,Love this place. It has been a go to for cheat meals for several years now. Whether is a cheesesteak, or a pile of fries, or some sort of delicious pizza concoction, I always end up satisfied.
2017-08-09,4,People LOVE Tony Boloney's and I can see why.  They are very creative with their pizzas and they have a lot of different choices.  I like a classic pizza made really well and they don't necessarily do that.  They more focus on the different kinds of pies, but hey I can respect that.  If want some variety for my pizza, I would definitely go there.I had been there previously and went back to try their taco pizza.  It was really good!  I would definitely tell people to try it.  One slice is $10 or $80 for a pie.  I know it is two tacos, but one slice didn't fill me up.  The pizza was good and the tacos were good.  Also, you can really eat it as a pizza.  Just do the fold and eat each side.  It was really enjoyable.
2017-08-01,3,Tony Boloney's is in the busy city of Hoboken. The parking is street parking but you have to pay. The place is pretty small with indoor and outdoor seating. The place had some seats available, but it was still busy. I've been here twice. The first time, the pizza slice I got was pretty good. I don't remember exactly what flavor though so I came back today to try out this place again. Today I ordered the "Bangkok boardwalk" slice. It has spicy thai sauce, hand battered fried chicken, fresh jalapenos, cilantro, crushed honey roasted peanuts & black toasted sesame seeds. It tasted good for the first few bites, but then it tasted alright. The pizza is pretty oily and the crust was hard to chew on. I came here close to 2PM and there wasn't that many good slices of pizza to choose from. They didn't even have a regular slice. I'm sure the fresh pizza is great and looks amazing. However, the slices that are sitting out all day are alright. The prices here are also a little more expensive than usual. I guess you get what you pay for if you want unique pizza.
2017-07-30,4,The second I saw a picture of the taco pizza I knew I had to give Tony Boloney's a visit. I stopped by last Tuesday with a few friends to take on the popular pie and was so happy I did. I was convinced that I could easily finish my 1/4 of the pie, but beware, this meal is no easy feat. Some things to remember when you make your way down to Tony Boloney's 1. The taco pizza is only available on Tuesday. 2. They do offer just slices, but if you opt for a whole pie it is a bit pricey, $80.3. The restaurant is small and seating is limited. It looked like the majority of business was take out. 4. They have a huge menu with everything from specialty pizzas, sandwiches and salads. 5. If you're not from Hoboken, and driving in, parking in this area is tough. 6. I found the best method to be eating the tacos first and then the pizza. Trying to do it all at once can get very messy. 7. Enjoy! Looking forward to checking out Tony Boloney's again in the future and trying out some other speciality pies.
2017-07-29,4,The yogi pizza (no cheese!) is to die for - can't wait to come back and try the taco pizza!
2017-07-27,4,Tony Baloney's is BOMB. They have THE BEST wings I've ever had, hands down. My go-to flavors are the BAYOU (butter & garlic) and the SAIGON (honey siracha). I don't know how they get the chicken so crispy, but damn. So good. The SH*T FACES pizza is amazing (beer battered chicken breast w/ homemade honey stout bbq sauce, mutz & cheddar). My boyfriend and I usually get one whole pizza and two orders of wings (smallest is 5 wings). The slices are huge and so filling. I've had a few other items on the menu that are pretty good too. I once ordered the TRUFFLE MOZZARELLA sticks (but they gave me the original on accident). Pretty good, but nothing crazy. My boyfriend's gotten a few of their subs and they're delicious as well. I do have to mention that there's been two instances where they gave me the wrong item and the last time I got wings, I asked for ranch & blue cheese sauce, but they gave me garlic butter...not a big deal, but was annoyed. Still, Tony's is the best pizza and wings I've had in my 11 years of living in NYC. You won't be disappointed.
2017-07-26,5,Great pizza! I tried my hand at Taco Tuesdays with the Taco Pizza! I think if it were separate tacos, it would be a legit contender to real Tex Mex. The mozzy sticks are huge! And the pizza slices were so tasty, do some research before you get to the counter as you'll be overwhelmed.
2017-07-23,5,After we were done with the Biergartens we asked one of the guys working security where a good nearby spot for food was. This is where he told us to come.  It's maybe 5 minutes by car away from the Biergarten and everyone has the same idea as us bc it started to get busy. We ordered mac and cheese pizza and chicken and waffle pizza. The chicken and waffle pizza had SYRUP. I was thinking it may not work out for me and that piece of pizza but Wow!!! It was awesome!  The mac and cheese pizza was gooey and cheesy just like mac and cheese but it had the wonder of pizza breaking underneath. This spot is a popular place but the staff keep it moving fairly quickly and are friendly. I loved how many options there were for pizza flavors and it was clean. If I'm in the area again I will totally come back. My kids would get a kick out of it too.
2017-07-16,2,Overall a disappointing experience. We should have gotten Chinese food.. - Taco pizza guys.
2017-07-15,5,Great service, and the pizza's are unique, no doubt about that. Folks are not crazy about their famous chicken & wafflles pizza, but that's why I came here. I ordered something more.appealing to me, but it all certainly smelled great.
2017-07-11,5,Amazing gluten free pizza! Probably one of the best I've ever had.Thin crust, really crispy. Some great and creative topping choices. I went for Pancho Franco on the recommendation of the server and it was brilliant. Light, not greasy and good balance of flavour.
2017-07-08,1,As a regular customer of Tony Bologney's, I was disappointed after  recently purchased one of my favorite pies, The Grandma Patti. I've ordered the pie several times and always end up snapping a picture because the pies are always that beautiful. When I ordered the other day however, I was very disappointed to open the box to discover something unrecognizable to what I've gotten in the past. The pizza, which was supposed to include ricotta & fresh mozzarella cheese, had neither and some of the ingredients that were on the pie, looked anything but fresh. I immediately called the store once I received the disappointing pie and voiced my complaint but was told that the manager was not in but would be in contact with me. It has now been two full days and have yet to hear anything back from management and was never given an option of receiving a replacement for my $32 pie. I feel that the store has become more concerned about going viral with instagramable pizza like their taco pie than their regular customers satisfaction.UPDATE:After writing my review, I was contacted by the business owner, Michael. I really appreciated him personally reaching out and offering a gift card which he said he'd send right away...Except it's now been over a month and no sign of a gift card. Not even a response when I messaged him back over a week ago. He said that he "really values his customers and personally wants to make sure they're taken care of." My question is how are they doing that?
2017-07-07,4,I'm updating my review, now that I finally got around to trying the subs. The Boken Boy is awesome. Can't wait to get it again. Also, the pretzel mozzarella sticks are awesome too (but a bit on the rich/heavy side)
2017-06-30,4,Creative and delicious menu for the most part - can get sloppy late night or when you order for delivery but in store is generally very good pizza.  Most of the staff are friendly and professional but there are some exceptions.  Favorites: winger slice and the shitfaced fries.  Good stuff on the menu aside from just pizza - taco pizza is all hype
2017-06-29,3,My friend went on about a taco pizza and when she showed me the video, I was like okay.  Parking wasn't bad at all on a Tuesday afternoon.  Okay on to the pizza taco thingy.  I think I liked it but I would like it so much more if my taco shell wasn't soggy.  I'm not sure if it is because I got the vegan one though. I loved all the taco fillings though !
2017-06-27,3,If you order an entire pie it will be fresh and I would rate it a 4 out of 5; however, if you come here for a slice or two at 3 or 4pm you will get whatever has been sitting out for hours and hours. Overall it's say they're a 3.5 out of 5.
2017-06-20,5,I live about 20 minutes away and I always come to Hoboken for my pizza because of How It's Made , it's made with love and the general desire to appeal to everyone and their taste Tony Baloney is above and beyond in every way when it comes to satisfaction and the quality of food the workers they're happy to serve you they want to see a good look on your face as you leave. With that said I 100% recommend this restaurant anybody and everybody five stars!!!! And definitely try their Taco pizzas.
2017-06-20,3,Most rude, smug manager of any place I've ever been.  I've worked in food with some smug people before, but I can't imagine how the staff tolerates hour after hour with that guy. Also they treat their patrons like dirt. I asked for a cup of water and they made me buy a bottle of water.The food is pretty tasty though, and they have some creative pies and subs.  Very soggy, overly sauced food.  The pizza will droop and fall apart in your hands, but it is packed with flavor.
2017-06-17,5,At first, I thought my experience here was going to be horrible. I had ordered the taco pizza along with three vegan slices for pick-up for 2:45PM online for a Sunday and even called to confirm. When I arrived there was no trace of my order. As a hungry New Yorker who trekked across the bridge for my first meal of the day (I'm dramatic) my heart broke. But the lovely workers that day, especially one who's name I did not get, made sure I got not only my taco pizza but the three vegan slices. We had to wait 45 minutes longer which I had no problem with because all I wanted at that time was that taco pizza and it was so worth the wait.  And we were given free drinks for the wait as well. And the best part was the taco pizza was fresh. The tacos were flavored very well and the perfect amount of meat and sauce. And the pizza x taco combo worked out great as expected.Would def go back to try some of the other pizza flavors and get that great service.
2017-06-11,1,Awful customer service - girl on the phone hung up after receiving bad feedback. As order still hasn't arrived Don't order from these if you're hungry you may not get it.
2017-06-11,4,Had the taco pizza. Best of both worlds pizza. Very orignal. They have a huge selection of unique slices like Chinese food, philly cheesesteak, etc. A tad pricey for a slice
2017-06-11,5,dont ask any questions... just go here.  been looking for a good sandwich spot in the area and have been disappointed by the lack of flavor in some of the places I have tried out..... I  found some great referrals for this place yesterday on yelpp......and i just have to say....this place tho... is out of control.  i had the gravy train sandwich yesterday and it was the sandwich of my dreams.   and i had the Bolognese fries which was a meal in of itself.  so yea i will be back many times and will bring others.  finally a sandwich spot that has real flavor.  well done guys!    and plus i even liked the dope music that's playing there... i'm pretty sure i will end up trying everything on the menu!
2017-06-05,4,The perfect food for drunk people. My friends and I got fries, chicken tenders, cold subs and wings from here at really good prices. The portions were way bigger than we thought it would be, so it was so worth it. I didn't like the eggplant rollatini sandwich that I got once though, it was really soggy but other than that, it's a good place!
2017-06-05,1,I actually enjoy the pizza here. But I recently ordered two pies from them ($60 worth) one evening which were never delivered. I waited for over an hour and a half, and called them back but no one answered (they were probably closed). I called back the next day with my complaint and was told that I would be refunded.2 days later I get a call back saying that I won't be refunded. The explanation I got was that the delivery person called my cell phone and rang my buzzer, both which were complete LIES. I offered proof that I could show that I never got a call from the time I placed my order, but was told "they did what they could do" and that's that. An absolute 0 for customer service. Rude and uncooperative, this place could care less about the customers - as long as they get paid. Place is a joke, beware of their "delivery service".
2017-06-03,5,I tried this place for the first time today.  Pizza and some BAP BAP (Korean BBQ) wings.  Both were excellent.  Crust was yummy with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  Wings were perfectly crispy with a great sauce and sesame seeds.  Shout out to Joseph for the great service.
2017-06-02,5,Second time visiting again, still some of the best pizza I've ever had!  Got a single slice of their sausage this time around.
2017-06-02,4,Hi everyone,   Great news!   Mike the owner of Tony Boloney's reads the reviews on Yelp!  Mike reached out to me personally to address my original review.  I love that he appreciates feedback and looking to making it a better experience for the customer.  Thanks Mike!!
2017-06-01,4,I like Tony Boloney's a lot.-Wings are good-Pizza is good with a lot of options-Salads are very good/huge but they are over $12 which is a little unfortunately (I would probably get the Buffalo Chicken Salad several times a week if it was a little cheaper).-Sandwiches are huge & very good with a lot of options.  If you are health-conscious probably not for you though.  Wraps are the same price but much, much smaller so I never get wraps there.Recommend!
2017-05-28,5,Great creative pizza joint with fairly fast service. My friend and I had the U.B.T--It was delicious! The pesto mozzarella sticks were also well made. Will most definitely be back for more soon.
2017-05-27,3,I was expecting a huge wait time on Tuesday for taco pizza day, luckily it was empty! Setting: small, picnic style tables with a few high stools near the window..located away from the madness on Washington ave.Food: 10$ for 1 slice of the taco pizza which is Actually cheap when you realize your getting 3 tacos stuffed with meat and a slice of pizza for that price. More than enough to fill you up. 8$ would be more of a steal though!Service was great. Friendly staff, clean establishment.In my opinion, this is more of a one time/occasional try.
2017-05-21,3,Ordered the Ole' on a wrap and fries through delivery.com .  Fries came in abundance with a delicious dip, but were very soggy.  The award winning mezcal 10 spice steak tastes good, but arrived in a messy, loosely rolled saucy mess :/  No forks or even napkins for such a messy wrap. I'm at work, I dont have all these things. It was a struggle to consume the way it was prepared.  Cheap lettuce and tomato gave it a bodega-type sandwich taste. The person responsible for wrapping clearly does not take his job seriouslyWill order from Midtown next time
2017-05-13,1,Seriously if you are going to charge $80 for a plain pie topping it with tacos, can you have the courtesy of adding more MEAT and less CORN? Between 7 people, it costed us 12 bucks for two tacos and a plain slice.
2017-05-09,2,I just ordered my last pizza from Tony's. I'm currently on a 1hr 45m wait and counting for a small pizza and a salad and this is the second in a row this has happened. I'd been a loyal customer for two years but there service has gone downhill. They make a good pizza ... if you have the time.
2017-05-09,5,Ooowwwweeeeeee....thank god for the potheads that came in one day asking for tacos because that pizza taco creation is amazing!
2017-05-09,1,Now, where do I start...my coworkers and I ordered the taco pizza (was cheaper, but now is 85 dollars) and we were very disappointed. It's definitely not worth 85 dollars. We got the pizza and it looks like it been sitting there for hours, the pizza was cold and the tacos were falling off.  Aside from that, unlike the taco pizza they advertised, the pizza that we got was filled with corn, chicken, and beef.  The one they advertised had like 20 something tacos on there and the one we got have like 14 tacos. We paid 85 dollars for a cold and nasty cheese pizza with corn tacos on the top. We end up throwing out half of the pizza.  I can go to any pizza and taco places, order them separately and make a better taco pizza than you guys.
2017-05-05,1,Don't waste your money. Quality has gone to shit. I ordered a small pizza and 5 chicken wings...$35 dollars. For crap. The food came within 20 minutes and pizza was still cold and poor quality. Wings looks scary- poor quality. Go to Johnny Peps- better food, better quality and same price (if not cheaper)
2017-05-04,5,Waited around for an hour to get 2 slices of Taco Pizza but it was all worth it. It tasted yum. A must try. Would definitely go again.
2017-05-04,5,Two words: Taco Pizza! Holy wow. Whatever Tuesday does for you, It's now Tuesday's! This thing is so impressive and a perfect mess. Gotta say that it's even better the next day. Don't skimp and get the whole pie for you and your friends or you can be like me and split it with your girl! Was no easy task as this thing is huge! TB: you just took my top pizza spot! Thanks and being seeing you soon!
2017-05-03,5,Great for a quick bite to eat.  Menu is unique and also has specials plus if you occassionally want to go the healthy route the salads are awesome.  Their mozzarella sticks are awesome since they use fresh cheese and have multiple flavors.  Chipotle ones are a favorite!
2017-05-02,1,Ordered taco pizza a week in advance. Showed up two hours late. Called numerous times and was always told it was "on its way." Looked disgusting. Certainly not the pizza they gave Elvis Duran or Kelly Ripa. Tasted mediocre. Meat was a mystery. Driver cursed me out when I wouldn't sign the receipt. This place got too cool too fast and now is just a dump.
2017-05-02,5,Tony Baloney is the best. I order from here on a weekly basis, everything is always amazing. Recently I ordered the famed taco pizza, made a special request and the owner himself, saw that I received exactly what I ordered and even checked in a few days later to make sure everything worked out. Great service, even better food. I'll be a customer as long as I'm in the area!
2017-04-28,3,I know this place has history but it's not all that. The Cobb salad was the best thing they have lol pizzas and sub are overpriced and not that great.
2017-04-28,5,Best and most creative pizza place in Hoboken, maybe the world.  Their subs are good, but not GREAT like their pizza.
2017-04-27,5,A couple of friends and myself went here today . We went for the Taco Pizza, only to be told that they are only made on Tuesdays and need to be preordered. We soooo disappointed and we explained that we travelled a couple of hours to get the pizza . Well , they were so kind and told us they would make one and it would take one and half hours . Well , lets just say that it did not disappoint. Pure gluttony!!!! Everyone should put this on their bucket list . Also they do have alot of other great creative pizzas. The sodas are different too. Everyone liked the Vanilla Cream soda.
2017-04-25,4,Damnnnnn that was good! Too much I money for me to do again; probably will be for my birthday! TACO PIZZA all the way!
2017-04-24,4,I used Tony Baloney for catering when I was organizing a party in the Hoboken area, I was reccomended by a friend from Atlantic City who swears by their pizza. I was on the phone with Karim initially and he was great! The menu being clear and online made it easy to order as well.The day of the party they gave me a call letting me know that they didn't have kale for my salad (as requested) so I opted for them to use romaine - I was bummed but it was great that they had the decency to let me know. The food came hot and it tasted delicious! The only thing that was off was that they delivered the pizzas, garlic knots, and salad with plates and napkins but we never got plastic utensils. Overall the food tasted amazing and they were so easy to deal with and the pricing was great. Next time I'm not going to use them for catering but instead I'm going to head down to the shop to try one of their philly cheesesteaks - I hear they're to die for!Overall I'm definitely going to make the trip down to Hoboken to try more of their slices - it was divine! Give them a try
2017-04-24,2,Unfortunately I had really high hopes for this place but was very underwhelmed. The menu is so big my head starts spinning when I try to read it so I had my husband make the decision for our first try. We did a regular pizza and a specialty pizza along with cheese fries. There was nothing special about either pizzas, both were soggy, not much flavor, and very rubbery cheese (I love cheese and this was terrible). It looked as though all 3 things were just thrown together without thought to flavor. It was very disappointing as I really wanted to like it! Unfortunately I have yet to find a regular, good quality, good customer service pizza place in Hoboken so far (and I have lived here for 6 years and have ordered from a lot of places). The 2 stars is for the friendly service and quick delivery, too bad the food is just not very good.
2017-04-23,3,Went to Hoboken on Friday night and usually after my friends and I are done bar hoping, we always get pizza at basils but this time we decided to go to Tony boloney. The reason why we came here is cause we heard of the pizza Taco that everyone is raging about and we really wanted to see what the hype was really all about. As soon as we got there we asked if we can order the pizza taco and they said that they only served it on Tuesdays which was a huge bummer. Hence "taco Tuesday" and we were really disappointed cause we walked all that way for nothing. Since we were already there we still decided to order pizza cause why not? I wasn't sure what I wanted cause there were so many things on the menu to pick from so I ended up getting a Buffalo chicken pizza. The pizza was alright but it wasn't amazing and the only thing that bothered me a little bit about it was that it had chunks of actual blue cheese in it and the texture of that with the pizza itself kinda threw me off. If I were to go back there I'd most likely would order something different just to see what my options are.
2017-04-22,1,We went for a friend's birthday last week for the taco pizza. I was not impressed. I asked them over the phone if they have tables inside so we can sit and try to enjoy a meal and the girl said yes.... maybe you should tell people you have only 3 tables and that there's basically no room. I should've known it wasn't gonna be good when I was given a box that was underneath about 15 more pizzas that were sitting there for who knows how long. This place blew up all over the internet and you can tell they don't put as much time, effort, and quality into the food as they used to. * The pizza was not good at all. It was cold. * The tacos were good but from sitting too long on top of the pizza they were soggy and fell apart. * It used to be $65 and now it's $75. * If I ever go back I'm hoping I can just get tacos in a box and not that nasty pizza that was sitting for hours before I picked it up.
2017-04-19,1,This place has horrible organization for a busy night. My friends and I ordered the special taco pizza which included a variety of buffalo chicken, bacon, brisket, steak. But, when we got the large ($75 pizza) it came ONLY with chicken!!! I was so upset wasting time and money on a chicken taco. We sat there and ate, I went up to the owner and asked if we can get napkins (none on the table) and was totally ignored. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The owner doesn't care about his customers and the service was horrible.
2017-04-18,5,If you are craving for a pizza and tacos, you must come here. Every Tuesday they have a Taco-Pizza or Pizza-Taco, and you can pre-order a pie or just get it by the slice. The location is great, the service is amazing too... I was finishing my pizzas and one of the employees came to ask me if I liked it, then I saw him walking around the other tables and asking people if everything was fine. A must go!
2017-04-14,2,I work nearby and one of my coworkers once ordered from here and the food looked delicious. Decided to order another day with coworkers and we were shocked to see a delivery fee of $5, from Hoboken to jersey city. A little steep but we still decided. 1 hour after ordering, I received a phone call from the delivery guy saying he has my order but is delivering in Hoboken first and then will come to Jersey city. He said the restaurant gave him my order thinking it was in Hoboken. We ordered 2 sandwiches, 1 wrap , a slice of pizza, and a salad and so I didn't want the sandwiches and wrap getting cold. I called the restaurant to speak with the owner who was rude and immediately said I put Hoboken as my address. I immediately pulled up my seamless email and verified i put the correct address. He then said he'll talk to the delivery guy who then later called me back and said he'll deliver my order first now. Ok great! 25 minutes go by and still no food. I called the manager again saying that we pay a delivery fee and expect food in a timely manner and warm. Finally the food came an hour and a half later, however the food was cold and there was no slice of pizza. I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to the same manager who gave me a huge attitude and said "what do you want me to do?????" He refunded us half the cost of the order but I expected more. They forgot an item off my order, was late in delivering, blamed me for the address (when it clearly said jersey city), and the food was cold. I didn't tip the delivery guy (charging $5 for delivery fee and then being late, I don't think he deserved a tip). So of course he gave me an attitude. Although the food was good in the end, I probably would still never order from here again. Poor customer service!!!!
2017-04-08,4,I tried the chorizo fundido pizza and it was awesome. They do deliver 24/7 but the downside was the cash only payment
2017-04-08,5,I honestly have no idea what these few bad reviews are talking about . I've ordered through grubhub plenty of times and visited a few as well. Every time the pizza, subs, fries etc have been on point. The service is prompt and they are incredibly honest about how long it will take for them to get you your order and are often early. Since moving to the area about 7 months ago I can honestly say this place is the best in the area in terms of quality , quantity and prompt delivery. I saw a review that said every time they eat their pizza they get a stomach ache...maybe eat less pizza? Maybe your lactose intolerant ? Man people love to complain on yelp about ridiculous things. Get the buffalo chicken sub and some monopoly fries. Prob my go to order that always has leftovers because the "small" fries are easily enough for three people. Great place all around.
2017-04-04,4,The Atlantic City native has found a welcoming home in Hoboken. Tony Boloney's makes excellent pizza with fresh ingredients. I have been here many, many times. Sometimes with friends, sometimes not with friends, sometimes just by myself for a quick slice. It is open late, and usually turns into a madhouse on the weekends, just exemplifying the exquisite reputation this pizza joint has.I will say however that the price per slice is a bit more than most would be willing to shell out, but that hasn't stopped me or the rest of their customer base from basking in its deliciousness. I think above anything else, people are coming here for the quality of the food, which is among the best for restaurants in its category. Would absolutely recommend over the other pizza places in the area.
2017-03-22,5,My job ordered from here for us. I ordered the Broken Grill Salad. Great flavor and a lot of food.
2017-03-17,2,We ordered our pizza 40 minutes before we got here on our way home from work.Once we got here to pick up our order we were told to wait as our order is not ready yet.  It was another 15 minutes before we got our order.Most pizza places in Hoboken would have delivered in half the time!!
2017-03-10,1,After avoiding this place for a few months I decided to give it a try again last night since its literally a block away from my apartment and I was starving. It pains me to give them a one star review, but their pizza never taste fresh and always gives me a stomach ache. I ordered a cheese slice and the pizza was barely cooked (cheese was still bright white not fully melted) and it was very floppy. I didn't even finish half the slice and I was actually starving. I really wish this place was better. I feel like when I first moved in a couple years ago, it was! I don't know what has been happening lately but the quality is terrible. The staff is friendly though.
2017-02-20,5,Man!!   people are brutal w the reviews.. this place is great, good unique pizzas and they're all delicious and everyone in there is super nice and friendly.. the guy offered garlic knots while I waited for my pizza, who does that? Lol.. it's great , love their kale vegan pizza.. sounds weird but it's awesome and I'm not a vegan..
2017-02-17,1,Very bland food, delivered cold. What a disappointment. Pizza across the street at Grimaldis is 10x better. We decided to give them a shot but this is the one and only visit. Bland Swedish meatball sub...cheap sub roll. Pizza like a flatbread and served cold to the touch. Spent $40 on 1 sandwich, a small pizza, and 5 cold fatty wings. Save your money. We are eating as I type and I'm only eating because I'm hungry.
2017-02-16,2,I stopped in late night for pizza. I was definitely not obliterated or anything. Got two pies, one plain, one buffalo chicken. The buffalo chicken was OK, the plain was really meh. The sauce was super bland and it was really floppy pizza. I was really looking forward to the pizza here, but it wasn't all too great. With all the alternative options, I probably won't be returning back for pizza.
2017-02-09,1,Delivery took over an hour for two slices of pizza, when I finally received a call that my food was here....it wasn't. The driver was lost and did not speak any english, could not find him for 25 minutes, once I finally did the pizza was cold and hard. Not worth it
2017-01-30,5,I love this place for pizza and wings! I do think it's a little expensive but not enough to keep me from going back again and again. My favorite is the shitface sauce they use on the wings. I've never had an issues with delivery or my food being cold and I live in Union City so it's a bit of a drive for them.
2017-01-26,5,Most creative yet consistently delicious spots anywhere. Cant eat better than this for the price. Could eat here every night. Keep up the good work.
2017-01-24,4,Delicious pizza. Perfect amount of cheese and sauce. If you don't like doughy pizza then this place isn't for you. I prefer my pizza with a little more crust. Better to eat there than get delivery.
2017-01-19,3,This place is definitely hit or miss.  I typically go to Tony Boloney's a couple times a month as it's pretty close to my apartment.  If you go there after the bars let out, the place is packed and the line is pretty close to hitting the front door; otherwise, there's never a long wait.When the owner/"adults" are there, the place seems to run pretty smooth; however, if they aren't there the place goes to crap pretty quick.  Multiple times I've been in there when the owner wasn't there, the music was extremely loud, the people behind the counter not paying attention, which tends to lead to a wrong order.  I wanted to order TBs last night and called to place my order when I got off the PATH.  There was no answer, so I hung up and tried again, and again, and again.  Each time it went through the recording and no one answered the phone.  Thinking that the place was busy, I walked to the store to place my order.  There was no other customers in the store and there was no one at the counter.  I had to catch someones attention who was in the back to take my order. While I get the owner can't always be there, there should be some level of expectation of how to act when they're not there.I typically get the salads or sandwiches, which I think are pretty unique and taste good.  Personally I think the pizza is awful, it's typically old and never tastes as good as you want it to.
2017-01-14,3,2nd time at it for Tony's, safe to say it hasn't made me a believer. They have an expansive and creative menu here, but the food just does not hit the spot.Service is fine and everything came out in decent timing and tasted fresh, but meh. Their fountain machine was broken also, so we opted for bottle soda (creme soda was pretty good).Again, the food is not convincing. Not sure what it is, but nothing stands and it leaves you feeling full but not satisfied. I had the steak olé, which I ate half of, it was alright. I removed the lettuce and tomatoes, the sauce used was a little weird to me but the sandwich had a kick which helped to a small degree. The fries were good. Fresh.I was told the 500 club rang the same "just OK" bell, although there was a complaint of the inside of the sandwich being too big for the roll overall causing everything to fall out when you try to eat it (i assume this annoys a lot of people).Coming back to Tony's would literally have to be a last resort for me. It isnt my first, 2nd, 3rd choice but if it was the last place open in the area then I guess I'd drag myself here.
2017-01-11,3,Came here the first time and tried a margarita slice, it was pretty good nothing special. The second time I came I tried the lunch special for the Ole' sub which is basically a Philly cheesesteak with chipotle sauce and I loved it! I would recommend trying this sub if you couldn't decide between the many that they have listed. I love that they are open late at night so it's also a good place to come to after a night out.
2017-01-11,1,I ordered a pizza and a drink from them this week, and it was definitely less than stellar. First of all they took over an hour and went over the delivery time to get the pizza to me. When I finally get it, my drink is not even with the order. Great. But that's not the worst part, when I open my pizza, it's cold as ice and the cheese is not melted, the mozzerella is still in blocks. What a waste of money. I will never order from them again.
2017-01-08,1,Ordered a pizza for the first time from Tony's. After several calls and over 2 hours later pie arrived. Of course it's cold and with a town with so many great pizza delivery will never order from Tony's ever again.
2017-01-04,1,I placed an order through their website for a pickup order. I received a rude voicemail a half hour later saying "we don't have your pizza." And that was it. So I called them back and asked them to just cancel my order then since I ordered vegan pizza and there was nothing else I could eat. I looked today and see that I was still charged $19.45 for pizza that I never received. Why bother having things on your website to order if you won't even make it? Isn't that what restaurants do? Give me my money back!!!
2016-12-20,5,CORN PIZZA LADIES AND GENTS. The service is always great and fast. Even if the service sucked I would still go back because I like their pizza so darn much. But the place a slice of heaven and the pizza is fantastic so back off when I'm there because I will fight you for the last slice. I LOVE YOU TONY BOLONEY.
2016-12-15,4,Kick ass sandwiches but their pizza is hard to consider pizza. I like toppings but this place is a bit overboard and if the slices have been sitting out for a while they just don't look appetizing. This place moves a lot of pizza though so nothing is really shriveling up under the glass.
2016-12-13,4,AMAZING for those late nights! I love this place at 2am aftr i have been out and about with friends, this is a spot to get pizza from...heart attack pizza is the best as is the chicken fingers!
2016-12-08,5,We just moved to the area and we love Tony Boloneys. I highly recommend the Ole sandwich, it's one of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had.
2016-12-06,5,Warning: If you're in the mood for just a plain slice of pizza, this is not the place for you.I love Tony Boloney's! Just think of everything you're currently craving and you'll probably find it on one of their slices. So delicious.
2016-12-03,5,Amazing food and service.  Got catered for a party today.  Showed up right on time with piping hot and delicious food.  Everyone asked us where we got it, including people on the street afterwards who could smell our leftovers!  The buffalo chicken pizza was my favorite, wing flavors were great, and garlic knots were awesome.10/10!  Can't wait to eat again.
2016-12-03,1,Ordered the Grandma Patti but what arrived was a watery, melted mess with large inexplicably raw chunks of mozzarella on top of a completely burned  crust (blackened all the way through).My previous order, which should have been a margherita pizza with garlic, showed up as a plain cheese pie with whole cloves of garlic on top. After paying $20 for both of these inedible pizzas I won't be going back again.
2016-11-29,1,I decided to try this place because of the good reviews. I ordered a plain pie and vodka sauce fries - both of which had no flavor what-so-ever. The solid portions did not compensate for the lack of flavor and high prices. $30 for a large pie and fries is a lot, even in Hoboken. The service was okay, not very helpful. Maybe the specialty slices are better, but based on the quality of their plain pizza (the foundation of specialty pizza), this place does not deserve the 4 stars that it has. Sincerely,Dissatisfied
2016-11-21,5,YUM!  Ordered two pizzas for pick-up.  The Winger is amazing!  Never had wing flavored pizza before and this totally hits the mark.  The s#itfaced pizza was also very good.  I often get a simple margherita or pepperoni pizza but this place makes me want to explore.  Will be back for more.
2016-11-20,3,Pretty expensive for a basic slice of cheese pizza, but I suppose it may be worth it for the fancier slices
2016-11-11,5,My husband was in love with this place on many a late night, but I wasn't sold until I checked it out myself.  The food is excellent!  The sandwiches are incredible, big and priced well.  The menu is comprehensive, so be prepared to spend time choosing your food.  The people are great at the restaurant also.  Love the Boylan sodas too!  Never a problem with an order and the pizza is to die for!
2016-11-06,1,Never order the tio bastardo. Probably the most disgusting thing I've ever ordered/attempted to eat anywhere. Love Mexican and crazy themed food options like Tony's is known for however this was just awful. Something that has so many flavors and toppings on a sandwich you would think would taste great.  This sandwich left me feeling sick and just gross.  Literally tasted like nothing but was covered in rubber like cheese and dripping in tasteless sauce. I think if I wanted to feel sick and waste over a days worth of calories and fat I would have been happier going to McDonald's spending a fraction of the cost. Sorry Tony
2016-10-31,5,Place is awesome whether you're grabbing a slice for lunch or satisfying your drunk pizza cravings after the bars on Washington Street at 3am this place is the best.  Crazy slice combinations that are orginal but also taste great.  The owner is always talking to customers and really creates a strong sense of community.  Great pizza, great location, great people, great hours (it's open after the bars to satisfy the hungry late night crowd, my go to after a night out).  I personally love the buffalo chicken slice, general tso's slice (chinese food + pizza = best combo),and margherita slice (amazing fresh Mutz).  They make their Mutz from scratch everyday so it's always fresh.  I know they're working on another location in Downtown Jersey City, and maybe some day the city.  Really wish this place the best, and look forward to seeing them expand to new locations!
2016-10-31,4,Fantastic food.  I typically go here for the salads b/c of my diet but the ingredients are super fresh.  It's like farm to table and I truly appreciate that out of an informal super chill pizza spot. Their ingredients are very simple so I do find that you need to add your own seasonings to the salad which they provide!    They're wings are absolutely delicious as well.  Crispy and well seasoned, plus their house made buffalo sauce needs to be bottled and sold!  Downside there is no option for non - breaded wings, but still excellently cooked.  Overall this is definitely a go to spot.  There is not much seating but if you can stay, the atmosphere will make your experience. I hope you can make the trip.
