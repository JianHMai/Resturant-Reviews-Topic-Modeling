2021-11-01,5,REALLY good value for money! Authentic Mediterranean food and good service. Great combos and platters for groups :)
2021-10-18,5,Great falafel pita pockets! Very authentic and tasty. Goes well with french fries, baklava, and their homemade root beer.
2021-10-18,4,I've been ordering the well made and delicious fare from here for years. Best hummus, tabouleh, and any other Mediterranean concoction you can imagine! Literally the best hummus in Hoboken. I typically order out, but I recently dined in and was fawned upon. Dishes were served warm and prompt, and the food was even better fresh out of the kitchen. I will say that the meat platters I find a bit dry, though the food seems healthier for it. I would recommend saucing it up if you order out, though you likely won't need to if you dine in (and take advantage of the BYOB!)
2021-10-05,1,Had food delivered, portions was very small for 2-3 people as stated and price $$$.Pita was ice cold, falafel taste like old oil and no flavor. It a shame to pay all this money for the food that is not even edible!!!!
2021-09-04,2,We went here recently for dinner and the service/food left much to be desired. We ordered the lamb gyro, mixed grill plate and veggie appetizer platter of baba ghanoush, hummus, falafel etc. I asked for spicy pepper sauce. That came as I had maybe 1 or2 bites left of the food. The lamb was burned and even though I wanted to try the baklava, it never came. I asked for the check no less than 4 times and it never came. Finally we had to go to the counter where the manager (presumably?) was standing to ask can we pay so that I could leave. Ordering was an issue, getting the right ordered items was an issue, and even leaving took over 30 minutes (literally) to pay! We went with excitement over the reviews and sadly won't be returning.
2021-08-24,5,Amazing falafel sandwich. Awesome people. Great service. Highly recommend It was good to find tasty and clean veneration food in Plainfield area. Keep up the good work
2021-07-10,5,Amazing food. Free hummus and baba ganoush starters with Pita bread. We got the vegetarian platter and 40 thieves grill and the rice was great, the meat was cooked extremely well and the food actually came very quickly. Also, best falafels I've had. The service was also great. Very friendly waiters.
2021-07-03,2,We had heard good things about this place but only for takeout food and I understand why. I really want to like this place but I was very disappointed in the service and the staff, also how they handled Saturday night dinner rush. They only had one server for the entire restaurant, there seem to have been another server but that person was very spotty. I didn't really see them a lot. They forgot to give silverware, the food came out very cold and needed to put a reminders to even provide basic things. The seating was very uncomfortable and the overall experience was just not that good. This place is not worth the hype, unless you're doing takeout and then I guess it is OK.
2021-06-18,5,Haven't eaten at the restaurant yet, but ordered take out a few times and it's always been awesome. The 40 thieves meal is perfect for 2 and the hummus is delicious. Also love the beef gyro sandwich with the hot sauce.
2021-05-21,5,I went for iftar the food was delicious, fresh and the service was spectacular. I got the lamb chops as my main meal and falafel as an appetizer and I have no complaints. I'd recommend.
2021-05-14,5,Best gyro subs in the Gold Coast. I love this place and hopefully they will have hookah soon
2021-04-15,5,Ali Baba is one of the most outstanding restaurants in the region. The food is fresh and of the highest quality. The dishes are authentic Middle Eastern cuisine.  The service is first class. Not to be missed!Edward Friedman Hoboken NJ
2021-04-01,5,Ali Baba is great. A long-standing neighborhood restaurant, they offer a wide menu of really tasty Middle Eastern dishes at reasonable prices. Their baba ganoush is my personal favorite side, but everything is delicious. Highly recommend it!
2021-03-28,4,We had a delicious, filling dinner last night! The two of us shared the 40 Thieves Mixed Grill. Had we know that it came with so much food we would not have ordered the Mediterranean salad. The salad in my opinion was the weakest dish of the evening. No real flavor. The mixed frill was tasty and plentiful. The beef gyro was especially tasty. We also ordered a side of lebneh. Service was friendly. Ask for their special hot sauce and garlic sauce. Soooo delicious!
2021-03-17,5,This place is amazing! The food is delicious and the portions are large. Friendly service and staff as well. The chicken tikka entree and 40 thieves platter are my go-tos.
2021-03-16,5,Really enjoy going to this place. Ahmed is great, always taking good care of us. The meat is outstanding, so much flavor in everything. The 40 Thieves dish is my favorite. You get to taste a little bit of everything. Thank you guys for your hospitality!
2021-02-20,5,I love the wings and food that you make!Ali Baba is the best Arabi resteraunt. My grandkids and I always come every week and they always love the food. They have tried every resteraunt with wings but they said yours was the best. Friendly atmosphere. Everyone gets greated by the chief.
2021-02-18,5,Really authentic food, so fresh and yummy, got the vegetarian combo platter and kufta and they were perfect- exactly what you would want/expect if you like good affordable mediterranean food
2021-02-13,4,Good food, good value, nice people. Delicious hummus! Also, the food is always ready CRAZY fast whenever I order.
2021-02-04,5,Absolutely love this restaurant the food is amazing the owner is such a great person and every time I order The food is fresh and delicious. The staff is also to die for I absolutely love this restaurant.
2021-01-29,5,Highly recommend the Vegetarian Grand Combo and Baklava with Pistachios. Other dishes were delicious as well. Takeout hidden gem!
2021-01-05,5,I stopped by on Sunday afternoon for lunch and these guys were amazing! They were friendly, professional and the food was amazing! As a middle eastern person having middle eastern food from my parenrs I tend to be a bigger critic but loved their food! Highly recommend!!  Portions and price is just right. Plus they took COVID precautions very seriously, which I appreciated. Thanks for a great meal!
2020-12-24,5,Definitely a hidden gem! Beauitful, spacious outdoor seating. Their service was on point. As a vegetarian, I ordered their grand combo and was able to easily substitute certain items from the combo for falafels/ babaganoush. Would highly recommend their freshly baked baklava. Initially ordered one between me and my husband, and ended up ordering two moreWill definitely be coming back here!
2020-11-21,5,My wife and I (late 20s) were looking for a safe, comforting, and delicious place to eat on Washington street and came across what concluded as one of the best experiences we've ever had at a restaurant. In short, it is the best Mediterranean food in town.  For more color, the restaurant offers a spacious indoor seating arrangement and a separate sectioned off outdoor arrangement for individuals who are on the fence of either looking to enjoy the weather or bring it inside for warmth.  The ambiance provides an atmosphere for all different types of situations whether its a casual lunch date or a dinner with friends or loved ones. The food is incredible. If you're looking for vegetarian options I'd definitely recommend getting the falafel platter with hummus as well as one of the salad options. For non-vegetarians, I'd recommend getting the mixed platter, Sahara chicken or the skirt steak. As it relates to my experience specifically, my wife and I were welcomed with such warmth and comfort as we chose to sit inside during COVID-19. There was only 1 other couple in the entire restaurant and we were properly seated more than 6 feet away. Ibrahim, the owner and chef, noticed my mask fell on the floor and provided me a new one. He also gave me a food items to sample that were his personal favorites. Once we decided to wrap our date up he provided complementary baklava and we were enamored. THe baklava was extremely fresh and my wife was delighted. Definitely would recommend checking this place out!
2020-11-20,5,Absolutely phenomenal. Ordering delivery from any place is always a risk, but Ali Baba blew my expectations out of the water. The quality of the food was outstanding, additional instructions were followed, and delivery was quick and easy. I'll be ordering from here again!
2020-11-17,2,What happened??  Ali Baba increased prices by 30% over two months.  Ali Baba was our go-to for good middle eastern food in Hoboken.   Now in Fall 2020 they sharply increased prices.  The same salad with chicken that we used to order for $15 just two months ago is now $25. Won't be returning unless they resolve the price gouging.  Not a smart move to loyal customers, especially when there are other middle eastern options nearby.
2020-11-15,5,The food was AMAZING! Went out to celebrate 20 years of friendship and this was the perfect place. The food was fresh and wholesome. Authentic middle eastern food. It is also byob. The owner, Abraham, couldn't have been more of a sweetheart. I highly recommend this place, you will absolutely enjoy it.
2020-11-12,4,Went out to Ali Baba for dinner one night and was not disappointed. I was a huge fan of their tzatziki specifically. My boyfriend and I got the 40 thieves grill mix and everything on the plate was delicious. It definitely could serve two but we ended up getting a little more to eat after.
2020-11-09,5,Let me tell you if you are looking for fresh delicious and great ambience for turkish food this is a excelent place, we went for dinner and order the main dishes the  40's . We will come back for more!!!
2020-11-07,1,Service and staff are great but the food is unfortunately inedible. Couscous had 0 flavor, mousaka looked clumpy, awful and gooey. Really wanted to enjoy this place but unfortunately left without being able to eat our meal. They kindly founded the mousaka, but I will not be returning.
2020-11-05,5,So good. Regret not ordering from here sooner. Two of us ordered a few things to share and we had enough for dinner as well as lunch the next day. Lots of vegetarian options, good portions sizes, super tasty, and a fast pick up.
2020-11-04,5,First time eating at Ali Baba and it was a 5 star experience. From Ibrahim's customer service to the great food. The hummus tastes authentic and fresh, highly recommend the chicken tikka with garlic. This will definitely be our new neighborhood staple! BYOB is a big plus too!
2020-10-22,4,Loved the "Arab Spring". The chicken was some of the best I've had in my life. Portions are a bit too small for my liking.
2020-10-19,5,Got delivery and it was super fast! On a Friday! All around good food and service! Very fresh and a lot of food they give you! It's all authentic food too- you can tell by the light salt taste on everything. My favorite was their falafel & yellow rice! Will order again!
2020-10-15,5,I love Ali Baba. Have been client for over 30 years!! Just started going back as my son moved to Hoboken. Great food. Abe is the best   Definitely check it out
2020-09-29,4,Great Mediterranean spot. The kebab entrees are really good. I've had both chicken and lamb kebab entrees. The meat is seasonsed well and cooked just right.
2020-09-11,4,My friend recommended me this spot for some good Mediterranean food last week so I wanted to check it out. Due to COVID-19, we preferred ordering in, so I can't comment on the cleanliness the place is maintaining or the safety measures they're taking, but I can certainly comment on the food. So, here goes.Now, before I start let me mention this - Mediterranean has never been one of my favorite cuisines because I'm mostly left wanting more flavor in my food but this place definitely was an exception! The food is so flavorful, we loved it!We ordered a beef gyro, Arab Spring hicken, moussaka, stuffed grape leaves, and hareesa honey cake for dessert. Out of these dishes, the beef gyro was my favorite. The meat was so tender and juicy and the tahini sauce added the perfect flavor to it. The moussaka was great too - it had layers of potato, beef, and eggplant along with some cheese and bechamel sauce, all of this will certainly create a flavor bomb in your mouth, so do try this dish out!In the Arab Spring Chicken dish, I felt they could add more chicken pieces. Also the flavor was on the milder side, not my preference usually.It was the first time I was trying the hareesa honey cake and I quite liked it. I think it's made from semolina and then dipped in honey and topped with almonds. Since semolina soaks all the liquid you give it, it creates a really gooey-moist cake. So thumbs up for that too!All in all, a very nice place if you're in the mood for some good Mediterranean food!
2020-08-17,5,Ali Baba is the absolute best! Everything from their hummus to honey cake is delicious and authentic, they give you a lot of food for a good price (especially the 40 thieves plate!), and they are super nice, friendly people who you can feel great about supporting. Also, their chicken wings are way better than any bar in Hoboken.
2020-08-09,5,Hoboken closed Washington street on Saturday night to allow more room for outdoor dining and it was certainly the place to be last night. The weather was perfect and the people were out!  We didn't make a reservation, and didn't have anything specific in mind for dinner. It was 7:00 pm and after spending all day by the water, we were hungry. Walking up Washington Street we checked out the options and stopped at Ali Baba.  Being of middle-Eastern descent,  we were familiar with the offerings.  The menu had a lot to offer, in addition to the entrees, appetizers,  salads, soups and desserts. The young waiter welcomed us and recommended the Mixed Grill for 2 ($31).  We took his suggestion with the intention of ordering additional appetizers or something later, if needed. Within a few minutes,  he brought our beverages (their own diet root beer, in glass bottles, which was very good) and a plate with hummus and babaganoush, a small basket of pita bread and a small salad.  We began enjoying the flavorful appetizers and a few minutes later he brought our Mixed Grill platter. The meats and vegetables were nicely seasoned and cooked well. The rice had a nice yellow tint (saffron, I guess) and was cooked nicely.  The atmosphere added to the overall enjoyment of the food. Surprisingly,  we finished our meal, and had no room for anything else, not even dessert.  Total was $52 for 2, including tax and tip I'm very happy that we chose to visit Ali Baba and look forward to going back.
2020-08-05,5,Loooove this place! Everything is delicious and the delivery is always so fast. They even deliver warm chicken on the side of the salad. Can't recommend enough.
2020-08-02,5,Really great customer service by the owner and the waitress who we've encountered when we've dined in.Lamb kofta is always juicy, but my favorite are the lamb chops.However, the main reason I like this restaurant a lot is the original flavored harissa cake and mint tea. The original harissa cake is extremely delicious. Not too sweet and is perfect for people who like coconut cake that's not too sweet and corn bread. Love it!
2020-07-17,5,Amazing food and really friendly staff!! We ordered the Forty Thieves Grill Mix for me and my husband and it was plenty of food. All the meats were perfectly seasoned and juicy. The honey cake is also delicious. We will definitely come back!
2020-07-16,5,Love it here! One of the best bangs for you buck in Hoboken when you see the portion sizes. Everything is always fresh.
2020-07-07,3,The atmosphere is nice in general, and service is good too, so this review is exclusively about the food.I was quite disappointed when I ate there the 4th of July of 2020. I've been to Egypt myself, and my stepdad is Lebanese, and so I've been exposed quite a bit to arab gastronomy to have some judgement when I try new places. Also, I couldn't help but compare the food quality with that of Al basha, a restaurant I frequent in Paterson, NJ. With that being said, there's a few things I would like to mention:Price:  not extremely expensive compared to other restaurants in Hoboken, so I guess it's fair for the area, but I felt like I overpaid because the food didn't meet my expectations.Hummus: the hummus consistency is quite tick, and tastes like the supermarket hummus... if you are a fan of that I'm sure you will like it, but I'm used to a smoother-in-taste-and-consistency hummus... probably with less garlic, but I'm unsure exactly what is in excess... it's all about getting the proportions right. The presentation was good, and I still enjoyed, but far from meeting my expectations.Tabbouleh: sometimes I play guessing how good an arab restaurant is by the quality of the tabbouleh because sometimes they add too much wheat, or too much onion, and so it doesn't look green and rich, or it doesn't taste right. This tabbouleh was green, but it surprised me and really threw me off when I tasted cucumber... it had cucumber. Neither in Al basha, nor in Michigan, nor any restaurant I went to in Egypt they add cucumber to tabbouleh... I didn't like it, mostly because I didn't expect it there, but also I hate cucumber, so not my jam. My friend, however, likes cucumber and so he ate it... but I really couldn't enjoy this salad in particular.Pita: unfortunately it was cut in small pieces, probably divided a pita in 4 parts... we sort of like to sandwich our meats and mezza, so this experience was lost. The bread was warm and good itself, though.Meats (40 thieves platter for 2): it felt like enough meat, and with enough appetizers/mezza 3 people can comfortably eat from it, however compared to the Al basha platter it's VERY small. The chicken was exceptionally good... not dry at all and nicely spiced. I also liked the shawarma! Overall it was a very disappointing experience, but I don't want to curse the restaurant because I'm sure other people can like their food. I just simply had different expectations since arab food is my second favorite.We liked the BYOB... wished they had ice buckets to chill bottles tho.Thank you!
2020-07-04,5,Loved this place. First time coming here with my sisters and was pleasantly surprised. The chef Abraham himself came to tables and checked if everything was good. I had the grilled chicken gyro with their  yogurt sauce which was amazing. My sisters had the lamb curry stew and tabbouleh. The price was great and the food was exquisite! We will definitely be coming back here!
2020-07-02,5,What a gem in Hoboken! I'm so happy to have stumbled across this place. The portion sizes are great, price is more than reasonable, and food is absolutely amazing. There's plenty of outdoor seating over a fancy artificial turf with overlying patio lights. The complimentary pita bread was served warm and toasty. We finished the whole basket in minutes. The hummus and baba ganoush were the freshest I've ever eaten. The hummus had a refreshing lemony tang to it which was the perfect appetizer in a breezy summer day. My boyfriend and I got the 40 Thief Grill and was blown away by how delicious every piece of meat and vegetable is. The steak and lamb kabobs were so well seasoned and so juicy! Every bite of the lamb kofta was heavenly with the aroma of a million spices. The roasted tomatoes and onions were also a refreshing, sweet contrast to the grilled meats. Service here is above and beyond. We had a rather large group and the owner immediately brought out another table and chair to accommodate all of us. The server was also friendly and offered great recommendations. My friends absolutely loved their dishes. The owner was also very welcoming and let us try the pistachio baklava, a dessert I most highly recommend by the way. The layer of sweet crunchy pistachio topped with buttery crust is so addicting. I will definitely be back! Can't wait to enjoy great food again in the perfect location.
2020-06-28,5,This place has been around 38 years and it's no accident. Abe the owner is a perfectionist and the food is always excellent. His staff is very attentive and professional. If you live middle eastern food look no further. I have never had better falafel, ever. Make sure you save room for dessert.
2020-06-23,5,Ali Baba is one of my go-to spots in Hoboken! The food is always tremendous and always fresh and delicious. My boyfriend and I love the 40 Thieves Grill Mix, which is a great value for two people. The service is also excellent and fast. The workers are also very welcoming and nice! We can't wait to go here for dinner again!
2020-06-23,5,I was just blown away by this place. The staff was extremely nice, helpful, and answered all our questions. The food came out very quick, from the hummus, falafel, rib eye, lamb chop, gyro etc... My friends and I had a royal feast! It is just mind-blowing how good the meat, vegetables and the overall dishes were. Let me finish this review saying that the mint lemonade was the best I had in my life, not too sweet, not too sour. Just very well balanced. If you're in the area and hungry, you have to come to this place.
2020-06-21,5,I. Love. This. Place! This is the best restaurant I've been to in all of Hoboken thus far. My boyfriend said he feels like he's died, gone to heaven and was greeted by 70 virgins at heaven's gates. The 40 thieves grill mix is so delicious and perfect for 2! Great variety of flavorful meats, vegetables, rice and hummus. The tabouleh is so fresh and compliments the spices of the meat so well. I loved the Turkish coffee and harissa honey cake. If you love a robust coffee with a warm and moist cake I highly suggest you try this sinful combination.The service is always quick, the people here are great and the food is consistently killer. I will be an Ali Baba customer till the end of time.
2020-06-09,5,Our first take out order, being stuck at home and wanting something different, we thought how about Alibaba?  I called and the owner answered and I was thrilled when he said they would deliver to me in Weehawken! We are exactly 2 miles from their place.  He was very pleasant and said absolutely.  We ordered a lot because we couldn't decide and we thought well we will have leftover's!  We ordered Spheeha Pie, Spinach pie and stuffed grape leaves app's. dinners were  40 Thieves Grill is a great house specialty for two people it has Grilled Chicken, Lamb Kabob, Beef Gyro and Kufta along with grilled veg and rice, a white garlic sauce, baba gannoush and hummus. Absolutely delicious grilled meats.  All cooked quite nicely and not dry at all. Lamb chops dinner, absolutely a keeper seasoned lightly but perfect. Chicken Tandoori  which was juicy and spiced perfectly.  Could not decide which Chicken dish to get but gentleman who took my order said this was his favorite. The dish wasn't "spicy" it was just seasoned just right making it delightful.  The whole meal came quickly, it was hot and we really enjoyed every bit of it.  We had leftover for the next night which made us pleased.  Cannot wait to be able to go in and sit down and eat.  People very nice to deal with and delivery man very smiley :) They have been in business for as long as I can remember and their attention to their food proves why they should be.  Wish we would have ordered earlier during the shutdown to support them but plan to order again very soon.  Delicious!
2020-05-29,5,Friendly staff and AMAZING food. Everything we ate was fantastic. Will be coming back soon!
2020-05-22,5,ordered takeout through yelp and my order was ready before time and they were amazing about following social distancing rules. We got the 40 thieves and it was delicious! Highly recommend!
2020-04-28,5,We have lived in Hoboken for about a year now, but only recently started ordering from Ali Baba. All I can say is, wow, we've been missing out! Food is consistently delicious across the board. Everything from the falafel to the baklava is fabulous. Delivery is always prompt and food arrives hot. Now we order at least once a week! Can't wait to visit in person when they are able to open up again!
2020-04-19,4,Decided to check this place out after hearing good things and I was pleasantly impressed. I got the lamb kabob entree for dinner and it was delicious. The meat was seasoned so well and the white sauce that came along with it was a great compliment to the lamb's flavors. Just one downside was that I felt the entree came with too much rice and not enough meat. Overall I'm happy with my experience.
2020-04-18,5,Always receive great meals from Ali Baba. The food comes hot and the delivery time is accurate. Portion size is good and the meat is very tender and tasty. Will be ordering from here again!
2020-01-19,4,Great food, the kababs are to die for. Very tender and flavorful. I have been here twice but not disappointed even once.
2019-12-28,5,Amazing food with great service. Have been coming here for years and the consistency of the food and quality keeps me coming back. We recently catered for our holiday party and the food was incredible and presented nicely while also staying warm. Highly recommend for lunch dinner or catering parties !
2019-12-07,5,The food is great- go for the lamb kabobs.  And Ibrahim makes you feel like you came into his home for dinner.   Great on weeknights, weekends and for takeout.  Love this place.
2019-11-26,1,I'm not sure if they got a new owner or I just order from here too much and are taking me for granted but the quality has gone down. I ordered the lamb stew and the lamb wasn't stewed. The lamb was grilled. I know lamb I'm Greek. It wasn't tender like it use to be. If they didn't have it they should have told me.
2019-11-23,5,What a wonderful family operation. Their Chicken Tikka Is spicy and delicious and tender. Their falafel is perfectly crisp and seasoned. When we complemented them they told us everything is made fresh and we believed it because it was fantastic all the way down to the grape leaves and the baba ghanouj. I highly recommend it. Handsome and friendly waiter too ;)
2019-11-15,4,Such a good and cute Mediterranean place! The service was awesome & super quick.  We shared the 40 thieves grill mix it was sooooo good! Definitely recommend getting that if it's your first time there!
2019-11-10,2,Disclaimer: been spoiled by really great Mediterranean places in Morristown, Montclair and obviously the city. After trying a second time, to make sure it's "scientific," left underwhelmed with quality and overall experience... Among other things, it's pretty disappointing when you order $28 medium-rare lamb chops and they come out well done, and the chef is indifferent. That said, staff is pretty nice.
2019-09-29,5,Awesome food! We heard great things so we finally decided to try them, and all of the food was amazing! We came back already 3 times and it's consistently delicious. Super satisfied with both the service and food! Recommend ordering the babaganoush and the platter of meat. Amazing!!!
2019-09-14,1,I have a lot to say about this restaurant but in short just don't go there. First of all, it is not a Turkish restaurant. It is Arabic kitchen! Secondly, food is terrible. Do NOT trust the images. They're totally fake! It is awful. I ordered one of the dishes and got only bite and returned it and i paid $30 for it. Still everything is fine. I mean, food can be terrible but the staff is worse than the food too!Waitress tried charged me %18 tip for such an awful food. I went to Ali Baba for four people and paid $153 with the highest tip without asking me. I told them the tip is too much. Then I paid without the tip. So, for few days I found out that Alibaba charged me twice! First for $153 and $139. I called them for such a terrible mistake and they told me that they can not cancel the transaction which I am sure that all restaurants are able to do that. So, i called my bank to cancel transaction. After waiting to hear from the bank, Alibaba called me for their mistake and they told me that I should come to the restaurant. I went there and they told me that they can transfer the money to my credit card. Now, I find out that they charged me again for $149. I just wanted to have a good time in that restaurant and I've been regretting for weeks. PLEASE DON'T GO THERE!
2019-09-13,5,Everytime I go to Alibaba, it never disappoints me. The serving is huge, price is reasonable and service is fast. Whether I am on vegetarian diet, their crispy and flavorful falafel, fresh tabouleh, Fattoush Salad,  Baba Ganoush and Spinach Pie is sooo satisfying that I dont look for meat. And when I am in the mood for Steak, their Rib eye and their plate of sampler - The 40 thieves Grill, combination of grilled chicken, lamb, beef and Khufta Kabob just exceeds my carnivorous craving.Their Mousaka, Hareesa-Honey Cake and Mamoul with dates are highly recommended. Finish up your Mediterranean experience with Ayran and Turkish Coffee.
2019-09-13,3,Ali Baba is a decent ambience Mediterranean restaurant located a quick 10 minute walk from Stevens Institute. I do not understand how the prices are marked. You can grab a big falafel sandwich for 5$ but if you order a falafel platter it costs $12.The staff is extremely helpful. Our server was a young engineering student from NJIT who was extremely helpful. He spoke to us about School and walked us through the menu. We went there for an evening snack and as a vegetarian my options were limited.Falafel sandwich - the classic Mediterranean plate. Contains peppers, some lettuce, tomatoes, falafel, tahini and hummus. Generally a falafel has flavours of fresh herbs. This one didn't have those fresh flavours. The hummus was a little sour. The sandwich was pretty average.
2019-09-10,4,Ali Baba is an overlooked gem in Hoboken--I've been grabbing a bite there on and off for the last 10 years since I moved into town. The food is delicious and always great deal. The Chicken Tikka sandwich (or platter ) is amazing--I literally get one every time I go there. Recently had the vegetarian platter and it was also great. Staff are really nice as well.Seven Valleys recently opened up down the block and people love it, but I think the food at Ali Baba is WAY better. I'd give them 5 stars, but the only thing they're missing is ambiance--it feels like an old Mediterranean place from Bleeker street in NYC and is too dark. It's fine enough, just doesn't grab your attention, invite you in, and inspire you to stay awhile. A lighter, fresh coat of paint, some new furniture, and a few aesthetic improvements to modernize it and I think they'd be right there w/ Seven Valleys for a great afternoon or evening out dining. Ali Baba--if you see this post, once your ambiance matches your amazing food and really friendly staff, I think you'll see even more groups of friends and families who want a night out and some amazing Mediterranean food. Show Hoboken how good you guys really are!!!
2019-09-08,1,This place is poorly managed. There was only one waiter on a Sunday night. He was all over the place. The food we order invoked a lot of meat dishes and it came awfully fast. As the result would have it it was cooked too fast so the kababs were burnt from outside and still uncooked from inside. Salty. And just not good. Mind you, they charge 4% extra if you use card. All in all there are million other better Mediterranean places to try. Please save your from here. It's pricy and not worth the money at all. Disappointed.The review is for the restaurant that I was in. Hoboken.
2019-08-31,5,Very great food and great owners! Their hummus and pita is great and I love their chicken tikka sandwhich
2019-08-30,4,I would give this place 3.5/5 stars. The staff is very friendly and it seems like a very homely restaurant. We ordered the Sahara Chicken and the Falafel platter. However, the food came out way too fast and after tasting it, I started to doubt how fresh it was. The falafel was very tasty, but the hummus on the platter was very sour and didn't taste right. The salad also was kinda sour, they just put a lot of lemon over it and The pita was also chewy and not fresh. The rice with the Sahara chicken was very fragrant and the chicken was very flavorful. The baklava was amazing! They had an extensive dessert menu and as someone who has grown up in Abu Dhabi, I loved that.
2019-08-02,5,We loved the place. You get the vibe that you are in some middle eastern country's restaurant. The ambiance is amazing. They have musical instruments hanging on the wall. Their food menu is quite diverse. They have both vegetarian and with meat, wide verity of food options. We had Lamb Chops, Chicken Tandoori, and Vegetarian Couscous. We end our meal with Baklava and some Turkish Tea. It was all delicious. I loved the staff. They are friendly and helpful.
2019-07-28,5,Loved the food. Deff better than many close Mediterranean restaurants.Falafel is amazingly crispy n flavorful.
2019-07-28,4,I got the Garlic Chicken Entree because it was recommended to me and enjoyed it very much! It came in a huge rectangular platter with rice, grilled onions, and salad. Salad comes with the standard iceberg lettuce (I think?) and purple lettuce, with red onions, olives, tomatoes, with a respectable little block of feta cheese. The chicken was not bad, and it came with some sauces (garlic, takiti -idk if I spelled that correctly- and barbecue sauce). The star of the dish was the rice! So fragrant, delicious, and a bit sweet. But the thing that I absolutely LOVED from this place was the pita bread. We got the Baba Ganush and it came with warm, soft, chewy pita bread. It was so so so good. We tried to get the pita bread we couldn't finish and I accidentally dropped it :( Prices are satisfactory, but I think it's a bit expensive for Middle Eastern/Turkish food. 4/5 delicious food, but a bit pricey.
2019-07-27,5,I've been coming to this restaurent for the past thirty years; and it's amazing how attentive the owner operator is to our every need. This time, I took my two grand daughters and my wife to have dinner. We ordered various dishes; my wife and I ordered the Ripeye steak, and my grand daughters ordered the lamb chops and the buffalo wings. The food was exellent as always; the staff were attentive to our every request, from " ... more sauce please" to " can you make it medium; not well done like all the Arabs like it!" . Any way, I hope to keep coming back for thirty more years...
2019-07-25,5,Really fantastic food..great service and we thoroughly enjoyed. It is a BYO and the prices were reasonable for the quantity and quality of food!!
2019-07-23,5,An amazing spot to grab lunch or dinner! The service was quick and waitresses extremely kind. The food was beyond amazing! I have been a long time lover of mamouns but after coming to Ali Baba I have switched allegiances. You can tell that Ali Baba's food is homemade and made with love by the fact. Their falafel is to die for, definitely the best falafel I've ever had and the best in Hoboken by far!  My friend and I came here for a late dinner about an hour before closing and the service was still great! We didn't feel rushed at all and the food tasted fresh. We shared the 40 Thieves Special and got a falafel appetizer. The portions were perfect and simply delicious! If you haven't tried this little gem I'd highly recommend! I cannot stop raving about it to all my friends :)
2019-07-18,5,Yummy grilled foods and gyro. The yellow rice is lovely, with saffron (I assume) and raisins. The tabouleh is perfect, with all that good bright green parsley and tang. I'd like to see them offer wheat pita, but that's a small thing. The other day I placed a decent-sized order and they gave me a delicious slice of baklava on the house.
2019-07-12,3,I can't speak for much of the menu because I don't eat meat, but all of the vegetarian options are exceptional. The owner is usually there and he's a really nice guy. However, I felt a little scammed by the fact that they automatically bring you a bottle of water without asking and then charge you for it.
2019-07-08,5,I had the kufta kebab and lemonade. Came with a nicely seasoned rice and the typical grilled tomato and onion. Also came with a nice little salad and pita bread. The lemonade was tasty as well, thought it was cute how they added the slice of lemon and mint. Great combination! I ordered delivery and it came super fast. Their attention to detail is great, I look forward to visiting the restaurant!
2019-07-02,5,Excellent food, the best middle eastern food I ever had, homemade, great service everyone very friendly, definitely will come back again and again
2019-06-18,5,Came here with two of my best friends. We got the 40 Thieves Platter which says for two but the three of us barely made a dent in it. We also got the lamb chops and falafel appetizer. Excellent food all around and super friendly service. The owner was engaging and funny and was definitely as much a treat as our dessert.
2019-06-16,5,Ibrahim and his team go above and beyond to make sure that you have an amazing experience. Ali Baba is historical, delicious, and a place I will continue to go to. Ibrahim has been so kind and will go out of his way to make sure that your food preferences are noted and will make things as you like them based on his recommendations. Highly recommend and will definitely come back again! Thank you, Ibrahim!
2019-06-11,5,One of the best Middle Eastern restaurants you can eat in.Very delicious and fast as well.Thumbs up.
2019-06-02,5,Great customer service- I called to say I was disappointed with a part of our order and Ibrahim, the owner, came on the phone to speak to me directly. He could not have been nicer and more responsive. This is a business owner who cares about his customers. I told him I was happy to receive an order of hummus on my next order.  The next thing I know the doorbell rings and Ibrahim has sent me dessert and replaced the items I was unhappy with.It was all delicious and Ibrahim really cares about making his customers happy. Will definitely order again.
2019-05-07,5,OH. MY. FALAFEL. I recently found my great love for Mediterranean food. I had the day off and knew I needed a fix. I found Ali Baba and was a little unsure when I arrived, but they proved me wrong. The service is great, they are very patient and kind. This was some of the best falafel and lemon chicken I've ever had. The portions are huge by the way, especially for those lunch specials. Their lunch special prices and portions can't be beat. I will be back to try more entrees I have my eye on!
2019-04-28,5,Had a fabulous dinner with my daughter. We bit into our falafel, looked at each other, and said is this not the best falafel you've ever had? The hummus too, was the best I've ever had. It tastes like exactly what it is -- a family recipe, handed down from mom, (may she rest in peace) as it was explained to me.The owners work long hours and you can taste their passion and commitment. Very nice people. Extremely hospitable and warm. Waitress was sweet and efficient. I would come back in a heartbeat.  Ali Babalicious!
2019-04-27,5,I normally don't take the time to write reviews, but this place deserves one. The quality of the food here is excellent and it shows in the taste. I ordered the 40 thieves grill plate which gave me a generous portion of meat and sides. It was well worth the price. Also, the gentleman working the front register was very nice and ensured I had all the right sauces and utensils. I could tell he took pride in the restaurant. I will definitely be ordering from here in the future!
2019-04-27,5,Had falafel sandwich - best I've ever had, including outside the US. Low price, esp considering how good it tasted. Excellent service and short wait time for early dinner on a Saturday.  Talked with owner and waitstaff, everyone was kind and friendly.
2019-04-19,4,I came to ali baba for a family dinner, and the owner was so kind to us. I ended up trying their hummus and chicken kebab with their mixed rice ( I wasn't a huge fan of that but my mom loved it- it had a very woody flavor) but the chicken was seasoned well and it was also a good amount! The hummus was a little bit on the more grainy texture and also more nutty than I like in my hummus, but its really a matter of preference. Overall would recommend if you like middle eastern flavors!
2019-04-19,2,I Wanted To Love This Place, So Decided To Give It A Try... I Ordered The Lamb Chops 28.00 And Split Pea Soup 8.00.. The Lamb Chops Were Very Tough (Supposedly) Cooked Medium Well, They Had Zero Flavor, The Soup Had Zero Flavor It Was A Bowl Of Green Nothing... The Rice Had No Flavor.. What A Disappointment Of Almost 40.00... I Like Flavorful Food, This Just Wasn't It!!
2019-04-05,5,Best restaurant in Hoboken! Enjoyed a pleasant visit with a wonderfully pleasant host in Ibrahim who runs the place. The food is absolutely delicious! I ordered the tandoori chicken over rice and it was amazing. Followed up with some delicious dessert. Don't miss out!
2019-03-31,5,This is one of my favorite places to visit in Hoboken! Love love love the food. Abraham is the very best! Shout out to you! You won't regret eating there.
2019-03-31,5,Really good food! The owner is a very sweet person and ensures everyone leaves the restaurant happy .Ordered the Veg combo platter and lamb chops. Everything was yummy!!!!
2019-03-30,5,This place is a very good Mediterranean food option in Hoboken.  The menu is friendly for vegetarian folks. We tried spinach pie, veggie combo and babaganush. Needless to say, they tasted good. Pitas were soft and hot sauce paired really well with Falafel. Host Ibrahim was friendly and he ensured that he attended to every guest in restaurant. I would highly recommend folks in Jersey City / Hoboken region to try this place for weekend dinner
2019-03-29,5,Pleasantly surprised with this place. The food was delicious and so were the accompanying sauces. My Mom loved it too and she is hard to please. I will definitely come back here again.
2019-03-27,5,Fantastic service, fantastic food! There was so much warmth and grace in Ibrahim's food and hospitality! We had the veggie platter, fries, Turkish coffee, mint tea. A purely delightful meal. We topped it off with some excellent Turkish desserts. Will definitely be back soon.
2019-03-26,5,Good food! The veggie combo was really good and gave a great overall taste of all the flavors! Must try!
2019-03-17,5,This is our favorite go-to place in town. The food is authentic and delicious. Ibrahim, the owner, puts his heart into his business and he is passionate about serving quality food.
2019-03-16,5,Extra ordinary food , and stellar customer service. The owner Ibrahim is an extremely sweet man and makes sure everyone leaves his restaurant satisfied anf happy. I ordered 40 thieves platter - comes with a side of hummus and babaganoush priced appropriately for 30$Also ordered chicken tikka platter. Generous food portions and very affordable.Highly recommend.P.S- Ibrahim I am the Union city girl :)
2019-03-09,5,The is a rare gem in Hoboken.  Did a family lunch and Abraham, the owner, didnt miss a beat a delivered one of the best meals I've had in Hoboken in a while.  I respect he riles his sleeves up and respect his passion.  You can taste the hard work and it was reinforced with an award for NJ best Mediterranean Restaurant. We danced around the menu, Forty theives was legit and those wings are obsessively memorable!  I went in with no expectations and walked out, absolutely blown away.
2019-03-09,5,Went to Ali Baba today for a birthday lunch, and everything was so good! They gave us hummus and falafel to start on the house, both really good! Everyone enjoyed their meals, which consisted of the 40 thieves mixed grill, kofta and chicken kabob. Ended our meal with homemade baklava which was delish! Definitely will return!!
2019-03-03,5,The Ibrahim family wants to thank you for the amazing service and food. I knew this was going to be authentic when the owner said his mom is in the kitchen. I saw the cutest little lady working wonders in the kitchen. Nice big portions and their kebab is on point! And before you leave make sure you have their Turkish coffee. Overall great authentic food and reasonable prices for the area. Will definitely be going again very soon.
2019-03-02,5,My boyfriend and I just moved here and have been eating our way through Hoboken since we landed. We absolutely loved Ali Baba! The owner is friendly and excited for you to eat his food and it shows because everything was absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the lamb kebab on the recommendation of the owner and he said it was some of the best lamb he has ever had. If you are visiting or new to the area you need to make this place a priority.
2019-02-26,4,I arrived before my date and was greeted and chatted up by Abraham, who runs this delicious restaurant. Incredibly friendly and hospitable, he made a really good evening even better. My date and I shared the "40 Thieves Mixed Grill," which was a perfect sampler platter cooked just right (almost medium). Of special note was the rice -- fragrant with raisins and nut slivers. I asked Abraham about and he explained how he thought this was the best rice after sampling many of them and had it imported. I asked how he cooked it, and he lovingly explained how it was done.I highly recommend a healthy delicious dinner here and of course, you have to say hello to Abraham.
2019-02-21,5,I ordered food to be delivered at 9.45pm yesterday. Once I completed my order, I received a call from this friendly Ali Baba guy when I wanted it to be delivered specifically. I told him I was just heading home from work and that I would't be home before 9.45pm. He was super friendly and left me this surprise dessert with the message 'happy wednesday from Ali Baba for working hard'. This made me smile. That's what they call customer service! And the food was great!!
2019-02-19,5,The food and service was amazing! You can't go wrong with anything you order from this restaurant.  You can tell the employees and owner care so much about their customers, food, and restaurant. Definitely coming back!Oh, and don't leave without trying out some middle eastern coffee ... on point!
2019-02-17,5,Came on a whim, the owner came out and talked to our friends. He was so super sweet and passionate about his restaurant. I would encourage all people to check this place out! Great food and they also give out free hummus when you come in. He also gave us free food and the food itself was amazing
2019-02-11,5,Just got back from Ali Baba where I went with an old friend to get something to eat.  The owner and chef, Ibrahim was incredibly friendly and suggested the Forty Thieves platter for two so we would have our choice of all the meats and some hummus and babaghanouj to go with it.Loved this platter and it was just enough for the two of us without wasting any food.  The dessert, however, was the best part.  Ibrahim's own recipe of warm blueberry basbusa a la mode was just incredible.  There are three other variations on basbusa I'm planning to go back for.We ended it with the perfect Turkish coffee which was not too sweet as requested.  All in all one of the best experiences I've had in recent memory.  Loved Ibrahim and his infectious friendliness and incredible Palestinian hospitality.  Definitely planning on more visits!
2019-01-31,5,Food is amazing ! And the owner is taking care of you ! Every order is to perfection !The couscous is great ! And the Atropos amazing ! Home feeling with great food
2019-01-26,5,Great food and an authentic middle eastern dining experience. The falafel is to die for. Totally recommend this place and will be back soon.
2019-01-22,5,I've been going to Ali Baba since they opened their doors. Having grown up in the neighborhood they became like family to me.  I have traveled extensively and eaten middle eastern cuisine all over the world.  I have to say I crave theirs the most.  I am a vegetarian so lean toward falafel hummus baba ganoush etc.  The food is extremely fresh and flavorful and made with love and pride.  I highly recommend a visit here.
2019-01-19,1,Is there something in the water in Hoboken? This place is terrible. Small kitchen right next to the bathrooms. None of the food is freshly prepared. We walked in for lunch and it was just us. Our server didn't say an ENTIRE word to us outside of what we wanted to order. Also, she didn't take our plates away when we finished. Instead, she was busy in the back talking.
2019-01-16,5,I came here recently for dinner and it was amazing! I have a sesame and nut allergy and the owner/staff could not have been more attentive and accommodating. I love middle eastern food but I usually avoid it because of my allergies - now I have a new go to place I can trust! I had the kabobs and a salad and couldn't have been happier. The service, as i've said, was on point and the atmosphere is great for a casual date night.Needless to say I cannot wait to go back :)
2019-01-06,5,I have had delivery from here multiple times but tonight I dined in for the first time. The food was delicious and served quickly. The server was pleasant and helpful and the owner was very attentive, including reviewing menu options with a guest with food allergies. The portions were generous and lamb was delicious. Definitely will go back for both the food and the delightful people.
2019-01-06,5,This is a Hoboken institution and the best restaurant for a vegetarian. The vegetarian middle eastern platter is phenomenal and our favorite when bringing food to a party. The owner loves cooking his families recipes and it shows.
2019-01-03,5,Amazing experience.  Came in off the street because we smelled something amazing.  Had a wonderful time speaking with the owner Abraham and the food was outrageously tasty.  The place also makes there own cream soda and it is super tasty.  Will be making it a regular spot.
2018-12-27,5,The food is superb. Living near Paterson, NJ I have tried  a lot of middle eastern restaurants but nothing has compared to the food of Ali baba. We ordered fatoush, which was so refreshing. We also had chicken tandoori, kibby (must have) vegetarian grand combo, steak which was perfectly cooked. Every dish we had was so good. The service was great. The chef/ owner even made sure we were enjoying our food. I must say, this is a restaurant that i would definitely visit often.
2018-12-22,5,The customer service was out of this world! I felt really comfortable ! The cooked came and blessed us with different choices of rice and just good hospitality ! I love nice people ! It makes the experience much more. The food was great ! I will def be back for more . My hunger was def satisfied. It has a nice little date spot atmosphere plus it's BYOB. Love it!
2018-12-17,4,Ali Baba is always a lovely time.  They serve traditional middle eastern fare and is BYO.  Without fail, they bring our a little hummus plate to start while guests peruse the menu.  Come hungry because the food is delicious and the portions are large!  [I'm worried for this gem now that there's a similar restaurant that opened up nearby, but maybe that means Ali Baba will attract the overflow from said other restaurant also.] The only con as other reviewers have stated is they only serve bottled water (as the waitress claimed is the owner's policy).  I didn't think bottled water was legal, unless they gave it for free -- while I didn't explicitly see the bottled water charge on the bill, that doesn't necessarily mean it wasn't there.  It's old school here, and they still have the hand written bills, not a printed receipt from a POS system.
2018-12-17,5,Welcoming host, great food! Their Sahara chicken and lamb kabob was perfect! Get it with their Afghan rice (roasted almonds on basmati rice). Finished it off with a bakalava that has just the right amount of sweet to it.
2018-12-08,5,Excellent food and service. The outside may deceive you but head on in and you will not be disappointed. The beklava was amazing!!
2018-11-30,5,A Hoboken mainstay I feel many overlook, but should make a destination. The food is authentic and delicious with great portions for the price. Bring friends and try the sharing platters so you can taste lots of different delicious dishes. I stopped in the other day after clearing off my car from the snowstorm. I was worried about getting the floor wet, but they didn't mind at all even gave me a bowl of rice with some delicious stew to warm me up while I waited for my takeout. A perfect cozy choice for the cold winter months with warm food and even warmer hospitality.
2018-11-28,4,I ventured out to Hoboken to visit one of my besties and we decided to visit Ali Baba. Neither of us has been there before so we were eager to give it a try. This spot is BYOB too so that definitely didn't hurt. We walked in - no reservation needed - and treated ourselves to the vino we brought (thanks, Mel!). Our waitress brought out complimentary pita and dip. We wanted to try a few things so we settled on sharing the 40 Thieves Mix Grill (grilled chicken, lamb kabob, beef gyro, kufta, rice) which was a very decent amount of food and super flavorful. I am not a big lamb person, but I did like the way it was prepared here so I made the exception. We had a ton of leftovers which I can appreciate, too. I may have seen my friend sneak a little snacky from these later in the night lolThe overall ambiance was casual and I could see this being a good take out place. One weird thing that I wasn't expecting - we asked for water and just assumed they'd bring us glasses of it, but we instead were brought Poland Spring bottles which we were obviously charged for later on. If we had known they'd charge us for bottles of water, we would have just brought our own. May be something to keep in mind if you plan on coming here. Bring your own alcoholic beverages, but bring something to hydrate with too.
2018-11-24,5,Amazingly tasty and authentic food. Owner/chef came out to talk to us and ended up bringing us dessert on the house... it was so good!
2018-11-20,4,I've been meaning to try Ali Baba for a while now. The first time I tried to go, they were closed due to renovations. Now that they're reopen again, I finally got the chance to come in one Saturday evening. A friend and I went for dinner and we decided to share the 40 Thieves Mix Grill (combination of grilled chicken, lamb kabob, beef gyro & kufta kabob,  served with garlic lemon sauce, rice, hummus & baba ganoush). This was a lot of food (on top of the complimentary pita and hummus they serve you once you sit down). The menu said that it was good for two people but we definitely had enough to serve a third person. My favorite was the lamb and the beef, especially with the yogurt sauce (?) they give you. The chicken was okay - it wasn't dry but it was just too charred for my taste. The rice came with almonds (you can opt out of it) which I thought would be weird at first, but it actually ended up adding a nice texture to it.Tip - it's BYOB. I think this means water too because when we asked for a glass of water, they brought out some Poland Spring and then charged us for it. A little sneaky but not enough to keep me from coming back. Overall, I really enjoyed the meal.
2018-11-12,1,I had take out from hear and it was one of the worst food experiences ever, the food was incinerated and there was not much left, I have lived in the Middle East for over 10 years and eaten lots of good middle easter food this was not it, when I called to ask what was the deal I was basically told to F off, never been back
2018-11-10,5,Easily some of the best food in the area. My girlfriend and I shared the curry stew and moussaka which were great, and my friend got grilled chicken at was seasoned beautifully. All of the food was flavorful and perfectly cooked, not to mention the massive portions. The owner is also very friendly and proud of the family recipes he uses, which he should be.
2018-11-05,5,Best lamb kebab I've ever had. Very tender and a lot of food comes with the plate. They just did a renovation and the owner (or manager) was nice enough to talk with me and give me a complimentary hummus dish! I will definitely be going back whenever I'm in Hoboken.
2018-11-04,2,We had a great experience when we were here first. And now we were here for the second time and this place was exactly the opposite! Spinach pie seemed was heated in microwave and tasted burnt. We paid for it though. Falafel were burnt miniatures! I will tell you guys the difference was that first time we were served food cooked by owner and second time we had staff cooking. Owner was missing! Advice to owner - business should be taken seriously. Leaving your restaurants to staff resulted in a bad experience and we are not coming back.
2018-10-31,5,Delicious Mediterranean spot in Hoboken.  Warm Pita bread and authentic hummus brought out to you on the table is a great pre meal treat.  Save room for dinner though, really nice sized portions!!! Great food and a very friendly staff has turned me into a regular.
2018-10-19,5,Ibrahim, the owner is incredibly friendly and generous. He recently donated a platter of food for a party that I hosted to raise funds for a local non-profit that sends at-risk youth to college, called "New City Kids." All of the guests loved the food and plan to order from Ali Baba's in the future! Thank you, Ibrahim!
2018-10-17,5,I ordered the vegetable soup and was happily surprised at the fresh vegetables and tomato based stock which had a nice "kick" to it. Also ordered the hummus; it carried me back to Egypt. The owner takes great pride in his family's recipes and it's is reflected in their menu. Great food, solid value. A must eat in Hoboken.
2018-10-14,5,This restaurant is delicious! On top of the great food, the owner is so friendly and kind! My friend and I came here on a Friday night & were looking to try a bunch of items. He came to our table and described all the potential dishes and came up with something that we both loved!! I would highly recommend coming here & guarantee you'll enjoy the food & have excellent service!
2018-10-13,5,Really awesome restaurant. Very nice atmosphere with incredible food and an incredible wait staff. It's a family-run restaurant and the ambiance is definitely very warm and friendly. I had the Sahara chicken, which was delicious. My friends had the beef gyro platter - also really good. And the falafel was delicious too :-) its also BYO so that's always a plus. Always a great time when I come here! 10/10!
2018-09-21,5,Top 5 restaurant in Hoboken for me and I've been a resident a little over 3 years. The food is delicious, very affordable, portions are large, and it's BYO.Went with my GF the other night and we immediately were served warm pitas with fresh hummus, which is included with dinner in house. My GF got a falafel sandwich and I got the Chicken Tikka entrée with a side of falafel. Entire bill was $27. Waitress was very friendly and helpful. Owner stopped by our table and chatted with us for a while and gave us each a free Turkish coffee to try. All around great restaurant for Middle Eastern food and would definitely recommend.
2018-08-25,4,Visited with a buddy & ordered the kibbeh (hard to find), kafta and beef gyro. It tasted great, the server was the wife of the chef when we visited. It's got a great vibe, authentic flavor and the chef shared some Turkish coffee with us. Would come back anytime.
2018-08-20,5,Food was great, and the family who owns the place were wonderfully hospitable.
2018-08-16,5,This place is NOT an Indian restaraunt. It's a middle eastern place with recipes from the biblical land of Jerusalem. Do not expect chutneys or korma or heavy sauces in your entree.
2018-08-15,5,Just went in for lunch after the renovation. I wish I was home during the day so I could go for the lunch special. We were thinking just doing sandwiches falafel and tikka but opted for the rice platter. The rice with the raisins and cardamom is a really nice touch to go with their legendary kofta and chicken tikka. We've been living in hoboken for 16 years and I can honestly say Ali Babas is one of the main reasons we stay local.
2018-08-13,5,Out of this world! Exceeded my expectations. Definitely going to come back. The chicken was perfectly cooked! The falafel... best falafel. Lots of food and all very delicious. Amazing service and very sweet. Great value and great price. :)
2018-08-11,5,Best Middle Eastern food in Hoboken. Great and fast service, food made to order. Awesome sampler platter to share is a must-order. Recently redone interiors are clean, nice and inviting. BYOB. Definitely worth the visit!
2018-08-10,5,Another old Hoboken stand-by I've been coming to with my family for over 20 years. Over those 20+ years, it has never disappointed. My go-to is the 40 Thieves grill mix which used to be a mountain of food, but has gradually shrunk in portion size (which is okay, as it really was too much food). Even still, I'm doggie-bagging gyro strips and there is no shortage of accompanying pita bread and yellow rice. The head waitress and chef are the owners. They're not just punching a clock and collecting their tips, this is their life's work and it shows in their warmth and concern with customer satisfaction. This is a classic mom and pop operation. They have a personal interest in delivering the best service they can, and along with big portions of delicious Middle-Eastern food, this has earned our decades-long loyalty and will keep us returning for years to come. I know if another Middle-Eastern restaurant opened in Hoboken, it would be half the portions for twice the price, served by a 22-year old who can't wait to be done and go home. In other words, Ali Baba is a tough act to follow.   It's BYOB -- honestly, my ideal birthday dinner with my family is Ali Baba with a bottle of red and a six pack, so I leave stuffed and buzzed with a bag full of leftovers.
2018-08-08,5,I came over to Ali Baba for lunch today. I ordered the Kufta Kebab and a Yogurt drink (Dough). The food was amazing. The service was also great. Will definitely come back here more often.
2018-08-08,5,Great food friendly staff. I felt like i went to visit family! The cook was amazing and the owner made me feel like we have been friends for years. Will def be going back. Great flavor! Thank you!!!!
2018-08-05,5,Okay here it goes. You have to stop here if you're anywhere near Hoboken. This isn't your run of the mill kabob place. The owner mixes a fusion of flavors in each dish, some spicy some sweet. Makes his food with love, you can tell. When you order, go out on a limb. You won't regret it. Everything tastes fresh and the service is incredible.
2018-08-05,3,It's a small Mediterranean / vegetarian place. They brought hummus and pita before we ordered. I had vegetarian couscous. I like the variety of boiled vegetables, but the couscous just tasted so so. The portion is huge too. The service was a little slow.
2018-08-04,5,Love love love this place! Been here a few times and the food and service are always fantastic. It seems to be the same people working every time and they treat you like family. The last time we went, the owner/chef came out to talk with us and brought out dessert for us to try. Try the beef gyro, it's insane. And the chicken tikka! We also split the 40 thieves meal between two of us and it was a bit of everything- highly recommend!
2018-08-02,5,Or waitress was super friendly and sweet. I had the kufta, which was nicely grilled with some tasty vegetables. My girlfriend had the falafel sandwich which she loved. Her favorite in Hoboken so far
2018-08-01,5,I came across Ali Baba a few months ago. After recently going vegan there were few places that had dishes that cater to my lifestyle. Ali Baba has amazing food that is healthy and delicious. My favorite dish is the Vegetarian Grand combo which is a generous portion that feeds 2 to 3 people. The dish includes falafels, hummus, babaganoush, tabouleh and grape leaves. My family has also become hooked on the food. I ordered the Beef gyro platter for my family which is a generous portion of food and they absolutely love it. They loved the seasoning and flavors of the dish. I enjoy food and love to share it with those around me. I always reccommend Ali Baba because they have a great selection of food. The staff is always very friendly and welcoming whenever I go to pick up my food.
2018-07-24,5,This is my absolute go to and favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  My favorite menu item is the chicken tikka sandwich with yogurt sauce, but I have never ordered a dish I didn't like.  I probably get dinner or lunch from here once a week if not more.  The owner and staff are so friendly and nice, they are like a second family at this point.  All around this place is great and not to be missed.
2018-07-23,5,Finally they are back open after remodel. We just moved here and tried to eat here many times and tonight they were open. The staff was amazing and very helpful in helping us pick our food. The food was truly authentic Mediterranean we will definitely be back again !
2018-07-22,5,Great dinner spot for Mediterranean food in Hoboken! The wait staff was helpful and very cordial. We ordered the vegetarian platter and the non vegetarian grill platter. The food was very tasty. We were there till a little after 10 which is their closing time but we didn't feel rushed to leave the place. Will definitely be coming back! P.s: the honey cake was phenomenal!!
2018-07-21,5,Ali Baba is one of the best restaurants in Hoboken! Superb quality and cleanliness. I especially love the falafel sandwich, the hummus and the baba ganoush. Every time I'm in Hoboken I find myself stopping by for a sandwich. Friendly staff as well. Highly recommend!!!
2018-07-19,5,I usually ignore writing reviews. However, after eating at this place I just had to for the record. By far one of the best services I have received from a restaurant. The best part out of the entire positive experience was the food. Specifically the falafel, humus, and baba ganoush was absolutely delicious. I no longer need to search further. The chef definitely has a golden touch. This will be my new hotspot! Thank Ali Baba for an outstanding service and overall excellent food experience.
2018-06-16,5,Coming back from the city, I had a huge craving for authentic middle eastern food on my way home. I decided to do some quick research while I was sitting in traffic with my wife (she did the research). We came across Ali Baba Restaurant. Little did we know, this place is a staple for the Hoboken area for the last 36years and best known for their Falafel.  We decided to pop in and give it a try. Man was it amazing. We were quickly greeted by the sweetest waitress Jackie and then by the owner Abe himself. We honestly felt like we were regulars from the moment we sat down. The place had such an authentic and warm middle eastern feel. From experience, these places are hard to come by and if you do, often something like the food or something doesn't quite turn out. We placed our order for Falafel, Hummus and a mixed dish that consisted of chicken and beef skewers on a bed of rice with salad and a piece of Kufta. This was the most authentic, delicious middle eastern food I'd ever tried... hands down. My wife and I ate until we were about to explode. The portions were so generous we literally had to take the rest of our food home. We ate it all the next day and tasted as if we just picked it up! Definitely worth the experience and I would honestly recommend checking it out. Places like these are rare and few. Take advantage while they are still around. I know I will!
2018-06-09,5,Truely authentic food. Friendly staffs and the ambiance was great! We ordered mixed grilled kebab with baba ghanoush and humus. Also had lamb chops and kufta kebabs. Every bite was extraordinarily delicious. Loved Turkish coffee too.
2018-06-04,5,Absolutely delicious food! Theres nothing I wouldnt recommend, but personally love the fresh fried falafel with the hummus, and the shawarma sandwiches. The rice dishes are fantastic too, as is the salads, and desserts! Def check it out!
2018-06-02,5,Came here for dinner last night. We were immediately greeted with a warm welcome by the staff. We ordered the 40 Thieves Meal (for 2), which was absolutely delicious. Everything was full of flavor and the lamb was out of this world. We were so full by the end of dinner but still ordered the Kanafeh for dessert and we were glad we did so. It was amazing. The owner/chef came out to make sure we were satisfied with our meal, and seemed to like to know all of his customers on a personal level, which is nice. The waiter and waitress were extremely accommodating and the service was excellent. Great restaurant, great staff, we will definitely be back.
2018-06-02,5,This place is awesome. The food was amazing and well worth the prices. The staff is very welcoming and make sure that you are satisfied with what you are eating. The owner/chef is very passionate about the food and can tell that he is proud to serve the food he does. Will be back for sure!
2018-05-27,2,Ordered delivery on a Friday evening. Spinach pie and the vegetarian grand platter. Food arrived a bit over an hour after we ordered. The pita came in the manufacturer's bag, like someone swung by stop-and-shop last-minute to pick them up. The falafel was cold and soggy. The spinach pie was soggy. I did like the grape leaves a lot. This was not the experience I was hoping for.
2018-05-16,4,Great lunch/dinner spot in uptown Hoboken. This establishment is ran by the owner who is the chef himself! I came here on a weekday for lunch and parking was easy and the restaurant was not packed. Our server was really nice and welcoming. We ordered Speeha pie and spinach pie. The Speeha was a bit dry but the spinach pie was great. Warm and fluffy. We all ordered Gyros. Beef, Lamb Kebab, Spicy Chicken Tikka and Falafel. The Falafel was super moist and not too oily has hummus inside too YUM! The spicy chicken tikka one had fresh cucumbers, tomatoes and tzatiki. This one has their hot sauce (red pepper oil) in it which made it a bit too hot for my taste. The Lamb and Beef ones were pretty good as well!The only disappointment was that after we ordered we heard there were lunch specials and this was not mentioned to us. They included sandwiches which is what we ordered, so I think they should have said something. But nevertheless, I will be back.
2018-04-19,5,Came here with friends on a Tuesday night and had a wonderful dinner! We were immediately greeted with warmth and a smile and seated at a nice big table by the window. The service was great from start to finish. We were surprised to find we were the only customers as I've been before and loved the food. This night was no different. The food was fresh and came out quick and hot. The lovely man serving us gave us complimentary hummus to share and was attentive to our every request. I personally think they also have the most flavorful falafel in Hoboken as well! I look forward to frequenting this restaurant for the warm family feel and tasty food!
2018-04-17,5,One of the best Mediterranean food in town. Great staff and pleasant environment. The owner is really friendly and truly wants you to enjoy the food and your time. Overall great food, definitely recommend it.
2018-04-13,2,If you're thinking about getting indian food from here, don't. I got the chicken tandoori and falafal delivered. I was so exited untill I opened my boxes and It looked like they were from a cheap halal cart in times square, tasted like it too. My favorite food tandoori chicken was just spicy chicken that didnt even have tandoor sauce aka the only thing that makes chicken tandoori CHICKEN TANDOORI. To top it off it was over plian yellow rice. I know this doesnt sound like a big deal but indian food = yellow rice?? no corrilation. Falafel was okay and the pita was literally premade and came in its bag.
2018-04-09,5,With my new friend Ibrahim, owner and chef of Ali Baba Restaurant on Washington St in Hoboken. Best Falafel I've eaten in the USA. Really!! And I've had a lot of falafel from LA to JerusalGreat food. Warm service. Nice people. I highly recommend it.
2018-03-17,5,This place is amazing - eating in or out. The staff is also incredible and it's super quick. Bring wine! The portions are large and it's fairly inexpensive. Make sure to get the baklava at the end.
2018-02-24,5,Ali Baba is a cornerstone of Hoboken, being one of the oldest restaurants in the city! I've been coming here for years and the food is always exceptional. I personally love the gyro and chicken kebab. The hummus, falafel, and tabbouleh are also amazing if you're looking for appetizers to try.Chef/Owner is always courteous and tries to stop by to ask how our meal is. This is one of the few places that doesn't have a commercialized feel to it, you feel like your going to the house of the Middle Eastern uncle you never had. He cooks you up a delicious meal, you exchange a few pleasantries, and you go home to take a nap, because of how much you ate! All in all, if you're looking for authentic Middle Eastern food, check out Ali Baba for a warm ambience, excellent customer service, and delicious food. Highly recommend! Bonus: they were recently voted the Best Middle Eastern/Turkish food in North Jersey by NewJersey.com! Well deserved!
2018-02-10,4,My friend and I came here for dinner. Overall, food and service was pretty good. Waiter was very nice. Inside was small and cozy. To start, I liked that they came out with with pita (vs cold). I was surprised they served it with butter. Most Middle Eastern restaurants that I've been to serve it with yogurt sauce or tahini. We ordered the 40 Thieves platter for 2, which was just enough for us. Our entree came with baba ganouj and hummus appetizer. Baba ganouj was very good as it had a very smoky flavor, which I love. Hummus was decent. They were nice enough to fulfill our request of substituting chicken cubes and beef gyro with additional lamb kabob and kofta. However, when the meal came out I was a bit disappointed that they didn't really add much (3 kofta total) and the lamb cubes were small. Nonetheless, they were both flavorful and not overcooked. It also came with a plate of yellow rice. I was told they do not have bulgur wheat (surprisingly for a middle eastern restaurant), but could charge me $2 for couscous. It also came with a small portion of salad.Pretty good price $28 for the meal :)
2018-01-28,3,Been here several times before. Came here after a break of 6months and ordered their vegetarian grand platter as always. However, today the falafel did not taste the same + smaller in size and the overall portion size has reduced too.
2018-01-13,4,Great owner! An open invitation to Mediterranean family eating. The owner took great care of us, making us feel like family. The food was all pretty tasty, not spectacular, but solid in flavors!
2018-01-06,4,Reliable take out place.  Which they will make their own pita bread.  The hummus is always good.
2017-11-26,5,Best food in Hoboken!  Authentic healthy mideastern food at a great price.  Fast delivery as well.  Love the 40thieves grill platter!
2017-11-19,4,Great service and a warm cozy feeling to the place. Ordered a fatoush and a vegetarian platter. Food was delicious! I would definitely come again.
2017-11-06,5,So yummy and so economical!!! Steven and I were in Hoboken for Davy Knowles at Maxwell's Tavern and needed dinner before. We decided on Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food and boy was it good. When we arrived, we were the only people and the waitress was thrilled. When we left we were one of three parties. Not sure why, other than it was a Wednesday, because it's such a neighborhood gem! The food was so yummy, fresh, and flavorful... It's a great spot for anyone in Hoboken :)
2017-10-27,2,I was kind of disappointed with food. Drove one hour to get here and then parking. On top of that the food was not good at all. Service is ok. I probably would not come here.
2017-10-19,5,Fresh and fast! Great service and authentic atmosphere. The falafels are great!
2017-10-18,5,Wonderful place! The owner and staff are very friendly and most importantly, the food was absolutely delicious! I got the kufta kebob and the portion was very generous. Will definitely order again!
2017-09-02,5,Shared the 40 Thieves plate (which is meant for 2 people) and thought it was a huge portion of food for a great price. My favorite was the humus and baba ganoush! Great service, will definitely come back.
2017-07-26,5,awesome food, especially the stew lamb. 40mixed grilled is enough for two young man, really satisfied
2017-07-02,3,The food was so so. We took the mixed grill. The meat was just not tasty, I don't know if it's the seasoning or something else, but it was salty and somewhat dry, the beef portions didn't have much flavor. The chicken was decent.The delivery was super fast.
2017-06-27,4,I love their babaganoush here! They give you so much and I find that I just eat it without any pita. Speaking of pita-- they give you a WHOLE PACKAGE so you end up having a leftover too! The Greek salad is a good size and they give you a good piece of feta as well.
2017-06-04,3,Tried the 40 thieves, tabouli, hummus, baba ghanoush and mediterranean salad. All were ok... The chicken wasn't fully cooked and I preferred the gyro and lamb. The service was slow in a not busy restaurant and waiter seemed confused with our order. The mint lemonade was just mixed sugar and water :(
2017-06-02,4,Ambience and decor is good.Food when compared to other places is Ok but I have had better food. We tried the chicken tandoori with rice.The price is on the expensive side but okayish for the place.The dessert especially the small baklavas they have are excellent. They are small so you can have less without having to buy more.The owners are very friendly and amicable.
2017-04-30,5,Great for a vegetarian. Falafel has a great bite from jalapeño. Veggie soup is a gift - chock full of butternut squash and carrots and the most sweet, flavorful broth. Grape leaves were nicely spiced. As a vegetarian, I rarely feel indulged - this was absolutely an indulging meal!
2017-03-12,3,Nice ambience, good service. About average food - the chicken tikka sandwich was fresh and reminiscent of a souvlaki. The falafel sandwich was about average. The spinach pie is nice and worth a shot (fresh baked bread stuffed with spinach, lime and spices) and the mint lemonade was refreshing.
2017-02-25,4,My husband and I always pass this restaurant so on a rainy night we decided to give it a shot and get delivery --- and I am glad we did We ordered: Spinach pie appetizerHummus appetizer Chicken tikka platterGyro sandwich My absolute favorite item: the hummus.  Incredible and hands down best I've had in a long time and for sure best in Hoboken.  Outstanding. My absolute not so much favorite: spinach pie appetizer.  I was expecting a true Greek spinach pie but maybe this was a different version of it? We got basically a pita with spinach stuck inside....The chicken tikka and the gyro were very good as well.  The restaurant gives you extra yogurt sauce which is always appreciated :)Good food overall
2017-02-19,5,My boyfriend and I came to Ali Babas last night in search of something different to our usual Italian places of choice. Being originally from England, where middle eastern food is not only extremely popular, but as authentic as you can get (unless you're in the actual country eating it!) I had pretty high expectations. Safe to say this place was outstanding. The food was delicious, fresh and full of the amazing middle eastern flavours you'd expect. The value for money was excellent, especially for Hoboken. We sampled a few of the specialities and enjoyed every single one. The stuffed grape leaves were second to none. The place is also BYO which is another huge plus if you're looking for a cheaper way to dine out. Our server, Miguel, made our experience unforgettable, he was so attentive and we loved talking to him, he was a natural. I will definitely be back to Ali Baba, it's one of the best meals I've had in Hoboken!
2017-02-19,5,Came in on a Saturday night, not too busy and got seated immediately. Right away the wait staff welcomes you and makes you feel right at home! The food is amazing, all made fresh from the chef's home and brought to the kitchen. Our server, Miguel, was awesome. The prices are some of the best around in Hoboken. Will definitely be returning!
2017-02-05,3,We ordered take out from this place last night and the food was overall good. Hummus and soups were really good. The falafel balls seemed OK. Salads and grape leaves were also good. One thing they could do is serve Pita warm as oppose to giving them straight out of refrigerator!!
2017-01-24,5,We ordered two chicken tikka sandwiches and drinks and took the food to the waterfront and had a nice time. The online ordering system was super easy and the food was ready when we arrived. In the past, I have sat in the restaurant for dinners and found it to be an enjoyable experience. The workers are very nice and helpful. The food tastes fresh and is delicious!
2017-01-19,1,Arrived 15 minutes before closing. They told us kitchen was closed while the food was still coming out!! Rude!! Left the place. Only went because I was hungry
2016-12-27,5,This place is both yummy AND economical!  Hubby and I stopped in for a quick dinner, and ordered the 40 Thieves Mixed Grill platter.  For $28 it came with a great variety of meats (chicken, kabob, lamb, etc), side of hummus and baba ganoush, wane pita and plate of yellow rice!!!!  We were blown away by the quality of the meats, the quantity and the price (esp on Washington St in Hoboken!!)For appetizers, we ordered the falafel and those were awesome!  I normally don't like falafel because 9 times out of 10, they are usually dry and flavorless. I took one off my hubby's plate, and I was extremely surprised and blown away by the amount of flavor that was packed in one little falafel!!!  The falafel was very crispy on the outside well tender on the inside. The seasoning was delicious and it packed a little kick at the end, most likely from a hot or smoked paprika.Our waitress was extremely friendly, and when she came to check on us I told her how much we love the falafel and she said that the owner makes the falafel mix from scratch himself and his his own original recipe. And it shows!Now that we are moving to this area, we will certainly be back to this little gem again and again.
2016-11-20,5,Great middle eastern place to eat in or takeout. Order from there often - good food, reliable and on time, and friendly service. The owner is often there too and is always welcoming and accommodating for any food requests. Highly  recommended
2016-10-29,5,Great place. My wife and I went here for the first time and we are hooked. The grilled chicken sandwich with the cucumber sauce and the hummus are great.
2016-10-29,5,Excellent food and service. We liked the falafel kebab and chicken tandoori hummus grape leaves.  Definitely will come back again
2016-10-27,1,Sadly I can't even rate the food. I placed an order at 7:50 with estimated delivery at 8:35, at 8:53 I got an update that they are running behind and it will arrive in about 1 hour. The point of ordering out was so it's quick since I came home late and hungry not in  he mood to cook. I ended up ordering from another place and food already arrived as I am still waiting for Ali Baba. Maybe in person I will stop by if food will end up being good but delivery is beyond bad.
2016-09-01,1,Something happened to this place since we first came in back in February, back when the food was good.  On our recent visit our meals were fairly tasteless and the 'mint lemonade' clearly from a Chrystal Lite type powder with a sprig of mint thrown in.  I think it must have changed owners and the new people are less Middle Eastern and more Eastern European.
2016-07-08,5,I love this place. They're food is fresh, clearly homemade, reasonably priced, and DELICIOUS!
2016-07-03,5,It's great getting some of the best meze plates in Hoboken from some of the nicest people in Hoboken. The food is delicious and Ibrahim, the owner, was so thoughtful when it came to the care of me and my guests, it reminded me of a time I thought long gone when business owners themselves took pride in what they did, and made sure that you were looked after. My new best favorite!
2016-06-26,3,My parents are vegetarian, so I took my family here when they came to town. We ordered the fresh vegetable soup for appetizer, and split the vegetarian grand combo and couscous.First off, the decor felt like we stepped into a corner restaurant in Marrakesh rather than Hoboken. The walls are covered with Arabic and Islamic motifs, with hookahs and a sitar looking instrument propped up on shelves. Even on a late Friday night, the place was not too crowded - just the right amount of empty.The meal started with a plate of hummus and pita on the house. The pita was soft and warm, while the hummus was a creamy complement. The hummus comes pretty bland, but they provide chili oil so everybody can set their own spice level.The soup came next, and it sadly left a lot to be desired. The soup itself clearly came from a can, while the vegetables were massive chunks that didn't taste like they were seasoned at all. We didn't end up finishing it.With the main course, it was 50/50 win. The couscous was bland. My father, who is used to eating couscous adorned with many vegetables and spices, was disappointed with the simplicity of this dish. The vegetarian combo was a bunch of dips, falafel balls, and grilled vegetables. The falafel balls were probably my favorite part of the meal, crunchy on the outside and fluffy edamame inside.As other reviewers have remarked, the owner is a very warm man that seems to be actively involved in his restaurant for many years. Even though he was fasting for Ramadan, he spent the entire day in the heat of the kitchen, and still somehow had the energy to converse at length with the patrons.All in all, Ali Baba is a warm and welcoming place that I would recommend as a place for a couple of old friends to catch up over a meal. I wish I could rate this one higher, but in the end it comes down to the quality of the food, and the dishes we had just weren't up there.Ambience: 5/5Price: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Food: 2.5/5
2016-05-30,5,Fantastic Middle Eastern cuisine in the heart of Hoboken. Delicious authentic hummus, tebouleh, falafel, gyros, stuffed grape leaves and so much more served with fresh vegetables and flavorful sauces. The owner is a kind, friendly gentleman who takes great pride in his cooking. The servers are absolutely delightful. We can't wait to return to sample more of their authentic delicacies.
2016-05-23,5,Ali Baba's friendly and warm service makes you feel at home! I am picky when it comes to Middle Eastern food coming from a Lebanese background, but this restaurant hits all the marks for their vegetarian platter! The hummus and baba ganoush were very good. The falafel were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The proportions were large and good for sharing.I was shocked at the end of the meal when the owner sent out delicious desserts, among which were gribee cookies! I look forward to returning to try more on the menu.(Also it is BYOB!)
2016-05-14,5,Jackie and Abraham are such genuine and welcoming people, I feel better even before I order. The shrimp with couscous special was so flavorful, with a roasty grilled char in the shrimp and subtle herbs and vegetables in the broth it came in. The hearty portion of perfectly made couscous made this almkst more than I could eat--almost ; ).
2016-05-07,5,Delicious. Friendly atmosphere. The chef is funny and creates a great experience. Our family has been coming here for years and it's a Hoboken main stay. For fresh, authentic middle eastern food this if your place. And it's BYOB!
2016-05-07,1,Awful.  The whole restaurant was smoky with a burning oil smell.  The lamb curry "stew" was more like a soup; everything was in a brown broth not a sauce.  Corn in lamb curry?  Disgusting.  Could not taste any curry, it had no flavor. When we got home our clothes smelled like burnt oil.  NEVER AGAIN.  DO NOT GO.
2016-04-30,5,I've been looking for a restaurant like this for a while. The food is phenomenal and the service is great. Recommend the falafel, baba ganoush, lamb kabob, and fried kibby. The music enhanced the experience and made it a great place to enjoy some food and have a great conversation. Will be going there regularly.
2016-04-28,5,Great service and food it's been around since 1983 so that counts for something. It's a local town favorite and offers healthy varieties. I recommend it to everyone. Same owner/chef it's been in the same family since it opened. Chef uses all special and fresh ingredients from the Middle East try the Turkish coffee and the grill mix for two. Appetizers are divine from hummus to tabouleh and yummy eggplant dip. Im a regular here and this is one of the few places I trust to get consistency.
2016-04-20,1,Disgusting.  Everything heated up in the microwave.  Meat tastes like rubber- foul smelling.  Over seasoned.  The cook put her finger in the rice to check the temperature... Yes without gloves!!!!!  Definitely not Turkish.  Not fresh food.  Horrible flavor.  The whole place smells musty.  We ordered all this food and could not even eat it- leaving hungry and disappointed.  And still paid for our drinks. Do not go here!!!
2016-04-11,5,First time, spur of the moment dinner and was so lucky we decided on this place. Abraham and Jacky were so nice and the lamb kebabs were delicious! They even offered us a complimentary coffee and mint tea after dinner- felt like we were visiting family and, like home, we'll be visiting often.
2016-04-04,5,The Falafel and Grill Mix were AWESOME!! It was just enough to feed two people...  Most importantly, the service was one of a kind!! The staff were extremely attentive and warm which made the dining experience that much more "homey" like you were part of the family.  Hands down, our most favorite restaurant to go to in the area!!!
2016-04-04,5,Hands down or favorite place to eat in Hoboken.With my wife being of middle eastern decent we've looked far and wide to find places that are doing middle eastern cuisine right and Ali Baba is such a place.Weather we were eating in or ordering out the food and service was always nothing less then top notch.
2016-04-03,3,I really wanted to love this place, as it continues to be surprisingly difficult to find good mediterranean food in Hoboken.  The people who work here are incredibly attentive and sweet, you feel like a guest in their home.  The decor could probably use an update, but I take it that they have a large take-out/delivery following.   As far as the food goes, the highlight of the the meal was definitely the chicken --- the Sahara chicken was juicy and deliciously seasoned.  Otherwise, the other items we ordered were rather bland: the salad, the rice, and the humus.  It was reasonably priced, so the meal wasn't overly disappointing.
2016-03-30,5,Amazing food, hospitality, and service. Abraham, the owner, was more than hospitable, it felt like he welcoming us into his home for a family meal. The baba ganoush is the best I've ever had. The meats are prime cut and so flavorful. The 40 thieves grill is more than enough for 2 people and an excellent choice if you want to taste a little bit of everything. Overall a great experience.
2016-03-25,5,This small Middle Eastern restaurant can pack a punch! Amazing grilled chicken platter with rice, salad and pita bread. The staff (maybe the owner and his wife?) were very hospitable and have great energy. Great atmosphere. Fun upbeat music. Very tasty. I will be back!
2016-03-23,5,Everything is fresh and homemade and you can tell! Best Tzatziki sauce I've ever had. The homemade yogurt made all the difference. We even brought some home with us. We started with hummus, which was creamy and perfect. We both commented on how delicious the olive oil on top was. Then, I got the lamb kabobs and my boyfriend got the beef gyro. Both came with a greek salad we loved. We shared a piece of baklava at the end (don't miss this!!) Both of us left completely satisfied and wanting more. Things we'll try next time: falafel, baba ganoush and house made rootbeer!Definitely will be going back and highly recommend.
2016-03-23,5,Great chef and waitress. So friendly. The interior is very mideterrean like. We had tubouli, hummus and lamb.
2016-03-20,5,My fiancé and I seriously love Mediterranean food and found this place randomly on a Friday night. We split a Gyro sandwich, with hot sauce and Tzatziki sauce, and a vegetarian platter. It was awesome. We split a Turkish coffee too, which was my first and won't be my last. The atmosphere was good; we were the only ones in there at first but a few tables trickled in eventually. I think we were just really early for a crowd (there around 6ish). It was reasonably priced, delicious and the services was great!!
2016-02-18,5,My fiance and I came here on a Friday night and loved it. The staff/owner were so pleasant and the food was fantastic! Can't wait to go back.
2016-01-09,4,I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and it was delicious! I came here with 8 people and we were seated comfortably, it wasn't too tight for a small restaurant. They had authentic Mediterranean music playing throughout the night and it gives it a very relaxing vibe. Pros: Food was delicious. Portions of food was large. One entree Can realistically can feed 2 people. We ordered the 40 Theives for 2 and it could feed about three people. Others ordered the Chicken Tikka entree and it was good! The owner even came over to make sure the service and food was good tooCons: Once you sit down you are served with pita bread with butter... Not hummus which Isn't fun. 40 Theives for two only comes with one rice bowl.
2015-12-19,4,We had a take out dinner, it was 40 thieves mixed grilled for 2 and moussaka. the food was delicious! The meat was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. moussaka was great. Food was accompanied with plenty of salad /w feta. Only down point was the rice. But its very hard to satisfy a south asian with a rice item.
2015-12-11,5,Just had dinner here tonight and the food was authentic and amazing! Service was outstanding. Also, it's BYOB which makes for a great atmosphere.
2015-11-28,1,Got here at 11:45 AM on a Saturday with my whole family. Website said they open at 11 am and their front door was wide open with no closed sign or anything. The second I walk in the lady starts yelling at me that they're closed because the cook isn't there. Thanks.
2015-11-20,5,1. Delivery guy was as nice as they come 2. The lamb stew is delicious. 3. The portion is huge with plenty of lamb 4. Both the bread and the salad that the meal comes with are fresh and taste great. I'm just sorry it took me so long to order from here but I'm Middle Eastern so I'm very picky when it comes to "home" food but I'm very satisfied!
2015-11-16,5,Have been eating at Ali Babas since I was a little kid and it's always been one of my favorites! Great food and super affordable. The falafel are my go-to.
2015-11-11,4,Came here on a Monday night in search of good Mediterranean/Middle-Eastern food. The Greek salad is fresh and delicious. I really enjoyed the kafta kabobs. Saffron rice is flavored well, too. They give you plenty of pitas with what you order and there was enough food for me to take my vegetables home. Portions are generous and the food is always fresh. I'll be coming back here, particularly since the people who run it are conscientious and committed to delivering high-quality food.
2015-10-29,4,Great flavored food, service is nice, but make sure you come early because otherwise ....... Anyways food was delish & it's BYOB.
2015-10-21,5,Best middle eastern restaurant in hoboken no doubt about that. Owner is such a nice guy very kind and such a great chef. We love the tabbouleh there always fresh and yummy also his falafel is the best in town, he does it the right way . Authentic, fresh and delicious go try !
2015-10-21,5,I was glad to finally walk into this place after living in Hoboken for so many years.  They had a few dishes I like and you can't find them much in Hoboken. I guess what really pushed this place over the top for me was the friendly owner and staff.
2015-10-11,1,We came in here today and we've been customers for 21 years today was the first time that we got crappy service and  overcharge I want to say the main reason for this was because the owner was not there. We went into the restaurant and the big lady was there. She had a nasty look on her face as always. The workers on the kitchen were very slow with getting our food. The one young man, I want to say he was the owners son was dressed in jeans and a third shirt was chilling and drinking beer when an untrained waiter was taking our order. Going back to the food, everyone we went there we order falafel sandwiches and the pita bread comes warm. Today they were cold  when we called the waiter and waitress over they started to argue with us saying they ate always served cold.  She finally offered to heat up the sandwiches as she was walking towards the kitchen made a smart remark to the other waiter. Also she was giving attitude and rolling her eyes at the kitchen staff. Another thing about the food was that as an appetizer they give warm pita breads on the side with butter and hot sauce. Today they have it to everyone else but our table.  When we asked for it she added a hummus appetizer to our bill. The service was very bad today and if the owner was there none of these things would be tolerated.  Lastly when the waiter came to give us ur bill he added an extra dollar to our bill. The hummus appetizer was 7 dollars on the menu but he wrote 8 dollars. This was the first time in 21 years I have seen this type of service. I can't wait to see the owner and tell him about my experience because he knows me personally.
2015-10-07,4,Delish!!!!!!!  Hummus was yummy, meat was tender. Lots of pita and yogurt dip  :)
2015-09-14,5,Stumbled in on a random Monday night and am super happy we did because it was delicious.The meat is well seasoned and delicious. The hummus and baba and yogurt were all AMAZING!And another plus is Jacky the server... She is just wonderful and the Chef was very sweet as well. We felt right at home in this restaurant, and you gotta love that!Wonderful place! We will be back!
2015-09-13,5,Amazing food, great price and lunch the next day! 40 thieves mixed grilled for 2 was delicious! We'll be back!
2015-09-04,5,I don't remember his name, but the service was outstanding. Food was delicious too and we didn't have to wait long after we placed our order. I will definitely go back and recommend to my friends.
2015-09-01,1,Confused, Tasteless, and BlandIm normally a fan of Mediterranean food. But this is the most tasteless bland food ever. It bills itself as Arab in its decor and theme. However menu has indian food and its arab food is served with tzaziki sauce which is greek. The chicken is barely seasoned. Borders on tasting like hospital food. It is overpriced slightly but all in all its totally confused and ends up coming out terrible. Its neither arab, nor indian, not greek. A good point however is service. The proprietors are really friendly and attentive
2015-08-31,5,This is the tastiest and most authentic food in Hoboken! It's perfect in all aspects- flavor, quantity, ambience, and price. And I have to mention the staff..they're the sweetest and friendliest people I've met in a restaurant! They make you feel like you're part of the family. If this restaurant were located somewhere in midtown Hoboken, it would be packed 24x7. But I'm not complaining!
2015-08-20,5,We were walking and ran into Ali Baba and decided to give it a try. The minute we walked in we felt like home. The super-friendly owner greeted us and quickly arranged a table to accommodate all 12 of us. We ordered several different plates so we could try out a variety of food and EVERY SINGLE PLATE was spectacular. Such great food, reminding us all of home. We were also in luck because the owner had just made a signature "basboosa" with peaches that had only come out of the oven minutes before we entered. It tasted like a bit of heaven.Will happily go back!Try the Arab Spring dish - you will not regret it!
2015-08-09,1,I called, they answered, they hung up after making me wait, pretty rude, was not happy want to try it though
2015-08-04,5,Lovely ambience, friendly staff and Amazing food!! My husband went "ummmmmm" over his Sahara Chicken!!
2015-07-31,2,Really wanted to like this food. Recently moved here from Abu Dhabi and have been craving good middle eastern food. This doesn't even come close. Meat was dry, rice tasted strange, tabouleh tasted nothing like it should (so bland and very little parsley) and the hummus was bland as well. Definitely wouldn't eat this again! Hopefully mahmoun falafel is better. 2 stars is given only because the owner is really nice.
2015-07-25,4,Great food. Big portions. Love the background music. Fast service. The owner is very nice and sociable.  We came here on a whim on a Saturday and we were very pleased. We left feeling satisfied and full.
2015-07-07,5,Don't let he quiet nature of this place deceive you, they are pretty busy with takeout orders due to the awesomeness of  their  food.  We ordered the Vegetarian Plate along with some chicken tandoori and were treated to a mouthwatering barrage of flavor.   I went to school in town and get back often and will certainly make this a regular stop.  One of or truly favorite Mediterranean places at a very reasonable price.
2015-07-02,5,Awesome moussaka. Always fresh, comes with plenty of pita and a delicious side salad. Feels like grandmother's cooking if your granny was Turkish and spent her whole life lovingly cooking for little brats like you.They also make their own root beer inhouse.
2015-05-30,5,Been going to this place since I was a kid. Chicken kababs are the same. Felt good to be home after a long time. Still frying up falafels on a basic stove from the 80's, love it! Owners are the same and awesome people all around. If u r in the mood for a mom/pop experience in middle eastern food, I def recommend you check them out. It's all about the food here!
2015-05-27,4,Love this place! We were the only couple in the restaurant ( guess everyone was at the shore) but I must say it was a beautiful experience.  The food was hot, food digested well and taste great. The owner came out and had a chat with us after our meal.  Truly felt like family. The desert and Turkish coffee was amazing. Do yourself a favor ask the server for recommendations before ordering. They are expanding the menu and I was pleased with the one of the new dishes they have on the horizon.
2015-05-09,5,Awesome middle eastern food at great prices. Plenty of room to sit, great customer service, clean environment. I eat here at least once a week. Great variety too, I can come and get a quick $7 sandwich, or get a more elaborate platter for under $20. Desserts are awesome too. I almost always have food to take home too!
2015-04-25,5,Tripped upon this place with my son. Food and service were great. Their lamb and gyro meat were delish.
2015-04-09,5,I've been coming to this restaurant since I was a kid.I haven't been disappointed at all.Everything here is GOOD.From the lamb,tabooly and the hummus especially.They have the best hummus that I have ever tasted.For people to put the hummus in this place down are the one's who don't know what hummus is!!! If you want untraditional hummus that lacks taste go to mamoun's.The service has always been great.So if you want traditional middle eastern food at its best,I suggest you come to Ali Baba.
2015-03-30,1,The worst restaurant I ever went to! The lady at the counter (i don't know if she is the owner, waitress, or the hostess) was so rude. When I confronted her about her attitude, she told me she was mad at the cook. REALLY LADY??!!! You have internal issues and you treat your paying customers like garbage?? We got hummus (which was lacking any type of flavor) and left, I'm a big Middle Eastern food fan....I'll stick to Maumouns down the street which has awesome service and great food! Not surprised this place was empty on a very busy Sunday afternoon.
2015-03-26,5,I just went this afternoon and it was delishous. I've never really had this type of food before. I got the lunch special which consisted of a choice of meat (I got gyro meat) a small salad and a choice of rice. It was prepared quickly and had excellent flavor overall. The atmosphere was interesting with all assortments of decorations lining the walls. I would definitely go again.
2015-03-22,5,Still as satisfying as when I first visited them in 2012. Hospitable service, BYOB, tasty and still a nice change from the typical area's fare. Wish they delivered to me!
2015-03-22,5,I recently Are used Ali Baba for a lunch  catering order (pick up not delivery) The service was incredible as they were able to help me craft a menu for seven people and have it prepared for 11:30 AM. They helped me set the menu up the night before and called me in the morning at 11:15 to let me know it would be ready in just a few minutes. They also followed up after to make sure everything was to my liking. thanks so much!Service = 5 starWe ordered salmon with grilled vegetables, chicken kebabs, shrimp and rice a Greek salad. We also I had couscous, rice,  yogurt dipping sauce and a red pepper spicy sauce for the chicken.. And tons of pita! My customers were very impressed with both the taste and the selection of food as it was all flavorful and healthy! Food= 5 star I would certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Mediterranean-style/ middle eastern food and will order again!
2015-03-08,4,Authentic Turkish cuisine! Had the kafka platter and the mussaka. Huge portions, great for sharing. Homemade dessert and Turkish coffee to finish the meal. Will definitely come back.
2015-02-14,5,Ali Ba Ba is a fantastic secret Hoboken spot. The chef/owner makes traditional dishes that bring culture to Washington street. The tikka masala platter is a "not to be missed" dish for anyone who loves spicy food. The moussaka is flavorful and delicious. I highly suggest that you do not miss the Honey Cake for dessert. This family owned restaurant has a whole lot of heart and spirit in Hoboken, and you will walk away feeling satisfied with the middle eastern cuisine.
2015-02-13,5,Went there tonight, not very crowded. The service was very quick and the food was absolutely delicious. The prices were reasonable and the portions were large. There is enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. What I found to be really great was the chef (who may also be the owner, I'm not really sure) came out after our meal and asked us about it. He invited us to come back and I cannot wait to do so. They seem to treat all their customers like family. What tops it off...it's a BYOB!
2015-01-22,5,Yummy.I had the yogurt cucumber salad and the shawarma platter.The portions are generous and the price is reasonable for the quantity.Everything was well prepared and when I asked if they had Ayran (yogurt drink) they said no but they could make it and it was great.Staff was friendly food was good definitely recommend the place.
2015-01-20,3,Walked by and decided to stop in on a Monday night. The place was virtually empty so we had very attentive service. The menu was very expansive with quite a few unique dishes. Unfortunately, I wasn't feeling too adventurous that night so I just ended up ordering a lamb kabob sandwich with cucumber yogurt sauce and shared a side of falafel, which comes with tahini sauce. Lamb Kabob Sandwich ($9.50): From what the waitress told me, the only difference between the sandwich and the open face sandwich is that the latter comes with more meat. The lamb was cooked very well and was very tender, the pita bread was warm and fluffy. My only qualm is that it came with red bell peppers, which I'm not a fan of and was not listed on the ingredients list. I also requested a side of hot sauce, which was more of a spicy chili oil. While I personally love spicy chili oil, it didn't taste like it was something normally paired with this type of cuisine. Falafel Side Order ($4): Comes with 6 small falafel balls. They were perfectly fried and had a subtle crunch. On point, though I imagine its not too difficult to mess up falafel. My friend had ordered the vegetable skewer ($11.50), which ended up being a plate of grilled and sauteed vegetables drowned in BBQ sauce. She said it definitely didn't go well with what she expected to be a light, healthy dish. My knowledge of Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food doesn't go far past the standard falafel, hummus, and Mamouns, but I would say Ali Baba did not seem to be the most authentic place. Overall, its probably just an okay place to stop at, primarily because of all the options they have to offer.
2015-01-15,5,I have been eating at Ali Baba's for over 15 years.  The portions are abundant; the choices varied; the staff super-friendly and attentive; and the tastes and flavors excellent representations of the cuisine.  For me, Ibby's chicken soup is an elixir of good health.  After running the NYC marathon, the first thing I requested was two orders of the soup to help with my recovery.  It is just fabulous!
2015-01-09,5,Great food. Very reasonable prices. Very humble owner/staff. My girlfriend and I were here yesterday had lamb chops and lamb kabob with rice and salad and humus and cuscus and pita and yogurt. I think that was everything and for dessert we had baklava and tea with honey. Will be back for sure.
2015-01-01,2,I  *really* want to like this place, but their food is terrible. I've lived around the corner for 6 years, and every 6 months ago I go back to try a different dish or to give them another chance. My husband keeps questioning why I go back!I'm Middle Eastern and really enjoy looking for new Mid-East & Mediterranean restaurants to frequent. I'm not necessarily looking for an "authentic" experience - I just want a delicious one. * The kebabs are so dry. And served with BBQ sauce??? Weird. I think the BBQ sauce is to disguise the often burnt meat I get :/* Their rice is bland. And I can sit at home and eat plain white rice so this is saying something.* I have never tried the dessert - usually I leave my food untouched and leave as quickly as possible.I brought my parents once, and they literally spit the food out of their mouths. I have never seen them do that before in my life. The servers at the restaurant seem nice, which is why i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. But seriously.  The food? Nope.
2014-12-06,5,They make you feel at home.  Always fresh cuts of meat, the lamb is so incredible tender, virtually no chewing required.  All the meals are so tasty and fresh.  No frozen here.Ask about the fish on Fridays, what a treat and the shrimps are colossal.  Great every time.
2014-11-12,5,These guys are Listeners. Tell them what you're imaging and they can make it (place wasn't busy during the weekday lunch). Had exactly what I was craving and hit the spot; see picture. Not over priced, and comparably a great deal for Hoboken. Best part was the customer experience focused service.  Couldn't finish more than half of the food they gave me- taking it home for dinner. 12 bucks for lunch and dinner? That's a deal.
2014-10-24,3,Picked up a gyro sandwich and a gyro platterIt was good and we do take out every other week, so we keep going back but nothing specialPita is not homemade, can't be mistaken when they give it to you in the manufactures bagHummus may be homemade, I just don't know
2014-09-30,1,We just order chicken tika masala and side of falafel.  We are greatly disappointed.  I see why we don't come back here often and why the restaurant was empty. The owners need to wake up and realize they need to change.  Our chicken was dry, bland and covered up with tons of dry chili pepper.  The falafel was ok but small.  There is six small sizes of falafel the size of a dime.   Couldn't they spare the normal size for the price we paid.  I wished I could remember not to return here. This place left me hungry because the food was not edible. I couldn't even eat the rice.  It was hard and seasoned with tons of dry chili pepper too. This place is doomed.  It just hasn't yet gone out of business.  I support local businesses but not this one.
2014-09-24,5,I've been eating at this restaurant for many years. Sorry I never gave it a review before. When I lived in Hoboken it was my "go to" place. Always excellent and always very friendly. Stopped in recently and it was like coming home. Ali Baba got me hooked on middle eastern food. I go out of my way to eat here. Excellent choice for fresh take out food. Another reviewer mentioned that Ali Baba has been in Hoboken for 30 years and yes, that really means something in Hoboken where restaurants open and close constantly.
2014-08-27,5,Been in business for over 30 years and that speaks high volumes in this town!  Everything is fresh and made to order and they certainly do not skimp. Hummus to-go is served with an entire bag of toufoyan pita..yes a bag!  My favorite is the chicken tikka platter and the babganoush.  It's usually on the quiet side with some cool middle eastern music playing and it's BYOB.  Great place for a casual dinner or date night!
2014-08-09,4,Generally the food is really good. I love how the sauces on the side of the platters are so tasty! I ordered a chicken tikka platter, I was fasting and hungry so it tasted good to me. The price however,  is a bit too high. The place is very decent snd they have dim lighting.  The manager is really nice himself and the waitress was on top of her job. Overall good experience but might not go here soon cause of the pricing. ..
2014-08-07,4,Love this place!  Best hummus ever.  Try the chicken tikka rice platter--so delicious and spicy.  Also, delicious veggie salad comes on all the open sandwiches.Abe is amazing.
2014-08-03,4,My friends and I went there about several weeks ago. The food is good however, the pricing is a bit too high for the food that is provided. They were really nice to us and the waitress was super cheerful. It was a great environment.
2014-05-03,2,went here once. I felt like they didn't really try. the food was greasy and all kind of tasted the same. it was also COMPLETELY empty. I think this place needs a modern makeover to the decor and menu
2014-04-07,3,I was here over the weekend for a friend's bday dinner. My friend has eaten here before and loves the place because it's a small intimate restaurant with good food and BYOB. Although many reviews have praised this restaurant, I would have to give it only a three star review. A table was reserved under my friend's name as it was a surprise birthday party. Our fault was we got there an hour late, but the staff was generous enough to hold the tables for us. Our waitress was a good sport and very patient with taking about 10 people's orders. My fiancé and I ordered the chicken smothered platter and loved it. Their portions are a good size so sharing is suggested. I can't say the food was the best but it was good. Some of the chicken I tasted in my dish tasted different. You know when you can tell what's real chicken and what's packaged chicken you can get at the supermarket? That's what I felt like I was tasting. The sauce the chicken was 'smothered' in was delicious along with the onion flavoring and rice on the side. My only disappointment was the difference in texture when it came to my platter. I did not complain about this as it was nearing the end of the night and the restaurant was about to close. My group were the last to leave the restaurant and the staff did not kick us out. They waited patiently for each of us to leave and couldn't blame them for vacuuming once it was nearing 1130pm. I took two stars off for my chicken platter because the rest of the food was amazing. I would recommend others to try this restaurant, keeping in mind the time of when the restaurant closes. Although my chicken felt different, I would recommend the chicken smothered platter because of the sauce the chicken is drenched in.
2014-03-15,4,This has been the go to spot for me and my very good friend to eat and catch up. The menu is definitely a blend of mediterranean and middle eastern foods. My friend, who is from Lebanon, says the mid-eastern dishes are pretty authentic and Palestinian style. The hummus and baba is very good and I always order the kufta platter.
2014-02-26,3,Ordered this for lunch one day. I got the baba ganoush pita sandwich with a side of falafel. I actually liked the falafel better than the baba ganoush but i think its because i prefer hotter things in my pita rather than cold eggplant. BUT they were both still delicious and definitely filling. I also got a side of their hot sauce which was tang yet spicy (my fave). I would recommend this place for sure!
2013-12-01,5,Waitress was very friendly. Excellent service. Went for lunch on a Sunday and food was delicious. Ordered kufta platter, and Greek salad which were both large portions. Wasn't loud or crowded. Would definitely go back.
2013-09-26,5,I've been eating at Ali Baba for 5 years - they are the best middle eastern restaurant in Hoboken!  Their food is always fresh, their prices are reasonable, and they have great choices for my vegetarian wife.  They have great lunch specials - $3 falafels!  They've also added some really great specials, including the highest quality shawarma I've ever had.  Favorite dishes: - Fatoosh salad- Falafel - Chicken kabobs - Shawarma (on special sometimes)
2013-09-01,1,Have eaten WAY BETTER mediterranean food from Paterson, NJ and from the city. This place is a joke compared to other restaurants. An its definitely way over priced. Will not come back here again. If you know about how this food should taste then you would agree. Service also sucks big time!!!
2013-08-21,5,My favorite place in Hoboken. The food is healthy, inexpensive, and plentiful. For a real deal get one of the rice platters. The setting is comfortable. The owner, who is also the chief chef, makes customers feel like they're at home. He is joined by the head waitress Jackie, who is affable and friendly.
2013-06-24,4,Very good mediteranean food.  My boyfriend and i went here and had their falafel platter.  We were surprised to here it did not come with rice, so we ordered it on the side.  It was very yummy.  The platter comes with humus, light salad, falafel, and some hot pickled peppers.  I also had their kebbeh side.  Had i known i was only going to get 1 i would have ordered more.  It was delicious.  If you like mediteranean food i highly recommend this restaurant.  It is quite delicious.
2013-05-06,2,Food variety is more than Mamoun's.Food quality is less than Mamoun's.Prices are much higher than Mamoun's.Enormous main course plates.I've been to Ali Baba twice and both were a disappointment. Their greek salad is one of the worst with tiny pieces of cheese, vinegar as dressing and all kinds of greens placed in layers on a plate. Shish lamb kebab was so chewy that I gave up on it. Baba Ganoush had large chunks of eggplant that were poorly cut. Hummus was tasteless. And the basmati rice had no texture, more like cemented together. Meals were accompanied by warm pita bread. Their so called stew made daily by the chef had very little meat, mostly veggies.The food is certainly not worth the price tag and the place looks a bit run down, not clean.Not coming back.
2013-04-21,4,I have only ordered online from Ali Baba but it has become one of our go-to online ordering places.  The food comes very quickly, its reasonably priced, large portions and very tasty.
2013-04-12,4,Very good- The hummus was spot on (isn't that one of the prerequisites to knowing you're at the right place?)  I don't hit the Mediterranean restaurant scene often, so it was fun eating here to mix it up.  Almost seemed like a fusion of a few cultures here as they have middle eastern & some greek dishes...like gyros (albeit, not lamb).  It's a BYOB- only beer and wine as we found out after bringing a bottle of Jack to mix into our ginger ales...(they let us drink it anyway, just had to keep the bottle on the low low).Last note:  this place has been in business for 35 years- now there's a statement verifying that the food is solid.
2013-02-04,4,Great tasting homemade food run by a really great family. Much less stylish than the outside suggests but a comfortable laid back ambiance and quality meals.
2013-02-04,2,I wanted to like this place -- a good friend used to live in the apartment below it, and I was always curious and it seemed to smell good.  Went there for lunch today.  The pita was burnt, and the kebab came with a sort of non-Middle-Eastern BBQ sauce that tasted like it was from Burger King.  Other than that, the food was merely OK.  Service was friendly and quick, which is why it gets two stars.I'm sticking with the Turkish places on 2nd Ave. or Black Iris in Fort Greene from now on.
2013-02-04,5,Great family owed and run business.. Best falafel I have ever had & the hummus is always freshly made! They have their own brand of sodas, black cherry is my favorite! I'm a fan of spice so I go for the "chicken tika" made with their home made hot sauce. I've eaten here my whole life and never been disappointed.. A must try!
2012-12-16,3,3.5 run of the mill Middle Eastern place. Don't get me wrong- I liked this place. The staff is so friendly and attentive. The food doesn't isn't out of this world but its a good staple place for your falafel fix, or for healthy grilled chicken in a pita, etc. It was pretty empty at noon on a Sat and while its not a spacious restaurants, it's a good size for a small group. The menu offers quite a lot- from grilled meat to veg only platters. I ordered the Ony veg platter which was babaganoush,(yummy!)  hummus, falafel (small), homemade grape leaves with aromatic wild rice (very yummy). and lots of salad, olives, pickle and hot peppers. It's really a lot of food for $13.My dad had the grilled chicken tikka open face sandwich with yogurt sauce, which came with pickles and salad. The chicken tikka was a nice smoky flavor but still tender. My mom had the Sahara chicken which was whole grilled chicken breast with really fresh grilled veggies (zucchini mostly). These were in the $12 range- only thing Is that  my mom said her chicken tasted too charcoal-y, you need to really like that charred taste (I do)One more thing to note is that the portions are huge here. So come hungry.  Like I said, good homey Middle Eastern-  but nothing to run home about, nothing complex.  Id def eat here again though. Its just what you'd expect when you crave kebabs and the like
2012-09-13,5,Such a great BYOB place to go with friends. Food is AMAZING and portion sizes are huge. Relaxing and interesting atmosphere. There is definitely something for everyone here.Last time we went with 8 people (a few people shared entrees) and the bill was around $85.00?!?!?So unheard of in Hoboken.
2012-07-16,4,Perhaps some of the best food in Hoboken!We went there on Saturday night around 8pm. The staff was super friendly and attentive from the minute we walked in to the time we left.We started with an order of their tabooly, falafels, and baba ganoush to go along with the warm basket of pita that was brought out. The tabooly was to die for, it had just the right amount of parsley and lemon absolutely delicious. The falafels were like mini falafels that has an awesome crunch with each bite. The baba ganoush is by far the best baba ganoush I have ever eaten. For our main course we shared the combination of chicken, lamb, gyro, and kufta served with rice platter. It was completely amazing, everything was cooked to perfection. We opted for lentil rice, which was delicious and our meats were also servers with Yogurt Cucumber salad, hummus, and baba ganoush. The only reason I won't give this place a 5 start rating is because the kufta was served with some kind of BBQ or A1 like sauce on the bottom and it was so not necessary! The kufta was awesome all on its own.We will definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu here. Our only regret is not walking into this place sooner!If you love middle eastern food, you'll love this place!
2012-04-19,1,Horrible! The meat smelt funny and service was average. The food was not what we expected at all. The rice was mushy and presentation was very disappointing. We ordered a platter Everything was thrown on one plate. The chicken/lamb/ beef/ gyro was piled on top of each other an we had to pick thru to figure out which was what!!!Very disappointing, My husband who can't get enough of kebabs on a norm, left more then half his meal because he couldn't stand the strange smell.
2012-04-01,1,I have never, EVER been so disappointed by a restaurant that I've tried with a promotional coupon. I would like to note, first of all, that as soon as we walked in the restaurant, we were bum-rushed by the waitresses regarding whether we had purchased a Living Social deal. We disclosed that we had, but the sub-mediocrity that followed makes me suspicious that they served us smaller, crappier portions BECAUSE they already knew that we weren't paying full price for the meal???Now, if I am at a restaurant in the New York metropolitan area, and I have to reach across the table for the salt to flavor my meal, I just can't help but feel embarrassed; both for myself, and for the restaurant's chef. At Ali Baba, the curry lamb stew, to my dismay, was absolutely tasteless, and I couldn't choke it down without the addition of salt AND pepper. It was served with a side of unremarkable lentil fried rice. The mousaka was not as terrible as the stew, but it wasn't really that good, either. The portions of both dishes were inappropriately small. Even the dressing on the Greek side salad was way under-seasoned. We ended up leaving so dissatisfied with our dinner that we headed directly to Mamoun's for shawarma immediately upon exiting the restaurant. Mamoun's was reliably tasty, yet we ate it quickly, and out of anger, for our previous experience at Ali Baba.
2012-03-25,4,So many things to love about Ali Baba:*Very friendly staff*BYO*Tasty food at reasonable pricesWent this Saturday night and got the Grand Combo. For $17 I got 3 different meats along with hummus, baba ganoush, and rice. I got 2 days worth of meat and it was all great.Good spot for good food at good prices and a relaxing evening.
2012-03-24,5,If you go before 5pm, you will probably be the only guests which means you get SPOILED by the cook and waitress even more than normal. I love the food here and the cook (owner) is super cool. Very friendly and accommodating. Fresh squeezed OJ, fresh falafel's, whole wheat pita bread served warm with fresh hummus- super yummy. An oasis on Washington street.
2012-02-24,4,Amazing food , great prices, large portions, good service .. all this at an affordable price!! Will definitely recommend to all Mediterranean food lovers
2012-02-11,4,Came here with a living social deal - really good food with giant portions. I would definitely go again - and BYOB is always a plus!  I got delivery from here once, and my order was mixed up.  They brought me my new order and did not charge or want the food back.  They have great service and care for their patrons.  I think this place is one of the better independently owned restaurants around here.  I always get the lamb with rice.    *Enjoy*
2012-01-19,4,This is place is bring-your-own-bottle AND has the friendliest serving staff. Ever.We got the falafel, which was not the best falafel I've had. They made the pieces really small so that they were mostly crispy and fried and didn't have much soft fluffy center. I prefer falafel to be large with a soft herby inside. We also tried the dolma (stuffed grape leaves), delicious and tabouli. As an entree we shared the steak, which was grilled and juicy and came with grilled vegetables and delicious rice.Atmosphere is nice and they leave you be. On our way out the waiter even asked for our email address to add us to their mailing list which notifies customers of special events with belly dancers!
2012-01-04,5,I eat here at least once a week.This is the only restaurant I will miss when I leave Hoboken.As such, if you can only try one restaurant in the mile square city, this has to be the one.
2011-10-20,5,Good Mideastern food, but amazing service! Just went this evening and ordered a bunch of items, including the yogurt and cucumber salad. After we were served I realized that the yogurt could be unpasteurized, and being pregnant, knew I had to ask. Turns out that it wasn't (they even brought out the container to show me), so I politely didn't eat it, while my friend enjoyed. About 10 minutes later the waitress brought another bowl and said that her father (the chef) made me a new dish with yogurt that was pasteurized. SO incredibly thought and totally unnecessary. Definitely a small, family run business, and prides itself on taking care of its customers. Thanks Ali Baba! I will be back for sure!
2011-09-27,4,I have ordered a bunch of times on seamless since my last review.  The issues seem to be completely gone. Fast, delicious, and always pay attention to the extra comments for extra yogurt sauce!
2011-09-02,1,Review only for the hookah- Nope. Will never return. 25 bucks for hookah thats not even starbuzz,, what were they thinking!!! Mind u, we didn't get food, just hookah.The actual apparatus was so old that the nozzle was rusty.The plastic mouth pieces didnt fit the pipe properly and the hookah was so burnt, its because my bf is a hookah fanatic that he was able to fix it. Not coming back.
2011-08-13,4,I don't eat Indian food often, but when I do, I choose Ali Baba.I have eaten here a few times and never have been disappointed.  I always start off with naan bread and typically someone at my table orders chicken tikkamassala.  From there the menu choices can go anywhere.  I prefer the lamb but they also have goat items too!  The prices are affordable and you get a lot of food with each serving.Not bad, especially within walking distance!
2011-08-06,4,With the onslaught of middle eastern restaurants in Hoboken over the last few months, it's easy to forgot the original that's been with us for so long.  I stopped by for a quick lunch one day this week, and ordered the vegetarian combo plate.  It was beyond good...it was great.  Some highlights:  The super fresh falafel was excellent, the baba ganoush was the best I've had, and the hummus was perfect.  Because it's rarely crowded, it's a great place to go with a few friends and a bottle of wine.
2011-07-23,5,My wife and I go to a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants, and this is by far the best we've been to. The vegetarian grand combo was amazing in every detail. The staff were all very pleasant, too. One poster here has commented that the tables seemed like an afterthought in a take-out business, but I did not feel that at all... the decor, atmosphere, and spacing of tables all added to the experience. We look forward to going back.
2011-06-10,3,Family run cozy little place. Casual, inexpensive, BYOB and GOOD food.
2011-04-04,4,I come here often for lunch and I love the place. The sandwiches are fantastic and the service friendly.
2011-03-01,4,I don't get the hate for this place! I've never had issues with cleanliness here. I usually order the vegetarian grand combo and it's a huge tasty meal. They have whole wheat pita which is a plus. The hookah is fun, and the hostess/waitress is always so friendly.
2011-02-06,5,I've been here a number of times and haven't been disappointed yet. The food is great and the staff is super nice.
2011-01-16,4,The food is definitely delicious. The only problem I had with it was the wait time on food, but the place was packed when we walked in with a group of eight, and it was a Sunday afternoon, so it's understandable. Enjoy! Try the cinnamon tea.
2011-01-15,2,I went here on a Saturday afternoon with a friend for lunch to just catch up and we found this place deep in Hoboken and decided to check it out.  I got to saw the decor is pretty to eat around but it is quite small place for my liking. I often like spacious places.I don't remember the food that I eat because it was just alright and it very forgettable disk for my taste but the baba gonoush was great for the opening of our meal.  We order the same disk twice because it was that good.  The pita was good also but I don't know if it was homemade or packaged.Pardon my spelling regarding any disk.
2010-11-09,3,Being Lebanese, I'm probably a little tougher on a middle eastern place than I should be. I ordered the lamb platter. The baba and hummus are good, but I can make it better which is kind of a negative in my books (why pay someone else to do a worse job?) The lamb was very good and at $15 I had a good meal at a steal of a price in Hoboken.  Overall it seems like this place does killer take-out business and had extra room and thought "hey, how about throwing some tables and chairs in here?"
2010-09-28,3,Didn't get to eat here and honestly afraid to now because of the cleanliness issues I'm reading about. However, only Hookah spot in Hoboken and BYOB - gotta love that for pregaming before the city.
2010-09-19,4,I love this place. The combo platters are great value for two people to share. It's tasty hot, fresh and authentic middle eastern. Have eaten here several times, service is always pleasant, helpful and speedy. I wouldl eat here more often if I lived closer, love the cute atmosphere, has a funky kind of vibe. Hummus is outstanding, the garlic chicken and lamb shwarma are to die for.Eat here, you won't be disappointed.
2009-12-06,1,Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting.I had an unwarmed lamb soup (microwave no working?) and my guest had a vegetarian meal. The hummus and baba ganoush were enough to make me sick later. (And by sick I mean throw up.) I didn't appreciate the putrid-like taste that apparently others enjoy.That being said the place seemed busy and was getting a lot of calls for delivery. Me -- I'll never go back -- maybe you'll like it?
2009-07-10,3,I've been to this place twice, as I'm not a huge Middle Eastern food aficionado. Both times I got the same dish (by accident actually) - the chicken sandwich. Yes, it doesn't scream Middle Eastern, but it was actually really tasty and only about 6 or 7 bucks. It was pretty big and filling, and the hot sauce (optional) was really tangy but not to the point where you can't taste your food.Both times I also had a little bit of my girlfriend's food ( I think once it was a gyro and the other I can't remember) - also pretty tasty. Server was pretty friendly too. Only downside is that they automatically charge tip. Very SoBe like, which we could have done without. But the prices are pretty fair.. most meals were $10 or under. I thing I'll go back and try a different sandwich soon. Solid 3 star place.
2009-03-02,5,the only place selling lahmajun.. aka meat pie! def recommend it... awesome! great service as well..very casual
2009-03-01,4,We had a nice meal at this intimate family-run spot last night.  I found the service and the food were both quite good.  We shared a large plate of grilled vegetables (onions, peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes and eggplant), smothered in a delicious sauce that had a tangy BBQ flavor.  The Ony's Meatless combo is a sampler of standard Middle Eastern fare. The baba ganoush and hummus had fresh flavors with the right balance of garlic, lemon and seasoning. Much better than any store bought versions I've tried.   The falafels were crispy outside, tender inside.  The Speecha pie was a bit like a pizza with meat, peppers and onions on a flat pita with no cheese.  There are plenty of options for vegetarians, though I would have liked a fish or shrimp skewer option. The staff was attentive, polite and helpful. The menu does say they charge a 15-20% gratuity on checks over $50. BYOB, which is common in Hoboken.  They do not accept Amex, if you care.
2009-02-26,2,In the past few years, I have begun to diversify my palate and have become more interested in ethnic cuisines.  I really like Middle Eastern food and was pleasantly surprised to find one of these restaurants right in my area...and especially one "celebrating its 25th anniversary"!  However, my friend and I were less than impressed with our meal.Let me first describe the environment.  Picture a quaint, intimate dining room with Middle Eastern accents.  Then, imagine a nice, but loud caretaker screaming into the phone regarding deliveries.  Oh, and do not forget the mysterious sound of microwaving coming from the open kitchen...neither of which added to the ambiance.  The cheesy paper takeout menus apparently also serve as dine-in menus, which might as well have entitled us to leave a lesser tip.  The cuisine offerings were a confusing mix of proteins served as sandwiches, open salads, or platters.  It was difficult to discern which type of meal included which sides.  The chatty manager was very helpful with the menu, though, and helped us settle on Ali Baba Combination.  This included our choice of 1 or 2 meat kebabs, hummus, baba ganoush, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, feta cheese, pickles, olives, peppers, and yellow rice.  My chicken kebabs were tender and decently tasty, though I suspected they had been nuked in the microwave.  The feta cheese was a bit slimy, and I only received one random chunk of it.  All in all the platter provided a lot of substance for the reasonable price under $15.  However, the hummus had an odd strong lemony taste, which my friend described as "soapy".  This should have been one of my favorite components on the platter, but instead turned me off.Like many restaurants in Hoboken, Ali Baba is a BYOB, which could be good or bad.Ali Baba has potential, but I think they need to focus a bit more on the quality of their food.
2009-02-05,1,After reading the previous yelper's comments about how this place charges their own gratuity, I had to call and find out for myself.Indeed it is true!A woman answered and when I asked "is it true that you charge gratuity on a party of 2?" she fumbled around and finally got out "well yes if there is a big party we do." and when I said "but what about for a party of 2?" she said "well it depends on how much you eat!" and that's when I said, "ok. i don't need to hear anymore."That is just crazy-town.Yelpers I wouldn't waste your time.
2008-08-01,4,The food is amazing.  There's nothing I've had here that didn't rate highly with me or friends.  Moussaka - killer.  My favorite is the lamb curry platter.  It's a different curry, one that traditional curry lovers will like, and even curry haters would like.Open with hummus or baba, they're both excellent here, and I love the way they toast the pita bread for dipping.Have the turkish coffee with desert before leaving.  It is made perfectly (complete with sludge at the bottom), and just the right amount of sweetness.  The baklava is pretty good.  Ok, I've had better elsewhere, but it's still good, and probably the only thing on the menu that isn't the best in the area.Even the gyros are good here!  They measure up to any others I've had outside of a tiny joint on 58th and 9th that's no longer there.So if the food is so outstanding, why only four stars?Well, it's the service.  But read on.  The staff there is actually terrific, the problem is just that when the place is busy, there are far too few of them.  The waitress I've seen there most often completely busts her butt and always has a great attitude.  But there's only one of her, and she's human.I feel a little bad rating it down one star for service when the staff really does try hard, but owner should try to anticipate and handle busy periods more effectively.Definitely eat here - if you like Mediterranean (incl Moroccan, Greek, Turkish), you will not be disappointed!
