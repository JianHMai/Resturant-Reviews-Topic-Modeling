2021-11-14,2,Food is great. Two stars for poor customer service and attitude from man in charge of expediting. I ordered 1 bagel at 10:48 exactly. I literally work down the block about 3 stores away IN A RESTAURANT. I order every weekend so I completely understand how busy they are. I never complain. I returned exactly 3 times after receiving a 35 minute wait time ( ordered online ). Unfortunately I had to work at 12pm. I returned at 11:15, 11:30 and 11:45. It still was not ready. Finally after clocking in, I was able to get a quick break to run and pick it up.Not only does the man tell me he threw away my bagel but then continues to argue with me after I explained that I had already returned 3 times. My coworker ordered at 11:45. The final time I returned to pick up all three bagels. Their two bagels were ready while mine was thrown out. Instead of comping my bagel and remaking it . He tells me to pay for it and he would deliver it very rudely. You just lost a customer for a $6 bagel for your rudeness and horrible customer service.Sucks when you work in the restaurant industry and are one of the most understanding customers, we always get the short end of the stick. We will no longer be ordering from here.
2021-10-29,1,The oats??? and did they put like caster sugar or something??  It's giving discarded bread but they're in a budget
2021-10-09,1,Service here was really bad. From out of town and staying at a nice Airbnb. Took a morning walk saw this place thought I would try it out. Placed my order for one bagel and waited as at least 10 other people walked in and placed their order and left. Finally had to go up to ask. Another gentleman that was waiting for a large order...even he noticed how everyone else had placed their order and left and I was still waiting. The lady taking the orders was just absolutely rude!!!! I would not recommend this place at all!!
2021-09-19,2,Bagels are good but not worth the headache. Deliveries take well over 2 hours and if you go in person it's complete chaos. Unorganized and rude. Once you do manage to get your order you'll be lucky if everything is correct.. don't try calling to let them know there's an issue with your order, because they don't answer their phone. The decent bagels don't outweigh the crappy customer service.
2021-09-19,1,Good food but they have awful service and process. Weekends are chaos - expect to wait for your food for 3x the amount of time they give you. Shame because the food is one of the better spots in town.
2021-09-12,5,Anyone telling you there is a better bagel in Hoboken is getting a commission.Plain and simple there is no better, faster, or wider variety of bagel around.
2021-08-18,3,JP's Bagel Express is definitely a bagel staple in Hoboken. Located close to the water, the location is definitely great and central.Walking in on a Sunday, I was not surprised by how busy it was - the line was literally out of the door. I decided to go for a staple and order a breakfast sandwich, everything bagel with eggs, cheese, and turkey sausage. The flavor was tasty as any standard breakfast bagel will be and the size was okay but not overwhelming like I strive for. Overall, there wasn't anything unique about my order but it definitely hit the spot for what I was looking for.Will definitely be back to get my breakfast grub on and hopefully try something unique on the menu!
2021-07-25,3,I like that the location is convenient and that they have jalapeño bagels and cream cheese. Ordering is a bit chaotic and it's a hit or miss as  they skimp on the cream cheese sometimes. Overall it's solid but there are probably better places in the area.
2021-07-16,1,It's really such a shame how nasty the woman in there is. She's probably one of the owners, but that doesn't give you the right to yell at people like they're shit. She was extremely rude and told me "not to come" when I told her how she's always super nasty to myself and customers. I said that's how you lose business. Don't go here.
2021-07-02,4,Pretty yummy bagels at a prime location! When I got there around noon there was a small line but not too bad, most people were just waiting for their orders (looks like it's common to get one of the bagel sandwiches + a smoothie here). I just opted for a bag of 13 bagels + 1/2 lb of low-fat veggie cream cheese.Disclaimer: I did not try all 13 bagels yet )': so my review is solely based on an untoasted, everything bagel that my bf cut open a bit unevenly ahahaEverything bagel: very chewy, yummy, but needed a LOT more seeds/other everything seasoning on the top. Still tasted very good untoasted.Veggie cream cheese: super savory, I'd say there's much more cream cheese than peppers as I've seen in some other fillings, but the peppery flavor is definitely throughout the cream cheese.Excited to try the other bagels. If you're ok with waiting on line, I'd also try one of their sandwiches or get your bagel toasted/cut instore (I was just in a rush cuz it was really hot).Update: tried the egg bagel and everything whole wheat bagel - both yummy just the everything REALLY needs more everything seasoning.
2021-07-02,5,Bagel was yummy and soft, bacon was just right crispy but not over cooked. They were super fast and very nice despite it being busy.
2021-06-22,5,Delicious bagel! Wait time is not too long and it always hits the spot! Been to a few bagel places in Hoboken and this is by far my favorite one, I bring visitors here every time!
2021-06-02,1,gross! DO NOT COME HERE!see attached pic of my chicken salad. absolutely unacceptable and disgusting. will never come back. unsanitary and clearly shows how they do not care and are not paying attention.
2021-04-09,5,One of my MOST FAVORITE SPOT IN HOBOKEN, for a freshly made breakfast! Their bagels  are sooooo delicious! Their Jalapeño bagel , their egg scrambled sandwich, fresh cc are just to name few of their items which are most ordered by me. I always thought of reviewing them, but never did. Finally, you guys deserve 10 stars if it were even possible. Pro tip: if you are a local or trying out during their busiest time, call ahead or order online so you won't have to wait in line for a long time ;) See you guys soon again!
2021-04-04,4,Quality bagel spot, delivers. I thought the texture of these bagels were great. They were very airy and chewy but full of flavor. I find sometimes bagels are really dense or hard which is just no good. I also saw many different types of bagels that I haven't seen before and would like to try.I did get the everything bagel which I like to use as a measurement to how good a bagel spot is, there definitely could've been more everything mix on the bagel, but again, still very delicious. Would definitely come back here again.
2021-03-23,5,We go here often for bagels and sandwiches, the food is great and staff super friendly.  Love it!
2021-03-15,5,I easily placed an online order with JP's Bagel Express the other day.  In addition to the 1.5 dozen bagels I got for a family function, which everyone loved I might add, I ordered myself a breakfast sandwich.  I had asked for my Whole Wheat Bagel scooped, which provided more room for the sandwich ingredients.  I was in awe of how soft the bagel was, even with its hollowed out insides.  Between the bread were thick slices of fresh avocado, ripe tomato, sprinkled black pepper, and roasted red peppers with cloves of garlic.  Each bite was pure heaven.  JP's Bagel Express made it simple to organize a large order with several specifications and provided all of our requests with flawless execution.
2021-03-03,5,Best Place in Town, Outstanding Customer Service. Thank You is the last thing you'll hear after you've experienced this place.
2021-02-16,5,great bagels, the everyday bagel shop that has never disappointed. Fresh and very flavorful bagels.
2021-02-07,4,We ordered a Reuben, side of coleslaw, 3 eggs bacon cheese on a sesame bagel and on an everything bagel.When we got home everything was still hot. Packaged perfect for take out. Both bagels were soft and fresh. Our favorite was the everything bagel. Delicious! We will get that sandwich again! Eggs cooked perfect on both. Bacon and cheese great. Cheese was melted and gooey. So good! Sesame bagel was okay. My boyfriend says both bagel sandwiches are a 5. The Reuben is a 3.The Reuben was just okay. We've had better reubens. Wouldn't get that one here again. It was a little meat and barely any kraut. Strong mustard taste.Bagels here are so good and fresh!! Highly recommend the everything bagel. It's excellent!
2020-12-10,1,What a crock of shit this is. I spent 15$ on 2 sandwiches and a coffee.  lesson never get the Taylor ham egg and cheese. This is microwaved garbage from this place. Save your money go down the street and grab yourself a Taylor ham egg and cheese from Ali's food truck it's cheaper and it's cooked on a grill.
2020-11-21,5,Delicious bagel! HUGE and I love that they have tofu cream cheese, an amazing alternative for someone looking for a dairy free or vegan option.
2020-10-10,1,Owner was so rude his daughter apologized on behalf of him.  He was upset with me over the order not being made right? Sounds kinda backwards since his staff was the one who messed up the order, taking them3x to correct it but he chose to be upset with me because I had to ask for modifications due to allergies.  Way better options in town who actually appreciates their customers and the money they are making. Pic of one of the bagels - underwhelmed
2020-08-28,5,Stopped by for lunch with my kids after the pier. Yummy food and exceptional service! Kids loved the rainbow bagels and the turkey/bacon sandwich. The standouts were the Boom Boom sauce and the sub with sweet peppers. Staff was friendly and quick. Felt safe eating outside where they have a couple tables and chairs set up.
2020-08-03,4,It's been a hot second since I've had a bagel (made-to-order eggs or avo toast at home will do that to ya) -- but we grabbed one from JP's on our walk around Hoboken this past weekend and it was pretty dang good. I wouldn't go as far to say "it's the best bagel I've ever had" (that distinction, I think, goes to my old stomping ground fave Brooklyn Bagel) but it's decent. More importantly, the staff is friendly in all the right ways and they're doing their part in keeping us safe in this COVID world.TBD on how it stacks up (bagel-wise) to Wonder Bagels in JC or any others in Hoboken. It take me awhile to be able to say though, so take this review with a grain of salt... and some everything spice!
2020-07-24,1,I'm really disappointed. This used to be my "go to" bagel spot and I've never really had a complaint besides they OVER CHARGE for EVERYTHING . I'm willing to pay for good quality so I stuck around, however I started noticing they're very stingy for the price. I had a bad order today. I ordered a sandwich and took one bite and immediately threw it out. I called concerned being that this is the first time I've had a real complaint about the quality. I asked to speak to a manager, she was not only rude by trying to rush me off the phone. She's so prideful in her business that she didn't believe me by saying she found it very hard to believe that my sandwich was bad, and there was nothing she could do for me. I didn't even want a refund, I just wanted to advise her to check those items, it case anyone else has this issue. I'm no longer a costumer not because of my one bad order, but because of the one time I did it was handled very poorly.  I'm disgusted by the service. I'll head up to bagels on the Hudson from now on.
2020-07-24,4,Best bagels in NJ? No. Best bagels in Hoboken? Absolutely yes. Only place I'll go to in Hoboken.
2020-07-11,5,Best bagel place in Hoboken. Bagels are fresh and if you like BEC they make the eggs fresh and actually give you the full amount of eggs! Other places in Hoboken have cheaped out on eggs. Good customer service also!
2020-07-09,3,Look, the food is solid. It's definitely expensive, though. My main gripe is that your ordering experience is totally dependent on who takes your order. Most of the cashiers / cooks are good, but there is one cashier who just can't listen. I don't see her there too often, but it's frustrating when you're paying for food and coffee and it's wrong. Black coffee ends up light and sweet. Ketchup ends up on BECs. Sometimes sausage instead of bacon. Ask for turkey, get ham. I just don't get it, and it's the worst when it's a large group order and most of it is wrong. There has to be some better process here. This could easily be 4 stars if not 5, but please get your cashiers to pay attention and write down the correct order.
2020-07-03,4,I recently moved to Jersey City from Queens and JP's is the closest I'll get to my beloved NYC bagels.(Yes, I tried "the spot" in JC and it was an abomination, so off to Hoboken I went for my weekly carb fix.)The bagels are big and they have a great selection of options (oat bran, whole wheat sesame, rainbow, whole wheat everything, egg everything, I can go on and on). The same goes for their cream cheese selection.Hello, Jackie's Jersey bagel spot! Let's be friends.
2019-03-11,5,A staple in the Hoboken community - it's packed especially in the mornings on weekdays and by noon the weekends. Rightfully so because they have a wide assortment of fresh bagels that you see immediately when you walk in. Service is quick and friendly! I normally order my go-to breakfast - Taylor Ham, Egg, and Cheese on a toasted everything bagel with ketchup, salt and pepper; and an iced Hazelnut coffee. Never had an issue and always tastes amazing. PLEASE try the hazelnut coffee - one of the best I've had.
2019-01-13,4,Fresh bagels, quick service and great location if you need a quick bite around the Hoboken terminal. Cream cheese & bagel flavors are somewhat limited compared to other shops in the Jersey City area but for convenience, this will do the trick!
2018-11-04,4,A great bagel spot downtown right near the PATH if you're running to the city and need to grab a bite, this is a quick spot to grab and if you're driving out of town and don't want to wait for Starbucks across the street this is another great option early in the mornings, it does packed during rush hour, but they move quite fast. They have lot of options for drinks as well, there is not much parking but there is bike parking and no restroom, so if you have to go, you can run across the street to Starbucks, they take cash or credit and Apple Pay.
2018-09-30,3,I wanted to get out of my normal bagel comfort zone and stumbled upon this place along with my boyfriend. PJ's--a small, no-frills spot close to the train station--was crowded on a weekend morning, but orders moved relatively quickly. I ordered a whole wheat everything bagel with low fat Scallion cream cheese, as well as an iced coffee. The staff was polite, but there was a snag when I asked if they had turbinado sugar/Sugar in the Raw. I clarified that it was "the sugar in the brown packets." This resulted in my coffee being sweetened with brown sugar. Not ideal, not a great taste.The bagels themselves were okay taste wise, but I probably would've gotten a different cream cheese (it was a little on the sour side, and tasted diet-y). They were also on the smaller side, not a great bang for the buck. Overall, the bagels here are okay, but not my first choice in Hoboken. O'Bagel, to me, would be a better choice.
2018-09-26,1,Terrible. A place that's supposed to serve bagels did a crappy job of making my sandwich.  And they charged me extra for cheese that wasn't fresh. I respectfully explained my discontentment the sandwich that didnt match the description of what i ordered, the woman at the register was indignant.  First off, she was immediately hostile and didnt believe me. The guy who took my order lied about what i said. Then she went back and forth disrespecting me even though i was only seeking the issue to be rectified. After a battle, i was given a refund but was called a bitch as i left.  This is the kind of business they run,  i will never spend my money here again.  Support BETTER business.
2018-09-24,5,Love going there in the mornings, I don't think you can go wrong on bagels. They are a little pricey but it's worth it!
2018-09-21,5,Love this place. Totally addicted. Its hard to eat at other deli's now because JP's is so good. They always have flagels or bialys in stock and the vegetable cream cheese has legitimate vegetables in it :) always happy here
2018-09-20,2,Definitely watch out what they charge you for.I asked for a bagel with bacon and cheddar cream cheese. I got my food all the way to work and realized they gave me a bagel with bacon and cheddar. I could've figured out the mixup if I was actually offered a receipt after paying.I went back and let them know of the mix up and asked if they would just comp me a bagel another day. They would only comp me $1.50.. Even though I'm pretty sure the difference of what I was charged and what I was supposed to be charged was more than that.Good bagels, okay service (I guess), just make sure you get a receipt and check your food before you leave.
2018-08-16,3,I like JPs but I'm done with them. I feel like I've been overcharged the last 4-5 times that I've visited. The other day they tried to charge me $9 for 2 bagels (one with extra cream cheese) -- didn't make sense.. and today they charged me $2 for a crappy pickle. I'm done. Bagels are good, but watch the prices.
2018-08-06,5,This is my favorite bagel place ever, it's to die for! The staff is very friendly and welcoming. I go here at least 4 times a week. The prices are very reasonable, about $4.25 for an everything bagel with butter and a coffee. There is about a 10 minute wait but it's close to the PATH and NJ transit which makes it a convenient stop.
2018-07-15,3,Stopped here before heading to the burbs on NJ transit on a Sunday morning around 9am and it was surprisingly not crowded. I went with a sesame bagel with LF veggie cream cheese and lox. Bagel was very average. The outside crust was a little too crunchy for my liking and the inside wasn't soft enough. The cream cheese to lox ratio wasn't spot on either...definitely needed double the lox! Decent bagel, but there are far better options in the area.
2018-05-03,5,Best bagels in hoboken hands down, so light and airy and served warm every time. The staff here are also so nice and they move fast. I used to live in hoboken 10 years ago and moved back. This place hasn't changed at all. Still delivering great quality bagels.
2018-02-22,4,I don't know who JP is, but I know for sure that he/she is in fact the homie. Breakfast sandwiches are consistently packed. Bagels are constantly fresh. And the service is always friendly. My El Paso wrap today was delicious as the right balance of all ingredients was served and the wrap was rolled tightttt. Best of all, food is always prepared quick so you can get in and out. Only thing holding me back from popping that 5th start up there? While the breakfast sandys are big, the wraps are a bit small for $9+
2018-02-21,5,Morning must! Conveniently located on the way to the path. Don't need to cross the river to get a great bagel! Quick service for the morning shuffle. Also offers hot lunch options as well as sandwiches!
2018-01-31,3,Pros:* no credit card minimum ** about two blocks away from the PATH train *Cons: ExpensiveThe service here is quick, and during the morning rush, efficient. The bagels here are pretty good but my only dislike about this place is how expensive it is. For a sesame bagel with cream cheese it ran me $3.50 - like what?! I thought NJ was supposed to be cheaper than NYC *sad face* It was my first time here and I had already ordered before I realized the pricing, so of course I'd pay for it. I probably won't be back since getting a bagel with cream cheese and an ice coffee at my local corner cart guy in the city runs me $2.50 for both.
2018-01-06,4,Great bagel spot with good service and *no credit card minimum*! Their coffee is strong too. They were very generous with the portions when we ordered Taylor ham/sausage egg and cheeses. The sun dried tomato cream cheese was lackluster though. It's literally regular cream cheese with a few sun dried tomatoes scattered throughout.
2017-12-30,4,Has been a Hoboken breakfast sandwich staple of mine for years.  Lots of variety but I just had a classic sausage, egg and cheese on a roll with salt pepper ketchup.  Perfectly done.  Can get a little packed on the weekends but they are well organized and move things along quickly.
2017-12-10,3,The bagels are consistently good, I always get a wheat everything bagel and it hits the spot. The place is always packed in the morning, but service is usually quick.
2017-11-05,4,Semi-confusing ordering/payment process for a newbie but their bagels are pretty good. You walk up to the counter, order and get a number, but don't pay until your number is called and the goods are transferred. It sometimes results in a large group near the register, which seems inefficient. Watching them make the bagels is fun, but the deli part of this establishment is pretty sad looking so I've never ordered from there. Cream cheese is a bit more runny than I personally prefer, but the bagel makes up for it.
2017-07-31,5,Love the breakfast. I come here every morning!!! If you are around the area def. go try it out.
2017-07-06,5,I don't understand the mixed reviews. This is definitely the best quick service breakfast in Hoboken. The people behind the counter are super friendly and fast. I have never had an issue with my breakfast order.
2017-06-25,1,I decided to give this place another try because it's the closest to my apartment and it's still the worst bagels I have ever had.  More than that, the people who work here are incredibly stupid.  They constantly get the order wrong.  However, the worst part is that the place is filthy.  I have seen cockroaches walking around.  That was the last time I will ever come back to this place.
2017-02-09,5,Hands down the best bagel place in Hoboken! They're friendly, quick, and their breakfast sandwiches are delicious.Tip: This place is usually packed on a weekend morning, but don't let that scare you away. If you want to avoid the line, come early before all the hungover people start crawling out of their beds.
2017-01-21,4,When I'm in Hoboken there is no other place I think about when I'm thinking of a bagel breakfast sandwich. JP's is amazing!  I always get great service and I truly love how they make there sandwiches. The bagels are always fresh and they even make a great omelet too. It's never a disappointment when I go to or order from JP's.
2017-01-10,1,Be aware that they are steeling your moneyI order a meet and egg sandwich and the guy charge me for cheese, when I confront me he say that the prices from the sing don't match the register. And he didn't have me my money back. With me was a quarter. But how many hundreds is that during the day. Is expensive enough already.
2016-12-20,5,Some of the best bagel sandwiches in hoboken, have been going here for years.Love Love Love this place.
2016-12-05,1,Bagel was hard as a rock.  Not once but last two times I was here.  Never had a worse bagel in my life.  Not sure if it was stale or burnt.  Will go somewhere else next time I am in town.
2016-11-02,3,Been here a few times as it's got key location in Downtown Hoboken.  You place the order, get a number, and pay when the order is ready.  The bagels are good, but not amazing, and are small for their price.  Granted, I've order the same thing each time - toasted everything with strawberry cream cheese.  The everything bagel isn't well seasoned (too much empty canvas!) and the cream cheese seems to have an artificial tinge.
2016-08-02,3,Go to JP's to put bagels in your face. A $5 breakfast sandwich will keep you full for a solid 6 hours.The bagels are fresh, soft, and chewy. They are also bread and roundness and are full of carbs to soak up whatever nonsense you decided to drink last night.Breakfast sandwiches are made to order; there isn't a microwave remotely involved in the process. A bacon, egg, and cheddar on a toasted everything bagel is my standard order, and I highly recommend you try it as well.Sure, there are a lot of places in Hoboken to get bagels. I'm not going to say JP's is the best, I could be wrong. It is, however, rather delicious, in a convenient location (for walking, less so for parking), and has outdoor seating for people watching.Want some coffee with that bagel? Starbucks across the street.Want a fruit shake with that bagel? Rejuice-a-Nation is a few doors down.Have room for dessert? Carlos's is around the corner.There's probably going to be a line, especially on the weekends. At that point, "JP's Bagel Express" is likely to become "JP's Bagel Eventually".If you have to eat something as soon as you walk in...call ahead.
2016-07-02,1,Terrible $8 panini. Would not recommend. Looked bad and tasted worse. McDonald's would have been better.
2016-06-26,1,Honestly just awful. And expensive.Went there to get two bagels... One with just taylor ham and ketchup (no egg or cheese). The other was a bacon egg and cheese with avocado. Also asked for a little bacon on the side,When she rung me up it was $17. Really? They forgot the ketchup on the first bagel and there was so little avocado on the second one I dont even know what I paid for. The side of bacon was also so bad that I tossed it. Never again.
2016-06-04,3,I came by to pick up something quick before an appointment. The line was short enough so I was able to put in my order of a sesame bagel with cream cheese and lox and got it within a few minutes. What surprised me as I got my order was the cost. For one sesame bagel with lox and cream cheese and an Honest bottle of tea, my total was $12. Did I just get taken? Someone please tell me I didn't pay $12 for a bagel sandwich and 1 drink. The sandwich was good but $12?!? Although the sandwich was good I dropped it one star purely for the price.
2016-05-20,1,The bagel and lox were good but the store packaged trail mix I purchased expired in 2006... almost ten years ago... should have realized based on the dis colored label before purchasing it but thankfully examined it closely before eating it considering I am 40weeks pregnant! watch the food there!!!!
2016-05-16,5,As a self-professed bagel snob, I think I am sufficiently qualified to let you know that JP's has the best bagels in Hoboken. No question. All of the bagels are fresh and delicious (my fave is whole wheat everything). All of the spreads are great (fat free scallion or regular veggie are my faves) and their bacon egg and cheese is AMAZING.   There are many bagel shops in town but I will remain loyal to JPs!!
2016-05-15,3,Good Bagels but they have fallen off. Their Taylor ham, Egg and cheese is weak.  It has a convenient location but they are only as good as their last sandwich.
2016-04-10,5,Bagels here are always delicious. Also, the hazelnut iced coffee is amazing. Staff is always friendly. Best bagels in Hoboken for sure.
2016-03-30,3,This is a pretty decent bagel place in Hoboken right near the PATH.  Usually, I get the onion or everything bagel with egg whites and cheese. Normally, I wouldn't necessarily agree with the negative reviews for the service here - usually it's average service.  However, I went last week on a Saturday for a quick take out breakfast sandwich and ordered my usual....since I've never had a problem with my order - I didn't check it before I leave.  I did confirm the order upon pick up and the cashier agreed with my order.  I got home to realize there was bacon and ham on my sandwich (as a vegetarian - I definitely couldn't eat it and was slightly grossed out).  I called the place and they weren't even apologetic about the switch up.  I had to walk back to get my sandwich replaced.  This isn't typical for the place but a genuine apology would have gone a long way.
2016-03-11,5,Hands down best bagels in Hoboken. Yelp's telling me my review's 'shorter than most' but that should be all you need to know.
2016-03-04,4,This is your typical morning grab and go to work breakfast place. Just the standard set of options, bagel and cheese, coffee, omlettes etc and everything is decent in terms of pricing and quantity. They don't put any salt and pepper in their omlettes but give them to you on the side so don't forget to dish it out of your bag and sprinkle some before eating.
2016-02-17,2,The BEST breakfast burritos in all of Hoboken.  the WORSE customer service in all of Hoboken. I can't believe how rude the cashier with the hat is.   Had a mishap with order and ticket numbers this weekend.  Instead of trying to help me she was annoyed with me and didn't even offer an apology.  She even began to talk about me in Spanish to her coworkers when i had to let her know (in Spanish) I was able to understand what she was saying about me.  Work on customer service... even if you are busy there is not excuse to make your customers feel like they're imposing on your business.
2016-01-22,5,Hands-down the best bagels in town. Despite the crowd they draw, they never seem to miss a detail on my order which changes frequently because the menus features so many options. My girlfriend lives in the city and never misses an opportunity to order when visiting, apparently Manhattan bagels have nothing on JPs.
2015-12-18,3,Been to this Bagel shop a couple of times now and they've been pretty consistent on their offerings. Had an everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. The bagels were a little undercooked for my liking and the cream cheese was okay. Worth a look.
2015-12-16,3,Located just a couple blocks from the Hoboken Terminal, this has become my go-to bagel shop on the weekdays.The menu is pretty extensive, but really I just stick to breakfast sandwiches and bagels. And they do it fairly well. Bacon, egg, and cheese has sufficient substance to it and the bagels themselves are very good. The place itself is tight and in the mornings quite crowded but step past the people standing around and step up to the counter to place your order. Taking things to go is the best choice here since there is only seating for about half a dozen. Overall, not too bad for a quick stop-in but not a place to go hang out.
2015-11-05,3,Best bagel in Hoboken, but definitely not the best bagel I've ever had.Saturday mornings, everything bagel with chive cream cheese is a regular for me. Coffee isn't very good, but there's a Starbucks right across the street. Place gets SUPER crowded and busy so make sure you check how much they ring you up for your order. Sometimes I'll order the same thing on different days and I'd be charged differently... I feel like sometimes they just arbitrarily hit the register...
2015-10-16,4,A Hoboken staple, they have basically the best bagels in town, aside from Hoboken Hot Bagels. They recently renovated their interior, and the old reviews calling it dumpy aren't right at all. They get extremely busy on the weekend, pro-tip - call your order in first then go there and pick it up to avoid any lines.
2015-10-12,5,LOVE JP's Bagels, whole wheat everything is so good.
2015-09-15,3,Great location- just about a block away from the path. Not sure if I'd go as far as saying they have the best bagels (might have to give that one to Hoboken Hot Bagels), but they're definitely the go to spot for breakfast sandwiches. Lines are crazy on the weekends but they make up for it with their service. You'll probably wait almost 10 minutes.
2015-09-10,5,yum bagel sandwich! I brought a dozen hoem to LA to freeze. They are still good as I make my bagel sandwiches at home. I love that they offer avocado on your bagel sandwich over here- didn't know that was as much of a thing as it is on the west coast. I liked the garlic and onion bagels the most and got mine with egg, cream cheese, avo, and cheddar cheese.
2015-08-05,5,By far the best bagel place in Hoboken! It gets crowded on the weekends but it is worth the wait! Bagels are fluffy and the cream cheese is awesome! Always a great selection :)
2015-06-04,5,Best bagel place I've had in Hoboken, always get the everything bagel with sliced lox and cream cheese and red onions, they have other stuff other then gavels, which is delicious too! Lately I saw rainbow looking bagel kinda want to try lol
2015-05-30,4,Love this place...no pre-made eggs like that place on Washington. Their egg and cheese bagels are wonderful too.Not the friendliest people in the world. Even when it's empty they don't really speak..but the food is good.
2015-05-25,4,I'm honestly surprised by the many 1 and 2 star reviews for this place.  Every time I go in (which is pretty regularly, less since I moved further away, but still..) the place is packed, and the service, while not what I would call friendly, is pretty damn efficient for the amount of madness happening there.  I've never gotten a wrong order, and my orders are pretty specific as I have to have dairy free options, so I've never gotten cheese when I didn't ask for it, or gotten someone else's order by mistake, or anything like that.Their bagels are not my absolute favorite, but they are probably in my top 5, so a good NY style bagel.  I think they could be a little fluffier but that's just the way I like a bagel.Not the fanciest in here by any means, but I am consistently satisfied with their service and food, and it remains one of my bagel go-to spots.
2015-05-21,2,This place has gotten good reviews so I'll try it again. I had a pumpernickel with cream cheese with tomato and cucumbers. The bagel was a little hard. I didn't think I got a whole lotta cc as someone else's review said they give plenty...It was meh. But, I'll try it again before I give up.
2015-03-28,3,I've only gotten bagels here and they're pretty good! They have a wide variety and they're always fresh.. The coffee is so-so .. Like a bodega coffee .. Nothing too great. Their menu looks extensive though so I will try to come back for something different next time.
2015-03-08,1,I would have given NO stars if Yelp allowed - I HAD to give 1 in-order to write this review. We had to wait 2.5 hours for our delivery. JP's lied to us, blamed it on the delivery guy + told us he got lost. Additionally, they got our order wrong, the bagels were cold + soggy. I will never order from here again. Please trust us. You will regret it if you choose to order from here after reading this.
2015-03-07,4,Great bagels in Hoboken. Have a good package deal if you want to pick up for a group event - includes bagels, cream cheese and butter - plus you can always add additional spreads. Love both the lox spread and the scallion cream cheese ... Always a hit at my office as well. They have great sandwiches, wraps and hot food as well!!They have a very good system during busy times. You place your order get a number and when you're number is called you can pick up your order and pay.
2015-03-03,2,Stopped by a bit late in the afternoon for a quick bite to eat before having to go to a doctor.  Figured I needed some food and JP's bagel was right around the corner.  We looked at Taco Truck and Gray's Papaya and was like, the bagel should be better on our systems before getting some shots.  We walked in and a guy was mopping the floor and decided not to stop as we wanted to get by.  We did ask if the place was still open and he said yes and then continued to mop all over us.We still continued (truth be told, my boots could have used that little shine from the salt outside).  Went up to the counter where 5 people were standing there sorting stuff out, there was only 6 or 7 bagels left but we didn't hold that against them since it was 3:30 PM in the afternoon on a Saturday.  Getting one of the staff's attention was a pain.  They all looked at each other when I asked if I could still order a sandwich and after about 30 seconds of confusion the guy who speaks the least amount of English took my order.We tried a Roasted Turkey Sandwich with a toasted jalapeno bagel.  Overall it was pretty good.  The bread has a slight bite on the outside but is chewy on the inside.  The turkey and toppings all seemed fresh.  It cost about $7.00, but not a bad deal for their location. However, I kept my eye on the staff and most were just standing around letting 2 of the male ethnic workers do most of the work.  I thought I might have invaded on closing time but they stay open until 5:00 PM so no reason to treat us like we were invading on their time.If I am craving a bagel sandwich again, I'd rather just stay hungry and go get a Wonder Bagels where quality and service meet.
2015-03-03,4,Such a quintessential bagel shop. Only in NY/NYC area will you find quality such as this!
2015-02-22,5,When I first started coming to JP's a couple of years ago, I thought the bagels were just ok. But as time went on, they seemed to have greatly improved in quality.My favorite bagel here is the whole wheat, which maybe one of the best whole wheat bagels I've had anywhere. They are generous with the cream cheese and the order comes out fairly fast even on the very crowded weekend mornings.I can't speak for any of their other food, but if you want a good bagel with cream cheese, this is the place.
2015-02-21,3,Stopped here for a bagel while in the middle of Saturday errands. The service was quick and, despite the long line, I ordered quickly and was served quickly. The menu is extensive - way more than just bagels. However I just went with a buttered and toasted blueberry bagel. The bagel was decent but I was kind of expecting more from a local NJ bagel shop.
2015-01-28,2,Great bagels...but horrendous service and inconsistent prices. It's honestly as if they don't listen to you when ordering, because they always forget cheese, or add cheese or forget tomatoes...then charge you extra for whatever they felt like adding-on or have forgotten.Been going to this place for over 4 yrs because the bagels are the best in Hobo. But no more- boom! Rotten review.
2015-01-26,1,Unfortunately I have not once out of 7 times got the correct order here.  I started even buying an extra cream cheese on the side because they barely give me any when I requested extra. On top of that I have also not gotten the correct order or bagel so by the time I get home I don't want to go back and return again. So basically I am always disappointed and overcharged somehow. If you like having them pick what they want to serve you, rather than get what you want, then this is the place for you.
2014-11-16,4,Best bagels in Hoboken without a doubt. The smashery and hoboken hot bagels serve their sandwiches with an egg patty and microwave their sandwiches, JPs is drastically better than both of them
2014-11-09,4,Indisputably the best bagels in Hoboken. Everything and jalapeno are my favorite. Whole wheat everything is solid too, but if you're gonna eat a bagel, eat a bagel, ya know?!Their egg sandwiches are pretty stellar - they make the eggs fresh, not like the preheated patty garbage that you'll find at Smashery. I generally stick to those egg and cheese on a bagel or a buttered toasted bagel for breakfast, but I've gotten a bagel sandwich with tuna a few times and that's been awesome too. They don't charge extra to add tomato, onions and lettuce to the bagel sandwiches, which is a plus.The service is always great. They're polite enough and super efficient. When things get crazy (read: weekend mornings) they hand out numbers to easily distribute orders. I've never waited longer than 6 or 7 minutes.Bonus: this is the closest hangover cure stop to the Path and NJ transit, so there are always hungover and still drunk girls doing the walk of shame for your entertainment on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Enjoy :).
2014-11-07,4,I was surprised to see the reviews, as I come here at least once a week and love the bagels. They are the best in hoboken and some of the best that I've had in the NYC area. I have tried the egg and cheese bagels, which are good, but I prefer a sesame bagel with cream cheese. The cream cheese always tastes fresh and I love when I can get the bagels when they are still warm. Yum :)
2014-10-19,4,They have great bagel sandwiches. I usually order a sausage, egg, and cheese on a jalapeño bagel. Service is generally fast, although they can get crowded on weekend mornings. This is definitely my go-to bagel place.
2014-09-20,4,Bagels are fresh, service is fast, overall good bagel spot. Got the fresh squeezed orange juice and was disappointed with it. Coffee was decent. Bagel with egg and cheese was four stars. Bagel with scallion cream cheese was three stars. Final rating: 3.5 rounded up to 4.
2014-09-02,2,Eh, it's nothing special. The people are nice enough, $2.40 got me a decent bagel with peanut butter. Fine in a grab and go setting but I probably won't try again. The amount of peanut better was also lacking.
2014-07-10,4,Great breakfast sandwiches, but be prepared to wait in line.  Also, a tad pricey for what you get.  If you want coffee and a sandwich, be prepared to spend ~$10...
2014-06-30,4,I am from Upstate New York and I was staying in New Jersey for the weekend. All I am ever told is to have City or Jersey bagel because they are the best. I was a little skeptical walking in there as it did look a little grimey. However, growing up in a small town, I have learned that the little shops like this one are the best ones. WE call them a hole in the wall where I am from. And let me tell you, I would recommend JPs Bagel Express to everyone and anyone. I thought they were decently priced and WOW WERE THEY DELICIOUS!I went with an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. The veggie cream cheese was home made with chunks of veggies! I wanted to go back for more after I finished mine. I could have kept eating them all day. The next time I make a trip down there and I am going to make a special trip to JPs.
2014-06-07,3,We stopped in on our way back to the Light Rail. It's a small place, just enough room to order, get your food and go. We had a ham & cheese, a tuna and a pastrami, on bagels. There are a limited number of places to sit, inside and outside. The service was great and our order came quickly. We'll be stopping by again, but ordering to go.
2014-05-27,4,I've only had one bagel from JP's so far, but let me tell you, I was craving a good bagel and I got one here.  I didn't ask for the cinnamon raisin bagel to be toasted, and it was perfectly fresh.  I asked for cream cheese - there was the perfect amount.  For $2.50 I was content.  It's simple as that, folks.  If you're looking for a simple breakfast (or lunch, as it looks like theirs might be good) then you should try this place out.
2014-05-24,2,We stopped by here this morning because we were hanging out in downtown Hoboken. Got some coffee from Bean Vault but wanted a more substantial breakfast. They present their bagels well so I had pretty high expectations as I walked in. I got an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. The cream cheese was pretty good -- the veggies were nice and chunky which is how I like my veggie cream cheese. Unfortunately the bagel itself was fairly mediocre, just a notch above a good grocery store bagel. The texture of the bagel was just not right -- not chewy enough.Hoboken Hot Bagels is still the best bagel in town.
2014-05-03,4,my go to for a scooped out bagel (Black Russian and sundried tomato are my favorite) with whitefish salad. they actually also have decent omlets. pretty standard nj bagel place. nothing outrageously good or bad. this place will satisfy a craving though. weekends are packed!
2014-04-23,1,OK, I've said it before and I'll say it again. If you know me as a person you probably know a few things about me at minimum. I'm an intensely honest person and I'm pretty easy going most of the time. I avoid confrontation under most circumstances unless I'm protesting for a cause I believe in or if someone is dishonest or hurts myself or someone close to me. Why do I write this? Stick with me folks, it brings me to this bagel shop. A few weeks back, I bought a sausage, egg white and cheese sandwich. This is my usual order and is the reason I'm the "Duke". All seemed to go well, it went off without a hitch like any other morning. Three days later, I went back in and was asked if I was asked if I was a regular in the usual business attire I wear to work. I responded in the affirmative, as truths are truths. The lady then tried to charge me for my sandwich on my new card saying my old card didn't go through! Are you kidding me? Nice try JPs. I've worked retail. I know how these machines work. Either they work...or they don't. My card either went through (I was told of the cancellation later that day) or it didn't. If it didn't, proper protocol is to ask for another card on the spot.At the end of the day, it's five bucks. It's the way this store does business which leads me to never want to visit again.
2014-03-19,3,Ordering at this place is kind of a hassle. Stand around and wait for your order along with the other people. No place to sit really, so it's mostly take-out. My husband and I just bout our bagels to go and ate at the W, where we were staying. Not the greatest bagel but not the worst. It's just like the rating says "Ok."
2014-03-02,2,The perk here is the taste of the bagel, which I will agree is very solid and better than most other Hoboken options. But, the service, omg. It's a complete circus in the mornings. There's no formal line, but rather a massive cluster of people with zero sequence or understanding of who's next to order. Then, when the food is finally ready, the lady just starts screaming the order over and over until someone makes their way to the front. It's overpriced too. But the main issue here is the ordering process. They lucked out with their location, because if not for that, they would do 70% less business. I stopped going here because I couldn't stand the constant yelling and confusion. Get it fixed ... seems pretty simple to maybe hand out a number, in lieu of blaring BACON EGG CHEESE HOT SAUCE KETCHUP ON TOASTED EVERYTHING. "Number 58 is ready" seems more logical.
2014-02-09,3,This place is not far from the terminal which is what causes the madness in the morning. It slows down in the afternoons. I usually stop by if I need something quick before my commute to school. They have a lot of options available but I either go for breakfast sandwiches (bagel, egg, taylor ham) or for the roast beef sandwiches. The breakfast sandwiches are pricier than Hoboken Hot Bagels. They minimial seating--like a table or 2 so most people take everything to go. The staff is friendly.
2014-02-04,2,The bagel itself was fine, bordering on eh? I don't know about this place, I couldn't see past a few things.First off, the place looks super dumpy and dirty. I don't like to jump to conclusion, but it makes me sceptic about how sanitary this place can really be.Second, I ordered up a low fat chicken salad with lettuce, tomato, turkey bacon on a low carb bagel. It was $9 and IT WAS GROSS. Like I took two bites and threw it away gross. Like I didn't even want to complain to management because I didn't want anything else gross. The chicken salad was seriously disgusting, stuffed with peas and a gelatinous mystery texture. The turkey bacon was barely cooked, the whole thing was soggy. I can pretty much eat anything in front of me and I had no problem or remorse throwing this thing away.If you are craving a bagel and really have no where else to go, I'd imagine this could be it, but seriously Taco Truck and Gray's Papaya are wayyyyyy better options, I'd even suggest hitting up Starbucks for grub before heading here.
2014-02-02,4,JP's Bagel Express is my favorite local bagel stomp in Hoboken. These bagels are made in-house and you can taste it. Close enough to the PATH station that makes this place close to wherever you want to go. Great selection of bagels - I'm a fan of Whole Wheat Everything with veggie cream cheese. The New York-style coffee isn't bad either for $1.30. One piece of constructive feedback: even a busy slew of people is not an excuse for a lack of cream cheese. Need to layer that schmear on!
2014-01-31,3,This is totally weird but I've literally worked right next to this place for a year and I've only been here like 3 times. Idk why. It's really strahnj (make sure you pronounce that exactly how it's spelled). I'm just never drawn in really. Also my breakfast usually consists of a latte (& nothing else) and I have Starbucks for that. Or Mod Cup (if they hadn't deserted me). When I have been in, the service is quick and friendly. The bagels are fresh and the butter is melted. Can't ask for much more in the world of bagels. I've had the plain bagel and the blueberry. Both yummy. I should go here more often!
2014-01-08,1,Every time I walk out of here with a sandwich, I vow to never come back again. This time, I'm making it stick.Did you know they charge .75 if you want a slice of tomato on something? It's RIDICULOUS. And I'm talking a thin slice of usually soggy tomato.I knew that walking in this time and got my typical sandwich anyway only to be hit with a charge a dollar more than what I'm used to paying. I try to tell the guy I never pay this much and he gives me some crap about the tomatoes.The staff here has an attitude, they're sloppy on the job and don't even produce very good food. It's called CUSTOMER SERVICE - learn how to treat your customers AHOLE.Oh, and in the summer, be sure to look for all the flies caught inside the bagel case. Avoid or go at your own risk. There are plenty of better, cleaner, friendlier establishments within a 4-block radius.
2014-01-07,5,I want to make sweet sweet love to these bagels. While I tend to stick with everything bagels and lox cream cheese, I must say I am blown away by my husbands choice every time, everything with scallion. There is always a line on the weekends but it moves very quickly. I have had and enjoy many of the well known bagel places in the city but heading to JP's in Hoboken  is my absolute favorite.
2013-12-22,1,Got bagels here every weekend. Today's order consisted of an everything bagel with scallion cream cheese and bacon and a whole wheat everything with lox cream cheese. Nothing difficult or out of the ordinary. Got the bagels home to notice there was no cream cheese on either bagel. Called the store, their response, next time check before you leave. Time to go to Hoboken Hot Bagels.
2013-12-10,2,I live right next to JP's and always call in my bagel breakfast sandwiches for pick up.  Overall, the ingredients are some of the best in downtown Hoboken, however the service leaves something to be desired. They never toast their bagels normally and even when you ask for it toasted they only do it 75% of the time.  If you want anything other than very basic ingredients you're better off going there and telling them in person because they'll mess it up if you don't.  I'd really love to give this place better reviews but I can't, strictly because the workers there just don't listen.
2013-11-25,4,Favorite bagel spot in Hoboken. Wide selection & really tasty bagels. I even really enjoy their egg and cheese and that's not usually my go-to order. Quick service! $10 minimum for cards though.
2013-11-13,3,Ehhh overrated... Everything bagel should be callled a plain bagel with a slight dusting of everything.  The ham was overly browned and just kind of meh.  Not bad but not amazing.  The bagels are HUGE and good chewy to fluffy ratio.  They have a good variety of cream cheese and selection of bagels.  I would go here but it wouldnt be my choice to come here.  If you are into everything bagels with not everything on it... you will enjoy it, if you are like me - you'll be disappointed =/*Enjoy!
2013-09-27,5,This place is one of my favorite bagels places in New Jersey. It's makes its bagels in house, and has very quick and friendly service. The location is also perfect as you can quickly grab and go if you're walking to the Hoboken Path Station. They have a wide selection and the bagels are absolutely delicious. Definitely check this place out!
2013-07-02,3,Eh. They're the best bagels I've found in Hoboken, but that's really not saying much.Also, unlike every other bagel place I've ever been to, you have to specify that you want your schmear toasted. Otherwise, they'll give you a cold bagel with cream cheese, which no one would ever want.
2013-05-11,5,I own Dina's Kiss & Makeup across the street and I can always rely on this place for a good, quick bite at a great price :)
2013-04-08,1,Called up this morning to order breakfast. First thing the guy says is $10 minimum. Ok understandable. My order came out to $9 total so I ordered a coffee to make it $10. He said no ma'am it was has to be $10. I asked the guy how much is a coffee then? He said $1.30. And refused to deliver my order which would've come out to $10.30 He then put me on the phone with the most arrogant woman I have ever encountered. And she jumped up the $10 minimum to $13 and then to $15 the longer you stayed on the phone with her. We've ordered from them in the past for just 1 bagel and they delivered it no problem. But since they were short handed today they said they would have to charge us a $15 minimum. That's completely idiotic. They have the worst customer service.and one other thing.. MY COWORKER FOUND QUARTERS IN HER OMELET.
2013-04-05,4,They very often offer mashed potatoes plus something for lunch, so of course I come here! And the vegetables have never been overcooked. And once I hade a wrap, I asked for a spicy one and went for the woman's suggestion and was quite happy with it. Plus staff is always very nice.
2013-03-04,4,Back before I had to cut all wheat, and gluten and grain products from my life...I had a love affair with all delis in the morning. My standard go to on the weekends was turkey, egg whites, pepper jack cheese, and hot sauce on a kaiser roll. Let me tell you, they do it really well here. It's probably one of the best breakfast sandwiches ever.Sure, it gets mobbed. But it's so close to the Path...so anyone going into or out of the city is likely to pass this place. (DD is closer, but their bagels are booty.) The staff is super friendly too...and one is always wearing a Penn State cap, so I can't complain really.They also have different kinds of bagels than your standard plain, raisin, everything, salt and poppy seed. They have oat bran, whole wheat everything, cheese, blueberry, pumpernickel...a really nice selection.I think my sandwich ended up being $3-$4 (this was around this time last year I used to visit when I worked nearly every Saturday for a few months).
2013-02-05,3,I think its the best bagel shop in Hobo.  They actually cook their eggs on a flat top, and not in a microwave. You go here if you want a breakfast sandwich or a bagel, possibly something for lunch.  The service is alright, nothing to brag about but its a high volume operation so you're in, and you're out...  When you walk in, walk to the counter and order, then get the hell out of the way...  Pay once you receive your goods.  They forget the S/P/K all of the time on my sandwiches.  But they are still really good.  Give it a shot, you'll like it!
2013-01-28,3,I bought an Italian sandwich and a sesame bagel at JP's. The sandwich was my lunch, and the bagel was my dinner on the bus. I have to say the sandwich was disappointing--the meats were more bland than I wanted, without the salty, spicy goodness that's in the best Italian subs. The hot peppers also didn't pack much of a kick. The bagel, on the other hand, was crispy/chewy and delicious, even hours later.The ordering and waiting process at JP's is nerve-wracking. The tiny storefront gets incredibly crowded, and there's some chaos as people push through the crowd to order or get food. It's also confusing that you pay when you pick up your food, instead of when you order it.If I go back, it will be for the bagels.$10 minimum on credit cards.
2013-01-07,4,Light and fresh bagels.  Decent egg, ham and cheese breakfast sandwich.  Coffee's ok.  There are other choices in Hoboken for good coffee.
2013-01-05,5,For $2.40 you can have a life changing moment with a toasted whole wheat everything bagel with cream cheese. Boom. end review.
2012-12-09,3,Downgrading to 3 stars after they have forgotten to put the ketchup/hot sauce on 3 of my past 5 orders there. Seems small, but I mean, it's part of the sandwich and it is being left out!
2012-12-02,5,Don't walk any further south or you may accidentally stumble into Bagel Smashery and then well, you're going to be in deep shit.This is hte best bagel in Hoboken and maybe even the Tri-State area and that's coming from a Jew who eats a shit load of bagels.Great service, egg sammys are awesome - cream chese is amazing, very solid all around.Every Friday I bring these in for my co-workers - everyone goes ape shit - love 'em...Enjoy it Hobokentown.
2012-11-21,4,Great bustling breakfast spot with a wide range of bagels on offer. My favorite by far is the whole wheat everything bagel. Try ordering it toasted with egg salad and cheddar. The egg salad is chunky and the bagels are thick so I end up eating it all open face style. The pan au chocolate and raspberry cream cheese croissants are buttery, flaky, and will melt in your mouth! Cut fruit cups and yogurt are also available.
2012-10-25,4,Actually,  I really liked this bagel. It had plenty of topping, was fresh, and was pretty chewy. (The bagels in nyc are super chewy, why don't they make them like that across the river? What's up with that?) Anywho,  this place is pretty decent for a jersey place. This will officially be my bagel place.
2012-10-14,1,The food is not too bad but we are a local business in the area and we order from JP's daily, alot of the times getting the same food and its always different prices.  Just today my co-worker and I got two bagels with bacon egg and cheese, this is usually $5 maybe $5.50 each, today it was $15.07???  We argued with the delivery guy but he doesnt know anything.  So we realized that the receipt he was showing us as proof was printed at 9:41am when we didnt order till 10:20am.  My co-worker walked down there (which isnt far) only to be told by the woman cashier (who cheats people all the time, watch out for her) she charges whatever she wants.  He politely asks her to explain the bill and what was different this time (they also messed up his order another constant thing JP's is known for.) and she starts yelling at him "this is what it is!!!" he explains that this isnt normally what we pay (more irritated now, who wouldnt be?) and she says to get out of her store.  In the end its our fault for ordering out of sheer convienence and not common sence because the only thing that remains a constant is very very poor customer service.
2012-10-08,4,Tough swimming coming in here early on the morning. The line builds up quick because everyone wants their bagel and coffee.But who can blame them? This is one of the best spots in town to grab your breakfast meal. It's close to the PATH train and right on route for just about the majority of us. There's better places to be had in Manhattan in comparison, but when we're talking Hoboken and Hoboken alone, I've found this place to be my breakfast of choice most days. I don't like waiting through the train ride to get my meal anyway.I've never been let down by their work. I've only gotten cream cheese bagels and bacon egg & cheese bagels - bagels aren't cardboard at all, they're quite fluffy and scrumptious. My one pet peeve is they suck at cutting the bagels in half. I hate fighting with it when I'm starving and just trying to get started with one side of the sandwich.Nowhere to sit inside (there's a couple seats by the window, good luck), they have seating outside but when the cold starts to pick up they become vacant for good reason. It's a place to grab your bagel and dash.
2012-09-04,4,This Bagel place is the best I have encountered in Hoboken so far. They have a wide assortment of bagels and spreads, and they make breakfast sandwiches and several other hot options as well. I got my standard toasted blueberry bagel with strawberry cream cheese (sacrilegious, I know) and was thoroughly satisfied with what JP bagels delivered. The bagel was justified; not a piece of cardboard like you find outside the east coast, and even in parts of New Jersey. The cream cheese was good, though I would have preferred a little more. The service time was average; not fast but not too slow - I was there when it wasn't busy however, so I don't know if it's a convenient stop before a commute. The only thing I have to complain about is the $10 credit card minimum. This is the New York Metro Area; I don't carry cash, nor do many other people living in the 21st century. Also, credit card minimums are technically illegal... just sayin.
2012-09-02,3,Hoboken has few decent bagel places so that's why I'm a bit torn on this review. Here is a place that comes close to above average yet falls just short. I'm sure they do a lot of business here with the location being so close to the Path station and ferry. A decent place to get a quick bagel on the go. Couple of tables but no bathroom. I got an everything bagel with regular cream cheese and it was more like a "barely anything" bagel. They skimped on the toppings. For some strange reason they put oatmeal flakes as one of the everything bagel toppings. I've never seen that before. If they were more generous with the toppings this place would really be something. It's a shame because the bagel was warm, soft, and fresh. If they put a little more effort in presentation or maybe added more of a variety of cream cheeses, this shop could have potential to rival the one other good place in Hoboken, Hoboken Hot Bagels.If you have a train or ferry to catch and don't want to walk the extra steps, then I guess this place is for you. For now, you just have to put this place in the "just ok" category.
2012-06-18,4,Excellent, plump, doughy bagels.  My fave is simple:  plain bagel, lightly toasted with lox spread.  I haven't had any of the bagel sandwiches yet, but I may have one on my next visit.  Expect a 'Check-in' tomorrow morning.
2012-05-14,4,THE BAGELS HERE ARE AWESOME...but be prepared to wait in line and perhaps sometimes get the wrong order...still worth it tho
2012-05-02,1,I'm being nice by giving this place 1 star.  The lady is rude.  They charge extra for everything.  I just ordered a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese.  They forgot the egg.  Not worth It.  Walk the extra 8 blocks to Bagels on the Hudson at 8th and Washington
2012-04-26,1,I ordered a grill chicken caesar on a spinach wrap and I got a grill chicken caeser on a wheat wrap (and surprisingly) with croutons. It was probably the worst wrap I ever had. Too much caesar dressing. And the croutons. I never heard of croutons in a wrap. There was more croutons than chicken. And lets not forget the wheat wrap. I wanted a spinach wrap. I mean not having what I wanted really messed up my lunch. Not a fan.
2012-04-08,3,Solid bagels in a town where, surprisingly, there are a lot of sub-par bagel places.  JP's is the best bagel place in Hoboken, but that's not saying much.  The bagels in Brooklyn and Manhattan are much better.  Unfortunately, if you live in downtown Hoboken, you're stuck with JP's (which isn't necessarily a bad thing).  Someone at JP's should wake up and stop charging $1.00 per bagel.  Oh, and don't buy cream cheese here, unless you want to pay out the nose.This review is a lot more negative than I anticipated.  If the bagels weren't good, I would have given 2 stars, at most.
2012-03-11,4,This place it packed and busy on a Saturday morning, with good reason.  Incredibly fluffy but chewy super huge bagels, slightly warm from being freshly made.  On my ham egg and cheese, they packed on the fillings without reserve.  The staff isn't the friendliest or most attentive...then again, they're dealing with a large influx of indecisive, hungover yuppies.  Regardless, I enjoyed my bagel sandwich with the accompanied people watching.  A good spot that I will put in my Hoboken artillery for future noshing occasions.
2012-02-24,3,Bagels here are good... not great, but they get the job done. The thing that does not get the job done here are the people who work here! They constantly mess up orders... switch which meat goes on which bagel, etc. Shame, because the food itself is one of the better delis in Hoboken.
2012-02-23,5,Truly the best bagel spot in all of Hoboken and nearby areas on this side of the Hudson. JP's is a hidden gem. The bagels are SO FRESH and just to die for. Service is great, and the place is almost always busy with customers, but it moves quick. Been going here every Sunday since I discovered it... and really, it's the BEST.
2012-02-13,4,Tuna fish on an everything bagel is my comfort food... I know, that sounds a little weird, but it's true. After many a tuna fish sandwich from JP's, I'm ready to conclude that these have to be the best bagels in Hoboken.To top it all off, they sell Boar's Head products. I'm sold!I once jumped out of my tuna comfort zone and ordered turkey with mayo. I'll agree with a previous review that something didn't seem right -- maybe warm mayo? -- but that was my one (slightly) unpleasant experience. I'll keep coming back for my tuna on an everything, which has yet to disappoint.
2011-09-20,5,The best bagels in Hoboken. Come early for the best bagels and to miss the hungover crowds from 10-1.
2011-09-07,4,Based on one visit...Made a quick stop here before heading into the city.  Bagels were excellent as were the bagel and egg sandwhiches.  Only two tables outside.
2011-07-20,4,Great Bacon Egg & Cheese Sandwiches. However, they will sometimes charge you a dollar extra if you want onions, lettuce, or tomatoes on your bagel sandwich.  Nevertheless, this is possibly Hoboken's best Bacon Egg & Cheese Sandwiches
2011-06-24,5,Best bagels ever!! My siblings and I stopped in here randomly before a trip into nyc and were totally amazed! These bagels were amazing. We ended up going back two more times during our trip! Delicious breakfast sandwiches too, but it almost seemed wrong to taint their perfection with other food... Mmmm
2011-02-04,5,I love NY bagels (Long Island spoiled me), so I was wondering if I could find something similar here in Hoboken.  Well, I found something pretty close, and it was here at JP's Bagel Express.There is not much seating area inside, but who sits down in these establishments anyway?  This is definitely one of those places where you get in and get out.They have a pretty extensive menu of bagels (cinnamon raisin, plain, oat, whole wheat, etc.), breakfast sandwiches, and other kinds of sandwiches.  They have on display all the bagels you can get, and according to the sign posted on the window, they hand-roll and bake all their bagels.Their cinnamon raisin bagels are delicious.  They're very doughy, and not sickeningly sweet.  I got it with scallion cream cheese at first, but I thought there were a little too many scallion pieces in the cheese, so I just downgraded to plain cream cheese.  The cream cheese here is very good, it's kind of fluffy, and it does not taste like glue (ahem, chain donut place down the street from here)!  Plus, for $2.14, that's the amount of money I was spending on breakfast at work, anyway.$10 minimum on credit card purchases so unless you're buying tons of food, come ready with cash.I try to stop here on my way to the train station in Hoboken every morning, and I usually get my bagel in like under 3 minutes!  Love it!
2011-01-06,4,Best bagel place in Hoboken! Finally a place with whole wheat everything bagels that knows how to make them right!
2010-08-31,2,I really, really want to love this place.AlasIt is one of the only places I can think of in recent memory where I experienced some sort of food poisoning.If I was rating this place on just their bagels, it'd be an easy four star rating. The bagels have been fresh, the service quick and efficient...The downfall I experienced was in a turkey sandwich with mayo. I suspect the mayo in my unpleasant experience. It seemed to be served too warm near other things that were warm. Please, do go here for a cup of coffee and a bagel. The bagels, again, are really good and baked daily.Everything else? Decide how much of a gambler you are.
2008-12-03,2,Basically a larger version of the Bagel Smashery, you walk in and you hope that you're not too slow, or the crowd behind you starts to rumble with hunger and push you out of the way.The step up inside precludes handicapped access, but they generally serve quickly and will step out if they notice you can't get up the step.Delivery has a minimum $10 order, but they are open very early, to early evenings.  Some random deli selections, too, but really, not something I'd go out of my way for.
