2021-06-21,5,Small hole in the wall but my go to place for casual drinks and watching some sports. They all have one pool table. The bartenders are all very friendly and attentive. They stay open late and it's great vibes!
2021-05-19,1,We walk in and there's 4 open seats at the bar, they have nearly empty glasses at them and some empty shot glasses, looks like no one has been there for a while so me and a friend sit down. Bartender comes over eventually and as we start looking at the beers to decide all of the sudden she goes "you know someone's sitting there right"  very aggressively, we both very apologetically start to get up and she goes "do you not see those glasses in front of you" in a tone I'd never expect from anyone. We continue standing up speechless at this point and she calls us pendejos which I don't need to speak Spanish to know what it means. so we say "alright we're leaving" and she's like "yeah get out"We were there for no more than two minutes completely sober. Still have no clue what happened but I've never felt more disrespected
2020-08-20,5,A delightful experience visiting this long-standing historic bar. The staff is warm and welcoming and the prices are very reasonable they have been before Covid and they have maintained their integrity despite hardships. Anthony the proprietor, is always there offering a warm welcome to patrons along with his smile and good nature that resonates back to times before his family bought the place. Highly recommend paying a visit to L&J's for great drinks, service and fantastic people watching in the heart of Hoboken.
2020-07-18,1,Horrible service, waiting 30 min for waitress to acknowledge us. Paid completely no attention to us in a place with 6 tables that can service a max of maybe 20 people. Never coming back.
2020-01-21,2,Location is awesome and was surprised it's empty on Thursday.. which is not herd of in Hoboken. I think it's due to the fact that the bartenders are not that involved. The bar table needs to be cleaned as I saw a couple of flies near the bar tap. This place definitely needs a kitchen though.great place for regular visitors though they do have fun and much deserved attention but they hardly number 2-4 people max
2019-09-29,1,On Sunday 9/29 I stopped in around 5 to watch some football. There was a street fair going on in hoboken so I thought it would be hard to get a seat. When I walked in there was one group of patrons who were definitely over served. There was one other guy at the end of the bar who could not stand up. We sat down to an empty bar and there was a half eaten pretzel next to me and I asked the red headed bartender if she could throw it out. 10 minutes later she threw it away. The real reason I left was because she had WWE on the tv with sound and when I asked her to change it to football she told me she needed a few minutes. I waited about 10 minutes and then she asked me what channel to put on. I informed her of the 3 different games on tv but told her I didn't know what channel. She made the slightest effort to look for one of the games and then proceeded to tell me she couldn't turn the sound off of the WWE. Basically, run away from this place. There are so many bars in Hoboken with competent bartenders and better environments to spend your money.
2019-01-14,5,HOBOKEN: we love North Jersey, but find we're not there as much as we'd like to be! This changed when we went bar hopping in Hoboken with Brie! Our first stop was at Louise & Jerry's, a tavern right on the happening Washington Street, and they are always pet friendly indoors! They have a full bar and no food, but you can order in food from the many restaurants in the area. Most of the seats are at the bar, but there are a couple of tables in the back by the pool table. It was a low-key and fun way to get our day started in this cool town!They even host events supporting the Liberty Humane Society so check their events tab for yappy hour! Great way to socialize the pups!
2018-09-26,4,Had a dog with us, and with a little research found out this bar is one of the places where you can bring one inside. Standard interior - stools alongside the bar, a couple tables up front at the corners, and a big pool table in the back.Moderate draft list and a few more options in bottle/cans. Prices are around $5-7 depending on what you get (obviously more for cocktails/wine). Atmosphere was pretty chill all night, we got a table to ourselves up front and never felt crowded. Only one bartender working the place and surprisingly that was all that was necessary. No food to speak of here, but I don't think they'd mind if you brought some.Standard bar overall, a bump up for letting us bring the pooch.
2018-05-08,2,Your average small bar. Pool table that's always busy. Tiny one stall bathroom with a line. Unfriendly female bartender ignored me for a while as I patiently waited to order a drink and was not knowledgeable or helpful about beers at all. They also will not give you quarters from your card for the pool table - cash only. Rudely ignored by a customer who I asked if we could play pool or have next.
2018-03-22,5,Im liking louis and jerry already. Last time i was here was watching a band play in 2010. It hasnt changed but its a mellow environment your typical dive bar. I love how its close to work so for thirsty Thursdays! Yay
2017-12-21,5,Best martinis in Hoboken delivered by the one and only Kim! She is an amazing, kind and respectable server. Loved her she really made the experience special.
2017-09-10,3,Not your typical dive bar for Hoboken.The bartender is nice and the regulars are mostly welcoming.  The last time I was there, I felt as though I was in the minority for not being an NRA enthusiast.  Not sure if that's the norm, but that was the vibe when I was there.Generally, it's a decent spot.
2017-06-14,4,Fun quiet little hid away!! Enjoyed the people here! Drinks are cold and service is great! A definite go to over again and again!
2017-05-27,4,Great place with the sound of pool playing in the background, something soothing about that.  I wouldn't exactly call it a dive bar.  It's actually clean but has a dive bar feel.  I would def come back!...and I def will!
2017-02-21,5,Small and divey without being an actual dive. Great bar tenders with great personalities. Izzy was serving me and she was incredibly attentive and nice.Low key for hoboken and not quite as annoying as hoboken can usually be.
2017-01-17,5,Love this Bar, great staff,pool table and way more down to Earth then the other club-like superficial bars around the area.
2016-09-22,5,This place fucking sucks. And by sucks, I mean is quite awesome. Patrons are mostly angry drunks, lost souls and Manhattan's rejects.  They play the most depressing music (The Smiths, Nirvana, etc.)  and old Shirley Temple movies on black and white TV. I've never met a single person in this place that I'd consider a respectable human being. Yet I keep coming back. If New Jersey had a soundtrack and smell, it would be L&J's. Any way you cut it, it's Hoboken's only dive bar.
2016-07-31,5,I went on a Saturday late afternoon and the atmosphere was great. Excellent drink prices.
2016-06-15,4,Pretty decent place. Neither too loud nor too showy. It's a great place if you just want to sit and enjoy a beer with a buddy minus the loud music and food and not being disturbed by people. The place is small and neat with a pool table at the end of the room. The bartender is nice and friendly and is not too talkative or pushy. A very comfortable experience. There is no kitchen but are nice enough to let you order in or get food from outside. They have a great selection of beers and it's pretty reasonable for the Hoboken area. I would suggest to go to this place if all you want to do is just sitting by the bar and getting a drink without too much of pomp and show.
2016-05-31,4,Good place, divey, but bartender knew how to make a new fashioned (as opposed to old).  Felt a little cramped and narrow, but maybe that was because it's a slightly underground (just a few steps).  Patrons were interesting bunch, not usual boken bros, so that was good and not so good.
2016-01-06,3,Nice divey spot with some pretty typical drink specials. Took about 10 minutes to get the attention of a bartender on a weekend night. For some reason I ordered a double and kept getting poured singles, no matter how I explained it. The downside of the atmosphere is how narrow the place is. You can fit probably two people between the bar and the wall, and if you sit in the only area with space (by the pool table) you're likely to get jabbed and asked to move frequently for those playing. There can be some funky smells, but that may just have been an unfortunate patron at the bar...
2015-09-06,4,Great place! Nice ambience! Plus point drink price and play billiards..attentive bartender..
2015-08-28,1,Used to drop in for a few drinks once in a while, but I won't be going back after tonight. I sat down at the bar for a beer, and the bartender didn't acknowledge me for 10 minutes. I timed it. After she took my drink order, she went BACK to the same group of people she has just attended to.  I'm pretty sure they were all friends.  I thought this was just ridiculous so I got up and told her "I'll just come back some other time, I waited 10 minutes for a drink and still nothing" - now this was the best part- ready?  She actually said "they were here first, that's why" I once again said "I've been waiting 10,minutes!" Again, the same reply- "They were here first...."  WOW, LIKE REALLY WOW- never going back till you guys fire her, she is TERRIBLE for business.
2015-08-21,3,First time here since reno which was a few years ago I believe.It's not what it used to be. Good vibes still though.
2015-07-30,2,Drinks are okay. They aren't as cheap as the yelp dollar signs suggest. Music is largely garbage and too loud to talk sometimes.
2015-05-31,1,I was at this bar last night. And one of the bartenders (blonde female if I remember correctly) accused me of banging on the bathroom door while she was inside of it. Of course she confused me with someone else but didn't hesitate to approach me in a very aggressive and heated manner. Of course I was standing their shocked and confused but the owner was standing there watching a patron of his bar being verbally attacked by his lunatic employee without saying a word. She was yelling and cursing at me with no regard for the truth or professional etiquette. The lack professionalism and belligerency of the employees at this establishment is appalling.Even after I politely explained that they confused me with someone else and that I was in fact just getting a drink with the other bartender who could vouch for me they proceeded to ask me to leave and kicked me out of their dinky little dive bar.  If the bartenders spent less time being absolutely crazy maybe the service would be better and it wouldn't take 2 hours just to get a drink. Horrible ownership, horrible employees, horrible experience.
2015-05-17,4,L&J pours an A+ GuinnessThey allow dogs which is greatNew wooden bar top and marble shelf on the back wall is nice. Clean and nice overall.Clientele is not my cup of tea... wish they would attract a younger crowd...loses a couple points there. Otherwise, a Hoboken staple that I hope stays around for the long haul (which it has thus far)
2015-02-17,4,This is a great bar if you just looking to hang with some friends and throw back some beers. Service is always great and welcoming. The beers are always ice cold. It sucks they only have the 1 pool table but the crowd is much more laid back as opposed to sone other bars with a club like feel.
2014-12-19,4,We came here for a nightcap after a great birthday dinner next door.  Wow!  I came here a long time ago (1990's?) and was really surprised at how nice the place looked.  Brian, the bartender, was super nice and bought the bday girl her drink, improvised on some grapefruit beers and was very welcoming.  The bar has a nice pool table and a very laid back crowd.  Coming back for sure.
2014-11-13,5,Like Obiwan...this (and maybe Dc's) is Hoboken's last hope. I love this bar, the staff and crowd. Affordable, fun and good music.
2014-11-12,5,This bar is one of my favorites in Hoboken. My only recommendation is to eat before going and then your set.
2014-11-05,4,I walked in to grab a drink here to kill some time while waiting on a friend on a random Wednesday. And I've got to agree with some other reviews in that the music is great.  I enjoy some bumpin music every now and then as much (maybe a bit less) than the next 20 - something,  but this place had Prince, Queen, and Van Morrison.  That's the way to my heart. And they had $2 Bud Heavy and $3 Dales Pale cans during happy hour. Bartender was very nice too. Doesn't hurt that I like dive bars. I will cerainly be back.
2014-10-26,1,Last night we walked in here thinking we would see our original friendly bartenders...but nope they were not there.... And when we were walking out someone thought it would be funny to put on their chalk board..EBOLA FREE ! THAT WAS TASTLESS..INSULTING AND JUST RIGHT OUT STUPID!
2014-10-21,3,Maybe because it's Hoboken that bars like these are rare but it's very similar to rutgers bars and other divey type places around nj. Prices are ok and probably a lot cheaper than nearby bars and there's usually some beer specials (pbr, bud, etc) but nothing special
2014-10-18,4,Possible Draw: great music, pool table, affordable drinks. I don't really do bars, I'm just here to support my alcoholic friends.Possible Drawback: Hipsters. Buckets and buckets of hipsters.
2014-10-06,1,Thankfully, the recent renovation has removed all trace of character or history, & the bar is now safe for today's Hoboken!  The ancient back bar is gone, replaced by a new fiberboard one.  & the removal of the great old jukebox means yuppies are now safe from hearing anything they may be unfamiliar with!
2014-08-25,5,Greatest local bar ever.  Pat, Brian and co are some of the best bartenders this side of the Atlantic.  Keep it up guys.. my only regret is missing Ash spinning some Turbonegro every once in a while!
2014-06-12,1,I rated this place pretty high but I come today and was astonished by lack of professionalism by the bartender. Despite they claim they open by 2am coming at 1.10 I was met by disbelief...the bartender told that I came illegally as the door was closed and ordered me to leave...the door was obviously wide open :) the bartender got extremely rude like she is a god. Rudeness of this girl is beyond any wild guesses...if owner of this place reads this please call me and I will explain why you should fire that girl straightaway!  PS. To the owner..you lost about 15 regulars today...please know how to hire staff...and please contact me if you really want the place still to be popular among Hoboken bars. I am saying the girl at the bar should never be allowed to anything resembling customer service...I am pretty happy to-repeat exactly the same to her face :) please don't ruin the great place, better close it for couple of days than allow the crooks run it! Ps. I will come next week  even if this unprofessional bartender will want me to leave...and we will see what legal grounds she has :)  I was 100 % sober so calling police may be an entertaining option for me.
2014-04-04,4,well yelpers i think i found my new favorite bar in hoboken !! came here yesterday about 4pm, got  a nice cold beer and sat by the window and watched the world go by....very relaxing.....nice old style neighborhood bar, clean , good and friendly svc, pet friendly ( which to 2me is a big plus) and real nice people inside...of course i allways have to start chatting /w someone !!! if you come here check  out the mens toilets...it is the smallest i have ever seen !  you can't stretch your elbows more than 3inches from your side.....funny...they have a juke box and a pool table  along with a nice choice of beer and alcohol.....if you get into hoboken def. chk this one out....i know during the week they open abt. 3pm so don't go too early....
2014-01-12,5,Sometimes you'll be enjoying a good pint or playing $1 pool and some yuppie group opens the door, looks in, and immediately turns around. Best bar in Hoboken. Best JUKEBOX ever. This is a diamond in the rough and if it ever closes Hoboken will be dead.
2013-09-17,5,I moved to Hoboken at the tail-end of its genuinely cool era in '94. Needless to say, I only visit a handful of places there today, L&J's being one of them...I can remember the days when Mary, Louise's sister, used to keep watch and make sure we didn't put our feet up on the upholstered chairs around the pool table...I've known Brian, the sometime bartender, for close to 20 years...YIKES...The place always felt like the basement of our parent's houses...we'd laze away winter afternoons and nights playing pool and having a blast...Well enuff with the reminiscing...Classic dive, friendly bartenders, awesome tunes on the jukebox, good pours on the drinks...a much needed hideaway from the maniacal, chatty chicks with their 6" pumps and MK totes and the lunkhead jocks who drool over them.The iconic Maxwell's is gone...Todd packed up and word has it he's going to set up shop at the Bell House in Brooklyn...If the day ever comes that L&J's closes its doors, Hoboken will truly be a wasteland...I hope that day never comes...
2013-08-14,5,They play awesome music and the bar tender is super nice. Me and my friends went in there and some one sitting at the bar told us the bartender had stepped out and would be right back we said ok and went to the back to play some pool the guy who told us the bar tender had stepped out came back and handed us a bunch of quarters to play pool with and said " here this will keep you busy till he comes back". It was great then when the bartender came back he bought us a beer for making us wait. It was the most comfortable I have felt in a bar in Hoboken. A+
2013-07-18,4,Came here for a drink while I waited for my daughter to get out of work. Was nice and the bartender was very refreshing. If your looking for a dive bar this is the place for you!
2013-05-01,5,On a Saturday Night don't waste your time with any of the Yuppie Scum bars. Just come here, and STAY here. They shut the door at 2am and are secretly open until 3. Great people, bartenders, pool table, juke box, and surprisingly some cute girls on the weekends.
2013-04-20,5,This is a bar.  They serve beer.  They've got a pool table.All compelling reasons to go here, if you want a bar that serves beer.  Mostly, though, you should go because they have a great jukebox.  If you like to drink your Yeungling while listening to Holland 1945 or the Flaming Lips and are near this bar, head on in!Cool place
2013-03-11,3,Nice little dive bar that's great if you're trying to avoid crowds and grab some cheap drinks.Perfect example...came here with a small group during the St. Patrick's day festivities in Hoboken. They were one of the few bars not charging cover, we got a great spot in the window away from the mob, got fast bar service and a front row view of the people stumbling down Washington. Made for an entertaining afternoon.
2013-02-27,5,Arguably my favorite bar in Hoboken.  Great Jukebox and good crowd.    Its a dive so no what to expect, its not fancy, don't expect drunk yappy 21 year old girls nor top 40 music.  Its the kind of place you wanna go to hang out with a neighborhood crowd and not worry about a whole lot.
2013-02-22,4,Great bar! Not the typical douche hive that lines Washington Street. Great music, great prices, and a great staff. It's really all you can ask for from a bar. I wish it was a little bit larger but c'est la vie. Size isn't everything ;)
2012-12-21,3,Lack Craft beers, place is too small even for a group of 4 on a slow night. On the plus side service is wonderful, pool table and nice environment if you want to get away from the crowd
2012-10-29,1,What is going on here?? We go to 3 bars in town... Maxwells, Northern Soul and Louise and Jerrys...now we will only go to 2. Why is my bartender resemble Dina from Jersey Shore,slightly skinnier,and wearing ridiculous spandex. I come here to chill with the other non black bear types and now im stuck with juice heads and juicy couture?? By the way, it took 15 minutes for the bartender to come over... why you ask... she had to talk to her friend about brother ' drama'! When was 'drama' associated with Louise and Jerrys? Give me a buzz when MTV isnt contributing to your salary.
2012-06-07,5,Definitely one of my favorite bars in Hoboken. Great beer (not overpriced), awesome bartenders, music is always great, and you can't go wrong with a dive in bar that has a pool table!
2012-05-29,3,Dark, cozy, great jukebox, cool bartenders, cheap drinks. Pool table in the back is sweet and people are friendly here. Bonus: L&J's is d-bag free!
2012-01-26,4,Always feel at home in this place.  Big comfy couches in the back near the pool table, good music, and the bartenders are awesome.  Can order food to the place which is nice too.  They have a lot of good beers on bottle (Purple Haze!) and other IPA's as well.  Not the typical Hoboken bar that's overcrowded with lame persons.  I would highly suggest this bar.
2012-01-06,4,This place is great for a hang-out. A very small place, I'd imagine it gets packed on weekends, but on weeknights its just a cool place with great music and a friendly crowd. Even with a full bar it took just under a minute to walk up and order a couple drinks and the bartender was polite and efficient. I'd definitely drop in here again to grab a quick drink on my way home after eating on Washington street or if I had some time to kill in Hoboken!
2011-12-20,3,You know what this divey bar steps below Washington St is actually kind of awesome. It is definitely a fun dive bar that you can walk into and not expect any judgment. Reasonable prices, but don't expect anything fancy. Pool table and one of those quasi-shuffleboard/screen setups. This place was exactly what I was hoping it would be. The bartender was really friendly too.
2011-10-08,4,Jukebox playing classic rock at a normal volume.Bartender was totally chill.Zero pretentiousness.  No crews of d-bags or B&T-ers fuckin with mah flow.Locals maxin and relaxin up in here.$4 draught beers for Happy Hour.Don't come here...you'll only be messin with mah flow, yo.
2011-08-17,5,Another reason I miss Hoboken.  If you like overpriced foofoo drinks, microbrews, trendy finger foods, and background top 40 noise, this aint the place for you.  But if you are cool, like punk and old school rock n' roll with an amazing jukebox, cool bartenders, cheap beer and even the occasional foofoo drink (Brian makes a GREAT vodka soda which is basically vodka, club and cranberry - in a pint glass - he rocks).  They don't have food, but have menus for delivery - I've had my pizza delivered there more than once.  There is basically a bar and a pool table.  You can get sports on, Sunday afternoons in summer time, baseball games and in the fall of course football.  At night, you'll see the UFC stuff.  I mean, there's something for everyone.  If you're cool that is.  Don't come in here expecting to hear Britney Spears or something.  The Clash, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, Stones, Replacements.  Sigh.  I miss their jukebox.Every now and then, I get a hankering for a bar like this in the city.  The only place remotely close would be in the East Village I guess, but that's Guam to me.  In Hoboken, I know what I am going to get, so I always have a soft spot in my heart for L&Js.
2011-08-14,3,They are one of the few bars in Hobo that have PURSE HOOKS for the girls. Thank youuuu.It's a dive bar. I only reason I know I was here because of my string of Facebook check-ins. I walk by here every morning on my traipse to the Path. They leave up their sign about booze in the morning sometimes. It sure is enticing.
2011-07-25,4,I walked into this place on a Tuesday night and instantly felt like I was back home in Boston. All the people who were there were cool and it gave the place a very laid back atmosphere. As far as I'm concerned, it's a hidden gem in Hoboken and I hope it stays that way. Not that this review will help that. The bar itself is in the basement of the building and as soon as you walk in you have to wait for your eyes to adjust because the place is dark. The bar takes up most of the place with a pool table at the back.  The pool table is great if you want to play while having a couple of drinks and cost a dollar per game. If not, you can sit at the bar and watch something on the TV and chat with the people sitting around you. The jukebox there had some awesome tunes in it that you won't find much other places now a days. It's chock full of bands such as ACDC, The Rolling Stones, Elvis and other lost treasures.The vibe of the place was very laid back with everybody just having some casual drinks and hanging out. There was no screaming, unnecessary loud music, or that typical crowd of people in Hoboken who's shirts are way too tight. The only real disturbance would be when a couple of drunk people would stumble in and order a couple of drinks. The bartender was wicked cool and when we had heard almost everything in the jukebox he let someone plug in their iPod to continue the good tunes. He also always made sure your glass was full or that you were all set with everything.The drinks were cheaper than other places I have found in Hoboken, with beers being about four dollars and mixed drinks being about five to six, depending on what you get. Overall I gave this place a four star because of the great atmosphere, the cheap drinks, the good staff, the excellent jukebox and so much more.  I plan on hitting this place up again and again. My home away from home bar.
2011-06-19,5,Great beer selection, laid back crowd, but the real draw here is the jukebox.  Just the best ... classic rock, punk, all just good stuff.
2011-06-05,5,Just a great bar, with one of the best jukeboxes around. If you like American Idol, shitty reality shows or any of the other banality that's destroying Western Civilization this DEFINITELY isn't the place for you.You really need a soul and brain to enjoy it. Cheers
2011-05-16,5,reasonably priced drinks.  great atmosphere - not snooty, and not packed with straight-outta-college kids.plus there's a pool table and kick ass leagues play each wednesday night.
2011-05-08,5,Louise & Jerry's is one of the few places in Hoboken where I actually enjoy myself.good customers, good bartenders, good vibe.go to there.
2011-04-18,5,If you're in Hoboken, what are you doing not being here!?! Cheap drinks, great bartender, amazing jukebox. Double nickels in a jukebox. Nuff said
2011-03-24,5,I'm amazed that this place is still around.  Back in the late '70's / early '80's, when moving to and subsequently living in Hoboken was more like homesteading in the frontier than moving to a trendy neighborhood (the yuppies hadn't moved in yet), I lived across the street from Louise & Jerry's.  I would look out the front windows of my railroad flat and wait until Louise turned the lights on in the early evening.  That's how I knew she was open.  At that point in time, it was just Louise (no Jerry) and she  would come shuffling out from the back wearing a cotton house dress that snapped down the front (I was always pretty sure that she lived back there) and begin tending bar.  Draft glasses of beer were a nickel.  I kid you not.  And although I pretty much knew or could recognize all the resident hipsters of Hoboken back in that era (the guys from the Bongos, John Sayles, all the hangers on from Maxwell's...) I never once ran into anyone that I knew at Louise & Jerry's.  It really did feel like my place.  In fact, during my love affair with the sweet wonderful man who I would eventually marry, we would slip into Louise & Jerry's for a beer in between sessions of passionate lovemaking in my flat.  Cause, you know, you're in your twenties, you're in love and you have to have beer, plus it was unbelievably cheap!  Since our relationship was really on the down low in those days, it was the perfect hideaway where I knew no one would bother us while we savored the sweetness of  being madly in love with one another.  We were keeping it quiet so that there was no one to interfere or gossip or infringe on the precious thing we had found. Sometimes relationships are like that, and if you ever were in a romance like the one I describe, Louise & Jerry's was the perfect spot for hiding your love away.  I haven't been back to Hoboken for years, but someday I'm gonna get my man to go on a road trip with me and relive our moments at Louise & Jerry's.  But I don't think the beers are a nickel anymore.
2011-03-09,2,Is it fair of me to rate Louise & Jerry's? I live in a veritable oasis of great bars (that is, Brooklyn), and here I am tramping over to Hoboken to take the piss out of everyone's favorite dive bar--if the Yelp reviews are to be believed. But someone has to say it: compared to Hoboken's bar scene, perhaps Louise & Jerry's is top-notch. But compared to the glorious bars that await you on the other side of the PATH (and, er, another couple of rides on the subway), this bar is pretty run-of-the-mill. Adjust your expectations accordingly.
2011-02-08,5,One of my favorite local dives for years. If you want to avoid the "scene" this is a great place to go. Awesome juke box with all your punk favorites and some more esoteric bands.Decent prices, considering the area. Met some cool people here over the years.Bartender pours get more generous as the night progresses.
2010-12-23,5,Is it a dive?  Hell yes it is.  Is the jukebox beyond stacked with great music?  Hell yes it is.  Are the prices fair?  Hell yes they are.Is there a good mix of "young professionals" and "old school punk rockers?"  Hell yes.Are the prices fair?  Hell yes.Will they let you bring in your own food?  Hell yes.Pool table and Buck Hunter?  Hell yes.
2010-11-21,5,every review i've read mentions the jukebox, and with good reason.  this place is a gem for music fans who want to go to a bar and not hear the same 20 songs over and over again.  do people know tom petty has more than american girl and that don't stop believing just sucks.if you want to hear music you just heard on the radio with your girlfriends or who want to hear kings of leon (the sex one fire song-not their good stuff from 2003) with your bros, this is not the place for you.if you want to hear GOOD music, and not deal with the top40/mtv party crowd, this is the place for you!!!try to go (every other) wednesday where they have a great dj who plays really cool stuff!!
2010-11-14,4,My fave bar in Hoboken. Great music and cool, creative vibe.
2010-11-04,5,No fuss bar service, excellent jukebox. Just stopped by for a quick beer with friends, but will definitely stop by again for a longer stay.
2010-07-03,5,After a few weeks of residing in my new home in Hoboken, this is officially my favorite bar so far.  Not much to add to my previous review aside from the fact that draft beers were $4, there's buy-backs, the bartender is still the nicest guy ever, and the jukebox is one of the best I've seen in a long, long while.
2010-07-01,4,And I thought most of Hoboken's bars were filled with prissy girls and fist pumping guys.  Okay, maybe they are but Louise & Jerry's definitely stands out amongst them.  It is a dive bar but I appreciate them especially when they have great bartenders, cheap drinks, and a $1 pool table in the back.I came here with a few friends to celebrate my birthday.  Our first round of drinks which included shots, beer and mixed drinks (8 total) came out to a whopping $36?? Yes, you read it right.  I fell in love.The bartender was super nice and payed attention to us when we needed more drinks. The bar was semi packed but after all it was a Sunday night and only the alcoholics come out to play then.  Teehee.We only stayed for an hour or so and moved to another lounge next door since they were closing at 2 AM.  Trying to be efficient with our time. :)Louise & Jerry's I WILL be back!!
2010-03-31,5,'Louise & Jerry's' might be one of the last standing bars in Hoboken with the classic dive bar mentality. It's fantastic. Great bartenders, great beer, pool table, and an amazing juke box. Along with that dive bar mentality comes the locals who are true Hoboken-ites (Jersey City as well) not the shore trash that come into Hoboken looking to cop-a-feel towards yuppies at 'Bahama Mama's.' When you step into 'Louise & Jerry's' you automatically roll with the laid back vibe or they'll send you back to 'Texas Arizona' with all the other 'jersey trash.' They have beer on draft but more of the impressive varietals come from bottles which, realistically aren't very cheap. If you spend the whole night there sipping on Abita Jockamo's, playing pool and taking an occasional cheap whiskey shot you're look at spending maybe $40-50 (depending on how much of a dive bar alcoholic you are.) Then again, it's Hoboken and no bar is really all that cheap to begin with. However the bartenders are honest and if you ask they will make you a strong mixed cocktail for a very reasonable price. The bar is rather small so as other users have said, don't go in large groups to this place. There are many other bars in Hoboken which cater to that kind of vibe. I can't stress enough that this is a place where if you were cool back in the 1980s and living in Hoboken you would be a regular at. It's completely real. It's not young professional or hipster either, it's just very straight forward -- pretty much unlike any other in the area.
2010-02-28,5,Hoboken's classic dive bar. It is one of the only places in the town that caters to the kind of demographic you find more in the lower east side or Brooklyn. The crowd is more 30s than most other Hob bars nowadays. Decor hasn't changed since at least the 1980s. Juke box is eclectic and indie. There's got a pool table. Little corner nooks where you can chat. Pat, a great, great bar tender, who is serious about what he does.I wouldnt plan a rowdy night for a crowd of more than 4-5 people here... This bar is for those relaxed evenings when you want to hang out, have a few drinks, shoot some pool, have some fun, low-key conversation with new people. My recommendation is... check it out on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Decide whether you like it. It's not everybody's cup of tea, but that's one of the things that makes it great.
2009-12-19,4,The best moments I've ever spent in Hoboken were listening to old timers at L&J's tell me about their lives in Hoboken - working on the piers, waiting tables, driving buses, whatever. And going into the city for shows when payday came. Most of those customers are gone now, but their spirits live on, and I always stop back in to buy them a drink. When this place goes, and I hope it never does, I'll write Hoboken off forever. But it's still there, like a beating heart of a phantom town that just doesn't want to die.
2009-11-09,5,Hands down the best bar in Hoboken. Amidst the sea of cheese that is 07030, L&J's is cut from a different cloth. The fantastic jukebox is updated just frequently enough (always new stuff, but the classics stay put), and Pat is one of the best bartenders around. Also - a major plus is the complete absence of guidos, which is no mean feat for the mile square city.The crowd is definitely local, but not townie. Always a bunch of people playing pool and Buck Hunter in the back. It's a skinny bar that can get cramped, so maybe not the best place for large groups. However, if you like laid-back bars with great music, good bartenders, and interesting peeps - L&J's is your place.
2009-08-31,1,Well, I suppose ratings by nature must be subjective. After all, what one person considers to be "great" can be another person's "trash". However, I feel that at the very heart of it, a bar should be entertaining. This is why some people go to bars with dance music (to dance); others go to bars with TVs (to watch sports games); and others go to bars with a laid back atmosphere (to socialize with friends).I'd venture to say that L and J's fits into this 3rd category, although it doesn't really do it too well. It's about small to average sized, so if you've got more than a few friends, it's probably going to feel a little cramped. The only time I went, I didn't really get a feel for anything mentioned in the other reviews... in fact the atmosphere was very sterile, and although I knew people there, I left after a short while.There's no loud music or huge plasma TV's, which is fine, since that's not what they're trying to be about, but like I mentioned above, they're not really succeeding at doing much if anything.If you hate the Hoboken scene, as many do, then you might find some solace here. If you're looking for a good time with friends and are under the age of 30, then stay away from this place.  1.5* out of 5 (they didn't spit in my beer so I can't give them a 1).
2008-10-04,4,Small pub with a decent selection of beer.  The place has a very good vibe and not nearly a frat bar, which is a good thing.  The jukebox is awesome and the music is not too loud that it drowns out your conversation.  A tad on the small side, so its not great for a large group, but smaller ones like 3-4 people will fit in nicely.  Its also not crowded to the point that you cannot move.  You do have the occasional 'excuse me' to get a shot off while playing pool.
2007-03-12,5,One thing that Maxwell's needs is Louise & Jerry's jukebox.  Small bar with a pool table and Deer Hunt in the back for entertainment though my drunken self kept going back to the jukebox....Stiff Little Fingers and more but I can't remember because I was drunk.
2007-02-26,4,This is a bar.  They serve beer.  They've got a pool table.All compelling reasons to go here, if you want a bar that serves beer.  Mostly, though, you should go because they have a great jukebox.  If you like to drink your Yeungling while listening to Holland 1945 or the Flaming Lips and are near this bar, head on in!Why not 5*?  because I don't live in Hoboken and don't have a burning desire to go to Louise and Jerry's unless I'm already in Hoboken, but it is pretty much the best weekend bar on the busy stretch of Washington St. (Maxwell's is kind of off in its own corner.)
