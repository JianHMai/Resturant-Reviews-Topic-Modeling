2021-11-01,5,The vodka sauce was really great with breaded chicken. That bronzino was delicious melted in your mouth. Love this place great for any occasion
2021-10-22,4,super yumm! its byob so don't forget. must try the black truffle mascarpone pie and smashed burrata and prosciutto as an app!
2021-10-17,1,My rating is entirely attributable to poor customer service. I arrived at the restaurant around 6pm looking for an inside table for my wife and I. Note, they do not take reservations and they operate on a first come first serve basis. I was told by the manager that it would be 5/10 minute wait while they cleaned off a table that had just been vacated. While my wife and I were waiting  outside in the cold, a party of five arrived and put their name in after us.  The manager asked my wife and I if we would mind waiting another 15 minutes for a table. When I asked why, I was told that there was a party of five also in need of a table and to surrender a four person table to a party of two (my wife and I) would cost him money. So much for first come first serve. I will take my business elsewhere and I encourage others to do the same. There are a lot of great Italian restaurants in Hoboken that are far better managed than Otto.
2021-10-02,4,Fantastic food!!!!! The bee sting pizza was incredible. Love honey drizzle on pizza the pasta was also great but pizza was certainly star of the show.
2021-10-01,5,Wow! This is some of the best Italian food I've had in Hoboken. I can't believe how large Otto Strada's menu is, trying to decide on what to order took forever because everything sounded so delicious! It was unsurprisingly busy for a Friday evening. We wanted to eat outside because the weather was nice but the outdoor area was full. The indoor space is fairly small and tables are a little close together. Just be prepared for that! Like a lot of Hoboken spots, this restaurant is BYOB. Now onto the food: - Garlic Lemon Stuffed Artichoke: Stuffed artichoke packed with garlic-y goodness! It was delicious and a great appetizer to share. Only downside was that the edges of the artichoke were a little sharp...scratched up the inside of my mouth! - Orecchiette With Fresh Corn and Burrata: Omg, life changing. Seems like this is a seasonal menu item and I'm tempted to go back this fall just to order this dish again. The combination of the burrata, olive oil, and corn was simple yet flavorful. - We also tried another appetizer that I don't see on their online menu - it was a sweet potato crostini with Brie, honey, and pear slices. Four pieces per order. It was another perfect fall appetizer that I'd order again! I'll absolutely be back! I have my eye on their pizzas :)
2021-09-26,5,The ambience, food, and service at this restaurant is a 10/10. Really good spot for dinner/dates, or even for larger groups! Their menu has a variety of options and the portions are also sized well to share. Would recommend the pizza with the honey drizzle!!
2021-09-16,5,Order takeout from Otto Strada, and I wish I dined in. It's a cute looking Italian restaurant with outdoor seating. I would highly recommend the eggplant parm. It's also BYOB.
2021-09-01,4,This restaurant was absolutely phenomenal. The only draw backs were the tight seating, lighting, and loud music. The smashed burrata and prosciutto was delicious, the burrata and prosciutto paired each other perfectly. The white and black truffle pesto came out much better than I expected, it was packed with flavor and I will definitely order it again if I return. The penne Vodka was delicious and the best part was the moz on top. The sauce was creamy and full of flavor I definitely would get again. Overall the food and service carried the experience.
2021-08-21,4,I walked in on a Friday night and the restaurant was very lively indoors and outdoors. We waited a few minutes to get a table for two and the service was fast! We ordered the bruschetta which was served quickly and it was loaded with tomatoes and tasted delicious. We ordered the rigatoni vodka and the olio e aglio as our entrees. The portions were generous. The rigatoni vodka was average, the sauce lacked a little in flavor but the olio e aglio pasta was packed with spices. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like spicy food. We ordered the Nutella brownie for dessert and it was very decadent and fudgey and so big we had to pack it to go. The overall ambience was nice and our waiter was excellent! Would go there again and it's BYOB too so that's a plus.
2021-08-17,5,Just posting an update that this is still our favorite restaurant in Hoboken :) Simply cannot beat the food here.
2021-08-13,5,I could not say a bad thing about this restaurant. The dining experience is great. The take out experience is great. They do not skim you whatsoever on the portions. In my opinion, this is the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken. The best part is- it is BYOB. I recommend a pasta dish. My favorite is the linguine with the Brussel sprouts is amazing. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.
2021-08-09,5,10/10 amazing Italian food! Great service and atmosphere that offers indoor and outdoor seating. Will definitely be back!
2021-08-07,5,Have been wanting to try this restaurant and I'm so happy I finally did! The food was so delicious! For appetizers we got the smashed burrata and the mussels- so yummy!!! We also got two pastas to share and they were so fresh and tasty! Can't wait to come back!
2021-07-25,4,My only complaint is that the food took a very long time but it was worth it. I got the bee sting pizza which was pretty good but the pasta was the star of the show. Tried my friends vodka rigatoni and spaghetti and they were both delicious. Will be back to try more pastas from here.
2021-07-10,5,I don't usually leaves reviews for places but Otto Strada was so good to us that I had to leave a 5 star review. The owner was very welcoming, our server was great, and the food was amazing. We ate way more than we planned on because we couldn't stop it was so good. I'll be recommending this to anyone in the area.
2021-07-01,4,This lovely Italian restaurant located just a few blocks from the New York skyline in Hoboken presented us with the most delicious authentic Italian food I've had in quite a while. I do want to say, however, that seating was quite difficult given that the tables were practically stacked on top of each other and given the smallness of the restaurant. It was hard to be intimate with my own party seeing that there was barely any room from one table to the next which definitely took some adjusting to. The food itself was amazing. We were presented with light and airy focaccia bread as a starter and then proceeded to split a couple of the dishes. The stuffed peppers were perfectly seasoned and buttered up, and the rigatoni pasta was the best I've ever had!! It was super creamy and cheesy. We ordered a few other dishes but those ones definitely stood out! Dinner here was hearty and fulfilling, it was the kind of meal that makes your soul warm!
2021-06-30,5,Otto Strada is a wonderful place for brunch or dinner. I challenge you to tell me that you've had better mussels than Nonna's Angry Mussels on the dinner menu, and the eggs in purgatory on the brunch menu! Never had a bad meal here, and they are the friendliest servers.
2021-05-01,2,So many good reviews here for this restaurant! I have been here twice and experienced not so good service both times. First, they don't take reservations, so we walked in. We got a seat after an hour but it was outdoors. Requested for indoors but they rudely said they wouldn't be able to do that. Well okay,  they don't even have good hospitality and no outdoor heaters. We literally froze outside. Restaurants are going above and beyond these days to make customers feel comfortable on cold days. But not this place!! Service is so bad that no one came to check on us. We had to go inside and ask for the check. Food was average, have had far better pizzas in Newyork city. All in all, a big NO for me and never coming back.
2021-04-29,4,Food is delish!! This Italian restaurant is so cozy! They have a cute dining room with limited seating. They do enforce their 90 min rule which was the only annoying point of the visit..Menu seems to heavily focus on pizzas but we were craving pasta. My mom got the branzino,  I ordered the adult Mac and cheese (aka creamu truffle pasta), and they were kind enough to accommodate my dad's off menu request of angel hair pasta with cream sauce and shrimp. They serve a wonderfully warm rosemary foccacia  with a fresh tasting olive oil (like you would get in italy!! Full of flavor!).It was a very nice dinner that is BYOB but once you get close to your 90 mins, the server definitely makes it known you should be headed out. In fact I got my bill without asking for it. We got the meatball pizza to go... I do feel like this is better executed on pasta, but the pizza wasn't bad.. I'll try one of their other pizzas next time and hopefully order and eat within their allocated 90 mins lol.Last tip.. we got the cannoli cones. For $15 these are not worth it! Skip this for a nicer dessert elsewhere as there are many Italian bakeries in the area.
2021-04-10,3,Sadly...if you think their burrata is good...You've clearly never had good burrata before. It was not creamy in the least bit and was rubbery and hard like an hard-boiled egg white. That really started off the meal poorly. Also did not like the balsamic glaze and honey added onto it. It was as if they were trying to cover up something bad but made it worse. I wrote a review on actual amazing burrata in Hoboken if you want to check it out.... Another fail item was their bruschetta. Lacked salt and no one wanted to fight over the remaining one. Their menu was overwhelmingly long but everything sounded too good. And as the saying goes- sometimes its just too good to be true, and it was surely was the case here. Pulled Pork Pappardelle- 1/5 stars. This was the biggest let down. The ingredient list really hyped it up, with a burrata on top (this was before we knew what it really tasted like from the appetizer) It was missing something in the sauce, perhaps salt and more seasoning? The pasta itself tasted fresh but too soft. I took one bite and set it aside. Adult Mac and Cheese with Truffle- 3.5/5. Wasn't cheesy but tasted good. Love the mushroom in it but wouldn't call it a "Mac and Cheese". Vodka Rigatoni- 5/5 stars. This was my favorite of all the pastas we ordered. The vodka sauce was done right and the gooey cheesy mozzarella on top was glorious. Pasta was perfectly al dente. This was the only highlight of the night. Some Hazelnut Brownie/cake thing- 2/5. If it were served warm it would've been better. But it was super dense, fudgey and cold. It was a miss for me.
2021-03-07,4,I'd been putting off Otto only because you can't make reservations. I'll start by saying we put our name down on a Saturday night, went to pick up our wine and on the walk back they called us for a table - my no reservation fears were all wrong. This also speaks to the level of service here - five stars. Everyone is so kind and easy going. I love when servers share recommendations and everyone at Otto did just that. We started with the Burrata. How can you go wrong with Burrata? It comes with balsamic glaze and prosciutto. The portion size is huge! The balsamic glaze is really the star here. It almost tasted like it was made with honey? 10/10 would have this dish again. For dinner we ordered the Tortellini and Tagliatelle alla Bolognese. If I'm sharing pastas I like to do a red and a white sauce ya know? Both dishes were out of this world. Really fantastic. The pasta tasted really fresh. I personally loved the Bolognese sauce the most.   Portion sizes are huge so be prepared for left overs. Finally, I can't forget to mention it's BYOB! There's a market right around the corner to pick up whatever you need before dinner. Looking forward to going back.
2021-03-07,5,The octopus for appetizer was out of this world. Along with the buratta. I could honestly just have eaten that all night and been set. BYOB is nice too
2021-02-14,5,Amazing!! I could've eaten the bee sting pizza myself it was bomb. Caesar salad here is underrated this was fire.
2021-02-14,5,This experience definitely surpassed our expectations! After hearing they don't take reservations, we decided to show up 25 minutes early for an outdoor igloo seating. Glad we did because there was a line by the opening bell at 5. Very thankfully the owner allowed us to get seated and heated in our space. The service was spot on, we never needed anything. The food was just perfect. The ingredients were fresh, everything was coursed out properly and we were never rushed. This was the best dining experience we have had in 5 years in Hoboken! Luckily we live right down the block. See you again Otto.PS... Best tiramisu I have ever had.
2021-02-11,5,Plain and simply the best food you can find in Hoboken! The drunken mussels are amazing and come with plenty of extra sauce you can dip your bread in. They have very unique but delicious pizzas, including the fig and goat cheese pizza which is out of this world. They've also just installed outdoor greenhouses so that people can continue to dine outdoor in the winter months.
2021-01-24,3,Food was good here. But I have to give it three stars because the service was really not great: the guy who took our name down told us it would be an hour long wait so we walked elsewhere. Then he called 15 mins later to say our table was ready and when we said we were on our way he said he couldn't wait... we had to argue with the guy to hold the table for 5 minutes. So rude and unnecessary.
2021-01-21,5,Guys!! If you haven't been here- RUN. This is the best place for pasta in Hoboken. Some of my fave apps are the smashed burrata and the stuffed peppers. Make sure you don't forget to BYO, and sadly they don't take reservations so there will most likely be a wait if you go at a popular time.
2021-01-19,5,Great place. Food is always good. Tonight they snuck in a dessert on our pick up order. Much appreciated and will be coming back much more even without the extra!  :)
2021-01-12,5,I don't even know where to begin. This restaurant truly is amazing and all of their dishes are unique which sets them apart from the other italian restaurants in the area. The tortelloni di manzo is AMAZING always my #1 recommendation and no-ones ever disappointed. A must visit if you're in Hoboken.
2021-01-12,5,AMAZING gluten free food. Super friendly staff. Great atmosphere. I can't recommend it enough.
2020-12-04,5,YUMMMM! First time eating here since moving to town. We got delivery and it was an hour expected wait but we got it in 30! The foot was still super hot and cooked with love. We got the funghi pasta and the bolagnese. So good both of them and so fresh! Comes with some bread too. Portions are great. A bit pricey but i think food this good is worth it! Will be back.
2020-11-24,5,After dozens of trips I can confidently say every dish is better than the last. BYOB too!
2020-11-21,5,The best Italian food you will ever eat. My wife and I moved to Hoboken 2 months ago and we've brought all of our friends and family to this place (we went 7 times in 9 weeks). The rigatoni alla vodka and the truffle tartufo pasta are a MUST if you are a pasta lover like us. The place offers a great outdoor experience as they have properly sectioned off the seating arrangements for everyone to feel safe during COVID. The waiters are great, especially George, who is knowledgeable about every item on the menu and can point you to the dinner of your dreams when you're conflicted. All in all, we've waited over 1.5hrs for this place and it was worth every minute.
2020-11-21,5,After a 1.5 hour wait, Otto strada stood up to the expectations. Love having an OG Italian place in the neighborhood. They were super accommodating for a vegetarian diet and the cannoli calzone was out of this world!!!
2020-11-08,4,I've been wanting to try this place for a while, after hearing great things about their pasta and pizza. I came here once over the summer for brunch, and was disappointed that there were no pasta dishes on the menu (and brunch was very average), but all the more reason to come again to try it. It was getting crowded around 6-6:30 on a Friday night as expected, and took us about 15 min for two people to be seated. I got the rigatoni alla vodka, it was fresh and tasty but the rigatoni was hard to eat and I prefer this dish with another type of pasta like penne. The meatball was very fresh and delicious, and the adult Mac and cheese was amazing. I would get that dish for sure next time and try other pasta dishes because there are so many great options to choose from! Only thing we didn't like was the Amaretto Tiramisu (not pictures) - I prefer regular tiramisu but if you like Amaretto that's a dessert you'll like!
2020-11-01,5,Veal ravioli was amazing. Did not love the red pesto pasta nearly as much, was kind of bland and not worth the price. Always would get pasta so tried the pizza last time and was also amazing. Always busy so make sure you leave your name and walk around or call for a reservation in advance. No cork fee is great ;)
2020-11-01,5,The pizza here is incredible! Lots of specialty pies with less common toppings such as broccoli rabe and potatoes. Feels like what I assume is true pizza you'd get in Italy. Each pizza feeds about one person plus a little bit more. Nice and thin but not too thin. I opted to pick up which was very quick.
2020-10-27,5,Phenomenal. Not a single bad thing to say! Always have seats. Service is wonderful. Food is out of this world. Highly recommend this place any day of the week. Brunch also = amazing.
2020-10-20,4,Cute little spot to grab lunch or dinner. The pizza with the fresh burrata was delicious and the chicken sandwich with brocolli rabe, also good.
2020-10-16,5,Amazing food. I know we came for the pasta but the bread was amazing as well. Pasta was amazing, as expected. Also love that it was spacious and COVID friend inside with large amount of space between each table.
2020-10-09,4,Great brunch spot. The burrata pizza was very good. Nice outdoor seating. Staff was not on top of me.
2020-10-08,4,Authentic Italian cuisine with a modern flare. The staff is friendly and attentive. There is BYOB and wait staff will uncork for you and even provide you with an ice bucket for your bottle. The Polpetta pizza, Espresso Short Rib Ravioli, Adult Mac and Cheese and Rigatoni with Mutz all good choices.
2020-10-03,5,I came here with 2 of my friends. The wait was an hour and 40 minutes but my friend swore the wait was worth it. She wasn't wrong!To start they give you complementary warm bread with olive oil. I got the capellini con pancetta y cavolini y funghi and my two friends both got the adult mac and cheese. My dish was rather simple; capellini with pancetta mushrooms and Brussel sprouts coated in pecorino and olive oil. Simple but very good. The adult mac and cheese was amazing. I slightly wish I got that instead.Our waiter was awesome. Overall a great experience. I'm definitely going to come back and try more from the menu. I love pasta but they have a pizza and meat dishes as well.
2020-10-02,4,Did out door dining for dinner. They do not take reservations and we got here around 6PM on a Friday. They said the wait was 45 minutes to an hour we walked around for maybe 15 minutes when they called to let us know our table was ready.The food was so GOOD! We ordered everything off of the specials menu. We got the burrata, bruschetta, rigatoni with fresh mutz, one chicken fish, and white pizza with truffle. On food alone I give it a 5/5! This place is also BYOB.They only reason I deducted one star is because of service. After we finished appetizers it took us about an hour to get our meals! Definitely recommend coming here.
2020-09-18,5,My FAVORITE restaurant in Hoboken. You absolutely must try the Pepe rosso pesto Linguini.
2020-09-15,5,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken! There menu changes from time to time. My favorite dish is the Gnocchi. Sadly they don't have it anymore - hopeful it will return in the near future. I also love that this restaurant is BYOB - how does one not love that?! Small space, which means there's always a wait, but it is worth it. I stopped by over the weekend and came around 530 and had no issue picking a table inside/outside. Since the weather was nice, we picked a table outside. Around 6/630 all the tables were filled. I suggest coming close to opening. I had ordered angel hair, mushroom, bacon and brussels sprout dish. I can't remember the name off the top of my head. It was phenomenal. Had left overs the following day and it was delicious. I highly recommend it!I find that the dishes are filling and fairly priced. If you're looking for a good Italian spot, don't pass this one up.
2020-09-03,5,Some of the best food in Hoboken! Went to try their new brunch menu last weekend and absolutely loved everything!! Didn't get a chance to take a picture of their Benedict with pesto and prosciutto, it was too delicious to wait
2020-08-30,5,Best Italian I've ever had and that's saying a lot as a New Yorker! Everything cooked to perfection- cheese / pasta / meatball, you name it.
2020-08-23,5,What an awesome meal. Seriously, the service, the food, the ambiance and BYOB. One of Hoboken's best!
2020-08-22,5,This is the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken. The pizza, the pasta, the salads, everything is always delicious and service is always great
2020-08-20,4,Ambience - Great ambience, lighting and well separated tablesFood - Some dishes were better than the others.. Burrata was excellent. Pizza could definitely be improved being from brick oven .. Spaghetti being pre-made got a bit dryService - Great service, very accommodating and mindful of us dining with a toddler.. everyone wore masks and greeted us promptlyVerdict - might return for casual experience
2020-08-17,5,WOW. Best Italian food I've ever had, and I've had my share of Italian meals!!! The pasta was amazing, bread was fresh, staff was friendly and the ambience was relaxing. You really can not ask for more. It's BYOB too which was nice. Highly recommend, will be coming back for dinner again soon.
2020-08-17,5,My friends and I came here for the first time on Saturday and had the most amazing meal. Its BYOB, which is great, there is tons of outdoor seating and the staff is so friendly. The food was outstanding, we all couldn't stop eating!!! We also got the tiramisu for dessert but forgot to take a picture because it was that good!! Will definitely be making the trip (45+ min drive) again here soon.
2020-08-17,5,This is hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. You'll find this gem off the beaten path on 8th street, hence the name Otto strada. My most recent visit was during Covid and they had a great outdoor set up with quite a bit of seating. It's much quieter in this neck of the woods compared to Washington street which is a plus. Everyone was very kind and accommodating. First of all, if you come here and don't get the octopus, you're missing out. It is seriously the best around and the portion is huge - definitely big enough to split among 3 or 4 people as an app. The pizza here is also very good and there's plenty of variety to choose from. The salmon is another one of my favorite dishes here. It's cooked on a plank and the combination of mustard, brown sugar, etc on top is amazing. They don't take reservations and tend to fill up quickly. If you want to be guaranteed a table on the weekends, arrive before they open at 5pm for dinner. This is also a BYOB - another major plus.
2020-08-12,5,Consistently delicious, no matter what you order on the menu. They are doing a great job with outside dining and delivery during the pandemic. Highly recommend trying the burrata crostini!
2020-08-11,5,Great BYOB outdoor dining spot. I have ordered pizza delivery from them, but Sunday was my first time going to the restaurant. Doing as best as a restaurant can to social distance and still provide good service. I got the rigatoni with a blanket of mozz special and my gf got the orecchiette special too. Pasta was great, and we started with a pick your own 3-cheese plate of burrata, Parmesan, and fontina that was unreal too. I'd recommend Otto Strada to anybody lookin for a nice Italian dinner.
2020-08-10,4,I go to Otto Strada a lot and had another enjoyable dinner outside.  They allowed us to bring our small dog and have her sit under the table which was nice. To start, we shared the stuffed peppers appetizer - there were two different types of pepper - both were good and was very tasty.  I tried the large stuffed tortellini dish as my main which had a creamy sauce & balsamic drizzle - very tasty.  My parents shared the rosso inside out calzone (huge) and a small margarita pie.  Everything came out quickly.  I love that they make their own pasta in house and the complimentary garlic bread with olive oil.  It's also BYO.   They have these vines growing over the outdoor seating with real grapes growing from it.  If you are allergic or afraid of bees, you should probably opt to sit in the streatery instead since there were a lot of bees buzzing in the vines (one actually fell down our table).   Can't wait to go back again and try something new!I go to Otto Strada a lot and had another enjoyable dinner outside.

2020-08-08,5,Easily the best restaurant in Hoboken.  I would highly recommend the smashed burrata app. It's so good you will want to divorce your spouse and marry this app. IT IS THAT GOOD.
2020-08-07,5,Food here is delicious, we've ordered from Otto Strada as well as eaten at the restaurant several times and it's always so good. The goat cheese and fig pizza is phenomenal. Delivery man was so nice, and they even threw in a free dessert! Highly recommend for a delicious Italian meal.
2020-07-23,5,Food was absolutely delicious. The ambiance is nice and cozy andddd our waiter GEORGE was soo awesome. He was so sweet and constantly making sure we had everything we needed! I highly recommend
2020-07-22,5,I'm beyond amazed with this place- we got a delivery order during a horrid thunder storm and even though the streets were flooded, somehow my order got here only 10 min after promised . In terms of the food.. wow! My husband and I go to Italy every year and this really held up- the mussels were out of this world- bean salad was redic , the fresh basil made me feel like I was back in Roma- hubby got the Pollo alla Milanese con Prosciutto- and devoured it. The roasted veggies aka the  "verdure misto" were fantastic!! And the best surprise ... a tiramisu style cake piece that wasn't ordered but such a pleasant and delicious surprise. 10000000% order from here- you won't be disappointed
2020-07-13,5,I came to this place recently during COVID-19 and was impressed on how well the restaurant kept everyone safe. All employees wore masks and all tables were 6 ft apart. The menu was a little bit difficult to read for me since I'm not very familiar with Italian dishes. But the food was amazing I had the special pasta al Vodka and asked for chicken since most of the pasta dishes didn't have a protein. It was delicious!!!! A tad spicy due to the pepper flakes but still so delicious. Would recommend and come here again
2020-07-06,5,Went here with my sister randomly, and ever since then she won't stop talking about this place. She lives in Manhattan and this restaurant is her favorite place ever so far. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is cute and small- just how I like it! Get here early though cause it does get crowded later in the evening. Best part about waiting on line? You can drink your own BYOB on it!
2020-06-24,5,Otto Strada has been a go-to favorite for years now, and never disappoints. I've gotten takeout a few times since the start of the pandemic, but last nights takeout blew me away. I ordered during peak-dinner time hours and my food was still ready in under 20 minutes. I ordered the delicious Insalata Di Rucola salad to start, followed by the rigatoni with vodka sauce special (covered in melty fresh mozz) - see pictures. The pasta was still hot by the time I brought it home, and it was one of my favorite pasta dishes to date. The 2 dishes gave me enough food for 2 meals! Amazing as per usual.
2020-06-19,5,We ordered a few dishes to be delivered and they were all great! My favorite? Good old linguini with Bolognese. Delicious!
2020-06-05,1,I recently ordered takeout and not only was the person who took my order rude, but the delivery person wouldn't bring my food up to my apartment. He called me and literally just said "are you coming out?" without any sort of greeting. I live so close by, but I will not be ordering pickup or takeout from here again.
2020-05-19,5,While working on the frontline here in New Jersey a fellow nurse gave me a list of restaurants to try. Well Otto Strada was on that list and boy am I so glad that I came over and gave it a try. Their food is delicious. The cooks or chef definitely knows what their doing. I will say that it is a little on the pricey side but it's so worth it! Tartufo Pizza:  Delicious choice but make sure you love truffle and mushroom. Tagliatelle Al Tartufo E Funghi: OMG!!! This was so delicious! Again, you must love mushroom and truffle to order this dish! I was so impreseed with how hot my food was. I ordered during the Covid Quarantine and when I made it back to Newark my food was still hot and didn't need to be microwaved!!!! Spaghetti Aglio E Olio: This is good but let me caution you that it is very SPICY! It was so spicy that I was coughing and the entire area on my face around my mouth was numb from it. I couldn't finish this dish... I tried my best but I couldn't.  It was good but entirely too spicy for me. Dessert: I tried the Cannoli Cream Calzone and the Amaretto Tiramisu. Both delicious!!!! I still have a few  menu items to try from here before I exit the state. So far this has been my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.
2020-05-13,5,I ordered COVID takeout tonight: ready in 20 minutes, absolutely delicious and stuffed. Had some cold white bean salad and the giant meatball with pasta. Really good.
2020-04-27,4,Have been going to Otto Strada for a few years now, and it never disappoints.Their regular menu has a ton of of our favorite dishes (the type that you can only get here if you're craving it), with specials that are always changing & being updated.We ordered take-out for the first time (we usually opt to eat there as the atmosphere is small/cozy/fun) during the COVID quarantine, and everything was delicious...not to mention it was ready incredibly quickly.Whenever our friends/family visit from out of town, this is one of the places they demand to go.
2020-03-23,5,In a city filled with good Italian restaurants, this one is definitely one of my favorites. It's slightly pricier than some of the others but you get what you pay for - it's definitely better quality and I've never had a bad meal here. Plus it's BYOB! It's really popular so be prepared for an hour wait or more on a Friday night. But they will open your wine for you as you wait outside. And it's worth the wait!!
2020-03-17,5,Ordered takeout during the COVID-19 quarantine and this was DELICIOUS. We ordered the linguine with red pepper pesto and the veal tortellini with the kale Caesar salad. On top of that, they included a free dessert in the order! We are trying our best to support local businesses during this time, and I am so glad we picked this one.
2020-03-14,5,The food here is amazing! All I hear are good things and this did not disappoint. This place is byob.
2020-03-14,5,This place is so good! It's BYOB as well! I went with a friend on a Thursday night around 8 and we had no wait! Service was quick and the food tasted amazing! The ambiance is great as well with darker lighting and candles.
2020-03-07,5,I absolutely love this place. I've been a few times and really enjoyed both times. The angry muscles are delicious. Definitely something you have to try if eat at Otto Strada.
2020-01-22,4,This place is really great.. food was delicious and I'd go back. For some reason I can't say that I LOVE this place... but it was good... it held its own. I would recommend an early reservation (5:30) because it does get packed like other reviewers say. Then you feel bad ordering dessert because you see all the people waiting to sit down. My boyfriend and I love tiramisu and we had a gift card to spend... so we had to order it. Oops! Lol... Was very good, but different than typical tiramisu. We also love mussels (we get it everywhere) and the sauce wasn't our favorite. The sauce was good but just not with the mussels... felt disconnected. The mussels themselves were delicious and not sandy at all. He got the Beef and Veal Tortellini which I didn't try and I had the Orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. It was good... that ricotta salata on top made the dish! Overall.. the place was good. Would I go out of my way to eat here? Nah...
2020-01-17,5,This place is awesome! Nice byob spot with really generous portion sizes. Great place for a date or small group of friends. Hidden gem in Hoboken.
2020-01-16,5,my favorite restaurant in hoboken. the fact that they dont take reservations grinds my gears but i still have waited almost two hours but it was still worth it. get the veal / beef tortellini with parm cream sauce and balsamic (sounds weird but one of the best things ive ever eaten). oh and its BYOB so definitely bring a bottle or two or three :-)
2020-01-11,1,Called on Saturday night to check wait times for 4 people. Was told one hour. Asked to be put in the wait list over the phone. Nope, had to be done in person.  15 minutes later at the restaurant was told the wait would be 1.5 hours. Called an hour later and was told another 35-40 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. It was January!!!  Went to Anthony David's. Had a great dinner. Otto Stada called 2.5 hours after I put my name in the wait list to say table was available. Really?!! ‍
2019-12-24,5,Dopeness!Started with a meatball, and after the meat was gone I was literally eating the sauce with a spoon...Somewhat embarrassing but well worth it!Got the orichette con broccoli rabe. Boom!My gal got the chicken limonchella, despite the fact that she hates lemon she loves it!!!BYO wineDon't miss out if you're in the boken!
2019-12-11,5,Really! As good as it gets. We ́ve lived in Hoboken for over 5 years and only last week was our first time here. I can ́t believe it took us this long to eat here. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Our daughter is allergic to a bunch of things and our server made a huge effort to combine a few things to make it work for her.EVERYTHING we order was absolutely amazing. The meatball sliders were surprisingly tender and delicious. The bun, the meatball and cheese all cooked to perfection. Even the arugula salad was great. We also shared the inside out calzone that was very light and juicy.The panetone french toast was light as air and filled with flavor. Quite a surprise!! I will come back soon for sure. There is no way they can keep up with that kind of service and quality of food. I am determined to try their entire menu to find a flaw in this place.
2019-12-01,5,Incredible service and cuisine at Otto Strada.  First time dining here and will become regulars for sure!  Recently moved here from Seattle and trying out local spots.  This one is a must.  Excellent brunch as well as lunch time entrees.  Dinner will be our next visit.  The twist on the Caesar salad with Kale was really really good.  Loved our entrees as well!
2019-12-01,4,Great little byob gem in Hoboken. Boyfriend and I went for our anniversary, which fell on a Tuesday and this place was PACKED. It smells delicious the moment you walk in. They do not take reservations so we had to wait about 30-40mins to get seated. The place is small so felt bad when we were waiting that we were kind of on top of the other guests tables. But moving along to the food, it was delicious! You can tell this is made from scratch and everything we got was just so good. We got the crostini di burrta e pomodori to start, which was excellent. For our entrees we got pastas, tortellaci di manzo e vitallo(for me) and the house special pasta campanelle cremsoso(for boyfriend). My dish was good, but my boyfriends pasta really was the star of the night!! We loved that pasta and really hope they make it part or their actual menu because it was so delicious and we would love to have it when we do go back. Planning to return soon and have a nice dinner again with a bottle of wine.
2019-12-01,5,BEST ITALIAN FOOD EVER!!!!! Every single thing I have ordered from here has absolutely blown my mind - I dream about their Capellini con Pancetta! They have limited space in the restaurant but any wait is absolutely worth it (there's a reason there's always a wait!) Seriously the best restaurant in Hoboken.
2019-11-30,5,As far as I'm concerned, Otto Strada is the best restaurant in Hoboken and without doubt the best Italian food in Hoboken.Last night I had the Smoky Guanciale Campanella special with sweet onions, white wine, smoky paprika, guanciale, garlic, evoo, and burrata. Awesome dish but very rich. I needed pasta on a cold night so it was perfect.In the past I've had the Capellini with pancetta, brussel sprouts, and porcini mushrooms and it's an amazing dish. The Bolognese is outstanding. Another special was a creamy pasta with mushrooms and truffles, which was unsurprisingly wonderful.Prices are incredibly reasonable, and it's BYOB. There's a reason why it's always as crowded as it is. This place doesn't mess around.
2019-11-02,3,Came here for dinner with my bro. Such a cozy restaurant. For our appetizer we got the grilled octopus. Omg sooo good WHAT! For the entree, bro got the tortellaci di manzo e vitello. This was sooo yummy!I got the spicy squid pasta. Now I've had spicy Italian pasta before and my tolerance is pretty high, but this... this was ridiculous. Like Korean food level of spicy. It's like the chef was trying to prove a point here. The guy across from me had ordered the same and was sniffling and sweating throughout his meal. At one point his wife/gf reached across to ask if mine was as spicy & I was like girl, it may not show but I'm in pain eating this. Wish Otto Strada had level of heat indicated in the menu like other restaurants typically do.Otto Strada, no one expects flaming hot tamale or duok bokki level spiciness in an Italian restaurant, okay? Let's get that straight please, amici!
2019-10-14,5,Visited for the first time yesterday and will definitely be returning! Staff was attentive and friendly - food was delicious! It's nice to find a local Italian place with really good food - and byob!
2019-10-11,3,Everyone raves about this restaurant. I think the food is good, but I wish they would move to a bigger location! I really don't like the atmosphere here. You are crammed in like sardines... There is no decor... Blah.
2019-10-08,1,Let me start by saying that my experience was fine when I went to eat on Friday night. It was a bit chilly but not enough to keep people from sitting outside.. I was one of those people. I got the mussels to start and a pasta dish for dinner. I was there with a friend and we split the bill. I check my bank account today and to my surprise, looks like they took more than double what my bill was!!! Thieves!!   I can't believe my eyes to see my card was charged so much. I don't understand how my bill was in the $30's and they pulled $72 from my bank account. I will never return to a restaurant where the waiter or whomever thought that was ok to steal from their customers?!
2019-09-27,3,A solid BYOB Italian option in Hoboken. The service was great, and the food was good. We started with a meat and cheese board. Delicious and well-balanced!I had a gnocchi dish. It was fine, could have been more flavorful. I'd return and try something else. Other dishes at our table were good.
2019-09-22,4,I was really excited to try Otto Strada based on their reviews. Overall, they did not disappoint. There was an hour wait for a table for two at 8:30pm on a Friday, which makes sense given that they don't accept reservations, but it was a little frustrating and definitely an area they could improve. There were a lot of options on the menu that looked delicious, but my boyfriend and I decided to try the crispy prosciutto pizza and mussels. The mussels were fantastic (the sauce was especially good) but the pizza could've been better. The goat cheese was amazing, but the sauce they used on the pizza was a little bland and tasted a little cheap. We shared an entree (the carbonara) and it was exceptional, though it was brought out a little early (we weren't sure if they were trying to rush us or it was just made quickly). For dessert, we tried the tiramisu, and it far exceeded expectations. Overall, the food was great and there are only a few small things they need to improve on in order to get five stars.
2019-09-21,5,Came to Otto Strada for a friends birthday brunch. George was amazing, we had a custom menu and had very attentive service throughout our brunch. The food was amazing! I had the Burrata appetizer which was delicious, the tomatoes were fresh and the whole dish was very flavorful. For my main course I had the Bucatini Carbonara, it was delicious and very filling. The icing on the cake was that the restaurant is BYOB which kept the bill very reasonable.Overall the service was exceptional and I will definitely be back! Thank you George for making this such a great brunch!
2019-09-19,5,We got a pizza with cooked prosciutto and a pasta with a roasted tomato. The dessert was also phenomenal! The place is BYO, so bring a bottle of wine to enjoy this amazing food!
2019-09-15,5,This place is great! Although a bit small, their food selection is wonderful and the chef even offered to make something for us off the menu! We were looking for a chicken franchise and there was a lemon chicken on the menu so he told the chef and arranged exactly what we wanted!  The service was fantastic and the serving sizes are huge (i ate my leftovers for another 2 meals!) If you're looking for a great Italian restaurant in Hoboken this has to be the place.
2019-09-10,1,Simply not good. We came here one night instead of our usual Margherita's. The curb appeal gave it a better draw, but that's about where any favorability ends. The rest was strictly inferior. The noise in the dining area had the decibel level of a Washington Street bar on a Friday. I wouldn't have been able to distinguish a siren alarm over that ruckus. When it came to service, we had all of two minutes of face time with our waiter that night. To call getting our orders taken and water glasses refilled a struggle would be a euphemism. In regards to the food, when the spinach came out, it seemed that they fished it from a vat of oil. My fish entree was a dry overcooked lump that I could barely swallow. By this point I had just wanted the check, but to have been able to quickly over pay for such a poor experience would have been too merciful, so we waited another 20 minutes until the check was delivered. Otto Strada is BYOB, a perk much needed for any diner that would endure it's torture, and we observed plenty of tables with a number of bottles equal to they're party size. This may have explained the incessant noise, but regardless, I was envious for not having the presence of mind to do the same. In the end, after enduring Otto Strada sober, we don't particularly enjoy or recommend the place, but hey, maybe after 5 glasses of wine, it might taste good.
2019-09-08,2,A mediocre at best Italian to be food restaurant. Takes place more like a deli style decor with pizza with Nutella and some salt-a-like meatball and over cooked pasta. Not sure what is that they are trying to achieve.
2019-09-03,5,Otto Strada is situated on a quiet stretch in Uptown Hoboken. Dining al fresco is certainly the way to go here in the late summer and early fall months when the weather is just right. We arrived on a Thursday and was pleased to see it was not too crowded. This place gets jam packed on the weekends and Fridays so be forewarned. The service was professional yet friendly very befitting of a neighborhood joint. The food was out of this world. WE started off with a type of basil burrata salad which was fresh, light and decadent. We followed that up with a pork ragu with fresh pasta. This might have been the best item of the night. The deep flavor of the sauce clearly displayed an understanding of classic Italian American cooking. Our last dish was a type of lemon chicken, served with potatoes and spinach, again the sauce was tasty, and the dish was light, fresh and delicious. Even if the wait time is long I would recommend giving it a go and making sure you do not miss this spot.
2019-09-02,4,Food here is really tasty. Service is also very friendly. It's BYOB so it's a plus. I would go for the pastas. The pizza was good but the pasta sauces are much better. A great spot to check out
2019-08-31,5,This is a very great hidden treasure in Hoboken if you have not tried Otto Strada yet. Delicious and fresh every single time! It is also BYOB so that is a plus as well. Love the pizza!
2019-08-18,3,This place is definitely overrated. It's just another Italian BYOB. The service was pretty bad when I went on a Saturday night. The food was ok. My gnocchi wasn't great. My friend got the octopus which was pretty good. They also messed up our order and the check. With so many restaurants in Hoboken and NYC, this place wasn't worth the hassle.
2019-08-10,4,Dig the night vibes here, had an amazing night weather wise last night so had the pleasure of sitting outdoors. It's romantically quiet here as well and if you listen carefully, you can here a symphony of different parts of the world gathered here(here other speaking different languages). They even have real vines and wine grapes hanging from the top of the outside patio seating area that yes you can eat!Super dope, food is solid. We had the octopus for appetizer and ordered the Margherita pizza and the cioppino for the mains but shared everything. Octopus had great texture and loved the tomato and bean salsa like sauce and mixture they plated it together with. The pizza was good, sauce and cheese was perfecto! But I actually prefer my pizza crust alittle crunchier but awesome otherwise. Cioppino was ok, best part were the huge clamsPrice points fair, service a bit confusing as you get a team of them coming your way, atleast out on the balcony but it was good, just confusing on who to ask if you need anythingCheck em out!
2019-08-09,2,Have been wanting to try this restaurant for quite some time! Came here this evening- waited for one hour to finally be seated and completely disappointed with the food quality! We ordered the angel hair pasta with Brussel sprouts which looked boiled and barely cooked and pasta want homemade although advertised and super salty. We then ordered another pasta dish with goat cheese but came out as a pork pasta dish! I am a vegetarian and didn't realize I was eating pork till the staff came and corrected the dish. The pasta I actually ordered was completely bland and even kraft mac and cheese tastes better. Service was slow and one of the waiters said our dessert would be free in addition to take the pork dish off the menu. Pasta was comped- dessert was not. Stick to Anthony David's or Napolis for Italian food in Hoboken. Whilst it's a cute ambience it's totally overrated
2019-08-07,4,I've been trying to go here for so long and finally on a super humid evening, because I was willing to sit outside, I was able to finally go! Love that it's BYO as well :) Smashed burrata and prosciutto was AMAZING - highly recommend.I got the pulled bork pappardelle and I would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. It was a huge portion with plenty of pulled pork and super filling. The sauce stuck to the pasta so well and the pasta was cooked perfectly.Boyfriend got the bisteca and it was really overcooked, but they took it off the bill so that was really nice! Super pleased with the service - we always had water, the owner came to say hello, and the server was just attentive enough.
2019-08-04,4,Was passing through Hoboken and decided to stop here looking for some authentic Italian at a place i could dress casually in the summer. Was not disappointed. I had the seafood stew and my gf had the meatball. We also had an arugula salad to start. The portions were all huge and the prices were reasonable.  My gf works in Hoboken so we look forward to making future trips there when I'm in the area as all the pastas looked excellent as well. I wish we had more restaurants that had portions this size in NYC!
2019-07-28,4,Excellent choice for Italian in Hoboken. The place is small but very welcoming, service was excellent. There is usually a queue but if you go earlier or later it should not be more than 15-20 minutes. Has the smashed burrata which was superb. Veal tortellacci was incredible, the sauce is made to perfection. It is a little on the expensive side and the portions are not big, but if you can look past that it's well worth a visit!
2019-07-27,5,I'll start by saying that, as other commenters have noted, this place gets very busy very quickly. We came at 5:40pm on a Saturday, were seated immediately, and the place looked half empty, but like clockwork at 6pm, a ton of people came in and it was packed until we left around 7pm. It would help if they took reservations.That said, the food is great and I love that they're BYOB. The service was also prompt, and the prices are fair for the food they give you.
2019-07-27,5,Love love love this place ! This place never fails . I always get the kale Cesar salad with grilled shrimp !
2019-07-25,4,We came here for dinner on a Thursday. We didn't have a reservation but we arrived late (almost 9pm) and were seated promptly.We ordered the Polpetta, mafaldine bolognese and orecchiette (special of the day).The dishes came to the table super hot (extra points here), they came all together and looked really good.Polpetta is huge (can be shared) and I would say good but not awesome, the tomato sauce was great.Bolognese was really good, good size for one very hungry person and pasta cooked perfectly.Orecchiette was awesome and can be shared. Super tasty, not too much butter and very delicate flavor. I will definitely order this one again.
2019-07-21,5,I had been wanting to try Otto Strada for a while now, especially since it is nearby to my apartment. But with so many Italian options in Hoboken, it took me longer than it should have. This place is definitely worth a try not just because the food is amazing, but it also has more than the "traditional" Italian dishes we all love. Our table started with the mussels, which were delicious and something you don't always see on menus. For my entree, I got the red pepper pesto linguini - AMAZING! It was so tasty, and the portion was big enough for me to bring home leftovers. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try. I tasted my sister's gnocchi dish and was really impressed. This place is also BYOB, which is always a plus. The restaurant is small, but I was impressed how short our wait time was for a party of 5 with no reservation. I'll definitely be coming back.
2019-07-15,4,Awesome neighborhood Italian spot that's BYOW. I love the smashed burrata with prosciutto, honey, and balsamic-- it's delicious! The food is good for the local spot but the wait can get up to an hour or more sometimes so it makes you not want to wait... sadly, the last time we were there, there were open tables for 10minutes+ while groups of people were waiting outside (including me). I kinda lost my appetite when I was staring at several open tables for 15mins+... and then a rude family just sat down at the tables while the rest of the whole block waited patiently. Please attend to your patrons first come first serve, we notice.On another note, the burrata is freaking delicious. Everything else we've had... it was fine. Nothing amazing but the patio seating and BYOB makes it more tolerable.
2019-07-14,5,Excellent food. I recommend the 16 oz meatball and the pizza. All of the pasta is homemade too. sauce makes it all that much better. I also love that its BYOB. Very freindly owner and service, feels like 'family' in there. great outdoor seating in the warmer season as well.
2019-07-06,5,We just moved from Manhattan and were looking for a great Italian spot in our new area. Needless to say, we have to look no further. Everything we ordered was amazing and everything that came out to other diners also looked phenomenal. We started with a personal Margherita pizza and an arugula salad. Both were great but left us with hardly any room for our entrees! (Portions are large!) For the main course, I had the 16oz meatball with pasta (I swear there has to be a 90 year old Italian Nonna back there because it tastes like Sunday dinners when I was a kid) and my husband ordered chicken parm with a side of pasta with red pepper pesto. This was a combination of items on the menu and they were more than willing to accommodate. His was also very good. We didn't get to try to dessert because we had no room for it. Our waiter was excellent and the owner--who also seats the guests--came by at the end of our meal for a quick chat. All around, this was a cozy, wonderful find that left our bellies very full in the center of Hoboken. We will definitely be back!
2019-07-05,4,Love this place!  Great for dinner with family or with friends.  Delicious Italian food, including great homemade pasta, especially the bucatini carbonara (heavy, but worth every bite!) There aren't many tables, so if you can eat early you'll get a table more quickly. It's also BYO!
2019-07-01,5,Wow! This place is great! The hospitality is as good as it can possibly be, our food came out at a VERY reasonable time, and it was DELICIOUS! I love it so so so much and can't wait until I can go again! Thanks Otto Strada!
2019-06-25,3,Otto strata is a good Italian BYOB within walking distance of where I live.  I appreciate that the decor is simple but rustic and modern at the same time, but what really counts is the food.  So we've had food there more than 10 times-both take out and in-person, and it's been consistently good.  Here are the pro's and con's for those visits/experiences:Pro's: it's byob, they have real Italian dishes, the portions aren't small, the desserts are amazing, the service is decent, their giant meatball is epic, and their pizzas are decentCons:  it can get super packed/be a long wait no matter what night you come on (as I'm writing this islets Tuesday night and completely packed inside and out), the focaccia they were is meh, some of the pasta dishes are good, some miss the mark, and the specials are usually slim (in terms of number), and fairly pricey, and the inside can get very very loud (so a no-go if you're trying to come in and have a quiet romantic dinner).All in all, decent food, solid service-it's worth it for you to drop by (better yet-order take out!).
2019-06-22,5,After reading the positive reviews about Otto Strada on Yelp, I decided to order delivery.  I had the Tortellaci di Manzo e Vitello.  The delivery did take a long time- about an hour.  But my food did show up, the delivery person was kind, and my food was warm.  The sauce was flavorful and I was also able to taste the pasta.If you're looking for plain pasta with minimal sauce, this isn't the restaurant for you.  Also if you're dining in at any restaurant and there is a table for four and you are a party of two, the party of four is going to get that table.  It's only fair.  A lot of restaurants do it.The food is wonderful and worth a try.
2019-06-22,5,We couldn't possibly love Otto Strada any more than we do! My husband and I have been coming here for years, before we moved to Hoboken and became fortunate enough to have Otto be our neighborhood favorite. The food is exceptionally fresh, flavorful, and delicious, and always consistent, and the portions are generous. We've never been disappointed by any item on the menu, and at this point we've tried them all! Our favorites include the salmon, broccoli rabe, bee sting pizza, orecchiette, red pepper pesto pasta, and of course, the amazing 1 pound meatball! Don't leave without trying the cannoli cones or tiramisu for dessert. Everyone who works here is absolutely lovely, and we really feel like family whenever we pay them a visit. Otto Strada is a true neighborhood treasure!
2019-06-16,4,I'd give them 5 stars for service, 4 stars for food...everyone is great, but Omar and George are the best...definitely try porkchop...amazing!!!!
2019-06-15,4,Accommodating staff...friendly atmosphere...pasta dishes generous portions...went on Saturday night...bustling...good neighborhood place
2019-06-12,5,All I want is to be buried in Otto Strada's Tortelacci.
2019-05-27,5,Honestly , I have never been here without leaving with a having stellar meal ( and my company always confirms it) Even better it is BYOB zap bring your favorite wine . I have had everything from the special lobster Ravioli to the Kale Caesar . This time it was the spaghetti and meatball and the mussels ( and the pepperoni pizza too) You can't go wrong here
2019-05-19,4,5 stars for presentation/ambience/host service, but 4 star for flavors and table service. I loved the burrata crostini, which was gone before I could snap a picture but I was disappointed in both pasta dishes the Bolognese and Lasagna. The pastas were a bit too soft and the sauces were not impressive. I want to try the arugula salad since that seemed to be a popular order as well as the pizza.I think our waiter forgot about us towards the end of our meal as we had to scramble to ask other staff to get the check.
2019-05-12,3,I really wanted to give this restaurant five stars but for Mothers Day brunch at $42 price fixed the food was ok.. it started well delicious clams, burrata was tasty, odd appetizer of grilled corn, stuffed peppers were ok. I ordered chicken thighs over polenta it was cool, the pizza with burrata and zucchini flowers was good also not hot. The two desserts were just ice cream nothing fancy. I think they should re think the price fixed menu it was not worth the $
2019-04-27,5,This place is cute outside with a trellis and outdoor seating! Caught my attention. Inside is small but quaint. We stopped in to have lunch. I love Italian! We started with the BLT crostini and ordered the Tartufo pizza and Prosciutto E asparagi pizza. Everything was delicious! The BLT crostini had a perfect crunch, fresh arugula, perfectly cooked bacon, fresh tomato. Flavors blended great. The prosciutto and asparagus pizza was delicious. I love the fresh basil. The tomato sauce was good. 9/10 for that pizza. The crust on both folded perfect. The Tartufo is EXCELLENT!! The truffle oil is delicious and the mushrooms with prosciutto and cheeses...wow! Highly recommend the Tartufo. The service here was great too! And prices aren't bad. We will be back to try more.
2019-03-28,2,I took clients to dinner here. The meal felt forced and servers continuously came to the table in hopes of collecting a plate to quickly push to us to the end the meal. I get that they probably feel the need to turn tables over quickly, because it's a byob and that amount is not made up for with time spent at the table. However, it really takes away from the experience. The servers stared at me as I took up table space post the meal as I waited for a cork to place back in the wine bottle. The whole atmosphere was not one I'd like to experience again. First and last visit marked.
2019-03-17,5,Went to Otto Strada on Sunday at noon for brunch and it was AMAZING! Since they don't take reservations I called ahead of time to check if there was a wait, and luckily by the time I arrived there were tables available however when we left at 1pm there were folks waiting outside to be seated. Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious. From the meatball sliders, to the Milanese caprese sandwich, included with the side salad and potatoes, everything was 100%. It was our first time there and we already decided we'll need to go back multiple times to try everything we want on the menu. Possibly order out for dinner tonight? I just went a second time and got brunch, and wanted to include some photos below! Went with my boyfriend at 11am at Sunday and we were the first to arrive for the day. We got the breakfast panini with side potatoes and salad which was phenomenal, and eggs Benedict with the same sides which was pretty good. It was very heavy on the spinach, and don't get me wrong I love spinach, but next time I plan to get the panini. We got an additional side order of the maple glazed sausage and it was delicious if you like sweet sausage.
2019-03-11,2,Food was great, terrible wait list process. I walked in put my name for two on the list and was told the wait would be about 30 min. A 4 person table was open at the time, 40 min later that same table was open, i was told the hostess couldn't pull the table apart and seat us and another couple who have been waiting for 40 min. Being they don't take a reservation I couldn't understand why the table was being held. A friend of mine walks in with his party of 4 and they immediately get sat at the 4 person table despite not being on the list. They should seat you based on the list and when you arrive and not hold a table for the chance a party of 4 walks in. Seat customers who are already in your restaurant and have been waiting if a table is open when you don't take reservations.
2019-03-02,4,We came As a group before on a Friday night. We put our name down around 6:30 and we were told it would be about an hour wait. At 7:30 we came back and there was still another group of four ahead of us. This is a very small restaurant so there is not a lot of room to stand around and wait for your table, it gets very uncomfortable. We finally got seated around 745. We sat at our table for a good 10 minutes before our server came over to us. We actually had to get up and go ask if someone could come over and open our wine (it's BYOB, definitely a plus). George was our server. He made good recommendations and our food came out very quickly. Every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious And the portions are generous. I would give this place five stars however our server never came back to check on us while we were eating. We were missing a pizza that we had ordered as an appetizer but we had so much other food that we didn't want it anymore. We had to ask two different bus boys to open our second bottle of wine but neither of them came back to do so. Finally we were able to flag down George to open the second bottle of wine and that's when we told him that our pizza never came out. This lack of services as pretty annoying. Yes they were very busy but it's such a small place that a server should be able to check on their tables. It seems a lot of the staff spent a lot of time behind the counter area. The food is seriously amazing here though and I love BYOB places so I would recommend this restaurant and will definitely be back. Hopefully the service situation was just a fluke that night and will be better next time.
2019-02-19,5,Incredible authentic Italian cuisine. This small, romantic restaurant did everything right. Started with a special appetizer, smashed burrata. The burrata was perfectly creamy and fresh. Our entree's were cooked to perfection, big portions, and just delicious. The tiramisu is to die for, but I recommend letting the waiter know ahead of time that you'd like to have a piece because they often run out. Everything is home made and I am being completely honest when I say this is my favorite restaurant of all time. There is limited seating and always a wait so definitely call ahead to get a better idea of your wait time. Oh and I almost forgot, like most restaurants in Hoboken, it's BYOB. Luckily, there's a little liquor store across the street. I 1000000% recommend this place! Best Italian food I've ever had, and I'm Italian!
2019-02-09,5,Cozy Italian spot in Hoboken with amazing service and food. There's a lot of Italian food in Hoboken and this place does it right. Everything from hand made pasta to dessert pizza. A must try if you're in this area!
2019-02-04,5,Update: went there for brunch and it was amazing!! The pizza with mushrooms, basil, mozzarella, Romano, truffle oil, and fried egg was delicious! The table next to us ordered it and it looked so good that we had to ask what they had ordered. Probably one of the best iced espressos I have ever had. Very friendly wait staff and really quick service, yet they do not rush you if you want to take your time! Will definitely be returning!
2019-02-01,5,My second visit! Light bite on a very cold Thursday night- it was so nice and they had a number for local delivery for a bottle of wine. We ordered assorted cheese and meat, and the eggplant parm. Perfect to share- everything was delicious.
2019-01-28,5,This is a nice hidden find in Hoboken.  Been here twice both times food and service was on par.  Place is very reasonably priced and BYOB.  Owner Nick was a very nice guy.   Be prepared to wait on a weekend!! The meatball, smashed burrata, and veal chop were amazing!
2019-01-23,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Slightly off the beaten path, Otto Strada is absolutely worth seeking out.The staff and owner were very accommodating. The restaurant was BYOB, and they offered us a wine bottle the previous patrons left behind at the table since we did not have any. They did not have to do that, but they did!The daily specials were full of terrific pasta dishes. I had linguine with a tomato/cream sauce that was so well done. The star of the meal though was our appetizer. For $18 we got a large amount of ricotta cheese and infused olive oils. They were all tasty, particularly the lemon crisp and my favorite the pepper and truffle. I will order this every time its available.For dessert we split the mezzo luna. Its akin to a nutella pizza but also includes butter inside. By the way, it is BIG. Definitely share!
2019-01-06,5,Great food, atmosphere and staff. I have eaten here several times and the food has always been fresh and good. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. One of the best restaurants in Hoboken.
2019-01-01,5,Otto Strada definitely stands out among all the Italian joints in Hoboken.  We started off our meal with a delicious cheese plate featuring four cheese combinations.  Our favorite was the fontina cheese covered in truffle oil and pumpkin seeds, which we had to fight each other for.  We also had the mussels special which came with a spicy and flavorful broth that we soaped up with our bread.  Based on what I read from other reviews, I ordered the tortellini stuffed with beef and veal which did not disappoint.  The tortellini came with a creamy cheese sauce and a drizzle of balsamic which made my taste buds sing.  I would definitely recommend to friends and return myself!The restaurant is also BYOB which is always plus but do make reservations or arrive early if you can.
2018-12-30,5,My cousin lives in this neighborhood and we had such a fun night out. We had the whole family together. Brought our wine and beer and enjoyed appetizer after appetizer. The meatball to share is a must. All the pasta dishes were light fresh and we shared them all. The canoli in a cone and the tiramisu were delicious. We enjoyed meeting the staff who were great and very friendly.
2018-12-29,5,Had our Christmas party of 30 and everyone was satisfied. The owner operated business is none short of the best I have seen in the biz. The staff were all attentive and made you feel at home . The food was extraordinary and not one complaint. Great job to the owner Nick !!!! Will definitely be back again
2018-12-26,5,Otto Strada is probably one of the best or the best place to try in Hoboken.  I don't live close by, but its worth the trip. You will not be dissapointed  The service and the food is exceptional.  We have eaten there several times and the food selections get better and better. Everything is fresh, and the portions are plentiful. From the apps to the main course to the desserts you will leave full and leftovers to take home for the next day.
2018-12-26,5,I don't typically write yelp reviews but the service and quality of food really impressed me. We had a Christmas party with 30+ guests and they were nothing short of prepared and well equipped to handle the volume. We were all beyond satisfied with our food and not one person had something bad to say about the experience. Thank you to the owner, Nick, for a job well done. Your leadership and staff are quickly rising to be one of the best of Hoboken's many restaurants.
2018-12-21,4,Great restaurant, love that it is BYOB. We went and ordered the octopus, definitely recommend. It felt like a traditional Italian restaurant.
2018-11-14,1,If I could give no stars I would. The food was terrible! The mussels were overcooked and dry. The "special" ravioli made of squid ink pasta with some sort of lobster sauce was terrible. There was to much sauce and then the placed a COLD scoop of butter in the middle of the plate that made the whole dish cold. My husband's dish was covered with so much sauce you could not tell what it was supposed to be. Terrible. Would never recommend this place.
2018-11-08,4,A perfect spot for lunch or dinner, Otto Strada is beautiful in and out. This location is BYOB, as many restaurants are in the city of Hoboken. I ordered a special Carbonara dish which was spectacular. I was incredibly happy with the flavors of my dish, it was well balanced. My bf ordered a chicken dish, served on a bed of arugula. It was also fantastic! The service was my only downside, I struggled to get the attention of our waiter. Regardless, I'll be back soon!
2018-10-29,5,Awesome place for Italian food.  BYOB.  2nd time we been there.  I would definitely go back again.
2018-10-28,4,My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night, the spot is super cozy and a great date night place. The restaurant is small and was crowded when we got there, our table was almost in the middle of the room and the staff was nice enough to move us to nicer table. We ordered the olive oil appetizer, 4 different kinds of olive oil with ricotta cheese and crackers for $18. The oil was ok, nothing to write home about, probably would not order a second time and do not think it was worth the price. I ordered the chicken Milanese with the prosciutto, it was a nice size meal for the prize, my boyfriend ordered the Bolognese which he said was good. Our options were good but we were not blown away by them, presentation was also very nice! Would definitely come back here for the cozy atmosphere and to try other dishes!
2018-10-13,1,Terrible food. Pasta is just drowned in sauce   The pasta was good but ruined. Ask for sauce on the side
2018-09-30,5,Food, Service, atmosphere and prices all come together for this Hoboken gem!  Chicken Milanese perfect for lunch
2018-09-25,4,We had a couples date night here. Amazing experience and very accommodating staff. The weather was acting funny however, we still asked to sit outside. After much drizzle the staff kindly sat us inside. It's a bring your own beverage place so very cool.We started off with amazing appetizers. I definitely recommend the Smashed Burrata and Prosciutto which is fresh burrata smashed on top of prosciutto, topped with extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, fresh herbs and sea salt. Absolutely mouth watering!We also ordered the Gambero Cotto Su Legno which is brick oven baked shrimp on a cedar plank covered in a parsley pesto sauce; made with italian parsley, zest of lemon, garlic and olive oil. And Salami E Verdure which is cured meats, roasted vegetables, pickled vegetables and marinated olives.I ordered the Bistecca Alla Pizzaiola which is a ribeye steak that is pan seared, sauteed in a sauce made of olive oil, garlic, caramelized sweet onions, red wine, san marzano tomatoes and Italian parsley; comes with toasted focaccia bread and a side of sautéed spinach in garlic and olive oil.
2018-09-20,3,This little place is stunning!! The menu has great selection for everyone and all the apps are perfectly shareable. The quality is definitely there in all the dishes especially the brucettas, so delicious!!Since the space is small all the tables are closely packed and it's very busy most nights. Besides, that the decor is beautiful and is perfect for date night. Also the waiter gave us table pepper when we asked for red pepper flakes. Service is a little slow.
2018-09-09,4,Great options on the standard menu and really great dishes on the special board. We split a few appetizers which were all very good. Grilled shrimp, smashed burrata and prosciutto, and stuffed Italian long horns. I recommend trying them all. For entrees, I'd recommend sticking with the pastas and parms. I tried a few bites of the meat dishes and they were just ok. Overall, give Otto Strada a try. It's one of the best Italian restaurants around. Great job chef!
2018-08-28,5,A delicious twist on traditional italian.  The mussels special appetizer is unreal, seriously I need to know how to make the cajun broth.  Tortellini dish and the red pepper pesto linguine are amazing.  If you come during dinner rush hours on the weekend, you are going to have a wait and without a bar to sit at it's not an ideal situation.
2018-08-15,5,Amazing place...the bruschetta appetizer, pollo limoncello and amaretto tiramisu were all to die for! Love that it is byob and not on Washington Street!Service was fast and friendly...food actually comes out hot and on time! A great addition to Hoboken, I will definitely be going back ASAP
2018-08-12,1,Terrible service! Hostess unorganized and not helpful or welcoming. Management only concerned about getting people out rather than making sure they had a great meal and ensure that the customer comes back! We won't!!
2018-08-10,5,By far my best restaurant in Hoboken . REAL authentic "gravy" sauce for those that know !! Service was absolutely amazing ! Had the Burrata appetizer and the special of the day  Nanno's mussels .. out of this world. No words can describe the HUGE meatball it was so delicious . 2 of us ate it and still had to some to take home ! Eggplant was everything I expected and more !!! We force our stomach to make room for the dessert ... best cannoli I had since Brooklyn ! We will be back on Tuesday .. today is Friday
2018-08-02,5,We had a great time here. We sat outside and I was worried that we may be forgotten in the dinner rush, but that was not the case! Waiters were very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested good appetizers while we waited for our food.Ordered the salami e verdure to start and each ordered a personal pizza. Great food, good portions, attentive staff, and a lovely seating area outside! Highly recommend for a date night or visiting with friends.
2018-07-18,5,Highly recommend this place!! If you want an authentic Hoboken feel restaurant with delicious Italian food and great service this is your go to place in Hoboken. The portions are perfect . Especially the 16oz meatball!! Which is great to share. Food is fresh. I recommend sitting outside on a nice night to get the full Hoboken feel and view of brownstones nearby.  All good came out in a timely manner. Staff had good suggestions on customer favorites to help with the overwhelmingly delicious menu options. Reasonably priced for portions, food type, freshness and atmosphere . Sometimes in Hoboken you can feel yourself over paying for the area but that is not the case at this hidden gem. I will most definitely be returning to try the pesto pasta , pizza, and cannoli cones !!
2018-06-30,5,I once said the the best Italian food is only a little bit better than Chef Boyardee.  Otto Strada sure proved me wrong. I had the Bucatini Alla Carbonara. Creamy and delicious. My fiancé had the Mafaldine Alla Bolognese.  Also delicious. They have pizza, pasta, and other dishes, so we are pretty enthusiastic about going back to try different things.  Nice staff. Clean, relaxed, BYOB environment. Even met the owner. If you want food that is a hundred times better than Chef Boyardee, this is the place.
2018-06-21,5,We had gone here for dinner. We had the roasted corn for appetizer, which tasted really good with the cheese. For the main course we had the pappardelle pasta which was a little bland. For the dessert we had a nutella brownie which was good but a little too thick. Overall this is a good Italian restaurant in Hoboken outside of Washington street.
2018-03-18,4,I had been dying to try Otto Strada ever since moving to Hoboken a few months ago, and I will definitely be returning!They definitely have a variety of dishes on their menu- I decided to go with a carbonara pasta and my friend ordered the bistecca alla pizzaiola (ribeye steak in red sauce). Although the steak was good, I feel that you really cannot go wrong with their pasta dishes. Coming from an Italian family that frequently makes homemade pasta, my standards are high. The buccatini alla carbonara passed the test. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the pancetta added a great flavor to the cream sauce. I will definitely be ordering this again when I return! The portions were large so I had leftovers for the next day.For dessert, we tried the pear robiola pizza. It wasn't terrible, but was sort of bland. I wouldn't order it again, especially for $16.I went to Otto Strada in December, so I obviously sat inside, but I'd like to go back in the spring when I can enjoy the outdoor seating. The fact that they are BYOB is also great because it is not a cheap dinner.
2018-02-26,4,Quality food. BYOB as well with a good menu. A place I would have no issue going if it was suggested, but not the type of place if I haven't been in a month I'd feel the urgent need to get my fix in.
2018-02-26,5,You can find me here every Sunday in food heaven - this is hands down the best modern Italian in the Hudson county area. They have an amazing brunch and dinner menu. Some of my favorites are the French toast, chicken Milanese, the assorted meat and cheese platter, grilled shrimp appetizer, and the truffle mushroom pasta. And if you like Nutella anything you know where to go. I'd give 6 stars if I could.
2018-02-17,1,First, the apps took forever.    They tried serving the entree while the apps were on the table.  The waiter assured me that he'd instructed the kitchen to make new main courses.   Yet as soon as the late apps were removed, cold entrees were served.  Stay away.   This place has horrible service and serves cold food.
2018-02-13,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken! Delicious pasta dishes and pizza.  They even have a giant meatball!! BYOB
2018-02-09,5,If you're looking for Italian & BYO this is your go to. From the meatball, to the pizzas, you can't go wrong. If I'm splurging the Tortellaci di manzo e vitello is never a disappointment! For apps besides the meatball the crostini di peperoni Rossi is fantastic!
2018-01-22,4,A great place in town for a date during the week, brought my better half who was  pregnant so they don't take reservations so we had to wait 30 min but it was a Saturday night during prime time, the worth was all worth it, it's quite small but your greeted by a friendly staff and we had Christopher who gave us some great recommendations, you definitely have to try their TORTELLACI DI MANZO $22 (Veal tortellini with their special cream sauce laced with balsamic), at first it looked like dessert and I thought they made the wrong order but after taking the first bite i knew I never tasted this before because their parmigiana reggiano cream sauce, we started with a margherita pizza ($12-$17)which was a great start and we also ordered the MALFALDINE ALL BOLOGNESE ($18) with penne pasta which my wife enjoyed, it seemed like a popular appetizer was the Meatball from Truglios which looked like it can feed 3-4 adults, it seemed too much for two, go early is my advise but it's worth a spot to check out if you can't get into Augustinos or Leos. Enjoy and mange!
2018-01-08,5,I am a vegetarian and so can speak for only a portion of their menu that I tried.  The red pepper pesto linguine is just outstanding.  It was so good that I order it every time from the special menu as a party order when I host some friends.  The stuffed sea shells were also yummy.  Place can get so crowded in the evenings but worth the wait.  Plus, it is BYB for now and so you end up a saving a bunch.This is currenlty my top rated Italian just for the red pepper pesto linguine
2017-12-29,5,This restaurant is awesome the only complaints I would have is the seating situation. Other than that this place has a great selection. Amazing service, all in all very satisfied.
2017-12-16,1,Extremely disappointed. Unprofessional. Rude. Took an order for delivery. An HOUR later call and say they won't deliver THEN send a note that the charge made to my card would take days and days to refund.  That's stealing. Your a piece of sh. t. You took the money , but don't deliver the food. Crooks. The worst example of Italian stereotypes.Note. Restaurant returned note saying they don't deliver to my area. Although they delivered to me at least 5 times prior.  They blamed the delivery service
2017-12-09,5,Really enjoyed our meal here tonight. The restaurant is small so the chances of having to wait for a table if you go during a busy time are high. We unfortunately sat at a table directly by the door so it was annoying having other customers standing right over our table. The whole time we had people standing literally on top of us. But the food was delicious and made up for it. Bruschetta was great along with the eggplant! Good service as well.
2017-11-11,1,Very disappointed - they told us 40 minutes for a table. We waited 40 minutes - then they seated others ahead of us and told us another 30-40 minutes. I doubt we'll ever go back.
2017-11-11,1,Told us over the phone the wait was 20-30 minutes tonight and that we had to be there and stay to keep the table so I sent my 10 yr old over, dropped off my in-laws to wait.  After 45 minutes, they said it would be another 30m, meanwhile a table ahead of us was allowed to leave and come back.  Very poor service - never got to eat!  It's a shame because it's place close to home and the family really liked the food last time...
2017-10-25,5,I've lived in Hoboken my entire life and this is hands-down the best Italian restaurant in town - Augustino's is great but it's impossible to get a table. The burrata crostini, grilled octopus, giant meatball and gnocchi are all excellent dishes, plus the place is BYOB!Anyone giving this place a bad review has nothing better to do but go on yelp and complain. How do you go to a small restaurant and complain that it's cramped, or that there's a wait?
2017-10-25,3,wishing yelp had half stars, so i could give this spot a 3.5. there were a few highs and some lows. my friend i got there around 6pm on tuesday night, definitely the right time to visit, it was empty and we got a table immediately. the highs: -the menu, its has a ton of variety. the appetizer, pizza and pasta options were a plenty! the mains were standard and limited. -the food, super tasty. i definitely recommend you get the buccatini carbonara, so rich and decadent it was my favorite of the night. we also had the veal tortellini and spicy pizza which were tasty too and server reco's.-BYOB, obvious   -price, you get a ton of food for the moneythe lows:-they didnt have the AC turned on, my friend and i basically sat and sweated buckets throughout our entire meal. when its +80 degrees out with almost 100% humidity, do us all a favor and turn it on! -the nats... unsure if these came in from the open windows and doors, but there were nats everwhere. two even wound up in my full glass of red wine. hoping this was due to heat and not something going on in the kitchen...-the nutella brownie, there was no sign of nutella anywhere, it was dense, heavy, fudgelike and $11... definitely skipi plan to come back here again and try some more items off the menu, especially the pizza and pasta!
2017-10-22,3,We heard a lot of good things about this place from our friends so we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant is pretty cute and nicely decorated.  We ordered several dishes: brussel sprout/mushroom (can't remember the rest) pasta, carbonara, octopus, salmon, and pork.  I thought the only delicious item that we got was the octopus and brussel sprouts.  The carbonara, salmon and pork dish wasn't too memorable.  The prices are on the higher end.
2017-10-01,3,Very mixed feelings on this place for me...The good: cozy atmosphere, byob, great menu and delicious food.  I got the carbonara and the tortellini and it was delicious... pasta was fresh, sauce creamy... great flavors.  We also got the spicy pizza which was def spicy but also delicious...I give the food a 4The bad: it was a very warm day and they kept the door open making the temp uncomfortable.  We were surrounded by nats that kept flying in our face and 2 ended up in our full glasses of wine.  If there were so many nats at the table it made us wonder what's going on in the kitchen.  We got the Nutella brownie for dessert and we had such high hopes after a delicious dinner.  The brownie was gross! I love a fudgy brownie but this brownie was literally like a hunk of fudge with very very sweet icing.  Didn't taste the Nutella... not worth the calories or money. I would try this place again but skip dessert... and if the nats are still a problem I'll prob never go back.
2017-09-21,4,Very good newer addition to central Hoboken.  Kind of an elevated pizzeria as they have a brick oven and make good pies but they have some very good Italian dishes as well that are worth attention. We split a prosciutto Margherita pie(very good), a spicy squid spaghetti dish(the seafood was good the pasta was slightly overdone), and a positano(perfect). Service was fine for the hour. Will be back.
2017-09-18,3,3 stars for food and 1star for service. 45 min wait so it must be good right? Two minutes after sitting down the waiter accidentally spilled scampi sauce down my back. He was very apologetic and came right over with seltzer water. The restaurant is tiny and jammed packed. When our actual waiter came over he seemed annoyed with us and did not tell us the specials. We placed our order and he came back to tell us they were out of eggplant pizza.  Instead we tried the veggie pie, gluten free pasta and a bunch of appetizers. The waiter could not seem to figure out how to serve the food and was annoyed with us when we asked for napkins or larger plates. The restaurant was not wildly busy and we asked politely. He then came out with the pizza and pasta and it was it was not gluten free. After asking and waiting the bill finally came and not a thing was comped they didn't even offer a dessert. Tomato and mozz were very thick slices and not good for sharing. Next came the shrimp. $18 for 6 grilled shrimp seems a big much. Pizza was good but nothing great. Brussels sprouts, asparagus, cauliflower and zucchini. Our favorite was the grilled corn. Restaurant was very cute, nice outdoor seating, byob and seems to have a good menu. Hopefully the next diners have a better experience!
2017-09-12,4,My husband and I have been 3 or 4 times over the past couple of months and have had a great experience each time! We love bringing our favourite bottle of red to drink with our food each time. Highly recommend the Crostini Di Burrata and Tortellacci Di Manzo - delicious every time!
2017-09-11,4,I had been hearing mixed reviews of Otto Strada since they first opened a few years ago, so I was not really in a rush to give it a try.  However, I recently met a fellow Hobokenite who raved about the place and insisted that she introduce me to it.  So, we made plans to meet for dinner, and she graciously brought along a bottle of wine, as the place is BYOB.  The casual dining room felt very homey and comfortable, despite our server who was not particularly attentive.  Aside from the focaccia bread was well-seasoned, but dry and not overly fresh, the food was tasty.   I ordered the Spicy Squid Spaghetti, one of the specials for the evening.  I was shocked and delighted by the generous portion and hefty amount of squid that was included.  The pasta was cooked nicely, and the squid was perfectly devoid of any chewiness.  The sauce was a blend of light tomato sauce and zesty chili oil.  In fact, the spiciness was so extreme that it left a tantilizing tingle on my lips.  Despite only making it halfway through the bowl before getting full, I still wound-up polishing off the leftovers later that evening!     The pasta was so tasty that it made me eager to return to try some of the other menu items, like their innovative, thin-crust pizzas.
2017-09-10,5,Hidden gem in Hoboken!  Friendly service,  homey ambiance and the food is amazing!   Gluten free options and huge portions!   Very impressed by the Gluten free pizza (def better than grimaldis) so many different types of pizza with delicious ingredients! I am in love with this place!
2017-08-31,5,A very cozy warm restaurant with a small Italian home feel. A Hoboken staple. Food and service is always amazing and at a good price. Tucked away from Washington Street, this restaurant is a hidden gem perfect for a date or a night out with family/friends. The coolest thing on the menu, in my opinion, is the huge appetizer meatball. It's enormous and is sourced from Truglios, which is an old school butcher shop around the corner. Kudos for using local vendors and for being unique.  Also, we order pizza for takeout (this restaurant is on Seamless) atleast once a month. It's absolutely delicious! If you live in Hoboken, this BYOB won't let you down!
2017-08-20,1,Came here with my wife, second time trying it. There was one four seat table open, and as we asked to be seated and as the host (owner?) greeted us, a party of four came in behind us. He noticed the party of four behind us, and told us he had nothing available. When I asked why we couldn't be sat at the open table, he stated that they try to please as many people as possible so would sit the party of four instead, even though the arrived after us. Wow, we were shocked, what a terrible decision. We went to Margherita's which is MUCH better. We'll never come here again by principle.
2017-08-12,5,Delicious Hoboken must! There are various Italian options in this city, but Otto Strada serves traditional dishes along with unique twists. Many claim this restaurant to be their favorite. You can always find many couples on dates alongside groups of friends celebrating special occasions. The vibe is cool and rustic, and not at all stuffy. My favorite dishes are the strawberry and burrata salad, cedar plank salmon and bucatini. My boyfriend says the tortellaci is a must as well. Service is great! Please note that this restaurant is always packed and does not take reservations. Your best bet is to swing by, put your name in and grab a drink nearby at 8th Street Tavern. Worth the wait no matter how long it is! Also it is bring your own.
2017-08-09,4,Came here on a friday night and there was a little bit of a wait. The hostess was very accomodating and seemed like she had a good handle on things. She called us pretty quick and said they had a table ready.It is great that this is a byob. The waiter was attentive to all of our needs and even helped us with suggestions on what to have. I would suggest simplifying the menu. It is massive and has WAY too many options. We ordered the meatball appetizers and the cheese plate (3 cheeses for $12). The portions were massive. It was great. The meatball was flavorful and had a good texture. The sauce was tangy and delicious.We tried the parmesan, burrata and goat cheese and all were phenomenal. We probably shoulda ordered the appetizer with the different jams but that is our mistake.Finally we had the nutella pizza with strawberries and bananas. Crunchy and gooey this definitely hit the spot. Overall, otto strada hit the mark in both food and service. I will be back.
2017-07-27,5,This is a Hoboken staple - amazing authentic Italian food with HUGE portions. It's also BYOB and has outdoor seating, so it's the perfect spot to come drink/eat and relax with friends. We started out with the Meatball Appetizer - OMG. It was a huge one pound meatball with ricotta cheese on top. Seriously, it was amazing. We also got the Shrimp appetizer - I'd probably try something new next time, but it was very good. For entrees, we got the Eggplant Parm and it was delicious. BUT, the dessert was the absolute best thing we had. We got the Nutella Pizza - it was actually out of this world. Warning - it's HUGE, but SO good. We took more than half home, and are so excited to eat the leftovers again tonight. We will be back very soon!
2017-07-12,5,A hoboken staple for sure. I've only been here a few times but I've never tried anything that wasn't amazing! It's a little on the pricy side however the dishes are larger than most restaurants with comparable prices. I would definitely recommend a date night out here. This is a BYOB must try.
2017-07-07,5,Hands down one of my favorite restaurants, Very knowledgeable staff.. although I always get the same dish I ask for recommendations and anyone who is taking care of you can tell you every single ingredient that goes into the dish. They never let me down!
2017-06-30,5,Awesome spot. Authentic food, and great portions. Perfect place to come enjoy your own bottle of wine with a great Italian meal. The octopus was cooked to perfection, and that's not an easy task.The wait can be annoying, especially when you're hungry, but it is definitely worth it.
2017-06-28,3,Having been to Otto Strada several more times over the past few years, I have to say that the quality of the food has improved. I haven't been blown away by the food there, but I certainly haven't been disappointed as I was the first couple of times that I visited. Improvement in quality deserves and improvement in rating.
2017-06-17,1,Avoid avoid avoid. Walk the extra 4 minutes to Anthony Davids for 10x better food and service. Sat down outside at 545 and ordered 1 pasta and 1 dessert. At 7pm our food still had not arrived. 715....the pasta came (cold) and we were told 20 more minutes for the dessert. No apologies.
2017-06-12,4,Solid Italian food at this midtown BYOB restaurant. The bruschetta appetizer is delicious - very fresh tomatoes!The squid ink pasta with clams was a special, and was really interesting!  Not sure if i would have it again, but it was a nice change to my usual Italian food repertoire.  My husband had the bolgonese, and while we weren't blown away by it, it was good enough to finish every bite ;)   The chicken parm is really good and the portion is HUGE -- definitely doggy bag material and a full meal the next day!The total for 8 people was something insanely reasonable like $250 (Including tip!).Staff is super nice and welcoming. I will be back to try some other items on the menu!
2017-05-13,5,Otto strada blew us away! A few recent poor reviews of the place almost stopped us from trying it -so glad it didn't!! The food was spot on, some of the best I've ever had in Hoboken. The quality of the food out does sorellina- another fantastic spot. Everything came out of the kitchen incredibly fresh and cooked to perfection. Most generous portion of octopus I've ever received at a restaurant and the quality was just out of this world. Melt in your mouth burrata! Ugh everything just so good. Can't wait to go back! Only thing- wish they took reservations. Otto strada- start taking res!!
2017-05-09,4,Really great food but management needs work. No reservations and they often mess up and delay the waiting list.  Needs to move to a bigger spot or be reservation only!
2017-05-07,2,Mehhh. Went last night, waited over an hour for a table (luckily there's a bar around the corner you can wait at because there is no room to wait inside the restaurant without hovering over tables while other people eat). I don't mind waiting awhile for a table, especially if the food is worth the wait. Unfortunately, the food was not with the wait. For apps we had the ricotta served four ways (bland), gnocchi in a pork tomato sauce (also bland and gnocchi was too dense), grilled octopus (over cooked) and tortellaci (best dish of the night). For dinner the Dover Sole special was caked in soggy breadcrumbs and dried herbs, no flavor what so ever and over cooked. The other two chicken dishes were nothing to write home about either...in fact I don't even remember what they were. On the plus side, our server was very nice. I would not recommend this restaurant.
2017-04-29,3,There's one thing on this menu that everyone should come here to get- and thats the MEATBALL appetizer (a huge, dense, cheesy, saucy ball).   Nothing else compares to it- I give you my word.  Save some of the bread to dip into the sauce. Wow.I've been here a few times, however, last night we came as a party of 4 and it was super busy.  Like 45 minutes to an hour "wait time" busy.  I'd recommend coming before 7:30 if you don't want to wait that long.  The hostess offered us wine glasses and opened our wine for us, so we had a glass while we waited.  It was a nice night, so there was seating inside and outside.Aside from the meatball, our food was okay, not bad.  We ordered the grilled octopus and the burrata as appetizers.  The four of us split two entrees.  Eggplant parmesan and the filet of sole.  We ordered pappardelle pasta on the side, which I felt was served horribly.  I forked what appeared to be "chunks" of pappardelle, since the noodles were dry and stuck together.  I hate when pasta is served with sauce only on top (not mixed together).  The fish and eggplant parm were very good.Service was okay- we could see how busy they were, so we didn't judge them too hard.  We had to flag down the waiter to put our appetizers and entrees in.  Food came out in reasonable time.I'll be back, since it's a close BYOB restaurant and that meatball is EVERYTHING.
2017-04-15,4,The food is excellent here. It's on the small side, so expect to wait on Thurs-Sat. It's a little overpriced, but they have no liquor license so they have to make money somewhere. I would recommend this place to anyone coming in to Hoboken. Great food, excellent service and professionaly operated. This is one of the best Hoboken has to offer.
2017-04-03,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken hands down. They've got a great menu with traditional Italian dishes (best Eggplant parm I've ever had) and some unique dishes that are excellent (veal tortellini is really good).
2017-03-05,5,This place is phenomenal.   I call BS on reviews that mention an alternative.  Took a party of 8 and everyone has something different.   I had the polla prosciutto and it was the best chicken I have ever had.   My wife had lasagna caprese which was a portablla mushroom with parmigian, etc.   incredible Service was first class!  Kudos to the whole team and I am guessing our table was even visited by the owner/manager.  Not sure but he cared!Someone said the place is loud?   Yes but I scratch my head and ask if they are used to going out in Hoboken, the city, and especially a place that is byob.   Did I mention you can bring your own best wine 5 stars period!  Strongest 5 stars I have given.   Will be back a lot  as my son goes to Stevens and this place is great
2017-03-05,4,Easy 5 stars if otto strada was more affordable or if the portions were bigger but I get it. Everything I've had is unique, top notch and has you begging more. This place is a real treat if you like Italian with reckless abandon.
2017-02-21,4,I've been to Otto twice so far. Went on a Thursday for my birthday and was blown away that I had to come back that weekend. The grilled octopus is out of this world.l, huge portion and tastes almost like a steak in a light, crisp mango limoncello sauce that gives just the perfect hint of citrus to the dish. Perfectly complemented with the side of bean, tomato and onion salad. Salmon is by far one of the best I've ever had. Cooked on a cedar plank and glazed with a brown sugar Dijon mustard that gives the right salty/sweet combo. Sampled the pork chop parm (huge and delicious), chicken millenese (phenomenal) and the limoncello chicken (too lemony/sweet for my taste). The second time dining at Otto we started with the cheese plate and 16 oz meatball, neither of which disappointed. Also ended the night with the Nutella brownie and cannoli cones. Delicious! We waited a little over an hour to be seated the second time, which was fine, but being a Sunday of a holiday weekend, were rushed out the door at 9 PM! I was anxious to try to cannoli calzone, but was informed that the kitchen was closed. The management the second time around was a little poor, turning people away left and right, but the food and wait staff are unparalleled. We will definitely be back.
2017-01-05,2,No prices on the specials. Big demerits. Pizza dough extremely tasteless and poor consistency. Too much dressing on the salad. Overpriced for Hoboken. Cold-feeling, noisy room. Very meh. The waitperson was sweet.
2017-01-03,2,We previously catered with them.  The 7 trays we order were very good.  We went again for new years.  It was not too busy.  Service was not good.  The food was sub par.  The fish stew was bland and was not fresh.  Most likely frozen store bought.  Not worth the price for frozen bought.  Their double pork chop was just pork parmigiana that was deep fried.  It was horrible and overpriced for the value.  I see why their mussels were called angry mussels.  I was angry after eating overpriced bland frozen bought mussels with nasty bland garlic sauce.  I dont know if we will go back.  This place seems doomed.  It tasted like an amateur cook who put our order together.  I rather eat at nasty marios pizzeria down the block!  I dont mind overpaying if it was only eatable.
2016-12-22,4,I've come in twice for weeknight dinners with friends, because this place is BYOB. It's usually pretty quiet, and it's got a very comfortable vibe. The crostini appetizers are good, the pasta servings are large, and the pizzas are great to share. This is a reliably good, mid-priced place to have dinner with friends!
2016-12-22,5,Favorite restaurant in Hoboken! Everything on the menu is awesome. The kale ceasar salad with grapes and garlic (usually on special, if not just ask) and Porco piccante pizza are favorites. For vegetarians, favorites are margherita pizza, mushroom pizza, eggplant parm and linguini pesto con di Pepe rosso. Great atmosphere to dine there and byob.  Best wait staff. Quick delivery and they always get it right. Their specials are always delicious. Definitely try the Nutella brownie for dessert!!!
2016-12-21,2,I've been to almost every restaurant in hoboken... and this place yes it has been written up a bunch ... but it's not the best unfortunately. :/.  Started off with antipasto which was just OK -- the salame and the prosciutto had a lot of fat :/. Bleh.  This appetizer was 20 bucks and not worth it. Entree:  I had the parperdelle with the burrata, tomatoes and the red pepper flakes.  Decent --- nothing special... can make the same meal at home. Skip it and go to margheritas.  Better food for half the price.
2016-12-19,5,This is my favorite spot in Hoboken. The food here is delicious-- flavorful, fresh ingredients, well-prepared, and tasty. The portions are large so you won't leave hungry. The place is small so getting a table is tricky (they also don't take reservations), but it's a cozy restaurant with nice staff and great food. It's my new favorite in town!
2016-12-19,5,This was my first time here although I have been hearing nothing but rave reviews of this place for years. As it turns out my best friends family member is the owner and is always more than accommodating. A large group of us went there yesterday for the first time and I am actually angry that I hadn't gone sooner. The atmosphere was very welcoming and warm. It is a small spot but loaded with character. The staff is very friendly and willing to make any arrangements necessary. My sister in law is gluten free mad has severe food allergies and they couldn't do enough for her to make sure she enjoyed her meal. The food was on point from the appetizers to the entreeS. Everything was absolutely spectacular. I ordered a pasta in a mushroom cream sauce that had cheese and truffle oil and it was delicious. I would recommend this spot to anyone. It's a BYOB so the prices aren't expensive especially in comparison to other joints in Hoboken. By far the top BYOB/authentic Italian place in H
2016-12-17,1,So bummed - this place has great food, service not so.. But if you are looking to reserve a table forget it-- understandably that is how Hoboken is.. but a party of 12, that is 12 customers that go there often, not happening. Their website says they take reservations for parties of 10-15, that is simply not true. I'll no longer go back.. management should really reconsider and know who their patrons are.
2016-12-07,4,This place is amazing! The food is delicious and the menu has everything to offer and more! The only downside is the small place. They do not take reservations and there is no waiting area. Fortunately enough i live down the street so i can put in my name and go home until they call. By far my favorite place to eat in Hoboken.
2016-11-24,4,How has this place escaped me for so long? Hoboken seems to be filled with a bunch of ho-hum Italian places that in no way distinguish themselves from one another. Otto Strada easily separates themselves from the pack and a massive menu that is both traditional and creative, while being restrained. We showed up on a Friday night, and expectedly were told they were all filled up there would be a 45 minute wait. They don't take reservations here, so either show up early or expect a bit of a wait on weekend nights. About 30 minutes later, we got a call to let us know our table was ready. We opted for the drunken octopus, crostini, pasta carbonara and the one pound meatball. The drunken octopus was fantastic, and a massive portion with three large tentacles, and a side of cannelloni beans and tomatoes. This could easily be an entree. The octopus is tender and delicious, and as good as octopus I've had anywhere. The crostini we opted for included creamy buratta cheese, caramelized tomatoes, and honey. The sweetness coaxed out of the caramelized tomatoes pairs perfectly with the honey, but is successfully tempered down by the sprinkling of sea salt, basil, and olive oil. Also to note... The bread on the crostini is softer / less toasted than you might expect, so while the contrasting textures are missing, the flavors more than make up for it. The carbonara normally comes with pasta that is not made in house, but they happily substituted it for an in house made linguini. This was so creamy and delicious. Really just an excellent pasta dish, and again, the portions is more than large enough to share or be a single standalone entree. What goes better with a giant plate of pasta than a giant meatball? The one pound meatball is larger than a softball and comes smothered in tomato sauce and topped with a healthy dollop of fresh and creamy ricotta. It goes without says, this is another giant dish. The meatball itself is fine; not as impressive as the other dishes, but certainly not bad. This is the only dish I probably wouldn't order again. While the prices here feel a bit on the higher side for both Hoboken, and for an Italian place, the large portions and quality of the food easily justify the prices. Don't believe me? The wait for a table on any weekend night should help convince you. This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a while, and oh yeah, it's BYOB. Absolutely coming back soon.
2016-11-07,5,Since I live so close to Otto Strada that I can smell their oven on chilly nights, it's not surprising that I've been here many times, for both dinner and brunch. Each time has been both an incredible experience and a testament to the great environment of the restaurant.The menu is ridiculously expansive, for both brunch and dinner. If you can't find something you like here, you're doing something wrong. Whether I'm in the mood for meat, pasta, pizza, sweet brunch food, or eggs, there is something on the Otto Strada menu to satisfy. I've had most things on the menu, and I have not encountered anything that was not excellent and plentiful. Some of my favorites include the pork chop parmigiana, the polpetta (1-pound meatball), Bucatini A la Carbonara, any of the brunch pizzas with eggs, and the stuffed Panettone French toast. This place is a real gem in Hoboken, and it works for any situation: date night, visiting with a friend, group dinner, or entertaining out-of-town guests. The space is small, especially in the fall and winter when they don't have their outdoor seating, and it can get loud, but it's more than worth the wait. If you live in Hoboken, this BYOB gem is unmissable.
2016-11-05,5,French toad is off the chain! The pancakes are fluffy and very light. The food is very fresh and the staff is friendly. The environment is very clean and the price is right.#1 French toast in our book
2016-10-29,5,I've ordered from here several times but have never dined in.  The food is unbelievably fresh, good quality ingredients, and the menu is so expansive you can find almost anything. Tonight I ordered and although we had a mishap with the delivery (they gave the driver the wrong apt number by accident), the good was great. I had to throw it in the oven first but no big deal. They even credited some of the price for the mishap. Very classy establishment- I will order again and again. Their vegetable lasagna with tomatoes, Portabella, etc, was on another level. I've never had a lasagna like that- so meaty without any meat. Also had a side of the grilled shrimp which were prepared perfectly and were large in size. Go dine in- obviously the experience is always better than delivery. But you can't go wrong either way, this place is quality food through and through.
2016-10-18,4,We happened upon Otto Strada which was very fortuitous. There was not a false note, from the wait staff to the creative specials. Wild mushroom stuffed ravioli in a cream sauce with maple. Really? Really. The salads were equally creative, abundant and accented with fresh cheeses. It is a BYOB, which IMO is a plus. I have traveled many times to Italy, and living previously near The Village  in NYC I have eaten a lot of different regional Italian dishes. Their reasonable prices earns Otto Strada 4 stars.
2016-10-14,4,Otto Strada has become our new Italian go-to in Hoboken.  The mussels appetizers (both types) are our favorite. We have been there about 5 times now, and the experience has been good consistently. It's also BYOB with a nice outdoor seating area for the warmer weather. Definitely recommend Ottos
2016-10-14,4,I really love the versatility of Otto Strada. It's a cute little place for date nights, with a modern but cozy feel and warm atmosphere. It's also a great spot for dinner or brunch with friends and family, and it's my mom's favorite place to order in from (yes, they deliver!). No matter who I go/order with, what always sticks out to me (besides the delicious food, but more on that soon) is that the servers and staff are always super friendly,  accommodating (my mother is a bit of a food snob and can be a little bit difficult with her requests), and personable, which I find really adds to the charm of the place. The food is awesome as well. I'm a creature of habit, so when I find something I like, I generally stick to it, and while I love my go-to meal, must admit that I have liked pretty much everything I have sampled off of my boyfriend's/friends'/mom's plates. That said, I highly recommend the caprese salad (yeah, I know, typical for Italian restaurants, but I'm a big fan of their balsamic glaze, and the tomatoes are huge), the eggplant crostini, and the bucatini alla carbonara (as long as you're not counting calories -this dish is seriously rich & creamy & so delicious). If you're opting for pizza, the classic margherita is an easy choice, but the sweet sausage and fontina pie is also a great choice. Dessert? Cannoli cones, no contest. Cannoli cream, semi-sweet chocolate chips, raspberry sauce and pistachios in a sugar cone?! The combination of the sweetness of the cannoli cream and the raspberry with the slight bitterness of the semi-sweet chips and saltiness of the pistachios is a dream. Seriously, I hoard these things for late night snacks. For brunch, I always go for sweet over savory, so I love the panettone French toast (huge portion, fantastic flavor, and the mascarpone is a nice touch to balance out the sweetness).As far as other menu items go, I've been told that the bistecca alla pizzaiola is a winner, so I plan on forcing someone (sorry, boyfriend!) to order that sometime soon so I can order the bucatini but also bites of the steak. The only thing I have tried that I was not partial to was the limoncello chicken (I found it to be too limoncello-y and sweet- could just be a result of drinking too much limoncello in my younger days and not being able to handle it on food). Minus one star for consistency - unfortunately, while the food is generally delicious, I've noticed variations in portion sizes and flavor of my favorite menu items. As a regular, I know the quality this place is capable of producing, so I would prefer to not have different sized portions or flavor additions to/removals from my meal every few times that I order. Given some of the negative reviews from first timers for this restaurant, I felt like this was worth mentioning, because consistency is key in building a customer base.
2016-10-09,4,First time at Otto Strada for both me and my fiancé and we enjoyed it.Service was awesome..our waiter George was very knowledgeable and made some great suggestions!For our entrees my fiancé ordered the tortellini which was excellent and after twenty minutes of deciding (everything sounded SO good), I went with the white pizza with prosciutto and truffle oil.  I thought they went a little truffle heavy on the pizza and I probably won't order it again.  Our favorite item however was the burrata crostini which had a drizzle of honey..YUM!  For dessert we split the nutella brownie which was huge and underwhelming.  We were expecting more of a cake-like brownie and this was more of a solid icebox cake and was super rich. The pizza and brownie did not ruin my experience and I am definitely looking forward to return and try others dishes!
2016-10-03,5,Otto Strada is by far my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. I've been here a handful of times and it is my go to restaurant when friends are visiting or when people ask for a recommendation. The location is great being that it is in the center of town. It is a BYOB and the food is INCREDIBLE. I've tried everything from the meat and cheese board, the ricotta and olive oil sampler, a few salads, pastas and pizzas. I have to say I had my favorite dish when I was there last night, the Capanelle Cremoso....TO DIE FOR....if you like truffle oil. So simple, so delicious. Also, I've loved every desert I've gotten there as well. If you haven't been yet, you need to go!
2016-09-18,5,Favorite Italian place in Hoboken. Everything is fresh and delicious all the time. Brunch, dinner and take out - all amazing.
2016-09-17,2,We've dined in and ordered delivery from Otto Strada several times -- the food is good, which is what has kept us coming back, but the service is terrible. We're done after our latest experience. We ordered (1) pizza for delivery at 7:15 pm and were given a delivery estimate of 8:20-8:30. When the pizza hadn't arrived by 9 pm, we called to check in, and were told the delivery driver had left with our pizza "5 minutes ago". When it still hadn't arrived at 9:30 pm, we called again and were told again that the delivery driver had left with our pizza "5 minutes ago". We called again at 9:45 and were told the driver had "just left". When I asked why we had been told twice, both 45 minutes and then 15 minutes prior that our pizza was already on the way, I was informed that someone else who answered the phone must have told me, because the person who I was speaking to "never would have told me that". We spoke again at 10 pm and I was told the driver was still on the way -- we only live four blocks from the restaurant. Our (1) pizza, which we ordered at 7:15 pm, was delivered at 10:25 pm. Let me tell you, Otto Strada, when a customer calls multiple times to inquire about a pizza that was ordered 2-3 hours prior, an "I'm sorry" would really go a long way. We've had the experience multiple times prior when we've ordered over the phone for pickup, have arrived at the time we were told the pizza would be ready, to see our order handed over to the kitchen to be prepared. Really not impressed.
2016-09-11,2,Went for DinnerFood - 1/5. I was told many good things about Otto Strada and there is a chance it might have been a fluke but that doesn't change the fact that the food I got tasted bad. The focaccia bread they start you with is very small, hard and heavy on oil. This had me a bit surprised to have such below average bread at an Italian restaurant I heard praises for but I still had high hopes for the pasta, as the ingredients sounded like a good combination. Perhaps in theory the Capellini con Pancetta, Cavolini e Funghi would make a beautiful balance of flavors but the one I ate at Otto was tasteless. Firstly the bacon (not pancetta as advertised on menu) was soggy and bland. Bacon's charm comes from a crispy salty goodness so having what tasted like boiled bacon with all it's salt extracted from it was very disappointing. The mushrooms and brussels sprouts had similar issues as none of the items had a good sear to have a strong flavor profile. The pasta was also under-seasoned and the entire dish lacked any flavor. At first I thought the liquid at the bottom of the plate was a sauce, but it tasted like the water that comes out from cooking mushrooms and pasta water from when the angel hair was transferred onto the plate. Very disappointed in the food.Service - 2/5. Slow and inattentive. It was a busy restaurant but every time I looked around for the waitress, she was chatting excessively with another table or her co-workers. It is not like I think the front of the house staff should have no fun, but if there is work to be done more professionalism is expected. Waiting to place my food order, get the check and pay for the check took extra long due to how little the waitress seemed to pay attention to tables she isn't currently conversing with.Value - 1/5. The prices aren't bad for dinner with pasta being in the 18 to 22 dollar range for dinner in Hoboken. The food tasted awful though and the service wasn't good so spending money at this restaurant was not a enjoyable experience. There isn't much value to buying food that you do not enjoy eating.Parking - Street (Free)
2016-09-09,5,Lovin OTTO strada :) A hidden gem that you can't miss on the corner of Park & 8th St. This BYOB Italian spot is nothing short of delicious. Closed on Mondays but open Tuesday through Sunday. Brunch (mMMmMimosas) is served on Saturday & Sunday mornings from 11-3 & Dinner from 4-11.  Call ahead for specials as well as availability for tables... OTTOs menu isn't limited to just pizza and pastas but they also offer an extensive list of crostinis, salads, contornis & antipasti. NOTEWORTHY dishes:  Torrelaci , Bucatini Carbonara, Malfadine ala Bolognese & also NONNAS MEATBALL! If you haven't tried them yet - you're missing out! Oh. & they serve house made gelato
2016-09-04,4,Otto was excellent.  Reasonably priced, if not on the slightly expensive side, but quality food that is delicious.  The cheese plate app was excellent, as was the grilled octopus.  Their signature dish, the 16 oz meatball was cooked perfectly - not dry, moist and hearty, with limited fillers.  You should also try the giant Stromboli canoli.The fact that  it's BYOB is also a huge plus, and no stupid cork fee.
2016-08-20,1,So sad, used to be my favorite place until I sat for an hour waiting for my dinner, the cioppino was so fishy and pasta was over cooked. Waiter was not attentive what so ever, basically gave up... The people next to us were so rude and obnoxiously drunk, they should've been kicked out jumping over the fence and smoking by our table, what a let down Otto Strada what a let down.
2016-08-12,5,Solid dinner all around- would highly recommend the pizza (got the 4 cheese) and pasta. Also really liked the atmosphere
2016-08-11,4,Very good and authentic Italian food is served here. We ordered pizza and deserts and they were amazing. Based on my visual observations, pasta and meatball dishes also looked amazing and big portion wise .
2016-08-05,5,Definitely a go to in Hoboken. Great appetizers and awesome place to come with people visiting Hoboken. The atmosphere is casual chic. They don't take reservations which is annoying- but typically the wait is 30-45 minutes with a group of 4 or less. Outside seating in the summer/ fall/ spring.
2016-07-31,5,I cannot believe this place doesn't have 5 stars!!!! Most amazing food ever!! We love their cheese boards, mushroom bell shaped pasta is amazing! And I'm obsessed with their seasonal burrata and strawberry salad! It's usally slammed so as long as your not in a rush it's so delicious ;) their Sunday dinner was also really good!
2016-07-26,4,Nice cozy restaurant in Hoboken with outdoor seating which is perfect with a little breeze in the summertime. I had the special which was a delightful spinach  ravioli and the table had the gnocchi alla malloreddus which was rich with pork sausage. We shared Cannoli cones for dessert which were rich with chocolate chips. Yummy. We were able to bring bottles of wine from the local liquor store for our meal but don't recall if a corkage fee was included with our bill.
2016-07-21,5,The fact that Otto Strada isn't revered as the best Italian in Hoboken baffles me. I come from a very Italian family that is very quick to judge when it comes to food. This place slays and I would highly suggest to anyone looking for incredible cuisine at a reasonable price. I didn't realize it's BYOB on my first visit though so definitely stop on your way.
2016-07-21,4,As a die hard burrata lover, I really appreciate a place that serves it for brunch (very few in Hoboken do). My boyfriend and I also had the bocce ball sliders and the eggs in purgatory which were both delicious. There are a few other things on the brunch menu that I have to try. Will definitely be back for brunch!
2016-07-17,3,Doesn't satisfy. I had been waiting to try Otto for a while and finally stopped in for an impromptu dinner with a fried. We started with the bruschetta which was tasty and generously portion if a little sloppy.  I had the papardelle which was so acidic and tomato-y and acidic without much flavor (and I love tomato):  my friend had the carbonara which was so rich and thick, and overall not a good representation of carbonara. I probably won't be back
2016-07-15,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken. If you have time, try to eat outside on there terrace, it's absolutely gorgeous with fresh basil growing and good people watching. Food-wise, you can't go wrong. Their pizzas are to die for, the carbonara is simplicity at its best, and the apps are fire.
2016-07-14,1,Wow. I've been to this restaurant many times and have always been frustrated with the management of the wait times, however this experience was beyond ridiculous. We waited for a table for way longer than expected, after receiving extremely rude service from the hostess. Then, a very nice waiter came out and let us know that a table would be ready soon and he would come get us. He returned within a minute or so and took us right to a nice table inside. However, two minutes later he came back and very apologetically says that he sat us by mistake and that another party of 5 was ahead of us. We were very confused. Then the manager came up and basically told us to get up, extremely unapologetically... I've worked in the restaurant industry and understand the stress. However, when you seat a party after they've been waiting for longer than advised in the ridiculous humidity, you keep them there. So your waiter made a mistake, he's busy and was trying to provide nice service. Your horrible hostess (who made rude comments to everyone in reach of hearing) should have done her job and been managing the seating. Next time something like this happens you a.) Offer the party you sat mistakenly your sincerest apologies and perhaps a comped appetizer (considering its BYOB) or b.) Don't say anything to the party you say mistakenly and let the other party know that you're extremely sorry for the longer than expected wait and offer them a comped appetizer. Both options will most likely leave you with happy customers in the end. Instead, your chosen approach has left you with previously loyal customers that will never come back.
2016-07-14,5,Went last night and loved it! The giant meatball is a must-have. The special zucchini flower and burrata pizza was soo good. Will bring wine next time! And will definitely be trying for brunch. Lived up to the hype!
2016-07-10,5,Add it to the list of brunch spots in Hoboken - Nonna Style.An Italian twist on breakfast makes this one of my favourite places to try new things.
2016-07-08,4,I really enjoy the food at Otto Strada. They are very welcoming to families early in the evening. We have only come around 5pm and are always accommodating with my son who sometimes likes to walk around the restaurant. White pizzas are always my go to, though I haven't had any disappointing meals there. Our server yesterday was Chris, and I want to acknowledge his professionalism, courtesy and friendliness.
2016-07-06,2,So confused by this place!!! I ate here twice. My first meal was bad- so bad I assumed I had just ordered the wrong things. We had olives (fine of course), a fennel salad which was overpriced for what you got, and the fig/prosciutto/balsamic/honey pizza. Let me preface this by saying I work in the food service industry in a high end restaurant in the city and I never ever send food back. I took two bites and returned the pizza. It was covered/soaked in honey. It actually tasted like it should've been a dessert it was sooooo sweet. The waitress actually said something about the chef making a mistake on how sweet it was. Not a big deal they took it off our check and bought us a desert which was super nice. Round two. I stayed away from the pizza and ordered the lemon chicken and we split the spinach salad to start. Salad was great and a big portion. Then the chicken came which was again wildly sweet. My friend said her carbonara was nothing to write home about and just a 'pasta in cream sauce for $19'. My boyfriend had cavatelli with lamb sausage and he said the whole dish tasted watery as if they didn't strain the pasta before adding it to the sauce or something. I finished the chicken and we all decided we would never return. The atmosphere is cute and trendy. Love that it's BYOB. But the food is just off? And rather disappointing. With so many good traditional and trendy Italian restaurants locally- no real reason to dine here. Sorry Otto Strada, I wanted to like you.
2016-07-05,5,Food was phenomenal. We had the carbonara pasta, crispy prosciutto pizza and burrata crostini appetizer. Everything was perfect! Love this place and will definitely be returning to try everything else on the menu!!
2016-06-24,5,Had dinner this evening with my girlfriend. Heard many good things so we had to try. We couldn't decide what to eat because the entire menu looked incredible. We started with the brick oven wood plank shrimp. So fresh and delicious and a wonderful starter. I had the eggplant parm which was stacked high with a blanket of fresh mozz. Best egg parm I've ever had. My girlfriend had the beef and veal tortellini with a cream sauce and balsamic reduction. Was fabulous. I can't wait to go back. Service was very accommodating as well, we had to wait so they chilled our bottle of wine inside until we were seated. Was a perfect night out.
2016-05-17,2,Went here for my friend's birthday brunch. The food was delicious - we ordered a lot and didn't have any complaints. The entire menu looked good to the point that it was hard to decide what to order!The con to this experience was definitely the service. We called in advance to try to make a reservation and the woman on the phone was very unclear and quite rude about whether or not they took reservations for brunch. When we showed up, there were plenty of tables available so we were seated immediately - which was great.We saw the waitress maybe three times for the remainder of brunch - once when she greeted us and handed us our menus, once when she brought out our food and once when she brought the bill. We all wanted refills on our waters/coffees but she never returned to the table to ask how we were doing and the busser did not understand English so it took us getting up to ask her to get what we needed. We gave her the benefit of the doubt for a moment when we realized she was the only server, but that was soon lost when we realized there were only four occupied tables in the whole place.
2016-05-08,4,I've heard some mixed things about O.S. so arrived here with some trepidation. It's BYOB and forgot that but was able to call the wine store down the street and they quicklydelivered a yummy bottle of prosecco. The Sunday night dinner of pasta with marinaracame amply loaded with meatballs, short ribs, bracciole and sausage, which can be ordered for two or four people. The arugula salad with very fresh burrata,  strawberries and a terrific balsamic reduction hit the spot, as did the prosciutto pizza and calamari. Good gelato, too. For the money, it's safe to say O.S. is a good value. No reservations taken for less than 6 people, though.
2016-05-01,5,Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen in Hoboken and this part of NJ, but Otto Strada stands out amongst them. Their ingredients are fresh, none of the food is greasy or too oily, and the food is tasty and perfectly spiced. This is a perfect date night spot or a fun place to go with your girlfriends.
2016-05-01,2,Overpriced and under delivered. $27 for a 4x1 inch long piece of salmon, burnt potatoes and asparagus. The "Homemade" mutz tasted like it was shop rite.Giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because the person I was with had the ravioli which came out okay. Stick to pasta if you do visit.
2016-04-23,5,Had dinner last night at Otto's.  Started off with two delicious appetizers, the arugula salad special and the broiled shrimp with garlic and lemon.  Needless to say, both were to die for.  Followed with eggplant parm, served in its own casserole dish, this would melt in yourmouth.  My spouse enjoyed the chickenlimone.  Tender and seasoned to perfection.  Capped off this wonderful experience with a double expresso, but to stuffed for dessert.  Thanks George, we will be back for sure .
2016-04-17,5,The food at Otto Strada is absolutely sublime - be sure you come early or you'll have to wait because this restaurant is extremely well liked. The meatball is truly unique, and my wife who is born and raised in Venice, IT truly loves everything she has ever had here. An absolutely top restaurant in Hoboken, or NJ for that matter!
2016-04-05,5,Best authentic Italian I have ever had.  We stopped in just for an appetizer and ended up staying for a full meal .  Great service and the food is beyond awesome.  Highly recommend .
2016-04-02,2,This review is for customer service: I called to place an order for delivery and the women on the phone taking the order was very rude. She was very snippy and sounded so annoyed. Are you that stressed out already at 6pm on a Saturday? Quit huffing and puffing on the phone. Just be polite and take the order. Pizzas are pretty good though.
2016-03-20,5,Easily the best brunch I've had in Hoboken. Certainly the best brunch I've had in a long time. Great coffee, stylish Italian glass ware, extremely tasty frittata, delicious French toast loaded with lemon mascarpone without being too rich, attentive service. Will be back.
2016-03-11,5,Otto Strada is hands down my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. I have never had one bad meal or experience here. I have been multiple times for dinner and brunch and have a hard time deciding which is my favorite! For dinner, I usually go for a special for my entree but a few standard favorites are: the big meatball (you have to get it at least once), polpo appetizer, cheese plate appetizer, kale salad, Prociutto e Asparagi pizza, and the veal stuffed tortellini. For brunch I really enjoy the Uova e Tartufo breakfast pizza, the french toast and the sausage strada. This place is BYO and honestly delicious, fresh, homemade tasting food every single time I go.
2016-03-05,4,My husband and two friends went for a Saturday night dinner here. My friend put our name down and we went to a local bar for a drink. We came back after 45 minutes and the host said still waiting for a table for 4. We went in a rush so we didn't mind waiting little longer. While we waited we got treated to a crostini each. Yum! We got a table,  seated & ordered 4 appetisers.  They were delicious. I got a salad (goats cheese walnuts yum!) And others got sliders & crostinis (2 different types). All delicious!!! Main course I think I could have skipped. The two men got steaks but it was drowned in tomato based sauce they felt overpowered the beauty of the big steak. It would have been better recieved if the steak was plain and had a mini jug with sauce in it on the side. My friend got the lobster gnocchi and it was good. I got basic spaghetti bolongese. The meat was delicious and tender melt in mouth. My only critique would be less pasta and not the ribbon wide width. It's too heavy! And then onto dessert. Tirimisu  (would prefer the Italian style with cocoa & mascapone) was good - almond base & the brownie fudge was so heavy but good! We got 2 between the 4 of us! Overall it cost us 50 dollars each (tip included) which was reasonable. The waiter was attentive and very pleasant. We spoke to the owner outside and he was a lovely man. Overall a good experience.  I'm gonna go back with my parents are over for lunch & just do all appetisers! They're delicious!!
2016-02-22,2,Very disappointed. Heard great things about this place but from food to service the whole experience was mediocre. For appetizers, we ordered the kale salad and a sausage and peppers plate. The sausage and peppers were good, but it was presented In deconstructed way with three separate piles of sausage, peppers and broccoli rabe. Weird. Tasty, but weird - it needed some starch, like crostinis or something.  The kale salad was terrible. Completely over dressed and it included almost half a bulb of garlic in it. I accidentally ate an entire piece of garlic because I mistook it for a crouton. The salad was basically inedible. On to mains....The gnocchi was overcooked and also pretty inedible; like glutinous bricks.  The tomato sauce tasted canned. The tortolacci was rubbery and under seasoned. The cream sauce for the tortolacci was sweet and didn't really match the flavor profile of the rest of the dish. There was also way too much of it on the plate, that dish probably has about 1,000 calories of heavy cream in it. Service is what you typically get in Hoboken (e.g terrible). Had to pour our own water and wine thought the meal and flag down the waitress to get some Parmesan and a new fork and knife when the busser took our flatware away with the appetizers, which took forever since she was also busy answering phones and emptying the coffee maker.  She was tipped accordingly. I probably won't be back. I've come to expect mediocre food in Hoboken and was hoping this would be something on par with the better spots in town, like Anthony David, but it's not. It's just another hyped up place filled with 23 year olds glad to have another BYOB joint who wouldn't know how good food is supposed to taste.Maybe the pizzas are better but I'm not going out of my way to try. Not with hour long waits when Grimaldi's is right down the street.
2016-02-05,5,This was some of the best service we have ever had. They were open during a snow storm- were happy to help our party of 15-20. We were not rushed out once "Brunch" hours ended and they were more than happy to split the check with our large party. The food was delicious and they fact that it is a byob makes it even better. 5 stars.
2016-01-26,5,This little restaurant has become my go to place for nice, classy Italian food. The ingredients are fresh and the dishes are well thought out and come together very nicely. I've been here a few times now and have never had a bad experience. Another plus is it is BYOB and no cork fee so that makes this place even more appealing. Last time I came here, my boyfriend and I wanted a somewhat romantic evening so we walked by and was told there is about a 30min wait. The place was packed!! (Only drawback, they DO NOT take reservations, at all) We put our name and number down and walked to a nearby bar to have a drink and watch a basketball game. About 20mins later our table was ready. Right away a pitcher of water was brought over and our bottle of wine opened and we thoroughly looked at the menu. I don't usually order an appetizer but the BF had a good week at work and was feeling extra hungry so he ordered the Gambero Cotto a Legna, perfectly baked butterflied shrimp with just lemon and herbs. I chose the Pappardelle con Pomodori Spinaci e Burrata with homemade pasta and for the BF's entire he went with the Capellini con Pancetta Cavolini e Funghi. Both dishes were well seasoned and tasted amazing. The portions were great also, I didn't feel overwhelmed or leave wanting more.As for the service, I thought everything happened very smoothly. I also wasn't there to be catered to every second. I knew they were busy but there wasn't a long wait for any of the dishes. I was perfectly content.
2016-01-23,2,Went there after a trip to Italy had us craving carbonara. Never been so disappointed. Bland pasta, no pepper. I barely ate it. Typical hoboken though, they are packed every night and people seem to be enjoying themselves.
2016-01-15,5,Visited OTTO STRADA about 2 weeks ago and boy were we impressed! Meatball was literally as big as a softball and absolutely delicious! Calzone pizza, and pasta were equally delicious. The Staff and owner or (GM) who were present were extremely polite and on point for a very busy on a Saturday night. There was a 45 minute wait so we walked to the Turtle Club grabbed a drink. We received a call when our table was ready (20 mins later), cant ask for better service and courtesy for this neighborhood spot. Canoli's ridiculously amazing. Otto may just be one of my new fav's in town!All in all had a fabulous date night meal at Otto. Check this place out Hobokenites.
2016-01-10,5,Delicious and wonderful for a date night!  My husband and I rarely get a night out without baby now and we were saving Otto Strada for precisely that occasion.  It just always looks so lively, festive and welcoming when we walk by - we had been dying to try it for a long time.  The footprint of the restaurant is quite small so we didn't feel like attempting it with baby + stroller (not sure if they even allow strollers).  Boy, was it worth waiting for!  It's BYOB, so we grabbed our favorite bottle of red along for the ride.  We came early... around 5:45PM on a Saturday so we were seated immediately.  The waiter was super friendly and helpful so we immediately felt comfortable with his suggestions.  Ordered grilled shrimp and a burrata salad for appetizers.  Both were wonderful and light.  Paired together wonderfully!  For entree, I went for a Bucatini Carbonara and my husband got the massive meatball.  I absolutely loved the carbonara.  It was creamy and rich and precisely what I wanted on a cold winter night.  My husband liked the meatball but in retrospect he wished we got it as an appetizer instead because it was just too much of the same thing (it's a 16 oz meatball afterall!).  We'll be back to try more of the menu.  Great experience and left with full and happy bellies.
2016-01-08,4,Ordered off of seamless on a Wednesday night and was overall impressed. The delivery took 70-80 minutes which is long and I paid 43 dollars for a pasta and an appetizer and there bread that was provided was not interesting nor did they provide butter or olive oil or cutlery / napkins...those are the negatives which made this place three stars instead of four. However the main dishes were very good and interesting. For 18 dollars I had a and olive oil and burrata sampler with four types of olive oil and four dollops of fresh burrata. They were excellent especially the chili which was outstanding for its kick. The crostini provided was also very good. Although expensive it is a large appetizer and could easily be shared by 3 to 4 people although more crostini would be needed. I also ordered bucatin carbonara. This was more like a cacio e pepe but it was very well done. The pancetta and pasta and sauce were very tasty. I don't love bucatini because it's a thicker noodle so would have preferred spaghetti or even penne but this was still a good dish. Because of the way they prepare these dishes I will definitely try other parts of their menu including the pizzas or secondis. I ordered their Porco Picante (san marzano tomatoes, homemade mozzarella, pepperoni, hot sausage, hot Italian peppers, chili oil, ricotta salata, fresh basil and evoo) - it was delicious and spicy! It's expensive but the ingredients are stellar and the delivery was on time from seamless. Notched an additional star because this place is becoming a favorite.
2015-12-29,5,Ok, I admit it...I'm a Yelp parasite.  I frequently rely on Yelp for vetting restaurants and other vendors, but hardly ever rate, let alone write, reviews.  I'm compelled to break from my lazy routine after thoroughly enjoying dinner with my wife at Otto Strada in Hoboken.  This is the perfect, and I mean perfect, neighborhood joint! Qualities necessary for elite "Neighborhood Joint" status:- Geographic proximity ( facilitates frequent/convenient visits )- Cost effective ( also facilitates frequent/convenient visits )- Variety, as well as quality- Comfortable, clean atmosphere- Friendly, efficient serviceLocated almost directly in the center of Hoboken at 8th St and Park Ave, most can walk there in under 10 min, 15 min max.  The decor is inviting, comfortable, clean and updated.  The menu is extensive (pizza, apps, salad, pasta, entrees, deserts and daily specials) without fore-fitting quality, in any way.  This is very hard to do.  Otto Strada specializes in Italian and Italian-American recipes, many with subtle modern embellishments, always utilizing quality ingredients (smoked mozzerella in the lasagna / cedar plank broiled shrimp).  Furthermore, Otto Strada is BYOB and a wine store is located one block away!If you like Margarita's in Hoboken, do yourself a favor and give it's younger, slicker sibling a try.  Personally, I believe the torch has been passed and the bar has been raised.
2015-12-22,5,Best in the Biz!We order from Otto Strada once a week.  Delivery is quick and the food is fresh and delicious!  In about 25 orders, they forgot one pizza but brought it right away as soon as I called.  Within 10mins.  That's customer service!  All pastas are amazing!  Our kids love the pizza.  Best Italian in Hudson county.  No lies.  Do yourselves a a favor and order their food!  You shan't regret it!
2015-12-20,4,A great little "find" in Hoboken!  The pizzas are divine!  The bruschetta is the best I've ever had and the caponata bruschetta ... delicious!  Love this place!
2015-12-05,1,Food looked fantastic but sadly I wasn't able to enjoy a meal here. 4 tables available at 9:30PM on a Friday night and they refused to sit my party for over 20 minutes. Poor customer service and care.
2015-11-27,5,I was waiting to write a review until I had sampled more of the menu, but I just can't contain myself over this place. A small BYOB, my husband and I decided to give Otto Strada a try after hearing from several people that it was just "average". I'm happy to say that after coming here with a hefty appetite, we both left utterly satisfied. We tried the caprese salad, spicy mussels (a special that night), and some olives to start. Everything was to perfection. For dinner I ordered the orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, which was quite possibly the best pasta dish I've ever had. Overall, a wonderful ambiance and no complaints besides the small size of the restaurant. Will definitely be visiting again soon and recommending to family and friends.
2015-11-19,4,The food was absolutely amazing. I ordered the eggplant parm and my sister orders the lasagna. The service wasn't the greatest but the food definitely made up for it. It's also nice that it is a BYOB. I definitely want to go back to try the pizza & especially the nutella pizza!
2015-11-15,5,My wife and I went to Otto Strada last night for dinner.  It was our first time there and the place was packed and the scene was great.They have a number of great options from appetizers, pizzas, pastas and main courses.  We started with the Polpo (Drunken Octopus), which was outstanding.  We also enjoyed the Crostini with Filet Mignon and Gorgonzola cheese.My wife ordered the lasagna and I ordered the Salmon with maple glaze.  Both entrees were great.  The portions are incredibly generous (my wife could only eat half of the lasagna).  For dessert, we split a nutella brownie.  As an added bonus, the restaurant is BYOB.  Authentic Italian Food, a great scene and great people.  I highly recommend Otto Strada.
2015-09-30,3,I've heard many great reviews about this place, so I decided to try Otto Strada for the first time last night and thought the food was just okay. Even though I was looking forward to trying a new Hoboken restaurant, I actually felt the whole experience was a bit underwhelming. All in all, it wasn't terrible and it wasn't great. My boyfriend and I decided to start off with the bruschetta -- a starter I always look forward to -- but was disappointed that it was overall very bland. Unseasoned, diced tomatoes and onions on hard bread -- definitely felt like it was missing some excitement! I asked for fresh shaven parmigiana to accompany the bruschetta and table bread and was surprised that it was jarred and not too fresh. For my meal, I ordered the pollo limoncello (without artichokes) and paired it with the asparagus instead of the fingerling potatoes. I did feel the limoncello gave the chicken a very unique, delicious taste. Was very refreshing and almost tingled on your tongue. The asparagus was also tasty but a bit mushy, as if it were drowning in olive oil. My boyfriend ordered the the steak pizzaiola. It was a unique concept, but just okay in taste. He would have preferred the steak paired with pasta instead of spinach. We decided to skip dessert, although the options did seem tasty but a bit expensive (around $10-$15). Our bill came to about $65 total - at least I was able to take some of the chicken home for lunch the next day and get two meals out of it! Despite the average meal, I can say our waiter was very attentive and accommodating throughout the night. However, I don't think Otto Strada is a place I would recommend or come back to anytime soon.
2015-09-01,4,The service was great. We waited for a seat outside and they gave my pregnant wife a seat to sit in while we waited.  We had pasta with meat sauce and a meatball pizza. It was all great.
2015-08-24,3,Really? What's the fuss all about? Maybe we went on an off night but...Otto Strada was very very average for us :(Octopus appetizer was not great...a little fishy and definitely confirmed that I prefer much smaller grilled octopus. The crostini with burrata and roasted tomatoes app was quite good. The giant meatball was really delicious, but not so earth-shattering that we'd go back when everything else was so average. The eggplant parm was lukewarm and soggy...I hardly ate any of it, ugh. My guy had the chicken milanese and while I normally always try his dishes, I took his word for it when he said it was just ok. Again nothing to write home about. We had went in excited about the dessert menu and planning to order at least one, but decided against it after our sampling of dishes. Just really not jazzed about this place and won't be back, especially not with all of the great Italian places in Hobo.
2015-08-19,2,The food was good.  Nothing worth writing home about, but still good.  I would give this place 3.5 to 4 stars on the food alone, but the service was TERRIBLE.  It took over an hour for us to get our food.  The waiter told us the kitchen was backed up with delivery and take out orders, but come on.  Are you going to prioritize delivery over people that actually came to your restaurant?  I would love to recommend this place, but don't come here expecting a quick dinner.
2015-08-15,5,We go at least once every week. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Food is beyond great. Interesting specials always available that keeps things exciting. The Italian fish stew is BEYOND amazing. They don't rush you out, it's byob, charming aesthetic, outdoor seating available.....What more can I say? You have to try it!
2015-08-10,5,I went here for Brunch this past Sunday not thinking an Italian brunch is what I was looking for....well I was wrong.  This place is GREAT. BYOBI had the French Toast so yummy...it was the Breakfast Pie with asparagus tips, bacon, eggs..cheese the light fluffy kind...OMG so damn good...and CRISPY CRUST.Coming back for Dinner :)
2015-08-05,5,The eggplant parm is delicious. The sausage and broccoli rabe appetizer is delicious. The pizza is delicious. Small spot but great atmosphere. I love this spot
2015-08-05,5,I love this place. The menu selection is fantastic and mouth-watering. I tried several appetizers and all were delicious and fresh. Great selection of antipasto trays.
2015-07-31,4,Otto Strada is one of the newer Italian restaurants in Hoboken. Opened a little over a year, this BYOB is popular and is busy most of the time.  The casual restaurant is no doubt noisy and lively inside (There is also outdoor seating).  The service is friendly, accomodating and not overbearing. My dinner with with two friends started with complimentary focaccia and olive oil, nice yet I'd prefer some Italian bread included in the basket. We ordered Nonna's mussels to share, fresh and tasty, unexpectedly spicy. I kept it old school and ordered eggplant parmigiana which I enjoyed.  My friends went with salads and were satisfied (adding grilled shrimp to the salad was perfect). Delicious gelato for dessert. A small suggestion would be to offer ground pepper and grated Italian cheese during the service.  Overall we all had a fun time, a good dinner, and would go again.
2015-07-30,4,Ate here last night for the first time.  Wasn't crowded at 7:30 on a Wednesday.  Bruschetta was excellent and overflowing with fresh diced tomato, onion and basil.  The spinach and Gorgonzola salad was also good.  Entrees included the meatball, a pasta with burratta and red sauce, the planked salmon and the eggplant.  Lots of good stuff to choose from AND it's BYO.
2015-07-26,1,Food was not what we expected . Staff was not friendly, Each table next to us had different experiences. We weren't told of any specials, and the table next to us did. The other table received bread and the others didn't. Very inconsistent.  I would not go back. Prices are overpriced from the portion of food and especially for the area. Food was not what we expected and not great.
2015-07-25,5,Had a wonderful dinner here last night. Food was excellent, traditional in many ways but always with a special touch or an imaginative twist to the dishes. Has quickly become my favorite restaurant.
2015-07-17,5,So we had seven people from abroad and we were able to beg for a reservation which was a amazing!We order a ginormous meatball and spicy corn as an app. It was amazingI had the lemon chicken and my cousin had the vegetable lasagna. It was so amazing I can't wait to go back. Aces
2015-07-14,5,Went here last weekend on a Saturday night with a group of 4.... Had to wait about 45 minutes, but ended up going down the street to another bar and they called us when the table was ready. We got to sit outside on what was a perfect night weather wise for mid-July. We had a great corn on the cob appetizer special which was out of this world. We also had the shrimp appetizer - very good. For my meal I had the carbonara which was not too heavy as this can be a heavier dish. The sauce was thin enough, and the pasta so fresh. In our group we had the seafood cioppino, one pound meatball and vegetable pasta. All amazing! And the price was perfect, especially because we had 2 bottles of our byob wine. Highly recommended and worth the wait!
2015-07-11,4,Went back again. The menu has changed since they reopened. No more polenta :( but, wow the octopus appetizer... It felt like they gave us a whole octopus. It was delicious
2015-06-07,4,Nice place. Good food. No complaints. Will go again soon!  My son who is very fussy loves the pizza
2015-05-31,4,Living right down the street from here I've been here quite a few times. I've held off on reviewing because my experiences have varied, but Otto Strada is on a recent hit streak with me. You can't beat the byob experience and their pizza has improved with each visit. I love the one pound meat ball appetizer as well as the eggplant rolotini. Otto Strada is worth the visit!
2015-05-30,5,This restaurant is exceptional. We went today for the first time for brunch and shared the truffle mushroom egg pizza: it was to die for. It very well may be the best pizza I have had in NYC and hobo so far and involves two of my favorite foods: eggs and truffles. I love that the best pizza I have ever eaten is made by a Mexican chef....this always impresses me when a person masters a cuisine different from that of their homeland. Where I grew up, the best Persian Kabob was made by a Nepalese chef.  Then, in Japan, the chefs master everything...the best Italian pastry I ever ate was in a train station in Kyoto.....I literally followed my nose to the bakery. The service is very kind and the atmosphere is relaxed and nonpretentious.  Look forward to returning for dinner.
2015-05-24,5,Food is delicious- every single item I've ever ordered. Service is good dining in or take out delivery. BYOB- can't complain. I'm a happy girl when I eat from here.
2015-05-18,5,I love this place - what a great neighborhood spot! My husband and I came here on a Sunday night and were seated immediately. We both ordered a pizza and found them delicious. Nothing too fussy but very good nonetheless. Their menu is awesome - tons of pizza, pasta and appetizer options - and we can't wait to go back and try more. They also have an awesome brunch menu that I plan on enjoying soon!The decor is very cute - simple and cool - and the service was attentive and fast. Definitely recommend for a casual but great brunch or dinner.
2015-05-17,1,Sub par food. Sub par ownership. Give this one a wide berth- there are plenty of better Italian options in Hoboken
2015-05-15,1,I can honestly say I have never experienced baby discrimination like this before. I went to this restaurant tonight with the best intentions with my husband and toddler for dinner, and I was told my toddler's stroller, even folded was a fire hazard and denied entry. Needless to say we left because I knew this was a lie as most restaurants in the area are beyond accommodating. When I researched this being a fire hazard upon returning home and realized it was a lie, I called to discuss with the manager, hoping he would just admit he doesn't want kids in the restaurant and he HUNG UP ON ME! This place is in a prime area with kids, and was half empty at 6pm but even at that hour to display this behavior I surely hope they are closed within the year.
2015-05-06,4,Been living here for 4+ years and never tried this spot until last night!  Good find.  The plus/reason for the 4 stars - BYOB, bit more upscale Italian in terms of decor/ambiance presentation, menu items v majority of restaurants in HBK.  Good service as well.  Sat outside on a beautiful, warm night and it's a pretty block to have a restaurant. Owner even came over to say hello!Food was probably a 3 - We LOVED the burrata crostini with honey & roasted tomatoes.  But I agree with others that there's something not quite there.  My gnocchi's sausage/meat was a bit bland and so was the sauce & it tasted like it was nuked in the microwave.  That said, not terrible, and while a bit pricey, the portions are indeed HUGE.  My dish could easily have fed two people, the pizza as well. Will def. come back.
2015-04-28,4,Ordered delivery from here the other night - pizza was delicious (Quattro stagioni) and the inside out calzone rosso (FANTASTIC). Will definitely order from again and am looking forward to sitting down there in the near future.
2015-04-25,1,I called at 615pm to let the restaurant know I had a party of 8 arriving at 730pm to see if they could take a reservation. I was informed they did not take reservations but was reassured multiple times that we could arrive at 7pm to "put our names down" and have no issues getting table. The party of 8 walked across town to the restaurant only to be told there was a two hour wait and when I mentioned what the person on the phone said all I received was a shrug of the shoulders. That is one of the most unprofessional ways for a restaurant to handle an issue. Needless to say I will never go to Otto Strada and neither will the 7 other friends (including 2 people who say they love this place) that walked across town only to be lied too and turned away.
2015-04-11,5,worth the wait.  the byob is great (there's a beer/wine/liquor store on the NW corner of 7th & Park).  place is clean.  amazing food.  try going just after 10pm for a late dinner, usually a few tables open around that time.
2015-03-21,4,If you want a great Italian meal that makes you feel like you are at your Nonna's house on a Sunday afternoon this is your spot! We had the best meal here last night. We ordered way too much so we have lots of leftovers which I am very happy about. The two of us got a pepperoni pizza, sausage/broccoli rabe/ ricotta salata/long hot peppers appetizer, giant meatball dinner, creamy mushroom pasta with breadcrumbs dinner, and a zeppoli stuffed with cannoli cream topped with powdered sugar and a cherry for dessert. Everything was amazing! My favorites were the pizza and the meatballs. The pizza had the best tasting thin crust and the sauce on the giant meatball was addicting. Everything was so good though. The service was great too. A waiter even ran out in the snow to get us more wine from the liquor store around the corner when we ran out! Prices were fair too. I love this place.
2015-03-10,4,Went here on a Friday night with a friend for her birthday.  We waited maybe 10 minutes for a table for two.  We ordered way too much food and he told us, but we figured we could just take the leftovers home for the weekend.  First course - kale salad. It was good, but I wouldn't get it again.  Second course - meatball.  Really good sauce and was nice for leftovers the next day. Third course - Crispy prosciutto pizza and cioppino.  The pizza was really good, thin and flavorful.  The cioppino was fine.  I wouldn't order it again because I really want to try some of the homemade pasta.  Dessert - nutella calzone. This was so good and rich with nutella and mascarpone cheese.  We each took two pieces of pizza home and a good portions of the meatball and dessert. I had enough for lunch and dinner the next day and dessert twice.  I believe our bill was $80 before tip and we really did over order.After we ordered, the server asked if we would move tables to accommodate a large group that was really cramped at one of the tables.  They were so nice about it, we were happy to oblige.  They even gave us a dessert, which we never would have ordered, but it was delicious.I've heard some restaurants in Hoboken rush you out or give you not so subtle hints that they have people waiting and want you to leave.  We never felt that way at Otto Strada and we were there for a long time.  The manager and other servers thanked us for moving tables and I would give overall service 4.5 stars.  Looking forward to going back soon!  Big plus for BYOB which helps keep the bill down.
2015-03-02,3,Mediocre meal. The ambiance is on point as was service. BYOB. Not sure on corkage fee. 5-stars on portion size. Whoa Nelly! Hope you're starved. Most memorable dish: crostini di burrata - caramelized tomatoes, burrata, honey, basil, evoo, sea salt. Bellissimo! I opted for the capellini con pancetta. Man, I was ready for a burst of flavors! Smoked bacon, brussels, criminis, rosemary, romano. But, something was missing. It was surprisingly bland. Womp womp. I heard the same about the 16oz meatball. Just a big ol flavorless hunk o meat in a cute lil cast iron. Another shared 'meh' sentiment was for the tortellini stuffed with braised veal + beef. I did have a lovely bite of the pollo limoncello. Nicely done! Dine at your discretion. Maybe an off night for flavor? The ingredients and portion size are there.
2015-02-27,5,I'm surprised and almost mad at a lot of the reviews here.I've been here many times, and have never been disappointed. I've come with a group of 10 and had a great time, and i've come on dates and had an equally good experience. First of all it's BYOB and the prices are totally reasonable. The food is pretty traditional, and very good. Stop comparing it to Anthony David's which is literally twice the price. It's kind of loud....like most restaurants that are filled with people enjoying themselves. Go sit at home with your boring girlfriend if you want to eat in silence. Staff is always friendly. The restaurant is beautiful with a lot of exposed brick and cool tables. In summary: don't come here if you want to hear yourself chew and you like bad food.
2015-02-24,5,Love this place! Staff is so kind and accommodating. Food is amazing for brunch and dinner!! This is my go to place with friends and family!
2015-01-26,5,This is a cute Italian restaurant with very good food and nice ambiance.  Having been to Italy numerous times I would say the menu options resemble things you'd actually find in the country rather than just the typical Jersey Italian fare at most local restaurants.  I've been here probably 6 times and ordered take out just as many and have always had good service and enjoyed the food.  Some of the other reviewers said it was loud - yes the acoustics make this place a bit loud when it is crowded, but would you rather a weird silent setting?  It's similar to Anthony David's noise wise.  Would definitely recommend!
2015-01-05,4,Totally don't understand the negative review. This is a tiny BYOB in the heart of Hoboken. I enjoyed a freshly made linguine with homemade pesto sauce, mushrooms and veggies that was delicious. The serving size was generous and it was even better as a leftover. I will definitely be visiting here again.
2014-12-18,5,2nd time at Otto . Food and service fantastic. It's a great neighborhood Resturant  with really good Italian food. Love the antipasto.  My only problem is Otto is not in my neighborhood.
2014-12-03,4,I've been here a few times and the food is consistently good. Yes it can get loud but it's a small restaurant. I've always received great service as well. Not sure what all the two star reviews are about.
2014-11-22,4,All these 2 star reviews bother me...this place is LEGIT. It's small, yes. Loud, yes. But in Hoboken, it's perfect for an intimate meal in an area that's not overpopulated with the usual Friday crowd. My roommate suggested it for an impromptu girls night. BYOB, AWESOME. We DID have to wait 40 minutes for a table, so off to Finnegan's we went for a glass of wine (right around the corner) and it was painless. We started with the cheese plate on the specials menu, which was phenomenal. My roommate and I love cheeses - the stinkier the better - so it was an no-brainer, and for $20 it was well worth it for a hefty piece and a half of bleu cheese with Gorgonzola crumbled on top (cheese on cheese on cheese!), fresh mozzarella & tomato, parmigiana reggiano drizzled in balsamic, and some stinky slab of unidentifiable cheese that was ridiculously good. We also pigged out on the buratta crostini, as I'm a sucker for a good buratta. And boy, was it good. Fresh and light, drizzled in honey and absolutely perfect. We went with pastas for our main dishes, she the gnocchi and me and orrechette with sausage and broccoli rabbe, my go-to. The gnocchi was great. Dense, but not paste-y in your mouth or belly. She was disappointed in the red sauce, just because there was SO much of it and she's not a huge red sauce person, and the menu promised saffron in the gnocchi (which I did taste a hint of). My pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. A light olive oil and mild hint of heat in the sausage, mmmmmmm! Awesome. I really hope this place gets better reviews soon, because I fully endorse it. Keep doin your thang, Otto Strada.
2014-11-14,4,One of the best dinners I've had whilst living in Hoboken. My girlfriend and I went here over the summer. We sat outside and enjoyed the summer evening. The appetizer was hit or miss. A combo platter of different roasted peppers, olives and cheeses. But the chicken prosciutto [PROSCIUTTO E ARUGULA] with tomato, arugula and shaved parmesan entree was far and away the best dinner I've had. My girlfriend had it this time and ate every last bite [which she never does]. Recently we took my mother there for her birthday. Once again it lived up to the hype. We did cured meats and cheeses for the app. I had the seafood stew. Unbelievable. The other two entrees were, again, PROSCIUTTO E ARUGULA and BRACIOLA DI MAIALE "PORK CHOP" ALLA PARMIGIANA. Winners all around. Yes it is loud inside. But that isn't a huge drawback. Plus, being a byob, you can drink enough to drown out the other tables. Service needs work. But I couldn't recommend Otto Strada any more.
2014-11-14,4,I'm so surprised at the 2 and 3 stars, I love this place! I've been twice and both times the food was delicious, service great and ambiance sweet. I didn't find it to be over the top loud, personally. First time there were 4 of us, then my hubby and I went alone....I was able to hear fine in both situations. We had the octopus app, the cheese and meat plate and a pizza to start - all were delicious! For entrees we all tried something different and each of us loved our meals. The second time I had the 16 oz meatball...omg! Biggest and most delicious meatball ever!!! I would highly recommend this little gem.
2014-10-11,2,The service at this place isn't the best, the waitress wasn't very accommodating toward my friend who has a gluten allergy and we went there because they had "g free options"We ordered the caprese and took a few bites and we both said the mozzarella tasted strange - like cleaning product. We sent it back and it turns out they messed up while making it and put sugar in it instead of salt. How does that happen? It's a lackluster Italian place in Hoboken and I won't be going back.
2014-09-28,5,Happened to discover Otto Strada this weekend where I went with my son &  his friends for dinner Saturday night. The boys live in Hoboken and didn't know of this place. They all had the pizza and said it was amazing and were so glad to find a new place that is good & off the beaten path to go to. Great and huge kale salad was spectacular as well. The atmosphere was perfect and the grilled octopus was to die for. I can't say enough good about this place. The staff was more then accommodating. I've been to quite a few places for dinner in Hoboken and this by far was my favorite. I'm not a fan of Washington street and love that this little gem is away from all the hustle & bustle. Can't wait to go back and try the meatball.  Thanks for surpassing my expectations!!! :)
2014-09-25,2,In line with the majority of reviews, the restaurant is loud, service is inconsistent and food is OK.I had their short rib and brussel sprout ravioli special. Both things I enjoy separately, but an odd combination together. The dish would have probably been much better sans sprouts. My friend had the fig and prosciutto pizza and he also seemed underwhelmed.  Overall, this restaurant is on par with many of the other Italian places in Hoboken- OK food, but nothing worth going out of your way for.
2014-09-19,5,For byob you can go wrong . Otto's staff was great attentive but not overbearing . The place is tastefully done . For starter we had the polpo one of the best I've had and i cant wait to try the one pound meatball. Entree we had quattro formaggi pizza and the eggplant parm witch has ricotta in the middle and gives it such a different taste from your regular eggplant parm . I highly recommend Otto Strada
2014-09-19,5,Love love love this place . Service was excellent . I was there on Tuesday our waitress was great . We started out with the meatball and has to be the best tasting meatball ever. Entrees we had the chicken Milanese and the special short rib ravioli with Brussels sprouts in a brown butter sauce both delicious . I can't wait to come back
2014-09-15,4,Have been here several times for dinner-- great neighborhood restaurant. The super huge meatball entree and the kale salad are absolutely scrumptious. It's BYOB, which is fun. Only drawback is the service--- can be incredibly slow.
2014-09-01,1,Horrible experience at Otto strada. Meatball appetizer was bland and had no taste. For the entree I ordered the eggplant Parmesan .  I took my first bite and there was a long piece of hair in between the cheese and eggplant. Disgusting. Waitress was apologetic but when she showed the owner the hair instead of coming over to my table and apologize he walked across the street to talk to his friend. The owner nick has no clue how to run a restaurant. I will not be dining at Otto strada any longer.
2014-08-08,5,Love,love, love this place.Last week was my first time trying it out and I had the eggplant. The fresh mozzarella and the sauce were perfect and the eggplant was cooked just right. Shared a side of asparagus that tasted wonderful.Tonight I had the brasiole (sp) special and it was absolutely amazing. Both times I've been there we sat outside so I really can't comment on the noise level. We did sit right near the open door and I can honestly say that it really didn't seem loud inside and the place was full.The service was great. Our order was taken quickly and the food was brought out in a timely manner. Not too fast and certainly not too slow. The waiter was friendly and attentive and the owner made the rounds seeing to it that everyone was happy.Unlike most other Hoboken restaurants, Otto Strada is unpretentious and it's obvious that all of the energy is put into delivering quality food at a reasonable price.I don't get the 3 star rating because in my opinion, it's a definite 5 star place.It's a BYOB so the Frat House atmosphere that is so prevalent in many Hoboken restaurants isn't a factor. I'll be back again because as I watched the other people eating, I was making a mental note about what I'll be ordering next time.Can't wait to try the gnocci!!!I finally found a restaurant in town that can be my "go to" place.
2014-08-08,5,We were looking for a change of pace & being the last week of restaurant week - something off the grid and new.  We came upon this via hudson  restaurant week and after reviewing the menu - were impressed. The owner Nick - told us 20 mins and sorry but had previous reservations. given it is restaurant week and a friday night - completely reasonable.  this place is well worth the wait. this will become Erin and my - go to Italian restaurant. Amazing
2014-07-31,5,Wow! We went for dinner and it the food was amazing.  The best part part was the short rib raviolis...delicious. We sat outside, the weather was nice, the staff was attentive and if I lived in Hoboken I would definitely add this to my regular rotation of restaurants.  If you like authentic Italian food, you will not go wrong here!
2014-07-26,5,Excellent BYOB Italian restaurant in Hoboken. The food was amazing! The decor is industrial and the atmosphere is warming. And the staff was very welcoming. Already looking forward to going back!
2014-07-24,4,I love this place! The 1lb meatball makes for the best appetizer and you can't bear BYOB. My personal favorite is the gnocchi. It is always cooked perfectly and the sauce is fantastic. If you are still hungry after try the nutella dessert pizza.
2014-07-01,2,I live in the neighborhood and  excitingly waited forever for it to open. I've been three and half times hoping it would be a favorite. The half time was because I walked out finally after the extremely rude black curly hair women gave us an attitude about not having a reservation yet half the place was empty. When I did eat there - over priced for what you get, poor service, and just not worth the hassle to be honest. Much better places in Hoboken with nicer staff to spend your money. Wish it was better and I would be there a few times a week. Oh - s
2014-06-18,4,I'm so glad I ignored the crummy 3 star average and tried this place! While most of the complaints were true (deafeningly loud, hands-off service) I found the quality and creativity of the food was worth the price. I went with a friend and we were more focused on catching up than the frequency of the wait staff checking in on us. We did have to yell a little to hear each other across the table, they really need to hang some curtains or tapestries to muffle the sound. We ordered a couple yummy dishes to share, and I could easily go back and order the rest of the menu because it looked so good. We had the bruschetta which was standard but yummy and came with like 6 heaping pieces of toast. We split the kale salad, which was huge and hearty- kale, white beans, thyme, and pumpkin seeds. Don't skip this one. We were pretty full but had ordered arugula pizza which was great- fresh toppings on a tasty, chewy crust. We didn't take advantage of the BYOB but others appeared to. FYI, they don't take Amex. Venture off the beaten path for this one, and maybe sit outside weather permitting- you won't be disappointed!
2014-05-20,5,We had a very pleasurable dining experience at Otto Strada the other night. Our family was celebrating my birthday. My son, who lives in Hoboken recommended this place having dined there himself,. After reading the reviews, I attempted to change the plan and go to one of the several other places that I had gone to in the past. My son insisted upon Otto emphasizing that his girlfriend was excited about going there. I am so glad that I listened to his advice. This place is rated right at the top of any of the many fine Hoboken restaurants. I am a foodie and love going out for meals. Since our party of 6 was the noisiest group that night, I can't complain about the noise level. The decor is Simple Manhattan Eatery Style. Nothing fancy, simple and comfortable. The waiter was excellent. He was very attentive and prompt. A very personable, likeable guy who really cared. We ordered Salsiccia for our appetizer which is Sausage, broccoli rabe, ricotta salata and grilled hot Italian peppers and a pizza. Mmmm, so good! Great flaver and texture. The pizza was over the top. For the entre, my son and wife ordered the Melanzane alla Parmigiana. The serving was huge. It was layered and stacked, thinly sliced  the way I like it. Soooo good! My wife who is a fussy eater said that it was one of the best she has ever had. We took half of it home and had it last night for another dinner! (My son liked it too). My daughter, who also lives in 'Boken got a creamy Fettuccini dish that was excellent. I got the lasagna special. (a more traditional type not the one on the menu). Again, huge portion was added to the next night dinner fare. The other two dishes were excellent from what they said. The boyfriend finished his, so I know it was good. I highly recommend Otto Strada. Go for yourself and please post a good review. Like my wife said, most of the people who post reviews are those who post negatively. We will be returning to this place again!
2014-05-18,4,New and right around the corner from me! Mix of indoor/outdoor - but be warned: indoor seating is tight & they take only reservations for half the restaurant.It's BYOB so that's awesome. We ordered gnocchi with tomato/sweet sausage and the fettuccine pesto pasta w/ goat cheese (special). Gnocchi itself was perfect texture. Fettuccine was great - but pretty sure that was vodka sauce...not pesto.Anyway...whatever. We'll likely be back!
2014-05-13,3,I am also being generous in giving this place 3 stars.  I feel that it def has potential, but I have come here 3-4 times to try many of the different dishes to give it a chance.  The hostess//waitress is extremely nice and always is great.  However, if I'm here to rate the food, I've been very disappointed the last two times.  We always try a variety, but the dishes are many times missing something.  Either too bland, or some strange flavor that is not necessary.  Really dry lasagna or not enough sauce.  It varies though by the day.  The Carbonara is one of the worst I have had in a long time.  The gnocchi was very disappointing as well.  The sausage in the sauce was not sausage but a beef bolognese that was used in some special that night...The eggplant can be good if you ask for extra sauce, otherwise very dry.   I hope they can get it together and succeed since it's a lovely neighborhood spot and BYOB.
2014-05-11,1,I was looking forward to it as it came recommended by a friend. I didn't like the food at all. It was too heavy and not flavorful. It seems they are trying to make their dishes "unusual", but instead of unusual and good, they may be unusual but below average. Gnocchi was not good and neither was linguine (too creamy). You would think such basic Italian dishes with sauces should be great.
2014-05-11,1,This place has horrible customer service. I went in there on Mothers Day (with my baby in a stroller) to grab an ice coffee- thinking they gotta have great Italian coffee. First of all the chick behind the counter NEVER offered to help me navigate the steps with my stroller. Then I finally get up to the counter and I'm told they don't serve ice coffee to go. I then said that I would stay there to drink it and they told me, um no not today we are busy. Well there were only two tables that were occupied (which should have been a bad sign in the first place being that it's Mother's Day). Never coming back and trust me I'm someone who eats out a lot! They won't last long with kind of customer service.
2014-05-10,3,Nice little BYOB place off the beaten path. The service was not that good, our waitress was very slow and catered to other tables who sat down after us. She also messed up our order, but they made up for it by offering us free dessert, which was a nice addition to the meal. The food is interesting Italian, not your common items--I like that. The food was good but the space was a little cramped. I wouldn't suggest going there with a large group, maybe just a low key date night with a bottle of wine.
2014-05-08,2,Cold bread, over priced, service is not good...  Limited menu, decor is nonexistent, do I need to continue?
2014-05-06,3,For Hoboken, this place is good. Dislikes- No bread for the table unless you ask for it and when you do, it's not good. Also, they do not/will not accommodate large parties and are always giving me a hard time asking whether I have a reservation when the place is dead on a Sunday at 5pm. Otherwise, food is good and tasty.
2014-05-02,5,Il migliore ristorante italiano di Hoboken.Only who don't know what is real  Italian food can talk bad about this place.Italian food is made simple and using great element.Best tomato sauce,best octopus , great spaghetti with peperoni sauce.Buonissimo.MI fa sentire come a Firenze.Grazie
2014-04-12,2,Appetizers were all solid but the entrees were pretty bland.  Overall still a pretty good bang for your buck, our bill was under $100 for 3 people.  All the staff, although clearly harried, were very nice and accommodating.
2014-04-11,3,Came on a Friday date night around 10 pm.Place is small and fits about 30 people. More of an Americanized Italian restaurant than a traditional Italian restaurant. Place is BYOB, which is a plus. Rustic and brick ambience. We ordered the hanger steak and salmon with penne pasta. Food  was average, nothing special. Waiter was subpar. Although he was informative about the menu, he lacked attention. Only came to our table 3 times ( once to place order, to give is our food, and to ask for the check).  Overall average food and below average customer service.
2014-04-03,4,Great little BYOB spot on the corner of 8th & Park...just off the beaten path.  I really liked the design.  Small and rustic looking.  The menu was impressive...and a nice variation from the "typical" Hoboken Italian restaurant.  I would call this more Tuscan style cuisine.  Everything we tried was great.  My girlfriend is a vegetarian, and really wanted the gnocchi.  Unfortunately the gnocci alla malloreddus already has meat in the sauce, so they were nice enough to prepare her pesto gnocci instead (which is not on the menu).  It was off the charts.  The table next to us actually saw her dish and asked for the same thing.  I would definitely recommend trying out this hidden gem.  Make sure you have reservations!  There are only about 12 tables in the whole place and I saw them turning people away at the door.
2014-04-02,3,Food was fantastic and service was great.  But unfortunately it was SO LOUD it was not enjoyable.  Won't be back..
2014-03-27,2,Let me start by saying I wasn't impressed. The bistro is small and simple, new American style of an eatery. The place felt as if it had shades of Dozzino, great place, also in Hoboken. The space seemed intimate enough for a date night, while relaxed enough for casual dining. Throw in BYOB and you would normally have me hooked. But there was something off. Maybe it was the 5 min wait at the hostess's podium for the assumed owner to acknowledge us while she finished a phone call (considering it's a tiny place it's hard to not see the only people standing in the only walking aisle in the entire tiny restaurant) or the sense that everyone else who were seated after us seemed to be brought a basket of bread first. There was something not quite right for me. Our waiter was pleasant. He attempted to walk us through the night's specials and some portions of the menu but seemed too hurried to answer questions about additions of pasta to meat selections. My girlfriend had the OTTO STRADA'S POLPETTA DI NONNA (a gigantic beef meatball in marina sauce) with a side of linguine. I had a linguine dish with a cream sauce and thought it was pedestrian. We shared the INSALATA DI CAVOLO VERDE(A kale salad) which was fresh and tasty. I really enjoyed the mango vinaigrette, although it did have the hint of something you could have made at home. I think that actually might sum up the entire dining experience for me. It all seemed like something I could have pulled together at home. Overall the experience was subpar for the pricing of a meal that requires matching between Insalata, Primi and Secondi. One benefit of doubt; we did not have a chance to experience their pizzas, so that might get us back into the building.
2014-03-24,2,Went with another couple this past Friday night, and it was just "okay".  Reservations definitely need to be made about a week in advance for a Friday or Saturday night since the place is small and gets crowded with not much standing room to wait.  The quality of our food was good and tasty, however it was just too expensive for the portions that they give you.  We started with a pizza as an appetizer, but it was more like a personal pizza - each slice was literally 1 1/2" wide!  Good enough to share as a starter, but we just expected bigger.  I had the egglplant parm, which was tasty enough but assumed it would come with a side of pasta - it did not.  My husband ordered the bucatini carbonara and loved it, but was still left hungry.  They style their menu the way Italy does where you order a primi and then a secondi, but in Italy a primi is about $7, not $17, for a small bowl.  We definitely don't mind an expensive meal, but expect to get what you pay for.  Hoboken Italian restaurants tend to be generous in portion size and this is where Otto Strada lacks in comparison.  It's still fairly new, so I'll take it with a grain of salt and maybe try it again in a few months.
2014-03-14,2,I'm disappointed. I was really looking forward to having dinner at Otto Strada but I will not go back again. Pros: the kale salad was very good. Cons: The meal was rushed which I think is common at the small BYOB places. However, our entrees were served immediately as our salad bowls were cleared and we were asked (not politely) to vacate our table moments after paying the check. (If you are expecting to turn the table over after 1 hr it would be better to let us know in advance). My pasta dish (orecchiette) was very underseasoned. It tasted like a similar dish I make at home and I'm not a great cook. For BYOB Italian I'll stick with Anthony David's. The food and service far exceed this restaurant.
2014-03-14,3,I'm being generous giving 3 starts to this newly established Italian bistro/restaurant because I think it has some potential and I am willing to give it another chance before throwing in the towel. Here's my experience from Thursday night's dinner:The place is small and crowded so reservations are a must in my book.Since we made reservations, we were seated right away and given menus.However, the waiter didn't take our order until we frantically waved him over. This pattern repeated throughout the night and in a place that's 500 sq. ft at best, that's not an excuse. The gnocchi that I ordered were not worth the $18 and were overpowered by heavy meat sauce and some spices I could not figure out. We saved some room for dessert because when dining Italian, dessert is a necessity. We opted for a chocolate fondant ganache cake because it was one of the only items on the menu under $10. Most dessert menu items ranged from $12-$16 like the nutella pizza, which sounded tempting even at $16.
2014-03-11,1,My husband and I were in the mood to try something different in Hoboken and since we've been pretty much everywhere this place came to mind. The food is average/slightly above average. Keep in mind the only things we ordered were The meatball entreePolenta sideAnd broccoli rabe appetizer with hot Italian sausage and peppers. The meatball I'd give an 8 outta 10. Real thick heavy rich red sauce and tender meatball. The polenta side was very disappointing. T was an exact round hockey puck side of polenta drowning in mushrooms, spinach and what looked like a butter sauce. (The menu just said "polenta". The waitress was great though and she gave us no issues returning it. But if they are going to put all those extra ingredients they should list them in the menu. Then the rabe appetizer. Well nothing about it was spicy. So much so that my husband who hates spice ate it. The ricotta salata was shredded not shaved. Big mistake since it's such a salty cheese and always shaved thin. Plus there was a big handful of it atop the broccoli rabe which really took away from the food. The sausage was sliced and symmetric as well as tasting like grocery store sausage as opposed to something more homey. I will say that the quality of products seemed pretty good (sausage aside) and the pizzas looked great on the table beside us. I gave : stars because I feel while nothing like this is in Hoboken it a leg down for those of us who really enjoy lighter italian Batali fare.
2014-02-28,1,I went to this restaurant last night and I will never go back. My "al forno" vegetables were from a birds eye brand frozen vegetable bag.My polenta was over cooked and dry.My salad was wilted. It's a busy Thursday night and there should be fresh everything.I'm also gluten free and they advertise gluten free friendly.  No. Only thing they had was gluten free pasta. I can make that at home.We were sitting at a 4-person table and the host tried to take away our other half of the table... There were 3 of us. Were we supposed to eat on top of each other?So disappointed.
2014-02-21,3,Average italian food, nothing special.  Went with my wife, and had an early reservation.We were only two of four people in the entire place, yet were placed at a table literally right next to the other couple.  The rest of the restaurant was empty!The waiter didn't remember the specials, but was nice enough.  They must have learned from previous customers because we received bread, which didn't seem to be the case when the place first opened.The chicken with prosciutto was good, but again not great.  Also had a caprese salad, which surprisingly came with quite a bit of vinegar (which I liked but some do not).All in all, felt the meal was ok but with all of the other options in Hoboken, not sure I'd return.
2014-02-16,4,Really enjoyed dinner here on a Wednesday night, with my wife, last week. Started with Octopus appetizer and Kale salad, both were great. Had the lasagna which had a fantastic flavor, also the eggplant which was decent. Love that it's BYO. Would definitely recommend.
2014-02-07,4,This place is worth checking out.  The food is very good to excellent.  First they take reservations which is great for a small restaurant in Hoboken.  Most do not.   They are new and are off to a good start and will only get better.  The reviewers who gave it lower ratings because of things like "no bread only kale chips" or "the lights were too bright" etc.  are idiots.  Each night is different and everyone has their opinion.  You can suggest they serve bread or lower the lights but don't base your ratings on things that don't speak to the quality of the food.  The good out way the negative.  It's family run and owned.  The octopus is amazing and the smaller menu is what keeps it fresh and very good.   Try it.  It's BYOB.  Yes, it gets loud so now you know.
2014-02-06,4,I went there with a friend on a Tuesday night. We had made reservations but I dont think we really needed them, we were seated right away. It is small inside and with only exposed brick and tile making up the interior, I noticed it gets quite loud in there. I felt I had to almost yell at my friend to keep the convo going. I suggest they put some tapestries or decorative sound deadening panels on the walls to kill the echo.Ok now on to the important stuff - the food!! It was really really delicious. I had the breaded chicken and it hit the spot. My friend had the eggplant and she loved her dish as well. After dinner we had dessert - the strawberry cheesecake. That was good also, except I had one small issue: the strawberries were still kinda frozen when I bit into them. Fresh strawberries would have been better. A minor issue. Maybe it was just an isolated thing. I didnt even bother the waitress over it. So all things considered, I would go back in a heartbeat.
2014-02-04,5,Loved this place for take out first then I visited. Nice friendly staff, owner was funny. Would love candles on the tables. Great portions. Delicious food! Finally a local place that can make a perfect grilled polpo that melts in your mouth. A hidden gem!
2014-02-02,3,This is more like a 2.5, but I'm feeling generous and feel this place has potential. We came around 9:30 on a Saturday night and had to wait about a half hour for a table to open up - this place is small, so I would recommend reservations. The hostess was very accommodating, and thanked us for waiting. The service from there was another story, however. Our waiter came over right away and gave us our menus and specials. We decided pretty quickly what we wanted, and then waited...and waited..and waited. We watched him go over to pretty much every other table, chatting and checking in with them. When we finally caught our attention, he said "Oh sorry, forgot about you guys". I'm generally pretty understanding, especially when it's the end of the night, but the place is so small that I don't understand HOW you can forget about us. Once we placed our order, our food was out quickly. The margarita pizza was good to start, and I was intrigued by the giant meatball with meat from their neighbor and local butcher Truglio's. The meatball was good, but nothing spectacular. It was lacking a little in flavor. My fiance thought his chicken milanese was average. We finished off the night with gelato, and were relieved to get out with a bill under $60 (BYOB, BTW).I think this place has potential and a menu (albeit on the small side, but I don't think that's an issue) to set themselves apart from other Italian restaurants in town. It's nice to see dishes other than the standard chicken parm or penne vodka on a menu. If they can step up the service and really perfect their dishes, they'll do very well.
2014-01-25,4,This food was delicious! I really enjoyed the ambience too. I'd go back...in fact im trying tonight but they have no tables available!
2014-01-18,4,The portions are huge! I had the saffron gnocchi with sweet sausage. It was amazing. The sauce here is rich, simple, and nearly completely free of acidic taste.  Very homemade!
2014-01-08,2,This new BYO Italian in Hoboken is very average.The decor is very nice, but they need to do something about the acoustics. With hard surfaces on floor, walls and ceiling, the noise level requires shouting to carry on conversation during dinner.As for the food, I was hoping for better. I ordered the "Pork Chop" parm. It was overcooked yet somehow served cold not to mention tough. They must cook it first and then fry it just before serving. It probably sat and got cold between steps. They need to figure out how to do this dish right, or drop it from the menu. I should have sent it back.My dinner companions all pronounced their dishes "ok" and "fine". Nobody said "this dish is awesome".Also, we all expect some bread and olive oil in an Italian restaurant. Is this a cost cutting measure? Seems short sighted if this is the case.They'll need to improve.
2014-01-06,4,A group of six of us tried this place on a Friday night. While the restaurant is small, we didn't feel overcrowded at all. Our server didn't exactly give off the warm of fuzzies, but the hostess was a doll and was super patient and accommodating when the credit card machine was on the fritz. As for the food? It was GREAT! Everyone loved his or her dish. Those dishes included the eggplant dish (a brick of cheesey goodness),GIANT meatball, gnocchi, etc. I loved that it was BYOB, as well. Thanks for having us (sorry we broke the water decanter) and I will be back!
2014-01-04,5,I just got back from having dinner at Otto Strada and everything was as good as it gets. I am a local business owner so I know how important quality is and this restaurant really is top notch. The ambiance is awesome with exposed brick and wood tables. Lindsay the hostess was absolutely fantastic! She came to the table, greeted us with a warm smile and checked in with us several times. Our waitress anna-maria was a doll and Nick (the chef) even checked in to make sure we were happy with our food. Kids are the biggest critic and my girls LOVED the brick oven pizza, vanilla gelato and the chocolate cake. I had the octopus and it was just delicious. I would go there again and I would definitely recommend trying this place out. Either for date night or a kid friendly dinner.
2014-01-03,3,Pros: Food we had was delicious. We had a pizza, eggplant parm, & chocolate cake. Cons: my husband & I called ahead to make a last minute reservation  2 times. The first time we were told the restaurant was currently empty, and they could seat us as long as we were finished in 45 minutes. I was a little turned off by this & we went elsewhere (and finished in 45 minutes). The 2nd time we called @ 6pm we heard that same story about an empty restaurant,  but had a 2 hr window before we needed to be out. It wasn't only isolated to phone calls. .. While we were eating,  we overheard the hostess ask a couple, "you'll be done by 8, right?" I find the open time limits to eating very strange and unwelcoming. I think they should be able to manage tables/reservations without telling the diner the time constraint....other small restaurants in hoboken do it. Next, Kale chips instead of bread is different,  but we felt we needed to definitely get an appetizer as we waited for our food. Lastly, while the eggplant was delicious (melts in your mouth) I was surprised that there wasn't anything with it. It was swimming in sauce and almost begging for even a small helping of pasta. Food we had was great, but still think they need to fine tune some things. Really love having a new restaurant close to home...
2013-12-29,4,This place is great.  Been there a few times with the wife.  So far we have had the Squid (real good), the eggplant parm (good), Bucatini (my favorite) and the sausage orecchiette  (just ok).  There are no specials right now, so looking forward to that.  Some minor comments:  Bread should be offered for the table (not just Kale chips). The parms should come with pasta (on side or over).  You can however order a side of kids pasta.  It is really cold in there so they should turn up the heat.Overall this place is really good and has a great atmosphere.
2013-12-27,2,I went with my three girlfriends in mid December.  The menu is way too light - like no options.  We got the octopus appetizer which wasn't good- my friend hated it.  Got the brushetta appetizer - eh.  I got a vegetable pizza spiced up.  Just eh.  My Italian friend hated the food. The place is too loud.  Go to Margheritas.  Soooo much better.
2013-12-23,2,My wife and I wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner and had heard about the newly opened restaurant so we decided to give it a try.  As an fyi, we are never ones to write a review but thought people who have heard of the restaurant but not yet been should be aware of.  We found fails throughout the experience - the wait, the food, the bill.The WaitTo set the scene, when we got to the restaurant there were 2 couples waiting ahead of us.  We walked in and the hostess seemed a bit confused - she was behind the counter and didn't approach or acknowledge us by the door (even though she stared our way).  So I walked up to the counter gave her my name, to which she said it would be 20 minutes.  We went outside and eventually the two couples ahead of us were called.  As we approached the 40 minute mark, a group of 8 in front of us walked in, waited outside for 10 minutes, after which the hostess came out to get them and failed to even acknowledge us.  Now that 50 minutes had gone by and the hostess had put together tables for this group ahead of us, we went back inside to ask about the hold up - apparently the hostess said that there was a table paying their bill. But 5 minutes later they were being served cake - so she flat out lied.  After almost 70 minutes we were seated.  We don't mind waiting but the hostess and the restaurant need to learn how to MANAGE EXPECTATIONS. To be fair, the hostess did offer to comp us a dessert but we graciously declined.The FoodEven though we were somewhat annoyed given our wait, we were determined not to have the experience ruin our dinner.  We can only vouch for what we had, which unfortunately was NOT that great.  First I guess they were in such a rush to seat us after the wait that they never filled our water until we asked - I think this is also a function of 1 waiter which doesn't work in there.  Another recco would be for the restaurant to have either 2 waiters or add a bus boy.  I ordered the orecchiette and my wife ordered the chicken milanese which we have had at multiple other places...the dishes were surprisingly bland and plates were rather small for the price...I guess we just expected more.  The BillNot a big deal, but we went to pay with an Amex to which we were told they only take visa/mc.  OverallIt was a strange experience and we were flat out lied to and ignored for the better part of an hour.  Discounting that however, and just based on the plates we had, it was a mediocre dinner experience, especially for the price.  Those that have never been may want to try it but for us, we can find better food elsewhere.
2013-12-23,3,New Italian place in town, I'm all in! The wife and I went  on a Friday night to check out the new kid on the block. The place is small and kinda your typical new Hoboken restaurant, exposed brick, reclaimed wood and subway tile. Not a negative just an observation. The place is small only about 10-12 tables mostly 2 tops they push together for larger parties. Like many restaurants in town you are sitting on top of other guests and having to move your table so people can get in. No biggie, it's the norm.For whatever reason this place is obscenely loud for a small place. I mean it has the acoustics of you singing in your shower.  This is a perfect place for 25 year old girls to drink wine and yell so be ready for that. We could barely hear over everyone else trying to talk over each other. So don't come here for a nice calm and romantic evening.On to the food. I will say everything on the menu sounds pretty good. We started with the crostini and it was delicious, actually my favorite part of the meal. There were 5 solid pieces that were just absolutely fantastic and full of flavor so after that we waited for entrees in excitement, alas not to be. I ordered the giant meatball with ricotta cheese and wife got carbonara. The meatball is literally just that a giant meat ball served on a cast iron skillet in red sauce with a few pieces of bread around it.  Add some pasta or something. The meatball itself was really just kinda "meh". To be honest it was disappointing it was kind of bland and in reality I've had a lot better. I watched the lasagna and some other dishes come out and I wish I would have gotten those. The sauce was good, it was the star of the dish which it shouldn't be. The "ball" just lacked true flavor.  The lady's was kinda bland for a carbonara, it definitely needed more seasoning or something it was also "meh" she didn't like it that much. None of it was the point of sending back we ate it all but neither of us would order those dishes again. For desert we got the chocolate cake, this was also just average, it tasted no different than a chocolate cake from shop rite. Tasty but just nothing that was over the top exciting. We should have gotten cheesecake or a cannoli.Overall the service was ok and food came out in a pretty reasonably time frame. It's also BYOB, which is a plus. Probably the most disappointing thing for us were the kale chips. It's an Italian restaurant, give me some bread, butter and olive oil! I'm half Sicilian and these are staples at every other joint and family table I guess maybe it's trendy or healthy. But let's be real, Italian food isn't health food. It's carbs, straight up lots of carbs. The kale chips were just so boring and I was so excited that there was bread on my meatball. If you're into rabbit food then you'll be thrilled.Overall, a straight average Italian place. Will I be back? Eh maybe after a while but it won't be my first choice for Italian in town.
2013-12-06,3,upon entry of the restaurant and being seated, watching the cook bring the waitress a dish of pasta behind the counter where she began to eat it and then came to our table with a mouthful of food in hers...because i watched her put the fork in her mouth then come to our table.  second, one person at our table asked for the sausage in a dish to be substituted for chicken and we were literally told, we can do it because there is nobody else in the restaurant.  when asked about a dish on the menu, the waitress began to tell us how one of the chefs girlfriends liked it.  the meatball was good, however, it needed more than 4 small slices of bread to accompany it.  kale chips were good but lets get serious, italians love bread and oil prior to their meal.  the papperedelle and bolognese was very good.  portions were small and a bit over priced.  train your waittress not to eat behind the counter in view of patrons and not to come to the table with a mouthful of food.  it was gross. and i suggest have them ask how our meal was during the meal instead of when we are paying the bill.there is hope to this establishment.
2013-12-03,5,Great food, atmosphere and service! Try the crostini it's amazing! Also, kid-friendly!
2013-11-24,5,My husband and I decided to venture out last night for a nice meal. We live across the street from this new restaurant and with the bitter cold, didn't want to travel too far. We were BEYOND pleasantly surprised with this new gem so close to home. We were greeted the moment we entered by the extremely friendly hostess (who just so happened to be the owner's wife which we later found out). The restaurant was packed and the ambience was upbeat. BYO was also an incredible added bonus!  We enjoyed a delicious meal from start to finish. The service was impeccable as the waitress was extremely attentive and timely. I would highly recommend the Bruschetta, Pappardelle alla bolognese and pollo alla milanese. The Italian desserts were also a nice touch to the end of our meal. I enjoyed a delicious gelato to quench my sweet palate. Everything looked delicious as we looked around at the other entrees amongst the tables nearby. The decour was very tastefully done with an inviting feel. The owner was beyond friendly and thanked us for coming in-you don't get that everyday! It had a family feel and the menu was based off of the grandmother's recipes. How great! My husband and I look forward to another meal soon at Otto Strada as we know it is a sure bet to be a great meal. I wish them the best of luck as they start their new business venture and suggest you venture in for some true tasty italian cuisine. It will not disappoint!
2013-11-24,4,We need more places like this in Hoboken. I've already frequented this establishment twice this week. Overall great food, good service and nice ambiance with a few tweaks this place could be a 5-star.The Good1) Chocolate Cake to die for2) The Pasta Dishes3) The Salads...ok fine. all the food is top notch.4) Kale Chips vs. Bread to start (YES!)5) Waitresses were all very helpful and nice6) BYOBThe Meh1) The Bruschetta - the bread isn't toasted...it tastes like the bread was microwaved with the toppings on top. This was surprising as all our other dishes were just amazing!2) Both times I went our water pitcher ran out (and it wasn't refilled)...think the place would run much smoother IMHO if they had a bus boy. 3) The music....the decor doesn't match the music (Top 40 hits?)...Perhaps a Gotan Project or something of that sort might match the ambiance a bit more?4) This isn't a Meh comment but...can you add a crab cake dish to the menu? Please!!!Overall, I will be frequenting this place quite often as its near my apt:)
2013-11-21,3,For me, Otto Strada was a solid 3.5 stars. We went on the second night they were open, and i"m sure they're still working out kinks.  I'll definitely update when we go again.Overall, I'm very happy to see this place open - it's nice to have a casual BYO option in the center of town.  We're always looking for a quick bite near home and are getting tired of Clinton Social.The food was good - not over the top, but solid and comfortable.  Pretty much what you'd expect to get from mom on a trip home - lol.  We started with the salsiccia which we very much enjoyed.  In fact, I enjoy the combo of broccoli rabe and sausage so much, I went with it again for dinner in the pasta dish.  It was more successful as an appetizer - I thought it was a bit bland in the pasta and needed some form of sauce.  My husband had the carbonara which was really very good.  Portion sizes were nice as well - not overwhelming.  We finished our plates and were perfectly satisfied.I liked the atmosphere overall, it's nicely decorated and the exposed brick wall is really nice. I did not like that they had the lights turned all the way up - it was so bright and lost all atmosphere. Note to restaurateurs - the easiest way to make your place feel cozy and intimate is to just lower the lights.Also, the NOISE. OMG.  There were only us and two other tables in there and it was SO LOUD I couldn't even think.  To be fair, one of the parties was loud and drunk and totally over the top, but still, there is nothing in the restaurant to absorb sound - no curtains, ceiling panels, nothing.  They really need to address that.Anyway, I wish this place well and hope they can work out the kinks - I think it's just what the area needs - a comfortable, casual place to go when you don't want to cook. I hope to give them a few weeks and try again!
2013-11-19,5,Second time eating at otto strada and even better this round!  Meatball is amazing!  The chicken Milanese is my favorite!!!!  Feels very cozy and the owners make you feel at home!  Will be a regular at this place!!!
2013-11-19,5,Went for the first time to experience wonderful service, delicious food, a great menu and great atmosphere where there was almost every table full, yet I could hear my husband talking the whole time (didn't get too loud.) I had the meat sauce and he had the lasagna.  Each delicious with a homemade-feel. BYOB! We will be back.
2013-11-18,5,We we walking in Hoboken today and came across a new Italian restaurant on Park and 8th. It was a pleasant surprise. We were warmly greeted by one of the owners and that set the tone for the rest of the meal. Everyone was attentive and very much focused on making sure we had a great customer experience. The foods on the menu are recipes of one of the owners grand mothers. Do not miss an opportunity to enjoy true Italian comfort food. There are so many choices, and as a group, we all decided to order something different and share. From the kale salad to the delectable desserts, the meal was delicious. The one thing that I would recommend is to call ahead and make a reservation. This is a small and unassuming place, but when the word gets out how good the food is, there will be lines out the door. This is a place where we ail go again and again. Glad to have authentic Italian in Hoboken.
2013-11-17,5,My friends and I decided to try this place yesterday evening following a movie. We had called ahead for a reservation, and they had our table waiting upon arrival (incidentally, the only one left in the intimately-scaled dining room). The décor is minimal, but modern and refined with wooden tables and exposed brick. After being seated, we were greeted by the owner's mother - a lovely, warm welcome that would set the tone for the service throughout the evening.   We began with a shared appetizer of salsiccia. The dish was very tasty and had a lovely balance of flavors with the salt from the sausage, the bitter from the broccoli rabe and the heat from the Italian hot peppers. I also had the soup of the day, cream of mushroom, which was delicious, creamy, well-seasoned and served as the perfect complement to a crisp autumn evening. For our entrees, I had the gnocchi with pork sausage while my dining companions had the pork chop parmigiano and the lasagna with portobello mushrooms. The presentation was straightforward but elegant, and having tasted each dish, I would recommend them all. The texture of the gnocchi was wonderful and the lasagna offered a unique take on a classic dish; lighter than your nonna's lasagna, the broad noodles had an unexpected but welcome char that added a great depth of flavor to the dish. Dessert comprised of a shared chocolate fondant cake and an Italian-style cheesecake with ricotta and I believe lemon zest, with coffee and espresso of course. Both the desserts were delectable, and despite being full, those plates were wiped clean. If you're going to order the chocolate cake, I do recommend sharing as it is rich in the best possible way. Our server was attentive without being overbearing and provided thoughtful answers to any questions we had on the menu. The progression of the courses was also perfectly paced despite having a full dining room. Overall, it was an excellent dining experience, and I would highly recommend checking out this new, unassuming Italian restaurant on 8th and Park. Buon appetito!
