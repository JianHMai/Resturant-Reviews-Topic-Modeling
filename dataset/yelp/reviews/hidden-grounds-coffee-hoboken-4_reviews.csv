2021-10-18,4,Solid spot! I ordered a New Orleans iced coffee, it tasted good. Ambiance is hip and very Insta-worthy. I took mine to go but some people were sitting - seems like a good meeting place. Comparable to the other locally owned coffee shops in the area.
2021-07-12,5,I loved my first visit to a hidden grounds! I ordered a lavender honey latte with skim milk and it was perfectly sweet and smooth. I also ordered a turkey sandwich and added cucumbers. The bread was crunchy and soft and perfect, and the chili flakes added good taste! Kalyn was such a pleasant and nice counter person. 10/10
2021-05-28,5,Hidden grounds has quickly become my boyfriend and I's favorite coffee spot in Hoboken. The atmosphere is positive and welcoming and they are very dog friendly, which is a must since we always pick up coffee on our morning walk. They have treats behind the counter and my dog will drag me all the way there. Every coffee we have tried (mainly cold brews and espressos) have been fantastic. 10/10 would recommend!
2021-04-05,5,Just like the other two locations the drinks are delicious and add something special to the regular coffee shop items. I love all the different times that are available, especially the rose chai. I wish this place had indoor seating but it is takeout and delivery only right now. Quality is fantastic and the energy is so positive and welcoming. I especially love how they are as much a part of the community as they are a business in the town.
2021-02-27,4,I hate to do this because, but this is the second time this happens to me. Is there an animal in the shop? I keep getting hair in my sandwiches the resemble a dogs hairs. I gave you a 4 star because you have potential & I don't want to mess up your ratings; Just fix this issue!
2020-11-14,4,Little cute cafe.Pretty latte art.Coffee is tasty.Service and barista are great. Limited capacity, need to wait in line a bit outside.
2020-10-03,5,Love this coffee shop! The iced taro latte is amazing - I'll definitely be getting that again. Iced rose chai tea latte is also awesome. Iced espresso and morning glory muffin are great, too. Friendly service and they have a bathroom. Next time: I want to try the cold brew.
2020-08-16,5,I love this place so much. Moved to Hoboken earlier this year but have been going to this place much longer. There are many coffee shops I pass on my walk here that I COULD go to, but it's always worth it to walk a little more and go to Hidden Grounds. My partner and I joke that I had plans to try everything on the menu, but now I order the lavender cold brew every single time! The golden milk latte, chai and dirty chair, and iced coffees and lattes are all fantastic but I keep getting the lavender cold brew haha. It's so good! Also have tried a few different avocado toasts, and I love the one with feta. The interior is beautiful as well. It's a great addition to the community.
2020-07-07,5,Excellent coffee. Small cafe vibe. Good prices. My favorite go-to coffee spot in Hoboken, hands down.
2020-05-02,1,I have been here 4 times and 3 of the 4 times they don't have any coffee. It seems like this place is more concerned with lighting for Instagram pics and selling t shirts then having a pot of coffee.
2020-04-23,5,This place definitely roasts some of the best quality coffee in Hoboken. It's a small, beautifully decorated space tucked away on a side street just a couple blocks from Washington st. There isn't much space to sit inside but they put seating outside when it's nice. Perfect for stopping by to pick up a cup to go while walking through town. I've only ever ordered their espresso which is great and I think I've only ever gotten a not perfect shot from there once. Any latte art I've seen from them is good as well so the baristas definitely have some skill. I really want to try the rose chai which sounds delicious! I also purchased an incredible bag of a natural Ethiopian roast. I asked for it ground for espresso to make at home but after I got home and made a shot I realized they had given me the wrong grind size. I messaged them on Instagram and got a response within 2 minutes! They apologized and asked for my address to ship me a new bag straight from the roaster! That's excellent customer service! The beans were on the expensive side but I cannot stress how absolutely worth it they are for the quality and supporting a local business!
2020-03-14,5,I had a very delicious and authentic seeming chai. They are even able to make it with alternative fairies which is great for me. The cafe area is very small only maybe three tables. The music they play is great if you enjoy bands like Joy division. I also got a bagel with lox was great for the price. I would definitely return
2019-12-08,5,A group of us stopped in late in the day. We ordered some drinks both hot and cold and they were all great. The pastries were a bit stale BUT the redeeming quality was the store admitted the coffee cake wouldn't be up to snuff (again, late in the day) and offered my friend not only a substitution for any item but a refund for the pasty as well. Customer service and quality control will keep me coming back.
2019-12-02,5,I've been coming here for some time as I head off to work on mornings and besides the coffee being delicious and great quality, the greetings that I get along with the service with a smile always starts my day off just the right way. Also, I kinda like that it's HIDDEN, like my own little secret. Haha.
2019-11-26,5,I absolutely adore this spot- has great gluten free options and is dog-friendly which I love (get my fill here since I don't have one of my own!)They use real coffee and roast their own so it's  legit. Maybe it's a little pricier, but I am so happy to support a local business rather than a huge corporate chain like Starbucks. P.s. get the rose chai, it's outta this world!!!
2019-11-23,1,While the vibe of the cafe is peppy, the prices are unfortunately misleading. The displayed price is quite different in comparison to what they charge you. We were charged $9 for the Bombay sandwich where in the displayed price was $8. After explaining it to the server regarding the mistake in the pricing, we were still given only half the refund (it wasn't the server's fault as he checked in with his boss). The coffee cake which we had order was of subpar quality as it was very dry. The only half-hearted saving grace was the coffee. Terrible place and a waste of money. Never going there again.
2019-11-16,3,Cups leak at the seam. Delicious coffee but not worth the constant dripping on your hand or clothing. I told them months ago the cups leak but nothing has changed.
2019-10-20,4,Really cute coffee shop tucked away from Washington, but very convenient for the residents. A small shop with very nice aesthetic. The specialty lattes and chais are good but on the pricier side, so I don't go too frequently.
2019-10-01,2,Did I seriously just pay $5 for an 8oz cold brew?? Then have a touch POS screen flipped over on me and then tip another dollar to be given a cup of ice with a blank stare??? Self service is on the wall. Half and half empty. Reusable spoons..... Here's the absolute punchline for me.... The coffee tastes like s***!! Total loss.... Looks like I'll continue to support Starbucks. I already feel my stomach turning.
2019-09-15,4,Love coming here - the staff is always very nice and helpful, seasonal drinks are cool and interesting, and the environment is great! Small suggestion is to offer more durable utensils. The plastic wear wouldn't cut through the bread so I had to take it home :/
2019-09-08,4,They were out of cold brew when we got there. :( We tried the rose chai cold drink, which was tasty and refreshing. Looking forward to trying some more items  here.
2019-09-01,4,Great chutney sandwich! Rose milk latte with oat milk is good but slightly too sweet and not enough caffeine. Good cozy vibe!
2019-08-21,2,Incredible coffeeDeplorable customer service - The sweet, older gentleman at the register was fumbling w/ his wallet to get his card back in, we all patiently waited. Rather than saying to the next person (me) "what can I get started for you..." (or even say anything at all to me), the barista decides to chat w/ her friend/acquaintance behind me. Then proceeded to start that person's coffee w/ out a word. So I got wait even longer after I ordered while she finished that one first.No apology No acknowledgement VERY not cool early in the morning before caffeine
2019-05-27,4,Cute coffee spot off Washington.  No heavy java vibe, refreshing, light and clean.  Soft grays, fresh pillows & yummy samples of the baked goods on the counter.And the staff wasn't counting just how many samples we scarfed.  We ordered a matcha , an iced latte & a hot cup of coffee.  All delicious, no bitter taste to my iced latte, crafted with the perfect amount of milk, not too heavy.Suggestions ...Offer stevia & ditch the SplendiaFind a better paper straw, mine gave out earlyI'll be back for sure!
2019-04-07,1,I like Hidden Grounds a lot and have been there numerous times. This past time, I ordered a large latte. The guy asked me twice about the syrup I wanted and I told him. Glad he was confirming but he was not listening to me when he took my order. To my surprise a small latte comes up. I say it was supposed to be a large and the guy that rang me up had the nerve to say it is because I did not say I wanted a large. The barista tells me the only difference between a small and large is more milk. Pretty sure you should not advertise that. I was so annoyed I just kept what they made for me and left. Hidden grounds, a piece of free advice, the customer is always right. Don't ever argue with the customer and listen to them when you take their order!! DISAPPOINTING!
2019-03-02,4,Lovely little coffee shop close to uptown. I ordered a Turmeric latte and they created a lovely little panda art on top. Wish there was more seating so I could spend some time reading or working but otherwise - nice, bright, clean, modern and friendly!
2019-02-23,4,Finally came around to trying this small coffee shop I've always passed when leaving DD's..First time ordered an americano, I thought it was super strong and bitter which is usual for a traditional americano but compared to my usual Starbucks americano, I liked Starbucks brew better. Second time ordered peppermint mocha and it came with a cute latte art. Peppermint mocha was good, not too sweet which is my jam. Prices reflect Starbucks prices even for their baked sweets. On my visit I also tried out the Nutella cookie, which is a sandwiched cookie made of oats it seemed and tasted with Nutella in the middle, not bad pretty tasty but I wouldn't order again. For a small peppermint mocha and the Nutella cookie it came out to $10 a bit pricey for a small latte, could've gotten a bigger latte with the treat for the same price at a Starbucks.It's a cute little shop, the people working were friendly too.
2019-02-22,3,Loaction is not great. If we hadn't walked by we would have never found it.Ordered a latte and a caramel latte with almond milk. It was pricey. The coffee is roasted by the company which is nice. However the flavor was just not there. It was mild. Cute design on latte. Mine was sloppy lol. Choc o Pain has the best latte in Hoboken so far in our opinion. And price is about the same maybe cheaper. We will not be returning to hidden grounds. Staff wasn't very friendly either, unfortunately and it was our first time ever visiting and they didn't recommend anything either. We do like the personalized sleeves and cups with their label on it. It's artsy.
2019-02-03,5,Oh f*ck yeah! Let their oat milk lattes rock your world. Let their almond croissants send shivers up your spine. So glad I found this hidden gem. Usually non-chain coffee places are wack but this is by far the best coffee in Hoboken. The BEST BABY LETS GET OAK MILK WASTED
2019-01-08,5,I've been a huge fan of Hidden Grounds. Actually discovered it while doing trainings for work in New Brunswick. When I saw it was coming to Hoboken I was extra excited. My go to is an Almond Milk cappuccino however I'm interested in their tea lattes. I did have a wasabi matcha tea latte one day which was surprisingly tasty and comforting. I do of course love the latte art design.. *swoon* it makes the start of my day wonderful.. The shop is bright .. not much seating though so that's my only gripe. Excellent coffee though ..
2019-01-06,4,Not sure about lunch but can get breakfast sandwiches here.  I got a bec on an everything bagel.  Only had two choices wheat and everything.  Nice if could do plain and sesame.   Sandwhich came on real plate but coffee was in paper though eating here.  I got the Nutella mocha.  Did not get any hazelnut flavor.  Coffee did come with the now mandatory design which is pretty but adds no taste.  Has small outside area so can bring dog.
2018-12-10,5,I finally made it to this fabulous cafe I've been wanting to check out since they opened in the summer. Welcome to the neighborhood!! I met my sister-in-law for coffee on a midday Monday and the cafe beautifully resonated with light. I loved the decor, the wall and high ceiling details and tile reminded me of a perfect marriage between Parisian and Moroccan design, and a bit of the Netherlands, too, with the big windows allowing in waves of sunlight. It was cozy and warm inside and the barista was equally warm and inviting. They have an extensive tea and coffee menu as well as an extensive bagel and sandwich menu.  I ordered the honey latte and it was absolutely delicious. The coffee was strong and rich, full bodied, and smooth without any acidity or bitterness, and the honey and cinnamon and whole milk made for one absolutely delicious and heart warming drink. The grilled cheese sandwich was one of the best I have ever had. One of my earliest memories as a young child was making grilled cheese sandwiches. This one was equally buttery and delicious however balanced in richness with fresh sautéed red onion and greens and tomatoes. I am daydreaming about it later. And it was served with really crunchy and tasty potato chips. What a perfect meal in a perfect setting. And a peaceful place to catch up with family and friends. We sat at the only table. I wish there were another table (mostly since I felt bad to be at the only table for a while) and yet I must say, the single table and side chairs created a communal feeling, as if you were hanging out in your friend's living room. Thank you for this wonderful food and hospitality. Look forward to returning!!
2018-11-30,5,First time here! I was slightly disappointed when they told me they didn't have a dark roast so I took their medium roast. It was rich and delicious! Get their nutella gluten free cookie...even if you're not gluten free or a big nutella fan. Its fantastic!!
2018-11-11,5,Been a fan since the New Bruns loc, these guys are so on point with how to run a customer driven coffee shop. Great staff and great ambiance. Excited to come back on the weekends, I recommend the savory egg and cheese. The staff alone is worth coming back to.
2018-10-26,4,Had a cortado to drink which was quite good and definitely perked me up. The bacon egg and cheese  sandwich was super greasy (even on the outside of the bagel) so I wouldn't order it again.The place is minimal with no tables indoors, but you can sit in the windowsill benches. There is a large standing menu with "recommended" items, with a full menu at the counter. I would recommend just putting the whole menu on the wall or above the cash register. Also, a nice touch would be if the menu design matched the artwork on the coffee cups. Plain black and white on a laminated sheet somehow doesn't match the rest of the decor.I'm excited to try the rose latte next time. I'll definitely go back for drinks but would probably skip the food unless they offer something unique.
2018-10-11,2,Came in for a bagel sandwich the price on the menu says $5.99 I was charged $1 more - when I asked why they said they need to update their menus yet they made me pay the higher price which really doesn't sit well with me. You can't have one price on your menu and then charge customers another after they've ordered - seems like Peyton switch. Two stars instead of one because the sandwich is really good but I don't think it's worth $7.41 that I paid.  Likely will not go back.
2018-09-30,3,Hidden grounds has pretty good coffee, but this place doesn't feel like it has any soul. It's just a modern, plain coffee shop with a self-serve coffee urn for drip coffee. Very plain inside, and it reminds me of countless other short-lived Manhattan coffee shops.I wish the owners would use the decore to tell more of a story with the place. The employees are generally friendly and service is good.
2018-09-15,5,A great spot in the middle of hoboken to alleviate all the folks who live midtown in Mile Square who want to grab something before they take off out of town or need something quick. I like how simple and clean it is, very cool vibe when you walk in and a friendly staff. They did a great job on my cortado. Need to try the latte!
2018-09-02,3,I want to absolutely love this place.  If the review was for the ambience/decor:  5 stars (bonus stars for the outdoor seating and the umbrellas ).  If the review was for the coffee:  5 stars (on both mine and my husbands vote after at least 2 visits).  Sadly, the staff, and more importantly the service, is the reason why I unfortunately cannot give that high of an overall score.I want to be clear about my expectations of the staff/service.  Things I don't expect them to know: my name, where I live in Hoboken, how often I come, how I like my coffee, what  type of coffee or beverage I get at what time of day, what method of payment I want to use, or really anything about me or what I'm going to or usually order (despite this being a small, local, neighborhood business).What I do expect:  1) when I ask a question, they're knowledgeable enough about the offerings to provide an answer (e.g. do you make a larger size coffee than this?  What flavors of syrup do you have?) 2) when an answer is provided to a question, it's clear (just a yes or no to the first question will do), and 3) when I place my coffee order, the person taking it is listening/paying attention.  None of those 3 things happened on two back to back visits this weekend, which is frustrating and unnecessary.   It's important to understand that during both visits, we were the only ones in the shop ordering/inside, it wasn't busy at all, and out of the 3 people working behind the counter, none of them paid attention-not even the person who was taking our order.  They forgot it as soon as I said it, and when asked again, I provided the same order, and it was wrong both times.  Again, I think this place has unlimited potential, but the staff and service here, just like any business, can make or break the experience.-----Side note: I'm sure it's part of the look, and perhaps it's consistent with how the location in jersey city is, but they should post the menu (even if it's on the upper left hand wall where there's ample space).
2018-08-25,4,Nice coffee and yummy huge donut. The reason I'm giving it 4 starts is because of the limited seating. I came here on Saturday and there wasn't any outdoor tables. I'm confused because the pictures on Yelp showed some tables I mean I'd love to stay more and enjoy my coffee but whatever! The coffee shop is small and cozy and the coffee is good.
2018-08-04,3,I really really want to love this place. If I wrote this review after the first time I went, I would have given Hidden Grounds more than five stars if I could. You can bring your dog in and they'll gladly dole out milk bones. They're super helpful and will walk you through the menu without hesitation. The iced rose chai was unlike anything I've ever had in Hoboken. For all of you trendy folk, the pink tinge will definitely turn some heads. More importantly, I finally found a place that served a chai latte that had some kick!Upon my second and third return, however, my chai latte has been unrecognizable. Watered down almond milk with a faint hint of chai is the best description. I think it can be attributed to an inconsistency amongst baristas. I'll definitely give this place another shot in a few weeks once it's fully established. Hopefully I'll have the same experience I did the first time.
2018-08-01,5,I was SO excited to hear that this was opening on my street! Their coffee is the best I've ever had and I can't begin to describe how cute it is! It is a bit pricey, but definitely worth it, this will become my new go to spot.
2018-07-30,4,Love having this place in the neighborhood! Almond milk latte and egg and cheese were good! Bright and clean and the people are very nice and helpful.
2018-07-29,5,One of the best coffee shops I've ever been to. My go to is always cold brew, iced rose chai and Bombay sandwich. It is out of this world and everyone has to try it. I am glad this place is expanding.
2018-07-29,1,I wanted to give the new coffee shop in town a shot as I am a huge coffee enthusiast. I ordered the cold brew which was weak and flavorless. save yourself some money and go to Dunkin up a block. Or go to bluestone lane for the best cold brew in town. I am disappointed this place was not as good as I had hoped.
2018-07-28,5,We stopped in before this place was officially open and not only was the owner beyond gracious, but the cappuccino he made was one of the best I've ever had. I can't wait to come back to this adorable spot for excellent coffee! This is what Hoboken needs!!
2018-07-28,5,Great new addition to the neighborhood! Love the place and people. It will become my go-to spot
2018-07-27,5,This is an awesome addition for Hidden Grounds! The new store brings in a fresh and cool aesthetic that is different from their other stores. The outdoor seating is perfect since its at a corner street. Of course, if you've been a fan of their coffee and drinks, this store definitely delivers the same quality and amazing drinks!   Their chai is the best !!
2018-07-27,3,So let me start by saying the employees are extremely helpful and I hope this place does well. I ordered a small iced coffee for my daughter and a medium breakfast blend for myself.  But the only roast they have is a dark roast.   So I changed and got a pour-over.  Both were tasty but overall quite expensive.  Plus they need to offer other drip options. And the pour over was small and took forever to be made. I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon.  Many better options in Hoboken.
