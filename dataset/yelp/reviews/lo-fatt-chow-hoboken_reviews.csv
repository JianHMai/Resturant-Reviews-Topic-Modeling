2021-10-31,1,If only I could give ZERO stars. The exact same experience happened to me as Michelle below with the nasty rude owner refusing to resolve even the smallest of complaints. I was a longtime loyal customer and always loved the food, however this one time I got the beef & broccoli it smelled and tasted absolutely RANCID. To be fair it's not out of the blue for Chinese food to be off sometimes, so I just called and asked to see if they would refund / replace. They refused to help me at all and got OFFENDED that I didn't want to potentially get ill/ sick from meat that smelled spoiled. The owner literally told me "no no you don't get a replacement or refund because this just means you don't like my cooking!!!" And then hung up on me. That in of itself speaks volume to how this business is being run, and concerns me that there likely are significant health code violations being broken, if that's how defensive the owner gets over one small complaint and request. Stay away at all costs!!!
2021-09-29,1,The owner is extremely rude, nasty, and unprofessional. She YELLED at me on the phone last year when I had a minor complaint about the order and told me I didn't have to order from them anymore. I gave them another try this year against my better judgment, and I've been told by a worker that that the owner won't serve me food. I'm truly appalled. The reviews that mention the horrible customer service are all true. Give your money to other establishments who are kind and appreciate their customers. I wish I could give this place zero stars.
2021-08-16,1,I only visited your restaurant one time. I updated my review from 3 to one stars after reading your reply on 8/16/21. I will now update it again, now. You have a very bad attitude for a business owner. I have every right to ask any question I want you don't have to answer the question. I will state again you have a very bad attitude for a business owner. You need to read the American Constitution. I have every right to ask "why a business owner is selling me food and not wearing a mask".  Your attitude is terrible and I certainly will not be coming back to your restaurant. I change from 3 stars to 1 stars for the bad attitude. Masks and vaccination stop the spread of Covid. People like you are why we are still fighting this Virus. Bad, Bad and more bad.
2021-07-09,2,We got Lo Fatt Chow a few months back via deliver and as far as American Chinese food goes, I felt it was very bland. There were six of us, so we got quite the assortment of dishes and it just boring, though at least it wasn't super soggy! As this is the "top rated" Chinese restaurant in Hoboken, I guess I won't be having Chinese food in Hoboken anytime soon.
2021-06-04,5,Have been going here since they Opened. The food is much less greasy and healthier in my opinion. Excellent quality and will not disappoint.
2021-05-05,5,Great food! Great service! The lo mein and seasame chicken is top notch. The dumplings as well were delicious, along with the scallion pancakes. Favorite take out spot ever!!!!
2021-04-11,4,Best Chinese food in Hoboken. The only thing that could be better is the fried rice, but I usually take my leftover white rice and make it into fried rice the next day. IYKYK. They use bok choy as a vegetable in their dishes.. that alone is worth the order. (Usually Chinese food places fill the orders with carrots and celery.)I've had a lot of their menu but these are my favorites: scallion pancakes, crispy wings, orange peel chicken, moo goo guy pan, chow feng. Orange peel chicken is so delicious and they use real chicken. Moo goo guy pan is a lighter sauce but comes with chicken, water chestnuts and veggies. Chow feng are delicious wide noodles. I love Lo Fatt Chow so much, I've gotten my whole family hooked!
2021-04-04,5,Great spot!!!!!Ordered takeout at 550 and it was here at 615. The food was so hot! The portions were perfect. The combo is a great choice, only 10 bucks for entree, rice, egg roll. We got egg fried rice, lo mein, and sweet and sour chicken. You can definelty notice a taste of it being a little healthier, with the sodium. But it still taste like great Chinese food. Will order again!! Nice delivery guy too!!
2021-01-01,5,Best Chinese spot in town! Reasonably priced, good food and super fast delivery. Food always comes fresh and hot.
2021-01-01,4,Not much oil remains at the bottom of take out containers with this establishment. Healthy alternative just how I cook at home. The Singapore noodles need more curry flavor; hence the 4 stars.
2021-01-01,4,I wouldn't recommend this place for delivery, but I'm updating my review because this is actually our favorite Chinese place in Hoboken. The food is consistently very good and they serve great portions. We usually order the "combo for 1" (sometimes 2 of them) along with sides like dumplings, soup, and egg roll and it's all always amazing.  It feeds 2 people for lunch and honestly sometimes dinner as well.Just don't order delivery, as we did twice and both times took over 2 hours.
2020-12-21,5,I love this place. I have been ordering takeout from them for the last 5 years and the food has been consistently good, and I think they are really nice people too!
2020-12-11,5,This has been my COVID comfort food for months now and I don't know what I would do without it! The steamed pork dumplings, spicy Szechuan wontons, sesame noodles, crab rangoons, scallion   pancake, low mein, chicken and broccoli are all some of my favorites! Give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed by the food or the price!
2020-12-06,5,Continuously great Chinese food for local pick-up! Wonton soup, wonton dumplings, pan fried dumplings and the sweet and sour chicken are always excellent.
2020-11-13,5,Always fresh, fast, and tasty! Beats any other traditional Chinese-American take out I've had.
2020-11-11,1,I am surprised this place has amazing reviews. Their food is generally very salty and sweet. Their general tso chicken is not crispy, not fried to order, extremely sweet and salty. And texture of the chicken is very hard and dense. And lo mein is very very salty. I feel like I had to drink 5 bottles of water to feel my tongue again. Very very salty. I can't emphasize that enough. They do advertise themselves as healthier chinese food option but hmm..I doubt it. I mean I know this place is not for authentic chinese food but even for chinese American food, it's very disappointing.
2020-10-30,1,if i could give this place 0 stars i would.  i live across the street and ordered food at 6:30pm, by 7:30 i called to find out where my food was and was greeted by the rudest employee who said they were waiting for the driver to get back.  when i said i live across, she, again in the rudest tone, said i was told the street delivery would be over an hour, which i was not.  if i was told that i would have done pick up. i ended up canceling my order.  with all the options in town, i will never give this place another cent of my money.  your better offer ordering from Asia Sushi on 9th and Washington, they're more then 10 blocks away from my house and showed up in 20 minutes with better prices and quality food.
2020-10-26,3,Okay I guess it's a play on Low-fat chow. It's healthy Chinese food but the unhealthy part is what makes Chinese take out good. General Tso chicken has no sauce it's really just spicy McNugget type vibes Fried rice is barely fried, more tossed in couple vegetables Price is decent. Meh.
2020-10-25,5,Ordered take out from here from their website. Great food.  prepared quickly and lady behind counter was very nice
2020-10-05,4,A simple yet intense craving for wonton soup (you know you've felt that before) even though we kinda already ate a big late lunch and didn't plan on doing much (if anything) for dinner led us to find LFC. After looking at the menu online, our "we already ate-ish" state of mind flew out the window while we ordered a massive soup and....steamed dumplings, garlic chicken stir fry, a scallion pancake, and fried rice.Got home. Tore into it. Ate a bunch. Still felt good about it. While a meal here isn't the same as getting a salad with dressing on the side, it's not your typical, greasier, over-sauced takeout. Everything we ate? Really tasty. And yes, the wonton soup absolutely hit the spot. Ever had fried rice that wasn't that typical brown color? Me neither, until now. Plus, pineapple chunks. Win-win. The stir fry was as garlic heavy as I had hoped, without being over salted and over sauced.We had leftovers (thankfully) and they were all eaten the next day. If I had to criticize something, I thought the steamed dumplings were a little doughy, but that wasn't a huge deal. Overall, I look forward to exploring more of their menu. Chinese food that won't make you feel the bloat that still tastes good? It's about time.
2020-09-12,3,I live right around the corner and was craving Chinese food and after reading the reviews I thought this place would hit the spot. We got pineapple/pork fried rice, wonton soup, and a scallion pancake. The fried rice was standard but the wonton soup was really good and for the price it was 100% worth it. I would come back to get the soup alone. The scallion pancake was inedible though. Incredibly chewy and not crisp at all. We just ended up throwing it away.
2020-08-29,1,The customer service here was absolutely horrible. The girl over the phone was extremely rude when ordering and once we received the order, it was incorrect. When we called back they basically told us we were in the wrong, although we repeated the order multiple times. We were put on hold multiple times and the girl was spacey as hell...so not surprised the order was wrong. Do not order from here. Got chipotle instead.
2020-08-11,5,Great lunch specials!  Had the boneless spare ribs and they are  highly recommended.  Also had the Won Ton soup which was delicious.
2020-07-28,4,Good menu-  Great food - healthy portions and tasted just as good as left overs as the day it was we ordered.
2020-06-25,5,Really good Chinese food if that's what you're craving. I was impressed for the price, everything was great :)
2020-06-02,1,Was oh so disappointed with the food from Lo-Fatt-Chow. Got take out and the food was so bland, that i tried to add more flavor with any and every sauce in my pantry. The fried rice was simply white rice with some peas and pieces of pork and the chicken and broccoli was tasteless. One star for friendly and quick service, but i will definitely not be returning.
2020-05-29,2,Placed a large delivery order. Service was prompt and the delivery person was masked. Dish by dish:-Egg roll smallish and could use more filling 3/5-Veggie dumplings were doughy and bland 2/5-Scallion pancake was VERY greasy and needed more scallion 1/5-General Tzo's chicken was very sweet and could use more heat 3/5-Beef and broccoli gets 4/5- Mei Feng veggie dry, no sauce, no flavor 0/5-Chow Feng veggie one of the tastier dishes 3.5/5-Baby Bok Choy Tofu: bland, steamed veggies with tasteless tofu. downright terrible 0/5- String beans with tofu: at least it had a brown sauce. However still pretty bland 2.5/5- veggie fried rice just tasted like stale oil 0/5Overall the Yelp **** rating is way over stated. A 2/5 rating is generous. Likely would not order from here again.
2020-02-16,5,Excellent food always very fresh and great value. The owner is wonderful very pleasant. I highly recommend you try for yourself.
2020-02-08,4,Food was tasty and seemed healthy. It wasn't too salty or oily. They have an interesting menu with all the usual classics as well as house specialities. Delivery arrived promptly and overall we were pleased!
2020-01-26,5,Great take-out food near the newest area of Hoboken. Prawn with Lobster Sauce was incredible with the freshest shrimp!  Curry Apple Chicken was such a wonderful surprise... the taste of India combined with Chinese.  Lo Mein was fresh and not greasy.  Prices are incredibly reasonable.  This will become your favorite Chinese take out... so definitely give it a chance.  (I hope the owners will keep up this freshness and variety because they are going to make it big.  Keep up this 5 Star quality.... please.  )
2020-01-05,2,Sorry, the food was super salty.  Both my and my wife's dishes.  Ordered delivery on Sunday evening. She's easy and I tend to be more particular.  I rarely encounter this much salt  - we order from all kinds of restaurants in Hoboken. I welcome the owner's comments on this...
2020-01-05,1," If you are in a rush you'd better order quickly, don't blame us if you don't get your food on time. " The first sentence the owner said to us after we enter the restaurant. Best way to kick your costumers out :) Btw I thought the owner only mean to Asians, cause she seems polite to the "white" costumer later on, but turns out she is just mean and rude in general.
2020-01-03,5,Always fresh, tasty and hot. Always polite and friendly. A true treasure of hoboken!  Delish!
2020-01-01,1,They have decent Chinese food but they have no reliability with delivery. Consistently they take about 1-2hrs for delivery (we live a few blocks from them). Won't be ordering again as the lady on the phone (I think she is the owner) is super rude.  We ordered at 520, called at 7 to ask for a status and was told "if we can't wait for longer than an hour, to not bothering ordering again". I guess we didn't order early enough for my two year old, who eats at 7. Good luck with that attitude!
2019-12-30,1,Food is just ok, there are better take out places in Hoboken plus the woman on the phone has such a nasty attitude. The food is just not worth the aggravation.
2019-12-18,5,Always quick. Always hot and fresh. Order comes correctly every time. Food definitely tastes healthier than other Asain restaurants I've been to with minimal to no oils.
2019-12-15,1,Don't bother ordering from this place. We ordered and they never even delivered it to us. When we called and asked them where the order was they said "in the kitchen" and that it would be another hour (we had already been waiting for an hour). We asked them to refund- and we had to fight to get it. They told us they would refund us but the charge showed up on our credit card statement. We've eaten there before and the food is just okay. Most importantly who wants to give a restaurant your money and be treated poorly? If you look through the Yelp reviews you'll see the common review is that this place has horrible customer service. Hopefully they'll take these reviews seriously and make an effort to change the way they treat customers and improve on their delivery service.
2019-12-09,5,Fresh, well made and very delicious! Fantastic service and very friendly! Highly recommended!
2019-11-22,4,I recently wrote a rather blistering, perhaps biased, review of Hoboken as a city, but one undeniably positive aspect of the Hoboken experience is that it has a multitude of restaurants; some great, some good, some not-so-good. It's not a big city, but if you want...say...Italian--- there are easily a half-dozen or more Italian restaurants to choose from. Latino cuisine? Plenty of restaurants to choose from. Middle-Eastern? Yes; if not in Hoboken itself, then in the immediate vicinity. "Fast-food" deli style? It's there. "Fast food" Korean? It's there. Japanese? Yes. Peruvian? Colombian? Cuban? Of course.Where I work in Hoboken, we've ordered so much take-out food over the past few years that we're given to calling ourselves "the Lunchbox Mafia." (Actually, someone from another department rather snidely referred to a co-worker as "the Godfather of Lunch," (Chuck) and it seemed a logical progression from there to "Lunchbox Mafia." Anyway...) One type of cuisine we've had a problem with would be Chinese. Not that Hoboken is lacking Chinese restaurants. We tried several different Chinese restaurants in the area, but there was no uniformity in terms of our reactions to them. There's one restaurant that's cheap, and they deliver fast. I loathe it, but Luca Brasi (Lance) likes it. Another restaurant was pretty good, but Tessio (Dave) found a cockroach in his order, and that was the end of that one.Then someone recommended Lo Fatt Chow, and we've all pretty much agreed that for Chinese, this is going to be our "go-to" place for ordering take-out (although Luca Brasi will still continue ordering from the cheap place; there's no accounting for taste, but who is gonna argue with Luca Brasi?). I usually order steamed vegetables with chicken, brown rice, and an egg roll. I always have to be very careful in ordering Chinese food, because the MSG (or, if there's no MSG per se, then the massive amount of just plain salt, particularly in the soups; salt is a migraine trigger for me) will cause a migraine quicker than Clemenza (Alex) can gulp down an order of steamed dumplings, and chicken wings. But I've never really been able to connect anything I've eaten at Lo Fatt Chow with migraines. Kay Corleone (Frances) orders from the dinner menu and gets the hot garlic chicken, which she loves. Frankie Five Angels (Dwight) gets the chicken and broccoli, and he's a fan.I've tried other dishes myself and been well satisfied; I've liked the Happy Family, the Pad Thai Noodles, the Mei-Feng. I stay away from the soups because the salt content inherent in Chinese (and Japanese) soups always makes me nervous, but other than that, eating at Lo Fatt Chow has been an enjoyable, satisfying, and safe experience.The Godfather of Lunch approves.The only downside, I guess, is the fact that they won't deliver before 5pm.When it comes to ordering Chinese food in Hoboken, Lo Fatt Chow is a winner.
2019-09-10,1,Not good. How it's ranked #1 for Chinese food in Hoboken is beyond me. General Tso's Chicken was rubbery and mundane.  Lo mein was bland.  Egg drop soup was fine.  The egg roll was the only saving grace, but the meal as a whole was regrettable.
2019-08-07,1,I am completely unimpressed with the customer service even moreso now that I have read your reply and comments on other peoples reviews yoo. I was told the price of my order and it did not match the prices online. The person that I spoke with yelled at me instead of correcting it. She then told me to just order online and hung up on me. Nothing makes it okay to treat a customer like that, I ordered somewhere else! Completely disappointed about this experience at Lo Fatt Chow. Will not be ordering from here again any time soon.Edit post reply- I don't expect you to change your price for me, but I should be able to confirm the breakdown of my order in terms of pricing without being insulted. I don't expect to be yelled that when I'm ordering my dinner either or hung up on by any business.
2019-08-04,5,Really good food at a good price. Don't sleep on the wraps. Only bummer is that they don't deliver to the Heights.
2019-07-21,4,My go to place for fast food Chinese. Food is good and flavorful. Good place if your just ordering in and chilling with Netflix..
2019-07-13,5,Food is always fresh, not oily and always tastes great. This is our go to Chinese takeout in Hoboken. Every time i go in the owner is present. She is very nice and sets a high standard. Give it a try!
2019-07-01,1,The business owner replied my previous review and blame on me that "as an asian" i don't know the different between egg roll or spring roll! Now get me even more not wanting to go back and give them a chance, because clearly i ordered Spring rolls and i don't know how i get an egg roll!The point is: no matter what the name is the roll is, it is RAW and UNCOOKED!
2019-06-26,5,This possible is the best Chinese takeout I've had. It is exactly what Chinese takeout is and should be.
2019-06-26,5,The food is good and the people are so friendly! I'm pescatarian and tried the General Tao Fried Tofu. It was actually really good and I even went back for it a second time in the same week. 5 stars!
2019-06-19,4,The food was amazing. Not greasy and every sauce has tofu option. We ordered the kung Pao tofu and it came LOADED with yummy tofu and peanuts. Had no grease so felt very light and healthy. Very unlike the other Chinese takeout we are used to.
2019-04-13,5,After tried so many Chinese restaurant in Hoboken and Newport, I think this one is the best for taste, even it charges more than average.
2019-03-27,5,Because of all the good reviews I decided to give this place a shot.  I loved the food and the staff was super friendly.  Highly recommend.
2019-02-21,5,Best place in Hoboken.  Quick and Good.  It's not your normal Chinese food!  Cool menu.
2018-12-28,5,I have to be in the mood for Chinese food and that is rarely but I've made 6 trips here in a month. I w had the basics, Gen Tso chicken, wings, rib tips, fried rice and Pad Thai... all have been great and taste extremely fresh.
2018-12-27,5,Was skeptical at first when my boyfriend proposed this place for a hungover Chinese take out night. My thought process was "if I'm gonna indulge in Chinese food, give it to me in all its grease, sodium and MSG glory". I eventually obliged and was pleasantly surprised. The food still tastes just as good without the added preservatives and oils and you can feel (sort of) guilt free afterwards. We took a page out of the "Eat This, Not That!" book and ordered the most forbidden food on the menu (egg rolls, sweet and sour chicken, lo mein, shrimp toast etc) and I swear I did not feel as gross as I usually do upon completing a Chinese food binge. To my understanding, it's purely take out/delivery. Food arrived hot in a timely manner. A bit pricier than your standard Washington St hole in the wall joint, but worth it in my opinion. Would definitely recommend!
2018-12-26,5,This place is awesome. Ordered Shrimp and Broccoli.. Very little sauce wasn't over drenched. Shrimp was soo fresh. Highly recommend this place. Best Chinese food in town.
2018-12-18,4,Good Chinese food! Iv heard a lot of good reviews and compliments from this place so I had to try. I got the scallion pancake- averageThe spicy Szechuan wontons - delicious General tso- goodEgg roll - deliciousWhite rice - dry Overall Very good though. A pain they don't deliver one town over but I would order again. If you are skeptical on Chinese, this place can surely make you a believer
2018-11-11,5,We've tried so many Chinese places in the Hoboken/union city/weehawken area and this place hits the spot! Ordered the chicken and broccoli and sesame chicken - tasty, not too oil and reasonably priced. The lady at the front was also very friendly. We ordered for pick up and the place looked clean inside upon picking up. Look no further and make this your spot.
2018-10-02,5,Great Chinese food! Id suggest trying the sesame chicken, pork fried rice and the sweet and sour chicken.  We ordered the chicken lo mien as well, but I will try the pork lo mien instead next time. The wonton soup is excellent as well, and the broth is less salty than typical Chinese food. We will be ordering from here again.
2018-09-25,5,Ordered delivery from here for the first time tonight and was SO impressed!! I had the chicken vegetable soup and it was packed with chicken and the good stuff! Great portions. Will definitely be my new go-to Chinese spot in Hoboken!
2018-08-10,3,So many people love this place and I was dying to try it. I ordered the beef and broccoli and picked up. Service was fast and the woman behind the counter was friendly. My rating of stars is solely based on my meal. I just feel like it lacked flavor. I'm a petite girl and I don't binge eat so I found it disappointing that I finished my meal and still felt hungry. Honestly, in this case I'm sorry. I just want "Full fat chow" at the end of the day.
2018-07-25,5,This place is phenomenal! I dont usually do Chinese takeout because of all the horrid stories I hear about what they use as meat, but this place is the real deal. No cat or dog meat here. I've ordered the sesame chicken and shrimp lo mein and it was delicious and fresh. The lady at the front who takes the orders is super nice and chatty and loves to give doggy treats to your dog. Best takeout place in Hoboken for sure.
2018-06-25,4,Our go-to Chinese spot in Hoboken. Their lunch specials and combos are great deals! The food is ready super fast when ordering take out online. The wonton soup is good and a good deal (and only 50 cents as an add-on to the lunch combo).
2018-05-16,5,This place rocks!  and it's healthy, which is really a hell of a feat!  The owner is awesome & she gives dogs treats if you come to pick up your order!  Delicious noodles & seafood soup!  We easily visit 2-3 times a month.  Great prices too!
2018-05-10,1,Food is amazing especially  the sweet chicken but I went in to get a fork for my food I didn't get from there and the lady said don't come back unless  your going to buy something
2018-04-12,5,Best chicken on a stick you can find in NJ. A tad pricey but the quality is worth it. Friendly staff. Hard to find parking. Food is very good.
2018-03-14,4,Officially our go to take out Chinese spot. It's super easy to order online, especially once you set up an account with them. The food is always ready in 20mins, and it's piping hot when we bring it home. Some of our favorites- the combo deal for one. Lots of different entrees to choose from (my fave is hunan chicken), and tons of options for the two sides you get to choose from. You pick from a variety of Rice's/ lo meins and then either a soup or spring/ egg roll. Usually ends up being $10 for a ton of food! I'm normally a fried rice fan, but the lo mein here is the winner. It's so tasty. The egg rolls and soups are also good. Crab Rangoon is another appetizer well done here. The few things I wouldn't order again are the scallion pancakes and chicken wings. Both were soggy. This is strictly takeout/ delivery. There are only a few stools to sit on inside.
2018-03-14,5,Management must have changed, because customer service has improved significantly!Great food, big portions, great service and reasonably priced :-) what else is there?Our first choice for Asian food in Hoboken!!!
2018-02-19,5,The chicken low main was excellent, not greasy at all. The beef & broccoli was a delightful dish too. The egg rolls and spring rolls were crispy and not greasy. Will be back for more !
2018-02-08,5,My favorite Chinese takeout/delivery in Hoboken. Fast, fresh, and doesn't make you feel gross after eating.Love the beef and broccoli and the chow fun. Soups are good too (hot and sour and egg drop with wontons). Really almost everything I've tried is delicious but those are part of my regular order.They do deliver to the JC Heights-- call to place your order instead of going online for Heights delivery. However, during peak times/bad weather, they might not deliver there.
2018-01-13,3,Food is great!But the older asian lady ( the host ) is mean and rude . . needs to be nicer lol
2017-11-30,4,A neighborhood take out place. They are super friendly and prices are good. They advertise no msg and you can tell that Chinese food without msg is a little lacking... still not too bad
2017-11-19,5,Best Chinese food in hoboken by far haven't ordered from another place since they opened.  The food is also much healthier than other options in town.
2017-07-03,2,I want to give this place 4/5 stars for the food. It is not your average chinese spot. It is delicious, creative, non-greasy chinese food. Unfortunately, the ladies who work here couldn't be more rude. Everytime I call its an absolute nightmare. And the worst part is, they just don't care. Realize that hiring employees who dont care reflects poorly on your restaurant--enough that someone who loves your food and has supported from the beginning will no longer patronize your establishment. Such a shame.
2017-05-25,2,I've moved to restrict my consumption of pork and beef, so recently I ordered the Sesame Chicken while my boyfriend ordered General Tso's which he gets everywhere.  Unfortunately, half his chicken tasted "fishy" which either means it was of questionable freshness or the frying oil for the fish is the same as for the chicken-- EXCEPT I also had a similarly fried chicken dish (aforementioned Sesame Chicken) and it was not fishy.  Needless to say- we won't be ordering from here again probably (even though I never had bad luck with the boneless spare ribs).
2017-05-16,1,I wouldn't have written this review if you weren't so unprofessional & disrespectful, so I hope you're happy low fat chow. Anyway, i ordered chicken pad Thai and the chicken was so disgusting -soft squishy greasy, it didn't even taste like real chicken. To get a visual, the texture reminded me of raw fish or possibly a fetus, that marinated in a bucket of dishwater. I ate about 1/3 of the dish because I was starving AF and then got sick about an hour later. I called them requesting my money back and their boss was patronizing and unprofessional. She told me that she's certified (for what, idk) and it couldn't have possibly been their food that made me sick because I got sick too fast, and that maybe I shouldn't eat Chinese food in general. Lmao.*I ordered your food last week and the kung pao chicken was actually really good. Nothing like this. She said she'll give me my money back as long as I didn't eat more than half and they'll come pick up my food and inspect it, but still she kept going on and on about how this isn't their fault. OH and that I'm never allowed to order from them again- makes total sense. No one came the rest of the night to pick up my peasant food or give me my money back. I'm only giving 1 star because 0 isn't an option.
2017-03-25,4,It's definitely the best Chinese takeout in town. Ingredients taste fresh, and the dishes are not greasy like many other spots. I found the staff to be fine. Honestly, it's just takeout, so I'm not expecting the white glove treatment. I'm taking off a star only because of delivery. I'm in the heights, but literally right on the border - closer than downtown hoboken - and they won't deliver here! We're seriously lacking in good Chinese food...expand your delivery radius please!
2017-02-28,5,Pleasantly surprised that the quality of the food in this small establishment remains consistently very good ever since it opened a few years ago. It is healthier Chinese food, good choices, delicious  and the staff is always very polite... I look forward to ordering from there and highly recommend this to anyone who loves Chinese food!
2017-02-28,2,Surprised by the reviews on yelp for this place. I found the meal to be below average.We ordered the sesame chicken and the sweet and sour chicken. First off the sesame chicken was very salty and didnt have a great texture. It was kind of chewy. The sweet and sour chicken was mostly dough rather than chicken. This was also a little dry and i have had better.Might try again if i am craving chinese but this place did not hit the spot.
2017-02-25,5,The only healthy, affordable, and still delicious Chinese food in Hoboken. Delivery is always timely. Our go-to Chinese in Hoboken that never disappoints.
2017-02-01,4,Best Chinese food option in Hoboken.Food is always fresh and never greasy. I feel the ingredients they use in their dishes are higher quality then the other local Chinese food establishment and you can taste the difference. The only con's I have about this place are they never include chopsticks for delivery, even when I specify to add them when ordering, and they do not  deliver at lunch time.
2017-01-26,1,This place is so rude and unaccommodating. I ordered chicken skewers online then called to asked if they could be plain (no sauce). After all, this place claims to be "healthy" so no sauce should be a standard option. They, however, said no: "how can I explain this to you? They are pre-made. There is no way to make them without sauce." Then I asked if they could make plain chicken. They said, "I told you, our food is pre-made. NO!" This lady was uninterested in helping me and acted like I was genuinely a burden on her time. Also, even after this long drawn out call, I asked if she could confirm my order was received (since I ordered online). She said, "God no. It will be faxed to us. That takes time."Bottom line, my food hasn't even been made yet and I am soooooo done with this place. Not ordering from here again.
2016-12-28,5,Best Chinese in Hoboken!  Chicken always is fresh and good amount for prices!!!  Owner is very nice and loves pets!!
2016-12-18,3,If I could, I would give Low-Fatt Chow 3.5 stars. My friends and I ordered for delivery. We went on the site and it said that it was too late to place an order. However, it said the place closed at 10 and it was only 9. It was only .1 miles away so it should have been plenty of time. So we called and they had no problem fulfilling our order. The service was outstanding after that- the lady was very competent even though it was a big order. The food was average. Definitely a safe Chinese place but it wasn't overly flavorful. It came in a container with a divider so rice was on one side and the protein on the other. Not how I would have like it but the others thought it was nice.
2016-11-22,5,I've been coming here for a few months and the owner, remembers my name most of the time (generally order the same items lol). The food is pretty good compared to the other Chinese places here. It's less greasy but still has a lot of favor and get a decent amt in your portion.
2016-09-20,5,This 5 star rating is for Hoboken people.   Among all the Chinese restaurants in Hoboken, this place is by far the best in terms of the food being clean and not too oily and tasting really good. (Especially when the head chef makes it.)I ordered delivery multiple times and the food came really fast and promptly.   The only other Chinese restaurant that is comparable is Precious, BUT Lo-Fatt-Chow is significantly better.  With the general Tso lunch combo I asked for chicken fried rice made with brown rice.  I was shocked at how clean the fried rice was made.  It wasn't drowned in oil.    So take a chance and order from this place!  Their lunch portions are great too.
2016-09-13,5,Delicious and healthy Chinese food that you can't find anywhere else! I hope that they consider expanding to other towns!
2016-09-08,5,Always happy with the food here and the ladies at the front desk- I usually order online and pick-up 15min later! Fast, easy and fresh! I love the vegetable fried rice and the boneless spare ribs! This is my go-to especially since it's nearby & the meal combinations are huge portions/great pricing!!
2016-09-01,5,Been living in Hoboken for a year now, and I FINALLY found my chinese food place. Lo Fatt is restaurant quality in a little takeout storefront. The staff are very knowledgeable about their ingredients and allergens (gluten, soy etc), which is great, and shows that they care about what they are serving. Excellent service, even better food. When will they be on seamless though?I noticed someone saying they are slow with delivery, I ordered last night and had my food in under 20 minutes.
2016-08-26,4,We wanted to try this place so we decided to go pick some up. My boyfriend loved the pineapple and pork rice! The food was good. My boyfriend is very picky with Chinese so he would give the general Taos chicken 3.5 stars but the pineapple pork rice 5 stars. The service when picking up was super friendly. The place looked clean inside which is def a plus.
2016-08-21,1,Over 2 hours for a delivery is insane. Never order from here. Called twice and restaurant was unhelpful and always saying "it is on the way". Too many options in Hoboken to deal with this type or service.
2016-08-07,3,Basic, but decent chinese food. I will say it didnt have the typical greasy taste to it that most chinese places serve, that just makes you feel full and ... Ugh afterwards. An order of lo mein, chicken x broccoli and 2 egg rolls was only about $16 bucks as well. Delivery also came very fast, I'd order again.
2016-08-05,5,Top notch, quality and unique food without all the grease. We found this place just walking through town one day and gave it a try. It is now our go to Chinese food locally. Delivery is quick, fresh and the service is always wonderful. Highly recommend!!
2016-07-21,1,This place is horrible! The food and service were both awful. After using my credit card here I have had tons of fraudulent transactions in town....Please BEWARE!!!!
2016-07-21,5,Just ordered delivery for the first time last night. The food was delicious, the service was fast, the prices were great and the staff was incredibly friendly. I did not realize that I had to specifically choose white or brown rice on their online ordering website, or else they would send you no rice. I'm used to white rice being the default. Our order came in about 30 minutes or less. When there was no rice I called and they nicely explained my mistake, but sent over someone to drop off rice. I definitely will be ordering from here again.
2016-07-18,5,Great tasting take out done right! Even though I customize my order around my diet they get it right every time.If you're in the mood for Chinese food look no further!
2016-05-20,5,My new favorite delivery. Impossibly fresh veggies, flavorful sauces, variety of styles, BIG portions. I always have enough left over for lunch or dinner the next day and because everything is so fresh, it's still better than many other places that deliver the night before. In short, I agree with everything Alyssa F. wrote.I'm surprised by the one slow service critique, because from order to delivery has never been more than a half hour to my door.
2016-05-09,4,Very good Chinese, you can't tell it is healthy, tastes same as other Chinese places. I was skeptical bc I thought it would be dry and flavorless, but it's not, it is good.
2016-04-28,5,Best chinese food in the area!!  Food is always fresh, clean, and whomever is at the counter (maybe the owner) is always nice. Highly recommend.
2016-03-20,5,Outstanding. Best Chinese food of my life. Fast too
2016-03-19,5,Praise the Lord for Lo Fatt Chow.100x better than the other chinese food restaurants in town. Delivery is quick, prices are better, and the food is more tasty.I do wish they were on seamless.
2016-01-02,5,I've ordered delivery here a few times and it never disappoints! Food is delicious and not greasy or oily at all, which is hard to find. Delivery usually arrives before the estimated time.
2015-12-10,1,I went back to this place today to give it a second chance by ordering the chicken wings with shrimp fried rice and the lady at the counter (owner) is nastier than the woman I encountered the first time. I told her she needs to learn better customer service and she fired back saying, "if I don't like the place I don't have to come back." I will NEVER go back and their food is not worth it. If you want great Chinese food, go to Precious on 1st & Washington. They're nice there too.Within the past week, I've tried their chicken wings with pork fried rice, string beans in garlic sauce and General Tso's chicken. While the fried rice is better than other hole in the wall Chinese restaurants, generally, their food is BLAND. Also, when I called for delivery and asked a simple question about the basic difference between Hunan and Szechuan, the woman who answered the phone sounded impatient and said, "we are busy right now." Even though she told me the difference she needs serious lessons on Good Customer Service. I will not be ordering from here again. There are better Chinese restaurants with better customer service on Washington St.
2015-12-07,4,BEST egg drop wonton soup! Comes in a huge container packed with delicious wontons.
2015-12-04,5,Omg. This is the BEST Chinese food I have literally ever eaten. I'm not even sure where to begin with my compliments...First of all, they do not use any MSG, which is awesome. Secondly, THEY USE REAL MEAT! All the meat is completely identifiable and they don't skimp on it. I ordered General Tso's chicken and it was actually huge chunks of chicken with very minimal breading. It was amazing! Their fried rice is amazing as well. It's still white, so I assume it's lightly fried or something, and the flavor is amazing. Best fried rice I've ever had. Thirdly, the place is clean. What more could you ask for?Everything tastes real here. There's no question about what you're eating. It's real food that you don't have to feel so guilty about eating. Also, it filled me up without making me feel like a cow and I wasn't hungry an hour later! Love this place!
2015-11-23,5,love their Fried chicken wings.. Wish the hot sauce they serve was like other chinese restaurants though
2015-11-21,1,I wish i could give negative star , ordered lo mein and got fried rubber band in the food. This place sucks to the core. Never order from here. The chinese lady doesn't even understand what i was speaking .
2015-11-20,5,This is by far the best Chinese takeout I've had in Hoboken. The spring rolls, vegetable soup, broccoli in garlic sauce, sesame tofu, and fried rice were so good we ordered them all twice in one week. Delivery is fast and the website is very user-friendly. So yummy!
2015-10-21,5,This place is absolutely delicious! Quick, cheap, & amazing quality! I ordered the chicken and broccoli dinner combo with hot and sour soup and a veggie roll for delivery...it arrived quickly, not greasy, and tasted amazing. Highly recommend
2015-10-17,4,I've actually ordered from this place several times and realized that I've never left a review. And I believe that should already speak for itself. I work nearby so I usually just order take-out and pick it up myself. The online ordering menu is very smooth and simple. The orders are prepared promptly. 99% of the time my order is waiting when I walk through the door. I heavily favor the Chicken and Broccoli in Garlic Sauce. The same order with Ginger sauce is great but I find the garlic sauce to be much tastier. Last night I had the General Tso's Chicken with Chicken Fried rice and that was also great. The portion sizes are pretty big and I often find myself splitting my meal into two.As I already mentioned this is my "go to" place when I am working in the area. I enjoy the food and the prompt service. So I will continue to order from here!
2015-10-07,4,FINALLYYYYYYY!!! Decent Chinese food in Hoboken that tastes good and doesn't make you feel disgusted with all the grease!
2015-09-30,5,Finally a delicious, reliable (I'm looking at you rice shop) Chinese take out in Hoboken. The portions are great for the dinner combo under $10 and all the food is very fresh. It's not doused in sauce and grease with a touch of noodles. Hope they're here to stay.
2015-08-12,4,Someone needs to start a food truck and start selling the wraps that they have here because they are really good and I am sure people would buy them!I ordered a Peking Duck whole wheat wrap which had "Chinese coleslaw" (which doesn't have mayo apparently), some kind of sauce (I assume Peking Duck sauce), and a choice of lo-mein, brown rice, fried rice, or white rice. I didn't realize the side option would be inside of the wrap so I asked for lo-mein but it actually was quite good. They also have sesame chicken, boneless ribs, General Tso's chicken or tofu, and buffolo chicken wraps available.As I mentioned, I thought putting these ingredients into a wrap made a lot of sense. The duck sauce was a little too sweet but it was balanced by the coleslaw. I did find one small bone in the wrap but I think mistakes can happen and I was able to realize it was there. I haven't tried the other options here but I would order again as I enjoyed the food. I would add that the noodles in particular that were in my wrap seemed a little greasy so I don't know how healthy it is but they don't use MSG and such which is at the very least a bonus.
2015-08-06,5,I've been living in Hoboken for 8 years and this is the best Chinese food I've had! My husband and I have ordered from here quite a bit and food has always been fresh and delicious. Online ordering is a breeze and they arrive within 30-40min. Check this place out!
2015-08-05,4,Finally found a good Chinese food place in Hoboken! After trying many other places in town over the years, I finally found my go-to Chinese restaurant. Ordering - super simpleDelivery - insanely fastFood - very tasty
2015-07-31,5,My absolute favorite chinese food place in Hoboken.  I never go anywhere else.  They are always friendly when I pop in to order or extremely dependable when they deliver.  Most importantly the food is great and you can tell the quality of ingredients are so much better.  Such a difference.
2015-07-30,4,Neat restaurant for a chinese place. Not a sit down restaurant, typically for carry out. The owner seemed a bit rude from the way she was talking to her employees and customers. Good food and good value for the buck.
2015-07-28,3,The lady in the front (I'm assuming the owner) was extremely RUDE!!!Other than that the food was really good but man was she rude and mean omg!
2015-07-08,5,Ordered delivery from here tonight seeking to try something new and I was pleasantly surprised. I got the dinner combo with hot garlic chicken, fried rice and hot and sour soup. Added the Asian spring roll to meet the $10 minimum for delivery. Ten bucks for all that food. What?! I couldn't even eat half of it and I'm stuffed which is surprising because I am a big eater. Leftovers will be tomorrow's dinner and I will enjoy every bite. Everything was great and I don't feel gross after eating it which is a first for having Chinese food. To top it all off the delivery guy (with cool funky hair) arrived in 30 minutes on the dot and everything was piping hot. I'll definitely be ordering from here again when I get my occasional Chinese food craving.
2015-06-28,1,Warning - This is a review solely based off the customer service! Went in to order some food and walked in to the owner yelling at one of the staff members. Decided to place an order for some soup and dumplings. We wanted to know what ingredients were part of the veggie dumplings and the owner responded in a remarkably snappy tone saying "mixed vegetables" and when we asked her to specify what types since we have some allergies, she merely said "just order something off the menu that you can see". I found that to be a rather obnoxious response! As the owner shouldn't you know the food you are selling; whether it was laziness in not wanting to converse with customers or mere ignorance at the type of food being sold - either way, that's not how you grow a business!Oh and now a review on the dumplings - we ordered the chicken dumplings which were super doughy and not very flavorful! Well this place was definitely a Debbie downer! On to the next spot!
2015-06-28,1,Wow. Just wow. My first time coming here, and it may be my last.Went in with my girlfriend to order some quick apps. Given our allergies to certain items I asked the lady at the counter to explain what's in the vegetable dumplings. She asked the owner (standing right next to all of us) to explain what are in the vegetable dumplings, to which her response was sour at best. She (the owner) said she didn't know what's in the vegetable dumplings and that if I have an allergy I should "order what I can see on the menu"...her words. Given the height of allergies and dietary restrictions in today's society, that is not an acceptable answer. I was happy to see the western end of Hoboken getting developed with new establishments, but with owners like that from Lo Fat occupying the space, I'd rather it be desolate.
2015-06-17,3,I can't speak for the veracity of their low fat claims but it tasted healthier enough. It also tasted a little bland. I guess that's what you get for trying to get healthy Chinese food. The tom yum soup was the best thing I had here, while some of the other dishes weren't overly impressive but not deflating. I guess the best thing you can say about this place is that the online ordering system works well. Ordered on the website and picked it up with no wait and no issues. But the ordering process shouldn't be your high point at a restaurant.My review in five words: It is what it is.
2015-05-09,5,Definitely a fresh take on traditional Chinese delivery! We were craving Chinese food but didn't want anything too greasy. My husband and I each got a dinner meal portion as well as veggie lo meon to share. I had the wonton soup. Everything was delicious, and I was surprised at how "light" the meal actually felt. As others have suggested, if you live in Hoboken, the online order form is super convenient. We will definitely order from here again.
2015-05-02,5,Chicken in black bean sauce & beef, pepper & mushroom & white rice was fantastic. Didn't feel guilty eating it ingredients fresh & very healthy. Delivered to door within 10 minutes. Amazing will not be going to another Chinese!!
2015-04-26,4,Decent chinese food.  There are a few dishes I'd stay away from. We like their lo mein and shrimp dishes.  Their sesame chicken was not good.  We ordered the chicken an rice soup and the rice soaked up all the soup. So it was like chicken w really wet rice when we got it.  I love their wonton soup though and their sweet and sour soup is good too.  My husband likes their spare ribs. Their lunch special is priced well and it's a good amount of food. Around $7 for the meal w rice and a small soup.
2015-04-25,4,Great new local business, Chinese takeout and delivery (Only a few barstools for eat-in). Very nice people working there. Food has been consistently good so far, check it out!
2015-04-20,5,After a few take-outs now to gauge Lo-Fat Chow , its easily the best Chinese option in Hoboken. The food just tastes healthier and better then the rest. Customize orders are easy as well. Super fast delivery!
2015-04-12,5,By far the best Chinese food in the area! I've lived in Jc and worked in Hoboken for 12 years now. I've tried numerous places in both areas and nothing is as clean and fresh as this. Fast delivery and dint get that over stuffed gross feeling after eating.
2015-04-04,3,Pretty good Chinese food.  Definitely done differently than your standard Chinese takeout place.  Healthier, yet very big portions.I really loved the szechuan wontons in peanut sauce.  Not many takeout places have that, so I had to try it.  The sauce was good.  But the wontons were a bit overboiled and soft.I was really looking forward to the Mongolian chicken stir-fry, but it was a bit too spicy and peppery for me.  I guess I could ask them to make it mild, but then it might taste like nothing.The sesame chicken was okay.  The sauce was not super great, but the pieces were real meat, instead of being half gristle and fry batter like at most other takeout places.Overall... I didn't enjoy this as much as I typically enjoy unhealthy Chinese takout places.  The sauces tended to be watery and less flavorful, except for the Mongolian, which had an excess of pepper and heat.  (I guess there's no calories in that.)    I think the reason for the lack of taste is the restaurant's desire to not use too much sugar, salt, starch, etc., to thicken its sauces, and its desire to avoid oil.That said, this might be the best takeout in the area, and is definitely not a bad choice if you are looking for healthful Chinese food.  I wish there were a high quality, low-health Chinese place around here- the type of place that would have meaty sesame chicken, but also have it in a thick and sweet sauce.  (And soup dumpling!)  But since there isn't, this is probably the only quality Chinese food around.The online ordering system is really cool.
2015-04-02,4,Very good Chinese for Hoboken.  Prett much every place has been very hit or miss but this actually has been consistent and tasty.  I hope though its not like the typical place that after a few months starts cutting corners and costs.  Highly recommend.
2015-03-22,5,The online ordering was very easy to use and very efficient! We paid with credit card and the receipt noted that the food would arrive at 8:09... The delivery guy was knocking on our door at 8:08 .. Incredible!! Delivery service= 5 star!The shrimp toast were delectable! We ordered chicken and broccoli, sesame noodles (warm), pad Thai, and a summer roll. Everything tasted delicious! This is our new go to Chinese food spot!  Not to mention the pad Thai was the best I've ever had from a Chinese place!! Food=5 star!
2015-03-19,5,Solid chinese food. Very easy menu and good food.Fast service.
2015-03-12,5,Our favorite Chinese take-out spot.  Everything tastes spot on and is delicious, and we never feel disgusting afterwards.  None of the flavor is missed here.  So so good.
2015-03-04,3,Ordered take-out from here yesterday.  Place was super clean.  They have many great and flexible menu options.  Everything is very inexpensive too.  All of the food I got was very fresh, not greasy or oily, and came in large quantities.  That being said, all of it was completely flavorless.  I had an egg roll, assorted dumplings, Hunan chicken with pork and pineapple fried rice, tofu vegetables with beef lo Mein.  I would give this place another chance, but if I'm going to waste the calories on Chinese take-out, I want that ish to be crammed with flavor crystals.  Maybe I came on an off night.
2015-03-01,5,Best Chinese take out in Hoboken.  We tried this place out, and thank goodness we did.  Their prices are comparable, albeit a bit higher, but it is 100% worth the price difference.  The food tastes better, the quality is much better.  We eat here at least once a week, if not more.1.  Online ordering - their webpage to order is simply fabulous.  Super easy and extremely customizable.2.  Fast delivery - the online ordering gives you options as to when to receive your food (if you want to order ahead of time for a later time/date), and if you pick ASAP, it's really fast - usually within 30-40 min.  Not bad!3.  Quality - the quality is much higher.  Large pieces of chicken for the General Tso's, the fried rice looks better, larger pieces of shrimp...everything you can think of, they do better (and I was raised in a Chinese Take Out family!).  Seriously, buy from here, you won't regret it at all.  Simply awesome!
2015-01-17,5,Delicious but healthy Chinese food!  We love everything we have ordered from here!  We recommend the house fried rice, chicken and rice soup, shrimp mei fun, pad thai, shrimp shimai, and the dumplings.
2015-01-10,5,Very impressed with the food quality and service. Would highly recommend for any folks in the Hoboken area.
2015-01-10,5,I love Lo-Fatt Chow!  The wings are orange beef is my favorite.  Service is fast and friendly too.  I highly recommend this. You can also order online which is a nice touch.  I ordered it when having friends over and everyone agreed, it was really good.
2015-01-03,5,Food is delicious! So happy to have finally found a healthy Chinese option in Hoboken. Dishes are light on the oil, MSG free and made with sea salt. Fiancé and I Ordered the stir fried Mongolian chicken and it was very light and loaded with fresh veggies. Definitely my new go-to.
2015-01-01,4,Solid Chinese food! They can make almost anything on the menu gluten-free as well. Not much seating, but it's definitely great for take out.
2014-12-29,4,Finally, a Chinese food option on the West Side.  This new place immediately becomes the best Chinese take-out in Hoboken (which, given the state of Chinese food in the neighborhood, could be construed as damning with faint praise -- but it's meant as a compliment).It's your standard menu, but everything seems fresher, lighter and tastier than the glop served on Washington St. Hoping this spot makes it (it's easy to miss in the Monroe Center).
2014-11-18,4,I'm a HUGE fan of unhealthy, greasy food. Even better if the food is drizzled with MSG and sodium. So I was a little hesitant about trying out Lo Fatt Chow but, people, I was pleasantly surprised! This "healthier version" of Chinese food is delicious and I did not notice the lack of grease. We ordered two dinner combo that came with soup and fried rice. Everything we tasted were delicious! I highly recommend this place. Try it!
2014-11-15,5,Alright I live across the street so this might be somewhat self-serving as I'd like to see Lo-Fatt do well :)Healthier Chinese is a great concept and this place executes it very well. You will notice a lack of starch and sodium immediately yet the food is delicious. Case in point: the hot and sour soup. I am sure there are many aficionados out there. Try this one!  I have ordered 10 meals already and  haven not been disappointed. The summer rolls are sizable and delish. When I order later in the evening I get the tofu vegetable soup. I love it because of the fresh ingredients and you can probably count the calories on one hand (ok maybe not quite that low).As a sidebar, the woman that owns Lo-Fatt is a very nice, highly educated, hard-working person. After a short conversation you will want to see her succeed.
2014-11-14,4,My new go to for Chinese. Praise Buddha because Hoboken is woefully lacking in dependable Chinese spots.The lunch special is too good a deal. Kinda feel like I robbed the joint. For $12.31 I got chicken in garlic sauce, chicken with broccoli, two orders of wonton soup, and two generous sides of brown rice (but you can also get white or fried rice - lo Mein is an extra buck). While not amazing, it was all quite good. And afterwards, I felt very satisfied rather than so full I wanted to pull the trigger then hungry again 15 minutes later.Here's what I liked:-they were generous with the wontons which were light and yummy-the chicken wasn't grisly and there was plenty of it, not all vegetables-the sauces were flavorful but not heavy or greasyHere's what could be improved:-the broth for the soup was totally flavorless-they packed forks and spoons, no knives, chopsticks or sauces, if you want them, request them-no crispy noodles for the soup, suppose that goes against their low fat concept-garlic chicken was advertised as spicy, not so much Excited to chow down here again.
