2021-11-01,5,Very fresh sushi. Been here Atleast 30Times Never disappointed  great portions. Good prices. Highly recommend
2021-10-05,2,This is probably the worst sushi I've ever seen or tasted. All the rolls were very loose, so much so, you couldn't grab them with chopsticks, or your hands, even. One of our rolls had lobster, and it tasted as though the lobster was overcooked in the microwave.The service was even worse. Our server never took a drink order, just gave us water. Never bothered to check how was everything neither asked if we wanted anything else. Definitely will not be going back.
2021-09-19,2,Really bad delivery. Rock shrimp was inedible slop, dumplings not cooked through. Sushi seemed old and dry. Pretty gross and won't eat from here again.
2021-09-13,5,I highly recommend this sushi place ! My family and I , we are fan of this place !! I been coming here since forever !! More than 8 years and nothing has change ! The taste is fresh and unique as always! James !! Wow more than thousands starts for him, he knows what we like and he never says no for us ! He is the best.  I always recommend this place to all my friends and family because for reallll is the best sushi ever ! THOUSAND STARTS FOR ROBONGI IN HOBOKEN!!
2021-07-26,4,this is just a lunch special review.the lunch special is such a great deal here. 3 rolls and then you choose a soup or salad. the salad is HUGE. its your simple salad, with the asian ginger dressing. my complaint is , why the full baby carrots? chop em up or get them out! The 3 basic rolls i had were nice. rice was cooked well and the fish tasted fine. i believe i had a boston roll, spicy tuna and salmon. for under $15 this meal was a steal!good service while we sat outside. PS BYOB.
2021-07-15,2,This place used to be great and I would go every month or so. Since COVID, the food has not been the same. Was there two weeks ago and 2 of be 3 of us got very sick the next day. The sushi tasted very bland and the service was not pleasant. Highly recommend Ayame as an alternative.
2021-07-07,3,Came here on my lunch break and was a little disappointed. I have gotten take out from here and it's always been great but now that they do dine in I decided to give it a try. The sushi was oddly very warm, even the sushi that is normally cold. The tempura had a stale feel and taste to it. Overall not a great experience.
2021-06-08,1,I placed an order for a Boston roll, spider roll and tempura roll all of which are flavorless and poorly made. Waste of money. Do yourself a favor
2021-06-06,3,The food is amazing, every single thing we ordered was delicious. The service though...OMG! the waiter seemed to be angry and in a hurry. He literally threw the menus on our table, left and came back 5 minutes later expecting us to have our order ready. We ordered appetizers and when he served them, there were no napkins-forks in the table; we asked him if he could bring them and then he just brought 3 ( we were a party of 5). Then he brought 3 napkins, all crumpled and we ( again) had to ask for a few more for the rest of us. Also, he never offered us any drinks ( it is a bring your own bottle restaurant) and just served us some glasses of water and never mentioned they had sodas. The service is the worst we've experienced in Hoboken and just for that, we don't think we'll ever be back.
2021-04-03,1,Vegetarians never order from this place, not a good customer service! I asked for an avocado peanut roll, and they gave me eel and avocado. When I tried to reason with them, they didn't give me time to choose, and they kept cutting my calls when I called back. Such a waste of money and time!
2021-03-22,3,I've been to Robongi for dinner a few times but this past weekend was the first time since Covid-19 started.  The nice thing is that they now take reservations if you call.  We made a reservation for 7:30 on Friday only a few hours in advance - no wait when we arrived.  Previously, Robongi used to blast EDM music on weekend nights and rush you throughout your meal, constantly checking if you are ready to order.  That was not the case this time.  It actually took a very long time before someone came to take our order.  We decided to start with the wasabi shumai and edamame.  The wasabi shumai was yummy and a great way to clear your sinuses because of the spice!  For rolls, we ordered 3 special rolls - the Mayflower, Sex on the Beach and the Bikini.  Unfortunately, the rolls came out minutes after the starters.  I wouldn't have ordered the edamame had I known everything was nearly coming out all at once.   Of the 3 rolls, the Sex on the Beach was our favorite.  The Mayflower roll was a mess to eat.  Every piece fell apart - the waiter blamed it on the scallop being wet and the soy paper.  Would not order that roll again. Overall, the meal was fine.  Was nice not to be rushed out for a change.
2021-03-15,5,Great experience here for dinner. Love that it's BYOB. The sushi rolls were great. Large portions of goyza, seaweed salad and house salads. Enjoyed my dinning in experience. They were very busy for take out as well. Will definitely be returning!
2021-03-03,5,I love this place for fresh sushi. I've been ordering from Robongi for over 6 or 7 years. They've never once messed up my order and it is always delivered on time. The fish always tastes fresh and while I was pregnant, they were happy to make alternations of certain rolls for me. Sometimes I may stray but I always come back to Robongi.
2021-03-02,5,Love Robongi. The servers are always sweet. Prices be ok. Fish is fresh. Easy if you are staying at the hotel near by or just want some fresh air and sit outside on the water. It's a hidden gem.
2021-02-23,2,The tofu was soggy and didn't have the crispness it's supposed to have. What kind of California roll doesn't have cucumber?
2021-02-18,5,The spicy scallop roll is the best sushi roll I've ever ordered. If you like big pieces of fresh scallop you'll love it. Yummmmmmmm
2021-01-25,5,Great service despite COVID 19. We sat outside and enjoyed our sashimi and two rolls. The black yellowtail is incredible. My boyfriend and I came here a few times. Our service has always been great and quick. Love the fresh fish and options. We will be back! Prices are on point.
2020-12-22,5,One of our go-to lunch places in Hoboken. Bento box lunches are great: for eleven bucks, one gets protein, rice, 3 gyoza, 3 pieces of sushi, and a salad. Today we ordered delivery; Covid has messed up everything. We liked to go there, usually sat outside, and a miso soup was included. Three year old Brandin loved the soup. We told him the tofu is cheese, which he loves. Service was always top notch, and very friendly. Delivery was fine, the good as good as ever. A great favorite. Can't wait for next summer, to sit out in the sunshine and eat a great lunch!
2020-11-11,4,Ordered sushi for my boyfriend and me. A lot of avocado ones: tuna avocado, salmon avocado. We got shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, spider roll, robongi roll. I'm usually weird with ordering sushi because I want to make sure it's a popular place... high turnover... less chance for old sushi. This sushi tasted fresh and was overall satisfying. There are a few other places I'd love to try... but perhaps when COVID is over. Robongi is the place to go when you want good sushi for a good price.
2020-10-09,1,terrible customer service. one of male waiter is super rude. no business from me again
2020-10-05,5,This spot has the best fried veggies I've ever had in my life. The egg plant is so delicious. I had the bento box and everything in this box was delicious. I was surprised because wasn't expensive very affordable. I will definitely come to this spot again.
2020-10-01,5,I am very picky when it comes to sushi so its amazing to know that I've been ordering so many times from this store now. Although I'm not much of a fan of their tamago, everything else is delicious!!
2020-09-13,5,Great lunch special for sushi! I got home from a long drive on Saturday and was famished so I went to pick up a late lunch for myself. I was psyched they had their special running on a Saturday and til 4pm. I got a salmon avocado roll, spicy tuna crunch roll, and tempura shrimp roll. All good.
2020-09-05,5,Great sushi, extremely nice and accommodating staff.   Always look forward to eating there.
2020-08-27,4,I had loved and frequented Robongi several years ago, but then it had closed for renovations for quite some time.  I only made it back there recently, but was glad that I did.  Our group was seated outside and enjoyed quick and efficient service throughout our meal.  I opted for the Paradise Plate sushi bar entreÃÅe, which came with a choice of miso soup or salad.  I selected the salad, which included iceberg lettuce, carrots, and 2 grape tomatoes in a zesty ginger dressing.  The Paradise Plate came with 2 pieces each of tuna, salmon, eel, and yellowtail sushi, as well as one Alaskan Roll (salmon & avocado).  All of the fish was extremely fresh and flavorful.  I was thrilled that Robongi was as fabulous as it was in the past!
2020-07-22,4,We just ordered delivery of spicy tuna sushi, sweet potato sushi and shrimp tempura sushi and beef curry donburi and the sushi was great but the donburi was not great....at all. I grew up in Japan and I make beef curry often but got lazy today and ordered take out. This was not good Japanese beef curry. There was no gravy and the beef was chewy with sauteed onions and cabbage and then rice underneath and it faintly tasted of curry but watered down and confusing. My kids is used to our Japanese curry with veggies and a savory gravy and beef so tender .....they pushed it away and ended up eating our sushi which they enjoyed and that was a celebration because it was the first time they gave sushi a try and liked it. The beef curry donburi was a no go in our home. Order the sushi.
2020-07-20,5,This spot was great, Loved the service. The food was nice and hot when it was served. The waiter even brought out the soda with the food and not before. Lol
2020-07-18,5,I went there for lunch, Ordered 5 rolls, every roll was perfect. Definitely definitely goinf back!
2020-06-28,4,Great Sushi, prices could be better in all was very satisfied. The spicy tuna and shrimp tempura was absolutely amazing!
2020-06-13,1,This was my second time going. Ayame is usually my go to spot in Hoboken. I got the maki combo for dinner. I was very disappointed to find a bone and a fish scale in my yellowtail! The scale was small but the bone was the size of a large human nail! How could you miss that? It's shown on the top left in the photo. I've never found anything like this in any other sushi restaurant. It was really off putting and I honestly do not think I will be returning. Other than that my experience was about average.
2020-06-09,5,My friend works in hoboken so this was his favorite sushi spot for lunch. Due to COVID, there's only takeout available. Therefore, when we craved good sushi, we got robongi delivered to our apartment in Jersey City. Ordered two three-roll combos that came with salad. Very fresh sushi, especially loved the scallop rolls.
2020-05-26,4,Good sushi, very pleasant customer service. Variety limited at the moment due to Covid(understandable).
2020-05-20,1,Packed wrong items for me and showed such poor attitude when I called. The guy insisted that he couldn't make a mistake because mine was the only order at that time. He even shouted at me: you don't know what eel is! Fine, it's not your mistake but mine - I shouldn't have placed the only order.
2020-05-16,2,I ordered from here last week ! Unfortunately, I found a hair in my food. (DURING COVID-19 BTW!) When I called, I was told that I would be refunded for the food that had hair in it, but they never did it. Safe to say, I will never order from here again. It wasn't even worth it.
2020-04-29,4,Full disclosure, I'm rating this place relative to other Sushi places in Hoboken. It seems like most sushi places converge on 3 star reviews after enough time, so finding one that stands out is difficult. While this place isn't quite "top-notch-Manhattan", I do think it's one of the best in Hoboken. The atmosphere inside is kind of neat and doesn't feel like I'm at a strip-mall sushi place. The staff here are really friendly, and the food is always fresh. I'm also a huge fan of it being BYO as well!
2020-03-29,4,Great atmosphere and good food. Only downside is it get crowded quickly and if you have a table they will try to rush you to turn thru tables quickly.
2020-03-14,5,Sushi is so good here. It's my go to sushi place and service is fast. Friendly staff.
2020-02-24,3,Good menu option, but Food is bland. Service is not exceptionally swift on a Monday lunch with a 70% full house. Waited a long time for everything.
2020-02-11,1,Can only give one star because I can't rate their food since I ended up canceling the delivery because after waiting over an hour food still hadn't arrived. Called the restaurant and they said they left. But food still wasn't here. It was a Tuesday evening at 830pm probably one of the slowest hours of the week. When we called to cancel they didn't really care as they probably get this all the time. Not sure how they stay in business.
2020-02-08,1,The food tastes bland and the saucess provided don't go well with the items.For the price the sushi is low quality, does not have the flavor you'd expect from an expensive Japanese restaurant.Would not go here again and wasn't able to finish the meal as the quality was so bad.
2020-02-08,1,Bento box was all fried food. All the food was completely covered in panko bread crumbs. Shrimp that comes with it had no flavor at all. The whole meal just tasted like fried panko. The California roll it came with was mostly just  a piece of avocado. We ordered a spider roll on the side and was pretty much just romaine lettuce. It was gross. Don't waste your money. It is overpriced for the quality.
2019-12-14,5,I enjoyed the best sushi EVER at this little treasure in Hoboken. Everything - tea, appetizers, and fish were delicious and fresh, the atmosphere cozy, and James's hospitality all WAY beyond five stars! Be sure to drop in for exceptional sushi!
2019-11-25,1,I went to eat with my girlfriend and the server who served me was hostile towards us. we are regulars at this place. My food was cold and the server harassed us in front of others to tip him for literally just giving us our food and that's it. I don't mind tipping if it was great service and food but when you're rude, i don't wanna tip you. I understand if he was coming back and forth to our table, but all he did was give us two plates and that was it. Disappointed in the service today, I'm never coming back.
2019-11-04,5,We ordered this as take out, and it was delicious! Had a few places take out and the sushi just doesn't taste as great. But this place did great! Very happy!
2019-08-22,5,Love this place !!!   And they just remodeled ! Looks great !My favs include : tonkatsu don and ume maki
2019-08-14,5,Excellent nigiri! Generous portioned appetizers. Quality uni and Ikura. Great service
2019-08-11,5,Came here for dinner Sunday night.It's BYOB.  Don't worry, this is a good thing.  I saved so much money!!!!  I went to Delite Market just one block away and bought a bottle of Chardonnay!I still haven't tried the crab or lobster.  The portions are huge so it definitely takes two.  I had a ramen dish instead.  It's super spicy but amazing and filling.  Definitely wasn't able to finish the whole thing.Servers are also super kind.  Definitely worth a stop.
2019-08-05,5,Having frequented this place many, many times over the years I felt an update was appropriate.  This is the best sushi you can find in Hoboken. It even rivals NYC locations, especially when price is taken into consideration.  The chirashi and sushi combos are on point, the fish is fresh, and servings are generous.  Hands down the best sushi in the area.
2019-06-28,2,So, the eel roll was pretty good. And the salad. But we ordered the sashimi regular combo, and my girlfriend and I both felt the taste and texture were just off. It just didn't taste fresh to us. The salmon was collapsing, the white tuna tasted funny... we just weren't satisfied, didn't finish, and didn't want to take the leftovers home. Now, all that's fine, sometimes places don't get it right all the time. But we told the waiter and he immediately became defensive and said, "There's nothing I can do. We've been here 20 years and you're the first ones to complain." Uh. He brought over the head chef, who launched into a long speech about how the fish is brought in fresh every morning and he personally tastes it, has it for his breakfast. Okay, good for you, but that doesn't change the fact that your *customer* is unsatisfied. I wasn't even expecting a comp, but at least a percentage off, come on! It was clear we didn't finish most of the different sashimi. With that, I just can't justify coming back here, or recommending it. You can screw up the food, but at least have some level of customer service.
2019-05-20,4,I've dined in and also ordered for take out. Great quality sushi for a local joint. I've had the sushi deluxe, spicy salmon, and spicy scallop roll. Spicy scallop was so smooth and fresh. They're also very generous with their miso soup. I prefer eating here because it's more fresh and the sushi isn't cramp together with the wetness from the ginger.For take out, they put  too much ginger next to my sushi that my rice was soaked. I would prefer a bigger box for the sushi deluxe or separate the sushi and the roll. Quality of the fish was good but I would dine in instead. Also great customer service.
2019-05-16,3,I can't figure this place out - at times it is very good  and then, last week, below  average, borderline tasteless sushi.  That makes it even more disappointing . There are too many other good sushi places to visit in Hoboken
2019-05-14,5,Was really jonesing for sushi the night I came here BUT I will absolutely be back for the crab boil or a big pot of mussels or another one of the amazing things I saw while checking out the menu. The place was packed when we came here on a Friday night. Still, we had no problem at all getting a seat outside. Although it was really busy, our waiter, who was running around gettin stuff done, was fantastic. You could really tell how swamped he was but he made sure to get our order in quick and check on us regularly. The garlic shrimp that we had as an appetizer was so tasty. It's isn't a huge dish, but great as a starter. The sauce was perfect, I wish I had bread to soak up whatever was left of it. I also got a seaweed salad and two sushi rolls and I was stuffed. I am a creature of nature so ordered a tuna avocado roll and eel avocado roll - both fantastic and not heavy on rice. I tried my boyfriends beef negimaki (something I'd never had before) and was very intrigued and impressed. It was basically scallions wrapped in beef, so it looked like little sushi rolls. I only had one roll, so can't speak to it too much, but if you aren't a sushi person or want something different or even a non-seafood plate to share, I highly recommend. This awesome little place on Washington is BYOB, so bring a bottle of wine and sit out side and have some amazing sushi/other things.
2019-05-14,3,I believe this place is known for its seafood, however; I have not had the luck of trying it, yet. I did stop by with a friend as a first timer to try their sushi. Was sat outside, the seating is very crowded and close to each other that you can literally hear the conversation next to you, too close for comfort. We ordered two special rolls and a California roll along with the chicken yakitori just to give it a try. The two special rolls were very heavy with a lot of rice as well as the California roll which filled us up quick. Americanized sushi... As I feel about many of the other restaurants in Hoboken, they cater to the Western palettes that are so so prevalent here which is unfortunate. The chicken yakitori was a disappointment as it was tasteless even after being doused with teriyaki sauce. The food took awhile for a half empty restaurant, 15-20 minutes before we received our first appetizer, two skewers with chicken on it. This is not a real sushi place as I have had my fair share, but not a bad place to order from if you are having a group of friends over. Price is definitely not worth for what you get. Better as an expensive takeout option imo lol.
2019-04-21,2,Immensely disappointed. Price wise, this establishment believes they're high end Japanese sushi, when in reality they're probably worse than sushi that I find in the fridge at 7-11. One of the worst experiences with sushi that I've ever had. Avoid this place like the plague. Their donburi was alright. Sushi, never again. 2 stars for the donburi, minus 3 for this overpriced garbage sushi.
2019-04-17,1,Worst delivery service ever, my 89 year old grandmother could have drove there 4 times and back before the deliver got here. On the seamless app they claimed it was deliver 30 minutes before it actually did. When you call and complain they keep saying 10 minutes- food was cold when arrived didn't even say sorry for being late.
2019-03-30,3,Salmon is not good. Very fatty and cut too close to the skin, most pieces were inedible.
2019-03-24,4,A delicious new find for us! Fresh, quality food delivered so very quickly. The food was steaming hot when it arrived. I had spicy garlic chicken. The 'sauce' was light, not full of sugar, and definitely house made. The other fish we ordered was beef pad Thai. Again, fresh and delicious. We look forward to not only ordering for delivery, but going to the restaurant to try more dishes. We highly recommend!
2019-03-20,1,This review is based on Uber Eats order. I felt that this restaurant did not hesitate to give me spoiled (toxic/ not edible at this point) scallop pieces as this is an uber eats delivery as opposed to in person (which you can immediately tell and not eat it based on the foul smell of the sushi!!!). It was a big disappointment. I ended up throwing away $35 worth of food as soon as I received it, because I was afraid to get sick from it.Also, I have been to many sushi places and I could tell they do not properly handle fish and does not cut it properly either. Pretty bad sushi place. I'm not quite sure why people would go here.
2019-03-13,4,Ordered sushi take out from Robongi and was impressed by how quickly they delivery the food and the quality of their fish. All of the food was packaged very neatly with plenty of soy sauce, chop sticks, and ginger & wasabi. Ordered Kani salad, salmon tar tar, and garlic squid for apps - all tasty, would get them again in the future! For sushi, we ordered some nigiri, maki and speciality rolls and the salmon and tuna were perfect - fresh and generous slices of fish with a small ratio of rice. Seems that you can't go wrong with any of the sushi you order, just depends on your palate. Definitely recommend Robongi if you're in a casual sushi mood!
2019-02-24,5,I've been dining at Robongi for about 10 years now and the sushi is always fresh.  The service is impeccable and it's BYOB. This is the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken for sure!
2019-02-21,5,Ived been coming here for 20 years nice amazing food is amazing still same flavor cheft and staff luv it
2019-02-14,3,It's alright. They do give a lot of food but nothing great about it. I got the teriyaki salmon bento box, the teriyaki salmon wasn't terrible but wasn't great either. Miso is okay. Tempura was pretty good though
2019-01-25,5,This is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken. Better prices than illusion nearby and better quality and tasting sushi rolls. More bang for your buck and tastier! Don't let the weird crab shack look throw you off.
2019-01-07,5,Walked in here on a whim craving some sushi, and picked the perfect spot! Chill atmosphere and good service. Not to mention the sushi and miso soup were delicious! One roll (I forgot the name) was wrapped in cucumber instead of rice, which gave it such a unique flavor. And the price didn't break the bank either.
2018-12-18,4,Order on the website, delivery was fast ,the food was good ,especially fish ,very fresh!
2018-12-09,4,This is my go to sushi spot in Hoboken. The prices are affordable, the sushi is very fresh and there are a lot of options on the menu. The staff is attentive during dine-in and it's BYOB! I often get takeout and I only have to wait 10-15 min for my food to be ready. The lunch specials are a great deal if you're eating during that time.
2018-11-25,3,I have had mixed experiences at Robongi. I've had some good experiences but then had one food poisoning experience which has led me to never return. I would normally give someplace that got me a sick a 1-star but in fairness but prior to this I did like Robongi thus the 3-star (I was trying to be fair) Needless to say though my Robongi days are over
2018-11-14,1,The food is not fresh. I have diarrhea every time, even I am not choose sushi or sashimi. I never order again.
2018-10-14,2,Everytime I walk by this place it is packed and I always wondered why. They are byob so that is probably a big reason. I had tried in the past but I had to try again so I ordered delivery from here last week. Here is my take on the food...Pacific soy roll had a fishy smell to it. Not good. The rock shrimp appetizer was not crunchy and had no flavor. It was kind of slimy. The veggie gyoza were ok at best. They tasted like any other gyoza I have had. The best thing we ate were the regular rolls. The spicy tuna avocado roll and the shrimp tempura roll.Not sure why this place is full every time I walk by. I didn't not think the food was quality. It is probably the fact that their are very few byob places these days.
2018-10-09,1,terrible disgusting sushi.  not fresh at all.  I hope I don't get food poisoning
2018-09-25,5,I love Robongi! It has been my go-to sushi spot for years. Always fresh, prompt delivery (if you don't feel like going out) and BYO (if you do!). What more could you want? Also, slightly more affordable than some of the other sushi places in town.
2018-09-08,5,Amazing. I am a sushi connoisseur and the quality was amazing. First off, got a really great first impression as soon as I walked in. The owner could not have been nicer and more accommodative. Onto the sushi - the owner told me that they just got in some really good tuna that was like toro...it was unreal (I got sushi pieces) Buttery and delicious. Also had salmon and yellowtail sushi - salmon was good, yellowtail was amazing. We also got a few special rolls. One with lobster and the other with king crab and shrimp tempura. Both were great. I also got two hand rolls, one with spicy crab and the other with lobster tail. Unlike some places that use some questionable lobster mixes, this was legit lobster tail and nice chunks at that. Definitely try this place if you want great food and great service.
2018-09-05,5,The best sushi place ever! Great service and amazing food! Everything is fresh and delicious. Our favorite place!
2018-08-19,5,Love this place. Good sushi, good service. Everything tastes perfect. We always go there when we feel like a casual Japanese food and we're always happy.
2018-08-11,3,This place is a solid 3.5 stars, we came here last weekend for lunch. Apart from having lunch specials on weekdays, they also have them on weekends. We got the tempura shrimp lunch box and the sushi trio rolls. Food came out quickly and it was good, sushi definitely was average but for thr price we paid, the food was good. Service was good as well, and our water glasses were refilled quite regularly.
2018-07-18,4,Sushi cravings took us to this place based on all the Yelp reviews. Wasn't really disappointed. It is BYOB so we grabbed a couple of bottles of wine. Our server was kind and pleasant, She helped us navigate through the menu and was very attentive. We asked to sit outside and it was such a pleasant experience. We ordered 4 kinds of hand rolls and 2 chef specials. The spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls were fantastic. Fresh and super flavorful. We thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp tempura, California and avocado rolls too among the others. Hoboken has like a bazillion restaurants, glad we found our go-to sushi place in that area.
2018-06-30,5,Never unhappy when we come here! The sushi is always super fresh, and the service has always been amazing. Our waiter was very funny and made us feel at home. Whenever we're in the area we have to come here or the bf gets hangry :)
2018-05-27,4,It's a quite satisfactory place. The sashimi was tasty but didnt have much surprise. It's a good place for a light dinner. not sure if i will come back.
2018-05-16,4,Great tuna roll and the quality is there, i wish the portions were a little bigger for the price point though !
2018-05-04,5,Where to begin. This gem is located on the bustling thoroughfare of Washington street in Hoboken. Once you find the golden parking spot, you will be amazed at the food and atmosphere. Every dish is given its proper presentation and you will have a great time.
2018-04-17,5,Sushi is my favorite food, and Robongi is definitely my favorite place get it from! Fresh and delicious every time, just as I like it. Service is amazing and helpful. Getting take out from Robongi is quick and easy and the order is never messed up. I recommend the rainbow roll and rock shrimp app- flavors pack a punch!! Presentation is neat and really pretty to look at! I would go everyday if I had the time!!
2018-04-08,4,I have been coming to this place for nearly 10 years. I haven't been in a while; and when we went this week, the place has clearly changed ownership. First, there are still CHRISTMAS decorations up - It's APRIL! They re-did the place - I have to say, the bathroom looks much better but I miss the old decorations. This placed used to be packed every night of the week, and it was a ghost town when we went. The food was good and the portions were still really great for the price, this the 4 stars. A few pieces of the tuna was oddly chewy. The staff was nice and very accommodating, it just definitely felt different then it used to.
2018-03-26,5,One of my favorite restaurants! Sushi here is amazing. I've been going to this place for years I mean like over 5yrs maybe even more!
2018-03-23,4,Consistently good food. Great Sashimi, Edamame, Tofu, Udon, etc.  The interiors are like any other casual dining place in Hoboken. I took away 1* because it can get really loud on Fri night or Sat night.. you cant even hear each other sitting in front of one another.
2018-03-17,3,Food is spectacular, service is horrible though. Theyll give you your food, but in the most unfriendly and lifeless way possible. Food is really great though.
2018-02-26,4,I would have given it 5 stars, but after the shutdown and reopening it just isn't the same including menu options. The food is still quality, but it isn't the same Robongi that I (and others) would get take out from.
2018-02-16,3,Robongi is your basic takeout sushi. I recently paid a visit one Friday night with my boyfriend and his parents. It was around 5:30, so it was still pretty empty. None of us were too hungry, so we ordered the sashimi platter, and a seafood teriyaki.The sashimi was again, your basic takeout sashimi. However, the white tuna (usually my favorite) was less than basic - it was still a bit frozen. The seafood teriyaki was drowning in this sticky, thick sauce, and it wasn't very good overall.Tip - it's BYOB, but so are a lot of other sushi spots in Hoboken so I wouldn't recommend this place.
2018-02-10,2,Ughh. I am done with Robongi.Ive been ordering delivery for years.I stuck with them because they continue to make the best spicy tuna and spicy scallop rolls. No one makes em as good IMO.However, the rest of the sushi keeps going downhill.Several times now, the rolls are made very sloppily, and the tun rolls are INEDIBLE.Tonight I waited an hour and 40 minutes for delivery, and once again, my tuna roll was disgusting. The tuna was cut in a huge chunk and I felt the muscle or whatever it is when I bit into it . Uuuuugggghh. I could have  cut the tuna better. Zero finesse or technique,  and obviously a bad cut of the tuna.You know its bad when your cats wont even eat it. Never again!
2018-01-27,5,First time here. Definitely will be back. Wait staff amazing, very attentive. Sushi was awesome. Spicy tuna roll, a hint of hot sesame oil, elevates it to a whole new experience. Spicy squid was cooked perfect. Can't wait to come back!!
2018-01-05,4,Wow! I'm so happy they remodeled (awesome bathrooms) and got a new staff!! Service was fantastic and attentive, unlike the non existent service before. I also really like their music selection but Sushi Lounge has better fish. Just sayin.
2017-12-27,4,Has been a Hoboken favorite for a while.  Usually not too crowded and relatively kid friendly.  BYOB.  Sushi was good and seemed fresh.  I usually get one of their teriyaki dishes which never disappoints.  Hard to imagine this dropping out of our rotation.
2017-11-26,5,Nice food with average price. Best cost effective Japanese restaurant on Washington ST.
2017-11-09,1,I came here with my mom for dinner last week because she was craving white rice, so sushi it is! I ordered the Tonkatsu Don Buri (Deep fried tender pork and vegetable with egg and sauce over rice) and it was the blandest thing I ever ate. The pork, the vegetable, even the egg had no flavor. I was actually wishing I had ketchup on me so I could give the dish some flavor and that is a sentence that I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD WRITE ABOUT A JAPANESE RESTAURANT.My mom ordered the Japanese Fried rice which same thing, no flavor. We didn't finish our food and left feeling pretty unsatisfied.  Everything was pretty lackluster and I was unimpressed.The one good thing was their special, the Takoyaki, which was decent but was $5 for four pieces which was expensive. The service was good and the waitress kept refilling my water.
2017-10-30,3,Great place to go for a quick dinner. the service is extremely fast, but i felt rushed. The sushi was amazing and the rolls were big. The atmosphere inside is pretty cool the walls are covered with beach themed objects.
2017-10-02,1,there is no AC in summer. Very hot and smelly inside. I can't imagine some ones like this
2017-09-30,5,Well time has passed and I have returned to Robongi.   Hands down the best sushi in Hoboken.Nice manager up front but not very nice in the phone
2017-09-17,1,This past Friday night called an order for pick up, they tell me it will take 20-25 minutes, I show up and patiently waited since it was busy but not to the point where they have people waiting for seating. I ended up waiting 45 minutes for the order for qpick-up, no one cared to see what the status was on the order (customer service 101) and then I went up to check on the status and asked to speak to the owner about their service and no one wanted to take action or speak to me, very disappointed Dave with your staff and service, I have been going to your place for years. You just lost a regular customer who won't be going back to your restaurant.
2017-09-09,5,Living in Hoboken, Robongi is a regular place for us. Robongi has been our longstanding go to sushi joint- take in or take out atleast once a week! This is the ultimate diamond in the rough. When you walk in the front door of Robongi, it seems like any other generic restaurant, but when you eat the food, it stands apart. The atmosphere rating is a bit less than the others because Robongi is not a place to linger nor have intimate conversations. I've never had a bad dish in this restaurant. They have Udon noodle dishes, sashimi, salads, etc, all of which are excellent. My favorite roll is the American Dream Roll, I could eat this roll multiple times a week! (salmon, avocado and cucumber inside, with spicy king crab, snow crab and mixed red tobiko on top) Note: BYOB.
2017-09-08,3,I've been going to this place for YEARS, but last time I went (in July during St Anne's) I saw a roach in the ladies' bathroom. :(Their food is great though.
2017-09-06,2,Wanted to grab some good sushi with a friend from out of town and stumbled across Robongi. It was nearly empty during lunchtime on a Saturday--I was hoping to take her to a more popular and busier place. I ordered some sushi and it wasn't anything too special--kind of dry and boring. Since the place was nearly empty I had the opportunity to sit for many hours and catch up with my friend, which was lovely. After we paid the check, though, they stopped serving us water, even after we stayed. Not terribly impressed--wouldn't recommend to a friend.
2017-08-29,4,Order take out sometimes from this place. Food is not always consistent. Sometimes you get really good food and sometimes food seems like staff just threw it together. My broccoli was undercooked and seemed like it wasn't fresh. Service isn't that great. Staff seems annoyed when you ask for extra soy sauce.
2017-08-28,5,Hands-down, best sushi experience I've had in the area. I eat a lot of sushi, and I have only had 1 negative experience in 5 years with Robongi, over about 100 orders from both locations, dine-in, take-out, and delivery. The fish is consistently fresh, the rice is always well-cooked, and the rolls are always well made. I entertain several sushi-loving friends with Robongi when they are in the area as well. I know there are plenty of sushi places in Hoboken, but after trying many, the only one that keeps me coming back is Robongi!
2017-08-25,4,Been around a few sushi joints in Hoboken and this is our favorite. The special rolls are the bomb and taste really fresh. The decor is a little strange in that it's sort of decorated as a little beach shack, but the food is good and that's all that matters. Been to Sushi House (good but not consistent in quality), Ubu (more for Korean or non-sushi dishes), and this is definitely our favorite for sushi! I've heard that this is on par with Sushi Lounge in terms of quality but more affordable. Definitely come check it out!
2017-08-17,1,The "grilled" tuna was dry and flavorless. If you have to eat here, don't order that. I actually feel nauseous.
2017-08-09,2,The sushi smelled and tasted stale. It had a weird fishy smell. The kitchen entrees are decent nothing to write home about. There are other sushi places that serve fresher food.
2017-08-09,5,I go here mainly for the lunch specials, and I only started going here since Ayame has weird lunch hours (as in they don't exist some days).  But their two roll sushi special is great in that you get two full rolls of your choosing from the small lunch special menu and a soup or salad for under 10$.  My delivery.com order usually comes to around 10-11$ when I include tip.  Admittedly, their rolls do sometimes fall apart easily, but they give you plenty of ginger and wasabi.  I have no complaints, except that I'm pretty sure they usually finish my order before the pickup time if I'm going thru delvery.com.
2017-08-07,4,Truly delicious and fresh food. But the mediocre service.
2017-08-05,4,My music engineer ordered this food for us while we are recording here in hoboken, recommending the lunch special. He was right, the special seems to be the way to go. I made the initial error of ordering specialty rolls today. After a lengthy discussion about the quantity I received and quality of rolls (two specialty rolls, 10 pieces total and a discombobulated assortment) I finally was given an extra order of one of my rolls to rectify the error.The menu does not specify the fact that some of the specialty rolls are served in small quantity. However the food was good, albeit a tad sloppy. I am happy that the restaurant obliged my request to even the order to the money I spent (21 dollars) I thank the staff for making things right and I would point out that providing food for the masses is not an easy business, and mistakes happen. I hope the owners take note of the fact that their menu is a little misleading, and that the public understands that people in the food business work as hard as anyone can to provide satisfaction to a wide array of people.In the end this restaurant made the extra effort to serve me and my band mates a satisfying lunch, and that alone is commendable, considering the endless array of complaining patrons they accommodate. I wish them luck and thank them for the quality food and personal service they provided us.
2017-06-01,4,Great lunch menu. We're cool with my request for swapping our cucumber for avocado on one of the 3 rolls on the lunch special. Could use some ice in there ice water when brought to the table. Other than that, good sushi, great price. I'll be back.
2017-05-31,5,This place is so fun for groups or for date night. The atmosphere is always lively and they don't mind if you get a little rowdy doing sake bombs. The food is forever fresh. Too many items on the menu for me to recommend lol so just come here and I am sure you'll enjoy anything on the menu
2017-05-19,2,real bad sushi place. congested as hell, you literally always touch your neighbors with your elbows. Food doesn't taste fresh, and all dished are primitive. They try to exploit the name and location, since Hoboken visiting crowd will literally consume anything. Locals are staying away.
2017-05-11,1,Came here for dinner on Thu with my nephew since we were just walking around and didn't look at yelp review and trusted all the Zagat ratings on the window.  WRONG!  Ordered grilled cod fish  and when it arrived, it has 3 pieces, one of them was cod and the other 2 were some low quality $2/pound swai fish at low end supermarket.  Do you really think you can cheat on customers and bet they can't tell the difference between cod and low quality fish?  Come on....Never going back and trust the yelp of 3.5 star review. Go somewhere else...
2017-04-28,5,Sushi was awesome. Pricier place in Hoboken compared to all the others but quality is there for sure. Smaller place inside but has a cool vibe.
2017-04-27,4,Good sushi and they have great lunch specials. BYOB and quick service.
2017-04-10,3,First time ordering take out sushi in Hoboken and eh. I saw lots of reviews that people love this place so I figured I would give it a shot. I got a sweet potato roll, spicy tuna and cucumber avocado. They weren't bad but I've definitely had better. Maybe they are more of a dine in sushi restaurant so for now I think I will browse other options.
2017-04-09,5,Love that this place is BYOB, it saves so much money!! Their sushi is to die for, and made super fresh. Restaurant is small, so it can get crowed, but if weather is nice outdoor seating is the best! Wait staff are friendly and helpful, and you'll leave beyond satisfied. So sad I don't live in the area, this is definitely one of the places I miss the most!
2017-02-16,4,Best sushi that delivers to our part of the Heights. Our only issue is that a few of the delivery guys refuse to come to the door. It's happened on more than one occasion with different drivers. They park in our driveway and call us to come out and get the food. We order online and no longer pre-tip. We noticed that if they already have $$ it's a sure thing that they will be calling us to come out.
2017-02-02,2,Tried this place one night after deciding to switch up my regular sushi spot in town. I wasn't thrilled with this place. The decor is... odd. Sushi is ok, but nothing to write home about. With so many sushi choices I'd definitely go elsewhere.
2017-01-07,1,We had some friends over and decided to order Robongi. Our order came out to $80 and we ordered a lot of sushi for our guests.  When the order came, there were four rolls missing.  I called them right away to let them know.  The manager got on the phone with me and actually argued that we weren't short the rolls.  He didn't even apologize for it!  I told him that I wouldn't be calling if we had everything.  He said he'd take care of it.When we received the rest of the delivery, we were still short two rolls!  We have ordered from Robongi in the past and they've always done well.  However, their callous attitude warranted this post and we will never order from them again.  All of our sushi business will be going to Sushi Lounge in the future.
2016-12-07,5,I came here for lunch after finding out Ayame opens at 2pm today. When I entered, I found fishing decorations all around the restaurant.Ordered their hamachi kama, chicken roll, april mist roll, and the sausage and grilled pork donburi. The four items costs $42 in total.The hamachi kama is basically a grilled piece of yellowtail neck. It is served with some spicy tomato sauce and ponzu sauce.The chicken roll are rolled up pieces of chicken with cheese, spinach, and crab. It is served with some tonkatsu sauce.The april mist roll are sushi with spicy salmon, shrimp tempura, kani salad and eel sauce. The sushi were delicious and crunchy.The sausage and grilled pork donburi is basically a Chinese rice dish. In their seasonal menu, it's called la mei fan, or preserved meat over rice. Usually, when my family makes such a dish, it has preserved Chinese bacon and sausages. Some restaurants includes preserved duck. In this restaurant, it includes sausages grilled pork, snow peas, and a fried egg. The grilled pork is based on Japanese yakibuta meshi.The place wasn't that crowded when I entered. By the time I left, it was empty.
2016-11-17,4,Good place in Hoboken for typical sushi fare. BYOB!  On Friday nights it gets pretty clubby with low lights and loud music, Club Robongi at its best!  One advice, don't get the Ramen noodles, you'll find better making instant noodles at home.
2016-11-15,1,I like the food at Robongi but unfortunately I will have to stop ordering from them because this is the second time that my order took over 2 hours to be delivered! And tonight it's a Tuesday night!!! I placed my order at 6pm and received a confirmation from Seamless that the food would be delivered between 7:09 and 7:19 which was already a later time than what initially was given me. Now it's 7:53 and the restaurant is telling me that it will take another 30 minutes to deliver my order!!! This is totally unacceptable! 2;30 hours to get a freaking sushi dinner delivered???? The first time i tought it was an honest mistake but now it's the second time in a row!I don't know what kind of management they have now, but it's totally unreliable. By the way when I asked to talk to the manager they told me Mr. Raymond was not there tonight. Well, that explains it
2016-11-06,3,Went there on a weeknight. I know the reviews about this place is mixed but still decided to give it a try. The interior is very nice. This is all coming from a vegetarians perspective for the food though. I got the shitaki mushroom roll,sweet potato roll, cucumber and avocado roll, and vegetable dumplings. The food was super average. The rolls were filling but I need three plus an appetizer to be full. The rice they used for sushi did not taste that good. Plus the rolls were dry. It's not the worst but it's not the best. It's nice that it's byob. But I think too expensive for the quality.
2016-10-15,2,Paradise platter is wonderful. Unfortunately, a waiter felt the need to put his foot on the bench every time he spoke to the customers next to my table.
2016-10-07,5,As a true sushi snob (having worked for a Japanese company in NYC for 12 years in the 80's and being introduced to all the best sushi places in NYC), Robongi continues to be a solidly great sushi restaurant in town. I would choose it over many NYC sushi restaurants as well. They are the real deal. Always fresh, always tasty, always authentic.
2016-09-27,4,After my series of unfortunate events at Sushi Lounge, I was in desperate need for a new sushi spot in Hoboken. I came here for lunch with two coworkers and I was pleasantly surprised! Their lunch special menu is great. Tons of rolls to choose from and you can opt for noodles, rice, bento boxes... whatever your heart desires. The lunch special with two rolls is a GREAT value... $9?! Omg, I can eat here every day. I had the spicy tuna crunch and salmon avocado roll. There are plenty of sushi restaurants that can mess this up, but Robongi was not one of them. They pack tons of fresh fish into the roll, and I thought it was very flavorful, unlike other sushi places at a similar price point. Service can be better, but they were pretty responsive once we got their attention. TLDR; Great affordable lunch specials + quality food = regular lunch place near work. Highly recommended!
2016-09-15,1,The water is smelly, sashimi lunch is not fresh, some pieces were even half-frozen when served.  When I told the waiter about it, he mocked me - " you're incapable of appreciating the best part of a tuna"
2016-09-09,2,Food was delicious and served quickly. Music is a little loud and clubby even pre-8PM (I get it, they are a place where people come to BYOB with large groups for dinner) and I'm honestly fine with that, it wasn't so loud that I couldn't hear myself talking or anything. What really annoyed me was that when it was clear that we had finished eating, the waiter tried to rush us out. We were finishing our bottle of wine and he actually said to us "are you done yet? I have people waiting." Mind you, we had spent all of 35 minutes at our table and ordered a good amount of food, it's not like we had been sitting there for hours with bottles of wine and only ordered an appetizer. I was enjoying myself until that happened and after that experience I definitely won't be back.
2016-08-27,5,Really great fast service I always order delivery and they are quick Food quality is very high and portion sizes are great too
2016-08-21,1,This has been my favorite Japanese place for more than 5 years- dining in and delivery.  My delivery order today was a horrible experience- the delivery man yelled and was so aggressive I was scared to let him in!  (He initially couldn't work the keypad).  Once he got inside, he was pulling at the doorknob to my apartment unit...I spoke to the manager after who said delivery staff are anxious to be on time and if his yelling bothered me just don't order from them anymore.  Sadly, that's what I'll have to do!
2016-08-13,1,I use to go to this place all the time (order or in the restaurant) and tonight my order wasn't good at all. Sushi was messy, missing avocado on some pieces, avocado looked brown (5 pieces for $10, I better see good quality rolls). I brought them back and the waiter told me it's NORMAL.... They didn't even accept that they didn't look good. They won't see me again.
2016-08-07,2,Tried to expand my Japanese delivery horizon beyond Okinawa and big mistake. The spicy tuna roll was extremely small and just not good. They don't use real wasabi. The vegetable udon noodle bowl lacked flavor and really any positive element whatsoever. Will not be ordering again.
2016-06-18,5,Just an update to my previous review -- its more of a heads up to the restaurant. I order from this place 1-2 times per week and delivery takes around 25-30 minutes every time yet delivery.com always says it will take 45-60 minutes. Not sure if that can be fixed or not but there's no need to undersell the quickness of the delivery service!
2016-06-18,4,Very good sushi by Hoboken standards.  About 1 in 10 times they lose the order; most of the time if you continually call and pester they will eventually find and deliver it.  For this reason, I don't recommend if you absolutely must have the sushi on time.  If you're OK with a ~10% chance that your order will get lost and delayed by 60-90 minutes then definitely try it out.I know this sounds sarcastic but I'm personally OK with the 1/10 chance that they screw up delivery; I don't _like_ it but I'm willing to live with it.
2016-06-13,1,Mehh, Place was extremely over crowded when I went with a group of 8 on a Saturday and took 30 minutes to finally get a waiter. On top of that they refused to put on the air conditioning in the restaurant so it was a solid 80 degrees in the there. Nothing like eating sushi prepared at disgustingly hot temperatures. They also forgot to put ice in our drinks and some of the drinks actually had soap in them from the previous wash I guess. Only redeeming quality is that the food was cheap, but the quality was subpar so I think I paid a fair price for crap food.
2016-05-31,4,Ordered sushi and sat outside.  We ordered what I thought was an unusual sushi roll, but the food came out in literally seconds, like maybe 45 seconds.  I couldn't help but think they had it made already in the fridge, not freshly made.  But it tasted great, and it was nice to sit outside and people watch.  I forget which roll I got, dragon roll or something, you get a good amount of pieces.  It's BYOB, so they give you a bucket of ice to chill your beers in.  Overall very fast service, food was good, no complaints except the suspiciously fast food.  Hard to complain about that, but it would have been nice to spend some time relaxing before eating.
2016-05-18,1,It hurts me to write this review...This used to be my go to sushi place for my delivery service until... One Friday night I decided to order my usual sushi supreme. I always give my eel, shrimp and tuna roll to my bf. After I finished my part of the meal, I handed over the remaining items to my bf and he went for the shrimp nigiri. He examined the shrimp nigiri and noticed there was a small roach! We didn't even bother to call the restaurant because I already ate all of my portion. I can say now I will never go back to this place...
2016-05-11,4,Ok, came back for dinner on a lovely warm Spring day and sat outside.  We picked up some chardonnay at Sparrow's a few blocks down.  There was no wait which was awesome.  Decided to go with the classics this time and not experiment.  I ordered one of the sushi meals which included a spicy tuna roll, tune and avocado roll and crunchy white tuna roll with a miso soup.  My group also ordered the pan fried pork gyoza and shrimp shumai.  I was definitely happy with my choice this time, the sushi definitely tasted fresh and was delicious!  Thanks Robongi for making my first outdoor dining experience this season a lovely one.
2016-05-06,4,This is a SOLID 4 star sushi spot.BYO, so don't forget to stop and get some Sake and beer.Their outdoor seating is among other Washington St restaurants. It can be noisy on Friday night or on weekends.Inside is nice and quiet until around 8PM. They play pretty loud music in the evening. Not a deal breaker, but be prepared to speak up during conversation.The food is on par with the price. Fresh and well prepared. All the usual sushi classics are available.This is currently our go-to sushi delivery in Hoboken.
2016-04-30,1,The driver asked for more tip than what I put on seamless on his way to my place, otherwise he said he was not gonna deliver my order coz it's too "far", and this happened half an hour AFTER I ordered. RIDICULOUS.
2016-04-20,4,I have been here several times and I tend to get either a bento box, teriyaki, or some tame sushi rolls as I am not the most adventurous when it comes to seafood. Everything I have had here has always been good and the service is good. The prices are actually pretty reasonable for Hoboken especially for the amount of food you get in one of the boxes. Furthermore it is BYOB!
2016-03-19,5,The staff are very engaging and attentive. We came in for a late lunch hour and we received very fast service. The food was brought out with excellent timing. The seating was comfortable and surprisingly roomy for the space. It's BYOB and the staff are fast to open your wine. Great lighting and atmosphere. We got crab cake and edemame as an appetizer. The crab cake is expensive at $9 for one patty-size cake, but well worth it! The meat was delicious and paired wonderfully with the sauce. The edemame is the perfect table app which everyone likes.We got 3 bento box lunches and 1 sushi roll combo. Great value here and left feeling good, not overstuffed or weighed down.
2016-02-29,4,Robongi is my go-to sushi place in Hoboken. If you've read my past reviews, you'll know that I'm loyal to Moshi Moshi in Waldwick, NJ, so I can't quite give Robongi 5 stars because... it's not Moshi, basically.Robongi is my sushi place away from home. The quality is always superb, the special rolls are unique, delivery is quick, and service is courteous. I also got non-sushi here for the first time today (beef udon stir fry), and it was surprisingly super delicious and well cooked! I wasn't expecting such yummy tasting "food" food, so this just got them more points in my book. They always honor my quirky requests of rolls with "no rice" and don't make me feel crazy for asking for those things (girls gotta diet!!). They have a loyal customer in me!
2016-02-23,2,I had good experiences in the past and this was not. Ordered through Seamless, I asked for white fish for my sashimi box and 6/9 pieces were salmon and tuna. No good parts either. Didn't feel fresh. Salmon skin is usually fried, I expected it to be crispy and without bones but it was not cleaned well, too rough to chew. Spicy yellow tail was in a tataki form (tartare and I was unable to feel the chewiness of the fish) with spicy mayo and some fried crunchy pieces. Unagi didn't feel fresh in the roll.
2016-02-12,1,Had 3 rolls delivered, and they were all smashed in a big mess, and looked horrible, never again.
2016-01-22,4,Stopped by a couple of weeks ago for some take out.  First time ever trying their menu.   I was very happy with the extensive menu.  The sushi was very fresh and tasty.  Had a couple of different rolls, including one of Signature Soy Rolls, the Pacific.  It was excellent.  Will definitely be back.  The staff were  happy and helpful and were more than happy to share their selections.  It is a BYOB and next time I'm going to dine in.
2015-12-29,3,I had dinner here outside last summer. The service was good and the sushi was decent. Also, ordered a salad with Ginger dressing. Not cheap but not overly pricy either. I would come back again but there are definitely other restaurants in Hoboken that I would like to check out as well.In nice weather they do sit outside as well and you will have a view of Washington Avenue.
2015-12-16,1,Ordered here for several years and the sushi was good, by non-NYC standards. However lately it has gone downhill quickly. Delivery took over an hour, the fish was definitely not fresh at all- fishy tasting tuna, stringy octopus, and inedible yellowtail in my sashimi. The miso soup so very watered down. Totally disappointed and I think it's time to order from another restaurant in Hoboken.
2015-12-11,5,Hands down my favorite sushi spot in the area. Casual, not fancy, BYOB STYLE, but the customer service is always on point and the sushi is always fresh. Had many great times here. They always greet you with a smile and welcome you back as if they have known you for years. A must try if your a sushi-nista like myself. A small gem that any true foodie would appreciate.
2015-11-28,3,Joe's crab shack feel and Michael Bolton singing on the background.... Will continue review when meal comes.
2015-11-18,4,Tried this place yesterday as take-out but I picked it up, and I must say the place is really eccentrically decorated, and it was fun. And as soon as I walked in I was warmly greeted, and given my order correctly.I ordered a side of spicy mayo, and I was kind of afraid to try it because it wasn't smoothly blended like the rest of the places I've gotten it from, but it was actually delicious, and so were their rolls! I was so happy. I feel like it is always such a scary thing to try new Sushi places, because you are just hoping that they don't get you sick, but everything tasted really fresh. Nothing felt oily or soggy. I would definitely order from this place again!!
2015-11-11,5,Yes - the decor is camp and the music matched, but this made it more fun for me. The service was friendly and quick, and the food was also good. After way too much deep fried food on my holiday, I needed something fresh to counter it all. The sushi and sashimi was freshly made and used good quality ingredients, and the chicken teriyaki was fresh and not deep fried or overly sweet and swimming in too much sauce. The other Japanese place a couple of doors down looked like a more sedate option in terms of decor, but I would come here again!
2015-10-10,1,Good food but don't order delivery. They couldn't find my house after 5 separate phone calls with the driver and the store. Apparently living about 8 blocks away from the resturant in an 18 unit condo building was too difficult.
2015-09-28,5,Really enjoyed their bento box! Very well balanced yakisoba, good sushi and a great vibe altogether. The servers and manager/owner were very friendly. Favorite sushi place in Hoboken. Would totally visit again!
2015-09-24,5,Came here for a friend's birthday and didn't know what to expect.We started with a tuna tartare appetizer. This was amazing- we couldn't get enough of it!Our main course was two boats and everything on them was awesome. The roll with the avocado was by far my favorite! I'm getting hungry thinking about it. We also had some beef dish that I don't remember the name of.Service was awesome - Ron helped our large party and was amazing every step of the way. Just a quick glance in his direction and he jumped to be of assistance. The BYOB is of course the best part of this place. We went through a LOT of wine and of course we had to do a round of Saki bombs (don't break Ron's table!)I hope I get invited back here - I can't wait to come again! Very easy to get to from Manhattan. Path to Hoboken + ~10 minute walk.
2015-09-22,1,Mediocre fish. Nice presentation however I ordered the sashimi Deluxe and while I wasn't at a loss for portion the fish quality itself was less that good. Fish was stringy and needed a knife to cut.
2015-09-07,3,Great food and a cheeky atmosphere with BYOB that makes for a nice night out.Beware: they charged us $1 for a tiny amount of Sriracha and $1 for a tiny amount of eel sauce (since the roll advertised eel sauce and came with a couple specks of it), and they did NOT warn us about the charge. We found out when the bill came...not cool people! Pros:1. Sushi is fresh and tasty, we like the Iso Roll and the Salmon Sashimi the best, but all of their rolls are interesting and tasty, and there's a lot to try.  Oyaku donburi is also a lot of food, very filling, and tasty.  Their gyoza (we go steamed to think we are being healthy as we gorge on pork filled goodness) are also yummy.  We tried the spring roll the other day, and it was greasy deep fried goodness, but wasn't too special so we would probably not get that again.2. Service is adequate for Hoboken, you don't really get one waiter, they all kind of pitch in, so you just grab someone close and tell them what you need.3. Pricing isn't awful.4. BYOB is great, but on every page of the menu there is a "warning" that basically says there is a $25 per person minimum if you BYOB, which is kind of steep.  We always spend more than that, so we don't know if they actually charge someone $25 if they came in for lunch with a bottle of wine and only spent $18 a person as an example, but that's a bit odd.5. Good outdoor seating in the nice weather.Cons:1. Decor is cheeky/kitchy at best, you feel like you are in an amusement park ride or a really bad beach/lake setting.2. The BYOB $25/pp minimum might be a really bad surprise at the end of the meal, not sure if they actually enforce that or not.3. Restrooms are unisex, so therefore dirty (don't mind as a guy, but the girls might).
2015-09-06,4,Robongi sushi uses high quality ingredients and the flavors are absolutely fantastic. I was first introduced to a shittake mushroom roll at Robongi and it has been an honorable mention of mine ever since. They also have amazing mouth watering avocado rolls, and cucumber rolls that can no longer exit my mind because I immediately want to come here and eat the whole restaurant. Overall this is an extremely tasty sushi spot worthy of trying out. They carry some of the best vegetarian rolls in Hoboken hands down!
2015-08-17,2,Good sushi and price point but unfortunately will NEVER be ordering from here again. The delivery guy argued with how much tip I gave him (after he took over an hour) and then tried to bully me into changing the tip amount. I called the restaurant to tell them about his behavior and all I got was a really weak "sorry." No thanks. Keep your sushi and horrifying service.
2015-08-16,4,This is one of the better places in Hoboken for sushi.  Quality is consistent and you are not taking a gamble.  The servers are nice.My favorite is the sashimi lunch special or just their sashimi in general. The fish is always fresh.  I'm not a huge fan of having to scream during meals because of loud music.  Some nights it becomes pregame central at robongi. Overall it's a solid place for sushi in Hoboken.
2015-08-10,1,Every time when I get my orders always mistake.customer service are terrible. Every time I order on phone,I need to repeat my number more than 3 times so my orders.....I don't know how they hiring people who can't speak English and taking the orders. Is anybody can speak English in the restaurant?????????? ????????????       This place are going down to hell since Ivan gone.....
2015-07-26,3,Solid sushi. Pretty good service. Priced perfectly. Most definitely will eat here again.
2015-07-14,5,This place is one of the best Japanese places in the area. I've tried em all.... Try the oyaku Don ! Super good.
2015-07-11,4,The sushi at Robongi is good - always fresh, and the staff is friendly.  It's also in such a convenient area on Washington.  The decore is really cute and you feel like you can relax.
2015-07-09,5,This is a great local sushi spot.  I have NEVER had a bad meal here.  LOVE this place.  The weekends are a fun lively atmosphere and during the week it is a little more chill.  either way great prices for great sushi.
2015-06-01,5,First off I don't give out 5 stars normally but this place is totally with it.  I order delivery frequently..their specialty rolls are amazing, the rice is cooked perfectly and there's not too much, the rolls melt in your mouth and the fish is fresh and does not have that fishy taste..last night I ordered the wrong thing and they brought me what I meant to order, customer service was great
2015-05-27,2,I had one of Donburis. The taste was totally different from what I have experienced of Donburi. Too sweet with too much sesame! I felt like I was eating Chinese food.
2015-05-24,5,Robongi is the only place in Hoboken I order sushi from. The delivery guys are always so nice and it's usually pretty quick. We've been coming and ordering out from here for about 8 years now and haven't had a bad experience except for one time when a roll that we ordered because it specifically had avocados in it didn't come with avocados. But it was quickly fixed. Highly recommend the calamari roll, sakura roll, spicy tuna salad.
2015-05-15,5,Eat-in or take-out best Japanese in the area.  Everything is fresh.  The spider roll is a stand-out.  Service is quick and attentive and the place is casual and comfortable.  We like to take out-of-town visitors and they always enjoy it.  Can get alittle loud at times, but not unbearable.  Prices are reasonable besides being a BYOB.  Enjoy!
2015-05-12,4,This place is Fun. BYOB, great for groups but there will be a long wait.  The place is small.  Menu is great, everyone will find something to eat.
2015-05-12,3,food is good but if you're getting takeout make sure to check if your order is complete. brought home shrimp tempura sans the dipping sauce.
2015-04-30,5,I've been coming here since 2006. Delicious sushi and such a fun atmosphere. Highly recommend the ISO roll. The service is always consistently excellent, even on a thurs/fri/sat evening when it's super busy. Even if you have to wait a bit, it's BYOB so you can sip while you wait for a table!
2015-04-24,1,WARNING! HEED AND READ!Their delivery people are extremely rude. On multiple occasions the same delivery man "shamed" my wife for not giving him a bigger tip! I phoned the manager and let know how outraged I was. I told them I would NOT be doing business and order from Robongi ever again.Not only was there no apology, the manager wanted me to get off the phone so fast that he immediately asked for my phone so he could remove me from their system. Never mind the fact I didn't get an apology, nor a reassurance it would never happen again. This is the sate of customer service in this country. SO long as business is doing well, screw the complaints. But you know what? Social media does have an impact. And Robongi's reputation with in the end suffer.
2015-04-16,5,BYOB with delicious rolls and appetizers. We got the veggie gyoza (pan fried) and Han hibachi app (so good), then the Godzilla, satura & crazy horse rolls and all were delicious. Decor was funky - reminded me of Old Gregg. But kinda funny. Overall great spot for BYOB sushi!
2015-04-10,4,I've only gotten delivery, but I like this place a lot.  It replaced Illuzion for me as my delivery sushi joint.  I usually get rolls, but I have gotten other sushi, always been good.  Fast delivery too.
2015-03-27,2,2.5 really.  the host was worth the extra half a star.  It was so loud that the Mrs. and I had to ask for earplugs.  Of course with it being so loud they couldn't understand us.  Our soups came out luke warm and our fish tasted like chicken.  Not good.  We are avid restauranteurs and had been around the block a few times(usually between meals!).  But we have consistently had not so brisk service and would only go back if we needed to ask for directions to a good sushi place or if someone wow'd us with a stellar review, convincing us to return.  Anyhow, not awful but not the most magical sushi experience the old ball and chain and I have experienced.
2015-03-08,5,I love this place. it's always fun, and they're always so quick with take out. very accommodating for large groups. the sex on the beach roll is my favorite.
2015-03-08,4,Although I don't order from here very often, I like it a lot.1) The food is usually pretty on point, especially the sushi. My first time there, I was so impressed by how fresh, thick, and tasty the sushi was that I forever compare future tuna rolls to that day. And BYOB!2) The staff is pretty nice and friendly. Usually have a good amount of small talk w the hosts and servers.3) The decor is like Japan meets pirate ship. A lot of wooden fish, nets, paddles, etc in addition to japanese art and pieces. It's a little too dark for me in the restaurant at night, but not bad for a romantic date. Or maybe someone who's face you're not crazy about.4) I've never had to wait for a table, but I have noticed it gets very busy at night. So plan to go during the day, early evening, or to go. In the summer, there's also outdoor seating!5) It's a bit pricey to me, but reasonable for the quality.Of course, there's generally only metered street parking and very competitive, but that's pretty standard for Hoboken.
2015-03-07,2,I am giving it 2 stars for the food (which is OK but good for Hoboken).  But the delivery on a busy night SUCKS.  They said it would be 45 mins.  Well, it was 1.5 hrs!  Each time I called to say I will cancel if its going to be a while longer, "he is already on his way".  Plus I found out they hold your delivery until there are multiple orders from a similar building/area.  Nice...
2015-02-24,4,Came on a Saturday night with brother and others. I've been here before and it keeps me coming back for more. Let's start with the ambiance. For me personally, I love it. Yes it's a bit loud, but I don't mind it. Good music and the people enjoy it.The sushi is great. I love the apps and they have a great variety of rolls to pick from.BYOB as well so enjoy the party!!!
2015-02-23,3,3.5 stars. Nabeyaki Udon. (Chicken, Egg, Vegetable & Shrimp Tempura). There are only three pieces of Chicken.... I want to cry... The rolls tasted ok.  5:00 pm, no wait. Time saver.
2015-02-13,2,Food is inconsistent and wait time is always a guess.  I do say when they are "on" - their quality is pretty good.My greatest concern is inconsistency - in the restaurant and delivery. I ordered delivery from here a few times (knowing what to expect) and sometimes they say they can deliver and times like last night- they say i am out of their area ( i live in jersey city).  In summation- if you catch them on a good day, great! If not, well, be ready for a frustrating experience.
2015-01-22,5,The best Sushi and Japanese restaurant in town. i don't know how they do it. My eel avocado roll is consistently warm and soft and the most tender thing you could imagine a sushi roll to be. I am in love with the sushi! Fun atmosphere and wonderful food here. Get the edamame to start, byob saki, and order the popcorn shrimp, garlic broccoli, salmon skin, and sushi rolls of your choice. A celebration of food. Heaven! Absolute Heaven. If I ever leave Hoboken, this is one of the things I will miss most.
2015-01-22,4,I came here on a Thursday, and had a great time. It is BYOB so everyone had their wine. They were attentive in opening the bottle, and made sure we had everything we needed..ice, napkins etc. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable, kind of like Japanese meets surfer dude. Makes for a cool mood. I had the avocado salad, which came with a generous portion and a cucumber avocado roll which was really good, perfect amt of rice. My date had the bento box which was huge, and green tea ice cream which  was deemed as delicious! We stayed a little while after our food talking and having fun and weren't bothered at all. I would definitely return
2015-01-17,1,I have been coming here for a few years. Last night, I ate something bad, woke up at 3 am and was sick for several hours. When I called the manager today to tell him, he dismissed me with, "Several other people ate here last night and nobody else got sick. I will put it in our file." No "I am sorry" or anything. Well, I am putting this in my file on Yelp...what a horrendous way to deal with a customer complaint!
2015-01-12,5,I consistently eat at 2 or 3 restaurants each week in Hoboken and Robongi is one of them. They are hands down the go-to for sushi. Service is always fantastic (and who doesn't love BYOB?) delivery is fast when I order out, and the sushi is consistently good. What more do you want in a good neighborhood sushi spot!?
2014-12-16,5,Fresh sushi and large portions, great service too!
2014-12-14,3,The sushi was really just ok, the fluke was not the best. Service was good and quick, byob is bonus. Resonably priced.
2014-12-07,4,Delicious sushi in hearty portions at not too expensive prices.  This place rocks!
2014-12-06,2,I loved Robongi, but recently it seems like the quality of both their food and service has declined significantly. The drivers refuse to come upstairs to deliver food, making me come outside to get it when I'm already locked into the large tip that I gave (on seamless) to try to induce them to walk up to my apartment door. It also seems like they are using poorer quality fish recently, which troubles me more than the terrible delivery people. The salmon avocado rolls seem to have more fat than fish, and the avocado is brown. I've felt sick the past 3 times I've ordered from here and thought it was a coincidence before, but now I think I'm going to find a new sushi place. Too bad, because this used to be my favorite delivery place!
2014-11-19,5,This is one of my favorite spots for sushi.  The staff is so helpful and sweet.  I love the sushi, but I mainly come here for the customer service.  The place has really interesting decorations, too.
2014-11-15,3,If you are a newbie to Japanese this place is fine.  I was shocked that we were not offered a hot towel or warm towelette when we sat down. The Miso soup was fine. The pickles were not good nor worth the price for the quantity. The soba with chef special sauce was good. The Black Window and Iso rolls were very good. Then we were served a check without asking if we wanted to see a dessert menu. I actually wanted to order dessert for the first time in forever so this was so funny. Then i ordered the banana tempura but they didnt have it. Its such an easy thing so that was surprising. So i asked to see a normal menu and got pork gyoza. They served us forks next. Why would I want a fork at a japanese restaurant? For a newbie this would be fine but its not acceptable to do this unless asked. We were in Japan less than 6 months ago and besides, this would never happen in nyc. I ordered the japanese pickles- which is atypical for white diners and indicates that I am pretty familiar with the cuisine. Well anyway, Gyoza was average so the ending of the meal was a let down. All in all it's fine but certainly not more than 3 stars.
2014-11-06,5,It is raining and cold today. So we decided to order food delivery to our office instead going out for lunch. We ordered teriyaki lunch boxes from Robongi through Seamless. The food arrived on time and still warm. It was definitely the best delivered food I have ever had! The portion is huge! Everything taste really good! For $10, i got salmon, 3 gyoza, 3 pcs california, big box of soup, salad. I couldn't eat the rice because I was so full with all the food. So I packed the rice home because the rice is clearly high quality, it would be shame to throw untouched rice away. I will definitely order from it again in a rainy day. It is indeed as good as it gets! :)
2014-11-02,4,Byob and freshest sashimi and bikini specialty roll. All of their rolls were fresh and delicious and our waiter was very attentive, constantly filling up our wine glasses for us when it was almost empty. Great vibe on a Saturday night. Best sushi I've tried in Nj this far.
2014-10-27,5,I absolutely love this place. Whenever I think about sushi I think about robonji. They have the freshest, best, tastiest sushi I have had yet! The service is excellent. Sometimes you may feel a little rushed but only because there's a million people waiting to eat. The wait is never very long though. Probably because the service is so quick. The host has always been so nice and has always made my wait worth it. Sometimes he even brings me and my friends water and edamame if he thinks we are waiting too long. I highly recommend this place.
2014-10-26,4,ROBONGI is my favorite sushi place in all of NJ!  They have the best rolls and they are always fresh.  My favorites are the American dream roll and the Obsess roll but I've tried almost all the rolls and they are all pretty much great.  Also if you want a teriyaki dish the Beef teriyaki is banging!  The service is usually good and the servers are personable and friendly, but I miss the old manager Ivan who was an excellent manager and host.  Not sure what happened to him, but it's definitely not the same there without him.  He really added to the vibe of the place and showed great appreciation for his customers.  The only reason I am giving Robongi 4 instead of 5 stars is because he's no longer with Robongi!  Other than that definitely recommend!
2014-10-22,4,Ordered delivery from this place despite the slightly high prices because I was really craving Japanese food. Gave this place to try and I was not disappointed at all! I had their Tempura Soba - it came with 3 shrimp tempura and several vegetable tempura pieces. The broth was yummy and it came with some vegetables in it. I added my soba noodles and my cravings were instantly satisfied! - except now I am craving more soba noodles as I type this. Anyway, I also had the Eel and Avocado Roll and that was okay.. it was decent quality sushi.I would eat at this place again, just not often. Delivery did take a while, but it's okay. The prices are just pretty high. I can get similar quality sushi for cheaper in NYC!
2014-10-15,5,This place is great! I especially love the sushi and sashimi lunch special; its a great value for the quality and quantity. I have also tried the sashimi dinner entrees and each time it has been consistent in quality.
2014-10-13,1,The food is usually good, but service has gone downhill lately.  Delivery is probably the worst in Hoboken.  Twice now I've had to wait over 1-1/2 hours.  I call them after an hour and they say that the food will be there in a couple of minutes, out for delivery.  call back in 30 minutes and they say the same thing.  So the food is out in the drivers car for at least 40 minutes.  Raw fish should not sit out for that long, they should be inspected for food safety.
2014-09-21,4,In typical white girl fashion, OMIGOD I LOVE SUSHI.I've gotten takeout from here a few times, but I came here on a date last night, and surprisingly, we were seated right away. After mulling the menu, we decided on tuna naruto, tuna avocado, Philadelphia and sweet potato rolls, and edamame and a salad to start.The food came out super quickly and everything was really delicious, it's byob too, so that's always nice. The only thing is the music was realllly loud at like 8...I love house music, but I don't really want to hear a heavy bass line while eating my sashimi.Overall, a solid choice. The decor is cute too!
2014-09-20,3,This place is a solid 3.5I've come here a bunch of times over the years, and they never disappoint. On the weekends, there will be a wait.The place is quite small so you will be jammed in there.BYOB which is always nice.I always get the sushi, and its always pretty good.The Iso roll is yummy!Service is pretty quick.
2014-08-27,4,Delis delis delis!!! You can bring your own bottle they don't sell wine. I had a great time eating the garlic grill action, edame, And April mist!!! Hoboken is my new hangout spot
2014-08-21,3,Robongi is a good choice if you want asian food/ sushi in hoboken. It's not amazing but its not bad. A little on the higher priced side for the quality but there arent tons of options in hoboken. I got a salmon teriyaki bento box. Its the most "bang for your buck" entree they have. It comes with the entree, rice, shrimp & veggie tempura, 3 shumai, a 6 piece sushi roll AND, soup or salad. The salmon teriyaki was okay, it had a big piece of skin attached which isnt my thing. Robongi is BYOB so it's a good choice if you're in the mood to shell out for sushi and drown in cheap wine. Illuzion is still my favorite asian place in hoboken!
2014-08-06,1,First time I'm writing a review as it was that bad, ordered Sushi from here the order was been incorrect, they don't listen to orders refuse to change the order, asked me for more money to fix the order, sushi looked like it was on a roller coaster ride and then he had the cheek to hang up on me. Never again, completely uncooperative and rude. Teak it is from now on.
2014-08-04,5,The service is always phenomenal every time I go to Robongi. The waiters are attentive, refill your drinks, bring your food quickly, and do it all with a smile. The food is fantastic, best sushi in Hoboken, hands down. I signed up for Yelp just so I could write this review. America.
2014-07-22,5,I have been going to Robongi since it opened. The best sushi place in Hoboken, period.
2014-07-15,5,Best sushi spot in Hoboken and it's BYOB has a nice decore great lighting never had a bad experience here
2014-07-05,4,Great sushi... great prices and the portions are good sized too! Def would recommend this place for Sushi in Hoboken.
2014-07-02,4,I would give their sushi and sashimi 5 stars (relatively for a place in NJ).  Best sushi and sashimi in Hoboken, one of the best I've had in NJ.  For the price and the size of the sushi/sashimi, I would say that Robongi is the Tomoe of Hoboken.  (My fellow sushi lovers know Tomoe.)  The rolls are great here too.    If you're a true sushi/sashimi lover, sit at the sushi bar.  ;o)We ordered the Sashimi Supreme, then ordered 4 pieces of King Salmon, and got some steamed veggies in garlic.   It all came out to be $60 with tip.  That's crazy...We are talking big pieces of fish.The other Japanese food is about a 3.5 out of 5 stars.  It's good, not great, not bad.  Service: They are very friendly and attentive and accomodating.  Also it's BYOB.  Overall, I'm giving this place a solid 4 stars overall.  If you're stuck in NJ looking to eat only sushi/sashimi/rolls, I give it 5 stars.If you're looking for Japanese food (tempera, udon, etc.), I give it 3.5 stars.
2014-06-23,4,My boyfriend and I sometimes stop by here for dinner or order take-out whenever we're at a loss on what to eat on a Saturday/Sunday evening. This past Saturday (06/21), we decided to eat an early dinner at Robongi's, because we knew the place wouldn't be jam-packed with club-hoppers at 5 PM. There is something about this restaurant on any given Friday or Saturday night, where you can't enjoy a nice sushi dinner in peace, because hordes of barely legal 20-somethings camp out here prior to their 8-hour long booze and schmoozefests. I don't get it. Can someone please solve the mystery for me? Anyway, the one thing I'm not too keen on here is the decor. For a sushi restaurant, I don't expect to see anything of the Krusty Krab variety hanging from the walls and ceilings. Also, the music tends to be a bit...off; mostly Top 20 hits from roughly 10-15 years ago. But at least it's low enough that you can hear yourself and your significant other talk during your meal, so that's something.What saves this place from an average or below-average rating is their food. I have never been disappointed in any of their sushi in all the times I've had take-out or eaten there in person. Saturday was no exception. I ordered the Unagi Don (broiled eel over a bed of rice, served with thin strips of sauteed seaweed), and I chose salad as my side dish, since it was a warm day. My boyfriend ordered the Tonkatsu (sic?) Don, which was white rice, pork, and sauteed vegetables. He had miso soup and a spicy yellowtail roll as his sides. I helped myself to a few pieces of the spicy yellowtail roll and thought the flavors balanced each other perfectly: sweet with a touch of spice, not too pungent, but enough of a kick to tickle your tastebuds. I loved the texture and flavor of my eel, and the portions were extremely generous.Our service was fine, if a bit over-attentive (but then, we were virtually the only ones inside, so there you go), but everyone who works there is very nice and polite. I just hope they do something about the Jersey shore souvenir-shop decor.
2014-06-18,3,Went here with wifey earlier this month.  Place was aiight.  It was decorated like a crab shack on a pier in Montauk or LBI.  We started with the Sashimi Deluxe.  It was fantastic.  The fish cuts were fresh, large, cold, and tasty.  We then got 3 special rolls.  They were terrible.  Mushy fish.  Too spicy.  One eel roll was hot and cooked (something that neither of us would ever order).  Not sure how that happened.  Place is pricey too, as sushi should be.  It was a fine meal, but nothing to rave about at all.
2014-06-18,5,I came here for the first time with a group of girl friends before a night of bar hopping and this is a fun and great little place. It gets really crowded, but the sushi was great, their red bean ice-cream was delicious. The service here was friendly and fun, it's not your average  quiet little sushi restaurant , there's party music playing and it' a all good energy. Oh and it's BYOB! I love this place, definitely going back soon
2014-06-03,3,I find Robongi to definitely be a 3.5 star place. The meal started off super strong in my book, but fizzled a bit through dinner and when the check came, it sort of got knocked down, but didn't get up again. (Any Chumbawamba fans out there?)First the place is pure kitsch. It's a bit small and not your typical sushi joint. It's more of the decor of a crab shack with wooden tables and crab shack signs and nets; fun, but just not authentic and not very formal. While everyone chose to eat outside, my man and I dined in. With that, the place could use a sprucing, the bathroom wasn't nice at all, if I drop a quick $80 on dinner, I could use some of the finer things of life.The sashimi deluxe was oh so buttery good. Really nice cuts of fresh fish (the usual suspects) that literally melted in your mouth. This got me pumped up for the rolls we just loaded up on. And that's where the meal fell flat ::womp womp::. The rolls were unimpressive. Three speciality rolls costing on the average $13-$14 should have me groaning with pleasure, these rolls just had me sigh. The eel roll was cooked. Either the waiter messed up our order or the menu plainly does not state that it is cooked and served warm, which we were not a fan of. The other 2 rolls were just ultimately not that great of combo's and quite tasteless (minus the immense spice from the jalapeno's and wasabi tobik0). We left some men behind on the plate, which I rarely do in the sushi world.When the bill came, I ultimately felt like I didn't quite get the value of delicious rolls and sashimi for the price paid. I'm not opposing to coming again, but definitely would rather try some other sushi spots before doing so.
2014-06-01,5,Best sushi I have had in a long time. Spicy mixes had chucks of fish with no filler, special rolls were topped with large pieces of fish. Fresh fish and excellent craftsmanship...sushi done right!
2014-05-29,4,Walked in and was confused cause I really wanted to order fried clams and a shrimp po boy.  The decor is a little odd for a sushi place.  Needless to say I was worried about the food I was going to get.  To my surprise the sushi did not reflect the deadliest catch decor!   The sushi was fresh and the lunch sushi protion was perfect. I don't visit Hoboken too often but if you crave good sushi this is the place to go.  Just don't expect to feel like your in a sushi place cause it like like you should be in cape cod eating fried clam strips!
2014-05-18,5,Best sushi in Hoboken! This restaurant never ceases to amaze me. The service is great, it's a fun atmosphere and the food is Wonderful!! Try the I-Mate, Godzilla and Sex on the Beach rolls and the rock shrimp app!!
2014-05-17,5,The sushi here is always fresh and excellent quality. The ambiance is really nice, dark and cozy. Delivery is super fast. And the people here are very friendly.
2014-05-09,1,These guys need a 101 course in packaging vegetarian food and the manager needs an attitude adjustment.
2014-05-06,3,Good food, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars because the delivery guy is RUDE. When they change the delivery man I will definitely order more often and give a 5 star. Due to his rudeness I did not tip him more than $4 dollars and he complained and did not leave my door untill he got better tips. argh!
2014-05-02,4,Good price, good sushi and fast service. Definitely number one or two Sushi place in Hoboken.
2014-04-27,4,I had a wonderful meal with my gf at Robongi. The place is dimly lit and has a nice ambiance. BYOB makes it even better. We shared a roll from the special rolls menu which was very interesting and fresh. It was four different flavors done individually as opposed to one long roll. For my entree I tried (first time) the noodle bowl Nebayaki with chicken and shrimp tempura on the side.  The flavorful broth brought all the ingredients together-outstanding. I want to have it again. This will be my new favorite Japanese restaurant in Hoboken.
2014-04-22,4,I'm revising my review of this place because they have really stepped up their sushi game over the past few years.  Been here twice in the last few weeks and had excellent experiences both times.  Their rolls are much more substantial than they used to be and the fish is super fresh.  Some of my favorites include the Godzilla, Sakura, and Crazy Horse, They have some excellent special rolls for under $10, which is almost unheard of in this town.  But they also have a number of special rolls in the 14.50-16.50 range which is kind of pricey.  The service is second to none and the nautical-themed deÃÅcor is fun but still a little cheesey.  Given the improvements in their sushi, I would now recommend this place for sushi delivery/takeout as well as a casual and fun night with friends.
2014-04-17,4,Great place! Love the BYOB, attentive staff and portions. Can't wait to go back.
2014-03-27,3,My go-to sushi spot. Fish is always fresh and delicious. Would give 4 stars, but their delivery is really, really spotty. Sometimes its 15 mins, sometimes its nearly an hour and a half, with no rhyme or reason. If it were Friday night at 8pm, I'd understand. But on a random Tuesday, its inexcusable. Always great at the restaurant. They'll even find you some sake if you ask nicely.
2014-03-23,4,Best sushi in Hoboken . Not the level of  high end sushi in the city, but definitely good quality sushi at decent price.  We mostly order in from here,.
2014-03-14,1,It was totally a disaster!!! I ordered a food delivery today, and it took over 3hrs to arrive. Notice that, the restaurant is in Hoboken and I'm in Jersey City, only 2mi away. And it took 3 HOURS! Finally I cancel the delivery cuz it's toooooo slow. And then the delivery driver became mad at me. He yelled at me with some really bad words. I am a customer who has been waiting 3hrs for food, and he is the guy to get mad?! That's too hilarious and it's way beyond my tolerance. I have to rate it one star. And I would rate it minus 100 stars if Yelp has that option!!!
2014-03-11,4,Ordered lunch from here, so naturally, I gravitated toward the lunch specials - it came with two rolls with a soup and salad. I was skeptical in choosing the spicy tuna rolls as most places have spicy tuna that is unrecognizable. Just a pink mush. Robongi's spicy tuna was chunky, an indication of chopped tuna mixed with spicy mayo - always better than tuna mash. I also ordered a tuna avocado hand roll which was fresh and delicious.Will be ordering lunch specials from here more often. The best part? $10 delivery minimum and free delivery. That, of course, was incentive to tip even more.
2014-03-07,1,Waited 1.5 hr for delivery and when i called to ask why i hadn't yet received my order all the recpetionist could say was "it's on its way" and hung up. Unacceptable. Will never order from here again.
2014-03-07,1,I'd love to tell you how great the sushi was. Unfortunately, the delivery never arrived and the woman on the phone was not helpful.  She put me on hold so she could "call the driver", then clicked back on the line to say, Robongi may I help you?....Yes...I'm waiting for you to call the driver because it's been 90 minutes?  "Then she asked me for my phone number 12 times. And reassured me 12 more times that the driver was on his way.  Spoiler alert: the driver was not on his way.
2014-03-06,2,I do NOT like to give bad reviews. I tried Robongi for the first time on St Pattys Day last weekend and was thoroughly impressed. Everyone was friendly, the food was priced great and everything tasted excellent. I took my friend back earlier this week and again, the food was excellent but I had a less than pleasurable experience with the young man who was filling waters and pouring wine. (Our waiter was GREAT by the way) So, we sit down and I see two noticeably different wine glasses and as the young man started to pour in one of the glasses, I politely asked if we could have matching glasses. I may have even jokingly said "Ran out of glasses?" He seemed not to hear me, so I asked again. He stopped mid pour and said he would check. Not even a minute later he brought the match to my friend's glass and I smiled and thanked him. Then he walked away, stood aside and looked at me with disdain.I am very intuitive. I could tell he had an attitude because I asked for matching glasses. A few minutes later he came to the tables to the left and right of us and filled everyone's glass BUT mine. I ended up pouring my own wine after realizing he was refusing to deal with me. He came back some time later and filled my friend's glass with water and REFUSED to fill mine. Horrible. Now, aside from his blatant, sour attitude, we had a great time.Today, I decided to have food delivered to my office, for me only. My food was about $28 and they charged $1.00 per eel sauce, so $30 was my end total. Now, the restaurant is about 4 blocks from me and the food came rather quickly so I was pleased, initially. I think I was a little thrown off by the charge for eel sauce, so I hesitated reviewing the cost. Eventually I wrote in a 2$ tip. Now, I always struggle with tipping etiquette for delivery. I hear so many different things, and I am still learning the culture honestly. I tip 18-20% at a sit down restaurant and really don't get delivery a lot at all. Maybe I should have given 3$ or 4$?? Anyway, when I gave the receipt back the delivery guy pointed at the receipt and said "2$". I looked at him and said "I'm sorry. I don't understand what you're trying to say" and he waved me off, let out a deep sigh and said "Shit" as he walked out of my office. I was so disgusted and offended. Regardless of the tip, his attitude was unnecessary and extremely rude! Then, I get to my sushi and it had spicy mayo on it which was NOT mentioned on the menu for this particular roll. I despise spicy food. Total bummer and I refused to call for them to correct it because of the delivery guy's nasty attitude. Bottom line, the food rocks. I have experienced great service and warmth from MOST of the staff but the issues with the two I encountered left a sour taste in my mouth and I am a service oriented person. After these two experiences, I may not go back.
2014-02-26,5,Hands down the best sushi in Hoboken. Always, always, always freshest quality fish. The staff are friendly and competent and the restaurant itself is very clean. It's BYOB, which is nice, and the prices are reasonable. I recommend this place over any of the zillion other sushi joints in Hoboken.
2014-02-23,4,This restaurant is unlike any other sushi restaurant. I have been here a few times with  friends and always have a great time! If you come here during a Friday or Saturday night, it is like walking into a club. Filled with 20-30 somethings, dark lights, music bumping. It's BYOB but instead of your usual bottle of wine people are pounding Saki shots. The food is fresh and reasonably priced, but you come to Robongi to enjoy the high energy atmosphere. I would not recommend this restaurant for a couple's date night. This is a place you come with a good group of friends before a night out.
2014-02-23,4,Really good sushi (got the spicy california roll, alaska roll, rainbow and peanut avocado roll, and they have a lot of different sushi choices to choose from!)- and the atmosphere/decor is fun.  The servers here are very good,  we didn't have to wait for anything and they would always refill our drinks/water without us having to ask. Like the other reviews point out, it's BYOB
2014-02-20,5,Love love love Robongi.  Sushi is awesome, atmosphere is so fun.  BYOB is obviously great too.My only complaint is that our reservation was at 9:30pm and they sat us at 10:15.  Not their fault though, everyone was drinking and having a good time way after they were finished their meal.  The waiting area is also reaaaally small.  I was super annoyed by all of the people coming in and out (I'm also a bit clausterphobic) However my drink tasted much better after being stuck in there :)
2014-02-07,1,We ordered from Robongi and our order arrived 1 hour and 45 minutes after the order was originally placed. We have ordered a few times from Robongi and to be honest the quality of their food has dropped since they came on the scene  and were winning rave reviews back in 2007. After going to some amazing sushi joints in NY and LA,  their food is just bla. Wont be going back. It's the third late shitty order and this one was the absolute last. Not happy!
2014-02-05,5,Hands down my favorite sushi restaurant.  The fish is extremely fresh and tender.  My husband and I have been dining here since we moved to Hoboken in 2008.  We generally eat here about once a week.  It is one of our top 3 go to restaurants in Hoboken.Everything on the menu is delicious.  We love the edamame (nicely salted).  The miso soup is the best we've ever had.  The shumai is nicely steamed.  The sushi rolls are great.  I like the California Roll, Salmon Roll, and Boston Rolls.  My husband loves the Spicy Tuna, California Roll, and Boston Roll.We also like to dine here for lunch whenever we can.  They have a great deal for lunch (until 3pm including weekends!).  Two sushi rolls with soup or salad for around $10, or a bento box with soup, salad, 3 pieces Cali roll, rice, dumplings, and your entree (teriyaki or yakisoba) for about the same price.  You can't beat that!The staff is great.  They all know us and greet us whenever we dine here.  They are also extremely accommodating. My husband and I even had our Dress Rehearsal Dinner before our wedding here, seating about 20+ people on a Friday evening.
2014-02-02,3,Prices are decent! They have a nice lunch special. I'm a sashimi lover so it's important to me that the quality of the fish is really good. The sashimi was ok/ good. Definitely not the best but not the worst either. Staff and atmosphere is nice. I may come back for a quick lunch in the future but not for a gastronomic experience.
2014-01-25,1,Average sushi at best... Terrible service, gave us a cold version of their "warm chocolate lava cake" so we asked them to warm it up, got it back with the top melted but the inside still frozen and when we asked what was up with it, the server got pissed and said "u don't want it? We take away.. You want it, you eat!" Incredibly rude!!! So they took it away. Then they gave us the bill which was $3 more than we should've been charged, and we had to dispute this again... Uggghhhhh... I hate writing bad reviews! I really do... But I do it for the people!!... Anyways they changed the bill and we went on out way. With all the other sushi spots they have in Hoboken, I doubt I'd ever come back here again.
2014-01-22,1,OVERPRICED and terrible customer service! i accidentally ordered 3 orders of something and when i called immediately to make the change - they refused! sucks for them. i order sushi ALOT and will not be ordering again.
2014-01-06,5,Hands down, best sushi place in Hoboken. Generous portions, fresh fish, and speedy delivery. I usually do takeout because the vibe at the restaurant is oddly like a fisherman club. $4.75 for a salmon avocado roll that is packed with fresh, delicious salmon is amazing. Several people I know are regulars here and anyone from outside the area who I've taken here asks to come again.
2014-01-05,5,If you're looking for a wonderfully priced lunch menu, Robongi is your place! The chicken teriyaki lunch box is one of my favorties and comes with the perfect amount of food. It's BYOB which makes it even better, the service is great and there is always someone to give a warm welcome when you walk in.
2013-12-26,4,When you first pass this place you would not have any idea what kind of shore it is.  The windows are completely covered.  You would think something fishy is going on.  Get it, fishy?Once you walk inside, you will see a ton of discolorations, and their theme is the ocean.  It make sense since they sell mostly seafood and in the form of sushi.  Not good news for someone who is allergic to seafood like myself but I solider on.You can tell the staff here is not Japanese but in fact Chinese.  Well you can say that for most places.  This place doesn't greet you when you walk in, in Japanese.  The staff speak Fujianese.I got the Katsu Don, but I was really in the mood for Katsu Curry.  However I didn't find any curry dishes on their menu.  The meal was pretty large and cost $7.50 for their lunch special.  The lunch special also came with miso soup or a salad.  The soup was really bad in my opinion but I dislike miso soup to begin with so you can give it a shot yourself.  The Katsu Don was okay but not particularly good.The staff did a pretty good job on therms of service.  The waitress refill our waters and tea pretty timely.  When I drop my chopstick, I was quickly given another one without asking.There was also free edamame which was really good.  I like the salt they on the skin.However this place is really dark.  After we left, all our eyes had to adjust to the sun again and we describe the experience as if we just came out of a cave.
2013-12-11,1,This place is terrible and here's why:1. Order took 90 minutes. 2. Phone operator did not seem to care about the order taking a long time. 3. Sushi driver threw his tip back in our faces. 4. Sushi was disgusting and not fresh. Not sure what these other reviews are but this place is absolute trash.
2013-12-10,4,I'm a take out queen. Ii work too much to sit down, so sometimes I feel guilty reviewing without sitting down. However, there are more of me out there!I like this place. The lunch combo is delicious. The salmon avocado and tuna avocado are always fresh and the rice is always perfect...not too dry, not mushy, and the best proportion I h ave had in a while...just enough to support the tast of the fish.The lunch teriyaki is delicious as well...I h ave tried the tofu and salmon. The tofu is nice because is is soft on the inside but definitely firm and slightly crisp on the outside, which enhances the flavor of the sauce.They are fast and friendly for take out.However, they are pricey...to replace a roll for the California roll in the bento box combo is $4.50...the roll itself costs $5...hmmalso, a side of giner which is free at any other place is $1.00Pricey, but good.
2013-11-26,3,What I like about Robongi is their manager who really cares about customers, talks to people, tries hard to accommodate everyone and knows the regulars.Everything else is Ok: food, service, cleanness.If you want to have a conversation without talking loud get a table outside. It gets noisy inside.They have average prices. Lunch menu is very reasonable. I was once charged full price for a lunch menu item; likely due to waiter's inexperience.  They promptly reprinted the bill.Sushi menu is simple, covers all typical selections for Hoboken. On a plus side, I haven't had any problems after eating at Robongi ;-) Maki combo is good value. So are the soups.To conclude: a safe choice on Washington St. You will get exactly what you paid for.
2013-11-22,1,DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!! As a regular customer going here every single week for the past year I have NEVER been treated so bad by a restaurant in my entire life.  Going here every week  with my husband not once have we ever been acknowledged that we are regulars, which is not okay but we let it go.  A few weeks ago the manager asked us to leave after an hour of dining because we were done with our meal, we left feeling disappointed that we would be asked to leave (literally the minute after we paid our check) after an hour when we come here literally every friday night for the past year. We walked in for dinner this evening at 750 with hesitation after they were so rude to us a few weeks ago and asked for a table for 2. The manager says you can eat here but we have a party of 30 people coming in at 9pm so you have to leave by then all the tables will be used. My husband and I rushed our meal and started to see that there was no party of 30 coming, new customers are being seated to the right and left of us. I asked customers to the right and left who were seated after us if they were told about about a party at 9pm and they both said no. We soon realized that they purposely told us this to get us out, we have never stayed in this restaurant more than an hour for dinner, usually in and out within 40 minutes. My husband nicely said "its 9pm where is the party of 30?" He said oh they cancelled. We said well advice to you from working in the restaurant business you should not tell your regular customers that they need to leave by certain time, you should welcome them and make them feel special. He started screaming at us in the restaurant in front of customers. Telling my husband "go F yourself, what are you going to do about it, calling him mental"  in front of customers.  We are good loyal customers who have NEVER experienced anything like this. My mouth was dropped the entire dinner realizing that the manager fully lied to us and made up a party coming that never existed to get us out of the restaurant within an hour. We will NEVER go back to this restaurant again, and watch closely how fast they try to get you in and out. And I have found hair in my food on numerous occasions here. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!  RUDE RUDE RUDE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!
2013-11-16,4,Good spot to grab some sushi on a Friday or Saturday night with friends before you go out. Sushi is some of the best in town. Gets packed really quick though.
2013-11-10,1,I checked out this joint last night with 4 friends.  My best friend was excited to come back here as she hadn't been in over a year.  She said it was her favorite sushi place in Hoboken.  When we got there, even though we were a group of 5 and it was crowded, they said they could seat us in 10 minutes.  Also, the music is blasting inside so you kind of feel like you are in a club.  Off to a great start (minus the music).  We went to the liquor store to pick up some wine since it is BYOB and came back.  We were seated and immediately helped.  We ordered some appetizers and they came out astonishingly fast.  I found the tempura to be undercooked and somewhat doughy.  Before we even finished the appetizers the sushi was already on the table.  Yes, quick service is great, but not when you are feeling rushed.  We got 6 rolls to split between a few people.  I only found one of the rolls to be satisfactory (the Naruto).  The rest were sloppy and fell apart.  The sushi seemed fairly fresh, so I can't complain about that.  However, one of my friends decided not to order sushi and got a rice bowl.  It was fairly large so she was working on it for a while and we were picking at it.  Although she still had some food left in her bowl, over 5 waiters tried to take it away over the course of about 2 minutes.  Talk about a hint.After we continue to tell them we are still working on it, we finally allow someone to take it away.  They bring us the check and I look at the clock and realize we haven't even been at the place for an hour.  We decide to finish some of our wine, since we brought a good amount with us.  As we are sitting enjoying a drink, they come to check on the bill.  We hadn't put the money in yet.  About a minute later, the host comes over and asks us to pay and leave.   He tells us there is a group in the front that has a reservation and is waiting for our table.  We were shocked.  He didn't even try to dance around the issue and just asked us to leave.  Needless to say, I will never come back here again.   Unappreciative, rude and ridiculous.
2013-10-14,2,Please understand when the yelp filter attacks this realize that this has nothing to do with the food. The food is good. I ordered from delivery.com. Ten minutes after I ordered I received a call from them saying, "hey you want spicy mayo sauce, that will be $2.15" i said "okay" and got the money out. When the guy came and i gave him the money and went inside to find that they did not give me the spicy mayo sauce. Needless to say I was upset because if you had the nerve to call me and tell me I owed more money at least get the order right. I called them to ask where it was and they said, "oh um sorry driver will bring it out to you" I said, " how long?" She says 30mins. So you want me to wait 30 more mins to eat my food. Thats unacceptable I said, " no, I am going to call delivery.com and they will talk to you. They called and managers didnt really care at all that they treated a customer like this and they said the spicy mayo sauce will be there in 30. I said tell them i do not want it and I want that money back. After a back and forth they are giving me the money back and its not about the money its awful customer service.
2013-09-24,3,2 stars for takeout and 4 for sit in. Volcano salad is explosive must try. Better arrangement of sushi on the menu when u come in rather than order online.
2013-09-23,3,I like this spot. There are so many sushi places in Hoboken, I go to this one because the the service is so friendly.
2013-09-21,3,Friday nights they're pretty packed. The vibe when I walked in was really strange. It's a Japanese restaurant with clubbing music on loud so you have to shout to talk. They have like netting, sea decor on the walls and also football flags. It was like they're trying to appeal to everyone, and it just wasnt working. The food - it was decent sushi. I couldn't really see my food though, and we kinda just wanted to eat and leave. It was too hard to talk to each other! Maybe it's only like that on weekends and Friday? I sure hope so.
2013-09-21,2,Four or five years ago, Robongi was my go to for sushi.  No question.Now?Well I probably won't go back.  I've heard good things from friends about the cooked food, but I'm not a big fan of hot Japanese dishes to begin with, so not a selling point.  The last couple times I've eaten here, once dining in & once ordering delivery, have really left me unimpressed & concerned.  The sushi shouldn't taste fishy.  (Sound silly?  Maybe you're not a fish person to begin with, but it shouldn't smell or taste "fishy."  Ever.)  There are a half dozen or so places in Hoboken with better sushi, at the same relative price, that are also BYO.  Note to Robongi: get it together.
2013-09-19,5,great sushi. first time I was here one year ago, now just remembered the place and took some friends that were visiting. the sushi is really good at this place and amazingly inexpensive.
2013-09-01,4,I came to this spot on a busy Saturday night. My two girlfriends and I were seated outside and the waiter accommodated us since we needed more room. This is a BYOB spot so make sure you pick up some wine or beer. The menu has a variety of sushi specialities. The service was good and we got our sushi in a decent amount of time, considering it was busy. Everything was fresh and tasteful (salmon avocado, california roll, shrimp tempura, and izo roll). We were told the outside area was closing so we either had to move inside or leave. We decided to move inside to finish our wine. But within a few minutes we were told we had 3 minutes. I felt a bit rushed  but I'm also understanding that the workers wanted to start cleaning to head out.But besides that I'll definitely be back possibly during their lunch hours.
2013-08-24,2,I order Gyoza as an appetizer and it was pretty delicious.The miso ramen however was really disappointing. Instead of miso, I received vegetable soup!  The soup came with carrots, broccoli, mushrooms and cabbage. The noodles tasted like instant noodles.  The heavy cabbage flavor of the broth made their "miso ramen" taste fake. I requested for pork belly and an egg to go along with it. They didn't have it. Very disappointing indeed.
2013-08-02,4,Really good and fresh food. Pretty noisy on Saturday night. By noisy, I mean too noisy to have a conversation. But food made up for it.
2013-07-31,4,I came here with a big group for a birthday dinner this past Saturday. I have to admit, I loved the decor of this place.  There were a lot of bright colors and club style music playing.  It made it a fun atmosphere.  This place is also a BYOB so we popped a couple bottles of wine with our meal.The menu was pretty extensive.  After looking through it two or three times, I decided to go with the edamame and miso soup to start.  They weren't anything to write home about but I did enjoy them.  For my main entree, I went with the Godzilla roll and the Obsess roll.  The Godzilla contained spicy yellowtail, jalapenÃÉos, black roe, crunch, salmon, white tuna, avocado, tuna.  It was awesome.  The Obsess roll contained spicy tuna, asparagus wrapped with yellowtail, salmon, eel, mango, avocado and tuna.  The Obsess roll was also very good.Overall, I really enjoyed Robongi.  I loved the atmosphere inside as well as the food.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.
2013-07-09,1,Stay away from this place!!!! I have a friend who is a Hoboken fireman...went to this place to do a fire inspection....they freaked out when they wanted to go downstairs in the basement....they said if you don't let us downstairs we will call the cops....they let them go downstairs....in the basment there were dozens of fish hanging from the ceiling....fish blood all over the floor and dozens of flies all over the place.....gross grosss don't go if you don't want to be in the bathroom all night....
2013-06-25,5,Amazing as always!! We have been coming here for over 5 years now and quality/service is always on point.  Wasabi shumai is a must and best beef negimaki around and all rolls/sushi is equally incredible.. Don't forget the fried green tea icecream if you have room leftover..
2013-06-08,4,Ok, perhaps I might had been a touch harsh in my original review of this place, and my long absence to give them a second shot. We returned tonight and had a simple dinner of the American Dream roll and the Paradise plate (2 pieces of salmon, tuna, eel, and yellowtail, and a Boston roll). The American Dream roll was really great. The spicy crap on top had only a touch of mayonnaise as compared to everywhere else, which kept it feeling light. All of the pieces were a good size... Not Illuzion huge, but certainly bigger than Sushi House. Illuzion is still my go to sushi place in Hoboken, but I think Robongi us now my number 2 ahead of Sushi House.
2013-06-01,4,Surprised to see the rather lukewarm reviews here.  I guess I'd have to dock a star and a half because I agree the cranking up for the music at a mere 7:30pm on  a Friday to a bit obnoxious since I had to shout at my bf across the street, but that's really more the residents of Hoboken's fault, not Robongi.  Yes the decor is a bit hokey with the nautical theme, and there is not great ventilation indoors...but food and service are just fine.  The server are (NOT) Japanese but they're all very polite and quick with the BYO.  They let BF and me drink the rest of our 6 pack even when our meal was over.  But, more importantly, the sushi is fresh- and the cuts are big...really all the portion sizes are big.  I ordered the sashimi appetizer which was plentiful, fresh and juicy- the best part was actually the white tuna pieces.  The, I got a special roll- the red dragon. It was tuna on the outside packed with asparagus and yellowtail.  I've had better but this was solid. Bf got the chicken teriyaki bento set , which came with pretty flavorful pieces of teriyaki (and I don't like teriyaki), a pile of rice, shumai (interesting shumai), tempura- shrimp and veg (WOW the panko crumbs were light and airy, major yum), and a tuna roll.   A good value for $21. All in all, came to $20 per person. If you're coming on a weekend after 7:30, make a reservation, it gets crowded.  We came at 7 and the place was still filling up.
2013-05-14,2,Yuck. If you want fresh fish, don't come here. If you want to actually enjoy dinner and the company you are with for more that 20 minutes, don't come here.Basically those sentences say it all. I went with two of my friends for dinner. Our soups came out in .2 minutes and after we ordered our actual dinner, that arrived in 3 minutes. NO JOKE.The fish wasn't fresh either. You know when sashimi/sushi has that slightly fishy aftertaste because it hasn't been refrigerated/handled properly? That's this place.Save your money-- go to Illuzion a little down the block. Much better, much fresher, and much cleaner.
2013-05-13,4,I have been to Robongi about half a dozen times so far as it has become my go to Sushi place in Hoboken. On first impression this place looked pretty cheesy with its seafood/fish/sailing decorations. Once you walk in the first thing you might notice is the music. The music and volume changes depending on the day and time, but most likely it is going to be dance music and the later you go there, the louder it is going to get. I feel like its some sort of a pre-gaming ritual to prepare you for a night out, or maybe it's their way of getting you out of there quickly. The one time the music was relaxing when I was there on a Sunday evening so it might be worth a try to check it out then.As for the food itself, the fish is always fresh and the rolls are tasty, I have mostly been getting the sweet potato rolls, salmon avocado roll or dragon roll with salmon instead of eel and all have been great, the miso soup is pretty good as well. The service has always been quick, efficient, accommodating and pleasant. Although they are quick to bring out the food, I don't usually feel rushed to get out of there quickly. Two more things to note is the outside seating in the warmer months and that it's a byob. Definitely recommended but beware, you might have to yell throughout your meal in order to communicate.
2013-05-08,3,I was taken here on two separate occasions on dates and I wouldn't say it's the best atmosphere for talking. Since this place gets really packed the volume level of everyone's voices is a bit extreme. Although the sushi does come out pretty quick and tastes great! BYOB
2013-04-25,5,Love love! All of their specials are amazing.  Best sushi in Hoboken! Their service is also some of best.
2013-04-09,5,I frequent this establishment.  The staff is great with excellent and friendly service.
2013-03-30,4,Make a reservation for this one, it fills up quickly.  Located on the main drag in Hoboken, the walls are adorned with all types of nautical design and the lights are turned way down low.  I mean borderline dark, it would have been nice to not have to strain to see what I was eating but the taste made up for it.  Sushi is always fresh and well put together.   Plenty of options to choose from starting with your basic stand byes and capped off with some truly different specialty rolls.  Price can vary, however it can certainly be affordable if you limit yourself a bit.  Service is always a crap shoot.  They are very quick and efficient however they can be so damn pushy.  Once your plates are done thy will clear your table and drop the check.  5 minutes later they will ask you to pay.  Don't think you'll get to leisurely enjoy that bottle of wine your brought, because upon paying they will kindly ask you to move along because they need the table.  Tranquilo, this. Overall never a bad experience.   Make sure you bring a bottle or two, and order your food in stages to maximize your time.  Enjoy the tunes and the scenery, fill your belly to capacity, and then go paint the town red, or whatever other color your heart desires.
2013-03-24,5,I almost don't want to review this place because I want it all to myself, but not to say anything would be unjust.  I go here a couple times a week.  The fish quality is great, and the menu selections are as eclectic as the decor.  The staff runs like an efficient machine but they're still pleasant, professional and good natured.  Takeout - Fast & compact.  They got my order slightly wrong once, but I called and they sent out a replacement lickety split and at no charge.  Eating in - The music selection is fabulous whether they're playing "Winds of Change" on a Tuesday night or the waiters twirling their napkins in the air to the latest dance hit at 10pm on a Friday.  It can get a little crowded on the weekends, and understandably they need to flip the tables, so on the weekends I'd recommend arriving outside of the rush hour (7-9pm)It's a BYOB, and the bill is always very reasonable!  Especially for the quality!I highly recommend the Rock Shrimp and the Hamachi Kama appetizers.  And if you're having a party there, which is a great idea, I recommend sharing a Love Boat or two!
2013-03-24,4,Very fresh !!  And the service is always fantastic. The best sushi restaurant I've found in Hoboken.
2013-03-19,4,As many food options there are in Hoboken, the sushi in this town is average at best.  Thankfully, Robongi is the to offer best sushi in Hoboken to date.  The waiters are attentive.  The best part for me is the large cuts fish you'll get with you're sushi or sashimi.  The cuts of fish will envelop the rice like a over sized blanket protecting the rice from the harsh outside world, till you eat it.  They got ramen too which is always a plus.  On a side note, BYOB has to be embraced more, it is really a blessing.  Bring your own bottle for 100% less than you would pay at the restaurant and get wasted without making the restaurant owners feel guilty.  So, this place has BYOB also...
2013-03-18,4,Robongi is the best sushi in Hoboken as far as I'm concerned.  I've tried a few other places in town and been sadly disappointed.  If you want super swanky, fancy sushi with a weird name, go elsewhere.This place is the basics, and done right.  Everything I've ever had there (in the last 6 years) has been just right.  I've never had a bad experience, and know several other people who feel the same.Yes, their decor is ridiculous, I have no idea why they keep it up when everyone hates it, but I rarely eat in there, and find takeout is way better.It's a good eat-in for lunch, but dinner can get crowded and they do play weird pop music on the weekends.....again, not sure why.Bottom line, a good solid sushi place if you're in it for the food.
2013-03-15,1,I wish I had never ordered take out from Robongi. The food was pricey and mediocre at best but even worse was the fact that the delivery man stuck his foot in my doorway as I was closing it after paying him and refused to leave until I called the police.When I contacted Robongi to complain about the scary experience I was told that they had no way of knowing which delivery man it was (I call BS) and I had to send the police to the restaurant to talk to them.Beware when ordering delivery!
2013-03-11,4,Liked: Reasonable price for GOOD sushiDislike: The decor was distracting and confusing Enjoyed the sushi. The waiters were very attentive and polite. Our food came out quickly and was fresh. The bill was $24 for 5 low to average priced rolls, which we were very please about. I will definitely go again.
2013-03-09,3,Loved: BYOB, music, and crowd is dressy & ready to party, better than average sushiHated: Volume of the music, the tables are really close, bathroom waitPerfect place to celebrate your 25th birthday or Bachelorette dinner ONLY. They can handle large parties (12) and the bill ends up being super cheap b/c of the BYOB (about $25 pp)
2013-03-05,1,I had an awful time here.I went on a Saturday night because we heard great things about it, but it felt like we were eating in a club. It was too loud to chat and too dark to see menus or our food. Plus, our table was practically on top of our neighbor's.I don't remember the sushi, but I do remember the experience. Next time, I'm going to Sushi House instead.
2013-02-17,3,Nothing to write home about, but nothing to complain about either. Pretty decent sushi, good service (refilled tea like crazy, but it was only mediocre tea), comfy, clean atmosphere.
2013-02-16,4,Really nice specialty rolls. Great flavor and a size that's easy to eat. I dislike when sushi bars try to impress with the size of the roll. This place does it right by having delicious ingredient combinations and a downplay on presentation. Not pretentious. Cool beachy decor. Byob. Oh and they veggie gyoza was one of the best I've tasted in a while.
2013-02-08,4,Sushi here is good, although I have to say, of the places in Hoboken, I like Yeung II better.  Many reviewers will note that the fish here is 'fresh', which is true, but there's more to good sushi than just fresh fish.  It's the texture of the rice and how it's seasoned, how the other ingredients taste, etc., and weighing all those things, I think Yeung II comes out ahead.Having said all that, there is one dish on the menu that I really love, and have ordered many times:  the nabeyaki udon (chicken udon soup), which is delicious.  Great, homemade chicken broth, filled with chicken, mushrooms and other vegetables, yummy udon noodles, and even a fried egg, plus two of the best shrimp tempura you'll ever taste on the side.  It's addictive, and great during the cold weather.  Four stars for that dish alone, says I.
2013-02-06,5,Went there on Tuesday night with hubby! Great service! Amazing sushi and sashimi !!!! Fresh, melts in your mouth , no fish smell!!! I used to live in the South Pacific so I know fresh fish! I hope it's this good next time.
2013-01-15,4,love this little hole in the wall. friday and sat nights its fun loud great crowd. food is fresh and best sushi in hoboken (or at least that i've found). Only downfall of this place is the wait staff...they rush rush rush youuuuuuuuu!!!! always looking for quick turnovers on the tables. I was able to pay by credit card here too maybe they have a minimum or something. its BYOB...i've seen people there with 30 packs...wine bottle(s) etc so bring it!
2013-01-12,4,I'd say of all the sushi spots in Hoboken, this one is my favorite. Great service, great good, great atmosphere AND BYOB! Perfect in the summer too because they have seating outside.
2013-01-12,2,Nothing impressive and I would say below average sushi quality and portions.  I ordered tuna, salmon and octopus sushi.
2013-01-12,5,Best sushi in town! Love the decor so unexpected for a Hoboken restaurant. Delicious sushi (very fresh fish!) the staff are always so nice and very professional! If you are ever too tired to go to Robongi they deliver really quickly!
2013-01-02,2,Wall of shame!  Charging a dollar for spicy mayo = a one-way ticket to the wall of shame.  Come on guys!
2012-12-13,4,I LOVE this place. Hands down one of my favorite sushi places and its b.y.o. Im never disappointed whenever I go. Every first timer I bring loves it. Great spot to go with friends or dates. Weekends it gets pretty busy, the turnover is pretty ridiculous. Over the weekends the music is always good and loud. Its a typical sushi place in that you're basically sitting on top of one another but the food is always up to par. My favorite specialty roll is the Sex on the Beach- incredible & as good as it sounds. Highly recommended if you're in Hoboken.
2012-12-13,4,Fantastic sushi. Went on a Friday night at about 8. Short wait and the place was extremely vibrant and fun. Cool atmosphere for a group for friends.  The decor is more of what you expect at a beach restaurant, however, regardless it helps contribute to the fun atmosphere.  I would highly recommend someone who is looking for good sushi at an upbeat tempo.
2012-11-30,1,The rice layer around their rolls are so thick and the rolls were messy as if made by a newbie. I wasn't impressed and will not order again.
2012-11-24,3,Cute sushi place with nautical deÃÅcor (a little strange). Sushi was fresh. No extra frills on the menu, more or less your standard japanese fare.  Don't expect extra mile service, either. I wanted to share an udon bowl & instead of splitting it the server brought an extra bowl for us to do it at the table. This was 1 of four dishes we ordered including a $17 shrimp tempura. Tip: careful of wasabi, chefs didn't wear gloves
2012-11-05,4,Great spot to grab sushi during the spring/summer/fall to take advantage of their little outdoor seating. This establishment is a BYOB and best of all - their sushi is great!!! I recommend stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood looking for some good sushi at a decent price.
2012-10-22,3,I stopped by here for takeout and had the soft shell crab tempura and spicy tune tartare. I really love soft shell crab in general and thought the tempura was good and the portion size larger than I expected also. I also thought the spicy tuna tartare was pretty good. There was a distinct spicy flavor, which sometimes is missing from "spicy" tuna tartare. I definitely plan on returning to try other menu items.
2012-10-16,5,BEST sushi in Hoboken + amazing service + awesome vibe + BYOB = Robongi! I come here at least once a week and have never had a bad experience. Love this place and a big shout out to Ivan for always making us feel so welcomed!
2012-10-05,4,I have been ordering sushi from here for years and have never had a bad experience with Robongi. The fish is always fresh, the rolls are so good. I love that this is also a BYO. Its my top pick for sushi in Hoboken!Side Note...the only bad experience I had here was a delivery person that demanded a larger tip for delivery. I was so taken aback I should have just taken the entire tip from him. It ruined my meal as a result b/c I couldn't get over how rude he was.
2012-09-28,4,This review is as fresh as the fish that I'm eating from there now.Been a long time since I've eaten here.  Since I'm working remotely today, I figured I get delivery from here (Tekka Don Lunch Special)Tuna is fresh, the rice is good, and I love their Orange Ginger Dressing for the salad.A very tasty meal for lunch today.  Need to go back and eat at the actual restaurant again.
2012-09-23,4,I came here on a Saturday Night w/ a friend. It's a small place, so it gets packed quickly. It's BYOB and they are really great w/ assisting you with your outsourced libations. It was a little loud in there for my taste, they had a table of jersey shore wannabe's banging on their table to the beat of the club music blaring. Then they perceeded to dance on top of their chairs. I guess this is a good pre-gaming spot before going to the clubs. What stood out to me was the service and food. Service was quick, maybe too quick at times. The food was really good. My friend and I shared an order of Ramen, it was sooooo gooood. We both had rolls and they were great too. The decor is a bit cheesy and it's a little too dark, but the food is great. I would sooo recommend eating here if you're in the neighborhood.
2012-09-22,4,My favorite sushi spot... hands down. Their fish is always fresh which is #1 for me.It's best between late Spring and early Fall when you can grab a table outside on Washington street. But even during the colder months you can grab a small table inside where the music is loud enough to allow you to have a private conversation with your date even if the next table is only a foot away. BYOB.
2012-09-04,1,delivery took over an hour when it was expected to take 25 - 40 minutes. driver was also very rude. not ordering from here again
2012-08-10,4,I found this place on yelp, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm happy I did. We made sure to bring 2 bottles of wine, and sat outside on the patio.  No corking fee, so that was a plus. The waiters were fun, attentive, knowledgeable and engaging. The dishes were reasonably priced, and despite there being a pretty large crowd dining, the food came out quick, and was delicious. We liked some rolls over others, but overall it was definitely an enjoyable time. We'll be back for sure.
2012-07-24,4,I have tried several sushi restaurants several times in Hoboken and Robongi comes out on top.  Their sushi rolls are reliably delicious and they are BYOB.  They are also pretty quick with delivery.  Eel avocado, spicy tuna, salmon avocado...all of my sushi roll staples are done well here.  They are not opposed to large groups with 30-packs and saki either which is a plus!
2012-07-19,5,5 star sushi.  Was with someone who walked around till he found it so he could show me.  It was shumaitastic.  BYOB, interesting/cute decor and the staff was very attentive, quick, and friendly.  Generous portions, Fresh, and reasonable prices.  Made my first trip to Hoboken a great one!
2012-07-07,3,This place serves sushi. That is it - it's very average, although I have been assured that this is the best you can get in Hoboken. The sushi here is pricey (came to about $20 per person and I only had two rolls and mochi ice cream). You can most definitely get better sushi for the same price in Manhattan. I will say, however, that if you're in the area you should drop by for the cute decor. I love how it is decorated like a bait and tackle shop - I almost expect them to serve fish and chips and Alaskan crab legs dipped in butter. Makes for a fun dining experience.
2012-07-07,3,One of my biggest pet peeves eating out is when you're waiting for a table while an empty one is right there in front of you. Apparently the staff was saving it to combine with the next available table in order to accommodate a larger party. Just doesn't feel right..The food was great. We had these great gyoza pork dumpings as an appetizer, complete with a very tasty sauce. My girlfriend had the house salad but said it was very "watery." Perhaps they didn't drain the greens well enough. I ordered the sukiyaki, which is yam noodle soup with thinly sliced steak, bean curd, and vegetables. Delicious.
2012-07-06,4,This place rocks.  The sashimi is consistently fresh, and for about $21 (Sashimi Deluxe), you can get 18 pieces.  Not bad at all.  This is all I really get here.  To me, it's better than most Japanese places in Hoboken. The ginger there is yellow; not pink.  For some reason that matters to me.  For the non-sashimi/sushi eater, I'd recommend the soft shell crab appetizer.  They also have soba - which is always a hit with my son.  Lastly, it's BYOB.  My wife and I, when dining in, will usually bring some sake and a bottle of sho chu to get our 'krunk' on.
2012-07-06,3,While the food here is good, I am surprised many people consider it to be the best in town. Japanese food (and basically any Asian food in general) is not something people associate Hoboken with. With that being said, Robongi is clearly one of the better options available on Washington Street.AtmosphereWhenever I am in Hoboken and pass by Robongi it is always packed. Typically there is a wait from what I've seen. Be prepared for blaring techno music and tight seating. You likely will get bumped into AT LEAST once during your time there.PricePretty reasonable for the area. Portion sizes are very good for what you pay.ServiceFriendly but rushed.FoodWe split for an appetizer the squid salad and Nasu. The Nasu is marinated eggplant in a miso sauce. I wasn't expecting much at first but my friend convinced me to try it. It was delicious!! Loved the sauce. The squid salad was good but was doused in mayo. Too much for my preference.We then split 3 rolls - eel avocado, Alaska, and the Tuna Naruto. Eel avocado is pretty self explanatory and was good. The Alaska had salmon, avocado, and cucumber. It was probably the best of the three but could have been a bit fresher. The Naruto had a large amount of tuna and was wrapped in cucumber. The tuna was good but not too fresh. All that food was just enough for my friend and I. We were pretty stuffed after that.One of the aspects of Robongi that made me knock off one star was the lack of higher quality seafood options.  All the salmon was farmed and their seafood entrees weren't anything unique. Most neighborhood Japanese places are like this, though.  Totally expected. Yet, once you have been to higher quality restaurants with a more diverse seafood selection it is hard to put the two in the same league.  Despite all the praise this place gets, you would think the types of fish would be of superior quality.OverallRobongi is best for larger groups. In that setting I will likely come here again. If you are looking for a more intimate quieter experience check out Illuzion one block over. Fresher sushi made with higher quality ingredients.
2012-06-20,4,Robongi is my go-to for sushi take-out. Rolls are always good and they are timely with delivery. If you're ordering for a few people, they tend to pack all the rolls into one container, which is a bit annoying. Other than that, this place is consistent and one of the best sushi places in town. In-house dining is fun and tends to get rowdy on a weekend night (BYOB!).
2012-06-18,2,What is the big deal about this place? It is always packed and the yelp reviews are generally decent.. have my taste buds betrayed me? I came here on a Friday night with some friends and it was disappointing to say the least. the sushi and sashimi wasn't exactly the freshest and the ice cream was half melted when it came out. "Meh" is right.
2012-06-11,4,I was recently told about this place by a friend and was simply blown away by not only the quality of the food, but of the speed of my order and the customer service. I was told very specifically "You must eat the sashimi WITHOUT any soy sauce... you'll be amazed at the quality of this fish"Well, he was right. With or without the soy sauce, you can tell the quality is absolutely amazing. I used to think Precious had the best sushi in town, but this place is absolutely above them on the Sushi. I can't attest to any of the other Asian dishes, as I haven't ordered that from here. Something else I REALLY enjoyed was that while I was waiting for my takeout order and sitting outside at their tables people watching, the greeter gave me a complimentary cup of hot tea. Not that tea costs them much of anything, but this gesture alone puts them on top in town as far as I'm concerned. Since the first time, I've visited three times total now, all of which have been fantastic! Thanks Robongi, you're well deserving of your 4 stars.
2012-06-08,3,Finally tried this place after hearing for years that it is the best sushi place in Hoboken. While we had no complaints about the food and enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it's anything special. I've definitely had better sushi in Hoboken (and better service, too!)
2012-06-04,4,It's good for what it is.... sushi in Hoboken.  The service is great every single time I go there.  Last time there, we were sitting outside, when it started to rain and the servers were very helpful in getting us inside.  They even gave us free ice cream (green tea [or was it red bean] was very good) for dessert.  Another time we showed up around closing time, and whereas most places would give you attitude, the servers there were very kind and gracious.The food is pretty good.  It's a little inconsistent on each trip, but overall the freshness and quality of the fish is good.  I've had a lot of their speciality rolls and liked most of them.  Though I wish some of the rolls listed as spicy were a little bit more spicy.  Though I'm sure you can ask for it to be spicier, like we did with their Nabeyaki udon (udon noodles were good, the broth was great).  Sitting outside is nice, the tables aren't too crammed together so you're able to carry on a conversation.  The inside is a little wacky looking [like a generic fried seafood place], and sometimes it's a little too dark in there.Oh, and don't forget it's BYOB.
2012-05-29,3,Although the decor was nice, the food is mediocre at best. I may make another round at this place in the future.
2012-05-28,2,There are definitely excellent sushi restaurants in Manhattan that are better and cheaper, but now that I live in Hoboken and not NYC, I've been trying to find the best sushi in Northeast NJ. (Still, nothing compares to my faves in NYC). When I first moved to Hoboken, I started with Robongi because of the high ratings. It's totally overrated. The sushi is expensive and flavorless. Better options are Zen Sushi in Livingston, Aki in Bloomfield, and Sushi Lounge in Hoboken (more $$$ but better sushi).
2012-05-27,4,Loved it! It was my first time in Hoboken and I was surprised to see that most if not all of the restaurants on Washington St. are BYOB.... but hey, no complaints, it saves $$$. So Meggy & I decided on Robongi for our sushi lunch due to its outdoor seating and proximity to the liquor store :) Everything was fantastic, the waiters were super friendly without being annoying, they opened our beers for us every time we grabbed another from the bucket of ice water they brought us to keep it cold in...(are you kidding??).... the sushi was great, I tried a roll I have never had, spinach shitake. The prices were a tad higher than I'm used to, but barely and well worth it because of the overall relaxed easy breezy time we had. We will definitely return.
2012-05-26,4,Simply the best sushi in Hoboken.  The prices are slightly higher than at other Japanese restaurants in the city, but the quality of the fish is significantly better, and they consistently produce superb product.  No matter what I order, I always include a spicy scallop roll.  Not into the odd ship/fishing motif?  Delivery is always prompt and accurate.
2012-05-15,2,This place is so overrated. I was here about 4 years ago and remember it being pretty decent but then again at that time I think I only had a quick sushi roll. Came back over this past weekend and was pretty surprised to see that this had 4 stars  . I ordered sashimi deluxe which I have to say the cuts were generous but the quality was just ok. What bothered me the most was our waiter messed up my order. 1st he forgot that I didn't want red tuna so my sashimi platter came with it and I just let it go. 2nd he forgot about a special roll that I had also ordered. This place is just ok, nothing great and I probably will never come back. Coming from living in Cali for some years i think i got a taste of true sushi and From what I heard the owners are Chinese not Japanese....nevertheless I your looking to eat sushi in Hoboken I would probably go to Maru Sushi or Sushi Lounge
2012-05-14,4,What should you do on a Saturday night in Hoboken when the temperature is in the mid-70's and all you want to do is sit outside? Find a fantastic BYOB dining establishment and chill. That's what.Enter, this weekend. We'd played all day Friday/Saturday and weren't sure what Saturday night would bring, but we knew we should eat. A BYOB was on the agenda and we landed on Robongi. The dining experience, itself, was a little bit odd. We definitely didn't have one waiter. I'm not sure a.) who took our order, b.) who brought our food, c.) who kept refilling our wine glasses, or d.) who asked us to move - read on - but we were never in need of anything so the formula must work. It was actually kind of nice not to have a single person in charge of our table, instead it was a collective waiter team that took care of us. We started with edamame and the tempura appetizer. We easily identified the shrimp, but the fried vegetables were more of a guessing game, which we don't think we won. There was a sweet potato (yum!), a cucumber, and... things that tasted good but were unidentifiable to our Midwestern meat-and-potato eyeballs.Next, we moved along to the classic California roll (my choice, it was excellent, but I was left wondering who had left out the cucumber), the Yellow Tail roll, and the sweet potato roll. They were presented beautifully and easily set up for two people to enjoy without reaching over one another. The sweet potato roll wasn't one I'd ordinarily choose, but now that I've had it I'll probably choose it again and again. I was encouraged to try it with the soy sauce - sweet and savory. Mmmm.. I'm glad I'm no longer dating the guy who is afraid to try new things. Picky eaters suck. Our meal would have ended there, but this weird thing happened mid-entree where we were asked to move tables so they could accommodate a large party. That has definitely never happened to me before, but what were we supposed to do? We're nice Midwesterners so we obliged, though we were a bit put off by the odd request. However, at the end of our meal we were given ice cream on the house, which was nice that they acknowledged that they made us move after we were nice and settled. As the ice cream goes, I'd stick to the vanilla. The green tea ice cream wasn't as nice as I'd have hoped. Overall, I'd definitely go back. It was a great way to enjoy a Saturday night - and affordable!
2012-05-14,4,+ Lunch special even on the weekends - almost everything under $10... (Even otherwise, their menu and prices are pretty reasonable and standard for sushi joints).+ Portions are HUGE + Sashimi was super thick, fresh, delicious.  + Quaint ambiance on Washington avenue - we sat outside though, can't speak to the inside. + BYOB+ Service was really awesomeAm definitely planning to return next weekend.
2012-05-04,5,This is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken.  If you want really good sushi in the area then you should probably go into NYC and increase your budget by $50/person.However, if you want good sushi, BYOB, and a fun place in the area then this is your bet.  It's a bit quirky but after you go here a few times you begin to like the decor and the techno music they play after 9:00 on weekends.
2012-05-02,5,Spicy tuna tartar, awesome. Service, awesome. Solid and diverse menu. Very impressed as always.
2012-04-29,1,Has gone substantially down hill.  Used to be the best sushi in town (in a town of mediocre sushi) and is now one of worst.  Sushi was not fresh at all.  Rice was hard.  No more Robongi for me.
2012-04-23,5,Fantastic sushi, fresh sashimi, awesome grilled yellowtail collar, super friendly service, smiling servers, free dessert, and free-flowing water into your glass without asking plus a byo... What more could you ask for?! 5 stars, hands down, and tell Ivan I said hi!
2012-04-21,3,The first time I came here I would have given it a 4 star rating, but after a few return visits I decided to knock one off. The atmosphere is kitschy but fun. Like many other Hoboken restaurants they have outdoor seating and are BYOB. Seating inside can be a little cramped but the staff is very accommodating and tries to seat you as soon as possible, even on busy nights. Also important to note, I have never felt rushed with my meal, even on these busy nights when I'm killing a bottle of wine with a friend over girl talk. My starter staples, miso soup and edamame, were good but those are pretty fail-safe options. As far as sushi, I'm not the most adventurous, but I'm also not a California roll type of girl. I've tried....spicy tuna roll (love that they put crunchy tempura flakes in this), shrimp tempura roll (anything fried is going to be good, comes with tobiko which is a unique touch), calamari roll with avocado (I know, I know again with the fried non-sushi! Not as good as I thought it would be), and finally the Philadelphia roll (if you like smoked salmon and cream cheese you will love this one). I've never gotten sick from the sushi, but I've also never been blown away by presentation, quality or freshness. Bill comes to about $50 with appetizers, a few rolls and dessert for two people. Not a bad deal, but also better sushi options in the area.
2012-04-20,5,best sushi in hoboken hands down. Nice staff. Awesome atmosphere
2012-04-15,4,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi and the rolls. It's run by Chinese folks and in Hoboken, so I wasn't expecting much. I ordered by phone and the woman taking my order had a pretty thick accent and trouble understanding what I wanted. The music (club-like) was so loud, it's probably not all her fault. Don't order from here (or most other sushi places) on a Monday or Tuesday. That's my advice.
2012-03-28,5,Visited for the first time this past week and the food was PHENOMENAL.  I'm a huge fan and the great sushi, awesome atmosphere and speedy service will have me coming back!
2012-03-24,2,This funky place is supposed to be the standard for sushi in Hoboken? If so then boken is hopeless. Dry, stale, warm, tough at its best.The fish was beyond lackluster. Dont know if it was an off day. It seems like they were trying to push out all the stale past its prime fish that they had left over from the weekend.And if thats the case. Shame on you. For such an acclaimed establishment with such a high rating on zagat I just could not believe the quality of the tuna and salmon was so low. The fish had a drynes to it and either it was due to how it was cut or just the fish itself but it was simply a tragedy on how tough it was.The only reason this place did not get one star instead of two was the fact the hot food was good. The chicken terriyaki and shrimp tempura were made well and were tasty. The chicken was quite flavorful juicy and tender. The shrimp had a light crispy batter and were cooked just right.Beyond the hot food and low quality of the fish, the place is dimly light and somewhat dingy.From what I noticed a lot of ppl like the "funky" decor. Which is ok, but when you begin to notice the actual filth that lays on top of the tacky decor it gets pretty outright repulsive.They keep the lights real dim and low as if they are trying to hide the filth that surrounds the guests.And its just my opinion but if they have no scrupples about not caring of keeping the dining room clean, i can only imagine the nightmare that lurks in the kitchen and in the fridge.Just dont know how they have gone this long without health inspectors getting them to clean up their act.Anyway if you dont mind being served stale fish in a dingyvenviroment, by all means check it out. But dont say I did not warn you.Mgmt if you read this please purchase some dusters and some lemon pledge and while your out buy some fresh fish from the sushi place next door.I dont hate, just being honest. Truth sometimes hurts. Esp.when ur paying $40 for lunch and get sushi the quality of what has been sitting at the counter at Shoprite for the past day.
2012-03-24,2,I really dunno where to start.  I will start then with......hipsters  have "interesting" taste.  Interesting like calling a Pabst a quality beer.This is def a locals place.  Everyone seems to love it.  I either missed something great on the menu, or this is all Hipster hype and i leam to the latter.Walk in, very packed w no elbow room.  VERY dark, almost so dark you can't see the dust and mess everywhere.   A tad gross, ESP for raw fish, bit hey, we like divey  once in a while.The service, void of any usual Japanese politeness, got the food out suspiciously quick.  We got 2 bentos.  One chick teriyaki and tuna roll, one tempura w salmon roll, and a harumaki.The harumaki was OK.   The chicken teriyaki was good (1 point).  The tempua w mixed vegetables came only w eggplant, to which I'm allergic, to which they didn't seem to understand the concept of and implied that's how it always comes everywhere. Lol.   There was ONE piece of zucchini.  Raw.  The shrimp itself was ok.  The maki rolls were NOT fresh.  No way, no how.  They came out fast, they were dry and salty.  The nori broke under the chopsticks.  I start peeling apart to find WARM fish that had just been salted.  On top of that, the fish was chopped and all the fat removed?  Wtf.  YUCK.I walked out.  I don't do that often either, but if a place is going to serve me room temp, overly salted and clearly tampered with and or old fish in a simple maki roll, you suck ass.  Its also a concern for the health dept.   Turn on your lights, clean your damn place, and buy a damn fridge that works please....oh yeah, and a least ONE Japanese guy thatknows his fish and takes immense pride in the freshnessof his product.   I implied it was too dark multiple times, the staff just gave us a look.  They also gave us one when we had to ask where the harumaki sauce was n they had to point it out on the table, as if they are asked constantly, its not our fault its hard to see blk saue in a blk dish in a dark room.My friend and I greatly appreciate Maru down the street.  Its very Japanese w some traditional end stuff like hamachi collars and such and great fish. The decors a little old, but theres no dehating a good quality piece of fish compared to one that's been sitting salted in a warm case all day in a place where they keep lights almost off so you can only have a limited view of your plate.
2012-03-20,5,Awesome tiny place with a big menu, veggie rolls were surprisingly amazing specially the peanut avocado roll. A must for all sushi lovers living in the Hoboken/newport area.
2012-03-19,4,I am a huuugggeee sushi fan and I have to say this is one of my favorite sushi places I've recently found in NJ--top 5 on my list. I LOVE the crazy rolls with different flavors and interesting combinations and this place definitely has variety. The service was great--waitor was always readily available and very attentive to our needs. BYOB is always a plus and the ambiance is fun, unique and provides for a great experience with friends. I wouldn't recommend for a private date as it is a bit tight and you are almost sitting on top of other diners, but that's hoboken dining at it's finest.
2012-03-11,3,Ordered take-out from here for a pajama/TV night with 2 girlfriends, and they delivered very quickly. Place is a bit pricey. Solid beef donburi and dragon sushi roll. Really amazing American Dream sushi roll. Wish I could have tried my friend's udon because it looked satisfying.
2012-03-11,5,Friendly and helpful service. Fresh and delicious food. BYO is always a plus. Can't wait to go back. Try the garlic broccoli, rock shrimp, pork gyoza, I-mate roll, and tuna sashimi. We are never disappointed when we come here!
2012-03-09,3,Really upbeat vibe - they play Top 40s music throughout your meal (bearable and enjoyable, not too loud).  Very dim lighting inside (apparently a technique that usually causes patrons to think they are more hungry), was harder to read the menu.  Ordered their tuna tartare appetizer, avocado salad, and an avocado-cucumber roll.  I thought the tuna tartare was good until I began chewing on an unusually large piece of tuna (not my preference, that is why I order the stuff mushed up!).  Really turned off my appetite so I didn't finish the rest of that meal.  I took photos of the plate (in hopes to share with Yelp) and I saw the presentation really wasn't as good as I thought it was.  Now I understand why they keep the lights so dim because after I looked up my tuna tartare photo (with the camera's flash enhancing the actual photo), it really looks like a pile of pinkish-red mush slapped onto a random white plate (and if you're wondering what I mean by that, it isn't attractive).  Prices are great and the service is very quick.  Definitely a vibrant spot to choose for dinner.  Probably not the best for groups because the spacing is a bit cramped.  If I leaned 6 inches in any one direction, I would have been touching someone at the table next to me.
2012-03-09,5,EXTREMELY friendly service. Attentive wait stuff and most of all, yummy sushi. The decor is silly but fun and really hasn't been used too much with a sushi restaurant, so it's refreshing to see. As I said, the staff is curious and polite and really make the experience all the better. At the end of my stay, my date and I received complimentary ice cream for no good reason at all. We just assumed they noticed we were having a good time and wanted to assist in the festivities. So major points for that!
2012-03-04,5,The best sushi place in New Jersey.Great service, great ambiance, and great fresh sushi.
2012-02-08,2,Ok, let me preface this rating with a little of the back story. We spent over $100 at this BYOB establishment but were rushed through each course. A different waiter would come by every five minutes and try to take our plates away even when they were half full. We ordered dessert just so we could keep our entrees a little longer. Overall the food was good, but this made it difficult to enjoy. I felt like I was part of an assembly line, and that they were just trying to push me out. Additionally, the atmosphere is typical "Hoboken", read: sorority girls ordering California rolls and chugging form a giant bottle of yellow tail. When my friend suggested we go here this weekend, I was quick to shut it down!
2012-02-03,4,I just love any place with Hamachi kama.  To round things out had a rock and roll tuna roll which included deep fried tuna and yellowtail I think.
2012-01-23,5,Great find.The sushi is fresh.  Servers are nice.  Rolls are creative and large.Prices are very reasonable.  It is a BYOB... always a good thing!The best part is the loud techno music they place.  Nothing like pop-locking while you enjoy a spicy tuna roll!It is kind of loud... so go with friends or on a 'fun date'.
2012-01-15,5,My favorite Japanese restaurant ever! Their service is always excellent regardless of how busy they are. Their food is fresh and always really good. Sushi, rolls and teriyaki are all very good. Every restaurant in Hoboken should learn from Robongi - they remember their customers and always greet you with warm welcomes. It makes you feel like the restaurant is truly a part of the Hoboken neighborhood.
2012-01-12,4,I get take out from Robongi for lunch about 2 times a week.  Great sushi, really good udon noodle soup, and they are FAST.  Definitely good for lunch/delivery when you are in a hurry, short on time and you want your lunch in less than 1/2 hour.
2012-01-05,4,This is a Friday Night Sushi kind of place. BYOB means you can bring in a six pack or a couple of bottles of wine. Not really a "romantic" place on the weekend because of the large tables, making it kind of loud. But it's fun and the sushi is good and cheap.They have a lot of appetizers, which looked delicious. We tried the crispy salmon skins. Sweet and salty. Also had three different rolls and the fish was fresh and delicious. Miso soup was ok.The ambience is really fun with beach-y decorations hanging from the ceiling. The staff is really nice and attentive. Open those bottles of wine right away!
2012-01-03,3,I had heard this place had the best sushi in Hoboken but was misinformed. The sushi was decent. We had two special rolls and both were decent. If you live in the neighborhood and love sushi, it's a place to add to your list. We had the Sex on the Beach roll and this special 2012 roll (for new years). Don't HIGHLY recommend either.But for an appetizer, I would highly recommend the Spicy Tuna Tartar (spicy tuna, avacado and mango ball. DELISH.)
2011-12-30,5,Best sushi in town!  The fish is consistently incredibly fresh and the service is great.  Have never been disappointed and we go there a lot.  The decor is funky and fun but we keep going back for the food and service ... all the way from Mahwah.
2011-12-22,4,The sushi is great! Awesome portions and waiters are nice! They serve the water with ice, and the miso soup is way better than Ido sushi's. The fish is nice and fresh, but sometimes when we order sushi, I ask for no wasabi or ginger at all, and when I eat a roll, I taste a little wasabi, but overall, it's great!
2011-12-05,5,Best sushi in Hoboken. Extremely fresh, BYOB, great portions, fun atmosphere.
2011-12-05,5,Love Robongi!!!  Sushi is absolutely delicious.  I think it's some of the best sushi in Hoboken (other than Ayame).  I went during the warmer months and sat outside.  It was busy on a Friday night, but we didn't wait long to be seated.  The inside of the restaurant had a very fun vibe (fun music and dim lighting).  I think this would be a good spot to bring your friends to before a night of going out.  Love that it's byob.
2011-12-01,4,I've never been to the Hoboken location, but I get delivery from the Weehawken location at least twice a week. I LOVE this place! They have amazing specialty rolls (the american dream and the sakura roll are my favorites as well as the sweet potato roll). Everything always tastes so fresh. Super fast delivery, I literally never wait longer than 20 minutes from the minute I place the phonecall. Highly recommended!!
2011-11-25,3,The sushi is good but not such a great dinning experience. The tables are right on top of each other and during dinner they music is really loud. Definitely not the place to go if you're trying to catch up with friends.
2011-11-17,2,The food is ok. I went to the place because of the 4 star rating, but I was so disappointed. The decoration is kinda interesting and cute. I ordered sashimi, but they were too thin, and not that fresh. Overall, the place is not worth four stars.
2011-11-10,3,So, my husband and I were wandering around Hoboken looking for a good place to eat and we stumbled upon Robongi. So happy we did! While this isn't the most phenomenal Japanese food we've ever eaten, it was yummy and very well priced!!We had a yummy lunch there including a bento box (my husband got that) and I got the Sushi lunch. Both dishes were $9 and incredibly worth it.Their service is quick, their food is good, they have definitely become our "go to" Japanese restaurant.
2011-11-06,4,Great sushi and sashimi. Their bento box is just the right size to fill you up with and priced accordingly.  Must try their beef negimaki, my favorite.The lighting is a bit on the dark side. Hard to read the menu if you don't have perfect vision.  Decoration is kinda messy and all over the place, doesn't really fit the dark ambiance.  Music played is a mixed bag.  Sometimes they play nice classics, other times loud club music. Depends on their playlist at the time i guess.  Price is reasonable and service is ok, though it feels as if they try to rush you out.
2011-11-05,5,I discovered the Robongi in Weehawken (because someone put a menu in my mailbox) before this one in Hoboken but I must say that service is the same.service is FAST & lunch specials are the way to go! I paid $9 for 2 shrimp tempura rolls, salad, and miso soup. and it was all VERY YUMMY!
2011-10-31,4,First off ask for a seat away from the bathroom, the constant shuffling of patrons behind your seat is enough to throw off any good meal. Once you do that though you are in for a treat. Great sushi at reasonable prices and it's a byob!
2011-10-15,5,This place seriously rocks.The sushi is so good that I am still excited about it the next day.  It's that good.  And I am generally pretty indifferent about sushi.The place pumps club beats at club volumes.  Sure it can be a little irritating, you have to lean in to actually hear anyone at your table, but it will probably be less irritating than a rowdy nearby table that this atmosphere attracts.  Whatever the case Robongi has decided to make this a part of the experience, so take it or leave it.BYOB is always a plus.Quality of food makes this a Hoboken favorite and earns a full 5 stars.
2011-10-11,5,i love robongi and have eaten here numerous times over the past 5 years  for dinner.  they always have really good special rolls, and the wait staff always lets us know which one is the best (they usually have 2).  the fish is always fresh, and i have always been satisfied with my food.  and its a byob, added bonus!
2011-10-05,4,It had been a while since my last visit to Robongi, so I stopped there last night for dinner. The food was delicious.Our appetizers were all solid, favorites being beef negimaki, shumai, and gyoza.  The fried calamari was a bit on the tough side. Our sushi was fresh and delicious.  As far as the atmosphere, the decor is quite silly, like Friday's meets Red Lobster. The place is so dark it's strange, good luck reading the menu. Definitely not for a romantic date, but definitely WOULD recommend for a tasty, casual dinner with your friends or significant other. BYOB. Outside seating great for warm nights. Very nice and attentive staff.  Prices typical for Jersey Sushi restaurant. Very crowded on weekends, much more space during the week.
2011-10-03,2,This place is like the Applebee's of Sushi. I've never been to a Sushi tackier restaurant besides a Sushi/diner establishment in out in the middle of Pennsylvania. The place is always crowded and its usually difficult to get a table, especially on a weekend night. A lot of people have recommended this place and I really don't know why. Even after making myself focus on the food instead of all the stupid garbage hung on the walls I can't say that the food was particularly memorable. I would describe it as average quality sushi. Combine that with the awful atmosphere of the place and I would say that there's much better options for sushi in Hoboken. The service was also pretty lousy, there were 3 of us and they brought out the food for 2 people (even though we all placed fairly similar orders) way before the 3rd person got their food leading to an uncomfortable "go ahead, start eating" negotiation.
2011-09-22,5,Really as good as they get!  This is the best sushi place in Hoboken.  The fish is so fresh here; it feels like it's melting in your mouth.  Last night, I had the Iso roll (named for its white seaweed wrapper), which was really delicious, as well as the Sushi deluxe combo.  The dinner combo comes with a large miso soup.  The slices of fish are both fresh and large.  I also got a few pieces of salmon sashimi which was on par with the rest of the meal.  The prices are reasonable for sushi and because it's BYOB, it's definitely an affordable night out.I'm a fan of Honshu in Jersey City, but I think this ranks right up there with it in Hoboken.
2011-09-13,3,This is a really great place. The atmosphere at night is very loud with good music playing. Be sure to bring a few bottles of wine with you.As far as food, the sushi is outstanding. We ordered a lot of different types of sushi: sashimi appetizer, rainbow roll, a few specials, tuna roll, etc. Each sushi piece tasted fresh and the service was exceptional as well. The edamame (spelling) appetizer was also good. I'm not a fan but it was consumed cquickly.The only reason why I give this is a 3 star is they rush you out. I like to enjoy sushi and eat slow, but the waiters were always trying to rush us out of this place. This is unfortunate and ruins a good meal.
2011-09-03,1,This is my very first review. I just came back from dinner at Robongi and couldn't wait to create a Yelp account so i can review it. So here it goes, this place is an utter disgrace! I've ordered delivery from here before and the rice was hard and crumbly. Thinking it was just an one time occurrence, I came here to dine to give it another shot. Worst decision ever. The rice on the rolls were just as hard and crumbly like I had mentioned. It tasted like it was left over rice from the fridge. I can't believe no one had complained about this on yelp. My husband and I had to unroll all the sushi to eat the filling, leaving mounds of hard nasty rice on our plates. The decor is tacky and does not fit a Japanese restaurant. Music was too loud and bad choice of house music all night - for a Japanese restaurant?? One of the worst thing about this place were the layout. The tables are placed too close to each other which wouldn't be a problem if it weren't for the loud thumping music. We had to scream to get a word across. Needless to say, you can hear every detail of the conversations from neighboring tables. We were also seated right in front of the restrooms. Patrons had to squeeze themselves behind our chairs to get to it. Come on. Sparing 3 tables so that people can go to the restrooms comfortably would be a much smarter choice. Plus it took forever to get our food. I'm sure losing the 3 tables would speed things up. The lighting is very dim as well. This place just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. The only good thing were our grilled squid appetizer.
2011-08-17,2,Service was great but the sushi didn't taste very fresh. Tuna and avocado was decent, but the california roll was gross. I would give it another shot but overall wasn't very impressed
2011-08-16,4,Went here recently for the first time and all I have to say is: AMAZING!I was here on a so called date and we asked the waiter to bring out what they thought was the best.  They brought out some edamame to start with which is always delish!Next they brought out this place full of four amazing looking sushi rolls and we had at it.  Not one of them was bad.  I had trouble picking a favorite!  It was also BYOB so the white wine went very well with it.  After, they asked if we wanted dessert but we were quite full so we declined then BOOM! They came out with a plate of ice cream!  One scoop was ginger ice cream, which was pretty fantastic to say the least, and then one scoop of delish home comfort vanilla :)I will go back again!  We sat outside on a beautiful night.
2011-08-14,5,Robongi, without a doubt, has the best Japanese food of anywhere in Hoboken, or New Jersey, for that matter. The lunch special is reasonably priced and a delicious treat all year round. The sushi is fresh and the aesthetics of the dishes add to the always great flavor. Delivery is quick and the service is friendly. Robongi is must-have for all!
2011-08-09,4,Best sushi I've had in Hoboken. I'm a huge fan of their rolls, and their sashimi is plentiful and fresh.If you live within the perimeter of the Mile Square, this place is a great bet for delivery: fast service and good food.
2011-08-07,5,I love this place. Very good service and very good sushi!We started with a few appetizers. My favorite was what seemed like a fried shrimp or calamari in a sweet orange sauce. Though it was fried, it wasn't too greasy like I tend to see at Japanese restaurants. Very well done.For the main meal, we had a sushi and sashimi variety platter. My favorite item on the platter was the soft-shell crab roll. I highly recommend it! Very unique and delicious. The Wasagi Twist (bacon wrapped scallops and steak) is also very good. It's not too heavy and not too spicy, a lot of flavor. There are many other delicious items on the menu, and I will be back to try more.The atmosphere here is probably not what you would expect from a sushi restaurant. It's like an over-done seafood chain decor. Look past the decor, the food is worth it.Robongi is BYOB... so bring beer, sake, or your favorite bottle of wine!
2011-08-05,4,The best sushi you will find in the area (and believe me, I've had a lot of sushi in this area). Very fresh and well made. Service is attentive as well. My dad and I went here for dinner and went to town. The only con to this place is the atmosphere. During off times its great... But at night it takes on a night club appearance with BLASTING music. I couldn't hear the person next to me. And the space is a bit cramped so that is no small feat. When my Dad comes to town it is the first place we look to go.... unless its during peek hours.
2011-08-05,3,this place was packed on a tues night! they have ok-tasting sushi but fresh & the pieces are huge. food is reasonably priced. atmosphere is casual and fun. great service.
2011-07-27,2,The sushi here is slightly expensive, but I guess everything in the NY area is. I ordered the zaru soba which had a slight sesame infused flavor to it which was surprising and delicious. I also ordered the black yellowtail roll and the eel roll. The rolls were okay they weren't as cold as I would have liked, but they were decent.
2011-07-27,1,Terrible place. Food is not better than rolls you can buy at Walmart. Terrible food not fresh at all (I can tell by ordering Uni). Very loud inside (date can be ruined just with that), decor looks more like a Boston seafood restaurant than a japanese one. Staff is rude and pushy so that you end your meal quickly. Very expensive considering the bad quality and small quantities served. If you want to eat real Japanese food go to either Illuzion in Hoboken, Mitsuwa food court in Edgewater or St-Marks place restaurants between 2nd Ave and 3rd Ave in Manhattan. This place is very bad and not recommendable.
2011-07-26,4,Loud fun atmosphere for a party inside. Outdoor seating is great for warmer weather. Byob is always appreciated and the servers really pay attention to your alcohol. Waiters are friendly and attentive.  Sushi is fresh, and a great value. This is My fave sushi place in Hoboken!  Whenever my family comes to visit, we'd dine here for our sushi fix. Indoor is fun, but too loud to really talk to a person 1 seat away from you. Expect people to dance in their dining seats while drinking their wine and eating edamame.
2011-07-18,5,Best sushi I've had so far.  No matter if I order it for delivery or dine in the restaurant it has exceeded every other sushi place I have gone to in Hoboken by a large amount.
2011-07-16,5,This is a great little spot to start off your night. I personally go on nicer evenings where you can sit outside since the inside is very small and can get very hot. Its a BYOB (liqour store within walking distance) and has enough sushi rolls to satisfy anyone. I've been with friends who are not fans of sushi and they were able to pick something from the menu that they loved every time.
2011-07-16,4,The salmon skin appetizer was very good. It was crispy, had skin stripes with a lot of meat on them, and the portion was big. The staff was 100% great. They even went so far as to charge our low battery mobile. When they found out one of us had a food allergy they double checked all of the orders. I would totally go back. Tasty fresh and wonderful service.
2011-07-12,4,Friend of mine who's lived in Hoboken for many years was skeptical about sushi in NJ since she doesn't eat much of it.  I decided to roll with it since I wanted a light dinner, watching the fireworks over July 4th weekend in Hoboken's "beach".  Ordered the chirashi sushi with brown rice to take out and it was heavy as a brick - better be for $20.  And I'll be honest, it was quite good and I actually saved extra the soy sauce packets.  Dine outside because the decor inside is hideous.
2011-07-08,5,I love this place! I work about a block away so I come here pretty often. The Iso roll is definitely my favorite. Everything else I've tried was delicious too. The staff is always very nice and pleasant.
2011-07-03,1,Mediocre food.  Hideous decor.  Self-satisfied management eager to surcharge you.Go to Illuzion.
2011-07-03,4,The sushi here is phenomenal and the options pretty much endless.  My wife enjoyed her rock shrimp as well.  The loud techno beat gets a little much but the place has a cool vibe to it.  To avoid having to talk over the music, sitting outside is always an option.  I like the BYOB rules of lots of restaurants in Hoboken.  Saves a bunch on the drink bill and you get exactly what you want.  It helps that there are liquor stores along Washington street interspersed among the myriad dining spots!  The decor is really funky cool and the service is outstanding.  We've been here on successive visits to the area and will definitely return in the future!
2011-07-02,3,There's variety at this place. I loved the spicy tuna salad. I had a few other rolls and the shrimp tempura.  It was a typical sushi place for me. It was a little pricey.
2011-06-26,4,They get a 3.5 for food and a 5 for service. Apps  of wasabi sumai , full taste and just the right amount of wasabi, and edamani  overly top salted but fine once things were tossed to better mix the beans.  Sushi was fresh and fish was creamy in a good way.  Rice was slightly undercooked but only a partial detraction.  Chicken teriaki also flavorful and not over cooked.  For a causal place service was excellent. all requests , for ice; lemon slices etc, were quickly and professionally handled.  Our take home was thoughtfully packed with packets of soy without having to request it.  Addt to this eating outdoors on a pleasant day, cant be beat.
2011-06-20,2,What a complete disappointment! I live in JC and am always looking for a good sushi place. I was excited to order from here after reading the reviews, but man, the food did NOT live up to the reviews. The tuna avocado roll was practically inedible, the tuna was slimy and squishy and altogether unpleasant. The yellowtail was bland at best. The eel cucumber was okay except for that they REALLY skimped on the cucumber. However, the only redeeming part of the meal, was the ISO Roll. This was actually excellent.Wouldn't order here from here again, ever. Honshu is better than this place for sure.
2011-05-28,5,Excellent, excellent sushi.  Fish is always fresh and roll combinations are interesting and yummy.  I've had their hot entrees and appetizers as well and those are equally good.  BYOB, so that makes me happy too....Inside - I admit it's loud and usually packed, but they are quick and friendly.  Prices are reasonable and outdoor seating during the summer is a huge plus.Must try - Rock Shrimp Appetizer and the Iso Roll (on the specialty rolls)
2011-05-26,5,Best delivered sushi I've had in Hoboken in a long time...got her in under 20 mins too!  Rolls were very fresh and fell apart a little, but I guess that means they're  not loaded down with crazy amounts of mayo.  Everything was so light and delicious!Maybe I just got lucky, but with the prices they charge something better be spectacular!
2011-05-24,4,I have gone here with my niece and my cousin for dinner a couple of times. It's so busy here, but there's a reason. It's delicious.reasonable prices for the food. i love the scallions wrapped with beef with this sauce.. it's delicious.they have fried ice cream and great sushi.
2011-05-21,3,This place has the best sushi in Hoboken, which is not to say it's great, but it's passable for those nights when you're too lazy to get something phenomenal from the city.  It won't make you crap your pants from some old scuzzy fish, that's good I guess.  Pros- BYO, cons- Club Robongi at night.
2011-05-04,4,Fantastic sushi at a fantasic price...only down side is the bad selection of pop house music blasting in the place. Service was always great and if they know you will always knock back a Saki bomb with you. Saki Saki Saki BOMB!
2011-04-18,4,Lunch here is filling! the music they play will bring you back to the 90's. The place its self reminds me of a burger shack but its sushi and rice bowls. I did come for dinner one time but it is better to come for lunch... lots of food for about half the price. note: its a bit dark inside so when you come out and its bright outside be prepared, your eyes will burn!
2011-04-17,2,eh is all I can say.  People need to venture in the city if they want real sushi.  My wife got lost and had to use restroom and she went to basement on accident and she saw 10 beds down there.  I guess they live here too?  It's just Sushi, nothing more.  Our waiter was very touchy feely, we didn't like that.
2011-03-30,4,It's on my block so I go a lot. Great place to have a fun dinner. Sushi is good and sometimes great!  BYOB makes it a special treat.
2011-03-18,4,I hate crappy, generic music.  This includes anything where the artificial bass line dominates the music.  Why is this relevant?  Because Robongi takes their amazing sushi menu and hides it under a CONSTANT, BLARING SYMPHONY OF BAD MUSIC.Rant aside, the sushi here is absolutely phenomenal.  It didn't matter if it was rolls, sashimi, or seaweed wraps.  We brought our own sake and they knew just how to prepare it for us.  The eel wraps we had for "dessert" perfectly capped off the night.This restaurant would absolutely get 5 stars if it wasn't for the terrible, loud music.  I don't know about you, but I prefer being able to hear the people I'm eating with.  I fully recommend Robongi as long as its not the peak hours.
2011-03-03,2,I was really hoping to love this place. Maybe I hyped it up in my head. I don't quite get the "theme" (pictures don't lie) to Robongi. Walking up to the front door, the first thing I noticed was the sign that says, "hot fat crabs"... I don't know about the rest of you, but that doesn't scream appetizing to me. But the reviews are pretty good for this place, so I was willing to forget about it and just eat. We ordered fried rock shrimp as an appetizer, which was very good. Sadly, the entrees were simply lacking. Unfortunately, the rice with the sushi deluxe was not sticky enough and crumbled upon contact. This should not happen with sushi. Our other entree was an eel cucumber wrapped special chef roll. It was slightly warmer than room temperature, inconsistently wrapped and oddly sized. If that doesn't sound too good to you then I described it well. Hoboken is a tiny, parking lot of a city, but it has a plethora of dining gems. This isn't one of them. At least, not that afternoon.
2011-03-03,3,DISCO SUSHI!!!!!!!!This place is LOUD.  And that can either be a good thing, or a bad thing.  This is NOT the place for a first date - you'll end up spending the whole night saying "WHAT? ".  This is a great place for a group of friends to get together / pre-game / whatever.   First off, its BYO, and they make no qualms about it.  Expect to see lots of ex-frat / sorority folks drinking HARD (and screaming over the music).  The deÃÅcor (kitchy, crab shack-esque) just seems to lend itself to that sort of behavior (and it's not a bad thing if you're in the mood for that).The food: spot on.  Great sushi. Large rolls (never seem to be a problem), fresh fish, plentiful appetizers.  I would say second best sushi in Hoboken (give the slight edge to Sushi House - Uptown). So, in summary, depending on your mood, this is the great place, or a way too loud frat party.  Either way, the sushi is legit.
2011-02-21,4,The decor of this place reminds me of a shack on the beach or something. It's filled with an assortment of sea-themed objects, and I enjoy the quarky-ness. My friends and I didn't stay in to eat though, we ordered food to go. Whilst waiting they brought us water and also miso soup to warm up (it was a cold day). The people there were super nice! We didn't wait long either, it was just a few minutes before the food came.I got the chirashi and also a black yellowtail roll. I also tried a couple of my friends' rolls - one was the Rock'n'Roll and the other was something that had calamari in it. The rolls all tasted delicious and fresh. The sashimi in the chirashi also tasted fresh, and I enjoyed the sauce that was on the rice. I also like how the tako was thinly sliced and thus crunchy and not chewy. I thought Robongi was quite good, and according to my friend who lives in Hoboken, it's the best sushi place in town and quite consistent.
2011-02-18,3,I have only gotten delivery from Robongi but it has been hella inconsistent.  Sometimes the rolls are really freaking good and sometimes they're falling apart and/or fishy tasting.  I have noticed it usually is at lunchtime that they're lacking.  For instance, today my cucumber avocado roll was basically browning smashed avocado and two little shreds of cucumber.  And literally fell apart when I tried to pick it up.  Salad with ginger dressing and miso soup are both standard but not stand-out.  Maybe dining in is a better option?  Regardless, I'd recommend sticking with an evening meal vs mid-day since I could easily have bumped up the rating if I had only had my dinner experiences.
2011-02-14,5,I LOVE Robongi!! Always super busy, but they do a great job of getting everyone seated. The music can be a little loud at times, but it creates a fun atmosphere. When we did have to wait a bit (in a larger group) we were given green tea and edamame to hold us over.The sushi is always super delicious, and the BYOB aspect of the restaurant is amazing. The service is always great.
2011-02-14,3,This is the weirdest sushi spot Hudson County and possibly North Jersey can offer.The fish and seaweed are both fresh and delicious.  You truly get great sushi here.  But the ambiance is weird.The servers are not in your face about buying more or pressuring you to try something, but then again they came around very rarely.It has a little bit more of a fishy scent than normal.  They also just hit you with random stuff on your table that leaves you wondering if you drank way too much even though you haven't had a single drink.Also, the sushi was good, but the prices are a little much. Not crazy expensive, but more than they should be charging.Finally, the weirdest thing about this place is their playlist.  They choose the most random 90's and present combination of pop and gangster rap you have ever heard.
2011-02-02,5,On behalf of my friends and I who have been loyally dining for 8 years, Robongi's is the kind of place you come back to again and again.  Great sushi, fun atmosphere, nice service, and it isn't rare to get a free treat here and there.  It would be great for a date although we've always gone in large groups and had a very fun time.
2011-01-27,4,First time dining in Hoboken, & I still have unanswered questions from that night:"Why are the walls covered with funky shark decor?" - shark meat not served.  visually reminiscent of a Joe's Crab Shack"Where did the chocolate cake come from?" - presented to us after our meal was finished.  Is it because we spent a pretty penny here?  I'm more curious as to why chocolate cake, and not green tea ice cream?  My theory: someone's leftover birthday cake.  Hey, I'll take it."This is Hoboken??" - Honestly, I don't expect a lot of good things from this state.  Thriving on a Monday night.  Fresh sashimi & tasty rolls.  Robongi is a shocker.
2011-01-19,3,I wanted to find a sushi place to eat in hoboken and saw this place got some pretty good reviews on yelp.  It was byob and we picked up some beers at the liquor store a few blocks away.  We got there around 6:30.  The place is small and wasn't packed but it looks like there were party reservations cos they ended up seating us in the front near the door.  The decor is very nosy/dark with lots of fish nets, streamers, signs, etc which is different and I think they were trying to go for like a marina/street vendor look.  We got the gyoza and robongi crab cake which we thought was good.  Then we ordered the seafood comb teriyaki, rainbow and lobster roll.  I was expecting good sushi rolls but was pretty disappointed just the way they were presented.  The rolls were chef specials but they were 6 small pieces and rolled as if they squeezed too hard making the rice compacted with very minimum ingredients in them.  Maybe it was just that one sushi chef because I saw other people's meal and they look much better.  As we were eating, they were squeezing people in...ie. a couple, baby, stroller and highchair next to us in the small space in front of the window which was pretty annoying cos they were having a hard time situating themselves but it was a Friday night.
2011-01-13,5,I love this place! Probably go at least 2 or 3 times a month. I've gone in small groups and large groups and the service is always wonderful. Ivan the Manager is the BEST! I always feel welcomed even when they are super busy. The sushi is delicious- I've tried most of the menu at this point and everything has been excellent. On top of the great food, the atmosphere is always fun and energetic. See you soon Robongi!!
2011-01-02,4,I personally think Robongi serves the best sushi in Hoboken. Certainly first on my list when it comes to dining in and taking out sushi. The spicy yellowtail roll is fantastic and certainly a favorite.Inside, it's narrow, but the decor is pretty cool -- lots of fish, nets, and marine fare on the walls. One deterrent would be a little too much noise, not just from other diners, but from loud music pumped in through the restaurant's sound system.
2010-12-26,4,I've got these guys on speed-dial for delivery in Weehawken.  They are super-efficient, have my address and CC on file, and the food is awesome.  I love the lunch specials: the Oyako Don is heaven.  Hearty, filling, tasty; YUM.  You get a ton of excellent food for a great price.  Not that I'm all for piles of food, but piles of excellent food is a bonus.I highly recommend delivery.
2010-12-25,3,They have good sushi and their service is on point. They need a bigger selection though and the pirate decor kind of throws me off. Not the type of place you bring a nice date to but you can't beat the prices.
