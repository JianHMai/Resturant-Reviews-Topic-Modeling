2021-10-27,5,Margarita pizza and the fried chicken wings was to die for !! I got the Buffalo wing sauce on the side. Would definitely come here again. They have both indoor and outdoor ample seating. Great customer service as well. Worth it!
2021-09-21,1,Why is there rarely a normal transaction anymore?!?! . 2 giant slices priced on the slice app $5.90 ($2.95 each)Employee at Giovannis say $3.00 a slice (closeEnough)Get to register $7.90 for 2 slices  ($3.95 each)Tell the manager/owner guy the slice app has it for $2.95 and your employee just said $3 but you say $3.95? He says the app is wrong so I ask the guy who told me $3 and ... wait for it...... he suddenly doesn't speak English!!!  I say ok well I can check out with the app right now and pay $5.90 instead of $7.90 he says ok I will Charge you $2 more before  I give you the slices!  Food service is an absolute joke today. So sad. Hard Pass
2021-02-25,5,Was actually really good! I ordered the margarita, better than the place a few blocks down (which is usually great but the margaritas not so much). Giovanni's was crispy, tasty. I'll be back here.
2020-11-02,5,Excellent pizza!! I have been searching for great NY pizza and have finally found it. Their sauce is robust, the cheese is very thick and rich, and the vegetable toppings were fresh! They were very friendly and appreciated the business, and let me use my charge card because I did not have any cash. This huge slice with vegetables was $3.95--much lower and of better quality than some of the other nearby places.
2020-09-13,5,I have to be honest: I came here with no expectations and left completely amazed. First of all, Leo (our server) is the kindest and friendliest human i've encountered while in COVID times. We arrived an hour before they closed and he greeted us with open arms and sat us outside. The night was lovely and the food arrived within 10-15 minutes. The chicken parm is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The mozzarella sticks were AMAZING and crunchy (very rare to find around the area tbh) and the penne a la vodka made me regret not having a bigger stomach. Leo was really attentive and we will definitely return.
2020-09-09,5,I came here yesterday with my daughter. The restaurant was very clean, the pizza was GREAT, and the staff was sooooo friendly! We will be back! Thank you Giovanni! Five stars no doubt!
2020-07-06,5,All I gotta say is their eggplant parm is to dieeee for. From the spaghetti to the texture of the eggplant and the sauce, sooooo GOOD
2020-04-14,5,If you are looking to fix a craving for chicken parm or some sort of pasta dish this is a great place to get your fill! I've ordered from the fancy places and then I'm just left thinking - why didn't I just order from giovannis?!? The sauce is yum and plenty of cheese on the chicken parm it's the definition of comfort food.
2020-03-01,5,I went for the first time and I was pleased with the vegan options. I had the veggie sandwich with eggplant, red peppers and mushrooms with balsamic vinegar. The bread was amazing. Our server was great! Did not have a long wait time for a Saturday night. I wish I took pictures but the food was that great.
2020-02-04,4,I ordered from here for the first time during the Superbowl, knowing fully that it would be a busy night and delivery would take longer than typical.  I ordered a vodka meatball pizza, and a vodka chicken parm hero.Two hours later, our food had not yet arrived.  I called to check on the status, and they said it was on the way.  Another hour passed and I called again, this time they apologized profusely, saying there was a mix up and the order never went out.  They offered to either refund us, or get us the food asap.  We were hungry, so we said no problem just deliver it as soon as you can.20 mins later the food was delivered - as an apology, they gave us an extra pizza, order of mozz sticks, and penne vodka.  I was very impressed with their customer service, we definitely feel like they made an effort to make up for their error.All in all, the food was great and I would definitely order from them again!  Worth the wait!
2020-01-21,4,Giovanni's the best by the slice pizzeria in town. There's good crisp to each bite. It's not too hard from the reheating, but has just enough firmness there to get the right texture. They tend to heat each slice extra hot, which is great for getting the cheese melty, but don't just dive right in because you might burn your tongue. The sauce holds up through the cooking as well, and delivers a moistness without creating sogginess. Ultimately, this all makes for a really balanced slice. We got a nice harmony of gooey rich cheese, moist sauce, and spot on crunchy crust. I'll load up on oregano, garlic powder, and chili flakes, since I find the slice lacking in flavor by itself. Other than that, I'll say that their slices are one of the most consistent I've ever seen, and that the service has always been efficient and respectful. Definitely skip the other by the slice joints, and I'd even recommend skipping the fancy gourmet and neopolitan pizzerias in town. You'll be happy with Giovanni's.
2019-11-23,5,Pizza what to say about pizza? Well for greatness one most be consistent. I actually found a pizzeria with consesty, fresh quality ingredients, an great service in Hoboken! It's Giovanni's @ 603 Wasington st. Not only great pizza but the best fresh cut to order fried Calamari I have had! Excellent Chicken pram, Chicken franceses..!  Super duperly known for the best vodka sauce ( world wide according to Stevens students) an also other patrons have mentioned it to be the best they ever tryed!  Anyway all I know is its a very pleasant delicious stop with family , or a handful of friends or on your own. Comaraderi is there key to success!!!! BYOB... Check it out
2019-10-27,5,The food here so awsome and the service is amazing they are very friendly and wonderful people I love coming here with my husband. I will continue coming here i highly recommend people to come here i wish can give them 10 instead of 5
2019-08-26,4,Fresh and delicious garden salad, not fancy just very tasty.  Tried the Toscano chicken sandwich in a wrap, moist and very, very good.  The vodka sauce on the chicken vodka parm sandwich was the star of the meal.  Will come back, great place and nice servers
2019-07-07,1,I ordered this pizza a couple weeks ago. It was horrible. The pizza WAS NOT CUT! THIS PLACE SUCCCCKKKS! It was under cooked, and had the cheese stuck to everything except the dough.
2019-06-30,5,love this family owners restaurant. Old school and no frills atmosphere. I continuously order the chicken francais which is the best I've had in Hoboken. The penne vodka is also really good. The serving sizes and prices are great. The pizza is decent as well for the price.
2019-05-01,5,My boyfriend and I stopped in to give them a try. We were greeted immediately and told we can sit wherever we like. They weren't busy on a Wednesday afternoon which was nice. Our waiter was very attentive! Great service! We ordered the fried calamari, spaghetti with meatballs and marinara sauce, and the homemade lasagna. The calamari arrived hot and they were cooked perfect! Great flavor, not chewy. Nice crunch. The marinara is very good here! I like it better than Benny Tudino's. The spaghetti and meatballs were also cooked perfect. The spaghetti was al dente, and the meatballs were flavorful and held together perfectly. The lasagna...10/10! Delicious!! Def want to eat more of it. The cheeses were amazing! So fresh. Everything came out hot and in a timely manner. Cost is great too! Not bad and totally worth it! We will be back to try more menu items. Highly recommend the lasagna!!
2019-03-20,5,My place to get that pizza slice hitta when in the 'boken. Strolling down Washington with them hunger pains, pop in to Giovanni's for that warm piece of triangle dough, covered in the necessary accouterments.
2018-12-26,5,After a long day of Ellis and Liberty Island We walked around Hoboken trying to find something we all wanted to eat. Giovanni's was great service, very clean and great food.
2018-08-07,4,Two pretty good items. I tried a half veggie half pepperoni pie plus a vodka Parm sub. Both were above average. The pizza however is not "fancy" pizza. It is "football" eating pizza. If that makes sense to you , wonderful. If not, better luck next time! The vodka Parm sub was extremely hot(even with delivery) delivery took about 45 minutes-standard. While I did really enjoy this pizza,  I'm not sure if it stood out from other pizzerias. Don't get me wrong, I would still order from here! But will continue to try more pizzerias
2018-07-04,5,Best pizza I ever eaten, I travel the world trying all kinds of pizza and this one is the best and a great price, owner very friendly, he take a lot of pride on making a tasty and delicious pizza, I will recommend to everyone to try H&S Giovanni's restaurant. You will not regret it.
2018-06-16,1,Pizza literally is so dry and taste like cardboard. A group of my friends and I literally got all different kinds of slices, and they all tastes so bad, we just threw them out.
2018-05-29,4,Alright so the pizza has definitely gotten better. The men who work there are also great guys and always know what to say and how to help. Favorite pie is ricotta with broccoli rabe and sausage
2018-05-10,5,Update: The owner Sergio called me and apologized to me about my not liking the pizza. He offered to make me a satisfied customer again. He made me a large vodka pie free of charge. I can't say enough about how delicious it was and not because it was free. This is the Giovanni's I loved all these years & will be ordering from them again. I changed my rating back to 5 stars. Thanks Sergio for making me & mom a happy customer see you againJaime So disappointed in Giovanni's the past 2 months. This was the only Pizzeria I order from since the day they opened. The Pizza was delicious & so was their other food. I asked one of the guys that work there if there was a new owner because they never had the signs on the window say The Original H&S Giovanni's he told me no. Last month I order a cheese pizza tonight I order a Pesto pizza. The crust was thick & doughy and had no taste. It was never like that before. Either there is a new owner or the guy who made the pizza is not there anymore or they are buying another type of pizza dough. Sorry to say I will not be ordering from there anymore.
2018-04-26,5,Awesome!  Daughter got a slice of pepperoni pizza, hubbie got meatball sandwich and I got spaghetti with Marinara.  OMG!  It was great!  Definitely recommend going there!
2018-03-09,5,Love the chicken pizza and quick dilivery. The staff is always great and foos is fresh.
2018-03-09,5,Great Pizza place! I had the Chicken Buffalo Ranch Pizza, must try :) I am a stickler for pizza and would defiantly recommend this place
2018-03-02,5,Great food and delivery through Seamless was earlier than the estimated delivery time.
2018-02-22,3,Reliable pizza and service. Good prices but recently raised everything, at least the hot subs. Slices are larger than the average slice.
2018-02-17,5,Very big fan of this place, I have ordered several things from here and everything's been very good. They are great at communicating and call you to make sure they're making your order correctly. Pizza is delicious and the mozzarella sticks are awesome
2018-02-14,5,Big fan of Giovanni's! I have become even more of a fan lately, when I noticed other Italian restaurants in Hoboken are shrinking their portion sizes and raising their prices. Gio's consistently has good quality food, large portions and fair prices. Also, the eggplant parm is amazing.
2018-02-11,4,My favorite pizza in Hoboken! The penne alla vodka pie is amazing. Chicken, bacon, ranch is super popular as well (I'm not a ranch person myself). My favorite is the baked ziti by the slice, definitely recommend trying Gio's!
2018-01-15,5,This is my go-to for pizza delivery. They're always quick and friendly, and the pizza is solid. I think the sauce they use has a little more kick than most places in town, which helps set them apart from the crowd. Besides the pizza, these folks make a mighty fine meat lasagna too!
2017-11-10,5,Excellent pizza! The ziti slice was loaded with pasta! Thin crunchy crust to die for!
2017-04-23,5,Everything I've had from here has been really good.  Pizza, chicken parm, cheesesteak, Caesar salad-- pepperoni roll is probably my favorite. I think you'd be safe ordering anything on the menu. Quick delivery time and low minimum and no delivery charge on seamless.
2017-01-28,5,This is our go-to spot for a regular NY style pie in Hoboken, closely edging Mario's. Love Johnny Pepperoni's, Napolis, and Grimaldi's for the artisanal pies, but when you need that old school pizzeria slice, this is the place.
2017-01-02,5,I have to update my review now that they are on Seamless and ordering is a breeze! Delivery is quick and their chicken Caesar salad is amazing. My boyfriend said the chicken parm was excellent. Affordable and delicious- a go to spot for take out!
2016-10-18,5,I don't travel to Hoboken all that often, but when my girlfriend and I do decide to visit, usually to go to Dor L' Dor we eat here. Since the first time trying this pizzeria, we've both been hooked. Their pizza, calzones and heroes are all delicious and the bread when requested is very crispy. The workers are all very friendly and give great service. This is a place to go when looking to eat quality food on a budget.
2016-10-09,4,I always can depend on gios.   My husband and I go back and forth about Bennys versus this place and this place is the way to go to get a pie ---- Bennys too big. Solid pizza that is consistent and you can depend on.  Other good choices: mozzarella sticks delicious and I am a huge fan of their chicken rolls. I am now starving thinking about this!    Can't go wrong here folks.
2016-07-31,4,Took a gamble based on previous reviews.... my experience was great. Pizza was delivered hot and delicious. Perfect sauce vs cheese ratio and was delivered quickly about 35minutes. (Ordered at 6:30pm) Absolutely worth 4 stars... maybe even 4.5 for the quick delivery especially at that time!!
2016-06-13,4,My wife and I really enjoyed Giovanni's. We ordered a mushroom pizza to eat in. The seating area was very pleasant and the wait was quite reasonable. The pizza was excellent!! Especially the crust. Very thin and tasty. Could have had perhaps a bit more sauce as about one inch of crust was exposed all the way around the periphery.The staff was very friendly and anxiously to please. We had a nice conversation with one of the staff who was cleaning off tables. Another was very helpful with our requests for silverware and a box for leftovers.We will make it a point to visit again on our next Hoboken trip.
2016-05-05,5,This has been my go to pizza place in North Jersey for years, best pie outside of NY! This is definitely what pizza dreams are made of, and it's good enough to make a road trip for/drive out of your way.
2016-05-03,1,I ordered a half pepperoni and cheese pie for pickup. When I arrived at the store to pick it up, it was an all cheese pie. So of course I asked if I could still get the half pepperoni on the pie. That's when it all went wrong and the man behind the counter (which I believe was Gio himself), proceeded to get the pepperonis with his bare hands and slap them on the pizza. Then he handed me the pie... Confused as to how a place thats highly regarded could be unsanitary like this. Was VERY disappointed.
2016-04-19,3,I've eaten here on a number of occasions and just recently catered a lunch at my office with them. They are one of the few places open at 10AM which makes them ideal for a lunch catering event. Spen claimed that they made every kind of pizza there is but my requests for a Grandma Pie and another Broccoli Rabe Pie were contradictorily denied. Confuse me?? Anyway, they do have a decent selection. I would recommend their mushroom and sausage pie. Not a blow you away kind of place but the price is also quite fair.
2016-03-05,3,This is my college go to for a quick lunch or a late night slice.  I get the chicken slice from here.  There are many pizza places in Hoboken and this one is always consistent.
2016-02-01,1,The pizza is awful. The olives were bad.   The cheese is garbage.  We ordered chicken fingers for the kids,  they sliced a chicken cutlet and called it chicken fingers and charged $8.  The kids refused to eat more than one slice of pizza because of how bad it was.   And on top of that,  you get the worst attitude from the owner.
2016-01-29,4,Ceaser salad is soo good, can use a little bit more fresh lettuce but still good. And the pizza is better then Tonys accros the st. Its crispy, justthe right amount of sauce. Def recommend
2016-01-29,1,Prices should be accurate & staff should wear gloves or wash hands before handling a slice of pizza after touching money or the register which is full of germs.
2015-12-23,5,There's a lot of great pizza in Hoboken, but this is probably my favorite when I'm just looking for a classic pepperoni New York style slice.Also, I totally love their Chicken Parmesan.  It's probably the thing I order most in town.
2015-12-20,4,The Chicken Parmesan was great, tender chicken, great tasting sauce and just the right amount of cheese. On another meal, the meatballs looked weird but had great taste. Fresh greens for their salad. All in all a good family restaurant.
2015-09-28,4,I order delivery from here at least 2-3 times a month.  I am obsessed with their vodka pie, I get it well done.  It is nice and crisp and the cheese is melted perfectly.  Delivery is always fast and easy.
2015-09-07,1,Wow. 0 stars if I could. We were quoted a 30 minute delivery. Over two hours and fifteen minutes later, we finally got the order.Cheesesteak was terrible. Mozzarella sticks were soggy. Pasta was decent. Just be honest about delivery times! Never again.
2015-09-06,1,Horrible! The worst pizza I have ever eaten! Dry, bland and like cardboard! This place had the nerve to charge 4 dollars for a slice, talk about price gauging! Benny just died and this place wants to capitalize for shame! I will never go in or visit this rip off place again....and as for the people they are unfriendly and not respectable....... I don't know how people can give them a 5 star rating!
2015-08-29,3,Sorry had to knock off a star. Pizza the last few times not good. This last time the guy on the phone was very rude. I had an issue with seamless and thought the order didn't go through. So I called and ordered and then the delivery guy came back again with the same exact order 5 minutes later. Wouldn't you check that first? Insane and the guy didn't apologize for the mixup just told me to call seamless for refund.
2015-06-20,4,The best true pizza pies in Hoboken, unless you're looking for margherita style pizza (look to Grimaldi's, Napoli's, or Tony Baloney's for that).This would be a five star review if they didn't serve anything else on the menu besides pizza, but you can get a multitude of Italian dishes here that are pretty decent. However, they don't compare to their fresh pizza pies.
2015-06-14,1,The food is absolutely garbage. The pasta is way to creamy and tastes like its microwaved. The chicken tastes like someone ate it and then threw it up again.  I had diarrhea right after I ate this and my girlfriend had food poisoning. I'm never going to this place again and neither should YOU.BTW I saw the chief dig his nose
2015-06-08,5,Best slice in town... Chicken parmigiana slice! Extra crispy with a side of sauce for doing the crust. Mangia!  Guys that work there are great owners and nice guys, glad they are doing well and expanding. Definitely worth a stop in!
2015-05-29,3,Buyer beware!!!As far as pizzeria's go - this is a perfectly acceptable establishment.  I took out of town guests, folks that are native to the NJ area but moved away about 30 years ago, for a good pizzeria experience.  We were not disappointed - the veal cutlet parm was amazing! We kept joking with the staff that we were out of towners (I am not!).  When we went to pay the bill we quickly realized we were being over-charged.  We pointed out the error, received an apology and an adjustment.  The gent working the register tacked on about $2.00 to each item - maybe he forgot to give us the Tourist menu ;-)
2015-04-22,5,I'm relatively certain I've been waiting my whole life to find pizza like this. I can't overstate how good their cheese pizza is. Get a whole pizza - not a warmed up slice - and see for yourself. Their prices are good, delivery is fast and food is really delicious (did I mention that yet?). I'm surprised they don't have a higher rating but all I can imagine is that the reviews are for sitting in the restaurant which, frankly, leaves something to be desired. It's a pizza shop, ya know now? Anyway, do yourself a favor and order a pizza and enjoy.
2015-04-15,3,It's a great slice when you need one! And the delivery/takeout pizza was super flavorful. Loved the spinach and onion topping.However, the takeout pie was a little small for a large. I like a big, wide Jersey pie, ya know? Even if it's thin. Can't help it.So - I'll be back in a pinch.
2015-03-09,1,Wow, wish I could this place ZERO stars. Yes, granted it was a late night order, but that doesn't mean you can give me burnt bread with no cheese on it and call it pizza! Also, I'd appreciate it when I call you dont tell me that the delivery guy "just left", EVERY 30 minutes I called to check on the status. Just be honest and say "it'll take 1.5 HOURS to deliver".
2015-02-22,4,Was visiting a friend on a snowy Saturday  and wanted to order a pizza to be delivered. Found Giovanni's and called for delivery.  Pizza came in about 20 minutes and hot as it would be as if we ate it there. We enjoyed it and would recommend this place to all .
2015-02-10,5,One of the best pizza by the slices in Hoboken.  I see a lot of reviews are saying to go to Benny Tudino's which serves a good slice but I prefer Giovannis.Also try the Sicilian slice which is also one of the best in town.
2015-02-09,4,Very decent pasta in the area. I've tried a few of their dishes and have no complaints.  Their slices are pretty big and tasty . Delivery has never taken long. The staff is pretty pleasant over the phone. I will continue ordering from here.
2015-01-18,1,If you like rude service and overpriced pizza this is your place.After giving Gios plenty of opportunities to change my mind, I've had it. The pizza is alright but can be on the dry side. I've noticed they have a smug attitude and don't cater well to customers needs. I left one star because they do stay open very late.
2014-12-30,1,I want to start in saying that Giovanni's was my go to pizza place for delivery in Hoboken. After tonight though, this will be no longer.  I ordered a pizza over 2 and a half hours ago and as I'm writing this I am still waiting for my pizza.  Now I understand that there can be glitches, and that tonight one of their drivers had an accident. Of course there will be delays with that happening. What I cannot accept is that the person on the phone when I have called to inquire about where my pizza is has hung up on me twice. Stating "what do you want me to do? The pizza will get there when it gets there" and then hangs up on me.  The food service industry is about customer service.  When something happens to your service, you should be apologizing and seeing what you can do to make things better for your customers, not hanging up on them.  Never again. I'm very disappointed.
2014-12-03,2,I wish I could give it a 2.5 instead of a mere 2? C'mon Yelp! Let's make half stars happen  already!Me and the fiancé came here late one drunken night. I wasn't blown away by anything, but nothing was bad either. We got two subs, but I can only speak for the chicken parm that I had. Eh! Their late night hours are definitely convenient, especially in a city that's surrounded by bars. I'd say go here for a late night snack, particularly since not many eateries are open at the time. The garlic bread was worth a nod. Next time, maybe I'll try the pizza.
2014-11-26,3,Had a lasagne there tonight and it was good.  Pizza isn't great, I wish a place like this that has the decor and location of an epic piZZA spot would be better.
2014-10-26,4,Came here yesterday while visiting my brother and his family in Hoboken.  The white pizza was great.  Perfectly executed crust and lovely and fresh cheese.  Next time, I hope to grab a slice from the HUGE array of options in the case.  Friendly service.  I will be back!
2014-08-28,2,The pizza is a tad bit pricer then other pizza shops in the area one guy in particular is pretty rude to customers which is a huge turn off
2014-08-15,1,I come here every night for food. Tonight, 1Hour before closing, they told me they can't turn the grill on to make grilled chicken for my Caesar salad because they turned the grill  off. Only fried. One hour before closing, really? I live right above them. Bye.
2014-08-13,1,This establishment is terrible. Customer service is always poor. Every time I've ordered from them I've gotten rude people on the phone who rush you. And the last time there was a bug in my pasta. See the picture. Never coming here again.
2014-08-10,2,Hate to write this review since my kids actually like the pizza- this review is more for eating in, the establishment and the service there. In a town where families are becoming all the more prevalent, it's sad when you find a place that really frowns upon groups with kids.  We had 6 kids with us and 2 strollers.  From the get-go they were very clear they were annoyed with our group and immediately asked us to bring our strollers outside, which we were happy to oblige with (even though there were only 2 other tables occupied).  The server was okay- nothing to write home about.  We had 9 people at the table and she brought 4 cups for water and asked if that would be enough, Humm? Pizza was good- nothing crazy better than what you'll find at other hoboken pizza places.  About 3/4 of the way through our meal, another worker came over to us and demanded we move our strollers because they needed us to seat people where they were and basically told us how careless we had been with where we put them.  There's a nice way and a rude way to do that, let's just say it certainly could have been done nicer.  At this point, we just weren't feeling the love from the place and felt really unwanted, we asked for the check and we left.  Oh, and by the way, there was plenty of seating out front, the area where our strollers were was totally empty, only a table for 2 was occupied on the opposite side of the patio.  Anyway, lesson here is eat out elsewhere or have them deliver to you so you can enjoy the pizza on your own turf.  There are plenty of other pizza places in hoboken that actually appreciate paying customers and their kids. Fail.
2014-07-20,1,Horrible pizza. Especially after hours. They take advantage of the late night customer. For instance.... Check out my pic
2014-07-14,5,The Pizza is well cooked.  I don't usually like pizza crust but I cant help to devour the whole slice when it's from Gios!
2014-06-21,5,Giovanni's has easily the best combination of price and and quality in Hoboken. I order from here all the time. It's my go-to pizza spot. They are consistent, fast and friendly. I generally get the chicken parm dish (which you can order without pasta for less!), and cheese garlic bread. Their pizza is also very good; it's on par with most New York pizzerias (a positive!). Their sauce is excellent.Their delivery is quick. They rarely get anything wrong, and when they do, they will correct it right away. To illustrate, they once forgot a can of diet coke in my order. I called up, and 15 minutes later, somebody was at my door with it. I've never dined in, but I have picked up my food in person. It's a pizzeria, not a sit-down restaurant. Are there better places? Yes there are, but you'll pay at least 50% more for food that is only slightly better and will take much longer to get to you.
2014-06-15,1,My experience at Giovannis started well with an easy online ordering process through GrubHub. Unfortunately, that's where it ended. Although our order consisted of a decent tasting calzone and side salad, our stuffed shells (w/ meatballs) were not only frozen from a box, but taste like chemicals and / or soap.  We called to talk to the owner, who stated that, "I know what my food tastes like, what do you want me to do about it?".  He then said if we insisted on  something to be done, to bring the food back in.  Since I live only a few short blocks away, I walked the food back. Surprised to see me, the owner didn't even look at the food but patted me on the back and threw some money in my hand, telling me to move along and not make a scene in front of the patrons.  He refused to take constructive advice or listen to what happened. All around I experienced horrible service, a horrible experience, and an absolutely horrible stomach ache.  I would strongly suggest going to one of the many other Hoboken Pizza & Italian restaurants over this any day.
2014-06-14,5,Best pizza hands down in Hoboken. Get the thin crust plain and you won't be dissapointed. While their chicken and pasta dishes are decent I think they can be skipped so one can save more room for pizza.
2014-04-29,4,I like Gio's. Between here and the other immensely popular pizza locale in Hoboken, I def like this place better. It's about the quality vs quantity. They're not too expensive, bout $3.50-$3.75 for a slice. Oh and also their zucchini sticks are to die for! So damn good. I'm actually sitting here now waiting for my food. Can't wait to nom it down!
2014-04-26,2,The battle of pizza places in hoboken between Gio's and Bennys is like Pats and Ginos for Cheese steaks in Philly.  Gio's pizza is average size with a light crispy crust.  Their prices are high for a pizza place and the staff is RUDE.  I have ordered pizza and the staff bothered me so much that I left my pizza on the counter and went across the street.  If you pay by credit card check your receipt or (Duck Bills for the college) because I have been overcharged more times than I would like to admit.  After dealing with the rude staff and check fluff my loyalty lies in Bennys across the street.  Sorry Gio's, maybe kindness would have helped.
2014-03-19,1,The customer service at this place is absolutely atrocious.  We've been tolerant of the man's rudeness because the food is pretty good, but after tonight, we will not be ordering from here again.The chicken sandwich we paid for was left out of the order and when we called to let them know, he YELLED at us.  "I HAVE NO BREAD.. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO TELL YOU"... excuse me?  You screwed up our order and now you're yelling at me?  We asked for a refund, and he said he wouldn't be able to figure it out on the credit card machine so we should just come in one day and he'll throw us something for free.  Instead we decided to get something else, which took another 45 minutes to come and then we spent 10 minutes on the phone with the delivery guy so he could find our apartment (which they were just at 2 hours ago).  ....place is ridiculous, not ordering again unfortunately.
2014-03-10,4,I ordered delivery from this Hoboken staple and the pizza was excellent.  I ordered a pepperoni pie and the delivery was on-time, the pepperoni pizza tasted great, the prices are very reasonable for the food you get.  I'd gladly recommend Giovanni's to any friends living in Hoboken.  There are plenty of pizza options for Hoboken residents and Giovanni's does a great job delivering good quality pizza at a reasonable price.
2014-02-08,4,I'll give credit where it's due, they make a decent pizza. I don't get how any self respecting Hobokenite will rate Gios above Napoli, but to each his own.Honestly, it can't hold a candle to Napoli. Somehow though I love Gios pizza. The sauce is really good, I wish there was more and they use quite a lot of cheese. The crust is usually pretty fluffy and bready but that adds to the deliciousness. The ultimate drunk food, it's actually pretty good when sober.
2014-01-21,3,Just moved to JC/Hoboken and need a "goto" pizza joint. Giovanni's was my first try. We ordered a large half cheese/half pepperoni & olive pie and an antipasta salad for delivery. While it was a decent enough pizza, it certainly wasn't anything earth shattering and provided no reason to stop my quest for the ideal local slice. The antipasta salad was pretty good, however, with a good variety of salad items like marinated cauliflower and carrots plus some tasty peppers and a decent quantity of meat. Delivery on a Sunday was pretty quick and the delivered fairly hot on a cold night. Giovanni's definitely wasn't a terrible experience but I have to believe that, in Mr. Sinatra's hometown, there has to be a better pizza.
2014-01-12,4,Pizza is good. Workers are nice. Clean bathrooms, nice eat in tables. Cannoli is good too! Coming here for years.
2014-01-02,5,They're food is delicious, they are fast at delivery. Chicken parm, meatball park, penne vodka are amazing. I'd recommend them
2013-12-06,4,Very good plain slice.   Nice sauce to cheese distribution and very tasty.
2013-12-06,5,This place has such good burgers. Seriously, they're like 2.50 and they're amazing. They are pretty small, no doubt - but they're tasty as heck and extremely filling! The Gio's burger is weird, but it's gooood. They also do a pizza burger that's good, and then their standard cheeseburger is just so freaking good! Yeah, I dunno. It's a pizza place and I've never had the pizza. XD At least I don't think, maybe I had it once when I wasn't paying attention. (People are probably reading this and thinking "what the heck?!?!?!") I order delivery from them every now and then (never been inside), and it's good! Nice and fast - I'm talking 20-30 minutes for the average order. That could be because I just order burgers. I have no idea how long a pizza takes, haha! Yeah so this is kind of a useless review for most people. 5 star burgers if you like small burgers, and fast delivery if you only order burgers! XD Still, I'm a fan of this place. =) Very glad it's around, it makes me happy. What can I say!
2013-12-04,5,Delicious pizza! Ordered an extra large plain pizza (which is too big for two people!). Enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day!  Was hot when it arrived. Will definitely order from here again. I didn't see them on seamless but ordering from yelp is fine. $10 min
2013-10-31,3,The pizza is very average and very expensive.  This is one of those situations where a business suffers from it location.  They have a lot of traffic because they are located at one of the entrances to Stevens campus, so they will sell a lot of pizza whether its good or not.  I have hear multiple people say they are going to run there because it the only place they have time to go between classes.
2013-10-01,1,I would not recommend this place!I stopped in for a quick slice on my way home one night. Not only was my slice 4 dollars but the man behind the counter only heated it in the oven for a good 30 seconds. He refused to put it back in to warm up for longer when I asked. As I sat eating my lukewarm slice, a group of young girls came in from Steven's complaining that they had ordered a pizza over an hour ago. Instead of offering to make the girls a new pizza on the spot he rudely told the girls to go back to their dorm and just wait longer for the delivery man. When my friend tried to help the girls so they wouldn't have to eat a cold pizza the man told her to mind her own business that he knew how to treat his customers.Needless to say, I will not be back with that kind of customer 'service'
2013-08-18,4,One of the best slices of pizza I have ever devoured. Slice was warmed to perfection, loaded with fresh motz and broccoli, and the crust was amazing. My friend is moving to Hoboken, and she dragged me to check it out and do some bar hopping. This was the perfect way to end a Sunday funday, and I'm glad she knew of this spot. Cash only, so I ended up having to pay for both slices and getting bitched out by her bc I'm a vegetarian and didn't want a bite of her pepperoni slice. Ha.. But seriously, go here if you're in Hoboken. You will not be disappointed and your pocket will thank you as well.
2013-07-27,3,Average pizza. Other menu items lacking as well. Benny's is right across the street, go there instead.
2013-05-07,3,A lot of high reviews which surprises me. It's good pizza, no doubt. Done in that typical NY thin crust style. Nothing all that special though. Their crust is worth noting. It's a different kind; a light thin crust variety. If that's your thing I guess? The sauce is bland though. Could really improve on that. Cheese is just average. Over priced at $3/slice.
2013-04-02,4,Gio's has OK pizza but their sandwiches are great!  Also, if you're in the mood for pasta the baked ziti and chicken parm over spaghetti are tasty. Delivery is prompt, which for pizza I consider 30 minutes or less prompt.  People taking orders over the phone are usually courteous.  Last time I ordered they forgot my 2 liter and the delivery guy was back in 5 minutes with it.  I was impressed.
2013-04-01,4,Quite possibly my favorite pizza place in hoboken. Their slices are enormous in their own right as is expected by the locals and they never disappoint. You won't find a crazy selection of toppings here if that's how you eat your pizza (although they have all the staples) but if you're looking for a great slice, I can't think of a better spot.
2013-03-29,4,Surprise surprise surrrrprise.  Good pizza here.  There are way to many average pizza joints in this town and this is one of the better ones.  The crust was really good...and thin, crispy, not too chewy which is perfect for me as I have no teeth.  Just kidding- I have lots of teeth and their all white!
2013-03-04,4,This review is for delivery only as we haven't had the chance to dine-in yet. I have had delivery from Giovanni's twice and so far both time have been exceptional. The pizza arrives warm, gooey, and perfect. Recently we ordered half pepperoni and half broccoli. The broccoli was fresh, still had a bit of a crunch to it which is a nice texture while the pepperoni wasn't dripping with grease.I've tried a lot of pizza around Hoboken and so far Giovanni's wins for me. The crust holds up nicely without being too chewy, the sauce isn't overly sweet or sugared-down, and the flavors balance well. The price is also great! Can't complain about two people getting four slices each for only $16 (with tax and tip). Incredible. I'm looking forward to actually dining-in so we can experience it fresh out of the oven.
2013-02-26,1,I will admit that I like their pizza A LOT. However, I have tried to order two other things recently.  The first was pasta and meatballs. I was given two TINY meatballs. Such a rip off for the price. The pasta was also really mushy. THe salad I got with it was way overpriced for its simplicity. THe second time I ordered recently, I ordered baked ziti. It was literally cold, mushy pasta with red sauce with cheese melted on top. There was no ricotta or cheese mixed in the pasta.  I am pretty sure I can make ziti with red sauce and melt cheese on it at home.  This was NO baked ziti. It was such a rip off for $10!  It was beyond disgusting.  The mozzarella sticks were also cold and rubbery when they arrived. I will order pizza somewhere else from now on because of my poor experiences lately.
2013-02-09,2,I really love their pizza when I walk in and buy a slice, but felt compelled to write a review now that this is the second time I've ordered delivery and there's been some sort of problem with my order.  First time they brought us the wrong toppings on our pie. This time it took over an hour to have our plain pie and side salad. We live 3 blocks away. The salad was so small it could barely feed one person, however I had ordered a large (which was clearly written on the order sheet that came with our receipt). After calling already to check on where our order was, after waiting an hour (to which the Italian guy who answered told me I was wrong and there was no way it could be an hour, even though I had checked on my phone the time is ordered and the current time, and it had been exactly one hour I waited to call), once I got the order and saw our tiny salad, I called back to complain.  The same guy got on the phone and told me that he only charged me for a small so "What was the problem?" Well the problem is that the salad was supposed to feed 2 people and it was barely enough for one.  He didn't seem the least concerned that the order was in fact wrong, so I told him this was the last time I'd be ordering from them, and he hung up on me!!! This is truly unfortunate because they actually make a pretty decent pizza.  However, their poor service and lack of concern for their customers really turned me off.  Hopefully they will read this and reconsider how they treat their customers in the future. Not good business fellas.
2013-01-25,3,Great for the pizza cravings that Hobokenites and Stevens students seem to get so often. They have a large variety of slice pies, ranging from veggie to ziti, that's right PASTA ON TOP OF PIZZA, sorry for everyone on the Atkins diet! All the slices are heated in their pizza oven before you get them and they have a nice signature crunchy crust that I love.
2013-01-11,4,Yummy and cheap pizza with soft oozing cheese, and a crispy bottom crust. Perfect to grab on the go.
2013-01-01,1,Great if the order is right, go hungry if they get it wrong...I ordered a 16" pie for my husband and I even after we were told it would take an 1hr, since we realized it is New Years Day and they are super busy. After 1.5 hrs my husband did call to ask when we could expect the pizza (ordere at 6.30pm - called at 8pm). The delivery came shortly after the call (8.15pm) just to find that they had sent us a personal pie. My husband called and the person on the other line started arguing with him that I had ordered a personal pie and he was right and we were wrong. Now why do you start arguing off the bat and why would I order a personal pie for my husband and I?! When my husband finally told him just that and that we would write a shitty review, he backed off and told him that, "I can get you a free pizza next time." My husband pointed out to him that we had waited 1.5hrs and were hungry now, but he refused to send the 16" pizza this time as they were busy... Really?! We wait 1.5hrs, they get the order wrong, then they make it our problem by being rude and arguing, and won't even do anything about it because they are too busy with other orders. So now we are sending the delivery guy back with the personal pie plus they are losing the business moving forward as we just ordered elsewhere...Not sure how that type of service or lack there of adds up... Too bad...
2012-08-01,5,Best pizza in Hoboken.  No contest.  Their white, chicken and ziti slices are excellent.  I also enjoy their calzones and rolls on occaision.  Even regular pasta dishes are quite good.  Much better than what you'd expect from a pizzeria.  They also expanded into the store next to them a few years ago, so there's almost always an open table.FYI, there is a $10 minimum for credit cards.If you want to stop by and grab a slice, sit down for a decent Italian dinner, or order a few pies for a party, Gio's is the place to go!
2012-06-05,3,Usually my first choice for pizza delivery in town.  The pizza is always consistently good.  It's not spectacular but I definitely enjoy it.  The anti-pasta salad is surprisingly really good.  They throw a ton of stuff into the salad and it's always fresh.The delivery service is mostly on time, and they're usually correct in their time estimates given over the phone.
2012-04-01,3,The pizza itself is good for Hoboken, probably the best if you're not going for brick oven. That said, it pales in comparison to just about every place across the river.But even if it's one of the better non-brick oven places in town, their delivery takes forever. They told me it'd be 10-15 minutes, which I repeated back to confirm, but when I called 35 minutes later asking what was up, they told me it'd be *another* 15 minutes and that "we always say 35 to 40 minutes." YMMV.
2012-03-25,5,I came into this place with a craving for Italian food.  Although one could describe this place a very casual, the food was still very good.  For about $10, I got a full chicken parmesan meal and a Sprite.  The sauce was perfect, not too thick, nor to thin.  The cheese over the chicken was also melted properly, just enough that if started to turn brown, but did not burn.  All in all, the meal was very satisfying, well priced, and did not have a long wait which is why I gave it five out of five starts.  Take note though,  this is a very casual restaurant.  They do what they do very well, but it is not a place to take someone if you are trying to impress them.  I would not recommend this place for a first date.
2012-02-09,2,Sorry I used to go here from time to time as an alternative to BTs. But.........the pizza here is REALLY average, but they have the nerve to charge 3$ for a slice. I guess they feel hey, BTs does it so can we. Well, I am no fan of Bts but at least for 3$ you get a big slice of bland pizza.
2012-01-14,5,On a freezing cold night, we parked our car in a (maybe I wont get a ticket) spot on washington street in Hoboken and ran to the closest restaurant to escape the harsh winter winds. Thankfully, this restaurant turned out to be Giovanni's. We order plain pizzas and chicken soup, all yummy and the service was better than what you would expect at a five star restaurant! I don't even like pizza that much!
2011-10-21,5,My favorite place to get pizza. Cheap prices and delicious!
2011-10-18,3,Giovanni's charged my out of town friends $40 for closing time slices of pizza. Ridiculous!Let me first explain that I used to like Giovanni's Pizza, I think it's probably in the top 5 in Hoboken, but what I don't like about this place was their willingness to take advantage of my inebriated friends. It breaks my heart that they went the greed route instead of showing generosity. Alot of pizza places around Hoboken will charge a high premium to late night customers. From Uptown pizza to 7 Stars, you know your paying way to much for something that's made for so little and lacks quality. Often times paying more than a whole pie would have cost, just for a few slices. Then comes Giovanni's which I recommended to people before this happened. Sadly I now lump them in with the places to avoid during pizza craving hours. With so many new spots opening up all over town, you can find a better place to get your pizza fix.
2011-10-12,4,One of my favorite slices in town: medium/thin, crispy crust, good amount of cheese and sauce, really good toppings.  Solid but not spectacular plates and heros are probably the least expensive in town.
2011-08-25,3,This place is great for getting a quick slice of pizza. Their crust isn't anything amazing, but it's fast and good for the price. I'd recommend their pasta slice.
2011-07-24,5,The fact that I have lived across the street from here for close to four years is probably the reason that I've been exercising more. This is hands down, the best pizza in town. I have yet to be disappointed by anything here-the Bianca slice, or white slice for you uncultured folk, is the best bianca slice I've had anywhere, and the Italian food is a cut above the rest as well. I highly recommend trying anything from the menu-they never fail, and the prices are pretty good too. The seating annex is nice and quaint, and there is a nice outside seating area too if the weather permits, and overall, the best pizza place in town-no contest.
2011-04-18,2,There is definitely a dearth of great pizza in Hoboken, but not necessarily good pizza. This was always how Giovanni's was described to me when I came around and asked someone about it. While it doesn't rank in any "best of" lists, this is good, serviceable pizza. I got an order of around 6 pizzas which only took around 20 minutes, and was on my way. I was just around the blocks, so the pies were still piping hot when I got to them. This was decent, NY-style pizza, nothing more. Somewhat fluffy end crust with a crisp but thick-ish underside, good cheese, decent sauce that was somewhat overwhelmed by the cheese. This was an above the average street slice, but not by much.  I'd probably be here on a regular basis if I went to Stevens Tech, but instead I'd rather stick to my Italian delis when I do come to Hoboken.
2011-04-11,2,We ate here because it was the closest pizza place to where we were hanging out. The pizza wasn't even average. The sauce didn't have any flavor, the cheese was just ok and the bread wasn't anything special. We won't be back.
2011-04-10,5,Hands down my favorite pizza place I have ever been to.I mean, I go with the boring plain pizza, but if you can make a plain pizza and have me eat the crust, you know the pizza is good. Also, if you do well on the plain pizza, how can you screw up on the rest?Like the atmosphere, staff is friendly, price is fair, and an amazingly convenient walk from Steven's campus.Bottom Line:A must. Have never ordered anything from the kitchen, but when I do, I know Gio's won't disappoint.
2011-01-17,4,Really amazing pizza, just pricey if u wanna make a slice like white with broccoli, or sausage n onion and 4 slices = $18
2011-01-08,4,Gio's never dissapoints. Whether it's a slice of pizza or one of their hot dishes, the food is consistently good and prices are low. With the inclusion of the new dining room area where Empire Gym used to be, Gio's now has more seating then ever. I wish they stayed open later on weekends.
2010-12-28,5,Definitely my go-to pizza place in Hoboken. Out of all the pizza places around here this one is by far my favorite. Always timely delivery and never cold. My husband finds it a bit too salty but I think that is what I like about it. The size of the slices are perfect (not too big, though I find when I go in the slices are bigger then when I order a whole pie). Haven't sat down in there for more then a slice so I'm not sure how the service is as far as the restaurant goes but if you're just in there to grab a quick slice and go, it's perfection.
2010-12-06,5,apparently I revisited most of my JC/Hoboken favorites this weekend! Me and the girls stopped in to pick up some slices for dinner (me and my best friend had it the night before too, but that didn't stop us cause it's SO GOOD!).My friends got plain and broccoli pizza -- I know the plain is fabulous (all components are good -- cheese, sauce, crust -- and in proportion), but not a broccoli fan so i passed on that. They raved about the broccoli, and the plain of course.I got one white and one slice with pepperoni and sausage (i'm a carnivore -- the more meat the better*). The white is ALWAYS perfect -- very little oil (does anyone else notice that white pizza tends to get SUPER greasy at most places??), good amount of ricotta, subtle spices (not overloaded with italian seasonings as some places do to make up for the lack of tomato sauce). The meat slice was awesome too -- a little greasy, but with 2 kinds of meat toppings, that's to be expected.I wish that they would deliver to Jersey City :(--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*that's what she said.
2010-12-01,5,I have never been disappointed by Gios.  While it may not be the biggest slice in Hoboken, its certainly the best.  I highly recommend getting a topping on your pizza too.Plain slices are $3 and others range from $3.50 to $4.25.  They also have a full Italian menu and opened up another seating section.Just be aware there is a $10 credit card minimum.
2010-09-12,4,Best delivery pizza in Hoboken hands-down.  Fast, hot, quality ingredients, and consistent - consistent - consistent.  You can't ask for than that in delivery pizza.  Really great guys, keep it up!
2010-08-24,5,Best pizza place in Hoboken (I completely agree with those who have said so).  I have always thought, "pizza is pizza...how can it get amazing" and stood by that for many many years, until I ordered delivery from Giovanni!I ordered their margarita pizza...oh...my...god!  I'm drooling now just writing this.  And now I think I'm going to place an order!
2010-05-05,5,Good Pizza!  I live uptown and our only choices are Molfetto (dirty store, dirty workers and nasty pizza) or Uptown Pizza (OVERPRICED and just adeqate). This place is delicious and they deliver very quickly and their prices are NORMAL.
2010-02-26,5,Ordered 3 more pies over the past few months and each was as good as the last... consistently delicious!
2010-02-20,4,if you want a very good slice of pizza, and a delicious chicken parmesan sub, then stop by here and have yourself a great meal that will last you the whole day!  I used to go here when I stop by the dorms to visit my girlfriend!  She loved this place!  A short walk from Stevens.  Id go back if I was in the area!
2010-02-18,5,Best pizza in Hoboken, hands down!A little pricier than other options in town, but certainly worth it!Makes a great sober dinner as well as the perfect fix for late night drunken munchies.Broccoli slice FTW!
2009-11-30,1,After all these years of my boy raving about how yummy you are, we finally took the plunge one drunken Saturday, and walked in at 1am to place an order for a large cheese pie for delivery.45 minutes, you said.But you never came!!!We stayed up til 4am, waiting, drinking, thinking, drooling over you...and you never showed up.What a way to break my heart. FAIL.
2009-11-24,3,In my opinion, Giovanni's is not the best pizzeria in Hoboken, but it is one of the better ones.  And it's not soley because of the pizza.  I have been here on countless occassions when living in Hoboken, and it came in pretty handy for a late night slice.  The pizza here is definitely better when sold by the pie rather than by slice as you're guaranteed freshness.  You know when a slice has been sitting on the counter here for a half hour.I couldn't give Giovanni's a fair review unless I credited them with a couple of their other items on the menu.  For a regular pizzeria, I thought their chicken parmigiana dish w/ ziti was delicious.  They never short-change you on the sauce and cheese.  Their bread is always pretty fresh as a side to the main dish (which is generous) and sometimes for lunch, I would grab their garlic bread topped with mozzarella cheese, which always hit the spot.  On another side note, the buffalo wings here are pretty reliable and even their hot sandwiches (I like the chicken or meatball parm best) are good enough to the point where I could vary my menu up to eat just about anything and be pretty satisfied.  My friends used to also get a kick out of the beef patties and chicken rolls, though I never tried them.  The people who worked there have always been pretty friendly with me, which to me is a pleasant change, since Hoboken has so many places where rude service runs rampant.  Slightly-above-average pizza, general satisfaction with so many items on the menu, and good service balances it out to give it a strong 3 stars.
2009-10-29,2,Meh.I've been blessed and bias by real brick oven pizza, but even before I was enlightened to the real deal, I didn't think this pizza was terribly unique. Their prices make it attractive for folks looking for cheap eats (i.e. 95% of Stevens students), but better pizza can be had elsewhere (for more money).If you're a Stevens student, you will be told of how glorious this place is. Give it a shot, and then take a walk down to Grimaldi's on 2nd and Adams. See if you'll think the same afterwards.
2009-10-12,5,Giovanni's is a winner. While I have never ordered a slice from the counter, it's the only place that I order from when I want a pie. They cook it just to my liking - a little crispy, piping hot with gooey cheese and a tangy sauce. It's always fresh and is usually delivered to my door within a decent amount of time while still hot. While I like Benny's for a big a** slice, this is my go to place when I am on a pizza fix. And where they do have Benny's beat - they actually embed their toppings into their cheese!I've tried many other Hoboken pizzerias over the last 8 years, but Giovanni's always beat them out!
2009-08-02,3,So I used to love this place, compared to a lot of pizza places on or close to Washington St. (like Benny's, Hoboken Pizza, Impostos...) this one was good but not great.After I tried a few more pizza places I decided that this place was a good backup when Filippos on First is closed or I am too lazy to go up to Uptown pizza.It's a safe bet.
2009-05-25,4,To put it simply, Gio's is the best pizza place in Hoboken. This doesn't mean they have the best single pie,  or that they're head and shoulders above all others, but after living in Hoboken for 6 years (Jesus, has it been that long) I can say with confidence that its the best overall. There are two reasons why: the crust and the toppings. The crust isn't bready or crispy, but something in between; a crunchy outside with a soft bready center. I think this comes when they reheat a slice there since you don't get it if you order for delivery. And their toppings- I mean if you've had a better chicken slice ANYWHERE tell me, cause I've never found one. Likewise their veggie special is the closest to a healthy slice of pizza you can get.I mentioned that Gio's isn't far and away the best pizza in Hoboken. Benny's is great, but they don't have good toppings and if you want the biggest slice in town, I think 7 Star has a larger ones. Also, I've a had a lot of inconsistent Benny's pies. And by inconsistent I mean randomly under done. If you want a great Margaretta pie, you don't go to Gio's either. But in a town with so much good pizza, I haven't found a better lunch, dinner, or drunken rambling pizza place than H.S Giovanni's: The Original. Oh, and they've expanded the restaurant into the old cellphone place next door, so now there's more seating and it looks nicer than it ever has; if you're into that sort of thing.
2009-05-15,5,Best pizza in this town, no contest. Go for their quality over Benny's quantity.I would probably run over someone in front of their own mother for a chicken roll from Gio's. It's that good. Seriously.The guys who work here are awesome, especially Sergio. How many people are on a first-name basis with their pizza guy?After many years, they finally decided to open late on the later weekdays and weekends, which is a nice touch after nights of drinking. And expanded seating by annexing the place that used to be on the corner.
2009-04-06,2,Had this pizza when I first moved to Jersey.  From what I remember, it was a little dry.  Much better joints in Hoboken.  Uptown is by far the most superior pizza joint in Hoboken.
2009-02-24,2,Having dormed about 2 blocks away while in college (and living in the JC/Hoboken area all my life), I've gone to Giovanni's (Gio's) many many times. The pizza is okay... but just okay. I definitely can't fault it for anything, but at the same time the taste is just average, at best. The main downside is that a slice of pizza here will cost you the same as a slice across the street at Benny Tudinos; however, Benny's slices are considerably larger and better IMO.  Gio's is open a little later than Benny's, though, and that's probably the best thing it's got going for it. I'd give it a 2.5 stars - not bad by any means, but right about average.
2009-01-18,5,i go to rutgers, and the dining hall pizza is good, but nothing like what i'm used to--new york style pizza, or at least the pizza i grew up with in nyc, jersey city and hoboken. this place did the TRICK! at 2am me and three friends were dying for some good pizza and thank god for giovanni's! we ordered a pie for like $12 or something, it came out steaming hot, deliciously cheesy, and mouth wateringly delicious. LOVE IT!
2008-09-15,5,Hmmm---I probably have a different relationship with Giovanni's, and the staff. This place is right by my 6th and Bloomfield apartment making it the PERFECT late night pizza stop on my night home from the bar. Mix in some cocktails at Sullivan's across the street and it's a complete recipe for disaster. But every time I go in, they know who I am and give me that knowing glance that their delicious pizza is going to prevent me from having a major headache in the morning. :)Giovanni's ROCKS. White cheese pizza slices are the poison here and the guys always give me the best slice on the tray. Voted every year as the best pizza joint in Hoboken, they totally live up to their name.I've ordered a full Italian dinner here as well for a party and was more than pleased with the extra garlic bread, huge portions and speedy delivery. (Yes I'm lazy I could have walked but who has time to run and get food when you're hosting a dinner party!)
2008-03-27,5,Now THIS is pizza.Having lived in the NJ/NY area for most of my life, I suppose I've been spoiled with being able to walk into any local pizzeria and get a good slice of pizza. Unfortunately, that is apparently an impossible task anywhere outside of the tri-state area.So this past Easter Sunday, we stopped by Giovanni before leaving NJ to head back up to Boston. Our mission was simple: to stock up on good old, NY-style pizza and bring it back with us to Massachusetts.$48 later, we walked out carrying 4 large pizza boxes full of the 2 house cheese pies we ordered. Why 4 boxes for 2 pizzas, you ask? Because each slice of their house pie is seriously humongous, about 2 or maybe even 3 times the size of other places. You definitely get your money's worth here.Great pizza, huge portions, reasonable prices. What more can you ask for?
