2021-11-09,4,We were late by half an hour for our brunch reservation. Got a table outdoors, the servers were very warm and accommodating. Food was great and so was the ambience. However the food service was slow. The bread in Madison mezze tasted like  fresh out of the oven, I got the lobster Benedict which was good, poached eggs were cooked perfectly. My friends got the avocado toast and steak & eggs which they said were good too.
2021-10-31,2,The worst brunch experience ever! Service is no good, food is bad.. really bad, won't recommend to anyone
2021-10-06,5,Its been awhile since I posted for the Madison, the last time was prepandemic so an update was in order.  We haven't gone out very much at all for indoor dining however, we have been extremely lucky a few Sunday afternoons at the bar here.  We like that the tables in the bar area are not on top of the bar itself so sitting at the bar is comfortable for us.  The have high ceilings to make you feel comfortable.  The bartender's, a special shout out to Kenny are very attentive and he makes a great cocktail.  The food is as good as always.  A great selection of apps, salads, sandwiches, pizza, burger and more.  We have eaten many things on the menu.  Last week for the first time I had the chicken sesame salad and it WILL be one of my faves going forward. Again shout out to Kenny who suggested it to me when I couldn't decide what to have.  We have gone here at 12:30 just prior to the games and stayed until half time and we have gone at 3:30 just after the brunch crowd is winding down and both times were comfortable for us.  They have a lot of TV's so you can see any game.  We really like the controlled crowd indoors.  They also have outdoor seating if you prefer that.  The best thing on Sunday, you can park for free!  If you can find a space that is. Looking forward to going back.
2021-09-06,2,The service in this place is horrible! We had a total of five different people serving us. It took 15 min each time we asked for a high noon and a bottle of water! What's the hold up? We couldn't make any easier the high noon is in a can! We will not return.
2021-08-27,3,Was really looking forward to this place , the take reservations and have plenty of room , but here we go ...The service : not exactly the best , we sat at the bar and the bartenders weren't really very attentive . Please know the bar wants crowded . Than they switched bartenders and they weren't much better either . So I'm disappointed about that .1The food : the grilled chicken was every good however the salmon was way to dry and I couldn't even finish :( because was just that dry ..The bathroom : definitely not the cleanest bathroom for a Thursday evening when they weren't even that busy . So someone definitely need to address this issue .I would definitely try again , maybe they just need to address these concerns .
2021-08-05,4,Great ambiance and wonderful service. We recommend a dog section and non-dog section. We would come back!
2021-07-18,1,This was my first time checking this place out... Never again! Took waiter 20 min to even attend. Then another 20-25 for our drinks. First 2 Drinks were horrible Then our waiter had left and didn't see another another till  about 30.min. Then another 15 for the app. The for our dinner plate , 40 min! Yes! 40 min to then my plate being cold n no taste! My husband ordered the fish tacos and yes 40 min! We asked for the manager, she seemed to have no experience in even dealing with issues like this... Drinks N Fd wasn't pleasing .... Mind you, another guest was also upset that they waited for about 20 min to even be attended. No not even a packed place or full house to even wait that long. Smh. They need more structural in that place.
2021-07-09,1,Had dinner on a Wednesday night with a party of 7. Should have known something was wrong when the place was empty at 7:00. Drinks were bad, food was bad. Servers were nice, but not good.
2021-06-27,1,absolutely horrible. the worst service I have ever experienced. waited 10 minutes to be seated for our reservation and another 15 minutes for a menu. my sandwich tasted like medicine and they did not offer me anything else. IF I COULD GIVE LESS THAN ONE STAR I WOULD. DONT GO HERE!!!!
2021-06-20,2,Foods gone down hill, small portions and overpriced. Service is also pretty slow and meh.  Think I'm down eating here but love the bar at night.
2021-06-18,1,Being new to Hoboken I was extremely excited to try new places. Unfortunately, this location has security that is homophobic, unprofessional, stereotypical and make guest feel unwelcomed. If you're looking for a place that isn't inclusive to all...baby you found it!
2021-06-06,4,Went here on a Sunday around 1:15 for lunch. The service was extremely slow and it took us about 15-20 minutes to even get waters. After that our waitress was attentive and we ordered food and some drinks. The caprese burger and fish tacos were great. I love this spot it can just get very loud inside since the main dinning area is so open.
2021-06-06,5,This is a pretty standard "American food and bar" spot, but they run it well. The food was tasty and the prices were actually more reasonable than I expected depending on what you ordered. I recommend a reservation on the weekends as it does get busy, but the service remains attentive.
2021-05-15,1,This used to be my favorite spot in Hoboken and I'm not sure what happened. I obviously understand Covid has been hard on so many restaurants, but everything from service to food to cocktails have gone downhill. I used to go to the Madison at least once a week. The cocktails were UNBEARABLE. We had to hold our nose to drink them because they were horrible. The food was so bland and not good at all. The service was so slow, as well. We switched to beer and wine because we couldn't bare another round. I swear I never write reviews either, but it's really upsetting because this used to be my favorite spot in town. We won't be coming back for a long time.
2021-05-13,4,Cute corner restaurant in the busy streets of Hoboken. Their outdoor option is tastefully done and makes you feel like your actually at a nice restaurant rather than a makeshift box. The food- the calamari was okay, too much breading and not enough flavor, but not the worst. The bang bang shrimp on the other hand...amazing. The crab cake was also delicious, fresh, and not fishy. The French onion soup dumplings were also awesome, just beware, it stays hotttt. But not as hot as the broccoli rabe...it was spiiiiicy. I'm a weakling when it comes to spicy food but even my boyfriend who loves spice, was having a hard time  so if you like spicy, this will be a dream come true. Lastly the veggie panini, I had higher hopes for it. Sadly it is all too often a veggie sandwich ends up being a big mushroom and a whole red pepper and the sweet pepper and bland mushrooms make for a bit of a disappointment. I wanted to love it, but it needs some love and seasoning. The cocktails were tastey but if you like booze forward be sure to preface that but overall balanced flavors!
2021-04-04,4,Pretty good spot!! Made reservation for 430 and were able to get seated early. It's not a spot on the street where the sun hits so it was a littleChilly but they were able to turn on the heaters for us that warmed us right up!! Their bloodys and truffle fries were really good! Paninis were okay, a little bit dry! Service was great- very friendly.
2021-03-29,5,This is one of my fav places in Hoboken. My boyfriend and I can here during our first outing during COVID last year and have been back numerous times since. Recently their last week. The hospitality is awesome.The food and drink are good as well.We were tryingTo figure out where to go last min now with having to make reservations and he said let's go to our spot. After 7 they don't take reservations just go so we went around 10 got there and we were seated outside which was ok because of the heaters but then one heater stopped working. Their was a woman that we had started talking to and she had to have been someone maybe a daughter or wife of the owner because she asked us how we were doing I mentioned the heater situation and that people were coming out would there be a table inside, she said they were reserved but she would see what she could do and in less than 5 min we was seated inside. My boyfriend said she checked up on us while I had stepped away and also the manager was amazing.I thanked her before we left.I will also frequent here and it's walking distance to the pier as well as they serve drinks during the summer outside.
2021-03-06,2,The hostess on Saturday lunch 3/6 is very rude and not pleasant. I have been to this restaurant several times in the past while she's working with both friends and family and have turned away because of our communication. Ongoing disappointment with the Madison front of house staff.
2021-03-01,3,The environment was really nice and fun but I ordered the veggie panini and it was... fair. There was no flavor or seasoning which is a shame because the texture of the roasted veggie and the grilled bread was good. It was supposed to have a balsamic glaze inside but I think they forgot to add it. The truffle fries however were to die for! Super crispy and flavorful!
2021-02-27,5,We had Brianna as a waitress and she was AMAZING!! The best, such a good experience. Would ask for her the next time we go there, she is a gem
2021-01-18,5,Had such a lovely experience at The Madison Bar and Grill on a recent saturday afternoon. My party and I were seated inside right away, with no prior reservation. The inside is socially distanced and all of the staff were wearing masks. The staff was super attentive and friendly, and didn't rush us at all when we sat there for well over 2 hours. The sriracha mac&cheese bombs were DELISH and so were the cocktails. I would definitely visit again - they also had a super cute outdoor seating area!
2021-01-09,5,This was our favorite spot all summer.  Glad we discovered it on open table. We also went once in October and while it was only outdoor seating at the time, the heaters were warm enough. I love their veggie pizza, grove salad, truffle fries, wings, and spinach artichoke dip.When we come here for date night we love the misunderstood cocktail. Can't wait to come back.
2020-12-26,5,The best bar in Hoboken! The burger and French onion soup dumplings are to die for. The best bartenders and by far the best service.
2020-12-23,4,We actually made reservations at Bin14 next door, but due to some confusion we didn't get indoor seating like we initially hoped. At the time, Madison Bar and Grill had an opening for a table of 5, which saved us from sitting in the cold. We were very happy that we came across this place and would recommend it to anybody in the area for brunch.Service:- very knowledgeable and courteous staff. - as mentioned above, we walked in and got a table of 5 in seconds- food and drinks came out very quickly- everyone is following COVID protocols- we actually received a set of dirty utensils, which was no fun to see. Food:- you have to try the Mac and cheese bites. They were perfect on a cold winter day.- the French Onion Dumplings were unique. It had a lot of cheese and a lot of onion. Still tasted good overall and nice to share between multiple people- the omelette is hefty and tastes great. I got it with the goat cheese because that's my favorite. - the veggie panini was a little underwhelming. Would not recommend. - the Bellinis are better tasting than the Mimosas - on the more expensive side for brunch. But it is Hoboken. Ambience:- loved the exposed pipes in the ceilings- vibrant Christmas decorations - we came on a Sunday, so they had multiple NFL games playing, perfect for me.
2020-12-06,3,Came here for a late lunch around 3pm and they had a decent amount of people there. They were able to seat us right away. The service was good. I got the hanger steak cooked medium which was good but a little too undercooked in the middle. The burger was good! As for covid precautions, everyone was a good 6ft apart but the one bartender kept pulling his mask down and walking around. Other than that, good place for food and drinks.
2020-11-24,3,I was spending a Saturday taking photos at the Weehawken "Dueling Grounds and the Hoboken River Park. After miles of walking I was looking for a place to relax and have a drink. The Madison Bar & Grill looked like an interesting choice. The bar inside was open but I decided to be careful and sit at a table outside. The Madison has a tent setup outside as well. It was not overly crowded so I was presented with a menu by a waitress who was wearing a mask. At the lunch menu was not extensive so it did not take me long to come to a decision. As I was more thirsty then hungry, I ordered a Yuengling draft (American Amber 4.5%) $6. A 5 star draft for me should come with a frosted mug and a minimum of 50 degrees F. As I at my outside table under a beautiful sunny sky I felt less hungry by the moment. The inside bar had sports playing but I was content with people watching and there were a lot of people walking about. The restaurant has delivery and take-out and I was contemplating taking something home for dinner. In the end I had another draft beer (Kane Head High) an Indian Pale Ale, 6.5%, $8. They have a Happy Hour but 1 pm in the afternoon is not Happy Hour. All in all, I had a wonderful day in Frank Sinatra's hometown.
2020-11-01,1,Reservation made for lunch.  Two of the three called an hour before to ask for table in sun...daughter's birthday and 45 degrees!  Not only did we not get a table in the sun we didn't get a table for 40 min.  And, they had to set it up...not 6 feet from next table right on other side of planter.  When table in sun opened up we asked if we could move but was told that it was for a reservation.  In fact was fir a reservation after ours but they had a dog so couldn't sit inside so....   Been resident of Hoboken for 15 years...vowed to never go back after another bad experience maybe 5 years ago but daughter chose so didn't say anything.  We left and went to Urban Coalhouse...great service and vibe and...sat at table in the sun!   Our waitress was not to blame...she gets the star.
2020-11-01,5,Outside set up is great! Highly highly recommend the French onion soup dumplings, they're amazing.
2020-10-27,4,Four words: French. onion. soup. DUMPLINGS. When I saw that on the menu I knew I needed to try it & they did not disappoint. The food overall was very delicious, and came out in a timely manner. The place itself is so cute and has a great vibe. Perfect for a date night or a spot to grab dinner with friends. I went on a Sunday evening around 7, and was able to get a table no problem. Their cocktails are fun & tasted great too.
2020-10-13,4,Came here for dinner on a Saturday night! It was pretty packed so I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. The outdoor seating was beautiful and the food was delicious! The prices for the food really isn't too bad either and I would definitely come here again!
2020-10-08,5,The MOM-osa was phenomenal! It is the perfect size and gets you a slight buzz (: The brisket sandwich was huge and definitely worth the money ! I will absolutely be coming back.
2020-09-14,5,Went for dinner the other night and ate outside. They have a great set up that makes you feel safe.  Our waitress Stacey was so nice and provided excellent service!  Food and cocktails were good- I had the chicken panini and some Moscow mules. Definitely recommend!
2020-09-12,1,The food was okay and the drinks were priced fine. There was really bad service and the security had poor customer service. They are on top of the customers and do not put their masks on all the way. I would recommend another outdoor seating bar.
2020-09-12,4,One of our favorite restaurants.They always try to accommodate youFast friendly service.Food is delicious.
2020-08-23,1,I go to Hoboken frequently and I always thought this place was very cute. Their outdoor set up has umbrellas and it has the perfect summer feel. However, this is only if you are lucky enough to be seated at these tables.When we arrived we were walked to our table which was around the building and half way down the block. The table was on the sidewalk against the street leaning at an angle towards the street with NO SAFETY BARRIERS. There were cars and busses wizzing by us. If they moved even 5 inches closer they would have hit us.I understand that places are doing their best because of Covid but this just seems like a way to fit MORE people to make more money. They do not mind sacrificing the safety of their patrons. Not to mention that the salmon was over cooked with random hot spots throughout it. Very disappointed.
2020-08-03,4,We happen to be in the neighborhood & our friend mentioned this was a good place to try with everything that is going on because of COVID it worked out well because they have a nice seating area set up outside. we had RSVP since it was a Saturday night once we arrived we were seated right away. Drinks to start I had the Cabernet , not bad also tried the White Sangria good taste but not enough alcohol. On the food we had the Thick cut Bacon Grilled Cheese w Truffle fries & the Farfalle pasta. Really good grilled cheese comes with a cup of tomato bisque great for dipping the sandwich in it .. better with the garlic aioli , the truffle fries were good as well also great when dipped in the garlic aioli.  The Farfalle pasta was delicious I really liked the Garlic & Oil and Fresh Basil taste, the peas were ok for me just cause not a big fan of peas nice tasting & light pasta dish. Nice seating area outside good set up, social distancing in place the staff does wear masks. service was good & prices were decent , we enjoyed our meal.
2020-07-29,4,Good place for brunch.We made a reservation to come in on a Sunday morning and were seated in the back room immediately. Despite not being overly hungry, I couldn't turn down the Chicken and Waffles. The fried chicken breast was very good... super moist and flavorful. The drumstick was also okay despite the slightly gray color that was initially unappealing lol. The breading wasn't the best, but still a good Chicken and Waffles dish. I really liked the gravy that went along with it and left satisfied.The crowd was a mix of larger parties with kids, and smaller groups like ours.
2020-07-25,2,I'm not one to complain usually and I really wanted to like this restaurant especially because I know a lot of places are struggling now. However, I saw a giant roach in the bathroom garbage can. I'm glad it was in the garbage can and not on the floor but it really put me off and made me question the cleanliness. Additionally, there was a huge table right next to us that clearly wasn't following the social distancing rules. They kept having people getting up and down and hanging out in the aisle right next to our table without masks. It made me uncomfortable and I wanted to ask to move, but there was nobody around I could speak to about it. Finally, someone from the restaurant showed up and asked them to remain seated. I'm not blaming the restaurant for that table's actions, but it would have been nicer if someone was around sooner. The food was ok, but nothing special. They also did get my husband's order wrong and some employees weren't wearing their masks properly.
2020-06-24,5,Nice place! I came in the afternoon to spend a short time before meeting somewhere else, I had a drink and appetizers. It was a nice moment and I want to come again to try more food. We had ceviche (delicious) and meat balls with a side of broccoli ( meatballs were super good) They have outdoor tables... definitely I'm coming back to spend more time!
2020-04-19,3,A very inviting environment however the food and drinks are very overpriced.. especially for the portions that you get.
2020-03-01,4,Surprising Kids friendly even on Saturday night at 9 pm given that part of the restaurant sort of turns into a "club" by 10:30 pm. Service was a bit slow but we didn't mind as we were a large group and we were planning to be there a few hours. Food was overall good. The only reason I give it a 4 stars as oppose to 5 is that we asked a few different Scotches per the menu and they kept saying they don't have any stock! Bit sad when you have a full bar ...
2020-02-17,4,Good for drinks w/ friends.  Mixed crowd 25+, not crazy loud.  Just enough TVs.  During the day is pretty laid back.  I haven't eaten here yet, but will in the near future!
2020-02-14,1,Valentine's Day Prefix...I should've known better. Sounded good but it was not. Giant prawns and arugula salad were good. The prawns came with a corn and bean salad which was great. The main course had a few options I chose unwisely and got the filet mignon. My first filet came out raw! The second one was cooked right but it had too many membranes and fat. It was bad. My wife thought she chose wisely and got the papardelle with scallops and it was good if not for the ton of salt they put in it. Dessert was ok. Not bad but nothing to brag about. The wine was excellent. A cab Franc from Long Island. Very good wine.Overall very disappointed.
2020-02-09,1,If there was a way to give 0 stars I would. 1 star would at least require you receiving service. The Hostess just pointed to a tabLe saying "that one"" for us to sit at. We proceeded to looK through  the menu and decide what we wanted pretty quickly. At which poiint we sat and waited. And waited. And waited. It would have been easier to understand why we waited for 15 min without even a sideways glance or even wAter foR the  table if there hadn't been 3 hostesses socializing at the wait stand behind us and another 4 of the waitstaff milling around the room. The waitstaff refused to make any eye contact with us and when the tablee directllt nexxt to us left, the table was prinptly turned over still without any acknowledgement to our table of 2. On top of all of this The room was MAYBE a third of the way full. At this point the $20 avocado toast was looking less and less appealing, so we left and turned in our menu with our explanation of why we were leAving  without any care or apology from the  hostesses. Instead we headed down to the always friendly Elysian  cafe and guess what-- my $13 avocado toast WITH FRIES  was promptly deliver to our table within 15 min of sitting down. Save yourself the trip and headache and avoid Madison's.
2020-01-27,4,The Madison is more than what you'd expect when you see Bar & Grill in it's name. You're not going to find nachos and cheese sticks here unless maybe they've done a deconstruction reconstruction. So, good food its where it's at here at The Madison. I wish I would've asked how they decided on using "the" instead of adding an "a". Maybe I missed it. Oh well!  I'm sure that's not the only thing we missed as we were tucked away in a quaint private area to enjoy too much wine on this particularly warm Fall evening. Our reservation was at 8 and the place was packed to the gills. Even with all the hustle and bustle, our service was excellent and our experience was even better.
2020-01-18,4,I order from the Madison via Seamless about once every two weeks. I can't comment on the service at the restaurant or the decor or what-not. However I have had just about everything on their menu. So I can tell you this is one of my favorite restaurants to order delivery. The Good: Chicken Quesadilla, MBG Signature Blue Label Burger (only issue is how about a BACON option on here?), French Onion Soup Dumplings (only issue is that with delivery they can be cold), Cheeseburger Sliders (sometimes when I don't want the MBG burger, ill get these instead), Fried Calamari (really good with sweet chili sauce), Steamed Mussels (with fra diavolo sauce).The Bad: Never had anything BAD but have to say the grown up mozarella are lacking. They are delivered IN the sauce. So by the time i'm eating they are a soggy mess. Also found the mozarella to be too chewy, like eating leather. If someone from The Madison is reading this - I would try again on your grown up mozarella sticks. Also the bang bang shrimp for $13 is a ripoff. It's...okay. But not worth the price. Same with the tuna tar tar. Its...okay. Just not worth $18. Porky Balboa Sandwich I had once and it was fantastic. I ordered it another time and thought it was just 'meh'. I haven't ordered it again.The Ugly: No ugly to report. It's pricey. You order an app and an entree, with the delivery costs you can be looking at $30-40 order. I have found that the quality of their food is very good. The delivery (via Seamless) is often fast enough (especially that i'm on Newark Street, on the other side of town). Ultimately, I just wish The Madison had a downtown location. I would go there all the time.
2020-01-16,1,This place is terrible with awful management. The kitchen had a odd smell and p,ace is dated. Bartenders were cool though but the food is garbage.
2020-01-06,1,After a mediocre meal of hanger steak served cold and house salad with rubbery "blackened" shrimp and so so service / getting sat literally on top of the only other table in the place... we saw a mouse openly running around the restaurant. The servers were so nonchalant like it's the norm.. I paid my $60 bill, left my full glass of wine and ran out of there. Gross.
2019-12-02,4,I went here on thanksgiving eve. It was a nice bar to sit at the bar and enjoy some drinks. It wasn't very crowded, but wasn't empty either. There was a dj, but no one was dancing. The bartenders were fast and polite. Drinks were well made
2019-11-24,5,Went here for dinner last night and everything was absolutely perfect for a spontaneous little date night. Drinks were well made and the entree portions were perfect. We didn't leave feeling overly full and would consider using the dining hall for a private party! As a result of fulfilling everything we were looking for out of the last minute walk in decision, I would highly recommend checking out The Madison in the future!- Fair and honest review from H Lew
2019-11-24,1,ALERT!!!  I should have security arrested tonight.  BEWARE.  Someone stole my glasses tonight and then I was assaulted by Madison's security while trying to look for them   Almost called 911.  Was waiting for everyone to clear out to find my glasses and the security guard shoved me multiple times across the room and out the door.  This place is lucky they don't have a lawsuit waiting for them.  Who shoves a customer after their property was stolen and belittles them on the way out??  This security guard deserves to be fired ASAP.  Madisons should be ashamed of themselves.  Do not go here
2019-11-03,4,This is a cute restaurant/bar located in the heart of Hoboken. I loved the atmosphere, the service was good and the food was great. If you're hungry, order the Mediterranean Mezze appetizer, it was perfect for the three of us! The salads are delicious and pizza was good. I will go back for an evening at the bar!
2019-10-28,4,The Madison has a great selection of apps and drinks. Went with one other person and got a lot of little things to split- the parm sliders were great!
2019-10-13,1,I went here for lunch and was severely disappointed. I gave this place the benefit of doubt as others have said that there are mice running around the back and also have seen cockroaches crawling up the walls. This not only happened once but twice. I got the Cobb salad, the lettuce was old and had a brownish color, the chicken was pulled chicken and was discolored and had zero flavor.  Another person at our table ordered the breakfast Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese tasted just like boxed Mac and cheese with a few tossed French fries and bacon. The meal itself resembled dog food.Something so simple as iced tea tasted like it has been sitting in a pitcher brewing for weeks.
2019-10-08,5,There's NO need to visit a fancy steak house when you have literally one of the best steaks I've eaten right here at Madison! This aged ribeye melts in your mouth and had intense flavors with beautifully buttery potatoes and honey roasted carrots on the side. Haven't had a bad meal here yet, and always looking forward to my next meal
2019-10-06,5,Love their happy hour, it's great! Never eaten a full meal here, just some bites while grabbing a drink. The lamb sliders are delicious! Nice vibe in the bar area and friendly staff. I am a repeat customer and will continue to be!
2019-09-12,4,Food was great and the wait staff was also very hospitable and attentive. I loved that it was upscale bar food! I got the short rib grilled cheese with tomato bisque and truffle fries..Omg it was delicious. My friend got the MBG signature burger and he cleared his plate. Atmosphere was also very warm and inviting (we sat in the bar area). Would definitely come back!
2019-09-07,3,In the mood for some bar food, my friend and I decided to go to The Madison for the first time. We were intrigued by their sandwich and panini selection, so we decided to order the Chicken panini which comes with grilled chicken, apple wood smoked bacon, mozzarella, tomato, mixed greens and balsamic vinaigrette on a ciabatta roll. I'm a huge fan of paninis so I was really excited to try this. Presentation wise it looked absolutely delicious, however, it was definitely lacking in taste. I had to search the menu online to remember what was in the panini once I had eaten it because I did not taste smoked bacon or balsamic vinaigrette. I ate a little more than half of the panini until I just couldn't eat it anymore. I wanted to like it, but it was just bland. As an appetizer, we decided to order the mozzarella sticks. Even though they were tasty, they were more like mozzarella bites and only came with 3. To drink, I had to go with my third choice beer because they had ran out of Kane and Kona. The service was good, but I just expected to have a better experience.
2019-09-03,4,4.5- solid dinner tonight! My friend and I were in the mood for appetizers and light bites when we saw the pre-fix menu we changed out minds! It's like 21$ for appetizer, entree and dessert from a select menu. Very cool! So worth it- only available week nights I believe. We also ordered fried calamari from the regular menu as well. Everything came out hot and fresh, service started off slow but the waiter was very accommodating. He also brought us a carafe of water which I greatly appreciated - We ended up trying, calamari (standard), bang bang shrimp (it was ok), the spinach dip (excellent), roasted chicken (very good) and salmon (also good!) we took home the flourless chocolate molten cake and I tried a bite, it was delicious. The chicken also came with creamed corn and mashed potatoes and both were excellent!! I am a sucker for corn in the summer! Overall we really enjoyed sitting outside and had a good dinner! T
2019-08-30,5,Fantastic!  Every time without fail I have been impressed by the staff and the food!Everyone is so accommodating - even when i showed up on the tail end of brunch with a 2 year old :) The bar is not just a boring everyday bar the tenders are seriously trained in making exquisite cocktails - Mixologists for sureCheers - see you soon (PS - outdoor seating... one time I even brought my dog and he sat on the outside of the fence and the waiter brought him water ! love love love
2019-08-21,2,Typical town bar but absolutely nothing to write home about. Alcoholic Drink my friend ordered came out of a slushee type machine plainly displayed to the patrons. I ordered a can beer and the glass they gave me had a concerning and unappetizing milky film on the inside and was room temperature. Food wasn't necessarily bad but was just boring and overpriced. Waitress took about 15 mins to come around each time even though there was only about 7 people in the whole joint. Wasn't necessarily a train wreck but Won't be going back.
2019-08-12,5,Visited after almost 8-9 years with a friend.  The place is just the way we left it last time - a good balance of ambiance. Bar services , food diversity and customer service. We planted ourselves at the bar for abut 2 hours and the bartenders were very friendly and good at what they do.  We also had appetizers and dinner and the food was excellent. All of this comes with a very palatable price and a smiling service across the board.  Will return again.
2019-07-04,5,Came to Hoboken for July 4th the area seemed pretty dead but my husband was hungry and still wanted to drink. We stopped here for a drink and an appetizer and were really happy with the selection. I had sangria he had whiskey neat and we split the onion soup Dumplings. Definitely would order the same things again!
2019-06-27,2,Very sad to write this review as my husband and I have been dining at the Madison for 6+ years, in the last few months we have given it a few more tries after a horrible experience back in December where  our parents were in town visiting and every brunch meal ordered came out ice cold and essentially inedible. We have come back a few times since but it is truly missing the elevated charm it once had. The service is subpar and the servers need to be reminded of requests numerous times before delivering.
2019-06-26,1,Every time I go there the ladies at the bar are fantastic but the guys provide very poor service from bartenders to bouncer. Over priced drinks and poor service is why  I do not recommend this place . Go else where.
2019-06-14,5,The friendliest bartender i have ever met with the best recommendations  ! I had the amazing brisket filled grilled cheese with tomato bisque came with truffle fries&& the chicken and waffles with cranberry compote ! yummmy extra delicious i love brunch all day ! Everything was scrumptious and reasonably priced ! definitely coming back AND TRY THE " all my exes " drink a good vodka based drink with strawberries.
2019-05-31,1,AVOID. this place is dirty. I came here the other night, sat on their couch (which there's a huge hole in by the way) and was punctured in the leg by a piece of glass. So, consider the needs of your skin and go to a cleaner dining establishment where you don't need to evaluate your risk of contracting an infection while choosing your meal.
2019-05-25,2,I came with two of my friends, females. We ordered some drinks and were dancing. I was enjoying the vibe until I was inappropriately touched by the bouncing staff. I do not recommend for men of color.
2019-05-24,1,My friend sat  on a couch here and sat on a piece of glass   After tending to the wound OURSELVES. The manager said "sorry" and that was it. Terrible service.
2019-05-21,1,If I could give them a zero  I would because they were so rude. We went in to have a night- cap after a long day of touring in NYC with the intention of celebrating my nephew's graduation from Law School and your staff was so rude... with no respect to our family, who travelled from California to celebrate this accomplishment with our family ...doctors and lawyers...it was awful!!!! There are no words for the treatment we received!I would not recommend this establishment to anyone.
2019-05-19,4,I came here with my friend for the Sunday brunch. We sit outside but the table outside is kinda uneven. We didn't try the bottomless brunch though. I ordered the omlete. My friend ordered a Salman sandwich. The dishes looked kinda normal but it tasted surprising good. I think their sauce is very special and that's why it did the magic. I heard this restaurant used to be Eli manning 's regular. I want to try their bottomless brunch or early bird dinner next time.
2019-04-18,5,I met a friend for dinner the other night. Our server was lovely and accommodating. But I was blown away by how solicitous and eager to please the owner/manager was. I noticed that there was cauliflower steak on the menu, but no other cauliflower dishes. I asked the server if they could do a side of cauliflower for me, either roasted or steamed or buffalo style. The owner/manager (whose name I really should have gotten) came to our table and told me he'd be happy to prepare something off menu for me. He came out a bit later with buffalo cauliflower prepared perfectly. Then a bit later, he came back with a bowl of fried buffalo cauliflower and asked which I preferred. Truth is both were wonderful and either would be a fabulous addition to the menu. It is rare to have people go above and beyond in this manner in a casual neighborhood place. But The folks at The Madison did just that.  It is a perfect neighborhood place where you are treated as if you're valued. The prices are moderate and you will leave feeling that you got your money's worth. There are also dinner specials and happy hours to soothe your pocketbook. Kudos.
2019-04-03,5,Dined in on Saturday night with a friend.  Had the creme brûlée.  The atmosphere was pleasant.  Came back Wednesday night for an appetizer.  The lobster Mac and cheese was good but tiny!!!  Definitely not enough for a full meal!!!!The fried calamari on the other hand was amazing!  Full of flavor and comes with a delicious aioli sauce!!!!Karaoke night on Wednesday's!!!!!!!!!
2019-03-22,3,We sat at the bar to eat, have drinks and do some karaoke. Kelly Silver the KJ and all of the wait staff were excellent. They were out of 2 beers we asked for but there was a decent selection so no worries. The food however was lacking. The pizza was dry, and so were the meatball sliders. I ordered the short rib sliders and they came with regular onions as opposed to pickled reds per the menu. We didn't complain because we were having a good time. The food was a little expensive for the quality. I would give 5 stars for the bar experience, however, the food was a big disappointment.
2019-03-09,3,The food is pretty good here, or at least good enough! You're probably not coming here in search of the best meal of your life, but you'll definitely enjoy it. They have a large, varied menu of sandwiches, salads, burgers, etc. I've stuck mostly to burgers, salads, and wraps and have enjoyed what I've ordered. In my opinion, they can be a little overpriced though.Then bar area is good for watching a game. There are plenty of tvs. On the flip side though, it can get very noisy.
2019-02-21,1,See pic of entire staff giggling at the corner of the bar for the 10 minutes I lasted there. Enough said.
2019-01-09,3,Ambience is great. Brings some old town charm to the area.Food is way overpriced and strictly average.
2018-11-04,1,My husband and I wanted to go for brunch this morning, we've been to MBG and it's always been okay so today we decided to try. Terrible choice. We sat right away but then didn't get greeted for about10-15 minutes. Our waitress took our drink order (just coffee) which took about another 15 minutes. She came back and apologized because she though she took our food order but didn't (another 15 minutes passed). We ordered and our food took an additional 30 minutes. My husband ordered chicken and waffles which you would think it was fried chicken. No. Basically dry pulled bland chicken on top of a waffle with bbq sauce on it. It looked disgusting. I ordered an omelet and halfway through found a piece of hair. After already having such a terrible experience, we pulled the manager over and told him this was absolutely awful and then we left. MBG is nothing special and we will not be back.
2018-10-28,1,I used to like the Madison but after tonight I will not be back. Our waitress took 20 min to come to our table. When she arrived, she did not greet us, but instead told us "the kitchen closes in 30 min". We ordered right away and kept it simple. She yelled from the POS system across the restaurant to double check our order. She never checked on us throughout the meal, and instead sat chatting with the bartender all night. We waited forever for our check, and when she came over to the table she said "table service has ended" and gave us our check. We would have asked for it anyway, and we hadn't even been lingering. We weren't ordering dessert and never even asked for a second round of drinks. We ate quickly, so I'm not sure why she felt the need to tell us "table service has ended". We will not be back.
2018-10-13,2,Very slow bartenders. Did not even acknowledge our existence for at least 10 minutes.
2018-10-02,5,My roommates and I absolutely LOVE this place. Although, it is conveniently located 2 blocks away from us, it really is everything that you can want in a bar/restaurant. The drinks are GREAT and not watered down, the food is DELICIOUS, and the staff is very friendly and attentive. Just for context, we are in mid-twenties and enjoy going there every night or day of the week. It's a good overall atmosphere. It's also suitable for an intimate yet casual date, a girls night out or family dinner. This place is by far 10/10. You should definitely check it out if you're in the area!!
2018-09-29,4,Good burger! I had the basic Mbg burger. My friend had the breakfast burger. It a cool spot to watch the game, kind of an odd waitress. The truffle fries were banging! The best burger there is the Big Mic. Just go, you won't be disappointed
2018-09-09,1,Ordered takeout from Madison bar and grill and the food was cold. The fries were very soggy and not edible. I typically have had great experiences with Madison but I don't recommend ordering takeout.
2018-08-29,5,I have the time to write a review. Screw you Sabastian Maniscaclo. I am at his place and if you can't make it to Madison Bar  and Grill your loss. Matt at the bar makes the best cosmopolitan east of the Mississippi and west of the Hudson.. I first enjoyed clams on the half shell and usually I prefer the Little necks but the cherry size were excellent. We then explored the Madison Mezzo a delectable delight consisting of a collection of assorted olives, hummus, artichoke hearts, stuffed grape leaves Fresh yellow tomatoes and pimentos. Served with pita. The the best was the short rib sliders. Omg something you have never experienced before. A fantastic creation if visiting you should not miss as out in.  Yum yum.
2018-08-18,3,Came here for dinner on a Thursday.  There was happy hour in the bar area and a separate dining area. It was a long wait for dinner and to get our check, maybe because of happy hour in the next room.  We ordered the salmon and the burger.  The burger was huge, and the salmon was a small thin salmon fillet was dry. Both was edible.  I will not be back since there are so many other options nearby.
2018-08-01,3,I love coming here for the Sunday brunch buffet. For $35 you get an alcoholic drink, plus unlimited buffet trips. The buffet features things like eggs benny, breakfast burritos, fruit, pizza, bagels etc. definitely something for everyone. It's a great spot to bring the parents/ family as it's a large restaurant. I've also dined here for dinner a few times as well. Things to order- chicken parm, it's huge and delicious. The brick chicken, also huge and delicious. Any of the sandwiches. There's been a few things I wasn't a fan of the like the spaghetti bolognese. Overall a safe bet to fill you up. Gets really fun at night too.
2018-07-30,3,As a large party the service was very good, the drinks and food didn't take long to come out, but were spaced out nicely between courses. The entire dinner was great until the end when we spotted a mouse on the ground in the dining room and told the hostess and she went to talk to someone in the back and then no one did anything to attempt to trap the mouse or apologize to us for the mouse.
2018-07-30,1,As we were sitting waiting for the check we were entertained by a mouse running around the main dining area.  Yeah....won't be going back anytime soon. Super yuck!!!
2018-07-30,2,Yeah, so here's the thing. This is bar food, and unremarkable bar-food at that.We got great service and were largely left alone on a slow night, which allowed us to do what we wanted to do: catch up after too many years of being out of touch. And, they didn't screw up the beer. There's a broad selection.But, the mice (or mouse) that periodically roamed the floor pretty much killed the atmosphere, and the food wasn't that great. So - you know: if you're into vermin and great conversation, go for it. Otherwise, take a pass.
2018-07-15,5,Went for brunch and had a great time! My friend and I both got the eggs benedict with crab cakes and were not disappointed. Service was good and we both commented on the good music selection as well. Definitely going back.
2018-07-15,4,Always delicious.   I'm not necessarily a "breakfast food" kinda girl so i appreciate the fact that they have a brunch with the option of both lunch and a buffet to satisfy everyone in your party.  The truffle fries were awesome.
2018-06-30,1,What died in here? The place smells like they are pumping dirty cat litter through the vents. Had to leave after one drink. Had a party of 15 people for my birthday. Went in to spend mucho dinero on drinks as we just finished dinner and were looking to get crunked. We sat down at a table and they took the table away. I'm like ???? The kid apologized and said he has to. Apparently this hole turns into a "club" and the whole 2 tables had to be taken away from us to make room on the dance floor for all 5 people (not including my party) that were in the bar. I told him it's my bday, we want to sit and drink. He pretty much told me oh well and picked up the table and carried it away. We seriously were taking up like 0 room. The tables were tiny and in a corner. The dance floor was empty and gigantic. This is Hoboken on a Friday night...only having a handful of people in your bar and an empty dance floor is red flag number one. Whatever though. Rules is rules, I guess. Not business savvy rules, but rules none the less. Let's get back to the smell. I was gagging. Had one beer that I couldn't finish because I HAD to leave. Omg rotten kitty litter. There's something rotting in that place. Has to be. So we all leave cause the place was the worst bar I've ever been to in Hoboken and I'm embarrassed that I took my friends there and the smell is starting to cling to our clothes and stick in my nose. Anyway, waiting outside for Uber and two girls are like "how is it in there??" I told them it smells. They decide to go in anyway. Make it to the entrance, don't even get inside the bar, and turn back around. They smelled it from the entrance and were like "omg you're right! That's horrible" and they left. You're welcome ladies. Don't go here.
2018-06-27,5,They have the best Brunch in Hoboken. Just delicious :)
2018-06-12,1,Ordered a taco salad and a steak .. 2 hours later still no food. Got the check left and went to Napoli's. Much better go there!
2018-06-11,1,Terrible service. Literally. This is the 2nd time my friend and I have come here on a Monday night and we felt like we were a nuisance to our servers. Both times. First of all, we walked in and both nights it was dead. Took a while to even find a host...then got sat and both times took over 10 minutes to be greeted. Tonight, we were on the patio and the server we had the first time came out and saw us and the table next to us, looked confused and walked back inside without saying anything. Finally, the blonde server walked out and said, "is tap water okay?" Didn't say hello, didn't give her name, just acted like we were almost a problem...I finally said, "are you our server?" By that time, we already knew what we wanted to drink, eat and what we wanted for dessert. She almost seemed taken back that we wanted to order it all at once...but after sitting for 15 minutes without even being greeted, that's totally normal of a guest. Our appetizer literally arrived 20 seconds after our drinks did. Then at the end of the meal she had the audacity to rush me into signing the bill because the restaurant was closing...5 minutes after close...wow! My friend and I are professionals servers/bartenders in the city and we expect at least decent service when we go out because sometimes it's nice to not be on the other end. I never post reviews but after 2 super terrible experiences at this very restaurant, I felt like I had to say something. The job isn't that hard. You make tips...you should at least try! We make amazing money doing our jobs, so it sucks when we see someone not even trying...
2018-06-09,2,I keep going back to the Madison Bar & Grill because it's so close to me, and I love the tuna tartare appetizer, but I finally realized that I really don't like this place. I just like the tuna tartare! One, the wait service is terrible, and it's annoying to see that some people get bread on the table while others do not. So I started ordering take out inside of picking up. The restaurant always has me waiting to pick up even when I come AFTER the amount of time they recommend. I also hate that the salads are not freshly prepared -- grape tomatoes and the lettuce looks like it was prepackaged. When I requested modifications to my salad (add corn to the mixed green salad), my salad came back without corn. It's just like grr I wish it was better but they have 1 got item on the menu.
2018-06-06,4,Such a fun place to go on the weekends for drinks but just discovered their wine Wednesday and the tableside bread and ricotta :-) great menu and food tasted delicious too. This is a staple uptown in Hoboken.
2018-05-27,4,The food is all very good. But I'm super annoyed about the parking validation. They only validate at little man garage on 12th st. That's 3 blocks away. Not the propark garage across the street on Bloomfield st. That makes no sense and very frustrating especially when I'm on tow with two little children.
2018-05-07,3,Ate here over the weekend and had terrible service. We sat outside for lunch/early dinner and maybe saw our sever 3 times. We had to ask another server to put our meals in and get our check because we never saw our server. Food was great but service was less than what we would have expected
2018-05-04,4,I had a great experience last night with my girlfriends. We were originally seated inside, but asked if we could sit outside (after the rain passed). Our waiter, Katie, and staff were very accommodating! After a quick wipe down we were able to enjoy the warmer weather outside.We started off with drinks, which might I add were all delicious! While my friend was ordering a cocktail, Katie mentioned how it was happy hour for the rest of the night which included pretty much everything, but the cocktails. My friends and I then ordered sangria, margaritas, and rose. My sister could not stop talking about how delicious the margarita was. I too enjoyed my sangria.We then ordered a couple of appetizers. We had the Tuna Tar Tar which came with avocado, tomato, pickled ginger, sesame, soy sauce, and chipotle cilantro oil. (18) I thought this appetizer was very tasty, it had a great little kick to it. The tuna could have been chopped a little more and the avocado could have been a little more ripe. It made it a bit harder to scoop with the tortilla chips, but overall was good!We also ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip. (14) Yummy! And the Short Rib and Wild Mushroom Gluten-Free Pizza! (12) The pizza was my favorite appetizer. My friend eats a lot Gluten-Free food, so when we had decided on this pizza I was ecstatic to try. Who would have thought Short Rib on pizza? It was very good and easy to eat! We weren't tugging on the meat nor was it falling apart. Everything stayed intact.Kudos to Katie for being informative and knowledgeable of the menu and Gluten-Free items. After ordering the pizza she had told us the Spinach and Artichoke Dip had flour in it. This immediately made my experience better because she is aware and knowledgeable of Gluten-Free living. There are many times where you may dine elsewhere and are not informed about certain ingredients that you may be allergic to or just can not eat. She was very attentive and very kind. Thank you Katie!
2018-04-30,3,UPDATE: owner reached out, provided a refund, and couldn't have been nicer. We will eat here again, the food has always been good.This restaurant ruined my daughter's baptism celebration. I made the reservation months in advance and was told we weren't a big enough party to customize the menu (15 pple, 8 kids). We were told by the party mgr we HAD to order off the menu. 45 mins before our reservation, DURING the ceremony at the church, they called and told us they wanted to move our reservation up 30 mins because we had to do the crusty, chafing dish buffet. Our waiter was terrible. Confused the drink orders, disappeared for looong periods of time, and made a mess out of all the orders at my brother's side of the table. I order fries for my 2 yo as soon as we sat down. They were brought to the wrong side of the table. When his burger came out it was announced as sliders, not the burger on the kids menu, so we sent it back. Turns out it was his food. Hungry toddler's food keeps getting screwed up, imagine how that went ;( No one cleared the finished appetizer plates for so long I stood up and yelled to get his attention. He gave some story that he was waiting for everyone to be finished.....we had been for a while. Lunch plates also languished forever. But somehow he managed to wait for me when I got out of the ladies room so I could order a wine.....creepy. My guests were good sports, esp considering 8 kids were subjected to hours of waiting to eat and go home. We were there over 3 hours...close to 4. Nightmare. The food is good, but no one noticed. Very sad day for me, tears shed on what should have been a happ
2018-04-21,3,Great service. Love the menu Will make it here again I Brunch is over at 3 which make the place even better
2018-04-21,3,My medium rare burger. Not so medium.  They're seem to be forgetting about the outside, service is very slow. Although it's understandable, this is only the 2nd nice weekend this year. I did enjoy my sweet potato fries, as you can see they're missing from my picture. Would come here for drinks only again.
2018-04-19,5,We went to the Madison for the first time last Saturday night.  They were very busy but our reserved table in the dining room was ready when we arrived.  The food was excellent, and the service was outstanding.  It was a bit noisy, but that was because everyone there was having a great time!
2018-04-07,1,The food used to be so good here, but lately been really disappointed.  While there are staples that are great like the French onion soup dumplings and turkey burger , I have been continually disappointed when ordering any main type of entree. The roasted chicken is dry and over cooked with no flavor and the ribs were terrible. We ordered delivery took one bite and threw it out.
2018-03-28,3,Kind of disappointed with my experience here. Let me break it down for ya:Service: our waiter was very nice but service was kind of slow. Our food came out pretty quick but it took quite some time to get orders placed. Place and ambiance: these were ok, nothing spectacular, cross between a family restaurant meets pub. My part of six was seated at a table with a severe incline, it was even funny. Our water even spilled over due to the steep incline. Food: meh meh meh, nothing was bad but nothing was good either, everything was stuck in that neutral Zone. My biggest complaint was the chicken with waffles, it wasn't the typical fried chicken, this was what seemed to be oven roasted chicken picked apart and placed over the waffle. I think they should have at least specified that on the menu. On of the biggest disappointments is when something is totally not what you were expecting, its like when my husband calls and says he's picking up Chinese for dinner and walks in with a pizza box ‍. To top that off they just could not get our drinks right. First they made a white sangria with Tequila and when it was as returned it was brought out tasting exclusively like water with Splenda and syrup, when sent back once again they thought they would solve that by adding wine. They were nice enough to take it of the check without asking. Anyways, I don't think I would be back.
2018-03-25,4,Came here for lunch with my husband and mother in law. The food wasn't anything to brag about. Simple, clean, and tasty. The service was a little slow, but it was packed during brunch time. Our waiter Andrew was very nice although I didn't like that he didn't let me wrap my own food (most places let you if you ask for a container)--perhaps this is a policy at this place. We'll most likely be back when we're in the area.
2018-03-19,2,Very disappointed.  Food was cold.  Ugh.  And my friend ordered the chicken and waffles.  Heads up everyone, it is pulled chicken, not fried.  And when I say pulled, I mean it looks it was digested and put on top of a big waffle.  I would have sent it back but my friend just pushed off the chicken and ate that soggy waffle.  UGH.  Better breakfast at any diner.  I do not get the charm of this place because it was really not that great.
2018-03-12,2,have eaten here before, probably will not go back.  nothing offensive, it just hasn't been impressive enough to merit eating at a place with average food while the music blares.first, the place is nice.  some style. tvs across the bar.  not a fan of the need to blare the music.  even in the dinning room part it can be heard.I had the mac and cheese and short ribs.  The mac was not impressive.  the cheese seemed like the just melted a can of velveeta cheese on it.  after about two scoops of the top, it was no long mac and cheese.  if you watched it long enough, it hardened right in front of you, better than cement.   just skip it. that is all i can say.the braised ribs might have been better but for the sauce.  it tasted like ketchup with some added ingredients.  ruined the meat.  the meat seemed well done but the sauce killed any chance.the vegetables were equally unimpressive.again, you might like it but i am not going back
2018-03-06,2,We came here for Sunday brunch recently.  My boyfriend has been before in the past and mentioned they have live jazz which is partially why I wanted to go.  They dont actually do that anymore from what the bartender told us.The two of us sat at the bar for our meal.  My boyfriend did the brunch buffet which is about $30 a person.  I chose to order off of the menu.   The whole experience was awkward with the staff - with them either constantly clearing our place settings, or being very inattentive.   As I said my boyfriend did the buffet which usually implies the person will go up to grab food more than once.  Every time he did they would clear his place setting and utensils.  Then when he would return one of us would need to flag down the bartender which would take a while since they were busy for more utensils.  For my meal I ordered a soup and salad entree.  Both came out very fast and together.  I asked the bartender to bring my salad back because we planned to stay a while for drinks/food.  I think they just put my salad (with warm chicken on top) in the back for 30 minutes and brought me out the same one because the food was then cold.  I realize its a salad and should be cold but it also grossed me out thinking it was just sitting in the kitchen somewhere.  Anyway - I don't think we will be back here again any time soon.  The service was really bad at the bar, and there are many other brunch spots in Hoboken and Jersey City.
2018-03-03,1,Regular customers because we live 2 blocks away. Tonight for "Leprechaun Day" we got turned away. From the dining room. Not the bar. Guy in the front told us they were way too busy and all of the tables were reserved. The tables were 75% empty. Just lost regulars Madison. And when we go normally as a family it's for 6 people. City Bistro and Hudson Tavern just got more business every week.
2018-02-20,5,I love this place! I have been going here for the last few years at least once a week. The food is amazing and the service is great! They always try to accommodate with my special food request.
2018-01-25,4,I truly enjoyed this place, great food, nice craft beer list, although somewhat limited awesome nonetheless. I ordered Hanger Steak w/black beans, rice 'n potatoes. Prepared perfectly and delish. Bartender Randy was super attentive a pleasure to talk with, I look forward to coming back and exploring their amazing menu.
2018-01-24,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week LunchFood - 5/5. Aloo tikki chole was full of flavor. The curry meshed well with the sweetness of the chutney. Chickpeas were creamy and smooth while the potato pattie added a nice crispy texture. Jersey devil was cooked to desired doneness although I personally find the concept can't help but create a messy, overly rich combination. French fries had great crunch to them. Molten cake was delicious with the flourless nature making for a rich, smooth and delightful experience.Service - 4/5. Professional and attentive. They were very timely with refills and plates.Value - 5/5. The food was good and had unique flavors to offer. They also have a large variety of choices for their prix fixe which I find makes for great restaurant week menus. Definitely worth a visit!Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-01-22,4,We went for brunch with our adult kids and their friends. We ordered Mamosa's and bloody Mary's they were delicious. Some of us had salad some of us has Panini's we had a gluten-free pizza that was delicious. Everything we ate was very good the service was excellent but Sunday morning the music was  a little loud.
2018-01-16,3,I used to come here when I lived in Hoboken, and it's always a decent experience whether it be drinks, dinner, or brunch.  Their menu is large and varied enough that you can always find something for everyone, and they have a pretty good selection of craft beers.  It's also nice that it's a slightly older crowd (ie. not college kids).I was driving through town yesterday so I stopped in for lunch for the first time in a while.  I had the short rib grilled cheese with truffle fries and a side of mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like easy mac - would not recommend.  The grilled cheese was good, with generous chunks of short rib, but sooo salty!!  I was literally chugging water my whole meal and for hours afterward.  The tomato bisque that came with it was good and helped to lessen the salt lick in my mouth.  The fries were soggy and not good.  Not sure if it just wasn't crispy to begin with, or if it sat for a while before being brought out.  In fact, neither my sandwich nor my bisque were hot.  I'd still come back here if I were in town, but I was blown away by how salty my food was - they must not taste any of the food they're serving because it was borderline inedible.  Our waitress was nice, but there were about 5 people at the hostess stand doing absolutely nothing, and didn't say bye or thank you when we left, which I would expect from any restaurant, especially if there's that many people just standing around gossiping.I still think it's one of the better places for bar food in Hoboken, but they could really stand to improve the execution of their food and overall attention to detail/service.
2017-12-17,1,In the past 15 years, you could always rely on the Madison for a solid meal. Four of us had brunch there today and all four meals were subpar. French fries came out cold; omelette had wrong ingredients: and medium rare burger was super well done. We came expecting to do the buffet brunch which was great in the past, but the choices were so poor for $32 that we passed for the menu orders which were also so disappointing. Will not be going back anytime soon.
2017-12-16,4,Brunch buffet for $30 a person.  Or you can order from the al a cart menu options. If u are hungry and have a few people u want to dine with, the brunch here is a great option and has some variety.
2017-12-13,5,Came here with my coworkers. I ordered the big "mic" burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I ordered the patties medium rare and they did not disappoint. Also, they were not lying when they said big. It's a humongous burger and it was delicious. My coworkers got the crab cake sliders, chicken BLT and one of their pizzas and they all loved it! Highly recommend it to anyone in the area!
2017-11-07,4,Went for brunch Sunday with a friend after another local spot had a wait of 1 hour+. There is plenty of seating and they offer a brunch buffet on Sundays as well. Pricing for the buffet is $31 for adults and $16 for children. If we were hungrier we would have done the buffet, but there was just so much food there as well as a chocolate fountain at the end.I ended up getting the tostadas and my friend got the breakfast bruschetta. Both were amazing and my portion was so big I ended up eating it for lunch the next day. I would definitely recommend it if you're in the area.
2017-11-05,5,I absolutely LOVE the Madison. This is one of my favorite spots in Uptown Hoboken. The restaurant has both outdoor and indoor seating - it also is a decent-sized location, which is always a good thing in my book. All of the food is fantastic, and the bar scene at night is great - it's a nicer/less touristy spot in Hoboken. For food, the Mac & Cheese is the BEST - I randomly crave it and need to go lol! The Chicken & Steak Paninis are also really good. Highly recommend!
2017-10-29,1,Rude and dumb sums up my experience. A raining Sunday morning I walked in just to want a quality brunch. Given how much they charge 13-20/entree and 31/buffet I thought it would be a good place. Told they had huge parties coming so I had to either sit at the bar or wait. We chose to sit at the bar and nightmare started from here. One bartender for the entire bar area. She was chatting away with other waiters and not paying any attention of guest sitting down. When we walked all the way down to grab her attention she reluctantly came with menus. I ordered a three egg omelette. Came the omelette and it was just eggs!! I went to ask why it was just eggs and none of the ingredients listed were added. She said you didn't say you want other stuff in your eggs. "So it is just three eggs cooked in omelette style?" "Yes." "But you did not mention to me when i ordered I needed to choose." And she just shrugged. What people in their right mind would order a 13 dollar "omelette" without anything else in it?!?! She just stood there without offering any solutions.  No sorry can I make another one for you blah blah blah... No sorry my mistake not asking...
2017-10-18,2,It was date night and unfortunately we were not too impressed. First of all, it was happy hour and our server never mentioned it to us. We had overheard another server talking to their table about the happy hour specials. When we brought it up to our server she laughed and said "ya but you didn't order any of the specials".. ha obviously, because we didn't know about it...The Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer was okay, but for $13 seemed overpriced for the six shrimp. The Big Mic Burger and Lobster Mac & Cheese were both pretty good.
2017-10-16,4,My girlfriends and I went here this past Sunday -- it was great! We were all starving and looking for a nice but casual place and this was perfect. We were seated right away. I ordered the omelet which saved my life. The iced coffee was also amazing. My friend ordered the pizza and I had a slice... also very very good. The best part -- the price! We were all super surprised that it wasn't that expensive. I recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere a little cheaper than Anthony David's.
2017-09-10,2,Came on a beautiful Sunday and sat outside. Place was not terribly busy either. Waiters seem all over the place finally got a waiter his first comments is how he has too many tables and the other guy went on break. (First bad sign your meal experience is going to suck). A salad and a burger was ordered with no appetizer. Took well over 30 min for food brought out by someone else we literally never saw the waiter again. Salad was wrong to leave something out took another 10 min before another was brought out. First guy comes out well past where we both would have ordered more drinks but instead asked for the check.  Wont be back to this place thats for sure.
2017-09-09,5,Great for lunch and dinner. Quality of the food is excellent and tasty and the variety is perfect. There's something for everyone. If you're looking for a good meal in a friendly casual environment I highly recommend this place.
2017-09-05,4,Great for brunch, lunch dinner or just drinks! Amazing atmosphere and decent price. Food menu is huge and very good. Highly recommend the French onion soup dumplings, chicken panini and the truffle fries! Service is very good and very accommodating. At night it is very fun the bar is big enough for a big crowd! Great music as well!
2017-09-04,2,Incredibly overpriced. Got a short rib dip which was cold and the Bloody Mary was bland. Don't plan on coming back for brunch again.
2017-09-02,4,Checked out Madison for Happy Hour (4-8PM) 1/2 off. I ordered the pizza pie ($8) was pretty good. Staff is attentive and friendly. They have a weekend brunch with jazz. adults ($33) children ($17) I believe it's an all you can eat buffet, including oysters and comes with a cocktail.
2017-08-13,4,One of my local favorites for any meal.  Generally great service, friendly staff, and delicious food.  Last Monday we enjoyed their half-off happy hour.  Even the happy hour included a quality European red wine.  Then I had the Jersey devil burger, no bun, with salad.  This restaurant is also very accommodating of our being gluten free.  Great spot for dates, families, or even just drinks on the weekend.  Have been tons of times and will continue to frequent.
2017-08-09,3,I've eaten here a few times and what I like the most is that I can always find something healthy and tasty to eat.  In general the quality is good and the service is good. - and I can normally find a bar seat.   A bit too pricey but not enough to stay away.  My current go-to meal is The Grove salad with a bean burger on top.  Healthy and delicious.
2017-08-04,4,I give this place a 3.5-4 stars for taste!  I came for the Hoboken Restaurant Week for lunch, which included an appetizer, entree and dessert, and I was surprised at how big were the portions.  I got the Tuna Tar-Taco as an appetizer, which was a fist-sized taco with stuffed tuna interspersed with avocado and a salad on the side.  I can't say I would order it again, but the tuna tasted fresh.  For the main course I choose the Short-Rib Grilled Cheese Dip, which was a short-rib sandwich with cheese with a side of sweet potato fries to be dunked in a cream tomato soup.  It was amazing.  I loved the grilled taste of the short-rib and cheese and it paired well with the tomato bisque as a dipping sauce.  For dessert I had chosen the Chocolate Molten Cake and I would definitely eat this again, and again, and again.  Next time I'll eat in their cute outdoor seating.
2017-08-01,3,Food is pretty decent but wayyy too expensive.  Adding Chicken to a Caesar salad shouldn't cost you an arm and a leg.  With that said, the burger is delicious!
2017-07-28,3,I've eaten here a few times and I always walk out thinking.. "that was okay". I'm more likely to come here for the drinks and the nightlife than I am to eat. The music is pretty good on the weekends and just an overall pretty chill spot. The crowd is definitely a little more mature than some other spots in town, which I like.
2017-07-25,4,I have been to the Madison on various occasions, but my favorite was for the Monday night special, First Seating menu. This menu is available on Mondays from 5pm to close and offers a 3 course meal of one appetizer, a main, and dessert for $20 a person. Unlike like other prefixed menus, I thought this one offered a generous variety. For the appetizer I selected the fried calamari and my wife had the mussels. Both were decent, although we agreed that the mussels were more flavorful.Our main courses of salmon and chicken were the highlights of the meal, both well prepared and accompanied with a delicious assortment of sides. Lastly, for dessert we both has the chocolate cake because the other two options were just gelato or ice cream, and let's be real who can resist chocolate cake?Overall, a solid meal for a great price!
2017-07-16,1,Giving this place 1 star since we didn't get to eat here.Came for Sunday brunch and wanted to sit outside. The young hostess told us we can't sit at a four top even though there was another couple sitting at a table for four. It was the only table in the shade. It was pretty empty so I can't understand why the hostess decided she would rather lose customers than go against the "rules". smh... Ended up going to another place up the street and had a fabulous brunch.
2017-07-09,1,The AIDS virus started here: I went to MB&G on 7/9/17 for dinner, this is 1000000% the most disgusting place I've ever been (including college). After walking in, I visited the men's restroom, which was covered in vomit, blood and urine. After that exciting discovery I was shown to my table. I unrolled my napkin with silverware, which had 5-7 pieces of long women's hair entangled. After asking for new utensils I turned over my appetizer plate (was face down when we were seated), once turned over the plate was still covered in food from the previous user. After discovering this our waitress was bothered by me requesting new silverware, napkin and plate. After 15 minutes we were informed our order was confused with another table. I don't leave yelp reviews, 99.9% of the time it's unfortunate circumstances, but this was all out disregard for the health of the patrons. You could eat ice cream off the sidewalk on 14&Washington in hoboken and it'll be more sanitary (yes, that includes the dog feces and urine).
2017-07-02,5,We were meeting friends for dinner that were driving all the way from Long Island that have never been to Hoboken. The ambiance was perfect and the food was great. I had a chicken dish with spinach and goat cheese that I loved. My husband had skirt steak that he said was delicious. We never felt rushed. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. All 4 of us were able to talk and catch up. This restaurant was a recommendation by my nephew who lived in Hoboken for many years. Heard the restaurant is being renovated and will look newer in  2 weeks. Will come again soon.
2017-07-02,4,Very good food. I had the Tree Hugger wrap, which was portobello mushrooms, veggies and goat cheese. It was delicious.
2017-06-10,5,Best turkey burger in Hoboken! Delivery is always super quick and the food always delicious!
2017-04-30,5,Visiting Hoboken first timelucked out with Madison.   Food is outstanding ( breakfast, lunch, and dinner)    Bar area is swinging and staff is efficient and accommodating            TRY  IT !.
2017-04-23,5,ever walk into a place and just feel like at home - well this certainly is that place. The atmosphere is chill and relaxing, the music is timeless, and the service is excellent. They have enticing weekly specials from clams to rosé. Their menu has a great selection and their outdoor seating is fabulous in the spring and summer time.
2017-04-07,4,Good atmosphere, good food, great drinks and great service! Will come back again! The churrasco was nicely cooked (red in the middle, soft and tasty) and the pulled pork had such a sweet BBQ taste to it. The best part is, they have a dining room that's quiet and cozy and they have the bar area that is spacious and in a separate room. Hey also have tables there if you want to eat with a bigger group/louder crowd.
2017-04-02,5,We have eaten here multiple times and the food is quite good.  We usually get the caesar salad with tuna.  The tuna is great quality.  My husband has had burger and  my son has had the fries and they enjoy those items as well.  Since the restaurant validates parking, it is always a great option for taking the parents out to dinner. One thing that is quite nice is that you can sit in the dining room and still reap the benefit of the happy hour drink deal.Also, the bar area and the dining room is completely separated so you can have a quiet dinner even if the bar is quite happening that night.
2017-03-28,5,Always a lovely experience at Madison! Great food and great service.
2017-03-14,4,I was here for a friend's birthday with a large group of roughly 20 people. The waitstaff was really good and accommodating. The dining room was pleasant, but loud. My end of the table shared the French onion soup dumplings which were delicious, but there were only five per order. Next time we need more! We also got guac and chips, which was gussied up with a bit of mango. Not earth shatteringly amazing, but good. As an entree I had a short rib grilled cheese sandwich which comes with a little dish of tomato bisque. It was cute and tasty, but the sandwich was a bit soggy, not quite as crisp as I would've liked.
2017-03-05,5,You've got to check out their brunch! Great selection on the menu of both traditional brunch fare, and a few unique dishes as well. Great drink menu with a good sized beer list. Big mix of friend groups, families, older, younger, seems that everyone can enjoy themselves here! Service was great, food was delicious, and I would definitely come back when I'm in the area!
2017-03-05,5,Talk about an experience on Madison Ave! JK, it was in Hoboken! Start to finish our experience was perfect. Although we were told to wait 30 minutes for a table it only took 15 for our table of 4+1 6 month old. Service was great and the food was off the charts. What we had: -Huevos Rancheros  -Jersey Devil Burger (Dynamite!)-Steak & Eggs -Chicken Panini The cocktail menu was plentiful and offered a wide variety of beers. They even had my favorites 21st Amendment Live Free or Die. Overall, great experience, excellent staff, and even killer vibes. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu.
2017-01-26,5,I used to hang out at The Madison so much that my friends and I would get stockings put up with our name on it at Christmas time! I moved out of the area and had not been in over 6 years, needless to say one of my first stops back was to have an Organic martini and dinner with friends. We had the lobster cocktail, lobster mac and cheese to start and ordered a bunch of other maps from the menu to share. Everything was even better than I remembered! I love the vibe of The Madison and recommend it for dinner or just drinks!!
2017-01-22,5,Great service! We waited a little long for our food and the manager personally came up to our table and talked to us. Things happen that you can't control- and it's how you handle it that matters. The food was awesome too. We will be back
2017-01-19,3,My husband and I moved uptown recently and Madison is in the neighborhood, so we thought we'd check it out.We came pretty late on a Friday night for dinner - the restaurant was moderately busy and the atmosphere was nice.For drinks, my husband ordered a local beer that he said was very good. I ordered a class of red wine that was absolute swill.  It made me cringe every time I took a sip, and in the end I ended up abandoning it and ordering a glass of something else which was better, but not by much.  So, definitely not a place for wine drinkers.We started with the potato chip nachos, which were ok.  For dinner, I had the roast chicken which was pretty good.  And my husband had the Chicken Rafael which he said was pretty solid.It's kind of the typical generic American restaurant Hoboken is rife with, and not even the best of the bunch, but the food and atmosphere were decent so for a quick bite, why not?
2017-01-18,3,Here's the deal: I think a lot of reviews are based off of expectation.  This was my 2nd visit for a business lunch. My initial visit wasn't anything memorable, and I was reluctant to go back.  Thankfully I did!  Our server was great offering recommendations off the menu.  The Calamari appetizer was very good!  IT has a nice crisp crunch (not greasy at all)  The sweet-chili side sauce added a different spin to the Calamari!   The Clinton Chicken Club was very good as well was the burger!  Happy to come back again soon!
2017-01-15,4,The food is really good, peaceful place, the portions are too small but the flavor is perfect, good price...
2016-12-12,5,I have become quite tolerable and understanding regarding human error and I realize "stuff" happens. How you handle the "stuff" is what matters.We stopped in for a quick bite the other night and there was a hiccup with the order.The server got the manager involved and they immediately rectified the situation, turning lemons into lemonade. As for the food, the burger was excellent and the oysters delish!
2016-12-07,5,We had a great time for half price martinis I ordered The OrganicShe had "All my ex's"Our bartender Mike was pretty coolIt was a slow night and I liked that.  Me and my friend wanted a good drink not a crowd. Nice place
2016-10-16,2,Popularity has not been great for this restaurant.  Food is insipid and actually has bad undertones. Salad dressing tasted rancid.  Steak arrived overdone.  Fish dish did also.  Popular items are missing from menu.  Noise level is horrific.
2016-10-02,5,So much fun and such good food.  They do validate parking but it is only for 2 hours. We happened to spend 3 hours there so we had to pay a bit for parking.  The manger, Allison Friedman, let us know that we were over our time limit.  She actually alerted us 10minutes before our "free parking" expired.  There are so many places in Hoboken to have a meal.  The Madison Bar and Grill delivers on every level.
2016-09-27,3,oddly enough, I've never been to the Madison before this past weekend. it seems pretty similar to many other Hoboken bars in terms of look and feel. clientele skews a little more towards the 27-35 range, thankfully. there was a trashy girl making out with a guy who I'm fairly sure was Yanni, but that was the exception rather than the rule. overall the rest of the people were normal and just enjoying the music.$10 for a Tanqueray/club soda; roughly what I expected in terms of price, but surprisingly potent. not really a destination for me, but good for a drink or two if you decide to make a night of bar-hopping around the northern end of Hoboken.
2016-09-17,3,Ordered off of seamless and was overall pleased. The delivery came one time. Ordered the filet mignon sliders which were cooked well although 3 were crammed into a small plastic container. Also had the four cheese pizza with truffle. Very good although the prosciutto was only meh and I didn't love the leaves. Overall though would order from here again. Ordered again and got the short rib pizza with mushrooms - extremely tasty - although had some digestion problems later!
2016-09-14,4,The brunch on Sunday's is great, especially the creme brûlée French toast. Sometimes there's a live jazz band which is very pleasant. All you can eat. The staff is pleasant. And brunch includes one alcoholic beverage. They need to bring back the ahi tuna dinner entree with black beans, plantains and yuca. The new ahi dish is good but not great, not the same.
2016-09-08,5,I came with my wife on the afternoon I got the belly pork sliders and were one of the best thing I ever try, the meat was crispy and tasty, the slaw was a perfect match for the belly and the bun was fresh and moist , my wife had to wait a little bit longer for her Mac and cheese but the waiting time was totally paid back!! They were baked to perfection !
2016-08-29,4,The brunch is delicious and so civilized with jazz music.  Also you don't have to take up valuable street parking since they validate parking for those out of town people who can't walk or bike.
2016-08-28,4,The breakfast buffet is $33 with a drink. Buffet includes shrimp oysters chicken steak breakfast food etc. French onion dumpling appetizers are good. There is outdoor seating, live music by the bar and then a full dining room. Families and young folks were both there. Bloody Mary was spicy and good.
2016-08-26,4,Had lunch here a few times. Most recent order was a turkey burger and salad with couple of glasses of wine:A) Tastiest turkey burger I've ever had. Moist and not the typical meat puck most places serve. B) Regular garden salad. Nothing exciting but can't think of ever having a mind blowing garden salad. C)Wine - Sangiovese - rare to see this type of wine anywhere in NJD) Remarkable interior
2016-08-23,3,Decent food at happy hour, still a little pricey.   Thursday night and weekends atmosphere is pretty good but sometimes can draw rowdy crowd.  Staff is nice and friendly.  Food just ok
2016-08-22,5,Love this place!! The French onion dumplings are to die for! It's located in Hoboken which is such a plus if you don't want to head into NY. The French fries are also amazing!!!
2016-08-21,1,We were looking to return to an old favorite after not having been here in about a year and we were very disappointed.  On the whole, the food was unacceptable.  We started with the french onion soup dumpling which was ok, but the lobster bisque soup was served cold and then reheated in the kitchen, which overcooked the lobster that was in it.  The lobster was a garnish for the soup, and at the moment it was reheated, the lobster should have been removed and placed back.For the main course, the penne vodka pasta had pungent, sour aftertaste to it making for an unpleasant experience.  The steak was acceptable and cooked to the proper temperature.  When we brought our concerns to the manager, he did listen and apologize for our experience.The most unappetizing point was when an employee dropped a utensil on the floor and then placed it in the what seemed like the same bin that the servers were using to reset the tables.  Whether this is true or not we'll never know, but gave us the doubt about how serious the staff is about cleanliness.  We probably won't be coming back.
2016-08-07,5,I was there on Friday ! And wow ! The ambiance ! The customers ! And the bartenders were so fast and SO FUNNY !! they had me dying laughing !! If you are ever there make sure u ask for Allison or Dani . So awesome and so hot !! Love this place ! Love the food! But overall a great place to hang !!
2016-08-05,1,UPDATE: I came here a few weeks ago with friends and had a shit experience (see below review). My husband and I returned to give it another shot. They have a "Free Parking" sign out front that's a total fucking lie. It's only free if you spend at least $60 on food! But they don't tell you until you've already parked and walked 4 blocks to the bar. So we spent $45, I tipped 20% and we were told we didn't spend enough money. Such bullshit. Don't say free parking if it's not! Lack luster service. Honestly the food and drinks were good! But getting anyone to come see us was freaking difficult. At least 5 different people came to our table during the course of our 45 stay. The only people at were punctual were the bar staff and busters.
2016-07-17,5,Two words: BRUNCH BUFFET. I love this place - not just because it stole my name but the food is great. I have never had a bad experience here. The brunch buffet is incredible, with TONS of options. I've been here to celebrate birthday's and for mother's day, and have never been disappointed. The french onion soup dumplings are great for sharing but I definitely recommend going for the buffet!
2016-07-09,2,I moved to Hoboken two months ago, not far from this place. Right after moving in I tried it and found the food mediocre and the service atrocious. Tonight I went in there alone (again) for one more try and have decided that the food is a notch above mediocre, but the service is unacceptable and the reason I won't return. I was a waiter for several years in college in a place very much like this. I learned it doesn't take much to be good at it. Tonight I waited incredibly long for EVERYTHING - from the waiter greeting me and taking an order (only after I got up and inquired with the hostess) to paying the check - every departure of the waiter was an eternity until he returned. He never asked if things were ok or if I needed something after the food came. In fact I was loooong done with it before seeing him again. I asked for a dessert menu. Waited forever. And then waited forever again for him to ask me what I decided - which at that point the answer was ice cream from the supermarket so I could get the hell out of there. Of course I waited forever for the check and for him to run the credit card. What a mess. It's sad. They lost my dessert purchase and any possible future business. I will NEVER return to this place nor will I recommend it. One note: I've found the place right next door on Washington - Bin 14 - to be way better.
2016-07-04,4,A neighborhood gem! The food is always good, and although I was surprised to see the recent menu change, it seems to definitely be for the better. I had their new quinoa burger and it was delicious. I love the ambiance in their back dining area. This is the kind of place where you can always guarantee a good meal.
2016-06-30,1,After waiting for 25 minutes to have anyone acknowledge my table (which only happened because I stood up and had to raise my voice and ask someone to come over).  We had one person take my drink and appetizer order. Thinking he was our waiter I figured he put it in. 15 minutes later, apparently the "real" waitress came over, no apology, introduction, or anything and asked what we asked for because she hadn't put it in yet.  At this point it has been 35 minutes and we didn't even have water.  Long story short, we saw this so called waitress twice only because we flagged her down.  To our waitress Sabrina...seeing as you clearly don't like your job, or people for that matter; you may want to find a different profession. You are horrible and if you and your horrible attitude are there when I come again... I'll walk right out.
2016-06-30,1,My friends and I came here on 6.29.2016 to celebrate our good friend birthday. Let me say that this has been the WORST dining experience ever. The food was HORRIBLE, very bland. Three of my friends had the penne vodka, the pasta was not cooked all the way. Myself and another friend had the chicken Raphael, if I'm not mistaking. Let me start with the mashed potatoes it came with It was so bad I had to ask our waiter for some hot sauce to try to give the food a kick. Our waiter never once came and asked us how was our food, how were we doing, etc. I'm sorry but this establishment needs a new chef that has a taste bud. Over priced for sucky food. But I will say the white sangria was AMAZING !! But my friend drink summer raven tasted like gasoline
2016-06-13,4,Solid brunch spot. Sat outside this time, hot in the sun. Still great beer options. Lobster roll was on point.
2016-06-12,1,Have you ever felt like a restaurant proactively doesn't want your business? Like they feel as if, "No, we're making too much money, here a few reasons you shouldn't eat here ever again." That's how my experiences here have been.Last month, I made reservations here on Open Table. Upon arrival, I was told that they wouldn't honor those reservations because they were already full and had no space. The hostess said that as she stood in a nearly empty dining room. Fine. OK. I returned there today, asking for a table on their open patio and was asked to wait 5-10 minutes and ended up waiting about 20. Maybe they were trying to see how long they could push the wait without us leaving. Or really just took their time. We waited it out of obstinacy and because we were starving. Just a few highlights from dinner:-- We'll start with a compliment: the beer list is pretty deep and solid with good craft beers.-- A friend ordered a Taylor ham and egg burger. It arrived without the Taylor ham. "Oh, do you still want the Taylor ham?" the waitress asked when told of the, um, oversight. Yeah.-- The lamb burger almost literally exploded. As I squeezed it and was about to bite into it, a voluminous amount of juice squirted out and all over my shirt. I've eaten a lot of burgers in my life and not one has ever done that. -- The food is fine but nothing special, but it is pricey. It would be tolerable if the service was even mediocre or at least just not obstructive. Dine here if you want. They may even want to seat you.
2016-06-03,1,Huge bug in tomato dip! I've never been so disgusted. Food seemed ok until this point, I will never be ordering from the Madison again.
2016-06-02,3,Was looking for a quick place to grab a bite along Washington so we opted to try it out. Outdoor seating was nice. Food was decent but not overwhelmingly good. I had the duck burger special which came with sweet potato fries, it was a little dry but tasted good. For appetizer I had the short rib poutine which was a little disappointing. There was barely any meat or gravy on it. I did enjoy the beer list however, the southern tier tangier was spot on. Overall an average place to get some beers and slightly elevated bar food.
2016-05-30,5,OMG.  They have these French Onion dumplings that are to die for.   Served in an escargot platter they are one of the most inventive appetizers I have had in a long time.  I also commend them for the chimichurri sauce and skirt state.   Wow.   Only disappointment was fishy ahi tuna but the other wonderful dishes at our party of 10 more than offset this.
2016-05-22,4,Overall, nice place to visit.Pros: good food, live music, not too expensiveCons: it advertises as 'dogs allowed' - it means you get outside seating and your dog is on the other side of the fence.
2016-05-17,2,I was going to write a long detailed rant about how insipid and badly done the food is here and how over priced it is, but I realized I don't like the restaurant enough to write that much. So I will be succinct: Heavy handed pairingsInconsistent seasoningOily French fries and other itemsOver saucedMuddled tasting foodA nice enough looking place but completely devoid of the most basic finesse, technique or understanding of food. Redeeming feature: they make a pretty good Bloody Mary.
2016-05-10,1,Horrible customer service. First ordered to go sandwich, told the waitress I was lactose intolerant and there was melted cheese all over my sandwich. Decided to give it one more try. Ordered a hamburger and found a long blond hair in my food. Manager said too bad. Did not offer anything to accommodate the meal. Disappointed and disgusted!!
2016-05-08,5,Love this place, Sunday brunch is my favorite! I have been here many times for dinner, drinks and it never seems to disappoint. One of my fav places in Hoboken.
2016-05-08,4,This is a great bar for an older crowd. If you are tired of the 21year old vomiting in the bathroom then this is a great alternative. I have been here many times for drinks and for food. I believe they do offer complementary parking, but please don't quote me on that. The food is just a step above bar food but does the job. The prices are reasonable and the wait time is not bad. I would highly recommend this bar to anyone looking for a more mature crowd and a nice atmosphere. It should be noted that Madison's can be dead sometimes, it just depends on the night. I would rate The Madison's as follows: Food is 3.5 Stars, Price is 3.5 Stars and Atmosphere is 4 Stars.The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-04-29,3,Good for a drink after work, but that's about it.  Food is truly a hit or a miss and it's more of a miss from what I've experienced.  We order some bar apps, fries, wings and peppers. Fries and peppers were not bad, but the wrong wings were brought out the first time and then after we sampled the correct wings that were brought out we sent them back because they tasted awful.  Definitely not the place to go if your looking to grab a bite.
2016-04-14,1,I used to love this place but they changed their menu and got rid of a ton of my favorites, including the tuna tartar. Please go back to your old menu and make your customers happy again.
2016-03-20,2,On the outside, the Madison definitely comes off as an ambient, upscale, and thriving uptown Hoboken spot. Yet I've given this place too many second chances to be fooled anymore. The menu itself boasts very little options; in my opinion the chef tries to experiment and be exploratory with the food, but it's average at best. I agree with most people who write that the food tastes like it's reheated, it is. Moreover, the servers all seem like they could care less and they're just trying to run out the clock. In summary, while the location is prime and it gives off the aura of quality, the Madison is just another run of the mill cafe. There are better spots around town (ie the Elysian, City Bistro)
2016-03-18,2,I used to love this place, but then they decided to change half of the items on the menu. My favorite Cuban sandwich was replaced with some gross pork and brisket sandwiches.
2016-03-17,5,Love this place. The bartender Dani is awesome. She had a great vibe. Super cool. Drinks were rollin'. I'll be back here often, thanks to Dani.
2016-03-14,1,I hope you read this before you attempt to go to the Madison. I'll read Yelp reviews from now on. And when they say "run away as fast as you can", I will.....The food was reheated and horrible......The simplistically wonderful Hoboken ambiance was non existent.....And, the service is provided by people who don't care, who would rather be elsewhere, and who are totally inept......I don't want you to think that I have a positive statement to make about this horse trough establishment and my abysmally disappointing family brunch this Sunday....I had family visiting, we decided to eat locally for Sunday brunch (a wonderful Hoboken kinda thing). With average expectations, we made a reservation through open table 2 days early. I have been to the Madison many times when I first bought in Hoboken, I stopped going a few years ago, but thought if should be fun, the company is outstanding, not expecting much, so everything should be ok.When we arrived we were told we had to wait for them to "find us a table", even though the restaurant was nearly empty. So after a long wait, we were ushered to a table in the back, in the dark, which I can only describe as nestled in the kitchen runway... we were directly told, in no uncertain terms, that "we have another party that is coming in an hour". Although I said nothing of the time, and wish that I had, and wish that I just left. I should have been smart enough to to say, Frankly, I don't think an all you can eat brunch has a time limit. The food and ambiance had its own inherent time limit. Not all you can eat, but all you can stand. The food sucked, the three member band was quite good, but we couldn't hear them from our table, in another room, in the back, in the dark, over the clatter of the dishes and yelling of the waitstaff. I even got a call on my phone partway through brunch curtly asking if, "I was going to honor my reservation and come to brunch". After saying we were already there three times, I finally got up and introduced myself to the argumentative hostess who could not have cared less about her job, and, was whist-fully engaged at looking out the window.  The last straw was the cheap tongue curling mimosas, one member of our party opted out of the inclusive free drink. And, instead had a small glass of orange juice. I said, ok give me his drink and charge me for the orange juice which is cheaper than the not free mimosa. Which the server refused to do. Really? $33 a person and 6 people, and, this simple customer curtesy could not be done. I used to wait tables. What the $&;))@..... They will never get another dime from me. That place is a ripoff of the worse kind. I am sorry I didn't get to read the other reviews on Yelp prior to my trip to the Madison horse barn.... Never again.
2016-03-05,1,The food is simply not good. I've given this place too many second chances, but have finally come to the realization it will never improve. The food seems like it's reheated. How this place has not closed is mind boggling. You're better off going for fast food!
2016-02-23,1,The food is horrible: Super fatty corn beef sandwiches , crab cakes were deep fried... Very unhealthy meal and you will get a stomach ache afterwards. The Price not cheap either.
2016-02-18,3,Our waitress was so friendly and on top of things. If I could give her 5 stars, I would. Our food was brought out very quickly and so were our drinks. Dinner was served with bread and olive oil which was a nice touch. I ordered the crab cakes, which were average except they seemed like they were a little soggy from the liquid they sit in. Also the Cuban steak sandwich was good, but a little dry. The dress code says casual but everyone around us seemed a little more dressed up. The tables are crammed too close together in regards to private dinners but overall a decent experience.
2016-02-16,5,Went for a belated Valentine's dinner last night and was not disappointed!  For $83 we had a bottle of wine, calamari, a crab cake, tomato melon salad, fusilli bolognese, Cuban style hangar steak, sorbet, cannollis, cappuccino and an after dinner cocktail.  Crazy reasonable,  great atmosphere, attentive service, and all the food was delicious.  Watching food go out to other tables we are excited to go back and try more of the menu next time!!!
2016-02-15,1,I placed an order on seamless.  2 hours later nothing so I called the restaurant: generic voicemail.  After calling seamless it turns out that they decided to close early and not inform me they cancelled the order by phone or email (or seamless).  They sure took my money though; now I have to jump thru hoops w/seamless to get my money back.Automatic F.It makes the owner & managing staff look like a bunch of dum-dums.
2016-02-03,3,Good ambiance for a bar.I ordered the truffle fries, the first few were ok by then it's too much saturated taste of either truffle or the oil itself. Stick with the regular friesThe crab sliders were at bit too fishy ...but that could be me I did like the section of beers they provided.
2016-01-24,3,I really like this place and the bartenders are great. But they haven't changed the menu in 5 years which really limits my visits as I know the menu by memory.
2016-01-05,1,As a long time Hoboken resident, I've come to regard Madison as a bit of an institution in Hoboken. However my last trip to the Madison will be my last. After waiting an hour an a half  we left, never receiving our food or a single apology or acknowledgement from our server or the Manager. I can't speak to the quality of the food since I never received any. It was a real bummer to what was supposed to have been a fun girls night out! Bummer.
2016-01-04,4,Been here at least 5 times ( bar area only ) and I am fan of this place. Why? The crowd is very diversified. You will find individuals who are single, married and engaged who really just want to have fun. As far as the food goes, I only had a chicken salad, a burger and hand cut fries. At par level. It is a small bar/lounge area so expect to feel like a sardine in a can on Friday and Saturday nights.  Have fun.
2015-12-19,3,I had the chickpea and mushroom burger.  It was good and interesting.  I would go again, but being vegetarian I'm limited.
2015-12-14,3,A solid joint for a little classier dinner or brunch. In can get pretty crowded over the weekend. I've been here a few times and the beer is always good. However I find that the food is always a bit on the salty side.
2015-12-13,5,Supposed to be dining at another place for brunch yet the wait time turned out to be 1.5 hours - ok pass so came here. Breakfast buffet was awesome! Went directly for the raw oyster and shrimp as well as the salmon (without bagel of course). Also loved their almond croissant but it was a bit too sweet. The best part was for sure the fondue, where you could build your own marshmallow, pineapple or strawberry. Really controlled myself to not eat too much...
2015-12-12,3,I liked it here. 4 of us spent a couple of hours talking over drinks and appetizers. The Mediterranean Mezze was outstanding but the Appalachian nachos were disappointing, as we were expecting more toppings. Drinks are a bit expensive for how much you get. It's definitely worth checking out.
2015-12-10,4,Really good restaurant, if a bit pricey for what it is.  The menu covers everything from entrees (salmon is delicious) to sandwiches and burgers.  Their Lobster Roll is a Hoboken take on the classic, and is delicious. Their focaccia  bread is wonderful, and on certain nights you can get a prix fixe for $18 which is a steal.
2015-11-30,1,Warning for anyone who cannot eat raw items-I ordered a salad with a ginger sesame dressing and while eating it thought it might contain raw eggs.  I called and sure enough, it does but there was NO indication on the menu of any raw ingredients being used.  I'm pregnant and when I called to let them know they should make note of any raw ingredients on the menu, I was basically argued with by the manager that most dressings have raw eggs, which is not true.  Super frustrating and very scary for anyone pregnant, with immune deficiencies etc.  I even noted that I was pregnant on my order.  Will never order from here again.  I hope I don't get sick from this enormous lapse in responsibility by this restaurant.
2015-11-05,3,At this time I can only give a rating on their drinks since I haven't tried their food. However, every time I've been here the drinks haven't been consistent - the alcohol content in my personal opinion is way too strong for my taste, but that could be said otherwise by someone else. We had a couple of their seasonal drinks which included a pumpkin old fashioned (did not taste one bit of pumpkin, and extremely strong) and an apple cider margarita (did not taste like apple cider, just tasted like a bland margarita). The staff and bartenders are nice but would like to see an improvement on their drinks. I will have to come back to see how their food tastes!
2015-11-05,2,The last 2 times I have dined here, the hostess was extremely rude.  She hardly says hello and acts like you are bothering her.  Last week, we came for an early Sunday dinner (we were the first people to arrive) and I requested we sit toward the back of the restaurant.  She told me no.  I asked her if all the other tables were reserved and she said yes and walked away.  We spent about 2.5 hours eating and visiting with friends and not one of the back tables was ever used.  After we paid the bil, they turned the lights on very high-I think to let us know they wanted us to leave-it was only 9pm.  Very poor customer service-will not return.  There are so many restaurants in Hoboken that make you feel welcome-this is not one of them.
2015-11-04,4,Came here to try the 'MBG Signature Blue Label Burger' and thought it was very good. Rich, satisfying meat on a delicious brioche bun with all the trimmings. The fries were good, but not great. My girlfriend ordered the buffalo wings and they were very average. I'd say stick with the steaks, burgers, and other classics if you are going to come here.
2015-11-02,3,Service was slow at a late brunch on a Sunday due to a larger party in the dining room taking up a server, waited 20+mins until a nice waitress came by to ask us if the other waiter had come by, took our order herself thankfully.  Food was good, get fries if you get sliders because the fries are really good.  There was a band playing, it was a little loud but the music was pleasant despite that.
2015-10-28,4,WOWFrench Onion Soup Dumplings... One word "Perfect".Shrimp and Scallop Ravioli was OK too, not the best though. Would surely go back.
2015-10-17,1,We just moved to Hoboken and had our first lunch here.  The absolute worse chicken Ceasar Salad I've every had!!!  How do you mess up the salad?  Not talking about the dressing which wasn't good, the chicken was all fat!  Really?  I kept spitting out the pieces, UCH!!!  So I ordered sweet potato fries hoping to get some pleasure out of the meal.  They arrived luke warm.  How do you do that when we waited for them to be cooked?  Just awful.  Will not be returning.
2015-09-14,3,I just had dinner here for the first time after driving and running past here for years. The food was sub par at most. It's a Monday night so we did the e course sample for $18 and some change. I ordered the mussels which were okay, the lobster ravioli and canolies. I got 4 raviolis. I was shocked that my plate looked so empty and it didn't come with any sides. Okay fine, I get it, lobster is high quality good so the raviolis must be delicious. They were not. The outside was so tough and I've had ravioli from Trader Joes that was so much better and $3. I also wasn't impressed with the service. Our server was indeed very nice however not efficient, I was given incorrect happy hour info (Martinis were excluded when I was told that they were a part of the HH special) so I changed my drink order to a margarita which wasn't even on the menu I received. We finished our drinks right after our app and weren't asked for another drink until we finished our dinner. I'd get it if they were busy but at 545pm on a Monday it was dead. We paid our bill with a credit card and didn't get a pen. Okay, tracked down a gentlemen (a busser) who tried really hard to find us one. Not really a deal braker but just frustrating. I may be back to give them another chance but I doubt I would get anything more than appetizers. Also it is not cheap by any means so my expectations were higher.
2015-09-11,5,The drinks were done to perfection! I had the filet mignon sliders. They had to be the most delicious sliders I have ever had. We also had the French onion soup dumplings. They also were delectable.  I cannot wait to come back and have the sliders again!
2015-09-06,5,Favorite spot in Hoboken. After work drinks with the warm goat cheese salad with salmon is a weekly staple for me and my girlfriends.
2015-09-02,3,Went here for the prix fix tonight. Great atmosphere. We sat outside. It's $18 for three courses which is really good. Quality of the food is OK - not bad, not amazing. BUT - I don't understand one thing. This place makes all of their money off drinks. So if someone, like myself, orders a martini and it takes at least half an hour to get the drink... that just doesn't make sense. I would have drank at least two more martinis yet I was begging for a drink all night. Hoboken is known for horrible service but why not prove that reputation wrong? A martini has two ingredients... Just sayin
2015-08-21,2,When I first moved to Hoboken 3 years ago I used to come to this place all the time not to mention it is right around the corner from me. Over the years the quality and service has not been the same. The other night I went to have dinner with my girlfriend after a long time and it was a horrible experience. For appetizers we got the hummus which was good. I ordered the steak sandwich and it was just bland and the fries were cold. My girlfriend ordered a pasta dish which was ok. We both ordered cocktails and the waitress took away my drink which still had plenty left in it.
2015-08-14,3,As we walked around we decided to give this place a try on our very first night in Hoboken. We took advantage of their happy hour (4pm til close) and ordered some Sangria, which was pretty good. They were having Taco Night (Thursday) so we ordered soft tacos and the Mexican burger. You get 4 soft tacos with your choice of meat; they were good. The burger was delicious and huge. The reason why I'm giving this place 3 stars is service. No, service wasn't awful, it was simply average and didn't impress me at all. I was expecting excellent service given the vibe of the restaurant. Food and ambiance were truly great and prices are fair. They seem to have a variety of daily events/specials. I would go back for the food and drinks.
2015-08-07,2,Don't think I have ever wrote a review before, but this place is so hit or miss.  First time would have gave it 5 stars, but this last time was down right awful.  Got a drink, app came quick, meals came while just finishing the apps (absolutely fine and should be said we did the early sitting/3 course meal) and then did not see our waitress for another hour.  Sat with an empty glass of sangria (good) from the end of the meal and then for another hour until my girlfriend went to the hostess stand to ask where she was.  Finally she came back and said, "you never got your dessert?" We said no and then she walked away.No I'm sorry for being gone for an hour, no would you like another glass of sangria? That one looks like even the ice has melted over the last hour.. Just walked away.Came back with dessert and I asked for the check.That's it.Food wasn't as good tonight as it has been, but service was absolutely awful. Waitress ZERO stars, bus boys 5 stars, food 3 stars tonight (normally 4 or 5)
2015-07-29,4,Friendly staff and decent food at prices that will not brake the bank make this neighborhood bar and grill a place I will return to.   They have a couple specials during the week including a 3 course for under 20 On Mondays and half priced martinis.  Place always attracts a decent crowd.  Bartenders are always friendly if not overly talkative.  Asked a number of times to switch channel and always obliged.
2015-07-19,5,My favorite place for brunch because it has so much to offer. The buffet has fresh food brought out every half hour. The French toast is my personal favorite. It's creamy and melts in your mouth and the syrup really adds a light sweet mix into it. The also offer the lunch menu which has a wide range of selections. The brunch buffet comes with a free Bloody Mary or mimosa too! The service is also great. The salmon on the dinner menu is impeccable as well.
2015-07-19,5,First experience- not terrificWell I need to say, we went back to give them another try and glad we did. The food was fantastic, the service was great. Three dinners and everyone enjoyed what they got.
2015-07-12,1,Thanks for the food poisoning. Ordered the lobster roll and immediately felt sick afterwards. Wish I read the reviews of this place before going. All the one star reviews basically state how people found hair in their food or got food poisoning. I had the pleasure of getting food poisoning....this place is NOT worth it!
2015-06-27,3,Cool vibe - OK drinks.Convinced my friend to order a Dark and Stormy because she had never had one, but they were out of Gosling's so the bartender used light rum. She no longer trusts my drink suggestions.Laid back crowd sitting around the bar. A few excited young ladies getting wild on the dance floor early on in the night.
2015-06-24,5,We decided to try this place out finally, and we are glad we did. Everything was great, especially the service! My husband ordered the pork chops with grits and broccolini, and wiped his plate clean! Can't wait to come back for brunch, since the menu looked delicious.
2015-06-20,4,I've only had the Warm Goat Cheese Salad for food, but it was delicious and really fresh. I've been at night several times for drinks, and it's always a good time. I'd definitely come back to try other things.
2015-06-12,4,Over priced - but always very good food. I've even gotten delivery and it held up. The truffle fries, oysters, and French onion dumplings (what!?!) are my favorites. This place is super suburban family time during the day - and super clubby / kind of rapey at night, but if you LOVE 90s music like me you will LOVE the DJ. Awesome music
2015-06-10,5,Sat outside, great weather cute outdoor tables! Great service very quick for apps! amazing fries! Great shrimp sandwich and cocktails! Overall great vibe
2015-05-22,3,Went here last night because it was lit up outside but it was pretty average on the inside. Didn't eat the food but just got a couple drinks with my friend. The bartenders were nice but for a not-too-busy bar, they took a little longer than I would have liked to ask my friend and I what we wanted to drink. It was a Thursday so it was happy hour from 4-close. My friend and I got a Dark and Stormy, but they did not have the right dark rum for the drink, so the bartender made the drink with a lighter rum. I wish he would have told us this before we were charged $11 for it!! The ginger soda was flat too. Anyway it was a cool atmosphere and the music was poppin! Old school jams are my favorite.
2015-05-21,4,Their brunch buffet is a hungover dream. One of the better late night bars in uptown Hoboken, slightly older crowd.
2015-05-12,5,Five stars for the bar but beware the young crowd in their 20s.
2015-05-12,5,I love The Madison! The food and service has always been great. Allison is an amazing bartender with a great personality- ask for her!
2015-05-12,5,This has been a great spot for years.  Always a good crowd on Thursdays.  Martini night is a must.  Ally behind the bar slings a mean drink or two.
2015-05-08,1,Male came into the women's bathroom during operating hours. Ken (door guy) told me it was unlikely they would ever hire a woman to do this job and that there was nothing they could do... and that women should expect this.
2015-05-04,5,On Sunday night my friends and I had a dinner here. The place looks really nice and classy. Our waitress was very welcoming and helpful.
2015-05-03,1,Unfortunately Yelp requires you to select a star no matterTonight at the Madison Bar and Grill in Hoboken was a cluster mess of all proportions.We sat quickly, only good thing.  All else was off the cliff into an abyss.Basically we waited over 30 minutes, we didn't order anything so special.  My wife had to ask the bus boy for water and bread as we waited and waited.  30 minutes before our drink came.  My dish was incorrect and by that time I said I had enough; done!My wife are half her dish feeling bad for me.  Waiter didn't come by to apologize or check on us during the long wait.In short we have watched the service quality go down hill.  I'd rather spend my $100+ at a  restaurant that is consistently stellar all around.If you settle for sub par than you will not be disappointed.  If your like us and have expectations for your money and time, go else where until they figure out their staffing and management issues.
2015-04-17,4,Having a great dinner here. Sitting at the bar on a Friday nite. Alison is the bartender. I'm mentioning her name because her service is wonderful !!After I ordered I was offered bread before the meal - a great contrast with another place I won't mention where it is always a fight to get the bread, and if it's served its often after the meal. Not here - bread right away. Service with a smile. Good food. I'm a happy diner.
2015-04-17,2,I love this place on Thursday, the DJ is amazing and really brings in a great vibe. I went with a friend a while back and never made a review. We had happy hour. Food wasn't that tasty, but the sangria was delicious.The second time I came here it was live, fun, and really great dancing crowd. Me and my date had a great evening. (besides the ladies working the bar). If you're a regular I could see them latching onto you and taking care of you. They need to realize there is always going to be new people. STAY ALERT & look around.Do not order a mojitos they don't know how to make them here (even know she said she knew how to make one). I was drinking that earlier and didn't want to mix alcohols. Although, sticking with the same kind of alcohol didn't make sense because she made the mojito with vodka. NOT OK. (I'm very hung over right now, and that is WHAT happens to me).Being that it took 20 mins to finally get the buser to get ONE of the bartenders attention. When she saw him she rolled her eyes and then smiled (fake) and took my order. The point is NO one was seeing ME (I have an afro: hard to miss me) and I didn't want to leave, but at that point I didn't want to stay NOR didn't want to tell her my drink sucked! Hey, it sucked... Better luck next time. Then to make things worse, the bartender couldn't read my friends passport and took about 10mins to close a tab. I mean really.. Music: GREATPeople: GREATLocation: OKDrinks: Beer and AMF and Long Island and Sex on the beach (actually that one MIGHT be pushing it).Crowd: Mixed and Loving it.Age group: variety, but mostly 31+ (some 22ers)..(I'm venting so don't be made I spoke the truth of my experience)No Blue Moon: RUDE.... (NOT a fan of beer).
2015-04-05,5,We had Easter brunch here. Delicious food and fantastic service. Laura, our waiter, was attentive and lovely. There was confusion over our table so the manager sent us a bottle of Veuve to cheer the day. We will definitely be back. Thanks Madison Staff!
2015-03-10,3,I came here last night for a late dinner with the most beautiful girl in the world. The bar was quite lively for a late Monday night and they offerred a 3 course meal for $18.12 plus tax and gratuity. While I believe the deal was excellent I was somewhat underwhelmed with the rest of the experience. The server never truly made us feel like she was excited we or herself for that matter were there. My Caesar salad was as bland as any I have ever had anywhere. The dressing was a white, runny liquid that lacked any flavor whatsoever. My girl had the mussels which were above average. My entree was the pork tenderloin which was cooked very well and had a supremely spicy jerk seasoning which I enjoyed. We sat in the lounge area but there is also a nice dining room. In closing, we stumbled in here and managed to have a decent meal so 3 stars but certainly not a memorable experience.
2015-02-28,1,ordered the Cobb salad with chicken and got terrible food poisoning. First and last time I will be ordering from here.
2015-02-18,1,I've given this place a few chances and tried different things, but each time I've left feeling sick to my stomach, so I will not be back. Service is good, but I'd rather not have to cancel plans for the rest of the day/night after eating here because I feel like I'm being stabbed in the stomach. My boyfriend got pretty sick (food poisoning status) after eating the lobster roll once, also... gross!!!!! No thanks!
2015-02-16,3,I wanted to like The Madison Bar and Grill because it's the kind of place I usually like...  Decent beer list and cocktails which are 1/2 off before 7pm (not sure if that's every day).  The food however was very underwhelming.  I tried the truffle fries - decent but quite oily and not as good as other truffle fries I've had.  Mac & Cheese - this reminded me a little of kraft mac & cheese.  The noodles had a few random spagetti pieces mixed in and the whole thing was a big ehhh.. Finally I had a salad (been eating too much short rib lately) topped with Ahi Tuna and fried goat cheese.  The tuna was flavorless and the salad was decent.  I did however need to ask for more dressing as it really didn't have any flavor.I would say this is a good place to get some drinks and hang out with friends.  The service was good and the atmosphere was nice.  However, the food could use some work in my opinion.
2015-02-13,1,This place is a swindler. Dont waste your money and time Found a hair in the food and they didnt care.
2015-02-07,3,I went for lunch on Saturday.  The place looks great and the atmosphere was good too.  The service was great (quick & friendly).I was a little disappointed with their lunch menu.  Pretty much just burgers or sandwiches and a couple of other things.  When we ordered the food was very good.
2015-01-23,5,The best mac and cheese in Hoboken.   The French onion soup dumplings are also incredible.  I really enjoy the cheese burger sliders with the bread and butter pickles on them, as well as the French fries.   A great place for a casual get together or a business meeting.
2015-01-17,5,Love the buffet, which includes a mimosa or a Bloody Mary! Buffet price seems steep but it is worth it if you are hungry because the buffet includes some real top notch items, most notably the oysters, the Jew heaven lox and cream cheese bagel section complete with capers, the chocolate fountain, the creme brûlée French toast.... YEAHHHHHHHHH.
2015-01-06,4,Good go to place to take out of town guests or meet up with friends. The food, atmosphere and service is good. The prices are reasonable too. For an appetizer, you have to get the French Onion soup dumplings. So yummy!
2015-01-02,1,I found a hair in the truffle fries. Plus the receptionist is incredibly rude. don't bother order your food from here.
2014-12-28,5,Just had a great post-Christmas meal. Great service. Appetizer: French onion soup dumplingsOne of the best appetizers I've ever had. I don't normally get French onion soup even though I like the flavor combo because I lose interest as soon as the cheese runs out. But this is just five bites of perfect cheesy, soupy, flavorful deliciousness.  Burnt my tongue on the second one because I couldn't wait. Would def get this again!!Appetizer: Mini calzonesThe best one was the roasted red pepper and spinach one. The mozz and prosciutto one was pretty good but only had a tiny piece of proscuitto. The ricotta one was just okay. The outside was nice and crunchy with a flaky texture which was nice. Sandwich: Lobster BLTOne of the better lobster rolls I've had. So juicy, flavorful with a crunch from bacon bits. Fries were good too. Ate every last bite. Would def get this again!!Great overall experience. My mom said of all the places I've taken her to in Hoboken, this was her fav. :)
2014-12-14,4,Excellent huevos rancheros!  The portion size was perfect and everything tasted very fresh.  I had a bite of the french toast which was also excellent.  Live music on Sunday was an added bonus.  Kid/baby friendly, a 3 yr old & 6 month old came here with no issues.
2014-12-07,4,Great food, great environment, and even better drinks. We sat in the dinning room which was crowded but we didn't even notice the other dinners. The bread provided was delicious bits of heaven and the accompanying dips were even better. Our meals were both cooked to prefect. I recommend the Madison Cappuccino for a dessert. Service could have been a little better but the food made up for it!
2014-12-06,1,Last night we placed an order for delivery. Just to say we love Madisons usually. It is our go to place. Confused about what to get for a late dinner we decided to go with the French onion soup dumplings and the burger with all the trimmings. First it took about an hour for them to come (past 10:30pm), it was cold then tasted as stale as leftover bread. The only thing that was right was the temperature of the meat. For a place we love, we were so disappointed. Basically, do not order delivery from them but dining in is fine. It just seemed like since it was later in the evening they did not care about the quality of the food. It was such a let down since we were starving.
2014-11-17,4,I had been here for dinner once before on a date not too long ago and I must have been seriously into my now, boyfriend, because the menu seemed more intriguing to me this time around. We sat in the dining room this time instead of the lounge, which is much more intimate  and less rowdy. First, I absolutely loved the lemon ricotta spread they serve with the bread/focaccia. We had the spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer, which was nothing to rave about but a great start. I had the grilled tuna, which was surprisingly delicious. My boyfriend had the steak frites. We all know anything with truffle oil and garlic mayo/aoli speaks for itself. Service was good, we enjoyed the food (both times), drinks were strong. Thumbs up from this gal, will definitely be coming back to dine-in and order take-out.
2014-11-12,1,16.05 left $3 tip for a ToGo order Of well done cheeseburger and fries burger took 20 mins to cook i left to hurry back to work opened food n burger was completely raw threw it in garbage not rare or medium i mean completely RAW!!! Never again but they do get a A for presentation the bun had a lovley MBG branded on it was best part of entire buger n fries complete waste of $20 just my experience
2014-11-09,5,5 stars all around. Consistently great food and great service. Perfect place to go with friends for brunch, your family for lunch or a date for dinner
2014-11-03,2,Don't ever order something with chicken. I ordered the Cobb salad and I don't think it was actual chicken they served with it. It literally tasted like rubber and couldn't be consumed. My mother tried it and actually spit it out onto the plate saying there was not way that was chicken. You've been warned.
2014-10-29,4,I live next door.  Can't go wrong with Madison's if you want a nice casual bar/restaurant that's in an affordable price range.  I recommend it.  Decent food and a fun ambiance.  Brunch is good too.  Nice service as well.
2014-10-15,3,Great food. Great ambience. Hoboken, however, is the WORST parking city in the US. If you don't live IN Hoboken, either your shit out of luck for a street parking spot or you're paying $15-$30 for a parking garage for 2 hours. Shame on Hoboken for not thinking about outside commerce. This is an insular- thinking city with limited commerce growth as long as they keep this ridiculous parking system in place.  We have stopped coming to Hoboken restaurants and businesses simply due to the lack of parking and enormous ticketing that takes place in this city.
2014-10-14,5,Love this place. By far the best thing on the menu is the french onion soup dumplings! Its the best appetizer around! All of the entrees are very good as well and the bar area is nice and they make very good drinks. My wife had a gummy bear martini and yes gummy bears are floating around inside. Love coming to the Madison, its our favorite place in hoboken.
2014-09-29,4,Great place for dinner and/or drinks!  I love the selection of martinis there, with the cucumber and key lime being my favorites hands down.  Had dinner there a few times and remember the brunch being very good.  The tuna tartar was great!
2014-09-26,1,One star is generous...Started with the spinach dip which was terrible. A nasty thick, very bland cream sauce with artichokes and spinach. Barely warm enough and with what seemed like a pound of cheese melted on top.  Was that suppose to make it taste better?Filet sliders were a joke. Some nasty beef cut that had been cooked down in some sauce that was once again bland. Chicken dish was terrible and the mashed potatoes tasted like there was a pound of butter in them. Bland, nasty food. Never going back.
2014-09-09,3,4 stars for food, 2 for nightlife, avg 3. Came here for dinner once and it was pretty good, Artichoke Dip and Tuna Tartare were above average for the area. Madison Jambalya was a good portion. Came here on a Saturday night late night with some friend and it was terrible. Absolutely packed and $7 Bud Lights. Grow up this isn't Manhattan. Impossible to get to the bar because it was so crowded. Wouldn't go back for a night out.
2014-08-27,4,A very nice place in a town not known for any great restaurants. Nice decor, fun atmosphere. Interesting menu. Maria's a great waitress.
2014-08-26,4,Consistently good delivery. We always order straightforward entrees (sliders, truffle fries,etc) Food is always hot and crispy upon delivery, and we live way downtown.Went in for lunch this past weekend. Overall attentive staff and good dishes. Although the waitress was very awkward when presenting the wine...she presented the same bottle twice after she walked away with it the first time. And the jazz band is a nice touch I guess except you can't really enjoy conversation.
2014-08-18,5,I love this place. If it were not for the fact that I live on the complete opposite side of town and I don't feel like driving I would be here every weekend for either brunch, lunch, or dinner. The ambiance is very cool and trendy! The bar is timeless, it looks like it hasn't been touched in 60 years yet it is still in great condition!
2014-08-08,2,Sad. This place used to be my favorite spot last year. I would literally be here at least 4 times a week! All my friends were sick of me telling them to come here. A few months ago... I completely stopped. Their food completely went downhill. The quality, portions, and their presentation rivals only a local watering hall. Last time I went, my wife ordered the melon salad.... It was a bowl with sliced melons placed around the edges and just a bag of greens in the middle. Yeah... Real creative. Chef could complete on Chopped. The food? So bad recently. I used to love their Salmon with Risotto but now? The salmon seems to have gotten smaller, and their risotto is literally disgusting. That night I also got the Mac and cheese. Waste. Kraft microwave Mac and cheese tastes better. I mean.. Seriously. Try a LITTLE harder. I hate leaving a bad review, especially because I loved this place- but it is what it is. The only reason why it got 2 stars is because the service is decent, and the cheese and bread they bring out to the table is actually delicious. I don't know what happened, but literally I've spent thousands here, but won't be going back here anymore. Sorry Madison, get your old Chef or manager back because I'm highly disappointed.
2014-08-07,5,I lived in Hoboken for about 10 years and this was always my favorite place.  We went here often on Friday or Saturday nights, or Sunday Brunch.  Food was always good to great, as was the service.  I especially LOVED Tuesday night Martini night.  I'm not even sure if they still do it, but it was THE spot in Hoboken, for years!   Nothing like seeing a line out the door on a Tuesday night!  Knew all the bartenders and the manager and still try to stop in here when I'm back in town.
2014-08-04,4,Good food, especially the seafood!! Visited with my family for brunch! No wait and we were able to draw on the tables with my nephew! Portions were larger than expected with price.
2014-08-03,4,Delicious food and perfectly made Bloody Mary's.  Service can be a little more attentive and faster but nothing to cry home about.
2014-07-29,3,After being a Hoboken resident for over 3 years....I finally gave The Madison Bar and Grill a try. I've heard consistently mediocre feedback from other  Hoboken locals, so I've never had the desire to go out of my way to make the trip.From my experience, you don't go to The Madison for mind-blowing food or beautiful location. You go to The Madison for their awesome specials, lengthy beer/wine list and extremely friendly service.After walking by on a random Monday after getting off the bus uptown, I noticed a sign outside the restaurant for "First Seating Meal - 3 courses for $18.12, every Monday 5:00PM-10:00PM. Happy Hour 4:00PM-7:00PM." Seeing as it was 5:45PM...this looked like the best deal I've seen in Hoboken yet! So my boyfriend met me and we stopped in for an early dinner/happy hour date night.We were seated outside, and the hostess did warn us about the noise we would experience from the buses turning onto Washington at the traffic light...but I wasn't prepared for how loud it would really be! After a couple glasses of happy hour wine (Happy Hour 4:00PM-7:00PM half off ALL BEERS and house wines), it didn't bother me. The First Seating Menu was a pre-fixe 3 course menu for $18.12. Our waitress was super friendly, helpful and more than accommodating when we asked if we could have a glass of wine before ordering, and have our courses fired after we've finished each round of drinks.Here's the food round-up (expect small portions for the pre-fixe menu special):Appetizers:-Fried Calamari with a Chili-Lime Aioli: Not the best calamari I've had, but not the worst. It tasted like it was definitely frozen. My boyfriend said it was very "meaty" calamari, and I agreed that it wasn't over breaded, but it was room temperature when it was served to me which was a little disappointing.  I wasn't impressed with the aioli...it tasted like mayo mixed with chili powder and a squirt of lime. All I tasted was the chili powder...and not in a good spicy way. -Crab Cake: The seasoning was pretty good, but the cake itself was soggy and lukewarm. I prefer my crab cakes crisp and hot.Entrees:-Shrimp and Lobster Ravioli in a Cajun Cream Sauce: Obviously not handmade ravs, not that I expected them to be. Honestly this dish had no flavor other than salty. The "Cajun Cream Sauce" tasted almost exactly like the Chili-Lime Aioli that was served with the calamari, it almost tasted like a powdered mix.-Teriyaki Glazed Salmon: The tastiest dish I tried! The salmon itself was cooked very well (well as in technique, not temperature). The glaze tasted like it was most likely out of a bottle, but it was flavorful. It was served with risotto (Parmesan?) which was very cheesy and DELICIOUS. It was also served with a mango salsa that looked good, but was devoured by my boyfriend before I could taste it!Dessert:-Cannolis: I'm not a big fan of dessert or cannolis, but my boyfriend thought they were really good. The shells were crunchy and the filling was tasty.-Cookie Dough Gelato: I mean....how can you really go wrong with cookie dough anything? It was a great way to end the meal.All in all, I would go back to The Madison for this special! It honestly was what I expected, and for two 3 course dinners, 4 beers and 4 glasses of wine....the bill came to $85!! And the service was excellent! HOW CAN YOU BEAT THAT??
2014-07-18,4,Review for Sunday brunch...or should I say brunches because I certainly ate more than my fair share at this scrumptious buffet!The buffet consisted of fruit, bagel, lox, capers, pancakes, croque Monsieur, eggs, sausage, bacon, Benedict, OYSTERS, shrimp cocktail, and to top it all off, a chocolate fountain! Now I know that that sounded like a lot, but I guarantee you I forgot to mention half of it! So get on over there and find out for yourself!
2014-07-10,4,Quaint upscale tavern atmosphere with a good beer menu. Stopped in here for a quick pint and really liked the tap selection. Not your standard Guinness and Yuengling selection, they had Brooklyn reserve and troeggs. Food looked very tasty, especially the burgers which many of the regulars opted for. Staff was friendly and prompt. Definitely coming back for brunch.
2014-07-05,4,Great food and late night music! Good spot to hit lounge scene with friends, margaritas are strong but not good on taste side, crowded at Saturdays night but everyone should find something what he/ she like at Madison
2014-06-27,4,Came here with family and friends.  It was a great place to hang out and my first experience of Hoboken.  Drinks were strong and delicious (something hard to find), the music was decent and the crowed was fun (but kept to themselves).
2014-06-14,4,This is our favorite restaurant in Hoboken for a casual night out.  The atmosphere is friendly and exciting without being overwhelmingly packed.  The food and service are great and the only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the beer on tap could use a bit of a refresh.  Overall always a great experience!
2014-06-10,4,*the pomengranate (vodka with pomegranate juice and sour mix; super refreshing and strong enough; it's a very pretty color the I like the presentation)The bartenders are really nice at this place which is surprising because a lot bartenders in Hoboken aren't that great, it's a cozy spot with a DJ who on a Friday nights plays possibly the weirdest mix of songs ever.. everything from oldies to today's hip hop, regardless, I'd go back
2014-06-01,3,I've been here twice. It is very hard to find parking. Outside seating is nice! I love their yucca fries and their truffle fries. They are accommodating. I asked for no cheese on the fries and no bacon in the lobster roll and they said no problem. However, I have had better lobster rolls. The service needs work. They seem very spacey.
2014-05-25,3,Some weird arguments and bantering between staff made it a little awkward at first. Their macaroni and cheese and truffle fries made up for it all though.
2014-05-13,5,Love this place! Had a Amazon Local deal and thought I would check it out, so glad I did. The service was great, food was delicious. We ate early (6:30pm) and didn't need reservations.
2014-04-29,4,I have only eaten here twice, but I have ordered take out from them a handful of times and the food has always been consistently good.Truffle fries in a cone? Yes please!I also got a really delicious cocktail once... some girly martini type thing with gummy bears in it (I know, I know). But seriously, the only thing better than a delicious cocktail is a handful of boozy bears to chew after it's gone.If this place wasn't all the way uptown I think I would go here more often!
2014-04-20,3,I've been here for drinks,  it's your run of the mill Hoboken bar. Nothing particularly amazing.  Nothing particularly awful either.  They do have significant space for dancing during the week. First seating 5-7 p.m. $15 allows you to select from a decent enough list of wines (whites, reds, even a rose)For $18.12 you get an appetizer,  entree and dessert.I had the Caesar salad, dressing on the side,  was happily surprised the dressing was home made.  The salad was small. Ordered the hangar steak with rice, black beans and plantains. Steak was cooked properly.Had the pear sorbet for dessert, which was the best part of the whole meal. The price was right,  but I ate everything (every piece of rice, everything) and left hungry.
2014-03-15,4,My boyfriend and I tried Madison's out and we were very surprised by how amazing the food was! We got the French onion dumplings and we each had an entree of our own. Very good and not too heavy, just the right portion sizes. Out waitress was great as well, very informative and suggested great dishes for us since it was our first time dining there. It's not too pricey, the atmosphere is homey and comfortable- we definitely will be going back and possibly trying brunch too!
2014-03-13,5,The Madison ROCKS! I eat their on average once a week and I'm never disappointed. The food tastes a lot like a home cooked meal. And the customer service is impeccable. I had a filet mignon that wasn't cooked right and they ended up giving me a new steak and comping the meal. They didn't even hesitate. I felt funny, but accepted and appreciated the gesture.
2014-03-09,5,Always loved this place when I lived up here and just came back for brunch!! Still awesome.. Prepare to wait a little for a table  as they are really popular for Sunday brunch.
2014-03-08,3,I havent eaten here, this review is just for the 'nightlife.' I came here based on the recommendation of a coworker as a place that wasn't overrun with college kids.  This was definitely true and I was pleased to find that in my early 30s, I was not the oldest person in the bar. The music was great on Friday - they played a lot of hip hop old and new. The door guy was friendly. The bar tenders were friendly and knowledgeable about the beer. I tried something new and interesting on draft - I forget the name but was bourbon barrel aged and creamy. There was like zero diversity in the crowd so that was kind of eh, but no one looked at me like I didnt belong. The main reason i am giving this place 3 stars instead of 4 is that it didnt seem like people were interacting, everyone just seemed limited to the people they came with. The crowd was also lacking energy. It felt like a bit of a snooze, which was surprising because the music was so great. I would definitely come back to try this place again, maybe for the happy hour when the business is more full.
2014-02-16,3,I had brunch here with friends on 2/16/14.  The restaurant is large, and has a very pleasant atmosphere. My friend had an omelette, I had three eggs with sides, and my friend had their brunch buffet.  For $25, he was able to choose from Egg Benedict, chilled Oysters, shrimp, and a variety of meats, cheeses, and other breakfast foods.  He also was able to choose between a mimosa or a bloody mary.  All of our food was great and the coffee was not too weak or strong.  My only concern was that our waiter was not attentive.  I didn't have a place setting when we sat down.  I had to ask him to bring me a fork ( even after he put the food down on the table.)  He never stopped over to see if we needed anything.  When we flagged him down for more coffee, we had to ask him three separate times and literally waited 20 minutes.  He brought us our bill before he brought us the second round of coffee we asked for.  So, the food is great --- but I am not sure that the management trains their servers properly. In a town with lots of competition, they should try to train their employees better.  All patrons shouldn't receive their bill before they receive a refill of coffee they asked for 20 minutes beforehand.
2014-01-13,3,Came here for restaurant week, it's definitely work the money for all the food you get, 3 courses for $15 pretty amazing for my first course I got the mac and cheese, pretty good portion it was really good, very cheesy the sauce was a little runny but full of flavor, for second course I got the grilled veg white pizza, the pizza was hugeeee I couldn't finish it I had to take some home, & as for dessert I wanted the maple cheesecake, and the waitress told me that they have that today, which I found weird because today is the first day of restaurant week, how do you not have that, but whatever I got cookie dough gelato instead which was very good. As for drinks I ordered the all my Exs drink which I found to be very strong my sister got the honey Mojito which she said was very strong also the first time I never finished a drink but other than that the food was pretty good
2014-01-04,1,This place has gone downhill in the recent months. We ordered our drinks and appetizer (the crabcakes) at the same time, and magically our crabcakes were able to come out to our table within 2 or 3 minutes of being ordered--even before our drinks! They were burnt on the outside and a mushy, cold mess on the inside that barely had any flavor. About 5 minutes after our appetizer came out, our entrees arrived (oddly fast as well). My fiance had the Chicken Rafael and I had the Shrimp and Angel Hair Pasta. The pasta had a funny taste, mushy noodles and looked as if it had been microwaved, and I felt the same way about the chicken as well. I cook stuffed chicken breasts myself and it's not possible to properly cook a piece a chicken that quickly, so it had to have been pre-prepared or microwaved as well. For dessert, we had the chocolate molten lava cake--and there was no chocolate lava at all. It was just a piece of chocolate cake warmed up in the microwave. Won't be going back.
2014-01-01,3,Had an exceptional bartender today.  She was extremely attentive and despite being completely slammed and overwhelmed was very attentive with food served fast and drinks out almost as quickly as we could order them.  She was going strong the entire morning.   Quite impressed! In spite of her efforts the food is still just okay...
2013-12-23,4,Great brunch place in hoboken for $25.00/person.  They have all the typical brunch items like sausage, bacon, eggs, hash browns; but, they also have some phenomenal more high end brunch items like creme brulee french toast (which was freaking AMAZING and I would take home a box if they sold it as such), eggs benedict, skirt steak, catfish, smoked salmon, jambalaya, some pretty decent pizza, etc.  The skirt steak is also worth highlighting as it was immensely tender.  Their assortment of deserts is alright, some muffins and baked goods that I wouldn't really take a second look at in a bakery.  They also had a caramel fountain with a wide assortment of fruits nearby to dip into, so that's cool.  One drink is included per person with infinite refills, or you can choose to have a mimosa with no refills.  Oh and they also have a live band playing which was really nice.  Service was top notch too.
2013-12-15,3,Went here with the ladies on a Saturday night after 9PM. It looks like the quintessential Hoboken bar on the inside. The DJ was decent; he was playing some older jams... better than playing dance trash! They have a decent drink selection. We were able to sit down and dance without feeling too cramped, but it does get packed at a certain hour. Hoboken parking sucks, but we got lucky and found a nearby spot. Had a fun night because of my company. The bar is just okay, not really my scene. Perhaps I'll update if I dine here.
2013-12-12,3,I used to come here more often but have cut back greatly within the last year. The food is good across the board but the menu has barely changed in the 4 years I've been going here. If I have dinner, I prefer to dine in the back  rather than the bar area.The bar area is ok until the DJ comes on and the the gummy bear martini crowd moves in. Also on Sundays and Mondays, the stroller brigade congregates and  the place fills up with young parents and their children.  I am not interested in hearing crying babies or having toddlers wandering around the bar. That being said, I've always enjoyed the bar staff and I will still pop in for a quick drink on a Wednesday night when the atmosphere is more suitable for my taste.
2013-12-07,5,This place is always good. Nice setting in the back dining room, or even out in the bar, you can't go wrong. The menu has a little of everthing and they have solid specials.No matter how many times we go I ALWAYS end up getting the Jambalaya and my girlfriend gets the Chicken Rafael.We will always be coming back to The Madison!
2013-11-30,5,Aww man, I have so many fond memories of this place. : D First time I ate here was the night I moved to Hoboken, with my parents and brother, so I guess it's partially sentimental... but that still counts! Over the years, every time my parents visit, they always want to come here! It's kind of a tradition now. They deliver, too, so sometimes we'll just hang out in my apartment and order, like, 50 of their sliders (hahaha those sliders are soooo good!) As far as my favorite things to eat, I really like all the tuna dishes they do, and I've had every kind of slider of theirs dozens of times. : D Their roast chicken is also mad good, my dad gets that pretty much every time. In fact, I'm kind of realizing now that my entire family, for all the times we've been here, is really only qualified to talk about 15% of the menu. XD We order the same things just about every time. It's so good, though! If you haven't tried this place yet, doot! It's a nice place to take a date, and if you don't mind the price it's reliable for delivery too.
2013-11-23,4,We used to order delivery religiously from Madison Bar & Grill while we were living in Hoboken.  The steak frites hit the spot every time and was my personal favorite.  Dined in once and had a pretty good experience also.  On the pricy side for the type of restaurant it is (hense the 4 stars) but I thought it was acceptable.  Probably because I couldn't get enough of that steak!
2013-11-05,2,Service was inconsistent. One minute they're "up your ass" the next minute they're nowhere to be found.  Food was mediocre and small portioned.  Wings were decent however.  Seems like a better bar crowd than restaurant *side note: we were seated in the bar section which could be reason for service
2013-10-30,4,Great food, great atmosphere but the wait time for the food is EXTREMELY long. I have been here for dinner a few times and every time it has been "a bit backed up in the kitchen". Would recommend this place if your not in any sort of rush!
2013-10-24,1,Ate there last night and it was quite frankly the worst meal my fellow diners and I can recall ever having.  Two of us ordered the roasted chicken which had to be microwaved.  The inside was hot and-the skin was white, cool and jelly-like  essentially uncooked.  The opposite of roasted.  I sent it back for the tuna sashimi which was douced in soy sauce with quite a heavy hand and basically the flavor of fish was undetectable.   The crabcakes were all bread and fried into a hockey puck.  The vegetarian among us chose the chickpea and mushroom burger which could not have had less flavor if all the ingredients came out of a can, which I fear was the case.  The Yucca fries were fat, hard, white and completely unseasoned and was akin to eating a root right out of the ground.  The service was slow but our server was sweet and apologetic.  It was a struggle to turn over hard earned money for such an awful meal.   Please stay away so you dont suffer the same misfortune.
2013-10-05,1,Not sure how this place is still in business, but for some reason, they are. Well, after all, this IS Hoboken, so the bar for food is pretty low!It's my own fault, but after being disappointed over the years, I decided to try it again tonight--it's been a couple years so I figured, why not?Well aside from the menu that hasn't changed and is still as un-inspired as ever, the food was just NOT good.Tuna tartare to start, not sure why I thought this would be good, or even tasty, but it wasn't. Also opted for the turkey burger, which was as bland is it sounds.Overall, why waste your time, or money, it's just not worth it.
2013-09-29,2,I went here for a date, and sat in the dining room section, where the ambiance was very nice. It looked like a mix of families, friends meeting, and other dates. I really enjoyed my main course, which was an ahi tuna dish. My only complaint, and this is why I will never return, is that 3-4 people came over at separate times, asking to clear our plates. I wasn't done, I was enjoying the conversation, and I would have enjoyed my meal (and finished it) if I was given the time. I thought this was horribly rude and classless, and on some level I felt singled out. I did look around and saw that most of the clientele there was White, and while I do not know if this had anything to do with it, I felt a clear sense of wanting to be gotten rid of. Both my date and I are professionals (doctors), were nicely dressed, and enjoying ourselves until this point. I have eaten in restaurants where I can understand that perhaps they have incoming  reservations, and didn't anticipate being full at the time, and were hoping to clear a table. I recall one instance where this was the case, and we were approached nicely, honestly telling us what the issue was, offered to re-seat us, and gave us a glass of prosecco for the inconvenience. This is what I consider class. The wait staff and management here opted to send different people to our table several times, finally ending with a woman who asked if we were done, and before we answered took my plate. While the main courses were good (appetizers were like what you might get at a Fridays), I would not recommend this place if you're looking to have a relaxing meal.
2013-09-23,4,Sat outside with my small-town Mom and Grandpop and enjoyed the Brunch Buffet.  $25 didn't seem like that much to me, but my grandpop had a small heart attack.  Buffet portions are lost on me but I appreciate the variety.  I've had better oysters, but the frittata was good and this maple nut cream cheese was delicious.  The salad they put out was great too.  The bar we passed inside was really long and seemed optimal for football-watching.  It was a perfect place to meet my family and hang out for 2 and a half hours outside while picking at good food.
2013-09-15,1,My husband and I used to be big fans of Madisons, going once a week for dinner and dropping over $100 on every bill, but after today, I don't think we'll ever go back.  We went for Sunday brunch, which they say opens at 10am.  Yes the doors open at 10am, but they're still adding things to complete the buffet until 10:45am.  Which means that you can't eat the buffet foods in the order you would like, because even basic things like bagels and pastries were some of the last things to be put out.  On top of the late food, the quality was just awful.  The coffee is bitter.  The breakfast potatoes were undercooked, to the point where they were still hard in the middle.  The poached eggs on the eggs benedict were rock solid on the inside, aka overcooked, the creme brûlée french toast was undercooked, but all of this was still better than the dessert.  While I understand that most places do not make dessert in house, I expect that when you're charging me $25 for brunch that you're at least purchasing fresh dessert.  The dessert at Madison's is frozen, how do I know you ask?  Because it was put out still frozen!  If you're going to serve subpar frozen cakes, at least have the decency to de-frost them properly before putting them out for your customers to taste!  I did mention to our waitress that the desserts were frozen and the potatoes severely undercooked.  She brought this up with the kitchen, who did nothing about the potatoes, but brought the desserts into the back and then returned with them a few minutes later.  My only guess would be they threw them in the microwave and then placed them back on the buffet.  While our waitress was extremely apologetic, which was very nice, since it was not her fault, a manager never came over to apologize and we were still charged the full $25 and not even offered an extra drink or anything as compensation.    And that will be the end of our visits to the Madison, there are way too many other restaurants that offer a great product and a courteous management staff to bother with a restaurant, who clearly just doesn't care about their food quality or their customers.
2013-09-04,4,The inside of the restaurant was blasting AC so our party moved to outdoor seating. The bread they give you is pretty plain but thankfully the quality of the food only went up from there. My favorite was the French onion dumpling soup. The organic free range chicken was very tender (stomach just growled). Our waitress was nice enough and there were plenty of Hoboken street drama for entertainment.
2013-08-13,5,I do not live in Hoboken, but I recently hosted a bridal shower for my best friend at the Madison.  Never having been there before, I was slightly nervous about using a venue that I had not seen.  However, it came highly recommended, so I decided to roll the dice.  Turns out, it was the best decision I could have made for the event.  In the weeks leading up to the event, the staff was attentive, helpful, and made me feel at ease about the shower.  Then, the day of the event, they could not have been more wonderful.  We had a large group of people, and a LOT of decorations for the shower.  They were incredibly accommodating, and helped us set-up everything we needed.  On top of that, the food was AMAZING.  Everyone was raving about it all afternoon.  I could not be more pleased with how it turned out, and will certainly be going back there next time I'm in Hoboken!
2013-08-05,4,Nightlife- Currently my favorite place for good music and dancing.  Can get crowded so be prepared. Cannot comment on the dining experience.
2013-07-24,1,Long time customer, have always had a good experience here... Solid food, reasonable prices, consistently good bar scene over the years. Giving this low score for the super- creepy host ( skinny guy, 20's, blonde hair) who harassed my wife & me all night after we asked to sit in a different seat. Talked sh$t about us to the bartender, stared us down all night, intentionally bumped into me.  Too bad, because the service was always really friendly.
2013-07-24,4,Although I haven't had a chance to try their food, I can vouch for Madison's as the go-to place when all other plans fail. There's always an acceptable DJ, typical Hoboken flock, and my favorite beer - Peroni.Having been to this place on several occasions, I thought I'd average my experience in this one review. There have been nights when the crowd consisted of over-aged scotch drinkers and other nights under-aged vodka red-bull "woo" girls. So I think 4 stars is justifiably fair.TIP: Do not ask the bouncer to validate your parking ticket after 10 pm because they do not promote drinking and driving (thankfully, he had a sense of humor).
2013-06-25,3,Really 3.5 stars.Came here for the Easter brunch buffet and was impressed.  The food was fresh and the buffet even featured filet mignon.  Like any other breakfast/brunch buffet, they had little mini bagels, fruit, french toast, etc.  Not much to write home about, but good nonetheless.  The only think missing was an omelet station.  Get that omelet station in there and you've got yourself a four star review!Decor was a little plain/boring, but you can't beat the 14th & Washington location.  The service was just ok.  A little slow with just about everything, but it was pretty busy due to the holiday weekend.Looking forward to coming back for dinner.
2013-06-23,2,Visited on three occasions (lunch) and regularly disappointed by this place.  Food is below average as it consistently came out cold.  Service is friendly but slow.
2013-06-20,2,The wait for food was very long. Food was ok for brunch. we ordered a hot chocolate and there was no chocolate in it. It was plain milk with few drops of chocolate. We had to re-order it. I asked for jalepeno on my scrambled egg but got green peppers instead. No refills for coffee was asked. Won't be going in here again.
2013-06-20,4,You must try the French Onion soup dumplings! Sooo yummy. Though the Heineken was not as cold as I would have liked but not too bad either. ;) The dumplings are a must!
2013-06-10,4,I've never eaten here before so this review is just for the nightlife. It can get crowded, so if you dont like that, dont come here. however, what i love about this place is the music that they play. There are not too many places in Hoboken where you can go and dance. This is not a dance club by any means, but normally everyone on the floor area is dancing or "swaying". Good top-40, hip-hop, dance music. Drinks are a bit pricier than average. tuesday nights are half-price martini nights and thats always a great time to try their different concoctions. They do have a variety of martinis- yum
2013-06-05,4,I'm still a little prickly when it comes to the Madison.  They have had an off and on policy over the years of only letting in people 25 or above.  I do not like that one bit.  However I have dropped in a few times and I can say it is a great bar.Beer prices a a buck or two higher than other Hoboken bars but fit in with the uptown scene.  I recommend just sticking with a $6 Guinness.  The bartenders here work quickly to boot.  In fact I have nothing but nice things to say about all the staff here.No matter what day I came to the Madison it was never too crowded.  They have enough TVs to show the important games and the noise level is quiet enough that I can hear the person next to me.  All pluses in my book.I have came here for brunch which honestly was not memorable, good or bad.  I do recommend the edamame which I ate on a different occasion.All in all a solid establishment but not my go-to bar.
2013-05-19,4,Great local bar & restaurant. Friendly staff who are attentive and welcoming. Food is good. The bar has a historic feel but plenty of plasmas to watch too.
2013-05-15,4,I came here for Sunday brunch. It was delicious.  For 25 bucks, there's a buffet and 1 mimosa (or a different drink). there was live music .  The buffet had a nice selection of breakfast and lunch items.  seafood, beef, french toast (really good), the usual sunday brunch items.  There was also a chocolate fountain. (though not everyone used the stick to get chocolate onto their fruit, opting to use their hands so I opted out of the chocolate fountain) The service was perfect.  A nice way to spend a sunday.  We got there about 115 pm. it wasn't crowded. and there were open seats.  parking was a bit of a task but found a spot about a block away. drove around twice.The arrangement of the buffet isn't good.  it's in the bar area. we sat in the dining area, so we had to walk by the entrance and hostess desk to get food. also, there were tables pretty close to the buffet which felt a bit crowded.I recommend and I will be back.
2013-05-07,3,It's ok - not my go to in the neighborhood but if I do like their cuban steak sandwich and fries. There is this greenish dipping sauce that is awesome too.
2013-05-06,4,We went here after a round of golf with steak in mind.The tuna tartare was the best I've ever had.  It had great texture and spices.  The chips were a great addition as they added crunch to the smooth tuna.The hanger steak was ordered medium-rare and cooked perfectly.  The rice had great flavor.  The standout of the entree was the plantains which added a touch of sweetness to the meal.Overall this was a very enjoyable meal!
2013-05-01,4,Great Happy Hour type place. All the entrees are half off and so are most of the drinks. And hey, did you know they let you park in a nearby garage for free? 3 hour limit, but an incentive to visit since it's up on 14th street.
2013-05-01,4,Been a regular for a decade, almost had my wedding here. The bartender is always nice ( tall, guy w/ a goatee)...in the past there was one chick I didn't like so we stopped going for a bit but she was canned so I am back. The food is good but more cuisine than pub fare, try their pizza. Menu needs to be re-vamped with updated bar food options. Not a lot of us want French onion dumplings. It's expensive so I think that the reason they host a lot of "special happy hours" is to make us forget that. I go here at least five times a month. I think it's a good Hoboken or local option. Thursday they have a great happy hour and Saturday nights are packed w/ a bar crowd so skip. Also, do not park near there in the Hudson Tea Garage, I got stuck there now about 5 times when the machines broke and had to wait close to an hour to get out!!!
2013-04-13,4,This review of Madison Bar & Grill is about a particular time I came for dinner in person but I've previously used their delivery service, which was satisfactory.Went for dinner without a reservation and to my delight, the hostess was able to accommodate and seat us after just a short wait. Outside of getting a table quickly though, the rest of the service throughout the meal was relatively mediocre. I felt like the waitress could have been more attentive (e.g. she was slow to refill the water and took a while to bring the check). Overall I haven't explored the menu much and typically stick with the MBG signature blue label burger. I went through a burger & fries phase I consider theirs to be one of the most consistent in Hoboken because of the quality of the beef, which is dry aged and full of flavor. The french fries are seasoned with Basil, salt and pepper and are way good. 4/5 stars
2013-04-11,4,The truffle fries are amazing and the sliders are good combo with them. The bloody Mary is a must have!
2013-03-27,4,So this place is a Awesome date night spot! A Pre-Fixed menu option for only 18 bux...amazing and 15 dollar bottles of wine!!! Bubbly, White and Red!!! The food was really good. Sampled my friends truffle fries and Cuban Sandwich...Amazing! I wasnt too hungry so I ordered the Mediterranean Mezze Appetizer...VERY GOOD! I actually started to get buyers remorse shortly after I ordered but once my plate came I was pleasantly surprised at just how large the portions were on the app. Plus It was great! The price point was great on everything we had! Would def come back!!!
2013-03-21,3,Have been coming here for years.  Whether its $3 beers on Thursday or football on Sundays i'm there.  Food: at bar- Pizza, burger and sandwiches rock.  Their Bolognese is terrific and the Chicken Raphael is excellent. They chose a new location for the parking lot that Madisons will pay as long as you spend $60 bucks and stay for 3 hours. The old one (Hudson Tea Parking Garage) was a FREAKING NIGHTMARE!
2013-03-19,4,This review is for the bar only.I give Madison 4 7/32 stars. Went there last Saturday and from what I saw it gets very packed with mostly classy crowd. 25+ for gents and 21+ for the ladies to get in. Coat check-in ($1) is on the far end of the bar so you have to bushwhack your way through all the happy people to get rid of your coat. You'll be sweating like a cornered nun by the time you get there.Btw. somebody should really update opening hours on that thing.
2013-03-11,3,3.5 stars. The buffet brunch was just what I needed on the Sunday after Lepre-con. Had everything I could've wanted. They made us wait 20 or so minutes even though the dining room was almost 2/3 empty. They must have had some reservations flake out or have been short staffed.$25 for brunch, a drink, and unlimited coffee was a good deal. My girlfriend had gotten food poisoning from here once before so she wasn't super siked about going here, but even she was pleased with the food.
2013-03-11,3,One of the most consistent restaurants in town.  Maybe that's why this is the place my father-in-law makes us go every time he visits Hoboken.  The entrees are good, and the gaucho steak and hanger steak are some of my favorites.  They usually have a good seafood dish or two as well.  They also usually have some good wines up on the blackboard.The bar food is ok.....sliders, sandwiches, etc that sound good on the menu but are just ok when it comes to taste.  Sometimes we just hang out in the bar and get some oysters and beers.  It's a good time.  They always have a few interesting beers on tap.  I love scotch, and one time they clearly gave me the wrong kind of scotch....maybe they thought I wouldn't notice?It turns a bit clubby at night on weekends, which is kind of surprising given the decor, but it can be fun.While it's not my favorite restaurant in town, we always know what to expect with the food here, and there are no surprises.
2013-03-02,3,Make sure you get seated closest to the bar if you're doing the brunch buffet.  Its awkward to keep walking in between rooms every time you want food.  The food was great - especially the creme brûlée french toast but the service is horrible.
2013-02-27,3,Tried their $25 buffet brunch and the food was good. A nice selection of brunch items. So you're probably wondering why I didn't rate this place higher huh? Well when I rate a restaurant I'm not only looking for great food but I'm also looking for great service. This place seriously disappointed me in their service. First, the brunch area is by the bar. I told the hostess and she sat us in the dining area instead. We asked our waitress if we could sit by the brunch she got awkward and snippy telling us we were already seated and there were no open tables in the other room. Ok fine no big deal but it was awkward walking across the dining area back and forth between people to get to the buffet and then walk back looking like you just did the walk of shame because your plate is so full. And by the way there were several open tables on the buffet side but whatever. Ok I finally have my food yum but It was a project and a half to get our waitress' attention and honestly she looked high or drugged. She was so out of it. We asked for coffee refills and she was so spacy and confused. What's so confusing about coffee? Anyways we never saw her again until we got the check. It was just so uncomfortable speaking to her. I was just disappointed because the reviews were so high so I was expecting a much better experience. I'll try this place one more time in the hopes my service is better. Till then, you get a 3!
2013-02-25,4,I'm going to do two reviews in one ( restaurant then bar)Restaurant and food gets 5 stars.  The salad with goat cheese with AMAZING.  I have tried majority of the appetizers and was not disappointed.  Definitely recommend coming for dinner.Bar - 4 stars, really good place for drinks but depending on the evening gets VERY packed.  Went on a Saturday evening ( around 10-10:30) and could barely move.  But other than that, love Madisons.
2013-02-11,4,Breakfast Only review!I have been here for dinner and wasn't too fond of the food. My friends have been raging about the breakfast so I tried it. I had the steak and eggs and couldn't have been happier. Steak was exactly how I wanted it, home fries were amazing, toast and eggs were good, good service, good price, and i was stuffed by the end of my meal.I will add that if you want even just 1 alcoholic drink, you may as well get the brunch buffet which means buffet style breakfast plus 1 drink. This is a much better deal than ordering your meal for $12 then paying $9 for a bloody Mary.
2013-02-05,4,When I'm in Hoboken and in need of a night in (yes I said that right) with cozy American food, my friend and I will usually order delivery from this place. SPEEDThey take about 30-40 minutes max (from their location to 2nd street) to arrive. Food is never soggy or gross.FOODSliders: We order these every time. All sliders come in 3, served in mini fluffy potato buns (YES THE YELLOW ONES). Cheeseburger: The cheeseburger/hamburger variations are okay at best - just   char-grilled little patties. Pulled pork: The pulled pork is DELICIOUS, and I am hella picky with my pulled pork. Or any kind of pork, for that matter. Their pork has texture while being tender (it's not that fake flossy crap that relies solely on BBQ sauce to be called "pulled pork"). And they stuffed those tiny little potato buns with a ton of meat. Very filling, I usually can't finish all three for dinner. Meatball: Pretty good, one mini meatball per bun. Steak: Filet mignon meat in its own juice. It's good at best, but I may be biased since I was never a fan of filet mignon.If you're not sure which set of sliders to try first, go for the pulled pork!Parmesan/Pecorino/Truffle oil fries: We order these every time. Shoestring fries that are perfectly soggy in the middle and crispy on the edges. Comes with a horseradish dipping sauce that compliments the cheese well. This is probably why I can never  finish my sliders.Grilled Ahi Tuna with Spicy Black Bean, Yucca Frita, and Sweet Plantain Salsa: Holy crap. You know, you would think that ordering an entree (especially a SEAFOOD entree) for delivery would be a bad idea. This is a FLAVOR PARTY EXPLOSION in my mouth. The combination of all 4 textures and flavors made me feel like I was having a savory steak dinner. Black beans weren't boring or plain, the Yucca was fried tasty goodness, and the plantain salsa tasted like an unripe mango chutney. All good things. I imagine this would taste even better when served fresh at the restaurant.Side of kale: I ordered this one night because I wanted some greens. I wasn't expecting anything great because it's a side dish, but their kale is pretty awesome. I have no idea what they do to the kale, because I've been trying to replicate it, and my version sucks. Their wilted kale is garlicky, a bit salty, and probably has some butter in it. Good stuff.If you're in Hoboken and want some hearty, reliable, American cuisine - this is a safe bet.
2013-02-02,4,The Madison is a solid choice when it comes to dining in Hoboken. It's not so fancy that you're scared you'll break the bank, but the quality of the food is excellent and the crowd is amiable.I've ordered quite a variety of items off of their menu. One of my favorite menu items is the Warm Herbed Goat Cheese salad, probably because I love goat cheese! The rest of the salad is par for the course and can be ordered with chicken, steak, fish, or shrimp for a few extra bucks. I'm also a big fan of their French Onion soup, but beware... if you add it to your meal it will put you back $8, which seems a little steep to me. I've also ordered their MBG burger, which is undeniably excellent - flavorful and cooked just how you order it. The fries are also well worth the extra calories!I was lucky enough to visit during Hudson Restaurant Week for lunch and tried a few new items - I was blown away by the appetizer and dessert. I started with the Appalachian Nachos made of homemade potato chips with BBQ sauce, cheddar, monterey jack, and blue cheese crumbles. It sounds heavy - and it certainly wasn't "light" but the way everything is baked together it's more a smorgasbord of flavors and less of a heavy layered dish. For dessert I topped off my meal with the cinnamon gelato and I'm STILL day dreaming about it! Absolutely perfect. My main course was the shrimp BLT, which I had contemplated ordering on previous visits. It was good, but surrounded by the nachos and gelato it wasn't the strongest dish. If you missed Restaurant Week, The Madison regularly hosts an early dinner 3-course first-seating special menu for $18.12 each, plus the option to purchase a $15 bottle of wine to accompany your meal. The relatively decent price and the excellent food quality make The Madison an great choice for a flavorful meal!
2013-01-30,2,We went to the Madison Bar & Grill for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it looked very promising. The menu was decent at reasonable prices; however, the service was terrible and the wait was ridiculously long. Once we ordered, we waited 45min to get our food. We didn't order apps and our orders were right off the menu (no substitutions) so there shouldn't have been a reason for the delay. The restaurant was also not packed. The server never came to our table while we were waiting or when we got our food--not until the check. The only part of the meal that was beyond average was the sweet potato fries with lime sauce. Otherwise, the tuna sandwich actually bothered my stomach later on in the day. I would not recommend this place.
2013-01-29,3,Granite bar and hardwood floors... the interior is a sports bar made for a more mature age and I really liked that vibe. We visited for Hudson Restaurant Week and split:- the strawberry fields salad which wasn't overdressed at all but could have used a splash more of acidity.-Appalachian Nachos... perfect balance of onion, bbq sauce, blue cheese, etc. These were truly unique nachos and definitely fun to split with a dinner/lunch guest -Blanco pizza: The dough was sweet and yeasty with a bit too much crust for my liking but still a great consistency. The overall toppings needed a bit more juice.. perhaps a splash of oil or even a squeeze of lemon-Shrimp & bacon club sandwich: looooved that this was on rye bread, it definitely added to the layers of flavor. The bacon overpowered the whole sandwich, but it was cooked beautifully. -My lunch guest had the vanilla bean gelato and i was very jealous over it... it was incredible. I had the key lime cheesecake which didn't have any of that zesty key lime flavor i was looking for... Half price martini tuesdays were a pleasant surprise. Overall we would go back if we had another deal but maybe not on our own dime since it was rather hit/miss.For those with kids... it was FILLED with kids during lunch... lots of happy mothers with young ones so it is a good lunch spot for those bringing tots.
2013-01-22,5,This place is fantastic -- whether you want a bar scene, or a quiet dinner -- they have a room for each. I have never had a bad meal here, and everything I or one of my guests have ever ordered has been fantastic.My favorite -- the truffle fries.  These are great (especially for visitors around the holidays) from our 90 year old grandma to our friends from Europe the truffle fries are definitely a favorite! Pair with a malbec and enjoy catching up for as long as you like!
2013-01-11,3,I feel like I am slighting the Madison by giving it three stars, but these are three exuberant stars.  I have been here for brunch and for drinks in the evening to close the place down.  The buffet brunch is good.  Since some of things sit out, they aren't right off of the frying pan, but they are still tasty.  The eggs benedict could've been better.  The eggs were overdone and the english muffin was rubbery.  Other than that, the food was very tasty and the decor is very classy.  At night, they play a good collection of music that makes some girls dance.  Some of girls dance with skill, some others just awkwardly.  It's easy to get a drink even as a bear.  Check it out if you're ever hanging out uptown.
2012-12-31,4,Madison has some of the best salads in Hoboken. Not your usual boring Greek or Caesar with all kinds of proteins. If you're being bad, the fries are amazing. They also make really good girly martinis. I'd get them with dinner, as I can imagine it gets rather woo-girl-ish at night.
2012-12-29,5,I love Madison's! Always good, consistent food and drinks. Great service. Their menu has a lot of great options for whatever you are in the mood for. In general a great restaurant for the area.
2012-12-10,3,They have delicious bloody Mary's! I prefer to sit outside (when in season), at the bar or in bar area - I find the dining room a little too fancy. Service takes a little time but overall a good time. Love 1/2 price martini Tuesdays!
2012-12-02,2,Couldn't wear a baseball cap. You are a bar, not a 5 star restaurant. I appreciate what you are trying to do, but that is a little over the top. I can understand no jerseys, baggy clothing, etc but it is a baseball cap. One and done.
2012-11-15,4,I moved to Jersey City for a few months and wanted to take some dear friends out for their anniversary. After dissecting all of the reviews of restaurants on Yelp in Hoboken, I settled on this restaurant and it could not have been a better choice! First of all, the amibance was perfect for the occasion in the main dining room, which is quaint, nostaligic and romantic all at the same time. The first seating menu was superb! All of us enjoyed their food and the anniversary couple savored the experience. Hopefully Madison Bar and Grill came out unscathed from Hurricane Sandy as we would like to go back sooner rather than later...
2012-11-14,2,So, my boyfriend and I went for lunch. The atmosphere was fine and the staff very pleasant and attentive. However, we unrolled 4 sets of silverware looking for one that didn't have food stuck to it. I'm not exaggerating. He ordered the burger.  When he ordered, he asked if it came with cheese and was told yes.  When the bill came, we were charged for it. He also ordered the burger medium and it was very well done. I had the Polynesian ahi tuna sandwich which was very good. Although it was cold.  I'm thinking maybe it was supposed to be though, as it is called a "club".  But I think room temp may have been better.  Overall, there really wasn't anything special about this place and for the price, we probably won't go back.
2012-10-12,4,Full disclosure: I'm writing this review based off delivery only. Seamless.com, I believe you provide me with more nutrition than my fridge. I believe in writing this I'm going to invoke a self intervention...cleanse starts...Monday?Surprisingly delicious. The tuna tartare is semi-atypical served in a patty-esque form with tortilla chips. Despite appearances, this thing is pretty tasty. Also, they have yucca fries. Don't like yucca? You've either a) never had it or b) had all your taste buds burnt off in the McDonald's fryer.The filet mignon sliders are good, but the meat really could be better. The gruyere is a nice touch, but if I'm getting filet I'm getting it for the cow. Moo.For delivery, they've always been prompt, which is impressive and appreciated. Maybe one day I'll actually go in person? Perhaps I should take some bolt cutters to this house arrest bracelet...
2012-10-07,4,The brunch here is one of the best in Hoboken. $25 for all you can eat from a full range of foods. Plus a free drink. They also make one of the best bloody Mary's in town. Recommended!
2012-10-03,2,The Brunch is great, service is a little slow but the food makes up for it.  Been there for dinner and drinks before.  Would have given a 3rd star, but i dont like the strict 'No hats' policy.
2012-09-29,4,Good spot for weekend brunch with free parking. (3 hours - get validated ticket after your meal)Their food is nice and I like the service - fast and friendly.
2012-09-19,4,The Madison is one of those restaurants that makes you feel all fancy when you get seated. I took my boyfriend here for his birthday last week for a nice dinner and I was delighted to see that they offered an early-bird dinner special until 8 for only $18.12 a person. Having looked at the menu prior to making reservations, the dishes sounded as tasty as they were.The bread that comes on the table is delicious. I kinda wish we asked for a second helping! We ordered a tuna tar-tare platter as our appetizer, which was tasty but a little difficult to eat. It comes with very crispy tortilla pieces that are hard to crunch into, so I used my fork for the most part. With the early bird special, we also ordered an appetizer of calamari with a selection of dipping sauces, which was also tasty.We both ordered the hanger steak meal which came with rice, black beans, and salsa verde. The steak was cut and seasoned well and the sides perfectly complimented the food. The portions look small at first, but I was filled right up after polishing off the dish. I barely had room for my raspberry sorbet, which also came with the meal.All in all it was a pleasant experience and I would love to come back for dinner. I also hear good things about their brunch so I hope to update this review with how that is.
2012-09-15,4,Nice place to sit, have a drink and a salad, and take in the nice weather.  Good location, nice menu.  Definitely a great place for brunch too.
2012-09-04,3,Friend and I popped into here around 4 on Labor Day. It was not too crowded, not too empty. Good crowd. First time ever going out to eat and drink in Hoboken. I usually never leave manhattan. I was pleased at the lower prices, for both food and drink. Madison has an awesome selection of gourmet/seasonal/high quality/fusional foods. I had the polynesian club sandwich (seared tuna, mango salsa, cabbage slaw). It came with sweet potato fries but I switched it in for truffle fries. I love truffle flavored anything. The fries were the BEST. The seared tuna club came on a stale-ish brioche bun. The "slaw" was really dry too. I ended up just eating the tuna with a fork since I was finishing my truffle fries (again, those are A+) and wanted that to be my main source of starch for the meal. My friend got the mushroom/chickpea burger and his fries were soooo hard and stale we had to take them back ( he got regular fries, not the think truffle ones). The truffle fries were thin, salty, crunchy (but moist in the middle), with truffle oil all over them!!!! I got 2 blue moons ($3 each) but the bartender only charged me for one (accidentally, I think...) which was awesome!!!!!! Seriously, id go back just for the truffle fries, low prices, and awesome ambience. It looks like a classy brunch place. Family friendly, too.
2012-09-04,4,When in doubt this is a good place to go to, any night of the week in Hoboken.  There is usually a good happy hour going on.  You can't go wrong with half-price on all of their tap beers of which they have a good rotating selection.There weekly early bird special is a great deal if you can get out of work early enough.  For $18 you get a prix fixed selected menu that offers a diverse enough selection of apps, entrees and desserts to satisfy nearly all comers.  They also have wine bottle specials as well to go with the dinner.  Haven't really had anything we didn't like yet!  The last time we were there they brought out fresh bread with a lemon ricotta cheese drizzled with olive oil, it was so good we found ourselves eating spoonfuls of ricotta without the bread.They have the less formal bar area which is a nice place for a relaxed meal but it can get very loud at times.  On the other side they have more of a formal dining area which is would recommend getting  yourself reservations for if you have a larger party.
2012-09-03,4,Madison is one of those all-purpose classics.  Good for dates, groups of friends, families of multiple generation (grandparents, parents, and the two kids), bridal parties, girls brunches (as much as Marshall Ericksen might want to think so, brunch has not been claimed by groups of guys yet).The backroom looks like an old Italian joint, with all walls and very few windows.  The front room is half bar, half dining room.  During warmer months, they have two outdoor seating areas, one facing Washington Street, and the other, 14th street.Food is consistently good.  I have been here somehwere between 5 and 10 times, and dinner has always been good.  I must have tried every dish on their half-priced, "first seating" menu (roasted half chicken, pork loins, steak, and some fishes).  I think this first seating menu is a good sized portion, reasonably priced at $18 and a few cents (used to be $16 and change).  You get an appetizer, main dish, and dessert.  Limited selections, but good selections.During the first part of the week (Mon to Thu), they have drink specials.  I don't exactly remember the timing of these specials, but you can check.  I am a beer drinker, and respectable beer bottles are $3.  They also have very good sangrias.Been here for a few brunches, and you can have a solid brunch like eggs, or omeletts for for under $10.   Solid places worth several repeat visits.
2012-08-31,5,The Madison Bar and Grill is my favorite place in Hoboken for evening drinks. The happy hour is fantastic...Monday through Friday, 4-8, all night on Thursdays, half price the entire bar selection. This includes a great selection of beer and wine. I can get my favorite beer (Ommegang Abbey) for $3.50...cheaper than at the store! The bartenders are by far the best in town...ask for Darren or Randy for some great beer suggestions! Free wifi. And check out the pretty ceiling.
2012-08-23,3,This is a review of both dinner and the bar. I wish I could separate the two. For dinner the food is excellent, been there a few times for just food and it has been delicious. I'll start with that...We've been a few times all of which  were inspired  by either a gift certificate or a living social deal. But, each time we went we got a ton of food. This last visit we started with the mini calzones which were all incredible, and HUGE. The three "mini" calzones could have been a meal in and of itself.  I ordered Madison's version of a bolognese, whoa...mind blowing good! This is not your Nonna's red sauce. This was braised pork, a tomato base sauce and creme fraiche on top. It was literally heavenly. I was so full from the calzones though I couldn't finish it, but it made a great dinner at home the next night. The portion sizes are pretty good. We were also there for $5 martini night, I believe it was a Tuesday. This is one helluva a deal. My fiance loved her food as well, but I can't remember what she had. We ordered the banana split for desert. It of course was delicious but also giant. I had a food baby after leaving Madison. For the food, I give them 4 stars. They switched servers on us midway thru which was odd because the other server was still there, no transition they just did it, didn't really matter but weird nonetheless.As for the bar on a Friday or Saturday night, this is a cougar den. No if, ands or buts about it. I'm 30 (I was 29 at the time) and I felt out of place. This is an older crowd, not so much for guys but for a lot of older women, now they also limit the age of guys allowed in, men have to be over the age of 25 to enter. Not that this applies to me, but that shows you they prefer the older crowd. It was also a wee bit douchey and really hard to get a drink at the bar, it is really tiny, drinks are expensive and the place is just too packed with people wearing fedoras and sunglasses at night. For the bar I give 2.5 stars.
2012-08-16,4,Good for special occasions whether with Sunday Fundate or with a group for brunch!  Reservations are suggested for Sunday brunch.Must try the creme-brulee french toast!! O M GBeen going here since I moved to the area 3 years ago. Suggested by a good friend who lives in the area, and have been recommending it to family and friends looking for good brunch. Definintely another must-try for brunch on my list in Hoboken!FYI, don't forget to validate your parking ticket at the parking lot at at 15th and Bloomfield when you pay for your check!
2012-07-07,4,Another one of our favorite Hoboken spots.  Works for date night, group dinner, brunch, or happy hour!Food is good, scene is upscale, and not filled with college kids, as most of the downtown places.  Service is usually good, haven't had a bad experience and have been here problem a dozen times in the last couple years.Great martinis & always listen for the risotto special!!
2012-06-24,2,Sigh.  I love food - as such, bad meals are opportunities wasted to me :(.Went here for brunch today - service was fine..had no issue being seated though not everyone was there yet.  Should've been a sign when I was seated immediately at 12:30 on a Sunday.  I ordered the Mushroom and Chickpea burger - I wish I had more hands to give this dish 4 thumbs down.  The burger was falling apart and seriously had zero flavor.  It's almost as though they put no spice in it whatsoever.  Maybe they're use to catering to a certain crowd but my Indian a** was not happy with the bland taste! The yucca fries that accompanied the sandwich were dry and super crunchy - not in a good way.  They also were severely bland - no salt, nothing.My friend ordered huevos rancheros - and normally I would have had order regret.  But even her dish looked flavorless and was nothing more than 3 corn tortillas topped with beans, eggs, onion and tomatoes.  These 5 ingredients alone do not make for huevos rancheros.  Never again.
2012-06-24,3,Started out waiting for service which is to be expected on a busy Saturday with bridal showers going on.  We ordered a bottle of the Châteauneuf-du-Pape only to get an a Chateau Pascaud.  Ordinarily it would mean nothing since they are red and French.  But the price difference could not be ignored.  I was hoping that they ran out and it was an automatic substitution. Not so.  We were charged for the more expensive bottle.  Our waiter was made aware of it upon receipt of our bill and he apologized for the mistake.  As for the food, we order fried calamari which was a bit chewy, greasy and fishy.    Followed by two sliders, a shrimp and a crab.  The bread consumed the slider so  you could not really taste the shrimp that was in a spicy sauce with a good kick, once I removed the bread.  The crab cake was mostly crab, it was good, again without the bread...I think was a potato roll.  Not ideal for a slider.  I think the experience was not one that I would choose again.
2012-06-24,1,Ordered chickpea-mushroom burger and huevos rancheros. Completely bland and tasteless food. No spice or salt or any kind of flavor. Waste of money. Not recommend this restaurant.
2012-06-18,4,When I first came here with my mom, the atmosphere of the inside of this restaurant was modern, and old fashioned at the same time. The appetizers came fast. I got the Caesar salad, and my mom got the crab cake. The salad was amazing, but the crab cake, we thought, had some sort of a bitter taste. We didn't l LOVE the crab cake, but the pizza bread was.................... AAAAMMMMAAAAZZZZIIIINNNNGGGG!!For entrees, I wouldn't recommend the glazed salmon or the roasted chicken. It's just the risotto and the mustard mash potatoes. Otherwise, it was good. The desserts were so great, I didn't want to leave. I got the raspberry sorbet, and the lady across from me got the cannolis, with chocolate sauce. My mom doesn't like cannolis, but I do, heh heh heh...
2012-06-16,1,My boyfriend and I stopped in for an after dinner drinks on a friday night. The decor was nice, there was a fun crowd and the DJ played a really good mix of old and new. The problem was when we decided to have second and third rounds of drinks and had to open a new tabs. We were enjoying the atmosphere, so decided to stay longer than planned, so opened new tabs each time. The two female bartenders became irritated that they had to ring us up again, and one said to the other 'what the fuck is wrong with them?!' Then we got some attitude from the other one when she gave us the check to sign. Whether it was a card or cash, we shouldn't have been treated in that manner. We wrote a letter to the General Manager describing the situation and the poor actions of the bartenders, but never heard anything back. Apparently the bar staff is empowered by management to make negative comments about customers right in front of them. Unfortunately, it didn't work out too well for their tips that night, we haven't been back since and dont ever plan on it.
2012-06-02,3,After a Yelp event nearby, Vicky L, Wing L and I were still hungry, so we came to Madison Bar & Grill. We got the French Onion Soup Dumplings, Filet Mignon sliders, and the Fusilli Bolognese to share. The dumplings sound like a good idea, and the taste was good but I wasn't very impressed. The meat on the sliders was delicious, but the bun they used was too dry and crumbly. My favorite was the pasta dish. The flavor was excellent and the pasta was cooked just right.
2012-06-01,3,I've been here in different situations: with a large group of people, just me and my girlfriend, just for food, just for drinks, etc.  And every time, I walk in thinking it's going to be awesome, and every time it leaves me a little underwhelmed.  It has a great setup with the restaurant separated from the bar.  I like the look of the place.  The bar area has decent lighting in the daytime.  The restaurant isn't too packed with tables and it's not hard to have a conversation.  The service is hit or miss depending on the day (Last time I was there only 2 servers were working the packed restaurant area).  The bartenders are friendly.  Sometimes the cocktails are good, and sometimes they are not (I've had an amazing Old Fashioned there and I've had a truly awful Old Fashioned there).  The clientele can be pretentious at times (come on people, it's not the UES!) and it's hard to get around when there's a big crowd (like most places).The food is good, but not spectacular.  The prices are pretty reasonable.  My favorite entree is either the Risotto of the Day (depending on the ingredients) or the Caribbean Pork Tenderloin (super tender, full of flavor).  The sides aren't great (how do you screw up smoked cheddar grits?) except for the plantains (but I love plantains...).So if you don't feel like heading into the city for a date night, it's a decent local option.  But nothing more.
2012-05-10,4,I like this spot for happy hour, although some servers don't mention the deals so educate yourself before you go.  The French Onion dumplings and meatball sliders are awesome.  I think the best way to eat here is go with a friend, order 3 small things and then 1 more if you're still hungry (you won't be).  I think their appetizers and small bites are better than their actual dinner.
2012-04-28,4,Cool bar crowd nice little hang out
2012-04-17,3,This place seemed like it would have awesome food but I was left underwhelmed.  The ambiance is nice and chill, though, and the servers are nice, but...This place left much to be desired in its food.  My friend and I started out with some drinks and the french onion soup dumplings appetizer.  They make the dumplings in escargot trays, so the dumplings are REALLY tiny.  They are filled with french onion soup and smothered in cheese.  The hard thing about eating these kinds of dumplings is making sure your plate isn't full of soup when you bite into one, so I guess you should just pop them in whole.  I thought it was pretty good, but I remember the price being like $10.00 or so for like 8 really tiny dumplings.I got a strawberry frozen daquiri.  Definitely really sweet mix they use here.  But it works on a nice hot spring day.I got the grilled chicken panini as my main entree.  Boy was I disappointed by this entree... the chicken did not really have much sauce on it and chicken was a tad dry.  I left most of it untouched (I should have complained)... my friend did like her Polynesian Club but unfortunately I don't really eat seafood...Meh? I guess I chose the wrong dish that day.
2012-04-03,4,My wife and I love to eat brunch at the bar. Particularly during football season. All you can eat shrimp and every game, every Sunday. Also love the sliders.
2012-03-12,3,I went to brunch around 1:30 and found the food in the buffet to be cold and not refilled.  Recently I went back to give it another chance because I was going earlier (around 10:30).  Definitely a difference.  Food was plentiful and the service was okay.  Has the tipical buffet fare (eggs, sausage, breads, bagels) but nothing special.
2012-02-28,2,Not sure why this place gets a good rap.  I've heard from a few people that the food is good here... though maybe they were all talking about brunch?Anyway, dinner here, while not a disaster, did not warrant a comeback.Cesar salad was amazingly bland.  skirt steak was ok, ordered rare and came out rare - but was uninspiring.  Lobster risotto was a big disappointment.Service was below average to average.Wine list had some decent bottles in the 30-40 dollar range though, that was a surprise.
2012-02-25,2,An entire experience that is basically summed up by the word "Meh."  I will start with the good and get to the reasons why I will probably not eat here again. The location is fine and they do have free parking within a reasonable walking distance.  The layout of the place is nice, although there is a bit of spillover noise from the bar area.  Given that it was Friday night, there was loud music and a number of people at the bar, although I will say that it was not so bad that it affected out meal/dinnertime conversations.The service was fine, albeit a bit slow.  The waiter forgot my friend's tea and they fumbled a great deal in removing our appetizers.  Which leads me to my next point: They had a really neat French Onion Soup Dumpling appetizer.  Basically, you get six dumplings filled with french onion soup and covered in Asiago cheese.  It was tasty, although a bit hard to eat since the shells were ready to explode from all the liquid and onions.  Unfortunately for my wife and my two friends, they ordered the classic Ceasar salad.  It was extremely plain, and tasted like wet lettuce covered in croutons and Parmesan.  My friend, fellow yelper and Ceasar salad aficionado, was not amused.  The entrees were also a let down.  The lobster risotto lacked flavor and was overall poorly done.  The hangar steak was bland and slightly over cooked.  I ordered the pan fried free range chicken.  The chicken was salty, the mashed potatoes came from a box and needed salt and pepper, and the spinach was fine.My wife got the ravioli of the week, which turned out to be a wild mushroom ravioli in a marinara sauce under mozzarella and basil.  This was delicious.  The marinara was complemented perfectly by the fresh basil and mozzarella.  The dish was surprisingly spicy, however my wife and I love spicy food so that was great.  The dessert was 50/50.  We had the molten chocolate cake, which I thought was very well done.  My friends shared the banana split, which had too many walnuts and mediocre ice cream.  All in all, if I found myself here again, I would try the ravioli of the week, and have that delicious molten chocolate cake.  I would definitely avoid the Ceasar .
2012-02-20,4,Terrific New Years Day brunch with live jazz.  First time there and oddly enough had trouble finding the door (what appeared to be the front door was blocked off.)  Brunch was wonderful as was the atmosphere and Hoboken location.  Wish I lived closer to enjoy more frequently.
2012-02-18,1,Was there for NYE with a group of friends. Hated it. Couldn't wear my own hat - Staff kept bothering me with that: "I know it's a stupid rule but that's what management wants".Sparkly paper hats spelling 2012 were okay though.The place was packed, by the end of it I was soaked in cheap sparkling wine.The food was appalling.People were having fun though so if you feel that spending 5 hours standing up, being sticky, pushed around and not being able to talk to your friends, go for it. And yes $100 is overpriced, even with their shitty open bar included.
2012-02-05,4,Honestly, this place gets the first 3 stars just for validating parking!! Anyone that's been to Hoboken knows that finding parking in this small town is just as hard as finding parking in NYC!  As far as the restaurant itself,  it was just right for the kind of night my friend and I were looking for.  We had the calamari (which was DE-lish), each ordered a salad (perfect serving size), and a bottle of wine (drank it to the last drop).  I see myself paying this place another visit...and it won't just be for the parking validation.
2012-02-02,3,Went for restaurant week out of curiosity of having been there only once for happy hour, and was good enough to return. Nothing spectacular but everything was satisfying. Waitress' head was in the clouds though. The menu is eclectic, with a bunch of different choices for your meat eaters, vegetarians, and the like. Go for happy hour and apps instead. Really good daily drinks specials, though. Tuesdays are half priced Martini's! Woo!
2012-01-09,4,My roommate got a Groupon for this place about a year ago and it was close to expiring so we decided to do a pre-holidays dinner together.I live a few blocks from here so I really only saw the bar-area, filled with gentlmen and businesmen in suits or jacks and no tie, very much a post-work place. My roommate and I decided to sit in the dining room to check out a new part of the restaurant.It was fairly empty at 6:30 on a Tuesday but filled up as it got closer to 7-7:30.We had a very lovely waitress, she was very friendly and attentive. They first start you out with a bread basket and for two very hungry girls we dove in... very yummy!We each had one of their MASSIVE entrees. Mine was a crusted chicken stuffed with: goat cheese, pancetta, and spinach (aka heaven). It came with some delicious mashed potatoes and a demi glaze that would make you weep! I came back here on a date and had an equally awesome time. I ordered the Turkey burger (which came on an English muffin) and came with a side salad.  We sat in the bar area and it was very crowded by 6:30 PM and a bit noisy so if you want something quiet go to the dining room instead. I want to come back and try their pre-fixe menu which looked amazing! Great drink prices and variety too.
2012-01-04,4,i love this place! it's uptown hoboken so you know you are in the company of a good, "adult" crowd (on party nights you have to be 23 for girls or 25 for boys, i think?). i came here for dinner last night and absolutely loved it. good beer on tap, great customer service, pleasant company - overall a pretty solid tuesday night! i ended up getting the artichoke ravioli in spicy vodka sauce special and i am so happy i did. my +1 got steak and he said it was perfection. this place is also great for sunday brunch (buffet style!) and large groups (dining room in the back). i can't wait to go back - especially since i skipped out on the dessert menu this time around ;)
2011-12-27,5,They have an updated menu. It has  good food and a fun Atmosphere. We went there recently and had a great meal. They have a app, entree and dessert meal for $18 a good package. There have a good assortment of wine and a great dating location. Nice romantic atmosphere.The cookie dough gelato was awesome!The bar was clean and open good for mingling. The dining room had a warm inviting atmosphere.
2011-12-12,4,After several somewhat anti-tantalizing seamlessweb delivery orders from Madison, I had almost given up on the place.  That was, until I went in and sat down for a meal.  They brought the food to my face, I put it in my mouth, and I was substantially more impressed.Madison's two sides are both equally excellent.  The dining side offers a brighter, quieter dinner food experience with talking, laughing, date eyeball gazing...while the bar side has enough TVs so that you need not shift your date gazing eyes more than a few feet either way before you hit another screen.  Thus - there is no bad seat to watch (insert sport here depending on the season.)Food:  Truffle Fries in a Cone - Regardless of how they are served (cone, box, trough) they are truffle fries and they are very good.  Tip: dip a little white, a little red, and bite for maximum truffleish garlicyketchupness.Steamed Mussels - So good.  Use some bread to soak up the white wine sauce.  If you dislike garlic and/or onions, do not consume this.Melon Heirloom Salad - Hands down, my favorite.  When I get this I usually get a piece of ahi on top and call it a day.  Something about watermelon in a salad....so good.Fusilli Bolognese - Biggest pieces of pasta you'll ever have.  Meat is super tender and the dish as a whole isn't as heavy as it leads on.Roasted Free-Range Chicken- I'm big on the greens, so I recommend you sub double Kale for the mashed potatoes, which are just okay.  Roasted chicken is tasty and very juicy.Other Favorites: Polynesian Club, Bar Pie, Quesadilla of the Day (aim for a shrimp or chicken day.)I highly recommend going on a Monday, where a three-course (smaller number of choices) dinner is only $18.12 per person.  I managed to get the mussels, the free-range chicken, and lemon sorbet and my girlfriend got a caesar salad, the bolognese, and raspberry sorbet that rounded our a nicely portioned $40 dollar dinner for two that could have easily set us back $65.Pow, eat here.
2011-12-12,2,I was excited when I saw the LivingSocial deal for a Hoboken restaurant so I bought two coupons. The first time, we order the hanger steak and the jambalaya. We thought the food was okay... More like a 3-star restaurant. However, the food is way over-priced which we didn't think was a big deal since this is Hoboken and the service was not bad. Today, my birthday marked the 2nd and the very last day that my husband and I will ever eat at Madison. Right off the bat, the waitress told us that we cannot order from the prix fixe menu because we have a LivingSocial coupon. Okay... My father-in-law ordered the ravioli $18, I ordered the steak frites $32, and my husband ordered the salmon $23.  We ordered wine and apps (crab cakes $12 and mussels $10 which were both good) with our dinners. SERVICE:After taking our order, the waitress did not check on us until we were half way through our entrees. Well, except for when I had to flag her down to get another seafood fork and more bread. When she did finally come back to check on us she  only asked my father-in-law if he wanted more wine. She didn't ask if our dinner was okay so far and/or if we needed anything else. Second time she stopped, same thing. She asked my husband if he wanted another glass of wine. And of course, the last two times was to give us our bill and run the credit card.FOOD:The appetizers were good. The mussels were especially delicious.  But sad to say, the apps were the best part of the meal. Crab cakes were good.Ravioli: when it arrived, I thought we were in a Mexican restaurant because the cheese raviolis were completely covered in the green sauce (artichoke puree) with shredded cheese on top. You can imagine what that looks like! After FIVE (5) bites my father-in-law politely said "Meh, it was okay". Believe me, he's a simple man and not a food credit so for him to say that, it must have been a pretty GROSS dish.Steak Frites: My meal, the most expensive thing on the menu (I think), arrived with JUST a monster of a steak plopped on a plate. The truffle fries came separately. That's it! Would it have killed them to put a smidgen of parsley on the steak? Really? I didn't know that I was in a dinner. Obvs, if you're charging fine dining prices, I'd expect a restaurant to present it with something. Nope. Though, I would have to admit, the steak was good. However, the "truffle fries" were pathetic. They were overcooked and dry.Salmon: My husband's dish was overall "alright". The fish was done properly but the risotto was gross! I tasted it. Trader Joes' frozen risottos are way better!Okay, I'm sick of writing about this place. I'm over it. In summary, the restaurant overcharges for mediocre food. The service today was terrible. We will NOT be going back here and would not recommend this to anyone.Good luck.
2011-12-06,5,Got he Ahi Tuna. Was told the size of the steak, how fresh and when it was cut up. It came out EXACTLY like I asked which is rare. I had some odd sounding 9% Ale with it and it was all perfect. Absolutely perfect. Music was on, but not too loud. This was a Saturday night to boot. Add in the validated parking (worth $10), and it's hard to beat Madison. Wish I was staying longer. Be sure I will return!
2011-11-23,4,Impressed.  The food here killer...not cheap, but killer.  The following appetizers were sampled:- Tuna tartar - Beef sliders- French onion soup dumplingsAll three kicked serious butt.I was stuffed so I just ordered half a dozen oysters for my "main course." They were okay...not fantastic. Two others I was with ordered and shared the seared ahi tuna and t-bone steak, both of which they raved about.  The wine by the class list is impressive, with a very nice Cote de Rhone for just $10.  We had a 7pm reservation and walked out after 10:30. The waitstaff was clearly super attentive by keeping our glasses full, and super patient for letting us sit there for close to 4 hours.  Not only is a great spot to grab a drink, Madison's EASILY makes the top ten Hoboken restaurants list.  Good stuff.
2011-11-15,5,Madison has quickly become one of my favorite spots in town.  It's the perfect meeting spot for after work drinks and apps.  Great mix of ages (25-45), young families, professionals.  The food works very well with the casual dining bar scene.  They also have a separated area for the "romantic" types. :)
2011-10-03,2,I love the place for drinks and hanging out. I was there last Friday night and it has been a well known establishment for a few years now.  However, I was extremely disappointed with the Prixe Fix Menu. We went to the restaurant with our friends and my wife and I ordered from the Prixe Fix Menu. My wife ordered the Crab Cake appetizer and I ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer. I couldn't believe it when the appetizers came out. My wife's Crab Cake was the size of a scallop. A freakin scallop!!! I never saw a Crab Cake that small in my life. Even if I went to my local grocer to get frozen Crab Cakes, they would not have been this small. Total disgrace that the kitchen would even serve that.My appetizer was not much better. I have 6 Calamari Rings and Two tentacles. It was even worth pushing out of the kitchen. What a joke.My wife's main entree then came. She got the Shrimp Ravioli. It was 3 ravioli. I was so angry. I did not understand. Did they think we were midgets or models and had an eating disorder? I grew up in the restaurant industry. I would be embarrassed if our kitchen pushed this out to the patrons.They should be ashamed of themselves.
2011-09-27,4,My boyfriend and I came here because of a livingsocial voucher. We ordered Mac & Cheese, Buffalo Wings, Hanger Steak with Fries and Shrimp Angel Hair. Food was decent in terms of Hoboken standard but the Hanger Steak was great. Service was great also. Water was refilled constantly. Will definately be back.
2011-08-25,1,Went to Madison's last friday as my GF(Hi Annie) bought the living social deal. Decent meal. I ordered the hanger steak. Decent sized skirt steak with chopped plantains and basmati rice. The steak had  a different taste to it- would not have surprised me if was grass fed. My GF got a salad, with Tuna in it. It cost 19 dollars. Ordered a mango mojito. Lots of syrup with some mint.Here's the problem I have with the place. We got the living social deal, 50 dollars worth of food for 25 dollars, then proceeded to spend 11 dollars over the 50 on drinks and such.  61 dollars total. Although there is a sign up that says any dinner over 60 dollars will be comp'd parking, they refused to comp the parking because we bought the deal at living social. Instead, they offered to "sell" us a parking pass for a dollar off the garage price. When we bought the living social deal, we did so because they was a parking lot nearby and we heard they comp'd parking-important in congested hoboken. So, dining here cost us an additional 6 dollars.My problem isn't the money. This place, is NOTHING special. Its virtually the same menu of a dozen other faux trendy Hoboken places (Teak, Trinity, 10th and Willow, etc). Its even in a crappy part of town, far away from the path. There is NOTHING unique about the place.  Offering us parking, like the sign said, while yes, would have cost them a couple of dollars , would have left us feeling good about the place. Instead, it felt like we got nickel and dimed. Why would I come back here again? To have food I can have everywhere else while giving money to an establishment that clearly doesn't give a f*ck? This is why these restaurants fail. There are far better choices in Hoboken.
2011-08-24,5,Their prix fix menu is amazing and one of the best deals in town.
2011-08-24,4,And now, a lil something for the old school (RIP Nick Ashford - please don't haunt me from the grave): And for eating great, each large plate Good food, you gave And soon both of us, learned to trust Not much to pay, won't be broke till payday We eat it up and eat it up and eat it up... Madison's SOLID SOLID AS A ROCK That's what this place is I eat here a lot, lot, lot, lot, lot, lot... Between the $18.12 three-course pre-fixe dinners with lots of great choices (read: hangar steak and the pork chop) AND $15 wine list, we've been eating here during the week way too much. The bar is our preferred seating since it's a bit more Sly & the Family Stone, and less John Phillip Souza marches like the white table clothed dining room. I've heard at night this place can turn into a 'meat market', since it's only bar with a dance floor in the Uptown Hoboken area, but luckily I've been spared. Bonus star for:-The lemon ricotta + pizza bread you receive upon arrival-Fresh and well shucked blue point oysters-The decent (albeit heavily American and Belgian) beer selection. SOLID.
2011-07-26,4,I went to Madison for dinner on a Monday night with a few people.   We sat at a table in the bar area.  Overall, the experience was definitely a positive one.  It was during restaurant week, so the prices were more than fair.  Additionally, they have a three-course prix fixe menu available on Monday nights that offers plenty of options at an unbeatable price (less than $20).  Service was good (but not spectacular), and all of us were very happy with our meals.  I don't have any complaints, but didn't give 5 stars because there really wasn't anything that really sets Madison apart from the crowd.  Good food for sure!  I definitely recommend giving this place a try.
2011-07-24,2,Normally, I love Madisons. Especially on a Tuesday for half price martinis. They are delicious. But on a recent visit with a group of girlfriends the bartender spilled a drink all over the bar and broke my friends phone. After my friend contacted the owner/manager - he was a complete ass and had no intention of helping her until finally conceeding. Madisons is still a great place for food and drink, but I question the integrity and overall kindness of the people that run the business.
2011-07-23,3,We came here to use the LivingSocial deal that was recently offered. We got here at about 8:45 on a Saturday, and the only open table was the only high top table in the bar area. Honestly, it was so hot out we would have sat anywhere indoors. I liked the ricotta/lemon zest blend that they brought out with the bread. I ordered the chicken raphael and the boyfriend got the jambalaya.  The chicken was average, nothing special about it. It definitely sounded better on the menu than it actually was. The mashed potatoes were bland. My boyfriend's dish was average as well. The service was okay. Also, the bar crowd started to filter in just as we were leaving, around 9:30. Definitely just an average experience overall, although I would like to come back and try their much-hyped brunch.
2011-07-17,4,Definitely seems like a place to go if you are living in Hoboken and are in your thirties to early forties. I say that mainly because that's all the bar area was filled with when I walked in the door. I think I was the youngest guy there who could legally drink. Not like that was a problem though because within ten minutes of being there I was being offered shots from soccer moms and corporate executives. And let me tell you, these people can put them down. I mainly stopped in at the Madison to test the place out during happy hour. Aside from the crowd, the bar was very nice and had a wide variety of drinks being offered. Happy hour runs from 4pm to 8pm, which beer and mixed drinks are half off. I had four Bud heavies there and I think my total came to $12. I thought they got the bill wrong at first since I had just paid that amount for one drink in Manhattan a week ago. The bar staff was pretty cool and always made sure your cup was full. Most of the people there seemed to know the staff by first name so I am guessing if you return repeatedly they treat you well. I did not try anything off the menu, but from what I hear the place has really good food. That and when I always walk past the place the outdoor seating is usually full. Overall I gave this a four star rating because of the cool staff, the nice atmosphere, the variety of drinks offered, and the good deal during happy hour. I will definitely be heading back here for happy hour again and possibly a burger next time.
2011-07-04,5,been living in Hoboken for 7 years, and going to The Madison for that long. back in my single/partying days it was (and still may be) a hot spot for the yuppie crowd on Tuesday, Thurdsday, Friday, and Saturday nights (yes, I practically lived there). Now, my boyfriend and I (incidentally, we MET at the madison!!! kinda sorta) order in from there about 2-3 times a week.  The food is good, and the menu has additions and specials regularly that are quite good.  We are big fans of the french onion soup dumplings, the shrimp tacos, the hanger steak, and the turkey burgers (and much more!)We also go to brunch there, and they have a big buffet on Sundays.  Recently we had a weird moment where the hostess asked my boyfriend to take his hat off stating it was "policy in the dining room" (yes, at brunch.  But hey, their rules, thats fine, we can play by them).  My boyfriend took his hat off, but we noticed 2 other men sitting there as well with their hats on.  We pointed that out to the hostess, but she didn't ask them to remove them after the fact.  No biggie- just a weird aside, and doesn't overall effect how I think of the place or the food.  So just don't wear a baseball hat to a casual sunday brunch ;)
2011-06-24,4,A friend who lives in Hoboken took us here, and I enjoyed it.  The soup dumplings intrigued me, and they tasted very good.  Unfortunately, the presentation made it difficult to actually eat them.  A small bowl with broth and dumplings would have been better.
2011-06-18,4,The Madison is back! After two so-so experiences, my wife and I decided to give it another shot. It was great, from apps to dessert with good service. The Madison is once again one of the top 3 restaurants in Hoboken, and should definitely be a part of your rotation. The bar is one of the most comfortable in town.
2011-06-04,3,nice place. go there usually once a week, but service is not always the greatest. had a terrible accident with the waitress, who dropped two cups of coffee on my white dress. they did take care of me after that and i'd really appreciated, but had to spend the rest of my lunch with a very stained dress. the wait staff seems to be running all the time, they don't have much of connection or attention with the clients. apart from one night that we had this amazing waiter, the other nights service is pretty cold. besides that, the food is delicious !!! to the salmon with greens, the roasted chicken with polenta ( my favorite ) and the strawberry fields salad food is always really good. the endless happy hour on thursday is great, u get to have very cheap drinks. it is a nice place to sit down to eat, usually they find u a table pretty quickly , just wish that the wait staff was a bit better with service.
2011-05-24,5,holy cow! what a gem! tuesday tini (martini)night is absolutely amazing. great crowds, great atmosphere and great service, even the freakin security staff was overly helpful.its a tuesday spot i have been to ever since i discovered it! EXTREMELY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2011-05-22,5,The first time I went there I knew it was home.  Been there many, many times since, and since I live two blocks away rarely do I see the need anymore to put in the effort to go more than two blocks when I want food/drink.  Why this is a great place:1) Bartenders are friendly, down-to-earth, talk to you (when they can), remember your name, and treat you like a valued customer (you hear that City Bistro?).2) Food is very good (their ribeye w/creamed spinach is outstanding, as are their chicken dishes, oysters, and bar pizza and the complimentary bread with dinner is unique and tasty) and reasonably priced.  The "first seating" course menu until 7PM is downright cheap for what you get, and you have plenty of options to choose from.3) An extensive, creative, and tasty signature martini menu.  I'll drink four in a night, each one different.  Great wine list.  Have one of my favorite wines by the glass.4) Coat check in the winter.5) Good vibe - when the DJ starts on Fridays & Saturdays it's not too loud while people are still eating and they play good tunes.6) Good crowd - it's a mid-20's to early 40's crowd.  Great place if you're in your 30's like me.  Fun but not obnoxious.7) Good happy hour - goes until 8pm (but the specials are limited).8) Good bar size/stools to customer ratio (i.e. bar is not small for the size of the place).9) Outdoor seating in warm weather.10) It's a nice place without being pretentious.(11 - Great place for ladies to meet a tall, athletic, attractive, fun, single mid-30's male.  If you see one siting at the bar, stop and say hi.)
2011-05-13,3,Came here twice I believe. As far as I can recollect once for an early dinner with a friend and then again for happy hour followed by dinner with another couple.  I guess if the food was more memorable, I would have taken note.  Stick to the bar.  Bartenders are friendly.  Happy hour is a pretty good deal.
2011-05-08,3,Pretty easy to get a table and while there is nothing "Wow" about it, the food and service are fairly consistent.
2011-05-02,4,The Madison successfully operates as both a bar and a great restaurant.A popular happy hour place with good drink specials.Happy Hour:Mon-Fri: 4-8pm: 1/2 Price House Wine, Bottled and Draft Beer,and Well DrinksFeature Nights/Drink Specials:Tues: Famous Tues Nights with 1/2 price MartinisThurs: Endless Happy Hour 4pm-close (House Wine, Bottled and Draft Beer, Well Drinks, Sauza Margaritas, Sangria).What I really like here is the early bird special which runs all night on Monday and from 5-7pm Tuesday thru Friday. At just $16.13 a person you have a contender for the best priced first seating / prefix menu in Hoboken. Wines from the first seating menu are all $15.The portions have been called perfect by other diners. At first site of the appetizer I thought it was on the small side, but I must say that the 3 courses really do add up. I've enjoyed the crab cake alot, crispy and good not alot of breading. Will probably remember to ask for the sauce on the side next time since it started to make the bottom of the crab cake soggy. Otherwise it was top notch. Also liked the six choices for the entrees. Ended up falling in love with the creamy polenta and the tender free-range chicken. As close to what Mama Tattoli used to make me growing up.The two mini cannoli's come with a great chocolate dipping sauce for dessert.I really try to come here anytime I get out of work early enough for the first seating. Super easy to get to if your coming in from the city via Bus. Always great for happy hour!
2011-04-11,3,Fun bar. Decent food. Much like all the places on Washington in Hoboken...
