2021-11-03,3,Went for brunch with two friends and I was not impressed with this cafe. The food was mediocre, the staff was not pleasant. Felt rushed & we were not impressed.
2021-11-02,5,Loved this place for a late lunch! We sat right inside near the bar and loved looking at the old ceiling and bar features since the place is from the 1800s. We had the BEST French onion soup and chicken sandwich. The Caesar salad was also delish and huge so I couldn't even finish it. Staff was friendly and attentive but not too attentive. They also have an extensive and lovely outdoor seating area with heaters. Will be back for more meals!!
2021-10-05,3,Interesting bar and cocktail menu. Order the bahn mi sandwich which was sweet and delicious. Had a Bloody Mary (or two) but they were on the weaker side. Tried the short rib Mac and cheese and it lacked an overall cheesey flavor. Arrived at 3PM on a Sunday so to my disappointment, they were no longer serving brunch. Would return to try the brunch menu.
2021-10-02,5,Came for brunch around noon and waited about 5 minutes to be seated outside. Great and quick service. Food was fresh and a solid amount of both breakfast and lunch options. Would highly recommend!
2021-09-25,1,The tiniest NY strip you'll ever see. This was insulting to get in a delivery. Won't be eating here again.
2021-09-24,5,We got lucky with the weather and met old friends for a reunion after many years of being out of touch. The setting couldn't have been more perfect, the food could not have been better enjoyed or served.I loved the smoked salmon club, and I heard that the fish and chips were yummy. Soup of the day was delicious and not overly salty. String fries were served crisp and hot.Beer on tap was delivered cold and frothy (I had Stella). Our server, Adriana, was delightful - a skilled and competent server, and a great photographer as well!
2021-09-15,1,Always wanted to try this place. Walked in for some good eats/convos with my mom and brother. It felt like I was an outsider that unexpectedly walked into someone's home while THEY were having dinner. There was one table of guests seated. The server was speaking with them and laughing (very comfortably as if they were close friends or regulars). We walked in, they stopped talking, paused to look at us awkwardly, and then began talking again as if we weren't standing there. We were only greeted by their silence and stares being that we were interrupting their dinner at home. After standing there with no real acknowledgment and feeling weird we decided to eat at the spot across the street.
2021-09-14,1,Worst place ever. Service beyond bad. We got the grilled octopus as an appetizer (which was super dry and hard even to cut), then my boyfriend got the steak (again, super dry and hard to chew) and I got the pan seared scallops (very flavorful but overcooked). Oh and the mains came right after the appetizer, we were still working on it and had the main plates at the table simultaneously. And when I asked for dessert the waiter said the kitchen was already closed. Excuse me? So you close your kitchen without asking customers if they want something else? Maybe if you've checked on your tables how you were supposed to do, nothing of this would've happened! Clearly the staff wanted to go home and couldn't wait to get rid of us!! Long story short, horrible experience! I wouldn't recommend this place not even to my worst enemy!
2021-09-13,5,Incredible lobster roll! Drinks are always good. And their outside seating is so cute!
2021-09-11,1,I can't believe how bad this place was.  They were out of water. Are you kidding me?  Send someone out to buy water if you don't have any. They only had sparkling water and would not serve tap since they were out of water.  Food was nothing to write home about. We were left abandoned since no one came to check on us.  Food took forever. We had to go up to hostess to pay our bill because we got tired of waiting for it.  Never again.
2021-09-04,3,Been here twice, and the waiters were rude unpleasant both times. Big disappointment if the service is bad.Decent ambiance indoors. Outdoor seating is nice.Dinner is good, had the salmon.Brunch menu was also decent. Delicious fries. Coffee was not great. Coke was flat.May come back again if someone drags me, otherwise I prefer being treated well when I'm paying to be served.
2021-09-02,1,Low quality but expensive food. If you just go for drinks and atmosphere it might be ok.
2021-08-29,5,stopped in yesterday at 5:00 and was welcomed by patrons who immediately moved over a seat at the bar so we could sit at the bar too!  Always nice way to start out when you come across kind people.  The vibe was perfect for us, friendly people having cocktails and food at the bar.  The bartender Alex was very helpful making suggestions off the menu and offered a taste of his favorite Rose so I could decide what I wanted.  His pick was spot on and so was his food suggestions.  I had the avocado and artichoke salad which is baby arugula, creamy warm and lemon dressing with avocados and artichokes.  Alex suggested adding grilled salmon on top.  Just delicious together.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and made my salad a meal.  Rich had fish and chips with malt vinegar and thin frittes!  He said it was really good.  To top it all off we had the warm double chocolate sundae which is chocolate bread pudding, vanilla gelato and home made whipped cream...WOW... in a word.  The chocolate bread pudding had the consistency of a brownie but not the sugar overload.  Just decadent and delicious.  We both enjoyed the meal, the people and the service was just fabulous, thanks Alex.  We will be back
2021-08-26,4,Had a nice little lunch here - chicken Caesar salad was fresh and very large, and love that they offer the half sandwich with a soup or salad. Wish more places offered that! The French onion soup was great, and had half of the prime rib sandwich which was tasty and well marinated, but should have been served on a separate plate without the cup of soup also sitting on the plate bc the soup spilled and made the bottom half of the roll soggy to the point it fell apart. They kept a full bottle of water on the table at all times which I always appreciate. Service was a little slow, but we weren't in a rush so that was fine.
2021-08-14,3,Have been here before and had a great experience but last weekends experience was terrible. Was sat across from the garbage cans outside- even the waitress said "I know it smells terrible over here" and apologized. The manager comes outside and knocks something over by the waiter and the manager proceeds to keep walking although he acknowledged he knocked something over and didn't pick it up. The waitor was clearly annoyed. It was so bizarre, no apology or anything to his staff. The blonde host had zero awareness, there's open tables on the opposing side and he proceeds to say there's no openings to come back in ten minutes. We come back, saw the same exact open tables and got seated. Those open tables never filled up while we were there.. Just making a point that it was unnecessary to sit us by garbage if there's better open tables on the opposing side.Took forever for a waitor, but he was really kind. They're French onion soup is good. They're drinks are terrible- they def don't specialize in any specialty drinks because the pour was overkill and bottom shelf for sure.
2021-08-03,5,Took my dad for a birthday brunch on a Saturday AM. Awesome service and delicious food!
2021-07-31,2,I love Elysian. It's my favorite local neighborhood spot. I ALWAYS find myself craving their chicken sandwich. I loved nothing more than to show up there after a crazy work day and have a drink and quick dinner with my best friend, boyfriend, or brother. However lately, it seems that you HAVE to make a reservation online to go there. 2 stars because I can't even eat there anymore. We've been patrons for years and have been turned away on multiple occasions because they apparently book up the entire restaurant with online reservations. They don't even give us an hour, 2-hour wait time (which I'm More than happy to do). They simply tell us we won't be able to be served unless someone cancels their reservation. The young hostess has this incredibly standoffish and elitist attitude when really, our family has been going there long before she was born.  It's really sad that we can't just walk up to our neighborhood restaurant on a Thursday and grab a quick dinner. I wish they would only fill 50-75% of the place with reservations so their dedicated and loyal patrons can still just walk up and enjoy one of their last favorite places in town. Management: please address this issue and I thank you for taking this into consideration.
2021-07-27,4,Nice environment-Victorian style housing and  good service. Will come back again. Make sure to drop by in week day maybe a clever choice.
2021-07-17,3,We stopped for Saturday brunch today. The weather was warm. But we sat outside anyway. My wife had the grilled chicken sandwich. No complaints. Topped with all the fixings. The side Spring salad though was warm, not cold. I wanted something cool to eat. So I opted for the Caesar salad with grilled chicken. Again, the romaine lettuce was warm and the grilled chicken was pounded thin and a tad dry. The dressing and croutons were both tasty. Too bad the greens weren't cold. Could have earned a 4th star......
2021-07-10,2,Came to this place after passing it by so many times. Given the weekend, expected to be seated outside , as if we wanted to be seated inside/ there was a waitlist. there was little rain and we were told if it rains hard, we would have to pack our food / drinks to go as we wouldn't be able to get a table inside because as there is no table available, which was reasonable. Ofcourse it rains and I see everyone who had a table outside was able to get a table inside as well as people who were just walking in. I found this to be very odd and shady. I gave it 2 stars because my server was nice and attentive, drinks were okay, they have 8 different menus when you scan there QR code-- but I was barely able to order anything as I'm a vegetarian so I ordered the truffle fries, which did not disappoint. This was my first and probably the last time I visit here.
2021-07-06,4,Stumbled upon this place looking for a Monday brunch spot and this spot slapped. Their quick service and food were great. No wait time. We tried the Smoked Salmon Sandwich, the Short Rib Sandwich, and the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. All winners. Service was quick. Great scenery. The server could have been friendlier. Prices seemed a tad bit high for what you get. Would definitely try again.
2021-06-28,1,It was not a good brunch experience. The serving person didn't understand a thing about what we wanted for food. He was lost and confused. He didn't even know what "well done" eggs mean. Worst avocado toast ever, they put v thin slices of avocado on my burned toast. Didn't get all the drinks on time and then charged us for not ordering on "brunch time".Wouldn't recommend going here at all.
2021-06-26,5,Absolutely delicious!  They had plenty of outdoor seating and service was lovely. While both aspects were enjoyable, the meal itself was the star. The scallops and pasta were both divine and we will definitely be back!
2021-05-31,4,Delicious Brunch!  The eggs Benedict  was great!  Very pleasant waitress.  Loved the outside dining area.  Will definitely return.
2021-05-08,5,Don't understand why the reviews aren't higher for this restaurant.  One of the best restaurants in the neighborhood.  Wide variety on the menu.  Portions are good. Taste is on point.
2021-05-02,2,Ordered delivery from here, so this review is for food only. I ordered the croque madame because this is listed as a French restaurant and they even call fries "pommes frites" on the menu. A croque madame is a very simple and well known dish with 5 parts: bread, ham, Swiss cheese, a runny egg, and bechamel sauce. What I got was a ham, egg, and cheese sandwich. The eggs were fried but completely cooked through, so there was no runny yolk and the bechamel was completely absent. This all might have been forgivable if the sandwich was good, but it wasn't, it was bland and gloopy. I hate leaving negative reviews but this is honestly just lazy and kind of deceitful. If you had just listed it as a ham, egg, and Swiss cheese sandwich, I wouldn't mind because I wouldn't have ordered it, but don't say it's a specific and well known dish and deliver something completely different.
2021-04-27,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. Can't beat the pastrami sandwich with fries or salad. Definitely enough for me so that'll mean leftovers for most people.
2021-04-21,3,Super friendly and attentive staff, perfect martini, lovely interior design. Fish tacos.... no flavor, heavy fried fish with some tasteless toppings. All this needed was a little effort, pico de Gallo or fish sauce would have helped this a lot.  Fries were delicious, hot and crispy.
2021-04-18,3,Restaurant is nice and the set up outside is cute.  The food and drinks were good.  The only thing I have a complaint on is the service.  We were a group of 4 and we did not have a reservation so we could not sit inside because hostess said it was booked.  It was chilly outside, but we were told we could not be seated by a warming station either.  No reason as to why.  Our waiter checked once at the beginning of our meal to see if we needed drinks, never again after that.  As we were leaving the waiter did not speak to us, not even to say have a good night. I found that so weird, as I've never experienced this at any restaurant.
2021-04-11,5,Finally stopped here for some food and drinks. So happy I did. Our server was great, the food was fresh and delicious. The oysters were really good, I definitely recommend them as well as the mussels. The creme brûlée was so delicious too!! All of our dishes were good honestly, nothing was disappointing.  Will definitely be back here!
2021-03-28,4,Went here for outdoor dining a few weeks ago. The poutine fries as an appetizer were fantastic and we also each got pasta dishes for our dinner. The food itself was great, but we ate around 8:30pm so it got pretty cold and windy as we were eating. Unfortunately we weren't at a table near the heat lamps so we ate half of our entree before heading home to keep warm. I would definitely go back for the food/atmosphere but recommend going when the weather is nicer.
2021-03-23,5,The food was absolutely amazing. One of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. The staff was exceptional and COVID best practices were in place. If you are not staying in NJ, it is definitely worth a trip out of Manhattan!
2021-03-21,1,!!! fraud !!Elysian cafe offers a glass of wine for $9 and then charges $10.the manager behaves hostile and does not apologize, only informing that they will correct the bill
2021-02-15,4,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken, the staff is always friendly and attentive. We didn't have a reservation but were sat down within minutes of arrival. I highly suggest getting their French onion soup, especially in the cold weather! I typically do not like a cold lobster roll but Elysian Cafe made it very well. Will definitely be back in the upcoming weeks!
2021-02-04,1,I ordered a cheeseburger 1:45 minutes ago so I called to see what is up. when I asked why my order is late, the manager said "well, I don't know" in an uncaring manner. I will never order food from this place again they do not care about the customers.
2021-01-23,4,Went for a lunch on a Friday afternoon to Elysian Cafe. We got the mussels in a white wine sauce to share. My friend got the fish tacos and I got the French onion soup. I would recommend the soup! The mussels weren't bad either. Nice lunch / brunch spot.
2021-01-15,4,I decided to go here because I've been meaning to try it since moving to the area. The history alone is a reason to check it out. The outdoor seating it one of the better setups I have seen and they are able to accommodate larger groups. They are clearly understaffed so don't go there if you're looking to get attentive service. I didn't mind the service because I was still greeted, we never had to ask for more water and our food came out quickly. I will definitely return!
2021-01-11,5,First off I'd like to state that the staff is following every precaution out there to provide an experience that feels like covid doesn't even exist & I really commend them for that. The cocktails are awesome, the food is beyond & the atmosphere is warm and welcome-especially transformative if you look around and soak in the architecture of the place. I ordered the gnocchi & its incredible, I Have been a huge fan of their French onion soup FOREVER (seriously I tell everyone) and this time I got the chicken and lobster roll to go so that I can enjoy it with my boyfriend once I finish my work break. I work in the same industry in the same city so I really applaud those who are doing everything right to provide a fantastic experience. While I sat here and wrote this, the table across from me also raved about every single thing they had tonight. Espresso martinis, dirty martinis, charcuterie & more. 6 stars in my eyes. Thanks for the good times, every time.
2021-01-09,5,What can I say? Perfect beginning to a night out or date night. Perfect oyster selection and they were perfectly cleaned which is nice. Didn't need to check each one which makes serving your date easier if that's your style! Try it! I think it's very romantic to serve your date a perfect oyster and to drink them down together.  Am I wrong? The servers know the oysters well so lean on them if you're not sure. That's nice. Definitely come for the oysters!  And the Awesome cocktails. I think we had the best table in the joint; and the architecture begs me to return especially post pandemic when this place should have even more energy.  We didn't have too much food, but the crab cake and hors d'oeuvres were awesome. This place seems to live up to the history it inherits, including the perfectly relevant and approachable Art Deco bar, breathtaking beaux art ceilings (someone please correct my certain architectural gaffs... what style is it?) and cultured but indiscriminate  urban vibe.  It all makes sense and they honor it perfectly with the food and drink. This is definitely a destination on Washington Street.
2020-12-30,5,Definitely one of the best meals of 2020! The poutine was superbly decadent with fois gras and the most wonderful gravy. Star of the show is this french cut chicken...Woah! The French potato dumplings were easily one of the best things I've eaten recently and the chicken was perfectly cooked. GO, GO, GO!
2020-12-27,4,Solid food and cute outdoor seating. When working from home, I'll sometimes order lunch from here. Favs are the chicken club and calamari salad!
2020-12-22,5,I've never been disappointed with a meal here. From the standard French Onion Soup to the nightly chef specials - the thoughtfully curated menu is both original and comforting.  I just wish the specials were available for their delivery options (grubhub, seamless, DoorDash, etc.)
2020-11-17,4,Very quaint and quick service. Went early on a Sunday and was seated right away. Heat lamps outside to keep warm in the cooling weather. Overall good food and good service
2020-11-08,1,We arrived on a Sunday at 11:30 and the hostess took my name and phone and told me it was a 40min wait which we agreed to.After 1 hour without being called I asked again and this time she told me she didn't know how long the wait was given they had reservations in front of us.... so it seemed that they had reservations + a waitlist which they never told us! In front of me there was a lady complaining with the manager after being waiting for 1 hour too.With so many brunch options this is unacceptable! We ended up at Anthony Davis, I doubt we will give this joint an opportunity until they improve their service.
2020-10-30,5,Elysian is a great pseudo-French brassiere in a beautiful space. Their sandwiches are great for lunch, and their dinner entrees are usually wonderful. The inside rooms can get pretty noisy when it is crowded, but the front area (with the bar) feels lush and comfortable. The outside seating is perfect when the weather is nice. One of my favorite places in Hoboken, no question.
2020-10-25,3,Called in Thursday and made a reservation for Sunday ... called again to confirm the  reservation ... get there Sunday to find out there was no such reservation ... I heard so many things about this place , I must say I was extremely disappointed to know they either lost or never made my reservation . We ended up seating at the bar , the bartender was very good and apologetic. Drinks were great and the food ( Brunch ) was also very very good . Would love to go back to try their dinner menu . Hopefully next time they will get our reservation right ,
2020-10-25,4,Love their outside setup (I have been three times since COVID began). The food is always good. Yesterday my server was pretty mediocre and whoever was working the bar during brunch hour was terrible. All of our drink were messy like they had been spilled and my mimosa was essentially a 16oz glass of OJ.
2020-10-25,3,The food was good but the service was terrible. We had a guy who took minimum 10 minutes to come over to our table. After he got over he took our drink order and brought back 4/5 girls drinks. Our food then came out and there was still no drinks. Then when it came time to pay he messed up charging our cards.French toast was delish and the chicken sandwich I added on cheese and it was delish!
2020-10-07,3,Really nice outdoor seating, it's decorated with lights and flowers. Personally I felt the food was alright, like nothing bad but nothing special. I got the halibut which was recommended by the server but it was just okay. The fish felt a bit rubbery. Entrees are limited if you don't want to eat steak by the way. I just plan on coming back here for drinks, an appetizer and enjoying the ambiance.
2020-09-12,1,Sadly, not what it used to be. Since a change in ownership a couple of years ago, this Hoboken bistro has gone downhill fast. Service is painfully slow, management is disorganized and the food is not what it used to be. And don't blame the pandemic. It's descent into mediocrity began long before Covid. It's a shame, too, because it used to such a great place.
2020-09-05,5,French. Onion. Soup.Literally thee best you will have. It's been on the menu since forever and there's a reason for it. People order it on a 100 degree day -it's that good.Besides their fantastic consistent food they have the most gorgeous outdoor space in Hoboken. It feels like a world of its own. Like you're in Paris sitting at little cafe tables under the gorgeous tree. Trés Romantique!They recently added new things to the menu that blew my mind. Let me rave about the miso glazed salmon over fried rice. -It's the best fish I have had in years. If you hate salmon this will change your mind. My friend ordered the same and agreed, It was spectacular. Bravo. Their new grilled octopus was also a huge hit. Go for the French onion soup and stay for the salmon. Dinner at Elysian Cafe is like coming home.
2020-09-03,2,I'm giving them a star because they all have their masks on whenever I've come here.  However, the food hasn't been good at all.  The last thing I got was a Reuben and it was so burnt and overcooked, it was inedible.  I appreciate that they have been good about customer safety and have worn masks during COVID, but the food has got to improve if I'm going to keep coming back.
2020-08-18,1,The food was terrible. We wanted to support a local business but alas I'm not going to go back to this place
2020-08-09,1,Probably the most bland food I've ever eaten... hostess was rude... server spilled a margarita on my friends food, laughed, and goes "there's some more flavor for ya".... then the manager came over and gave him A PLATE OF LETTUCE to eat instead, like what the actual f? It was embarrassing to the maximum extent. At least the margarita was good.
2020-07-30,1,I've been a customer of Elysian Cafe for many years, and it's always been my go to spot to take out of town guests, as it's a feast for the eyes inside.Craving a Ruben sandwich the other night, I recalled that they made a tasty one, and as I placed the order through Seamless, I already began salivating!Unfortunately, what arrived didn't resemble a Ruben whatsoever. The meat was overcooked and fatty, and resembled greasy bacon more than moist corned beef. There was also very little sauerkraut on the sandwich featuring also, ordinary store-bought bread. Had I not ordered the sandwich myself, I never would've believed it came from Elysian Cafe.   I took a photo of the Sorry sandwich and compared it to a stock photo from the Internet. Not even close!  After two bites of the unpalatable mess, I tossed it. With delivery fee and tip, that was a $22 dollar waste of money. I was even disappointed that the normally crisp fries were in one limp, cold pile...
2020-07-29,5,This place surprised and impressed me, and I'm not easy to impress. From the European atmosphere to EVERYTHING we ordered, it was a divine dining experience. We ordered: whiskey smash, Kane Snake Box Pale Ale (wow! Might be my new fav beer!), organic greens salad (delicious dressing!), avocado artichoke salad (wowza), grilled octopus (soooo tender), lobster roll (all kinds of yes), and the mulles frites (broth was excellent). Service was friendly & top notch! Would definitely recommend (I almost forgot there's a pandemic happening) - give it a try!!
2020-07-23,5,Amazing food and very Quaint. The lobster roll was amazing. A must try in Hoboken NJ. People are very friendly and the owner came over and asked about my meal. Excellent experience !!
2020-07-20,3,My boyfriend and I came for outdoor dining on a Friday night. They only take reservations the day of and it looked like every table was occupied when we were there. The first table we were seated at was under a couple air conditioning units which kept dripping on us so they were able to accommodate us when we asked for a difference table. We ordered the mussels & pommes frites in red sauce to start and really enjoyed it. This was my first time having mussels and I'm very much a fan now. It was a pretty sizable portion for the two of us. I thought the mussels were cooked well-not too chewy or fishy. The sauce was also really yummy but on the watery side. The pommes frites (fries) were crispy and perfectly salted but wish it came out warmer. We originally wanted the halibut but they were sold out of it by the time we ordered so we got the salmon to share instead. The brussels, polenta, and salmon were all cooked well but they were lacking flavor. We wanted to ask for some hot sauce but out waiter wasn't really coming around to ask him. On another note, the table is really small (I guess to include more tables and to add to the cafe vibe) but it was hard to juggle all our plates and glasses. We had to move some items to the ground so we wouldn't knock anything over.
2020-07-17,5,Came here for my first outdoor dining experience in Hoboken and so felt safe and enjoyed the food so much! I had the poutine with duck, and my friends had the salmon (sub fries with salad) and the lobster rolls. Everything was so delicious and the service was incredible. Definitely recommend for outdoor dining!
2020-07-13,4,I had dinner at Elysian café this past Saturday night.  We had a reservation for 2 at 8 pm which I made earlier that afternoon.  Bad rain finished passing through about 30 minutes prior to our reservation, but everything was fine when we arrived and we did not have to wait to be seated.  The service was on point - additional water was brought out before we asked; meals came quickly; they gave us bread no charge upon request etc.   We shared the Crab cake appetizer to start.  For $16, I was disappointed by the size of the one crab cake, but the flavors were very tasty - I really enjoyed the corn and pesto with it.   For my main, I got the pan braised halibut dish - it was delicious and a good portion size.  My friend tried the lobster roll which she was said was tasty - it came with a lot of arugula salad on the side.   All in all, we enjoyed our meal and had a nice time dining outside there.
2020-07-12,1,I wish I was able to give feedback on their food, but unfortunately they didn't allow me. We arrived about 2 hours prior to their posted closing time. We ordered some drinks and about 20 minutes later we ordered food. Great service from the waiter. As soon as he took our order it start heavy raining. It is Covid-19 time, therefore no space inside. We stayed below an umbrella until the rain passed. It took no more than 20 minutes. We went to our table again, we saw that our food was ready a few minutes before the rain stopped. The waiter came to us and told us that the restaurant was closing and we must take our food to go. Excuse me? A third class manager came to us to confirm this, giving us a lame excuse about having to close early to clean. Nothing not even close to this has ever happened to me or anyone I know. As a hotel and restaurant this is inexcusable. It was the same as telling us to leave in the middle of our meal. Not only I will never set foot there ever again, but every time someone asks for my recommendation on where to it in Hoboken, I will go out of my way and recommend where not to it. The owner or upper management must be aware of what this day manager decided to do to go home early.
2020-07-10,4,Made a stop by over here for brunch on a warm Sunday afternoon. Plenty of restaurants in the area that have outdoor seating, but this spot took it to another level with the amount of shade provided by the umbrellas. No wait for two people as got seated quickly (masks on).Began with the Bloody Mary ($7) to go alongside my Eggs Florentine ($11). Drink is served in a large glass; topped by several green olives. Overall unbalanced - couldn't taste the booze very much, but definitely a solid kick of hot sauce. Meal comes out within 15 minutes - a large dish consisting of poached eggs and spinach on top of an English muffin, along with intensely sauteed home fries. Great flavor in all the items, especially the home fries that included grilled onions. All the staff here wore their masks and kept a reasonable distance. One of the best options on the street for a solid meal.
2020-07-09,5,We had a great COVID / outdoor dining experience at Elysian on 4th of July weekend. COVID setup: They're taking reservations day-of and it was very easy to make one. Tables are more separated than some other restaurants in Hoboken which was a plus. I appreciated their use of QR Codes to gain access to the menu instead of passing around paper menus used by others.The meal: Great cocktail and wine lists, and the food was amazing. Our group had the halibut (delicious daily special), salmon x2 (with polenta!), and a steak salad. One person in our group was gluten-free, and the waiter triple-checked which substitutions were suitable for her dietary restrictions.I definitely recommend dining at Elysian; our dinner experience was fantastic, and I've had great brunch experiences here too.
2020-07-08,5,Solid takeout. They accidentally forgot fries and immediately came back within 10 minutes to provide.
2020-07-03,4,This was my first restaurant dining experience since NY/NJ's COVID shut down in March 2020. Elysian Cafe did well with the outdoor dining.Tables were separated far enough from other groups to feel comfortable. We got seated in a shady area, which was a great relief from the summer heat. Menus were photocopied onto paper, which appears to be a COVID-related measure.My friend got the steak and eggs, while I got the salmon eggs Benedict. I enjoyed my salmon eggs Benedict, but the Hollandaise sauce was just alright. I really liked my friend's steak and eggs. It was juicy and cooked just right (we asked for medium rare). I had asked for fries, but they gave me potatoes. They realized this even before I did, and they brought me fries on the side. Service was excellent. They brought me water as soon as I sat down, checked in with us often (but not annoying about it), and were overall pleasant. They have brunch cocktails, which not all restaurants in Hoboken do (they're BYOB).I'll be back; I appreciated the restaurant itself, along with their COVID-related accommodations.
2020-07-03,1,I used to come here and the service and food were amazing. I went there yesterday and the manager and waiter were extremely rude. I made a reservation and asked if I could have a shady area because it was 90 outside, humid and the sun was directly on me and my friend. The restaurant had empty tables so we kindly asked if we could move to a shady table that was empty. The manager comes out and gives us an attitude, saying that if we move to that table we might have to move if a bigger party comes. We just did not understand because there were other tables empty, that whole row was empty. He then tells me to bring the silver wear and cups to the new table( I want to think he was saying that to the waiter, but am not sure about it.) the waiter comes out I asked if they have in house made lemonade or iced tea, and he said saids no... is from the supermarket!! I was... ok. So we just had water. My friend order a double chocolate sundae and gets a mint sundae, she does not like mint and kindly tells the waiter that he made a mistake. A woman comes out and saids what is the problem? And she explains the situation... at the end she gets what she wants. My salad was not like the way it used to be  made ... I paid $21.00 for a green salad with three cherry tomatoes and four shrimp!! No taste whats so ever. I hate to leave this message and I understand we are going through hard times, but you should treat loyal customers with respect. Im not sure I will be coming here again.
2020-06-28,5,It was great getting back to the Elysian - after the three-plus month hiatus from dining out, there was no other place I wanted to break my 'fast.' Not surprisingly, management and staff had planned perfectly for the new outdoor dining/distancing requirements, making for an optimal hospitality experience. The service was impeccable, as always; the cocktails and craft beer delectable; and the food was better than ever - the scrumptious burger and fish tacos were complemented by a divine crab cake special. I wish I could eat there every night.
2020-06-27,5,If you are looking for a place with good food, this is the spot. I am a vegetarian and was very satisfied with the grilled cheese sandwich which included pomme frites. It was way better than expected. My friend had the same dish but with salad. The salad that it came with was alot. Dinner for two (from the bar menu) with drinks and coffee came out to less than $50. The nearby table had a dog. I really liked when I saw the busboy bring a bowl of water for the dog. It is very considerate since it was a very hot day. We sat outside and I love its greenery. It does feel like being in the Elysian Fields.
2020-05-06,5,Always enjoy Elysian cafe!! They have a beautiful outdoor space for any meal and a friendly staff.  With Covid affecting so many local businesses I ordered take out tonight.  I forgot my mask so I paid at the door and stood outside to wait, the kind gentlemen came outside and provided me with a mask and my food.  These are the kind of businesses that deserve the support & service.  Especially when they have great food and prices!!!
2020-04-19,5,A little pricy but worth it! Very inviting environment and the food was amazing. Will definitely return
2020-03-17,4,I had been to the Elysian Café several times over the past few years - for dinners, special beer pairing events, drinks, and more.  Overall, I always had a stellar experience, and my previous visit was no different.  My friend and I were seated in the quaint rear dining room that embodied its homestyle and casual atmosphere.  I sipped my sweet, crisp Riondo Prosecco, while she enjoyed a glass of red wine.  My companion ordered her favorite Artichoke and Avocado Salad, as well as some Mussels in White Wine with French Fries.  I sampled one of her thin, lengthy fries and found it reminiscent of McDonald's offering, and I mean that in a good way!  It had a robust potato flavor, was perfectly fried to a light crisp, and possessed just a pinch of salt.  My French-Cut Chicken Breast entreé was even better than I had previously remembered.  The chicken was moist and tender.  It was served over Parisienne-style dumplings, and a mixture of sweet peas and mushrooms.  The small balls of dough had been pan-seared, so they had a slight crunch; they reminded me of baked potato gnocchi.  The sweet peas were a suitable compliment to the earthy, bold mushrooms.  Lastly, there was a red wine demi-glaze over the ingredients that added just a hint of acidity and sweetness.  It really was a simple, yet well-executed and delicious dish.If you have not checked out the Elysian Café, definitely add it to your list!
2020-03-11,5,Do you love good food? How about good cocktails? Atmosphere? Service? Well Elysian is an absolute GEM! Stumbled upon this beautiful corner location while in search for dinner and immediately drawn in by the fairy lights and ample outdoor seating. The inside was very romantic with dark wood and dim lighting. We were pleasantly surprised with MUSSLE MADNESS Wednesday (7.50 a plate) and absolutely insanely well crafted cocktails. The service was above and beyond as well (much love Benny) will totally recommend
2020-02-16,5,Great bar, excellent bartenders! Food is good too. Always packed get there early. One of the oldest bars in town.
2020-02-16,5,I love the Elysian cafe! It is a perfect balance of accessible food and laid-back setting, while still feeling like a nice meal out. You could have something simple from the bar menu like their delicious artichoke and arugula salad, or something more traditionally French like the French onion soup or any of their heartier entrees, and each will be executed flawlessly. Also, one of the best cosmopolitan martinis in the New York area!
2020-02-01,3,I had come to Elysian once with friends for a cocktail that I enjoyed (skinny spicy marg natch) and I like the vibe here. We were also sent here by one of future husband's coworkers who knows the owner. I never quite understood why this place had three stars but then I ate there and, yes! It does have three stars.There's nothing bad about this restaurant. We went for restaurant week though we had the option of ordering off the regular menu, there were selections we liked on the restaurant week menu so we went for it. The food was good... decent. It was nothing to scream about. I had to ask twice for bread, but it was good when it got there, warm & the butter was good. That is always a nice start, but it didn't come until apps were brought out.Future husband liked his mussels and I got the crispy duck app and it was probably better than my meal, which was cod over potatoes. The thing with the restaurant week menus is that they don't give you a very big portion so of course you are hungry for dessert. I ate both mine and future husband's because he gets full when a normal person should get full.Service was aight skinny spicy marg was aight. I'm not complaining, I'm not! It's just that yes, this place is three stars. Will I be back, you ask? Depends how long I live in Hoboken.
2020-01-25,4,Went here for a Saturday breakfast/brunch. The coffee was like typical diner coffee, but the Bloody Mary was delicious.My boyfriend and I both got the Salmon Eggs Benedict and it was so good. Believe it or not I'm not a big eggs Benedict nor a lox person... but I was loving every bite! I got the potatoes and he got the fries. Potatoes were pretty good.. more soggy than crunchy. The French fries were awesome... like healthier McDonald's French fries. The bacon though is AMAZING. It's real, thick cut bacon so definitely worth it. If you order it as a side, they give you a decent amount.I come here maybe once a year, and I've always had a  delicious meal and good experience... and I will be back!
2020-01-20,3,I live locally and walked by this place a few times and finally walked in today for a late lunch around I've 3pm. Since it was a holiday it was pretty crowded. I ordered the French onion soup and steak sandwich. The waiter asked if he should bring the soup out first and I said yes. After 40 minutes later both came out together. The sandwich came out cold so I knew after the soup it wouldn't be any better. I don't usually send food back but since the host asked I told him. The sandwich came back and it was a still cold and looked like they just cooked new steak and out it on the existing onions and bread. Overall service was slow and food wasn't seasoned or served properly.
2020-01-08,4,This was my first visit to Elysian Cafe. It was a Monday at 12:15pm when I took a seat at the bar. I ordered the Elysian Burger with greens. I enjoyed my meal while watching rugby and football recaps with sports news on the televisions and listening to Wilson Pickett's "Mustang Sally." It seemed to be a high quality meal but I just wished I had firmer buns but again, don't we all? It's not 1895 prices but the place is affordable.
2020-01-07,3,I want to love this place bc the exterior is so darn cute but the food is fair at best.  It's not the worst meal i have ever had but it certainly was not the best. Service was mediocre. I won't be running back.
2020-01-05,4,My brunch / lunch go to in Hoboken . Great salads, burgers and sandwiches ( eggs too). Nice bar too and consistent service
2020-01-04,1,Terrible customer service, extremely unprofessional. Ordered the steak and it was overcooked and very dry, I was told by the server "that's how we do it, if you don't like it go to the cafe down the street". So now I will. Snippy hostess too.
2019-12-30,4,Have been visiting Elysian Cafe for brunches and lunches since for a decade. Consistently good steak salad etc. outside seating in the summer months and dependable service.
2019-12-02,4,Delicious Brunch! The Bloody Mary is amazing, slightly spicy and not too thick. I ordered the avocado toast with side salad which was also good. The service is quick and waiters are friendly. The tables are very small so party of 5 was tight but we were able to check our coats which helped with space.
2019-11-25,5,Visited for brunch a few days back and loved it. Luis the manager is on top Of it! We got a nice half booth in the back and ordered french toast and eggs Florentine. Delicious! Everything came with fresh fruit. With the egg plates you get a choice of potatoes, fries or salad. The fries were awesome and the potatoes were good too. If you come in the winter, get the hot chocolate. The service was friendly and fast, my water was never below full. Do yourself a favor and come to this cozy spot on Washington.
2019-11-23,4,I had a great time here at brunch last weekend. There's always a crowd during outdoor seating season, so admittedly I've been a little intimidated to pop by. As we came by in Nov, we sat indoors. We arrived around noon, and I thought we must've missed the brunch crowd. We were seated right away. By 12:45 things were popping and there was quite a line to sit down. This all being said, our waitress never rushed us to leave. We had a wonderful 2 hour brunch and I would definitely recommend this place! A+ for Ambiance!
2019-11-20,5,I frequent the Elysian quite often. In fact, I have been going there and receiving the best of service for 16 years from its original ownership to the second owner. Travis and crew do a great job here. Like every restaurant, there are great days and some that are not as perfect. But I have never experienced service that was subpar. Here is a message to those who think tipping 20% on a check that is reduced by 50% by the owners due to a promotion IS TOO MUCH.TIP YOUR SERVERS! If you are a cheapskate, stay home and eat some mac and cheese. How dare you disrespect the people who work so hard to serve you properly. Why should they bare the burden of the generous discount because you are so cheap?Pretty pathetic. I am there all the time so if you have a problem with me calling out how disgraceful you are just come and say hello. If you have kids, try to teach them better. If you don't, just try to be better person.Shameful to write a review like that, but this is a teaching moment. Try to be a better person and if you can't afford to tip properly, stay home Mike C.
2019-11-20,1,Went on a Wednesday night which is half off wine night. What we didn't understand is, when it's half off wine you are forced to pay 20% tip on the entire meal, which includes the full price on the wine. So we were a table of two, and forced to pay 20% tip on the full price of the wine, which was sold to us half price. I've never seen a forced 20% tip on a dinner for 2 people. Place is a scam and the service is questionable.
2019-11-17,5,Best brunch I've had in a long time. Loved the french toast - the portion size was perfect and the flavors were to die for. The ambiance, while crowded and loud, was also very cute and charming. The perfect place for a Sunday brunch. We were initially told there would be a wait for a table when we arrived, but we ended up being seated almost straight away. Excellent service and excellent food!
2019-11-17,4,A consistent favorite- expect a wait for brunch (between 15-30min) but worth it if you have time to kill. I really love how great the food is and how simple the menu is. They have something for everyone and prices are so reasonable. I always leave satisfied. This mornings brunch we ordered a salad to start and each ordered a main mean. They split the salad for us which I thought was nice. I had the grilled chicken sandwich, it really was so good! Serving was huge so I took 1/2 home! My friend ordered the 2 eggs/bacon- she loved it. We also got bloody Mary's and mimosas. Highly recommend if you have some patience. I do like this spot for dinner too!
2019-11-16,5,My roommate and I live a few blocks away from this gem. Every time we have gone to Elysian we have experienced great service and great food. The service is always top notch. The poutine fries and French onion soup are to die for. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. The decor of the restaurant is classic and elegant. You feel like you're in a NYC restaurant when inside. Outdoor seating in the nice weather is a must too. We love this place!
2019-11-10,5,Anyone who doesn't like this place is a moron. Great food. Great service awesome atmosphere. Literally every single thing on the menu is good. I like the Bahn Mi sandwich and I've BEEN to Saigon, people.  Place is the best.  A true HBK original.
2019-09-29,4,Dined at Elysian Cafe for Sunday brunch with a party of 9. We made a reservation a week or so before. There's indoor and outdoor space; it was pretty hot when we went so we decided to sit inside. The decor makes it feel like you are in a parisian cafe. I ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs and tomato hollandaise. It was served with a few grapes, orange slices, and pomme frites. The frites were perfectly crisp and salty. Loved the avo toast and the eggs were poached perfectly. Others ordered smoked salmon benedict, pancakes, the burger, steak salads, and a chicken sandwich on focaccia.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals. They also had BOMB iced coffee :)The waitress we had was a little abrupt. Not outwardly rude, but didn't feel friendly and she got a bit snappy when we were ordering.Overall, solid brunch spot and would be interested to check out their dinner menu!
2019-09-23,4,I came here for brunch after a long run starting from Queensboro Bridge to Hoboken, which is about 21 miles long. Elysian Cafe offers voluminous dishes that include protein rich food like steaks and eggs, which is great after a workout. Their french fries come out piping hot and crispy. This was my second time doing the run, and I had the Croque Madame - it looked great with the golden crusted bread and tasted awesome!
2019-08-30,3,Pretty place - small tables & narrow resturant - I wish I had come with less people because inside the round tables being pushed together was kind of annoying.  Food was fine and staff was nice....I'll have to go back and sit outside sometime and see how I like that one...
2019-08-29,5,Elysian Cafe is truly a hidden gem in Hoboken. My ultimate favorite dish is the BLT with a side of fries. It will probably be the most savory BLT you'll ever have. No joke. Their grilled cheese is great as well. They plant onion bits inside the bread, which makes it that much more delicious. They're available on uber eats too which is super convenient!
2019-08-26,3,Not what it used to be.  French Onion soup was just ok.   The burger was good however.  The short rib au gratin was not great.  The short rib was way to sweet.  Wonder if they have changed owners.
2019-08-18,4,I had the lobster roll here recently and it was the best lobster roll I have had in the area.  Seriously, I'm not sure it is worth getting a lobster roll anywhere else in Hudson County.
2019-08-13,3,I understand this used to be a good place to have a casual meal. On a very nice evening we chose to eat outside. At the next table someone was smoking, something that is no longer allowed in Hoboken. Drinks were fine with about a half dozen beers on tap and a number of wines by the glass. French Onion Soup at $9.50 was okay, not the rich broth I was looking forward to. We ordered to skirt steaks, $27, one rare, one medium. Both came out overcooked and dry. The server did take them back for new steaks. Both again came out fully cooked. The others in our group were already eating so even though we pointed out the way the steaks were cooked we kept them. The waiter said he would tell the owner/manager. Nobody ever came to check on us. The strip steak $30 was ordered medium rare also was overcooked. The salad with chunks of turkey and lardons. The salad was good but the lardons were inedible.
2019-08-07,5,Solid Steak frites and good drinks....one of our go-to's in Hoboken.
2019-08-07,3,I went here a while back, and it was only ok.  I'm so unclear on why this place is PACKED all of the time-especially outside when there are so many other outdoor options in Hoboken, honestly.The location is fine/easily accessible by foot/bus, but of course like all Hoboken restaurants if you're driving, parking is a nightmare, so don't drive if you can avoid it.I don't know that there's anything particularly special about the menu or the drinks-really straightforward, so all in all, this place is ok, but with enough other ok options in town, and some really awesome ones, I wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to make it here for a meal.
2019-08-01,4,Are here for lunch a few weeks ago. The food was really great. I like the grilled chicken sandwich - it's honestly a stellar sandwich! I have also been here for brunch and they have a great menu. The steak and eggs is worth a try!Try to grab an outside table, if they are available. The outside area is almost like a little garden!
2019-08-01,5,Perfect quiet afternoon restaurant.  We had the kindest, friendly waitress.  Rainstorm outside so we didn't get to enjoy the adorable outdoor seating, but what perfect booth beside wide open windows to watch the rain.  Mostly impressed by delicious & creative cocktails.  Food was also good.
2019-07-25,4,Elysian Cafe is one of my favorite go-to restaurants around Hoboken. Brunch, lunch, and dinner are all great and I've seriously never been disappointed. Every time I go I say I will try something different but always get the grilled chicken sandwich. It just leaves me feeling full and happy ‍. However, if your in the mood for a burger, fish and chips, or even a salad you won't be disappointed. This is also my moms favorite brunch spot around Hoboken because of the size of the mimosas. They give you a big glass which is something you don't usually get for your money! We have even celebrated a holiday here because she loves this place so much. The main dining area atmosphere is pub/cozy and the room in the back is great if you want to host a little event. Next time you are contemplating where you want to eat..try Elysian!
2019-07-06,4,Great brunch place, great food at a reasonable price.  Been here a few times for brunch and had never been disappointed!  We tried so far the blueberry pancakes, it's fluffy and light.  The smoke salmon eggs Benedict is very good, eggs are perfectly poached.  Their French fried are so yummy too, prefer this over the home fried.  My husband and I been their with our families and everyone was happy with their choices and enjoyed it as much as we did.  We are very lucky to be able to call this place our neighborhood gem!
2019-06-18,5,I seriously love this place!! You get your money's worth -- and it's delicious. I always tell myself I'm going to try something new but I'm just so hooked on the smoked salmon sandwich that I can't help but order it each time. They pile it up and you get a side salad or fries of your choice.Love the outside seating area in the summer.
2019-06-17,5,Stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon for brunch.  The lobster roll was amazing!!!!  Ambience was great too and servers were friendly.
2019-05-29,4,Cute little spot. Busy street for outdoor dining. Brunch was good, but I'm not craving to go back to try anything else.
2019-05-27,4,Had a bottle of prosecco on a sunny afternoon.  Order a glass of OJ to make your own mimosas.
2019-05-19,3,I've always enjoyed the atmosphere of Elysian. They have really nice outdoor seating and the inside is very comforting. They have a good cocktail list and wine list. I had the short rib dinner which was ok... I think. Elysian is a decent place but I think they need a menu upgrade with some decent entrees. Also, the bartenders weren't that personable. It's a decent place for lunch vs dinner.
2019-05-09,3,Lunch with family, good food, subpar waiter. Needed to flag another waiter to get the rest of the orders. 2 people got theirs, the other 4 at the table had to get someone not named ***** to bring out the rest of the orders. The waiter named ***** never came back to see if everything was alright. An order of Chicken Caesar with no anchovies came with anchovies. Veggie burger was mostly mushy peas that kept falling apart after sliding off the bun. That wasn't *****'s fault though.Chicken tortilla soup was ordered but French onion soup was delivered. Side orders of pommes frites needed to be reminded and requested. That might have been why ***** only returned when we requested the check. Gave him a decent tip though the bus person and the second waiter was infinitely more attentive and helpful and more deserving of the tip.Should we return, we will avoid that particular waiter.Not the Hoboken food experience I anticipated for my out of town family members.
2019-04-25,1,Love this local bar. Don't go on Thursday night. The bartender is so non customer friendly. He overcharged us for a margarita that was on happy hour menu because we asked for the drink without strawberries. Apparently this changed the happy hour drink from costing six dollars to twelve dollars. When I got the bill I asked why he didn't tell us requesting no strawberry in the happy hour margarita doubled the price?  He very nastily said "I don't make the rules man, I just enforce them.  Then he turned his back on us and walked away. I go to this bar a lot. Normally on Wednesday and Saturday. I will not be back on Thursday night. I left feeling like I got screwed at my favorite local establishment.
2019-04-22,5,One of my favorite lunch spots. I usually love grabbing a seat at the bar but you can't beat the lovely outdoor patio on a warm day. Jason is a good dude,a friendly bartender, and knows our order. The best smoked salmon sandwich I've had pretty much ever. Cut thin and always tastes fresh. A lot of times a restaurant will give you a thoughtless salad with a sandwich but theirs has sliced fennel and is evenly dressed every single time. The wine selection is on point here too. They have introduced me to some of my current favs like The Educated Guess. I've had great dinners here as well along side refreshing local live music which feels like a rarity in Hoboken. Top it off with that gorgeous restored ceiling decor. Great vibes all around.
2019-04-12,4,Wonderful brunch menu. Had the cinnamon-amaretto french toast w/ a screwdriver, blissful.
2019-04-05,2,I don't like giving bad reviews but some places earn them, including the Elysian cafe. We dined here once and we will not be back. The service is terrible. Our waiter was rude and inattentive. We ordered mussels. They were not flavorful. We were disappointed. And the cost was outrageous here too. So not worth it. Higher quality and better tasting dishes at Tutta Pesca. The ceiling was beautiful, but that's all that was.
2019-03-19,4,If the walls, ceiling and overall decor and ambiance of this place doesn't win you over, then the food hopefully will. This is one of my favorite Hoboken places to go out for dinner when I want to feel fancy, without having to spend an arm and a leg. I've probably only gone on a Monday because they have an amazing special. The entire bar entree menu is 2 for 1. So it really is a great way to make a Monday a bit special. Pair that with a drink and you just made Monday VERY special. They had a great cocktail menu but I usually keep it simple and stick with red wine. In the past, I've had their mussels, arugula pizza, chicken sandwich, all of which had been amazing. Last time I came, I ordered the steak sandwich. It came on a a soft baguette with onions and gruyere cheese with a salad on the side. I loved it. The meat was cooked perfectly so I could actually bite into it and didn't have to resort to a knife and fork and there was plenty of it. Really, they definitely did not skimp on the steak part of the steak sandwich. The only request I would have had is a little sauce or aioli for it. Because it's a sandwich and not just a steak, I thought it needed something else on it. Just a personal preference. My boyfriend got the tortilla soup and I tried it. It was really tasty! I'd never had it before, it basically tastes like a taco, probably why my boyfriend was very eager to order it in the first place.  This is also a really wonderful place to come in the summer when all of their outdoor seating is set up. I haven't had brunch here yet but, just based on every dining experience I've ever had here, I am sure they do a great job.
2019-03-18,4,Decided to stop in for brunch on an early Saturday afternoon while visiting my sister in Hoboken. The place was crowded and people were waiting, but we were lucky enough to be seated right away. While the menu may be a little more American than French, the ambiance at Elysian Cafe has a lovely Parisian vibe.We ordered the eggs florentine and the avocado toast. Both were tasty and well prepared, if nothing extraodinary. There's a lot to be said for getting perfectly poached eggs! The Lyonannaise potatoes that come with are also very good. The service was great, our order was taken quickly and beverages and food arrived in short order. Our coffee cups and water carafe were kept full. Good food and prices, great ambiance and service, I can see this becoming a weekend favorite.
2019-03-04,5,Beautiful location, friendly staff and a dynamite drink selection. Easily a favorite in Hoboken. Brunch was fantastic!
2019-03-01,5,This place just never disappoints. Food is delicious, plentiful and reasonably priced. Just finished lunch. Great choices are the calamari salad and the salmon club. And no one can challenge that it's a beautiful French bistro environment. La sure bet if you can get in.
2019-02-25,4,Cute and tasty. Had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, the place was quiet and had soccer playing on the TVs at the bar. I ordered the grilled cheese and it did not disappoint. Made on sourdough with leeks and onions, the very cheesy sandwich had a nice crunch and taste to it. Not to mention the fries were perfect.
2019-02-24,4,Went here on a Sunday with a couple friends and I'm happy we made a reservation because this place was pretty crowded. Beautiful architecture inside with very detailed ceilings. Great service and food and drinks were delicious.  I enjoyed a Grilled Chicken Sandwich and a mimosa. I was just surprised drink prices went up during brunch time to 7 dollars.
2019-02-10,5,Amazing brunch I had today, ordered the Salmon Benedict with fries  came with blackberries, orange  slices and strawberries  along with the salmon laced with hollandaise sauce over an English muffin. The place gets slammed on the weekends for brunch so go early. They accept cash/credit , there is a bathroom is in the basement of the place and bike parking or car parking is going to be tough when the weather nice. Better off taking an Uber or walking to there. It is not handicapped accessible so keep that in mind. Another great item are their burgers and , bon appetit! If you have to wait there's a few coffee spots one on Hudson st called Hudson Coffee or go across to bwe and cool out.
2019-02-09,4,The mussels and fries are great awesome brunch too.  Love their fries and the garlic bread!  The ceiling is beautiful but wish the band had a better space.  What can you do?
2019-02-09,4,Nothing fancy but a very solid restaurant for brunch or dinner. I love the poutine and would go back just for that! It's topped with cheese curds,duck confit and foie gras gravy. Love that they have a bar area and a separate dining room if you're looking to sit down for a meal.
2019-01-28,5,A Hoboken staple. The food is always good. I love the chicken sandwich as well as the steak salad. I also love sitting outside here in the warmer months. It's a great place to bring your family. I really love it here!
2019-01-20,5,Just saw that this was only 3.5 and I felt guilty that I never spoke up. This place is perfect. Their pub food is everything could ever want. Their entrees get the job done. They have the best bartenders in Hoboken. When sandy hit, my wife and I lived up the block and they stayed open pumping out their hits at cost, unlike other local businesses that gouged the locals. I am doubling down on this place now that I know they don't get the love they deserve.
2019-01-20,5,I have been a die-hard fan of Elysian for over 10 years. Hands down the best BLT ever and I only recently discovered their key lime pie - shut up. It's amazing. Also exciting is they make a decent Pimms cup which can be hard to find. Basically I've never had a bad meal here and the servers and bar tenders are amazing  As a side note, they were one of the few restaurants that opened and served a limited menu at fair prices during hurricane sandy when Hoboken had no power for a week plus. Can't say enough good things about this place!
2018-12-19,5,This is the Elysian Field of Hoboken bars. Not too many nuckleheads and a healthy sprinkling of mature, area locals. It takes awhile to warm up to the lanquid routine and menu quirks of this place. For example, why is Lobster Roll only (officially) available at dinner but not lunch? The historic ambiance, however, makes up for any questions you may have, along with great, dedicated service from day bartender Alex. Become a semi-regular and you won't complain too much.
2018-11-20,5,Went with a group for dinner. We ordered a bunch of different thinks. Lamb burger great. Salads great. I love their plaster sculpted dining room. With that tiled floor feels like I stepped back in time. And I'm rich af
2018-11-11,4,Cute spot in Hoboken, my only complaint is that the service is slow. We got there and had to wait 35 minutes to be seated, which isn't bad but there were a couple of open tables available. The food was very good and once seated the service was Great! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good food in the neighborhood.
2018-11-11,5,Definitely my go to spot in Hoboken. Whether I'm having lunch with a friend from out of town or just stopping in for happy hour, I haven't been disappointed yet. On Mondays, they have drink specials and two-for-one bar menu specials. Wednesdays they have specials on mussels and other appetizers. Happy hour is weekdays from 4-7. The food is always super fresh and delicious. My favorite is the smoked salmon sandwich. Portions are more than fair. I like to sit at the bar and this place can get a bit crowded on weekends and for dinner on weekdays so I generally try to avoid those times. Not to mention, when you come at off times, there is almost always some type of special or happy hour deal going on. Otherwise, I can see how it can get expensive.
2018-10-13,2,Food was really average, basically bar food. We got the grilled cheese, which was crunchy but not cheesy enough. The steak sandwich was very greasy, had soggy bread, wasn't tasty, and was difficult to eat. The fish and chips had fresh fish but the batter was too thick and soggy. The french fries were okay.They serve coffee and cappuccino but do not list this on the menu.We were ready to order and found out we could only order from half of the menu, which I wish they had told us sooner.Our server never gave us water and never checked on us after we got our meals. Spent the entire meal trying to get someone's attention so we could get water!The ambience is cute and welcoming. It might be a nice bar for locals but I probably wouldn't go back coming from far away.
2018-09-28,5,This is a gem. Lovely setting and ambiance. Food was unexpectedly delicious. Good variety of menu selections. We've been back twice.
2018-09-25,1,The food was bad. The burger and bacon were burnt to a cancer-inducing state. The buns were dry. The fries were little nibs. Do not recommend.
2018-09-19,1,Over cooked bread?? I am not sure about that...The place looks cute, the drink is Ok, the food can be improved.
2018-09-02,5,Coming from Brooklyn, it's hard for food to impress me.  I was blown away by everything we tried here.  The octopus appetizer is the best octopus anything I've ever had.  It's so tender, melts right in your mouth with incredible flavor.  The braised pork belly appetizer special was something else.  And the crab cake appetizer was unreal.  Even the French fried were perfect!  The Chef recommended the strawberry short cake for dessert and it was EVERYTHING.  Not too sweet, not heavy at all....the Meyers lemon cream went perfectly with the dish.  I'd make the trip to Hoboken just to eat here again and again and again.
2018-08-30,3,Nice ambience. Very few vegan options. More vegan friendly options would be helpful. Hence although it's nice, I avoid going to this place due to the lack of options.
2018-08-23,4,If you're a brunch fanatic like I am, then this is the place to be. Easily one of the best brunch spots in Hoboken. The restaurant itself is very nice looking and very aesthetic for the IG people. The food itself is very good. I would recommend the Eggs Florentine for first timers. Get those with either Fried or Home Fries, both are equally as good. One thing that I don't like is the service is a bit slow and it takes a bit for your food to come out. And drinks are a little pricey too. Despite that I'm here every few weeks for some brunch with friends or family.
2018-08-11,4,Just stopped in for a quick lunch recently, ordered a cheeseburger, was very good!  Cooked as ordered, medium rare.  Would go here again!
2018-07-22,4,Came to visit a friend in Hoboken, and we decided to come here for brunch on a Sunday with all 6 of us. We called ahead of time, and staff was able to tell us that they'll have room for us, which was great. First off, great outdoor area with a very relaxing vibe with greenery surrounding the restaurant. The indoor ambiance is also very classy, which was nice.Food was great! I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict with a side of sausage, and it honestly was one of the best brunch benedicts I've ever had. And the home fries/potatoes were on point as well! Prices were decent for brunch and averaged around $12-16. The restaurant also serves drinks, which I didn't try. I don't think they have bottomless.Service was decent. Lots of staff walking around running and clearing dishes. My server was good, though I did see more of the other staff than I did her. Everyone was super nice! I would definitely come back and recommend others to try at least once!
2018-07-22,3,So... this place is ok. Don't get expect anything too amazing. The main lost point here is that the food quality doesn't exactly equate to cost. The food is what I would expect at a free breakfast at a decent hotel. Not a meal I spend $30 for. I came for Brunch and ordered two entrees because I like food. However, I had the Eggs Benedict and it didn't have Hollandaise sauce on it. It had melted butter. My eggs are not lobster. On the other had I had the amaretto-cinnamon French toast and it was phenomenal. The rest of the food could use a touch more seasoning and maybe even a bit more time in the oven (an English Muffin should be toasted). Finally, the drinks are a decent price but can not compete with anyplace that offers alcohol specials or heaven forbid an all you can drink mimosas special. It's fine if your in the area, just don't go out of your way to get here. Overall I wouldn't recommend with Anthony's less than a block away.
2018-07-22,2,Far from my best brunch experience. First of all, we arrived at our table to dirty glasses. Even after we brought up the issue, we were still served dirty glasses with our drinks. The waitress also did not know how to communicate the products to us. I asked for eggs benedict with a side of french toast and my entree was missing an item listed on the menu. The portions are not worth the price. The only reason I was generous enough to give this place 2 stars was because their French toast was fairly good. Anthony David's is just down the street. Don't waste your time here.
2018-07-15,5,My friend and I went for brunch and while it was a little crowded, it was still great. They were really accommodating when our reservation had to change last minute, and while they were extremely busy they kept checking on us while we were waiting to keep us updated on the status of our table and the transparency was greatly appreciated. Our food was delicious and my friend and I loved sitting in the back room. We felt like we were in Versailles
2018-07-14,5,Went for brunch and had the egg white omelet with salad instead of potatoes, as well as a side of bacon. The iced coffee was good and our waitress was very nice. This place is definitely one of my top choices for brunch along with Anthony David's.
2018-07-07,1,This is NOT a place good for kids! You can't sit inside having a stroller and there is only one place under the burning sun they are ready to give you to sit outside if you have a stroller. Never again.
2018-07-06,4,One of my favorite spots in Hoboken! The inside is historic and the outdoor seating is great. The staff is attentive and friendly. Food is excellent! Only 4 stars because sometimes it can be a little pricey, but worth it on occasion!
2018-06-25,4,Takes brunch reservations- I don't know any place in Hoboken other than here that does this. Food was good. The place gets pretty crowded with people waiting to be seated without reservations and the bar gets pretty full too. You feel as though people are hovering over you so they can have your table. They have outside seating which if the weather permits could be a great alternative.
2018-06-24,5,We had a Saturday brunch here. We've ordered only 2 meals for the three of us and it was more than enough because their portions are big. The pancakes were so good but the orange juice wasn't fresh!
2018-06-15,4,Quiet,classy. Good service. Pricey but average for the area. Outdoor patio seating is quiet, indoor bar is clean and nice. Older crowd typically.
2018-06-07,5,Great landmark place! We got sandwiches in the mid afternoon and they were pretty big. Having our newborn together, initially we had to insist a bit too take the foldable stroller inside (which was pretty empty) but then the service and food were pretty good, the decoration is outstanding and the manager / maybe owner came to our table and gifted a newborn body for our little one! That was such a nice gesture!We'd definitely go back when around Hoboken!
2018-06-03,2,Average dining. Service was prompt and friendly. I tried the onion soup, which for $9 was ok for the price, but I've tasted far better in lower-scale establishments.Main course was a BLT, or should I say Blt, as the bacon completely overpowered the rest of the components. What I got was a mound of thick cut bacon that tasted overwhelmingly like salt with a few puny roasted tomatoes and lettuce on a sliver of toast.  You get a lot of meat for what you pay, but very little balance.I was visiting friends, so will probably not be back.
2018-05-20,5,Elysian Cafe not only has amazing food but the service is unmatched. I recently came here for dinner with a large group of friends and was so glad we picked the perfect spot. Even though we were a good sized table, they were kind enough to split the bill with several credit cards and didn't hesitate to help us take a bunch of photos. It might sound like very small things but helpful service that removes any friction from a dinner experience can really make a difference  - especially when you know they're busy on a Saturday and can easily decide to not be helpful outside of doing their job to just serve you food. The menu also had so many great options. I ate the calamari, steak salad and mushroom risotto which was all delicious.As far as atmosphere, this restaurant is very beautiful. The British royal wedding (Harry + Meghan) had been earlier that day so the vibe was fun and festive.I highly recommend this place for everything from big groups to romantic dates and will certainly be coming back next time I'm in Hoboken!!
2018-05-14,5,Great place. I go there for late lunches on Saturdays or Sundays. I never ordered anything I did not like. Service is great. Parking in Hoboken can be the challange if you are driving in. Park in the first spot you see and walk, Hoboken is a very small town, everything is in walking distance.
2018-05-08,3,Im being a bit generous with this one only because our waiter was such a mice lady. Food was a solid C+ as to be expected. The poutin fries were killer but the oysters were ehhhh.  We sat in the back, and you can clearly see the back room is in serious need of a make over. The corners of the room were dusty and paint was chipping off the doors.  Sitting outdoors is definitly the best bet with this one as it has a cool funky vibe to it.  Drinks were very good and everything is reasonably priced. Overall, not bad but needs some tuning up
2018-05-08,3,Outdoor and indoor seating. The environment is nice indoors. There was construction happening outdoors that was super loud and annoying, so we moved indoors. Tried the spiced lamb burger, and it was great! Tasted like a normal burger with a spiced twist. Food took awhile to come out but I'd say because it was fresh. BLT was stacked. They weren't stingy with the bacon or anything. Good wine and drink list. Nice place!
2018-05-07,4,Came here with former coworkers, one of whom recommended the place. We ordered coffee and brunch, everything from eggs Florentine to steak and eggs to avocado toast. I myself ordered a cold brew and two over easy eggs with bacon, wheat toast, and French fries (pommes frites, not hash browns or home fries). Cold brew was not too bitter, not to sweet. Eggs were cooked nicely and were very runny, in a very good way. Toast was nicely buttered and didn't feel greasy, while the bacon was thick and chewy.As for the fries, I could write essays, dissertations, and novels about those fries. At first glance, it looks like a simple shoestring fry, nothing special. That impression disappears once you taste it. If you're a fan of McDonald's French fries, like I am, you'll absolutely love these fries. They are crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and flavorful without being overly salty or overly seasoned.Would absolutely be back here again!
2018-04-25,5,Best brunch in the area ! The staff is always nice and friendly They have a massive chicken avocado bacon sandwich highly recommended
2018-04-22,2,Just have to start off with the fact that our water was full of particles and the Santos tasted like straight water and juice. Don't think I will ever be coming back to this place. Sad, because it actually is really beautiful on the inside. The waiter w the long hair didn't even say hello when he came by the table. He kind of just stood their and stared at us.
2018-04-21,4,This is probably my favorite brunch in Hoboken. Their portions are perfect, leaving you completely satisfied. I've had their burger - super delish, their eggs benedict, also super delish. Their avocado toast with the hollandaise sauce is amazing & the salad makes it refreshing however, the amount of avocado on the toast is disrespectful if you're calling it an avocado toast & pricing it accordingly. It should probably just be called an egg benedict on toast featuring a hint of avocado. Otherwise highly recommend.
2018-03-27,5,Classy Classy Classy Classic European style vibe! Definitely not some hipster joint you visit to grab a beer and or light decaf coffee. Just entering the place you kinda get the feeling of being in another country. The interior is pub-like/wooden non-rustic classic, old school decor. Starting  from the first half of the restaurant and the back room where the more lively seating with huge windows and just gives the place a fresh feeling. This place won't disappoint you, trust me. The service was on point and really friendly. The wine/beer selection was great and I heard more likable comments about the mixed drinks from a man seated right by me. The FOOD:Amazing, not dry, and super delicious. Squid good, risotto amazing, and         ....................THE FRIES MAN! BRO....truffle garlic fries...... Phew.... Still dreaming about the perfection! 0/100 real quick. No but really though get these fries^^^^The SERVICE: We were seated right away and absolutely was on point with the water and quality of personal respect. The waiter just seemed like he was actually happy to help. (if that makes any sense).Over all perfect score! CONS: Parking is horrible in Hoboken. PERIOD
2018-03-14,3,This restaurant was very cute for brunch. When I first walked in, it felt like I was in a cafe in Europe. I was quite pleased.However, it was very sad to see that they were quite understaffed. I had to walk through the restaurant to find someone to put my name down on a waiting list. No one came up to me for 15+ minutes. Once we got seated, it took another 15+ minutes to put in our drink order. I felt bad for our waitress.When we went to order, I asked for a custom omelette with cheese, tomato and spinach. I thought it was a pretty simple request, but they would not take any special requests off the brunch menu given they were busy and understaffed. This was quite disappointing. I ended up settling with Eggs Benedict & my boyfriend got a Burger. Both were satisfying. Overall, I'm sad this wasn't as good of an experience as I had hoped.
2018-03-11,5,One of my favorite places in town. The quaint atmosphere, not to mention the adorable outdoor space, in combination with the great food, makes it a frequent go-to spot. Best French fries hands down and brunch, lunch and dinner menus offer variety.
2018-03-05,5,Loved the interior mood. Cool unique food options and kid friendly, a rare combo. Good drink choices. Our family had a great time. Thumbs way up!
2018-03-01,4,Delicious eggs Benedict with salmon! Great outdoor breakfast on the streets of Hoboken. Very busy in the morning/brunch time
2018-03-01,5,I tried their lunch on the weekday. It's really amazing to have such good cheap food in the old historical building. They recommend me their chicken sandwich with avocado inside. It's taste very good and only $9. Would like to come again and try other kinds of sandwiches.
2018-02-11,4,Actually i like the environment more than the food itself. Wall decoration attracted me a lot. I ordered salmon egg benedict. Salmon tasted really good while the English muffin was overcooked. Frities were tasty as well. Nice brunch place overall.
2018-01-27,5,This review goes out to Blair G., who happened to be sitting next to me this morning and gave this fine establishment a one star review because 1) he's cheap (see his complaints about refills); 2) his kids wouldn't shut up the entire meal; 3) he brought about 15 pieces of luggage to the seating area, obstructing the walking space for waiters and making it uncomfortable for others trying to be seated; and 4) because Blair G. is a miserable dude with low self-esteem. Blair G. most likely hates is life and just takes it out on other people through Yelp reviews. Maybe you shouldn't bring your infant to brunch? Maybe that would have made your experience better. I felt compelled to come on Yelp and post my opinion in response to Blair G.'s totally unjustified, baseless review. Just to show you what kind of slime we are dealing with here, at the conclusion of his meal, Blair G. announced, "I'm giving this establishment a one star review!" Really. The guy really did that. His poor wife and kids have to live with this d-bag. I give that family a four star review for living with you, Blair. Also, the food was "solidly mediocre"? Weird to hear that from a dude who finished his entire plate. Learn to tell the truth, my dude.This is an excellent establishment. The food is fantastic. The service is great (Love you, Benny!). And the atmosphere is pure comfort with a classy finish.
2018-01-27,1,The food is solidly mediocre, the menu is very limited, and the service is poor at best. They also charge for refills. So lame. I would skip this spot next time you're in Hoboken.
2018-01-20,4,Great ambiance, delicious brunch options, and fast, attentive service. I've always wanted to try Elysian Cafe and was able to check out their Saturday brunch today. I had the smoked salmon eggs Benedict with fries on the side, in addition to a few bellinis!Important to note that they don't take reservations for parties with less than four people. My boyfriend and I didn't want to wait for a table, so we opted for bar seats instead, which was fine! Overall, I think it's worth checking out if you're in Hoboken!
2018-01-05,4,Very nice pub like atmosphere. Service was fast and food was good. For a chicken sandwich topped with bacon I was really impressed. Then again thick sliced bacon can make a shoe taste good. Good place for brunch.
2017-12-31,3,Three months later I feel the need to add more on this so called manager. I had something on the banquette next to me and he was about to seat someone. He said to me "Can you move that" without so much as an "excuse me" or "please" or "thank you". Then the (older) woman was seated and within five minutes she asked to sit at a different table because she has hearing problems. He did not say "I'm so sorry, unfortunately that table is reserved. Would you like me to look for another option that might be suitable?"  His response to her very polite request was an extremely brusque "There are reservations" and then walked away.  Eugene. Please take note. I have come here almost once a week for years. I'm sorry to say that the service has declined a lot in the last several months.  Kitchen has become slow, busboy is actually sullen, and the manager is decidedly ungracious and unhelpful.  He does not greet patrons warmly when they arrive, he sometimes acts put out when they arrive, he studiously avoids making eye contact once they are seated, and he doesn't pitch in to help his staff At. All. There can be a check with a credit card waiting to be taken, or dirty dishes crowding a table, or someone holding a baby waiting to ask someone for a high chair, or empty water glasses, or someone with a hand up to get their waiter's attention, and he doesn't come over. He will actually just stand there and avoid eye contact. As someone who worked in restaurants for years, I'm pretty shocked by that. The busboy is largely useless as he doesn't notice empty water glasses, disappears for long stretches, And also acts put out when he's asked to do something. And why does the kitchen take 20+ min to make a salad during non rush time?Eugene, if you read this, please reach out.  Your amazing restaurant is not what it used to be.
2017-12-24,3,An average place to have a brunch or dinner. The food quality is ok but nothing special about it. For a holiday weekend it was one of the only places we found that were open
2017-12-10,3,Met a friend here for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. My friend enjoyed the french toast while I had the steak and eggs. Food and service were both just okay. My steak was kind of dry and their bloody Mary's are on the smaller side. However, they're only $6.I wouldn't rush back here as there are better brunch spots in Hoboken. But I also wouldn't be completely against patronizing this restaurant again either.
2017-11-30,4,Dined in for Sunday brunch with a group of friends. We made sure to make reservations. When we got there the restaurant was already filled but we didn't have to wait long for our table. Each table is kind of close to each other and the space is tight. It was Halloween season so the restaurant was decked out in decorations, very cute! I opted for the Croque Madame (Ham, Gruyere, Fried Egg, Pommes Frîtes). Delicious and I would get it again. They also serve alcoholic breakfast beverages so we got mimosas & bellinis.
2017-11-23,4,Cool restaurant in Hoboken.It has a section with a bar and tvs, playing sports usually and a section for quiet dining.They have amazing mussels and fries and the grilled octopus was decent. Big selection of wines.The staff and waiters are friendly, though they kept forgetting to get me my beer ‍.I would recommend this for a date night, and a nice dinner.
2017-11-18,4,Good food. Nice drinks. The price is slightly high for the quality of food and service. Things tend to move slow when they get busy.
2017-11-09,4,I went here for my birthday for dinner. The food was delicious and the staff were very polite.  Their happy hour specials are great as well
2017-10-31,4,Good brunch spot, went on a brisk Sunday around 12:15 with a friend and got seated almost immediately! Salmon benedict ($13.50) was good, and the blueberry pancakes were great ($9.00 - it comes witha side of bacon, ham or sasuage!). They leave a glass bottle of water on the table so you dont have to waive down the waiter. Only qualm is that it takes the food around 20 min to come out but its worth it!
2017-10-22,5,love this place, especially for brunch one of my go to places..i love there grilled cheese one of my guilty pleasures lol. but all around a great menu with a good mamosa..
2017-10-21,4,Went there for brunch one Sunday in August. Wait staff was friendly and attentive and let's us take our time when we ordered. Everyone ordered something different and all were very happy with the selections.  The Bloody Mary's and Bellinis were  great too.We will be back!
2017-10-12,3,I was excited to go to Elysian for dinner last night to celebrate an anniversary with my girlfriend.  We ordered the Mussels, the grilled octopus and then the steak frites for our main.  The mussels were not great and the Steak was hands down the worst steak i've ever had at a restaurant.  Not to mention that they charge $29 for it.  Furthermore I asked for the steak to come with a salad instead of the frites and they couldn't fit more frites on the plate that it came on.  I am very disappointing with this place and will likely not be revisiting for a long time.
2017-10-08,4,We've eaten here probably 50 times and normally the food and service is excellent.  They change their menu every few months and they always have a salmon dish on it which I love.   We also love their weekend brunch - frisée salad is my wife's favorite and I normally get the steak salad but with salmon instead.   And we drink down and couple of bloody Mary's and bellinis.   A great time. But what you must never do - I've tried it twice  and failed both times - is get takeout from here.   They package it like crap.   Don't do it.
2017-10-01,3,They only take reservations for parties of 4 or more.  We were able to get on a list with a 15 min wait on a Saturday afternoon around 1.  We waited for a bit for the indoor seating and after 20 mins, decided we were more hungry than in need of cool air conditioning.On a cooler day, the outside seating would be perfect.  You are pretty close to the sidewalk, so people can watch you and you can people watch.  Whether that's for you, I'm sure it'd be personal preference.The service is below average, our server didn't come to check on us after our food arrived and we had to flag her down for the check after sitting around drink-less.  Oh what a travesty, right.  First world problems.  Food is mediocre off the brunch menu, the eggs Benedict came out luke warm and the fries were over salted.  The bartender seems to know what they're doing because the one each mimosa and Bellini we had were tasty.
2017-09-27,4,This is one of our go-to places. The food never disappoints. Love coming for brunch and sitting outside. Very cozy outdoor area. My two favorites are the egg white omelet and grilled chicken sandwich. Whatever you do, get the fries. One thing I don't love is their drinks. I love bloody Mary's and theirs are just OK (usually very watery).
2017-08-27,2,Good food but I will not return for several reasons. There are plenty of places serving great tasting brunch in the Hoboken area as well so just good food won't keep me returning. They have small portions. Service was not exceptional. The kids menu was one price of $8.85 (however there was an additional service charge $1.15 automatically per child), why not just say your kids meal are $10?! The kids burger is a slider. My child never even got his kids drink that came with his meal. When we asked where the drink was at the end of the meal, the server blamed the bar for being backed up. Then she gave us our check and we were about to pay when we remembered she never asked us what we wanted for the kids meal dessert. And when we asked if we can order that, she said "you can do that anytime!" But we have our check already! I ordered an iced coffee with my brunch, unlike most places, it's doesn't come with refills. I was also not given my milk for my coffee for a long time, by the time I got it, my coffee was so diluted (sat outside on a hot day). Just wasn't very pleasant. Again, given all the great brunch foods in Hoboken, I just wouldn't choose to come back to here again.
2017-08-25,4,The background on this place alone is cool, and the way they really hone in on the cool facts about the restaurant is a fun time. I was in Hoboken, NJ visiting friends who live in the area. They insisted we go to this restaurant based on the french onion soup. I did not get the french onion soup, but goodness it smelled and looked awesome. I ended up getting the mussels and I was beyond happy with my choice. The waiter (who was wonderful) even brought me out extra bread to dip in all the extra juices from the mussels (YUM!)When I get back to Hoboken, I'll definitely visit this place again.  Great interior, and awesome patio (although it was raining this day so we couldn't sit outside) and great product.
2017-08-19,3,Can get a bit crowded on the weekends - I felt like I was sitting with the strangers next to us, but the food is very good. Would definitely recommend Elysian to get a quick bite. Prices are fair. Giving this place three stars due to the wait staff. Mimosa was watered down and waiter gave me issues whenever I asked for something.
2017-08-17,5,Favorite spot in Hoboken for a drink brunch lunch dinner dessert you name it! Best drinks and such delicious food. This place has an old French garden feel both inside and outside. Also the outside seating is right on Washington Street so you can enjoy the scenery
2017-08-11,5,Today I had the most amazing service at this place! I had a tall European girl as a server who recommended me amazing wine. It was a little bit pricy but she was right, wine was crisp and dry! What was really amazing was that a European server is coming from Croatia the famous Kings Landing! I got an insight of the Game of Thrones cast! What a trilling evening, I will definitely come back to this hidden Hoboken jewel! Thank you!
2017-07-27,5,This is my favorite Monday night spot...2 for 1 deal...Love it!
2017-07-26,5,Nice place to spend time at noon, beers are Good, really like the salmon club for its Price
2017-07-23,5,The BEST salmon I've had in a while. And don't even get me started on the cream brulee. Highly recommend this place
2017-07-17,3,The food here is mediocre, though its decor, waitstaff, outdoor seating, layout, and ambiance definitely make it a nice venue. We came here last year for Mother's Day brunch and ordered The Elysian Burger, Two Eggs Any Style, and Cinnamon-Amaretto French Toast. If you sit outside, your pet is allowed to join you so long as they don't make a commotion. The star of the meal was the french toast, and something I would most definitely recommend a thousand times over. However, the remainder of the meal was standard. Even the bellini was sub par. When returning for Father's Day this year, my father took a look at the menu with dismay and we ended up leaving and dining elsewhere. The brunch menu is very limited, and for a man who regularly craves a Western Omelet, simply a Egg White Omelet and Fromage Omelet don't cut it.For lunch/dinner, the fish and chips are definitely a hit, and I've yet to find anywhere else in Hoboken that's worth venturing to for fish and chips. However, some of their other entrees are a little lackluster. As for it's overall quality of French cuisine, it definitely isn't comparable French Bistros in Paris, and had it not been but for the fact that Brasserie de Paris closed, that's where I would be recommending you dine at instead.
2017-07-16,5,lunch was great onion soup delicious not salty service amazing super helpful and nice decor i felt like i was in Paris will definitely come back delicious omelet salad and reuben sandwich
2017-06-23,3,We came here one night for dinner and sat outside. The food was good, but not great. I ordered the duck confit fries appetizer. A bit greasy and for the main dish I had the fish tacos. Kind of bland but the dipping sauce helped. My friends ordered the salmon which they really liked. Drinks were strong and well made. Our waiter was really fast, friendly & attentive. Came here about a week after and the girl at the door said nonchalantly, it was an hour and a half wait. "Take it or leave it" attitude. Didn't offer at all to let us go by the bar or even apologize for the long wait. Seemed more like she could care less, so we left. Not sure how often I'd go back here.
2017-06-18,2,We arrived for Father's Day Sunday brunch at 10:30am. There was no wait for a table inside or outside. Instead of greeting us and asking for a table inside or out, the hostess stood in front of the door and told us that seating for a table inside would be an hour wait. Looking around the restaurant it was clearly more than half empty with plenty of inside seating. We settled on a table outside but I was still confused why we couldn't sit inside. After we placed our order, I went inside to use the bathroom and walked past the dining room. There were plenty of open tables. I walked back out and asked the hostess if we could get a table inside. She pointed over to the tables in the bar area and said that they just cleared it up and that it was now available. That was completely untrue as those tables were empty when we first walked in. While we were sitting there, people were coming in and the hostess was asking them if they would like to sit inside or outside. I was completely annoyed at this point. Parties of 2,3 etc were coming in and seated right away in the dining area. When we were leaving, the hostess did not say thank you and pretty much ignored us. She was very unfriendly and unprofessional. A restaurant with this reputation should not have someone like this working there. Our neighbors highly recommended Elysian and we were excited to try it out. I'm giving 2 stars since the food was good and the waitstaff were all nice. I'm taking away 3 stars for the unfriendly hostess!
2017-06-04,3,My fiance and I came to Elysian right when they were completing their brunch menu and opening up the bar menu (~3ish pm on a Saturday).No wait at all for seating outside during a sunny but windy day and prompty received excellent and courteous service.We both ordered the lamb burgers- one of us opting for a salad and the other for fries.While the lamb itself was juicy and cooked to perfection and complemented nicely with the included pesto, the bun itself was a bit hard to take down: seemed a bit old, noticeable in both flavor and texture. The salad was decent as well, but nothing to write home about, and the fries-- while thin and crispy, were extremely salty.We had an average meal here that satisfied a late lunch craving; a bit pricey for what it's worth so will likely opt to try another Hoboken offering next time we're in the area.
2017-06-02,4,I just moved back to Hoboken and hadn't had a meal at the Elysian in 2 years!   It was a Thursday night and the place was packed.  I squeezed into the only stool at the bar.  I ordered the Herb Braised Atlantic Cod,with Sauteed Spinach and Boulangere Potatoes.  The dish couldn't have been more delicious.  It was a nice sized portion of cod that was perfectly seared on the outside and succulent and flaky on the inside.  The Boulangere Potatoes were delicious as well, thinly sliced potatoes and onions on top of the sauteed spinach.   The portion was more than enough as I was able to grab a doggy bag and have the leftovers the next day for lunch!  Still tasty!  Side Note:  The place was restored years ago (beautiful ceiling)!  Also, a climatic scene from the movie Sleepers (Brad Pitt, R. Deniro, Kevin Bacon, Dustin Hoffman..)  was filmed there in the back room dining area...
2017-05-14,1,Horrible!went there for mothers day.not a long wait and i know why. Silverware was disgusting crusty and dirty. I had to ask for new ones and then clean it with hand sanitizer. The bellini had sediments in the bottom. I didn't finish it. My mom had burger which she said wasn't bad. My son had the eggs Benedict which was nothing special. I had the lobster roll which had a creamy sauce, but not bad.the most horrendous dish was my husband's steak and eggs. Eggs were raw and runny, steak was overdone looked like beef jerky, fries were stale and cold.Tables near entrance were brought in from outdoors and were tiny, so tiny our silverware kept dropping on floor. Waiter had very dirty uniform, definitely not reminiscent of French bistro. I cant believe this location is a sister company to Amanda's which is across street. Its more like the dirty homeless sister. The antique decor was the only nice thing about the place. Never again
2017-05-14,2,My wife and I went for brunch on Mother's Day. Three problems: 1) I ordered the steak and eggs and the skirt steak was very tough; 2) my wife's eggs Benedict arrived cold; 3) the Bloody Marys had almost no vodka in them. I drank two and felt absolutely nothing. I realize Mother's Day isn't the best day for dining out since the restaurants are very busy but still, I was disappointed.
2017-05-05,1,Ordered through Uber Eats and what a disappointment. Salmon over Lentils with Shallot gastrique came as Salmon over Couscous. The gastrique was boiled chopped shallots which smelled and tasted horrible. Sirloin steak salad came with well done steak. Poutine had the skinniest fries ever. Poutine should have thicker cut fries.
2017-05-03,3,Elysian looks like an old cafe that has a lot of charm. My boyfriend has been living nearby for about four months and we finally got the chance to try it out after all that time. We came in on a beautiful, sunny and warm Saturday at about 1 pm for brunch. The wait for an outside table was only 15 minutes.We were seated pretty quickly and they took our drink and food orders swiftly as well. The drinks came out shortly after, but our food was nowhere to be seen until about a half an hour later. People who were seated after us, got their food before us. I think it was a fluke (I hope). I'd definitely be willing to give it another chance because I really enjoyed the grilled chicken sandwich (with bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato, herb mayo, and French fries) when I did finally get it. Plus, it's relatively inexpensive. For $13, you can get a plate of steak and eggs with home fries and toast. Hoping it'll be a better experience next time. Not sure I want to unleash the inner Hulk that takes over when I get hungry.
2017-04-23,5,Great brunch spot. My girlfriend and I went here on our first date. The waiter was super friendly and witty which made brunch fun.  Food was delicious.  Outdoor seating was great.  We def. plan to go back and try the dinner menu.
2017-04-22,5,I love this place!! The brunch is the best and staff is so friendly . I go there alone and seat at the bar and i didn't feel like I was alone.
2017-04-09,4,Elysian is a gem in Hoboken. Try the salmon and churrasco. Good menu, wine list and drink menu.
2017-04-07,5,My girlfriend Laura lie was here in Manhattan and wanted to meet you up with me and drive to my little home in Nutley but I suggested that we meet in her book and since it was between Manhattan and Notley I chose this place based on the menu when we got there I really liked the old style Decour and we had Tiffany and nice made up girl service she was very sweet and pleasant and she was nice enough to charge my phone I ordered some mussels  as an appetiser and we had croque  Monsour  and my friend ordered a suit because you're with the quicheNoticed that many people sitting around us ordered the quiche and I wish I would've ordered it alsoService was very good here so I gave it a five star I will definitely return to this place the food was great the French fries everything they brought out was heart untimely the wine was great and my friend Even mentioned that I couldn't have possibly chosen a better place to eat out
2017-04-05,2,Ive only been there once, to celebrate a big event. We had the mussels marinara as an appetizer and the steak as our main course. There were a few mussels that were "off", the marinara was tasty especially with the garlic bread (which was $3.00 for two slices)  The steak was tough, even cooked medium rare. The atmosphere is lovely, I love the story behind its history. But unfortunately I was disappointed with the food experience.
2017-03-05,1,I have recommended Elysian cafe to a few people and enjoy the food and atmosphere.  However, I was very disappointed with a recent experience.  I brought my coworker here around 4:30 on a week day because I knew they had happy hour (it says it on the menu). We walked in and the place was empty so we were told to sit wherever.  We sat at a small table right next to the bar.  When the waiter came to take our oder we asked which wines were included in the happy hour (pointing to the happy hour note on the menu). The waiter told us which ones - and we each got a glass of pinot grigio.  Later when we got our check they charged us full price for the wine.  We asked because we clearly were in the happy hour time and the waiter told us that we had to sit at the bar to get the deal.  I think this was sneaky because we specifically asked the waiter what wine was included in the happy hour deal and he answered!  He should have told us then that we needed to switch to the bar - because we easily could have done it since we were the only people in the place.  We ended up just paying the bill, but this experience has made me think twice about recommending Elysian Cafe and I honestly haven't been back since.
2017-03-05,2,Great building and old school decor, too bad they hire terrible staff.  Stopped in for drinks. Bartender attitude when we walked in - not friendly at all.  Grabbed a table and man-bun douche knot waiter who thinks he's too good to be a waiter serves us drinks with more attitude.  I order a Woodford Reserve. My fault for not specifying bourbon or rye.  A different bartender pours it.  After tasting it, I walk up to bar and ask which Woodford he poured.  He says bourbon and I said "my mistake for not being specific, but could I change it to rye"?   His reply?  "Well, that costs money".   Dick move.  Then I overhear him and douche knot talking about a girl dancing and having fun. Douche knot says "she must be on heroin" referring to her dancing.  This should be a cool spot, but they need to rethink the morons that they hire.  5-star decor (and live music), 4-star drinks, 1-star service.  Yeah, I'm being generous on the service.
2017-03-03,4,This is always a go-to for us for brunch. Drink- Jalapeno margarita (So good!!)Food - Chicken sandwich, with hero mayo, bacon lettuce with a side of friesThis is sure not to disappoint. However, every once in awhile we get a bartender who does not want to make us the margs, but they do it anyway.
2017-02-27,4,Went for Sunday Brunch after searching for a spot and ordered the steak and eggs. I was not disappointed with the food at all. It came in a timely manner, was cooked exactly how I asked and was the perfect amount. In a good and easy to get to location, the place has quite a history and embraces it with an old, Victorian look as well as posters in the bathroom of performances of the past. The only thing keeping it from a full 5 star review was our waitress. While she got to us in a reasonable amount of time, she just had this attitude that she could care less about us and seemed to just be annoyed about something. Thankfully, her attitude was not enough to dampen the experience and I would absolutely recommend this place and would like to be back for dinner.
2017-02-23,5,Not only was it the best burger and fries with Blue cheese, bacon, caramelized onions and sautéed mushrooms.. My mouth is already watering!! They even have a note in the bathroom that says if you feel threatened on your date that you can go to the bartender and ask to see Angela and they will get you a cab right away!! See photo!
2017-02-06,4,Elysian is the oldest bar in Hoboken. Fun fact: they shot a memorable scene from Sleepers 1996 here. The incredible ceilings/molding and wood trimmed bar definitely bring you back in time. Unfortunately the food isn't quite as breathtaking as the ambiance. Thumbs up for the burger and fries. No thanks on the eggs benny, omelette, & croque monsieur, which honestly I could do better at home.  Attractive happy hour and friendly bartenders make Elysian a win for pre dinner and catch up drinks w friends. They also have live music, another plus!
2017-01-21,4,A few months ago I moved very close to Elysian Cafe and made a note for myself to come here as they have plenty of outdoor seating. I have checked out their menu and since I am picky and recently stopped eating meat, I realized that their brunch menu offers the most amount of options for me.I came here with my mother and brother who were visiting me, a little over a month ago. We came here around noon and although the place was pretty full, we managed to get a table right away.  The indoor space consists of two large rooms; the one at the front has a bar with tables across from it and the second room it leads into which has multiple tables. We were seated in the second room and a server came to our table almost immediately, she seemed nice and was attentive throughout our visit. I ordered the egg white omelette (spinach tomato and goat cheese) with Lyonnaise potatoes, while my mom got the Eggs Florentine (poached eggs, sauteed spinach and hollandaise) with the same side and my brother got the Elysian burger. My omelette was one of the best I have had and my mom and brother enjoyed their meals as well. I came here once again with my boyfriend, cousin her husband and their infant son a week ago. We planned on going here for brunch but by the time we got here, they stopped serving brunch and only served lunch. They were quite busy this time as well but still let my boyfriend sit at the table and hold it for the rest of us until we all managed to get there (getting a baby ready to go anywhere takes a while..) so I appreciate that.As per my previously mentioned self imposed dietary limitations, I didn't feel like I had many options and ended up going with the french onion soup and ate some of my boyfriend's Aged Cheddar Grilled Cheese (Toasted Sourdough, Minced Leeks & Onions, Pommes Frites) dish.Our server this time was understanding, considering we were a little all over the place, and was available when we needed him.I know I will be back here, especially when it is once again warm enough to sit outdoors but it will most likely only be for brunch.
2017-01-19,5,First time eating in Hoboken and Elysian was our obvious choice for lunch on the Washington Street strip. The bar kept its minimalist charm from its time as an 1800s saloon. The details in the ceiling gave you something to look at while you waited for your food, which came shortly after ordering. The food was fresh and each layer had its own outstanding flavor. For what you get in decor and atmosphere, the prices are more than reasonable. Will be returning for dinner next Hoboken visit!
2017-01-16,3,If you are willing to spend a lot for brunch this place is good. Food is tasty. Eggs perfectly poached! Omelets good. Pancakes were just blah. I was disappointed with the frequency of coffee refills. I had to keep getting waiters attention to get some coffee. And a 6 oz small fresh squeezed orange juice is five dollars. It's just ridiculously expensive.
2016-12-29,4,I've been to Elysian a few times and I really like it. The space itself is aesthetically beautiful. Nice spot to have lunch with friends, or for date night, or just to grab a cocktail. All the food and drinks I've had here have been tasty. Outdoor space is lovely when weather is warm. They're open for lunch which is great...not the case with other Hoboken spots. The last time I was there trying to kill some time and the cute bartender charged my phone for me while I drank a Bloody Mary...much appreciated!
2016-12-21,4,I love the Elysian and it's a staple when my parents come into town to visit. We especially love sitting outside with the dogs (the dogs also love to play clean up crew from below). Their Lobster Roll is awesome and their fries are really thin and crunchy....yum! Their bar area does get crowded on the weekend, but it's a really nice, classy place for a martini or glass of wine. And on a side note....the original, carved ceiling is just gorgeous!
2016-12-19,4,My friends and I were craving for creme brûlée the other night and on our quest we came across Elysian. The outside was charming as well as the inside. We were greeted by a friendly host and were seated rather quickly on a Wednesday evening. They had a pretty decent selection of desserts but of course we just wanted one thing. We all ordered our own creme brûlée and wine to pair. I chose the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. You're able to choose between a 6 oz, 8 oz, or bottle. I thought that was a lovely idea. I really enjoyed my wine in particular. That wine had such a light floral yet fruity aroma. It was crisp and had a hint of lychee. Super good! The creme brûlée was excellent. The custard was perfection. I definitely would come back to try their menu for sure.
2016-12-09,4,I love this cute little gem! Its a great place for brunch and would love to try their outdoor seating when the winter passes
2016-11-13,5,We came across Elysian cafe after we walked away from  Amandas restaurant, which by the way is over rated and has poor service and didn't know what to do with us when we walked in. Anyway - Amanda's is a dud, everyone should try Elysian cafe. They sat us the minute we stepped on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant. The weather was in the low 60s today and we sat outside. Service was on point and quick and we got our foods super fast.  I ordered the egg white omelette with goat cheese and my husband ordered the salmon eggs Benedict which he said was the best salmon eggs Benedict he ever had. The food is really good and their fries are perfection ;) we're going back next Sunday
2016-10-25,3,We like this place in the summer sitting outside when it's quiet, but it falls down a bit on busy Sundays. Despite being with a pregnant guest we were only offered a table right by the door on a cold bluster day so we got blown every time the door opened, so i had to ask for the curtain to be drawn. One of us asked for iced-tea iced-coffee, the meals were all placed at the wrong placings, and I'm sorry but for a restaurant that claims to have a French feel to serve a croque madame that was not, it was a toasted ham and cheese sandwich with an egg in the middle, disappointed this time.
2016-10-18,4,Come for brunch, lunch, dinner or just a drink. This place is smaller so there may be a wait, but it'll be worth itDrink suggestion: dirty martiniDinner suggestion: Fish and chips lobster roll and mint chip sundae
2016-10-11,5,Firstly, I live nowhere near Hoboken. I've visited the Elysian Cafe twice now. Simply put, both occasions were delightful due to responsive (but never overwhelming) service and good food/unique drinks. A calm and welcoming atmosphere can seemingly be experienced from any vantage point. Bathroom was totally clean both times. I'm not in Hoboken often at all. However, it's nice knowing that, when I find myself there, this establishment and the brief consistency in overall quality I've had the pleasure of being immersed in is reliably awaiting my patronage.
2016-10-08,4,You can't go wrong with what you get at this little french gem.  My favs: french onion soup , mussels in white sauce, Any of the chicken dishes and obviously the steak dishes. Great wine and love to sit outside here.  Best appetizer = duck poutine.  Out of this world! My husband and I love to do date night here at least twice a month. You won't be disappointed
2016-10-08,3,After a canceled flight forced us to stay another 24 hours in Hoboken, brunch at the Elysian Cafe put a smile on our faces, satisfied our tummies, and made the unanticipated layover worth the delay in returning home.I started my brunch with a Bloody Mary. Unlike a lot of places that garnish their Bloody Mary's to look like a vendor's stand at the farmer's market, the Elysian's was simple, spicy and refreshing.Egg's Benedict with Smoked Salmon and a side of potatoes was the choice of the day. Eggs were well poached with a perfectly runny yolk. Salmon was melt in your mouth tender. Hollandaise was a tad bland but adequate. Potatoes were crispy and well seasoned - except the distribution of caramelized onion was uneven from plate to plate. I didn't realize there were supposed to be onions with the potatoes until I saw them on my wife's plate. Thankfully she shared as they really added to the dish.Because my daughter lives just blocks away, I know we'll be back and I look forward to trying other items on the menu.
2016-10-08,5,I continue to be obsessed with this place especially after recently discovering their happy hour specials. On Monday-Friday, you can get half off their $7.00 wines and half off their speciality cocktails, which is a steal especially because the cocktails are delicious and strong. My friend and I had three drinks each and our bill was only 22 bucks!This has always been my go-to brunch spot but now I will be coming here even more for their awesome happy hour!
2016-09-30,4,Best spot in Hoboken in terms of decor. I've gotten the full experience and everything out of Elysian cafe - brunch, dinner, seating in the dining area and the patio. Really great spot in terms of ambiance and has that French feel to it.Brunch menu is great - $6 mimosas and eggs Benedict was made perfectly. During brunch time, it gets very crowded so coming early is your best bet.  Outside patio seating is really good, especially during the summertime. Since Elysian is uptown, you don't have all the outside noise from people and neighboring bars when you sit outside as opposed to downtown.  For Dinner I've tried the mussels, macaroni, and sandwiches.  They have dinner specials off the bar menu that are very good and I recommend coming here if you want a dinner that will leave you stuffed and full. Service during dinner can be a little better as it is slow sometimes and the tables can potentially be a little bigger inside as well.Monday is 2 for 1 night. Lowest prices item off the bar menu gets deducted. Great deal especially for the quantity and price.The bar isn't that big so getting seating is sometimes difficult even on a weeknight. However, every time I've drank at the bar, it's always been a good experience. Good draft beers, glass of wine isn't that expensive, and bartender service is good. Also, I've asked to change the channel on the TV on multiple occasions and they've always done it without any issue or fuss.
2016-09-17,4,Good food. We especially like the pulled pork and fish and chips. My husband likes the steak sandwich. Friendly, reasonable and consistently good.
2016-09-16,5,I have been there for brunch and dinner.The service was good.  I hate when places give you small glasses for water, but this place was always on top of it.  I had the steak frits and it was great.  My wife had the other steak and it was solid as well.  The Rubens were awesome.  My brothers ordered it and I tried it.  They were done so well.  I highly recommend ordering that.  The food is top notch and the service was too.  The brunch was more of the same.  Great food and good service.  The Bloody Mary wasn't that good, but that is a minor point.If you want to bring anyone from anywhere to an impressive restaurant with great food in Hoboken, this is a top choice.  No one can be disappointed by the meals this place gives out.  It is one of the top restaurants in Hoboken.
2016-09-11,4,My overall experience at the Elysian is positive. Food and drinks always met our expectations. Great outside terrace for sunny days, a bit loud inside.A long wait to get in on Sundays for brunch and a staff that could be friendlier would be the only 2 things they should improve.
2016-08-29,2,Review not for food just for service. Went yesterday looking for afternoon snack and coffee with the husband, and waiter who told us to pick a seat was just rude. He actually shook his head at us because we chose the only available two seats in the shade in 90 degree heat, because the table wasn't yet cleaned after previous customers. Left before placing order.
2016-08-22,4,Best fries in Hoboken!Delicious burger, tasty calamari salad, good drinks, and a happy hour that's a steal.
2016-08-06,3,Food is very, very good. The atmosphere is classic bougie historical bar type. However, the staff has to pick up their game. Inattentive, laid back "I know your there" attitude. They should all take smiling lessons.
2016-07-22,4,Cute cafe with a historic atmosphere. At the entrance is the bar, and seating for the restaurant is in the back. The place was well lit and overall had a very charming feel. My friend and I split a Reuben and the Roast Beef sandwich. The Reuben was DELICIOUS and jam-packed with meat.The Roast Beef was on the drier side to me, but the fries definitely made up for it. Metered street parking as usual.
2016-07-19,4,The Elysian is arguably the most beautiful restaurant in Hoboken. The molded ceilings and original wooden bar are incredible and the outdoor seating feels quaint with flowers/foliage all around.They have a good beer, wine and cocktail selection and the menu has enough variety to suit whatever you may be in the mood for. You also cannot beat the BOGO free bar menu deal on Monday nights.
2016-07-18,4,If there are half stars I'd give this place a 3.5 for the food, but I'm rounding up as I like it as a reliable local restaurant. The outdoor seatings are very nice. The staffs are friendly. Kids menu is great. Drink menus are very reasonably priced. Food is nothing fancy but solid.     Been here a few times, the steak last time was very well cooked, but I did not like the cod this time - a bit blend, the sides of it reminded me of a chicken noodle soup. The stuffed chicken breast special was quite nice though. I wish the dessert menu has more non ice cream related items but I did like the puffs. I'd come back again.
2016-07-17,1,Went to brunch today.  Not very busy.  Server came to the table and didn't say anything other than raised his eyebrows. No greeting at all.  I made the assumption he wanted my order so we ordered our brunch. I ordered eggs Benedict which came out tepid.  The potatoes which were recommend were dry and inedible.  My partner ordered a Croque Madame which turned out to be an egg sandwich also served almost cold.  The most lively part of this restaurant was the banter among the servers talking about their previous nights entertainment.  Needless to say I will never go here again.  If you're smart you'll stay away also.
2016-07-17,1,Had high hopes but very very average. We went for brunch this Saturday and it was like 100 degrees and they had no AC on and all windows were closed! The food was not horrible but that's the best I can say about it and the Bellini was terrible along with the champagne they put in it. Our brunch was very disappointing!!
2016-07-15,3,Beautiful outdoor terrace in Hoboken. I went for brunch with a group of friends, and the service and food were just ok.
2016-07-10,4,This place actually deserves 3.5 stars, I am being generous here because this is one of few places open on July4. This is such a beautiful place for brunch in Hoboken, it actually the most beautiful brunch place that I have been to. The restaurant is located at a corner on washington street in an nice& old  and is covered in flowers. As a plant lover, I really appreciate the amount of work they put in taking care of the flower plantsWe went here on July 4 and got a nice outdoor seat, atmosphere just could not get better. Food on the other hand is not so impressive, I ordered steak and egg and my friend ordered salmon eggs benedict. My steak is extremely SALTY and my friend complained about her salmon being salty as well.
2016-06-04,5,I really enjoy the Elysian. It is one of the only places I bring out-of-towners-- my mother included, who is tough to please-- because of the restaurant's consistency as an establishment. The waitstaff is always friendly, and the food is nice and always out in a timely manner. I have only had a bad experience at the Elysian perhaps once, and that was on a day when they were clearly short staffed (it was a holiday, if I remember correctly). My out-of-town friend griped, but it was really a one time thing. I suppose what I like the best about the Elysian is that I know what to expect. However, that isn't to say the dishes or atmosphere are boring alternatives to Hoboken's other places-- it is always quite lively when it should be (i.e. During a busy dinner) and quiet when it should be (i.e on a Wednesday afternoon). My mom loves the smoked salmon sandwich, my best friend swears by the tacos and the steak sandwich, and the mussels are great, too. Oh! And the French onion soup-- yum.
2016-05-31,4,Only there for a drink at the bar.  Had the usual patrons sitting at the bar reading their phones.  Would have loved to have tried some of the food, looking at the pics below it looks really tasty
2016-05-27,5,The drinks are wonderful and the French fare almost authentic. The Elysian really goes out of it's way to provide a nice ambience and French "feel" in the middle of Hoboken. Another fine date place. Outdoor dining is a lot of fun on a nice day. The bar is a cool hang and there is a friendly crowd. The only drag- the folks who insist on bringing children into a bar/restaurant and blocking the space with double wide baby carriages. Hint- this is a bar. Get a sitter.
2016-05-25,4,This place has so much charm and character, both indoors and out. The food here is also delicious! I have been here for weekend brunch and weekday lunch and both were lovely. Things that are really good: smoked salmon club, french fries, croque monseiur.One negative: they don't have iced tea? A few people tried ordering it on a hot afternoon while sitting outside and they said they didn't "have it". Seems like they could have made some?
2016-04-28,5,I've never been disappointed with this place, no matter when I come. They have a solid brunch, lunch, and dinner menu. Awesome decor inside, and nice little terrace outside for warmer weather. Best Fish & Chips in town!
2016-04-24,5,Delicious food. Always fresh.  My favorite place for breakfast or lunch. If you are coming for a weekend brunch on a nice day try to get there before 11am to avoid waiting. There is beautiful garden style seating. One of my favorite items on the brunch menu is the eggs benedict.  I get it with the French fries and a bellini. Service is always friendly and attentive.
2016-04-23,5,Best brunch spot in the area. The staff is friendly. And it's easy to become a regular. Norm at cheers anyone? Yup pretty much. The food is good. The staff is friendly. Prices are good and so are the drinks. All around fan. Only thing I would say is they need a better wine selection. Other than that we are good.
2016-04-09,1,Visited this place for brunch with a group of friends.. The place looked great and the food was good too.. But surprise.. At the end of the meal one us ordered coffee and once she added the cream to it.. 3 roaches floated to the surface. We called them and they cleared the table immediately as if nothing had happend.. Our server was unapologetic and so was the manager. Im not going back!
2016-03-22,5,My wife & I visited the Elysian Cafe for brunch and had a wonderful time. We sat at the bar because it was a long wait for a table, but that was just fine with us. I had the egg white omelet with spinach, tomatoes, and goat cheese, with pommes frites on the side. She had eggs florentine also w/ pommes frites. We both loved our meals and would definitely return the next time we're in Hoboken.
2016-03-18,3,I came here with my boyfriend for the first time. It was nice out so we sat outside, seated very quickly. Server was very nice and attentive. I ordered steak tacos and he ordered a steak. My tacos were sort of bland, no flavor on the meat itself. My boyfriend said he enjoyed the steak but has had better. We might come back to try out their other menu items.
2016-03-07,4,This is one of my favorite places in Hoboken. When it's warm it's so nice to eat outside for lunch with a coworker or friend. The food is amazing and I cannot get over the quality of their salmon! If you don't like to sit outside don't fret because the inside is so beautifully decorated and ornate you will have just as great of an experience! It is difficult to get in some times and each time I've been there my estimated wait time is severely underestimated. Overall, the wait is worth it.
2016-02-28,4,Visited the cafe for brunch with a friend for the first time. Arrived around 12:30p and the wait was about 20 minutes not bad. However this place tends to get super packed therefore I would anticipate for a wait time. They have outdoor seating as well which is perfect for warmer days.Ambience was great and they have a beautiful decor. The prices are very reasonable, mimosa was about $6 and the brunch entrees are less then $20.00. I ordered the salmon eggs benedict with fries which were excellent. My friend ordered the blueberry pancakes which were delicious. I would recommend this place for brunch. I gave it a 4 star because of the service. Our waitress was not the most pleasant and attentive and she seemed like she didnt want to be bothered. I had to look for her just to order a refill for my coffee.If your looking for good food and atmosphere in Hoboken for brunch then this is the place to check out.
2016-02-19,3,I go to Elysian at least once a week, mainly for their happy hour. From 5pm - 7pm Monday - Friday happy hour is half off all cocktails and selected wine and beer. Their cocktails are my favorite in all of Hoboken mainly because they are always STRONG. The bartenders have been there forever and aren't the friendliest, but get the job done. The most friendly bartender is Tommy, but he only works on Fridays. It's definitely not a "craft cocktail" bar, but it's better than most of your run of the mill pubs. Favorite cocktails: Car Chase and Jalapeno MargaritaMaybe one of the best things about Elysian is the decor and ambiance. The owner has done a great job restoring the traditional decor. It is unlike any other cafe/bar in Hoboken, much less any other place I have been. The patio in the spring and summer is picturesque and occupied 100% of the time. The entire experience is worth it just to get a seat on the patio during those seasons. The cafe is lit up at night with cafe lights that are help add to the charm. My only complaint about the establishment is the bathrooms. One of my biggest pet peeves is when a restaurant puts so much effort in to the aesthetic and cleanliness of the restaurant and completely gives up on the bathroom. The restroom is always unkempt and feels like a stadium bathroom. The food is mediocre, but pretty par for the course for bar food. The pommes frites are insanely good and are a weakness every time I go. There isn't anything particularly "healthy" on the menu.I would recommend: the burger - big and juicythe grilled chicken sandwich -not healthy at all, but decent flavors. the chicken is often dry, but I power through. the rosemary focaccia bread is tasty, but too bready. I usually end up dissecting the sandwich and eating the chicken individuallyFish N Chips - decent portions of fish, make sure to ask for them crispy, sometimes they can come out soggyGrilled Cheese - really good and made with sourdough breadMussels and Pommes Frites - giant portion of MusselsChicken Caesar Salad - the dressing comes with anchovies so be sure to specify if you want them or not, again the chicken is usually dry
2016-02-09,5,If you haven't had Elysian's Brunch then you are really missing out. By now I know the menu by heart but it never gets old.
2016-02-04,4,I truly enjoy this spot for brunches and late night drinks. Their food is always above average and atmosphere is always on point but may be a bit crowded for those who are unaware. The place does fill up, and rightfully so as they do a good job on all aspects of the restaurant. The price point on their brunch is certainly affordable and their $6.00 bloody marys on their brunch specials are always great. The inconsistency of the level of spicy within the bloody marys was dramatic this last Sunday afternoon. My boyfriend couldn't drink the second one he ordered. Not a big deal but just a heads up for those sensitive to a kick. The waiter was good but a little spacey in communication. For example, "what starch?" was asked to my friend when she ordered her brunch eggs. She looked at him puzzled and he didn't clear up what types were available or what he meant so I jumped in to break the silence, "uh. potatoes ok Jill? you guys have potatoes?" he nodded and walked away. No a big ordeal but one of a few conversations we had where they could of been more clear. My steak was teasty but a bit chewier than I am used too. Overall, I'll always be a fan of this place and do enjoy myself. Good job Elysian.
2016-01-25,4,Delicious Salmon benedict, an excellent choice for a weekend brunch
2016-01-20,4,Came here for brunch last weekend with my girlfriend. I love the vibe and decor inside and look forward to eating outside once the weather gets warmer. The Elysian corner truly gets some of the best sunlight in the warmer months, at any time of day.The food was between average and good, we started with a classic Caesar salad. Nice ratio of dressing to lettuce, with a few croutons and an anchovy on top. I opted for the Eggs Benedict, which was pretty good. The poach on the egg was spot on and it definitely fulfilled my craving. The frites were pretty bland in flavor. Go with the lyonnaise potatoes if you want some starch. My girlfriend ordered a Croque Madame, which couldn't have been further from a true Croque Madame if it tried. The egg was in the middle instead of on top and the whole sandwich resembled an American grilled cheese rather than a sandwich with French flair. 3 stars for food, 4 for ambiance. I look forward to coming here for dinner come spring.
2016-01-20,4,Good service and they know how to make a brunch....fresh, good presentation...in the summer sit outside with some bubbly and enjoy the parade of double wide stroller families  (annoying as hell) and the yoga pant wearing granola eating mothers... hopefully you don't sit next to a few. It's likely the only bad part of this place (not their fault) honestly keep them home... too small of a space.
2016-01-12,5,Most beautiful looking restaurant in Hoboken. If it's not very cold they have beautiful flowers always blooming. The brunch is amazing and so is the dinner. Whenever friends are visiting from out of town I always try and take them here because it truly is such a one of a kind place!
2016-01-11,4,My rating for Elysian Cafe is strictly for the outside seating during brunch.  The inside is incredibly cramped usually, but the outside seating is perfect for an enjoyable meal.  They have reasonably priced breakfast items with nice cafe style seating (I've also had lunch here as well, but it wasn't spectacular).  The service is fine, but the food and the atmosphere for brunch really make this place worth an occasional visit.
2016-01-10,5,Awesome brunch. Steak and eggs, chicken sandwich, and eggs benedict are all very good. Highly recommend.
2016-01-07,1,I ate here once and liked it a lot so I staged (work for free) in the kitchen for a job a year ago but decided not to work there when I saw how dirty the kitchen was. French fries everywhere, bugs creeping out of corners, sandwiches made with dirty bare hands after handling raw chicken. The floor looked like it hadn't been sweeped in weeks. The first thing I did was quest for a broom. Could never forget what I saw there. Was so appalled that I never returned to eat there.
2016-01-03,5,This is my go-to restaurant for brunch on weekends! They are moderately priced and the service is pretty good. The drinks are made very well and I have never had to wait for a table or a seat at the bar. This restaurant reminds me of the cafes in Paris, which makes sense since it is a French-American restaurant. Highly recommend.
2016-01-01,3,Review only for brunch:If you are looking for a place with affordable drinks in Hoboken you've found it. You can't really beat $6 for a mimosa! (If you can, call me ). The food tastes good but it's nothing out of the ordinary or anything special. They have all the brunch classics like omelets, French toast, and eggs Benedict.Some of dishes are steak are reasonably priced but other are over priced. Egg white omelet with potatoes for $11 (reasonable) but Cesar salad for $8 and adding shrimp costing another $11 (not so reasonable).
2015-12-29,5,I only come here for the lobster roll.  $22 will get you a luxurious amount of lobster meat on a perfectly toasted roll, with a sizable arugula salad & side of fries.  You will not be let down by this indulgence.  Lobster rolls in NYC will get you far less lobster with no sides at double the cost.  Treat yo'self!
2015-12-27,4,I've came here a few times for drinks in my Hoboken days because my friend is the bartender and it was a great spot for a drink to start my night. I met my dad for brunch with our girlfriends and we were very lucky because it's December and it was 60+ degrees so we got the chance to sit outside.I'm a big hot cocoa fan (my inner little kid). I loved that they give you an actual container for refills. It's a small thing, but it really made me happy.I ordered the steak and eggs with a side of crispy bacon. The steak was cooked to my liking, and the eggs were great too. I'm not even the biggest bacon fan like most, but this bacon was delicious. Crispy and worthy of ordering again.For price, atmosphere, and service, this is one of the better brunches you can get in Hoboken.
2015-12-27,1,Coffee served with cockroaches in it and everyone from Elysian behaved as if nothing happened.
2015-12-20,4,Catching up on some older visits...but from what I remember Brunch was fantastic, It was pretty simple brunch food and they don't try to be all trendy like other places in the area. I literally had one of of these trendy cafes in the area make me a grilled cheese with muenster cheese, applewood bacon on french toast ciabatta bread...c'mon "we get it, you're different"! But not this place, the food was made like it should be, classic and usual. I was drinking Margaritas like they were going out of style and they were awesome! The bartenders were very attentive but not as personable for my liking, then again, the bar was packed. The only other thing I want to comment on is the confusion of waiting...almost always a wait, one line...but you never know if that que is for a table inside, the outdoor seating or the bar itself...we usually just bypass the line and go straight to the bar...so far no one has ever said anything to us, so I don't think we are doing anything wrong or inconsiderate. Also be prepared to walk a few blocks after finally finding a parking spot....it is Hoboken after all. Very mixed clientele which is nice, and the place always seems exceptionally clean with great decor.
2015-12-15,3,I had a pretty average experince at Elysian Cafe.  Came here on a Saturday and was able to sit outside...which was nice until I waited about 15 minutes until someone helped us.  Ok.. finally ordered and got the egg white veggie omelette with home fries and friend ordered the three cheese omlette.  It was pretty basic... the home fries were kind of cold and plain and the three cheese was super tiny.  Then the waitress spilled 3 drinks on us by accident, which they comp'd our mimosas in the end so I give them a few points for that.  Needless to say I was still hungry afterwards and went straight to get somthing more substantial to eat.
2015-12-12,5,Outdoor patio on this unusually warm December day had a great ambiance and was perfect for brunch. Fresh squeezed OJ in my mimosa which was served in a regular glass as opposed to a champagne glass which I would say is a negative however I definitely got way more mimosa for my buck ($6) this way. I ordered the egg white omelette with a side of bacon. The omelette was pretty good and served with goat cheese which I love, and the bacon was thick, crispy, and to die for! The fries taste like gourmet BK fries, in a good way. Prices are fair here, will be back!
2015-11-02,4,My bf and I tried this place while walking around in the neighborhood. We sat in the front, next to the bar and the door. Waitress was really nice and friendly and the place seems to be really busy and upbeat. We ordered the mussels and the fried calamari along with drinks (draft beer). The food was good, though there was nothing really special about it. Just two typical dishes. The place itself feels vintage and cozy. I would recommend this place for a typical dinner out but I'm not sure if I would bring anyone I wanted to impress here.
2015-10-27,5,The fact that they have been around for so long is proof of their great food and service for a reasonable price. I have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and been pleasantly surprised each time.
2015-10-19,3,Went there couple months ago not sure why I didn't leave any review since then. Food was ok as far as I remember but wasn't my type. On the other hand my wife was a happier person. Didn't go back since then !
2015-10-12,5,The Elysian has the best brunch in Hoboken.  Their steak and eggs are to die for.  The outdoor patio is very pleasant, green and flowery, it has a European chic feel to it.The staff is quite nice, and the restaurant itself is a part of the community.  During Sandy they were open even though power was out and everyone ate by the candle light.  They did not price gouge either.  It was one of the more memorable dinners I had in Hoboken.
2015-09-30,5,Elysian Cafe is so warm and charming. I love the ambience. The food never fails. Dinner (steak wednesdays, hellooooo) and the brunch ($6 cocktails and eggs Benedict - enough said). Nothing short of amazing. Plus, the prices are reasonable.
2015-09-26,2,Had a terrible experience here today for brunch. The food was fine, but the service was just horrible. We sat down brunch around 2 pm, the hostess and all wait staff had the most appalling attitude and facial expressions. The hostess did not smile once while seating us and everyone else that I saw. Waiter and waitress just the same. Did some one call a staff meeting and yell at everyone??All in all the food isn't that spectacular to make up for the uncomfortable service.
2015-09-24,1,We had lunch here yesterday and it was a total accumulation of errors.First my lunch guest ordered the samon sandwich along with salad and the server only put in an order for 1/2 sandwich. Not sure why.When we asked for the other half, it did not come out right away and when we realized how long it was taking we asked the server to make the half to go since we no longer wanted it due to the time factor it took.We ordered unsweetened Iced tea and asked for a refill. The server had already put our bill on the table and pulled it back once we asked for a refill to add the request to the bill.  I am not sure if this is their policy to charge for refills, but we went along with it.   When the ice tea came back, it was sweetened and at that time we told the server to remove it from our bill to adjust the charge for the second Iced tea.  The server took the bill back.  It came back and I had a gift card in the amount of $100.00 that I was using to pay.  The bill came to $28.36 and I gave the server the gift card along with the bill and advised her she needed to remove the $2.50 charge.  She said she would take care of it.When the server came back, she had my gift card all written on with her figures on how much to write back on the gift card as my final balance. We wondered why she did write the math right on this Gift card  and not figure it out on a separate piece of paper.  The server came back and we noticed the Extra charge for the $2.50 was not taken off.  She insisted to us it was and she stood on that.  I asked her to look my orig bill before the $2.50  charge was taken off and look at the total left on my gift card   and the gift card balance showed the full amount taken off which included the iced tea we sent back.  She again insisted she took it The amount off and went back inside and came out with a slip which looked like a credit in the amount of $2.68 (I assume tax added back)  I told her that was ok, but show me on the Gift card where you gave this back to me.  She could not explain any further or did not understand so I asked for the Manager.   In a few minutes the manager showed up and we explained the situation and he understood and apologized for the issue and he would take care of it.  the manager came back and all they did was to remove the $2.50 charge and issue me a new gift card with the balance remanding.The bottom line is....bad service and a the servers understanding the requests.and getting food and drink order wrong
2015-09-20,5,Their service was top notch and the food incredible. I like that they give the option of a salad rather than fries with a sandwich. It was yummy and fresh. We ordered a burger and the croque and both were the best we've ever had.  Would go back time and time again.
2015-09-18,4,After living in uptown Hoboken for 4 months and trying all the local spots this is definitely my favorite for a nice and cozy dinner. Love the atmosphere both outside and inside and the food is definitely a notch above most of the other bar fare in Hoboken, without getting as pricey as Anthony David's or Amanda's. My husband and I have tried the salmon, steak and a few sandwiches off the bar menu. My favorite is the salmon. Lobster roll is surprising good - and that's coming from a Massachusetts girl! We have yet to try brunch here. That's up next.
2015-09-15,1,Sincerely hate to give this review, because the food is 4/5 stars.Dinner was great until we ordered a second bottle of wine as our entrees came.  We waited about 15-20 minutes, and someone in my party tried to flag the waitress a couple times.  When we get her attention, word for word, she just snaps "I HEARD you.  They had to go to Amanda's to get the wine, just give it a few minutes."  Storms off. I guess they had run out of the wine we requested.  It seems like a reasonable person would have asked if we preferred a different bottle, and explained they had to go off campus for a different bottle, which would have been fine.  We picked that wine randomly anyway.She came back to the table 2-3 more times.  The first two times she did not say one word; she brings the wine, throws the glasses on the table, has us taste it, and leaves, all without a word. She then tried to be friendly when bringing us our dessert menus, but the damage was done.  The best part was when another waitress brought us our desserts and explained our previous waitress had left.  She probably knew she wasn't getting a great tip and cut her losses.  Keep in mind we had ordered 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and two bottles of wine, so her tip would have been substantial at our standard 25%.We paid the bill and I decided to run our experience by the manager, young guy, curly hair. I explained we had already paid and didn't want a discount, we just wanted to make him aware of the waitresses behavior. He basically said "I told her to go get the wine from Amanda's, guess she was having a bad day. Sorry."  And that was about it.  About as socially aware as the waitress.Sincerely one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had at a restaurant.  We won't be back.  Go a half block away, grab a bottle of wine, and spend your money at Anthony David's.
2015-08-23,5,One of my favorite places to eat. I've lived in Montclair my entire life and grew up with an elite taste of food. I've recently moved to Hoboken and ate at the Elysian and it was just as good quality as any restaurant in Montclair or NYC. For those Montclair-ites it will be my new Raymond's.
2015-08-21,3,It was ok.  Nice egg, nice Bloody Mary, nice day outside.  I was alittle hungry when I left but hey, it's not a diner.   Good service, the waiter was nice and kept coming over with water.
2015-08-20,2,Food was okay, service was okay - overall just an okay experience. Would be willing to try brunch there when I'm in the area
2015-08-15,5,Consistently amazing food. Been here a dozen times or so. Get the garlic fries with truffle oil and the skirt steak for happiness!
2015-08-15,5,5 star brunch. I've brunched all over Hoboken and this has to be my favorite. Food was delicious, service was prompt. Great value, good atmosphere. Eggs florentine was amazing.
2015-08-05,3,Unfortunately, this place has become mediocre at best. The decor and ambiance is very charming  and the service is good however, neither can mask the underwhelming taste buds experience. I've been here for brunch and dinner a few times and have never left impressed. Most recently for brunch, I had the egg white omelette with potatoes. The potatoes were roasted without salt and pepper thus, very very bland and the omelette was also missing basic seasonings. This has happened one too many times for me so it'll be a while before I come back.
2015-07-30,4,Service was excellent. Chicken Caesar salad was ok - dressing was tasty but the chicken seemed reheated.  French fries and croque Monsieur was great! Lovely little restaurant. Would definitely try brunch here as I hear it's wonderful.
2015-07-20,5,Just the place we were looking for that day for brunch. Good food, outdoor seating, and good service. This was a nice choice. Has a European cafe feel and it was pleasant enjoying beautiful weather outside while having a tasty meal.
2015-07-20,5,With Anthony David's being as great as it is, Its easy to forget about Elysian. The grilled chicken sandwich is amazing.
2015-07-19,2,My fiance and I love this place-even took our engagement pictures here.  The staff and previous manager have always been great and this was THE spot we loved to take out of town guests.  I brought my bridal party here for a Friday afternoon casual lunch and was told that seating would be at least 20 minutes to our group size.  We decided to wait in the shade off to the corner on the side of the outdoor seating area-the new manager quickly came over to us and said if we went any further from hearing distance our name would be dropped from the list and we would need to re-put our names back on the list and wait again.  After waiting for 30 minutes and seeing every other party not need to wait for a table- I went inside to speak to the manager and was shocked to see so many empty tables! The place inside was half full! She finally came up to speak with me from downstairs and told us it would still be a wait.  Finally we were seated-the food was great and the service from the waitress was also great.  I've read other reviews and it looks like this is a continuing problem here-Mr. Flinn please fix!!
2015-07-19,1,Overall, the food was good and the service was fine. Would totally have gone back and gave it 3-4 stars.  However, while sitting outside I noticed a fly in my beer I was drinking. I told the server and he got me a new beer. When the check came the beer that had the fly on it was on the check. I thought it was a mistake but he said it was not but he would get the manager. I have been to plenty of outdoor bars and I would always get a comp beer if a fly was in it. The manager came as was extremely rude. He told me that I was sitting in nature and that he could not control if a fly went into my beer. The way he talked down to me was unacceptable. he could have much better explained the situation instead of just telling me that "it is nature".  As a result I will never go back to the restaurant not because they would not comp me the beer but rather, the rudeness of the manager.
2015-07-19,5,Came here for a work function - and everything on the menu looked spot on. I want to come back and try all the entree items, all of them looked so good. The portions were perfect. I tried the Flank steak with Risotto, and it hit the spot real well. I want to go back for the Lobster Roll and maybe the pasta with the "Sunday Sauce".This place has a fully stocked bar with a wide selection. I was able to get some kind of grapefruit summer shandy which was great. The service was really good too. Would definitely recommend to others and go back.
2015-07-13,2,Good food, not a very fun staff to be around. I ordered a Sprite and it was watered down so I sent it back and asked for a coke but I had to remind the waitress after 20 minutes to get the coke. Overall good food, bad staff.
2015-07-12,4,Service was good. Had trouble with the seating when we came in. One of the hosts was so preoccupied with a customer requesting seating that everyone else was overlooked while waiting for a table. Luckily the other hostess managed to seat us. It was definitely crowded but the ambiance was nice and he deride from our waiter was very pleasant.I ordered the smoked salmon club and my girlfriend had the BLT. I was surprised at how great the BLT was. The smoked salmon club was good but the ratio of sauce and greens to the salmon was a little off. The sandwich seemed more like just a straight smoked salmon sandwich. The sauce was faint and the texture was more soft than anything else. we also had a dessert, the double fudge sundae which was chocolate bread pudding with ice cream whipped cream and warm chocolate syrup (really tasty for chocolate lovers).I would definitely come back tho regardless because the other menu items looked really good and I enjoyed my meal overall. Just remember the BLT is reaaaaaallly good.
2015-07-12,5,We stopped here randomly while visiting for a day. The decor was from another era - very 1930's France with marvelous ceilings and light cascading in from the windows. We had excellent French Onion soup, very decident Mac and cheese and some of the best corned beef hash I've ever had on a Ruben. Would highly recommend. Good outdoor seating, too.
2015-07-12,5,Amazing!!!!! Delicious!!!! Great service!!! Highly recommend it for brunch with the family!
2015-07-06,4,Elysian truly looks like a French cafe, with it's open air seating. My BF and I had walked by constantly, and decided to go on a particularly beautiful night when we were able to go and eat outside. Such a cute place for a date, or brunch/dinner out with some friends - particularly if you can grab an outdoor seat. Our first trip there was for dinner, and thanks to making a reservation, we were seated almost instantly. The service was great from the get go, the wine was poured generously (and brought out quickly), and the garlic fries are the ultimate. The menu is varied without being overly extensive - some French dishes mixed in with American. Playing into that type of menu, my boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites, while I settled on the lobster roll (because we were coming back from a Maine trip and I couldn't get enough). The oyster selection also looked delish, so that will have to be reserved for another trip! After hearing from a girlfriend that the brunch at Elysian is perfection, we headed there one weekend for a Saturday brunch. She wasn't lying - brunch was incredible. Again, our server was lovely, and though it was busy, she made sure we were taken care of. The screwdrivers were strong, the steel cut oatmeal delicious (seriously, it CAN be fucked up so don't laugh), and BF got the gateaux chauds (pancakes), which looked incredible and apparently were since he gobbled them up. I also ordered a side of the Lyonnaise potatoes, which spoiler - are home fries (really, really good ones). It was a perfect brunch with an amazing atmosphere, and the perfect view for people watching (insider hint: bring sunglasses to fully take advantage of this opportunity). Prices are also REALLY reasonable for brunch, so extra worthwhile. Great service, great prices, beautiful location, and amazing atmosphere on a whole. Definitely worth a brunch trip or dinner trip for some delicious food and a few drinks.
2015-07-02,5,Coming here for years. Perfect neighborhood bistro gets it right every... single...time. Consistently delicious and service is always gracious. Lunch menu will restore your faith in sandwiches. Even the grilled cheese is special (I think they put bits of leek in the cheese). I like to get mine with an upgraded salad of frisée, bacon and goat cheese. Do not miss their Reuben or grilled chicken sandwich. Sounds simple but their versions are the gold standard.Dinner is equally consistent but no pics. I always eat before I get a chance to take a picture.
2015-07-02,4,Mondays are buy one get one off the bar menu which is a sweet deal! But, I decided on going for the braised short ribs, which was delicious!! We started off with the garlic Parmesan truffle fries and cheese plate. The fries were really good. Crispy and flavorful. But, the cheese plate could of used a better presentation to make it more pleasing to the eyes. It wasn't bad, but, I would skip it next time. For dessert, we had creme brûlée which I definitely recommend. Service was great! One star off because we had a party of 7 with reservations, but, still had to wait 20 minutes for the table to clear.
2015-06-29,5,I had a meeting in an office nearby. I was really early and hadn't had a chance to stop for lunch. I haven't really been around this area in Hoboken and was afraid I wasn't going to find a place to eat something good, hearty and reasonably priced. To my surprise, they had a great menu serving all variety of options and from different prices. I chose the Salmon Club and loved it with their side salad! Would love to come back soon!!
2015-06-25,5,Just finished having an OUTSTANDING meal! Our server, Jack, was friendly, attentive and unobtrusive.The entire meal was stellar from start to finish. We ordered: The cheese plate, the French onion soup, Steak Au Pouvre, Pan Seared Salmon, as well as the pan seared cod special and the bleu cheese & balsamic vinaigrette truffled burger special. We finished with the creme brûlée and the white chocolate & Oreo cheesecake.I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Hoboken. Definitely warrants a return visit!
2015-06-09,4,Cute little spot with outdoor seating that is perfect in the summer. Well priced wine list with a few great rose options. Enjoyed the short rib entree. Would definitely return.
2015-06-09,3,The food is 3 stars but the experience is at least four stars if you can get an outdoor table, especially on a sunny day. The brunch and lunch food is mainly standard fare done well enough. The beer selection is good too. In a city of brunch spots, Elysian doesn't stand out. If only Yelp allowed 3.5 stars.
2015-06-06,4,Come here for lunch frequently and love the grilled chicken sandwich with side salad. Have never ordered anything different so can't comment on that. Service is usually pretty good and like the decor. Being able to sit outside on nice days is also a major plus. Look forward to coming back again for yet another chicken......yes, i am boring.....but content.
2015-05-27,2,Lived in Hoboken for 10 years and finally tried out this place but was somewhat disappointed. Lobster roll was mediocre, not so fresh and seemed like it was a day old, felt sick with a small case of food poisoning that evening. Husband had the steak frites, found it unremarkable. I will say though the Malbec was nice and the fries were good (it's kinda like McDonald's if you like that) The wait staff was very courteous and accommodating. I just wish the food was better. Also the seating area doors seemed pleasant at first but the seats were wobbly and rusty, our table needed a leveling because it was falling over.
2015-05-22,1,I went into Elysian Cafe today for lunch with four of my coworkers. We had never been here before so we decided to try it out . We were initially greeted at the bar by the bartender who threw out menus at us like if we were a bother to him for sitting at the bar . After ordering one of my favorites Stella Cider I continued to order my lunch. The bartender looked at us terribly with an attitude that I could not describe . I didn't understand what the problem was . I didn't want to stay there but our lunch break was beggining to cut short . My check came out to 14 dollars . I usually leave 20% or higher. I left him 5 dollars and left . He didn't deserve a tip at all after the way he treated us. I will never come to this establishment ever again.  Please find more personable servers and bartenders .
2015-05-20,4,Salmon eggs Benedict was delicious and filling. Would do brunch again!!!
2015-05-15,4,Ate here for lunch on a Friday after weeks of passing the place. I wish I'd stopped by sooner!Attentive, if a little impersonal, service, but the food was on point. I had the grilled chicken sandwich with field greens, which was surprisingly (but pleasantly) light -- the salad dressing was more olive oil than balsamic (which I prefer), and the herb mayo on the sandwich wasn't heavy (i.e., fatty) in the slightest. Even the bacon was nice and thin (but delicious).Great little spot on Washington. Can't speak for dinner service, but it's a nice midday meal spot.
2015-05-11,5,Review is for lunch only and during off hours. I've been here twice for a late lunch with my mother in law and really enjoyed our food both times. We sat outside and service was great. Granted they weren't crowded as it was 2pm lunch on a Monday. Service was attentive. They brought water out right away for our pup. We split the BLT and grilled cheese. Both were awesome. Thick cut bacon with yummy roasted tomatoes and avocado. Came with a large side salad. Fries were cold but they brought out hot ones. Dog friendly inside the patio. Most places have you keep the dog on the sidewalk. I will keep going back as both sandwiches were really good. Honestly, it's more like 4.5 stars but I will round up. Prices seemed reasonable--sandos were big as were the sides.
2015-04-29,5,MUST GO PLACE...  My family love love love this place.  Love the the historical decor, the service, atmosphere and the food is DELICIOUS.  Love eating inside and outside on a spring morning.  Great place to have mimosas with the girls for brunch.
2015-04-26,2,This place has good food and good beers, but after the (lack of) service we had yesterday on the patio I don't think I'll be back for a while. Had two beers and wanted to order food but the server never came back. Left cash for the beers and dipped out to get food elsewhere. Bottom line: there's not a huge selection in Hobo, but for springtime sun, you may have better luck elsewhere.
2015-04-12,1,Went here for Sunday brunch with my girlfriend. It took a long time to get our order taken. I got the Croque Madame and she got Steak and Eggs. We waited about 30 minutes for our food to come out, and when it did, it was room temp. My sandwich could have been thrown together in a college dorm room, there was really nothing interesting or delicious about it. The french fries were literally MacDonald's fries, maybe even a little worse. My girlfriend's steak was tiny and well-done, even though she asked for it to be cooked medium. The potatoes that came with her meal were soggy and room temp, and there was only a small pile of them on her plate. We were still hungry when we left. Brass Rail is way better, we will not be back.
2015-03-24,3,So we've been a few times and I'm not entirely sure what the hype is about. It's really just kind of average. The location is great, the place is beautiful inside and out but the food is just kinda OK.I've been for brunch and dinner, I will say that I thought the dinner was better. The brunch is really average. I've tried a bunch of things here and really just ok. I The fries are kind of boring and bland and I've had the omelette and it was just that, a regular old omelet. It was no different than an omelet from a diner in my opinion. I think the atmosphere here is what brings a lot of people in. The service is always pretty good. I think the brunch is a bit overpriced for what you get. I would much rather go to Anthony David's.For dinner we ordered only from the bar menu and not the main entree menu so I can't comment on that. But I felt that it was just average. We had to sit close to the door because this place gets slammed so it was cramped and cold. That may have had something to do with just wanting to eat and get out. It's one of the busier spots uptown. The bar is always full and almost impossible to get a seat there as I feel there are a lot of regulars who sit there awhile. It's not worth the wait, there are many other places around if you don't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a brunch table. Honestly, not my first choice for brunch at all, or dinner. I feel it's just way to expensive for the quality of the food. And just average at best. Not saying I won't be back, but only if there is no wait.
2015-02-28,4,While you wont get anything new and exciting at Elysian, the food is consistent and well priced. I have been here many times and would go back anytime.
2015-02-24,4,Came here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend on a friday night.  we didnt have a reservation and we were able to be seated within 5 minutes.  It was packed, and now i  know why! The muscles were fantastic and My bofriend loved his salmon.  The bruschetta pizza wasnt to brag about but now i know what to order there. My bloody mary hit the spot too! Every friday there is a live band and i have to say the guy we saw was great! definitely sit in the dining area, great lighting and vibe.
2015-02-15,1,Ive never written a review for food before but i felt compelled to come on here for the good of humanity. i mistakenly reserved a spot on valentines day (mind you, i knew the fixed course menus anywhere on valentines day would be subpar, but i figure, how bad could it be?) well, let me tell you friends. for an absolutely absurd price, you can get 5 fried oysters in spicy mayo, 4 small slices of skirt steak, and 2 cold crepes. id also like to emphasize that ive donated to soup kitchens before and ive tried their food. the meal was on par with 2 of them and im pretty sure the one in new haven had far better food than elysian. it was crystal clear the ownership was trying to wring every penny out of this holiday and i was just a sucker along for the ride. do yourself a favor and dont make the same mistakes i did. everytime i pass by, i will salute to the day i had the worst meal ive ever had in my adult life. thank you elysian for teaching me that lesson. you wont take another dime of my money.
2015-02-13,5,This is, hands down, our favorite place in town. Delicious food, friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere. Great seafood, delish steak frites. The owners have two other nifty places in town too: Amanda's, for fancier occasions, and Schnackenberg's luncheonette for breakfast and lunch. The doughnuts at Schnackenberg's  are out of this world, and go there also to see the awesome mosaic made of tourist plates.
2015-02-09,3,If you're looking for an incredibly cute place for lunch, this is it. In the summer they have a charming outdoor space almost like a garden with little tables and chairs.  The inside of the restaurant is a bistro ambiance. Food wise their grilled cheese is good but not the best I've had (a bit bland), my friend had a Reuben which she didn't love (too fatty and chewy!). I did have one of the best omelets I've ever had here (yes I know how can an omelet be that special!) it had a medley of wild mushrooms in it as well as some spinach and a LOT of goat cheese!!! Their bellinis and prosecco are pretty great as well! Never been here for dinner but in terms of lunch, come here for the ambiance more than the food especially in the summer or spring time where you can sit outside!
2015-02-08,3,Came here for a mid-week dinner and enjoyed a good dinner.  We ordered the skirt steak and the roast beef sandwich.  The skirt steak was a little on the chewy side but the risotto was very good.  The roast beef sandwich was full of flavor so nothing to complain about there.  To be honest, both dishes were even better as leftovers the next day!Is Elysian spectacular... no.. but will you be able to get a good meal here every time.. yes.Check this place out if you haven't already.
2015-02-07,3,Finally made it to this beautiful and historic renovated venue! Beautiful ceilings and old school decor. Warm and kind service.  Food was just ok.  Came for brunch and got the steak which was good, eggs ok, nothing special. Home fries also very good but not superlative. Coffee pretty subpar and weak. Mimosa soso, also weak. Donuts were excellent, I would guess from Schnackenberg's.  would not go back as prefer other brunch spots in area.
2015-01-27,3,My wife and two young boys came here for dinner on the snow day of the great non-blizzard of 2015. We met up with our friends who also have two boys. I was pleased with their draft beer list, which included Żywiec, a Polish lager that's not easy to find in Hoboken. I got the Steak Au Poivre cooked rare. I thought it was cooked a little more than rare but that's okay. The meat wasn't a great piece of meat because it had more gristle than I'd like but I didn't want to make a fuss. The sauce was really tasty. The wife got the braised short ribs which I enjoyed more than my own dish. But again, I've had better short ribs. They weren't as juicy/moist as some of the better short ribs I've had but maybe I'm just not familiar with a French-style braised short rib. They had a few options for the kid's meals which was nice. My boys ended up getting chicken fingers and fries, which they seemed to enjoy.The one thing I really had an issue with was the audacity of the people without kids to show up on Tuesday night, which everyone in Hoboken knows is kids eat free night at Elysian Cafe. You sit there with your overpriced mixed cocktail with your date, trying to make the best of the crappy situation. Dude, you failed at doing your research on a romantic date spot. Look, there are plenty of other places in Hoboken, even just a few blocks from Elysian Cafe, that are better date places: Stingray Lounge, Bin 14, Anthony David's, etc. You deserve to get dumped for taking your date to Elysian Cafe on kids eat free night. I'm not sure I'd come back here for dinner. For the price, I think the quality isn't great. Maybe it's a better value for brunch? I'd rather just go to Anthony David's if I'm going to pay this much. Also Anthony David's is BYOB so I'd save on the alcohol markup. I'm thankful that a place like Elysian that is kid-friendly exists but that still isn't an excuse for mediocre quality food.
2015-01-09,4,Decided to try their brunch and we enjoyed it very much. My husband had the french toast which he loved and I had eggs benedict without the bread. It was a lovely summer morning, sat outside, customer service was good. Would come back again for brunch!
2015-01-04,5,Amazing brunch...the Bloody Mary's are out of this world (if you like it spicy ) and the bacon is the best I've ever had...no joke.....
2014-12-28,5,Best brunch in hoboken. Who ever is in the kitchen has a talent for perfectly cooked bacon. The menu is simple but the food is top notch. Hot chocolate is quite literally a vat of melted chocolate.
2014-12-07,5,An awesome place to have dessert and an after dinner drink. Upscale decor with a casual vibe. They have live music on Friday and Saturday and a TV at the bar. There wasn't anything I didn't like about this place, though the bartenders in t-shirts kind of stood out from their environment. Definetely will be back.
2014-11-29,5,This place has excellent food and the best ambiance of any bistro in Hoboken. My girlfriend and I love it. The staff has always been helpful and courteous, and the menu is very reasonably priced. Highly recommend it.
2014-11-17,4,Had a reservation for six people on a Saturday. The hostess called me to confirm that at 3pm the brunch had ended and the only menu available would be the bar menu. The food choices were still excellent! Everyone enjoyed their food (salmon and cream cheese sandwhich, grilled chicken sandwhich, fish and chips...) and Dad was even happy because they had Coors Banquet (thank goodness!). Drink selection is very good as well. The restaurant is perfect for brunch or lunch with friends or family. The history and decor of the place adds something special. Will definitely be back.
2014-11-13,5,I can't say enough about how much I enjoy meals and drinks at the Elysian. The food is always on point, in that it's delicious and it's consistently good. The Monday 2 for 1 special can not be beat. Buy one item from the bar menu get the 2nd FREE. They also have a great steak dinner deal Wednesdays for $20. I love the bar, brunch etc. All of the staff is friendly and accommodating and all in all, I love the Elysian.
2014-11-05,4,This is my go-to for lunch! The menu is simple and everything on it is prepared perfectly. The bread they use for their avocado blt really makes this a hit. Their french fries are the best in town. They do a smoked salmon club that is to die for and the french onion soup is great. The service is consistently good. Two thumbs up across the board.
2014-11-03,1,Well this was my 4th visit to Elysian, and my 1st review, I felt compelled to write, not to bash these guys, but more to give them a heads up. For months, I've been hearing from friends about Elysian's "AWESOME" burgers, I have had some nice meals in the past at Elysian, so my GF and I decided to cash in on Hoboken's ultimate burger. It was a fairly crowed Sunday afternoon, we sat right down, and ordered our meal, two cheese burgers please! Our burgers arrived in a timely manner, but both our burger buns were stale, and crumbly, and our frites? Limp and cold, I asked for another iced tea, it came without ice. I would have normally complained, if I weren't for a decent pickle, I don't think it fair to dismiss a restaurant when you've had some good meals in the past, but It was such a let down, I don't think I will be returning anytime soon, at least not for a burger.
2014-11-02,2,The food was okay and the location was great. I like the ambiance. However, the service was poor. We wanted to order drinks at the bar while we wait for our table and took a couple of minutes before we got the drinks menu. The mimosa I ordered was not even in a champagne glass!!!! The waiter was not friendly, he barely said anything other than what we wanted, never recommended anything on the menu and he seemed really disconnected!!! If I had a great service a 5 star would have been appropriate.
2014-10-19,1,I was excited to take my family here, but unfortunately, we had a really disappointing experience at the Elysian Cafe last night.Knowing it can get crowded on the weekends, we had walked in the night before to make reservations. The hostess wrote my name, time of reservations, and group number down on her pad of paper.On Saturday, we show up prior to our 7pm reservations. I approach the hostess and tell her we have reservations for five at 7pm. She immediately tells me they do not take reservations for fewer than six on Saturday nights. I explained to her I had not been informed of that policy and the hostess the night before had told us we were good to go. She tells me to wait and goes inside to get her manager. A couple minutes later, the manager walks out to speak with me explaining that they do not have record of me in their system and again, that they don't make reservations for less than six people. Rather than being apologetic or accommodating for the error, he continued to make excuses and push the blame onto me (and his hostess from the night before) for their mistake.  Not yet wanting to give up, I asked how long the wait was. He informed me there was no wait for the outside (it was getting chilly out), but a thirty minute wait for the inside because they "had reservations." Apparently the reservation I made the night before was not worth honoring or acknowledging. Annoyed with the lack of customer service and the manager's smugness, we decided to not give them our business.I can thank them though. We went elsewhere in Hoboken and had a lovely meal without the pretentiousness of the Elysian Cafe. I will probably never go back.
2014-10-17,4,I'd give Elysian Cafe 3.5 stars, but I rouneded up. Was in the neighborhood on a Sunday and we decided to drop by for late brunch. I had the Salmon Eggs Benedict + Pommes Frites which was average and on the bland side ... I had better.  I love poached eggs, but the ones that day was tad undercooked and too watery for me... the only part solid enough to eat was actually parts of the egg white. I had also ordered cappuccino which was pretty good as well as the pumpkin ale ... I know I know, odd combination - don't judge. I just needed caffeine to start my day and it was at a decent time in the afternoon to start drinking beer. Service was quick and staff were friendly. However, the waiter who was in charge of our area seemed to rush patrons even though it was later in the day and the restaurant was already clearing out. This place has nice outdoor seatings for those warm sunny days... the seating area inside by the window is pretty tight though. Overall it is a decent spot in Hoboken for brunch.
2014-10-13,4,I have eaten at Elysian for both dinner and brunch and while both are good, brunch is not to be missed. Life changing french toast, strong bloody marys and a well made cappuccino. Monday nights are also a good option for their buy one get one free bar menu special.
2014-09-30,4,I rated the restaurant/cage as 4 stars for the absolute amazing service to a family with a 2 yr toddler. It is so difficult to find family friendly restaurants/bars and the Elysian Café staff went above and beyond to make us comfortable and to serve us. At a certain point our food and drinks were spread over 3 tables in the bar area to the keep our toddler busy and the staff continue to help and support us. The food was good but nothing special. The beer selection was nice and enjoyed it. The décor of the place is very cool.
2014-09-24,5,very cute place, easy to spend sometime chatting with a friend and food is one of the best in Hoboken. My fav in the area
2014-09-18,4,Elysian is one of those "go-to" neighborhood spots.  Its easy and convenient and the food is good to very good most of the time.  The bartenders in particular are very good especially Tommy.  The outdoor seating is great.Stand out items include the calamari salad, cod with basil risotto, and fish tacos.  Brunch is just Ok but pretty cheap compared to other Hoboken spots so bonus there.
2014-09-16,4,Great brunch or dinner spot.  Sit outside if weather permits, nice corner location and garden-like feel.  Food is what you would expect at a decent bistro, it's good, not great.  Prices are ok overall.  The back room has some cool character and history.Avoid the bar area for dinner as it gets quite crowded and cramped at those tables.
2014-09-09,4,Great place to grab brunch on the weekend. its crowded, noise level is high, tables are cramped together to make space for as many people as possible.. but hey - all you need on the weekend is a good serving of eggs and coffee.. they do a great job at it. their burger is pretty good as well. so give it a try - you wont be disappointed.
2014-09-08,4,Stopped in for lunch at the Elysian. A wee bit muggy outside, we sat inside the velvet curtains within the reach of the a/c. Our waitress was pleasant, attentive, and quick to get us water and our drinks. I got the BLT, my friend, the grilled cheese. Half of either would have been more than enough. The bacon must have been 1/4" thick when they put it in the pan, it was easily 3/16" per slice and there must have been at least six slices piled on the BLT. I could only eat half. All in all a fine little old school bar/restaurant, I'd be interested in coming back for the live music I heard they have on weekends.
2014-09-02,4,This is a rock solid restaurant.  Frankly, Hoboken could use a few more just like it. By way of background, I had been to Elysian on several occasions for brunch and, while it was good, it never left a lasting impression.  This 4-star review is for their dinner service.  We started with the mussels in white wine and also shared a bruschetta pizza.  Both were on-point and are highly recommended.  For my main, I had the sliced steak sandwich which I absolutely loved.  I also tried a few bites of cod which was cooked to perfection and very enjoyable.  I liked everything about my experience, from the food, to my martini to the service (attentive without being intrusive).  Overall, it is the perfect place to go when you are looking for a great meal without the pretension or high prices you might expect for food of this quality.
2014-08-31,5,I really loved it here! They are dog friendly and have delicious French fries. I tried my bff's Mac and cheese and it was really tasty. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and it was huge. I enjoyed it and the thick cut slab bacon was a huge plus. I will definitely be back!
2014-08-30,4,Nicest staff in town, great ambiance, delicious food, reasonable wine list. Always a pleasure.
2014-08-28,2,Nice atmosphere, though a bit too crowded and close for my comfort.  The menu on a Saturday morning was only brunch -- and fairly limited.  My omelet was okay -- nothing special.  The spinach it came with was also okay, though a bit salty.  If you're up for brunch it's certainly okay -- but I would not make a special trip -- except maybe to view the copious old photos on the wall.
2014-08-24,1,Went today had the Lobster roll. It tasted and smelled fishy.  It had lettuce and tomato I thought that was strange. Also the bread was not toasted nor did it have mayo.  It was so bad I could not eat it after just 2 bites. The arugula and fries it came with was good. Had creme brûlée the shell was perfect, unfortunately the creme part was eggy.  Safely I would not go back.
2014-08-24,4,Always a solid choice for an uptown brunch or lunch. The place is modeled after a French bistro, but with the old world charm if early 1900s Hoboken. The food is solid, and the only real complaint is outside they pack the tables super, super close. Either way, it's part of my regular rotation.
2014-08-22,2,I came with my wife and son for brunch..wait was about fifteen minutes..not bad..it was packed..waited for an hour for our food..my steak on my steak and eggs were overcooked..i expected more from this restaurant...smh
2014-08-19,5,Since I have been coming to Hoboken I've passed the Elysian countless times and always thought "that place looks really cool, I want to try it sometime."  The location is up town and for the better part of my twenties I spent drowning in bud light and cheap whisky down town with the rest of the Goobahs, only now upon moving uptown have been able to sample the thing that has alluded me for so long.  The outdoor space is what they are known for and we were greeted warmly and told we could sit wherever we liked.  It was lunch time, we opted for outside and were pleasantly surprised by the menu.  Plenty of different options to choose from, but I would recommend the half and half.  It's a half sandwich and soup or salad.  I was concerned the portion might be too small but it was very satisfying.  The smoked salmon club was delicious and was filled to capacity with fresh fish.  Craft cocktails are always a plus in my book and they were well balanced and tasty.  Service was friendly and polite and the food was served hot and promptly.  This place fills up FAST, so perhaps a call head is worth it just to make sure they have tables available.  Took me a while to get here but I'll for sure be back.
2014-08-12,4,This review is 3.5 stars but I bumped it up because of the awesome decor and service. Walking into this place you feel almost as if you're traveling back into the victorian era; the decor of this cafe is simply splendid and extremely detailed. At Elysian cafe you can choose to sit either outside, by the bar, at the tables alongside the bar, or in the sectioned off back room. My boyfriend and I chose to sit at one of the tables by the bar simply because it was too sunny and humid outside. MY boyfriend ordered off the lunch menu and got half the smoked salmon sandwich and a cup of the tomato vegetable soup. I chose to try out the fish 'n' chips. My boyfriend's food arrived first and then mine, or what was supposed to be mine. I was delivered fish tacos incorrectly, but I let my server know and ten minutes later I received the correct order. This was a bit off putting because by the time I had received my food, my boyfriend was halfway through with his food. My boyfriend's salmon looked and tasted incredibly fresh, with the tomato vegetable soup being the perfect complimentary soup. My fish 'n' chips on the other hand, was literally half good. By this I mean, only one of the two pieces of the breaded and deep fried was good. The other piece had way too much breading that once the fish cooled down, the fish completely separated from the fried part.  I was upset with the inconsistency of the dish and a bit agitated that I had to wait for such an inconsistent dish. If you do decide to come to this cafe, I would suggest you stray from the fish 'n' chips-- not worth the gamble. Tip: the root beer is delicious!
2014-08-10,4,I absolutely love love love the bar menu here. Cute old fashioned french bistro feel to the interior and lots of outdoor seating. Their cocktails are strong and definitely worth the splurge. Everything on the bar menu is fairly priced and their french fries remind me of gourmet mcdonald's fries (in the best way possible, thin and extra salty). I got the pulled pork sandwich as usual and it was so overflowing i had to eat it with a fork! Love their coleslaw too. Their wait staff was very polite and quick with the orders, i will be coming back!
2014-08-10,4,Went prime time 2oclock on a Sunday 4 adults 1 child. (They are child friendly). There was a crowd gathered out front of maybe 8-10ppl but we were seated right away.  Outdoor seating, the inside seemed to have a little wait The outdoor cafe is beautiful we were seated under a magnificent tree and had plenty of shade. The brunch menu had something for everybody from lobster rolls and burgers to French Toast and different egg platters.  I got the chicken Caesar salad and was very impressed. Also picked at the fries I shared with my daughter. .so good soo good.The brunch drink options were very cheap, I got a screwdriver for less than 6$.Food came fast,  service with a smile and oh so tasty. Highly recommended I will be back!
2014-08-09,3,I came here on a Sunday for brunch and waited about 40 minutes to be seated. It's a lovely brunch experience if you sit outside. This place is cute and has flowers and green umbrellas adorning the outside dining area. I ordered steak and eggs (will done) & though the steak was ok, the eggs were practically raw to the point where I sent them back. They came back & still weren't well done. Not cool. The mimosas were pretty good but above average. The service was mediocre.
2014-08-08,4,Starting to love Elysian again... "Old reliable."  Always a good meal inside at the bar or out on the patio. Good stuff for brunch, lunch, or dinner. And a great place to stop by for a drink from a friendly bartender. Try the Steak salad, salmon, lobster roll, fried calamari, grilled cheese, BLT + fried egg... So yeah, everything.
2014-08-06,2,BORING, BORING, BORING.Does this restauranteur have any idea of the meaning of a season?  Or even a special?  The food is adequate - nothing to write home about.  But is is always exactly the same.  In a town with amazing bread, why don't they serve it???Nice atmosphere and pretty to sit outside but I am soooooo sick of the same exact menu month after month, year after year.  Total and complete lack of innovation or creativity.  I guess this is why Hoboken has a rep for lowest common denominator cuisine.
2014-07-31,5,I went over the summer and sat outdoors, which was wonderful! The table and chairs remind me of a quaint Parisian restaurant. The food was great (I had the crêpe du jour, which was short ribs and gruyere, and it tasted fabulous) and the service was very good as well! Definitely recommend.
2014-07-27,5,It looked as though this place was going to be crazy getting into, but I got a seat in less than a minute. Great atmosphere, music, staff, and food!
2014-07-24,5,Great bartenders casual yet from atmosphere excellent food. And live music on Friday and Saturday evenings. You can't lose!
2014-07-21,4,Great food!!!! a little pricey, but worth it - good service also...had mussels and fish and chips...will be back
2014-07-12,4,We tend to go here in the summer only. The food is average to pretty good, depending on what you order, but the outside seating on a summer night with a nice glass of wine or a craft beer boosts my rating. The inside back room has very strange lighting and bad acoustics that generally keep me away in colder weather. As for the food - The key lime pie is quite yummy.  The cod entree is always a reliable choice and seems to change seasonally as to the risotto and accompany sauce. The burger is also a good standard option as are the mussels. The Parmesan truffle fries can be fantastic, but I've also had them when they are kinda soggy. I'm a sucker for lobster rolls, but theirs looks to be loaded with mayo.
2014-07-07,4,Elysian Cafe is our go-to lunch/brunch/dinner spot in Hoboken.  Why? Food is always consistently fabulous, you don't need reservations, and it has a casual but hip vibe.  Without a question during the summer you must dine al fresco on their patio.  I have tried just about everything on the menu, but my favorite dish is the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp.  The dish is large enough to share, is perfectly dressed and comes with a healthy portion of jumbo grilled shrimp and two anchovies.  One of Hoboken's bests - highly recommend!
2014-06-28,3,Stopped in for a drink.  The bar area is beautiful.  The food I saw being served to other patrons looked appetizing and generous.  I'm going back for a meal....However, it was worth visiting just for to the 1895 feel of the place.
2014-06-23,4,Elysian! It's been a while. Good to see you again.On Sunday (06/22), my boyfriend and I stopped here for a way-too-late-meal-to-be-considered-brunch (it was just after 3 when we got there), and since the weather was absolutely gorgeous, we decided to sit outside. Our server (I think his name was John) came out almost immediately and seemed quite amused at my boyfriend's lack of decisiveness, but he was a genuinely nice guy and made some very astute suggestions on what to order (he dismissed the croquette as "just a ham sandwich" and praised the steak sandwich to the skies).For our entrees, I decided on the smoked salmon club, which was an impressive set of four small triple-decker sandwiches with huge helpings of delicious salmon, avocado, dill sauce, and fresh lettuce. I assumed I would get the pommes frites as my side, but I was surprised when John offered the option of salad instead, so I went with that and was rewarded with a hearty portion of vibrant romaine and red leaf lettuce, drizzled in a balsamic reduction dressing. I also had a glass of Cabernet with my meal, which helped bring out the smoky flavor of the salmon. My boyfriend ordered the highly recommended Elysian Steak Sandwich and was quite pleased with it. I tried a piece of the steak and liked it; it was cooked medium but was not chewy or hard.  I willed myself to stay away from his pommes frites, however. Those things should come with a warning label for extreme deliciousness.I'm glad to see The Elysian Cafe step up its game from my last visit, and I will definitely be back for more good food.
2014-06-21,3,This review is for dinner only - I will definitely have to come back for brunch after reading the positive reviews associated with brunch.A group of 8 of us came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  We called ahead and made a reservation for 7:30, which they accommodated.  Our waitress was Christine - she was very nice and attentive, even though she was very busy.  I had the Caesar Salad appetizer and it was definitely a decent dressing.  I would recommend if you are going to order it, though, to order no anchovies if you don't like them or else it will come with them.  I got the skirt steak for dinner, since I always get the skirt steak at a place I am trying out.  It came with a risotto and both were excellent.  The steak was also cooked as requested, medium rare.  The dessert menu looked appetizing but since it was such a nice night, we decided to walk to Ben and Jerry's instead.I am giving this place 3 stars because the restaurant was OBNOXIOUSLY loud inside.  I am certainly not too picky when it comes to noise, but this was a little out of control, especially for a dining room.  I don't know if it was just a rowdy night, but if you are going to have a sit down restaurant you should at least have a dining area that isn't so insanely loud.  The restaurant inside is decorated nicely and it has the feel of a nice restaurant.  It's a shame that this brought my experience from great to good but, nevertheless, I will probably go back and try the brunch, so I hope to update my review after!
2014-06-19,3,I recently made a brunch pit stop at Elysian Cafe during a long Jersey City to Weehawken walk. Elysian Cafe is the oldest continually operated restaurant in Hoboken with a French bistro style menu. I find this place absolutely adorable, and the outdoor seating is very popular during brunch hours. They had decorated the exterior with a few flags for Memorial Day weekend.The brunch menu was very reasonably priced, and they also offer brunch cocktail specials (around $6, if I'm remembering correctly). There were several cute dogs accompanying their humans for brunch, but sadly, there was nothing on the menu was intended for them. Every time someone accidentally dropped some food, the dogs got really excited.We started with a couple bellinis, but the peach puree seemed to be lacking slightly. The bubbles were still refreshing though. John ordered the Fromage Omelet ($8.75) with pommes frites on the side. I had a bite of the omelet, and that fontina cheese was yummy, but so rich! I don't think I could have finished that entire omelet all by myself.Unfortunately, there was mix up with my order. I had ordered the Eggs Florentine ($9.75) with Lyonnaise potatoes on the side. The waiter first brought me an omelet with the potatoes, then went back to the kitchen to fix my order. He then came out with Eggs Florentine with fries, as well as a comped cocktail. Since they were already giving me a free cocktail and were incredibly apologetic about the wait, I didn't want to mention that I actually wanted potatoes, not fries. It's all good, and the fries were tasty. I typically judge a restaurant's brunch based on their Eggs Benedict-type dishes, and Elysian Cafe hit the mark, especially for the price. Lots of spinach, perfectly poached eggs, a nice hollandaise sauce. Perhaps next time I'll finally try the Lyonnaise potatoes. I'm a carbaholic, and I sure do love my potatoes.
2014-06-18,5,Exactly what we were looking for! We were in Hoboken for the afternoon so we strolled the main drag and decided this spot looked promising. What a great find! The best BLT I've ever had - thick bacon with little fat, roasted tomatoes, avocado and presented stacked with piping hot and crispy fries in a rustic metal cup. Totally enjoyed with a Stella on tap. Friendly service - all was just right!
2014-06-13,2,Wow, the bartenders are really, really douchy. I know that I am not a twice a week regular, but seriously, wife and I sat at the bar for a saturday 9pm dinner and got the most attitude, and most in-attentive service I have ever gotten.  The food is great, but if it served by a non-engaged brat than I don't see the point.  P.S. guys that's how you develop regulars that feed you a steady stream of great tips. There are plenty of places to spread the joy and money in Hoboken, Work Harder.
2014-06-08,3,Came here for brunch this weekend.  Sat outside because it was beautiful out, and while the setting was nice and quaint, the chairs were ungodly uncomfortable lol  You had to lean a certain way to find a comfortable balance.  There was no wait which was great, and our waitress was very nice.  Though, I ordered a bloody mary and she handed me a mimosa, & she recommended the fries vs potatoes wedges (said they were amazing), and they had absolutely no flavor watsoever.  I ordered the salmon eggs benedict which was very yummy.  My boyfriend ordered some pancakes & sausage and, disappointingly so, he literally got 1 little piece of sausage cut down the middle.  His food was fine.  Probably won't come here again when there are so many other options in Hoboken, but it was okay.
2014-06-03,4,Elysian Cafe appears to be a little hoity-toity when you first look at it from the outside. Back in the day, before we tried them, I think my boyfriend and I avoided it for that reason. One day we went for lunch or brunch and we've been addicted ever since. We circle the block desperately looking for a parking spot in Hoboken even on a cold winter's day just so we can eat there.We feel acceptable arriving in t-shirt and jeans. I noticed the other day the hostess was dressed very casually. The interior is classy. Old fashioned antique ceilings. The thick dramatic curtain in front of the door always impressed me. Makes you feel less like a pig when you're stuffing a cheeseburger into your face. A pig with a pearl necklace on.I can't remember ever having an issue with the wait staff. They've always been pleasant.Their prices for most menu items are okay but they can be a little steep for certain items. We usually come for brunch when they have a nice discount on drinks. I recommend their Bloody Mary. Their coffee has been enjoyed by me many times. I've had the Steak and Eggs, Eggs Florentine, Eggs Benedict, Egg White Omelet, Salmon Eggs Benedict...I might be missing one. All delicious. Pick the french fries over the lyonnaise potatoes though--sad looking and not a lot of taste to them. The french fries are DIVINE. Think high class McDonald's fries. One time we went crazy and ordered the cheese plate. I don't think we'll do it again any time soon because it cost $12 but we did enjoy it.We came for dinner a time or two. I ordered the Pan Roasted Salmon one of those times. Really delicious. Their burger is also great even though it's bigger than my head and I have a hard time eating it without looking ridiculous.On warm days we love to eat outdoors if there are any seats left. Elysian Cafe is always busy when we come on the weekends. Lately we've been seated in the back area. The first time it smelled like sweat back there for some reason. I couldn't help but keep thinking that the guys in the kitchen must be sweating profusely and I was smelling their bodies. It didn't help my appetite. There were little kids nearby though...maybe they were the smelly ones. While we're on the topic of kids I don't understand why people bring small children here. The restaurant welcomes them...but I don't think they should. Not because I hate kids or anything. It just doesn't seem appropriate for this kind of place? Doesn't go with the flow. A couple of times we were seated right by a table of loud brats and their self absorbed parents so that could be poisoning my judgement.Privileged Hoboken children aside we will be returning for some time to come I expect.
2014-05-28,4,love half priced Mondays. everything is good. it's a must do. the bartender however is douchey, I feel like he belongs in bushwick and hates his life for working in hoboken.
2014-05-26,4,Came here for brunch this weekend.waited for about 5 minutes for a table. In the interm we had drinks at the bar, I had the High Apron, which was refreshing,  perfect for a summer day.I had the blueberry pancakes (gateaux chaud) with ham. For $8.50 it was a good deal, just somewhat of a disparity that my drink was $10. They do have a list of brunch cocktails for $5.25 (bloody maries, mimosas etc.)
2014-05-22,4,One of the best places for brunch in hoboken. The downside being the wait but theres plenty of seating at the bar to get your table. I had the Salmon eggs benedict which i always do over there its by far the best brunch item along with couple of mimosas adding on the perfect weather and outdoor seating made it for an awesome brunch.
2014-05-08,5,The BLT on the bar menu blew me away.  The thickness and amount of bacon paired with the avocado just sunk in my mouth.  Never wrote a review ever for food and I just had to share this.
2014-05-06,2,I walked in to be seated and asked a waiter who was not with any customers where I could find the hostess. His answer to me was "by the door!" in a 'you stupid' tone of voice rolling his eyes. Thanks! If I saw someone there I wouldn't have asked! If there was a host stand I would've waited there! You have 3 seperate seating areas (outside, front bar area, back dining area). Chill out. Everyone else was fairly pleasant. The amaretto French toast is good but I don't need to go back for it because I don't need to eat in a bad mood. It's not as if this area is lacking in other places to eat.
2014-04-27,3,A neighborhood stalwart.  Good food on the bar menu (which you can order anywhere).I recommend going on a Monday night where you can get 2 for 1.Skip steak night on Wednesday- meat was tough.My lady really likes the cocktails and the fried calamari salad.
2014-04-18,5,This place is great.  What a great job they do all around.  The ceilings you can stare at all day.  Drinks are impeccable.   Bartenders do a great job.   Service is great unless you get the tall white guy with the enormous attitude.  Your better of asking for a new server.  This guy will make you feel like your doing him a favor going to the place.  He needs a new profession..   Not serving people.   That's what you do.  Serve people.  Do it better.  "You got it" isn't a proper answer unless you work at taco bell.  Definitely not #ironshiekclass #makeyouhumble   He's worked there for over a year so I'm not sure why he still has a job.  Owners should know..
2014-04-18,1,The dreaded 1 star...which really means minus a star because you f*cked up.  I've had some good experiences here.  They are a high volume brunch establishment which means they are doing some things right.  The food is pretty good.  That being said, a high volume eatery needs a high intensity staff that are on the ball at all times.  We entered around 10:45 on a Saturday ready to eat.  We were seated at an awkward table with a sun glare.  Without sunglasses, you would not be able to see your friends and would burn up.  It was disturbing, but we cannot control the heavens.  The server came around and we alerted her to our displeasure with the table.  She nodded and took our drink order...one water, one seltzer.  I eventually couldn't take the radiation seats any longer, and I got up to talk to our server who was talking to another group that wanted to change their seat for the same reason.  I reminded her that I had asked fifteen minutes ago to move outside of the radioactive zone. She responded, "he just requested that table in the shade".  I had requested it fifteen minutes ago.  Defeated I walked to my seat in the microwave.  Upset and starting to sweat, I couldn't order.  I could see that my guest was also not amused by the charade that was going on neither.  I told her that we were leaving as I put on my coat.  Nothing could prepare me for what happened next.We were both shaking our heads about the lack of concern and direct disregard to change tables as I see a waitress running after me with a guest check.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  she wanted money for club soda.  Water with carbon dioxide in it? Really????  I know that she didn't want the money...It was the scumbag managers so I wouldn't be too hard on her for doing her job.I asked her if she is serious and opened my wallet and asked her if a $5 bill would cover it?  Never EVER again with this low life establishment!  You do not treat a customer like shit and chase him for money for water with bubbles in it..DISGUSTING!  Also the bathroom is gross, and I never eat a place with a dirty bathroom.   The cooks relieve themselves in that same bathroom with no paper towels.
2014-04-16,4,I had brunch here last Sunday, and it was wonderful. They have a beautiful area where you can eat outside, and it didn't hurt that it was the most gorgeous day out. We had the salmon eggs Benedict and the cinnamon-amaretto french toast along with coffee and mimosas. both entrees came with these little buckets of fries...when I say little...I mean NOT so little, considering we didn't even eat through half of what was in each bucket! Yum! The salmon eggs Benedict was delicious. The eggs were poached perfectly, and the smoked salmon was not too smoked/fishy tasting, so you know it was fresh. I could have stood for more hollandaise sauce on top though. The french toast was also very yummy. It was a little dry, but the maple syrup took care of that! The flavors weren't too much or too little, just the right amount of everything. Next time, I think I will ask for some fruit on the side! The plating of both dishes was well done. Our server was sweet, attentive, and on her game, especially considering how busy it was. I believe for the two of us to eat, our bill was under $40 before tip. Definitely worth it!
2014-04-13,3,I have been here many times over the last 10 years and have had pretty good experiences over all, however I now have realized where I went wrong, I only eat here during the week at weekends it gets really busy and the quality goes way down.The burger is my favorite here and the sandwiches are good too I like that you can get wine in a carafe and the rooms are nice not too noisy and during the week a good place to meet for a chat over lunch.As I said above its a different story at the weekend way too many strollers for me and groups of loud young people recounting who they were sick on the night before !!!!
2014-04-05,3,I would rate it a 4 star really. Stopped by for brunch today and loved the lobster roll and eggs. Nice ambience and friendly service. Also wish we could have sat outside, but it was too windy. Took a star off for the DUMB HOSTESS, who told us it would be a 25 minute wait, even while we saw a couple of empty tables. When I pointed out the empty tables to her, she said that we could sit there and we did right away. Isn't it her job to know which tables are available? The place may be losing business thanks to this hostess
2014-03-24,4,Sooo friggin good. After going on an adventure around Hoboken on an unusually beautiful day, my friends and I decided to stop here and grab some food and dranks.I ordered a burger which was delish! It was just a tad too salty, but otherwise amazing. I also got a drink, which was a little too expensive for my taste and it was extremely strong. I couldn't drink it alone, I had to have my friends drink some too.This was only the second time I've been here but both experiences have been fantastic. The service is always great, everyone is always so pleasant and attentive.Def going to hit up Elysian Cafe more often.
2014-03-23,4,I've been here multiple times for brunch (not sure why it's taken me so long to write a review for them!). I really enjoy the eggs benedict here which is what I always get when I come. I've also tried the amaretto french toast - super deelish but a bit heavy. We almost always get the same server and he always provides great service. My only complaint is that the food never comes out piping hot the way I like it. On at least one ocassion I've had to send it back and ask them to heat it up some more. They actually replaced the dish and made sure it was hot which I appreciated. One quick tip: get the pommes frites instead of the home fries - you (but not your waistline) will thank me later!
2014-03-09,4,Nice trendy, upscale diner type.  The only one of its kind that I've come across so far in Hoboken.  Portions are smaller than a traditional NJ diner which I prefer and am okay with.  Food is fresh, high quality and made well.  I enjoy pretty much everything on the menu.  Good place, have been here 5 times in as many months and plan on coming back regularly.
2014-03-03,4,Always a line for Sunday brunch! Plan accordingly.If you don't mind the servers butchering the French language, but serve VERY tasty meals, then come here (at least for brunch).A little pricey for special brunch drinks, so steer clear unless you want a mimosa. Very cramped as well, though it may change when it's warmer outsideI had the steak and eggs... damn good steak and VERY GOOD MUSTARD. The bacon on the side is hard to top as well. All in all, if it weren't for the wait and the pronunciations, I'd say it was perfect.
2014-02-24,4,Good reasonable experience with a lot on the plate. Great food, and atmosphere is always a plus. Really like this neighbor every day place, focus on having diners coming back. The staff is professionally trained, with the exception of a couple of small accidents easy resolved with a smile and a comp. It's def an Hoboken institution.
2014-02-16,3,I moved to Hoboken about five years ago, and had always been curious about Elysian Cafe.  The outdoor patio looked particularly inviting, and there never seemed to be an empty table whenever I would walk by.  My boyfriend and I were eager to give it a try, so we brought our healthy appetites over to Elysian for brunch.  Our server was friendly, and the steak and eggs were cooked perfectly.  So far, so good.Given how much I'd enjoyed my first experience at Elysian, I decided to put their dinner menu to the test.  I was just as impressed with their dinner selection as I was with their brunch menu - the steaks and truffle fries were delicious, and I ended up pairing the experience with a nice glass of wine and dessert.  It was surprising to see that they were just as busy during dinner as they were during brunch, as in my experience most restaurants only specialize in one meal.With that in mind, my boyfriend and I decided to stop by for lunch on his birthday.  What better way to celebrate?  Unfortunately, this is where Elysian fell short on its offerings.  We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and a burger, which were both mediocre at best  --  and it didn't help that a baby at a nearby table vomited all over herself (and the table, and the floor).  Not really what comes to mind when you're looking to celebrate a special occasion!  The family was scrambling around to clean up, but I didn't see anyone else rushing over to help them.  I would have at least expected a manager or server to apologize for the disruption, but we were left to ourselves.That being said, I would still return for brunch or dinner...but I'm removing two stars for the disappointing lunch experience.
2014-02-13,4,I enjoyed a lovely brunch here with my husband and one of our best friends last week. While they don't have an extensive menu, they had a good variety of choices in their brunch menu that will satisfy someone looking for either breakfast food or a lunch dish. My chicken sandwich was excellent. The service was good,  and the wait wasn't too long, even though it was really busy. Also, the menu items are very reasonbly priced. I would recommend this place for a nice lunch in Hoboken.
2014-02-11,3,This is a bar and a  mediocre French bistro. Came here for dinner on a Friday night, it was busy just like most of other restaurants in town. We sat in the middle of the back room at a small patio size table among a more matured crowd. I ordered the seafood special shrimp with creamy polenta, with water melon chopped up on the top, it was good but not great, the polenta got boring quick. My date had the Chipotle Thyme Marinated Skirt Steak, a generous portion, but the risotto needed more cooking. The highlight was the Double Chocolate Sundae. the coffee was low diner quality, almost as bad as the ones Citi offers at work. Others say this place has great brunch so we might be back to try it on the weekend, but for dinner you could find better spots.
2014-01-25,4,I love this place. Walked by it a thousand times without ever coming in, I regret it now. Very interesting interior design, antique ceiling. Casual, great atmosphere with nice music in the background. Their portions are huge, so be prepared. But food is delicious, so I am sure you will be more than happy with portion sizes. For the appetizer we ordered their Mussels in white wine sauce, and I think they beat any mussels I tried before, or after for that matter! Make sure to ask them for a spoon, because you sure would want to drink that white wine sauce! 1 portion is good for 2 people. For the mains, I ordered their crispy calamari salad, and my brother ordered their famous Pastrami Reuben. I enjoyed my salad very much, but once I tried Pastrami Reuben I was simply blown away. Juicy, tender, flavourful and absolutely delicious! A must try for pastrami fans! It is a little too crowded, but I guess that speaks of the quality of their food =) Overall, a great experience!
2014-01-04,5,Why have I not reviewed Elysian?? The better half of the duo and I had lived across the street for years and have always made it our stop. Never a bad time, always a good drink -- Bubba, Josh ... even Aimes, most of the time -- you can not go wrong :)  So what if you had a bad burger one time here ... it will be fantastic next time. A talented kitchen makes it happen on a regular basis. I have sat in this restaurant countless times and still find new details that map me smile ... truly a great spot on the desolate crap-scape that is Hoboken restaurants.
2014-01-03,5,Great local establishment with a gorgeous ceiling! The staff is friendly and the food is right on! Extraordinary chicken club sandwich and side salad with fennel.  Really love the decor and "everyone knows your name" atmosphere!
2013-12-28,4,Went for Brunch and it was quite good. Hot chocolate was rich but a little Luke warm. Blueberry pancakes were delicious! Nice atmosphere
2013-12-13,4,Amazing brunch.  The salmon eggs benedict is amazing along with their French Toast.  Cool looking restaurant.  The staff is very friendly Ave their coffee is very good.  The place is small so you might have to wait a while to get in but it is worth it.
2013-12-11,5,Ate here for dinner in the back room. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was really cozy. Overall great experience. There entrees are a little pricer but well worth it but they also have a nice bar menu with gourmet burgers and sandwiches that are more reasonably priced.
2013-11-21,3,Lunch on Nov 15Wish I could give it a 3.5 stars.What impressed me:  - the decor - very interesting.  loved the antique ceiling and architecture  - the Frisee Salad - something I would expect at a high class/expensive restaurant.  One of the best salads i have had in a very long time!  - the table water in old wine bottles, nice touch!What I think they could do better:  - the Croque Monsieur was hot, cheesy but came out on plain white bread.  it was even giant size bread, just normal white bread.  Very disappointed after such a great salad that this sandwich wasn't on a better quality and tastier bread  - didn't car for the round tables in the bar area, they were very small.  - the wait staff was wearing screen printed t-shirts.  now it was a Friday and it was lunch, but the quality of food and decor didn't seem a good fit for t shirts.I would definitely like to go back and try other menu items!
2013-11-20,4,After walking past this place for a few years I finally went in for brunch. What the heck was I waiting for? The eggs florentine are so good. Since then I  have never been disappointed anytime I have gone back. They also have a good selection of beer. The actual space is really beautiful and has a lot to look at though sometimes a little small and cramped near the bar.
2013-11-18,5,So French. So, so French. This cafe (which is a sister restaurant with Amanda's just down the street) is a beautiful little spot to grab a weekend brunch and just relax.  The decor in the building is beautiful, with rich ornamentation and gorgeous cerulean walls. It was also surprisingly spacious since after seeing the outside seating, I imagined the indoors to be even smaller!The boyfriend and I were yet again on the brunch exploration. I ordered my staple: eggs florentine. And man, this place did it right. The hollandaise was creamy and tangy. The eggs were poached perfectly. The spinach delish. What was a bit different, however, was that it came with pommes frites instead of the more typical hash browns or home fries. When I bit into them, however, I didn't care. Those were some delicious French fries.After sipping some coffee for a while (also good), we got the bill which was meh. Not cheap, not expensive, right about where it should be. Not as fancy/gourmet as Amanda's, but it's cheaper and more laidback. A hardy yes to visiting this one again!
2013-10-30,5,This is the place I bring friends who have never been to Hoboken. Especially when the weather is nice and you can sit outside to eat, there is no better place to go! They are very dog friendly and it's nice to have a place where the puppy can sit and people watch while you eat!I never eat fish, but the Pan Roasted Salmon here is so amazing and unbelievably well cooked EVERY single time. I have seriously never been disappointed by this place. I have probably ordered it 15+ times and it gets better every time. The potato leek cake and spinach it comes with are also fantastic.On one occasion I did stop here for brunch and had the egg white omelet. It was just one of the best omelets I have ever had! This place can do no wrong in my book! The Monday night special (Buy one get one free for bar entrees) is such a great deal, if only the salmon were on the bar menu!
2013-10-16,2,Very overrated and overpriced as a restaurant, but probably okay as a bar with food.We ate outside and the waiter kept going missing or messing things up. The food was only okay, and there was part of lobster shell left in the lobster sandwich. I was lucky not to choke. When i showed it, they offered a free dessert, though we were not planning on dessert.Friends tell me Amanda's is the place to eat, while Elysian is for the bar, and they are owned by the same people. My experience is that they are right that Elysian is not somewhere for fine dining, though they try to charge those kinds of prices.
2013-10-14,3,Well I'm finally here.. Been passing this place for years....Staff seems nice and accommodating.. It's a lot of people here for brunch ...I had the steak and eggs  with a side of bacon... The fries came out room temp. If not cold... Steak wasn't what I thought it should be and they messed of the temp. I wanted. But my bacon was perfect !!! Thick, crips and meaty.I would come back again and try dinner before I rule them out...
2013-10-09,5,I don't think I've ever been disappointed here. This includes the best meal I had the week Sandy left Hoboken without power (and sanity). During day 4 of no electricity and room temperature food, enough was enough. Trekking out in the dark, we stumbled upon Elysian - one of the only restaurants still serving a hot meal. We were seated in the main dining room (lit by candles - hello mood lighting). The waitress was apologetic that all they had was stuffed rigatoni with red sauce as if it would be the worst thing we could possibly eat. Let me tell you - that meal was the highlight of my week. I got my first hot meal AND a glass of wine (or two) in 4 days! The huge plate of pasta and wine was $5 each. It was cheaper and better than some of the date nights I've had. I meant to send them a Christmas card thanking them for their hospitality and warm atmosphere during that week, but I forgot to (oops!) - I'll just leave them a stellar review here instead. I've had the skirt steak, braised beef short ribs, cheese plate and steak au poivre - all which I would recommend to a friend. They've consistently had great service and food. It's nice to know that such a reliable establishment is just a stone's throw away.
