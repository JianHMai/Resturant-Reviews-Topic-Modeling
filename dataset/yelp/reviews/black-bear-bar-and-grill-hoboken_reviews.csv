2021-11-15,3,Pros: This is your "basic b" chicken wrap, and that's not a bad thing. Thin chicken strips. Lettuce. Tomato. Tastes like Frank's Red Hot wing sauce. Eh. Comes with fries, unlike Mr. Wraps. Also delivery was lightning quick.Cons: I ordered this via Seamless and it was $15.95. I may need to go there today and find out if Seamless jacked up the price on me again. This wrap is not as big as other restaurants. The chicken strips at other restaurants were more "meatier" and the buffalo sauce for other restaurants was far superior. Was it just basic Franks Red Hot?Verdict: 7.2 / 10. This isn't a "bad score". It's good. However if I were to order this again, likely would go elsewhere.
2021-11-15,2,Was there with a couple friends on a Sunday. The staff seemed like they did not want to be there nor were they interested in at least pretending or giving a fake smile. My cousin ordered a Mojito and was given a can of Bacardi mojito instead of a mixed drink. Can of Mojito was $18.. really? We had one drink and left. I'm only giving this place two stars because it was clean and they had the Devils game on.
2021-11-08,4,We stopped here to get some casual American Bar food and a few drinks on Sunday for football. They have AMAZING Sunday Specials that include food & drinks. I went with one other person and we got a pitcher of beer and two appetizers. We paid less than $25 each at the end of it- which can be sort of unheard of in Hoboken/NYC area (especially when alcohol is involved)The atmosphere is very fun and inviting to a younger crowd. The area right when you walk in is covered with giant TVs all over the wall which makes the football experience fun and exciting!We got the Buffalo chicken dip, which was a little too spicy for me (but still tasty) and the fried pickles. The fried pickles were amazing! They came with an aoli sauce which really made it. Overall, this was a good experience. It was still fun, but not wild like some of the other bars in Hoboken. Perfect place to watch, and actually hear, the sports games going on.
2021-10-10,1,Food was fine, but staff made anti-semitic and racist comments to us,  will not be returning.
2021-10-02,1,Waiter TWICE blatantly charged us for drinks we didn't order. Once is a mistake, twice is not. Used to love the place but I can't support grimy moves like this. I bet he assumed we were drunk idiots on NFL Sunday but we caught 4 white claws ($10 a piece!) added to one check and then 3 expensive cocktails added to another. Won't return
2021-09-26,4,I went here on a Sunday at 12:30 for football games. Sat upstairs at the bar. Bartender was attentive. Got a burger and fries, both were really good. Place got packed. Super loud DJ, that plays music during the commercial breaks. Which I found odd and pointless. TVs were locked into games for the day. Couldn't have my game on the TV right in front of me and I was alone at the bar before the 1 o'clock games started. Kinda pricey but it is Hoboken.
2021-08-30,1,2pm on a Monday. Not open although placard and online says it is. No answer on phone.
2021-08-27,2,Ugh Hoboken what is going on?!?! Black bear is a nice looking sports bar, awesome for events when it's packed, the energy is alive (from the customers) but come here on a non event day or night and I've walked through the door now 4 times and no greeting from anyone, sit at the bar (which I've done 3 times) and the greeting seems contemptuous and obligatory. The bartender, manager and server congregate at the end of the bar chatting amongst themselves creating a very thick and cliquey atmosphere. There is a balance between a happy clown atmosphere and a totally cold one.. black bear should find it; the food is nice for a bar and so is the atmosphere but maybe others have had better experiences, if you know from my other reviews I'm not the quintessential hot guy and well Hoboken runs rampant with gym bros and basic babes :D
2021-07-15,4,I've been to Black Bear a couple times for lunch and enjoyed it ! Came here again and actually remembered to review! Classic sports bar appeal with the menu to match it . Started off with Chicken nachos which were very good ( arrived hot which seems to be rare with Nachos). We followed up with salads : chicken Caesar for me and a Cobb for my friend. Both were very good and generous in size . Overall , a solid choice with consistent service amongst the bar food scene ! BB will continue to be a lunch option for me .
2021-07-11,1,Absolutely awful service and experience from the manager -- avoid at all costs! Our group of 4 will never come back because of how unwelcoming this place is.The manager came up to us out of the blue screaming at us to leave because we weren't seated by the hostess (as if we were trying to pull a fast one in a place that still had 10 empty tables??). Could not believe someone would be so hostile about being seated in a half empty place and attempting to throw us out.Long story short we were able to stay (should have just left immediately) and then later that night, the same manager starts walking around to all the TVs and starts turning them off when the place was full as a sign to 'get the heck out' ... at 12:30!!! They close at 3! Everyone in the upstairs area then walked out as clearly nobody was welcomed to stay. Still can't believe how hostile and unwelcome this manager was to everyone!
2021-06-13,1,The worst staff ever!!!! The manager behaved like she did a favour seating us, the waitress was as disinterested as her manager. Felt like they'd been asked to come to work at gun point. DO NOT visit!!!!
2021-05-13,5,Love this place always clean staff is friendly and there's a lot of space and good music. The service isn't the fastest but the atmosphere is worth it.
2021-05-01,1,my 2 friends and i wanted to enjoy our lovely saturday in hoboken at black bear and there was an available high-chair table, but my friends and i were refused the table because it was only for 4 or more people.. this is poor management because we assured the staff that we would be in and out within an hour and the table had been empty for over 30 minutes.. black bear would rather turn away a profit rather than establishing a relationship with hoboken locals. lastly, black bear does not know our budget and how much we were planning on spending -- which could have been more than their potential table of 4 or more if they ever were to come. i am upset with this establishment & am unlikely to return.
2021-04-11,1,Like other Yelpers have mentioned, this bar had the worst service ever and like my other fellow Yelpers, I suspect that the waitress we had was racist. The waitress was extremely rude to me, my boyfriend and my friend. And for context, I am Asian and my bf is black. When I went to complain about the waitress to the hostess, they both proceeded to shout at me. And the waitress aggressive put her hand in my face. And then security proceeded to push my boyfriend who was behind me when he was no where near the waitress and the hostess. If you are a person of color, do not come here. They are a racist establishment. They also do not follow COVID protocols. The security did not wear a mask and there was a line outside that did not adhere to the social distancing guidelines in place.
2021-04-11,1,Absolutely horrendous service! Please take your business next door or literally anywhere else in Hoboken. Manager + staff are absolutely useless and don't care about customer service at all. After asking my waitress various times for assistance, she ignored us and never helped with the situation we were asking for.  Honestly, will NEVER return here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-04-07,5,One of my favorite spots in hoboken! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun, and the lemonade is freshly squeezed by Johnny. If you're ever looking for a fun spot to hang out on a Monday, this is your place!
2021-03-21,4,I visited Black Bear Bar and Grill on a Friday night with my girl friends. We had to wait for 20 minutes on a line to enter because they were at capacity. I did not mind because my friends really wanted to go there and the bouncer was completely nice about it and updated us on the wait time. We entered and the music was EXTREMELY loud that you could not hear the person next to you. Other than that the music was really good. The DJ they had really made me want to dance. I ordered a Tito's and pomegranate and it was served in a tall glass and tasted good. For the rest of the night me and my friends had vodka shots. For my food I got the Buffalo Chicken Wrap and it was SO GOOD. Definitely recommend. The downside of this place was that our waiter didn't really come to our table much and seemed to talk to other workers more than helping us. I would certainly go here to hear some good music and get something to drink/eat but don't bet on having conversations.
2021-03-08,2,Skip for a night out unless you're in to music so loud you can't hear your own thoughts. Buffalo chicken wrap was good!
2021-03-03,5,Our server was awesome!!! Drinks were on point and Deanna was attentive to everything we needed!!! Most of the time I'm very skeptical of coming to hoboken bars but she made me change my mind.......Hopefully
2021-02-20,1,I usually never leave a bad review, but this is the worst service I've had in my life and I suspect that the waitress was racist. Not once did she check in on us, we had to walk all the way to the front to ask someone to ask her to come to our table to order anything. This happened 4 times as we wanted to order more drinks. Then she added gratuity on the check even though we were only 3 people. She put a false number of people on the check to add the gratuity. We asked for this to be fixed, though we were still going to tip her albeit a little less for the horrible service. She comes back and throws the fixed check at us, yelling at us to never come back here. Her name was Danielle I believe and she was the rudest waitress I've had in my life. Now I know why this place only had 3 stars. I understand covid has hit business hard, but this is unacceptable.
2020-12-03,3,Beer was cold. Bartender said I had a small penis.
2020-11-01,3,My friend and I used to love going here for brunch but over the years food and service had gone downhill. I recently went back couple weeks ago for brunch and felt a little disappointed. I understand we are living in the uncertain time at the moment but if you are going to increase the price of the drinks and food, I would expect good service alongside with that. We did not feel welcoming so we just had our food, one drink and left to go elsewhere. Would probably have to reconsider about going back there again.
2020-10-25,3,Disappointed that I had to use Grub Hub for a delivery (surprise treat for my son's birthday). 3 orders of wings cost me $57 and only contained 21 wings. Almost $3 a wing is a bit much. Maybe need to use another service and you'd think BB should include more wings in a $13 order!
2020-10-16,2,Stopped for a late lunch.  We wanted a great burger but unfortunately didn't find it at Black Bear. The boozy lemonade was horrible and not worth the cost. The best part of our experience was our server Destiny. She was sweet and friendly and is a plus for the Black Bear experience.
2020-10-11,2,Bar and grill located in the bustling main street of Hoboken. For the kind of dishes they serve, everything seems to be overpriced -- for example you can't order a burger for less than $15 dollars as well as their drink selection. Ordered a can of hemp seltzer for $6 a can while my friend ordered a beer for close to $8. Waitress was okay but like most wait staff encountered in Hoboken, have this sort of weird snooty attitude if you ask for anything such as splitting the check.Burger was good but again, not necessarily worth the money. For the amount of money and lack of menu diversity, I'd go elsewhere.
2020-10-08,4,I really love coming to Black bear when I'm in Hoboken! The staff is very chill and for the most part I have always experienced the best service when I have gone there. I recommend the Buffalo chicken quesadillas! Their drinks are decent and reasonably priced.
2020-08-31,4,We wound up at Black Bear the other day in order to satisfy my boyfriend's burger craving.  While I had been to the nice sports bar several times over the past decade, I had only eaten there once, but remembered being impressed.  This visit was no different.  I wound up ordering a Turkey Burger Wrap, despite being curious how they would fit a patty inside a spiraled tortilla.  The wrap, which I requested in the whole wheat variety, was stuffed with moist ground turkey, sautéed onions, romaine lettuce, and tomatoes.  I had left off the hot pepper cheese and only realized on my final bite that they had forgotten to include the guacamole.  Despite that disappointment, I was in awe of how flavorful the poultry was and just how much punch the onions added.  The sandwich came with a handful of delicious French Fries, which were thin, crisp, and perfectly salted.  My boyfriend also enjoyed his Hamburger and Fries, though his meat had been slightly overcooked.Black Bear had a reputation for a fun place to enjoy a beer or watch a game, but their food should also be a reason to visit.
2020-06-29,3,This will be short and sweet. I visited the Hoboken area for the first time, my friends and I decided to take a stroll and find somewhere to eat. We stumbled upon Black Bear Bar and Grill, they had outdoor seating and everyone looked to be enjoying themselves. We decided not to dine-in but to take drinks to go. We order 3 margaritas which came in cute clear bottles. The margaritas were $12 and not worth it to me -- there was an odd bitter taste. I will not lie, I did get a buzz from the drink but it was not tasty.
2020-06-27,1,Came by to grab a seat at 6pm at your place for dinner for outdoor seating soon after covid reopening. The 2 outdoor guys at the front were very unaccomodating as the place was EMPTY and i requested a certain seat away from a high traffic area. I was told i only had one seat to choose from which was ridiculous! Interesting how this place would rather not make money and accommodate customers than having them walk away which is what i did. Walked by an hour later and 2 people were sitting in the "4 person table". Went to a restaurant down the block who was courteous and said "sit whenever you want; first come first serve".
2020-06-26,2,This place got our take out order wrong, gave us someone else's order to make-up for lost time, and we ended up having to pay double for wings. Get it together.
2020-06-18,1,If I'm not mistaken I have seen and heard 100s of commercials talking about how poorly restaurants are doing during the Covid 19 pandemic. So I go to Black Bear, a spot I have always enjoyed, for outdoor dining at 3pm. I see that there are only 2 dining at the outdoor area so I ask for a table and I'm told I cant have the table for my wife and I would like because a party of 4 might show and need the table. I questioned this and was told that the servers need to make money. Not sure how 2 paying, tipping customers is beat out for a table by a group of that might materialize from thin air but hey good luck with that.
2020-05-28,4,Writing a late review, I visited Black Bear last just before the lockdown. Pros: Easily accessible, ample seating, large screen TV for games, extensive bar menu with just about anything you'd desire. Adequate bar food, generous portions at a reasonable price.Cons: limited to no off street parking. Can get very busy with young, wild folks. Getting the bar tenders attention for a drink can take some time if busy however, the response time is for based on the crowd.
2020-02-27,4,This was our first visit here to this restaurant and I was glad we chose it. We sat outside which was nice. We were here for brunch. I had french onion soup and side salad. It was the best french onion soup I ever had. My daughter had the omelette and she said it was delicious. The service was good and the menu selection was good. The prices were not too pricey. I recommend this restaurant if you are ever in Hoboken.
2020-02-26,4,Black Bear has been great for everything from drinks to dinner to a giant platter of wings for Super Bowl Sunday. The bar can get REAL rowdy on game days but still not to the level of so many bars just a few doors down. It never really crosses over to chaos, which is why it is one of my favorite places. I ordered a half tray of wings (50 pc for $50) here the morning of Super Bowl Sunday and they were ready on time, even when I changed that time kind of last minute. And they were gooooood. No complaints on wings. Pretty sure they do a weekday special that I haven't been able to take advantage of yet but need to asap. Definitely a great spot for laid back dinner or drinks or a week day lunch.  If you are in Hoboken and looking for a solid bar vibe with good bites, you'll find it here.
2020-01-11,3,There is a lot of cross contamination with the food. My wings had fries and pieces of Buffalo cauliflower in it.. and my "fresh cut" fries looked like the bottom of the bag and there was a toter tot in there somewhere
2020-01-05,1,Overpriced, mediocre. I ordered a portobello burger that was just the mushroom--no meat. My mistake i guess? But pretty misleading being under the "burgers" section. In any matter the server took it back after I asked them to fix it. They charged me for the patty. Wouldn't ordinarily complain except it was burnt to a crisp. So it wound up costing me $20 for an awful meal. Won't be back.
2019-12-17,1,20min trip just to find out they are closed on a Monday at 8pm when they were supposed to be open until 2am. No notification of their closure until I walked to the front door. Their website, Yelp, IPhone, or Google map no heads up. If you plan to come here make sure you call because otherwise you'll waste gas or a Uber ride.
2019-12-15,4,What a surprisingly nice visit for lunch I recently had. Black Bear is a loud, lively and youthful bar and grill during the evening. Cut the crowd and vigor in half during the day, and Black Bear becomes a pretty good lunch spot. I sat at the bar, the service was GREAT and the prices were reasonable. I ordered a simple burger and fries, and it was cooked to perfection (kudos for the flame-broiled burgers).  While Black Bear may not be my cup of tea with the night-time crowd, I found the daytime experience to be solid, good food, service, and plenty of sports on the big screens.
2019-12-01,4,I went here for my friend's birthday. The place did not have a long line and was very large with three separate floors. The drinks were strong and the price was right. The music was also really good. There were not a lot of people dancing, but it was definitely good dance music.I find the crowd in Hoboken to be on the younger side so we did feel a bit old being in our 30s. I would definitely come back here again
2019-11-03,4,Went on Sunday with my parents and boyfriend to grab some food and watch the football game. Food was good. Service was good. However, they had a DJ playing in between commercials.. just a lot of stuff going on. DJ, then the game, then yelling and screaming from downstairs. Seemed very odd to have a DJ on a Sunday during a football game.
2019-11-02,5,Love going out here! I've done NYE here, open bar here, and have just been out several times. Such a nice vibe and well priced! I've eaten food here before as well. Just bar food but still delicious!
2019-10-02,5,Love the tacos! Beer is cold ! Taps are clean! Service is par- and the atmosphere is chill during the day! Mac and cheese is delish food is warm. Nice open French high doors.
2019-09-28,5,I think I just found my favorite burger in Hoboken. We got the Frisco burger which had avocado, roasted peppers, I-forgot-the-name cheese, and chipotle mayo and it was GREAT. The bun was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The fries were also really good and paired well with the burger. Del Friscoe's used to be our burger joint but now the Frisco burger at Black Bear is where it's at! We'll definitely be coming back because the service was awesome, too.
2019-09-08,5,My boyfriend and I frequent this bar. There's two bartenders we really like. They're both great and fast, friendly service. The food is great too! We tried the buffalo chicken strips and they aren't worth the cost lol. The regular wings are wayyy better!! We recommend the wings here! Bone-in to be specific. BBQ and buffalo are both great! The blue cheese dressing here is the best in town! Great for dipping your fries in. The fries are perfect here too. Hand cut and crispy. They have fresh jalapeños and the drinks are always good. The Yuengs and Wings deal is incredible!!! So worth it!! The TVs are great quality if you want to watch football. Great atmosphere. We ordered the chili too. The chili was hot and delicious. Cooked perfect with a perfect warm spice. Not spicy at all. The cheese melted perfect when mixed. Yummmmm. We also tried the omelet this time and it was fluffy and cooked perfect.
2019-08-08,1,Just bought a $13 caesar salad that was in a huge container with literally half of the salad in there... NOT RIGHT
2019-07-01,4,Eh.. I would probably give this place more like a 3 1/2 star- however I just rounded off to 4. We came here after walking what seemed like forever from Pier 13. Sunday nights are pretty dry here however that is not why I gave this rating. The food was very lackluster. I ordered the "Shrimp tacos" and a "Philly Cheesesteak w/ fries" for my friend. The shrimp tacos looked and tasted like they could've come off a food truck. They were super small and not filling-but the price was that of a resturant. The Philly Cheesesteak looked good to me - however my friend claimed it was not that great. The bartender/ waitress was very nice and there were nice big screen TVs in there which is why we came in the first place. Overall, the place is very nice and spacious and it is located in Downtown Hoboken which makes it convenient. So I would come back- just maybe have a different choice of food.
2019-06-24,3,We came in for a few drinks and watch the soccer game. It was a Saturday and we got lucky and got a table before it got pretty busy for the game. We can't really speak for the food, but their drink selection was pretty decent. Quite a few beers on tap and a selection of different mimosas. You can sit outside as well. Maybe if we are back in the area, we may try their food.
2019-06-16,1,My wife and I decided to eat at Black Bear yesterday, and it was definitely regretful. I ordered wings and the southwest steak wrap. The wings were terribly dry like they had already been fried the day before and then just reheated. I've had better wings at cheap chain restaurants. The southwest steak wrap was awful. It was a sopping wet mush of greasy cheese, onions and oil. It's a shame because the pieces of steak inside the wrap had decent flavor, but it was overcome by the oily slip of a wrap it was in. The fries looked good but were also dry and not fresh tasting. The service was pretty bad. We had finished the wings for about ten minutes and the server didn't clear our used plates. Finally when the bus boy brought out the main dishes, he had to take away the dishes as the table had no more room. Actually the bus boy was the best part of the experience - he put a piece of plastic under the table leg to help it from teetering, without being asked. The server we had was slow - at one point we had finished our food for 10 minutes and were waiting for our server to come by so we could ask for the check. She was talking to a a guy for a while at the front of the restaurant (not waiting on him as he wasn't eating or drinking, just standing up by the host station). There weren't many tables so it's not clear why she didn't come by to our table frequently.  Overall I feel like I wasted my money and would definitely never eat here again. Woulda been better off eating at a fast food place or chain restaurant, and spending half the money while actually enjoying the food.
2019-06-08,3,Came here on a Friday night to watch the NBA Finals. They played it on the big screen behind the bar which is awesome and we had seats at a tall boy close. The service was attentive. The televisions are plentiful - there's a back room which is a little quieter with TVs all around and then an upstairs with more TVs. Being Friday night though they didn't play sound for the game which I get but would have been nice.The food was good - excellent nachos and above average burgers. The on tap IPA I had was a little flat but they had Mermaid Pilsner in cans so I was good.The bathroom was relatively clean although the urinals are super close together...so unless you like a cozy atmosphere to pee in...it's probably two at a time. The DJ played good music and lots of people were dancing in circles with friends. I'd come here again.
2019-06-03,5,Went on a Sunday with my love for dinner to watch the Red Sox vs Yankees game. We had the wings on the bone with mild sauce. So delicious! Then I ordered the Black Bear slider meal and he had the burger. We absolutely loved it! Can't wait to be back.
2019-05-11,5,Dope spot to watch basketball! The bartender Alysha was even a crazy basketball fan it was sweet! Good beer selections and pretty decent burger. The manger Deanna even came and checked to make sure everything came out okay - definitely will be back!
2019-04-29,5,Went to black bear for some beers and food. Phenomenal burgers. Alysha was a fantastic bartender. Super personable. We will definitely be back
2019-02-05,5,Went today for the first time during my lunch break around 12:30 p.m. It was pretty empty during the day which is nice when you are on a tight schedule just looking for some good food. I ordered the bbq bone-in wings with a Shirley temple and it was amazing. Cooked really well, highly recommend. Customer service was also great, the waitress was friendly and attentive but also gave us space. Also went to Black Bear before for the night life a couple of times. Great music, average price on drinks. A great spot to bar hop to.
2019-02-03,1,Was excited to get into the bar after a nice dinner, but the doorman was just out of place. Asking that customers pay $10 dollars, because one of my friends were wearing Timberland's were just plain stupid.Went into Mills Tavern, which was only a couple shops away, and they didn't have this issue. At least the bartender there kept customers happy.
2019-01-18,5,Good music. Good wood structure. Perfect splash of pineapple in vodka soda. Great DJ and ambiance. Some interesting people on a Friday night.
2019-01-08,3,The build your own bloody Mary bar was pretty cool until you but too much hot sauce in your drink! Over all the service was lovely, our waiter was really nice.  The food was good but way too small. I got the avocado toast and got (3) 2 inch pieces for 7.99 and it was listed on the main menu.
2018-12-15,5,I've always loved Black Bear... for years now! Always a good time and the wings are great. Also the homemade honey mustard beats everyone else out!
2018-12-11,3,I really like this place for the bar scene, especially on game days. It's always a great crowd, the bar is large and the drinks are reasonably priced. It's always a ton of fun. However, I would not recommend this place for a sit-down meal necessarily. My friend and I went for brunch, as they have a separate menu. All of their bar food is sub-par and overpriced. We spent way too much for a casual brunch.
2018-12-05,4,Tradicional Bar with American and Tex Mex food. I order this burger (I don't remember its name) but it was Good. Nice quality, fresh ingredient a little spicy. (The fries are ok). It's price was 13$. No too bad for a nice burger. After food I stayed more time and the place become to have fun. A lot of young people, good music and cheap beer (3$). Good deal to visit this place some times. @elmanudominguez (Instagram).
2018-11-05,4,The bartenders are super friendly.  If you need your bartender to be your therapist for the night, then go here.  They attract a really good crowd, mostly young people in their 20s and 30s.  Plus the drinks are reasonably priced- the margaritas are only $4.But they close the kitchen at 11pm.  Other than that it's totally worth coming here for a happy hour and a bartender therapy session.
2018-10-28,1,The drinks were definitely watered down. My entire group of friends got tipsy at most after we ordered a lot of shots and mixed drinks for the entire night. Otherwise the place was fine.
2018-10-27,1,Service was awful and very slow. Bartender barely looked up from his phone to serve us. More staff came up and could careless about paying customer waiting for a drink. Food was less than mediocre.
2018-10-21,4,Solid spot for some casual pub food in Hoboken. Had the buffalo chicken sandwich which was kind of small, and a shrimp avocado salad which was good but nothing special. Fries were very tasty and service was friendly.
2018-08-23,4,Went here with my boyfriend on a Wednesday night. Got the burgers and wings -exactly what to be expected. Service was a little slow. Overall good spot.
2018-07-22,1,Walked into Black Bear for the first time with my friend yesterday afternoon and headed upstairs for the bar. The bartender said hello as we grabbed seats but that was about it. We sat there for about 10 mins and we never got any service she seemed occupied with her friends at the bar. Mmmmkkk so we head down stairs and try our luck at the bar there.The bartender comes over (white woman long black hair) and asked what we were  ordering. Now this is our first time at this establishment so we aren't sure what we wanted to get. I noticed a sign outside that stated $5 cocktails so I asked her about them. "That's not until tonight."...... umm ok. So what's a popular cocktail you guys have? "I dont know everything's good." Ummmm ok. Can I have a Long Island? "We don't make that here." Ummm OK.My friend asked about the beer selection and she was also rude and short to him as well. Now the two other patrons sitting on either side of us got a completely different person she was very kind to them. Between ignoring us she also had time to play crosswords With the guy sitting next to me. But couldn't find time to have better customer service skills. We ended up just ordering random drinks just to have something. Drinks were not even good. Mine was watered down. We really wanted to leave and take our business elsewhere since we clearly were not welcomed but since we had already ordered we decided to stay just for that one drink. I have an opinion as to why we were ignored but I'll just leave this at WE WILL NEVER RETURN.
2018-07-22,3,Eh, service was sub par. Food was sub par.  Not much I can or want to say about this place. Maybe it was an "off" day.
2018-07-15,1,This place has a dress code. No ripped pants and nothing camo. My boyfriend was wearing camouflage shorts, which he wears because he likes the style, and they turned us away. So we couldn't eat at the restaurant. They should have a sign that tells customers that. Oh well, won't be going here !
2018-07-11,1,Do not use your bank card here unless you want to have extra charges placed on your card. They will write in their own tip amount and charge your card whatever they choose. My bill was 41.46 and a 20 % tip would have been $8 20. Under the tip section I wrote "on table" and wrote 41.46 and signed my name. I left $10 with my bill. They ran it thru my bank as 41.46 and then the next day changed it to 49.66 I called them and they said it was their mistake and I would be refunded the money to my card in 2 to 3 days. A week later I call back only to be told I must have written $8 on my bill and that's why they charged me and if I wanted my $8 back I could make the 4 hour drive there to pick it up. Use cash only if you go.
2018-06-24,5,Perfect place to watch any game. There are many TV screens in the restaurant plus the food was yummy.
2018-06-06,1,Wow, the staff at this place has really lost track of who the customer is, Who actually pays the bills! I've been going here since 1999 and today's experience was dismal.We arrived at about 10, and no one was outside, so I asked the doorman who asked the hostess if it was ok that we sit outside and have a drink. They said yes but only until 11 and we couldn't get food and there was no hostess service so we had to get our own beers.  Sounded ok, we knew the rules so I went in and got drinks and brought them outside.Then the waitress came out and asked if we wanted anything to eat and why we didn't order the beers with her. I explained the story and she got defensive so I asked to speak with the manager.The manager came out, and from the start it was obvious she has way more responsibility than she can handle and absolutely no people skills. She told us we had to order food if we wanted to stay outside or that we must go inside. I really want hungry so now we had to go inside.I've always believed in business if you make a mistake you have to own it, it's the honorable way. So two of her staff made a mistake and she was too weak to own it! She could have just said we made a mistake, please finish your beer and come inside if you want another one. Instead she acted like a power hungry child.I have no idea what the owners see in her!!! Wow guys, no more for me. Sorry for 20 years of patronage.
2018-04-24,4,Great spot to watch sports and get a pint with friends! I got the Philly and it was fantastic, the fries were also incredible. Tip: come on Tuesdays for Yuengling and wings night!
2018-04-23,4,Come here Sunday for an early dinner around 6pm- we sat at a high table near the bar and service was ok. They seemed understaffed and a bit overwhelmed but I'll give a solid 4 stars because they did the best they could and the food was good. Could have been hotter but overall ok! We ordered the chimichurri steak, pulled pork sliders and the grilled cheese. Prices are reasonable  and we all liked our food. Can't say I'd run back but if you are in the area and looking for bar food this location is convenient!
2018-03-19,1,Don't go at night if you're a person of color. Went this passed Saturday night and all of the bartenders refused to help my friends and I, who were literally right in front of the bar with money in hand. They ignored us completely. One bartender even started to clean up around us instead of asking our order. But when a group of guys walked up behind us ready to order, then I guess they were the only ones visible to the bartenders as one of them rushed to take their order. Will never go back here. Even on their best day
2018-03-09,5,Great place to get a cold beer and some good food. The turkey burger wrap is bomb and so are the boneless wings. The vibe is low key and casual/comfortable. This is mine and my boyfriend's go-to whenever we're in Hoboken.
2018-02-16,4,Good happy hour, fun bar. Chicken fingers had way too much breading, but overall fun place.
2018-02-11,5,Not to be confused with the other BBB (Big Ball Brand), the Black Bear Bar is the place to be for a Saturday (which are for the boys) Fun Day. From the hundreds of TVs, Saturday drink specials, and sports memorabilia hanging in the rafters BBB has it all! Upon walking in you're over taken by the massive wall of TVs that displays 10+ different sporting events. I NEED this in my apartment.Drinks to snag on Saturday's:-The Manmosa (champagne, vodka, OJ, AND blue moon). I had 3 and was feeling nice. Not sure why they add the Blue Moon, but the taste resembled a regular mimosa. ($7)-Regular Mimosa ($5)-Blue Moon ($5)Where can you get the above specials on a Saturday? I'll wait...NO WHERE! We'll be back just for these specials during March Madness. Good we snagged:-Side of fires ($7) -Spinach and Artichoke dip w/chips (~$8) Can't mess up the above food, but it was tasty! We've heard great things about their wings and things, so we'll also be back for those.
2017-12-31,4,One of the increasingly few Hoboken bars that is still open since I first came to Hoboken 15 years ago.  Despite the seemingly never ending array of trendy "sports" bar opening, Black Bear has managed to stay relevant.  Good space and vibe.  Food is solid for a bar menu.  Only complaint was no game sound, but if you are looking for a comfortable place to casually watch sports and hang out with friends, this is a good option.
2017-11-28,5,Very nice place. Good music selection and enough space to party on 2 levels. I went pretty late being my second stop in Hoboken so wasn't able to try food but still enjoyed myself. The bartenders were good and drinks were worth the money.. Black bear is on the list of places to revisit!!
2017-11-22,4,A very solid bar to visit. I enjoyed their beer selection and was pleased when I asked our bartender to explain the difference between some choices and was helpful in making recommendations. It's one of the more mature bars in Hoboken so if you're looking for a calmer vibe than Green Rock or Tally-Ho, this is the place to go to.
2017-11-05,3,Limited vegetarian food (basically, very wet nachos), and beer soaked floors. If you can walk up four blocks, go to Bareburger for a much cleaner and happier dining experience.
2017-10-16,3,The pizza was a good very thin crust pizza; the buffalo mac n cheese was very good; the sliders were good especially with the upgrade to the large onion rings. Service was friendly and quick. Prices reasonable.
2017-10-01,1,Great bar. Horrible food. Small wings, over cooked French fry ENDS. Why are you serving the end of the French fry bag? DO NOT EAT THIS FOOD
2017-09-18,4,Great place to get dinner and a drink. Unfortunately their drink specials didn't apply if you sat outside, which was a little frustrating but we sat outside anyways because it was really nice out. We got the cajun shrimp wrap and the grilled cheese which were both really good and their prices are very reasonable. Definitely will be back to try some more things off their menu!
2017-09-15,4,Very solid bar menu. All the classics plus some. I was really impressed with their grilled shrimp wrap with the house ranch dressing, which I was pleasantly surprised to find wasn't normal ranch dressing. The service was attentive and the outdoor patio was a great bonus. The table next to us got the nachos and they also looked incredible. Only downside was that you couldn't get the draft beer happy hour specials unless you were eating inside, which I don't understand why that would remotely matter as they have the same menus.
2017-09-02,5,This was the first time I ever went into this place and at first I was little sketchy I thought that people were a little bit young and I didnt fit in but I went upstairs and it was a great DJThe bartenders were very niceThe music was very good and we had a lot of fun there we took the bartenders advice on having her special lemonade with blueberry Vodka and we stayed for two drinks. We were able to dance like retards to old school hip hop and we had a nice time I would definitely recommend- it was a lot better than the other shit holes around the area
2017-09-02,1,I like the place but when the bartender tells you they are open until 3:00 AM and it's a lie and then she says you only have :15 minutes to take your last drink before you close cause everyone gets kicked out at 2:30 but the bouncer comes to you at 2.15 AM saying that you have to leave and that you are NOT allow to go and PISS.... I even think this is against human rights!! Find another place !! Screw these wanna be!!
2017-08-26,5,Tuesday's specials are great!  A bucket of delicious buffalo wings and pitcher of Yueling's beer are spectacular.  Nobody can beat them.  Over 50 TV's to watch sports all over the place.  Prices are very reasonable. I definitely would recommend it.
2017-08-25,1,The biggest racial place in downtown HobokenThis place has trained everyone from their security to their servers and bar renders to be racial. They treat people like they are millionaires who want to stop people coming into this place. I am done with this place and will be filing a complaint for racial discrimination against them. Please avoid at all costs
2017-08-17,1,Andrea was not the best , she had an attitude when we arrived matter a fact she didn't even approach us. she was at the other end of the bar in a deep convo . Gave me and my friends an attitude when we wanted a drink . I didn't even get a drink because I didn't want the first ingredient to be an attitude.
2017-08-15,3,I have been to Black Bear a couple of times. The place gets really crowded on weekends. The crowd is usually college kids (weekends). I have gone recently to a trivia night and it was a lot of fun. I think during the week the crowd is more mid 20s early 30s. I recommend going for happy hour and trivia night. This bar has an upstairs and downstairs, both floors have a bar. Their sliders are delicious! They have great service. The music is ok, a wide rang of genres.
2017-07-11,3,Update: 3. 1 year later ASG ( its sentimental at this point) Reminder:  yr 1 was a total failYr 2 was a redemption along with watching trump surprise the world (I'm going to be here for his impeachment hearings) This is yr 3So. What to do when you get no plates or water?  You use the bucket as a garbage until they take it away and you yell until you get a plate since asking doesn't work. Seriously, this ain't your first wing night rodeo. Plates and waters to start.  Please.  Food came out quick and was fine. Service and the small things made this a 3 instead of 4.
2017-06-28,1,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Was in Hoboken for a paint and sip event at artevino (amazing place) with my 15,16, 4 year old nieces and my aunt. Decided we would grab a quick bite to eat and sit outside since of course they are underage and it was great weather out. Asked the bouncer at the door if we could eat outside, he said it was fine but to tell the hostess. Advised the hostess got my menus and sat down. Time was 10 o clock pm, at 1030 one of the workers says we have to go inside because the outside area needs to be closed, I advised him I had just ordered my food, we would eat and head out. 5 minutes later my food arrives and so does the hostess to tell me they will be grabbing my food to bring it inside. I told her the kids were under 21 and at this point we had a sleeping 4 year old, just wanted to finish my food and leave she says okay and leaves. Minutes later the bus boy arrives Says we have to go inside now, again explained they are underage, and I have a sleeping 4 year old. Finally the manager comes out and says we have to go inside or leave. So I decided to leave the food I couldn't even finish half or enjoy because I was busy telling EVERY WORKER that I would be leaving as soon as I was able to finish my food. Manger said fine, no apology, nothing... just FINE. They should have told me when I first asked to eat outside that they close the outside at a certain time, I would have said okay that's by enough time for me to enjoy a meal and found another place to eat.
2017-06-09,5,Having an amazing evening. Watching NBA finals, crowd is polite, friendly and good. Game rocks but the DJ (who appears short, bald and 30's) is kicking the crap out of the tunes at every commercial, every break and I'd rather come here than see Tiesto or Avicii in a mega club Food ok, drinks decent, bartenders rock. Hoboken rocks.
2017-04-01,2,Standard bar scene, but honestly, the bartenders are completely unfriendly. And I'm really not picky... they're just nasty bad attitude
2017-03-20,4,Amazing wings and plenty of TVs to watch the games.
2017-01-21,4,$14 for a bucket of 30 wings and a pitcher of beer...this is highway robbery in a good way ;) Tuesdays is the time to take advantage of this.
2017-01-14,1,Bartenders were the worst bartenders i have ever dealt with. Will never be returning to this establish. Rude workers would be the only way to explain this establishment.
2017-01-08,4,This is an awesome place to watch football. They have great food and friendly service. When in Hoboken be sure to check it out.
2016-12-29,1,I had patronized a number of establishments in Hoboken (I live in Jersey City), and this was by far the worst experience I have had.  The bartender was totally unfriendly from start to finish during the time I ordered a beer and calamari.  I had never felt so unwelcome in what is purported to be a welcoming establishment.  Even more unfortunate, since I was the only person of color on the premises, I cannot help but think that being African-American was a factor in the treatment I experienced.   I usually provide a tip even when I find the service less than optimal.  However, I could not summon the grace to do so today.  Suffice it to say that I will not patronize this establishment anytime soon.
2016-11-05,1,This review is for parents who are strolling around Hoboken with their little ones and might want to change up their scene with a nice, management-friendly bar and grill.  THIS IS NOT THAT PLACE. If you have kids just stamp yourselves as not welcome. My husband went in with our 1 year old during the day while he was waiting for me at the hair salon. He wanted to order a drink and maybe an app. No one came over for a while. Finally, a lady came over and, without even asking him if he needed anything, told him he couldn't bring in outside food. He was feeding our daughter out of a small soup to-go cup!  He asked her if it was ok if he fed her from the little pouches that baby food comes in - she said NO!I don't understand their issue but either way, if you are a parent and think that other parents need to stick together  - screw this place!!  If they do let you feed your baby with your own baby food then maybe that's even worse and they just had a problem with my husband and child.
2016-10-27,5,Love this place to watch sports. They have huge tvs and plenty of them. the service is always good. I've been here numerous amount of times and never had a complaint! Definitely recommend!
2016-09-24,4,One of the best places to watch football on a Sunday. Good food and drinks specials. The one downside was the wait for a table during the games.
2016-09-08,5,Ate here not to long ago after Carlo's bakery & the Food wasn't that bad, service was great & so was our waitress! For got to get the waitress name, but she kept checking on us to make sure we were satisfied. We need more like her. Our greeter on the other hand had a nasty attitude when we first got there, we need less of her. Other than that the food was amazing. Loved it!
2016-09-06,3,This is probably a great place to go at night for a game and have a few drinks.  Unfortunately, I stopped in for lunch and couldn't do any of that.  I loved the look of the bar, the atmosphere, and the huge TV's.  The place was practically empty for lunch.  We sat outside and was able to people watch.  I had the turkey club with fries and my co-worker had the chicken club with fries.  My turkey club was dry and didn't have much bacon.  I've had better.  The fries were tasty but looked like the kitchen hadn't changed the oil in the fryer because they came out a dark bronze.  My co-worker thought there wasn't enough chicken in his club.  He claimed he didn't have any bacon.  Same deal with his fries.  Service was good and friendly.  I would go back but probably just order something else.  Maybe this time a few pops!
2016-09-03,3,Quick review: don't get the turkey club - awful dried out turkey that might be from last thanksgiving . Otherwise good place - nice service. Friendly bartenders. Just don't order the turkey club !!! They asked if I wanted a box I was polite and said no thank you but I wanted to laugh!
2016-08-05,4,Such an amazing place but bartenders are hit or miss... Great wings and huge tvs. Love Hoboken
2016-08-03,4,Place does what it's meant to do- cheap beer and food at decent quality for a decent price. Outdoor seating is great in the summer. I recommend it for a post work happy hour!
2016-07-28,4,This place is the ish! The first thing you notise when you get to here is the yoked bouncer..he is jacked but I wasn't worried bc he looks like he lacks the core strength to block my Kendo movements. The 2nd thing is a huge carved Indian statue that lets you know you can get authentic Indian food here. They are serious they had Black Bear Sliders, Black Bear CHili and Black Bear Notchos. I don't eat ethnic or hunting food bc I tried vennisson 1nce when I was little and then I got chicken pox but my dude Danny said Black Bear tasted like chopped meat. There are crazy hotties here. The hot girls from my home town come here bc they are to scared to go to NYC so this is like their fancy NYC bar for people from The Fallz. Allot of other towns' hotties come here to. I guess chicks like Indian food. Hey, if she is willing to put Bear in her mouth/
2016-06-28,4,I have been here quite a few times over the years. Mainly at night. However, I have been coming here more often recently with some people I play softball with after our games on Monday afternoons.  Overall, it's a very nice bar. During the day, they offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The bartenders both day and night have always been extremely friendly, attentive and quick to serve. They have a decent craft beer selection and the prices are very reasonable. During happy hour they offer half priced appetizers and $3 draft beer which can't be beat. The food here is ok. Satisfying bar food. As a warning- DO NOT get the spiciest wings on the menu---you will regret it and will not enjoy it simply because of how painful it is to even taste the sauce. I have seen grown men complaining even hours after taking a bite.The mild wings are good-I usually enjoy those. The turkey club is a little on the dry side so I wouldn't suggest it--however it does come with crispy bacon. They have two floors with plenty of places to sit during the day. They have a bunch of TVs and one really big one on the main floor. Perfect to watch any sport event on. At night, it can get a little hectic, especially on the weekends. Hard to move around like many of the other bars in Hoboken but overall I have always had a good time and always considered this bar a great choice when I am in town.
2016-05-26,4,I stopped in here this past weekend with a large group for drinks. The stand out feature here is their 25 foot wall of televisions behind the bar. This would definitely be a good spot to come and catch games. There's also an upstairs with a second bar. While it did get crowded, we never felt squeezed in which was nice. They have a decent beer selection at relatively decent prices - I was happily surprised to see Fat Tire on tap. They have some pretty good deals depending on the night that you're there, it's always worth asking. We were all happy here and enjoyed it. I'd for sure come back.
2016-05-25,1,I came here one night when I was in town visiting my best friend just after my 21st birthday. We enjoyed the drinks and atmosphere so we decided to stop in one last time before I left. but unfortunately the SAME EXACT GUY who IDed me at the door the first night denied my entry claiming "my ID was fake". Total bullshit. Never thought I'd have to worry about getting denied with a REAL ID.
2016-05-22,5,Fantastic burgers with awesome menmosas! Great understanding of gradations Medium raw - medium well in meats!
2016-04-20,4,Sunday funday in April - day well spent walking around HobokenWith my boyfriend.. We stoppedIn for $6dollarSangrias ! They were really good ! Make sure to stop in.
2016-04-03,5,I've been coming to black bear for sometime and their food has never disappointed me. But yesterday I finally decided to try something other then my usual Southern BBQ wrap (which is literally heaven) and I figured I'd let people know of the amazing meal I had.So they had an "extraordinary burger" on their specials menu which was described as a bacon cheeseburger between two grilled cheeses...I didn't even understand how that could even be a thing....BUT IT WAS. It was that kind of meal you always dreamed of but feel too embarrassed to show the world what kind of fatty you are to order it....butttt I put my pride aside and I let my heart order and I have never been so pleased. Although I limited myself to only eating half of it in fear of having an instant grease heart attack, the bacon was perfectly crisp, the grilled cheese were cheesy and toasty and the burger was cooked to my perception of perfection. But if you're not down with your inner fatty just yet, the wings, nachos, and hoboken burger (also very amazing) are all great!
2016-03-25,3,I love restaurants with outdoor seating, it's much more inviting especially now that the weather is keeping up! I just wanted to get a quick bite to eat - I've been here for drinks but not their food, so I decided to stop by with my boyfriend. We sat outdoor, seated and was served waters quickly. Our server was great, no complaints there. I had an issue with my food though; I had the original burger with sweet potato fries ($1.99 add'l) and we shared hot wings. The wings were nothing spectacular. The burger was extremely bland. The fries were really bad. I'd come back for drinks but I didn't enjoy the food that much :(
2016-03-06,2,Nicely laid out bar, lots of tvs and high ceilings. Came in on Saturday for a quick drink while waiting on a table in Charritos. $44 dollars for 4 shots (yikes!) No itemized receipt and was refused fairly abruptly when I asked for one. Won't be in a rush back.
2016-03-05,1,Background information: I went here with a group of about 10 during the st Patrick's day weekend festivities. We paid $20 per person cover to enter which is a bit steep but whatever we paid it. We didn't expect to pay $10 for an 8oz bud light after paying $20 per person to enter. That was incredibly high and taking advantage of people. For a bar that never charges a cover besides on special days like this, charging $10 for a small beer is ridiculous. We got $3 beers at the Ainsworth earlier in the day. In my opinion, if you are charging that much to enter the bar, you should have discounted drinks when you enter.
2016-02-08,2,Went there for the Super Bowl and would not do it again.  They had the music so loud you could barely have a conversation and played music right up to the beginning of the game and during commercials.  No pregame commentary and isn't half the fun of watching the Super Bowl is to see the commercials?And the food was awful.  The wings were well overdone and the rest of food was subpar, I am glad the waitress never delivered the sliders I ordered.  Could have been made up by good service but the waitress clearly did not care, not a smile, infrequently checked on us.  They have a lot of tvs but what place doesn't these days.
2016-01-28,4,Great spot for watching live sports! TVs everywhere. Food-wise... Typical mediocre sports bar. Great happy hour deals though- bucket of wings and pitcher of ying for for $25, ladies night, etc. One of my favorite spots to watch baseball/football with a big group!
2016-01-25,2,I am pretty much over this place the food is mediocre at best draft selection is weak the service is spotty. Can't find a reason to come here anymore.
2016-01-25,5,Their Cajun chicken sandwich is awesome. I get that every single time. Just wish it came with more fries. Manmosas are great too.
2016-01-21,3,Food is okay. $18 isn't really happy hour specials. The drinks are like 2$ 3$ 4$ but the HH entrees are just entrees regularly priced taken off the regular menus and added to the HH menu. There were a lot of random fruit flys at our table which was annoying. Our waitress was nice which is the two stars and my glass of Pinot gets one star overall not sure if I would go back- definitely better places on Washington for HH. This bars is fun on weekends though not really for a nice meal.
2016-01-15,5,Honestly. Simply. The. Best. Could not ask for a better sports bar in Hoboken. Great food as well. Black bear 4 life
2016-01-07,3,Black bear used to be my go to spot.... in the recent times, it's fallen further and further down the list.  Reason being - their menu now has been pared down to fewer options and the food just is mediocre at this point.  Often, my friends and I find ourselves unsatisfied after we finish our "meals."  They used to have filling pastas and better sandwiches/wraps. and now it basic mac & cheese, burgers, wings being offered. On the bright side, they still have  Tuesday Wing bucket & Pitcher of Beer Special for $19.99 -- I miss the days when they used to charge $12.99 for this special, but $20 still isn't a bad deal.  *Pro tip - don't get the boneless wings here, they are pretty abysmal. They also have trivia on Wednesday nights.  I'm a sucker for trivia. Table service here is still really on point. =) It's still a fantastic place to go when you don't need good eats.  Tons of TVs on both floors, and the bartenders can definitely pour draft beer and open bottles like the best of them.
2016-01-07,4,Probably my favorite sports bar in Hoboken (1 Republik a few doors down is a close second), but something about the wall of TVs and slightly better food, notably the fries, in my opinion, puts Black Bear at the top of my list.In fairness to 1 Republik, there aren't as many draft options here as there are there, and I usually find the service more pleasant down the street than I do here.The only part that sucks, as with all businesses on Washington, is the parking. Unless you can get something on one of the side or back streets, be prepared to feed the meter or pay for the garage.
2016-01-06,4,This is my go-to for football on Sundays - they have tons of TVs including the central TV board behind the bar (local games on a huge central TV with a rim of smaller TVs with games from all around the league). The drink specials are decent for this area ($4 beers, $5 manmosas, $12ish pitchers.As for food, I enjoyed the chicken quesadillas (though they're a little small) and the nachos are pretty typical bar food. The reason for my one fewer star is that during the commercials for local games, they blast random club music from the DJ that can make it tough to hear anything or talk. This, however, is one of the good things about coming there on non gamedays. On Friday/Saturday the music is loud, but the bar is split into the upstairs (which has a dance floor, DJ, louder music) and the downstairs (more of a dive bar scene, quieter and easier to talk). Best of both worlds!
2015-12-20,4,We came here on a Saturday evening to have a couple of drinks, appetizers, and watch the Jets game. Yes! They are closer to the playoffs - 2015! I honestly think this is one of the coolest bars in Hoboken. They have two floors, it gets really loud and crazy by the bar section. A lot of fun though. A very young well behaved crowd. Haha!The eating/sitting section is towards the back which is more reserved. Just enjoy the music, watch your favorite sport, grab some alcoholic beverages, appetizers, or dinner.We'd ordered the veggie nacho.Yummy and filling for two people.Our waitress was accommodating and revisited our table to ask if everything was okay. Although it was a busy night, the services was pleasant.They have a second floor, I think it's meant for dancing and playing beer pong. Overall I had a great time! Good environment, awesome selection of music, and affordable.
2015-12-08,3,Black Bear looks just like Mills Tavern but with less people. It isn't as crowded and it's much more tolerable. I think I'm getting old because larger crowds annoy me. I really have nothing spectacular to say about this place.They clear out the tables at a certain time to make a makeshift dance floor upstairs. It's a decent spot for a few drinks and some OK bar food. .
2015-11-29,1,Came here to watch Giants and Chargers game when we were in town.  Food was not great. Chicken wings were very dry, game special were not really specials, service was it horrible server that had attitude. Not best place if u are big NFL fan that want to have beer n nicely watch game...great if you are in college, not eating or drinking and looking for social gathering that plays music during game so loud, you feel as if you are in nightclub.I run and consult for many bars nationwide and this place by far needs help.
2015-11-22,4,Came here today to watch the game. Even though there wasn't any water in hoboken (water main break), they were still open and had great service. Food was pretty good - we got their boneless wings (I don't recommend these they're pretty dry and overly cooked), and 2 sandwiches which were on special. Great for football sunday! They have tons of TVs and good beer specials.
2015-11-11,3,Good bar to watch a game. Outside of watching a sporting event, I probably wouldn't come here because of the size of the space and crowd.
2015-10-27,1,I was charged $15 on someone else's tab.  The manager kicked me out and told me it would take 4 days to get my money back.
2015-09-29,3,Of all the times I've been to Black Bear, they've all been for chill and relaxed nights or a daytime hangout spot. And for the most part it's just an in and out type of place. The downstairs area is more for people who just want to talk or watch a few games, and upstairs there's a more secluded area with a bar and a few tables. The bartenders are really sweet and make your time worthwhile espcially if you have a conversation or two with them. Nothing special about the bar, but I still manage to come here every time I'm in Hoboken even if it's just for a few minutes.
2015-09-26,3,Came with a group on Saturday afternoon. The staff was nice... A friend of mine left something on the bar table before we were seated for lunch, and the hostess went through the garbage to find it, which was awesome.They have about 10 beers on tap, which is mediocre for this area, but the Brooklyn Oktoberfest was pretty good.On to lunch... I got the black bear omelette (off the brunch menu), because I really wanted a biscuit. This is why I'm knocking two stars... I was super excited for that biscuit. But it was a hard biscuit. A stale biscuit. You could have hammered a nail with that biscuit. So disappointing. So depressed. Also, the menu says 'home fries,' but what you get is breakfast potatoes. The potatoes were good, for sure, but I was expecting home fries and was just too shocked at the potatoes to enjoy them.That biscuit was just so bad... It will haunt my dreams. The omelette was good by the way. Really good actually. But that biscuit...
2015-09-26,4,Now that it's actually been a descent temperature for a few months thanks to Summer, I had the opportunity to revisit Black Bear a few times since my last review.  I didn't ask to meet up with the manager like he requested (although it was a nice gesture) I still hung out for a bit.  It's still a great place to hang out Downtown.  For my more recent visits, I stick with appetizers - those were always good and the service is a definite plus.  Black Bear is definitely more a nighttime hangout than a place for lunch.  And there's no fault in that...it's a fun place!
2015-09-20,1,9/20/2015 I had the worst service EVER! OUR WAITRESS Vicki was horrible so very rude!
2015-09-10,3,Great place to watch a game. Sliders are always good. Avoid the wings!! Have had them on regular days and when they are on special. So dried out they are hard to eat.
2015-09-06,2,I don't really have anything good to say about this place. The food is mediocre, not bad but not worth the process they charge. The service is hand down the worst service I have ever had and they served me beer in a warm beer glass  (gross) - I would be a little more understanding if they were busy but the restaurant  wasn't even half full. ..
2015-09-05,2,The waitress had no idea what the specials were. We asked for an extra sauce and later we were charged .75 cents each, when I asked for the manager he said its on the menu, when he searched for where it says it,he couldn't find it. Lame. If you want a quick beer it's a fine place, anything else- go elsewhere
2015-08-03,4,When walking around Hoboken for the first time with my dad, we ultimately grew quite hungry. I was on the hunt for a new apartment and the search was obviously not going so well (great realtors in jersey are like finding a needle in a haystack, no offense). This place looked promising and was recommended by one of the above realtors. I ended up getting the ahi tuna wrap, I love ahi and figured -- how bad could it be? I convinced my dad to get the specialty burger so I could just look at it. It had fried egg and onion rings. Overall, I remember the ahi tuna being blackened and spicy but the ahi was dry and rubbery inside, with chewy bits. Um, ew. And my dad barely finished his burger, stopping at one point to put more money in the meter. And usually, he's the person I can feed anything to and he'll scarf it down. The best parts: the French fries and honey mustard, nice staff, and outdoor patio seating for excellent people watching. Before you go, know: it's pub-food.
2015-08-02,2,I was visitng the black bear with my husband on Saturday, August 1, 2015 at around 1130 pm. While we were waiting on the rather long line to get in, I saw the bouncer, a young, tan-skinned man with hair long on the top but shaved on the sides, take a girl's ID and put it in his pocket without letting the girl enter the bar. After she quietly and politely asked for it back and assured that she would not return, his totally inappropriate reply was "You're so beautiful, i'd definitely like to see you come back". The man accompanying the girl assured him that they didn't want trouble and just would like the ID back, the bouncer replied, out in the open, "How much are you going to give me" and to "Make an offer" to get the ID card back. The male friend of the girl made an offer, at which the bouncer laughed at the apparently insufficient amount of money offered. After much discussion, the bouncer refused and the couple left the line. Later, I witnessed two other girls before me in line have their ID's pocketed by the same bouncer, only to get them back and enter the bar after paying the bouncer what looked like over $80. It seems clear that this bouncer was very inappropriate, had no regard for actually keeping under-age people out of the bar, and was also running a business out of his pocket, charging people to get their own property back. Having a young daughter myself I was incredibly disturbed by what I saw last night. Otherwise, this bar is increidbly average. The food was typical mediocre bar food... They have a nice beer selection.
2015-07-18,1,The bar tenders don't know to make a drink...Rum and Coke tastes like plain soda with ice...when asked to fix the drink, bar tenders turn their face away and behave rude..very bad experience with drinks! Never coming back again...
2015-07-15,2,Will NEVER come back!!Last week I went here for quiz night and invited 3 friends.  We arrived around 6:30pm and sat at the bar on a Wednesday.  On July 8th the upstairs bartender served us and was cool.  She was kind and knew the prices of drinks.  However, this week july 15th, 2015 I invited 4 friends and we had a bartender upstairs  that wasn't quite sure of all the prices.  I felt she ordered the things I asked for and I appreciated that.  She did her job.  However, when the check came this bartender made mistakes.  She Mis charged me for certain drinks and when I thought I ordered the "special" shots she charged me for the regular priced shots.  Totally I was overcharged by 25.00.  When I brought it to her attention she fixed a part of it, but did not bring me the itemized bill.  After she brought me the bill I said to my friend, "this Bitch still didn't get it right.  And she didn't.  The Bartender responded, "you are not going to call me bitch multiple times."  My friend explained to her I did not call her bitch multiple times.  I was frustrated that the bill was not correct.  I paid the bill and tipped her 15%, but I will not be back.  This bartender over charged me for the drinks.  She was rude and took us being upset about our bill personally.  Although I enjoy quiz night I do not tolerate bad customer service.  I hope in the future this bartender will understand that anyone will be frustrated if their bill isn't correct and understand that her words may cost the business money.  Then again, I guess she doesn't care.
2015-07-15,3,This place had some really good drink specials for happy hour, but the actual food menu was limited compared to 1 Republik down the street. Oh well, maybe it'll be a fun bar to go to when the night comes around.
2015-07-03,4,Black Bear is a cool bar located on the busy streets of Hoboken. You'll know you're there by the big black bear at the entrance lol.I've visited Black Bear (BB) a few times before but my first time leaving a review. BB has a full bar and a few beers on tap (Stella, Blue Moon) to name a few. My last visit was on Thursday and the drink specials were great. Sat at the bar which I feel is the best since my visit before that I didn't get that attention and service I get at the bar. There is a rule on credit cards so make sure you read that first.Ordered wings & fries which from my experience is always amazing. Hoboken bars can be a bit much on Fridays with the college and local kids who tend to get a lot loud and sometimes a bit ignorant. Not the best spot for a date night or better yet sit up stairs. Thursday is extremely relaxed with the working crowd so you'll enjoy Thursday's.
2015-07-01,2,Cute waitresses! I wish the service was as cute as our waitress was. On a serious note, their signature dish Nachos suck. They did not have either of the 2 beers we wanted. Basically, it was no good. Wouldn't recommend it any day of the year.
2015-06-24,5,One of my favorite bars in Hoboken, hands down! First and foremost let me just say- HAPPY HOUR. If nothing else at least give the happy hour a shot because it is def worth it! I get my $4 glasses of wine and my best friends gets a $4-5 mixed drink. I think beers are 3 or 4 bucks as well! Anyways-the happy hour food menu is also awesome because theyre basically 2 for 1..soooo we order the boneless buffalo chicken bites which are always delicious and spicy (though can always be a bit hotter temperature wise) as well as the mac and cheese which is AWESOME. The combo of these 2 bar bites just works with the spicyneas of the buffalo bites and the warm rich taste of the mac and cheese-they are a perfect pair! We usually wind up ordering the same thing twice during happy hour-thats how good it is! Weve also tried the mini pizza they have which is very thin crust and tasty! The regar wings are great too especially when they have their bucket of wings with a pitcher of beer special for 20 bucks-cant beat it! The sliders here are also amazing-this bar has really awesome bar food which is super important for me beause all I want to do when drinking is eat! As for the bar itself, i love the music that plays during happy hour-a reallt good mix (not just a typical top 40 type of playlist). The upstairs area is great for watching games with all of the tvs. They run different specials daily which you can keep up with on instagram! Overall, a great bar esp for happy hour.
2015-05-30,3,Pretty decent food and hands down the best place to watch Rangers hockey as they mic up the games (at least for the playoffs). However the staff can be a bit pushy and demanding of party size for seating so make sure your group number is in order before coming.
2015-05-30,3,I've always passed by Black Bear but never went in to eat, until this past Memorial Day. I was excited for their wings because that's what everyone always raves about. I ordered the wings and sweet potato fries and my husband ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and the buffalo chicken wrap. He said the wrap was good but the Mac and cheese was awesome! Which it truly was. The wings were mediocre. Idk if it were just mine but they were hard and over cooked. I'll go back just for the Mac and cheese. And they're sweet potato fries were good too not soggy at all they were nice and crispy but the Mac and cheese was definitely the star of the show!
2015-05-14,4,We started off with the kick-ass make your own Bloody Mary bar. I especially excited by this feature. If you don't know how they work - basically you get a glass of ice and vodka, then you're free to add your own mixes and fixes. Here at Black Bear you get a pint glass and it's seasoned with a spicy mixture. I opted for pineapple habanero hot sauce while my other half went heavy on the horseradish.For food we ordered the Taylor Ham (link in case you aren't familiar with this Jersey delicacy), egg and cheese on a kaiser roll and a side of French onion soup. You might think this is an odd mixture, but it was windy out and the soup hit the spot. Actually it was one of the better french onions we have had and the sandwich was definitely on point.We always look for more in a bartender than being an epic drink-slinger and our new friend Michelle fit the bill. Since we are so comfortable at bar stools, it's always nice to feel like you're hanging out. Michelle is a Jameson drinker - so that automatically makes her cool in our book. She also is rooting for Manny Pacquiao in the big fight coming up, so we got to talk some sports.What was most impressive to us about this spot is the bar specials. They have specials every single day and they are actually enticing (we plan to come back for the bucket of wings and pitcher of Yuengling for $20 on Tuesdays). A lot of bars in Hoboken tend to get reputations for rowdy college crowds, so if you like your elbow room, we suggest going early for lunch and hitting up the awesome happy hours. But if you like doing body shots off a stranger and chugging beers in a packed bar with hunting props, this could be your spot too!If you check out Black Bear on Yelp you will see a lot of misspelled whining - mostly over things that could be avoided. If you don't want a crowded, noisy bar, you should know what times to go out in Hoboken; it's not exactly trigonometry. We love how the manager Ben responds to the typical Yelp warriors just looking to complain and even invites them to come back - cheers Ben!
2015-05-12,4,Great happy hour!  Try some bingo and mac cheese.  There's a good selection of beers on tap.  Crowd is nice for a happy hour after work crew.  Definitely a beer location.
2015-05-10,3,I ordered the extreme burger and it was really good. Its a huge burger patty sandwiched between two grilled cheese! It comes with fries too. Great service and place to hang out with friends
2015-05-03,5,Great place with a vibrant buzz all nights...good selections of beers at amazing prices...food was good too...will be a frequent...
2015-04-18,3,Hit this place up during my siblings bar crawl while I was visiting. Pretty standard Hoboken bar on Washington...good amount of TVs for sports and a solid pint selection. We were even able to score some free Bud Lights (as well as shirts and a hat) due to a promotion they were having in the bar. I didn't get any food, but if I was in the neighborhood again, I'd probably make a stop here.
2015-04-14,5,Great Food, Good service and good atmosphere . Ask for Deanna to be your server . She provides great service .
2015-04-14,3,Never left a negative post, but had to start here. Came here with a couple of friends for a nice lunch. We split 2 apps (buff chick shrimp and spinach and artichoke dip.) Our waitress' tude was as bland as the food, leaving us with awful service. Anyway... Food: The buffalo shrimp came out cold with 6 pieces of baby shrimp (pretty shrimpy for the price) and our spinach and artichoke dip came out all mozzarella, and barely any spinach NOR artichokes! Our chips came out drenched in grease. When I asked for new chips, the waitress brought us a new basket of greasier chips. Friend got buff chick wrap and was unimpressed. Anyway, since this is a bar, happy hour is probably decent, hence the 3 out of 2 stars, but I won't be coming back here for a bite to eat anytime soon.
2015-04-12,4,A great night spot!Some friends and I stopped in here Friday night, 4/10 for drinks/beers after dinner.This bar has a fantastic draft list, multiple TVs, and very clean bathrooms. My bartender Yvette (according to my receipt) was quick to refill my beers and make suggestions. I had a wonderful time at this bar and look forward to returning on my next trip to Hoboken.PLEASE NOTE: This bar does NOT take Discover card. I would encourage the owners (whom I see read these reviews) to reconsider this policy in the future.Otherwise, this is a great place to visit if you're in Hoboken!
2015-04-06,3,Just wanted to note that if you go with a big group they are going to add 20% tip automatically. I don't mind them adding a tip but to automatically add 20% is pretty wild. We would have left that amount but to force us to that... What if the service was bad? And I'm pretty sure they didn't even tell us so luckily we saw that.But yes, the wings are amazing, best ever.
2015-03-29,1,I came here for brunch on 3.29.15 and saw the biggest roach I've ever seen in my life.... Apparently said roach had gotten here earlier and got a seat right next to mine... Management was great about it and comped our drinks but I couldn't eat there. Where there is one there's bound to be more.
2015-03-05,3,Stopped in here for a quick beer before catching a plane. It's in a great location (very close to the Hudson), on the corner, has sports on the tube, and a decent drink selection. I didn't eat so I can't comment on that, but I will say that I wasn't thrilled about the beer selection. Being from North Carolina where every bar is loaded with some of the best craft and local brews in the country, I was bummed to see beers like Molson on tap. I mean, Molson?
2015-02-27,1,ALERT: PARENTS DO NOT BRING YOUR KIDS HERE!!!!!!I've been coming here for years for their wing special on Tuesday, it used to be better but our kids love the bucket so we bring them even though they hiked up the price 4 bucks. NOT after tuesday two weeks ago. We sat down to have our usual bucket of wings in the back room, which is where I think they stick people with kids, when a waitress covered with tattoos and a nose ring started going on about, excuse the language, anal sex with her boyfriend and how she videotapes it. My kids are 4 and 6. Do you know what they've been repeating for the past two weeks? "Mommy what's anal sex? Mommy, mommy, what's anal sex?" I don't even have words to describe the humiliation and frustration I feel as a parent when these words are coming out of my CHILDREN. This is what my kids are picking up at a *restaurant*?! What kind of insensitive people do you have working here?!Granted, at first we thought maybe she didn't see us back there, but even when the other blonde waitress told her to keep it down because there were kids back there, her response was, "oh who cares, they should mind their business" and laughed it off. Excuse us, but it's kind of hard to "mind our business" with you broadcasting your "business" to the whole restaurant. When I got up to go to the bathroom, she seemed pretty hush while I walked by, but just kept on at it as soon as i was back at the table. We packed up our leftovers and left to eat them at home, and we've found another wing spot since uptown.This place used to be a bit more family welcoming, and a whole lot classier. Great food, and the waitress taking care of us was fantastic and polite, but unless you're okay with your kids listening to and picking up curse words and lewd filth for the duration of your meal, take them elsewhere, or make sure Antonia is far, far away.
2015-02-25,3,3.5 stars Happy Hour Deals are AWESOME!!There were 4 hungry people.  Came during happy hour (on a Tuesday night) Ordered a Bucket of Chicken Wings that comes with a Pitcher of YuengLinig Beer ($ 20.00)  (OR Coors Light as an alternative). They give you ONE choise of sauce for the wings, We tried the Atomic Flavor since the Waitress recommends, it was Licking Finger Good! (Sweet and Spicy mix flavor that makes you want to lick the sauce that is in  your finger).   The Chicken wings comes about 20-25 pcs.  They are medium size Wings (Smaller than the Buffalow Wild Wings or any Wing places, but can't go wrong with the price).  Aside from the Specials, I gave it a try their Crunchy Mac and Cheese dish ($ 8.99).  The Crunchy part was made out of Doritos chips, Cheesy on the top, creamy on the bottom.  It was Delicious.  (If you want spicier they also had the Buffalo chicken Mac and Cheese for the same price).Sliders here looked pretty legit (My friend ordered it).  Came with a side of Fries, 4 mini sliders ($ 11.99).There is TV all over the place, good to watch the games with a group of buddies. Service is attentive - But when she gets super busy make sure to get her attention (She'll look around to check sometimes).
2015-01-26,3,I'm not inpressed. Notes:We came on Monday night when Blizzard Juno was in town and there was only one waitress running the whole floor - she did an exceptional job for a one woman show.- Our wings were terrible. Dry. Tasted like they were fried earlier that day and reheated (microwaved) right before they were served to us. I'm jus assuming because inside was a lot hotter. - Fries were soggy, soaked in all the meat sauce. Overall, mediocre to just bad food. Friendly, hard working staff and YAY BEER!
2015-01-26,4,After a long day of pub crawling, this was a great spot to stop and refuel on some carbs. We were seated quickly for a Saturday night and our server was super friendly. Food came out quickly and my chili-cheese fries were divine. My cohorts both had the sliders, which I of course sampled/stole, and they were super juicy. I do intend to return!
2015-01-26,1,Terrible experience and I will never go back. Did not let me in cause I only had my foreign drivers license
2015-01-25,4,The black bear is a great sports bar to watch a game and grab a beer.   Their bucket of wings r delicious as well especially on a Tuesday where u get a bucket of wings and a pitcher of beer for $25    They have great daily specials.  Lots of tvs.
2015-01-24,3,This place is a consistent 3 star joint. The place is primarily a sports bar, but at nighttime on the weekends they tend to have a DJ, which turns the place into a dance bar. The food is decent and the service is decent.
2015-01-15,2,I've been to Black Bear many times since I've lived in Hoboken the past few years.  It's your average Hoboken sports bar, a million TV's, not great, but not terrible bar food, and drink specials.  During the week they have some good specials.  Basically a 3 star place.  The reason I'm giving it two stars is the last time I went I had to wait in line for 10 minutes while it was 15o outside, so that they could make the place look like it was packed.  I guess that's normal bar technique, but the fact that we were waiting in front of the huge windows in front allowed us to see there was more than enough room inside.  I've been to this place so many times, and know that it was no where near capacity.  There was more than enough standing room downstairs and even a few open tables directly to the left when we walked in.  One of which we took.  Real bullshit move.
2014-12-21,1,I thought I liked Black Bear...I wanted to, but when you let incompetent, brainless people run your business, you get bad results. I was in Black Bear minding my own business and having an ok time dancing when apparently I danced too close to some incredibly sensitive and stuck up ladies. Never touched or bumped them, but apparently breathing the air within five feet of them was enough to have them start yelling at me to move and get lost. I proceeded to ignore them and told them I had no reason to listen to them since I was doing nothing wrong, and their response was to come get in my face and choke me. When I removed the hand from my neck, security came and of course immediately believed the girls were the victims, because how could a group of ladies ever be in the wrong? I decided it wasn't worth the argument and said I would leave no problem--I just wanted my coat. The security guard asserted that I could not get my coat and that I had to wait outside (in 35 degrees) without my coat until he went back and got it. I still cooperated. I was escorted outside like a petty criminal, and then gave extremely explicit directions to where my coat was and what it looked like. After five minutes, the guard returned....with the wrong coat. I still cooperated. I told the guy at the door wearing a scarf over his mouth what happened and he less than eagerly called the guard back to the door. He took the other person's coat they gave me and simply threw it on the ground next to the door. When the guard came back to the door I again told him exactly where it was and he said he looked everywhere and that it wasn't there. I then asked if I could simply walk with him to the spot where it was and check. I was told no. Instead, the Black Bear's senseless, intolerable grunts at the door decided to berate me and get belligerent because I told them it was unacceptable to have me stand like a bozo in the freezing cold because they were too clueless to find my coat. I then had Ben (the "bigshot" with a headset) come tell me that I should leave, go to Dunkin Donuts, and come back in the morning for it. All the while as this was happening I was being repeatedly demeaned and treated like a lower class citizen with arrogant remarks like "I wouldn't let this happen to me, so I don't feel bad you don't have a coat" and "I wouldn't let a girl choke me so that's your problem." Big Boy Ben eventually notified me that it was pointless that I was still waiting because no one would look for my coat at this point, and that I wouldn't be allowed in. Finally, the other big bouncer decided he had enough of me losing my patience while slowly succumbing to frostbite, and decided getting right in my face and telling me to "get the **** out of here" was the next best solution.After 30 MINUTES, I then decided to take matters into my own hands. I called the Hoboken police and explained what happened. They weren't thrilled to be wasting their time with such garbage (I don't blame them), but guess what? They escorted me inside Black Bear, I went to where I said my coat was, and sure enough it was right where I left it. In the end I prevailed, but not before getting a thorough understanding of the utter failure and embarrassment that is Black Bear Bar & Grill.
2014-12-18,4,An awesome lunch option- try the grilled Cajun chicken sandwich. Easily one of the best places in Hoboken to relax and grab a beer.
2014-12-15,3,I've been to Black Bear several times, but this past time was the first time I actually tried their food. It was as expected: typical American bar food.Their menu wasn't very large, but they had a separate "Specials" menu (which I didn't order from). I wound up getting the Buffalo Chicken Bites appetizer which was crunchy strips of fried chicken with your choice of sauce. I had the sauce on the side so it was perfect to dip in the hot sauce. They were crunchy which I liked and the Hot Buffalo sauce was nice and spicy. My friend had the Mac and Cheese with Doritos. It was Mac and Cheese topped with cheese Doritos and then topped with more cheese. If you like Doritos, I'm sure you'll like this dish. The Doritos added a cool crunch to the Mac and Cheese. This bar is definitely a fun nightlife bar for Hoboken; it's two levels that are split up with different crowds. On weekend nights, upstairs is more for dancing and downstairs is more for mingling at the bar. Both floors get packed on good nights.
2014-12-10,2,The new menu is horrible.  It's has less choices at higher prices.  I've been coming here for years during the lunch shift and it's great.  But I'm gonna start going somewhere else for now on.  Too pricey for what you get.   What's up with the classic rock...my mom and dad are not stopping by anytime soon.  They should cater to who is in the place.
2014-12-06,4,Definitely go Tuesday night to take advantage of their wings-and-beer special. The wings are great and they also have their full menu, of course, if you're with anyone who doesn't like wings. (Although I'm not sure why you would choose to be friends with someone like that, ha ha).Overall, Black Bear is a solid place - good food, good beer selection.
2014-11-11,4,Awesome place to hang out. Wings are phenomenal. I am a regular on tuesday night. Waitresses are awesome and very friendly. Only problem with this place for someone who has been coming here for a while is that the new supervisor sucks. He pretty much hung around our table 90% of the time . He was pretty annoying . I just want to eat, have fun with my friends, and not be bothered. This is the third time he has done this or pretty much watched the table like a hawk. We just want to have fun, but its annoying being asked if everything is ok 5 times an hour.
2014-11-05,3,Food was just ok, nothing special. 3 stars for the "make your own" bloody mary bar.
2014-11-04,2,I thought it was a good spot to watch some college football, but got turned off that I AM basically in a sports bar and at 10PM (still at the bar dow stairs) and watching games that a bouncer come over and made me take off my hat. I just hate when these type of bars feel the need to act like a club after 10......how about you open up a night club instead. I was spending a lot of money at the bar and I took my business elsewhere when they asked me to do that and watched the games at Mcswiggs, which kept up with a theme of a bar.
2014-11-04,1,I've never had such a bad experience when having relatives visiting from out of the country as I did with this place. My cousin came over the summer to spend a couple of weeks in the United States and wanted me to take her to a nice lounge/bar. This is not my bar of choice in Hoboken I actually go to another bar a block down. But it caught her eye, since we where bar hoping and there was no cover charges I couldn't see a reason to not going inside. Our problem began and ended at the door as they refused to let my cousin in with a international passport! Yes people a valid passport issued bye a valid embassy. When I tried to speak to the bouncer he didn't even pay attention to me brushing everything I was saying off and saying that the passport was not a valid form of ID. When I asked to speak to the manager, she didn't even pay attention to me acting as if she was busy when the place clearly looked dead. I didn't want to deal with anyone no more and just decided to go right next door. When I got to the bouncer I asked him jokingly if they declined passports and the bouncer laughed, and asked me why would they refuse to accept it. That night we went to 3 different bars, all which didn't even question her ID accept for them. I guess this bar is exclusive for "Americans" and don't care about tourists!!! We will never go back to this place. Me, my husband, and sister in law couldn't believe what happened that night.
2014-10-30,4,Owner reached out to me to inform me the bucket special is BACK! Great news. See you on Tuesdays! (Their wings, btw, (firecracker) are the best)
2014-10-26,3,Decent beer selection and definitely a good place to watch a game.  Waitress was very friendly but the food was burnt.  I ordered buffalo shrimp and quesadilla's and they were both burnt.  i was with 5 people and 3 of us were not happy with the food.  Last time we came, the food was not good either.  I will return but will make sure to eat lunch/dinner somewhere else.
2014-10-20,4,Very good place for Football Sunday Funday. I came with a group of 8 girls for the brunch and stayed for the 1 o'clock game. There were a lot of TVs and all the games were on. It was a good crowd and good atmosphere. The only deal I remember that we took advantage of was $4 blue moon pints but they did have other football specials going on.
2014-10-14,3,Walked in here for a drink to kill some time between appointments one Wednesday afternoon. Huge space with lots of tvs and sports playing (will likely be back to see what its like for NFL). The drafts were pretty varied (at least a dozen or so) and the specials board said "$3 drafts" to my delight. Where this place lost stars was when I asked to server about the $3 drafts (more to confirm the craft beers were included than anything) she puzzlingly looked at the board and said they only had one special: $4 Stellas. But she she stipulated they were big 32oz mugs so they were worth it so I agreed. Unfortunately she returned with a regular 16oz pint explaining that the big mugs were no longer a part of the deal. This place seems like it could be a really good sport bar so despite the mishaps I'll probably give it another try eventually. And I will say that the server, in spite of all the misinformation on specials (which she seemed to genuinely be unaware on), was an absolute sweetheart. She was attentive and friendly and chit chatted about the neighborhood and apologized for the confusion. So there were bright spots.
2014-10-10,3,Stopped in for dinner with a group of friends after a day of drinking and we had a decent meal.Decor: This place is pretty big, with lots of tables and TVs (which always have some sort of sporting event on) but is your basic bar. It has a bit of an outdoorsy/cabin motif going on, which is a nice change from the standard Hoboken decor, so it keeps it fun. It can get a bit rowdy but nothing gets out of hand.Bathroom: Standard and clean, nothing bad about it.Staff: Our waitress was nice and was pretty quick with our drinks and our food. She also was around a decent amount for anything additional we needed.Food/Drink: They have a solid selection of beers and, of course, a full bar. Their menu is solid as well, containing most anything you would want from a bar and then some. I had the wings and enjoyed them. The jerk sauce, which I figured I''d try, was just ok. If/when I return I'd go right for the standard buffalo flavor. Everyone else in the group seemed to enjoy their food as well - one recommendation is the Chicken Bites, so good!Value: Your dollar goes about as far as you'd expect here. Not overly expensive.We had a decent meal, and a decent time, and I will certainly come back again in the future.
2014-09-27,4,Best place to watch a game in the area. The place has a ridiculous amount of TV's so whatever you're interested in watching will most likely be playing somewhere. The daily specials are also worth mentioning,especially the fantastic $15 wings deal on Tuesdays.
2014-09-24,4,I've been here a couple of times. Most recently for the weekend nightlife. As you can expect with most of Hoboken during the weekend, it gets packed with mostly college kids doing college kid things (getting hammered). So obviously be prepared for this. I myself don't mind and if I'm not driving chances are I'm there doing the same with a group of friends. They do have a second floor with a bar giving some relief to the first floor during the weekend. Prices are overall decent and they do have a credit card limit of $20 (if I remember correctly). I've never tried the food, but the menu looks very promising. TV's galore on the first floor making it a go to for game days. Good luck finding parking.
2014-09-13,3,I've been coming to Black Bear for years so I figured i'd finally write a reviews. It is one of the better sports bars in Hoboken, and i've never had a problem with the crowd it attracts. Here are my pros and cons:Pros: good weeknight specials. The tuesday yuengs and wings special (bucket of wings and pitcher of beer) is great to split with someone and i think its only $15. The thursday half off ladies night deal is also great if you are or know a lady. I think their appetizers are delicious. I drool over their chicken quesadillas and buffalo wings. The food prices arent terrible either especially the appetizer discounts during happy hour. I also love their specialty shots. Ive never had the bartender question me when i asked for a bday cake shot or a buttery nipple. They usually can make anything.Cons: they have a ton of rules that they strictly enforce. You can only benefit from happy hour specials AT the bar which really sucks because you can't come with a large good or else youre stuck at a table paying full price. Their credit card minimum is $25 so make sure to bring cash if you plan to get a quick drink at the bar. At night they slowly turn up the volume so at 6pm happy hour you can talk like a normal person, but by 8pm i have to scream to talk which can be annoying.
2014-09-02,4,Nice little bar on washington street with outdoor seating. This place has great happy hour specials on the weekdays and the bar food is pretty good. I  would recommend to anyone trying to watch a game and getting some decent food and drinks.
2014-08-18,3,Happy hour specials are reasonably priced and the food is good. The bartenders are slow when it's busy, which I guess is normal. I do like the open feel of the place and can go and watch any sports game. I would have given them 4 stars but the crowd that goes there is not my type of crowd.
2014-08-09,2,Just don't eat dinner here. Had dinner here last night, it's ok as a bar, but look elsewhere for dinner.
2014-07-31,1,My fiance and I went there last weekend and what a dive! My hands got black from the mold on the menu!  I told our waitress and she was very sorry about it and told the manager.  He did nothing about it! Not even a sorry! Never again!!!
2014-07-27,1,This bar has the rudest staff of all bars in Hoboken. They do not let you set your drink anywhere, you have to hold your drink in your hand while dancing so many spill their drinks on the floor and then the floor becomes slippery. I was there for 30 min and saw 5 people slip and fall on the dance floor. And, NOBODY from the staff offered any help.So if you value your health and do not want to slip an fall I suggest you check out one of the other bars on Washington street.
2014-07-25,5,My husband and I love this place! Great bar food and awesome happy hour specials. Plus best wings in hoboken!
2014-07-18,4,Love this place for burger and a beer.  I think it is the best reasonably priced burger place in Hoboken.  I've been with people who get the sandwiches too, and they look delicious.  Good service as well. Overall, if you're looking for bar food and watch the game.  This is your place.
2014-06-26,4,Excellent bar food and a fun nightlife spot too when it isn't too crowded.  Great spot to catch the world cup.
2014-06-25,3,Me and my friend were looking for a good place to watch the soccer game... The game was at noon, so we figured most of these places in Hoboken will be dead. And in fact most of them were. Then we got here and it looked really cool, they have a lot of TVs.. So def perfect for watching the game. The place was actually what got the 3 stars itself. But other than that, staff, service, drinks, food... Lacks something.The waitress were not the best, but they werent bad either. Were just average.We ordered beers and were not very cold. Big disappointment. The food wasnt bad, but was nothing extraordinary, lack seasoning and something else.Honestly I wouldnt come back here for anything other than watching sports.
2014-06-23,2,If you're looking for a bar to watch a game this place is okay. A lot of TV's and great beer selections. That being said I have never experienced such an awful staff. My girl friend and I had gone here once for dinner, and the service was decent and the food was sub par. We went back at another time to give it another chance. We were just going for a beer, and the bar seats were full,but there was no one in the dinning room or the high top bar tables. We asked if we could sit at one of the hightop tables, and they wouldn't let us even though there was no one there eating. I was dumb founded that they were unwilling to let us sit even though there was no one at any of the tables or waiting for a table. Finally I called once asking about trivia that is advertised on their website, and the girl that answered the phone was completely rude and condescending. This was enough for me to never go back. The food wasn't that good and there are plenty of other places in Hoboken to watch a game. I would skip this place if I were you.
2014-06-08,3,Eh, this place is OK... Food was "descent" not great. Last time I was here the drinks tasted a little watered down. Let's just say I had 5 margaritas and felt less then buzzed. I wouldn't be opposed to going back if the party I was with wanted to go, but not my go-to place.
2014-06-02,5,We have been here twice to watch two different sport games that I don't care about. I'm coming for the bar and I'm coming for the nachos. This place is such a great place to meet friends. It is a huge spot with outdoor seating, indoor seating, seating upstairs and TVs everywhere. Our servers have always been super nice, attentive and patient. This place can get pretty packed when the big games are on so be sure to get there early to grab a table if your plan is to nom-noms your way through the periods, quarters etc. It also KILLS me that Ohio State fans congregate here.
2014-06-01,5,Tuesday is the best day to go for the $15 pitcher and huge bucket of wings. In the weekends it gets pretty packed but compared to the other bars in Hoboken it's spacious, (2 floors and bathrooms on each floor) they're very strict on allowing people back in after 2am (even if you left your wallet) so make sure to arrive early ;)
2014-05-24,4,Great bar! Night life is really and during the day they have great bear specials! Ask for Ben the bartender, he's very nice and well with his drink skills!
2014-05-11,4,Never ate the food but if I'm in Hoboken I usually stop by at least for a few drinks. It's usually pretty packed on the weekends but there's always at least some room to breathe. Music volume usually on point - loud enough to dance, quiet enough to hear people talk to you.Hihhly recommended if you're looking to have a good night in Hoboken.
2014-05-08,4,One of the best spots in Hoboken for games and they even put on the sound for the NFL draft.  No indie hip hop crap for your games here.  This is a true sports fan's haven with 10 screens just above the bar. The service has slowed here over the years though, so that took away the five stars tonight.  I had to wait 5 minutes to get seated in a relatively empty bar at 730 pm.  Then it took 7 minutes for the drinks.  Food here is fuckin phenomenal though.  Buffalo bites with atomic sause will make you feel it on the bottom end tomorrow, and the Buffalo quesidilla is a great and safe choice for anyone.
2014-05-06,5,Yuengs and wings are my Tuesday nights. Give the honey chipotle wings a try, they're a good combo with a pitcher of Yuengling. $8 pitchers the whole night, can't be beat. Shout out to Gigi, our wonderful server for the night!
2014-05-05,2,A great place for sports games. (super bowl,etc, maybe?)..lot's of tvs on top level...And a place it you want to only be seen and not heard...;) too loud for casual conversation and connecting with people...didn't care for it as a result...not much of my scene...
2014-04-18,2,Good sports pub.  This place wont let you down if you want to watch a game.  Convenient location and abundance of televisions with keep you up to speed on your games for the day.  The service is friendly will keep you ordering more.The food is average. Don't expect anything that you couldn't get anywhere.  I love the pulled pork sliders, but I ordered as a meal ($1 more) and they sucked.  The pork was not drenched in the rub which is a big no no.  They also served it on a stale Italian roll.  Pulled pork should be served on nothing other than a brioche bun.The drinks are a bit overprices and based on the bartender you get, your drink strength hangs in the balance.  The bill was over $100 for 3 drinks each and specials.  On a positive note, the boody mary bar is cool for brunch.  This was a tough two star but we gotta keep it honest.  I will come back though to see if they can redeem.
2014-04-16,3,My family and I decided to spend the day in Hoboken for my sister's birthday. We have been to Black Bear Bar & Grill twice in the past and decided to visit again. The food was delicious as always. I especially recommend the crab cake sandwich, so tasty! Despite the delicious food, the service was awful. We waited nearly an hour for our sandwiches, and saw other people come in, get served, and leave during that time. It was awful to wait so long, especially on such a nice warm day. I would still go back for the good food, and affordable prices, but maybe not on a special occasion such as a birthday where you wouldn't want to just waste time sitting around.
2014-04-08,5,$15 for a bucket of wings and a pitcher of beer ... and they are sincerely the best wings I've ever had. Do yourself the favor and order the JERK HOLY COW AMAZING!I can deal with all the dudebros and super cool story sports for the hour it takes to house these bad boys with my friends. Otherwise this place is so totally not my style. But if you dig sports bars or wings or really love men in backwards baseball caps, come enjoy!
2014-03-31,5,Frist time in this  place last night. the staff is outstanding the food I just had the wings they were by far better than any Buffalo wild wings or Hooters and the bartender Adrian was outstanding, this is going to be a regular spot for me.
2014-03-24,1,@Bobby Renn.You should be ashamed at how you just represented your profession and your restaurant. We in the front of the house work very hard at our jobs, and we do tip the kitchen, in most places.You should try to do our job for one week. I dare you.Unless of course, you are not promotable. Which is altogether quite likely.Sincerely, FOH staff everywhere.
2014-03-23,4,I am not gonna lie.I love noisy crowded bars,especially when everyone around seems to be having a great time.This is exactly my type of scene..loud music,fun ambience and good food.We had the chicken bites and the firecracker chicken sliders.Both were pretty good,way better than usual bar food.The music was great and the bartender did a good job on the drinks. I even got to satisfy my sweet tooth with a cheesecake.Overall,I really liked everything here.Of course,if you are looking for a quiet drink,I suggest you steer clear of this place.It seems to be more of a 'have a loud,fun night with your friends' kind of spot!
2014-03-18,3,Standard sports bar. Lots of screens. Great to grab a table upstairs and enjoy the game in a booth with a pitcher. The food isn't stellar, "regular bar food" quality. But it's that comfortable local sports bar you just go in a hoodie and sweats... hell even crocs too.
2014-03-14,5,This place is one of the best spots to meet up with friends. It tends to be low-key during happy hour but never boring. The food is surprisingly better than most bar food. If you love mac & cheese, you must try it here. It's delicious!
2014-03-12,5,Great sports bar with the best wing & beer deal in town on Tuesdays.  My first time experiencing Black Bear yesterday, and I will definitely return.  Great quick service, good cold beer and pretty good wings!  I also had the chipotle sliders and they were delicious!  Highly recommend all around!
2014-01-21,5,I've never had a problem here! Always a good time, great food.. Gets packed on game days and nights/weekends so if you want an intimate quiet dinner this isn't the place.. Pretty mellow during lunch (again not during games)I love love love the buffalo bites and the chipotle slider burgers! (Now my mouth is watering!)
2014-01-20,4,Went there a few times with my co-workers and with friends. I sat on the 2nd floor and the food was good. The bar is always crowded on the weekends so I mostly go to have a few drinks, eat and spend a good time. The price is moderate.
2014-01-20,4,I've been here a bunch of times for Friday and Saturday nights.  I'd say they are pretty typical for Hoboken. Prices are pretty reasonable and the atmosphere is good. Went here for Sunday afternoon football & food as well. Walked in and then place was empty so we were a little skeptical. But they had specials and $10 pitchers (4 beers/pitcher).  The food was pretty good so can't complain about that. The place eventually got very packed but nobody rushed us out of our table since we were still ordering beers.  I would definitely recommend Black Bear, just make sure you get there early so you can grab a seat (if you plan on eating),
2014-01-03,4,There are few places where you feel homey n would like to go there again n again.......I think black bear is the place for me. It makes me feel homy, cozy with some soul soothing wings n beer. Lolz........This kinds of pkace you visit when you wanna relax n chill with frds. I usally come to this bar / resturant too often. ... not gonna lie but I m regular here. ....First of all I like this bar bc its a sports bar with many big screen TVs for games.  Edpically during football season its grest too come out here n  chill with ppl around you. Football season gets special due too there games n free gifts that they give out.  Superball time they even throw free caps, t- shirts etc. I have been regular customer during Superball game from last the year n I love it. It ia crowded here but I love when there are people during game time.  Good is ok. Add everyone says ..... can't beat their wing specials. Good food n friendly staff members.  Weekends are pretty pack here (Friday's & Saturday). I was there last Friday n it seemed like it was Saturday night.  Couldn't find a space to even walk. It was over crowded.  I think they should stop the entry when it getgets to pack.  Can't even do to the bar to get drinks.  But it was day before NYE so it was expected. Besides that i like to come here of Sunday football. I like the decorations for the place makes me feel like I m sitting in a wooden house,  which I love. Ambience is pretty good followed by some good music. Very few place plays good music whixh you like n I like it here. It's personal choice tho. ....Summer time they have outside tables n open ups their patios for customers.  During summer's you can sit outside n still can watch  you're fresh games n shows. Cant get better then this...food, drink, watching your gag game or show. ... homy! !!!!!!! ;) I hope this review can be useful n make your experience wonderful like mine. .... Gud luck!!!!!!
2014-01-01,5,Awesome food. Great staff.  Good music.  All the sporting events you can imagine. Kid friendly!
2013-12-20,4,I've been here a half dozen times and it's been fairly consistent. As a vegetarian there is little to nothing on the menu for me, but the staff is so helpful that when I try to invent something they totally roll with it. Once it got a veggie quesadilla that was great. This week I had a pizza with black beans, sour cream, avocado and onions- maybe one of my new, favorite, low-brow, foods. You can't beat their specials. My husband was thrilled with the sliders and beer the other night. We always love the bloody mary bar at brunch. It's a little noisy for my taste, but we ask to sit upstairs and it's not too bad. All in all, avoiding the weekends/game day/etc, it's a pretty good dinner.
2013-11-25,3,id give it 3.5 if i could.  I like how th TVs are setup, staff is nice.  Young crowd, but not like the crowd you see at the shannon.  I would come back
2013-11-20,2,Ive been here a million times...its nothing spectacular. However, i like that theres two floors. The majority of the people that come here end up filling up the downstairs and you can't move at all. Upstairs is another bar, which on the weekends(fri and sat) they have a limit for credit cards for $25...at peak hours. I came here on a saturday around 6 and actually sat at a booth to eat and drink and i only spent $10 and it didn't matter. thank goodness. Even tho its easy to drop$25 i wasn't  looking to get trashed at this time.The bathrooms are tinny weeny but theres one upstairs and downstairs.Ive only eaten here once and had the black bear bean soup. It was pretty lame. It wasn't soup at all it tasted like a can of black beans. at least they gave me bread.i got a huge beer for $5 which was nice. the service was nice and quick, but then again it was only 6.Other nights I've been here, its been fun and its nice to be able to grab a table if you can. Otherwise, like i said nothing crazy goes on here..it is clean and not too $ at all.
2013-11-12,3,The specials here are great! Came tonight for the wings special: bucket of wings and a pitcher of yuengling for $15. You get enough wings for at least 2 people. The wings are alright, the beer is alright. Other times I've been here for drinks, they were OK. Weekends are generally packed so I usually just come here for the specials. Service is pretty good: the food comes out quick, I actually got my wings before my pitcher of beer. They check up on you often enough and are quick to get whatever you ask for. Not a bad place to catch a game.
2013-11-06,2,Maybe if it wasn't Saturday night I would have liked this place better. Maybe if I were 5 years younger I would have liked this place better. Unfortunately, it was Saturday night and I am not 5 years younger so I did not like this place at all. It was too loud. Too crowded. Too young. The only reason I came was because it was a friend's birthday. I would never voluntarily go here. I am not kidding about this. I waited about a 30-45 minutes in line to use the bathroom. Every single girl took about 5-10 minutes in the stall. It was so obnoxious. I could think of a million other ways I would have rather spent my Saturday night.
2013-10-22,4,Came here for dinner with a friend from the city. It was nice out, so we chose to sit outside. It was a Saturday at 8ish and there were still some seats available outside, which was awesome.There's no beer list, but the waiter was very friendly and patiently listed all the beer they had on tap, which is a lot. My friend ordered a turkey burger, and I ordered the grilled veggie wrap. The turkey burger was perfectly cooked. The grilled veggie wrap was delicious, as were the French fries.All in all, it was your atypical north jersey sports bar. Its nice that it's located so close to the PATH, but it means that it gets packed during after work happy hour.
2013-10-19,4,Came here for a friend's birthday. Service was excellent for how busy it was. Drinks were reasonably priced. The spinach artichoke dip was excellent. Nachos were HUGE.My only issue with this place was the bathroom. Not enough toilet paper. The sink didn't drain properly also. Gross.
2013-08-02,3,I'd really give this bar a 3.5. They really have good specials during the week, like the bucket of wings and pitcher of beer for $15 every Tuesday!  1 order is enough for 2 people and really hits the spot if you are craving buffalo wings around the area.The bad is how packed this gets during the weekend. I feel like I'm a sardine in a can, because that's just how packed it is, both upstairs and downstairs. That's not to say that it isn't a good spot to hang out. There is just a ton of people in here.
2013-07-28,4,I like this place a lot. I just came here for my first time ever and i was happy with that decision. No cover charge for guys which is cool, they had beautiful women there and the bar tenders were good.I only got beers and for a HUGE glass of Blue Moon they were $7 each, which is reasonable. They have tons of TV's which is nice so any sports game is on to watch; they have 2 bars, one upstairs and one on the main floor. I got FREE Buffalo Bites from Yelp!! and they were delicious.This place is deff worth stopping in if your out on the town and want some drinks. The noise level isnt that bad and you can talk with your friends no problem. There is no dance floor so if you dont like to dance this is the place for you
2013-07-15,4,Went on Tuesday night for their wings & pitcher promotion night on a date.  Black bear was definitely crowded but not crazy. The crowd there is definitely typically in their 20's, but our bartender was attentive and fantastic.  The reason why it wasn't a 5 out of 5?  The wings were ordered medium and tasted bland with limited seasoning.
2013-07-13,1,Bouncers discriminated against my boyfriend because he had on Black Boots and let someone else in with boots right after.  Disappointed
2013-07-12,3,I'd say food, location, and afternoon atmosphere is 4 stars. I like the bloody mary bar on Sundays but on Friday and Saturday night it's packed and the music is awful. Not a bad place.
2013-07-10,2,Well... I dont usually go to this bar because it is where all of the tourists go.  But, one Thursday night I was convinced, so we sat outside.  Surprisingly it was not as terrible as I remember.  I had a few drinks and even got to play a few rounds of Bingo!  Maybe I will have to change how I feel about this place.  Would I go here on a Friday or Saturday night?  Probably not, but it *might* be OK during the week.  P.S. Make sure you sit in Danielle's section.  She is the best waitress!
2013-07-07,3,I was pleasantly surprised by this place: the selection of music was pretty good and the service was quick and good. My friend and I got a warm chocolate brownie sundae and it was amazing. Only thing: the musing gets very loud later in the evening, so don't expect to have a lot of conversation.
2013-07-04,1,1 star. Here's why. (rewind 3 weeks or so)Black jeans (not faded or hanging off my ass. they look like plain black slacks)grey button up short sleeve shirt (not hanging down to my knees, open to the 13th button, or tattered in anyway, ) fresh haircut (not important, but damn i was feeling good. u know how haircuts are. i digress)low black leather dress boots (not pleather, dirty, or the type you get when you're a cop, emt, military, etc.)ok, so now that that's out of the way, i walk to the door, show my id, and cant get in because i'm wearing boots. even though they are damn near brand new and covered by my pants. im dressed nicely, and damn sure wanted to spend a bunch of cash for my friend's birthday. they were inside partying it up (group of 8-10) and i let them know the situation and i would be chilling outside. while i wait, im watching while people wearing sneakers being held together by duct tape walk in with their bottom of the hamper cargo shorts.after everybody was wrangled up, they bounced and we went to eat some pizza .......... pizza (shout out to charlie murphy)look, you had a dress code you were enforcing, understood. and my money wasnt going to make or break your bar that night, fair enough. but i'm damn sure i was going to make 1 of your bartenders very very happy. alot happier than the guys that came in and had the ladies there wondering "what the hell, did they just come off the set of survivor" (i saw their faces. it was priceless)
2013-07-03,3,Sports bar to the max.  Good bar food, loaded plates of nachos galore.  Come here for beers and games, prepare to fight through crowds and not sit, unless you want to go in the boring back section and get a table to eat. Fun for big games.
2013-07-02,4,Ive been here a thousand times at different times on different days. It's always a nice spot to hit up. Their food  is pretty good. I love love love their buffalo calamari. On nice sunny days, you can always sit outside and enjoy some quality time with your friends. On the weekend, it can get pretty crowded, especially in the upstairs bar. However, they play good music. I also feel like its a good crowd...
2013-06-20,4,I love Black Bear!!I've been here several times for the happy hour. The wings & pitcher deal is awesome.   Be sure to come for happy hour.The rest of their food is good, too. And the menu has a wide variety of food. The mac & cheese is delicious! I LOVE IT. They have a decent selection of beer & booze as well.Even though this is a popular place - I haven't really been there when it's too crowded to handle. We usually sit upstairs.My favorite was coming on a Wednesday night - Bingo night!! It was really fun and we won some prizes.
2013-05-24,4,While working in Hoboken I often came here. The wait is rarely long if you want to eat. They have a good food selection and great service, not to mention specials each day of the week. My absolute favorite day to go is Tuesdays for "Wings and Ying," a deal you can't beat. Bucket of wings although not completely full (seriously who can eat all that anyway lol) and a pitcher of Yuengling for about $15 and $10 additional pitcher after. The wings are delicious and many different flavors to choose from I tried mild, medium, BBQ and teriyaki before. Weekends aren't bad either from the times I've gone. No cover and there's a DJ that plays a little of everything, so people are often dancing on the top floor.
2013-05-22,2,Although the chicken cheesesteak sandwich and BBQ pork sliders were delicious the service and atmosphere on the other hand was sub par. I was in the tv section all the way in the back. That was nice, my girlfriend and I enjoyed the "privacy". I wish I could say it was private. The employees sat there and stuffed their faces with food and were extremely loud causing them to be rude and obnoxious. I wish that was not so because our food was to die for! But for me, service and experience out weigh the food category.
2013-05-21,4,My first visit to Hoboken resulted in a trip to the Black Bear Bar and grill with a few friends.  I enjoyed my experience at Black Bear, we started our evening in the outdoor seating area and enjoyed a few cocktails, we later moved into the dining area in the back of the bar.  I did find the cocktails to be a little on the expensive side.    The beers were cheap though! Especially when the Knicks or Nets play, $3 Coors!   As for food I ordered the Steak Sandwich which was delicious and the service was excellent too.
2013-05-19,4,The staff was so great.  We were visiting NYC from Pittsburgh and we wanted to watch the hockey game.  I playfully asked if we could cheer for a team that wasn't the NY Rangers and we were welcomed.  Not only that, we were seated right in front of the TV that had the game on it, without requesting the channels to be changed or anything. Now for the food: I had four people at my table and we ordered a mix of everything.  The wings!!! GET THEM.  They were crispy and flavorful.  The bleu cheese dressing was so good.The burger bites were so juicy and perfectly cooked with the softest buns.The fries, so crispy and seasoned.The prices were good, food was good, and the atmosphere was perfect.
2013-05-08,1,When we got to the door, the bouncer needed to see our IDs. No big deal, we were coming in for drinks anyway. The hostess didn't even ask if we were eating, I guess just assumed and took us to the back where there were only 2 occupied tables. There was no drink menu, only food. When our server came and asked us what we'd like to drink, we asked for a drink menu. They didn't have one. We told her that we were just here for a drink and we could go sit at a bar table so we didn't take up one of her tables. She said it was up to us. We didn't want to be ride so we went into the bar and sat at a tiny rable (the actual bar was full). Then the hostess came and informed us that if we weren't going to eat we had to sit at the bar. Are you kidding me?! There obviously aren't any seats and every table is open! Not to mention almost all of the actual "dinner" tables. I found it incredibly rude, which is why this review is being posted. Don't you want to make money? Then you might want to fire your 'hostess' with the long blond hair.
2013-04-15,2,I went here Saturday evening (around 9:30pm) April 13th and was not happy with my experience.1) As we tried to figure out if there was a bar upstairs, a bouncer was listening to our converstaion and only inputted' you can't stand here". It would have been nice if he could have at least answered our question as to whether there was a bar upstairs.2) Around 11pm, the bouncers removed tables/chairs upstairs to make a makeshift "dancefloor". They then proceeded to make me get off my barstool (which was NOT in the dance floor area) as they needed to take it away. A bar that takes away seats from patrons? Rude and unprofessional.3) YOUNG CROWD. I am only 27 years old and felt like I would be babysitting these kids. Stay away if you're looking for a good bar to talk to friends & hang out. This is a typical college-bar.
2013-03-19,4,Loved this place when I went this past Sunday on St. Patrick's day!  The bartender was very attentive, even though he was the only person behind the bar preparing drinks for both the servers and crowded bar.  They have a "make your own bloody mary" station which I really liked since I'm very picky about how a bloody mary tastes.  It's $9 for half a glass of vodka (ask them to just chill the vodka and omit the ice so you can add more goodies to the bm!).  The station has 4 different garnishes, celery, tomato juice, a bloody mary tabasco mix, spices, fresh horseradish, and about 35 different hot sauces.  You can keep walking over to add stuff, it's great!We went back later for the food and the waitress was very good, checked on us several times, and got our food to us quickly.  I got the grilled vegetable wrap with a side of mashed potatoes which was very good!  My boyfriend got the chicken cheese steak and fries which he said was delicious.  I would definitely go back again.  I think this place just depends on when you go, who your server is, and what you order.
2013-03-08,4,One of the most consistent bars in Hoboken as far as service and food.  We usually go here for whenever we need a safe location to gather and get some food, by safe I mean somewhere where they won't mess up the food or drinks.  I would have giving it 5 stars but they have no Wi Fi, come on!!!!!
2013-02-28,4,Upon first setting foot in this bar, it seems like the typical huge,mainstream bar, devoid of any originality.  Not crazy about the beer selection, but do LOVE that they offer tons of TVs for every game, all sports. Multiple levels also make it seem cozier.
2013-02-18,5,Love this place! One of the first bar/restaurants I went to when I first moved to NJ. The staff is wonderful & we've quickly turned into regulars. Try the buffalo calamari, black bear nachos or anything with ahi tuna, you won't be disappointed. Be aware that the 21-23 year old  Stevenson Tech-college crowd pops up on Friday & Saturday nights. So if you're looking for an adult crowd who isn't falling over drunk, spilling drinks on everyone, or hassling the bartenders, late night weekends are NOT the time to go. Other than that, it's a great place to watch games, find great food/drink specials & interact with a fantastic staff!
2013-02-14,2,This is the worst good sports bar in Hoboken.  If you're looking to stand at the bar, it's fine.  If you're going to grab the Tuesday wings or Wednesday sliders with 1-2 people, it's fine.  If you look to go with a group, the hostesses make your business feel so unwanted, I finally walked out on Tuesday (after wanting to do so many times wanting in the past).  I always get sucked in because it's a "Rangers" bar, but they rarely have sound and won't sit you at a table unless you have the exact, total number of people ready to sit.  I dont know if you've ever been out with a group to watch a game, but people tend to stagger in, and I think 5/6 or 7/8 should be enough to sit the group and let us start drinking.  Unfortunately, management believes we're best suited standing by the door.  I now believe I'm best suited somewhere else.
2013-01-29,3,I total agree with Nobel V. 3.5 on Tuesday.For $15, a bucket of 30 wings and a pitcher of Yuengling is not too shabby. However, it's the best wings in the world. Skip the carrots with blue cheese. They mass prep those babies and have them sitting in the window so they tend to be try and cracked. The service is a little cold but still reliable. Ambiance is not to bad. Its pretty cozy for a sports bar.Would I come out of my way to come here again? No. I guess if somebody suggested it. Oh! If you Yelp Check-In you'll get a free app of Buffalo bites. SKIP IT. It's breaded stale chicken toss around in buffalo sauce. If I had to buy them I would be pissed!
2013-01-25,4,Every Tuesday they have my favorite special in Hoboken. $15 for a bucket (20 - 30) of wings and a pitcher of beer! You really cant beat it. I go with one other person and we normally split one bucket and 2 pitchers. THE BEST WINGS I HAVE EVERY HAD! Always crunchy, and they have 4 or 5 different sauces to choose from, ranging from traditional buffalo to fire cracker, which is a tangy BBQ sauce. It is a little loud but it is a great bar.
2013-01-24,3,Good place to come to watch the games! I love that there is a sports bar atmosphere but also a casual date atmosphere as well. Good drinks and food all around.
2013-01-09,3,3.5 on a Tuesday.I've always been here for the "bucket of wings" and pitcher of Yuengling deal on Tuesdays.  You can get a "bucket" of I would say around 30 wings of 1 particular flavor and 1 pitcher of Yuengling beer for $15.  Out of the flavors I have tried, I liked hot, firecracker, and honey BBQ the best.  I have also tried the atomic wings, which I would say are good to have if you can handle something very spicy.  When I had it I would eat 1 then eat 2 to 3 of another kind before I tackle another atomic wing again.As for the appetizers, I feel they could be a lot better.  As a tip, check-in on Yelp and/or Foursquare!  The first time you check-in on one of these applications, you are able to redeem a FREE buffalo bites appetizer!  One you redeem it once, then you are able to get another one every 8th check-in you have here at Black Bear.  To be honest, the buffalo bites are average, and nothing special, but hey.. it's FREE!In addition, I tried the sweet potato fries and was not a fan at all.  I personally like eating sweet potato fries, but these seemed overcooked and thus, lacked a lot of flavor.  I would suggest getting the normal fries here, as they are not too bad.The atmosphere is pretty much like any other bar, as it can get packed late at night on a weekend or even a weeknight with good sports on.  They have an abundance of TVs around to show different sport events going on the same night.So best bet for a person coming here the first time, go here on a Tuesday, check-in for free buffalo bites, and feast on a bucket of wings and Yuengling to share with your friends!
2013-01-02,4,Came here on football Sunday for brunch. The place got packed real quickly. When the games went to commercial, there was a DJ spinning Top 40s. I'm not one to complain about club music, but it was a little odd and a little too loud for my liking when you're there to catch up with friends. However, I really took a liking to the Make Your Own Bloody Mary bar downstairs. There was plenty of hot sauce options and fresh, crisp vegetables to make it delicious! My Cha Cha Cruz chicken entree was really good too! For a large table (party of ten), our server was really attentive as well. Hoboken Bar and Grill, you have some competition!!
2012-12-31,3,I think it's one of the better bars of Hoboken. There is usually a nice lively crowd. The food is pretty good, nothing glamorous though, typical bar food. The burgers are awesome from what I hear though.If you come on a football Sunday better come early to reserve a table. They usually have some type of drink special on beers to...
2012-12-19,4,Blackbears wings are awesome. They typically have really good drink and beer specials also. Good place to watch the games; projectors and TVs all over. The crowd is pretty mixed depending on when you go. It always has it's average bar crowd then on weekends it pretends it's not a wing and beer spot and girls can be free to wear their skankfits and dance all night judgement free.
2012-12-16,4,I came here with a group of 8 one Saturday night and we had a blast. It was my first time and wasn't sure what to expect, but here it is:Atmosphere: Relaxed, and started to get very crowded around 12DJ: Awesome, especially when the early 2000s hip hop started blasting =)Drinks: Pretty easy to get a drink, the Gin and Tonic was yummy, kamikaze shot was good, but amaretto sour was too sourBouncer: No line at anytime on a Saturday night, didn't give grief to any of usBathroom: 3 stalls (from what i can recall), fairly cleanWe had a little corner with table and chairs pretty easily and danced our butts off!
2012-11-29,4,Met a friend here for Wings and Yeungling  and 30 wings for 15.00. Really good deal. Honestly there was no way i could finish 15 wings on my own,  My friend he was a professional he positioned himself to devour these wings, with a Zen like quality. The place it self wasn't that packed on a Tuesday its a massive place upstairs and too many tv's i guess its for that hoboken.On the weekend its like a club music is blasting, no cover. bouncers are great. music is typical hoboken. top 40 and what ever fist pumping mix they decided to spray us with. come here its fun. come on its a good deal ...especially if you like beer wings, people drunk, and alot of yelling for no reason. Sounds like a party!!!
2012-11-02,5,Great food and great drinks while you watch the big game.  I checked in here and Bang! I get a free app.  Love that. But also it was really good (got the buffalo chicken bitres).  Then for dinner I got the Reuben with the black bear Fries.  I proceeded to wash it down with their $5 mugs of bud light.  Rutgers got stomped in football but I was well fed.  I love this place.
2012-10-26,1,I used to love coming here. Until my birthday when they  threw out someone from my party for absolutely no reason. Literally, no reason. Wasn't drunk or rude. no reason. Look, There are a MILLION bars in hoboken so I can no longer say this one is fun. I was treated terrible and laughed at by a manager when I complained. I'm sure many of you have wonderful things to say about it. It used to be one of my favorite spots. now no one who was with me that night will go back. They lost about 25 loyal customers because of ONE incident. I am giving it one star. That's not how you treat paying customers. 1 republik is awesome & it's next door, also texas arizona.
2012-10-18,4,Nice, spacious Hoboken bar where you can watch sports over a couple beers. The food is higher-end sports bar food and I especially enjoyed the Firecracker Chicken Sliders. I'm also a fan of the margarita specials on Mexican Mondays. Amanda the bartender is also the best!
2012-10-15,4,I've got a soft spot for Black Bear.. it was the first bar I hit up for my 21st, and I've been a patron ever since. Honestly everything about it is great!They have great specials during the week, my favorites being --Tuesdays: it's $14.99 for a pitcher of Yuengling and a bucket of wings, and they're not shy about loading you up on wings! My average bucket is 30-35 wings and it's good to split with 1 or 2 people. Medium or medium firecracker wing sauce is the way to go on this one.Thursdays: Half off drinks and appetizers for the ladies! I've personally never tried the appetizers but I've had my fair share of drinks and I can attest they taste just as good at half the price :)The customer base here is mid-20s to mid-30s, but still gets a little rowdy at times (everyone loves the drunk i'm-still-in-college-but-not-really guy who stays til the lights come on..)One of my favorite places to go for a night out, and it's always been a good time!
2012-10-07,1,People can write all they want about how the food is decent and the drinks are cheap and poured heavily, but the atmosphere, including the obnoxious clientele and overly rude staff deserves this place zero stars.The staff kicked my friend out because she was "stumbling," when all she was doing was jokingly doing the leg kick dance thingy that Elaine did in Seinfeld.  It was clearly us just having a good time dancing upstairs.  The bouncer just made some story up that she was "stumbling" just to kick us out.After they kicked us out for no reason, they proceeded to use walkie talkies to alert other bars along Washington St. of our presence in the area (pretty much instructing them not to let us in)Those douchy, guido, frat party places are never my type, but regardless, this establishment should be ashamed of itself.  Places like Black Bear give Hoboken a bad name.
2012-09-12,3,Normally I have a great time here, but I feel I must deduct some points for the one time the bartender was unbelievably rude to my boyfriend- I haven't seen her since this incident, and hopefully that means she has moved on to another job more suited to her talents (i.e., one where she doesn't interact with humans :) ).
2012-08-23,4,Great bar, great specials, and on the weekend they play really good music at night. There are crowds of people upstairs and you can even dance...sign me up! Seriously cool place. Nothing fancy looking but definitely not dive. Great food! I've tried their wraps, burgers and wings (tip: don't get the hottest unless your stomach's made of iron and/or you've surgically removed your taste buds - I LOVE spicy and could only have 6 one night...made an awesome video of a friend, who can't eat spicy at all, trying a PIECE of one - yeah it was THAT bad)...Overall, great place, fun times.
2012-07-31,2,Nothing special.  Standard sports bar with standard sports bar fare.  It does have a lot of TVs and could potentially be a good sport for game viewing, but service was SLOW.  That's my big mark down.  My friends and were their for a meetup group and had to wait about an hour to be serverd drinks and food.  They didn't seem understaffed either.  I saw plenty of waitresses moving around.  Too bad.  This place has great potential.
2012-07-22,4,Came here on a Friday night with co-workers for late night happy hour..$5, buy one get one free, drinks for ladies. Can't beat that! Needless to say, we quickly made friends with the bartender :) and I even ran into a few old college friends in the crowd.
2012-07-18,4,What can i say? This is the place to be on Tuesdays.  Great wings, burgers, and beer!
2012-07-16,4,Cool vibe. Great to place to watch a game. Decent food . I had the blackened chicken wrap which was on point
2012-07-15,5,Next to Hooters it's my favorite place to go to watch a game or talk to girls, or just meeting new people. The food was awesome big ass tv's cute girls I can't think of anything better. YOU MUST GO THERE IF UR A FAN OF SPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I suggest going on fridays or saturdays
2012-06-08,3,Great place to watch a game! Especially fun during Giants playoff games, although you need to get there early to snag a seat. The service is always good, but the food is hit or miss. The bar food is pretty standard bar food, but the brunch is pretty lousy. On Sundays they do fun specials with names like Cruz Mac and Cheese, Coughlin Chicken, etc.
2012-06-04,4,My wife and I make it a point to stop by here after work, one day out of the work week, to unwind and to take advantage of their $2.50 pints of Sam Adams on tap during Happy Hour.  Yes, I repeat....$2.50 pints of Sam Adams on tap.  For this reason, I'm a fan.
2012-06-04,4,I feel like there are 2 different Black Bears.  My rating is for the first version.1 version is during the week, when you can get some great bar food and decent beer.  You can sit at the bar and watch some games on the Wall of Flat screens.  Or you can sit outside or upstairs and have a conversation.  The bucket of wings on Tuesday is a great deal (get the firecracker wings) and overall the food is surprisingly good.  Then there's the other version of Black Bear.  The version on the weekends where if I don't walk in with a decent buzz beforehand, I want to walk right out.  The bar gets way too pack with entitled, awful people.  It's funny when there's a big game going on during a Saturday night.  The place will be great, with everyone focused on the TVs (or the giant projector screen).  And then once the game is over, the sports crowd leaves and the place fills up with Lana Lounge/Trinity/Teak people and it gets tough to enjoy yourself.  Or I'm just getting old.
2012-05-08,2,my friends and I were feeling a bit lazy after we left Green Rock. Today was not the day we raged, but the day we vegged. We stumbled into Black Bear, asked what time the kitchen would close and decided to get a meal in before the night was over.I knew the minute I walked in I wanted a burger. NOT a good decision at 10:45 pm, but I convinced everyone else to order food too.We were seated upstairs, away from the party-goers. But I WANTED to play with them, but eat my burger at the same time!Why I gave them two stars:French onion soup-cheese melted, but soup cold. brrrCrab Cake sandwich- put on an english muffin roll, wait, what?!
2012-05-01,4,Their burgers are really tasty.I like going there on their Bingo night which is Wednesday.
2012-05-01,3,I met up with a few friends here to watch the Rangers. We went on Saturday and, thinking venue continuity was the best way to bring our Blueshirts some good luck (we're superstitious when it comes to the playoffs!), we stopped in again last night. The main bar area has at least fifteen TVs in addition to a projector. They also have a back room for those who want a sit-down dinner (an option if you have kids) and an upstairs with even more TVs for your viewing pleasure. Needless to say, it caters to every sports fan. To call it a Rangers bar might be a bit of a stretch. But they definitely root for them there, as evidenced by the wall decor and the fact that they hosted a viewing party not too long ago.I appreciated that they turned on the sound for each game and I even put up with the "music" during intermissions, because I'd rather listen to terrible music than Mike Milbury. The draft beer selection is nothing to write home about and is geared towards what I consider the "typical jockish sports fan" sort: Bud Light, Coors Light, Sam Adams, Yuengling, etc. So if you're a craft beer person like me, you won't be too impressed. But they do offer good specials each day, such as $6 large Stella mugs on Saturdays.They serve standard bar food. I got the portobello chicken wrap. Veg was roasted properly; chicken was a little dry, but the entire thing was good. It was also pretty big and one half was enough for me. The fries were just okay: crispy but with a very oily aftertaste. I've been told the wings are the item to get there (especially on Tuesdays when they're part of the special), but I have not yet had them.Service was spotty on Saturday, as our server seemed a bit flustered by the influx of Ranger fans and then by some bar crawl crowd. Monday it was better (and yes, it was even busy, but not overwhelming, on a Monday).The crowd was typical of Washington Street: young, tan, and, in some cases, obnoxious. There were several groups of people who came in and thoroughly annoyed the piss out of me (when the majority of us are rooting for the Rangers and concentrating on the hockey game, we don't want anyone else in our way). But hey, I'm not called the "angry Asian" for nothing.
2012-04-28,4,Fun, energetic, spacious bar with solid bar food at amazing happy hour prices. We were able to get 2 beers for $5 at the bar on Thursday night. The Rangers game was on so the place was packed but we were still able to get a table for 8 without a problem at 7 pm. While none of the food stood out to be incredible, they were all greatly satisfying to our ravenous group. I take that back - I loved the wings! Especially the slightly spicy honey BBQ ones. YUM. The pitchers were $12 at the table and appetizers were 1/2 off for ladies! Good service, fun atmosphere, great happy hour.. I live in NY but I wouldn't mind coming again.
2012-04-27,1,I decided to venture to this place tonight, being Friday, but was turned down because of the dress code. They said my jeans were too baggy. However, I was wearing a nice sweater and black shoes. My jeans were loose fitted and I find them more comfortable that way.If I was dressed shabbily then I could understand being turned down, but honestly that was not the case. In addition I have been here before plenty of times before and I go solely to have a good time and not for any adverse reason such as starting beef. So it was kind of ridiculous for them to turn me down just because my pants were too baggy.As a result, I never want to go here or to give this place any future business. Instead I will go to places that are more reasonable and that will not turn me down just because I'm not wearing tight jeans.
2012-04-18,1,Many people tend to think highly of Black Bear. I am not one of those people. Mainly because it is real crowded and noisy. This place just isn't my style. There are a lot of tv's and there is even a second floor. The music is ok and this place does get packed on the weekends. It seems like everyone from North Jersey hangs out at this spot.
2012-04-15,4,Wings are solid and the wraps are good (I had a southern BBQ steak wrap [small portion], which was cooked to a perfect medium).  Fries were just OK.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu, so I can't really comment beyond that.  In any event, it's a great bar to watch the game, as the walls are pretty much completely covered in flat-screen televisions.Service is good and the wait staff is very friendly.  However, it can get REALLY crowded.  Can't wait to go back for the gigantic bucket of wings. PS.  The outdoor seating is great.
2012-03-10,1,I came here for my birthday, the bartender was a rude bitch and kicked me and my boyfriend out because she thought i had too many drinks yet i was completely calm, not bothering anybody and was just enjoying my night. We tried to explain to her that everything is fine, but before we even finished she called security who were sooo rude to my boyfriend and pushed him a few times, very disrespectful. He was being very nice and respectful and just wanted to get my purse back (since i dropped it) he couldnt even do that because the big bouncer in the front pushed him and yelled at him to leave. I hate this place and how rude the bartenders and bouncers are for NO REASON, we are never coming here again especially since there are so many other great bars here.
2012-02-02,4,great set up, great atmosphere especially during Giants football games. The music is also really really good here too. The only bad thing is that the food sucks. Even the blue cheese they serve with their wings are horrible. I would definitely go back to this place but just for drinks and the music, not for the food.
2012-01-27,4,Black Bear has great deals and the BEST bar food in Hoboken. The service is great and the Bloody mary Bar on Sundays is key.Gets a little crowded on the weekends, but that's to be expected.
2012-01-22,3,Good for games they have the big projector screen and the wall of plasmas. Dont expect to get a table unless you get there early but an over all great atmosphere for the games!  The only reason this place gets three stars and not four is because my name and number were on the list for a table for three hours while I watched the games, kept getting pushed as the hostesses friends came in off the street gave her hugs and kisses and made the top of the list
2012-01-11,4,Watching a Gaints/Jets game here is great, its almost just as good as tailgating. I haven't ate a solid meal here yet but their apps are good... It gets PACKED to the gills so a few ppl you re with might get uncomfortable because its not one of the most spacious bars...Just make sure you get here early so you could get a seat, so you dont have a stand around and maneuver around pplPlus, during halftime there are NFL trivia (challenging) questions... (I got a Giants track jacket)
2012-01-09,3,Always reliable bar food, and a ton of TVs for whenever games are on. If you go during a Jets or Giants game, either get there 2 hours early or expect not to get in. Hoboken is a drinking town with a football problem.
2012-01-03,3,BB has some great deals and a nice country decor it.......but even though i had been here several times with my friends and girlfriend, i never enjoyed it well i don know the exact reason it.....The food, drinks and service were just fair except for the front table waitress who was really attractive and nice!
2011-12-28,3,Black Bear is actually not a bad spot to watch a game. I came into JC / Hobo last night to go to Target then met the girl here to watch my alma matter lose miserably on ESPN. This spot isn't bad, there are plenty of tvs to enjoy any game that is going on. We ordered a few beers and the price wasn't bad. The beer on tap are standard, Bud Light, Guiness, Stella, etc.  I didn't order the food, so I can't comment.
2011-12-19,4,Every sports fans' wet dream. Large flat screens everywhere. Every game that is on will be shown in this bar. So, what does a girl that doesnt like football do at a bar like this? read her kindle of course. There are two floors. two bars. two dining areas. I sat in the upstairs area at the bar where I received pity treatment from the bartender who tried to engage me into the game but i just wanted to drink my beer and read my kindle.There is a special right now where if you dine there 8 times you get a free order of boneless buffalo chicken bites. I dont know how but we managed to get an order. The mild was spicy! like HOLY SH!T this is spicy!  but tasty. And while I didnt enjoy the game, my book was entertaining and the bartender made my group the most delicious shot on the planet: chocolate covered pretzel shot. 1 part pinnacle whipped cream vodka2 parts frangelicolick salt before taking the shot.
2011-12-04,4,In from out of town looking to kill time till out hosts  arrive. Using my yelp app I flip on the monocle trying to have a little fun we found Black Bear had a free app special when you check in.Boom! Done - we don't need much to eat but these sound interesting good.  They were buffalo bites aka like buffalo chicken fries. Yum. Extra fried with great wing sauce. The blue cheese on the side looked and tasted a little not right. As for drinks - standard beer selection. I ordered a dark and stormy. Very good.The music was very - what an out of towner would expect to be playing in a north jersey bar.Overall this was a great choice for a stopping place. As an out of towner - I'd say we did good.
2011-11-22,4,Dude, Hoboken is awesome. I don't know if it was the name that deterred me (hobo?) but I thought the place would be a dump. Turns out it's cute as hell, with a smattering of bars, restaurants, and shops. A few friends were looking for a place to watch the Penn State vs. OSU game this weekend, and thanks to my handy Yelp app, we found the Black Bear Bar & Grill. Pitchers of lager were around $10, and even though I personally was just drinking water (rehydrating from the night before), our server kept my glass full at all times. TV screens were huge and plentiful, and the crowd was loud but not rowdy. TIP: Check in on your Yelp app and get a FREE order of buffalo bites ($9)!
2011-11-03,4,Luckily no one can see just how slowly I am typing this as my head continues to recover from a great Wednesday night at Black Bear.I am slowly but surely becoming a regular at this bar.  The food is delicious and it is reasonably priced.  Other than Wings to Go, Black Bear has the best wings in all of Hoboken.  They are always perfectly cooked and there is a larger than normal variety of flavors - I like the standard hot wings or honey BBQ myself.Black Bear is a great lunch spot if you are around Hoboken during the day.  The food is its usual outstanding quality and the service is fast enough that you can easily be in and out of there in under a lunch hour.In my experience, there isn't a bad weeknight to head to Black Bear.  They are always running a great special.  Last night, we headed there for their Wednesday night bingo (my personal favorite) and $4 Stellas.  We even got there early enough to enjoy half off happy hour which runs until 8.  $2 for a Yuengling just warms my heart.  In fact, the only complaint I have about bingo night is they do have a shortage of bingo boards.  Get there before bingo starts or you may not get one.Black Bear is also a great place to enjoy sports.  It is one of my favorite places to enjoy football on Sundays.  The crowd is rarely unbearable and they have a DJ running the day, doing trivia and insulting Dallas Cowboy fans.  It's worth it to go to listen to him do his thing.
2011-09-26,4,Good crowd, conveniently located right on Washington Ave, lots of TV screens & the staff members were helpful when you sought them out.  We weren't greeted at the front entrance so we just seated ourselves.  Regular bar place, want to sample their food next time and get some of them yummy wings that everyone talks about.If you aren't feeling the vibe & crowd at Black Bear, you can always head over to 1 Republik that is on the same block.
2011-09-26,4,Reasonable prices. Good food. Great happy hour deals. Pretty decent sized space for hobo!
2011-08-30,4,I'm a Tuesday regular.  The wings and Yueng pitcher deal can't be beat.  My choice of flavor on the wings is Firecracker, while BBQ and Jamaican jerk are close seconds.  also on Tuesdays, it's half off drafts until 8pm during happy hour.  As far as the regular food menu, I've tried everything from their appetizers and wraps and burgers.  It's nothing special, but better than the average food in the area.  If you're hard pressed for a small compliment to your entree or bucket of wings, they have variations of mac n cheese's to offer.  3-cheese, sausage, all in regular or spicy, and the best one so far, CAJUN SHRIMP mac n cheese.  Some are only made on specific nights, so ask your server.Wednesdays are mini burgers , $3 bluemoons and bingo if that's your thinganother plus: crazy amounts of tv's and daily specials every day of the week.  I've never had an issue with the waitstaff, bartenders, or bouncers (and I'm usually mistreated at other establishments).  I'm really not sure why some of the reviews make a quip about that.  bottom line:  Great Tuesday wings/pitcher deal.  Friendly staff.  This will always be a place to turn to in Hoboken.
2011-08-27,5,Although I didn't go on the Tuesday night special, I did have a great "Friday Night Baseball" experience! The food was great (had the honey mustard chicken sandwich), the specials were decent, but the bar has the best TV set up I have seen!This is a great setup for Football!!!
2011-08-25,2,I've been here 3 times now, and you're looking at my star rating and thinking why did this idiot keep going back? Well here is why:The first time I went was with my girlfriend and another friend, we went because they had 5 mini burgers and a 25oz. Sam Adams mug for 10 bucks..burgers/beer - $10 speaking my language. Well the beer was big but they should really say MINI MINI burgers these things were so tiny, they made white castle burgers look like something from Fudruckers. No fries, side or anything so I asked for a side of fries...$4 for a side of fries...really?? Not like they were gourmet or anything just Sysco food fries. Sigh ok. The service at this visit was great.The 2nd time I went was before a kickball game for happy hour. They have wings and yuengs for $13, this deal you can't beat. I love my yuengling and I love my wings. The wings were pretty good no complaints I'd get them again and there are a TON of them. We got the hot and the Chipotle BBQ, but it's just BBQ the Chipotle part wasn't there. The waitress was meh. She seemed more interested in the guys wearing mesh muscle shirts behind us (yup not kidding). It took forever to get refills on beer, water, etc.The 3rd and likely last time was this past Sunday for brunch. We looked at the menu it was cheap, looked decent and we were hungover and didn't feel like walking further (that's the real reason). The waitress was nice at first, brought us our drinks then took our order. Here is where it gets weird. About 7-8 minutes after placing our order the waitress comes over and says "You guys doing OK, need anything else or will just the check be it?" I was like um...before I pay for my food I'd prefer to eat it. She had no clue that we hadn't eaten yet, keep in mind she had a total of 3 tables in the upstairs and spent most of her time talking to the other bartender. I waited tables for 5 years and I never heard of anyone forgetting their table hadn't eaten especially after only a few minutes. Then the table behind us who came in AFTER we ordered got their food. We sat there waiting, waiting...wait for it...waiting. The waitress never once came over and said you're food is coming out soon etc. Then when we finally got it my girlfriends potatoes were cold. She plopped it down, no apology for the 30 minutes it took (we ordered a pork roll sandwich and an omlette, not groundbreaking time consuming entrees). Never checked back in with us to see how it was, nothing. She plopped the check down and we left as soon as we could. Honestly, I've had bad servers before but this girl was a space cadet. Earth to waitress.Not worth going back for the 4th trip.
2011-08-16,1,The only reason this place gets 1 star is b/c of the bartending staff... And a few of them at that... God bless those few bartenders too!! If it weren't for them this place would be complete shit! This place has douchebags as security, douchebags as staff (well, the majority anyway) and douchebags as managers (except for the one that bartends - he's pretty tight). They have no idea how to run a good bar... I've worked in amazing bars and clubs over the past 5 1/2 years from San Diego to Hoboken, and this doesn't come close. Perhaps I am more biased then most, b/c I have worked in the industry for years, but as a paying customer on numerous occasions, the amount of disrespect from security and managers is beyond comprehension. I guess that's what you get when you give b*tches too much power. Oh, and the food is average, at best...Hint: go to a different bar - 1Republik is a couple doors down with way better service (overall).
2011-08-10,4,Liked the mix yourself bloody mary bar, wings were great, a few to many tourists, but if you are looking for a game, t.v. selection was amazing!
2011-07-26,4,Nightlife: So much fun! I had a great time when I went here. This place is bigger than it looks--there are two floors! The crowd is great. Attire: guys--go with a button-down or a nice tee. girls-- jeans are coolBrunch: Not too shabby! An omelette is 10$ and delicious. I've seen some people watching games on Sunday mornings, but it doesn't get that packed.
2011-07-25,4,After a hot Sunday at the beach with friends, we decided to stop here to get some early dinner before I headed back to the big apple.It was an easy decision to say "yes please" to the $3 Blue Moon special. I was starving so everything looked good on the menu. I decided to go with the cobb salad which was great. Fresh and big. That would have filled me up but due to lack of food in 20 hours, I wanted more. Enter...wings. This is 10 wings for $10 - unlike places in Manhattan where is $12 for 6. They were cooked well and I was very pleased. We got the medium and they tasted pretty mild to me. if you like some heat, go with hot.They do trivia on Sunday too. We weren't playing so the announcements were a little annoying but a lot of people came for it.Also...I've been on a Saturday night and had a good time. The beers are well priced and it's a casual bar. Never pretentious, good entertainment (laughing at meatheads) and a place where you can be comfortable.Another plus - lots of tvs for sports.All in all - solid place. Will definitely become a "go to" whenever in Hoboken. And...I'm looking forward to heading across the river for those Tuesday wing specials!
2011-07-22,4,As prior Yelpers have stated, Tuesday night's Wings and Yueng's deal is a solid reason to check out Black Bear. The atmosphere really was reminiscint of a hunting lodge sports bar. That being said, on to the food and drinks.I was actually here before on a Sunday when they had $3 pints and did not hesitate to hop on this deal. Also to note, I had their Mushroom burger and was satisfied by the quality as well as quantity of the fries on the side.As previously stated, the Tuesday night deal was exactly what I expected. (that's a good thing). A bucket of 20 wings plus a pitcher of beer? It's on like Donkey Kong, as some have said. The quality of the wings was just as impressive as the amount they offered. Their Honey BBQ and Medium Buffalo Sauce are my favorites.As with any other popular restaurant, Black Bear can get crowded, which made our wait a tad long. Fortunately for us, my friend knew the bouncer and pulled in a little favor to bump us up the waiting list. Sweeet.Also keep in mind that checking-in will grant you a free order of buffalo bites your first time around. Even more incentive to come, no? I still have yet to come out for other night specials but it shouldn't be too long before I come back.
2011-07-22,4,A good bar to catch the game. The wing special on Tuesdays is excellent. Just don't linger too late into the evening, or you will be surrounded by meatheads.
2011-07-13,2,Friendly staff, however we're not briefed by management regarding yelp promotion or for that matter existance of yelp.  Instant coupon check-in-deal provided to staff was met by confusion and disbelief.
2011-06-19,2,A lot of the bad things about Hoboken bars here.I can't say anything about the food, but later at night when it's just a bar the place just rubs me the wrong way.  You've got tons of meat head employees everywhere telling you where not to stand and what not to do, tons of guidos (like, more than the usual amount for Hoboken), and terrible music (to be fair, it attracts a lot of tasteless, but hot yuppie chicks).  On the plus side they do pour some strong mix drinks and have a decent beer selection.  And the chicks seem to love the place, so if you live in Hoboken and enjoy getting liad, you might have to suffer a few unfortunate hours here.
2011-06-17,4,Lots of TV's showing a wide variety of sports, great food & drinks at reasonable prices. One of my FAVORITE spots in Hoboken!!!
2011-06-03,3,I use to call Black Bear the Applebees of Hoboken. Now that other places have moved into town like Wicked Wolf and Village Pourhouse Black Bear doesn't stand out as much for it mediocrity as it use to. The food is not good but it also is not bad. If you work the specials here you can pretty much eat and get drunk for under a $20 bill. It is a good place to just hang out with some friends on a Tuesday for wings night, play some bingo on Wednesday nights or watch the game on all the TVs they have. Outside seating is also nice when the weather is good. One of the big pluses is that no one really hates the place so its a good meet up place for people no matter what there taste is.
2011-06-03,4,I stopped here with my roommate last night for a quick dinner after the gym. It was a little chilly, but we sat outside for some people watching anyway. We were absolutely starving. I ordered a cobb salad (no cheese) and she ordered the penne vodka with chicken. The service was quick, friendly and the space is great for people watching. The total came to about $40, for two entrees, and a glass of wine for my roomie.It's ladies night on Thursdays, and inside at the bar all apps and drinks are half price. Plus it's a sports bar, so the cute corporate man factor is high. We'll be back soon!
2011-06-02,4,I went here yesterday with my boyfriend and was pleasantly surprised. The menu had a varied selection of sandwiches, burgers and wraps. Our waiter was friendly and helpful and the food was delicious. I am not a big beer drinker, but I did find their selection of beers on tap to be small. Other than that I would definitely go here again for lunch.
2011-04-21,5,Best place to watch the Giants play in Hoboken.  The wings are some of the best in town and the upstairs area is great for large groups.
2011-04-19,4,Great place to grab a couple brews and watch a game.  My roommates and I love the wings on Tuesday.  My go to classic is the steak sandwhich.  I haven't partied here much at night but it seems the crowd is what you would expect from a Hoboken sports bar.
2011-04-11,4,There's plenty of TV screens to watch sports.  I went on a Tues and they had their happy hour wing special.  $13 for a pitcher of beer and a bucket of wings. It was about 25 wings/drumsticks.  They have a variety of flavors.
2011-03-29,4,I'm not usually a fan of sports bars, but one friend loves this place (there are TV screens EVERYwhere), another friend wanted bar food, and I wanted meat and a fruity drink so we came here.We got the buffalo calamari appetizer, it was interesting and delicious - buffalo wings flavor on calamari texture. It's available on a hot scale, and we got the medium one which had a slight kick without being too much. I had a taste of the meatloaf, and it was one of the better ones I've had - moist and I liked the peppers and onions mixed in with the meat. The strip steak was pretty good too, served with sauteed mushrooms and onions. I got the filet mignon, which was juicy and tender. Plus I got my fruity drink, so basically I had a good time.
2011-03-13,3,I am no Jersey girl.  If my 22 year old self knew how much time I'd be spending in the dirty Jers, she'd be shocked (and appalled!).  What she would be proud of however, is the abundance of full bars and burger joints that I have recently surrounded myself with. The burger at Black Bear was just what the doctor ordered on a cold winter's day - thick and juicy with a ton of fries.  I love that the bartender was happy to oblige my off-the-menu request of whiskey tea (that's whiskey and tea for you on-the-menu types!) and I love that the bill was pretty reasonable.  Just a few more things to add to the "I Heart Jersey" list - a list my 22 year old self would find hysterical!
2011-02-20,3,strange layout. The crowd could have been better. Way too many guys to girls
2011-02-13,3,Our server (Rebeca) was great and she is a very beautiful woman.  I usually go here for a quick bite for lunch with a friend.  It has become a monthly tradition.The blackened chicken quesadilla were ok but  could include more traditional salsa wit it. The burger is a great disk for lunch but the only downside is the added charges for additional toppings  (BOOOO!!!!)Death by Chocolate was one of the best chocolate desserts that I had for a long way.  Just by the name of the disk, it is a great thing to have.  Nothing beats death by chocolate.
2011-02-10,3,Great place for watching football games! Good DJ and they have trivia during commercials. Other sports are good to watch here too!Bartenders have always been pleasant. Waitresses on the other hand are not pleasant. Food is great. Buffalo Chicken Wrap is the best here! Good size portions too.If you are looking for a place to go out at night it plays good music and always has a crowd however it is so loud I cant even hear myself.
2011-01-30,3,Not a bad spot to hang out on a Saturday night. Good music, a lively crowd and the drinks are decent. Gets kinda crowded but if your out and just looking for a decent time it works.
2011-01-24,4,Went here for a quick bite to eat and to get outta the FREEZING cold weather! The food and service were good! We started with the onion soup - loads of cheese and a great flavor. Had the Southern BBQ wrap which was great - although I substituted a salad for my fries and REALLY didn't care for the dressing that was on it. My BF had the Buff chicken wrap and fries and he loved it! Our server was great, the atmosphere was fun and TVs everywhere! Great place for sports games and groups looking for a fun time!
2011-01-20,4,Ah, the old standby. This place is great for Saturday/Sunday lunch. They have decent drink specials and great burgers and salads. Good beer, good food, large TVs so you can politely ignore whoever you are dining with. Be warned - if you like quiet/low key dining, this is not the place to go on a weekday night as it is a bar and can be quite loud and filled with drunken frat boys/investment bankers.
2011-01-12,4,A cross between a hunting lodge and a sports bar, the place has a mostly unique atmosphere for Hoboken.The specials make for delicious weeknights with friends.Tuesday Nights: $13 for a pitcher of Yuengling and a bucket of wings with $10 for additional pitchers. Medium is delicious with Firecracker as a happy balance between spicy and sweet.Wednesday Nights: $9 for 6 sliders and a 25 oz Sam Adams. AND BINGO!These two deals alone warrant the review. I recommend going early, 6pm or so, to get a table quick and still get the best of the wings.
2011-01-02,4,A consistent performer in the Hoboken bar scene. It's a great place to watch a game and the food is definitely some of the better bar fare in town.
2010-12-28,4,This is a great place to come on days when it isn't completely jam-packed. Service is friendly, and the wings are among the best I've had in the NY/NJ area. The other food is quality standard bar fare.Tons of huge HD TVs and they have every NFL game on Sundays, UFC fights, baseball from around the league you name it. Perfect for the sports bettor and/or for afternoon drinking with the fellas.
2010-12-23,4,Great drinkin' bar.  There always seems to be some sort of event or special going on (I even won $75 worth of free drinks for playing rock-paper-scissors here).  Tends to get crowded, especially later in the night.  All in all, a pretty solid place.Food isn't bad, but the quality of food isn't really predictable.
2010-12-22,3,Just one of the many bars in Hoboken! Nothing sub par or above par, just par. ~If there is a cover, don't bother.
2010-12-21,2,Awful, just awful people in this place over and over.  All the bad about the typical hoboken bar with none of the good. Gets the second star because the food is above average.  But avoid whenever possible.
2010-12-13,3,I'd say as far as Hoboken bars go Black Bear is average to slightly above average.  It features a nice variety of large flat-screen TVs and reasonably priced beers.The wing 'special' is quite a good value-a pitcher of domestic draft beer and two dozen wings (I'm reasonably certain its two dozen) for around $15.  Although rather oddly you only get one choice of sauce-no mix 'n match on the wing sauces.
2010-11-09,3,Simple sports bar w/ good bar food menu new wall of tvs a much needed upgrade that fill in blank stares easy when convo goes stale!
2010-10-09,4,2 words: wings and beerThat's why I go here at least twice a month, the Tuesday special.  $13 or $14 for a bucket of wings and a pitcher of Yuengling.  Wednesdays are sliders and bingo with a Sam Adams special, also great.This place does got packed though and you can wait a while for your table.There's no way I can ever consider 5 stars though because there have been multiple occasions where they've run out of wings or beer.  Once they ran out of BOTH.  Saddest day of my life.
2010-10-08,4,I live in Hoboken for a month before moving into the city and this was one of the first places I was told about. The first I went was on a Saturday night and there was a pretty good crowd. Downstairs was a little more chill than upstairs where people were dancing to decent music. The crowd is mid 20s to 30s but not very diverse and you seem to find that a bit in Hoboken. It took way to long to get a drink at the bar so that would probably be my biggest complaint.I've been there 2 other times for dinner on Tuesday and that's where most of my 4 rating comes from. On Tuesdays there's a bucket of wings and a pitcher of Yeungling for $12.99 and each additional pitcher is $8. The wings are very good and they give you a good amount. There's a lot of flat screens for sports fans so that's definitely a plus. Or you can sit outside and people watch on Washington St.
2010-10-07,2,This place is good but improve to be quick and energetic to serve your customer.Slow in getting your drinks. be better next time! Nice bar :-)
2010-09-30,1,I wish there was a way I could give negative stars.  The bartenders at this place are the worst on the planet.  The short one with the black hair and bad teeth needs to find a new job - like painting light poles.
2010-09-29,3,Last Saturday was my 3rd late night visit here.If you are drunk already:Go upstairs, its slightly less crowded everywhere besides the bar- which you don't need to be at anyway.  Theres more room to get your dance on. Comfy booths to chill when the feeling starts coming back to your feet. Better music to dance offbeat to. If you are not drunk quite yet:Stay downstairs- that bar is less crowded and less chances of the drunkies knocking into you. You might even be lucky and grab a seat there. Glasses are small so don't be mad when your LIT comes in a toddler-sized glass.There is a $25 card minimum and they will pre-authorize $50 just in case. WTF? I know... but who wants to leave and pay a cover at Bahama Mama's. Next time bring cash my friend. The later you go, the surlier the cute bartenders are. Its okay though. They're just tired. Plus, you have a direct line to the bathroom, great views of some spectacular dancing....and the exit is super near...if you need it. Thats service.If you are not going to get drunk: Why are you here?
2010-09-28,4,Can't say I consider this a legitimate place for hanging out so I'll rate it strictly as a sports bar...and in that context, it's awesome. Great atmosphere for Giants (and unfortunately Jets) games. The place gets packed with everyone cheering. That's the experience I enjoy as a fan. This year they bought probably 20-25 brand new TVs and upgraded their big screen projector. I don't think I've seen a better setup except in Vegas. Food is decent and beer seems to be reasonably priced by the pitcher. Not sure if love or hate this but they have a DJ every Sunday giving away prizes during halftime for trivia. I do love that they play music during commercial breaks. Arrive early to secure bar spot before your game.
2010-09-25,3,Was there on Wed. and got there for there happy hour special.  1/2 price appetizers as well as 1/2 draft beer and cruzan rum drinks.  The appetizers are okay.  Can't really say that the food really stands out or is anything special.  But the great deal on wed's is the special that runs all night.  8 and change will get you sliders and a 25oz mug of sam adams. In all it is an okay place to go.  Not a fan of hoboken but the last few times  my friends and i have ended up here.
2010-09-21,4,I've been here several times for lunch and haven't been disappointed yet. Have had several different appetizers and usually get the burgers and still the quality's pretty consistent. For Pub food I'd definitely recommend.
2010-08-17,2,You have to take the good with the bad. You learn that pretty quickly going out to the bars around town in Hoboken. Black Bear is basically the epitome of what happens when a place gets to full of itself.From the bouncer who has to bust every guys balls when they present him with their license. "No it's not fake. Yes your right, I didn't have a beard when I got that picture taken. No, I'm not going to get my Pass Port to show you anther picture ID." I get through a DMV line faster than a line at Black Bear.To bartenders who ignore you as soon as you make a cash me out gesture. "Must not have seen me, don't worry he'll have to come by soon (hand up in the air)" Just to be left standing there and seeing them avoid you as they take ANY drink order before asking what you want. "Oh that's right I asked to close my tab 20 minutes ago."Black Bear is nice because they have TVs behind the ground floor bar and a big projection TV upstairs near the railing of the dinning area. Buckets of wings and bottles of beer. But I pick my bars like I pick my friends. If I have fun when I'm around them and they treat me nice I'll be back. Sorry we couldn't be friends Black Bear!
2010-07-24,2,"Fool me once, shame on - shame on you. Fool me - you can't get fooled again," - GWB. The happy hour specials drew me in and then subsequently drove me away. Okay, so half-price drinks and half-price appetizers is nothing extraordinary, but decent nevertheless. Plus with a sizeable bar and drink selection, it seemed like it was worth a shot. There were three of us, so we grabbed a hi-top next to the bar rather than sitting in a row at the bar itself. We proceeded to spend a good 90 minutes of alternating our order between drinks and apps and the server was fairly bubbly and friendly with us. Good so far. Then when we get the bill, there are no discounts at all, everything is full price. When this was brought to the server's attention, the response could not have been more prepared. "Happy hour specials are only good AT the bar, it says so on the menu." (In small print no less). Really? We're six feet away from the bar at a bar hi-top (not a dinner table), and it never occurred to you to perhaps float out a friendly reminder that the happy hour specials, likely the reason why just about everyone who's there at 4:30p on a weekday is there, only applies if you literally sit at or order from the bar? Again, the response was so blunt that it's as if they've been coached to play this little trick on unsuspecting patrons. There was no remorse or attempt to resolve. We chalked this gaffe, albeit one that cost us an additional $35 (for nothing, really), up to us perhaps not being diligent in our review of the "rules". Advantage Black Bear.Fast forward to a few weeks later. I'm not one to write off an establishment for one incident, particularly if it could be argued that the situation could have turned out differently. In other words, I'll learn from the mistake. So this time, I remember to order my stuff from the bar, even though there is no room to sit at the bar. I figure surely they can't have a finite amount of people that can participate in a happy hour special just based on how many seats are at the bar. Just order from the bar and all is good. "Newcastle please,"  I say as I also make a quick point to the taps. The bartender reaches into the refrigerator, cracks open a Newcastle bottle and pours it into a glass. "$7" she says. "$7? What happened to half-price happy hour." "Oh that's for drafts only." What? A place has a half-off special for drinks, I order one and somehow they assume I wanted the full-price bottle? Again, there was no remorse from the bartender and she explained in not so many words that the damage is already done, the bottle is open and poured and now it's mine. So pay I do, drink and out the door to hit up a more reliable joint.What did I learn? Well, it had appeared to me, that Black Bear took pride in making you work for the happy hour specials. It shouldn't take that much effort. Happy hours are a dime a dozen and I'll be glad to spend mine at a place that is not interested in pulling the all-too-frequent ruse.(The second star is because the beer variety and quality of the appetizers was pretty good, just pay attention because no one there will help you out.)
2010-07-21,4,Went here for a few of the World Cup games, and I loved it there. The Tuesday wings and a pitcher special is awesome! A bucket of wings and a pitcher of Yeungling for $13! SAY WHHAAAT? And the wings were pretty good too, we got the firecracker bbq wings. Not too hot, not too sweet, just right in the middle with a little tanginess.The waitress was a little snobby toward us though, but whatever we didn't need much from her. Other staff were really helpful other times we went. The atmosphere was fun, and the crowd is mixed. I've yet to be here when it's crowded, but for now, I love it.
2010-07-14,4,I love Black Bear's Honey Mustard - it's like liquid CRACK to me. The bar food is the main reason I go. The staff is pretty laid back and cool as well.Likes:- Great bar food- Good atmosphere- Bar staff is cool and easy going- Food comes out fairly quicklyDislikes:- Sometimes you have to wait 30 plus minutes to be seatedThey some of the best wings in Hoboken, and you can't beat the Tuesday bucket of wings and pitcher of Yuengling special for $13 bucks...and I don't even really care for Yuengling beer so I drink the $5 dollar Stoli'sHowever, the trick is to get there early on Tuesday's, otherwise you can wait up to 30-35 minutes to get seated...before 7:30pm is best. Plus they have some amazing wraps and other daily specials which change weekly.Yeah, it's like a Frat house when the games are on, but who cares - I just enjoy the grub, the laid back feel, the drinks specials and keep it moving.Here's the thing about Black Bear - it's a simple no frills sports bar with great bar food, creative specials, and a lot of big TVs...what more do you want from a sports bar.It's definitely a good Hoboken spot and worth checking out during the week or on Sunday brunch, I would stay away on Saturday nights, there is normally a queue.Enjoy the Honey Mustard!
2010-05-24,3,It was too croweded on friday so we went on to a smaller dive bar instead.  But on saturday when we returend it was better then i expected. Although the singing along very loud to most of the songs got a little old and the indian guys doing a dance battle was something I wish I could have UTUBED, I had a good night with some decent ladies to look at and a few good ole sam adams with an old pal fron high school. Black bear your ok in my book although it would have been nice to meet some ladies, the game that night was no where to be found, oh well,
2010-05-22,3,Everything I wrote below still holds true, but on my most recent trip there, I saw a sign that said that there is never a cover charge on weekends.
2010-05-15,2,Meh, disappointed with the veggie options. Kinda typical Hoboken scene.
2010-04-27,3,Boooo :( I am not a great fan of sports bar's but i do appreciate places with a good ambiance and good music.This place was crowded and they played horrible music and the place was so suffocating that we had to leave in 10 minutes. They had two floors,hoping that the 2nd floor would have a better crowd and ambiance we ran upstairs.And sadly they just had a few tables with a trashy crowd and no oxygen.we had to run out of this place.  Sorry black bear!you really need to improve your place and have more oxygen to keep people alive and oh!! play some good music.Their techno music could make any person restless.yucky yuck!!:(-Smriti
2010-04-05,2,Wound up here during a night of bar hopping for my buddy's birthday. My first impression was just two words. Too Crowded.Beer was moderately priced, albeit it took about 10 minutes to get to the bar and  served. The music was a bit too loud for my taste, and it also was the typical "club" type hip hop bullshit, but that's what we get for going on a Friday night when there is a live DJ.The 2nd floor was even more crowded than the first, though there were some open booths up there so it wasn't too terrible. (also worth note, in the back on the first floor there were a good amount of tables and it wasn't crowded at all, so we could have sat down if we wanted food, but like I said, hopping all night)One of my buddys just said hello to the bouncer upstairs, you know, one of those "how's it goin" kinda things, being polite after making eye contact, and the bouncer goes to him "I wouldn't even waste my time up here bro, its a complete sausage-fest." I thought that was pretty funny (and nice of him haha)I plan on trying it again on a less crowded night because I would like to try the wings here as I've heard good things.
2010-02-28,4,This place is becoming a regular Tuesday spot for me.  Tuesday's Yuengs & Wings is very nice.  And we usually get the same waitress week after week, which is great.  Thus service has been great to me.  I'm a big fan or the Teriyaki Wings, and the Jamaican Jerk Wings are pretty good too.  I'm not big on spicy wings, but I like their Hot Buffalo Wings ... which are probably more mild/medium to anyone else who enjoys the heat.It's been a while since I've had some of the other food offerings here, but those that I've had were good.Food is good, the service is good ... it's overall good, and will be back many a many Tuesdays.
2010-02-23,4,3 words........Fire Cracker Sauce.  Place is usually busy and has good bar food.  Tue night special is the best.  30 Wings and pitcher of beer for only $12.99.  How can you beat that.
2010-02-01,4,Best wings I've had in a long while. I usually go on Tuesday when they have their pitcher & bucket of wings for $12.99. I've had anywhere from 18-30 wings in a bucket. I've tried the Jamaican Jerk, Chipotle BBQ, Honey BBQ, Teriyaki, and Firecracker BBQ. By far, the Jamaican Jerk is the best. Perfect crisp with a flavorful sauce & is not dry at all. It's sweet but also has a slight tang at the end (I have a high tolerance for spicy food so to others it may be spicy). I wasn't a big fan of the Firecracker - it was not spicy at all (the Jamaican had more of a kick than this) and it was rather dry. is my favorite (Chipotle BBQ tasted like regular BBQ sauce w/ a slight kick). I have introduced these wings to over 15 friends and every single one agreed that these were the best wings.I've had their regular food as well (a wrap that came with fries - was very good). Everyone else in our group liked their meal as well.Waiters/waitresses are usually fun and attentive.FYI: Green rock is the place to go afterwards. $1 mugs of yuengling, coors light or miller light all night long. Crowd's a hit or miss. Music is a hit or miss. But if you're with your friends, you can make the best of it. :]
2010-01-27,4,* Last night I had an immense craving for buffalo wings. I searched yelp for some bars with good deals. I found Croxley Ales has some 10 cent wings deal - but its only on Monday and Wednesday. I needed some good deal for Tuesday... So I changed my Gtalk status to "Hungry for Wings"... Within a few minutes my friend pings me about Black Bear. He tells me to check out their Yuengs and Wings special.* Based on his advice, I hit up the place at around 8.30. It was fully packed downstairs and upstairs. I had to wait for quite some time to grab a seat. * The bar has a large number of TV screens for watching sports. I mean you could watch TV from any cornor of the bar. Black Bear is essentially a sports bar streaming all kinds of sports - Tennis, Football, Racing, etc.* So after sitting down comfortably, I asked for the Yuengs and Wings special for 12.95. I chose the medium spicy wings. Couldn't wait to get my hands on the wings. * Within minutes, I got a big Yuengling pitcher to drink. Then came the bucket of wings served with blue cheese and carrots. It was huge - I mean it had some 20-25 wings. It was too heavy for me alone. But as I was terribly hungry, I ate it all like a pig. Btw, the spicy wings were really tasty.* I was hugely satisfied by the wings and the beer. I'd definitely recommend others the Tuesday wings special. A kool bang for your buck!P.S - Do check out their website for other specials.
2010-01-25,4,I dig this place.  Pretty roomy for a Hoboken bar.  Upstairs is particularly fun.  I've always found the staff to be very friendly, fast and attentive.  Good drink specials too.
2010-01-24,4,This is definately one of the most popular sports bars in Hoboken.  We've been going here for four years now and still really enjoy it. You have to consider the time of day and day of the week when you plan on going though because it gets PACKED and makes it hard to enjoy your time there sometimes. We love Wednesday nights because they have free Bingo and Burger + Beer specials. The food is good but after you've been there a few times, you've tried it all. I'd recommend their chicken wings but if you like meaty chicken tenders, you won't find them here. The "buffalo bites" are really small and many of the pieces are all fried and no meat (hence, the four stars) If you're looking for a good spot to watch a game or a good place to get bar food - Black Bear is great.
2010-01-08,5,One of my favorite places to eat in Hoboken.  Wings and Yuengs on Tuesday is the sh*t.  You get a bucket of wings and pitcher of Yuengling for only $12.99.  Undoubtedly one of the best deals on a wings meal in Hoboken.Beers , Burger, and Bingo is also a must hit Wednesday night deal.
2009-12-18,3,One of Hoboken's most popular sports bars, its food. While their Tuesday Bucket of Wings and Beer special keeps me coming back, it's their use of alliteration that won my heart over. They have specials all week which are described by clever alliterations like Mexican Mondays, Thirsty Thursday, Fantastic Friday, and more! I am easily amused, get over it.Everyone at the Black Bear was very friendly; although, I did wish to see our waitresses beautiful smile a tad bit more.  She was very attentive and won extra points by refilling our waters without being asked to. I've been there even on a busy day, and the wait staff is pretty much on top of their game. The restaurant is a typical sports bar, with a minimum of 3 TVs always within view.  I also really enjoyed the music that they played at a moderate level, which provided great atmosphere while never interfering with your conversation. As far as the food goes, most people I know go to Black Bear for their hot wings, but I feel it is almost obligatory to order a burger at a bar and grill in order to form a real review. As such, I ordered the Chipotle BBQ Burger cooked medium rare. I thought it was delicious since it seemed the spice and zip was cooked into the meat. My guest ordered a Grilled Vegetable Wrap, which they agreed to put chicken into. The wrap was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. However, both entrees came with some pretty delicious fries. Also, on the recommendation of a friend, we ordered the Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes. While the Meatloaf was good, it may be a bit too pricey for most at $15. To top it all off, for desert we split a Death by Chocolate, which was a rich and delicious chocolate cake. It was a good thing that we split it because if the chocolate overload didn't get you, then the diabetes would have. Definitely one of the better bar and grills in Hoboken, Black Bear is the perfect place if you want to kick back a bucket of wings and pitcher of beer with your friends, or are looking for a relaxed business-esque type lunch. The service was quick and attentive, and the food was above average for other establishments of that type. Make sure to check out their cleverly named specials to get the best bang for your buck. The burgers are good. The wings are good. The beer selection is good. What more could you ask for?
2009-08-17,5,I give this place 5 stars because back in my heyday of frolicking around Hoboken, this was my favorite place to go. Your typical preppy jersey guido/guidette and frat boy crowd. Downstairs is more of a bar sene, upstairs more of a mini dance floor scene. It gets very packed. i mean very very packed. But its fun!
2009-08-11,4,Yuengs and Wings on Tuesdays.  Enough said.....  unless you don't know what that means, in which case, I'll elaborate...  Yuengling Pitchers and Wings... lots of em.  I go with my friends on Tuesdays and this place is great for that.  I leave stuffed, drunk, and only about $10 poorer.  As good as it sounds. I've never been here any other time, or ordered anything else.
2009-05-21,2,Food was pretty good the couple of times I went, and the drinks were fine, but it gets awfully packed. Fairly standard bar/grill.Also, they are really strict with IDing. That's not a problem for me, but I wanted to bring a friend who was 20 here for food (we had just gotten back from a concert in the city), and they were refused admission. Seriously? You mean to tell me there's no way your establishment can easily differentiate patrons by age group? You know, like wristbands or something to that effect? The final time I went, they charged a $5 cover. Apparently they do this on random nights. Fail. Even more fail was that we had finished eating and were enjoying our drinks, then were told to hurry up so they could rearrange upstairs into a dance area. EPIC FAIL.I do have a funny story about this place. I was brought here for my 21st birthday and they had bingo, which is kinda funny in and of itself. Well, my friend won a t-shirt and asked for an extra one for me for my birthday, and when she told the announcer that I was a large he gave her a large...a youth large. I put it on as a joke and looked like Bruce Banner about to Hulk up.
2009-04-28,3,Black Bear is one of the better places to watch sports in Hoboken.  Plenty of TVs and if your team is featured (Yanks, G-men, Rangers) they play it over the loud speaker and there is usually prizes and lots of rowdy fans.  Drinking off special gets kind of expensive but not too bad.  The food is actually really good, I was surprised because most bar food is shit.  But the sliders deal on wednesdays is great and they are quite good - 8.95 for a 25oz sam adams and 6 sliders and then $3 25oz sams all night does me dirty.  I have found myself playing bingo every wednesday and winning numerous prizes.  They always have give aways or promo items which is good.  Going out at night here is not all that fun, its always packed and it's blazing hot even in the winter.  The top floor is better because there is more room but I would much rather go somewhere else to drink and party off special.
2009-04-27,4,Good place to go if you want to watch the game, eat something and get a pitcher of beer.  Can be a bit rooty at the front, but in the back or upstairs is solid.  Service is pretty good and the food and is what you would expect from a bar and grill - good, greasy and filling. Ask for beer specials - they always have em ;-)
2009-04-08,4,Let me start by saying I've never made it in for dinner.  Only lunch.  I walked by the place at dinner time one time and it was way too crowded for me, so that is most people's complaints.  The beer on tap is good and the Cajun Shrimp wrap is awesome.  Don't think of it as a restaurant that serves beer, think of it as a bar that serves above average food.
2009-03-31,1,This place sucks my non-existent balls.  It's way too crowded for no good reason.  During commercials, they have an obnoxious radio DJ with kind of lame ploys to get the crowd moving - dude, STFU, the games are on!  And it seems to be the go-to bar for the the meathead jerkoffs.Burgers aren't anything spectacular and I think the bun is actually too much for the burger.  Food is ok to blah.  If you are hungry and you can't walk any further to find something to eat, you can eat here I guess and deal with the noise.
2009-03-26,2,This place is hot and cold in terms of the food. I do not like the inconsistency of the food quality that is served.The positive thing is that even though it seems very packed at the bar when you first come in, the seating area is a little more roomier. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap that came with fries and my boyfriend ordered a chicken steak with peppers and onions that came with fries. All I can say is thank goodness for the pitcher of beer. My wrap was drowned in hot sauce so i couldn't taste anything but that. My bf's chicken steak was bland and both of our fries were not pleasant at all. Like most other ppl, we love to eat fries, so when both of our orders had old hard fries i was very very disgusted. They were rock hard shells of potatoes that had probably been re-fried a million times.We had to down beer to forget the food. What a shame  =(
2009-03-02,1,wack crowd... overly packed.. wack music
2009-02-08,1,I came here for happy hour (which by the way segregates you to the bar if you want happy hour prices) and was very disappointed.The food was disgusting, even for bar food.  Their "chicken fingers" were four badly fried chicken patties served on brown lettuce.  The nachos brought Perdue precookec chicken cubes on it instead of real chicken.  Then there's the touchy subject of liquor.  Their only two drink specials were $5 Jack drinks and $3 drafts.  The crowd was super mellow and quite, for a friday night it seemed like a Monday in there.Definetely the worst type of happy hour specials, I much rather go next door to bahama mamas.  It's strange to think both places are owned by the same person.
2009-01-20,4,I have to say, I enjoy the rock, paper, and scissors competitions here during the summers (the winner gets a bar tab or portion of it covered!). There are multiple TVs, a projector or two, and enough seating here to allow for a decent-sized group in the back (about 40 ppl) or above on the second level bar/dining area (around 50 ppl).The wings are probably the best food here, although the burgers are decently-sized, and the salads are pretty big, too. Props to the french onion soup I tried once, too, although it was a bit saltier than expected.Beer is usually the drink of choice here, but they do have a full bar. Note they require ID most hours. A few tables up front in the warmer weather for eating outdoors.
2008-11-20,4,I have been to Black Bear twice for the Wednsday night beers, burgers and bingo. I think the mini burgers were good, but throw in a huge mug of beer all for under $9, well now they are great.The second time I went was on a date which kind of sucked because the place was full of men!!The bingo thing is fun and it is a great deal.
2008-10-13,3,Envision this:Meatheads grappling each other at the top of the stairs in their salutations of brief gruntsOver-protective boyfriends + their clingy girlfriends.The most screens I've seen to fill any sports-junkie's dreams.Tables cleared around 10pm, including the bar stools.DJ waltzes in with better beats and mixes than the standard rotation of Top 40.  They were playing Rihanna's songs five times that night.There are quite a number of young ladies in their 20s to early 30s just looking to dance the night away.$2 Bud Lite drafts.  Bar service is average.  Charging cover after 11pm is unnecessary.  I guess they think it's ok since it was Saturday night.  For the record, no establishment in Hoboken should charge any cover at any bar or lounge, period.  At least I got a free Bud Light pen/bottle opener from the promotions guy and was able to enter a contest for a tailgate chair.  In case you wanted to know, I didn't win.  Black Bear seems best for watching sports.
2008-10-09,3,Decor, Okay. Staff, Not badBurger, Fine.Beer, Bit cheep?Black Bear Bar & Grill is just neither awesome nor awful like this review.
2008-09-01,4,So I've only been here once since I've moved to Hoboken, but I have a feeling that this could be my go to spot for Sunday football.  I ordered wings (hot but next time atomic) and they measured up to the atomic wings in New York.  I was also very impressed by their make your own bloody mary bar on Sundays.  I like my Bloodies like meals, and it's always fun to try some new ingredients.  The flat screens all around the bar will make this the perfect spot to see my G Men repeat as NFL Champs.
2008-07-13,3,Need a break from the pretentiousness of New York bars?  Look no further than Black Bear Bar & Grill.  Having attended a state university in the midwest, this bar reminded me of my youth.  Cheap drinks, too many mounted TV's to count, Top 40 music in the background, and a sense of complete blandness.  It may only be one PATH stop away from the city, but it was like I had been transported 800 miles into the heart of the midwest.  $3 Coors light drafts?  I haven't paid $3 for a beer in years!  Did I just spot some guy wearing shorts and a T-shirt... at a bar... on a Saturday night??   Pinch me, I feel like i'm a Freshman again.
2008-04-16,3,Somewhere in the middle.   2.5 starsThe Bear makes sure they earn the name Grill in their name - the food was good.  The specials were reasonable on the brew but I just can't justify the $8 for a shot for the build you're own bloody marys.  Come on guys!?! I have to do all the work and you're still going to charge me top shelf prices for Absolute?  Must be why that station is vacant the whole time we were there - suggestion, bring the price down to $5 at least and you've got yourself a catchy hook to get drinkers in.... My only other peeve of this place is the "no drinks only" outside rule for the patio.  This is ridiculous.  I can understand why they do this (to ensure higher ticket checks from diners for the servers) but 4 of us spent more at the bar in 2 hours than any diner in the bar... I would have tipped better too if we were allowed the outside option...
2008-03-08,3,This place is vanilla. It is a silver honda. It's a laminate floor. Nothing special. Not bad, just not great. They apparently start charging a $5 cover after 11pm (we didn't have to pay because we came early).Didn't eat here, just hung out in the crowded downstairs bar area that is manned by a bitchy looking blonde who apparently turned 26 that night and STILL looked like she hated life at 2am - which when we all decided to leave and go home where we could have done exactely the same thing without ever stepping out.
2008-03-02,4,Went to this place during Hudson Restaurant Week and had the following:Baked Macaroni and Cheese (excellent - had a bit of a kick to it - could serve as its own meal!)Chicken Samara (absolutely delicious)Warm Brownie Sundae (good but nothing special)All in all, a great place for eats.  Loved the atmosphere.  There are two floors available for seating.  Fully stocked bar.  Will definitely go again.
2008-01-16,4,So the first time my friend mentioned where I was meeting her, I totally thought she said "Bareback Bar & Grill", which made me laugh, until I realized it was just semi-wishful thinking. Anywho, beer and wings night on Tuesday, fabbb! Neither beer, nor wings are ever my favored choices, but hanging out with my friends and their coworkers here was great! The waitress was a little retarded, as she thought he were re-ordering the same pitcher of beer we ordered an hour earlier and had emptied since; but otherwise, the big screens with all the night's games, including American Idol, which, now, is a sport from what I understand, was just dandy! I don't love buffalo sauce or barbecue sauce but both sets of wings were delish, though I liked the barbecue wings better. The beer made all of it better. I must say, the blaring American Idol contestants made of quite the entertaining evening.
2007-12-28,3,Pretty nice sports bar and decent grub. Up front there's a bar, a bunch of TVs and some tall tables and high stools. In back there are regular sit down tables and some smaller TVs. Good burgers, mini burgers, chicken sandwich etc. If you stick to the basics I think you'll be pretty happy. Other people can tell you what's up stairs - not accessible - but between the up front and downstairs back I've always been comfortable. A young, hustling staff makes sure you're never thirsty or hungry.Wheelchair Access: Getting in is easy. Up front can be a little tight, but I can usually find a nice spot. I like the back lower level best. There's a nice ramp to get down there and there's lots of room. The bathroom is iffy. Getting in is OK, but the stall is too small for me. Better check it out for yourself before you down your 4th pint. Overall: For a sports bar, hang out with friends, watch the game place I'd give it 4 stars. I'm taking off 1 star (probably should take 2) for the bathroom.
2007-08-06,5,This is one of my favorite places to hangout. the food is good
2006-09-20,3,The top floor has more space and has it's own bar. Ideal for a small party. It's rather narrow so if you're more into spacious places, then it's not the place to go. It's a sports bar so you'll be able to hang out with your friends and watch the Mets or Yankees game while having their buffalo chicken fingers which are rather good. Meatloaf is a little bland but the burgers are pretty good. Parking sucks because it's Hoboken. My last visit wasn't that great because the waitress was absent minded (gave food, no napkins or forks and took off before you can ask her) and the place didn't have much customers. The bartender was really nice, she was able to give us what we needed.
2005-05-09,3,This is a great place to hang out and have some drinks with friends.  It can get loud inside, but they have tables outside too.  Their food is pretty good.  Give their buffalo wings a try.  They come in mild, medium, hot, or atomic.
