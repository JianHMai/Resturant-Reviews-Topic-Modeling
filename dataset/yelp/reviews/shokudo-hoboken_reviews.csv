2021-11-07,5,Great food! Great service!Ramen tastes great.  It's not full of MSG; it won't make you drowsy.  Friendly staff.  I'll be back!
2021-11-06,4,Very good food. Hard to find a good vegetarian ramen spot in the area. But this definitely hit the spot. Will definitely be returning for their delicious ramen! I also tried their dumplings/ spring rolls which were okay. Large restaurant with plenty of seating. The restaurant needs a little bit of renovations. I was seated in the back where there wasn't much ventilation except a small fan directly on your face. Great service, and friendly waiters.
2021-10-27,2,Very nice staff. Greeted and seated promptly on a week night. Sadly the Ramen was not great. Wouldn't come back for the food
2021-10-25,5,Can't say enough good things about Shokudo, which has become one of my favorite spots in all of Hoboken for yakitori/noodles. I LOVE the short rib/chicken thigh yakitori from here, I swear the simplicity with these types of dishes just do it for me. Simply marinated and grilled and tasty flavor bombs! Got their fried shrimp, chicken thigh yakitori, short rib yakitori and sides of ramen and pork belly that made this amazing dinner! Give them a try!
2021-10-23,1,It's unfortunate because the other items were good. But I ordered the Okonomiyaki and the center was absolutely raw.I ate a few bites and felt something off. I opened it up to find the center was completely raw and soon after my stomach hurt. Not cool.
2021-10-23,5,Amazing, the noodles taste authentic and the beef is really juicy!The bun is soft and spicy right on the spot, I haven't had this great food in years  since my last visit to Japan.
2021-10-11,5,I am so happy I finally tried this place. It's nice to have good ramen in the area, especially with cold weather on the horizon. My husband and I shared the spicy pork buns and the shrimp tempura appetizers. Would easily order the pork buns again just for myself! I had pork (tonkasu?) ramen and he had chicken ramen. Both were delicious and there were a good number of toppings you can add in. We were super full but the noodle refill is only a couple dollars and a great deal. Can't wait to return here!
2021-10-09,5,Very very delicious. Spicy bao buns are delicious. The pork ramen with extra noodles is the move ass egg and spicey!! I sit at the bar get a cold beer and just enjoy life !
2021-10-09,4,The ramen is pretty high quality! The spice is on the weaker side though if that's what you're looking for.
2021-09-28,5,It's my favorite place in Hoboken for ramen. I don't eat meat and they have a few options without it. Their vegetarian and pescatarian options are delicious, I also recommend their appetizers. I love the clean, fresh and flavorful taste of all dishes, also consistency is impressive - you always get the dish exactly how you had it last time and your expectations are always met. I really love to eat in the restaurant (they also have a nice outside sitting area), I always feel cozy, welcomed and people who work there are always very friendly and attentive. But delivery is also very good, fast and smart (I like how they deliver ramen or udon, so it doesn't get soggy). Excellent service! This business opened in the beginning of pandemic and I'm really happy that they not only survived this hard time, but also became one of the cleanest, nicest and best places for ramen in the area. PS: now they have alcohol and it's really great if you're craving some sake with your food.
2021-09-12,5,The food is amazing, and the staff is really nice and friendly. We went multiple times and we always have a great experience.
2021-09-11,2,Wow, what a disappointment. Reviews were very impressive so I was expecting something authentic and good. Their ramen was bland, too much artificial flavor, and not exactly what they will call "tonkotsu". My tonkotsu ramen was something totally different from tonkotsu. I had tonkotsu ramen in Japan multiple times and I had never experienced this flavor. It was bland and not very rich pork flavor to say the least. Pork buns were ok. Their ramen noodles are some store bought noodles that you can probably get any generic Asian market. Additionally, they don't know what drinks they have. I would order the drink and they say sure! And they keep coming back saying they don't have that..then maybe they should update their drinks menu. Overall, a big disappointment.
2021-09-08,5,Recently moved back to Hoboken and I was so excited to try Shokudo! Everything has been incredible! Big fan of the spicy pork buns and the gyoza! Have had several ramen and they are all excellent! The spicy pork donburi is also delish! You really can't go wrong here and the staff is lovely! We always come with my dog to sit outside  - they know her and are just so sweet! Would give a 10/5 if I could!!
2021-09-04,5,Amazing food at one out of 2 ramen spots in Hoboken. We ordered spicy pork buns, some skewers, shumai, ramen of course, and the tempura ice cream for dessert and everything was amazing. Great quick service and a cute place. They put a candle in the ice cream for my sister's birthday, very sweet. Definitely recommend this place!! Wide variety on the menu not just ramen. Couple of outdoor tables but mostly indoor. Wide open doors and beautiful ambiance. Was pretty empty 5/6pm on a Saturday.
2021-09-04,1,Started off badly with a nasty server who seemed mad at the world. Got the eel donburi and the eel was pretty good but the rice was terrible - almost crunchy! Tried some yakitori and was eh. Then got the whole snapper and that was really bad - was either way overcooked or just not even close to fresh. The one redeeming feature of the place was the Asahi beer, but that's not saying much. Needless to say, we will not become regulars at this one.
2021-08-27,2,Found an egg shell in my seafood pancake today. Order the short rib and when i got home it was the filet. Not a good experience today
2021-08-12,1,Ordered food from here through door dash. Got fish, pork and vegetable gyoza, some skewers. Fish was very disappointing, had a smell to it as if it's started to rot. ( can't believe they charged16$ for that). Gyoza was so so, definitely not fresh. Ended up ordering pizza after trying their food. Won't be ordering form here anymore.
2021-08-04,5,Friendly, fast and f*#$ing delicious... spicy pork buns for a quick lunch WIN! Got them to go, just walk towards the pier, pick a bench and now you have an instant picnic.
2021-08-03,1,Wish I could give lower. I work for door dash and the store employees are the actual rudest!!  I was ignored as I came in. The employee was eating and I finally had to say, "hey, I'm picking up for door dash, and I was told very rudely that it wasn't ready and when I asked how long was also told 5 minutes rudely. Below is a picture of the rude employee
2021-07-26,1,Based on the existing Yelp reviews I went for a quick sit down lunch. I ordered the chicken karage and 5 skewers(chicken wings, chicken thigh, pork, kalbi, and steak). I was about to order the ramen but I waited to order. They did not get anything right. The karage was below average at best  as the batter and the interior just didn't blend well. No seasoning. And the sauce they offer as a dip is tasteless and doesn't add anything. The size of the order was a lot but it was too much for one person. The yakitori was the worst. If you have had yakitori at any place in NYC like Yakitori Totto or Torishin, you will be severely disappointed. Unseasoned with no sauce and spices offered. They brought all the yakitori on one plate so the juice from the pork, steak and chicken were all mixed! The chicken wing was just burned to a crisp. The pork was extremely fatty in which couldn't been helped if they actually grilled it more, unlike what they advertise as being perfectly cooked. The place itself is pleasant and the service was fine. Super disappointed with quality of food.
2021-07-23,5,I live behind Shokudo and the tantilizing aromas of whatever they're cooking always drifts into my backyard and instantly makes me hungry~!  I ordered take out from them several times during the covid lockdown (they don't offer delivery).  Their packaging is thoughtfully designed to optimize the experience once you get home.  For example, with ramen, the noodles were stored separately from the broth - and you mix them together when you're ready to eat. More recently, I ate here in-person, at their outdoor seating.  The weather was perfect, and of course, the food was even better fresh.  I've had a variety of their ramens, personal favorites being spicy miso ramen and tonkotsu - both very flavorful and hit the spot.
2021-07-19,5,It is an understatement to simply say that this place's food is DELICIOUS. I dined with a large party and I was able to try quite a lot of items from their menu.Attached are the photos of all the dishes I ate. Not a single dish was less than 5 stars. I highly recommend this restaurant. I'd go here again and again and some more times over.Staff was friendly and service was great! A must go-to restaurant!
2021-07-16,3,Be prepared to waste your time looking for street parking (because its hoboken lol) unless you park in a parking garage. Employees are very helpful and kind especially our server (didnt get her name). You can feel that she really pay attention to the customers needs. Starting off with the appetizer, we ordered okonomiyaki and karaage chicken. Both appetizers are really tasty and delicious. Now on the ramen part, we ordered the spicy kimchi ramen. I'm not really impress with the taste , the broth is too bland for me.
2021-07-11,5,These pork buns & mochi are delishhh! Ramen was good I was super full sad I didn't finish my bowl and couldn't stop thinking about it the next day lol
2021-07-08,5,This spot is my absolute FAVORITE ramen/yakitori restaurant in Hoboken/JC. Casual dining with excellent food. Fairly priced. Fresh ingredients. They recently started serving alcohol as well!! Love this place so much. Try the spicy pork buns
2021-06-24,4,It was nice that this restaurant has the front open to allow for air circulation. There was no wait for our table of four. Ordered edamame and ramen. Everything was very tasty and filling.
2021-06-12,2,No longer BYOB.     Despite being very loyal to this place during Covid, they were obnoxious in saying I could no longer bring wine or pay a corkage fee. Truly disappointing and no recognition for loyalty.  I will not be back.
2021-06-01,5,Love all the ramens. Chicken karage and buns also amazing. Quick, accurate delivery - and packed really well for delivery, keeps the ramen tasting great!
2021-05-12,3,A very western take on Japanese.  The pork buns tasted like American pulled pork BBQ with a cucumber in it.  The spicy miso ramen comes with no soy-marinated egg, and let's face it - the broth might be spicy for the faint of heart, but it was basically plain chicken broth for anyone with a palate for spice.Worth it if you're looking for something fast.  Otherwise, go elsewhere.  Flavor profile = 5/10 tops.
2021-04-25,5,Loved my ramen and oyster ramen. I got it to-go and they give separate containers for the broth and the noodles, etc. highly recommended
2021-04-18,4,I've been making a thoughtful attempt at eating more ramen and Shokudo has confirmed my quest.Dropped in a few weeks ago for early dinner and had a nice meal. We started with Spicy Pork Buns (outstanding) and both had different ramen selections:The Spicy Miso Ramen was packed with flavor a yummy components, but it was a tad spicy for me. The Shoyu Ramen was much more my speed, more savory, and overall delicious. The pork in both were so so good.The one knock was how cold it was inside. We were there when a nice day transitioned into a cool night, and the front (garage) door was wide open still, so it was really cold inside the restaurant, even towards the back where we moved to.I'm far from a ramen expert but I highly recommend to anyone in the Hoboken area looking to fulfill their ramen fix.
2021-04-13,4,Found this spot nearby in Hoboken on my usual walks. It always smells great when I pass by so today I decided to order some take out. I got the spicy pork buns and the spicy pork bowl, DELICIOUS! Just enough spice to give it a kick but not overpowering where you can't enjoy the meal. Next time I'm going to eat in and try the ramen
2021-04-12,4,Finally tried Shokudo one Wednesday evening via UberEats for pickup. Our order was ready before the original quoted time. Here is everything we ordered:Flank Yakitori - this was the best skewer out of the ones we got. Flank has a reputation for being tough but this was definitely not the case hereGalbi Yakitori - this was actually a bit tough so I didn't love this oneChicken Meatball Yakitori - the flavor was good but overall, it was a bit dryMomo (chicken thigh) Yakitori - pretty good; you usually can't go wrong with chicken thighSpicy Pork Bun - I'm not a huge bao bun fan in general, so I thought this was only okay. I thought the pork would be chunks or slices but it had more of a pulled pork consistency, which I didn't lovePork Donburi - this was basically just the spicy pork bun filling over riceSpicy Miso Ramen - I really enjoyed this. What all of the reviews are saying about how amazingly packaged this was, are absolutely correct. The noodles come in a little tray that rests just above the broth. Because of this, the noodles don't get soggy but the steam from the broth still keeps it slightly warm so that when you add it to the broth, it's not one giant clump of noodles. I didn't love the cha siu (maybe it's just something about the pork here) but liked everything else about this dishNext time, I want to try their udon!
2021-03-26,5,The shio ramen and spicy pork buns are AMAZING! Ordered to go - very covid safe and fast. We can back 15 mins after ordering and everything was ready to go. The ramen comes separated so you can put it together at home (no soggy noodles!). Nice addition to the neighborhood.
2021-02-26,5,I've been here twice for a late lunch now. I'm pleased to say that the food is decent and I thought reasonable priced for Hoboken. I had the deep fried Gyoza for appetizers and the Shoyou Ramen - these paired very well together. Bathroom was also clean and spacious.
2021-02-15,5,By a mile the best ramen and Japanese in northern New Jersey.  Outstanding ramen, made fresh.   We go here once a week.
2021-02-13,5,There's ramen here, but a lot more on a long menu with better-than-expected prices for something of this caliber in Hoboken. The okonomiyaki was action-packed, with impressive flavor and size for $6, and the spicy pork buns have a commendable sauce. If you're seeking a healthier snack, the oshingko works too. The excellent modularity of the menu is helped by a long list of yakitori items ranging from $3 to $5 as of press time. I got short rib; there are various chicken varieties, shishito peppers and even tomato.
2021-02-04,5,I am beyond impressed with this place! Not only is their food fresh and so delicious, some of the best ramen I've ever had - I ordered take out and the attention to detail to keeping the food got here so neatly made my dish look and feel as if I was dining out seriously check out my pic! Would absolutely order from here over and over again.
2021-02-04,4,Called to place an order for pickup since the restaurant doesn't delivery themselves (you can find them on 3rd party apps though).  The menu was easy to navigate and there were a lot of small bite options (apps / yakitori/don burri) and also full size entrees (i.e. Ramen/fish dishes).  For my party of 2 I ordered 2 yakitori sticks, shumai, spicy pork buns, and 2 ramen orders.   When I picked up, I was surprised at how many take out orders they were filling (wtg!)   I loved the way Shokudo packaged all the items.  The yakitori was in a bbq holder with a reflective inside to keep the warmth.  The apps were placed in small boxes.  The Ramen was in the to-go ramen containers with the broth in the bottom and the noodles/fillings were placed on top in another dish so the noodles don't hit the broth until you're ready to eat.   Also, seaweed sheet was in it's own bag so it didn't get soggy or crunched. Lastly, there was utensil set holders with a spook, chopsticks, and napkins  as well as additional napkins on top.   Great packaging, but there is a lot of it.My pros that I would order again were 1) Flank Yakitori  - yummy flavor and texture.  2) Tonkotsu Ramen - awesome creamy broth!  3) Spicy Miso Ramen  - I'm always a sucker of spicy miso. *note the ramen, came with 3 pieces of chashu (i think), but  next time i'd opt for an chashu addition.I really liked the pork in the spicy pork buns, but I wasn't that impressed with the doughiness of the bun itself.  I'd try it again when I'm able to eat in fresh in the restaurant.Chicken thigh izakaya was good, but the flank was considerably better. I was not a fan of the pan fried shumai - it was "too fried" more like deep fried, and I thought the dipping sauce was bland.
2021-01-22,4,Delicious spot.  Very authentic Japanese food.  The ramen bowls were delicious.  Food was fresh and cooked right in front of you.  Great place for a quick bite and some comfort food.
2021-01-16,5,This place was actually astounding! Since COVID, I have yet to venture into the city to get some ramen at some of my favorite spots. I was excited to see an authentic ramen place in uptown Hoboken being built, and was ready to try it. The experience was amazing, the staff was friendly and very attentive to us, the food was amazing, and the ambiance was reflective of a modern Japanese cuisine spot. Awesome spot for your next fix of ramen!
2021-01-15,4,After a painful ChloeTing workout, I should have had a protein shake but instead I ordered Shokudo's Unagi rice bowl with seaweed salad and edamame. Everything was delicious. Especially the eel was so soft and fatty and had the most delectable flavor, coupled with the ginger slices it was heavenly. Since I was feeling super guilty about the food, I didn't mind the portion size for the rice bowl, but on regular days I'd probably not be happy with it. All said and done, I appreciate their Asian portion sizes but I still think they could knock down a couple dollars. $16.95 seems a bit much.
2021-01-14,4,What a great find! Today I can here w a coworker for lunch and I'm so happy we did. The place is really cute and clean. They have the glass dividers between tables. The staff is very friendly and helpful.I asked what certain things were and they were very polite in explaining. Then when we ordered they made sure to let us know what was included or not and what ingredients were inside the ramen incase we needed to know.Pork buns were great! Shredded really thin and just spicy enough. Love a fluffy bun too haha Tonkasu (sp?) ramen 24hr marinated or slow cooked whatever lol very tasty again the mean was not chewy or over cooked. No rubbery fat. Very full of flavor. Happy to come back and try more items off the menu. It was very affordable. Everything in the apps were $3-$6 I might just go crazy and sample it all.Oh! And fried ice cream and mochi ice cream?! Yes please!
2021-01-13,5,Definitely the best ramen place in this area! The yakitori is also great here as well
2021-01-13,5,Super impressed with this place! We ordered take out (Covid times), and everything surpassed expectations. Everything we ordered was delicious. And, as an added bonus, the packaging for the ramen kept the noodles from getting soggy!
2021-01-13,2,Food itself is pretty good. Delivery always wrapped very well. The pork is a little bit too fat for me but maybe some other people will like it. The broth tastes pretty smooth and creamy. The skewers are okay. Not too recommended. Chicken wings are too dry. Service is very disappointing. There is one lady took the order with me, feels unprofessional and impolite. I was taking food home so I was waiting near a empty table. When she put the food in front of me on the table, she turned back directly without saying any thing. I was very unhappy since we used to love your food so much. Hope the owner can train the staff better and more professional.
2021-01-13,5,Shokudo is the best in town. Seriously everything we have ordered from here is always delicious, packed neatly, and the food arrives in a prompt manner. Top favorites : spicy pork buns, the udon, the veggie miso ramen, spicy pork bowl, kimchi and their soft boiled egg. I love to order the veggie ramen and add an egg along with some kimchi. Also worth noting that the portions are pretty big in my opinion. There is always enough left over for lunch the next day. So happy they are in Hoboken!
2021-01-12,5,1st time getting ramen to go but it was worth it very tasty. Definitely would recommend this spot.
2021-01-06,4,I ordered the miso ramen for delivery. It was packaged quite cleverly, with a oversized paper cup containing the broth at the bottom and the noodles and toppings in a plastic tray above the broth (preventing the ramen from getting soggy). The toppings were placed below the noodles so that when you inverted it into the broth, it would be right side up. Ingenious! The broth had great richness and the right amount of salt. The pork slices were grilled instead of braised (as is typical for ramen), giving them a nice smoky flavor.
2020-12-31,4,** Doordash Delivery Review ** Since it was cold and rainy, we were in the mood for some warm, comfort food. Doordash recommended Shokudo and the menu looked pretty promising so we placed an order for delivery. We both had the Tonkatsu Ramen and split an order of the Okonomiyaki. Both were really good and really hit the spot. Everything was packaged really well - the noodles came in little tray on top of the broth. I appreciate this because it prevents the noodles from getting soggy during delivery. The seaweed sheet for the ramen was also packaged separately. The highlight was the extra soft-boiled egg that I ordered for my ramen. Oh my god, so creamy and flavorful!
2020-12-22,5,Can't get enough of this place! The food is delicious. The Okonomyaki is the bomb! I could eat that every day. Order it and it will pleasantly surprise you. The service is great. The menu is simple and everything we order comes out so good and very flavourful.
2020-12-12,5,Absolutely delicious ramen! And great customer service. We ordered our food over the phone for pickup and the food was ready so quickly and waiting for us. Ill be coming back again very soon!
2020-12-01,5,Delicious broth, delicious egg, delicious noodles....all around delicious. Usually there are ramen places that excel in one aspect of ramen but miss the mark in others. But Shokudo hit the mark on every front! Thank you for a great meal.
2020-11-26,5,Love this place!! Even with ordering takeout you are guaranteed fresh delicious ramen. They have special takeout out bowls that separate the noodles from the broth ( so the noodles don't get soggy during delivery), this was a huge game changer because many places in the area do not do this. We ordered takeout from them for the first time on Thanksgiving day and they were super speedy! Loved their Tonkotsu ramen, pork buns and their savory pancakes. Highly recommend!
2020-11-14,3,We were in town for business and craving ramen on a rainy night. Ramen options are limited in the area, but Shokudo looked promising. Parking was a bit of a pain but we eventually found a spot and walked over. The restaurant is actually quite large as it has a separate back area that wasn't being utilized.  Most of their customers were ordering take out which is wise. Shokudo is BYOB so bring a bottle of wine to share if you'd like. We started off by ordering the karaage, oshinko, and a cup of green tea. I was pleasantly surprised by the oshinko: pickled vegetables displayed beautifully in three sections atop pickled cucumber slices. Unfortunately my husband doesn't like them so it was just up to me to finish. The karaage was very fried, indicated by the color of the chicken's breading. It came with a tangy, teriyaki-ish dipping sauce that didn't feel very authentic. For our main dishes I ordered the tempura nabe udon and my husband got the spicy miso with added egg. When our orders came I realized they served me the vegetable udon and my husband's came without egg. We tried multiple times to get the waitress' attention but they seemed to be avoiding eye contact. Eventually my husband let them know about his missing eggs and the waitress said it didn't come with eggs and we just gave up there. My udon was alright, though I really would have enjoyed some tempura instead of a boat load of veggies. It's a large portion and I wasn't able to finish it all. The spicy miso came with pretty thin noodles and the broth was alright, not as thick and hearty as I'm used to. When we finally finished and donned our masks again we were unable to get the attention of anyone to get our checks so I had to go up to the counter and ask for it. There were certainly a lot of staff working that night and the restaurant wasn't busy by any means, so I'm not sure what the issue is with the service. Just seemed like everyone's head was somewhere else. In conclusion I don't think I'd return to Shokudo even if it is one of the only ramen options in the area.
2020-11-08,5,Amazing spot! We got the spicy miso ramen which had incredible flavor and spice. We also got the chicken thigh, and short rib yakitori which were very good. Finished it off with spicy pork buns which I'm usually not a fan of, but these had an unbelievable sauce. Will definitely be back!
2020-11-07,1,Me and my husband were very disappointed. The spicy pork buns and chicken karaage portion is decent but when it comes to our entree it looks like kids meal. Karaage waa delicious but I coudn't give 2 star just becasue of that. The rice is not even a cup, and the pork donburi is probably1/8 cup. For $9 it is not worth it. On the picture that was posted, it looks full but when we got it, it's not even half! I thought the Yakitori were atleast 2 sticks because that is what is posted on the picture. Since there is no description, we relied on the picture. As much as I want too, I can't recommend this.
2020-11-01,5,This was my first time trying Ramen soup and I think that this soup was the best meal that I have ever had!! Great new spot in Hoboken - I love it!  (Sophie A, 8)
2020-10-30,5,Excellent. Loved everything We had. We ordered take out and they did an excellent job to keep everything fresh. My girlfriend ordered some sort of shrimp tempura Udon and the shrimp came in a separate paper based container that kept it crispy. Simple yet effective. I'll be honest I don't write many reviews but this meal really just hit the spot. I ordered 2 soft boiled eggs to add to my ramen but next time I'm going to order 4. They were outstanding. Already dreaming about them and the head on giant shrimp skewers. I ordered online so there wasn't much human interaction but even just walking in and picking it up everyone was friendly and I just got a great vibe from the place. Would highly recommend!!
2020-10-26,5,Love this place! Have only ever had take out and they do such a great job. Yakitori is packaged in these heat retaining bags. Ramen broth is separated from the rest of the foods. My favorite is the chicken karaage. Sooo juicy and flavorful. One of my favorite spots in Hoboken.
2020-10-18,3,Based on the other reviews thought this place would be decent (and to caveat, my husband and I love the authentic ramen places in NYC).   We tried to come in with lower expectations but were still disappointed.  While the broth was ok, the noodles were overcooked/mushy, and didn't seem homemade...the pork slices were not flavorful.
2020-10-02,5,This Japanese ramen restaurant is incredible!!! We enjoyed our dinner here last night.Right when we showed interest we were greeted and then seated. Excellent service!!!We ordered the vegetable pan-fried gyoza, 2pc spicy pork bun, kimchi, momo Yakitori and flank kushiyaki. Everything came out in a timely manner. Everything was cooked perfect.The pan fried veggie gyoza had excellent flavor. Delicious tender vegetables inside. Perfectly wrapped and crispy on bottom. Came with their house made sweet and sour soy sauce which was delicious! And I don't even like soy sauce. I liked theirs.The kimchi had the perfect amount of spice! Nice heat. The cabbage was perfectly fermented. Nice crunch. So fresh! Excellent flavors.The spicy pork bun were a great portion size. Bun was fluffy; steamed perfectly. The spicy pork had decent heat and yummy flavor. Cooked perfect, melt-in-your mouth good! Tender meat. Crisp cucumber and fresh lettuce. So good!The momo Yakitori was a perfectly grilled chicken thigh skewer! Juicy and tender. Love the crunch and the flavor of the seasoning.The flank kushiyaki was perfectly marinated tender grilled flank steak. Also juicy and with a nice grilled flavor and crunch on edges. Love this!!We also seen they had Lavazza super crema coffee behind their counter..I love a good espresso. My boyfriend asked if we could have an espresso after our meal and they said that was actually for them (it's an open kitchen btw!). However! She said she would make us some. SO kind of her! Really!Their coffee grinder wasn't worker unfortunately but she gave us some of their espresso beans to grind ourselves. Such kindness!!I can't say it enough, EXCELLENT 10/10 CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! We love this place! We're planning to go back today actually for the Oyster Ramen. I'm SO excited!!!Food is delicious, perfectly priced, perfectly cooked, excellent portion sizes, EXCELLENT customer service. I can't recommend this place enough!!! Best Japanese dining in Hoboken!!!Great atmosphere.Do your taste buds a favor. Come in and try their menu!! :)
2020-09-15,5,Went with my boyfriend and he got the spicy miso ramen while I ordered the shoyu chicken broth ramen. We also got the pork buns and ginger ale, and everything blew us away. Ramen isn't that great in Hoboken, though there are really great options just a few towns over. However, this place is definitely gonna be our go-to spot for when we're craving some warm, comforting ramen in jersey!  Also, the ginger ale was home made with pieces of real ginger throughout! So refreshing!Thanks so much for the amazing food and service, everyone who lives nearby should check this place out!
2020-09-15,5,Had the spicy miso ramen and shoyu ramen...soo good. Everything from toppings to the noodles to the broth! Definitely gonna be coming back! Perfect for the cooling temp to sit outside. The spicy pork buns are a great starter, cant wait to come back and try the karaage!
2020-08-28,4,This place deserves their great reviews. Everything we had was on point. The egg okonomiyaki thing was so rich, that was our favorite find. The chicken Karaage could use some seasoning and perhaps a bit more cooking for my taste, but so soft and juicy, I don't think I ever had fried chicken with this texture. The tonkotsu ramen broth was as expected, unsure of the type of noodles but yummy nonetheless.I don't usually like ramen and I ate this one, so that's a def win in my book
2020-08-25,5,Excellent service and food! All the food tasted extremely fresh and all the meat we ordered was tender. We also got Ramen and loved it! The sauces they provide on the side were so yummy and the ramen was delicious. We were impressed and will be back!
2020-08-16,3,The food has been good most of the time.  I have had ramen and some of the rice bowls and appetizers.  I think ramen in Hoboken is lacking, but this is the best in Hoboken.  The prices are decent too.  I would give them a 4 star rating if all of their staff wore their masks properly all of the time.  They're usually good about it, but there has been a couple of time during the pandemic where some weren't wearing it properly.
2020-08-13,5,Have only ordered pickup here but food is consistent and reliable - it's become part of my weekly rotation. Shumai and pork dumplings are among the best we've had. My husband loves the chicken & beer yakitori and I consistently get the tofu & mushroom donburi. Give this place a lot of credit for opening during covid, too!
2020-08-13,4,I don't write a lot of reviews, but felt compelled to do so for Shokudo. I was very excited for this place to open, only to have a baby right at the beginning of a global pandemic. It took me far too long to try this place and as a result, I want to share my positive experience to hopefully help keep this place open.We ordered two tonkotsu ramens, karaage, and gyoza. Everything was very flavorful. We ordered to go as we still aren't comfortable eating indoors. When you walk in, the kitchen is visible straight to the back of the restaurant which I always like at a ramen place, it reminds me of some of the great places in Japan. Everything looked very orderly and clean which was great.The order was ready promptly at the stated time and as such was still piping hot when I got home. I love that the noodles and mix-ins are separated from the broth so you can drop them in when ready to enjoy. The pork in the gyoza was extremely flavorful and very moist. Compared to other asian take out places, the quality was very apparent. The karaage was large chunks of meat, lightly breaded and fried. Far from greasy, this was a nice add on to a ramen.The tonkotsu broth looked as good as it tasted. It had a nice creamy look and a smooth silky taste to it. You can tell this broth is being made nice and slow with meticulous details. The added vegetables and pork were also well prepared. No one taste overpowered anything else.Portion size is great for both the appetizers and the ramens. I will definitely order from here again and look forward to trying some other styles of ramen as well as other appetizers.The only reason I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars is that it is priced a bit to a premium. I don't mind that right now during COVID as I want the place to succeed. However this isn't exactly a "cheap" meal the way one might be able to scoop up a ramen for next to nothing in Japan. For me, the quality was worth it though.
2020-08-02,5,By far the best ramen I have had in NJ, and maybe NY. Not even that, but they could not deliver due to the city closing some roads, and I went to pick up to my surprise they gave me my order for free because I came all the way for their Ramen, because I would not eat any other!! You guys are top!
2020-07-29,5,We finally had a chance to try Shokudo and we highly enjoyed. Delivery was super quick and food was fresh and hot. Spicy Miso ramen is delicious, pork buns are super soft/fresh and everything else we ordered was perfect. Highly recommend. Hoboken needed a good ramen place, and this will now be our go-to.
2020-07-13,4,My husband and I have tried a few different things here. Ironically, we haven't tried the ramen yet. I give this place a lot of props for opening during Covid-19 - not an easy feat. We've figured out exactly what to order through trial and error -- all menu items are not equal. The seafood skewers are too salty and the seaweed salad was just okay, but I love the shumai and mushroom donburi. My hubby swears by the pork potstickers, several of the chicken and beef skewers. Food and service are both reliable.
2020-07-12,5,Honestly some of the best Japanese food I've had in a long time. I ordered for pick up and the food was fresh and hot. Highly recommend this place.
2020-07-07,5,Excellent variety of foods with good prices. Even simple items like the chicken breast skewer were very tasty. I shared multiple items from the menu and was happy with all of them. My personal favorite was the pan fried pork gyoza. Staff was friendly while ordering takeout. They do have a few outside tables as well. This restaurant will definitely become a favorite for uptown Hoboken.
2020-06-15,5,I stopped by here one Sunday and ordered a whole bunch of stuff.  They have the whole front open and with the current restrictions it makes it easy to walk up and order.  It looks like it has a good amount of tables inside too when we can sit indoors. Cool spot from a decor perspective. I ordered the pan fried shumai, fried chicken tenders, ramen, pork buns were spicy, udon noodles, and shrimp tempura.  The pan fried shumai were so good. The pork buns were spicy and delicious.  The rice bowls were the best thing we ate that night. They have a few different options to choose from and they are probably all solid choices. The fried chicken tenders weren't anything special but a good snack. The broth for the l udon noodles was flavorful but the noodles didn't have much chew to them.  The ramen was well made and the broth had a deep flavor to it. This place really did it right.  Ordering was seamless and easy as well. The order came out quickly too and it was made fresh. The portions are also a good size so you wont be hungry after! It is a welcome new addition to the area.
2020-06-12,3,Disappointed.Ordered the spicy miso ramen and pork baos for lunch via DoorDash delivery. Food arrived hot & packed well (the containers they use to separate the noodles from the broth is clever!). The pork buns were flavorful, though not a fan of the iceberg lettuce inside.The pork in the ramen was thinly sliced and yet chewy and dry. It was poor quality and tasted almost old(?) - I barely ate any of it. The noodles themselves were good and had a nice texture. The broth wasn't like miso broth I've tried anywhere else. It was more oily than spicy, and the broth was missing something - maybe some sesame nuttiness? Unfortunately, I was starving and forcefully ate the noodles (toppings were meh).Another gripe - $16 for a bowl with no ajitsuke tamago included?! For that price I can get better quality/value in the city.TL;DR - Spicy miso ramen not worth the price. Poor quality charsiu (roast pork), which made meal disappointing. Prefer South Street Ramen downtown.
2020-06-11,5,So glad a solid Japanese restaurant is opened in town. The food was good, although they need to step up their chicken karage game. I am ordering again today!!!
2020-05-29,5,In plethora of restaurants around, Shokudo is prob my favorites for Asian. Though, this is only my second time ordering. My order was same last cos the food is so scrumptious - Pork Buns, Dumplings and Spicy Miso Ramen.Pork buns - one of the best I've had. The buns are super fresh, and the pork is nicely spiced with a kick of chilly and a good hit of sesame oil. Dumplings are super nice too.Spicy Miso Ramen. Done to perfection!
2020-05-23,5,Welcome to Hoboken!! What an amazing restaurant you took me back to Japan in a simple meal. Everything so yummy.
2020-05-15,4,Oh boy! I'm so thankful for Shokudo. I had been craving ramen since before NJ was locked down. My normal ramen spots downtown were closed during the pandemic. I searched for weeks for a new place. After all this time Shokudo popped up with excellent reviews, and now I can see why! I tried their steamed pork dumplings and spicy pork buns. Both were delicious. They were cooked perfectly and had great flavor. I also had the tonkatsu ramen. Absolutely delicious. The way they package your food was awesome, and it was definitely packed with care. I will be eating from here often! Thanks for an awesome meal.
2020-05-08,4,Finally a great ramen place in Hoboken! Really happy with our food and delivery packaging was good. Looking forward to being able to try this place in person. We will definitely be back!
2020-05-08,5,This place was great! The ramen bowls were epic! Large portions and flavorful. The bao buns are delish as well! Can't wait for them to fully open so we can dine in.Quick and friendly service is always welcome here in Hoboken!
2020-04-27,5,We were nervous ordering ramen but beyond happy we did. We've now ordered here three nights in a row... it was that good. Delivery was within 15 mins of us calling every time. 100% must try.
2020-04-24,5,I was craving something warm on a cold rainy day of quarantine and decided to try out shokudo. The new ramen joint on the block did not disappoint. We ordered the gyoza, pork buns, fried chicken pieces, pork rice bowl and spicy miso ramen. All were fantastic. I especially loved the spicy miso ramen, the broth was out of this world- so flavorful yet not too fatty it's divine. I deffinately will be turning to shokudo for my ramen and Japanese yakitori needs. Try this place out, you won't regret it! Also get the pork buns they are pillowy and delicious
2020-04-18,5,This was our first time ordering food from this newcomer to the neighborhood and we LOVE everything we got. The appetizers, particular the pork buns, were outstanding. The gyoza was also phenomenal. It goes without saying the ramen hit the spot too. We will definitely be ordering from here again, its perfect food to get through these times of social distancing. Support our local restaurants and get your next dinner here - you will not regret it!
2020-04-10,5,I've been walking by this place for months anxiously awaiting its opening.  It just opened a couple weeks ago (yes, in the middle of COVID-19) so not doing takeout and delivery and only a limited portion of their full menu.  That said, everything was delicious.  Full of flavor.  Had Chicken Karaage (fried chicken with garlic) The Spicy Pork Bun - which was one of the best I've had. The spicy Miso Ramen which my son loved.  And had two of the Donburi (small rice bowl) - the chicken and the spicy pork.  The chicken was good but I give the edge to the spicy pork which was outstanding.  The description is deceptive as I thought the it was at least a medium rice bowl.   Owners were also very nice, friendly and appreciative.  Show them  and other local restaurants your live during this crisis.  Hate to see any have to close.
2020-03-22,4,Really good!  We ordered take out because of the corona virus.  The space is cute inside and looks new and clean.  Apps - we started out with edamame and steamed shumai.  Both were delicious!Entree - we ordered a Shio Ramen and Tonkatsu ramen.  I was impressed by the containers for takeout which separated the noodles from the soups. I dislike it when the ramen gets soggy, and the take out container had a top section for the ramen, pork and other ingredients.  The shio broth was very simple.  The tonkotsu was more flavorful.  There were 2 pieces of pork, I wish there was a third!I would like to try this place again and perhaps try another broth.  I would also like to get it spicy to see how that would taste.Also upon picking up the food the staff gave us porcelain chop stick holders that look like cats - so cute!  I will be back!
2020-03-19,5,My husband and I have been waiting for Shokudo to open for months, and I'm happy to share that they exceeded our expectations! We stopped by on opening day; given the latest restrictions put in place by Hoboken, they were only open for takeout or delivery. While it was unfortunate that we couldn't dine in, we still had an amazing experience! The staff were polite and cordial, and the interior seemed very welcoming. We opted for two ramen bowls and two rice bowls (one chicken, one pork). Both were absolutely *fantastic*; it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say we inhaled everything within a few minutes. I also appreciated that the portion sizes were generous, particularly for the ramen. I was pretty full halfway through and decided to save the leftovers for dinner, knowing they're easy to reheat (and just as delicious). We're definitely looking forward to trying some of the spicier options next too, but I think we may have already found our favorite dishes!Can't wait until we can dine in; until then we'll certainly be stopping by frequently for takeout!
