2021-10-05,5,Love this place for a good healthy meal.  Staff is always friendly, the ingredients are always fresh and my order is always prepared quickly. You could never go wrong ordering from here!
2021-09-10,1,I wish I could give a good review to this place, but watching the girl make my food while touching her phone and texting... then touching raw food...I can't.  How do you even do that, after the covid stuff we just dealt with!??!! That's not right!
2021-06-08,4,Quality food, smoothies and açaí bowls. My only complaint is that it is extremely over priced. 9$ + with tax for a smoothie. My go to smoothie is the Hilo and I also like the Banananutty açaí bowl.
2021-05-22,4,I was very excited to try this place as Hawaiian food is not very common in this area. Location is just one block to the 9th st light rail station which is very convenient for whoever takes the light rail to work. First of all the menu options are FANTASTIC. There were so many different things for all types of diets. I appreciate that there were multiple vegan options as well. I ordered a jackfruit taco trio. First of all they did a great job with the food. It was delicious but also light and fresh. Some points I noticed were that their cutlery and takeout items were more eco friendly than the usual plastic. Love saving the planet initiatives. I also noticed that there were so many healthy options. Which is a plus as it's located right next to a gym. Post gym poke anyone? I also think the pricing was more than reasonable as well. While I wasn't the biggest fan of the bbq jackfruit tacos, the meal was pretty good overall. I'm looking forward to going back and trying other things off their menu.
2021-04-22,4,This spot is tucked away in the Monroe Center but the food definitely speaks for itself.  I liked the poke bowl with a whole bunch of toppings. I won't bore you with what I got but rvery topping was fresh which is important. I always prefer the toppings that are crunchy like the wonton chips, crispy onions, and edamame. The sauces also worked but I wish they put more sauce on.  My wife got the chicken bowl since she is pregnant and can't eat raw fish. She wasn't the biggest fan of it so I would stick to the poke here. All in all, it is a solid choice. Poke bowls seemed to really have taken off the last few years and this is a place that does it right. Check it out.
2021-02-08,4,Yum yum yum! Shaka Bowl is awesome. Whoever said you can't eat healthy and yummy grub at the same time never tried this place. I'm chronically addicted with the Winter Special sesame chicken tacos and Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos! Spicy Salmon Poke bowl rocks my socks off too. I'm not the biggest fan of their Açaí Pitaya Oatmeal Yogurts I find the rather sweeter than I like but everything else, especially their tacos are damn good!
2020-07-13,2,I'm a poke fanatic, pretty much love poke from anywhere, but I was pretty disappointed when I got my bowl from Shaka Bowl. For 12 dollars (smallest size, without any additional costly toppings), the bowl is half the size of a bowl from any other poke place, at the same price. The fish just did not taste fresh at all and I couldn't bring myself to finish the bowl, fearing I could get sick. The Hoboken place itself is beautiful and the workers are really great and friendly.
2020-06-22,5,Their smoothies are awesome. And the staff is always really nice too. I used to work upstairs in the building and I would occasionally stop in right as they're opening. They never had a problem serving me. They're always really helpful with answering questions because I definitely asked a lot of them. And they usually have cute stickers you can just grab too.
2020-03-14,5,Cute place nestled between a few neighborhood businesses and many dwellings.  Plenty of seating and a cool vibe.  I personally love the açaí and pitaya bowls and am addicted to the banana chic chip protein balls. I want to try other things but I usually don't get past these items.  I didn't have a smoothie once or twice- very good. And got the choc chip cookies- good. I wish that they had some nutrition information available. I've asked but haven't gotten a reply.
2020-03-10,4,I recently replied to an email from the owner of Shaka Bowl about the response I got to my original review from her former business partner. She replied almost immediately to let me know that the initial issue had been addressed and that this person is no longer with the company.I'm happy to give them another chance. I believe in supporting local Hoboken businesses and was a big supporter of SB before. I was really grateful to get the reply I should have gotten in the first place. Thanks KG.
2020-03-05,2,Just picked up two bowls and tacos, unfortunately the pork was cold and the guacamole was brown and rotten.The staff is nice and friendly but unfortunately management does not invest in quality ingredients. Do yourself a favor and walk right by.
2020-02-16,5,Best poke spot in Hoboken! The poke bowls are always fresh, filling and delicious. I have also tried the açaí bowls, smoothies and avocado toast, all of which have been fantastic. The service is always quick too. Love the tables outside in the summer.
2019-11-05,5,Excellent food choices , my second time here and just as consistently yummy and healthy ! Eating a small chicken Shaka bowl with lots of add ins!!i walked in before the lunch crowd so now will order online  the extra bowl to bring home to my husband ! Love the decor too!!
2019-09-29,4,I've been trying to find a good poke bowl around the area and came across this place and my prayers have been answered! Definitely recommend  It looks to me that the small size poke bowl wasn't going to be enough for me so I decided to go with the large but I couldn't even finish it. A small is enough for you to eat and I didn't feel overstuffed or gross after eating the bowl which made me very happy. With the large you're allowed unlimited sides so that's awesome. If you get the small you're limited to 5 but even that is just the right amount. The only thing I will say is it needs just a little more flavor, I got the teriyaki sauce but seemed too much like soy sauce. Regardless the place was good!
2019-09-20,5,Yooooo, this place makes the best açaí bowls in the area, delicious smoothies (Hilo is my favorite), top-notch cold brew, and the most peanut-buttery nutella'd banana toast imaginable. Any time my parents come down to visit, this is their brunch spot of choice!
2019-09-16,1,I had high expectations of this place based on the reviews. Sadly, I did not enjoy the food or the service. Staff was not friendly and not helpful at all in explaining what goes into the bowls. The bowl I got was dry and lacking flavor. They seemed to have used regular white rice instead of the sticky rice, which is weird for a poke bowl place. I had to add my own ponzu to make it edible. Ugh. Definitely not going back to this place again even if it means I have to trek to Washington for poke.
2019-07-18,5,Great Food Friendly people. I came here for a corporate event. The food was delicious and the restaurant has great atmosphere. I would highly recommend it!
2019-07-02,5,This is an amazing additional to the hoboken food scene. I am utterly obsessed with the vegan funfetti cookie (and im far from vegan). The poke bowls they have are always fresh and amazing. The salmon peanut bowl is my favorite. I havent had a lot of smoothies here just because they arent my thing, but ive had some sips here and there and they are also amazing. Def recommend going here when u want a healthy filling meal or snack. Their bowls come in two sizes which is convenient when i just want to have a small dinner
2019-05-31,5,Friendly and enthusiastic service every time I visit! My go to is the Aloha smoothie and their salmon is always incredibly fresh  My little sister is obsessed with their pitaya bowls (with loads of Nutella) ...I recently tried Sweetberry in Jersey City and it just does not compare! Finally got to try the funfetti vegan cookies and I might be obsessed.
2019-05-06,3,Still the most expensive place to get Poke in all of Hoboken. For $14 a bowl you'd expect a huge serving size and a great selection of tasty mix-ins. Unfortunately, the bowls are very small and their mix-in list charges you for avocado/guacamole and seaweed salad (which other Hoboken poke restaurants offer for free). The last two times I've ordered from here, a substitution had to be made because they ran out of some ingredient. The very last time I went here, they completely forgot to include the protein (30% of the price and they didn't even include it) as well as the greens. Also, they usually skimp on the sauce. Overall, if you're in the mood for poke but you aren't willing to walk to Washington Street: this place is not a terrible choice.
2019-05-04,5,I really dig this place: the ambiance, self service and of course , the food. Really a hip, no nonsense "bowl" joint. I get the spicy tuna bowl ( full size) and it is pure heaven and quite big. What I like is the fact they have TVs and  a self serve hot sauce area. One of my quick go-to places for lunch
2019-04-28,5,Shaka Bowl has quickly become one of my favorite spots in Hoboken. The only thing I'm upset about is that it wasn't around when I lived in Hoboken! I've only had the smoothies and the baked goods but wow, they are delicious! My favorite smoothie is the Hilo smoothie. It's not too sweet and I love anything with peanut butter in it. What really stands out here are the vegan funfetti and chocolate chip cookies. I can't express to you how delicious these are. Usually when I have a vegan cookie, I can tell...not with these! They are always fresh and will satisfy anyone's sweet cravings. If you are in the area and looking for something healthy and fresh, this is the place for you. Their variety extends well beyond smoothies and smoothie bowls.
2019-04-18,5,This place is great! It is located on the main floor of the E Building at the Monroe Center. They have indoor seating I would say about 16 seats and when the weather warms up, they have outdoor seating as well which is quite enjoyable. This review is for the actual location and the Poke Bowls (which is the only thing I buy). They offer two size options - the snacks size (which limits you to 5 mixins only - not including the base and protein) and also the regular size which gives you free range of the whole menu with as many mixins as your heart desires. When the place first opened the portions were amazing! Then they started changing their containers and you felt like you were being cheated but now they back to better sized containers which leave you feeling satisfied and worth the money spent. My favorite Poke is the build your own version because you can truly customize the bowl to your favorite flavors. If you are unsure however, there are several predetermined choices that are equally delicious. This place is great for a healthy lunch or snack and the atmosphere is very chill and islandeque. Give it a try and you wont be disappointed.
2019-04-03,5,I went in to grab something to munch on with my boyfriend here yesterday and we loved the food! We were especially excited about the pulled pork tacos. I'll be sure to visit again in the near future.
2019-03-25,1,Maybe just stick to bowls....I was really craving a taco, but this was thoroughly disappointing.  Not only did the bottom fall out off all three, it was cold, and the chicken was completely bland. I couldn't even eat it with a fork.
2019-03-14,3,Food was ok a bit mushy. I expected more in the freshness department and its pricey for what you get! Step it up guys.. Maybe visit Fresh Coast in Newark to see how its done better. Just sayin.
2019-03-13,4,Great quick stop for a light lunch. Stopped by and made my own bowl. I had the chicken 24oz bowl with a mixed salad- zoodle base,  lots of toppings (which you could add as many as you'd like) and the garlic lemon dressing. They also add a nice amount of chicken.  It was exactly what I wanted. Something delicious and filling, but not heavy.
2019-02-24,5,The Only place to go to for Poké in Hoboken, end of story.Smoothies are awesome.Buffalo Shrimp Tacos changed my life.
2019-02-19,3,The 3 stars is soley for the oatmeal. I was so so soooo excited to try their oatmeal bowl. I went first thing in the morning, 8am right as they opened. After waiting about 15mins i finally got my bowl but was so disappointed. I was anticipating a warm spoon full of oatmeal but to my surprise the oatmeal was very cold. Maybe it's just me, but I thought oatmeal was meant to be nice and warm for breakfast. Wasn't very happy with the outcome
2019-01-26,5,So happy to have this fine place right near my studio.  My clients love their shakes and yogurt parfaits....so do I!!
2019-01-07,5,The absolutely best! The food is so good and so many good combinations. Small store front but good for takeaway as well.
2019-01-02,5,Ugh I love Shaka so much. They listen to their customers and they keep innovating while making sure the basics are covered. The food is all high quality and delicious. The best acai & poke spot in Hoboken hands down.
2018-12-26,4,I was craving some fruit bowls and Shaka Bowl came to my rescue. I ordered my usual bowl that I get at these places- acai, mango, pineapple, banana, granola, honey, and coconut. It was very good and quite filling (I had a large serving). My friend ordered a poke bowl full of fillings and it was very flavorful and good. If I return I will have a hard time deciding on what I want...fruit bowl or poke! My only complaint came with my small hot coffee. The staff clearly forgot that I had ordered it and when it finally came out (after my inquiry), the coffee was lukewarm. I told them about the temperature issue and they said it's because they put cream in it per my request. But that still shouldn't have dropped the temperature of the coffee by that much. The girl behind the counter made it again but with less cream than last time and it was fine. There's some seating inside but I can totally see this place getting packed during warmer months.
2018-12-20,5,Excellent place, nice atmosphere, I really enjoyed my poke bowl, Fish and all other ingredients were super fresh. Will definitely be back for some more.
2018-11-20,5,First trip to Shaka Bowl didn't disappoint! The butternut squash was so good I could have ordered another, my boyfriend had chicken poke and it was a really good size and very fresh and tasty, he loved it. The menu looks great and we can't wait to head back ASAP to try more, super impressed. Also get the Apple cinnamon oat muffin.... still dreaming of it!
2018-11-09,3,I've come to Shaka bowl since the very beginning and Its sad to say but this business is not the same. I used to come here and love their açaí bowls , but now the portions are way less, the granola has changed , it's just not the same great tasting açaí bowl spot that it once used to be. So ill keep it simple , I wouldn't come here if your excepting a delicious açaí bowl , especially for the price . Like $10 for a bit so great bowl . Used come here religiously but not anymore , you guys have to do something to win back your customers. I know plenty of people who have expressed the same concern about this place .
2018-10-05,3,I loved coming here because when it first began the Açaí Bowls were amazing. This was literally the only place I use to get it from but now idk if it's the fact that the recipes change or the way they made it. It just doesn't taste the same anymore. However the staff is always very nice and friendly
2018-09-26,2,I'm really disappointed with the direction Shaka Bowl has gone. I guess it's been around a year since I was last there, and there have been changed both to the structure of the menu (which I understand from a business perspective) and to the quality of the Acai bowls.Quality of food: I came here for the Acai bowls. They were delicious and had a smooth, creamy texture to them. They were also served in wide bowls so that you could mix all of the toppings with the Acai itself. Now they've transitioned to the gross ice mixture used at a few other shops in Hoboken (it's like eating a $.25 freeze pop, except this freeze pop costs $10) and it's served in a narrow bowl so that, by the time you get to the gross ice mixture, you've eaten all the toppings. The transition to a snow cone / ice-pop / worst sherbet of your life is responsible for the reduction from 5 to 2 stars.Structure of the menu: They now have different size bowls and charge for extra or premium toppings. I understand this move so no hard feelings, but since I mentioned how nice it was to get unlimited toppings in my last review, I thought I'd update it here.
2018-09-24,4,The first time I had a poke bowl was last Jan. I went back again soon after for another one.  It was delicious. I came back around the neighborhood because of a Ortho appointment and had to stop. I was going to have another bowl until I saw the Shrimp tiki tacos. I went with those. I was not disappointed. The shrimp, cabbage and sweet pineapples ...so tasty.
2018-08-13,5,Best poke bowl ever! Everything at Shaka bowl is already fresh. The store itself is a delight to walk into! The poke bowl pre made menu are all delish but I always like to make my own. You can really taste the freshness of all the fruits and fish that you put into the poke. Just writing this post and thinking about it makes me crave one right now.
2018-08-09,4,I was definitely impressed with the decor in this place and I was immediately greeted by the staff behind he counter. Although I didn't get to try any food because I had just ate but my daughter wanted a smoothie she ordered the Happy Hawaiian . I kid you not that I had in my hand in two minutes. That's fast. It was delicious perfect blend of fruits .I will definitely come back to try a Poke bowl and Açaí bowl. I saw a few people with the Poke Bowls as I was walking out and it looked yummy.
2018-08-04,4,Love this place, but recently saw employees playing with an (possibly employee's) dog and NOT washing hands prior to returning to work
2018-07-18,5,So delicious! So many choices to create a poke bowl with lots of toppings and sauces. Everything tasted super fresh! The new sides is a great addition to their menu. There açaí bowls are huge and again great topping. I recently checked out the new location and really liked the ambiance and decor. I used to live in pahoa on the big island so Shaka bowl is my comfort spot in Hoboken. It makes me feel like I'm back on the big island. The service and staff is wonderful as well, so kind and friendly. I highly recommend you check out this place.  It's my go to in spot for quick and tasteful meals.P.s- kombucha on tap is to die for!
2018-07-14,4,So I'm giving Shaka Bowl a 4 star for various reasons. Not that they aren't good because they are. They have plenty of toppings for their bowls. The reason that I'm giving them a 4 star is because I was missing some of my toppings in my bowl. Mind you they weren't busy at all at the time I went. I'm also not a fan  of their container, it's harder to get an even proportion of rice, toppings, and meat in your utensil. Also although it's good that they have chicken options and etc but you can only get ahi tuna as a seafood option. I guess I got spoiled from other poke spots. I plan on going back to try their acai bowls so well see.
2018-07-12,4,Clean, fast and healthy eating!Shaka Bowl is one of the many spots around Hoboken / JC that are serving up the poke / acai / smoothie combo. I've only tried their smoothies and they have always been fresh, filling and delicious. On my most recent trip I ordered the First Wave which had a mix of coconut milk, cold brew, banana, cocoa and coconut. Super interesting and way different than your traditional green or fruit smoothie. Plus gave me a jolt of energy thanks to the cold brew! I'm not a big fish person and I really like how they have several poke options with different proteins. You can order your bowl with chicken, tofu, shrimp, steak or pulled pork. I guess that makes it less of a poke and more of a healthy bowl? Whatever it is, I'm really into it. Next time I return I will definitely be trying some of that. They always have a long line and it's not surprising. Looking forward to returning!
2018-07-05,2,Not as good as the reviews made it seem. I was expecting a flavorful bowl but instead, the acai was watery and the fruit seemed canned. I've gotten the exact same bowl elsewhere and it tasted 10x better than shaka bowl. Hopefully their poke is better
2018-07-04,1,I LOVE acai bowls. I'm a huge fan of Acai Ya Later on Washington St., but I live on 8th and Madison, so I was extremely excited when I discovered this place about 100 feet from my doorstep. However, I will not be going back and I'll continue to make the drive across town to Washington St. for Acai Ya Later where they use fresh fruit.The Acai mix was watery, but I'll take it. The granola, coconut flakes, and Nutella were as expected. The thing that RUINS these bowls at Shaka Bowl are the fact that THEY DON'T USE FRESH FRUIT!!! The canned pineapple chunks really ruin this!! Please, for the love of God, use fresh fruit and I'll come back simply out of convenience of the location.
2018-06-26,3,I was ROOTING for you , all of HOBO was rooting for you. Like literally I'm giving the over all experience a mere 3 stars. I was running really late to work and this was the only place open that was going to be able to service me. I'm very picky when it comes to my smoothie bowls my favorite place is ( The Juice House ) so I hold every smoothie bowl place to a " juice house" standard. I had less than 5 minutes to order, get my food and be at my job. As soon as I walked in I was pissed had to go to work. The vibes were so chill , I felt like I was on the beach eating at a tiki bar or something. I was greeted with a smile and a hello from everyone except the cashier. This was my first time here and they a very large menu that I need to look over before making my selection. The ordering process was fast and simple. They took my order and made it in under 3 minutes NOT lying. That's why they are getting three stars because it was quick as hell and handed to me with a smile already in a bag with napkins. NOW The reason why I'm upset is because they are untruthful. Their pitaya base is not 100 % pitaya which I hate when places make " blends" because its not the real thing. They should note that this a pitaya or acai blend. The pitaya was so watery and tasted like bananas versus actual pitaya. It also had a lot of coconut in it as well that was not disclosed. I'm concerned because if I was allergic to anything I would not have known. I understand pitaya is very expensive and which is why alot of these places make blends in the first place to stretch the product but it doesn't taste the same. I was very disappointed in that. A 16 oz bowl is 9 dollars way overpriced. I would dine with them again but instead of a smoothie bowl I would get the poke bowl.
2018-06-11,3,My husband and I order poke bowls from here a lot. The food and options are great. But every time (literally every time) we order they mix up our selections.  Luckily we don't have food allergies but if you do be sure to check and double check!! We also have paid extra for premium toppings and don't receive them. Good place but they just need to pay attention.
2018-05-31,1,Been there a few times.  Ordered the Classic Poke Bowl today, not my first time.  Something didn't taste right today.  Just puked my brains out.  No more.
2018-05-27,5,Love their fruit bowls! Never really busy so it's easy to go in and out to grab something fast. I live close by so it's very convenient for my boyfriend and I to get a quick summer snack.
2018-05-24,3,this place has been a staple of mine for a year. (2-3x per week)once they went from one standard size bowl to two different size options things have kinda fell off. idk its from the different sizes or for the fact that literally a different person is making them every time I go now making consistency virtually impossible, which is what got me hooked in the first place. it used to be the same bowl er'time! now its like russian-acai-roulette.peace!i still love shaka, its just different now.
2018-05-16,1,Went for the first time today and the employees were rude! The cashier straight laughed in my face because I couldn't pronounce a name, so I told her whats the name of the first bowl with the banana and nutella, And she said i dont know, like I'm sorry do you not work here? RUDE. So i decided to just walk out, bad customer service. Which is sad because I really want to try it. If you don't know how to provide good costumer service work somewhere that you don't have to deal with people just that simple.
2018-05-10,4,Decent smoothie bowls but nothing special or unique, the flavors were pretty basic compared to bowls I've had in the past. I really like the atmosphere though.
2018-05-07,5,I come here everyday! Everyday twice a day  I get their Detox smoothie which is Spinach, Mango, Banana, and Lime (with water). It is delicious. Today was the first day I got their Açaí bowls. I never had açaí before, it was delicious. Pictured here is açaí, granola, almond butter, bananas, mango, and strawberries! My kids went nuts over it. My 2 year old loves the detox drinks and my almost one year old went nuts on the açaí bowl!!!
2018-05-05,1,RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL AND DISRESPECTFUL!!! I go to this place every weekend and two times that I ordered an oatmeal that's supposed to come with peanut butter it wasn't added. Today I just ordered the same thing and I just reminded to put the peanut butter and the whole bowl has more peanut butter than anything else. Really? I go back and they give me a dry oatmeal with not even half of a banana. So unprofessional.
2018-04-30,2,I used to love this place but has gone downhill a lot. The rice is cold and the sauces really bland now. Then they also raised their prices for some toppings and it is not worth it anymore. Not sure why they don't just continue the previous operations but I won't be returning again
2018-04-29,4,I love that it's not served frozen like other places. Decently priced for the amount you get.
2018-04-26,5,So I was having a really bad day and got dinner here and spilled my rice bowl when I was eating outside all over. I went back in and told them and they refilled it for free. Such nice people and the food was very good
2018-04-25,3,This use to be my favorite midweek fruit bowl stop. So sad they changed the bowl. My fruit fell out all over in the new plastic cups. You do not get the same generous portion size any longer but the price has stayed the same. I loved that they offered every fruit previously, now you can choose three fruits and some toppings are extra now. I can understand that but please bring the old Shaka bowls back.  Fruit is always fresh and delicious .
2018-04-18,5,Five stars! Hands down!  This place is so great. Me and my good friend come here almost every Tuesday. Our only complaint is that it is reaaaaalllllllyyyyy expensive. We have decided to go to Jun's Macaron Gelato because you can get a huge thing of rolled ice cream for $3 less. The açaí and pitaya bowls are quite scrum-diddly-umptious regardless. Also, the Poké bowls are very expensive too but absolutely delicious.The décor gives off laidback bohemian surfer vibes. Every time I step into the store, I feel like I'm in the movie Soul Surfer, and Bethany Hamilton is in the back. I love that! Toodles
2018-04-14,5,Ordered Molokai cacao w/ acai base...omg yummy! Couldn't finish it & added some of it to oatmeal next morning---delicious!! Will go again soon & try poke bowl.  Friendly staff. Place Was recommended by co-workers...they were right.
2018-04-04,1,I HATE spicy food, I'm also not eating meat currently. So I ordered "blackened shrimp" which they should have labeled "wasabi blackened shrimp" instead. The prices are high, the bowls are small, and what shouldn't be spicy is incredibly spicy.A bottle of water cost almost $3.00, ugh that's unreasonable All around fail.
2018-04-04,5,I ordered the honi acai bowl. It was amazing! The toppings were fresh. Atmosphere was great!  Simple taste of hawaii on the east coast.
2018-04-04,5,Honestly this was my first place that I ever tried an acai bowl. Until I moved to the jersey city area, I never had a place that made them in my area. I live 20 minutes away from Shaka bowl and I literally come here almost every day for an acai or pitaya bowl on my days off and before I head to work. I can't understand how they have any negative reviews at all! I definitely dont think they skimp on  fruits and toppings. One regular bowl fills me up for hours. The staff is always super friendly and welcoming, and they keep the place really clean. My boyfriend tried this place for the first time yesterday, went again today and will probably pop by again sometime this week. Thanks Shaka Bowl for fueling my new addiction!
2018-04-01,1,SUPER STINGYYY!!! the fruits were tinier than ever the portions are so small barely any fruit not even 1 full sliced strawberry!! Horrible !!! dont come here anymore Acai ya later is way better!! they lost a customer!!!!!! Only front girl was nice the rest of then had an attitude the whole time especially the blonde girl.
2018-03-31,2,Sad to say I hate it here. I used to come every day but the staff is sooooooo rude to their customers!! And the acai is extremely sour and mediocre. Trust me, there are better places in Hoboken.
2018-03-30,4,This place is great! I've tried almost everything here and it's my go to spot. Although the last time I went I felt the Poké bowls got smaller? One of the worst things a poke place can do is skimp on ingredients but it wasn't a huge difference and I'll definitely be back. My friend and I love to go here for breakfast, it's become almost tradition! Overall great place for a unique meal or smoothie
2018-03-17,5,Shaka has a new green bowl -spinach based with pineapple, banana, bee polen and honey... oh my... absolutely delish!
2018-03-05,4,I have been a fan of Shaka Bowl since the day they opened (yep, waited in the long line to get in).  I have since moved out of Hoboken and have tried many acai bowls, and none compare to Shaka Bowl.  I have a coworker who lives in the area, so once every few months he brings me one.  I have, however, noticed that the size of the bowls have changed - they are much smaller (17oz vs 24oz - yes, I'm a nerd and did a science experiment), but they are still the most delicious acai bowls I have ever had, satisfy all your cravings and keep you feeling full for a good amount of time. So, that being said, GO TO SHAKA BOWL.  NOW.
2018-03-02,5,I love having Shaka Bowl in my neighborhood. Always friendly service, clean, and great healthy food options. Thank you Shaka!!
2018-02-25,5,Great acai and poke bowls! New weekend lunch spot. Everything tastes so fresh and the bowl combos are great. Five stars
2018-02-17,5,I work out in this building and I had to stop in because the smell was so good.  It's really a cute place.  Even though it seems more for stop in than dine in, the ambiance is very cute and kinda put me in a good mood.  The owner was nice and answered my questions even though it was busy.The first time I wanted the oatmeal but they were out so I tried the granola with a pitaya(sp?) base. At first I was disappointed that they didn't have the oatmeal but it turned out it was pretty amazing. It's filling but also light somehow.  The granola was super tasty.  The next day I was still craving the oatmeal so I tried it.  Had the one with pb and bananas.  Very good and very filling.  I couldn't even finish the bowl.I saw the poke bowls that day and today I stopped in to try because they looked so good.  I did the make your own.  Loved it.  I got grilled chicken with avocado, mango, cilantro, edamame and crispy onions on both salad and rice.  I mixed the wasabi and teriyaki sauces.  I think this place is better than the other Poke place in Hoboken.  It's less expensive for what you get - I literally couldn't finish the bowl and saved half.  I think I eat pretty normal portions so I'd say most people could get two meals if they chose a rice base.  Plus you can totally make your own with tons of options- more than the one on Washington.  The one I chose tasted fresh and amazing.Incidentally, they had a rewards program I signed up for, which is good because this place might be habit forming.
2018-02-12,4,Updating my review from a previous time. I came back here after a while. My initial complaint was the friendliness and promptness of the staff. Well, management must've addressed the issue because it's been a pleasant experience both times since returning. My favorite is the KILAUEA, brown & white rice, choice of protein (I prefer the Ahi Tuna) carrots, cabbage, mandarin oranges,  scallions, jalapeños, cilantro, chopped peanuts, sesame weeds, wonton crips, spicy peanut sauce & sriracha. It's gots a little kick but it's great. Quick access and fast made. Thanks for updating service!
2018-01-31,2,I've loved Shaka bowl since the day they opened up! They used to give generous mix-in's, protein etc. But for the past few times I've noticed them skimping out on the mix-ins, filling the bowl with too much rice. Today I went in and saw they changed their bowls which according to them are the same size, 24 ounces but they def seem smaller and not deep enough. If I'm paying almost $15 for a lunch bowl I expect it to be loaded and not full of rice and hardly any good quantity of fresh ingredients they advertise. Needless to say, I'll find another lunch spot now...sad to see when a business takes off and does good, it skips out on the most critical piece of all- staying consistent with their food!
2018-01-23,3,I just recently discovered poke and absolutely love it! I typically order brown rice or salad as a base, with tuna as the protein, and then edamame + avocado + sweet fruits like pineapple / mango, coupled with sesame seeds and crunchy noodles, and sweet/spicy sauces. Today was my first time at Shaka Bowl and I thought it was good-not-great compared to the other Hoboken spot I've visited multiple times (Makai on Washington). While the overall dish was tasty (and I liked that they had mandarin oranges, which Makai doesn't have!), I found the price to be significantly higher, and there are fewer sauces to choose from. Additionally, my poke bowl ended up watery on the bottom / drowning in dressing, which has never happened at Makai. I'm definitely going to keep on my poke kick, but will opt for Makai instead.
2018-01-18,5,Great place right around the corner from me. I've been coming for breakfast pretty much every day for the last few weeks. Usually I get an oatmeal and a smoothie. Staff a super friendly and service is quick. The place has a calm relaxed atmosphere and the music is always good.
2018-01-02,2,I've only had great experiences at Shaka Bowl each time I visited (4 or 5 stars), but last night I got delivery from them for the first time. I was really disappointed to find frozen clumps of acai in my bowl, which has never been my experience when I bought a bowl in-store. The texture of the acai in-store has always been great. I'm not sure if this is due to it being delivered, but I know from now on I will only visit Shaka Bowl in person and not get delivery! So in conclusion: this delivered acai bowl was 1 star, but all my acai bowls I've received before in store were 4-5 stars.
2017-12-27,1,Tried this place for the first time yesterday.  Never going back.  Expensive for the little portion of fish they called dinner.  Not good.
2017-12-22,5,Good spot! Fair pricing and really enjoyed my bowl.  Only issue is that I wish they had more seating inside!
2017-12-04,5,I drive almost 45 minutes to come here. That just shows how amazing their food is.
2017-11-27,4,This place is the bomb diggity in terms of their pitaya bowls. For about $10 you get this healthy, and refreshing bowl with all the fruit/nut toppings you desire (unlimited toppings). Although the bowl may look small it's guaranteed to make you full and worth the money. I haven't tried the poke here just yet but will eventually get to it sometime in the future.What this business needs to get is a rewards program going so it'll entice customers to return more often!
2017-11-24,3,Obsessed with this place but went there 20 minutes before closing and they told me they were already closed. They should update closing time if that's the case.
2017-11-23,5,For the slight premium this place has decent healthy food options. I usually order build your own bowl with seafood protein, rice, and an abundant amount of toppings. Resulting meals is pretty satisfying. Overall I think food here is fairly average and more expensive for Hoboken.However, I personally highly recommend the smoothies. Plenty of healthy, nutritious, and innovative options will satisfy people with variety of taste.
2017-11-20,3,Had the chicken teriyaki bowl - it was tasty, but for the price, needed to be better. Skimpy on the sauce and only included about 4 small cubes of avocado (which would've added moisture in lieu of the sauce!). Added extra avocado at home.
2017-11-03,5,I'm really excited to see a new location opening on Washington street in Hoboken . This is absolutely the best spot for poke/acai as well as other treats such as nitro coffee , oatmeal bowls & smoothies . For some reason this place just does it the best . The ingredients are super fresh and the portions are compatible with the prices. I've tried various other places for bowls both in and out of Hoboken and this place is really the best. Aside from the good the aesthetic of the decor, menus and cutlery really go with the theme of the food & this is important . Their seasonal menu variations are really cool too and make you want to continue coming to try new things. I really commend the two owners who are both young entrepreneurs who have nailed a successful timeless business
2017-10-28,4,Good tasting! Fast service! Only down side it's too far! Alllllll the way down by Monroe street! Hope it's Washington Street location will open soon
2017-10-27,5,We love Shaka Bowl!  We are addicted to the acai/pitaya bowls and we also love the Poke bowls!  The service is great and the food is always on point.  The owners and staff are very friendly, and remember us every time we come in!  Highly recommend!
2017-10-22,2,I ordered an açaí bowl and was very disappointed. The base was tasteless, it tasted like straight ice and a hint of blueberries.
2017-10-07,5,Delicious! So nice to have healthy options like this in Hoboken . Large portions and the food is really good quality. Such nice customer service. My husband and I will be back!
2017-10-06,5,My favorite neighborhood spot to grab a quick healthy dinner. I love the ahi tuna Shaka bowl. Service is always on point as well. You guys should add some ginger cayenne juice shots to the menu ;)
2017-09-16,3,Seeing a lot of new poke spots opening up in Hoboken and was excited to see this spot have Acai bowls too!! The place is a little more tucked away compared to all of the shops on Washington St. The place was clean with adequate seating inside. The menu was pretty expansive and service was quick. There are house specials, but I ordered the BUILD YOUR OWN bowl ($14) with brown rice and zucchini noodles as the base. FYI - If you get the zucchini noodles, your bowl is going to get soggy with a lot of water sitting at the bottom. Ordered the TUNA with AVOCADO, CUCUMBER, PICKLED ONION, SCALLIONS, MANGO as mix-ins. For toppings ordered the SESAME SEEDS and CRISPY ONIONS (they have unlimited toppings whch is great). Went with the PONZU sauce. Overall, my biggest feedback is that they need to cut their toppings much more finely. Eating it was not only difficult in that small plastic bowl, but also clunky - a first time experience I had with a poke bowl. A poke bowl is meant to resemble a sushi hojpoj and this felt like someone roughly chopped veggies and threw them in a bowl with some raw fish. Didn't feel very genuine to me.The ACAI BOWL ($10) was much better. They have fresh acai juice there instead of the frozen, pre-packaged stuff, which is a biggie. Unlimited toppings here too so sensibly went with every listed fruit cause why not. Got GRANOLA, ALMONDS, CHIA SEEDS and HONEY as toppings. All in all, will be coming back for their acai bowls, but not their poke bowls. There are some better poke spots in the area that aren't as expensive in the area.
2017-09-05,1,Glad you updated your store hours on all the major online sources before I made a special trip 20 min out of my way. Oh wait, you didn't . For others, they now close at 9pm.
2017-09-03,3,Shaka used to be one of my favorite spots in Hoboken.  Both fruit bowls and poke bowls have great flavor and large portions justified the $10-$14 price point.  However, they recently cut their bowl sizes in half but are still charging the same price.  Such a disappointment and definitely deters me from going back.
2017-08-23,3,3.5 stars. I got a build your own smoothie and a build your own poke bowl. The smoothie was good and you can add as many ingredients as you want. They made it fresh and it's a good size drink for $8. The poke bowl could be better. I wish they had salmon as a menu option. Their Shaka sauce could be spicier too (it was described to me as being similar to spicy mayo). Also, they upcharge $1 for avocado. They should have told me that before making my order. I'd go back for the smoothies and try the acai and oatmeal bowls, not so much for the poke.
2017-08-20,4,Acai and pitaya bowls are really yummy. A nice refreshing treat for breakfast. The poke bowls were good too. Parking can be a little challenging.
2017-08-19,5,One of the best acai bowls I've ever had and fantastic service. My only complaint is that they haven't opened their Washington Street location yet!
2017-08-08,5,Just tried Shaka Bowl for the first time after it was referred to us. YUM! A little pricey at $15 per bowl but it's a hearty meal and you can taste the quality of the products they use. I got a house favorite that was some sort of teriyaki and it was delicious! We will definitely be back to try some other combinations!
2017-07-24,3,I came here a couple weeks back and was not a fan. For one they lacked a variety of protein options compared to other places, I was very surprised that they didn't at least have salmon as an option so I had to stick with ahi tuna. The amount of add-ins and toppings to choose were good and fresh. When I received my bowl I felt like there was definitely not enough fish in it for the price I paid. I also ordered a Sunny Spirulina  shake with added protein, no complaints. I loved it and definitely think the price was good for the size I got.
2017-07-16,1,Just tried this place for the first time and ordered the Big island Acai bowl.  So first off, for $10 I did NOT get nearly as much product as I had hoped.  The bowl is wide but very shallow...deceiving. I asked for no granola..too bad, I got granola.  So since I was forced to eat it, the granola was cold, tasteless and almost broke a tooth because it was so hard.  The acai was bland and watery.  There were maybe 2 tiny sprinkles of bee pollen and like a teaspoon of honey glazing my bowl.  I got it to go and was hoping to make it at least to my apartment but it was runny by the time I drove to the nearest stop sign.  So I pulled over and ate by the construction site on Monroe and 2nd.  The fruit was at least fresh but I had two bites and had to throw it out for the aforementioned reasons.  Awful, never coming back even if I was near death starving.
2017-07-16,3,Acai bowl was good. Only complain is portions are very small. Other acai bowl shops use a deeper, bigger bowl. Theirs is sort of short and flat. High price, small portion.
2017-07-15,3,Came to this place because of açaí... not the best Açaí I had, Not the Playa Bowl, açaí blend is watery, mixed with too many things... good serving of fruits and granola. Need improvement on the açaí base.
2017-07-06,3,Decent size, good value (it's like 3 sushi rolls)...but not real poke.  The marinade on top of the fish is not authentic. Great concept but poor execution.I see from all the reviews that people complain about the price, however due to the portion size I believe it's more than fair. If I was in the area looking for a nice easy clean lunch, I would deathly come here. Now we, if you are looking for authentic Hawaiian pokey, save your changes and fly to Hawaii.
2017-07-03,5,Great addition to the neighborhood! If you're not a poke fan they also have delicious shrimp and other toppings. The rice bowls are copious so can make two meals out of it (I love the bowls with pineapple and crispy onions) and don't miss the strawberry lemonade!
2017-07-03,4,The food choices in West Hoboken continue to grow, and Shaka Bowl is another welcome addition.  I've visited twice and tried various ingredients in my customized poke bowl. You receive a generous portion for $14, with plenty of protein, so definitely come hungry or be prepared to take some home.  Everything tasted fresh and of good quality, only note might be the blackened chicken was a bit bland. The servers/preparers are very professional. Both the food service and the seating areas are kept very clean.  It's a small place and ten people could make it feel crowded, although there are a few, small outdoor tables for the nice weather.Shaka Bowl has a loyalty card where you can eventually earn a free item. The hours are excellent, open for early morning coffee and oatmeal, straight through to lunch and dinner. Acai bowls, smoothies, and frozen yogurt are also popular choices.  I highly recommend supporting this small business providing the west side of Hoboken with great, healthy food choices.
2017-07-02,5,Amazing addition to Hoboken! All their ingredients are really fresh and they have unlimited toppings! Their workers are all extremely kind and helpful, and are extremely speedy! Perfect spot to enjoy a casual meal. Will definitely be returning.
2017-06-21,5,So I love this place! First of all PITAYA!!!! The shakes are amazing. The bowls are fresh and delicious. I do think the prices are a bit high but I enjoy the food so I will keep returning. I stop in at least once a week. Try it out!!!
2017-06-16,5,The best acai bowls I've ever had, so much better than any place you will find in Manhattan, ABSOLUTELY LOVED our Shaka bowls! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
2017-06-13,2,First time trying this spot in Hoboken. Extremely disappointed with everything from the service to the food. First of all, all of their poke bowls only offer ahi tuna which is disappointing at best. I ordered the mauna bowl with white rice (recommended to me by one of the employees) and for $14 was not impressed. I took the bowl to go and found no avocado in it and the rice was cold and flavorless. What did I pay $14 for?? It was overfilled with scallion and jalapeño, had very little tuna, and was overall just super spicy and unenjoyable. Also seemed like the sauces were just thrown onto the tuna to make it not seem so bland. Now onto the service. I was not greeted when I walked in and since it was my first time being here I had a few questions. The woman assisting me seemed irritated and annoyed when I asked her for recommendations and made me feel like a nuisance for coming in and asking questions. I'm sorry, but you work at a restaurant, obviously people are going to ask you about the food you are serving. The 2 stars is for the detox smoothie I got as well. It was super yummy and the perfect drink after a workout. Overall, if you're looking to get good poke in Hoboken, Makai is much better quality.
2017-06-10,2,Fake poke joint! They don't have salmon; then ran out of tuna and all they had left for a poke bowl was chicken or shrimp. Toppings aren't your normal poke bowl toppings either.
2017-06-05,4,checked this spot due to its close proximity to my new apt in hoboken. I was impressed with overall freshness and quality of ingredients in my bowl. It's also super easy to customize! i ordered one of the pre built menu options, "pineapple a day" with half zoodles/ brown rice as the base vs. having all rice. My attempt at being healthy!I loved the sauces it was tossed in (spicy shaka and teriyaki). the pieces of pineapple were super fresh and added a nice tang. also a generous serving of tuna too, they dont skimp on anything here!my only complaint was the wait for my food. there were three ppl in front of me, and it felt like forever for me to get my to go bowl. nice indoor/ outdoor space to sit and enjoy as well.
2017-06-02,5,So delicious, and for $14 you get a massive bowl, filled with the base of your choice, protein, and toppings. They do not skimp on anything. If you're trying to be healthy whole still enjoying the meal, I suggest doing a bowl of half brown rice and half zuchini noodles.  The zoodles are crispy, fresh, and don't change the flavor of the bowl at all, so its a great way to stuff your face without all the calories and carbs! I've had their poké twice now and everything was delicious both times. Mauna kea is my favorite - the combination of sweet from the mango, and the kick of the fresh, thinly sliced jalapenos is amazing!
2017-05-29,4,Shaka bowl is pretty solid-if you haven't gone, you should check it out.Here's why:  1) it's pretty health-centered (salads, proteins, natural fats, etc), 2) the price isn't too bad (the bowls that come with either salad or rice run about 14, and that is very very filling-especially if you get it with rice), 3) they have tasty breakfast/smoothie options too (we just recently tried a potato bowl, and it was so big, I had breakfast for the next day ).  The downside:  there's not a ton of room (probably only enough for 8-10 people to sit), more importantly they run out of key ingredients (this is THE reason why I can't give them a 5, and almost have them a 3).  All in all-convenient, healthy option for a meal any time of the day!
2017-05-26,5,Fresh food at an affordable price. great customer service.  ordered for the family once and for myself a few times and was always satisfied.  great addition to the food choices in Hoboken
2017-05-24,1,I had multiple good experiences with Shaka Bowl... until Tuesday morning came. I ordered the molokai Cocao in acai bowl, which I usually get Pitaya, and it was one of the worst decisions of my life. I only ate half of it and I had my whole day planned out but then I uncharacteristically got stomach pains, nausea, and vomiting and bedridden for half of the day. I was in such denial about my horrible sickness to be from Shaka Bowl so I had one spoonful of my leftovers and got the same sickness that I had to force myself to vomit. i usually don't leave good or bad reviews but this was a terrible experience and I am staying away from this place for awhile. Shaka Bowl, you need to make sure your ingredients are fresh and up to date if you're serving fruits and fish.
2017-05-23,5,Just as good as some of the Acai Bowels I've had in Hawaii! Highly recommend it!
2017-05-19,1,Tried this place on at least three occasions. Food can be good but service is absolutely awful. Waited for over twenty minutes for a salad while watching an employee eat food right in front of me. $20+ for a salad can be spent elsewhere.
2017-05-17,3,Food is fantastic. I would come here more if the wait wasn't so long. And it's not a "this place is so popular so the wait is long" wait. There can be three people and it will take 5+ minutes in line, 5+ minutes to receive your order. This is raw fish. They aren't cooking anything! I don't get it. Putting the poky in poke bowl, for sure.
2017-05-17,5,I've been to Hawaii 7x and this is the closest thing to their AMAZING poke bowls. This is my new fave spot for poke bowls.
2017-05-15,5,Fully customizable Poke bowls on the West side of Hoboken? Can't go wrong with that. I've been here twice so far since my girlfriend lives in the area, and I've loved it each time. Ordering is simple (it's a card that they circle your selections on with a dry erase marker) and they were good at dealing with food allergies (prepping food away from certain ingredients). My bowl was packed to the top, and I actually had to save some of it for a snack later that night. Payment is easy through a tablet. They have a rewards program that was easy to sign up for, but I haven't visited enough to get any of the benefits. Decent amount of seating indoors and outdoors.As one of only two poke spots I know of in Hoboken, I'll definitely be back for more.
2017-05-13,5,Good food in huge portions. One bowl could be split by two people. Loved it. Will definitely be back
2017-05-08,5,I'd give more stars if I could. Absolutely delicious. Mauna Kea(?) bowl was fantastic. Added the crab salad and it was delicious. Also, for a place that doesn't have table service the counter service was super friendly. Everyone here was really but special thank you to Rob for the great, great service.
2017-05-06,5,Really good! Fresh ingredients, reasonable prices, and friendly employees. Best breakfast bowls in Hoboken
2017-04-30,4,This is a great spot! The poke and acai bowls are large enough to have left overs for a second meal, though my last visit the poke bowl wasn't nearly as large as the first time. Perfect that it's In the Monroe center-makes it easy to pick up food after my am and pm barre classes
2017-04-19,5,Awesome place to dine in and take out, Reminded of the vacation to Hawaii. I have tried
2017-04-11,4,Gave Shaka Bowl a chance to redeem their self after the ridiculous experience I had a little while back and 1, they much be doing a lot of things much better since the line was out the door and stayed out the door from the amount of people that day. And 2, the bowls were packed back to the top again and not sloppy like last time. They're adding a flower on top I guess for show? Idk it had honey on it and you can't eat it so I placed it aside and tried not to get the table dirty. Otherwise it was great, fresh fruit, pomegranate seeds is the seasonal fruit and totally reccomend that! And they have hemp seeds now! Got them too. Not sure if this was for us or not but got a discount too (on top of my rewards points) the girl a the black hair and glasses has always been sweet but she was walking around asking everyone was enjoying their meals. They had table set up outside now too for spring.
2017-04-08,5,Wanted to try this place since it opened! Line was out the door and well worth the wait. Staff was very friendly and once we ordered, we were able to snag a table outside to eat. Got bowl with zoodles (not on menu so make sure to ask) and loved it! Very large portion and you can choose as many add ones and toppings you want. The acai bowl was delicious too!
2017-04-04,5,I picked up delicious bowls for my sister and I for dinner tonight and I must say I was impressed. I absolutely love ahi tuna and the poke bowls were so fresh and flavorful. A great size for the money and I loved that they had an alternative to a rice base. The greens were delish! I can't wait to try some of the acai bowls for breakfast. If this is what I have to get used to eating in Hawaii I have a feeling I'm going to enjoy my Hawaiian vacation this Jun! I will be trying again!
2017-04-02,3,It's relatively good as long as you do not expect authentic poke. I am ok with their interpretation of poke in any case.I didn't like to music too loud and the high tables and stools.Would only recommend it for take out if you are up to a "different" poke.
2017-04-01,1,Complete copy cat of total nutrition, now serving even the same bowls as them but poorly executed and the staff is very unknowledgeable and not friendly. I went in there to try an acai bowl with only one person in front of me and took almost 20 minutes to get my bowl. Than when I got it, it was completely wrong and melted to boot. I asked for a new bowl and they said that's how it's suppose to be. I've had over 1000 acai bowls so I know their not suppose to be served melted. I usually give a place a second chance but with the terrible service, not this time!!!
2017-03-29,5,I love this place and love how close it is to my apartment! The nanner is my favorite oatmeal bowl by far, it has peanuts, peanut butter, banana and something else I can't recall but I promise it's delightful!! I have also had some of the juices from here as well as a poke bowl. The poke bowl was flavorful and fresh as were the juices. Pricing is fair for what you are getting. I am SO happy to have this place nearby. I wish they delivered because someMornings it's so cold and I want to have oatmealBut not walk my butt over there! Although hey it keeps me moving at least! Definitely check this place out!
2017-03-28,5,Outstanding Poke in Hoboken!!!While spending my day in Hoboken I decided to stop by this spot for a quick lunch.  Really quaint and relaxing atmosphere.  I decided to order an ahi poke bowl with white rice, avocado, scallion, mango, jalapeño, cilantro, and wontons w/ spicy Shaka sauce.  They made the bowl in what felt like a minute.  Seconds after taking my first bite the fire alarm went off... initially I was caught off guard, but I then realized exactly why the alarm went off.   THIS PLACE IS FUCKING FIRE!!! ABSOLUTELY LIT!!! The alarm went off about 4 more times and each time made more sense than the last.  It is an absolute must the next time your in Hoboken!  I found my Shaka! Flex.
2017-03-27,4,Went here recently and tried the available bowl. Really good and huge portion! Great value and something new for Hoboken!
2017-03-21,4,This was my first poke bowl experience, and I am now a HUGE fan! Super delicious, fresh ingredients. Each time I have been back, the staff has been super helpful with great recommendations.
2017-03-21,5,Six of us went in just after Christmas and we all walked out loving this place and no one left hungry.  Each portion was not only generous but very tasty.  They seemed to have figured out the right ingredients for their recipes, bravo.  We all sampled from one another's plates and each one was incredibly delicious.  The smoothies were excellent as well.  Love the fact that you can build your own dish.  Good luck, I hope to see more Shaka Bowls opening up.  Hands down, this is a FIVE STAR review.
2017-03-15,5,Really like this place!  I dine there at least once a week after working out upstairs.  Great, fresh ingredients!  Love the Pineapple A Day bowl for dinner.  Oatmeal for breakfast is hearty!  They are not stingy with the servings.  Very clean operation!
2017-03-14,5,The freshness of the poke bowls is great. They have a great variety of ingredients so that you can build your own bowl, which I always do. Their smoothies are very delicious and healthy also. I have not tried their acai bowls yet but soon will. Now, the service is hit or miss, either its great service or not. I've been when it's slow and the service was great, but when they are busy, service goes down the drain. They just want to get the people in and out so they can get rid of the rush. It is a bit pricey also but won't deter me from coming back.
2017-03-12,5,So happy I found this place! Right by the light rail so I can catch a bite to eat on my way home from work. Delicious food! A bit pricey but they use premium, fresh ingredients. I had the chicken poke bowl with veggies and teriyaki sauce as well as a banana shake which came out to $23. So good! Staff was friendly. There were two people ahead of me but I received my order in less than five minutes. Excited to finally have another healthy option in Hoboken! Too many pizza and junk food places in town!
2017-03-06,5,Love this place. Not only is the food great at fair prices, but also the service was also amazing! Recommended for everyone.
2017-03-04,5,Reaally amazing Ahi Tuna poke bowls. Ingredients are fresh, great smoothies! I'm sure more locations will open just like it. It's different and delicious
2017-03-02,5,New family run business in Hoboken and I love this place. All ingredients are fresh and bowls are made to order. Poke and acai bowls are very large and great quality for the price. I will be returning weekly.
2017-02-27,1,Being a local girl from Hawaii I crave certain foods from time to time, poke being #1 on my list.  So, lo and behold, "Shaka Bowl" in Hoboken offers poke bowls.  I live North Bergen and its a short ride to the place.The staff was very welcoming but the poke bowl itself is NOT anything to write home about nor share with anyone else.  Total disappointment.    The rice was not fully cooked.  Nishiki sushi rice would have been a good choice...It shouldn't be that hard to cook rice in a rice cooker.I am going to give you all a second chance ...let me see if you truly know how to make an acai bowl!Aloha a hui hou!
2017-02-26,5,I've been coming here at least once a week since they have opened. The poke bowls are amazing and the tuna is always fresh. I love the first wave smoothie as well as the nitro cold brew. Staff is always nice and service is fast. They recently just added new bowls and smoothies to their menu and I can't wait to try them!
2017-02-23,4,I've been dying to go back to this place. It's small a small space and was pretty busy when I made my way there on a random Sunday evening but I'd prefer to eat my bowl in the comfort of my own apartment anyway. I chose to make my own poké bowl. It seemed a little pricey, especially considering it was takeout but I guess that's the going rate these days.
2017-02-22,3,Everything I have had is pretty good, but nowhere near as awesome as the poke in Hawaii. The food is very fresh and great quality, but the pricing is a bit high and parking is tough.
2017-02-20,5,So there's a new craze the Poke bowl and the Acai bowls!! And this is the place to try both. Yes it's a little more pricey but the bowls are a big portion. Sometimes I can't finish the entire thing. And everything is very fresh! Both fruit used in the acai and the protein and veggies in the poke. So the poke bowl doesn't start until 11 am but the acai or pitaya bowls are all day. You can also get smoothies and coffees as well. So for both bowls you can choose the selections but you can create your own too. The menu is very simple for either bowls. You choose a base then the toppings. There is so many to choose from, and if you have any questions the workers are very helpful. They're always glad to help! You can join the rewards club and receive points and they have an app too.
2017-02-20,5,Got the big island bowl with strawberry, blueberry, banana, granola, bee pollen, and honey and literally can't stop eating it.Got a pitaya base but you can also get acai. They also have Rina bows which look super fresh. My bowl was 10 which I though was pricy but it's huge and enough for two people. They should make a smaller portion for a lower price
2017-02-09,4,Love the concept and location- ladies behind the counter were friendly! I made my own Poke bowl with ahi tuna and assorted all- you can choose toppings. It was a huge serving and I felt like for 14$ it was a great deal. I even tried the red velvet frozen yogurt and it was delicious. My only complaint was the amount of dressing- it was a little heavy and a bit too spicy but next time I'll get it on the side ;) I also can't wait to try the Acai bowls- glad to have them so close to my apartment! I will be back- Thank You Shaka!
2017-02-09,4,This restaurant is adorable. Such an interesting idea! I made my own poke bowl and it was fantastic except for the amount of dressing they put on it. Asked for it on the side but they still put it on the bowl, it was all I could taste. I would love if they got different more fresh/healthy sauces for the bowls, both sauces I asked to try tasted like ranch. I'll be back for an acai bowl and another (no dressing!) poke bowl!
2017-02-06,3,Went there when it was pretty new, loved it! It's a very small place but cute! Since it's Poké Bowl you always need a little time with your order but the staff (I think she was even the manager or something) was rushing us and wasn't too friendly, which made me moody already since I love to actually enjoy my food and the food/restaurant experience. Also there was nobody behind us, so not sure why she had to do that, the girls behind the bar who made our bowls were super friendly tho, which made me happy again.! The Bowl was great, the price is like Manhattan prices (in Hoboken -meh-) they need more variety with the fish tho, they just had tuna (and shrimp and chicken) which is very little compared when I went to Cali. Definitely would go back since it's the closest Poké Bowl spot around me.
2017-02-05,2,Was excited to finally try them and happy to see more restaurants open in the back of Hoboken and while my meal was tasty it definitely did not warrant the ridiculous price of $15. The options for the meals are sparse and they put about 3 ounces of meat in your meal so I paid $15 for a bowl of rice with a few chicken pieces and some crummy veggies. Thumbs down.
2017-01-28,4,Definitely a fan of this place! Welcome to Hoboken - you are needed and wanted here. A great place to get poke, acai bowls, and their unique sweet dragon fruit (pitaya) bowls (ask to try it if you are curious, I was!). Its a little pricy, but for the quality and type of food you are getting, thats what it is. The people working there are super nice and helpful and patient for anyone with questions and special food needs. Its primarily a take out place since seating is limited and its a small store front, but thats standard for many of the convenient food places around here. Parking is tough, but thats to be expected and something they cant control.On Whole 30? - this place works for you! I feel like 30% of Hoboken is doing this now so I feel its worth it to include in this review. Get the Mauna Kea over salad, remove the spicy shaka dressing, and make your own (coconut aminos and sesame oil) and bam! Put some flavor in your mouth. Happy shaka!
2017-01-25,5,I've been here twice on the recommendation of a co worker and it's been beyond outstanding both times! The food is fresh the service is quick (even with a line which there often is) I've done build your own poke bowls both times and have literally licked them clean. I'm so happy to have a poke place in Hoboken close to home! They also do acai bowls and other cool breakfast smoothies I'll defiantly have to try out soon! Highly recommend to anyone in the area!
2017-01-25,5,Delicious! Live a block away and now go here regularly. It's great tasting and really refreshing. A little pricey but worth it in my mind to get honest to goodness quality food that makes you feel good.
2017-01-23,3,The fish to rice ratio for the poke bowls could be better, otherwise I'd say these are well crafted bowls. Felt hungry after eating my Mauna Kea. Sustainability is a core value of the Hawaiian culture, so it would be nice to know where their fish is sourced from. Be sure to go earlier in the day as they ran out of fish the first two times I stopped in. Look forward to trying their smoothies and acai bowls next time!
2017-01-22,5,This place was awesome! I got the mauna kae with extra tuna and it was way more tuna then I expected which was a big plus! Their cookies were also out of this world!
2017-01-22,4,Great place! Only compliant is the super expensive price. But they do give you extra toppings (minus proteins) with no charge!
2017-01-21,5,What a delicious place! The poké was so fresh and the sweet shaka sauce is the best combo. After being in Hawaii I agree with the founders you become obsessed with poké and I'm so happy they decided to come to Hoboken. It's great to see more diverse food options coming to town. The combinations are creative but you can also cater a bowl to what you like. I can't wait to go back!
2017-01-18,5,I really dug Shaka Bowl when my boyfriend and I stopped by a few weeks ago on a snowy Saturday. They have a great selection of bases - including zucchini noodles!!! - as well as proteins and toppings. The sweet and spicy shoyu sauce is really solid. There are also pitaya and acai bowls with tons of toppings, homemade desserts, and coffee. I'll definitely be back!
2017-01-15,5,I have been here a couple of times. I love the new Acai and poke bowl movement. They are absolutely delicious and best of all you do not have to feel bad for eating one. I like the cacao Nutella Acai bowl; it's super filling and a nice power breakfast/lunch. The Acai Bowls will run you 10$.I also enjoy the poke Bowls, I usually just build my own. You can mix and match greens with a base and general protein. Add some sweet and spicy sauce to give it a nice kick. Poke Bowls are a bit more expensive running you 14$.Even though this place is a bit expensive it is still much cheaper then NYC spots. Good luck with parking in the area. Also it is a small seating area.
2017-01-12,5,Just what I want in lunch--healthy, fun, tasty.  The poke bowls are just the right size.  Service is quick and nice.  I got the Mauna Kea and took it home--it was even better with some soy sauce.  So glad this place is here.
2017-01-07,4,The food bowls were awesome and A LOT of food, super fresh ingredients ... only complaint would be I came back a couple weeks later and they had run out of tuna. Told me that's because they get a fresh shipment each day and they had already run out.  I'll be back though.
2017-01-05,4,Poké is popping up everywhere, and i'm glad to see that Hoboken isn't far behind on this trend. Sons of Thunder and Pokéworks in the city, Shaka Bowl in the NJ.While the entirety of the bowl is important, what really makes or breaks poké is the fish. It needs to be fresh, marinated correctly, and served in a bowl with rice of the correct temperature, with a lot of fun toppings that add to the flavor without overwhelming it. Shaka Bowl does a nice job with all of these things.The price is fixed - which is good. It's not cheap, but you can get (literally) everything on it if you want. Trust me, you want everything. It's a nice balance of spice, sour, sweet, fruit, salt, and, of course, the fish. It's not the most convenient location (it would be if I still lived one block away) but you'll have a pretty easy time parking to run in and out. I'm sure poké will continue to pop up both in the city and in Hoboken, and they, so far, have some pretty stiff competition. Yes -- I know they have other food, but I would be hard pressed to come in here and not get a bowl of deliciousness.
2017-01-05,2,No good...was super pumped for a poke spot in Hoboken, but first and only experience was not good...the brown rice was raw as can be, to the point that I thought I chipped a tooth. Also, there was barely any tuna in the bowl. So I payed 14$ for a bowl of uncooked rice. Not sure if I will give it a second try after that experience.
2016-12-31,3,Poké bowls in Hoboken?!! Needless to say I was hyped to try this place out. Maybe I was overhyped... maybe the memory of authentic poké from Hawaii still lingered on my palate... while the food was ok and creative it didn't quite live up to the hype (admittedly, self manufactured by me). The pros- fresh ingredients, simple menu, nice staff, zucchini noodles!The cons- terrible rice - it should be sushi style that is sticky and sweet not dry and flavorless, costly at $15 per bowl.
2016-12-18,4,I love this place. Food is fresh and healthy, and presentation is beautiful. I'm a big fan of the poke bowl, and all the options for add-ins, sauces, toppings and base (great that you now do zucchini noodles!) are fantastic. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the last two times I have ordered an add-in didn't make it into my bowl. Yesterday I ordered the Mauna Kea and the avocado was missing. Last week I ordered the Mauna Kea and asked to add napa cabbage, and that was missing. It's always disappointing to bring your food home and then realize it's not exactly what you ordered, but notwithstanding the occasional missing ingredients the food is good enough to  keep me going back. Shaka Bowl is a new establishment, so I'm hoping they will improve with the ingredient accuracy in the coming weeks. Once they get that resolved they will be a solid 5 star.
2016-12-15,5,Love this place!  One of the only actual healthy places in hoboken. The food is fresh and you can customize anything. everything I have had there has been great. They also have vegan options which is hard to come by in this town.
2016-12-14,5,The staff is always super friendly and the food is always fresh. I also never have to wait too long to order my bowl which is great because I'm usually pretty hangry when I come here. I wish they still carried salmon but I guess not enough people ordered it for them to keep in on the menu.
2016-12-11,3,The manager and staff are very attentive to the customers. After my failed attempt to try their food, I was offered a free poke bowl. I made my way over and while perusing the menu, the cashier was engaging and helping me understand the build a bowl option. While they're preparing the bowl, if you're dining in, they invite you to take a seat and they'll bring the bowl out to you. That's nice. My husband had the pineapple a day poke bowl and I built my own with shrimp, rice, mixed greens, mango, pineapple, spicy shaka sauce and wonton chips. Fresh ingredients, especially the fish. The only reason my review isn't stunning is because for me it was a little bit much. The first two times I had poke, it was in Hawaii. It's inherently a simple dish, fresh fish with some seasoning/dressing. It's light and simple while packing a flavorful punch. The poke bowl takes the simplicity and originality away. Reminds me of Chipotle, except with fish (no shade to Chipotle btw). There's nothing wrong per se with the poke bowl. I think the unfortunate thing is that I had the original first and it shades in comparison.  I haven't had acai in Hawaii before. Maybe I'll try the acai bowl sometime and enjoy that. All in all: great service, fresh food. What more can you ask for?
2016-12-10,5,So happy to see an acai restaurant open in hoboken. Their acai bowls are amazing and very large portions. $14 might sound a lil steep for an acai bowl but the size of the bowl is much bigger than the ones you would get at juice generation or liquiteria for $12. And you can build your own with as many toppings as you'd like! I also tried their pokè bowls and now I'm obsessed with poke as well. I'm not a big raw fish person so their chicken option made me go for it and I'm glad i did!! Only downside for me is their location is a bit out of the way (all the way back in the west end of hoboken). I would probably order from them at least one a week if they offered delivery service!!
2016-12-08,5,Going through some of these reviews where people leave 2 stars or less, it is very clear that we live amongst whiny and spoiled brats.  Business opens half hour later so you leave a negative review?  The poke bowl is pricier than you expected so leave 2 stars?  Give me a break!   This place is a gem.  Is it perfect?  No. No place in Hoboken is perfect.  Shaka Bowl has some inexperienced staff working behind the counter but one of the founders is always around to lend a helping hand or answer a question.  Their food is fresh, delicious, plentiful, and energizing.  Is it pricey?  Sure.  I dare you to find a cheaper spot in Hoboken or Jersey City that will leave you satiated and feeling good about yourself. Shaka is 2 blocks away from my house and I go there weekly.  Their only competition in the city is Honeygrow and Total Nutrition Kitchen and both are just as pricey. I actually believe that Shaka Bowl offers better ingredients and fresher food.    Again, no business is perfect so rather than being a spoiled brat and leaving a negative review that can adversely impact a small business, speak to the manager or owner, or, in the alternative, leave a comment at the restaurant about your particular "needs."   For the normal ones, try the Tuna poke bowl. It's to die for.  Just make sure to avoid jalapenos and wasabi if you don't do spicy.
2016-12-06,5,Obsessed with this place!!!  They take acai bowls to a whole new DELICIOUS level!!   I ordered from a different place in NYC because I couldn't get to Shaka and I was soooo disappointed!  Shaka is hands down the best place- wish you much success and hope you open many more locations Keep up the amazing work Shaka!!!!!!
2016-12-03,5,Visiting family for the weekend with our 4 daughters. We used to live in Hoboken, so when my sister recommended Shaka Bowl, we were hesitant over some of our other "go-to" places. We ordered 4 poke bowls....amazing. So good, in fact, that we came back for breakfast and had the oatmeal and Acai. Although everything is great - the Acai bowl is the star. Great work!
2016-12-02,5,You must try the poke and the acai bowl !! Seriously the best portioning for acai. Owners are super friendly and food is good.
2016-11-28,4,After this past Thanksgiving weekend (aka pure gluttony and lots of sleep) I was looking for a healthy detox meal for lunch, and stumbled upon Shaka Bowl. What a great find! For $15 you can get customized poké bowls with fresh, quality ingredients. Yes, it's expensive, but then again we're used to these prices thanks to Honeygrow. They also have acai bowls and smoothies which looked amazing.My coworker and I opted for their preset menu - I had the pineapple bowl and she had the spicy bowl. We were blown away by how good they were! I really wish this place was on Washington, closer to our offices and where all the other lunch places are. It's a bit out of the way, but worth the travel if you can walk there. They did forget the avocado in my bowl for some reason, but they were happy to add them in when I told them. A bit on the pricier side, but fast friendly service and quality food for lunch!
2016-11-27,4,Really great addition to the food scene here in town. The portions were appropriate for the price and the food was very well, prepared, and presented. I got the Mauna Kea bowl and my fiance created her own. We will absolutely be back to try out the rest of the menu.
2016-11-16,5,First time eating here and it was fantastic. I've eaten similar style food in the city and was excited to see Shaka bowl open in Hoboken. The ahi tuna and all the veg was sooo fresh. I also tried the banana and almond butter little cakes and i was blown away. Guy said they were gluten free yet still good Lol. So I tried it. Understatement. They were delicious! See you guys again soon!
2016-11-06,5,My Daughter, a Stevens Student recommended I try Shaka Bowl.  Staff was friendly and bowl was excellent.
2016-11-06,4,Decided to give this new place a try. I got the pineapple a day bowl. Loaded with edamame, mango, pineapple, Tuna, scallion, crispy onion and 2 types of Shaka sauces. Very filling, but not sure if it's worth the $15. Fresh ingredients, cute spot. Good luck!
2016-11-05,5,The staff was really attentive and multiple people asked us how it was! They were all so friendly! It was delicious and very fresh and the smoothie was an awesome treat!
2016-11-05,4,Love the atmosphere, great service, even though there was a line i waited no longer than five minutes. portion sizes were great and first wave smoothie was super fretting. would would a doubt be returning here wether its to get a quick snack or for a lunch. great hangout area on a nice fall day and interesting secretion of home brew teas, next on my list to try!
2016-11-02,5,awesome food. Friendly owner. what sets this place apart is it spicy sauce and protein freshness
2016-10-30,5,I had the Pineapple A Day bowl and wow was that delicious.  It came out to be ~15 bucks with tax and while it was expensive I really can't complain if the raw fish was safe to eat and it was in a huge bowl of fixings.  I was pretty full after eating 2/3 of the bowl, which was fine because they have lids so you can take it to go, so I had a great snack later!  It was pretty crowded today but that was because the weather was unusually nice I guess?The pineapple a day bowl was good in that the spicy sauce, pineapple, fish and cilantro actually go together really well, and the rice with the sauces tastes great even though I'm not normally a rice person.  I will return for a smoothie bowl soon, they looked pretty yummy from what I saw other people eating.
2016-10-29,5,Came here when we were visiting from the city and loved our poke bowls- even better than Pokeworks (which I never thought I'd say).$14 is the average price, and Shaka gives you unlimited free toppings/mix ins which is awesome. Solid portions too.You can tell the owner truly cares about his business and customers which was nice to see. We'll definitely be back next time we're in the area.
2016-10-25,5,Delish!  Has the Mauna Kea bowl..like a deconstructed spicy tuna roll. Can't wait to try a pitaya bowl next ti
2016-10-24,5,I stopped by here yesterday.  I had pretty limited experience with poke bowls, aside from one time.  After inquiring, I picked the Pineapple A Day Poke Bowl and a smoothie.  Both were great.  It took me 2 sittings to actually finish the bowl.  They've definitely got me on board as a customer, and I intend to stop back soon.
2016-10-23,5,This place is delicious! Fresh, healthy and filling! I highly recommend the Pineapple a day and the Mauna Kea. Definitely a must try!
2016-10-23,5,I've been walking past Shaka Bowl for a while and was excited to see that it opened. My friend and I decided to finally go last night for dinner and were pleasantly surprised- it was amazing! We both got poke bowls (the Muana Kea and pineapple bowl) and they we're really delicious. The ingredients were fresh, the flavors amazing and the quantity of food was pretty large (we both took doggy bags home). Not only was the food amazing but the decor is modern and cool and the staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgable. I especially liked that everything on the menu was really healthy. I cannot wait to go back to try the smoothies and acai bowls. Also, I got one of their cold brews and as a cold brew lover I must say it was one of the absolute best cold brews I've ever had.
2016-10-22,5,My acai based Molokai cacao bowl was so so good! It was 10$ and big enough to share. It's filling, healthy and nutritious, it's also organic which I loved. Hoboken needed a place where we could get healthy fun food. Great job!
2016-10-21,5,This is honestly my new favorite place in Hoboken! I can't get enough of it. You all have to try it! It's super worth it and fulfilling, you won't regret it
2016-10-21,5,Went to Shaka Bowl last night for the first time and I was impressed! I will absolutely be making this a regular spot. I got the Pineapple a Day poke bowl and it was so fresh, delicious, and filling. I am fine with the $14 price, given it is fresh raw fish and ingredients (and you can get unlimited toppings) Similar to the reviewer below, would be a bit worried if they were serving raw fish at a lower price point. The staff was super friendly and took time to explain the ordering process to me. Food came out quick (within 2-3 minutes of ordering), which makes it a great grab-and-go place. I will be back this week to try the acai bowls, smoothies, and maybe even another poke bowl. Great place in the neighborhood!!! Good luck Shaka Bowl!
2016-10-20,5,Man alive, people can be SO harsh!  This place has been open less than a week and some expect it to be totally perfect as well as cater entirely to their personal needs. Opening a restaurant is no small feat, especially when it's in a place like Hoboken and involves raw fish. It takes time to get a feel for things and I really appreciate the owners trying to do something different and healthy away from the sea of mediocrity that is Washington street.  I don't usually review anything so new in operation, but I made an exception for this place, on principle. My friend and I went there an hour before closing a few days after they opened.  We ordered the Mauna Kea and the Kona and they were both fresh and delicious - maybe a little too much spicy shaka sauce on the Kona, but it is good sauce - I think better to go conservative with that and give the customer the option to request more.  Also wasn't crazy about the edamame in the Kona- something about the texture didn't work for me- but it might for others!  We got both with rice, one brown, one white. Hope they eventually offer an option to mix greens and rice half and half - I'll just ask next time.  Also really hope they offer salmon in the future!  A fair amount of ingredients overall for the price.  With tax it comes to nearly $15, which seems pricey for something served in a plastic bowl in Hoboken, but it is raw fish and I often find Hoboken to be more expensive than Manhattan (not sure why).  I'd be a little suspicious if a place was offering me raw fish and vegetables for cheap.  Staff was very nice and attentive and the place is clean and cute. We both left full, happy, and satisfied and plan to return in the future for more poke and other stuff!
2016-10-20,5,The staff was very welcoming and attentive to my food cravings. They made exactly what I was looking for and delivered in all aspects. Fresh quality food, genuine staff, and an A+ experience. Don't even get me started on the ambiance and decor... phenomenal!!! Would go back anytime
2016-10-20,5,This place is my new go-to in Hoboken for breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Staff is super-friendly and place is immaculate. Poke bowl is build your own which I absolutely love and have never seen anywhere else. All the food is extremely fresh as well. Since they've been open for the past week I've gone everyday and have zero complaints. Have tried everything on the menu, love it all. People complaining about pricing have to realize this is normal pricing for poke/acai bowls anywhere in the northeast. Try their cold brew coffee as well, so good!!
2016-10-19,2,Let's start by saying- I'm not sure they know what poke is? I'm guessing I'm a harder critic having lived in LA prior to Hoboken but poke is typically raw tuna marinated in soy sauce with scallion and sesame, etc. We order two 'poke bowls' and a smoothie. I ordered the Muana Kea bowl and my boyfriend did a build your own bowl. The first thing we noticed was that the fish isn't marinated in any soy based dressing, making it simply raw fish and not poke.. Our bill was $38 for the two bowls and the pitaya smoothie. A bowl will cost you $14 and the smoothies are $8. $14 is pretty steep for the size of the bowl and the amount of actual fish/product you receive. Maybe I'm just spoiled from Southern California. I wish they'd even just give you more rice to make it appear like you're getting more. Overall, $14 is pretty nuts. I agree with the other reviewer, their method for the build your own bowls is awkward. You have to wait for them to call you back up to create your bowl instead of doing it as you order. I'm assuming this is a kink they'll quickly alter. The two stars are for the cleanliness (granted it's brand new) of the business and the staff was friendly. I'll return as I think these things will quickly be worked out. Good luck, Shaka Bowl!
2016-10-19,5,Poke bowl was delicious! I got the Pineapple a Day Bowl( a house favorite): the ahi tuna was extremely fresh and the portion size was perfect. The mix of Spicy Shaka sauce and Shaka Teriyaki sauce was so so delicious! Mix-ins are unlimited which is a plus. I also got a clean complexion smoothie which tasted amazing and refreshing. The atmosphere/decor in the restaurant made me feel like I was spending a day at the beach. Staff was very friendly and greeted me as soon as I walked in the door. I will definitely be grabbing lunch here 3-4 days a week being that I felt extremely satisfied (and healthy) after eating my poke bowl and smoothie.
2016-10-19,3,This place definitely has a lot of potential! I know they just opened, but it seemed slightly chaotic... I wished it was set up differently in the way that you order. I was imagining more of like a Chipotle assembly line type of process for the "build your own bowl", but they wind up calling your name after you pay when it's your turn to build the bowl. I wound up waiting a long time because there was only one employee on the Acai Bowl side.The acai bowl I got was fine, but I think because the employee was overwhelmed, I was left with two large frozen acai chunks at the bottom of my bowl. Not too pleasant.I want to give them another try for the poke bowls and maybe when they have some logistics worked out better!
2016-10-18,5,Had the Mauna Kea bowl with brown rice and it was so delicious!!! The atmosphere is great and the food is all fresh! There is something for everyone on the menu. Shaka Bowl is definitely a great addition to Hoboken. I will definitely being going back and trying an Acai bowl! This could be hazardous to my bank account.
2016-10-17,4,I'm a big fan of poke bowls so I had to check this spot out. I ordered the Mauna Kea bowl; came with ahi tuna, avocado, jalapeños, mango, and creamy/spicy sauce over warm sticky rice (you can choose brown rice or greens as well).As far as taste goes, it was very good and ingredients were fresh, no complaints there. The portion size is also good (comparable to Qdoba or chipotle bowl). My only gripe is the price. My total was $15 for just the bowl. I would expect to pay maybe $12 for something like this. I'd probably come by again, but not that frequently due to the price and distance from Washington st.
2016-10-17,5,Just had a "Pineapple a Day" Poke bowl with a white rice base. I never leave reviews but really like supporting small business in Hoboken, especially great new food spots. The bowl was REALLY good. All the flavors worked well together, and it was plenty of food to fill me up. Will definitely be back soon.
