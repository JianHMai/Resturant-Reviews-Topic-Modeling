2021-11-07,4,This was my first time here and I can say it was a lovely brunch experience. Our waiter was amazing and very attentive and informative, the atmosphere was great and the establishment was much larger than it seems from the front. They have pitchers of sangria at a good price and they're pretty tasty. The brunch menu was limited but I think it gave an okay amount of options. My meal was okay (aguacate con pan) but the French toast my friend had was to die for ! All in all it was a good experience.
2021-11-06,1,This place is not what it used to be pre-pandemic. The food and service used to be excellent, but both have now suffered. First, they require you to order everything upfront--yes, your appetizers and entrees all at the same time.  Initially, it was explained as a covid-related issue in terms of efficiency last year. Why it's still required now is a mystery. Half of the menu is gone. All of the great appetizers that I initially loved that were on the menu pre-pandemic have never made it back on the menu post pandemic, and the remaining ones are mediocre at best. To be clear, however, the food is not bad, but it's horrible compared to what it used to be.  To top it off, the staff really makes you feel like they want you to leave the immediate instant you finish your meal and paid the check. Look, I felt this way last year when I went in the fall of 2020, the first time since the pandemic, and at the time, the pandemic was used as an excuse, and I got it. But life is much different in November of 2021. I guess they just got used to operating in a pandemic and/or it may be more cost effective for them--in any event, it looks like this new The Cuban is here to stay. And when I think about the quality of the old The Cuban, this new one is definitely deserving of this one star, if that.
2021-10-30,5,My wife and me came here for a date night and were really impressed. The food was really good. I had the Vaca Frita which came with rice, black beans, and avocado. My wife had the hanger steak which was cooked to perfection (she got it medium) and the shrimp, she switched the creamed spinach for asparagus. Plus, we got a side of maduros. Everything was cooked and flavored really good, the portions were generous. The ambiance is really cool here, you walk in and it seems really small but walk pass the kitchen and it opens up with a lot more seating. The bathrooms are located up two flights of stairs though so be aware of that. For drinks we had a coconut mojito which was delicious and strong enough! And a half of pitcher of the red sangria which wasn't our favorite as it's definitely not sweet, mostly tastes like red wine with a splash of fruit... so you decide if that's what you're hoping for. However, the real winner here was the customer service. All the waiters were super attentive, they noticed every detail, and it was some of the best customer service we've had!
2021-10-27,1,Worst attitude I've got ever...my friend may put in the wrong number of reservation, but he asked me "do you wanna find out or what?" and roll eyes??? And then asked me out to wait outside since they may got full reservation for table of 3.
2021-10-26,3,The atmosphere requires a 4 star for the spacious and different level back rooms and interesting Cuban themed art on the walls.  The food is not traditional Cuban food but comes with a gourmet flair and/or alien taste which ruins it for me.  But others may like that.  Overall a good place to visit.
2021-10-14,3,I haven't been to the Cuban in at least 8 years, so my boyfriend and I decided to have dinner there on a Tuesday night.  We were a bit skeptical about going since the yelp reviews feel a bit bipolar.    We didn't have a reservation but it wasn't crowded outdoors and there were several tables open.  When we arrived, I was very turned off by the sign on their door that states outdoor diners must order one starter and one entrée per person.  We were planning to have a regular dinner anyways, however,  I'm curious how strictly they enforce their rule.  You would think they'd want the business from people who might only want a meal & a drink, especially on a night like last night when its not crowed.  For drinks, we each tried different cocktails.  I had the Washington Ave - the grapefruit flavor was refreshing and I liked it a lot.  My bf had the Vodka Ponche - reminded me of a drink I'd have at a beach resort - very tasty but very sweet.  To start, we shared the Camaron Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) - came with 6 average sized shrimp and two pieces of toast for $15.  Was fine - nothing special, maybe a little skimpy.  For our entrees, I had the El Clásico - the pork was very tender; could have used a little more seasoning.  Came with a gigantic side of moro rice w/ beans.  Entrée was a decent size.  My boyfriend had the Ropa Vieja which came out like a stew with rice.  The meat was tender and I liked the sauce.   Instead of black beans, he substituted them for the garlic spinach which wasn't that good.  We also shared a side of sweet plantains which were addicting!  Service was generally good but probably because it wasn't that crowded. Not sure I'll be rushing back any time soon since there are other good Cuban & Latin  places in town that are BYO and more moderately priced.
2021-10-06,5,It's one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. I have been there many time since I moved to the area. I've ordered most of the items on the menu and it never disappoints. Outdoor seatings also very nice. Pic is from the most recent visit with new friends in town. I ordered the paella. It's the wet version. Taste good. Big portion. I suggest order for 2.
2021-09-16,5,Such great service at this spot! Drinks were made perfectly and servers were extremely attentive to me and my table. Their food was stunning and soooo delicious. Everything came out in a very timely manner and was super fresh. A 10/10 and I will definitely be back here. No complaints from me!
2021-09-13,5,First, visit here and we will be back. We were seated right away and our server was awesome throughout our meal. No drink was ever empty. It was a fabulous dinner! This restaurant checks all the boxes, great food, impeccable service, and a very nice atmosphere.The Tres Leches were pure bliss! The Vaca frita Plato was cooked perfectly and was exquisite. The service was excellent, not obtrusive but very attentive. Water was constantly refilled and the fact that the wait staff folds the napkin when a guest heads to the bathroom is a nice touch.
2021-08-30,5,What an incredible meal.Churrasco, Red Sangria & Churros for desert.De-lish!
2021-08-21,5,Very nice place with Amazing steak - tender and juicy. Plenty to share for two ppl. Pork buns were very good too. Nice place.
2021-08-21,3,My Family had a birthday party for me there on the 19 of this month food was great just not enough for 1700 dollars We should have had more like buffet style we left hungry shame
2021-08-20,5,The food is so amazing and so is the service. For an appetizer we got chicken empanadas and for dessert the chocolate stuffed churros. Everything was so good and they had such a great atmosphere!
2021-08-20,1,Let's start with drinks. I ordered a Havana club daiquiri ingredients listed rum, lime, demerara. what comes out is a pink concoction with maraschino cherries, with grapefruit pulp in it. I askedthe waiter, did they give me someone else's drink? He insisted that the demerara is pink sugar, and it made the drink bright pink. Instead of saying let me make it right for you, or assuming that People don't know that brown sugar is demerara, he was adamant the drink was the right one. In reality the bartender made a Hemmingway ingredients listed from the menu..Rum, Luxardo Maraschino, Pink Grapefruit, Lime or he input the wrong on in  but either way mistakes happen but  don't insult my intelligence by telling me that pink sugar made the drink taste like grapefruit and a random cherry is part of the drink. Ok now onto food, this place is not authentic at all, a Cuban restaurant without croquettas on the menu clearly is missing the mark. I ordered a Cuban sandwich, simply put it was not good at all, it was dry, and the pork was flavorless. The octopus was tender and cooked well but it was forgettable after a few bites. The beef empanadas were the only thing that came to the table which I can say were actually good.  Though the real horror show was the mussels in some tomato broth, fries, garlic aioli mess, it was painful to look at let alone to eat. I would say the only reason to come here is to have non-Cuban food and badly made cocktails. There are many better places to eat in Hoboken I would encourage you to try them and AVOID THIS PLACE.
2021-08-14,3,Atmosphere and entertainment was great but from the time they start you can no longer talk to anyone,,so loud. Food was o.k nothing impressive to the point where you say "omg this is so good "Margaritas horrible both watered down very weak and overly sweet. Waitress kind and friendly a lil forgetful! I wouldn't return anytime soon. The best part was the entertainment because let's face it dining out is relatively boring
2021-08-09,5,Always a good time at the Cuban. Very cool and trendy place. I like the vibe in all the different small rooms. Great food! Can't go wrong with anything you order.
2021-07-25,2,Went back to the Cuban first time in couple of years.  I assume the management has changed.  The drinks, food, service all were nowhere near what I experienced before.  The white wine sangria typically is full of fruits and colorful.  This was white, tasted like watered-down wine.  El Classico came with white rice instead of morro rice.  When I asked, they said they ran out of morro rice.  There was no yuca bread to the table either. It was only 8:30 PM Saturday night and they were already out of some items?This used to be one of my favorite places in Hobokon.  Not anymore.
2021-07-22,4,I have been here a few times over the years.  Solid, legit food and a nice atmosphere.  Dine outside, take in the street scene, and enjoy a great dinner.  :)
2021-07-21,1,The server Sandra was absolutely terrible. We sat down waiting for 15 minutes for someone to come up to us. I'm not sure why she waited so long to come up to us when the whole time she was on her phone and talking to the bartender. I was getting extremely aggravated. I'm very understanding when it comes to a server being busy, but she was not busy AT ALL. She did not check on us once. I could tell with her tables as well that she didn't ask how any of her customers were doing. We didn't even ask about dessert because of the terrible experience. I asked for the check and she replied with an okay. She continued to walk past our table and stopped to talk to the bartender. After 10 minutes of asking her for the check I had to get up and go to the bar, where she was standing and talking, to ask for the check again. I speak Spanish as well so I can say that what they were speaking about was not more important then all of her customers. Very very disappointing experience!!
2021-07-18,5,We stopped by to grab dinner so we can wait out the Holland tunnel traffic and it was a great find! The cocktails are really good, esp the mojitos (try the flavor mojitos too! the Passionfruit) the paella is not to be missed. Solid Ropa Vieja and maduros. We will be back to try short ribs.
2021-07-17,5,Great, authentic food. Staff is always polite and helpful. Can't live without the classic ropa vieja
2021-07-13,5,We were looking for a spot to celebrate my husband's birthday. We came across this Cuban restaurant and I'm so glad we decided to give it a try. The food was simply amazing. Our server was super sweet and friendly. Shout out to our server who moved out to Hoboken from Queens New York. I apologize I didn't get your name. You made our night and thank you for your excellent customer service. We tried various dishes but the pictures I posted were our favorites. Everything was super delicious and super tender. The Mojito's and Modelo especial we're just what we needed. I love the interior of the restaurant. However you need to make reservations for indoor dining. I would highly recommend that especially with how unpredictable the weather can be. The outside patio was just right for us and on perfect timing since it started to rain once we were about to leave. There is plenty of seating. The restrooms are on the third floor. Everything was very clean and delightful. But when it comes to parking I'm not really sure since we walked here. Come check this place out for yourself and see how delicious this food is. If I'm ever in the area I will definitely come back.
2021-07-11,5,Beautiful restaurant. Food is amazing service is excellent. I'm happy I discovered this place. Can't wait to go back.
2021-07-10,3,The food was ok-nothing out of this world. We had the churrasco and the paella. The drinks were good, but the white sangria lacked the alcohol. Appetizers (pulpo and masitas) were decent. Our waitress (will remain unnamed to not embarrass her), wasn't too personable-felt as if she didn't even want to be at the restaurant. The servers were more friendlier than her. We found it overpriced for typical Cuban dishes. Not sure if we'd  return. We're local Hudson county residents, first time at the The Cuban, but not first timers when it comes to Cuban food. We left with mixed feelings.
2021-07-10,5,I love this place. The food is always delicious and well seasoned, service always on point. I always leave feeling like it was worth every dollar and more.
2021-07-03,2,The food was okay. Went for my boyfriends birthday and cake they gave us seemed very old and dry and it was definitely overpriced. There were also 4 of us and they put  us in table too small and only let us move to something more comfortable if we ordered an appetizer
2021-07-02,1,I am very disappointed ! I have the money to pay for my service yet ALEJANDRA hung up on me twice and I don't know why? She gave me the wrong name of the  mangers and owner and cared less that was not treated with the respect I deserve by hanging upOn me many times. This is a joke and I feel like I met nothing but  many Karen's there, judging me because I'm Hispanic and I was dressed comfortably, not know my professional a social status. I am not complaing to be compensated or for free food because I don't need this type of treatment. I'm doing it because I felt discriminated against and like your staff was being raciest. You ruined my plans to take my family out to dinner for their birthday!  I just want you to put on check you ur uneducated and unprofessional employees including Alejandra . They did not want me to come in because i had a tan-top yet your other customers had tank tops inside the establishment and your employees had tan top too and yet that is ok??? You have to understand that you are looking for a discrimination lawsuit, so I suggest steven if your really the owner  or who ever is the manger to me call back and rectify this problem.  So try call me back and let me know who is this possible at 6463556856, is it be cause I'm Latino or gay??? Which one is it. Cause ur restaurant serves Cuban ( Spanish) food. Accommodate to your community that The food comes from. On everything I will call the BBB and Ochoa and lets see if your up to code. Until one of you unprofessional people get back to me and here's my number 646-355-6856 I will not let this go. My money is green like everyone else.
2021-07-02,1,This place is the worst representation of Cuban food. We ordered delivery and got the paella for $29, shredded beef for $27, churros for $10. The Paella was bland and there was little to no sea food. Also the Portions are extremely small for the price. We got 1 small cup of rice for the shredded beef and the container was mostly liquid instead of meat. Huge disappointment. The Churros were soggy and only had four small pieces. Overpriced bland food. They should really work on their portion size. Literally ripping people off. I will never order from this place again and will not recommend to anyone.
2021-07-01,1,One of the worst food experiences I've had. The steak was chewy and tough with little to no flavor. Ceviche was just avacado pieces. Mussels tasted very bland and definitely not fresh. Portion sizes were small for the price. Waiter was very unattentive and only saw him when we flagged him down for the bill. Overall we left still hungry and very dissatisfied.  Will not be back. There are so many other great restaurants on the same block to choose from, definitely avoid this one.
2021-06-24,5,First off I'd like to say , it was a rainy day ,  but we were still told we could sit outside! The had an awesome super sturdy retractable awning ! So although it was raining it still was nice warm weather ! We sat outside and not a drop fell on us ! And when the sun came back out they made sure to get all the water off and retracted the awning !  That was just so wonderful to me ! Now on to the food ! We started out with a simple appetizer of guacamole and plantain chips . Delish ! Then I get the steak and shrimp  with garlic mashed yucca !!  AMAZING!! My friend got the shredded beef stew , equally as amazing !! Drinks were margarita and Mojitos ! Absolutely DELISH!! I can't wait to return to try other dishes !
2021-06-19,1,Rip offf. Super expensive for nothing. Ordered for pick up recently and I spent 30$ for one meal and it was the same size as a kids portion.
2021-06-11,4,My second time here. Great food, friendly staff and great location. A bit pricey, but worth it for the quality of the food. Great mojitos and the Churrasco is incredible and cooked to perfection. Can't wait to return! Only downside is service can be slow on busy evenings.
2021-06-05,1,This restaurant was a huge disappointment to say the least. The ambiance and food presentation definitely looks better in Yelp pictures than it does in person. We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday and were disappointed in every sense. This is easily among the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We knew it was bad when our server didn't seem to have an in-depth knowledge of the menu or drink specials on offer. The coconut mojitos that we both ordered were overly sweet. My wife ordered the fish of the day- grouper with mango salsa. She stated it was only just edible without much in the way of flavor. Our server stated that it was served over mofongo, but I've had mofongo before and this was not it. It was just a burnt potato-like concoction. My pork shank was somehow fatty and dry at the same time. It was very difficult to finish as I kept going back to my glass of water to get down each bite. The black bean rice was inedible, although the plantains were okay I suppose. Yay, I guess?I would not recommend this restaurant. I'm not sure where all of the high ratings are coming from. Also, what is with Yelp indicating that this place is trendy and classy? I saw a guy walk in with a T-shirt and gym shorts.
2021-06-01,5,This past weekend was the first time I went to eat at The Cuban. The food was fabulous, the service was exceptional and the atmosphere was on spot! Pricing was very reasonable. This is our new favorite place to go to! I would recommend anything on the menu. We were a party of 9 and EVERYONE enjoyed their meal and EVERYONE said it was the best meal out they had in a long time! A+
2021-05-25,5,Love this place!  Go with those you love. You can't fake a good time while sipping on Caipirinha's. This concoction is Brazil's national cocktail & made w/cachaca & like tequila drinking this brings out one's true feelings. Ladies, no cat fights inside The Cuban, take it outside on Washington where you'll draw a crowd.The music puts you in the mood for love, food & a good time. Call ahead for reservations, not always needed yet smart.  Sit in the back room, lower level.We started off with the octopus appy, I'm not a fan yet the rest of the table devoured the plate in record time.All of our entree's were delish, we wanted more black beans & added plantains mid meal. Our waiter was happy to oblige & quickly I might add.  Service is good, the bartender knows how to make a drink, food is tasty ... I was feeling happy & satisfied, we'll be back!
2021-05-10,2,I came here celebrate my 30th birthday with friends and family, and the service was disappointing. There was 12 of us. Aside from having difficulties making reservation , my overall experience at The Cuban wasn't as enjoyable as I thought it would be. The food was great, but the service was not. I felt rushed and dinner felt rushed. Arnesto took our drink orders and shortly after that we were asked for our appetizers. He then proceeded to ask us for our entrees because he said that it will take too long if we wait to order. He kept asking and pressuring us to place our orders in. So we agreed to put our orders in all at once. The appetizers came and not too long after that the entrees came right out. Not only couldn't we enjoy dinner but we ate back to back not even digesting the appetizers. It was highly annoying. This is not what dining experience is supposed to be. On top of that he forgot one of the entrees  and apologized becuse he wrote it down but forgot to put in the order. Again I was already annoyed and I didn't bother calling a manager or making a scene. The fact that gratuity was included just even bothered me further because I didn't think he did a good job. On top of that people haven't gone out in a while and to experience this just shows that they care more about the money coming in than the actual experience at that point. The bill came out to $1110. Had I been accommodated to have that bottom level for my 30th the restaurant could have also gained more revenue. Lastly, it takes one bad review because you're never sure who people are connected to. Great food, disappointing service.
2021-04-24,1,Really bad service! The guy that suppose to help us with the menu and food was completely arrogant and didn't helped at all! I can't believe I came to eat lunch and celebrate my birthday here! Waste of time. Food not good!
2021-04-24,1,So I used to like this place. They still have some awesome mojitos but nothing is worst than bad customer service. I believe we encountered the manager when we walked in who was very unwelcoming.  He kept staring at us the whole time as if waiting to see what or how much we will order. My friend asked for the happy hour menu, then we over hear our waitress telling the manager in Spanish " they are here for happy hour". I don't see why that would be a problem especially if that is part of your menu at that time. Something I wanted was from the regular menu and our waitress made sure to remind me that it wasn't part of happy hour. I had to tell her that I'm aware of that and still would like to order it. We felt judged the entire time we were there. Next I ordered a guava mojito. Waitress says to me that she is surprised I ordered the guava flavor because most people don't know what guava is. Then asked me how is it that I am familiar with guava. I returned the question to her and asked her how is she familiar with that flavor. She then says she is from a tropical country and i let her know that I too am from a tropical country and very familiar with guava. . Sorry but Hispanics are not the only ones from tropical countries. I don't like ignorance. I don't care how good drinks or food is. Imagine going to a place for a good time and the entire staff is staring at you the whole time. Like I said drinks are good here but service might not be if management and the employees don't take a liking to you or prejudge you. You may be made to feel uncomfortable.
2021-04-16,2,I'm very disappointed to give this restaurant two stars because I've been a valued customer for years. Every time I'm in town from California I literally always try to plan a trip to come eat here. However, I'd have to say that my husband and I did not feel very welcome with the new I'll-mannered and discourteous hostess that is now working here. So much so, that we were out the door before we even got to our seat. I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome at a restaurant and for that reason I don't think I'll ever be coming back.
2021-04-16,1,During my first visit at this restaurant I was asked to take off my hat which i immediately did. But management allowed a worker to wear a hat during the entire time I was there with my family.. Another practice that was very shady, is that  management added a 20% gratuity to the bill without any signs posted in the restaurant or on the menu. I usually add 20-27 percent for good service. (gratuity is optional not mandatory in this country) I always support the waiters because they do not get paid more than $2.00 per hour.The waiter was well trained on how to respond to this shady practice, I had no desire to reduce the 20% gratuity because the waiter worked very hard to satisfy us.But I won't be returning to this establishment.
2021-04-11,1,Made a reservation, didn't get seated until 40 minutes after that time. So stood outside waiting, once seated we received dirty water glasses.  The waitress was really short with us and was not very attentive.  Food was good but definitely not the best Cuban food I've had. Was really disappointed.
2021-04-10,5,I love Hoboken, I just never go because parking is always a nightmare. But I was determined to have brunch and I'm glad I went!For my appetizer I had the best garlic shrimp I think I've ever had, with nice crispy crostini for dunking. Then for lunch the ceasar salad with chicken, which was healthy && delicious! I will be back for dinner.
2021-04-08,4,Nice vibe. Drinks and happy hour are great. Food is pretty good, also good food options during happy hour. Plates are nicely sized and prices are fair
2021-04-05,1,they don't know anything about hospitality, the service was rude and they try to charge twice the tip.DISGUSTING, never come back to this place
2021-03-28,1,Don't expect to get your order if you try to get Takeout. The staff is incompetent, will say they do not deal with Postmates - yet, they do! Half your order arrives, they blame the delivery guy saying this is what was presented as the order (which makes zero sense since the orders are done prior to the delivery person arriving). And the delivery person blames the restaurant. Unprofessional and incompetent.
2021-03-27,2,Oh man I'm so sad about this place. It has officially gone downhill and I won't be going any more. The food took forever to come out (over 90 min long) and my favorite churrasco was tough as anything. For a $32 plate, I would expect better.. but it's been getting worse and worse. All of our jaws hurt from chewing the rubbery steak. Ugh. Wings were pretty good... the sauces come on the side. The yuca fries and potatoes were good but everything else.... no bueno. Waiter didn't give a sh*t... it was obvious. So sorry Cuban. You were great and I hate to do this during a rough time... but I can't come back. Wishing you nothing but the best.
2021-03-24,4,My sisters and I dined here in March 2021. The ambiance is great! Lovely decor. The tables are separated from each other so there are social distancing practices in place here. I ordered the ropa vieja, my sisters had the vaca frita. The vaca frita was way more flavorful. The beans, however, were so bland! I was super bummed about that. Bland beans aside, the portions were big and the service was great.
2021-03-20,5,Amazing restaurant! I came here for my birthday in the beginning of March with my family. Staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious. From the sangria, to appetizers, to meal, to dessert, I can't wait to visit again. The empanadas were amazing for appetizers; we got beef, chicken, and spinach and cheese. The spinach and cheese were surprisingly my favorite. For the meal I got a combo that came with potatoes, spinach, steak, and shrimp. I really enjoyed everything. Thanks for a great dinner!
2021-03-20,5,I love the Cuban! This is my fifth time here and I highly suggest to give this place a try.  Make sure you call to make a reservation, due to the pandemic and its limited capacity, they get pretty booked.  I made the mistake of not making a reservation but I'm glad I only had to wait 30min, it could've longer.   Let's go back to the food... DELICIOUS! We had ceviche with watermelon and some delicious salmon as well... I had tres leches cake for dessert which is MUST ya'll! Try to get the yuca fries if they're available, you'll remember me. The staff was amazing, they were patient, kind, and super funny.  They made this experience a great one!
2021-03-13,4,I've actually have been here in the past but never got around to a review or forgot to check in and review. Great atmosphere for lunch and dinner. Great drinks (full bar). Outdoor seating if desired (be prepared for everyone walking by to stare at your plate; this is the entire Hoboken and most outdoor seating in Hoboken). You can never go wrong with grilled octopus for appetizer. Churassco for the main (comes w/ yuca fries and salad). In the pass, I've had the ropa vieja (shredded steak, slow cooked) another great dish. Those are the only 2 dishes i can speak for. If you haven't noticed, this place is Spanish cuisine. Go for it! Especially when you get tired of American bar food in Hoboken
2021-01-30,5,Everything at The Cuban is so authentic and flavorful, I would recommend this restaurant for any occasion! During COVID, they did limit seating to 1 hour and 15 minutes, which is pretty short timing for a restaurant, but I do understand they need to get other parties in. I am vegetarian, so I ordered beans and rice off of the sides menu. The portion was actually substantial and it was delicious. Other favorites were the Classico (pork) and vaca frita. The mojito's and spicy margaritas are also delicious. Since COVID they are not doing pitchers, everything is by the glass.
2021-01-18,3,Unfortunately the experience did not live upto expectations. The drinks were ok, nothing spectacular or unique and the mojitos we felt weren't very good. The food was also ok, the empanadas (beef) were our favorite part of the meal, the grilled chicken was pretty good but the white rice was sticky and had a distinct flavor; the ropa vieja was not good, it was like tossed in tomato paste, not like any we've had before. Our waiter was rushing often with us, which didn't make us feel comfortable or welcomed to order with grace. I am giving 3 stars because of the pandemic and circumstances for all are hard but I would even give 2 with our experience.
2021-01-18,2,I have been at the Cuban before and had an amazing dinner and conversation with my date. On this occasion we were put at a table in the back lower level which was not a problem. It became quite apparent after sitting at the table for less than five minutes that all the tables in that area was a part of a large party with members if their group standing around, kids jumping off the seats and tables, running about like they are in a play pen. The parents were taking pictures in close proximity with no masks and moving about as if we were not there. To make the experience worse, we got our drinks and the coconut mojito was thick and sour with foamy residue on top. The sangria seemed watered down and tasteless. We waited a good 15 minutes before the server returned to get us another drink and did so only after I ask for a manager. The margaritas we ordered after were good, but once the food arrived that brief moment of joy was dashed. The paella which I always raved about as the best was salty, the seafood tasted stale and the flavors did not blend well with the dish which led me to believe they were going bad. The dish my date got was a mix of chaos, the meet had no salt but the rice was ok. This restaurant doesn't appear to be consistent in its food and clearly did not care about the quality of our dining experience. What should have been an amazing night turned into one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years.
2021-01-08,5,The coconut Mojito was similar to a piña colada very delicious. The red sangria was a perfect blend of fruitiness while also tasting the wine it was superb. Beef empanada was also very fresh and delicious and I especially enjoyed the sauce it came with. The paella was so filling I wasn't able to fill finish it and the muscles and oysters were especially delicious. My boyfriend got the vaca frita which was superb. The Cuban is a must go. Great Covid precautions and the Decour and music really was a great date night spot
2020-12-29,1,The food doesn't taste good. I don't think they ever tasted the food before putting it on the menu. The tostones has some weird sauce on it that taste like bell peppers. The salmon had a weird aftertaste and the beans were not good. I make better black beans, maybe I can send them my recipe. I doubt they have Caribbeans in the kitchen. My date also left her ropa vieja. I was excited to go there and the place is beautiful, but the food is pure trash.
2020-12-14,5,Thank you Yelp for this suggestion. This was honestly so great. We were able to call and request a table for 4 people 30 mins in advance. Once we arrived, we were seated right away. Initially when we arrived, all tables were social distanced. 3 levels in the back of tables. One additional section in the front. Decor is very pretty. Temperature not checked. Passion fruit mojito is a MUST. The paella Valencia was amazing. I could do without the garlic aioli. Ask for the spicy green sauce on the side to add. Towards leaving, the bottom level (lounge area) started to get to crowded fir my liking.
2020-12-05,5,My FAVORITE restaurant in Hoboken and there is a lot to choose from in this town. Every time I go the service and food is more than spectacular. I love the ambiance as well; this could be a great place for a date night or a nice vibe to hang out with friends. Drinks are solid.
2020-11-20,5,Amazing food. The paella is to die for. And I am Cuban.  I totally recommend this place even during COVID.
2020-11-18,4,Late post review for Mother's Day - but went out of my way for the Cuban Eggs Benedict with my family since eggs Benny are one of my fave brunch dishes. Came early on a Sunday pre COVID so times were much more simple and traffic coming into Hoboken was much more congested. Ordered my Cuban Benny with mimosas and it was worth going out of my way for. Everything we tried was very good. The decor in the restaurant was intimate and I loved the wall murals. Service was just ok. Overall, decent experience. Would definitely try dinner here sometime.
2020-11-16,4,The staff here are very friendly and accommodating. I changed my decision of sitting outside to inside and there was no issue. The place was very nice and there weren't many people, maybe because it was a week day. We were catered to quickly and we got guacamole for our appetizer. It was really good. I've never had it with plantain chips and it was a great touch. For my entree I got the churrasco cubano, which is the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. It came in a normal time. I asked for medium cook but it tasted like well done at first. I told the waiter about it and he nicely said that sometimes the ends are more cooked and to taste the middle. It was medium in the middle. After this it tasted really good. The fries were good too. It wasn't the best I've had but did the job. The tres leches on the other hand was really tasty. I usually don't eat tres leches but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did!
2020-11-10,5,This place is an absolute must! From the food to the drinks to the service! Everything was amazing! You can't go wrong with this place! And a special shout out to Romulo (probably spelled it incorrect) our waitress for the attentive service!
2020-11-08,5,First time at the Cuban and it did not disappoint. The Mojito's hit the spot. The Cuban Guac was amazing and loved the plantain chips. The waiter was kind and helpful. The Mar y Tierra was delish. Environment was pleasant and the seating was spaced out. Will be a repeat customer.
2020-10-22,4,The Cuban was great! My boyfriend easily got a table outside on a weekend afternoon. We shared the chicken empanadas to start, and the ropa vieja as our entree. (Wasn't the best ropa vieja I've ever had, but it was solid.) Tres leches cake for dessert was the highlight!
2020-10-17,5,Amazing food! Amazing service! Make sure you order the passion fruit mojito and vaca frita!
2020-09-27,5,Love it!! They have been the best of the best for years!!! Their dishes are phenomenal. The consistency is there. Will forever be a favorite
2020-09-19,3,Food was pretty good. A little pricey but i would return for the food alone-- I had the Cuban sandwich and guacamole. The Cuban wasn't too dry as many I've had in the past. We ate outside in their outdoor dining- while the tables look technically 6ft apart the seating put you easily within 6 ft of others not wearing masks. Our waitress had a nose out method of wearing face mask which was uncomfortable and not appropriate for the time (though all other staff were masked).
2020-09-14,5,I've been to the Cuban about 5 times at least and it never disappoints. We've ordered many things, including the Pollo Criollo, Pulpo, Seafood Paella, and Cuban Sandwich. Everything we've ever ordered has been amazing. The cocktails are great too. We've ordered takeout during the pandemic and it tastes just as good as when we used to dine in. Absolutely love this restaurant.
2020-09-12,3,Love this restaurant and the outdoor seating vibe. Great food, great service. So why the 3 stars? Soooooo disappointed they are using endless numbers of plastic cups that were being thrown in a regular trash bag after, so no recycling happening here. Why not just use glasses as usual? The bar next door was serving drinks in glasses. Come on!
2020-09-11,4,Such a great place! If you go, you have to get a mojito! They have so many flavors and they are so good. I was highly impressed after dining here, we will be back!
2020-09-08,5,Only like the best place ever! Food is so delicious! They're mojitos are great too ;)
2020-09-07,5,Great Place! I really enjoyed the food/mood. A little bit on the pricey side, but it's very good. Good music too
2020-09-05,1,I know its covid situation and everyone is facing hard times. But that doesn't mean one should compromise its service and food quality. Food was totally tasteless and it smelled like frozen whatever we ordered. Also They were not taking any order of us unless we are ready with our entire order. I mean this is no way you should treat to your customers. Not going there again for sure.
2020-08-30,1,Imagine going to a restaurant and being told by an horrible server, no you must order a minimum apps and dinner. Imagine being told no this is how we do our drinks and that's how it is. Imagine being told no the CHEF needs the full order NOW‍Covid or no covid this is horrible and I feel horrible just typing this but it's the truth. RIP GOOD SERVICE RIPThis review is based on Sunday service team
2020-08-30,3,We were seated without having to wait, and the staff was very friendly. Customers are supposed to order at least one appetizer per table, and one entree per person. . We both agreed the virgin Pina Coladas weren't great...they were too "thick". I don't usually return food, but the Pollo al a Parrilla had such a fishy taste. I've never had this problem, so I don't feel it was the seasoning. The waiter said something may have gotten in the marinade, and offered the chicken empanadas instead. They were much better, and the rice, beans and maduros were great. The portion sizes were large as well. Overall, a good but not great experience.
2020-08-27,4,The Cuban has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken, ever since its opening close to 10 years ago.  The food has always been delicious, and their creative beverages have always been potent...maybe even too much so at times...All of these terrific experiences have led to this very delayed 4-star review.  However, I also should mention that my recent visit did not live up to my previous successes.  The dinner started out nice enough with the outdoor dining host being extremely gracious and our ability to grab a last minute table without a reservation.  But, then, everything went downhill.  I decided to skip the cocktails this time, but my boyfriend's Mojito was very sweet and had way too much rum.  Mojitos are all about balance, and this one was all out of wack.  In terms of the food, their typical cheese rolls never arrived at the table, though that might be a post-pandemic elimination.  The Chicken Empanadas were served over a charred tomatillo salsa and a black bean purée.  The outer pastry was heavily fried and too crispy, though the chicken ropa vieja on the inside was tender and flavorful.  For the main course, I tend to alternate between the Pollo a la Parrilla (grilled chicken) and the Salmon, depending on my mood or the seasonal preparation of each.  On that occasion, I went with the Salmon, but was very disappointed.  The fish was dry and not very fresh, a stark change from previous times.  In addition, the salmon was supposed to have been pan-seared in a tomatillo glaze, though I barely tasted it.  The large filet was served over a Spanish white sweet potato and ginger purée, as well as sautéed baby kale.  These accoutrements were both delicious.  The plate also included a green apple salad with onions, which was extremely acidic and sour.  Despite my sad meal, my boyfriend loved his Ropa Vieja as much as he usually did, though he did find the accompanying white rice and black beans rather bland.I decided to give The Cuban a 4-star rating because I have always had an amazing meal there and am going to chalk this recent, poor rendition up to the challenges of serving food during COVID or just merely an "off-night", but I will keep you posted on any future encounters to confirm!
2020-08-09,4,Keeping in mind that everyone is trying to  adapt to the new rules and serve their guests, the Cuban is doing a good job. Not perfect,  but no one is. They set up plenty of tables and chairs outside, with umbrellas and canopies to make guests comfortable.  A few of the tables were a little too close to one another, and for some reason,  they didn't utilize the whole sidewalk as other places did. It was hot out this (Sunday) afternoon,  but we were comfortable.  Our water glasses were never empty and the service was good.  They are offering a limited menu at this time. I didn't see much that I like, many items contained seafood,  which I don't eat.  We shared an order of empanadas - which were delicious, and a salad. I ordered the Cuban, with one side ($9) - it was very good. I ate half andI took half home. My son got the "half roasted boneless chicken and rice ($22)" which looked good, but it was not boneless. The waiter explained that it was "except for the leg bone." Which we thought was sort of funny. Nevertheless,  my son enjoyed his meal. Total with tax and tip was $67, without dessert or beverages.
2020-07-28,5,Great place, the food was awesome all four of us enjoyed the outdoor dinning. Service was excellent, very friendly and attentive. Will go back for sure.
2020-07-15,4,Came here for brunch and had a great meal! Right now since only outdoor dining is allowed, we said outside and I was definitely thankful for the shade over their patio area! Plenty of drink options for brunch, but I went with a mimosa and it hit the spot. For my meal, I had a Cuban sandwich with yuca fries--lots of flavor and a big portion! Some of the menu was a little pricey, but I would go back to try some more of their meals. Especially for brunch again!
2020-07-12,2,Outdoor seating with shade, a huge plus. The food looks AMAZING but I was very disappointed.  Its Cuban food I was expecting flavor overload...NO...the steak was bland, no seasoning. My sister had steak and shrimp but her steak was over cooked and lacked flavor. My mom had the pork shank and rice she loved it. She does not eat salt due to health reasons and felt that her shank was tender and she enjoyed it. She ate every bit. My sister and I left our food and brought pizza up the street.
2020-04-08,5,I LOVE their happy hour specials!  It's probably the best, most reasonable happy hour in Hoboken.  Small bites on sale and fantastic cocktails made with decent (not well!) liquor.  The staff is really cool, as well.
2020-04-06,5,This place is like a nice little spot for everyone. You can be a college group and enjoy or you can be a couple and still enjoy the ambience here. The food is decent and the waiters were courteous. They unfortunately don't delivery as far as my apartment in Jersey, but will definitely visit again.
2020-03-13,3,The food was okay. I've had better for a better price. The experience was another story. They seated us near the front where the tables were so tight, we could be in every tables convo next to us (some actually were). It was so uncomfortable. Then on top of that, it felt like they were rushing us out! My husband and I came to celebrate our anniversary, thinking we could take our time and enjoy more drinks and dinner. However, that was not the case. We ended up leaving after an hour of getting there and continuing our celebration elsewhere.
2020-02-29,4,Happy Hour prices are amazing! The Cuban sandwich is delicious and the service at the bar is wonderful! The bartender named Jay is so attentive and can hold a great conversation! Give the man a raise!  I will definitely be going back and will encourage my friends to go too!
2020-02-16,4,This place is really nice!! Its well lit in the front, but more relaxed (darker) towards the rear of the restaurant.  The service wasn't 100% fast, but they were very busy when we arrived. Super yummy food!! Flavors were very good, and rich. Portions are ok, not large but that's fine. I prefer taste over size! Definitely a great date night, or hanging with the girls!
2020-02-01,5,First  time  here  came  here with  friends we all enjoyed the food and service  and the  restaurant also the manager  was  very accommodating  since we were alitte late for our reservation. The food  was amazing and all the staff  was attentive we will be back!!
2020-01-27,5,I would say it is some of the best Cuban food around! I have been here several times and have always had a good experience. If you can make it to happy hour you will not regret it, the drinks specials and drinks themselves are great!
2020-01-26,4,While visiting NYC we were in the mood for some authentic Cuban food and this place did not disappoint! We were a larger group so they put us upstairs in the Loft. It's nice, cozy and when the wine kicked in, a little hot to say the least! Our service was pretty good and the food was excellent!
2020-01-14,5,I last came to this place 7 years ago. I'm still trying to figure out how it has stayed amazing and how the prices have barely changed. Drinks are delicious and the food is still phenomenal. I'm still a fan.
2020-01-08,4,This is the third time that I have been at The Cuban for a meal, and food-wise, definitely not disappointed (Saturday Jan 4, 2020).  Shared appetizers consisted of guacamole w/ lump crab (as to which they added additional plantains, thank you!), pulpeta (always a great thing), pulpo (great amount of tenderness and excellent sauce).  For my main I had the Paella which was a nice size and also cooked really well.  I wish there were some more scallops in there, but I cannot complain.Ambiance is extremely active and lively, crowd is young-middle aged.   The bar area is definitely packed up and a little tight but the tables in the back give you some breathing room.The staff (kudos to Andres, our waitor--he was great!) is good but we hit a snag this time around.  I called for a reservation for 11 people a week before as to which it was confirmed.  The day of the reservation I was called by the manager to say that they overbooked and we would be pushed out to no later than 8:30.   They automatically adjusted my reservation to 8:15 w/ the promise that we would be seated by 8:30.  Minor inconvenience.  For the most part, everyone filed in by 8:15 and were seated at 8:30 on the dot.  We had a cake as to which the manager was not budging on comping the $3/person cut charge ($33 for a $50 cake that was brought for 11 people).  So knowing the bill was going to be pretty heavy, and initially pushing out my reservation, you would think there would be some wiggle room for something like a cake cutting.  So after telling the manager to forget it in the beginning of our seating and give us the cake back, our waiter let us know right before dessert that they were able to comply.  Totally worth the raised blood pressure for the rest of the evening =/Long story short, still love the food!!  Be careful w/ larger parties/reservations on busy nights and be prepared for a way too expensive cake cutting.
2020-01-02,5,Food is exceptional and they have one of the best bars in Hoboken! The red sangria is delicious and the vibe is perfect for date night. Great bang for you buck!
2019-12-25,5,Went there on Christmas Eve, One of the best food and service I have seen in a long time. Definitely a 5 start
2019-12-21,4,This place, mmm mmm mmm... I'm a big Cuban Food lover, and this place did not disappoint. Came with my mom for a night in Hoboken, it was cold out and this place did its job to warm us up. My mom and I Ordered - The Colada as my drink, Beet Salad, Ropa Vieja, side of Maduros, and for dessert, Tres Leches and Flan. Loved loved the dessert!!! The flancito and tres leches were perfect. Colada was delicious, gave me a nice kick for my Saturday evening. Gave us complimentary warm bread and butter in a cigar box, which I thought was such a great idea. Good food. Service was great- waiters and staff were very friendly and attentive. Great gem on Washington St.
2019-12-19,5,Hands down best restaurant in Hoboken! I make sure to bring everyone who visits the area to this place. Not once has The Cuban ever dissapointed. Absolutely delicious food and amazing drinks. The atmosphere is lively and celebratory. Its only downfall may be that everyone who goes becomes so happy while there that the laughter and conversations can get a bit loud. This definitely isn't for those who want a quiet calm night out.
2019-12-09,4,Guacamole appetizer was great! Vaca Frita was good as well and was a big size portion.
2019-12-04,5,Funny we were walking in the main drag in Hoboken and saw this placed packed and now I know why. Incredible menu lots to choose from. Got the signature chicken dish and was incredible. Well run restaurant... attentive staff. Would definitely go back.
2019-11-22,5,Love love love it here! Cute place (but small) with great ambiance and delicious food. The happy hour menu is also long and includes both food and drinks! Would def recommend the stuffed plantain. Although there is only happy hour at the bar, my coworker had her baby and stroller with her and they not only let us enjoy happy hour specials at a table, but even helped carry the stroller up and down the stairs. Amazing service and accommodation that you don't get anywhere. We all (3 of us) got the churasco and we all got it cooked different ways( medium, medium well, and medium rare) and all of them were cooked perfectly. Will definitely be coming back!
2019-11-13,5,Churrasco with rice and beans and fried egg - excellent Cuban breakfast The coffee was on point .This place in Hoboken is better than any other place in Hoboken for Cuban brunch or dinner . Great date spot and for large families Food is fresh and drinks are good .  Cuban Benedict : has a lot of flavor but my preference I wouldn't drench the plate with sauce. I would lightly dash of sauce but place the meat under or on the side It's better for the eye .However it was good .  Service is excellent, very attentive
2019-10-31,1,Way too over price for the quality of food. I have gotten a better taste for half the price.  It was just okay.
2019-10-28,5,My husband and I stopped here for dinner before a concert. We had a reservation and were seated right away but a friendly host. At first the place seems tiny but we were seated on a 2nd floor area which quickly filled up. Our waiter came over to us right away with fresh bread and took our drink order. We had mojitos and sangria, which hit the spot. They were playing salsa music and the environment was relaxing and chill. We ordered a sampler with a little bit of everything and were pleased with the items.  The hubby and I both had the churrasco steak with rice and yuca fries. Delicious!! Everything was cooked well. We didn't stay for dessert as we were pressed for time but had no doubt that it would have been amazing! Would definitely recommend and visit again.
2019-10-25,2,Okay. I ordered the mussels were so over-cooked that they had shriveled up 2 a size smaller than a dime. Totally  overpriced for rice and beans and meat and platanos! $50 per person 1 drink half an app!Very loud! The waiters were so harassed they had to yell the specials and appetizers due to the excessive noise. No bueno!
2019-10-21,5,Great menu selection, great service and nice cocktails! Terrific dinner this past weekend and will sure to come back!
2019-10-17,5,We did small plates and had the churrasco as the main course. Everything was delicious. Go all the way and get the full pitcher of sangria. The service was great - thanks
2019-10-03,2,DO NOT PLAN YOUR PARTY AT THE CUBAN...Hosted a dinner party with 22 people off of their pre-fixe "Family Style" menu at $40/pp + tax & tip.  We had 2 tables with 11 people on each and were given a 2 VERY SMALL bowls of rice for each table; when we asked for more, we were told that the restaurant was running low on rice.  REALLY!!!? The meat portions were even worse and the dessert was pretty much non-existent.  WHAT A RIP OFF!
2019-09-28,1,If you find yourself in Hoboken, do not give these guys your business. Worst restaurant experience of my entire life- nationally and globally speaking. We were visiting friends in NJ and this apparently used to be one of their favorite spots (prior to this experience). After seating our four person party, we each went on to order our alcoholic beverages of choice, along with five appetizers to share (at $16 to $17 dollars each). Soon after, the manager walked up and demanded that we had to additionally order four entrees minimum immediately or leave. Shocked, we responded that we'd like to start with all the appetizers and order more food later as needed. The manager with zero customer service skills, said that this was not an option. Meanwhile our drinks arrived. So, he went on to demand that we order the four entrees now, or pay for the drinks and leave right away. We had a reservation but they never told us this was the rule in advance, when we made the reservation or even when they seated us, but when we pointed this out, he claimed that it's written somewhere inside their restaurant. Note that one, they sat us outside upon arrival at the only available table, and two, we never entered the actual dimly lit restaurant so we're still not sure where we were supposed to read this rule. When we tried to point this out, in a calm and helpful manner, the manager rudely just walked away and refused to give us another minute to discuss it. However, they still demanded that we pay for the untouched drinks that had arrived at this point, which we did just to avoid making a scene, but they wouldn't even let us drink it in peace. The waiter towered over our seats with the bill in hand, demanding we sign the check and leave quickly, reiterating that they needed the table for higher paying customers. UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!
2019-09-25,5,I went there with 4 of my friends for my birthday celebration. Let's just say that this place is delightful. We walked in right after the opened. I love the decoration and the atmosphere there the staffs were extremely nice. The place was really clean. For appetizer we ordered Benrenjena. Those were crispy fried eggplants. I usually don't eat eggplants... But one bite had me singing opera. It was sooo delicious. We had to other another one. For the main course I ordered pollo criolo, 2 of my friends ordered ropa vieja abd and the other one ordered Rabo encencido. Well i tasted everyone food the food was soooo delicious. It is pricey but the food is worth it. I'd definitely recomlend this place for birthday dinner etc...
2019-09-15,5,Service was great. We sat at the bar and was quickly attended to.I had the Maduro appetizer dish... it was so delicious and felt home cooked. Would def recommend to a friend
2019-09-15,4,Great food, great ambience, great wine selection and decent service. It's a small place that has big taste. If you are cruising around Hoboken and you were in the mood for some amazing Cuban food, go here.
2019-09-13,3,I went to The Cuban with my family to meet my husband's sibling and his family. The drinks were decent but the food was ok and overpriced and the music was just too loud. Nobody could hear anyone and our request to decrease the volume was not processed. It may be an ok place for locals but was definitely not worth the ride from Manhattan.
2019-09-10,4,Came in on the Friday before labor day for happy hour (bar only - I believe it's 4-7 on M-F). For a long weekend, the place was surprisingly packed, at least for happy hour. We were able to grab one seat, and another one about 15 minutes later.Cocktails (which are pretty strong and I appreciate that, especially during HH), sangria, and house wine are $5, and beers are $4. There are also some HH apps at various prices. We ordered a bunch of apps and were pretty stuffed because the portions are pretty much regular-sized. Here's everything we had:Cuban ($7) - this is one of the better Cuban sammies I've had in Hoboken. I thought it would be small, but it was actually a regular-sized sammie.Frita Cubana (mini beef and chorizo burgers - $8) - this was a tad dry and salty, so I wouldn't recommend these. They are filling though, since it comes three per order.Garlic Shrimp ($8) - the flavor was good but then again, I just love garlicCheese/meat plate ($16) - the description on the menu just says daily selection of Artisan Spanish cheese and cured meats with guava marmalade. For the price, I don't think it was worth it at all. Not for the quality, at least. The cheeses tasted like they were from Shop Rite.I would come back for happy hour to try some of their other dishes (just not the meat and cheese plate again). There's about 15 other things to choose from, so their happy menu for both drinks and food is pretty extensive. Too bad it's at the bar only. I feel like they should make it the bar area, since there is some additional seating there. They would probably get a bigger crowd.Tip - see my attached photos for the happy hour menu because nobody posted any pictures of it so I decided to take one for the team and take some photos.
2019-09-06,4,The Cuban is a great date night restaurant. The decor is modern and has nice bar to grab a drink before dinner. All the speciality drinks are delicious and they have plenty of other drink choices too. Love the garlic shrimp and skirt steak is delicious. Many choices on the menu from steak to seafood and always have plenty of specials per night.  I have dined here with a larger group and the restaurant was very accommodating.
2019-09-06,5,Follow @jerseym1ke on Instagram if you know who took care of Bryce in 13 reasons why I walked into this Restaurant on a whim, being that I had to kill some time for something, and was pleasantly surprised to see how amazing and professional everyone was! I sat at the bar. Christian Castro was my bartender. He served me a coconut mojito. It was out of this world! After alittle good conversation, I had received my guacamole with crab. That was also amazing. I'm not big on shellfish but this was fantastic. Christian stole the show. He was a great bartender and server and I will be returning
2019-09-01,5,INCREDIBLE! Why have I never been here? Pulpo was very good but the Camarone a la Ajillo was fantastic!!! Churrasco, Boliche, Rabo Encendido, Yaca Frita all really really really good!!!Definitely coming back here again and hopefully Sandra is our server!!! Gran lugar!
2019-08-23,5,Sandra was amazing!!! Very personable, friendly... You need more people like her, she gives a very warm welcome !!
2019-08-20,4,The only reason this place gets a 4-star is for the noise level on night of 08/14. (Just getting around to writing the review now.)  I was at a business dinner and the food and service were excellent.  We tried the crab guacamole app with plantain chips - yum.  Our waitress was honest and authentic and I took her recommendation for Grouper.  Perfectly pan fried - light and not fishy!  Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food as well.  I will return.
2019-08-16,2,Overall the food is decent (nothing special), but the waiters are total assholes and it's massively overpriced. Waiter was just so inexperienced and robotic. He then said we had to order drinks apps and entrees all at the same time, no exceptions. Then he came back saying can I get you guys anything else? Just so clear that they r trying to rush ppl. Very unpleasant to get toyed with like that. Dropping knives everywhere and just made the evening uncomfortable. Food was not bad but really overpriced and nothing special. Skip this place! Many better options in Hoboken.
2019-08-16,5,The food was very good, portions were large and totally shareable. Seasonal sangria was very yummy!
2019-08-01,5,One of the best places to eat in Hoboken. I know, i have been to most of them! First, I love love the happy hour specials. Drinks are delicious and finger foods are a great deal! Beware, drinks are delicious BUT strong! My max is 2 drinks... Friendly bartenders - once I came here 5 minutes before happy hour ended and they allowed me to order! I've also came here for brunch and also enjoyed the food. The steak and eggs plate!!! This place is a must try for hoboken!
2019-07-29,1,My reservation could not be found. I was asked to wait at the bar while they search for an available table. The bartender took over 5 minutes to make my drink and charged me for an additional cocktail that was ordered by a guy sitting 2 seats away from me. My friend was asked to remove his baseball cap because they do not allow headwear; however, nowhere on their website is this noted. The food was good, not great. I do not plan on going back.
2019-07-28,5,My friends and I went here on a Saturday night and we were accommodated with seating quickly although we did not have a reservation. The entire staff was super friendly and helpful. I had a mango mojito and it was truly the best mojito I've ever had. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. Food is on the expensive side but it is beyond worth it. All of our dishes were delicious and the presentation was beautiful. Highly recommend this place and I will be coming back.
2019-07-28,1,No baseball caps allowed in the bar, but changing a diaper at the table is apparently ok. We walked in to be seated for lunch at around 2:30 on Saturday. After we sit, my boyfriend is told there are no hats allowed in the "dining room."  Let's face it, this is a bar. We are sitting at high top tables in a communal booth and the actual bar is about 4 feet away. This is not dinnertime with white tablecloths. Nevertheless, we oblige, look at the menu, and order. As we wait endlessly for our food,  a couple shows up and sits down at the table one over from from us in the communal booth for what is now happy hour because it is after 3pm - note we still have not received our meal. The couple proceeds to change their baby's diaper at the table. I understand, there isn't a changing table in the restroom. That's on the restaurant. However, this is unsanitary. People are eating or at least waiting to eat. Of course, management conveniently doesn't see this happening in plain sight. They do see that I'm annoyed and come over to me. I point out the obvious at which point they stumble and say oh we didn't realize. They then proceed to go over and tell the couple they've received complaints. So now the couple starts arguing with me. My boyfriend and I leave without having eaten (because our food had still not arrived after close to 40 minutes waiting) and the mother of the baby continues to argue with me as I walk out. The couple, who had not ordered yet, should have left and found a place to change their baby or asked the restaurant to accommodate them. Not change the baby where people are eating. The restaurant was wrong by not taking ownership of the issue. The restaurant should have said it was not allowed in their space and that it was unsanitary rather than put it on "complaints of customers." That's absurd. The restaurant should want a sanitary eating environment. Or, maybe they only care whether you wear a baseball cap in the "dining room." Terrible customer service.
2019-07-26,1,If I could give less than 1 star I would, be warned each person in your party needs to order either two apps or one entree (even if you want an app to be your entree).  And after I just said this was one of my favorite places.  Really disappointing.
2019-07-25,3,Food was okay. Service was very slow. We didn't have our order taken until 15 minutes after being seated. We got our drinks after our food came out which made us not want to drink them anymore. This wasn't my first time here; it's usually average service. Our waitress did tell us that there was a new bartender which was why things were going so slowly. Basically if you want Cuban food and great service, go to Coco Havana.
2019-07-22,5,Great service, beautiful scenery, excellent selection of food that was provided on the menu. Two thumbs up!!!
2019-07-21,5,We are spoiled for choice in Hoboken, but The Cuban really delivers when it comes to a great experience and even better food! We love bringing out of town guests here because many don't get to experience Cuban food and we know that the service will be on point every time (I drink a lot of water and this is one of the few places where I never get to the bottom of the glass-that's high praise). Wish they would bring back the bacon-wrapped maduros with cheese and honey. And if you're there on a night when the pork belly buns are a special appetizer, go for it. Your tastebuds will thank you.
2019-07-21,3,Well, where do I begin? I wanted more flavour from this restaurant. What I tasted was watered down food made for weak, fearful, immature palettes. I looked around at the patrons and then I understood why I had lackluster food.Now, let me state for the record....the food was NOT horrible! It was presented well, well done in execution, generous portions and clean taste however lacked deep well seasoned, marinated, flavour that I had a taste for.The Caribbean has an amazing history and a vast array of cultural cuisines all full of flavour and colors. I am a Caribbean woman who has experienced those flavours. Sofrito! Sazon' sabor....I make better Cuban food at home and I'm not even Cuban!!This restaurant seems to be popular even on a Saturday afternoon, which is when I came in. I came in for a takeaway lunch. The waiter Frank was quite accommodating and polite and I tipped him according to the way he served me, he served me well and I tipped him well.I ordered Papas Relleno's an order of Ropa Vejia and Tres Leche as my dessert. I love Papas Relleno's potato meat filled cake. There were 3 large sized fried potato cakes and the filling was generous! It came with 2 side sauces. One was a brown smokey meat and the other was a yellow  slightly spiced sauce. I personally would've added a third more like a spicy verde cilantro sauce for color!The Papas were good but not great yet presented well and generously portioned. The Ropa Veija came with white rice and black beans. The black beans had visible bay leaf in it but still lacked rich bold flavour. Flavour enough to stand alone with the blandness of white rice. The Ropa Veija has tender shredded beef (yes the meat was tender and that's good to be tender), olives, onion, a tomato sauce base and red peppers in it all things I love yet I still missed the deep richness that happens with slow cooking. The Tres Leche was just okay....mediocre.Would I go to this restaurant again? I wouldn't entirely rule it out. Maybe, to possibly try another dish.And YES, I KNOW, I TAKE GREAT PICTURES! But great pics don't suffice for great rich flavour!
2019-07-20,5,Came here for brunch on a Sunday with my girlfriend and her parents. Seeing as they're Cuban, I was looking forward to getting their take on the placeThe space was a lot larger than I thought it would be with most of the tables being in the back. I loved the decor which gives the restaurant an upscale yet authentic feel. We started with croquetas de jamon, camarones a la ajillo and a tamal. The croquetas were moist and had a nice crunch. The shrimp was all the garlic and butter goodness we could hope for.  The pork tamal was solid and the pork belly inside was crunchy and fatty. Charlotte would eat this pig even if it was Wilbur.  For my main I went with the classic Cubano sandwich.  By god was this sandy good. The pork was juicy and tender, the Swiss was sharp, the garlic mojo was straight up rude and I loved how thinly the pickles were sliced. Natalie got the parrillada which is grilled skirt steak, chorizo, over easy egg, sweet plantain, white rice, black beans and avocado. Let me start by saying this plate was a star gazer. A real stunner. The starlet your wife catches you looking at.   The steak was slightly over cooked but the chimichurri was fresh and added a little color to the plate. Refreshing, if you will. The chorizo was delicious. Charred to absolute perfection.  You could call the egg Usain Bolt because boy was it runny.  Perfection. The plantains, rice and beans were nailed. Exactly how you expect them to come. (that's what she said)Finally....dessert. I went with my usual. Flancito. If you're a #flanfan I recommend getting it here. It was firm, moist and syrupy sweet. Topped with fresh strawberries to boot!  Natalie got the empanada de guava y queso. The empanada was excellent with a crispy exterior and fresh gooey cheese on the inside. The coconut ice cream that came with it was a bit over powering and kind of out of place. Like the drunk uncle at your nephew's 1st birthday party. Lastly, to the people behind the scenes. The service was fast and super friendly. Everyone was helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. The real MVPs. This place is five stars. I recommend to all. Find yourself a fedora and get your Cuban on.
2019-07-14,5,My favorite place! Love the ambiance and the food. We go there every single week and we are never disappointed.
2019-07-10,5,Hands down the best Cuban in the area!Especially love their Vaca Fritta, I usually go on a bit more about the places I review, but just happened to notice that the average score here is lower than I expected, so adding my "help".Other recommendations include great Mojito, killer Sangria, and one of my personal measures for a good Cuban place, excellent Ropa Vieja.This is the place I bring people over when asked what is the best restaurant in Hoboken.
2019-07-05,4,The food is good, but giving a 4 stars more for the vibe than anything.  I go there for brunch and they have really authentic live cuban music which is great.  They also have great sangrias and the garlic shrimp app is great.
2019-07-05,5,Very nice place. Great atmosphere and nice staff.We decided to give this a try based on the Yelp reviews and we were not disappointed. The Sangria was perfectly made, with a good blend of fruit and alcohol. The food was excellent as well. We tried the Churrasco, paella, garlic shrimp, guacamole and crab dip. Everything was delicious. A must try in Hoboken!
2019-06-28,4,cocktails are awesome and the eggplant appetizersmoky cocktails!We tried the appetizers and they are reaaaal cuban. Try the smoky cocktails if you are here.
2019-06-16,5,Great food worthy surprisingly huge portion. Enjoyed the outdoor seating and sangrias are wonderful. Recommend the skirt steak dinner, portion for two!
2019-06-09,3,Came here over Memorial Day Weekend.The waiter who served us was very sweet. It was his first day on the job he told us, and he had many specials of the day recommendations! The decor was fine and the restaurant itself is quite big - there is even a second floor.I got the Vaca Frita steak (twice cooked crispy skirt steak, tomato escabeche, avocado, white rice, black bean, garlic mojo). The portion was huge!! I even took it back with me and only finished it the next day. So not a bad restaurant over all. However being there with a complete jerk made me unable to enjoy my meal.
2019-06-05,4,One of my favorite places to eat in Hoboken.Food and sangria are always amazing in a cool setting with good service.
2019-06-03,5,Hung out with a friend for lunch. Food was great, sangrias were solid, and the atmosphere was enjoyable. I ordered the Paella Valenciana- delicious!Variety is the spice of life, and so is the menu. Check it out!
2019-05-25,5,Excellent red sangria as well as seasonal sangria.  Started with a glass of each then went for a half pitcher of the seasonal since it was so delicious.  The oxtail dish so very authentic with perfect rice, beans and plantains.  Nice goat cheese and beet salad as well as braised short rib stuffed peppers.  The chocolate stuffed churros with blackberry sauce was the perfect finish.
2019-05-23,5,To be honest, this is without a doubt the finest Cuban restaurants I have been to on the east coast.It's no nonsense and straight up great food.The ambience and live music made me feel like I was somewhere in Central America, the only thing I needed was a hammock and a some sunglasses. Couldn't wear a cap(they have a no cap/hat policy). I took mine off without debate out of respect cause I loved their food.Only one thing that didn't work for me was the slow service, but that is something one needs to expect on a busy Sunday with almost a 90 person occupancy.The drinks were deliciouso! Especially the Long Island ice tea( a drink which wasn't on their menu) but turned out to be so good. A Big Thumbs Up!
2019-05-19,4,The food in this restaurant was delicious. It was well prepared and "real" Cuban. The service was terrific. Our waitress Kim couldn't be nicer and more accommodating. A combo came in and they were excellent Two musicians playing and singing really entertained the restaurant with wonderful Spanish music. What could be better....Good food, wonderful service and entertainment. I will be back. I don't know how this place is on Sat or Fri evening but on Sunday it was great. On Sunday you can park for free on Washington St and there was plenty of space available.
2019-05-13,4,Simply amazing this restaurant From the food to the decoration to the ambience we went on a Saturday late afternoon for early dinner everyone loved it from the churrasco to the paella everyone came out very happy on this Mother's Day
2019-05-12,5,Wonderful place to grab drinks and appetizers. The paella is a seafood must. For appetizers, try the pork belly steam buns (special) and croquetas. Excellent seasonal sangrias and other mixed drink selections. Highly recommend!
2019-05-12,5,I was there last night with family, we were celebrating Mother's day. The food was great and the service was very good. Our waiters name was Andrea's  he was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely be going there again.
2019-05-02,1,This was my second time here. The first time, I don't remember anything bad so maybe it depends on staff and chef. Went here last night and was very disappointed. The combination of the following left me and my friends with the determination that we won't be coming back:1) Happy hour is only at the bar. If you sit at the table you do not get the deals. I know restaurants do this but I don't go to them for happy hour then! 2) You can't order appetizers ahead of time. They only submit the order with entrees. 3) My friend asked for her meal with specifications and they were not met. At the realization they were not met, there was no offer to take it back, make up for it, order something else.. it was like oh that sucks and  you have to still pay for it even though you only ordered that because I said we can do something and didn't. Also, pretty sure they forgot about her separate order until we asked for it.. 4) My own entree was VERY salty and I'm someone that loves salt. 5) Completely botched our payment. They charged my card twice with the other two people's amounts and my amount was charged to my friend.6) They had a survey at the end.. but it was already filled out when they gave us the check books back for the refund. Basically, they didn't give us the survey originally when they should have. Only after the botched check amounts, we got our little check books back and in it, (which it wasn't in there before) was  a survey that someone other than us checked off that all the service was great. Not a fan of lying. This is for themselves  but it just doesn't sit right and didn't help the continuous negatives of the night. Overall, considering how much they are charging at this place, I wouldn't recommend it. They really should consider that their food isn't that cheap and they really should be making sure that if a customer is paying for something, it is what they wanted. Most restaurants would have attempted to offer some type of reconciliation. Also, their policies are not worth coming here for, just one annoying thing after another. Even if the food was great, the policies still would have dampered our experience here. What's the point. There are so many other great Cuban spots that are reasonably priced with great food and service. Why bother?
2019-05-02,5,One of the best spots for Cuban food, always amazing service.Might seems much larger than it looks, humongous space inside the restaurant, really enjoying seating on the deck/second floor.
2019-04-28,5,My friend and I were in the mood for Cuban food and after a brief google search decided to check out the restaurant. Upon arrival we were told they had limited seating due to their Saturday happy hour but luckily enough the table at the front was available. Although it wasn't ideal due to the cool wind, we were so enticed by the ambience, music, and friendly host that we decided to take it. The GM, Nelson and his staff accommodated us and made us feel very welcome. He helped us choose the right dishes from appetizer to main course and he even suggested the seasonal sangria which was amazing. Every time our glasses ran low, they topped us up. The food portions are just the right amount, the empanadas are mouth watering and the sangria was sweet with a kick. I recommend trying their fish of the day yesterday it came with pumpkin risotto or their Pollo Criollo. We have dined in Hoboken before but the service at The Cuban cannot be matched. If we had space for desert we would have indulged. I am already planning to have brunch there within the next two weeks. If you are ever on Washington Avenue, check them out.
2019-04-21,1,I was at this place today around 2 pm and wanted to sit outside with a friend and my baby which I  had a small stroller with an infant who was sleeping, I was told by the manager to leave me carriage outside... I replied my baby is sleeping why would I leave my carriage by the sidewalk  and the manager didn't care  and told me to leave with a smile and I replied with ok let's see who will laugh when I write a review on yelp with his behavior and still smiled at me and said just leave .... no one has right to act this way to a customer and with a baby in hand I would have understand if the restraint was crowed and didn't want to le my carriage in but it was empty at the time and his behavior was unacceptable ...I would have gave zero star if could have and hope the OWNER OF THE RESTAURANT reads this review and see how is staff treats there customers !
2019-04-17,5,Ah-mazing from start to finish! The host greeted us like we were family as soon as we walked in the door and offered us a seat either in the front or in the back. Intrigued, we asked to check out he back which looked like a cute tucked away Cuban club with three levels. We sat on the top level looking over the second and it was a lovely environment. Mock-tails were killer and my husband super enjoyed is capriñas. Then came the steak- I don't remember the last time I sat back to savor a bite of steak. It was heavenly. I ordered skirt steak with chimichuri and yucca fries. It was to die for. And the plus plus: yucca fries are amazing when down right and this was done right! My husband ordered the steak in a red sauce that was so tender and delicious and came with rice to soak up all the yumminess in his bowl. It was an outstanding evening all around. Our only wish is that we lived nearby because we would be there all too often! Enjoy!
2019-04-14,5,Best restaurant in Hoboken. Customer Service 5/5: staff is always friendly and accommodating. Ambiance 4/5: a romantic and intimate feel. Can sometimes be a little loud but always fun. Live music on week nights.Food Quality 5/5: huge portions, amazing flavors. Can't go wrong with anything pork belly. The lump crab guacamole and fried plantains are to die for. Best drink prices in Hoboken. Overall 5/5
2019-04-08,4,My rating is really a very high 4. I went there on Saturday night we were a group of seven celebrating my husband's birthday. I can't say enough about how awesome our waitress (Sandra) was, she made good recommendations and always thought ahead, quite funny as well. For appetizers we decided to share, we ordered a couple plates of the octopus which was amazing, the guacamole plain and with crab. The plantain chips that accompany the guac. was so addictive that I think we all got stuffed just from that. We also got pitchers of the sparkling wine sangria which was really good.Everyone really enjoyed their entrees there were no complaints. I ordered the surf and turn and the steak was so amazing. I was only a little taken back as they will not do any substitution, I wanted rice instead of potatoes. I order the rice and it was delicious.I will definitely be back.
2019-04-02,5,We loved this place!! The experience was amazing. We brought our son here for his 15th birthday. Sandra Catalina took great care of us!! This place has elevated my standards for Cuban restaurants. Everything was perfect. Would highly recommend!!!
2019-03-28,1,Was treated poorly upon walking through the door by the server.  I walked in at 7:50pm and informed the server that I was there for an 8pm reservation for a party of nine. The server told me to wait by the bar which I did. After a few minutes I asked him if I could be seated at the reserved table to which he replied "We only seat complete parties." I said ok and continued to wait. Three more people arrived who were in my party and he sat all three without question while leaving me at the bar without acknowledgement. I walked up to the table and asked the server why I was instructed to wait and then over looked as he walked the three other parties to the table. Again he stated "We only seat full complete parties." I stated "3 parties are not 9 parties and they were seated without hesitation." He did not have a response and walked away. I would have liked to have been seated at the table do to a birth defect which pains me to stand at times. I can not think of another reason as to why my request to be seated was not granted while the others had no issue at all other than me being African American.  Having my night ruined, I left the establishment without eating because I refuse to give a place my business while being treated subpar.
2019-03-20,1,This was probably the most most awkward experience at a restaurant I've ever had. I came with a friend and was sat a table. We ordered a pitcher of sangria and then attempted to order appetizers. The server told us that we were not ordering enough to warrant seats at a table and that we would have to move. We told him that we weren't sure what entrees we wanted yet and that the host had sat us there. He replied very condescendingly that it was written clearly on the sign out front that table service was only for full dinner service and that their policy was to only take full dinner orders. The host who sat us failed to mention that table service was " full dining service" (whatever that means). Also, there was only one other 2 person party sitting down in the main room. Unfortunately my friend and I were forced to move to bar. We would have been perfectly happy to stand at the bar from the beginning if we had known we would have been kicked out of the empty dining room for attempting to order appetizers. We were so put off that we left after we finished our pitcher and apps.
2019-03-20,1,So disappointed in the service I received tonight. The bar was completely full so we sat down at a 2 person table. After we ordered a $26 pitcher of sangria and attempted to put in some appetizers we were told tables were only for full dinner service and would require us to order a minimum of 2 appetizers per person, 4 total, in order to sit at the table. We were forced to move to the bar once there was room. The waiter was degrading and dismissive. There were 6 open tables next to us. Wtf. I would never go back.
2019-03-06,5,Service is good, food taste great. One thing to note is that this restaurant really uses interesting ingredients on the food. It may not be for everyone. I would recommend going with the safer generic items before moving on to the other creative dishes.
2019-02-25,5,My partner and I loved this place! To start off the service was amazing and quick. Marco, our waiter, helped us out with what to drink and recommended an appetizer. Someone was always coming around to clear out the table and refill the water. The food was delicious. I highly recommend the ropa vieja or the churrasco. Both very tasty and cooked to perfection. The bread given before the meal was insanely delicious. I will definitely visit again. The only thing I would have preferred it to be a little less was the garlic in our appetizer- antojitos.
2019-02-22,5,Wow this was the best dinner I've had in a while. The steak was amazing. Appetizers great. And the churros...wow!
2019-02-18,5,Stopped by on a rainy night in December while on a business trip. This area has so many restaurants that choosing the best one seemed like a project, so just decided to go for what I was craving, good Cuban food, and boy was I happy!The restaurant feels cozy and intimate, upscale and trendy. I sat at the bar and started with the delicious mojito- they have a nice selection of flavored mojitos. I had the guava, which was fresh and didn't feel like a cheap syrupy drink but rather a home made from scratch one. For the meal I had the pork, excellently cooked with the classic sides done to perfection. The staff was friendly and accommodating to my request of tostones in place of amarillos. I highly recommend this place for authentic Cuban done right and in an upscale setting to boot. I'll be back next time I'm in town.
2019-02-17,5,An amazing Cuban Miami Ambience in the Center of Hoboken! Excellent food and a very friendly  group of servers! Frank, our waiter,  did a supperb job!  I would highly recommend the Churasco dinner with a nice drink of  Brazilian Caipirinha. The list of wine is great too! Well worth the visit!
2019-02-03,5,The ratings are pretty spot on, this lace is great! All the meat we ordered was cooked so perfectly the creamy spinach that came with the surf and turf was phenomenal!! The chimichurri sauce is delicious. I can't say enough good things about the food here!! Shrimp was great and flavorful as the rest of the food! Really worth trying ! We will be back !!
2019-01-29,3,An extremely mediocre Cuban restaurant. I came here to celebrate a birthday and we were given the entire back room to ourselves. Very spacious, the room was extremely dark. Also, because there were about 20 of us, we had to sit at 2 different tables which made it difficult to socialize. I was very disappointed in the vaca frita. I kept squeezing lime on it in hopes that it would give it more juice but I was wrong. The vaca frita was extremely dry and overcooked. When I learned how much my portion cost (including gratuity) I honestly could not believe it. To me, my meal was worth no more than $15. A friend of mine raves about this place, but I beg to differ. There are Cuban restaurants with better food and better prices not far from this one. I would recommend one of those before recommending this restaurant to anyone.
2019-01-26,1,I really don't understand the good reviews.  I have tried this place a few times and it hasn't been good at all.  The service is very slow, the manager is obnoxious, the prices are high, and the food has ranged from terrible and inedible.  I'm done giving this place more chances.
2019-01-17,5,Not only was the food absolutely delicious, the service was incredible. We felt so welcome, which definitely makes a difference when dining. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone and I'll be going back!!
2019-01-15,5,best place in Hoboken to eat! My husband and I are obsessed with the vaca frita.. it's the best!! And the drinks are always good! Would definitely recommend this place but not with the kids :)
2019-01-14,5,I came here last Saturday. We were already on the way and called to make a reservation, they happily accommodated us. The food was DELICIOUS and plenty. The portions are very good considering the price. I ordered the guava mojito, it tasted like fresh guava! The churrasco was huge and perfectly cooked. We also ordered the chicken empanada for appetizer, it was overstuffed and very well seasoned. The ropa vieja and paella were also on point. This place is a must go if you're in Hoboken!
2019-01-08,4,Nice Bar/Restaurant in Hoboken.  Found it while walking along Washington.  When we went in it was Happy Hour and there was a live duet playing Latin music.  Very nice.  Sat at the bar and ordered from their Happy Hour drinks and food menu, shared three small plates and had mojitos. :)A nice place.  Bartender was excellent!
2019-01-05,5,Great place! So tasty and great service! Amazing food and drinks! Good if you have food intolerances!
2019-01-02,4,**** GOOD CUBAN FOOD, SPACE & VIBES****EXPERIENCE*=*=*=*=*=*=I dropped in this Hoboken jewel along side my boyfriend during happy hours on a wed evening (4-8pm). We orderedAppetizers & drinks from the happier hour menu which hit the spot. Definitely recommend you to stop in. FOOD*=*=*=*Yes yes yes to the guacamole with crab meat. Such a unique, flavorsome twist to this well known appeaser.They also add a twist of plantain chips instead of regular tortilla chips which adds a taste of authenticity all in one. Loved the shrimp in garlic sauce and super recommend it alongside some black beans and white rice. AMBIANCE*=*=*=*=*=*=Cuban music for the vibes in the air x large open space for seating and a full bar. Warm and dim lighting.

It's Hoboken. You know how it is. TIPS*=*=*=**Come during happy hour... choose the red sangria over the white FOR BEST FLAVOR. Chose the guava mojito over the regular mojito.
2018-12-26,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. A definite must try. Great atmosphere, the staff is very attentive and love their music selection.I've been here a couple of times at different times. Sunday's Brunch is great along with the live music. I was here last night as well with my family, for dinner. Appetizers were delicious we had the Antojitos which is a small mix of different appetizers so so good especially the grilled chorizo. We also ordered Pan con Pollo Frito OMG a must try. Think of the Chinese steamed bun bread used ...very similar used for the tasty fried chicken .. You Must try!For dinner I had Churrasco (Grilled Skirt Steak) came out so tender. Cooked just right accompanied with a watercress salad which was so refreshing and some Yuca Fries ... Delicious!My family had Ropa Vieja which was really good and Salmon dish which was cooked just right and El Classico ... if you love pork this is a Must ... the roasted pork shank was cooked just right very tender came off the bone with a fork.If you love Cuban food and are looking for great ambience I recommend The Cuban
2018-12-23,3,I visited the Cuban for the first time and it was good. It's a great place for a date, it has a romantic setting and the music is not too loud. Perfect place to have Cuban food and talk. The food was good, I do not have any complaints but I also was not crazy about it. The bread they served before the meal was probably my favorite part. I ordered spinach and cheese empanadas with rice and beans on the side. It was filling and again no complaints but nothing I'm dying to go back for. As a vegetarian, I did not see many vegetarian options so keep that in mind if you do not eat meat. I had a glass of red wine sangria that was nice and smooth and went along well with the meal.
2018-12-17,5,Amazing churasco steak! Went there around 4pm on Saturday, the bar cocktails were super cheap, $5. The bar food was mostly fried food, but the entres were amazing. Great service and staff.
2018-12-16,5,I went to the Cuban today and quite honestly it is a top 5 restaurant I've ever been to.  Not only is it beautiful and understated inside the staff makes you feel welcome without having that phoney feel.  Our server Frank was amazing and the entire staff pitched in giving us new silverware after each course and wiping our table down.  I ordered the empanaditas de pollo as an appetizer and they were perfect.  The cuban sandwich is the best cuban I have ever had and while I haven't been to Cuba I've had them all over florida.  If I could give 109 stars I would I recommend this to anyone even remotely near Hoboken it will be worth your while.
2018-12-10,4,Was in Hoboken visiting niece & nephew so we made reservations for Saturday night at 7pm. Place was packed every bar stool and seat.  Bigger place than you think but still small dining areas. Seats are close but very manageable. Service was good in that even though very busy you get their attention (drinks or water refilled). Starting with guacamole which was great and garlic shrimp with toast. Garlic shrimp could have been more garlicky but that is just me. Drink pours (vodka on rocks) was good not s thimble. Most of the table had the skirt steak and the loved it. I had the ox tail and it was delicious. I had the coconut ice cream with icewine from upstate NY. Great time and restaurant
2018-12-02,2,Came to visit Jersey for the weekend and someone recommended this place . In part wasn't too happy about their strict rules of no hats allowed, how about those people that aren't comfortable with their looks. Anyhow, in overall most of food was good except for the Caesar salad, it was cooked all saggy, Chef what were you thinking ? You can't cook lettuces, they supposed to be fresh and crispyWon't recommend  this place to my friends
2018-12-01,4,Great food, nice environment. Rushed service, prices felt right for the restaurant we were in though.
2018-12-01,5,The seafood is delicious! The waiter is very knowledgeable with the food and the entire team is attentive. My water glass was never half empty and any empty plates were cleared immediately. The food is authentic and flavorful. You must order the paella! My only regret was not having dessert, because I had to get to a show. It is by far, my favorite restaurant! I will definitely dine here again and bring family and friends!
2018-11-30,5,Came in here on a Friday night.  I ordered the dish with shellfish, pork, and, chorizo.  It was absolutely delicious.  The bread was amazing too, it's warm and the butter makes it perfect.  I would definitely come back.
2018-11-29,5,I have been here a few times and each time a great experience. From the appetizers to the entrees- nothing is less than mediocre. I always get the ropa vieja, I just love it so much. Drinks here are pretty strong so beware. The service is great. Make sure to have reservations especially on weekends.
2018-11-28,5,The absolute best Cuban food I've ever had. I highly recommend the Vaca Frita, it's SO delicious. It's really nice to sit outside during the summer, and is cozy in the winter. I'm not a shrimp fan (at all), but the Camarones al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) was very tasty. We also like to get the empanadas, which are wonderful as well!The servers and bartenders have all been great!
2018-11-18,5,The atmosphere is "romantic".The food is sOooooo good.mhm mhm tasty! lolI'm a woman & if U fellas want to impress your girlfriend/wife I would certainly bring her here.U might get laid afterwards.Happy eating! =-D
2018-11-16,3,The Cuban is located in a great place! It's very close to The Shannon and Mills Tavern which is great if you want to party a little bit after dinner. There is street parking around the corner, 2-hour meters and 4-hour meters. When you walk in, you're greeted by a host who seats you very quickly, which was fun; he pulled the table from in front of the booth I was hopping into and then pushed it back in place. Very nice.Our waiter was very hyper but he tried; he just had so much energy and was a little overbearing. The little pieces of bread we were given were slightly undercooked and doughy in the middle, which was disappointing.My meal was okay, nothing super special but I figure that you're paying for the ambience and not the food because there are plenty of other Cuban restaurants that would cost less and I wouldn't have to pay for parking so honestly, I probably won't be back. It wasn't a bad experience but it wasn't anything to excite me to go back.
2018-11-13,4,So we got here just shortly after they stopped serving lunch. Very sad, i wanted to try their food. But we decided to stay and enjoy their happy hour. The served appetizers still so we got a a couple and shared those instead. We got the ceviche, mussels, and empanadas. Everything tasted great. The ceviche was the star, fresh, crisp, tangy flavor of limes, cilantro, tomatoes, and the shrimp cooked perfectly tender, served with plantain chips. Great balance. The mussels were also very tasty. Savory, buttery, mussels cooked just right, the fries were not soggy, it was fried crispy but tender soft fry. The empanadas were nice, fried, crispy, and savory filling. I wish we could've tried their entrees but maybe next time when we visit NYC again. Overall great small place for any kind of date or place to eat.
2018-11-09,5,It was a wonderful experience. Just happened upon it as I took a lunch after doing UBER/Lyft. The pineapple mojito is bananas!
2018-10-26,4,Came here about an hour before they were closing up but they were very accommodating and took the time to walk me through the menu which was in all spanish.  Luckily the person I was with was fluent.  She and the waiter made a good team in educating me on the menu.
2018-10-20,4,Was recommended by some friends so try this place out. We started with the guac and crab meat followed with the table they bring to the table, pan con queso (bread with cheese) and what i believe tasted like truffle butter. Could've eaten that warm bread all night! For main course i got the mar y tierra. The steak was cooked perfectly and the chimichurri sauce was delicious!!!! Shrimp were great as well. I wasn't a fan of the potatoe or cream of spinach. The potato had an odd taste - couldn't pin point it... and the cream of spinach lacked salt. Had i known i would've just ordered the items above on the menu which was the same steak, yuca and salad.
2018-10-20,1,Absolutely horrendousService was terrible-not sure his name, but definitely stands out over the othersFood was not goodManagement uncaringOverall a terrible experienceThe table next to us had the same experience including having this server spill a glass of red wine all over them-Soaked!Overhearing the conversation the manager/owner did nothing for them other than 'offering an after dinner drink'Steer clearTo the owner/Manager -hire a true manager and stay behind the scenes
2018-10-16,5,My go to cuban place in hoboken! All of the food is really fresh, consistently good and authentic. The service is really good. Get the Sangrias!
2018-10-14,5,If your looking for excellent food and great service in Hoboken; check out The Cuban Restaurant! The drinks and appetizers are awesome. Juan; thank you for providing great service and giving us the recommendation on the food.
2018-10-11,5,My boyfriend and I came here on a whim, and honestly, our dinner was by far one of the best meals we have ever had. From the moment we bit into the AMAZING freshly made Pao de Queijo, we knew we were set for a great meal. Our first dish was the Pulpo and oh god, I've never had better tasting octopus before... the black bean purée, the pesto, the roasted potatoes, and a slight tang of the sauce just melded into the octopus SO WELL. It melted in our mouths. Last but not least, we got their famous churrasco to share. Holy. Sh*t. That skirt steak was cooked to perfection with chimichurri on top. The fried yuca and the watercress salad were amazing pairings to the beautifully cooked steak.I forgot to mention the most important thing--the service is exceptional. Even though we sat on the second floor, we had waiters come up to us at the best timing to help us clear our plates, set up new ones, pour our water for us, and even folding my boyfriend's dining cloth when he stepped away to use the bathroom! If that's not great service, I don't know what is!I can't believe we lived a block away for the past year without ever coming here. Definitely regretting that.Now, whenever we get our salary, this will be our first meal from our paycheck.
2018-10-06,4,This place is awesome, the food is great. They serve large portions, the sangria is a must, and they play live music. Customer service could improve, perhaps give a smile here and there. Other than that I recommend to go.
2018-09-27,5,Amazing experience !We were in the patio seating. Nice small patio :)The hosts were just great, very friendly very courteous !and the food was just amazing. Just loved the -BreadsChicken bunGuac with crab meat and the best seafood Paella in a while. Well cooked and filled with seafoods.Will highly recommend this place !!
2018-09-09,5,This place was such a super laid back place. Went on a date night dinner with my husband and we loved it!The food was DELICIOUS. The service was great. I love the atmosphere. I would definitely be visiting again! *Thanks The Cuban!
2018-09-03,5,Definitely one of the best places I went in Hoboken. We went there on a Friday night we were seated immediately. The only down stand of the this place is that happy hour is only at the bar. However, we choose to sit and order- we got the summer sangria with pineapple and strawberry. Now the food, omg I got the Ropa vieja shredded beef with rice. Amazing!!! We also got the yuca fries.  The service was also amazing Jose was awesome !
2018-09-01,5,Service Out of this World! Frank was very informative and gave great advice on the selection. Everything was well prepared and amazing. My husband ordered the skirt steak and he enjoyed every bit of it because it came with black beans and the steak was shredded. I had the oxtails and I definitely will be back for more! We ordered the passionfruit sangria! My husband loved it, which is great considering he doesn't usually drink sangria. Jose our second server sealed the deal and ensured that we'll be back soon.
2018-08-23,5,Love this restaurant! The skirt steak here does NOT disappoint!! The mussels were good too. Ate here a few times. A little pricey. The flavors are great though. The drinks are good too. Service is usually great. Mushrooms are good and the salad too. Dressings and sauces are delicious. Love the fresh ingredients. The guacamole is delicious too.
2018-08-17,5,I can't believe this place has anything below 5 stars. The service was amazing, warm, and friendly. Not an ounce of annoyance when we came in near closing time. The wait staff was attentive but not overbearing. The food was perfectly seasoned, and our skirt steak was a perfect medium rare, not even a bit overdone. Our cocktails were great too. I recommend this place.
2018-08-12,5,I have been coming here since it first open 7-8 years ago and somehow I've been coming to this place for family dinners and special events. The bread is awesome , it will melt in your mouth. Call in early for weekend reservations and ask for availability in the zebra lounge which is my favorite place to eat and if you decide to just walk in for some drinks with some buddies, just be sure ask if there is room at the bar.
2018-08-10,4,Great happy hour drinks and snacks. The happy hour food portions are slightly smaller but still a good deal for the price. The drinks were made really well also. Good happy hour spot
2018-08-07,5,Amazing ambiance, food, and even better mojitos. The food was authentic and had so much flavor. Also live music was great!
2018-08-06,1,After an amazing day my partner planned for me we came here to finish celebrating my bday. It was such a disappointment. Alex - the server made this experience the worse. First I was sitting on the booth side of the table and my partner joined next to me until the food came. Then Alex came to our table and said we couldn't sit together. To my surprised "this was not allowed" I've been to so many restaurants and this was never an issue. There was so much space between the tables that I am sure we weren't making anyone uncomfortable, clearly it bothered management. Two I ordered seltzer with lemon, the lemon came after the third time I asked for it. It was also very uncomfortable that Alex and the manager kept staring at our table and talking about us. Also, I noticed that every table was given bread the moment they came in. We didn't get any. I even asked for it and Alex said yes of course... it never came..Lastly what sealed the deal for me and reassured me that I would never come here again was when we were done with dessert, Alex was taking away the plates and coffee and he spilled the milk on my partner. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and said it was an accident but his response made me change my mind. He did it on purpose because he never apologized and didn't even help her by bringing her a clean napkin... nothing. I am giving this place one star only because I can't rate it any less. I will not comment on the food or my rest of the experience because this place does not deserve any positive comments. Oh and the food was overpriced, I would like to say the food made it worth it but no!
2018-08-06,1,I came with my partner for her 29th birthday. So many things happened that were so disappointing. Our server (Alex) was terrible at providing the service we were expecting for such a beautiful restaurant. First off, my partner was sitting on the booth side, so i went to sit next to her before the food came to us so we can talk. Yes, i was holding her hand. There is SO much room between each table and i know we were not bothering anyone, except of course, the person that wanted us to be moved. I was asked to go back to my seat because "it wasn't allowed to sit next to each other on the booth". Okay wow rude. But let's just blame management for that, not our server. Let's continue.Next, we asked for seltzer and lemon as drinks - we had to ask for lemon 3 times before it got to us. The table next to us got bread as soon as they sat down. My partner was hoping to receive the same kind of treatment. We asked Alex if we can have bread and he said yes, of course. We stayed waiting for thar bread the entire time there. Never did we get it. We asked to order our appetizer first, and were told no sorry we only take complete orders. Mmkay. One thing i'll give this place, the food was good. We had the ropa vieja and vaca frita, then we ordered the flan. All very good. Another thing, the rest of the staff was super attentive and kind. Our server was the only one with the attitude problem. Lastly, Alex was cleaning up our coffee, plates and milk. He SPILLS the milk all over my arm/hand and leg. He goes "are you okay?" And moves it along quickly. I sat there thinking its cool, no worries. He'll bring a napkin and help clean the table. NOPE. He came over with the check instantly. I cleaned myself as well as the table. Also where was the apology?? That made me think he did that on purpose.All in all, if i could go back in time, I would have left the second they told me to go back to my seat. I should have known that this establishment, or at least our waiter, was going to give us the least pleasant experience. We didn't leave because i didn't want to make it awkward for my partner on her birthday. But thanks to this locale, they did that themselves. Obviously, I'll never come back here again. Such an unfortunate experience. We hope you'll do better for your future customers.
2018-08-05,5,Went for a late lunch, staff was great, the food was amazing, prices a little high but reasonable, love music playing too!
2018-08-05,4,Food was good, service was attentive , a bit noisy, and be sure to check your bill because one of our guests ordered 2 drinks and was charged for 5.
2018-08-04,5,I am so glad we tried this place tonight! Such a cute atmosphere.  We sat at the bar for a little while waiting for the rest of our party. Our bartender was great.. drinks very yummy. Our waiter was so good.. gave wonderful food suggestions and was very attentive to our table. The food is simply amazing! We started with crab guacamole app and pork belly app... delicious! I had the ropa vieija... so yummy! Everyone in our party had a delicious dish... dessert was churros and guava stuffed puff pastry.. again delicious! If you like Cuban food this is the place to be!  We will be back for sure!!
2018-08-02,5,One of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Have always had fabulous food and drinks here. Genuinely, one of my favorite places to go out to eat with a date, the parents, or just a night with the girls. The wait staff is great with providing recommendations and they typically have awesome specials.
2018-07-30,4,Went there with a group for a dinner.  We had great service and were seated in the back area of the restaurant at a nice long table.  We ordered a nice wine and then set about ordering appetizers to share and then entrees. The guacamole was very tasty and had some spice served with plantains. The ceviche salmon was also a favorite.  Some other fried items were ok...Entree was the pork leg with trimmings and the fish.  Both dishes were very rich and abundant but were full of flavor.   I recommend this place.
2018-07-28,5,The wife wanted to try a new place.The night started good ,found parking right away.Sat at the bar...bartender was excellent...my wife ordered a mojito cubano...Now my wife is very picky when it comes to her mojitos.I warned the bartender that the pressure was on...he asked her ,how she like it made...he made it...my wife said it was great!Food really good.Came quickly.Real good favor.Great service and food.
2018-07-27,3,This place is more interesting as a bar. On food its on the expensive side not so special as such. We ordered tapas mainly and they were ok not great.
2018-07-26,5,One of my fave Cuban restaurants ever! Food is always good, service is good too. We always come here for special occasion dinner or even just for happy hour. Definitely worth a try!
2018-07-26,5,Very content with my experience and the food being cooked up here. The space is nice, music is good, and the service is fast and on the money. Your served bread to start. I don't know how they make it but it's like crack. It's addictive. I rh n ordered from the prefixed menu (appetizer, entree, dessert for $31 or 32 dollars). I ordered a salad to start that had cheese and fruit and walnuts in it. Fresh sweet and savory. For my entree I ordered the pork that came with rice and beans, yuca, and plantain. My Girlfriend ordered a seafood dish that was excellent. For dessert I was served the Tres Leches cake (GF did the flan).
2018-07-25,4,I went on a date here, and I really enjoyed myself. It's a Cuban spot (which you can obviously tell by the name). There's seating outside, directly inside, at the bar, and there's two floors in the back for seating as well. It has very intimate lighting, which makes the ambiance very comfortable. Our waiter was extremely friendly. We ordered 3 different types of appetizers. The chicken empanadas were delicious. The chicken wasn't dry, and they had this seasoning drizzle on the bottom of the plate that I was a huge fan of. I also had these garlic shrimps which I loved. It's a little bit spicy (not much, but if you're very sensitive to spice, you might not like that), and was absolutely delicious. That appetizer also comes with garlic bread. The last appetizer that I tried were the ham croquetas. They were okay, I've definitely have had better in my life.Then for my entree I had "el clasico". The serving size was fair. The moro was good, the pork was extremely tender and well seasoned. Overall everything tasted really good. The prices are a little on the high side ($20 and up). I would definitely go back though!
2018-07-25,5,The Cuban is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken.  Every single time I've been there, the food is top notch.  The bread is gluten-free, which is a big win for me and my husband loves it too.  The appetizers, sangria, and the entrees are so so good.  We will continue to come back here as often as we can! Highly recommend.
2018-07-24,4,This has become a go to dinner spot/ reco for me in hoboken. The food and drinks are always on point, as is the service. It also takes resos, which seems to be less of a thing in hoboken. Things you have to try- seasonal mojitos and sangria. The crab guacamole, the appetizer sampler, vaca frita, churrasco, and paella. They always have great music playing and if you sit up front in the bar area, lots of time there is a live band.
2018-07-23,5,We went there for a Saturday brunch and they had  good specials options. I went for the salmon ceviche which was delicious. The glutten free house bread that they serve to begin with was srumptious and went well with the garlic butter cheese. You could tell and each ingredient used was of good quality. We didnt try as many options as we were just two of us but we really enjoyed their French toast. Which was a melt in your mouth experience.
2018-07-16,4,​Quickly becoming a once-in-while favorite for me in Hoboken. Once in a while, because it does hit the wallet. The food is delicious (low-carb and paleo types should stay away: lots of rice, lots of beans, and the standard appetizer are these chewy dough balls). I recently had the pork shank and when I lifted the bone, all the meat just slid off. The pollo criollo was also really good. I'm going back to get the churrasco steak, the guy at the table next to me raved about it. The mojitos are good, and I'm not much of a sweet cocktail person but when in Rome, right? I have a large appetite and I consider the portions comfortable for the relatively high prices ($20-35 range for entrees) so the portion/price ratio complaint I generally have for trendy Hoboken restaurants, especially newer ones, does not apply here. When I pay $25 for a dinner entree and it's appetizer-sized, that really gives me the red ass. The dinner bill at The Cuban is never cheap, so I'm not coming here all the time, but I leave quite full and buzzed on rum each time I do. I believe that is the only appropriate way to leave a Cuban restaurant. As long as it's every now and then, I'm down to come here for dinner.
2018-07-15,3,They have a no baseball hat policy, gentlemen. I wasn't wearing a baseball hat. It was a dad hat from a very exclusive brand. Sitting at the front of the restaurant were guests with flip flops on, which lead me to believe the no hat policy is a discriminatory one, and not about etiquette or consistent standards for a dress code. The decor was very dated. I did like the space, including the loft area, but if you have trouble with stairs good luck getting to a bathroom. The interiors could use an update.I had the ropa vieja. The flavor was average at best, although a bit salty, and the meat was overly shredded. It seemed as if the ropa vieja had been over cooked for too long, and really fell apart leaving the salty sauce. It didn't have the bigger chunks of meat I'm used to, but instead very stringy, hair like meat fibers. Drinks were better than the food.I read some reviews of other people discussing the dress code, and the rude treatment of the staff and found them hard to disagree with. I will never come back.
2018-07-15,5,Exquisite food! Love the vibe, the music the atmosphere the food was amazing ! The recommendation our server gave us for our appetizer was so yummy! I had the paella and my fiancé had the churrasco which let me tell you that watercress salad is to die for! And then they recommended the pastelito which is like a empanada or for the people that don't know what that is either is like a stuffed patty with cream cheese and guava and then coconut ice cream on the side with mint and then they drizzle caramel all over . It's sooooo goood!!!! Also the recommended half pitcher of their special brazilian sangria is really goood i got my food tipsy-ness out of it!!
2018-07-15,3,Been here twice- the first time I went I had a really good experience, the food was great and all. The 2nd time I went which was recently I ordered the Vaca Frita, and let me tell you I had better Vaca Frita in other Cuban restaurants. My friend and I were super disappointed by the taste. I love Cuban restaurants and I am always going to them but this one is way to over price. The prices on the menu are ridiculous. The drinks are good and average when it comes to pricing. You can easily find meter parking around Washington St. I also, like how it has like 3 different floors/ areas for sitting. When we went it was around 19 of us and we kinda had our own little area.
2018-07-13,3,We've been here twice and didn't have the best experience the second time. The mojitos weren't so great and the vaca frita was dry. The ropa vieja and the chicken empanadas were great. The service was kind of slow as well.
2018-07-10,3,My mother loved the pork shank! My vaca frita was super fried and a bit burnt .... but would give them another chance! They have a great menu  and drink menu! My drink wasn't strong ... but would def go back for the pork shank! Loved the vibe of the place!
2018-07-10,4,What a find! The husband took me out to this fabulous little place. I had the paella and he had the skirt steak. They don't carry steak sauce which is fine with me but the husband loves his sauce so he was a little disappointed. We were very satisfied with our food as well as the ambiance. They had a live 2 man band and the atmosphere was great. Service here was impeccable as the staff is really on top of things. The tables are a little on the small side though; when they brought out our food, it got a little tight and it was a uncomfortable for my husband to cut into the steak for fear of knocking something over. Would I recommend this place? Yes! Will I be returning? Absolutely!
2018-07-02,5,First time here and deff going to be Returning ! Everything was great from start to finish . Stopped in for a date night with my boyfriend we enjoyed the octopus for a starter I had the churassco and he had a chicken dish ! Both delish for dessert we enjoyed the coconut ice cream and bread pudding ! Coconut ice cream had real coconut in it you can taste the flakes and the bread pudding was warm and tasty ! Had a espresso martini and a titos cocktail forgot the name but both very very good ! Can't wait to come back
2018-06-16,5,Fantastic drinks and excellent service from Kevin. This is a great place to unwind. Happy hour specials on drinks and appetizers. Definitely recommended if you're in Hoboken. There is a break in hours where they reopen in the afternoon. Double check before you go.Thanks again Kevin, for the excellent service.
2018-06-13,5,The food was absolutely delicious. Everything from the bread the served to the entrees was great. Abe they have excellent customer service. They're expensive, but the quality and experiance is worth it.
2018-06-02,5,MUST GO - if you're in Hoboken. I get the vaca fritas every time and the steak is crispy and flavorful. The octopus is also really good - I don't eat that but everyone that I'm with that does really enjoys it haha so I'll keep that in this review for them. If you eat at the bar, the bartenders are usually pretty awesome and make cocktails based on what you're "in the mood for" The bar also has a different menu, small plates which you can't get if you sit down. Live music in the summer. Staff is so nice!
2018-05-29,3,The place was super cute and well decorated.  I felt the service was a little slow, but  everyone was super nice! Food was not too bad, but wasn't mind blowing in my opinion!  Prices were reasonable and they do have outdoor seating which is nice.  We went there when they had a $5 mojito special which was nice.  Not sure I would go again, but it was an overall good experience.
2018-05-28,5,This place has a great happy hour!!! $5 top shelf drinks! That's a great deal. We also stayed for dinner and the food was really good. I just wish they had more vegetarian options because I don't eat meat. I think they only had one option for a vegetarian entree. The service is really good. Everyone was really friendly and attentive.
2018-05-27,5,Im currently sitting in this restaurant and could not wait to write a review of how good the food was. I ordered the pollo criollo and it was literally mouth watering ! I recommend it to anyone! Their sangria was also amazing! Will most definitely be coming back and trying their churrasco
2018-05-25,1,My wife and I waited at bar for 1/2 hour to get a table outside.  Had a warm beer and overly sour white sangria while we waited.  Finally got seated outside and after ordering drinks and apps.  We asked to hold on to a menu to order entrees.  After 10 more minutes the waiter returned to ask us if we were ready to order entrees and we said not yet.  He told us that he could not put in our drink orders or apps until he had our entrees because outside dining was for people who ordered dinners only.  We decided to leave and they actually let us walk. Stupid rule
2018-05-24,5,Came here with a couple colleagues on a sunny Friday for lunch and boy what a delight. A lunch for the history books! Got a table outside under the awning with said colleagues, picturesque af location on Washington St. Got things started on a GREAT note with the Pineapple Mojito and some apps which included the bacon wrapped plantains and the Camarones al Ajillo (garlic shrimp).The flavors of each dish on their own were rich but not over powering. I imagine the plantains and shrimp were having an after party in my stomach, sippin on the mojito and giving eachother high fives before they made their inevitable grand exit!Moving onto the main course, I'm 2 Mojitos in and I knew right then and there things were going to start heatin up so I cancelled my afternoon appointments, which I had none of. Per suggestion from my colleague Adam, I ordered the Ropa Vieja. Adam, a local in the area for years, is one really cool dude. He got the quinoa with Vegetables just because hes training for a spartan race. We still made fun of him for getting that. Ropa Vieja is a traditional Cuban dish consisting of shredded beef with vegetables (s/o Wikipedia.com).However, Wikipedia doesn't give this fare nearly enough cred. The Cubans Ropa Vieja is easily a 10/10. Texture, smell, flavor and any other sensation you can imagine. Plus, the portion of beef is yuge. I was KO'd about halfway through, meatsweats drenching my face and pits. When it was all said and done, it became top 3 meals I've had in the mile square.It doesn't end there. If you think I didn't take the rest of my Ropa Vieja home with me well you can leave. I had the genius idea of doing a little steak and eggs the next morning with my leftovers. Got the pan hot with a little oil and basically refried them joints. Tasted just as good as it did the day before and mixed with the eggs, Chef Daniel was feelin it. Cant wait to return to my new "Cuban spot" as I'm a big Cuban guy now. Even real life Cubans would be impressed. @JoseConseco you ever try this place?
2018-05-24,4,This is a great lunch spot it's my first time here I love the bread appetizers (reminded me of Brazilian cheese bread) so yummy. We ordered the Havana club sandwich and a avocado with crab meat sandwich as it supposed to be a light lunch. The Havana club sandwich came out on a very crispy fluffy bread and it was to die for thick pieces of chicken breast and avocado made the sandwich a must, this came with a side of crunchy warm French fries. Now the avocado with the crab meat is something that if you want to feelThe beach is a must the sweet crab was a nice touch to the garlic infused avocado.
2018-05-22,5,WOW ! WOW ! WOW! l loved everything about this place ! The atmosphere was lovely/ romantic. The food was great ! i had the "Aguacate Con Cangerejo" as a starter and omgsh !! it was so addicting!For the main course I got "Mar y Tierra",  *blown away*. The combination of in this plate was so flavorful! Must try when you come here.Usually hoboken isn't my go to place for cuban cuisine, but this totally changed my perspective on that! I will definitely be back ! Oh the complimentary bread with the garlic herb, to die for !Check out my blog where I talk in depth about my best restaurant experiences, down there. :)fooddose.wordpress.com
2018-05-22,2,They repeatedly ask if you want to order more. It's actually a bit strange. Especially if you got two meals and drinks. Would not return.Update: nasty comment was left after I wrote this. Probably by an employee or the owner. When I said it was strange .. I should have wrote pushy! I was being nice when I wrote strange.  They asked after the check was asked for twice. It was like they were desperate. Was something that stood out as a customer. Clearly I would not return, after that was written as a response to my comment. This is not good service. It's called desperate. Any person that travels a lot can spot places like these!
2018-05-21,5,By far, the most authentic Cuban food. Love the small atmosphere. You are 100% treated like family. Have the ropa vieja. It's outstanding. I love the vibe with the live bands. Feels like Havana Also, their cocktails are perfect. The mojitos are one of a kind.
2018-05-16,4,Great bar, vibe & location!  Mojitos are a bit 'light.' The food is really good but the portions are a bit small.  That's probably why I'm giving it 4 though it may be a 5 - I'm glutinous!  Can't miss restaurant for friends or a date!  Highly recommended!
2018-05-14,5,Food was great but what made this an amazing experience was our servers ask for david when you come here he's an amazing server.
2018-05-06,1,Will never go to this place again. Have lived in Hoboken for over 10 years and this placed has disappointed to the point I am writing my first negative Yelp review. Went there during the day to sit outside. Lots of available tables which was great for us it wasn't busy at all. It was "happy hour" but only applied to inside which was fine, a little misleading with their advertised signs but whatever, we went with it. Ordered two glasses of wine, full price, but poured very cheaply. It was early evening so wasn't looking to eat a lot, so after the waiter brought us wine we each ordered an appetizer.  Waiter told us we had to order more. We said we didn't want more just wanted the two apps. It's not like we just got chips and salsa, the bill would have come to over $50 which they should have been ok with at 4pm considering there was only one other table there. But instead they would have preferred we leave than to accommodate.Big mistake by them. Like I said, have lived here over 10 years, know lots of people and better restaurants. Will guarantee will spread the word about the terrible service. With so many other better Cuban restaurants in town, don't even waste your time here!  Took our business to Coco Havana instead where we were treated with respect and not a cash cow.
2018-05-06,1,Went there for the food and music festival and got a perfect table outside.  Then ordered 2 glasses of wine. The wine was brought out, pretty small pours. We then were ready to order. It was 4:30 in the afternoon so just wanted appetizers. Which were $17 each. The bad waiter told us we each had to get at least 2 app's or three in total. We were not told this in the beginning nor was it on the menu. I think it's illegal to force people to order more, especially when they just ordered $50 worth of food and wine.  At some point Karma will catch up with this pretentious Hoboken restaurant and it will be closed down soon.  I'm spreading to word to all my Hoboken friends. We went to Havana's who truly appreciated our business! Too bad I can't give negative stars!Waiter's response...
2018-05-05,2,Meh. It's too bad the Host didnt like my Cuban Question. I'll pass on this one next time. Oh and you may want to serve Bacardi.
2018-05-02,4,Came in for a drink or 2 on Saturday night. Had the shrimp al ajillo and the empanadas with chicken. They were delish. Drinks were on point and service over all was really great. Manager at the front was so nice and attentive. She checked in our coats when she saw we were on a mission with them. Ambiance is very nice and trendy. Very dark and romantic feel. The only issue is the bathroom. You have to walk up a long stairway up to get there. But no big deal. Just have to be careful when going up and down after drinks. Def. coming back when I'm in town next month with the hubby. He's vegetarian so we're going to try the mushroom croquettas I saw on the menu.
2018-04-28,1,The food is great but customer service is horrendous!!!!! Came for a fun times with friends n got rushed the whole time the hostess was horrible they were not accommodating even after we said our friend was pregnant it was still a big issue....we also had a small cake at the end just to cut for our friend but decided against it because of the outrageous $3 per person fee so ridiculous i will not be returning!!!!!
2018-04-27,1,Came here with a group of 6 to eat. We were all so excited as it was highly recommended.  The service (at first) was great and the food was very good.  When they brought the bill out, we were charged $14 for sparkling water when we specifically asked for tap (and was in fact served tap water all night).  The waiter told us he would credit our account and send over a manager.  Instead of sending a manager to address this charge, he sent the bus boy over to tell us that we asked him for sparkling. Needless to say, we were never credited the amount and they continually insisted that we ordered sparkling water. The way the situation was handled was a disgrace. As good as the food was, we will never return!
2018-04-22,4,Place looks niceService was amazingFood was greatStarted off with Guacamole with lump crabmeat and plaintain chips.  Guac was a bit cold and not a lot of crabmeat but it was good. Me and my date had the skirt steak with yuca fries, salad and maduros as a side.  AMAZING! Best Skirt steak i ever had.  It was so juicy and so good.  They put a generous amount of Chimichurri.  Portion was huge.  We had a pitcher of their Sangria special.  It was also delicious and a bit strong. We were stuffed so we passed on the churros.  I highly recommend this lovely place.
2018-04-21,4,This place was very packed. I would highly recommend you make a reservation.  Great food, and probably the best paella I have ever had. It made up for the subpar service we had.  I would recommend you try this place.
2018-04-20,5,*Drinks and food was great!! *The portions are nice and big*Romantic ambiance *Great service & great value*Worth going!
2018-04-19,5,Talk about great food, atmosphere, drinks and service. This restaurant is a must go in Hoboken. If you go on the weekend, I would recommend making a reservation as this place gets busy. The selection of appetizers, specials and cocktails and drinks are plentiful. I have been there three times already and plan to be a continuous customer. The sangria is great, the appetizers from the empanadas to the tacos are tasty. The paella is full of great seafood. BUT the Mar y Tierra dinner option, IS AMAZING!! My friend and I shared and it was one of the best dishes we had in a while. Must try!! If you haven't been, get a reservation and eat here !
2018-04-13,3,Came here for the first time. Nice place and the staff was very friendly. I was going to give this place a 4 or 5 star but we were highly disappointed with the texture and the look of the oxtail. When I ordered the Rabo Encendido it was not spicy. I thought ENCENDIDO meant "Spicy???" maybe I'm missing something.I was expecting beautiful round pieces of oxtail and instead I got SOUP.I eat oxtail all the time and it's always tender and falling off the bone. The one here was off the bones alright but more like a greasy soup and very chewy. Overall we had an ok experience.
2018-04-10,4,The Good:-  The complimentary bread at first tastes sweet, dry, and a bit odd with the garlic butter. However, after a while, you cannot get enough of it! We kept ordering more, they couldn't bring it out fast enough and when they're freshly made and warm, they're amazing.-  The octopus appetizer was some of the best I have ever had - very good, very tender, perfection.-  Amazingly friendly staff. Our servers were always quick to please and made sure our water cups were full. They always checked in on us but without being excessive. The Okay: -  The paella I ordered was okay. Not the best I've had but huge and very filling. The seafood was a bit dry and there were definitely more mussels than anything else. The bay scallops were the small type (I prefer the larger scallops). But again, very very filling for what you paid for. Many of us brought home half our meals.-  The whole party had to be there before they could seat us. Thankfully we all arrived relatively on time! The Bad:-  It is quite loud inside to the point I felt like I was screaming at my friends. -  Very dark inside so it is a tad difficult to read the menu - definitely made me feel old until I saw everyone else also whipping out the flashlight app to read. All in all, a good spot! I'd definitely return. The few bad points do not outweigh the food. My paella may not have been the best but I'd go again and try something different off the menu in a heartbeat.
2018-04-09,5,The Cuban Restaurant and Bar is the perfect Cuban restaurant. On a Saturday evening with a crowd of ten, my family and I were not only blown away by the amazing service,but also the delicious authentic Cuban food. If you have ever been to the area, you know how packed Hoboken can get on a Saturday night. Although it was a packed house, our waiters did an amazing job making sure that everything was on point. Fast and efficient service all throughout the night.Our meals were perfect all around. I ordered the churrasco with rice and a side salad and WOW was I blown away not only with the portion size, but the authenticity and flavor. Grilled skirt steak, Cuban yuca fries, watercress salad, chimichurri, cuban rice.DELICIOUS. The drinks are equally as good. Mojitos, sangria and piña coladas were ordered.
2018-04-02,5,The Cuban is easily my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.There are a number of similar places between Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken, but The Cuban tops them all.Happy Hour. To start your night the proper way, the happy hour menu has a laundry list of things that are $5. No, not just a few beers and some well drinks; legitimately their entire (or close to it) drink menu has everything priced at $5. Tonight I had the cuban version of a long island iced tea, which is just as strong as you'd think. Served with a thimble-sized about of coke in it, i'm pretty sure it was 98% alcohol. I also had a $5 mojito at 6:59pm (happy hour ends at 7, but on Mondays, classic mojitos are $5 all night) and a red sangria towards the end of dinner.On a mojito scale of 1-10, these come in at a solid 8. Not too sweet, nice and minty, and plenty strong. Any of the flavored ones will add some extra sugar, so if you want to go that route, the mango mojito is a great choice.Now that you're basically almost drunk, grab your table and put in a few apps. The guac is really good - not as good as the classic version you'd get in a Mexican restaurant, but the crabmeat on top is excellent and the plantain chips add just a little bit of extra salt, which works well. I would also recommend the tamal en hoja, camarones al ajillo, and empanaditas. Order another mojito, and thank your waiter or waitress feverishly for bringing over the rolls and butter to help soak up some of your happy hour. The rolls are tiny, but don't let that fool you, they are so dense and chewy (and delicious) that you need to be careful not to fill up on them before your main dish comes......Because now it's time for...EL CLASSICO. Every time I come here, I get it. Every time I come here, I say, ehhh, i'll get something different, broaden my horizons. Every time I come here, I pick something else. Every time I come here, I can't help but order El Classico. The pork falls off the bone, the yucca is swimming in garlic, the moro rice is one of my favorites, and the plantains are the sweetness that helps create that perfect bite. I love anything pickled, and while they are a very small part of the dish, the pickled red onions add the perfect amount of acidity to balance the whole dish out. Even thought I always get that, I have tasted other things -- the churrasco, the oxtail, bronzino, and ropa vieja. Everything is always excellent, so get whatever sounds good to you. But given I wrote a giant paragraph about it, consider El Classico if it at all appeals. Dessert? Bread pudding and churros. The BP is just the right amount of chocolatey without being overbearing, and the churros...stuffed with chocolate...yeah I don't have to say much more than that. The only slightly not five star thing is the reservation system - they aren't on OpenTable and you need to request a reservation online (or...gasp...call them), but those requests are generally confirmed the same day, so it's not a big deal.
2018-04-01,5,Great authentic Cuban food! Fresh tasting and delicious ! Have the Cuban guacamole lump crabmeat and plantain chips ! So good !
2018-03-27,1,The manager was yelling at staff when we arrived, which was not a good start. When we sat down, we asked about Happy Hour and were told "that's only at the bar, you shouldn't have sat down if you wanted those prices."  Okay, the menu looked awesome, so we just ignored that and ordered a pitcher of sangria and 6 appetizers and 2 sides for 4 people.  The waiter said, "What else are you going to order?" We said we weren't sure yet, and we're told we had to make a complete order or he would not put in the apps. We said we were not sure what we wanted and were still deciding. He told us we had not yet reached "the minimum order" and needed to order more. This led to a minor breakdown where the manager came by to tell us that ordering separately was "too stressful" for the kitchen (in a nearly empty restaurant).  Anyway, the fact that I was entertaining kept me from just leaving. So, summary: food was okay, but not worth the price. Service destroyed the experience. Overall, run. There are many Cuban and Spanish restaurants within a couple miles that can create the experience you should expect. Never again.
2018-03-23,4,Nice place, menu is really rich and staff friendly. We ordered a pork belly as appetizer and it was delicious!!! For main dishes we ordered paella valenciana, which was very rich in clams and seafood, vaca frita, boliche and fish of the day. All very well made and in huge portions!Nice place to eat Cuban food.There are also live music at nights. Singers are very very good.
2018-03-20,4,Came here twice. First time for their half price happy hour with a friend. Both drink and food were quite good and cheap, too.Second time I brought my parents to try the 3 courses $31 prefix dinner. It's okay. A lot of food but my parents from China didn't really get used to Cuban food. Plus, we sit next to restroom and they used too much cleaner and it smell so bad. Second time wasn't really a pleasant experience.
2018-03-20,5,Had a great dinner with the family last nite to welcome our son for a quick visit East from LA. We were all very taken with what we got at the Cuban. Attentive staff, a great waiter (thanks David), nice vibe, and really great food! We were especially impressed with the Churrasco, the Ropa Vieja, the avocado salad, desert flan  and tres leche- each one more sinful than the other.  The Cuban mojito was spot on as well. We now have a good reason to stop in Hoboken rather than tunnel into nyc
2018-03-19,5,We had a reservation for Brunch on a Sunday. While waiting for our whole group, we sat at the bar and had some great drinks ($5 cocktails, yes please!). The bartender was great and really attentive. We were sat in the back room for brunch. Our server was great, really attentive. It wasn't really crowded at all, which was surprising to me. Everything we ordered was delicious! They also had live music, which was really good. I'd definitely recommend this place for brunch.
2018-03-15,1,Amazing food. Fantastic Sangria. Even the service was great. I don't normally give one star reviews but the interaction with the manager and the numerous restaurant rules absolutely baffled me. We arrived for the start of happy hour for our reservation and were told we were not allowed to order happy hour drinks from our table and that, as we had already sat down, the bar was off limits to us. Alright. We proceeded to order one appetizer per person as well as two sides and two appetizers for the table and were told that it would all have to be on one cheque so we had to place orders for our entrees at the same time. We hadn't decided what we wanted and asked that the appetizers be made as we decided and said that we would continue to order more when we were told that there was a two-per-person minimum on appetizers! At this point I asked to speak to the manager who was rude and simply reinforced the rules. It was a marvel to me that anyone eats there at all while subject to such a ridiculous dining experience. Every time we tried to order anything, there was a new rule that we didn't know about it. Although the food was great, I'll be looking for other places to get my cuban fix as the manager was absolutely awful.
2018-03-13,5,I came with my boyfriend for our anniversary. We sat in the front which became a little crowded. Make sure if you're coming for dinner that you go before 9 as it does get a little loud and make sure it a reservation. The food is amazing. Tres Leches for dessert is a must!
2018-03-11,4,We came for dinner and a live band was finishing up their set. It was nice to hear for a little. When we were seated we had 4 different waiters come around our table throughout our dinner which I thought was strange but at least we were being helped. The food was pretty impressive ! The guacamole and crab meat appetizer was delicious and went well with the fried plantains. I had el classico as my entree and my god how good! The pork fell right off the bone. I will definitely be coming back !
2018-03-06,5,Came here looking for a place to have dinner on a tuesday night and was not disappointed. Found it on yelp and went in for the reviews. Although it's a little pricey, it is worth it. We had the "ropa vieja," "salmon," and the "camarones al ajillo." The food was amazing, especially the bread they give you at the beginning. Gave us water and kept our glass full, and we had the passion fruit mojito.The place is really elegant and the atmosphere is so relaxing. Nice music, and great service. Will definitely return!
2018-02-19,3,My husband and I went here for dinner. The service was great, and we loved the decor and ambiance. We had the Cesar salad to start. It was delicious! The grilled lettuce added a nice flavor. We also had the Brazilian sangria which was very tasty (and strong). My husband had the hanger steak for his entree. He loved it and said it was cooked perfectly. The steak was supposed to come with shrimp, but the restaurant ran out so they gave him a cold crab salad as a substitute which he wasn't a fan of (the cold crab salad didn't compliment the steak). I had the oxtail as my entree. The oxtail was super tough and chewy.  I eat oxtail all the time and it's always tender and falling off the bone--the one here wasn't. Overall we had a good experience, and would go back, but we were highly disappointed with the texture of the oxtail and the restaurant running out of shrimp.
2018-02-11,4,Seesh! Looking for a restaurant to wine and dine that special someone? Look NO further than The Cuban! We had a reservation @ 5:30 for a party of 4. Although we were upset with the timing (next available 9PM) we were blow away with the service, food, and ambiance. Upon walking in we were greeted by a VERY busy hostess who sat us right away. The entire restaurant is large and in charge. The bar in the front of the house was a little rowdy, but we had a table in the back room that was very quaint. Service: A-. Attention to detail on all levels. However, I felt it odd when I asked one of the bussers what the white sauce was for our paella she said "I know nothing about the food." Kind of odd response. Food: A+. Flavor was out of bounds and it started with the crab/avocado dip with plantain chips! Wow. These were the definition of LIT. The other couple ordered the skirt steak that was big enough for two! We ordered the seafood paella. This was easily shared by two, and I wouldn't recommend ordered anything else. The seafood was fresh and the rice was cooked to perfection. I highly recommend the paella for 1st times to The Cuban. Bathroom: Up 3+ flights of stairs?! I may be a young stud, but how is this even a thing? Overall, we will be back! The price makes it a special occasion type joint, but we might have a few of those coming down the road.
2018-02-03,3,Ordered pulpo, double cooked steak, and quinoa stir fry. Very average. I think this is a low 4 star or high 3 star restaurant. Very expensive for the quality and overrated. Courses are plated nicely but that's pretty much it.
2018-02-02,4,This place is huge! So many different rooms and floors and each kind of has a different vibe. Unfortunately we were put into a room that had 2 large groups so it was really really loud. We were the only couple and we moved our seats into the corner to at least try to be able to hear each other. This kind of ruined the atmosphere for us. However the food was great. We had the steak and it was made perfectly. Sauce and sides were also lovely. I would come back for the cuban food but try to ask for a seat in a quiter spot.
2018-01-30,4,I have to admit . I am partial to Cuban food . Took my son her for his 30 th birthday dinner . I Haven't been to Hoboken since the 90s !!!  But this is his favorite place . Apple doesn't fall far from the tree . Food was excellent. Ropa vieja , El Classico , flank steak , all good. The tres leche , churros . The sangrias , all good ! Service excellent . If the Hoboken parking wasn't so bad , I'd def go again . We went on a Tuesday in the dead of winter that's the only reason we found parking, and it was a blue moon . Now I remembered why I haven't been back in 25 years .
2018-01-29,5,I was in Hoboken visiting a friend and came upon The Cuban by chance. What a delightful surprise it was to dine here on a quiet Monday night. The staff was friendly and incredibly accommodating. José was eager to serve and was very helpful. I ending up starting my meal with the Aguacate y Tomate (Avocado & Tomato) which was very fresh and tangy. For my main course I had the Pollo Criollo (Creole Chicken) and it did not disappoint. The half chicken was deboned and cooked to perfection and  served over creole fried rice with maduros. I finished this stellar evening with my favorite dessert of all time: Tres Leches(three milk cake;) it was heaven! Velvety smooth sponge cake with sweet condensed milk and topped with fresh chantillí crema. I highly recommend The Cuban for an evening of casual fine dining.
2018-01-24,5,I went out on a 2nd date and chose this restaurant. Holy crap!! This place is beautiful, passionate, and amazing. This place really is awesome. We were seated in the back on the 2nd fl. The atmosphere was truly breath taking. The food is beyond words. Our runner, who I think his name was Mel was amazing. He answered all our questions about the food, which plates would be better for that night, and anything else we wanted to try out. I had a medium rare steak which was out of this world!! The passion fruit sangria that was recommended by our waitress, Samantha was on point. The dessert was the best way to end the night. Chocolate filled churros! Aside from leaving the restaurant at 1am because the date, along with the food and drinks were too good to pass up, I'll Def be sure to stop by again! Our waitress was amazing and made the experience well worth it. We were even greeted by the manager Andres. He made sure everything was running smoothly and was just so upbeat, kind, and so helpful. Everyone should really come eat and drink here. Whether it's for a date, a hangout spot for the night, or to simply enjoy the food. Everything about this place is worth the money!
2018-01-21,1,Disappointing.  The host, who clearly does not understand the Hoboken demographic, led us to leave and go to another restaurant.  We intentionally made a 5:30pm reservation, as we live a block away and wanted to bring our infant (who was asleep).  The place was totally empty, and he acted like we wanted to bring a bomb and/or a crocodile into a packed dining room at prime time.  The Cuban at 5:30pm is not Del Posto at 8:00pm.  Don't act as if you are!!!Early time.  Empty restaurant.  Hoboken (EVERYONE has young children).  Know your customer base, guys.
2018-01-18,5,Normally I do not experiment with this cuisine but decided to give it a try.  The hostess was very pleasant and could see us scoping out other tables dishes to see what everyone else was eating. We were torn between the paella and the ox tail dish.   She stated that the number one "Churasco" skirt steak dish is first for a reason.  It was her favorite too. Normally I would never order a skirt steak, I've always thought it to be a cheaper, low quality steak.   Wrong.  It was honestly one of the juiciest steaks I have ever had.  That plus the chimichari sauce was delicious.  I will be back for sure, 100%.
2018-01-17,4,Simply love this place. Waiter ordered for me, including wine...excellent choices. Steak cooked perfectly and sides were a good compliment. Background music made me want to bounce, but not loud. Staff helpful with right amount of attention. Atmosphere is relaxing. Nice job.
2018-01-15,4,This place was really beyond my expectation. I ordered Cuban guac and it's very tasty.Will come back and try seafood next time.
2018-01-09,5,Absolutely amazing! Food was delicious and service was good and attentive. Definitely coming back whenever I find myself in town
2018-01-07,2,I want to preface this review with the fact that I used to spend over 80 hours a week for over 2 years straight running Brooklyn's #1 reviewed and best Latin Fusion spot around, Bogota Latin Bistro.My wife and I were super excited to checkout Hoboken's highest and most frequently reviewed Latin spot. The overall vibe, environment and service is absolutely top notch at this place. David served us at a hightop next to the bar. He was really attentive, knowledgable and nice. The runners, bussers and host were all fantastic. Drinks-Brazilian Sangria- Fine. White Sangria- Hit the table completely clear. I am pretty sure the bartender forgot to add a crucial ingredient here. It didn't contain any fruit juice whatsoever. Was straight booze and water. Appetizers-  Croquetas de Hongo- Without the truffle aioli this dish would have been awful. The croquetes tasted as if though they were frozen. The filling was very much lacking in overall flavor. Tomato and Avocado Salad- The tomatoes and avocado were completely ''pasados'' (old - sitting in the walk in a day too long). The dressing definitely lacked flavor. This dish could have popped with ripe ingredients and proper seasoning. Something usually very hard to mess up. Entrees-Paella- Was super excited about this, but again it was totally lack luster. The rice was completely undercooked and the dish lacked any real flavor. Totally under seasoned. Quinoa Entree- Also utterly under seasoned. Owners- Your sous chef/ expeditors running the show in the kitchen this evening really dropped the ball. Based on your reviews- I'm sure this was just an off night for the kitchen and bar. I totally understand that it happens, but I unfortunately you lost a few new locals that dine out at least 2-3 times a week.
2018-01-06,1,The worse dinner experience I ever had.  We had a bunch of girls next to us who were so loud and the manager told them once and only once. We couldn't enjoy ourselves at all. They tried 2 bribe us with a discount. The discount was only $13. We didn't want the discount. We wanted them to know how to control their customers. Make sure everyone is happy.
2018-01-06,5,Whoa! My husband and I lobbed in on a Saturday evening with no reservations. We were offered a seat at the bar which was absolutely ok by us as we were dressed for a brutal winter and not a posh night out...Food - wonderful. We had a selection of small plates - bacon-wrapped plantains, bacalao (salted cod), pork belly and fried chicken in doughy wraps. Delicious.The mojito was lethal, and my husband's Mahou beer was just what he wanted on a cold night out. The service was attentive, and pretty reliable given how busy it was getting as we were ready to leave.  We'll be back.
2018-01-06,5,The food is amazing! I came here for my shift holiday Christmas party and they gave us a great deal. The aura of the restaurant truly has a great Cuban feel to it. If you and your significant other need date night plans and don't mind spending a bit of money then this is the perfect place to come to. The mixed drink selection is great as well. I would def come back again either with a group or date night.
2018-01-03,5,If you're going to be in the Hoboken area, you must visit this restaurant.  I had dinner here with some friends and let me tell you. We had an amazing time.  Food was delicious, drinks were just perfect and the service on point. Best Cuban restaurant in Hoboken.
2018-01-03,4,Went here after going to Havana near the path which had great appetizers , service and drinks!With that said:Service :I was shocked that our waiter was a jerk but the environment , strong drink and food, really saved the night . But for the prices and environment they really should have a great waiting staff because that's as much a part of the restaurant as the food... Food : We ordered the Guacamole with crab which was okay but I wouldn't order again . They put very little crab meat and it really doesn't change the flavor  and for $17 for it to just taste like regular guacamole in my opinion is a waste unless you are having a serious craving for guacamole .Another surprise was that the Pollo Criollo ($22) dish was so much better than the Mar y Tierra ($29) dish and I really don't like chicken . Maybe it was the rice ? Not sure but it was like the best dish of the night but everything came out to about $90 for all three dishes and 1 drink.
2018-01-03,5,My boyfriend made reservations for my birthday at The Cuban since we've walked past this restaurant many times on the way to the Path. Upon walking in, we were greeted by the host, who walked us to the second floor to our table. When you first look in, you wouldn't expect that there are more tables around the back and on the second floor!The food was amazing. The table bread comes with a garlic herb butter, which was delicious. We ordered a half pitcher of the Brazilian sangria, which had guava, lemon, strawberry and a few other fruits in it. The half pitcher was perfect for each of us to have a glass and a half each. We started our evening with their calamari, which was their special for the night. The spicy aioli that it came with was great and paired well with the saltiness of the calamari breading.For our entrees, I ordered the ropa vieja and my boyfriend ordered their pollo criollo. They were both so flavorful. My boyfriend surprised me with dessert and a birthday candle on the plate, which he told me he mentioned when he made the reservation. The waiter was very attentive throughout the whole night. I would highly recommend The Cuban for an intimate and delicious dining experience!
2018-01-01,4,If you are here please get the vaca frita. That's by far my favorite entree and as appetizers the octopus and the crab guacamole. The drinks here for me are not the best I had a caipirinha. I'm not a mojito type of gal but their sangria is good. The service was great. They closed by 10:30 and since we were still ordering eating and drinking they did not rush us out or put any pressure on us. We were having a celebratory dinner just a group of 4. I do recommend coming here the ambiance is super nice and the place is a lot bigger then what u think. The bathroom does seem like a bit of a hike, so careful if your drinking there are stairs involved.
2017-12-28,5,Went to The Cuban for a get together with friends on a weeknight and had a great time. We made a late reservation for 7 and there was no problem at all. I'm Cuban so am always hesitant to go to Cuban restaurants, but this really reminded me of my grandmothers authentic Cuban meals I still get to enjoy. Our server Frank was professional, welcoming and was able to quickly answer any questions we had about the menu. Even more so, I don't think our water or sangria glasses were empty for a second throughout the entire meal. The appetizers and entrees did not disappoint; I had the Vaca Frita for my entree (per Frank's suggestion) which was cooked perfectly and left just enough room for the dessert flan which, again, was very tasty. Highly recommend for a group dinner or date as the ambiance and atmosphere are authentic, food and service are on point and will be back for sure!
2017-12-27,5,I came here the other day for a family get together and the experience was amazing.  We had a great time.  This is our first time dining at this restaurant and everything was perfect.  We made a reservation before we got there because reviews said that they get packed quickly and we were seated immediately when we walked in.  We will definitely be back at least once a month!
2017-12-18,5,Food is very very good.  Haven't had anything I didn't like from the dinner or brunch menu.  If you're having a celebratory dinner and have a very large group I recommend the pig roast.
2017-12-16,5,This was my first time eating here and it was absolutely delicious. Be sure to start with the guacamole with crab meat - very tasty. I had the skirt steak with rice and beans and it was also great. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in the area.
2017-12-13,5,Went there for the first time recently and I was VERY pleasantly surprised! The drinks are amazing and after demolishing a couple different apps, our entrees were even better. Definitely want to go back when they have the band playing - looks awesome!
2017-12-09,5,Good place for hang out with friends on Friday night! Absolutely they provide many kind of cocktail and great dishes
2017-12-09,4,Great authentic Cuban food. Awesome customer service. The only con is that the bathroom is on the third floor and for someone lazy like me it wasn't ideal lol. But all in all a great local spot and definitely worth visiting.
2017-12-08,5,This was my second time eating here and the first time I saw the back floors of the restaurant.  It's so much bigger, very interesting layout, I thought it was only the front room! Anyway the host and servers were completely friendly and professional, very nice people.  There was live music that was really very pleasant and not uncomfortable or weird (I'm not always a fan of live music when eating but it worked perfectly here.)The food was fabulous!  Everything tasted amazing. I'm pescatarian and had the shrimp and scallop dish which was so delicious with some beautiful green cilantro rice that I wish I could make at home.  My husband enjoyed his steak dish and we shared very tasty mussels and octopus apppetizers.It was a great experience and we will certainly come back again.
2017-12-05,5,Loved the food here. We ate skirt steak, octopus, meatballs, paella and roasted chicken and everything was great. Tres leche cake and churros were awesome too. Very good service and nice atmosphere. A totally great experience.
2017-12-03,5,May your restaruant have a good future and I will come for happy time. This restuarant is really great, I highly recommend to you!
2017-12-02,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken. Great food, great ambience. Can be romantic, can be a place for big parties. Highly recommend!
2017-11-21,5,The service was excellent and our wait staff was so on top of us and extremely attentive. I've never been happy to give a tip like I was that day. The fixed price menu was delightful and the portions were perfect. $32 Monday - Friday from 5pm - 7pm I think it is and it was exactly the quality & quantity of food I was looking for
2017-11-18,5,Came here for a special occasion (girlfriends birthday). I made reservation in advance and I am sure glad I did, this place gets pretty packed. We were approached right away and our drink and food orders taken attentively. We stared with some mojitos, and boy were they strong! They were good but pretty strong! I am surprised I was able to a second one honestly. We wanted to try out an appetizer and was recommended by our waiter (Frank) to go with the octopus. Good choice Frank! We enjoyed the octopus.My girlfriend tried the churrasco steak and I decided to go with the ropa vieja. Both orders were delicious and the rice/beans and tostones that we had as side orders complemented it well! Lastly we were feeling something sweet so we went with the flan. The flan was really really good, the consistency and flavor was on point (kudos to them)!Overall we had a great time, both service and the food was beyond expectations in my opinion. The prices were high, but I will be back for special occasions.
2017-11-11,2,We came on a double date, and we were told 45 minutes until we could be seated. We decided to get drinks at the bar. The bartenders were very friendly, and the sangria was delicious. Also, they accommodated my friend by making a margarita off menu. However, after repeatedly asking the maitre'd when we would be seated, we still were waiting after over an hour and a half! Next time, provide a realistic wait time, and don't mislead your customers.
2017-11-07,5,Got the churrasco, great decision. Medium (perfect). Brazilian sangria was delicious too
2017-11-04,5,Great to find such a nice local restaurant. Went for brunch two weekends in a row! First time got two special app, raw salmon and butternut squash soup which are great! I got half a chicken for entree and knew I will be back again! The second time I got sth fried for app and chicken breast with yuca mash for entree and knew I will come for the third time! The dessert is stuffed with guava jam and cream cheese which is warm and with ice cream on the side. It is amazing!
2017-10-27,5,Amazing authentic Cuban Food with exceptional service. Also, offering many Gluten Free options. Cozy atmosphere with a great bar
2017-10-26,4,Minus 1 only because the prices are pretty big and the portions can be small. But the quality of food is pretty close to the real thing and seasoning wise they are doing good things in the kitchen. Wish this place had better service especially when they are packed to the brim since some servers do not cover other tables so you have to wait for your own server and it can take a while in all the bustle. But this place is a great date occasion spot- larger groups might have a tight squeeze. Intimate decor inside and Their drinks are pretty strong. Good dinner spot in Hobo.
2017-10-19,4,Sooooo one of my faves spots to eat , I first found this spot searching for delicious oxtail they use to offer this bone off but I've recently been in the last few weeks and it's now bone on and it honestly adds extra flavor... I lover the complimentary bread and also the guava and passion fruit mojitos yummmmm TRY IT
2017-10-18,4,Tasty and hearty Cuban food in the area.We stopped by with a reservation for four on a Saturday afternoon, and we split a ceviche and mussels to start, the former of which was quite refreshing and the mussels pretty large portion-wise, along with a ton of fries. For my entree, I had oxtail dish, which was prepared quite well with the meat very tender, and the dishes overall were quite well flavored. It's not a terribly expensive meal, and it's a good place for a low key meal for smaller to medium sized groups in the area.
2017-10-15,4,Stopped in on a Saturday night around 7ish and sat at the bar since we didn't feel like waiting 45 minutes for a table.The bar is full service including the menu.   The interior is much larger than it seems.  The first floor you see with a half a dozen tables isn't the entire place.In the back is like stepping into narnia. There's an additional first floor dining area and a split floor with more. There's also a second floor. The bathrooms are on the third floor. The paella I order was decent, not a lot of saffron was used. There was a good amount of rice and some seafood. The other dish was the marinated churrasco, flavorful and cooked to the liking.The highlight of my weekend were the yuca rolls, freaking legit. They come out hot and fresh, slightly harden on the outside and moist and chewy inside.  It's served with garlic butter. Whaaaaaaat! We had to order seconds it was that goodThe entrees were accompanied by caipirinha.  Decent. Overall I would go back to this place for other foods and especially the yuca rolls
2017-10-14,5,I was here for a Sunday brunch. We wanted to go some place else but ended up here and damn what luck.They had a Cuban cuisine inspired brunch menu. I got the classic Cuban sandwich which was awesome and the sangria, which was on point as well. But it was the live in house band which apparently plays every Tuesday, Wednesday and Sunday which was a game changer. It felt like I was chilling on a beach and not just having a brunch at one of the many brunch places. I'll be back !!
2017-10-08,4,Good place for drinks , appetizers,dinner and even desserts.  Nice atmosphere, with Spanish (salsa music ) playing ~~perfect as is a Cuban spot.  I have visited three times and cannot complain about any of my visits.  Like any place in Hoboken biggest downfall location.  Don't visit more often because I hate Hoboken....
2017-10-08,5,This place was BEYOND amazing. The food the service the knowledge of gluten free options. Their bread is gluten free, it's made with a tapioca flour. I had the quinoa with vegetables it's like a healthy version of risotto. My drink was good and our party loved every dish sorry no leftovers this time. Cannot wait to go back for more. This place will not disappoint!
2017-09-29,2,Seems like a nice place at first, different parts of the restaurant cater to each mood, tables just bit too close to one another, like I'm having dinner with strangers, food is just ok, drinks r creative sorta but not impressive, mostly ice, coconut ice cream was good and the guac,
2017-09-22,5,Had a GREAT experience at The Cuban!  The service was awesome, the waiter was extremely knowledgable of the menu and his recommendations were amazing!  We shared the Pulpo and Antojitos to start and split the Hanger Steak for our main dish.  The Spanish style Sangria was also great.The live music added a nice touch to the ambience.I will no doubt be back here again soon!
2017-09-19,4,I was there one time it was really cozy.  The mixed drinks were good and they had live music when i was there.  The one complaint i have, and its something that can't be changed, is the location of the bathroom.  Had to climb stairs to get to it.Other than that i had a good time there and would go again.
2017-09-18,2,The food is okay. I have had better cuisine at a Cuban restaurant. He steak has no seasoning at all but pricey. The chicken empanadas was great and so was the small bread that they only give you three of them for 2 people to share. I won't be coming back and the Sangria was awful half is $16 not worth it at all.
2017-09-13,4,Very nice and quaint place. The red sangria was tasty. The appetizer avocado with crab meat and fried plantains chips was different. I do recommend it for a appetizer.  Desert pastry stuff with guava and cheese with a scoop of ice cream
2017-09-13,4,I've been here a bunch of times now. I've had brunch, dinner, and just sat at the bar. It's always a good experience. The food is delicious...vaca frita, ropa vieja, the pressed bread. Drinks are yummy too!
2017-09-10,1,NEVER AGAIN WILL I RETURN, quick to the point, strike .1 hostess said "we needed reservations" when there where empty tables (1st time we attempted to dine here)Strike. 2,  4 of us sat at a table, ordered drinks and started to order apps, when all of sudden we where informed that we had to order an Entre in order to sit at a table and the restaurant was pretty empty.  We all looked at each other and asked for the check and left. How ridiculous is that when the check would have been much more had we ordered apps and definitely more drinks.  "The Cuban" take note,Keep customers happy and they will return, make them unhappy & word travels fast and less business leads to closed doors.
2017-09-09,1,Just left this place and am beyond disappointed!!! It looked great and attractive from the outside, but don't be FOOLED.  Upon taking initiative to sit ourselves as we had an appetite and they manager just waved at us, we ordered 4 appetizers and 3 drinks. After the drinks were served we were informed that in order to stay at our table we STILL had to order an entree. The restaurants was nearly empty!!! What kind of restaurant turns down current service and future business!?!? We were practically  forced to leave the restaurant after our utensils were removed from our table. We will never return to this place. BTW I still tipped the waiter 20% for the drinks because I knew it was not his fault. I observed how he asked his manager for help, but he did not seem to care. I blame the shady manager at the door, who never checked up on us nor cared that we walked out. He was too busy socializing as the four of us walked away. It's easy to greet people at the door and direct customers, but not so easy to take care of your customers.....
2017-09-09,3,I brought my friend for her birthday. I baked her a cake and I was charged $3 for ever slice ? I thought that was rude. And their menu didn't have a big selection
2017-09-06,3,This restaurant is located in Hoboken so finding parking is a difficult task. The place is well decorated but a more ethnic decor would be better. The service was ok but nothing off the charts, and to our waiters advice we ordered the $35.00 menu which included a appetizer, main dish and a dessert. He informed us that the size portions are the same as if we ordered each plate separately, the appetizers came first and they were bite sizes, the main course came in and it was bite size as well. I prefer to be told the honest truth so I can make the correct decision. That day they had a special appetizer that was a fish ceviche with mango, jalapeño, orange and lime juice. That plate was delicious but that was an extra appetizer and I thought he had cancelled since he suggested the $35.00 deal. The food is above average but not for the price that this place charges.
2017-09-06,5,The food was excellent but the service, it was better than the food.  Just the right amount of attention. The Cuban guacamole is a must!!!! The skirt steak was cooked medium rare as requested perfection!!
2017-09-05,5,I highly recommend this restaurant. It is one of the best Cuban-Gourmet cousin I had ever had. Service was EXCELLENT!  You can notice that the waiters are very well trained. They are very aware of your table, clean it regularly and take plates out of the way as soon as you finish. I usually have this type of service in 5 stars restaurants. I dropped my knife twice and the waiter (Andrés) replaced it twice without me having to called him for help!! I really got impressed. In addition to that the food is incredible good. You cannot mis eating in this restaurant if you are in Hoboken, New Jersey, or even New York!
2017-09-04,4,Great place for Cuban food in Hoboken. Service was excellent and great food. $32 per person for appetizer, entree and dessert. Can't beat this deal. Four (4) stats because the bathroom are located two flights of stairs up. Highly recommend to order the churrasco. Will definitely comeback again.
2017-09-03,5,We came here for a date night- didn't know about the men's dress code so we're kind of taken back, but they had extra shirts to lend my boyfriend. Once we were inside it was all worth it. The ambience was amazing, the food was fantastic, and the drinks were strong and smooth. We got empanadas, french fries and ceviche. It. Was. Amazing. I don't live on the east coast anymore but I will definitely come back here when I visit.
2017-09-02,4,It was raining we didn't know where to go to have dinner we ran into The Cuban quickly with two coffees in our hands. We were greeted and sat quickly, well I understand they don't want outside beverages in the restaurant but the hostess di dnt have to swoop down on us like we were carrying something dangerous. We were soaked from the rain needed to catch our breath. Need a better approach next time no need to come over to the table and make us feel uncomfortable for bringing coffee in. Ok rant over dinner was superb. Sangria delicious. Churros outstanding and to really top the night off they mixed up our bill gave us someone else's.
2017-08-30,5,THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!  Nothing about this place should change. Service is incredible. And the food is legit so good! Def coming back! I even wrote the review at the table bc it was that good
2017-08-26,5,I came here with a large group, about 25 of us on a Wednesday night. We sat upstairs and ordered everything to share. There were more than a few rounds of delicious pictures of Sangria and various Rum drinks enjoyed as well. I was surprised at how busy the entire place was for a cold Wednesday night. This place must get crazy on the weekends. The service was impeccable and everything about the experience was wonderful. I will have to go back sometime on my own to see what the solo experience is like.
2017-08-26,5,First visit...and decided to go with the Happy Hour menu (at the bar). The bartender Albert is theeee best! Highly recommend the "Caipirinha" from the Happy Hour menu. Also...highly recommend the "Empanaditas de Pollo" along with the tostones (side menu). Str8 lit after an hour @ this spot (Saturday afternoon @ 3).
2017-08-26,4,The first time I ever had dinner in Hoboken, I thought we were doomed to finding really good food. Having just moved to Newport, my boyfriend and I never really went to Hoboken for dinner, in fear that the food would be subpar. I was pleasantly surprised when he had made reservations here last month when we had a craving for some Spanish food. Being Latina myself, I'm very picky when it comes to my rice, beans and especially tostones. And let me tell you - the Cuban Restaurant does. not. disappoint.Granted, there aren't many vegetarian options, so when I come here I have to get some sort of fish dish (even though I'm truly satisfied just getting rice and beans, but their black means are just meh). The necessary staples: Salmon Ceviche (with avocado, mango and jalapeño), Brazilian Sangria, and the tostones with mojo sauce. Yes, they come with chimichurri, but just tell them you don't want it and get the mojo on the side. It is to DIE FOR. I always ask for extra when I pack up my leftovers cause, well, I'm sure my fellow latinos will understand. Everyone I've visited with so far has thoroughly enjoyed their meals, so I'd say it's a must for Cuban in Hoboken. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because last night we made a reservation for 9 pm (which means..we're hungry) and we weren't seated until 9:30 pm. We didn't get much sympathy from the host who behaved in a slightly condescending manner and just told us they were running late. Well, I guess they know their mojo sauce will just keep people coming back for more.
2017-08-21,1,This place is not at all kid friendly. My family and I went for brunch the other day and had to leave as they would not allow my son's stroller inside, despite the fact that he was sleeping in it and the inside of the dining room was COMPLETELY empty with no other patrons. Literally not one other table was being used.  We left -- to anyone with children, save yourself the time.  There are so many great, kid friendly restaurants (La Isla, City Bistro, Halifax, etc to name a few).
2017-08-17,5,There was a wait at this place on a Saturday night and we got seated at the high top tables which was can be quite tight. The octopus was delicious and the salmon was amazing. I usually don't order salmon because I eat it so often but I was really happy about my pick!
2017-08-06,3,I was very disappointed with the food here. I chose this restaurant based on the reviews but the food was very underwhelming. The shrimp in garlic sauce appetizer was delicious and so were the drinks but that's it. I had the ropa vieja and did not like it. My dish had more gravy and barely any meat, it was very bland and the rice had too much water in it. I also thought that the beans lacked any flavor and tasted like they came straight from the can. I don't know if it was just this particular dish but maybe I will give them another try with a different entrée.
2017-08-02,5,My favorite place to eat in all of Hoboken!  I have been here for Happy Hour, Brunch, Lunch and Dinner - all have exceeded my expectations.  The happy hour specials at the bar are the best in town, the small plate tapas are delicious and well priced and the cocktails are GREAT and only $5 during happy hour.  Everything on the menu is flavorful, but the guacamole with crab (served with plantain chips) and the ceviche are some of my favorite appetizers.  The seafood in all the dishes I have had is beyond fresh.  Nice for a romantic date or dinner/happy hour/brunch with friends.  Every time I have friends visit I take them here.
2017-08-02,5,Five stars? You bet. Having visited numerous times now, my husband and I have never been disappointed with The Cuban. Great food quality, excellent flavors, and stellar service from the staff (not to mention awesome Mojitos and cocktails from the bar), this is now our go-to place for a date night trip when the kiddos are with their Nonnes.Starters:-Croquetas de Jamón, these delightful little fritters have a light crisp exterior that will make you wonder how they held up so well, it seems so delicate. It was difficult to share with my husband.-Bread baskets are brought in for your meal accompanied by a great garlic butter. These dinner rolls are stuffed with cheese before baking, resulting in a chewy inside and crisp crust. Not a favorite of my husband, but I find them delicious. No sharing? Win for meMain course:-Vaca Frita, one of my favorite Cuban dishes, and this place does it right. Crispy and somehow still juicy, make sure you ask for extra limes to get that flavor just right.-El Classico, my husband had tears in his eyes thinking of his sweet abuela's delicious cooking when he ate this dish.-Rabo Encendido, this was devoured recently before I could get a taste, but he enjoyed the spice and bacon-sweet plantain mash.   Entrees come with bottomless bowl of black beans to share.Sides:-I love their tostones. Crispy and a little bit of heat, these babies are awesome. Maduros are also excellent. If you love platano (who doesn't??), get these!Mojitos remind you of home in Miami, and I always enjoy La Colada, being a huge fan of coconut (this one uses it toasted).We've been so full that the dessert menu has not been touched yet - all the more reason to return again.Follow up with a stroll along the waterfront after dinner and you're all set.
2017-07-31,1,This place is mismanaged. The waitress was rude. We called in and made a reservation but when we showed up they said that their kitchen is backed up and can't take any customers. Then she blames herself that she should have got our number to tell us that they can't take orders anymore. Whose mistake is it? For not taking our number when we called in or us choosing this restaurant for dinner. This place is overrated!
2017-07-27,4,Great service ! Very relaxed ambiance, but still upscale. Pretty good food could use some salt. Mango Mojito was delicious.
2017-07-23,4,Had the shrimp and scallop dish for dinner. It was pretty tasty! The rice was green and I think had maybe cilantro in it but it was good. My only complaint was that the music was so loud. Perhaps I'll say something next time.
2017-07-17,5,The good was good.service was excellent  . Its bigger than you would think. I guess they seat in the front only when it's not too busy. But when you go to the restroom you will notice theres more to this place. Atmosphere is relaxed Cuban feel. I would definitely go again.
2017-07-16,3,The food is decent enough. I was surprised how overpriced it was. I had such high hopes for this place.
2017-07-15,4,Amazing food! Drinks are also good. However, the service is hit or miss, which is the reason for the 4 stars. I want to stress how delicious the food is however.
2017-07-08,5,Wow! This place is amazing! Came in and it happened to be happy hour. Food was on point, mojitos well made and service was great! Just moved here from CA and I already know I'll be back many times! My new Cuban spot in NY/NJ for sure!
2017-07-07,1,Very disappointed with this restaurant. My partner and I were really excited to try this place and we made it in time for Happy Hour on a Friday. We had plans to have drinks and appetizers, our server seated us inside, then when we inquired about the happy hour we were told that happy hour is only at the bar. We decided to stay at our table and just order drinks and food. We ordered drinks and then asked to order appetizers, but our server told us that she would need our full order (meaning our dinner off the menu) since they were getting busy. We were thrown off and told her we needed more time. We just decided that we only wanted the drinks and appetizers after this as we felt rushed and did not like this service. So when our server returned, we let her know we were only having appetizers and drinks. She proceeds to tell us that drinks and appetizers would not meet the minimum to sit at a table...which wasn't mentioned at all prior to us sitting down. Overall, we were very disappointed and frustrated with this service. If the restaurant is going to have so many stipulations, it would be good to mention that on their website or inform the customers when they arrive. We will not be recommending this place. We ended up having dinner at Coco Havana instead, which was amazing!
2017-07-07,5,Best bread ever! Kinda loud though. The paella is out of this world.
2017-07-07,5,We went there last week..actually end up going there reading good reviews but i was hoping that It lives up to all the hype which it did as you can tell with my 5 star rating.. first of all, it was packed.. We were greeted right away and our waiter was very nice..Ordered a Mojito which was excellent..Waiter recommended guacamole with crabs and we also ordered El Classico which has roasted pork Shank, rice, Yuca and sweet plantain.. First the brought bread with butter which was pretty good per hubby as I didn't want to fill myself up with that.. Then came guacamole with plantain chips which was fresh and delicious ... so far very good and then came our entree which was off the hook.. Rice were full of flavors and meat was soo juicy and tender.. Yuka and sweet plantain was amazing too.. overall, this was an amazing experience and we will be back definitely to try some new food items. Do check it out!!!!!
2017-07-05,5,The food was delicious and tastes authentic. I ordered my steak medium and it was more on the rare side but flavor out of this world
2017-07-03,1,The food is decent but a bit pricey. However, the service is shockingly bad. I was here recently for a birthday dinner with a group of 8 plus a baby. At one point, the server spilled a beer on me that drenched my entire back and even splashed a little on the baby. I know mistakes happen so I didn't get overly upset, but what shocked me was that the manager never came over to make sure we were ok or see if we were ok and still able to have a good time. There are plenty of better choices for Cuban food in Hoboken, I wouldn't come back here.
2017-07-02,4,Great ambiance!  The food is very good too, call ahead on a weekend it gets backed, the oxtail is something worth writing about and so is the twice cooked steak!  Great date night
2017-07-02,1,'to sit at the table you need to order 4 starters minimum' ($14each) on an empty saturday afternoon. Seriously? What a rude waitress. Will gladly go go elsewhere. Update:Management (Lou) wrote to me saying that i should be accurate and put the range. Hence, the range is $8 to $16 for starters and will ask for a minimum  of 4, else you have to leave the table. In other words they won't serve you if they expect a small order /tip from you. Accurate enough? This is poor customer service. I would've gladly ordered more if the food was not enough but if you're that stingy with expected tips we will simply go somewhere else.
2017-07-01,5,Love! Love! Love! My husband and I went last night (Friday) around 9pm. No wait, immediately sat down. The server was great! We ordered the mango mojito ( a little to sweet) had to make them change it but when they did it was perfect ! My husband had the Cuban mojito he loved his. We ordered the guacamole with crab meat TOPPED  with plantain chips OMGGGGG! ($17)  Delicious! My husband ordered the "pulpo" ($14) octopus with a black bean and potato sauce AMAZING ! This was appetizers. We then both ordered the churrasco ($32$ it comes with fried yuca and a salad! It was perfect. The steak was topped with chimmichuri sauce , cooked to perfection. Desert - we shared the Tres Leche topped with strawberries!!! Outstanding !!!Overall super cute spot! Plenty of parking on the street. Service was great! Food was so good! A little pricey but for a beautiful night shared with my husband it was so worth it! Will definitely be returning!!!!!!
2017-06-30,4,I recently had brunch at The Cuban. Me and my group were in their private room for a baby shower. I had never eaten at the restaurant but was excited to try it. The food was delicious and the service was really fantastic. I would like to go back and try some of their other dishes - a few  that stood out for me were the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork (Amazing!) chicken empanadas, crunchy French Toast and their delicious desserts - the flan was tasty! They also gave us two different types of Sangria but I opted for a very strong mimosa! Great experience, I will definitely be back!
2017-06-28,5,The Cuban is my favorite place to brunch in Hoboken. Every time I visit the food is delicious. Everything is very flavorful and fresh. The atmosphere is also very enjoyable and there is some outside dining. 5 stars for excellent food, service and experience.
2017-06-24,5,The best restaurant in Hoboken. Food, atmosphere, drinks, and service are five star. Can't wait to go back!
2017-06-22,5,Everything about this restaurant was perfect! From the minute we walked in to the moment we left, we experienced nothing but the best ! We were a large party of 10, our waiter was amazing, friendly, knowledgeable and very attentive. The other waiters helping were amazing as well. My water was constantly being refilled, sometimes I didn't even see the guy refilling it. Service was impeccable, food was to die for, and the drinks were delicious. Overall an amazing experience. I actually found this place through yelp and its amazing reviews and they certainly lived up to every expectation. Will definitely be back here soon! Cheers to management and the staff for being amazing!!!
2017-06-21,5,The food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, the service was excellent. I had the mango mojito and it was strong and sweet just how I like it. The antojitos from the appetizer menu were perfect and from the main course my table ordered the churrasco, the paella Vallenciana and the salmon. They were all yummy. This is probably my new favorite spot in Hoboken.
2017-06-20,4,Never had a bad meal at The Cuban and am impressed by the service always. The wait staff is attentive, polite and seem to always be there when you need a Sangria re-fill. For appetizers we enjoyed bacon wrapped sweet plantains and a mussel dish with deep rich flavor. When they have masitas on the menu I always jump for that. For entre I went with El Classico, which includes a tender on the inside, crispy on the outside pork shank with morro (rice and black beans), yuka and maduros (sweet plantains). It's by far my favorite dish and so hard to choose something else. It's pricier than your typical mom and pop Cuban spot, but great drinks, upscale food and quality service make it well worth.
2017-06-20,5,Drinks are so strong and made well! Had such a nice bartender, wish I caught his name but I ordered a passion fruit mojito, passion fruit caipirinha and passion fruit sangria, both are definitely some kickers but their mojitos is what knocked me out of the park, such a deliciously made drink. They also give pao de queijo as a starter, and I'm brasilian so I appreciated it. I feel like this place is multi-cultural rather than just a cuban place. As an entree I got the churrasco, cooked and seasoned to perfection. Can't wait to come back! Great staff, great food, great drinks
2017-06-18,4,The Cuban has live music during Sunday brunch, which makes the restaurant quite a lively place to be. This restaurant seems to be fairly popular with families. It doesn't mean you get crying babies, but I also didn't see drunken sorority girls dancing on tabletops.They start you off with warm Brazilian cheese bread, which was really delicious. It had an excellent chewy yet fluffy texture (I've had too many Brazilian cheese breads with more of a gummy interior), and it was also served with a garlic butter.For my entree, I got the ropa vieja. The rice was fluffy and light, and the skirt steak was flavorfully braised and shredded tender. I ate all of it with great delight.The menu is fairly extensive, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.
2017-06-11,4,high quality food. Went there a few times and always had a great experience. Service staff was very patient and gave us great food recommendations. The drink menu was pretty pricey from what i remembered. Great Cuban bread!
2017-06-08,4,Love the decor, looks like a cozy spot for a first date or anniversary stop, I did not have the pleasure of dining there but the Cuban coffee is excellent :) Enjoy
2017-06-04,3,Was there on Friday night with a total party of 4 .  It took them about 10 mins to seat us with our confirmed reservation.  Once seated we saw our waiter after a few minutes to order drinks.  Drinks came ok, the we ordered apps.  Apps took forever to reach us and our waiter never came by once to let us know apps were delayed.   Finally they arrived and then we placed our dinner order with waiter.  I ordered half chicken and was supposed to come with a sauce, but never got it and our waiter not once came by to ask us if foods etc were ok.    The food was actually good, but not the service.  Our waiter just seemed not to be into our table.  We did leave a 20% tip, but I told my friends it should of been less.Place is also very loud, so if you really want table talk with out shouting at the person sitting next to you, then this is not the place.
2017-06-02,5,This is one of my favorite places to eat! Been here a few times and this time was the best! Service was great, waiter had some great specials to offer. I would definitely recommend this place!
2017-05-30,4,The ambiance was great! Good place for a special occasion. The service was decent, the waiter helped us to pick food items from the menu which turned out to be good. Only reason for a 4 star is very limited vegetarian options - only 1 for entree.
2017-05-30,4,I really like The Cuban. Food is consistently good both for dinner and brunch and the service is excellent. Very nice atmosphere inside or on the patio.
2017-05-27,5,Great Service,  Great drinks !  Great Athmosphare! Love it! Anytime again! Thank you!
2017-05-27,4,It was tasty..Stuff working good,nice place inside.I ordered beat salad with shrimps(8/10),my husband ate chicken (10/10)and empanandes(7/10).It was good dinner,nothing crazy.its nice for romantic dinner or friends/family meeting.
2017-05-25,3,Celebrated my birthday here with a group of 7. Great food, drinks were okay not the best. The location is a busy one but the ambiance and decor make-up for the parking. Downfall are the stairs. You have to walk about two flights of stairs to get to the restrooms. If you're drinking a lot and feeling nice you should be VERY careful. We ran into a bit of an issue with the manager because when we arrived only five people from my party were there and the manager did not mention that if my whole party was not there we could not be seated. At this point when he mentioned this he told me, the person celebrating the birthday, and we had already ordered two pitchers of Sangria and appetizers. It was unprofessional to wait so long to mention this 'rule' when it should've been mentioned in the email confirmation of my reservation or at the door. A member of the party end up speaking to him to let him know how rude that was of him and he apologized.
2017-05-24,1,Food was not good and not fresh tasting.  I met a friend of mine for after work drinks and dinner. Waiter was pleasant enough. We ordered drinks and when ready to order appetizers we were told we had to order the main course at the same time.  First time I've heard of this and we were not please getting rushed; but we ordered anyway. The crab guacamole was not fresh looking or tasting, so I recommend you skip it, but the chicken empanadas was delicious.  Right before we ordered our second drink the waitstaff started removing our plates to set up for the main course. We told the waiter we were not ready for the main course; we wanted to order another drink first.  He said okay, no worries, the main course won't be ready for another 15-20 minutes... that was a lie; it arrive 2 minutes later, it was not good, not fresh and it was cold. I used to love this place but they are losing it. Btw, this was at 6pm and not a full house.  I don't recommend this place anymore.
2017-05-24,5,I cannot say enough good things about this place! Came for dinner on a Monday, and although we walked in right after a private work party of at least 20 people, service was outstanding. They offer a Prix Fixe menu on weeknights, with a great wine selection. The front section is cozy with mostly smaller tables and a nice ambience but there's also an entire back seating area to accommodate larger parties. The food quality is completely worth the price. Will definitely be back!
2017-05-23,3,Came here for a quick bite to eat after picking my sister up from the airport. We just wanted a few drinks and some small bites. We were asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside. Tables were open in both areas. It was 45 minutes until close and it's a Tuesday night, so not very busy. We sat down and ordered wine and got two appetizers and a side since we didn't think we could finish a full meal. After we ordered, the waiter came over to us and told us that the outside seating area was normally reserved for people who ordered full meal but that they would make an exception since it's late and the tables weren't all filled. We felt totally caught off guard and ended up talking about this the entire time. Why wouldn't you tell us before hand? We could have sat inside and avoided feeling reprimanded for no reason. If you were going to let us sit here anyway, what was the point of telling us? Do you want us to feel uncomfortable? Really disappointed in the approach and experience. Restaurants should make everyone feel like they are welcomed and that all business is appreciated, at a minimum.
2017-05-21,4,The Cuban is without a doubt one of Hoboken's top restaurants for service, happy hour, and food. Hidden amongst many of the bars on Washington St. you will find a classy, spot where the Cuban culture comes alive that leaves you wanting more of everything including the Salsa music they play. How could I not begin with a sangria!  One cup of sangria costs $9. The white sangria had the right amount of alcohol. I found the red to be hard to drink because of all of the pulp but both were very good.We arrived at 5pm and were offered the pre-fix dinner menu for $32 pp. It included an appetizer, dinner, and dessert. For an appetizer I ordered the ropa vieja empanada which was divine! It's good for 1-2 people considering it's one empanada cut in half. The empanada crust was cooked to perfection. The choices of dinner were tough but I stuck to my favorite and went for the vaca frita. I was sold on the dish because it came with avocado. The white rice and black beans are a traditional Cuban side dish and are always satisfying. This side was no different. Super good. The vaca frita was very good as well. It was extra crispy throughout probably a little more then I have had on previous orders. This could've been because they left it in the broiler a little too long? Even with the extra crunch it was delicious and a huge portion. By the time dessert came I was stuffed and took my flan to go.  The service was superb from the minute we were greeted to the end as we exited. The Cuban is definitely one of the higher end restaurants for Cuban food but you get what you pay for. Every penny spent is worth the great food, music, and time spent here.
2017-05-20,1,One star is generous. I walked in on a Saturday afternoon with my family and told the staff I was there for apps and drinks. I was seated and told the staff that we were there for drinks and an app. Soon afterwards we were asked to leave by the manger. They found out we weren't having a full brunch and they weren't happy about it. Not a family friendly place...
2017-05-20,5,Love the Cuban and one our favorites in hoboken. Great sangria, food is delicious and fair prices and portion sizes. Very friendly wait staff
2017-05-19,5,Just an amazing experience at the Cuban in Hoboken. My girlfriend and I were on vacation and, as usual, stayed in North Jersey for daily excursions into NYC.  We decided to have dinner in Hoboken, and we could not have been more happy with our decision.  Our waiter Rudy was excellent and provided wonderful recommendations.  The food, cocktails and ambiance were refined and truly exceptional.  We will be visiting again for brunch this weekend!
2017-05-13,5,Meals are well portioned and packed full of flavor. This was one of my favorite finds
2017-05-12,1,Really disappointed with the service here. I came with a few friends for happy hour and we were told that we could have happy hour at a table since there was no room at the bar as long as we ordered 5 small plates. Then we sat down and were told no happy hour. Two of the girls I was with were going to share an entree so I ordered the mussels appetizer and we were then told we had to order more food because we were sitting at a table. The mussels weren't even good they were sitting with a pile of soggy fries on top covered in a greasy mayo sauce. We also ordered the guacamole which was not the freshest seafood for the price. Overall I was unimpressed. My friends and I are more than able to spend money on an expensive dinner but I wasn't expecting our happy hour idea to turn into $60 per person. I won't be coming back.
2017-05-11,4,The ambiance of the restaurant is incredible. The vibe is perfect and you do not feel like you are in Hoboken. My food was very good but as a vegetarian there were only two options for me. I have been to a lot of Cuban Restaurants where the options are endless. I would come again because my dish was very good.
2017-05-10,5,Soooo good. A good mix of traditional cuisine with a New York flair. Nicely decorated & the wait staff was professional. Good eats. Family friendly.
2017-05-07,3,First, let me write that I have been going here since I moved to Hoboken in early 2011.   I like the atmosphere and the bartenders are cool.  The appetizers are good and the food is ok.  I also believe the servers are good.  The drinks are good as well and most of my money is spent at the bar rather than the restaurant.  The one thing that bugs me though is .. I have spent many thousands of dollars here over the past 6 years.  The manager sees me in there and MUST recognize me.  He has never once bought me a drink.  I think that is just poor business.  Albert, Steve and Rudy are great bartenders, but it would be nice if someone hooked me up here and there considering the huge tips I leave for them and the money I spend.  Just my two cents on how things work since I was a bartender, server and a bar manager in my younger days.
2017-04-30,5,The best happy hour in Hoboken!!!!! Mojito de hippy is awesome. The Cuban sand which is great. Atmosphere and staff are fantastic.
2017-04-30,5,The food, the service - everything about this place was impeccable. Tried the fluffy omlette and it was amazing. Ordered a cocquito and it's definitely a must order for a hot summer day. Definitely coming back again!!
2017-04-29,5,If I had died right after eating here, I would have died happily.Ambiance - intimate and romantic. The place is small upfront but I believe they have more seating in the back. In the summer they have a small patio in front of the establishment. The bar area is a decent size with a couple of TVs.Appetizers - we had the empanaditas de pollo. They are two cut into four but large and filling. The Berejena which is the eggplant fries were delicious! Entree - I had the chef special - fish of the day which consisted of Red Snapper filet, asparagus, some type of potatoe like salad with a sweet purée - Mind blowing delicious!  And the Mar y Tierra which from my understanding was also amazing.Drinks - I had the mojito which was a little too strong for me and was missing the sugar cane stick. We were so stuffed we couldn't try out the dessert but that's another reason to come back.
2017-04-25,1,very loud and the manager was rude.  told us to order an appetizer and an entree per person even the kids or else we have to leave.  practically told us to leave if we don't like it... Wow. HOW Rude..
2017-04-22,3,5 stars for the service/drinks but the food is really not as flavorful. I picked this placed because the ratings were so high. But it's just okay food. The neighborhood is cute and hipsteresque. But here's a hint if you don't see many cubans eating in a Cuban Restaurant it probably isn't that good.
2017-04-17,4,The guacamole was very good, as was the tamale. Service was excellent, cocktails were great.Now, I want to come back for brunch.  Great addition to the neighborhood!
2017-04-17,4,I went today with my daughter and boyfriend since we couldn't receive service at Anthony David.  Things always happen for a reason... cause I went here after wandering Hoboken with my daughter with a empty stomach and cranky mind. As soon as we walked in. greeted and treated like family. The waiter brought us water and even went above and beyond by creating a sippy cup for my little girl. We had the chicken empanada which was packed with flavor and fried to perfection. As our main I had the Pernil and my boyfriend had the surf and turf.  The Pernil was good, but just that. Nothing to crazy. I feel it lacked citrus. No lime. No salt. It was a bit bland. I asked for lime and a mojo sauce and wow what a difference! It wasn't a bad Pernil cause the flavor was there as far as for season (garlic, pepper, etc) it was lacking in a little more salt. It wasn't dry. Nice and juicy. Just needed lime to cut thru the fat and little more salt. Had I not had Pernil before it would have been disappointing to a first timer not knowing how to adjust the flavor. Once The waiter brought the lime and dressing it was amazing though! Moving on, the steak and shrimp was PERFECT . Cooked perfectly medium rare, flavored,sides also amazing, which I believe was spinach in a cream sauce. Also portions are huge, personally for me. I could have spilt that meal with my friend. Also maybe cause I eat like a bird. You be the judge:My man was able to eat all though. To add, between my boyfriend and I we had two drinks each. I tried a glass of sangria. (They have different versions, I can't recall the one I ordered) It was delicious though. My boyfriend had a ".pina colada" drink and I only was able to taste it once he offered me some when he was almost finished, and for what I did taste was DELISH. He drank it fast so im assuming that was a good sign. He also had a mojito but I didn't get to try it and I ended with a white wine. we also ordered flan and churros. I personally enjoyed the flan more than churros. I'm so use to the original churros that there version was too much for me. But that's just me. I wouldn't say not to try cause they come fresh and the dough is so yummy and crispy and soft in the inside. Nom. I wish it had no filling.but if u love chocolate I can see u loving this. The waiter and staff are extremely kind. My family and I are coming back.
2017-04-16,2,Not the best Cuban I've ever had. Vaca frita was tasteless vaca, lemonade was watery and cortadito was not as strong as the ubiquitous ones in Cuba.Mind you Cuba is a poor island but they prepare much better food.I tend to think that Americans taste is bland, so restaurants accommodate food to their colorless taste. Very disappointing.Place is good looking, the only problem, the bathroom is two flights up and only reachable by stairs. A poor woman in stretches made her way but she was afraid to go down and fall. Who thinks of a design for a restaurant like that?Won't be going back.
2017-04-15,3,I don't get what the hype is about this restaurant. The food is good, but really nothing special. It's overpriced, under seasoned food. I ordered the ropa vieja which was served kind of dry. Also the tres leches cake had some nasty fruit paste on top of it. What happened to a traditional slice of tres leches? Cuban Pete's in Montclair is way better and much cheaper.
2017-04-13,5,Easily one of the BEST restaurants my fiancé and I have been since moving to the NY area. Better than most restaurants even in Manhattan in terms of taste, service, and ambiance. Came here a couple weeks ago and will be coming again tomorrow night.
2017-04-13,5,Such a nice find on Washington street! Food is authentic and delicious. We got a bunch of tapas ranging from the crabmeat guacamole, meatballs, garlic shrimp and bacon wrapped plaintains. Sangria is also amazing, strong and not too sugary. You walk in and it's not just the outside part and front restaurant as it goes back deep with upstairs. Feels like a tropical oasis. Service was attentive and fast. Wide variety of food options but I was disappointed when there was no Cuban sandwich. Apparently, they have a separate bar menu and happy hour from 3-7.
2017-04-12,5,I seriously can't believe how amazing the food is but it's worth every penny. It's fresh and just awesome. Even on a busy night the food still comes out on time. I love it 10million stars.
2017-04-11,4,Let me start off by saying that my review may be slightly biased as I believe our recent visit to The Cuban marked the first time my SO has ever made a reservation on his own.  I'm so glad he chose The Cuban for that milestone!  Despite our server initially being slightly (understandably) confused by my desire to have a "mojito" like drink with vodka (sorry, I cannot stomach rum) - our service was great.  I did find it a little odd that we had to order the entire meal at one time... We often order a few small plates before deciding on our entree, but I'm sure there's some rhyme or reason to this policy (most likely to help them space the meal) and it wasn't a huge inconvenience. They get extra points for the cool atmosphere and the food was also pretty dang good. The highlight of our meal was the deditos de bacalao and the aguacate con cangrejo - highly recommend both!For entrees we had the Churrasco and the boliche.  The churrasco was fantastic and I loved the chimichurri.  For me the boliche was just too heavy of a dish for me to truly enjoy more than a couple bites.Overall definitely recommend and will be back!
2017-04-10,5,I LOVED THIS PLACE SO MUCH!!!! I don't give out 5 stars liberally, but this place truly deserved it. We attended for brunch on a Saturday, and they were very flexible when we had to change our reservation around and our table was prepared when we arrived. FOOD:As a vegetarian, I've resigned myself to ordering random sides when I visit Cuban restaurants. This place, however, had SO many options for vegetarians that I actually had a tough time deciding what to eat! I had to the corn polenta with wild mushrooms and a poached egg, and I added an avocado which enhanced the taste as well. My friends also ordered the ropa vieja and the cuban sandwich which they enjoyed as well. Our one mistake was almost not ordering dessert, but we ended up trying the tres leches, chocolate bread pudding, and churros, and they were some of the best desserts we'd ever had. SERVICE:Our waiter was very sweet and reminded us of their specials before we ordered. We had no trouble with a long wait time for food, and he was always pleasantly available for any questions we had. ATMOSPHERE:The music was really great, and contributed to a general vibe of being on vacation! Recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for an excuse to head out to Hoboken! It was such a short ride to the city and the view is great! As you digest your food, it's not a bad idea to take a stroll along the Hudson River also :)
2017-04-10,4,Food is very delicious.  Had the churrasco and lechón. Service was really good as well despite how busy it was as we went on a Sunday afternoon.  The guac with crabmeat appetizer was excellent.  Will be back to try dessert.  Very nice ambience.
2017-04-09,5,Stellar food! The salmon avocado tartar was amazing. I highly recommend the pallea! The ambiance in the back room is very nice. The rooms are semi-private, creating an intimate feel.
2017-04-05,5,Amazing food. It is a bit pricey but well worth it. The paella I had one time was on par with the one I had in Spain. Love going here.
2017-04-02,4,This restaurant is great. The food is sooo good. I was told to go here by a friend and decided to try it out. I am defintely going back. The food was served very quickly.
2017-04-01,5,I've been here a few times after work for Happy Hour. The drink specials and Happy Hour appetizers are delicious and there is a nice variety which pretty much guarantees something to everyone's liking if you come with a group. This week, The Cuban extended hours to include Lunch on Thursdays and Fridays beginning at 11:30am.  I was so excited to have a new lunch option in Hoboken. I went with a group of 12 for lunch. We were easily accomodated and service was prompt and courteous.  Among the dishes ordered were the Havana Club, Ropa Vieja, Bacalao, and a classic Cubano. Everyone enjoyed their food. We also ordered a few drinks including the Hemingway, Sangria de Invierno, and Mojitos. Hemingway was a favorite.  Really great experience every time. Highly recommended.  If you plan on Happy Hour or dinner, definitely make a reservation as it gets pretty busy most evenings.
2017-03-26,4,First off, this is one of the better restaurants if you're looking for something close to special in Hoboken. Think date, special occasion, or "I dont want a meal that consists of a piece of cheese put on carbs or a piece of ground beef put on carbs" like many other establishments around here. The food is great, it really is and I've had my fair share of cuban. So are the drinks - you will not find a better sangria in Hoboken and you'll be hard pressed in NYC. All of that said, I'm giving them a four given I've been there at least a half a dozen times and at least half of those times I've been overcharged based on a miscommunication and of those times only once did they take it off the bill. This is a 1 star treatment and would have been my conclusion at most other restaurants, their superior food/drinks are saving it here. My question to them: why be so cheap!? We're talking $5 variances here, and yet they just say its my problem and refuse to deduct it. And it's a recurring communication issue between me, their staff, and/or the menu - this doesnt happen at every restaurant. Let's get it up to 5, not that hard to meet the customer on these simple things.
2017-03-26,5,A little pricey and noisy. Pork, guacamole, plantains, paella, and bread pudding were grest
2017-03-19,2,So we loved our first experience so much we came for my birthday, the 2 stars is for management not for service...service as in our waiter was not responsible for the disappointment of having so many dishes not available for my party of 7,how embarrassing. I manage a restaurant the most we miss is one dish ... to have a list yes a LIST of dishes unavailable at 7pm would mean someone didn't do the proper food shopping. If it had been just me and my boyfriend we would have just got up and walked out but for the sake of my group I tried to be patient even though 5 out of the 7 in the group had to re-select another entree of the very small selection. We are not a difficult party especially growing up in the food business...but this wasn't a good start at least they didn't run out of Sauvignon Blanc. Their are plenty of Cuban restaurants and never have I had them run out of Vaca frita a staple dish....it's like a mexican restaurant running out of tacos. If you come with a group and you have a favorite dish call ahead and make sure they even have it.Wish management/owner was better at tracking food inventory too much not to have in one day probably our last time.
2017-03-15,4,Good food and service...slightly expensive but has some really great appetizer options and amazing atmosphere!
2017-03-10,5,Loved this place! Amazing amotspherw, staff, live music, food and drinks!I had a Hemingway mojito. As appetizers we got antojitos which was spicy chorizo, plantains, chicharron (pork belly) and yuca croquettes with yummy cheese inside! Also we ordered these chicken buns with picked jalapeños! Soooo good! The bread in these buns is made out of lotus which made it not heavy at all. Our entree was oxtail which they serve off the bone! So easy to eat! Definitely recommend this place! The 2 guys that were playing were awesome!
2017-03-10,2,Worse Cuban sandwich EVER!! This is not an authenticity Cuban restaurant. The food is horrible, the staff is rude. Cuban's don't even run this restaurant. If you want EXCELLENT Cuban food. Go to Rumbas Cubana or any Cuban restaurant in Union City, NJ. This place has the worse manager and the world's worse Cuban sandwich.
2017-02-26,5,Excellent cuisine, atmosphere, and drinks. They offer specials in addition to the regular menu items, so be sure to listen close, as they're usually delicious options! The servers were very attentive and experienced. I would highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for an authentic Cuban meal.
2017-02-20,4,The weekday (not including Fridays) early-bird prefix here is a great deal! We just walked in off the street without a reservation at around 5:50 PM on a Monday and had no trouble getting a table. With this deal you get three courses for around $30. Most of the entrees cost between $22-30 themselves, so it is well worth it. The server told us they were slightly smaller portions, but I walked out with left-overs so I think they are more than ample for the average diner. I love mojitos! These are correctly muddled, well-balanced, and come in a variety of flavors. I tried the passion fruit and the coconut. The passion fruit is nice and tart, so I preferred it over the coconut.  I would go back here just for the drinks. Food was good, but some dishes clearly won out over others. The little starchy rolls you get to begin your meal have a pleasant chewy texture. My chicken empanadas were very flavorful. My paella, while not Cuban as far as I know, had lots of flavor and a nice variety of seafood in it. They were flexible and happy to leave out the sausage for me since I don't eat pork. The only part I didn't enjoy was the clams as the were a bit gritty and over-cooked. Mussels were good though. The rice was cooked a little more than I'd like, but it wasn't bad. The tres leches was good, but typical. The flan my husband had was super creamy, rich, and delicious. Service was excellent and our water glasses were never empty and courses were perfectly spaced out. The server was happy to accommodate dietary requests and answer questions. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience at The Cuban Restaurant and Bar. I'm not sure how authentic the food is as it is only the second time I have been to a Cuban restaurant, but the drinks, food, and service were great! A note about parking: There is plenty on the street nearby, but make sure you are very careful when typing in your license plate number. We were one letter off apparently and got a ticket. To contest it, you have to go to court in Hoboken. Yikes! Don't learn your lesson the hard way like we did. Check your ticket carefully before leaving your car!
2017-02-16,5,Fabulous.  Ate at the bar. The drinks were excellent.  The food was excellent. The service was excellent and we even ordered food to go home with.  Awesome.
2017-02-12,5,Really enjoyed our meal. Atmosphere was great, food amazing. Service was great too.  My ten year old loved the paella! She doesn't eat too much and this was a large portion but she loved it and ate most of it! I had the flank steak really yummy.  A little pricey but a great evening out and highly recommend the place for great food, service and atmosphere.
2017-02-11,5,In love with this place. They treat their food seriously but don't necessary take themselves too seriously. Their passion fruit mojitos is refreshing, fruity, robust and ...passionate. Their sangria is also a great choice. Their plates come in large proportions, but it is hard to put down your fork because they are excellent. If you like seafood definitely try their paella. Make sure you wrap up your meal with their tres leches. This is my favorite place in the greater New York area.
