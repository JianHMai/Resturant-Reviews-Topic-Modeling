2021-11-12,1,Yes, the Infamous SC Quesadilla was infamously bad!!! In fact, it's the worst Quesadilla I've ever had in my life. A 10 year old could do better!  I've had better quesadillas out of the buffet chaffing dishes that have been sitting for 2 hours in my office cafeteria. Description: Chicken, corn, jalapeños and Guacamole. What I received was a dry Quesadilla, with a maximum of 6 corn kernels (not exaggerating) inside, 4 slices of Jalapeño, no Guacamole (I forgot to mention this when I called the restaurant) and an absurdly tiny amount of cheese. When I called the restaurant about my entire order (I'll get to the rest), I was advised, "Corn is only mentioned because the tortilla is made of corn and the kernels inside are for garnish" Hmmmm... Has anyone ever had garnish on food you can't see because it's cooked IN the food? Is turkey stuffing garnish? What about cheese on hamburgers? I then told the woman who answered the phone that maybe corn shouldn't be listed as the 2nd ingredient. She preceded to tell me the crema had corn in it, "corn" was only listed on the Grub Hub menu for awareness, and that the quesadilla was not meant to be packed with corn.  I dont know what the restaurants definition of packed is, but there wasn't even a teaspoon of corn in it. One piece of the cut quesadilla didn't even have a kernel in it. Moving on, we also ordered the Blackened Chilli Salmon. Description: Seared Salmon...served with stir fried cauliflower rice and veggies. What I received was Salmon which didn't taste that fresh, regular white rice and over cooked spinach perhaps, or was it kale? Who knows.  I was advised that "They no longer serve the cauliflower rice and Grub Hub had been slow in updating the menu. And,while Grub Hub is "slow", the menu was updated after I called. Wow, miracles really do happen!I received a refund for the Salmon dish, but, this will be our first and and last time ordering from/eating here. Messing up a Quesadilla is really hard to do. "It's better to offer no excuse than a bad one".
2021-10-15,5,Not the first time we've paid a visit here. We love their location in SW Hoboken. Their food and drinks are always on point. Would recommend the salmon. 10/10. Their burgers and sandwiches are always delicious too. I really love their specialty drinks - especially their Moscow Mules, however, was not such a big fan of their seasonal spooky sangria. It would be exciting to see this place draw a bigger crowd on the weekend. I'm sure it did pre-covid. This place is ol' reliable. You can't go wrong.
2021-09-17,3,This place seems to have fallen off. Ordered delivery. The quesadilla was below average and so was the shrimp tacos. The bourbon wings weren't bad. They forgot to send half the order but credited me back. Boo.
2021-08-03,4,The Stewed Cow recently started Taco Tuesdays, and on July 27th had an absolutely amazing pork taco. These tacos were made with a mind-bendingly delicious chorizo recipe that left me craving more all week. I went back tonight to learn they replaced that recipe with a run-of-the-mill pulled pork recipe, which I found forgettable. Stewed Cow, please bring back the original outstanding, lip-smacking, mouthwatering, flavorful, savory, exquisite chorizo pork tacos that left me wanting more! If you do, I'll be back every Tuesday with friends in tow. Otherwise I'll stay home, feeling grateful I at least had them once.
2021-06-06,2,Had brunch here, wasn't drinking so I asked if it was a better deal if I just ordered a la carte and the waitress confirmed. I got the chicken and waffles and an iced coffee. The waffles were soggy eggos and the chicken was just ok. The waffles were 22$ and the iced coffee was 4$ so it would have been better for me to do the 25$ brunch deal even if I wasn't having any alcoholic beverage. I knew this place had solid reviews but after going here I am disappointed. They do have a lot of good beers and mixed drinks so I could see this being a good spot just for drinks. I would skip brunch though!
2021-06-05,4,I cannot comment on the food/dinner experience, but Stewed Cow is one of my favorite bars in Hoboken for a night out. It has an awesome atmosphere and plenty of drinks for reasonable prices. I went with a few friends last Saturday night, and we sat at the bar. The bartenders were excellent - so friendly and the drinks were delicious. Rounds of shots were also fairly priced. This is definitely a local bar, so it's particularly nice if you want to escape the main Hoboken tourist traps. My friends and I always have great nights here - highly recommend!
2021-05-18,2,MEH. I've had the brunch here twice and both times the food has come out at room temperature. They claim to give you "a lil sumpin' from the house" for a starter, which is just watery, bland oatmeal with chocolate chips in it. Got the steak sandwich. Tough, chewy meat and watered down, light poured cocktails. Plus the waitstaff obviously hate their lives. This is a place you'd go if you also hate your yuppie life and don't mind paying high prices for a mediocre experience. Seems like a mismanaged nightmare. They obviously don't care about quality control. Fries were good tho. Overall, pretty lame. Also, they always have crappy acoustic guitar players that I can hear from my apartment and that one blonde girl that's always there is a total vibe kill. Screw you guys, I'm going home!
2021-04-04,4,Stopped into the Stewed Cow on Sunday while walking around town. It was Easter, so it wasn't very crowded. They have a good selection of local beers, and we were pleased with both options we tried from 902 Brewing - Cherry Slushie Sour Ale, and Hoboken Fresh Start IPA.Outdoor tables are well distanced, and they have QR Codes on the table with the menu and to pay via Venmo. Our waitress was attentive but not overbearing; she wore a mask the entire time. We weren't hungry, but the brunch menu looks delicious and is a good deal so we'll be back to try that out soon - $25 per person for a shared app, muffins, an entree and two drinks!
2021-02-01,4,The Stewed Cow is quickly becoming a new favorite place since Covid-19.  I've visited recently for indoor dining on both a Thursday and a Saturday night since they have live music those nights.  They are on Open Table and reservations are needed on Saturdays.  This past Saturday I had a reservation for 2 at 7 pm.  They weren't taking any walk-ins since they were fully booked for the night and they told us they were adhering to the 90 minute seating rule as a result.  Our server said he was from their sister restaurant, Brass Rail - I didn't even know they were related.  He was awesome and very accommodating the entire time.  My friend and I each tried cocktails for our first round - I had the bourbon bramble which was really delicious.  My friend had the perfect pear which she also liked.  Their food menu isn't huge and it's a lot of your typical 'bar food' but good nonetheless.  We shared the spinach & artichoke dip, buffalo wings, and loaded tater tots.  Everything was yummy and came out quickly.   At around 8:15 pm, our waiter told us we'd have to get up soon for another reservation.  We didn't want to leave so he was able to move us over to another table where there was a cancellation - we lucked out!  The band was really good and they played up until 10 when we had to leave.  I'll definitely be back again with my friends on a Saturday for dinner & music.
2021-01-19,5,Went here for din with one of my long time besties. We had their specialty cosmo cocktail & ordered 3 dif apps.. the empanada's, loaded tots & shrimp tacos. We cleared the plates & then took home their crispy chicken sandwich. SO good. Will be back again!
2021-01-17,1,Upon arrival to this bar on 1/17/21, we thought it was a cute place to hang out and grab a few drinks towards our dinner reservation. We were informed that there are only tables in the back where there are no televisions. We ordered a couple drinks and a small snack (shared fries) to pass the time. We understood how many places are frowned upon by just serving drinks without food so we ordered without asking.However, one hour after seating we were greeted by our server telling us there is a reservation placed that would require us to leave our table. After requesting speaking with the manager, she states that everyone has been accounted for, for their recorded times at the establishment, and that "people who ordered entrees have allotted a longer time for the full 90 mins of table reservation. And If you didn't there is only 60 minutes." She said that there also was a "miscommunication with the server who should have mentioned that our table was limited" and that there is a no reconcile for their lack of miscommunication on their part.Upon reviewing the guests, at least one table was there before our arrival and did was not asked to leave. And were well after our departure.We were handed our check without asking if we needed anything else.The place seems cute and the server was nice (though caught in the crossfires), being asked to leave without valid reason constitutes for bad service and I am highly dissatisfied.
2020-12-28,4,Always a great time at the Stewed Cow. The drinks are great, and most of the food is great. The brunch deal pre-covid could not be beat.
2020-12-13,5,Some of the most fun I've had at a brunch in a long time! Food and drinks were amazing, staff was great, and so covid safe! 5/5!
2020-09-25,5,UNREAL spot! Lighting is fab, live music with Jeff is great, service with Taylor spot on, and they have a huge rotating craft. This is the local spot.
2020-09-20,5,Popped over on sat nite for dinner. Great craft cocktails and the food was delicious.  I had the ribs, my husband had the Cajun fettuccine - we were beyond pleased.  Stop in and if you're lucky Lana will be your server. She was awesome and makes great suggestions!
2020-08-31,5,I came here on a Friday night. I was seated immediately. Waiters were very polite and attentive. I ordered papaya mango salad with steak medium rare. My boyfriend ordered a burger and tater tots. My salad was refreshing and my steak was cooked to perfection!! Who likes to send back over cooked steak while watching your company finish their food then 30 minutes later, they watch you eat? Not me!! I took a bite of my boyfriend's burger and it was super juicy and tender. Tater tots were crunchy. I rarely crave for burgers but if I do, this will be my go to spot. They're also pet friendly. Great spot!
2020-07-31,2,Just got back from Stewed Cow and I am extremely disappointed. First off, they advertised live music for Friday from 8-10pm so I made a reservation for 8pm. When I get there and noticed there was no live music, I asked about the band they said it was actually the night before. I heard another table ask the same question to their server so I'm certain they were false advertising to get more reservations. My fiancé ordered the southern 75 cocktail and he said it was terrible which takes a lot for him to say. The food was decent we got the wings, a burger and chicken sandwich. Unfortunately though I will not be returning again.
2020-07-05,5,Awesome brunch. $25 you get a delicious entrée with 2 drinks. The food is so beautifully prepared and beyond delicious. I will definitely come back. The wait staff is wonderful and they know the menu very well.
2020-06-23,5,Delicious and very inexpensive brunch.  Everything tasted so light and flavorful. The mimosas and bloody Mary's were excellent.
2020-02-12,4,I was jonesing for some late breakfast when I stumbled across this place. Thankfully they had open tables because we had already been to a couple of spots that were full. My husband ordered the burger and I got Huevos Rancheros. It was probably the best huevos rancheros I have ever had. Not too oiniony, or spicy. And just what I was hungry for. The server was pleasant and my husband also thoroughly enjoyed his burger. Their fries are really good! Thick and crispy. This is a solid place to check out. I read some great reviews about their cocktails as well but didn't indulge.
2020-01-17,5,Love this place. A cute local bar. Good service. Good beer. Low key, relaxed atmosphere. Nothing fancy but great to stroll into if you're looking to grab some drinks and appetizers. I'm not a country fan, but still love this place
2019-12-20,5,I've been here a couple of times; once during brunch and the other for a night out. If you are coming here; this is one of the bars that are not so close to the rest of the strip so have that in mind. However it is worth spending the night or brunch there. For brunch; they have an amazing menu with tons of variety and they have a special that you get two drinks, your meal and a basket of muffin for 25 dollars. Two drinks alone is worth 25 dollars. The drinks vary from your typical brunch; mimosa and Bloody Mary but even goes as far as Paloma's, manmosas(blue moon and champagne), and several other great drinks. Their Bloody Mary is premade so my friend got one batch that was a hit and the other one was a miss, but the waitress got her another drink. For nighttime it is your prettt standard bar, but with a mechanical bull in the back. Definitely do some shots before going to the bull!
2019-12-17,3,It's, well, it's fine. Service is pretty bad, food is decent though. Prepare to be merely whelmed.
2019-11-03,5,Came here after checking for best burgers in Hoboken. Well we were pretty damn happy with our burgers. They came out perfect, mine rare, his medium well done. French fries were really good, beat I've had in a long time. Staff was nice, game was on, Will be back!
2019-10-27,3,Food took a while and was mediocre. Bartender was nice. Drinks aren't too pricey and it's cool for a chill last minute place to go, especially if you live close and don't feel like walking.
2019-10-25,1,Bartender was drinking at the bar and was too busy taking shots to serve us. However, when she finally got around around to serving us she forgot our drink order twice. On top that we asked to ride the bull and she said she put the rides on the tab. Yet we never got tickets. When we returned to the bar to ask for the tickets and she accused me of lying. Specifically "be truthfull next time." I was taken back because I've never been accused of steeling by a bartender. I said "you told me they were on my bill". She said "Are you still trying." What a terrible experience. If you're the owner do you know your bartenders get drunk on the job. At this point you may be wondering who this bartender is. It's a mid 20s brunette who has attitude problem.  If your a customer run!
2019-10-15,2,Went here twice within the last month and both times the service was just awful. I'm not picky but they really have the worst waitstaff. It took 1 hour to get a drink when the place wasn't even busy at all. I liked my food but a bunch of other people in my party didn't like theirs. Definitely won't be going here again
2019-10-08,3,The Stewed Cow certainly has a Southern theme, but really offers a little something for everyone.  While the majority of the menu items include bar fare with a rustic flare, they also offer a healthier option of Make Your Own Salad, which I have ordered many times.  In addition to choosing vegetables and cheeses, the restaurant offers a variety of fruit and nuts that can also be incorporated.  I have also added avocado and grilled chicken as more substantial components.  The ingredients are always extremely fresh, and the chicken has been tender and well-cooked.  Regarding other items I have tasted, their Soft Pretzel has been mediocre at best, while their Corn Bread side dish was sweet and flavorful, though a tad greasy.  In terms of their beverages, none of their custom cocktails have really appealed to me, but if you are a whiskey drinker, you will be in heaven.  They have a massive selection of whiskeys and even a punch card of 10 different flights to conquer.  Aside from the whiskey, they have a few other liquors, like Deep Eddy Vodka from Austin, as well as a decent tap and bottle beer selection, including brews like the Founders IPA.  Their big weekend draw is a mechanical bull that can be braved with the sign of a simple waiver.  Weekday crowds range from avid sports fans there to watch a game or those in search of a quiet drink on non-game days.  The rustic saloon atmosphere and diverse menu set The Stewed Cow apart from the other traditional sports bars and Irish pubs in Hoboken.
2019-09-29,2,This place has really gone down hill.  The service is down right awful - even though there's plenty of waitstaff, they seem more interested in hanging out and talking by the bar than being at their tables.  Also, their brunch prefix (the only thing you can order on Sunday until 3pm) was $25 for essentially bad bar breakfast food.  I used to enjoy coming here but can't recommend it to anyone at this point.  Hopefully they can figure it out...
2019-09-20,1,My breakdown:Burger - I ordered Medium  and it was so burnt that there was a charcoal crust which overrode the taste of the entire dinner.  Also not impressed with the amount of grease that would squirt out.  Definitely was not because of how juicy the burger was.Cheese -  also completely burnt around the edges.  Bun - very stale (lightly toasted which I'm guessing is an attempt at hiding how stale it was) Tomato - missing Lettuce - wilted with brown spots Onion - a huge slice / slab of onion that was way too thickOnion Straws - cold and greasy Pickle - delicious $14.50 later and the garnish was the only decent thing about the meal.
2019-08-04,5,Just threw my boyfriend's 30th birthday party here last night. Colleen and Anthony were my points of contact and answered all of my questions that I had leading up to the night. They were extremely accommodating and allowed me to order food that typically was not on the party menu. They made the whole planning process so smooth. The Stewed Cow doesn't have a private room, but they set up a corner for us with the food that I was able to decorate. We were able to mingle with everyone else throughout the bar which everyone preferred anyway. Everyone raved about how good the food was, the extensive options for open bar, and how much fun they had riding the bull. Thank you so much for a great night!
2019-06-27,1,Eff'd up Online order, Food came 2 hours laterIce cold.  They should have ate the cost.  All around poor service and rude manager.the online ordering and quality of food has declined steadily over last two years.  This is my last time ordering from them. At the restaurant itself food quality is a break even 5 out of 10, service 4 out of 10.
2019-06-05,5,Haven't been here? GO! Amazing brunch deal ($20- 2 drinks and a massive entree), the regular menu is to die for (Brisket Platter, Campfire Nachos and Bourbon wings are musts) and like 100 whiskeys (best selection in Hoboken for sure). Oh yeah, and a mechanical bull in the back if you're trying to feel like you're in college again.
2019-02-24,1,I would give zero stars but I had to give one. First I sat at the bar and the stool was wobbly- I tried five other stools  and they were all wobbly. The mimosas had basically no alcohol in them, it was all orange juice. The food had no taste. They also were out of French fries and they didn't tell us and just replaced with tater tots. We ended up not really eating and going somewhere else to eat again.
2019-01-29,5,Talk about flipping that frown upside down ! I was really upset and decided I wanted to get some food and headed straight to this place ! Not even before I made it to my seat at the bar a girl with glasses and curly hair is there ready at my service. When taking care of me she made great conversation and made me feel like a part of the stewed cow family. I never had to ask for a refill or sauce , she was very attentive. The food is delicious so it is definitely going to be an every Friday grub on meal!
2019-01-26,1,Decided on burgers for lunch on a Saturday with a group of friends. Unfortunately we had a horrible experience from the get go. Aside from the college bar smell when you first walk in, the hostess was nowhere to be found. Once in contact with the staff, they were rude and unaccommodating and did not offer us a seat or wait time. I'm not a stickler for customer service, but I've never been treated with such disinterest at any restaurant (high end or not). I was looking forward to finding a good burger spot for future get togethers, but the Stewed Cow is not it!
2019-01-26,1,We just went into this establishment with my coworkers and we were significantly disappointed. There was no hostess in the front and there was no one we could have asked so we assumed that we needed to seat ourselves considering we were there with no assistance for a few minutes. This woman with curly hair who works there all of a sudden appeared and told us with a nasty attitude that they are not a self-serving establishment (could have fooled us considering how much they were inattentive to who was walking in) and that we needed to get out of the table since it was reserved. She did not apologize and didn't offer to seat us elsewhere so we left. Never coming back again.
2019-01-26,1,Customer service is everything. At the Stewed Cow it is not. Walked in with my fellow hospital coworkers, and waited to be seated. However, no hostess was there and we assumed we could seat ourselves. We were unsure, but presumed since no worker was in sight that it was self seating. We sat down and settled down. Suddenly, this obnoxious curly, brown-haired waitress came literally yelling at us so rudely. She yelled despite my coworkers explaining no one was in the front. The waitress was unapologetic and her attitude was disgusting. We were excited to try this place out, but the 5 of us will never come back. She did not even try to accommodate us or give us a wait time. The owners should consider hiring pleasant staff. So disappointing.
2019-01-26,1,Just came in with a few coworkers. Walked in with no greeting or hostess at the stand. We waited around for a few minutes. It was our first time here so we thought maybe we had to seat ourselves since no one was at the front. We sat at a table and a woman came up to us with long, brown and curly hair- with an immediate attitude. We apologized and said no one was at the hostess stand and she still continued with an attitude how she had the table set for nine people, reserved. We left immediately and will never come back. What a disgrace.
2019-01-20,2,Not bad inside but it advertises itself as a country bar but all I heard was hip hop and slow R&B, asked the manager and she was less than responsive, borderline annoyed I even asked about it. Not worth the trip.
2019-01-13,4,This is a great place for brunch. Food is great, nice size portions and reasonably priced. The drinks are a bit watered down but still good. I would definitely recommend this place. I think their wind are popular because I saw many people eating them & they looked and smelled amazing.
2019-01-07,4,Excellent food and fun atmosphere.  Michelle is the best bartender and tons of fun!  The food is excellent and I have been here several times and have not had a bad meal.  There is an excellent beer selection on tap and an amazing liquor selection as well! They even have a mechanical bull on weekends!
2019-01-02,5,Best brunch deal in Hoboken and delicious food!
2018-12-09,4,One of our go-to bars. Food choices are fairly limited but if you'll eat a burger or chicken, you're set. Burgers are high quality and fries are galore - regular, sweet potato, and tots! Drink selection is fine, nothing special. Vibe is fun, country (given away by the bull in the back...).
2018-12-01,5,Every time I visit Hoboken, I make sure to visit The Stewed Cow for brunch. The main entrees for brunch are hearty and delicious, the perfect recipe for a hangover cure. Today I got the Roadside platter. It was big fire. Great place to brunch and watch some college football.
2018-11-29,4,Super chill vibe, nice staff. The drinks are delicious and prices for both drinks and food are average. We ordered the Mac n cheese, it's baked and pretty good. The chili, comes with chips, it's super good! Loaded tater tots, really good. Deviled eggs were good. Flank steak tacos were tasty but a bit dry. The Mexican Mickey D burger, was ah-ma-zing so much flavor and spicy ! The bullseye burger was also amazing, though not as spicy as the mickey. The Texas big mouth had great flavor, but lacked sauce, a bit on the dry side. Finally, for food, the short rib and pasta, flavor is definitely there, short rib is good, however, too much pasta. This caused the dish to be on the dry side. I would def have this dish if it didn't have the pasta, or had 75% less of it, making the short rib the star. For drinks, tried the autumn pear, delicious! I would come back.
2018-11-25,4,Really great dinner spot! Brunch is good for. big group but dinner is pretty intimate and loud ! But super fun texas style food in a sports bar atmosphere. Buffalo wings were amazing && so is the brisket platter
2018-11-17,3,Amazing selection of bourbon. Definitely one of the best in NJ. The biggest problem is they do not have prices on the menu.  Find that shady.
2018-11-03,2,The service was subpar. We had to wait over 20 min for our drinks, another 35-40 for food and one of the orders was completely forgotten about. The flank steak tacos tasted like beef jerky in a tortilla with the same texture/consistency of it. Would not recommend not return to.
2018-09-30,4,Great spot for Sunday football. Brunch was $22 which included 2 cocktails. I highly recommend the manmosa, it's better than a mimosa! It had blue moon beer, vodka, OJ & sprite. You'll definitely feel a nice buzz after drinking two. I had the skirt steak and it was yummy! The French fries are the bomb! Definitely will come back (:
2018-09-27,4,Came here one night with friends, YOU HAVE TO GET ON THE BULL!Three of us started with the sliders, the signature wings, and loaded tots. The portions were decent so we ended up also ordering the jalapeño poppers and the nachos with brisket. All good bar food.The service was decent, my other friend ordered a cheeseburger and they left the cheese off and another order a different entree and the waitress never put it in. Well probably be back just for fun.
2018-08-03,1,My roommates and I went here for restaurant week expecting a great experience, but unfortunately that was not the case. The food was mediocre, but the bad service is why I'm here writing this review. Not only did it take 10 minutes to be greeted for our drink order, but my friend's meal was delayed 10-15 minutes and by the time she had gotten her dinner, we all had already been done eating. Not to mention, her fish was not cooked the way she had asked.After about 20 minutes of staring at our dirty dishes and empty water glasses, we asked the manager to please clear our table and bring out the dessert. Keep in mind, our waitress walked passed us and the dirty dishes minimum 10 times proceeding to do nothing. The only time the waitress came over to us was when we had gotten our check and the meal was over. I was expecting to enjoy a nice night out with my friends, but that was not the case and needless to say, I will not be returning to The Stewed Cow.
2018-07-24,2,Have been to this bar a few times and thought it was a good bar. Tonight, our service was subpar. Our dinner took an hour to come out after we ordered it. We actually ended up asking for it to go since it was a Tuesday and also 8:45. (BTW- our order was a burger and a chicken club-def not that difficult) Also, we originally came here for Taco Tuesday but they weren't acknowledging that tonight. The waitress was nice, but the overall management needs a major evaluation. They should read some of their reviews and actually change things. Won't be back for food service.
2018-07-24,4,The best restaurant week deal!! I love the cocktails and the servers are always courteous.
2018-07-24,1,Waited for a long time for a waitress to take our drink order. We came because on their website states: Happy Hour 5-8, we arrived at 7 were told their website is incorrect and it ended at 7...they wouldn't honor what their website promoted. Next, we ordered jalapeno poppers. I really don't know how you can mess these up, but somehow they did. We were served 4 tiny poppers, which were left in the fryer too long, then brought to us cold, so as you can imagine, it was like biting into a spicy rock. My friend ordered the burger, asked for Medium Rare, but came out Well Done. I've never seen him not finish a burger, but he barely chomped through half. I ordered the flank steak tacos, which were fine at best. Probably not coming back.
2018-07-15,4,We went for Sunday brunch, food was really delicious! Good for a lazy Sunday brunch spot, chill with TVs all around for any game event. We went for FIFa world cup day and it was full but not overly crowded like the other places in town. Service was good! Overall good experience.
2018-06-12,5,This place is great! Delicious appetizers, good drink specials. Neat hangout place after work with friends. Nice and welcoming staff.
2018-06-04,2,I wanted to go for Sunday brunch, and ride the mechanical bull, but apparently the rides are only for Friday& Saturday nights. What a totally bummer!
2018-05-26,2,Not much of a whiskey gal, so it was not enjoyable. The staff was ok, pleasant and helpful. I had a gentleman server, he was pretty helpful. Best part was riding the bull. Great first time experience for me. I had the steak tacos, just piled high with cut cabbage and no sauce. I took a look at the pics her for the food, and mine certainly looked A LOT DIFFERENT. Smh. I guess things r just a hit or miss sometimes.
2018-05-14,1,This legit was the worst day of my life. Me and my friends went here for Sunday brunch. I was so excited for a cheat meal. Fast forward - we had three servers trying to figure out how to do their jobs. I ordered sangria and it was literally orange juice mixed with cranberry juice (no fruit, no wine, etc.). I NEVER, LIKE NEVER complain/send back food/drinks but this tasted like pure vomit and I just couldn't stomach it. The brunch deal came with a pastry basket and free oatmeal. We had to ask for the pastry basket literally 11 times before it came out 45 minutes later. It was not even pastries, it was like some cardboard from the discount section in the grocery store where the items are about to be spoiled. It tasted like disappointment and weeds. I ordered the burger, which was literally inedible. It was hard as a ROCK with not an ounce of juice, cooked till it was brown all the way through (I ordered it medium). My friend went to use the restroom, and said there was a hole punched through the door and smelly VOMIT spewing out of the trash can from the night before probably. Literally so unsanitary and disgusting. They also mischarged us on the bill! I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. This place is vile.
2018-04-23,5,Hands down one of the best spots in Hoboken. It's a hidden gem, set back from Washington. The Stewed Cow is a prime brunch spot with an awesome deal. $20 for two drinks, oatmeal, pastries, and a HUGE entre. All parts are absolutely delicious. If you're going to hang out for the night, the drinks are fairly priced, delicious, and enjoyable. Dinner is also a great meal. The pulled pork sandwich is AMAZING, but then again, so is everything on the menu. Enjoy yourself here. The food, service, atmosphere and drinks are top quality and of the best in Hoboken. Enjoy!!
2018-04-07,1,Went for a friend's bday party and we had a good time, but no thanks to the food. We had a huge party and they were not able to accommodate, which is understandable since we came here on a Friday night.  Nonetheless, the staff was personable and understanding.  We eventually got a couple tables and sat separately.  They had a wonderful beer selection which is a plus, and the bartender allowed "sampling" of beers upon request.  The food on the other hand was a BUST. We ordered the campfire nachos, chicken tenders, and the artichoke dip.  The artichoke dip was pretty good, but nothing special.  Reminded me of store-bought dip (which it probably was).  The campfire nachos were simple potato chips and they managed to burn them (WTF).  Additionally, the "toppings" (ie. bacon, sour cream) were extremely lacking.  Maybe had two chips worth of toppings, which is laughable.  The chicken tenders came out on a platter that looked so sad; it looked like a primary school lunch (lol).  However, we didn't let the food get us down and eventually had a good time, but no thanks to the Stewed Cow.  Many other "lesser" bars are actually on par with this restaurant, so look elsewhere unless you're obsessed with riding the mechanical bull.
2018-04-03,1,I am in disbelief at how awful my brunch was here. I'm a local so we come here to drink from time to time but wanted to try their brunch. We had to ask 5 or 6 times for the muffin and pastry basket, which was literally just bread when it finally arrived. The food was just alright, they burnt my friend's burger when she ordered it medium, but nothing to write home about at all. We did the brunch special which came with two drinks, and they for some reason charged me for my meal and a drink, while they charged everyone else the brunch special. The waitress was no where to be found during the entire meal, and we had to chase them down to correct the bill. Once we were ready to pay, she walked past us 3 times without asking if we were ready. We were planning to pay by card and tip cash but that was the last straw and we paid the bill amount and left (something I have never done). It was such horrific service that I was actually offended, and will not be going back.
2018-03-26,1,Don't WASTE YOUR TIME here!!  The long wait for the table wasn't worth it. Very bad service and food was cold and lousy. When we politely complained to the manager, she was rude, disrespectful, and obnoxious to us. We understand places can have an "OFF" night but if they don't fire that manager, this place is going to be OFF Everyone's list!!!!!  Don't go don't go don't go. Try the place down the block. Save yourself some aggravation.
2018-03-23,1,Do NOT go here. The servers are absolutely horrible. They are incredibly disrespectful and rude. The manger is no better. A large group of my friends decided to try this place out for a friend's bday. we were kicked out because we didn't order food and then denied service when wanting to order food.  They ruined what should've been a really fun night out of celebration. This place will ruin your night. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.
2018-02-23,4,This is my local bar, they have a good selection of beer and food and a wonderful selection of scotch.I have eaten here once and had a burger all good nothing special, but solid bar food at a reasonable price.They have a mechanical bull that can be entertaining when lots of people get involved.Go keep the local spots open
2018-02-22,1,As Hoboken residents, we used to be long time customers, but after this horrible incident, we haven't been back.We came in on a Sunday afternoon and ordered "the infamous SC quesadilla."  To our surprise, the quesadilla arrived burnt with no guac, no sour cream, and just the pico de gallo dumped on top.  Shocked by the lack of toppings, we asked the server if she could send us the guac and sour cream that were supposed to come with the meal.  Eventually, she took our plate to the back only to return with the side condiments well after the quesadilla was already cold.We didn't want to eat a soggy, cold quesadilla that had been sitting around for 15 minutes, so we sent it back and asked for another one.This is where things went from bad to worse. Rather then send us a fresh quesadilla, they sent us a reheated rendition of the quesadilla we just sent back. It was pretty obvious -- the quesadilla arrived even more burnt than before and with marks where the pico de gallo used to be. Wtf?! I'm completely offended that the Stewed Cow thought it was acceptable to deliver us the soggy, burnt quesadilla we had already sent back.We told our server what happened and she promised to send over the manager. Instead, the manager walked right by us with no acknowledgment. Appalled by the horrible service, we promptly left.Last time for that!
2018-02-13,3,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5. Steak tacos had flavor with lots of crunch coming from the cabbage. Brisket was tender and went well with the crispy tater tot hash and juicy Texas greens. The plating was pretty questionable though as everything was piled on top of each other on a small plate. It also could've used some more BBQ sauce. Warm cookie dough was rich and sweet with the ice cream adding that creamy goodness.Service - 1/5. Slow. Very, very slow. I must have waited 30 minutes between courses. I try my best to be patient but this was too much and it didn't help that no one explained why there was such a delay for the food.Value - 3/5. The food is good and a three course dinner for $20 is a great deal. However, waiting so long for the food to come out was a bad experience and makes you rethink visiting again.Parking - Street (Free)
2018-02-10,1,The absolute worst experience thus far this year with dining out. I can still smell the charred dried tasteless ribs on my fingers and I've washed my hands now four times. I smell the shit in my hair and on my clothes and now have to take a shower to wash away my bad decision tonight. And to top it off the one thing we went there for never came out of the kitchen after asking repeated times for it. Will never eat there again. Should have went to McDonald's to curb my craving for burgers. I wish I could give this place 5 thumbs down.
2018-01-28,4,Had an incident here and the manager Steve handled it very professionally. Thank you.
2017-12-10,3,Really Promising,   But wine one tell me why having Nachos with Potato Chips is a good idea?  Decent flavor with the brisket and bacon but seriously ....get the tortilla chips in there.
2017-11-11,1,First off....the staff is MISERABLE...all they pay attention to is the music which belongs in a NIGHT CLUB or better yet a STRIP JOINT! They don't smile unless  a song they like comes on...they don't ask if you want another you have to ask . They don't ask how's your food,  you have to actually ask them for ketchup., for a BURGER, Really!??!! And when you return half your sandwich and cold fries they don't even ask if everything was ok....pathetic! Will not recommend or ever come back...too many GREAT PLACES in area to waste your time at this place....its more of a tourist attraction! Enough said!
2017-10-29,5,The wings are to die for! The Mac and cheese is great too. Great ambiance with a mechanical bull in the back. Great place to have appetizers and drinks with friends or a full dinner for date night.
2017-10-18,4,Upscale bar food, huge portions, great brunch selection, mechanical bull. Definitely gets crowded and worth a little wait.
2017-09-30,5,Sooo impressed with the weekend brunch menu. Great value. I had the steak sandwich and it was delicious! The fries were a 10! Drinks were great. Really fun atmosphere- I will certainly be going back!
2017-09-10,3,Came here on a weekend morning while waiting for an event to start nearby. The place certainly does a bustling business for brunch.  So much so, that we had a hard time getting the bartender's attention to order beverages.  We had time for two, but had to settle for one because he couldn't get the bartender back to reorder.The food looked good, but we never tried it.The place is certainly geared to a twenty-something crowd, which is not a negative thing.  I'm just not sure if it's a place I'll be running to visit again.
2017-09-09,5,I think I've ordered the same meal from TheStewed Cow for 10 weeks. Jambalaya and a half rack of Chipotle Ribs. The Jambalaya is heaven. Like Bourbon Street right here in Hoboken. The Chipotle Ribs are perfect. Perfect. I do delivery. Someday I need to stop by.   9/8/2017 - updated review. Food amazing. Nice selection of craft beers, love the interior. Welcoming yet allowed privacy. 9 times wonderful. I'll be back
2017-08-28,4,Stopped in for a quick drink.  It was pretty empty they had just opened.  The bartender was very nice.  She made me a old fashioned which was great.  She muddled it an orange and cherry and gave a good pour of whiskey.  The cherry that she topped it with was a treat as well.  My brother ordered a manhattan.  It was awesome as well.  They had a bull in the back which seems like it would be a fun time.  All in all i will come back her at night and check out the music and crowd one night.
2017-08-22,5,Great service. Great bourbon selection. Huge ice cubes (awesome if you love your bourbon not watered down). Kids eat free on Tuesday. Did I mention great service? Excellent
2017-08-12,4,We'll start with delivery. - Good selection of items - Burgers don't disappoint.  Will fill you up. - Fries could be better, wish they had shoestring fries.- Wings are tasty but better in person.- Onion strings are good but don't eat too much you'll regret it. - Be aware that everything is sent in plastic so the food does steam itself, may come soggy if your the last order.Eat Out- Tons of bourbon to choose from. Found so new favorites after trying some of their recommendations. - All the apps are good but get the wings, calamari, or bourbon chili. - Fried chicken is worth it. - Salads are big and loaded up. - Desert, just save room and go with the fried Oreos. Trust me.
2017-08-10,4,Nice place with a small outside area.The whiskey selection is big which prob. makes it a great spot for those who like to drink whiskey.The choice of beers isn't that big but still good enough and everybody should be able to find some.Talking about food I can't complain at all. The quality was great and the staff super friendly.Big tv's behind the bar makes it a great place to watch any sports events.Definitely recommended!
2017-08-09,4,Great, low key spot in Hoboken! Came for the brunch package, $20 per person for two drinks and an entree. The cocktail selection was a nice variety, as they had more to offer than just the typical mimosa and Bellini. My husband loved his manmosa and I had a white sangria and red sangria. The drinks did take a while to come to us, which I'm not sure why since there really weren't that many people there. The sangrias could've been mixed better and virtually no fruit but they were OK. We both had steak and eggs, very good but portions were a tad small. Also, not sure why everyone was raving about the pastry basket-we were given two small cold pieces cornbread and two pieces of some cake? lol I could've went without. The package also included "sumpthin from the house" which was two servings of rice pudding-weird but okay. Overall good value for when you want brunch without the fuss.
2017-07-19,4,The Stewed Cow is a good Hoboken bar. It has nice and long happy hour deals and the Nachos (made with chips) were very good.The atmosphere is inviting an the bartenders were friendly.I will definitely be going back!
2017-07-08,4,Great beer selection.Awesome brunch spot and deal.Outdoor seating.Food is good. Try the "Redneck Taco" at brunch!
2017-06-03,3,This is a local neighborhood bar.  They are more of a whiskey focused bar, they definitely focus on the brown liquors. They do have a mechanical bull on site, which is fun. It usually runs on the weekends and they have an MC that coordinates. The food is solid. I had the the nachos and they were pretty good. A very solid 4. The service is good, not great but good. The issue was they have barely any acceptable tequila. The best was Jose Cuervo silver and I literally couldn't drink it. They were kind enough to take it off the bill but really they should have at least one decent tequila.  They are a bar, even a patron silver would do. I'm not expecting Don Julio 1942. I haven't been back since, or drank tequila since ... still trying to recover from the experience but I will go back again once the trauma wears off. To address the owners response.. I specifically asked for other types of tequila because I have had Patron silver in the past but I was told the order hasn't come in.... what I had was the best they had.
2017-05-31,3,Enjoyed my visit here on a Sunday afternoon. It was relatively empty and the servers leave you alone for he most part, so I enjoyed my time with my friends just chatting away.i was a bit confused at the menu, because it doesn't list the exact pricing of each item...But the Omelet was extremely delicious! Perfectly seasoned.They also offered some complimentary dishes that I was also confused about. They gave us each an omelet with some chocolate chips on top as well as some pastries. Both were mediocre but better than nothing!Very cute place if you would like to take pictures, grab a meal or drinks.
2017-05-13,5,I've been to the bar a bunch, and it's a good spot for a drink. Haven't really given much thought of eating there though. Ordered delivery from them, and it was great. Ordered burger, chicken fingers, fries and everything came quickly enough that it was warm and crispy and not at all soggy. Will order again.
2017-04-30,2,I found this to be just ok. The service wasn't very good. The brunch special is a good deal, the drinks were very good, but I was not impressed with the food. I had the turkey burger, I wouldn't recommend it. Others seemed to like their food but it was nothing spectacular. I don't think I'd go back.
2017-04-29,4,Good brunch package:$20 for 2 alcohol drinks, pastry and main course. Servicer was nice, drinks are pretty good. Pastry is not bad. Main course is good as well. Food comes up pretty quick. Overall is above average.
2017-04-13,5,Lasted 22 seconds on the bull, so I'm pretty proud of myself. Drinks were good and strong. Good work happy hour, wish I tried the food.
2017-04-09,4,I was there around 7 pm or something like that for happy hour, they had half price for draughts and wines. It was a great deal for happy hour ! It's more of a restaurant at that time, and the mechanical bull doesn't start working until later in the night. Further place from most bars in Hoboken is the only con.
2017-04-03,5,This place is amazing! I came here this past Saturday at 2:15 PM with a group of nine people for my birthday and we were able to do their $20 brunch deal that ends at 3.  Our server was awesome, she was so attentive and so sweet, the food came out so quickly and drinks as well even though the bar was pretty packed. The atmosphere is really fun and I loved all the natural lighting. They have a mechanical bull in the back and apparently during brunch it's not open to the public but an entire party booked it special and our table was front row to watch people fall lol! I really enjoyed this place, great staff, great food, definitely recommend it for a cheap party brunch in Hoboken.!
2017-03-21,3,place is cool if you are looking for a chill place for a drink and some food. Cant say anything about the food since i didnt try it this time around but service and drinks were good.
2016-10-24,1,wish I could give zero stars. ordered mac and cheese on seamless but for some reason received nothing more than plain pasta with a few pieces of cheddar cheese on top. who tf messes up mac and cheese like that
2016-10-12,5,Hands down favorite brunch spot in Hoboken! The staff is great, the food is great, and the deal is great! $20 gets you two breakfast cocktails, a basket of pastries for the table, a small appetizer surprise (usually seasonal fruit or oatmeal), and a brunch entree! The menu is creative with country/cowboy inspired meals such as a a red neck taco made with Carolina pulled pork served over a bacon pancake with eggs or Road Kill Platter made with brisket, bacon and biscuits. Have been here in both big groups, small, on a date, and have even brought my mom! I have always been satisfied with the experience with little to no wait time on both Saturday and Sunday. During NFL season the place does get packed and loud on Sunday afternoons so keep that in mind if looking for a quitter spot for a date or to bring a parent!The staff at stewed cow including the waiters, bars tenders, and hostesses are all great!! Have been here on plenty of weeknights for a drink before and after my sports league as well! The bar has a good beer selection and a super extensive whiskey selection if that's your thing!
2016-10-03,3,Yesterday a few of us went to the Stewed Cow to watch the 4 games. We have been here a few times before and have always had a good experience. At around 5:30 the bartenders started to clean . They were using heavy duty cleaning supplies. We had to open the front door and leave it propped open to try to get rid of the smell. My husband developed a migrane and left at 6:45 I left soon after. We understand that the bar needs to be cleaned but shouldn't it be done after paying customers had left . When we asked why they were cleaning now we were told, " bc we clean on Sunday" don't think we can come back on a Sunday!
2016-08-21,4,Note- this review is only for the brunch, can't speak to what it's like on a Saturday night. For brunch though, it has to be one of the best deals in Hoboken- for $20 you get two brunch cocktails (Bloody Mary, mimosa, manmosa, etc) and an entree. My friends and I have had pretty much everything and can't complain about any of them. Compared to the other sports bars in town that flip over to "brunch" spots, this is way better and for $20, the value really can't be beat.
2016-08-07,4,When I walked into The Stewed Cow and they had Zac Brown Band playing I immediately knew I would like this bar!PROS: Free mechanical bull rides!             They play everything from country music to oldies rock & roll which I liked!!           They have a full bar, some specialty cocktails and a pretty good menu (next time I come I'll have to try the food) everything is fairly priced           The bouncer is hilarious. The waitresses and bartenders are all wicked friendly too            All around good vibes and a good crowdI can't think of any cons right now lol. Go here! It's a fun bar in Hoboken!! And who offers mechanical bull rides for free?! Come just for that!
2016-07-23,5,Digging the vibe and scene I'm the middle of Hoboken on a 98 degree summer day. All good here. People walking by, locals, day drinkers, etc. fun crowd, young couples and a cute bartender named Kaitlyn. Mmmm .
2016-07-06,5,Mark your calendars and your route when you are out and about in Hoboken. This is a must. Similar to the feel Cheers gave Norm and Cliffy in 90's television NBC hit. You will return again and again. Appetizers excite the senses, bartenders make you smile and are always attentive to your needs ( even when you have a fourteen month in tow)! Burgers are awesome. Try it all and come back for more.I will miss you all!
2016-07-05,2,The atmosphere of the bar is not bad but the mechanical bull operator (at least the one who operated it on the night of 6/25/16) refused to let the guys stay on the ride longer than 1 second. No exaggeration. When one of our friends first got knocked off immediately we laughed and just thought he was bad at it but then it happened to every single guy who rode it. On the other hand, he let the girls ride it for substantially longer and actually have fun with it. I'm not sure why they think that's okay but it's not cool. Everyone should be able to have a good time.
2016-06-12,4,We're Moooooved to Come BackEvent:  Saturday night on the town and the Mrs and I felt like getting stewed over dinner. This seemed like a good fit given the name and close proximity to SW Hoboken.  Good ambiance, particularly in late afternoon and early evening, and I like the saloon feel at nightFood:  We thought the food was pretty good and the custom drinks were an even bigger hit.  The nacho plate (made of potato chips, brisket, bacon, cheese and bbq sauce) was a really solid starter.  My wife raved about her salad and my burger (infused with bacon) was executed well, although not over the top,and the fries were addicting.  In total we tried 4 of their custom drinks, and the Georgia Peach and Stewed Palmer were perfect refreshing summer cocktails.  Service:  No issues, no problems.  Friendly server had the right balance of when to check in and let us sit, food wasn't overly rushed nor delayed.  Bottom line:  Everything we had was at minimum good with a few pleasant surprises.  There were a lot more things on the menu that looked interesting, so this may only be scratching the surface.  We will be back for more, maybe we'll ride the bull...
2016-05-23,4,Cool spot. When I came here at around 11PM on a Saturday night it wasn't massively overcrowded, they were playing good country music, and everyone seemed friendly. They've got a long bar, so getting a drink isn't too tough, and the mechanical bull is a fun added bonus if you're feeling like it.As for drinks, they've got a fantastic selection of bourbon and whisky. They've got the staple beers as well as a few good crafts. I enjoyed it here and I'd make it a spot on my next night out. Especially if I'm with someone who hasn't ridden a mechanical bull before.
2016-05-20,5,One of the funnest bars in Hoboken. Amazing bourbon selection. Great food. Mechanical bull on the weekends is great although the operator makes it significantly more difficult for men than women to stay on. Why can't we all ride at the same speed?
2016-05-14,5,I came here for brunch on a Saturday. The food was SO good. The service was good and it wasn't too crowded. The brunch deal is unbeatable. Definitely a go to brunch spot in Hoboken.
2016-05-10,5,I visited this place with my girlfriend on a Saturday night and was pleasantly surprised.The Good:  Most of it.  We had a quesadilla, a bowl of their Andouille gumbo and a whiskey flight (yes, they have those!).  Quesadilla was nice but not mind-blowingly good.  Gumbo was terrific, and with the addition of a little tabasco was the best of its kind I've had in a while.  They have eight different kinds of whiskey flights, which range in price from 18 to 40 dollars or so.  We got the 10-year flight, which set us back $26, I think.  Went 3-for-4 on those, and she was extremely pleased with the variety.The Bad:  I had some kind of boozy moonshine and strawberry puree drink that was just a little light on the 'shine.  Didn't really detract from my enjoyment of everything else, though.The Ugly:  I'm only sorry I was there too early to see anyone get chucked off the mechanical bull they have in the back.The Verdict:  Absolutely would recommend.  Go check this place out for yourself.
2016-05-07,3,It's a small place but not unpleasant. Food is about average.  They have a nice s lectionaries of bourbons.  Parking as you would expect is at a premium in Hoboken so parking at the deck is a must. I'd go back
2016-04-25,3,I've been here on multiple occasions, for both brunch and at night.Brunch: It was $20 for an entree and two brunch cocktails, and it came with a basket of muffins/breads and stuff for the table. The drinks are pretty good - especially the manmosa, which had vodka and is stronger than the mimosa. Yum. Definitely would recommend. The food is alright, nothing special. It's cool they have brunch - it's nice if you live nearby, but I wouldn't make the trek here just for the food if I didn't live close. If you're looking for the boozy brunch experience, you can probably find places more worth your money in NYC, just a short train ride away. However, this place isn't bad, although it's not your typical brunch spot, and your choices are limited in Hoboken. If you're really trying to booze up your brunch, just order a few more manmosas or a bunch of the beers they have on draft :)Night: They have a mechanical bull. Pretty sure it's the only place in Hoboken you can find one of these. It's pretty fun if you're in the mood for a more adventurous sort of night. Despite the bull, The Stewed Cow has a pretty low key, chill vibe. This place doesn't get too crowded at night - probably because of its location (kind of far from the main road compared to the other bars) and its vibe. If you're looking for a more chill spot to drink, this is your place.
2016-04-23,5,Wait there was a mechanical bull? I'm a semi-serious whiskey drinker so you can imagine how my eyes light up to probably the best American Whiskey selection I've seen in Jersey. Sat down on a random Saturday to see the Rangers start the summer and the staff let my friend and I create our own Whiskey flights with some guidance: I particularly enjoyed the Jefferson Ocean Aged Bourbon, the Kings County Chocolate and the High West Western Oat each which had really delicious and distinct tastes of spice/caramel, chocolate and blueberry respectively. It's great to have a staff that actually can recommend the right spirit for the flavors you enjoy.In addition we had the Texas Barn Burger and wings both were great and I like can't feel my face spicy and that's really the first time I've had a burger on the border of that. And after all of that when I got the bill I almost had to do a double take on how affordable it was compared to my regular city drinking. Will definitely make a point to swing by more often.
2016-04-22,4,Hands down best Brunch deal in town. Pretty biased since I live so close but hey its a damn good deal. Two drinks, an entree, a item from the house and a pastry basket for $20? Plus the drinks are nice sized. Try the Manmosa for something new.
2016-04-18,4,A little Hoboken gem!! I am on an ABL softball team and we've been coming here before and after our games each week. The place is adorable (looks like they have great brunch although I never tried). They have cold PBR which you don't find everywhere these days! The bartenders have always been friendly !!
2016-04-13,4,I like the Stewed Cow for many reasons. It's a spacious place with a clear Western theme. There is a lot of room at the bar and plenty of bar tables. The back room features not a restaurant, but a mechanical bull for those courageous enough. It's a great alternative to the wine bar movement that is growing.The happy hour drink specials for beer and wine cannot be beat. Have bar food in mind and you'll be satisfied with the cuisine. I had the pulled pork sandwich and sweet potato fries and no complaints here. And most important,  the bartender was extremely professional and helpful for a first-timer at this location. Plenty of large-screen sports watching, it's that sort of place/crowd. 7 blocks off of Washington Street so expect a good amount of locals on the weekdays.  A solid first experience and I'll check it out again soon to watch a little baseball.
2016-04-07,5,Better late than never!I celebrated my bday in Nov. and I'm going back because I'm craving their buffalo calamari and their sweet potato fries & their cheesy tater-tots...  My friends love their food!The ambience was calm, then the DJ came and we turned it into a party. We all enjoyed getting on the bull. Tho I wish the guy behind the control took it easy lol... The drinks were great, too. The staff was nice as well. I liked that my friends didn't complain about a thing. So we are going back!The only thing that sucked is parking but it's Hoboken.
2016-04-04,4,This western-influenced whiskey bar is a great place to catch the game, meet up with friends, or grab a bite to eat. When my wife and I lived in Hoboken, Stewed Cow was one our most frequented locations. The wings are excellent. The burgers are solid and Stewed Cow might be Hoboken's premiere purveyor of America's signature brown liquor. Even if you aren't a big whiskey drinker, their selection of draft beer is more than enough to satisfy any reasonable patron. The mechanical bull is a fun attraction - the type of quirky recreation that the east coast bar scene could use more of. The next time I'm in the neighborhood you can bet I'll stop by the stewed cow.
2016-03-06,3,Good place to get a drink, wouldn't bring a date though unless she's someone who likes to ride mechanical bulls.  I didn't see that in use though, would like to see it, will probably come back another time.
2016-02-16,3,At about $1 per wing, the prices are a bit steep considering their malnourished, shriveled appearance and dry texture. I've only tried the wings but have done so on several occasions. Service has been friendly:
2016-02-11,5,This place is great.  The burgers are really good and they have a good appetizer selection.  The environment is always good in there and they have nice TV's for sports.  The staff is also very friendly and accommodating.  The only thing I would like to see an improvement on is some additions to their menu.  I feel like the need some additional wraps, fajitas or even some soup.  But that's only a minor gripe.  I recommend checking it out!
2016-02-06,3,I was excited to try this place.  Overall it was just ok for me. Nothing really too special except for the prohibition pig cocktail (bacon bourbon, apple liquor, lemon juice) I had which was very interesting. My friend an I ordered as an appetizer the spicy pimento crab dip. I love crab dip..but this crab dip was hmm very different. It was really thin/liquidy. It should be a little more thick, it was hard to scoop up. The flavor was there though, just not the consistency. It was served with pita chips which I guessed were homemade, and they were hard as a rock, could chip a tooth with those things haha. As my entree I ordered the southwestern burger (topped with cheddar, avocado, Chipotle lime vinegrette ) it was very tasty. I chose a side of tater tots, your pretty average frozen tots, not homemade. As my first drink I had a beer, the Brooklyn sorachie ace saison. I was feeling the flavor but sadly it might have been to carbonated and hoppy for me, it gave me heartburn and the only bloat gas I must have burped a hundred times haha, but as far as that beer they can't help it, they didn't make it. So after a couple of hours and I finally felt better , then ordered my cocktail. The prohibition pig as I stated above. It has a smokey bacon flavor to it at first but when I stirred it well then I could taste the apple liquor. The place seemed to be busy and packed for a couple of hours and then it emptied out pretty quickly around midnight..it was strange. The DJ plays random music, I don't know maybe it's just me but I'm not a fan of hip hop, and then the going back and forth from that to country music was odd. Oh and they have a mechanical bull if you're interested in riding, thought that was cool.
2016-01-26,4,Man, was I totally surprised at the great Brunch deal!! Two drinks, oatmeal, assorted pastries, and an entree all for $20. All of my brunch reviews start with a Bloody Mary, and this was no different. With my brunch deal I ordered the Fat Cow sandwich which had sausage, red peppers, onions, potatoes and a fried egg on top. Couldn't finish the whole thing but left with great leftovers. Not the greatest quality but definitely a go-to place from now on.
2016-01-24,3,The location is very low on seats, so wait times can be a bit of a drag. Food was amazing, and MOST of the staff are friendly. I would highly suggest that management implement some type of timed seating limit during brunch hours, similar to other brunch spots, so that wait times for other guests are not excessive. I've seen people actually leave this place because of the long wait times.
2016-01-16,4,Food, drinks, and a bull...what more do you need in a restaurant. They had a large large with a long list of beers and wines. There were also some signature cocktails that looked good.The food had options for everyone. From tacos to burgers to Mac and cheese to make your own salad. I had a burger that was good but nothing I would have to return for. It's a fun place because they have a mechanical bull too. So I thought it was a nice touch to keep people after dinner but also just a fun and different feature to have. Parking takes away from me returning. You can't find street parking so be prepared for the garage near by which was $16 for 4 hours. I guess this is normal for the area, but still takes away because there isn't anything else near by to walk to if you were to bar hop.
2016-01-12,5,I don't really have anything bad to say about this place. We came in as a group of 7 during brunch at around 11:30 am on a Saturday and got seated immediately. Quick, friendly, and attentive service. They have a brunch special for $20 that includes two drinks of your choice (you can mix and match), pastries, oatmeal, and an entree. Extremely filling. I got the Skirt Steak Sandwich and paired it with a Bloody Mary and a Palmer iced tea (forgot the exact name of it). I really recommend the iced tea. The fries were also one of my favorites. It came with the skirt steak sandwich and was well seasoned and thick. If you're around the area and are looking for a boozy brunch, stop by here!
2016-01-06,4,This place is a pretty typical dive bar and, for a place not on Washington, tends to get pretty packed during peak hours (Thursday, Fri, Sat nights and Sunday days). Their food is great, especially the tater tots, and they have a decent beer selection.The thing I really appreciate (as a Texan transplanted to Hoboken) is the mechanical bull, which is free to ride and adds some fun competition near the end of a night out! I bring people here for that alone.
2016-01-03,4,Have been here a few times, for Football Sunday brunch. They get super packed for 1:00 games, but are a good time!$20 brunch special includes 2 drinks (mimosa, manmosa, Bloody Mary, beer, sangria), pastrey basket for table, small oatmeal appetizer, and choice of entree. They offer additional football specials such as beer pitchers ($9-$12) and apps ($15 for large sampler of wings, chicken fingers, jalapeño poppers). Drinks and food are both enjoyable. Service is great as well. Once my group was accidentally skipped over on the waiting list, so they brought us 2 free pitchers of beer while we waited. Another time we were waiting for a table for close to an hour, which caused us to be seated after the brunch hours, but we were still allowed the brunch special. Would recommend Stewed Cow as a fun place to watch the games! If you want a table for kickoff, you must get there early. Otherwise prepare to watch the 1st half from the bar, as this is a very popular spot!
2016-01-02,5,Awesome brunch deal * $20 for a basket of pastries, an entree and 2 drinks. The Mimosa and Bloody Mary were both great as well as the Skirt Steak Burger entree. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. I will definitely be back again.
2015-12-17,1,I've been dying to find good bbq in Jersey for a while now and the search is still on. I gave this place 4 separate occasions to impress me with their food and my disappointment increased with each new outing. I've had everything from the dry steak tacos, to the absolutely horrible, disgusting gumbo, to the bourbon-less(more like sweet off brand cheap ketchup) wings, even their brisket was just "mehhh". I lost all hope for this place after the disappointing wings, if you can't even make decent bbq wing sauce just give up. If anyone knows of a great bbq place in Jersey please let me know.
2015-12-15,5,The Stewed Cow has the best pub food I've ever had, hands down. My boyfriend took me here the other night to meet some of his friends for a drink since it's just down the street from his apartment. This bar isn't on our typical route (it's not by all the hustle and bustle) but it's worth going out of your way for. When we sat down at the bar, the sweet bartender immediately brought us menus and took our drink orders. I personally don't love scotch or whiskey so I ordered an Angry Orchard, which came in a homey mason jar. We went to the bar at about 6:30 on a Monday so it was prime happy hour, which meant certain apps were half off. I ended up getting the spinach dip (half off) and the honey-glazed salmon and my boyfriend got the chili (also half off). I've never been so impressed with pub food before. The salmon was perfectly cooked and lathered in a sweet honey sauce, accompanied by a sweet potato mash and Brussels sprouts. The spinach dip wasn't overwhelmed by cheese at all and was huge for the price--it could've been a meal in itself! By the time Monday night football was on, the bar was packed and smelled like buffalo wings and beer, and I wouldn't want to watch football any other way. I can't wait to come back here.
2015-11-27,4,Brunch was a nice experience. The place fills up quickly because of the $20 brunch deal that comes with two drinks. The complimentary oatmeal was really yummy. I'd come back to try more items on the menu.
2015-11-17,4,After coming here maybe twice for drinks, once even being new years--myself and my friend decided to give this spot a chance for food. Happy hour to be exact. Its small, dark, but beautiful inside. The decor is themed and perfect for what seems to be a southern/texas/bourbon bar. A real nice perk is the fact that they had happy hour until about 9 pm! sweet!. this included half off drafts, wine glasses and about 5 different half off apps. This is not the best place for the non-meat eaters. The must gets are the veggie burger slider for sure. for $4, youll get a perfectly grilled mini veggie burger. the bun is so cute, along with the lil burger itself. unlike other veggie burgers, it doesnt fall apart at all & it tastes great! the sauce on top was refreshing and i loved the touch of corn that was in the patte itself. Next to that, if you like chicken get the chicken quesadilla. this really filled me up. its messy so beware!. the buffalo calamari was a nice , unique attempt but didnt have much flavor in my book. what did have flavor was that cajun mayo. i need the recipe for that---throw this stuff on anything my friends!beer selection wasnt too impressive to be honest, they really only had one that caught my eye. service was great, and overall, i enjoyed my time here.
2015-11-16,3,The Stewed Cow sits right around the corner from my buddy's new apartment. Naturally, we stumbled there for Sunday brunch. After being told there were no tables available (I could clearly see one open), we took a tight corner space at the bar. The bartender wanted nothing to do with our slow decision making. They had an interesting option for brunch. I don't remember what it was called, but it included 2 breakfast drinks, a brunch entree, muffin, and oatmeal for $20. I chose the redneck taco. It was below average. The "fried" egg was cooked to oblivion and the attempt at a pancake was too soggy to resemble anything like a taco. It wasn't bad. It just wasn't somewhere I'd go twice. The deal for $20 is a good one, if you order the right thing, however.
2015-11-05,5,Great neighborhood spot! Usually come here for a weeknight dinner-always very friendly and good food! Some of our favorites-burgers, sweet potato fries , spinach artichoke dip, good selection of beers
2015-10-24,5,I love this place!  3 for 3 in service,  food,  atmosphere.  Will be going here a lot while I live in Hoboken.  Definitely recommend.
2015-10-13,4,I liked this place. We were just leaving the Pier 13 Hoboken, driving past this place without a blink of an eye we made a mad dash to stop here. We loved it right when we first walked in (this is how me and Katie end up finding out spots). Randomly driving by.....Any who we decided to end the evening with a tasty drink. We had tried a few of their signature drinks and were very pleased. I looked around at all the people we had regulars, many sports spectators for the college football games (sat). I did happen to notice, they have some great football specials, daily specials, and the food looks pretty good. They even have brunch, their choices look pretty astonishing too. We didn't eat there, but I would love to go back and enjoy a meal or two.
2015-08-29,1,Sooo, I like to give all places a few chances as you can learn that you will be blown away(even if it's on your 3rd time) After several orders and the latest $15 dried up overcooked burger- I am very disappointed. Food is underwhelming and overpriced. I have tried several different items, and eggs and sauce can't hide the blandness or the price. Not worth it, at all!
2015-08-29,3,I have mixed feelings on The Stewed Cow...It is GREAT for a night out with a small group of friends, Sunday brunch (try the sweet tea lemonade cocktail-yumm!) , etc. the mechanical bull in the back makes for a fun stop with friends on a Friday or Saturday night. However, be warned the dinner here is sub par in a city filled with amazing restaurants. We got the turkey burger, onion strings and quesadilla. The turkey burger was dry and lacked flavor, while the quesadilla was swimming in grease. Come for the drinks, country atmosphere and mechanical food!! ...just eat beforehand
2015-08-25,5,I should start with the caveat that I'm not going here late night or anything. Usually I'm coming here with my wife for a few drinks or maybe an early dinner between 5-7pm. Often we bring our young daughter along as well (they recently got high chairs that work at bar tables and they're awesome).That being said, this is *by far* our favorite bar in town. A nice, rotating selection of craft beers. Really tasty bar food that's good for a snack or for a full-on dinner (I think we've tried all of the appetizers at this point and I can't recall one we didn't enjoy). Easily the best happy hour I'm aware of (half-off beer/wine weekdays from 5-8pm I believe). A great music selection that's not played at a stupid loud volume. The staff has always been extremely helpful and very friendly.I can't recommend this place enough.
2015-08-18,1,I have not been there in a long time, but I never wrote a review on it.  I thought the manager at the time was completely rude because I told them the Makers and Ginger they made me did not taste right.  I drink that every weekend and it was my first drink of the weekend.  It was obvious that there was something wrong with their fountain soda... not that the bartender did anything incorrect.  But the manager was so out of line, I would NEVER go back.
2015-08-04,4,I came to the Stewed Cow with my boyfriend at 11am on a Sunday. They have the best brunch deal ever -- 2 drinks, bowl of fruit, muffin basket and an entrée for $20!!!!!!! Truly infamous! Note, you can also order a la carte, which I did because I didn't want to drink. However, I did have a few sips of my bf's Arnold palmer (lemonade with iced tea vodka) and it was so very delicious. The muffin basket not only had muffins, but banana bread, carrot cake and a cheese Danish. All the fruit in the fruit bowl was very ripe and sweet! Now, onto the entrees: I had the road kill platter - brisket, bacon, scrambled eggs on 'biscuits.' The only thing was, it wasn't a real biscuit, it was what seemed to be a slider bun. That being said, it was still great because it was heavily toasted. My bf had the cowboy sandwich. You really can't go wrong with a sandwich made with texas toast. Dem fries tho, THE BEST EVER! For realz, they were like thick cut but spirally and perfectly crispy. I would go back just to eat all their French fries.
2015-07-31,1,I was relatively happy with the drinks and food but one of the waitresses dropped a plate at one point...a manager grabbed her by the arm a little to violently for me. I can't endorse a place that treats its workers like that. Not ok.
2015-07-27,5,I am obsessed with the Stewed Cow.  It's a hidden gem in Hoboken if you love country music (and even if you don't) and it has a great atmosphere.  The food is delicious and they have a make your own salad option which is great for those who want to eat healthy.  The drinks are amazing.  I first asked for Captain Morgan which they don't carry but the bartender suggested I try the Rogue hazelnut rum which was great.  I get it every time I go now.  The drinks come with one big giant ice cube too which is pretty cool looking.  The bartenders are never anything short of friendly and helpful and there are plenty of drink selections to choose from whether you prefer beer or something stronger (they even have flavored moonshines which are delicious).   They also have a mechanical bull which always provides some good laughs after a few cocktails.  I really can't say enough good things about the Stewed Cow and I can't wait to go back!
2015-07-05,1,Posted on 7/05/15 I made the mistake to order delivery food! Terrible!!! Terrible value and long wait. Cold small portion if half rack ribs and gross potato salad when it arrive. I'm so mad I wasted money and time. I guess it's a good bar but do not expect to go there for food. Still mad at myself for expecting too much. Terrible!!!!
2015-06-28,5,I've been here an absurd amount of times over the past 2 years that I should probably get my own bar stool.  I think the secret is out by now, but this is the best brunch spot in Hoboken.  You get the most bang for your buck here with the food and drinks.  I'd recommend the Cowboy Sandwich or stuffed french toast.NFL Sundays are also very enjoyable here.  Great wing and beer specials with a fairly lively atmosphere.
2015-06-18,2,I love mechanical bulls. And the Stewed Cow is the only place I've ever heard of that lets you ride one for free. It's a bit far from the rest of Hoboken's bar scene, but hey, free bull rides.The Stewed Cow is a country bar, so expect country music. It has some TVs too, in case you're trying to catch a game.The drinks selection is pretty average, mostly macro brews with a few better craft choices. Prices are typical of Hoboken. I'd give it four stars, because of the free bull rides, but the bouncer was a jerk. Our group walked in with no issues, no bouncer in sight. A few seconds later, my one friend is being dragged out by the hood because he looks underage. Checking for ID would've been OK, but dragging a customer out by the hood is unacceptable.
2015-05-24,3,Not bad, decent brunch deal (lots of food, 2 app type things, your entree and 2 brunch drinks for $20) The food wasn't bad, i got the cowboy sandwich, it was pretty good, yolky, so be warned. and the other two girls got the french toast, which she said was great and then the skirt steak sandwich, also yolky. Fries were good, very thick! Slow service.. on a slow day, I think the server came by twice before we asked for the bill.. so that was a little odd to me, but not something I would say ruined my trip. I did however think they offered an amazing variety of brunch cocktails that were included in their deal! Not just your typical mimosa, bloody, belini.. they also offered beers, which was good for us considering we had someone who can't do liquor.Overall okay, I wouldn't rush back, but I also wouldn't say no to an invite there. Would be interested in trying dinner menu too.
2015-05-03,4,My first Hoboken brunch experience!Man do I love sunshine, when everyone crawls out after Saturday night shenanigans, desperately in need of Sunday brunch.  For only $20, Stewed Cow gives you plenty of food AND two drinks, can't beat that!  You get a little basket of pastries (we got muffins, a danish, banana bread, and some carrot cake/bread thing), fruit salad, and an entree.  The best part was we got to enjoy this experience outdoors!  LOVE LOVE LOVE outdoor seating for brunch!I had the western omelet which was pretty standard, but I recommend going with a more barbecue food-y option, since this is a country-themed spot.  My friends got the road kill platter and loved it.Inside, they have a mechanical bull, which I'm sure makes for some fun party nights.  The service is friendly, but a little on the slow side.  You can even bring your pup to dine outside and they give bows for water, so cute!
2015-04-22,4,I've only been here for brunch so far but it is one of my favorite brunches in Hoboken. $20 gets you two Stewed Palmers (Arnold Palmer type drink with vodka) or other beverage of choice, a little appetizer from the kitchen, and an entree. I alternate between the cowboy sandwich (sausage, egg, and cheese with a jalapeno ranch sauce between Texas toast slices) and the skirt steak sandwich (juicy skirt steak cooked to your liking *medium rare*, egg, cheese, crispy onion straws, and spicy mayo). I substitute cheddar cheese on both sandwiches. They are both extremely delicious and filling.Last time I was there, they had changed their fries though, which was a big disappointment to me. I used to love their big steak fries, and now they have seasoned curly fries. Which, I know, most people probably prefer - but not me. I wish they had both as options.Overall a fantastic brunch experience and one of the best deals in town!
2015-04-18,1,If I could give this place's food zero stars I would. Worst food I've had in a very long time. I generally try to give a place the benefit of the doubt but this place was beyond a magician's touch. We ordered the bourbon glazed wings and the Brisket nachos. Let me tell you... Just don't, unless you want to contemplate shooting yourself in the face or having an appetizer. The nachos were well...Let me say, not nachos. They were potato chips with cheese whiz. Who on God's green earth has ever eaten nachos made of potato chips? Bad cooks, that's who. And cheese whiz? Only Philadelphians with a hankering for a cheesesteak put cheese whiz on anything. Oh, and people in soup kitchens. And not only that, there was no salsa, I think I literally counted one scallion on the plate, and the brisket was budget. Self respect is not something this chef has.Now for the wings. What can I say? If one could imagine the most basic, baseless crud on earth it wouldn't begin to define these wings. Basically someone found the most measly wings from premie hatchlings and deep fried them for less than 30 seconds, after which they decided it would be an insatiably good idea to pour Aunt Jamima pancake syrup all over them.I wish I could say that was it, but I've run out of time and patience. I'll leave it for you to decide whether this place is truly the worst slice of hell or a hidden gem. If you decide to get the wings though, bring something to hang yourself with afterwards.
2015-04-13,2,I really want to like this place more...The food is really good and that atmosphere is fun but the service is PERPETUALLY awful. Every time I've been here, we have had rude unattentive waiters. One time, my boyfriend asked for Pappy (an extremely hard to get whiskey) and the waiter told them that they had it for $20/pour (which is pretty standard for that particular whiskey) However, the waiter came over with the bottle and it wasn't Pappy. It was whiskey made by the same distributor. We have the same bottle at home which isn't that expensive. It really wasn't cool that they tried to rip my boyfriend off. After several attempts at linking this place, we will definitely not be going back.
2015-03-29,4,Came here from nyc to a girls brunch. Cute decor nice wooden floors and bar area is pretty , although our waitress could not be found at times. The other staff and  the manager was great and let us ride the bull even though it was closed since we had a bday in our group. That was the main point of the decor and Def think it should be open on weekends.Buffalo calamari was good. Def order the mac n cheese that was the best part of the menu. Don't order the beef jerky super salty smoked strips. I actually didn't know they had a brunch menu until I just read yelp.  That would be a great thing for the waitress to have offered.
2015-03-29,1,Food isn't great and the service is not up to par, at all.  I stopped going once I realized I would literally cringe when I'd see our "server" approaching the table.
2015-03-11,2,I really wanted to like this place as other reviewers have, but my experience simply didn't match my expectations.  It's certainly a respectable option if you live in the West or central Hoboken and refuse to schlep too far away from your home, but I have certainly experienced better places in the Hoboken area.  The Stewed Cow does have a friendly vibe, an interesting beer list, and a broken mechanical bull in the back, but the service was just downright atrocious.  The waitress simply refused to give us some time to choose the drinks, and had completely forgotten my friend's order.  Several times.  And stay away from the Turkey Burger, as it turned to be as tasteless as I've ever had, even if the homestyle fries were okay.  On the bright side, the Buffalo Calimari was delectable, and I enjoyed them immensely.  As I've already mentioned, there are some decent beer choices, such as several Flying Fish IPA's and barley wine choices, if that is what floats boats.  The whiskey list is also quite respectable.  Having spent over $130 before tip for a party of four, however, I was hoping for a bit more.
2015-03-10,4,Good neighborhood bar! Country-themed, good food, and they serve drinks in mason jars. Good happy hour on the weekdays, and they even have brunch on Sunday apparently. At night, they often have the mechanical bull running, and it's always fun to watch. If you get the "drunchies" and want to satisfy your craving, go for the campfire nachos - a BBQ twist on Irish nachos.
2015-02-14,2,Went there for brunch. There is a reason the brunch deal is only $20. We had the Cowboy sandwich and the Road Kill platter. We ate half of each and had enough. You know it's bad when the waitress asks if you want it boxed up and you you immediately answer, "NO!". Muffin basket was the best part of the meal. Scrambled eggs are really egg beaters and the sausage seems like frozen jimmy deans's pattys. The fries were ok so if you eat here stick with something hard to mess up like a burger.
2015-02-07,5,Amazing chicken bacon burger! Probably the best I have had in last 2 years in the US. Different type of onion rings which were pretty good too. Not too costly. Great ambience for a bar.
2015-01-31,4,Good food and service.   Also entertaining watching ppl ride bull :) American burger was delish and the spicy crab dip is a must.   Will come back
2014-12-22,4,Really good food.  Great for delivery.  Onion rings are great.  So is the short rib.  Fries are delish.  The pasta is great.  Brunch is nice.  Mac n cheese could be cheesier but it does the job.
2014-12-18,4,Thank you Anthony, for clarifying! I have not been here for drinks in a while, so I think it's only fair that I update my review to reflect this information. I continue to order take out from Stewed Cow, and I always enjoy it. I will try to stop by soon for the drink specials!
2014-12-18,3,Hubby and I popped in here a couple weeks ago after a rainy day in NYC.  Parking is horrendous (street only, locally, or there's a lot/garage a couple blocks away) - not The SC's fault, but just a head's up - thankfully, we were able to park right across from the entrance!  We found out about SC through it's 'sister' bar on the other side of Hoboken, The Brass Rail, so we figured we'd give it a try.  nice long bar, which was packed (about 6PM on a Saturday night), college football on most of the TVs (quite a lot of TVs, too) -we were sat at a high 2 top towards the back where we could see the evil bull for bull rides (long story short - rode a mechanical bull once in NYC, will NEVER humiliate myself again like that - not enough alcohol in the world to get me on one again!  LOL).  We ordered the spicy pimento and crab dip, which was served with chips similar to Stacy's pita chips (only a little chewier) - the crab dip was excellent - not too spicy and not too fishy.  Hubby ordered the brisket platter which came with tater tots and sauteed collared greens.  I tried some of it and it was very tasty; I had the fish tacos which were your standard grilled mahi-mahi steaks inside of flour tortillas(I think there were 3 small tacos).  The food was good - nothing phenomenal, but tasty none-the-less.  The beer selection was very diverse, although the server should have known a little more about what was on draft - the menu only had a select few listed - there were about 6 or 8 other beers that were scrolling across the bottom of one of the TV screens that we had no clue that they had!  If we knew that they had some of those on draft, our selection would have been much easier (and probably a little more enjoyable than what we had).  All in all - for a beer, I would most likely go to the Brass Rail - for the food, The Stewed Cow.  And the Stewed Cow, for some reason, just seemed like it would have a younger crowd (we are in our 40s, so we may be outdated going there at the peak weekend night hours!  LOL)  OH - and PS - they have something like 100 different whiskeys!  (my niece had mentioned that to me as well!!)
2014-12-08,3,I'm giving this place 3 stars based on their brunch menu and food, but the place itself I am a fan of & if you're looking for a quick cocktail or beers with some friends, that it's definitely worth checking out. I came on a Sunday around 1pm and the place was pretty crowded, but not unbearable. She said there would be a wait for 2 and that we could wait at the bar, which I thought was odd as there was a 4 top table available right next to the bar...but then she came back and said we could sit. I started off with their Shipyard on tap, which was awesome. It tasted like a delicious winter stout. The menu itself was rather limited, which was disappointing. They had french toast, omelets, chicken or beef empanadas, burgers, a few other items and a make your salad option where you you can pick a lettuce, fruit, nuts, cheese, and salad dressing. They did however, also have a $20 bunch deal where you pick one food option, and it comes with 2 mimosas (or other breakfast related cocktails) and some muffins for the table. We didn't do that. I had a spinach salad with strawberries, walnuts, blue cheese & grilled chicken in balsamic dressing, which tasted a lot like straight balsamic vinegar, but hey, it was probably healthy. He forgot my blue cheese the first time around, so I asked him to bring some over, which he did. Decent service overall. My salad was okay, nothing special. Kinda wish they had a lunch/dinner menu available when we arrived. Oh well. Moving on, they give you a basket of muffins and breads and some kind of creamy sauce that you can put on the muffins, instead of butter. Interesting. After my Shipyard, I decided to drive the waiter crazy and asked him to give me two different samples of beers, and I would just order one of them. The one beer I had was excellent, it tasted like a Lager aged in Bourbon barrels or something similar. Delish. They have an excellent selection of whiskeys, ryes and bottled beer, as well as a fun selection of craft beers and it's awesome to watch football here as they have a ton of tvs. I have been here when people were riding the bull too, which is always fun on a Friday or Saturday night. I like the place a lot more than Gaslight, it's new, fun and reminds me of being in Texas. They had promo girls there on the Sunday I went giving out free shots of Jim Beam, super nice girls. Cute spot. I like that it's off the beaten path and I can usually find parking not too far away.
2014-12-04,3,We had dinner here with friends and it was decent.The food is pretty standard bar food, with a bit of a more upscale twist on it. To start we had some beers and the Spinach and Artichoke Dip (standard), Quesadilla (a bit on the spicier side, which was great!), Buffalo Calamari (first time having calamari this way and we all really enjoyed it), and Cheesy Tater Tots (YUM)! From there we moved onto dinner with the Tequila & Lime Glazed Salmon (pretty good but served in a bowl of beans and broth... kind of odd), BBQ Shrimp (enjoyable), and something else I can't remember. No dessert.Everything was fine, came out hot, tasted as described above. The only thing was that they were pretty strict about the happy hour time (started at 7p) and made us wait until then in order to get the deals. We figured it was a computer system thing (if it isn't entreated in during the correct time it wouldn't count) but our waiter really could have done a solid and made it work for us (instead of just having us sit around for an extra 25mins.In the end, it was fine. I think I enjoy this place more as a bar, however, esp when there are ample amounts of people to make fools of themselves on the mechanical bull.
2014-11-22,5,Anthony the manager and Christian the server are super awesome. They gave me a mini intro to whiskey flight that made me feel like way less of a whiskey n00b. Also, the tots are awesome.
2014-11-19,1,The funny part... This place emailed me asking to explain my above review. So I, thinking they would appreciate it, wrote out a 2 page explanation as to why I have the review I did. Since then, I have yet to hear anything back from them. Against my better judgement, I tried it for dinner... I have it 1 star for a reason before... Sticking with it now.
2014-11-06,4,I had a great time here! Rode the bull and didn't get hurt, the bull-master was gentle on me (I think he didn't want to scare anyone off). The one extra-large ice cube in the  whiskey is an amazing touch. The one I tried was recommended by the bartender and was delicious, but would be nice if my first few choices I picked from the menu were actually available. The only food I tried was the nachos, they are the STUFF OF DREAMS, people! Like no nacho you've ever had before. Sweet bbq sauce on fresh made potato chip nachos, with so many other great toppings. Would like to go back and try some other menu items, hopefully it would be a little less crowded. Oh- and thanks for busting out all the country jams- keep it real!
2014-11-02,5,The servers are always welcoming and friendly. I prefer sitting outside during the warmer months; service has always been quick & it's nice and quiet as the location is kind of off the beaten path. I haven't ridden the bull, but I'm sure it gets crazy in here on a busy weekend night :) Tons of whiskey and different specials for every night of the week.
2014-10-23,4,So I still have never eaten here, but with all those beers on tap who needs to?  Seriously, the beer selection is terrific.  They have lots of brews on tap that you will not see at other places in town.  There are so many TVs lining the walls, which I love.  Probably the most unique feature is the mechanical bull in the back of the room.  Again, I do not think you will see that anywhere else in town.  When Stewed Cow was new, there was always a line.  The crowds have cooled off a bit now but be aware you still may run into one.
2014-10-19,3,Best whiskey selection in Hoboken without question.  If you are just going for drinks at the bar, this is the place to go.  Never too crowded either.  Food is awesome, but service is not good at all.  The simplest of things seems challenging for them and the kitchen takes a long time.  Don't expect a quick meal!  The large ice balls for whiskey are a nice touch though.
2014-10-08,1,Ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fried potatoes and mac & cheese. The bacon cheeseburger was overpriced, lacked flavor, and partially burned. The fried potatoes we're on point but the mac & cheese tasted like they were straight out of a box of kraft mac & cheese. This place is below mediocre and I would never eat here again.
2014-10-06,5,Just moved in up the street and can tell I'm going to be a patron for a long time comin'
2014-10-05,5,If I could give this bar 6 stars I would. The Brisket Nachos are out of this world. Overall the food is amazing and service is great. Came here for football Sunday and the specials are some of the best in town, especially for what you get.
2014-10-02,4,This review is mostly for brunch and weekend nights. With that being said, this is a great little country bar on an off street in Hoboken. Friday and Saturday nights are a good time because they have the mechanical bull running. Good music, drinks aren't expensive or cheap, nice bar that doesn't get too crazy but definitely has a good crowd. As for their brunch: I love it! I usually get the steak and eggs and it never disappoints. Whatever they marinate the steak in is sooo gooood!! Big fan! Brunch is $20 and you get two alcoholic drinks (I love the mimosas and manmosas!), pastries, oatmeal or seasonal fruit and your meal. So much food for the price! And it's all good.
2014-09-25,4,nice bar- good food.gets very crowded on the weekends at nightmy favorite item on the menu is the salad that you can pick and choose your toppings- lots of selections. YUMMY goat cheese.bartenders are nice and helpful as well when selecting drinks
2014-09-14,4,This may be my favorite new whisky bar. Serious selection of bourbon. Staff was really nice and attentive. Healthy pours too. I am not a big fan of lots of ice in my whisky but they use these enormous single ice cubes - and somehow it works for me. Really great. I did not go near the mechanical bull but if that's your style I say go for it. I'll certainly be back to this place - and I live in NYC!
2014-09-03,4,Great staff to help pick drinks managers works the bar perfectly.   It's all bacon burger is mind blowing you good.   Texas black caviar was so so,  wouldn't recommend.
2014-08-23,2,It would probably take a lot for me to go back. They have a decent beer selection and the menu looked pretty good. I had the southwestern burger, I ordered it medium rare and it came back well done and dripping with grease. I got sick afterward, probably from the heavy amount of grease that I am not typically used to eating. Fast food burgers are far less greasy, let's put it that way. The tater tots were bland, could have used some seasoning (even a little salt and pepper). The atmosphere was pretty chill, not too crowded, a mechanical bull to ride in the back... interesting choice... don't ride it after eating the burgers!I might go back just to have drinks, but I would not recommend the food.
2014-08-21,1,In a word! Bullsh$t...Loud annoying sticky tables with ill informed staff! Food... BasicDrinks ... No scotch really?
2014-08-21,3,My friends wanted to meet in Hoboken for a night of drinking. They were trying to find bars with cheap drinks and that's how we ended up at The Stewed Cow. Unfortunately, my friend was hugely mistaken about their "$3 Fireball shots" deal. It turns out the deal was only for an hour in the night. And the prices rose as the night went on. In the end, I think we ended up paying $7 for a shot in a plastic shot cup that was half the size of a normal shot. Great. The place itself wasn't too crowded and they played Top 40 music (I was pretty drunk, don't take my word on what music they played). Their saving grace has to be the mechanical bull. That was SO FUN, especially when you're drunk. It was my first time riding it and it was tough. And I was in a dress. I should've opted out, but I've always wanted to ride a bull, so what the hell? Plus, I was drunk. In a dress? Not a problem.Overall, fun place, but I don't think I'll be back here any time soon. There are better bars out there.
2014-08-20,4,Have been here a few times for casual meals with friends and weekend nights out. The food is traditional bar fare with a southwestern twist. Have had a few of the burgers, the fish tacos, cheese grits, and split the nachos and buffalo calamari. The burgers and cheese grits are really good, and the other stuff is pretty standard. Never had any complaints and always found it to be quite reasonable. They have lots of TVs and show sports, but don't get over the top crowded for big games like some other local spots. They have a nice beer selection, including some barley wines and off the beaten path options, not just ipas and blond ales. So I know what you're really wondering, what about that bull? Yeah, I saddled up. Nothing wrong with a little good clean fun. If you're looking for a low key neighborhood spot and change of pace from the nightlife on Washington Street, Stewed Cow is a great way to pass an evening.
2014-08-15,5,Cookie dessert is amazing!!! All portion sizes are amazing. Ask for Jessica best server there!
2014-08-04,3,Pros: Not overcrowded! This is the perfect bar to just hang out with your friends and have some drinks. The specials are great, last Saturday there were two different shots for three dollars each before 12 am. There's also a mechanical bull in the back which is pretty cool (but they need to fix it, people kept slipping off because the rope was slippery). The music genre was country which was different from the usual so that was good! Cons:Kind of far from the rest of the bars. No dancing music.
2014-07-31,3,TERRIBLE SERVICE.My boyfriend and I decided to give Stewed Cow a try since it's so close to our apartment. We went around 7pm last Friday for dinner. We walked in and asked the hostess if we could sit outside. She said she'd check but before she could a different hostess/waitress stopped her and said their was no more empty tables and we'd have to wait unless we wanted to sit inside. So instead of waiting, we sat inside next to a window where I could see an empty table outside!  When I turned around to request the table outside, the couple that walked in behind us ended sitting there. I knew they didn't have a reservation since they also walked in and told the hostess they were a party of 2. I was super annoyed! The right thing they should of done was offered the table to us even after we were seated inside. We sat there for 2 minutes when I saw a different couple that was seated outside leave. I got up to tell the hostess/manager/waitress that seated us I wanted to sit outside. She said she'd go clean it promptly before seating us there. She decided to trot around the restaurant taking orders, bringing out food, chatting with other employees, everything but clean that table or tell someone else to clean it for us. After giving her 8 minutes, I decided I'd get up and do it myself. When she saw us exiting, she ran over and cleaned it quickly. How nice - it was when I got fed up is when she actually decided to do what she promised. It was definitely a rough start. As for the food. It was ok. Nothing great to report.
2014-07-27,4,A small update. The food has not improved (good, not exceptional). The service has been tremendous lately. I've probably been there many, many extra times because of the inspired service I've had on occasion. Let this be a lesson for managers everywhere. Hire the right staff and customers become repeat customers.
2014-06-29,1,This was our first time AND our last.  The brisket and baby ribs were pretty terrible.  They were so dry that no amount of extra sauce could salvage it.
2014-06-27,1,Definitely get the bourbon glazed wings.  Sweet and crispy.  Very good.  Cheesy tots, corn bread, collard greens and other sides were all good.  Why 1 star?  The ribs and brisket.  DRY DRY DRY.  The brisket was so dry it looked like slices of cardboard.  There were pieces where I couldn't even see the grain of the meat.  As for the ribs, good luck trying to figure out what is meat and what is bone.  Dry and hard.Their bbq meat was so dry, I'm afraid to see what their beef jerky looks like.  Maybe today's dry meat is tomorrow beef jerky.So disappointed.  I miss Gaslight that used to be at that location.
2014-06-10,4,I debated on 3 stars but have it four being that the drinks were ridiculously cheap. I rode the mechanical bull and althought it looks like it will be a soft landing watch out for the sides of the bull they have sharp edges and I actually got cut once it threw me off. If looks easy but trust me if you're brave and wanna have a great time ride the bull. The bathrooms totally look authentic. It's all modern country music which can get annoying since they all sound the same. I didn't try any good but speaking on their drinks solely I would say order away I order about two rounds of patron shots for the group I was with and only spent 26 dollars. I went on a Saturday night at about midnight it was filled with a decent amount of people. It's a good scene, try it out! Of you're a girl make sure to wear pants !!! No skirts if you're riding the bull.... It really flings you off.
2014-05-18,4,Great place. Went here last night for my friends 25th bday. Although I had been sick recently I wasn't up for eatting like I usually do but the food according to everyone else was fantasic .. I did try the buffalo calamari and it was very good!! The bull was the best though! My best friend guilted me into riding it because it was her birthday. It was very very fun!! Lol. Anyways would defiantly go back although iam not in the Hoboken area very often!
2014-05-17,4,Lived in the south, and I'm a southern food snob... I've had terrible experiences at restaurants that claim they are southern fare... This place gets my approval.  When you make collard greens good enough to make you wanna also yo momma, I'm sold!  However I wouldn't call this place southern... They are mostly Texas/creole...big difference! The highlights for us was the bourbon wings and the collards.  The pecan pie would've been 5 stars only if it was warmed thru, it came out cold and with whip cream... Yikes! Ice cream and warm pecan pie is the only way to eat pecan pie.  Looking forward to getting my southern fix ins again!
2014-05-08,5,Amazing, real deal southern joint. I had a delicious old fashion, amazing nachos with pulled pork on hand cut and fried potato chips, and an outstanding skirt steak sandwich with a fried egg on-top to boot. Great music too, super happy customer (:
2014-05-02,5,I'm definitely a fan! Love the mason jars and interesting bites like the cheesy grits (yum) and there steak burger with awesome fries. And love their chips with this bean type salsa-excellent to pick at.Disappointing that they don't have everything listed on draft but they have bottled options too. Very very loud but a cool bar nonetheless!
2014-04-28,4,Came here for brunch on a recommendation and sat outside because it was so nice out. We were surprised to find brunch was $20 for a drink, fruit salad, few pieces of banana bread, and an entrée--it was awesome. I got the sunny morning which is egg, bacon and cheese sauce on top of two pieces of corn bread. MIND.BLOWN. it was soooooo tasty. I left off one star because we had no silverware and it look a bit of effort getting the waiters attention to first give us silverware and napkins. And because our table was so slanted that when we got our drinks, they sloshed everywhere and got all over my shoes.
2014-04-27,4,Cool place with good beer selection and friendly staff. Good apps recommended by bartender and would stop back any time for a quick bite.
2014-04-25,5,Broke My Gluten Free Diet For This Place.  Bourbon Glazed Wings & Skirt Steak Sandwich.  Cold PBR.  We Left Happy.
2014-04-02,1,Delivery took over an hour. When I called after 40 minutes they said the burgers take 20 minutes to cook (which is highly interesting since it takes only 5 minutes everywhere else on Earth). What happened to the other 20 minutes? And then the 20 minutes after that? Definitely don't order take-out! P.S. good is crap too
2014-03-27,5,Awesome spot in Hoboken. I've been here quite a few times and I've always had a blast. Before last night I had only been on the weekends, and I told my co-workers all about the mechanical bull we had to ride. When we got there they told us they didn't usually do it on the weekdays, but they did it for us anyway. It was awesome for them to do that for us, and we appreciated the customer service. 5 stars from us!
2014-03-23,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken. Last night I had the buffalo calamari, chilli and chips, and concrete cowboy. All 3 were amazing. The concrete cowboy is a burger with short rib on top. Everyone we took there loved the atmosphere and food. Beer selection is always good. After a couple switched over to rye and ginger. Nice size pour with 1 large ice cube which was a nice touch. Waitress was very nice and joked around with us.
2014-03-15,4,We live nearby - and it is the best brunch in the area. We have been here a few times- and love their brunch $20 for 2 drinks and your meal. The meals are very filling especially since they give you a little bowl of oatmeal and some pastries  before your meal. Everything is very yummy. It is also a fun bar at night- especially with the bull in the back. Beers are not cheap- but its a cool place and glad to have it in the neighborhood.
2014-03-12,5,OH BOY! So I have a New FAV place!!!WOW!! 5 stars all the way. I got the deviled eggs- so random - totally worth it!!and the infamous SC quesadilla So good I ate it all in like 5 seconds lolTHE BEST !!!! A+ THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!
2014-02-07,3,The DJ was "on his own". Mr DJ,........ you or your company are lucky to be there, The guy on Saturday was great, this bearded guy wasn't, Didn't really care about anyone else. On another note, I didn't get his name but the larger black bouncer couldn't have been nicer. He Rocks. Thank you. Overall, I'd go back but the DJ was very arrogant and if it stays that way, there are plenty of other bars.
2014-01-27,4,My friend and I got brunch here this past weekend. The place is really cute and while the food is good, I think they should consider adding a few different options to the menu. Eggs are not the first thing I want to eat when I'm hungover. There were burger options, even a salmon option and salads, however, what ever happened to some waffles with fruit or pancakes?! If those ever get added I think the place would be a hit.Also, when getting brunch they also serve a little bowl of oatmeal which is DELICIOUS! A few people actually inquired about having it as an option instead of what was listed on the menu for brunch, but the waitress just kept blankly staring at them and never went to go and find out if this could be possible. It's definitely something that should be considered as a bowl on the brunch menu.
2014-01-22,3,It was my second time at The Stewed Cow and it's a pretty decent spot off the beaten path here in Hoboken. I love the idea of a Whiskey bar because I am a huge fan of the spirit, however I found their prices a bit too high - even for Hoboken standards, therefore going there is only a treat and I still can't bring myself to buy a drink if it's not on happy hour. The food is a-ok. The tots are just tots with cheese - tasty but nothing special. The catfish was cooked beautifully with incredible collard greens underneath. I would go back just for this dish in general but the greens were a bit over salted. The chicken cajun pasta dish was extremely spicy... too spicy. It was overpowering all of the other wonderful flavors in the dish and all I could taste was hot. The fried oreos - a must. The cuisine has a Louisiana feel to it. I think next time I will try a burger or build my own salad but I don't see me going back for awhile unless it's for a special. The first time there, the bar service was a bit slow but when he got to us he really took his time helping us with our selection and pouring us sample sips of certain items we were interested in. The second time at the table, service was attentive and not pushy at all. Overall a great staff.
2014-01-21,5,Phew! Finally got here a few times for dinner and drinks and boy was it delicious. I went recently again with a friend and we started with the tavern chips- melted blue cheese yum! we both got burgers that were juicy. We also tried the cheesy grits and it was a great side dish with the meal. Happy hour is longer then most places so it made dinner so much better that I could grab a few craft beer specials!It's a must try, ask for recommendations from the servers- they know their stuff!
2014-01-10,4,Been to Stewed Cow a couple of times since my last review and I gotta say, I'm really happy this place is in town... The food has been consistent since day one and the service keeps getting better... Stewed Cow is slowly turning into my "when in doubt go to" spot... 4 stars well deserved... Keep it up SC!!
2013-11-16,4,My husband and I have been several times, its our new go to spot in Hoboken. Great bourbon selection, great food, and awesome bartenders! Nerissa is awesome - we loved her!
2013-11-12,1,Went back this weekend and have to say the service has not improved. Went to bar to catch football on Sunday and while the bar was busy, it took forever to even acknowledge me at the bar. Regardless, I got a beer and was paying by CC. At no point did they indicate there was a minimum nor does it indicate anywhere that I could tell there is a min. I got another beer and was going to leave and asked for the check and was told there's a $20 min. I said fine can I apply the beer to the brunch special (includes 2 cocktails) and was told no so was forced to order a la carte. Again not a big deal overall, but plenty of places I can spend my money where service is much better.
2013-10-23,4,Besides the fact that I live super close by, one thing keeps me coming back to this bar and makes me want to give it one more star. No, it's not the modern country music, the mechanical bull, or the lack of seating on weekends. Whiskey. You would be hard pressed to find a better selection outside of Bourbon county. Over the past couple months, it's become a much more chill place, and I was super happy to geek out with one of the managers about the whiskeys and bourbons they had in stock and the ones that were coming soon. They have a little ways to go in terms of forming their identity as a great whiskey bar versus being a popular NJ d**che-haven like a lot of other cool bars in Hoboken, but I've got my hopes!update: Weekday nights are the way to go here if you're coming for the whiskey selection. I was happy to find a chill vibe, friendly staff, and awesome service.
2013-09-28,3,Been here several times. The beer selection is pretty good and the speciality cocktails are pretty good. Try their version of the margarita, or the six shot shower The food is decent but it just tastes like it's missing something. I got one of their speciality hamburgers but it just tasted like any old burger, and the fries were bland too.  I was also confused by their make your own salad on the menu. Who goes to a sit down restaurant to make their own salad? Maybe there could be some more original options. Definitely would try this place again for a different thing on the menu and the decor is pretty sweet.
2013-09-25,3,Girl has a birthday. Girl puts on tiara. Girl gets tanked. Girl rides mechanical bull. Girl falls off mechanical bull. Girl tries to go home with a guy. Girl's birthday friends protect her. Rinse, wash, repeat.It's a typical "broboken" bar with a nice layout and a mechanical bull. I'd say the clientele of women is about the same as walking into Texas Arizona. Very decent whiskey and craft beer. Plus if you get bored just walk 2.5 blocks over to Northern Soul -- case closed.
2013-09-22,4,Grab a whiskey cocktail and hop up on the mechanical bull, or just relax with friends at this popular Hoboken bar. A little off the beaten path in Hoboken, this bar has a much calmer atmosphere than the typical Hoboken bar and is very popular with the locals. There were even several strollers parked inside during happy hour which is always a good sign in Hoboken. The libation menu features a huge bourbon list, a good draught beer selection, and some delicious cocktails that will help you work up the courage to ride the mechanical bull in the back. Even so, it is far from a raucous crowd here, even on a Friday at 11:30pm. I tried the bacon flavored "pork chops and appleasuce", probably my favorite drink of the night, then the Mule Kicker, but with tequila instead of gin, then the chocolate infused Cocoa old fashioned, which was tasty, but very heavy. I also had the bacon, bleu, and hot sauce burger which was incredible. The meat was excellently seasoned, rare for bars in the area and the toppings mixed very well together. The fries were also very tasty. I also stole one of our friends' bourbon wings which was very tasty and cooked well and nice and crispy. Service was very good, though because we started with only drinks, they didn't come by incredibly often. The bartender suggested a whiskey for us and though I didn't love it, I appreciated the knowledge of the products they had.
2013-09-18,3,An update from my initial review in which my experience was....well crap.I have been back several times now, mostly out of convenience because it is so close to our condo. Each time has had a varying experience, some good, some still crap.I will say this, the food is pretty decent, the burgers are good and the skirt steak sandwich is excellent. And they have finally seemed to master what an "over hard" egg means. I still wouldn't come back here for brunch however. It just was so bad the first time and not worth the money when there are many options in town. The burgers are all decent, the turkey burger was ok. Again, the brunch...skip it. The steak fries are generic but tasty. The service is spotty, usually the bar is your best bet before 9pm, it's usually slower and the bartenders are attentive. Each time we've had table service the waitresses have this "I hate my job/boyfriend/school/life attitude and it's usually just really bad. The couple times we've eaten outside the service has been excellent, maybe the fresh air makes it better? One time I was there with a couple people and we were drinking at a table and the manager (the bald guy always in a plaid shirt), asked us to leave so he can have the table for people. Dude, we're spending money, now we are going to stop spending money. He did buy us a round of drinks because I think he realized that was a horribly stupid move that was. I didn't go back for awhile after that. The happy hour specials are ho-hum with half off beers usually and some kinda bourbon special. No specials on Sundays...so don't come here to watch a game. Yuenglings and Coors Light on a regular night are $5, that's just ridiculous for a small bar waaay downtown away from everything else. Sorry kids, wouldn't come here for several drinks...have you tasted coors light? You know it's not worth 5 bucks right? It is still a bro bar on a Friday/Saturday night. That isn't going to change until they get rid of the bull, which if anyone watches Bar Rescue each seat is work 10k a year, that bull takes up precious real estate. And PLEASE for the love of everything holy get new bar stools, they are wobbly and ridiculously uncomfortable. Three stars A-OK is their max.
2013-09-10,3,Cool concept. I like the American style atmosphere, it has its niche in Hoboken. However, I have been here twice over a 2 month period and had the same experience twice, which is as follows:Great moonshine cocktails, over cooked food, nice wait staff, but slow service.The manager, both times, took items off our bill because of the lousy food. If the management ever reads this, you have all the recipes for success but find a way to fix your kitchen staffs consistency and quality.
2013-09-09,4,Great food, awesome whiskey selection! I come here every week and am always treated like a member of the family. The mechanical bull is extremely fun.This is a great place to bring your friends and I am never dissapointed.
2013-09-09,2,I know that $20 for two drinks, pastries, and a brunch entree is a good deal. I appreciate that on a busy football day they accommodated the large group I was with as it trickled in randomly. But the service blew. It was over an hour before we flagged somebody down to actually order our entrees, and we couldn't have the other brunchy accoutrements until we did that. Additionally, a server spilled my water all over me - luckily not much of it got on my iPhone - and all I got was a ton of napkins and a hasty apology. Our main server didn't even know it had happened until we told him. The food was good - pork belly with eggs and breakfast potatoes was cooked surprisingly well, but the experience was terrible.
2013-08-15,2,Slow service at the bar. Wish I could say food was anything over par. Looks nice though . Has potential
2013-08-02,3,My squeeze and I wanted to try a new brunch place, so we motivated ourselves one Sunday afternoon to hit up the Stewed Cow in Hoboken (anything more than a 1/2 mils radius takes motivation, guys).We went for brunch and ordered their special - its like $20 for two drinks and an entree. Seriously?! I got the bloody mary (deliciously fresh) and my guy got the Man-mosa (he wasnt too keen on it). He got a mimosa next which he liked, but the "OJ" out of a gun freaks me out.Both our entrees were great - his slightly better than mine. You must go with the expectation of pub food - burgers, fries, etc (dont be complaining about lacking finesse or quality-- they dont claim to be a gastropub!). I had the steak and eggs which had an amazing bourbon sauce, and my guy had the steak sandwich (I kept stealing his fries... which, if you follow my reviews, youll know are my weakness).The staff was courteous and extremely helpful and attentive (until things were winding down with our meal) , but every request we made was met with a smile (even to see a few bottles of their bourbon collection!)
2013-07-13,1,I gave it another shot, months later, and now never have to go again. Maybe I did something wrong but the bartenders pretty much refused to serve me, much less make any eye contact or acknowledgement. Seems like when the meal arrives it would be a natural time to ask if you want a refill, but no. Speaking of the meal, the turk burg was dry, the bun was sawdust, and the fries are your classic freezer aisle steak fries. And why are the stools so short? Best of luck but there are like 600 other places in town that offer better everything.
2013-06-15,4,Went there on a Friday night and was able to eat outdoors, which was really pleasant. This took the place of Gaslight, my beloved Sunday brunch spot during football season, so I wanted to give it a try in preparation for checking it out once fall hits. The decor is pretty cute, very western-styled with rope-railings and a saloon-like atmosphere. Wasn't too crowded, which I like a lot and there were plenty of TV screens inside (which makes for a great brunch option come football season!)My friend and I each had burgers. I can't recall which my friend had, but it was spicy and he ate it with gusto. I had the Southwestern burger which was topped with a generous amount of avocado and cheese (and that chipotle lime vinagrette was pretty tasty too!). Both came with a healthy serving of steak fries which were nice and crispy. Both burgers were humongous and cooked to order, so no complaints!They have a pretty fair selection of beers on draft and the Old' Smokey's Margarita was pretty good too if you're into sweet margaritas. Probably the only complaint I have is that sitting outdoors, service can be a little slow. But I chalk it up more towards that they need to hit their stride. I'll have to come back during brunch another time. But at this rate, this may be acceptable enough to replace my traditional Gaslight Sunday football spot. :)
2013-06-14,3,Been here a few times since it opened.  The first few times I went the service was AWFUL - they pride themselves in being a whiskey bar but the bartender knew nothing about whiskey.  You could tell the staff was under experienced.  Once I even walked out because I couldn't get a drink!   More recently though, the service has gotten much better and Elena (I believe?), a server there is uber friendly and awesome.  Finally got a chance to try their food 2 weeks ago and it was amazing!!! I think they have one of the best menus in Hoboken for a bar atmosphere.  I had a turkey burger (random I know) and it was the best i've ever had!  Also, their cucumber martini's are AMAZING!  It has a good mixed crowd of all ages which makes it more appealing.  Can't wait to try their brunch!
2013-06-10,4,I'd passed by this place a couple times before since opening and was curious to check it out.  I came here for drinks one night and had a good experience--what stood out the most was that the food was unexpectedly good.  I had the fried chicken, which was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside (this coming from someone who is very picky about fried chicken), and came with a side of mashed potatoes, which was also delicious.Good service, good food.  and pretty good ambiance too, despite what you'd expect from a bar with a mechanical bull (which actually provided some good entertainment).  I'd definitely come back here--although it seems if you want a table, it's best to come early, as it got increasingly packed as the night wore on.
2013-05-31,4,Amazing neighborhood gem! The sandwiches here are some of the best anywhere. Grilled chicken club, bbq brisket sandwich, and the salads are AHH-mazing! Not to mention the mixed drinks. It's truly a great little place for a good price (and glorious portions)! The only thing that could be better is the music. Not sure where they want to go with it, but it could be better dj-ing all around. Otherwise no complaints here. I live two blocks away and go at least once a week.
2013-05-29,2,I had super-high hopes after one of my favorite bars in Minneapolis was cowboy themed.Hostess & waitress were short with us and almost mean.  Food was solid, typical bar food.  Drinks were average and pretty expensive.Wouldn't go back voluntarily
2013-05-19,4,Relatively new spot in Hoboken, replacing the old gaslight restaurant. Went here for an afternoon snack. Great selection of all types of booze and also micro and regional brews. We had beer and wine but the cocktail menu looked impressive. The deviled eggs were a nice snack and service was prompt. The place can get busy/ loud. The 2 girls next to me at the bar talked so loud and were so obnoxious they gave me a   headache. Hopefully, they don't represent the typical clientele. Prices are very fair and to me it looks like an improvement over the gaslight.
2013-05-15,3,Don't come here for happy hours. False advertising. 1/2 price apps means choice of 2 apps that they choose. $1 mugs is a can of bud light. FFood is good but a little overpriced for what it is. And although we waited awhile for service our server was really nice.  Good beer selection and whiskey for days.
2013-05-05,3,Country-style gastropub.I should preface this review by telling you I arrived at 6:30pm on Cinco de Mayo/Hoboken Music Festival Day. So it was crowded and I'm sure all the workers were exhausted.There weren't any tables available, and when we inquired about a table, we were told it would be from 15 minutes to some indeterminate time for a table. Luckily, I kept my eyes open and jumped on one when it opened up ten minutes later.I had the Mule Kicker (tasty) and the Stewed Punch (even tastier), and I modified the club sandwich to be a BLT. I really enjoyed the roll, and the sandwich was good. The menu says that it comes with fried potatoes, but apparently all the potatoes had been served for the evening, so it ended up coming (unannounced) with a salad that was overly dressed.My boyfriend loves traditional sazeracs and was thrilled to see one offered in Hoboken. They put their own spin on the Rosie the Heifer Sazerac, which he enjoyed. He thought the Better With Bacon Burger was in the Top 5 Burgers of Hoboken (Brass Rail, O'Neills, Zack's, Pourhouse).The service wasn't quite there yet, but given the day and the newness of the restaurant, I'm willing to give it a pass. I'll definitely be back.
2013-04-30,5,Came here on a weeknight.  To start, there was room to grab a seat at the bar with great TVs.  The music wasn't too loud.The fried chicken was awesome, and the beer and bourbon selection were great.  I'll definitely come back
2013-04-26,3,I should preface this by saying that I really wanted to like this place. Aside from the terrible name, I'm always happy to hear about a bar that isn't located on 1st or by the Path and the fact they play country music makes it all that better. Finally went here on a Thursday night with a few people and, unfortunately, left largely disappointed.First off, the country music they play is so low you can barely hear it over the noise of the crowd, making it largely pointless. Combine that with the super dull looking decor and there was nothing that made the place stand out.The food was just bar food, nothing more, nothing less. The most bizarre thing is the mechanical bull in the back. It takes up a huge chunk of real estate and largely sits unused. They had it up and running toward the end of the night but I didn't see one person ride it nor did the DJ try and talk it up. Seems like the owners threw it in thinking it would be like New Orleans but  largely don't know what to do with it. The whiskey/bourbon list was more impressive then most but, just a pet peeve, I hate when bars line up their liquor bottles on shelves behind the bars and only keep it like 50% stocked. There is nothing worse then sitting at a bar and starring at dead space and empty bottles.Would I complain about going back? No. The place was clean, the bartenders were friendly, the happy hour specials aren't bad and the place is located far enough in Hoboken that it is more a locals crowd then most.  Would I purposely go out of my way to have a drink here? Doubtful.
2013-04-22,4,I was out here for a few drinks and a bite to eat on a Saturday night. I will give everything about the bar a thumbs up. Good beer & whisky selection was the first thing to grab my attention. One of the problems with bars in Hoboken is that some haven't gotten past the idea that you need more than 5 beers on tap (Coors/Bud Light, Guinness, Blue Moon, Stella & Yuengling are the "standards" you see in every bar). They have quite a few drafts and bottled beers and get that extra 'star' from me because of that.I tried the grilled chicken club sandwich off the menu. It came on a roll, and was quite good actually. They serve thick steak fries - not my personal favorite, but have to say they were pretty tasty. My friend had a salad, and loved that she could pick & choose what to put over her greens.Downside is the size, it can get very cramped on a busy night, the bar is long and there simply isn't a lot of room to maneuver. Loses a star because of that.Yes, the 'elephant in the room' is the mechanical bull. Its in the corner/back of the bar and certainly is unique - but honestly the bar can easily get rid of the bull. It really is more of a funny extra, but to me the bar would be best served to get rid of it and add more seating. The Stewed Cow has good food, a good bar selection and is a very much welcome addition to the neighborhood considering what was there before it.
2013-04-21,4,I went at 7pm on a Saturday with my boyfriend and sat at the bar for dinner. Ali behind the bar was so awesome that I'd probably give the place 4 stars even if the food sucked- but it didn't. My boyfriend had the burger and said it was on par with his favorite burger ever- at the Spotted Pig. It was delicious. Beer and liquor selections are really well edited. We left around 10- it was really starting to get packed at that point, and bull riding had begun. My only gripe really is all the country music- not my thing. It's a definite go-to on my list now.
2013-04-21,3,A+ for the bourbon/rye/whiskey menu. So great to have so many choices, and its about time we got a place like this in Hoboken.I ordered my bourbon on the rocks and LOVE that they use one large ice cube for the drink. And the price was pretty average for top shelf bourbon in hobokenBut beware I noticed on my check I had a $1 up charge for getting my bourbon "on the rocks"  I have NEVER seen an up charge for getting ice in your drink. I'll still probably be back for the selection so I can try some more bourbons before purchasing for my home collection.
2013-04-16,2,We live in the neighborhood, so I've come to the Stewed Cow multiple times now. The re-design looks great...huge upgrade from Gaslight. The mechanical bull is a waste of space more than anything. In an already tight bar, this space would be much better used for additional tables. I've also only seen a handful of people use the bull. The food is just okay, it's pretty standard for a bar. The service is a little rusty, but that's to be expected with new staff. Nice variety of beers, not your standard Bud Light selection. Noise level is pretty ridiculous at certain times. I'd rather go to a place where I can have a conversation without a heavy base blasting. Also wish they would bring back the outdoor seating like Gaslight had!
2013-04-14,3,We came here tonight with a few friends to take my boyfriend out for a birthday dinner. I always like Gaslight, although I felt like the food was going downhill towards the end, so I was excited to see what the new place had in store. It's definitely...a bar. I know that seems obvious, but I did feel like the previous establishment had a bit more of a restaurant feel, especially with the spacious dining area in the back. That's been replaced by the bull, so there's really not much space for dining. We arrived around 8ish on a Sunday, and it was actually quite packed and LOUD! I was a little turned off at first, but it did empty out a little as the night went on. Definitely not the kind of place to enjoy a quiet meal; also not the most comfortable.The food is actually pretty good. The menu and drink selections certainly reflect the theme, and it's decently priced, although some of the specialty drinks may cost more than you're used to. We got quite a sampling betweens our apps and entrees: cheesy tots, buffalo calamari, wings, burgers, steak sandwiches, salads, and the short rib entree. No complaints about the food, and we were all satisfied. The kitchen closed at 9 on Sunday (not sure if this is every night) and a crowd started rolling in around 9:30, presumably for the bull. I wouldn't make this a regular stop, but it's a nice alternative to typical Hoboken bar food.
2013-04-08,2,This place is quite interesting. It had some good qualities and some really bad ones. The services was horrible! Some of the worst I've ever experienced! Our server took 30 minutes to come to our table, took our order, then went on 'break'. 45 Minutes later we still had no drinks and food and no waiter! Eventually we found someone to help us. The menu sounded good and the food was actually really good. However, it took almost 2 hours for us to get our food from the time we entered the bar. The manager was running around, drunk i think, with no clue what he was doing. At one point I went to the bathroom and my buddy went to have a cigarette. We told the waitress we would be right back but when we came back, our table was cleared and they had put somebody else there. I had a $25 full bourbon drink on the table and they cleared it off! I told the manager and he said it was too expensive to replace and gave me another terrible bourbon. I'd maybe go back because the food was good but they have a lot of work to do to get their staff trained.
2013-04-02,3,i came for the mechanical bull, but it didnt seem to be that popular. Perhaps it was too early in the night for people to get on one haha.It was extremely packed on Saturday night thanks to March madness. The crowd was ok, late 20's early 30's crowd, well dressed crowd.
2013-03-31,3,First time here since they refurbished it from the establishment formerly known as Gaslight. The new space is great with a western theme and mechanical bull ... Both probably the only of its kind in Hoboken. Went for the $20 brunch. It's a pretty decent deal with one item plus 2 drinks, pastry and fruit. I had the steak and egg sandwich and was pretty impressed it was a tasty sandwich. Just be warned, it's messy. The service was disappointing here though. Our drinks did not end up coming until after our food, and we had to remind them we hadn't received them yet. That's brunch service rule #1: drinks served before food. Will I come back? Yeah I will. It's convenient to the population away from Washington and the food was good.
2013-03-28,5,Great selection of bourbon and nice layout.  The decor is a little sterile but It is exactly the kind of place Hoboken needs.   Diversity is sorely needed in Hoboken and I'm glad it comes in the form of Stewed Cow.  Its hard to find Pappy anywhere, exceptionally happy to find it in my town.Put up some cool southern artwork!
2013-03-27,3,I've been to The Stewed Cow twice since its opening earlier this month.  The first time was for dinner on Sunday evening during their opening weekend.  They have an interesting cocktail selection, and it was nice to see that my friend's wine was happy hour-priced even on Sunday.  Everyone enjoyed their food (friends both had burgers, I had the short rib sandwich).  It was obvious that there were still some service kinks to work out, however - for example, my friend asked for the Tavern (potato) Chips with her burger, and a confused food runner brought her a basket of tortilla chips.  They also had a problem with one of the printers in their kitchen, so it took quite some time for our food to arrive.  But I feel like you have to expect some bumps in the road when a place first opens, so I knew I would give this place a second chance.I returned for Sunday brunch about 2 weeks later, and again really enjoyed the food.  Like its predecessor, Gaslight, The Stewed Cow offers a prix-fixe brunch for $20 which includes 2 brunch cocktails and a small basket of pastries.  The pastries were kind of bleh - they looked like someone had dumped some leftover Entenmann's danish and muffins in a basket.  But both the steak and eggs and the "bacon and eggs" entrees were delicious.  The "bacon" was actually pork belly, which was tasty and unusual to see on a brunch menu.Service at brunch was improved - we actually had the same waitress that I had the first night, and although she still seemed a little green, she was pleasant and attentive and our food came out much quicker this time.The atmosphere is pretty laid back, even when it's crowded - and it seems to cater to an older crowd, which is nice when you've decided that places like Green Rock, McSwiggan's and the like have permanently found their way onto your Murtaugh list.I'll be coming back to this place...especially to try their cranberry white whiskey.
2013-03-27,4,I think this place has some harsh reviews that really were unfair.  First off, the place just opened, of course they are going to have long kitchen times and a staff that has a bit of a learning curve.  I was there the first Saturday for brunch and it took 30 minutes and that was what I expected.  I'm assuming all the other people that reviewed this place have worked in the service industry and never had a table wait over 15 minutes......right?Poeple complain about the pastry basket and the oatmeal at brunch, why?!  Put it this way, you get two drinks and a meal for $20.  Still a great deal for Hoboken.  If you want good food stick to the core menu.  The skirt steak sandwhich, the salad and the burgers are great.  All were great and honestly the only thing I didn't care for was the quesadilla.  The flavor was great but I just didn't like how the style of it.  The bull is on Friday and Saturday  which makes sense.  It's a country/bourbon bar and I think if they stick the that theme they will have a steady customer base of people looking for something other then the typical Irish bar or the Wickwolf/1Republik's.
2013-03-23,2,Went with my husband the first Saturday it was open. The hostess was very friendly. We got drinks at the bar before we got our table. Once we got to the table, our server didn't show up for about 10 minutes before we asked the hostess to ask her to come.  We started with buffalo calamari, I got the peppered shrimp and my husband got a burger.  I love spicy so the peppered shrimp was excellent but even I thought they might have to tone it down for the average person.  My husband couldn't eat it it was that spicy.  Overall, food was good but the bar was way too loud.  Maybe it will be quieter on a weekday or for brunch.  Will definitely wait some time to go back so they can work out their service issues and also for the newcomer crowed to die down.
2013-03-21,1,So I was curious and anxiously waiting to see what would open in Gaslight's place. When I heard a Bourbon Bar with a mechanical bull I thought ok well that's different. I finally got to check it out yesterday. For a Wednesday night it appeared pretty busy however I don't know if it was actually busy or the lack of seating just gave the illusion it was a packed house. The front of the house has limited table seating and the bar has stools which in my opinion they could have bent the budget a bit and upgraded. The back room is basically just the bull room and bathroom area. The bulls a great novelty but I doubt Monday -  Thursday its seeing much action.  This place could definitely use some more seating. The staff was very friendly and manager was accommodating when we couldn't get a table he found us at the bar to seat us. The menu seems pretty standard. We ordered quesadillas & chicken sandwiches which were both good, no complaints with our meal. Our server was pleasant but he was in a bit of a rush to close out our tabs which would annoy me in any case. All in all it seems this place has a few kinks to work out. I don't hate it but not my first choice. I'd go back if for nothing else but to ride the bull of course.
2013-03-19,1,Went for brunch with a few friends.  Brunch is $20 and includes 2 drinks per person (mimosa, manmosa, draft beer or sangria) and "something for the table."The drinks were just ok.  "Something for the table" was oatmeal and a basket of muffins/pasties.  How are you supposed to share oatmeal with 5 people?  That's more of a 1 person dish.Anyways, two of us ordered salads and they mixed up the ingredients between the two.  One person ordered eggs, which came out wrong twice.  Third time's the charm, I guess.... Oh, then the manager told him that he ordered the eggs wrong.  Nope, you made them wrong.  On another dish the fries were cold, and on the last dish the homefries (all 4 of them) were cold and meh.This place has some kinks to work out, for sure..
2013-03-15,1,After the Gaslight closed I anxiously watched the storefront under go a face lift, all while wondering what new establishment would occupy the space. Living across the street I was weary about they type of bar/restaurant that would open and my fears were solidified in the first week of business.I stopped by the third night it was open to find a crowded front bar playing top 100 music and a row of blaring televisions above the bar which proved to be way more irritating then entertaining.What can I say about the mechanical bull? Well sometimes it seems to work and when it does the masochists line up to be humiliated and tossed around like drunken idiots. As soon as I heard there would be a mechanical bull I knew the place was doomed.Add to the fact that the once quiet block is now teeming with loud and drunken people I will avoid the place and hope it breaks down, much like it's mechanical bull.
2013-03-13,1,Have now been there twice looking to ride the bull and the bull wasn't operating.  If you want to ride the bull please call ahead, no drink specials on a Sunday night and without the bull running I can find better bars in Hoboken to drink at on a Sunday
2013-03-12,3,Been waiting anxiously to see what would be occupying the old Gaslight and was pleasantly surprised to see a Whiskey Bar...a differrent theme that is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. The three stars is for the growing pains that the bar / restaurant is still going through (they opened last Friday so they need time to get into the rhythm).  For a Monday night it was a good crowd and there were many just stopping in out of curiosity.   We had a seat right near the Host who is chatty but not overbearing.  He did mention the music and that they were still tweaking the playlist....going for classic rock, southern rock, country vibe.  He mentioned the DJ that  Ashley L. and S B. mentioned and that it was a huge mistake and once their obligation this weekend to him is done, it's DONE!!  So fear not...Snooki and the Situation will not be frequenting the Stewed Cow.Onto the food, very good but again, the servers and the kitchen need to get into a groove.   We started with the Buffalo Calamari.  Delicious.  The calamari is definitely fresh not frozen, not chewy.  The breading is your typical pub breading for calamari, not to heavy though, not all breading and no fish.   The amount of buffalo sauce was spot on as was the sprinkle of crumbled blue cheese.   The portion of the appy was more than enough for 2 and with their special on Monday of 1/2 price apps from 7pm - Close, it's a steal.   Which is good if you are meeting a few friends for drinks and want to have a bite...you can split something and it will help to offset the cost of your premium drinks.   When our calamari was brought to our table our waitress came by for dinner order, she never mentioned the specials (if any) or the Stew of the Day.  Our main meal was fish tacos and the seared Ahi Tuna (an odd choice for this place as it's definitely a man menu with Beef, Beef, Beef).  Heading out on vacation in a few days and trying to make 'healthy' choices...lol (you'll find later in the review that this is all negated wth dessert!).   Both our entrees were good and although my meal tasted great it didn't fully didn't fully match the description on the menu.  Needless to say, still tasty and I cleaned my plate. Onto dessert....we went with the Warm Cookie Dough and Vanilla Ice Cream.    The waitress described this as different than what you would think.  A scoop of ice cream with the warmed dough on top (basically it dough brought to a safe temp but still gooey and ooey)....it also takes about 20 minutes to prepare.  What came out was a partially cooked cookie in a skillet (which is piping hot and burned myself on twice) with a scoop of either choc chip ice cream or cookie dough ice cream.  Again...an orgasm inducing delicious treat but not what is described on the menu. I will definitely be back, these are definite issues that are opening up pangs and can be fixed.   My recommendations are have the chef prepare everything on the menu for the staff so they can see how it should be prepared and they can taste it so when a customer asks about something they have the knowledge.   Also, please have the over exuberant bus boy clear dishes all at once, if I'm still eating you should be clearing plates from the others around me.  As for the mechanical bull, use it for the next 8 months or so to attract the crowds, then get rid of it to make more space for tables...you're gonna need it.
2013-03-10,3,The mechanical bull is a novelty, they seem to specialize in whiskey and bourbon, and there's mostly rock peppered with country music. Other than that its like pretty much every other bro bar in Hoboken. There's still bros, they just wear their one plaid J Crew shirt; and there's still roving packs of girls trying to pretend they're not there to pick up plaid shirt bros. The space is long and narrow, so watch out for congestion in the front. The tv's kind of kill the ambience on a Saturday night but I can see how they're necessary during games. The boys had some beers they seemed happy with (not just Bud lites) and I had two separate drinks with club soda that tasted like tonic. One of them was actually just a club soda, not sure what happened there.We'll probably return to try some cocktails and food, was too chaotic for that at the time. Will update the review then.
