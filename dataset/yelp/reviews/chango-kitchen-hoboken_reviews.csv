2021-10-31,5,Having been to many restuarants in Hoboken, I can confidently say Chango Kitchen is one of the best around. The staff is delightful, the food is flavorful, hot, fresh and just all around delicious and the location is nice and quiet, located away from Washington Street. I've been here a handful of times but the most recent was last night with a party of 12. The staff was attentive and quickly  served us all hot food. It's such a plus that it is BYOB and they'll make you anything you want (margaritas, mojitos, pina coladas, sangria, etc).In short, our entire party was blown away by the experience. Thank you, Chango Kitchen, you guys know how to run a business!!!!
2021-10-09,4,October 2021  - we had dinner here ... the food was great, as was the service ... nice friendly atmosphere.  If you bring your own alcohol, they will mix you a wonderful drink. Nice outdoor seating too! Try it, you'll like it.
2021-10-02,5,This place is always good. They have great service and the food is fantastic. Definitely one of the most underrated restaurants in Hoboken. Must try the Guava and Cheese Empanadas and Picadillo "jinetero" Con Dos Huevos Fritos a Caballo.If you are in Hoboken and want a real restaurant that actually has good food you can't go wrong with Chango Kitchen.
2021-09-25,3,Cheap and filling, with nice outdoor seating! I had the tamal breakfast (14$+tax+tip), which had nice tasting sauces, but was kinda dry. I'd try the tostadas next time, which looked really nice!
2021-09-19,4,We arrived here in the middle of a torrential downpour, and the staff was nice enough to take our umbrellas and store them to dry. We ordered a variety of food including the empanadas, chicken with *mole* sauce and shrimp soup. The empanadas were very tasty, and were crispier and flakier than other varieties I have had. The chicken+mole was just fine, though I may not be the most reliable source as I tried it more as an "experiment" than anything else. The chicken was on the drier side, but the flavor profile was very bright and diverse. I will certainly be back and will update this review after eating something more in my wheelhouse. Fairly affordable given the high quality, and the interior setting is cozy to say the least. Be prepared to hear the conversation next to you! But that's par for the course in NYC area restaurants.
2021-08-02,5,Amazing Cuban sandwich, and the smoothies are phenomenal. We got it with both the milk and the regular water and they are a god send during the hot summer. Can't recommend this more!
2021-08-02,5,Great food and the pina colada is a must order. Their lunch specials are delicious. Nice place for a date night
2021-07-27,5,Absolutely amazing food and lovely customer service. Will be returning again and again. So many options on the menu with a huge range. Food is authentic and you cannot get this stuff just anywhere!
2021-07-07,4,Have been meaning to try this place for the longest time since I live across the street. I love the indoor look, I didn't imagine it to look that way. We ordered the patatas bravas to start and the sauces were very flavorful. For mains, my boyfriend got the cubano which was massive and very good. I got the ropa vieja and that was by far my favorite thing. The beef was seasoned perfectly and so tasteful. I will definitely be returning, cheap prices and overall great service.
2021-06-22,5,We stopped by Chango Kitchen on Friday for lunch. They have some outdoor and indoor dining, but we opted to sit inside since it was a bit hot outside.We got a bunch of dishes, and the servers were attentive and efficient. My friend really enjoyed the pumpkin soup (the tomato flavor is stronger than the pumpkin flavor). The beef empanadillas were really great and flavorful, especially with the cilantro sauce on the side. The one downside was the pollo asado daily special, as it was pretty dry, but it was very affordable and otherwise everything was great.I would definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!
2021-06-21,2,I'm not sure if the place has changed owners but it was way better a few years ago when I ate here several times. The atmosphere is very nice and seems authentic. The service was very lackluster even with only a few customers there. It was hard to get a menu, hard to put in an order, took long to get the food, and I had to get up and go to the counter to pay the check as no one came by. As others have posted, there seemed to a bit of attitude with the male server as well.I ordered the Friday fish stew, Baccalo. It was served lukewarm but was otherwise very tasty. The cafe con leche was also served lukewarm. I'm sorry I won't be returning. With other great places with similar food nearby like La Casa and La Isla there is no need to.
2021-06-19,5,This place is very cute and clean with nice service. The food was very good, and tasty with great portions. The albondiguitas were nicely seasoned on their own and complemented by a nice tomato vegetable sauce.We loved that the juices were blended to order, and natural. Good spot to stop by and grab some juices.The mofongo was not my favorite, but my boyfriend disagrees with me, he thinks it's the best one he has had, it was not dry. The portion was very big as well, enough for two.Very recommended!
2021-06-09,5,Place is amazing. If you haven't gone yet, you need to get over there now! Highly recommend the steak sandwich.
2021-06-03,4,I had frequented and loved Zafra for years. I was happy to learn that when Chango Kitchen took the location, they kept most of their menu and delicious food. I did 2 visits within days of each other and enjoyed both. I did get some downgrade opinions from my daughter and nephew on certain dishes, but overall I enjoyed the food. AppetizersEmpanadas- still delicious with a homemade, baked doughPumpkin soup- not as good as Zafra but a heart warming choiceTamal- good Shakes -very goodEntreesCuban sandwich- excellent and hugeLechon- very good Shrimp ceviche - ehOxtail - my sister said it was good but lacked more of the Cuban flavoringChicken tinga - good Desserts  Tres leche - averageFlan - goodChango is a nice stop for a casual, authentic and tasty meal. BYOB
2021-05-19,5,The food here was amazing, I came across this place on Yelp and I was def not let down. I had the Ropa Vieja and it was slamming, def going to be coming here more often.
2021-05-16,4,The staff is so friendly every time I order from here. The food is so fresh and delicious. I particularly love their salmon it has such a unique flavor you could really taste the mango, yum!
2021-05-07,5,Chango Kitchen is located on a quiet residential street. They seemed to have a good number of tables outside and about eight inside. They have a little bar area too, though they're BYOB. My friends and I brought some hard seltzers and cans of margaritas with us and our waiter was sweet enough to bring us chilled glasses to use with them once he saw. I was wowed by every dish we ordered! For me, the big winner was the Empanadillas con Pebre, which I ordered with the chicken inside. It was mouthwateringly savory and the chicken pulled apart like butter. Would 100% order again. I also loved my Salmon Caribeño -- couldn't get enough of the mango pieces they had on top and the salmon was supremely fresh. Our waiter was efficient and very professional, though perhaps a tad impersonal. And the young woman who brought our dishes was such a sweetheart, had a big smile on her face through the whole experience. Loved it! Will return.
2021-05-06,4,Great spot, bright and airy with an awesome kind staff, there salmon is super delicious.
2021-05-04,5,This was so so so delicious. Wow. Knocked my socks off. Authentic Cuban food the way it should be. Everything has such great flavor. My go to spot in Hoboken for sure.
2021-04-28,5,Love love LOVE! New favorite place! Great service. AMAZING food! And a LOT of bang for your buck! Need I say more?
2021-04-06,5,Wow! Amazing food and phenomenal service! First time eating at Chango kitchen and I was very impressed. The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was just as amazing. Will definitely be back!
2021-03-29,5,Delicious and great prices. I came for lunch and had the Ropa Vieja special. So delicious, good portion, and only $8! They have a nice outdoor patio, too.
2021-03-22,5,Just like their predecessor restaurant, Zafras this place is AWESOME!!!!! The appetizers (empanadas and patatas bravas)  were fabulous, the skirt steak was tender and delicious and very flavorful, and the pork Mofongo was also terrific! I highly recommend this restaurant.  Some guests next to us were having the Mojito jar and it looks delicious! Highly recommend bringing your own rum and having them make some drinks for you.  Although the restaurant is another main drag I would recommend going out of the way a little bit to try Chango kitchen! You won't regret it!
2021-03-22,5,Amazing food selections, the variety! *chefs kiss* 10/10 recommend, would be revisiting more often.
2021-03-18,5,Been here twice and IT IS EVERYTHING!!!! Food is phenomenal and the service is better - if that's even possible!
2021-03-13,5,Online says it's open until 11pm so we walked in at 9:30pm and they informed us they close at 10pm but sat us anyways. Food is DELICIOUS. We got the beef empanada and the spinach and cheese one and it was so good. Warm toasted and buttered bread for the table. The mojito teas were yummy and refreshing. They was byob and you can ask them to make you drinks with your own bottle. I got the pork chops (comes with white rice and frijoles) and tostones. The pork chop was so juicy and the tostones comes with a lemony mojo. Everything was so good, definitely will come back!
2021-03-06,5,First time to Chango's, and it was absolutely fantastic. This is quality, authentic, delish Cuban cuisine. Looking for Cuban dishes? This is your place. 100% recommend
2021-02-16,5,Had a great time at Chango Kitchen. Loved the fact that you could bring liquor and they make pitchers or glasses of mojitos, pina coladas, margaritas, etc. The food was fresh and delicious. We had the cream of pumpkin soup, which were both hearty and delicious. I also had the roasted pork mofongo, which I dont usually like because it tends to be dry, but this mofongo was amazing. The pork was tender and juicy. The mofongo was flavorful and moist.  We also had the empanadas, which were great! Couldn't have asked for a better meal.
2021-01-23,5,Best Cuban food in Hoboken / I've ever had!! The staff is SO friendly, prices are very affordable, and quality is top notch. They are my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. The Cuban Sandwich is out of this WORLD. I haven't had an entree I don't love: the fish fillet, Picadillo con Dos Huevos Fritos, pork chops, pollo con mole, etc. The maduros and yuca fries are so good I need you to try them for yourself - you won't regret it.
2020-12-29,5,THIS PLACE IS AMAZING! Have been here at least 5 times now and it is easily one of the best places to eat at in Hoboken. My absolute favorites are the tinga tostadas, churrasco, papa rellenas, and spicy shrimp. But honestly I try new things every time and I am just obsessed and the employees always take great care of us. Don't forget to bring wine and they will turn it into sangria for you
2020-12-17,5,Amazing loving place I had the worse experience in New York and this place made me feel welcomed and cared for ! I will come here a thousand times over great place people and food ! Very clean and respectful !!!
2020-12-07,5,Really really good.  BYOB but don't do something stupid like bring beer--- bring Rum and they will make mojitos or wine and they will make sangria (I think they charge $10). For as good as things are, I could  just sit there and eat the Quesadilla de Hongos. Just one after the next. I want to try lunch specials (great price) with my eye on the Churrasco.Service is also friendly and relaxed
2020-11-23,5,I love, love, love this place..... let me start with the people who take very good care of me whenever I go there( I go pretty often),Johnny, Saul, and Paola. These three ppl are SUPER!! Any time I go In this place they are all attentive and cater to my vegetarian needs. They are nice to everyone that goes there, and they take pride in their jobs. Thank you all!
2020-10-10,5,One of the best hidden gems in Hoboken ! Service was phenomenal, large menu full of great dishes. We ordered the cerdo burjo con yuca and the anticuchos-pinchos de pollo peruanos - both recommendations from our waiter and they were DELICIOUS ! Highly recommend this spot for any occasion.
2020-10-01,5,This place has a great menu, great service and wonderful food! Their tostadas are amazing and cubano! A must try in hoboken!
2020-09-30,3,On the prowl for another hoboken spot to try and we picked this Cuban place. Not directly on any main street when we arrived there was only one person dining. I ordered the chicken skewers and my man ordered the red snapped. FOOD WAS YUMMY!However the service was lackluster, the man who took our order seemed to have an attitude when I asked questions. Also they packaged our food TERRIBLY. I asked for garlic sauce on the side, tell me why they wrapped my skewers up in foil and placed it into the cup of garlic sauce? By the time we got home the sauce was covering the aluminum foil and was useless. That came off ad highly careless to me, like do you not have togo containers with lids???? Besides that everything was great.
2020-09-29,4,I like this spot! I love the idea of a byob with this type of food. The service was friendly, and quick! Food was really good too. We got the yucca fritas which were amazing with the sauce it came with. My boyfriend got the steak which was cooked to perfection and the rice was delicious. I got the shredded beef and rice. I give it 4 stars only bc the shredded beef was rock hard shreds and was full of salt. I could barely eat it because it was so hard. I think it may have just been a bad day of it because the pictures look really good that people post. Deff gonna go back and try again soon!
2020-09-23,5,There fresh lemonade is so good!! There platano chips and mofongo are delicious! I also had a chicken sandwich there and fries, I loved it
2020-09-20,5,I just got my first delivery from this place and I'm so impressed! The delivery was fast, the food came hot and they were super friendly. The food was so delicious! We especially loved the tamales, steak and ceviche. Thanks guys for a delicious meal! Will definitely be ordering from here again.
2020-09-18,4,I ordered a churrasquito with rice and beans. Despite being on the kid's menu, the portion is not small at all and is a great way to get skirt steak for only $10. The steak was a little undersalted but was otherwise seasoned and cooked well. I also had guava and cheese empanadas, which were a perfect mix of sweet and savory.
2020-09-15,5,Cute corner spot right by the hospital. I used to go there back in the day for a quick dinner when I was in nursing school.  The food is still delish. Got a bunch of apps and all were very good. The smoothies are really great too. It's a BYOB. I would go back.
2020-09-08,5,Wow I'm surprised with this restaurant lol. My boyfriend and I went when it was Zafra. Menu is pretty much the same.Today we ordered for pickup the sopa de pollo con cilantro aka chicken soup (we always get it), the Cubano (w/o pickles), and I get the pan con bistec guaro aka garlic steak sandwich (on Cuban bread).Everything was ready early. Everything was hot. Packed neatly in the bag.The Cubano sandwich, my boyfriend said is the best he's had!! He normally doesn't get them because the meat is dry but he was pleasantly surprised by the sandwich here!! I asked for mayo and they didn't put it on but it's ok. He didn't care. The ham and the pork were juicy and tender! He usually gets a ham and cheese. He said he would order this Cubano again and it's way better than la Islas. Swiss cheese perfectly melted. He said it's a 10/10! That says a lot!My pan con bistec guaro aka garlic sauce steak sandwich on Cuban bread was also delicious! It's not the best quality cut of steak, as it was tough, but the garlic sauce is excellent and makes up for it. The Cuban bread is great. The onions perfectly cooked. I'd order this sandwich again and again.They gave us buttered Cuban bread too as a side for our soup. Yummmm. Crunchy, buttery deliciousness.The chicken soup is good. We liked Zafra's recipe better for it (had some red oil that was so flavorful). I love the fresh cilantro in the soup. The chicken is always cooked perfect. Fall-off-the-bone perfect! Temperature of the soup was good for me. My boyfriend prefers it more hot. Potatoes perfectly cooked. We will still keep getting it. It's delicious when you add avocado!! (We always do. Had some at home this time).  :)Definitely recommend trying Chango if you want some amazing Cuban!! :)
2020-09-08,5,Recently ordered from chango's kitchen as take out and ate by the riverside. The food was so good! We had the empanadillas con pebre, ropa vieja and and mofongo de lechón. The empanadas with the pebre sauce were amazing! I loved stewed meats and rice as well and the ropa vieja hit the spot. Incredibly homey and it warmed the soul. I just moved to Hoboken and this is the best restaurant I've tried yet!
2020-09-05,5,Great dining experience! The staff is extremely friendly. All of the food is fresh and delicious. Definitely get the frozen coffee, it's the best frozen coffee I've ever had
2020-08-31,5,Just tried Chango Kitchen for the first time - and the food was delicious! Everyone raves about their lunch specials and I'm glad we gave them a try. Sadly, they were out of the pollo asado today, but the pork was a tasty alternative. We also ordered the chicken mofongo (fried green plantains) which had great flavor and a hint of spiciness.It was surprisingly crowded for a Monday at lunchtime, but there was no wait for a table outside. The seats are spaced out in accordance with COVID requirements, and the staff were wearing masks the entire time. I'll definitely eat here again!
2020-08-27,5,We just tried this restaurant for the first time! The staff is attentive and friendly.. and the food is very flavorful, unique and amazing. The empanadas are incredible-- the entrees are as well!
2020-08-25,5,Our go-to takeout spot during COVID. The sandwiches are pressed to perfection. The empanadas and croquettes are my favorite hot box appetizers to always compliment any order. The food is always fresh and hot. Highly recommend!
2020-08-23,5,I was so sad to hear Zafra was closing, but very happy to discover that Chango Kitchen is the same chef! The servers were so nice they gave us great recommendations and a yummy free meatball app to try. The "garlicky" shrimp was absolutely delicious it tastes similar to the vanilla shrimp dish that used to be on the menu. And the chimichurri sauce is out of this world. Prices are excellent, the plants and red umbrellas provide a lovely ambiance and it's BYOB! The best meal and dining experience I've had in Hoboken in a long time.
2020-08-22,5,Of course there was more food than this( and it didn't come in the container either everything was seperated) I ordered a kids Churrasco a la Parrilla / Grilled Skirt Steak it was truly enough for an adult ; this portion was very filling . Flavorful beans and steak . Rice was soft . I also had the Jamaica water which seemed like it wasn't organic..  ( possibly water + flavored powder )although I still enjoyed it . I also ordered an iced Columbia's latte ...& let me tell you .. amazing . Man would I love to dine in and enjoy the atmosphere next time when pandemic is over ! Order this size meal (kids ) & two drinks totaled at 20$ can't beat that .
2020-08-14,5,Great Cuban, best around, portion, taste, price. I put on my regular rotation and all their apps are fresh n delish.
2020-08-13,5,Just got here again for the third day in a row. Best meal yet!!! Holy Mole!!! Got the chicken mole tamale with side of Mole sauce, one of the best things you can have.  Mole is a perfect combo of chocolate, spice and rounded overall flavor.  Got the cuban on sweet bread for the first time ever, won't ever go back to the other way.  Go here now before they are on Diners Drive Ins and Dives
2020-08-12,5,Absolutely delicious!! Ordered the Shrimp Mofungo, Enchaladas, and a Cuban sandwich and everything was amazing!. Staff was super attentive as well!
2020-08-05,4,We ordered salmon with mango sauce, ceviche and avocado slices. Food was delightful. They are also BYOB. One of our favorite dinner place in downtown Hoboken.
2020-08-05,5,This spot was a hidden gem! We were quickly seated for a party of 4 on a Sunday evening, and the service was excellent. This place is byob and we brought our own red wine and the waitress offered to make a sangria out of it for us. And WOW it was super refreshing and delicious. They brought a bucket with ice  out to keep our white claws cool as well. Portion sizes were huge and apps were delicious. Highly recommend their Cuban sandwich, as I've tried other locations in Hoboken, this place was my favorite!
2020-07-26,5,We love this place! The food is incredible and we order it all the time. Definitely check it out !
2020-07-16,5,A well deserved 5 stars. Amazing food! We are obsessed with all of the appetizers and dinner is amazing every time. Don't forget to bring wine and have them turn it into delicious sangria for only $10 a pitcher. This place is one of my favs in all of Hoboken!
2020-07-12,5,Went here for dinner on a Saturday evening. Sat outside with plenty of space between us and other dining at the restaurant. Food was fantastic and amazingly priced especially with the cost savings of being BYO. Service was also excellent. Will be back over any other Cuban restaurant in Hoboken!
2020-07-10,5,Chango has the best Cuban sandwiches. We order from them at least once a week. I also love their side salad, which comes with an amazing sweet dressing that I can't get enough of. I also wanted to mention that due to a delivery glitch, Chango went over and beyond by offering a complimentary dessert (yummy Tiramisu) and Cuban sodas. Cheers! We will continue ordering from them. We're always left happy and super full after every meal.
2020-07-05,5,Yummy food as always,good service ,all stuff is so friendly from the manager to the waitress.
2020-07-01,5,We've eaten there in person, and ordered to-go multiple times. Wow, such stunning flavors! Everything tastes super fresh and flavorful in its own way. The papa rellena is a personal favorite, along with the maduros and ropa vieja. Truly one of the most authentic, delicious restaurants in Hoboken.
2020-06-28,5,The staff told us that it is a new owner, and food is as good, if not better than the old Zafra (previous restaurant here).  The ceviche is delicious and has a nice kick to it. Comes with full shrimp and big pieces of everything else (not chopped up).  Yucca fries and sauce were also very good.  Tried the chimichurri steak, fried pork chops, Ropa  Vieja, and Chuleta de Cerdo Frita, all of which were very good.  Also BYOB!
2020-06-25,1,Really disappointed. Ordered food from them and it arrived soggy and looking absolutely nothing like the photos. They also forgot half of the entire order and just sent orders of beans without rice which is fairly...interesting. Either this ain't the spot or I caught them on a REALLY bad day but either way, it was enough to make up my mind to not eat there again.
2020-06-20,5,well deserve 5 stars ...Great dishes, great delivery service ...Definitely recommend
2020-06-18,4,I've had several different dishes from Chango, including roast pork, baked chicken, and shrimp mofongo, and have enjoyed their food and the friendly service.  They have the best mofongo in Hoboken.  I definitely recommend Chango and will continue coming back.
2020-06-03,5,My wife and I moved to Hoboken from Brooklyn in November. We've struggled to find spots we love. However...We had takeout from Chango last night - it was top 3 best meals I've had in Hoboken. Every dish we shared was delicious. My go-to now on. Very glad we found ya, Chango Kitchen.
2020-05-18,5,I am so happy I tried this place. The empanadas were DELICIOUS!!! I've been on the hunt for Mofongo and I finally found my spot. Also it looked beautiful inside- can't wait to come and dine in. Definitely recommend!!
2020-03-04,5,By far the best place to eat in Hoboken! GREAT food, clean establishment, and great drinks (it's BYO but they'll mix the drinks for you either by the glass or by the pitcher)! Everything on the menu is delicious and served fresh and hot, and they make for good leftovers as well. The Yuca Frita is a must, and so are the mojitos! Everybody who works there is extremely welcoming and nice. If I could give this place 6 stars, Then I'd give it 7.
2020-03-03,5,BYOB!!! Brought a bottle of red wine and they made it into sangria in just a couple minutes. Very affordable, great food, fun atmosphere. Will definitely return :)
2020-02-29,5,This place is a Hidden Gen in Hoboken with their Latin fusión plates. Apps are amazing the Punkin  Cream Soup with Cheese melted . The Skirt steak with chimichurri to die for. The empanadas OMG Amazing small but wow and of course the service. They just recently remodel the place. 10 stars
2020-02-29,5,Food is amazing but the price is even more amazing!  You can't find a spot better to get flavorful and authentic Cuban food for a price that is not found in this area very often.  Bring a bottle of wine when you go and have them make you some of their famous Sangria!  It is so worth it!
2020-02-28,5,I really love this place! I had the chimichurri skirt steak and it was so juicy and so good! I had it with the beans and rice. I already had it twice in a month because it was that good! Their yuca fries are amazing! The outside is so crispy but the inside is so soft and moist! I will always order her for their skirt steak and yuca fries!! Amazing!
2020-02-23,5,Came here for restaurant week and the food was incredible - it just reopened under new management. It's still byob and service is wonderful. I think it's definitely worth a stop by!
2020-02-22,5,Awesome place, great food.  It's an updated Zafra.    OutstandingThe ropa vieja and chicken soup are the best!!
2020-02-14,5,Stop reading and get in here this place is really good! Very friendly, authentic food, great service and although their primary language is Spanish, they have English speakers as well. The Yucca Fries were so good! Very crispy and the portion sizes of the food is enormous! It's also reasonably priced!Highly recommend the Yuca fries, Morir Soñando, platano maduro, Ropa Vieja, Empanadillas, and Enchilladas. (All of this was like, 66 bucks)
2020-02-07,4,Nice ambiance. They prepare drinks with fresh fruit and the liquor you bring. Service was fast, place was not crowded, classic cuban food very well served and delicious. I'd say you NEED to check this place out.
2020-02-04,5,I am so glad this restaurant opened up in Hoboken! It is inexpensive for the amount of food and quality. I've been three times now since they opened because the service is authentic and welcoming. The manager always comes over to check in as well. Beyond that, the food is what makes this place. It is true Cuban food. The appetizer sampler is great for trying a little of everything. The Cuban sandwich is amazing- try it on the sweet bread! Even better than that is their steak and onion sandwich.
2020-02-04,4,We were big fans of Zafra and were sad to see it suddenly close.  Oddly enough, Chango Kitchen opened in the same space a week later and with an identical menu.  The crowds still came, and the reviews remained positive, so I was curious to give it a shot.  We stopped in on a recent Friday evening without a reservation and discovered a packed dining room and bar.  The two of us spotted an empty four-person table in the back and were surprised when the hostess did not offer it to us.  We agreed to wait 5-10 minutes for a different table, but were approached by the chef moments later, asking us if there was a reason that we did not want to sit at the back table.  Confused, we said that we would happily take the space.  The chef apologized for the delay, took us to the table, and gave us samples of codfish that had been cooked in a tomato sauce and were served over white rice.  It was a sweet gesture and also gave us a peek into the meal ahead.  While flavorful, I thought the fish was dry, but would have been much better if cooked for a few moments less.  In addition to this bite, we received a basket of buttered toast, which we used to love at Zafra, but was burnt and dry this time.  Our meals soon arrived, though, and the experience improved.  My shrimp were crisp, plump, and served in a rich, spicy tomato sauce that was also enjoyable when poured over the buttery white rice and black beans.  My boyfriend really liked his Ropa Vieja as well, but was annoyed when his side order of French fries did not arrive.  When I asked the server about them, she seemed startled, like she had forgotten all about the request.  The chef came to visit us and apologize again, but this time to tell us that the kitchen was out of potato fries, but he brought over yucca ones instead and at no cost.  Again a generous move, but my companion was a bit disappointed, even though the Yucca Fries were delicious and served with a creamy, garlicky herb dip.  As our table was cleared of the remaining few bites of our dinner, we were gifted with a slice of Tres Leches Cake.  The homemade sponge cake was moist from being soaked in three different types of milk.  The sweet meringue on top was light and airy, though I wished that some of the cinnamon that had been sprinkled on the plate would also have been put on top of the cake.  Overall, our meal at Chango Kitchen was tasty, and we would definitely return.  However, they should streamline their front-of-the-house service, rather than rely on their chef to continually save the day.
2020-02-04,5,Oh my god. I stumbled on this place through trending Yelp reviews and it's a total gem. I spend about $800-$1000 a month eating out (just me, one person). I eat out probably 5-7 meals or snacks a week, and I'm always trying new places here, in JC, and in Manhattan. This place is a great deal, delish, and a nice small restaurant where you can have a real conversation with the person you came with. It's restaurant week so I did their lunch deal. The portions are very generous and everything is very flavorful. Staff is nice. Vaca frita and braised beef were delish. Ceviche with fried plantain chips had zing. Definitely worth a trip. Your taste buds (and wallet) will thank you.
2020-02-01,5,Delicious food! Such a nice atmosphere! All of the staff is so sweet and accommodating. 5 stars!  Can't wait to come back :)
2020-01-30,5,We came here for our anniversary and we both agreed that this is now one of our favorite restaraunts in Hoboken. The food is extremely flavorful and the portions are generous. The prices are on the lower side for Hoboken, which is a nice change. We got the patatas bravas, which reminded us of Spain, but the sauce was spicy and more flavorful than you'd find in Spain. For the main course, we shared the vaca frita (fried shredded beef) and the mole de platano (sweet plantains with a mole sauce). The vaca frita is out of this world - crispy, chewy, and salty. The mole sauce on the plantains was the best mole I've ever had, and I've had a lot. It was thick, slightly chocolatey, not too sweet, not too salty, and had a spicy kick to it. We are planning to go back soon to try the quesadillas de hongos and mofongo!
2020-01-30,4,Came here for restaurant week as the menu seemed enticing. It's a BYOB spot which is a huge plus and they can also do sangria with your wine! The empanada and ceviche appetizers were delicious. The empanadas were fried to the perfection and the filling was very tasty. The ceviche was fresh and reminded me of eating fresh fish on an island with the citrus taste. The chips served with it were a little burnt but I didn't even need to eat them with this because it tasted so good. For an entree I got the casita Cubana. The pork was very tender and flavorful. The black beans and rice were standard. The Yucca mash had a lot of garlic but was also good. My friend had the Vaca two ways. The Ropa Vieja was cooked perfectly but he said the other was over cooked. The maduros were a little on the drier side so if you like a less sweet and less crispy sweet plantain (which my friends did) these are for you! The guava cheese cake was standard. Cafe con leche was big and yummy. The service was really good. Always asking how everything was and differently. The place is small and quaint with a homey feel. FYI you cannot use the 10% discount on Yelp with the restaurant week or any type of specials.Overall this place is solid but it does not beat my favorite Cuban spot, Rumba Cubana. It was a good meal but wouldn't go out of my way to go here again. If you are in the area  it is definitely worth a try though.
2020-01-18,4,I never tried the old restaurant that was here, so I can't comment much. Also consider I ordered food to-go, so I didn't sit down for dinner. I ordered the Papa Rellena. For those of you who are familiar with La Isla's Papa Rellena, this is just about as tasty. As an entree I had the Pollo con Mole Oaxaqueno. Chicken with oaxacan mole and rice tortillas. Served with white rice and black beans. My ONLY issue is I wish the chicken was sliced or cubed. It comes as a big chicken slab over the sauce. The sauce is out of this world. It is sweet and spicy. I will absolutely order this again. My mouth is almost watering over thinking about it. This was my first time trying this place and I was glad I ordered this. I'm mildly surprised the place wasn't busier. It was EMPTY on a Thursday night around 6pm. Maybe they need to just get the word out better. I have a feeling this place will get a bigger crowd once the word gets out.Also the people there were very friendly and patient when I asked them over the phone questions about the food. They had my food ready in about 15 minutes.
2020-01-12,5,Loved them under their old name, and it's looks like they kept the menu, added mofongo (my favorite), and kept their phenomenal staff. And I do mean phenomenal. Their waitstaff offers excellent service and they are so friendly, it keeps me wanting to come back. Menu suggestions are the Cuban pressed bread with Venezuelan hot chocolate, spinach and manchego omelette at brunch and of course, pork mofongo ;)
2019-12-31,5,Fantastic fresh and authentic Latin food. We ordered the empanadas, papa rellena, skirt steak with chimmichurri, and pork dish. All were great and service was great as well. I'd go as far as saying the best overall Latin food in Hoboken along with fair pricing (unlike the Cuban, coco Havana, la isla). Definitely will be back. Ambiance is okay, I'd suggest changing the lighting a bit.
