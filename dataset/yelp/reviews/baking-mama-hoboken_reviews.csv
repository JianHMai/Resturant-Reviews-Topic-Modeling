2021-11-09,3,The cookies I had were ok (peanut butter & double chocolate). Not bad by any means, but makes me wonder if I got the wrong thing? Hype seemed pretty strong from all the reviews. I'd say the ones I had were little too dry and crumbly for a cookie that wasn't trying to be a crispy, but on the plus side not overly sweet. Also, the peanut butter flavor was a bit too subtle. Maybe the cakes are more impressive? Hoboken is very much a baking heavy city, and as far as cookies go, I believe there are other options that really hit you with a stronger wow factor. Maybe I'll give it another shot down the road.
2021-10-25,5,Baking Mama has the best cookies!! The owners are incredibly kind. I highly recommend!
2021-10-14,5,A hidden treasure with wonderful vegan options. The vegan cupcakes are my favorite! Their desserts have just the right amount of sweetness and you will keep going back for more!
2021-10-14,5,Decided to stop by Baking Mama for the first time since it's right next to my job and it honestly did not disappoint!! I've been eyeing this cute little bakery for a while and I'm really glad I decided to give it a chance today. I got the Chocolate Chip Cookies and Choco Crinkle, left me wanting more! Can't wait to stop by again and try out their other items.
2021-10-11,5,Baking Mama does birthday parties!! My niece's was awesome!! We decorated 4 cupcakes! They had so many types of sprinkles and candies to decorate with! The owners are so sweet and helpful! Here's some pictures from her party!! Huge THANK YOU to them for their beautiful space and their yummy delicious cupcakes!! We all had so much fun!  Definitely book your child's next party here!
2021-10-10,5,I got the best cake ever from this place for my friend's birthday. To die for. Better than any other place I've gotten cake from in this area, and I've lived here since 2015 with many a birthday having cake.
2021-10-03,5,Without question, Baking Mama has the best cookies in Hoboken!  Their "birthday/confetti" cookie is a personal favorite.  And even better?  The owners and those that work at this bakery couldn't be nicer.  Love supporting local businesses and this is one of those in Hoboken worth supporting.
2021-08-22,5,Five stars doesn't do Baking Mama justice. This little bakery is my favorite in New Jersey. I stopped in on Friday afternoon to pick up cookies for my parents who were visiting. We talked about these cookies all weekend. If we had enough time, I wish we were able to stop back to get them some to take home. Things to know: They are following strict COVID guidelines so be sure to have your mask on hand. Only one customer is permitted in the store at a time. Service is very prompt so you won't be waiting long. They have the cases of cookies, banana pudding and cupcakes immediately inside the entrance and the staff is so friendly! What to get: at one time they were voted best chocolate chip cookies in NJ and it's clear why. The cookies are so soft you'd think they just came out of the oven. The day I stopped they had anything from chocolate chip, to birthday cake with vanilla chips, to salted caramel, to red velvet. I got a variety to try and let me tell you, I ate the birthday cake cookie on my walk home. If cookies are your thing they have a selection of cupcakes and banana pudding that looked incredible. I know we have so many options when it comes to bakeries in Hoboken, but this one takes the cake. I can't see myself going anywhere else for cookies.
2021-08-12,5,Baking Mama is a little jewel of a bakery right near the PATH train, and near the waterfront park. Every thing we've had from this mom and pop store has been delicious, and it's a treat to support such a sweet family, instead of Starbucks or Carlo's Inc. (They do great custom orders too.)We like to grab sea salt chocolate chip cookies,  macaroons and coffee and walk to the water. Heaven.
2021-08-05,5,I recently ordered a gluten free chocolate cake for a special event because one of the guests has celiac disease. The cake was so rich and delicious, everyone raved about it! No one could believe it was gluten free. Would definitely order from Baking Mama again!
2021-07-15,5,I just moved to Hoboken and was looking for my new go-to bakery. Baking Mama is definitely it! The owner was so sweet and conversational as she packaged my cupcakes. She even told me about the baking classes they offer throughout the year. After trying the cupcakes that night I was even more convinced that this place deserves 5 stars. They were incredibly moist and rich with flavor. I'd recommend this place to anyone who has a sweet tooth!
2021-07-13,5,This little spot is in a perfect location when you're walking from the path and needing a treat. I stopped in wanting a good chocolate chip cookie (despite my diet) and walked out with three different yummy treats. When you walk in it's very small and the treats are right in front of you. Behind that the owner was hard at work baking goodies. Everything looked and smelled great but I took home a chocolate chip cookie with sea salt, an Ube Cookie (purple sweet potato), and a leche flan. Let me just say I'll be back on cheat day. All were excellent and that leche flan was the best tasting flan I've had in a while. Definitely a place to stop in and try a pastry you've never had before. I was eyeing the Cassava cake so I'll be back for that.
2021-05-25,4,Macaroons are not my favorite but my wife loves them here so we came here!  The chocolate macaroons were a fan favorite at the party we brought them too.  I also liked the other flavors they had going on.  The macaroons were a little hard on the exterior for my liking but still quality. The cookies were calling my name when I was in the bakery but that is for next time.  They were very friendly too which is always a plus. Check it out!
2021-05-22,3,Really nice staff. Baked goods were average, nothing spectacular. Hate to say it because I really want t to support local and small business.
2021-04-11,5,As a lover of chocolate chip cookies, Baking Mama's sea salt chocolate chip cookie is certainly something special!  I most recently placed an order for cake pops for my daughter's first birthday.  They made the most delicious, adorable rainbow sprinkle cake pops!  Baking Mama is the place to go for all things delicious!
2021-03-25,5,The sea salt chocolate chip cookies are drool-worthy. They're thick and fudgy and gooey, aka my ideal cookie. Also it's so convenient that they're located near the Hoboken Terminal because I can pick up a batch for my family every time I go home. My family is just as obsessed with them as I am now!
2021-03-05,5,So I ordered 8 cookies, 2 Chocolate Chip, 2 Salted Chocolate Chip, 2 Oatmeal Raisin, 2 Double Chocolate Chip. Cookie with those kind of swirls, that's classic chocolate chip, one above that is salted version, oatmeal is one above double chocolate.Let's start with Oatmeal, it's not an overwhelming taste, it has a nice balance of oatmeal to sharp sweetness of raisin. Double Chocolate Chip is a surprising one, it has a nice sweet taste to start, but strong bitter chocolate taste towards end, it's a awesome blend of sweet and bitter chocolate that you would want in double chocolate compared to just same kind of chocolate flavoring! It just enhances the flavor more. Next is classic chocolate chip, and what can I say! It's a really good, delightful cookie. The salted version is actually my 2nd favorite cookie from here(my favorite being oatmeal even though I love chocolate) due to the added extra element of saltiness with sweetness of the cookie! Overall, the cookies are amazing and must get in Newark! It was wonderful time trying all food I can and with this being last thing I try before I head home! Side note: the cookies are somewhat gooey, aren't insanely gooey but I prefer my cookies that way!
2021-03-04,4,This bakery is a great little shop on the Hudson for cookies! Their chocolate chip with sea salt, double chocolate and oatmeal raisins are the best option- just wish the cookies were a little larger.
2020-12-23,5,By far the best bakery in Hoboken. Family-owned and run by the nicest people ever. Their cookies and cupcakes are amazing. I would highly recommend the Ube cupcakes. Prices are very reasonable as well.
2020-12-23,5,Discovered this place at the start of the quarantine and my only wish is that I had discovered it sooner. The cakes are moist and delicious. My personal favorites are the red velvet and the confetti. This is one of the best local bakeries around.
2020-12-20,5,Great selection of macaroons! Their cupcakes are delicious, and they do do custom orders.
2020-12-14,5,This is my favorite bakery in Hoboken. The cookies are absolutely delicious and always fresh! We ordered a bunch for thanksgiving and my mom even sent me one for my birthday. They are so gooey and just melt in your mouth!! They have cupcakes, cookies, cakes, Whoopie pies, and more. They always have adorable designs for the holidays and yummy flavors to try! This is a must stop if your in Hoboken and wanna grab a sweet treat!!
2020-12-03,5,This place is amazing! First off, the owners... I can not say enough about them as I would just go on a rant with every positive word possible. They are such kind sweet humans and fantastic to have a quick chat with! You aren't just another customer to them buying something, they really make every purchase a caring experience. Now to discuss the delicious treat! The cupcakes are wonderful! Yes, I know people do not like the word moist.. but that is exactly what they are! They are moist and just melt with each bite. The cookies... my favorite... if I could eat these for every meal I would!Moral of the story is that this place is a sweet treat wonderland!
2020-10-28,5,Tina led an amazing cooking class! She was informative, gave excellent advice, created unique cookies, and is authentically herself. I highly suggest buying fresh baked goods from here :)
2020-08-28,5,Cute place for yummy baked goods! I'm gluten free and love Baking Mama for always having at least one type of gf cookie and usually gf cupcakes too! :)
2020-08-23,5,What a wonderful place! The owner is so kind and the cookies are delicious! Especially, the crinkles and sea salt chocolate chip cookies.
2020-08-22,5,They took my customized order on such short notice and did not disappoint! Everyone loved the cupcakes!
2020-07-21,5,I had my wife's birthday cake custom made from them. During lockdown, it is one of the few bakeries open in the Hoboken/JC area who are available to do a custom cake on a short notice. They were very responsive via email. Our order was implemented to perfection. The cake was adequately sweet & tasty.
2020-06-09,5,I wanted to support a local business especially because of the pandemic. I ordered a chocolate cake with cookies and cream filling for my husbands 50th birthday. OMG it was so delicious! I just ordered it with vanilla icing. I put my own cake topper on it. Be aware that they don't do writing on the cake. If you want designs, the price goes up considerably. Tina responded very quickly to my email inquiries. Thank you so much! Great business!
2020-04-23,5,This place is Hoboken's best hidden gem! The purple yam cookie is by far the most amazing cookie I have ever had in my life. I like the fact that it is moist and chewy, tastes like yam, and is not too sweet. It's less than $2 and priced very reasonably. They also have cupcakes, macaroons, and cakes, which I have not tried. Customer service is always super warm and friendly. They really brighten up your day.
2020-02-29,4,This place is so good!! I was looking for a cookie store around hoboken and glad I found this place! They have a classic selection of cookies- I was really excited to try the ube cookies! The cookie is soft and moist, not too heavy but right amount to have more than one cookie! The price wasn't listed but I bought 10 cookies for about $20! Which is worth the price! The staff could improve on the attitude! Overall a good place to try it out!
2020-02-24,5,Walked in to this bakery and picked the banana pudding and few cookies. Both were fantastic. Banana pudding was almost like magnolia's but a little pricey. Don't really get the concept of adding tip to bakery but ny husband still left some as he felt he was getting some asian stares :p
2020-02-17,5,I had an awesome experience with Tina and her associate, Dylan. My friend placed an order for a birthday cake and there was a communications snafu between my friend and the bakery. I ended up in the Jersey City location, which doesn't accept pick ups but Tina saved the day - they drove the cake over from Hoboken. It looked fantastic and when I opened the box, the smell was amazing. And, it definitely tasted as good as it smelled! The red velvet cake was moist and the frosting was light with a hint of cream cheese. I will definitely order from them again (and pick up from Hoboken)!
2020-02-06,5,Amazing service!! I love this place so much. Once I ordered a cake for my mom's birthday and it tasted/looked amazing. Also when I got a couple cupcakes and cookies they wrapped it up so nicely with care I was so impressed. Lucky to have this place in Hoboken :) oh also their sea salt chocolate cookie is amazing.
2020-02-03,4,Highly recommend taking the Macaron baking class. The class is fun, easy and laid back. Tina is a sweet woman and a great teacher. She sends you home with instructions so you can recreate the recipe. You leave the class with about 60 macarons.
2020-01-28,4,Cookie craving satisfied! Walked into this small shop to try out their purple yam (Ube) cookie and it did not disappoint. I highly recommend it if you never tried anything Ube before. I'm also the oatmeal cookie type so I tried one and it tasted great, moist with a good ratio of raisins. Wasn't craving chocolate that day but I'll be back to try out all the chocolate cookies. Priced at around $1.50 to $1.75 per cookie. Very reasonable for the quality you receive. Verdict: Will definitely return and it does satisfy your cookie craving.
2019-10-10,5,High quality ingredients meet simple execution. This place doesn't create complicated combinations of flavor profiles. Instead they take the harder approach - making the simple taste outstanding.  I tried two cookies here. Although it was difficult to limit myself. I got a yam cookie and a chocolate chip with oats. Both clearly were fresh, fres, fresh.  The flavor profile of the yam cookie was friendly and like a sugar cookie with a little something extra.  It wasn't too sweet and it wowed me.  The chocolate chip w oats had a wonderful brown sugar note. It was soft and crispy in the perfect way. Not too oaty and the chocolate was excellent.  I debated a cupcake with chocolate icing because I have never seen such a chocolate icing.  The baker told me that the color and consistency was due to the quality of the chocolate. I will be sure to try that next time. So pleasant in the store. It's a little slice of heaven steps away from the manic pace of The Path station.
2019-09-10,5,Cutest small bakery I've been to in a while. I got two chocolate and oat cookies and sat in their only table, working and watching customers come in and be greeted by name. The owners are so kind and make you feel welcome and excited to come by again. They also provide catering for office events. I can't wait to come back and try their crinkle cookie which I've heard so much about.
2019-08-20,5,Cute little bakery. Staff was very friendly and attentive. And hot damn their chocolate chip cookies are the BEST I've ever had. I've had many many chocolate chip cookies in my life as they are my favorite dessert. These did not disappoint. If anything they have made my top 5 list of cookies!! I bought banana pudding for my husband. He said it was good but not great. Can't speak to the pudding but it's so worth going and trying out different things!
2019-08-03,5,This pace was fabulous.  We took a macaron making class here and it was so much fun.  Our instructor was very knowledgeable and we learned a lot. She gave us inside tips on how to make them well at home.
2019-07-19,5,Baking Mama was nice enough to make a cake last minute for my daughter's birthday.  It was a red velvet cake with macaroons.  It was delicious.  The cake was so moist and the frosting was not too sweet.  It has now become my go to place in Hoboken for cake.
2019-07-16,4,A tiny little gem downtown in Hoboken, great assortment of cupcakes, macaroons cookies and brownies, a nice spot for a hidden boutique if you don't want to wait in line for a cup of Joe along with your sweet tooth. No bathroom, they accept credit card or cash. Definitely one of the hidden gems in Hoboken! Go check it out!
2019-06-28,5,Baking Mama made 200 cookies for our son's baptism. To say they were delicious is an understatement! They were soft, chewy, and so flavorful. Guests raved that they were just as good on day 3 as they were on day 1. Highly recommend! Thank you!
2019-06-24,5,Stumbled upon this hidden gem and was quite surprise. Don't let the quaint bakery shop stop you from trying there delectable desserts. I had the red velvet and the dulce de lechce cupcake and it was just so light and not over powering my sweet. My favorite has to be the salted chocolate chip cookie and the crinkle cookie. The crinkle cookie reminds me of a fluffy dark chocolate cake but with more texture. It was very airy and it was like sitting on top of a puffy cloud that was filled with chocolate. Gosh i can't wait to be back to try more of their baked goodies!
2019-06-03,5,Baking Mama has some of the best baked goods in Hoboken! My co-workers and I come here at least once a week. My personal favorite is the Vegan Chocolate Chip cookie - it is moist and slightly cakey which is an extremely delicious combination. The double chocolate and the chocolate cringle are also excellent. The chocolate sea salt is the crowd favorite - it is the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I highly recommend going often and trying as many cookies as you can!
2019-05-13,5,This is hands down my favorite cupcake spot! It's a local shop in Hoboken and I love that they have gluten free and vegan options. Whenever I get their cupcakes, they're always so moist and just the right amount of frosting. I personally prefer the mini cupcakes (so I can have bites of other flavors without feeling too guilty). They also can individually pack regular sized cupcakes, which has come in conveniently at times. My favorite flavor is their dulce de leche  I've also had their banana pudding and chocolate chip cookies. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for delicious cupcakes or any sweet treat!
2019-05-09,5,Excellent! They accommodated a red velvet birthday cake order the day before my pickup day... actually they took my order 15 min prior to closing on a Friday for Saturday pick up.The cake was moist and chocolatey as it should be... totally worth the 30min drive from Teaneck, NJ. They added a piece of fondant and pipped a bday message on top. My 5year old niece loved the cake... especially the fondant :) I highly recommend the crinkle cookie, aka brownie cookie. Chewy and soft at the same time.The bakery is so cute, and looks like a bakery from Europe.I will be back for future cake orders!!!
2019-05-07,5,Baking Mama is amazing.  I emailed last minute and they got my order done so quickly.  The cupcakes not only look delicious but taste it too!  Thank you so much
2019-04-26,5,Amazing! My boyfriend and I stopped in and ordered two lattes with almond milk. We also tried the vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting, a double chocolate chip cookie, red velvet cookie and a chocolate crinkle. The lattes were pretty good, but we've had better. Top of our middle tier. The cupcake was great! The chocolate frosting was very rich. The red velvet cookie was yummy too. Nice color and texture. All of the cookies were baked perfectly! Crunchy edges and soft center. I love them! I'd say overall everything was 9/10. Delicious! And I love that they have gluten free options! Baking mama herself was there and she offers classes for making her French macaroons. She's awesome! The prices aren't bad either. Worth it!
2019-03-11,5,Baking Mama has such a delicious chocolate chip cookie! I tried their chocolate chip cookie with salt, chocolate crinkle cookie, and oatmeal raisin. The chocolate chip and chocolate crinkle cookies were my favorite, with the crinkle cookie tasting kind of like a brownie. The shop is very small and cute; there is no place to sit and have coffee while you eat your cookie, so it is more of an on-the-go or pick-up bakery. I will definitely be back to try more of their delicious treats.
2019-02-24,4,This bakery is cute and quaint, but not as spectacular as I had heard. There weren't as many options I would have expected for a Saturday afternoon. I got the dulce de leche cupcake and it was really dense and hard to finish. Not a dry cupcake, but not great. The macaron was good.
2019-02-02,3,I walk by this shop frequently but today was the first time I've seen it open. I was in search of gluten free goodies and for gf options they had red velvet cupcakes, French macaroons and this flan-type of cake. They had GF cookies but they were not baked. I went for the gf red velvet cupcake, it was $3.50 which seems to be the average price for a gf cupcake. It was definitely very fresh and moist, the frosting was amazing but something about the base was a little off. The shop is cute and the family that runs the place was very nice. I'll be back to try their gf cookies. Update: I made another trip to Baking Mama today and got two of their gluten free chocolate chip with oats cookies. They were $1.80 each. I was expecting a soft, sweet cookie but unfortunately they were a bit hard and there was a strong taste of baking soda. I'm glad this shop offers gluten free options but I think I'll stick with Bluestone Lane in Hoboken for my gf treats, you can't go wrong with any of their pastries!
2018-11-21,5,I have ordered cakes from here twice and couldn't be happier with that decision. The cake pictured is a chocolate icing, chocolate cake which was incredibly moist and truly delicious. Moreover, the bakery opened 30 min early to accommodate my schedule which is amazing beyond words. The macaroons on top of the cake were equally as tasty and a good touch for my worksgiving cake!!! Look no where else in Hoboken for your cake/desert needs.
2018-11-06,5,The cupcakes are life changing. Fresh, delicious, and clearly homemade with care. Carrot cake, red velvet, double chocolate--can't go wrong. I wish this place was further from my office so I didn't have to walk by every day and try to resist the urge.
2018-10-28,5,Baking Mama, just take all my money and give me all the sweet things. Macarons, cappuccinos, chocolate chips cookies and just everything else that is yummy and good. This place is the definition of a little hole in the wall gem. So tiny, so cute and so yummy. Run by a very kind family, you can tell they take pride in every cookie they bake and every coffee they brew. My boyfriend and I stop here a lot on our walk to the path on the weekends. He almost always gets a brownie and I am a sucker for a solid chocolate chip cookie. I've tried the macarons too and they are so light and sweet. I will always get either a cappuccino or just a normal black coffee and I can vouch that they make a mean cup of Joe. One of these days I will stop in, put my usual cookie aside, and try something new like the banana pudding.Baking Mama, you are small in size but big in everything that matters.
2018-10-07,5,Ordered a cake from this place - they were super easy to work with! I did not know the shop is generally closed on Sundays and told them I will pick the cake at noon on a Sunday, they called me right on time to remind and when I couldn't go, delivered it at my place (in Hoboken)! Cake was decorated exactly they had explained and was delicious! Great quality as well as customer service!
2018-09-15,5,Oh mama. You put so many in danger. I stuffed my banana pudding in my backpack to enjoy on the plane. My bag was flagged at Newark's TSA precheck. After thorough examination and consultation with the shift leader, it was determined my pudding was threatening.I was given the option of eating it next to the agents so that I didn't have to wait back in line. Between bites the loud agent would advise, "Everything out of your pockets and no pudding allowed". When he asked me how it was I told him it was light and airy, unlike the traditional rich and silky puddings I'm accustomed too. Call me dangerous but I would buy again.
2018-08-01,5,Late review...but visited this little bakery spot in Hoboken New Jersey area about few weeks ago. I read about the purple yam cookies and decided to try out. Really soft and not too sweet. Banana pudding was also great. Lady staff was really friendly. Definitely recommend anyone to check this bakery for their goods if in the area!The last
2018-07-13,5,Living in CA I had to trust Yelp to help me with treats in Hoboken. Baking Mama was amazing!! They were so helpful when placing my order (having never been here I had to trust the woman on the phone to help me choose). It was a friend's birthday and I needed my items delivered by 10:00 AM on a Saturday. They we happy to help!Now the cupcakes: I am told they were delicious and moist! The macaroons were gone in minutes. Everyone said it was all really good!So I am giving Baking Mama 5 stars for their all around service and treats.
2018-07-13,5,I am in shock. How could I live and walk the streets of Hoboken daily for 5 years and miss this absolute GEM??? I just discovered the best cookie I ever ate at a bakery in Hoboken that I never noticed before. Clearly I need to be more observant!'Baking Mama', on Hudson near Newark. Chocolate chip sea salt cookie. Order it, you won't regret it....it is moist, melt in your mouth, chocolate, sea salt,cookie divinity. So moist, ingredients so fresh, the outside crispy and the inside moist as can be, the flavors are perfectly balanced. How did they do that? Baker wife-and-husband team, Tina and Dominick, are superb bakers, warm and kind. It's a lovely bakery (you feel like you have entered their home, their hearth). They make cookies, cupcakes, macarons, and more!! It's a true labor of love and you can taste that in every bite!!! Thank you for this soul food!!
2018-06-25,5,Ordered a cake here for a baby shower. The ordering process was painless, I got exactly what I asked for, Tina is spectacular at what she does. Everyone asked where I ordered from as the cake was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. Super please with my experience with baking mama!
2018-06-16,5,Ube cookie is great if you know what ube is. Also, went with the classic chocolate chip cookie can't go wrong there. Love this place!
2018-06-15,5,Delicious baked goods and warm service! Always love to support small businesses.
2018-06-08,5,I tried from their pop up shop at Harborside in Jersey City and their ube cookie is PHENOMENAL. Something different than your typical cookie that's definitely worth trying.
2018-06-04,3,I haven't personally been to this bakery, so my review is simply based off ordering from here a few times for delivery. The pastries are okay. The brownie honestly sucked (it was pretty hard & it tasted more like sugar than chocolate), but their dulce de leche cupcake is delicious. The taste has been consistent in the cupcake, & it's my only suggested pastry from here.The macarons are mediocre; I really wanted to love them but they weren't fresh. (I won't fault this bakery too much for this though, as many other places that sell macarons try to carry them for as long as possible & will sell them stale to customers.)
2018-05-24,4,Baking Mama is a small bakery tucked away close to the water in Hoboken. Know. For their macaroons, which are in fact, light, airy fresh and delicious. Their cookies are not to be missed either. They do custom cakes as well. Great place to grab something then head by the water as there is no seating really inside
2018-05-23,5,This place is outstandingly delicious! I happened to get their fresh out of the oven Ube cookie and it was perfect sweetness and moisture. Price is so much better ($1.90 a cookie) than other hip cafes (granted there's no seating but the weather is so nice who wants to sit inside?) I'll be back.
2018-04-21,5,The best cookies I've had in Hoboken. The owners are so welcoming and kind. It's definitely my go to if I'm craving a chocolate cookie.
2018-04-08,5,I walked into this cute bakery with plans on buying the macaroons but walked out with a purple yam cookie. Only one but what was I thinking? Next time I'll try the macaroons and a dozen purple yam cookies. These cookies are soft with the right amount of sweetness. I will be daydreaming about these cookies until I go back.
2018-04-03,5,Baking Mama has gluten free and vegan chocolate chip cookies for those who have certain preferences or allergies.Also they have purple yam flavored things which are amazing as well.I'm glad a bakery in Hoboken has opened up and is actually unique and scrumptious.Though it's tiny I feel special walking in to order something because it's just a comforting atmosphere with good service.
2018-03-23,5,I've probably walked past Baking Mama 50 Times before I noticed the sandwich board out front advertising purple yam cookies! I had to pop in and have a look for myself. This cute little bake shop is brimming with sweet treats and love. I brought home a box of six macarons, and I must report, they are quite good! She offers an array of flavors from lavender white chocolate to bacon, so really there is something for everyone here. I see that the store always offers macaron cooking classes for $100. I think I might have to check out this option so I can add a few new tricks to my kitchen repertoire!
2018-03-09,5,Love their vegan cookies, I hope they would consider making more vegan goodies. . They provide great service.
2018-01-20,5,My weaknesses are brownies and cookies, and the Baking Mama has created the ultimate guilty pleasure: the Crinkle! I was in need of a sweet pick-me-up and found Baking Mama on Yelp and I'm sooooooo happy that I did! I met the Baking Mama herself and she is just as warm and sweet as her desserts! Even though I was super indecisive about which cookies to get, she was super patient and helpful. I ended up getting a Crinkle and I think the heavens were smiling upon me because they were fresh out of the oven and still super warm. It's basically an ooey gooey moist chocolatey brownie in a cookie form - so it has ever so slightly crispy edges. Needless to say, it is perfection and you HAVE TO GET IT. And you better hope that it's fresh outta the oven too because it's seriously next level perfection!! I was super indecisive and also sucked into the affordable prices of $1.65 / cookie so I ended up getting a SECOND cookie. The spicy chocolate cookie had a nice kick, but no joke - the Crinkle is where it's at and everything pales in comparison! The next time I'm back, I'm going to load up on ALL the Crinkles so you better hope we don't cross paths or else you're outta luck!
2017-12-20,5,So happy to finally found this hidden gem in the streets of hoboken! Been craving for crinkles and I thought I had to go to nyc for one! It's not as sweet as others make it so this is heaven for me! Love the texture f the crinkles! All love to this place. A must try is the choco chi with sea salt as well. Crunchy and chewy at the same time. Awesome awesome awesome taste. A must try for those with sweet tooth and specially for someone who doesn't like sweets as well because it's not so sweet! Great customer service and such a clean place.
2017-12-16,5,Tina is amazing. Her recipes are like none other. Go try one macaron and you'll be hooked for life. The filing is rich in flavor and the outside is soft yet crunchy. It doesn't break into a million pieces when you bite into it which is so much better and easier to eat than some of the more famous places. The place is a small hole in the wall but worth the search!
2017-12-03,5,The owners are so sweet & this place has THE BEST macarons in Hoboken! I've tried about ten different flavors and I loved every single one of them.
2017-11-02,5,This review is based on my trial of Gluten Free Choco Chip Cookie.  O M G!  I am a baker myself and I was so impressed w/ this soft and moist cookie - I inhaled 2 on the spot and now obsessing for more!  (I obviously need help!)Seriously, one of the best cookies I have ever had...   PLEASE MAKE MORE GLUTEN FREE PRODUCTS!  I WILL FOREVER BE A DEVOTEE!(Sorry, no photos to add here.  I really INHALED the cookie so quickly!)
2017-10-05,4,Great service and delicious treats, a tiny bit of Paris in Hoboken.
2017-08-24,5,THE BEST CRINKLES. If you don't know what a crinkle is, do yourself a favor and head into Baking Mama and you'll be greeted by the even sweeter Tina (the owner) and her family. Get a crinkle. You won't be disappointed. I now order all of my family's birthday cakes from Baking Mama. If I don't have a special occasion and my sweet tooth calls me into the shop, the cupcakes are a great time (dulce de leche is my personal fave)! It's always awesome to know an owner of a small business pours passion and kindness into her shop. Much success to Baking Mama and family!
2017-08-18,5,Tina at Baking Mama was so easy to work with and as sweet as can be! I emailed her about a cookie idea for my bridal shower and she met with me the next day.  She knew exactly what I wanted and made the most adorable cookie to give as a gift for my guests! Not to mention the cookie was delicious and just the right amount of sweet.   I highly recommend working with Tina!
2017-07-30,3,I have Baking Mama bookmarked for a long time and always wanted to try it. However, the timing never worked out. Finally, I decided to go on a Saturday afternoon. Not sure if they just opened up for the day, the owner and her husband were doing some prep work when I entered.The store was very tiny with an L shaped counter, some storage area in the back, and a table with 2 chairs. I wasn't sure what to order because everything seemed at least a day old. Finally, I saw some cookies laying on the table behind the counter and decided to give it a try. The choco chip with sea salt cookie wasn't bad. It was warm and chewy. My husband wanted to try their vanilla cupcake, which was such a mistake. The cake part was pretty dry and hard. The frosting was crunchy outside and too sweet. It was definitely not fresh.I really wanted to like this place and to support the local business but it just didn't cut it.
2017-07-10,5,They have the best macarons that I have ever tasted. A lot of heart and passion is put into each pastry/dessert by this family. Definitely go here if you're looking to satisfy your sweet tooth!
2017-06-19,5,I was looking for a cake for my boyfriend's early birthday celebration, yet admittedly waited too long to start this process. I've looked up several places in the city as well as in Hoboken to get an idea of the prices and also called to see whether a Saturday morning order was possible. Since I had no success with that, I decided to stop by Baking Mama (with cake boss being my last resort) on my way home and see whether they could fulfill my request. Baking mama is a small, cute bakery which could easily be missed when walking by, I sure did most times even though it's on my way to work/the PATH. The lady who I assume is the baking mama herself was very nice and helpful from the get go. She answered my questions and I ended up ordering a chocolate cake with vanilla frosting. I paid 50% in advance, with the remaining balance to be paid when I pick it up. They don't write on cakes but I did order a message to be pinned to the cake. The cake was ready when promised and everything went smoothly, well minus me not having an umbrella and it pouring on my walk back. I ordered the 8" cake and since I cut somewhat small pieces (worrying it won't be enough for everyone) I'd say we were able to serve close to 15 people with leftovers. I am not a baked goods person in general or cake person in particular, in fact when growing up my mom would get me ice cream cake for my birthdays because that was the only one I liked, but this was a good cake. Multiple people commented on how good it was. All in all, this was a good experience and I definitely recommend it!
2017-06-03,5,I think I've tried every bakery in Hoboken and this is one of the best, even better than Carlos despite the small variety. The selection of baked goods isn't massive but I have yet to try anything bad or 'meh' from them yet. Everything tastes fresh and soft, like the melt in your mouth taste of cookies fresh from the oven, but all her cookies are like that. Really recommend the brownies and any of the cookies. The size is smaller than I would like, but she charges appropriately
2017-05-22,5,Believe the hype and check out Baking Mama. I've enjoyed an array of their treats (brownies, cookies, and cupcakes) and have yet to be even remotely disappointed. In fact, I routinely find myself thinking about a return visit! Each and every time I've ordered, I have encountered freshly baked not-too-sweet desserts with distinct delicious flavors. The prices are also fair (keeping the quality in mind). Hands down my favorite bakery in JC / Hoboken! Check it out!
2017-03-31,3,I ordered on grubhub cause it's raining outside and I was craving something sweet so I was super excited to see a bakery I've been wanting to visit. I ordered:* 6 cupcakes - 2 Red Velvet- Strawberry- Vanilla- Chocolate - Vanilla Dulche de Leche * 3 Macarons- Birthday Cake - Strawberry - Chocolate * 2 Cookies - Crinkle - Sea Salt Chocolate chip Honestly, I was a little underwhelmed because of all the great reviews. I think I liked the macarons the most and both the cupcakes and cookies were only "alright." I lovvvvve red velvet but only when the frosting is cream cheese and unfortunately the cupcake I had had a vanilla frosting, the cakes for all of them except the chocolate was a little too dry for me. My favorite thing I ordered is probably the strawberry macaron, it was light and fresh, and the dulche de leche cupcake... but that's pretty much it. I will order again to give it another try, maybe even go to the actual store and hopefully the cupcakes will not be as dry and they'll change the red velvet frosting.
2017-02-22,5,The BEST bakery cookies that I have ever eaten. I contacted Tina from Baking Mama a month prior to my surprise wedding and asked for three dozen chocolate chip cookies. I called a few days later to increase it to four dozen and they were so nice and allowed me to purchase the four dozen at the quoted price of the three dozen. I contacted them two weeks later for gluten free chocolate chip cookies to be added to my order and they were happy to do it.Honestly, their customer service is beyond incredible. I picked up my cookie favors myself and they were wrapped, ribboned, and boxed up. My guests LOVED the cookies. My photographers even took some home with them. The gluten free cookies were equally as delicious. I can't wait to make my next order. Thank you for everything, Baking Mama.
2017-02-10,5,These cupcakes are in a different league from other Hoboken cupcakes.  Cupcake frosting should be unnaturally delicious and this one is.  The cupcake itself is moist, succulent, tender, flavorful.  Cookies fantastic.  Whoopie pie outstanding.  So much better tasting than anything else in this category in Hoboken.  And they're nice as heck behind the counter.  Must eat more.
2016-11-14,1,I will start with the positives - cute and friendly owners; very clean shop. Negatives - picked up 2 dozen macaroons and they were STALE. I've never had a macaroon crumble b/c it was so crunchy, and yes, I let them come to room temp. Also, I've also never had a macaroon leave food coloring on my lips after taking a bite like the green tea macaroon did. I didn't try their cupcakes or cookies but hopefully they are better than their macaroons.
2016-11-06,5,Talk about a sweet treat in Hoboken! Baking Mama is the quintessential family owned bakery that infuses love and care into every morsel they sell. Though small in size, this storefront is big on flavor. Its like a big warm cookie gave you a hug when you walk in. They have a great variety of sweets from macaroons, to cookies, to cupcakes, to cakes, and brownies, everything you could want from a family owned bakery. Pricing is reasonable and doesn't make you feel sad when you check out. Quality is on point! Im usually a cake product hater, but man o man that cupcake they gave me was good! The worst part of my birthday is usually having to eat cake when people bring one for me, but if it was from here, I'd be a.o.k with that. Their cake products are moist and delicious. Oh! and their macaroons are the best in town, and trust me, I have tried almost every one in the area. Tasty bakery items coupled with the sweetest people on earth running the bakery equals the perfect bake shop combination. Do yourself and favor and pay them a visit.
2016-11-01,5,Brownies and cookies are ridiculously amazing... their coffee is good quality great tasting. Recommend it for anyone craving  dessert or if you need to bring a dessert to a party.Owners are very nice people as well you can tell they use great quality ingredients
2016-10-22,4,I've only stopped here in passing and only for their sea salt chocolate chip cookie. It was really good so I'm tempted to go back. Unfortunately I'm not big on macaroons. And it is difficult to get to this place given the weekday hours. But I'm sure I'll get back to sample some more.
2016-10-18,5,This place is worth every star. The desserts are outstanding (get the red velvet cupcake) and extremely high quality, with the kitchen is right behind the counter.I visited the shop a couple of times and the owners are some of the nicest people I've met. They genuinely care about making great products and their customers. And they offer macaron making classes, which I plan on taking one of these days.
2016-10-18,5,Baking Mama is another great addition to Hoboken! It's a welcome sight on the way to or from the Path; I stop by sometimes as a treat on the way home. Everything they make is very high-quality. The cupcakes are amazing, and the cookies are too! I still need to try the macaroons, but they also look great. The family that runs it is really sweet (pun not intended) and always makes you feel welcome.
2016-09-25,5,Incredible stuff. Much better than Carlos Bakery. And closer to the Path train. Cupcakes and cookies top notch. And immaculately clean.
2016-09-18,4,Great Macaroon bakery! I stopped by for two dozen Macaroons.. It was late in the day so many of their selection was sold out.. However I was able to get about 18 of the 24 I wanted. Would have gotten my fifth star however the 2 dozen Macaroons wouldn't fit in  one container and I was still charged for the 2 dozen. They just doubled up on other flavors. Either way I would def come back. Good stop.
2016-09-15,5,Looking for sweets to take to work?  This is an adorable bakery close to the train station. Everything is made in the store. The woman that helped me was very lovely and cheerful. They have a decent variety of delicious macaroons, cupcakes, cookies, and brownies. I'm looking forward to my next visit.
2016-08-03,5,Super cute new bakery shop.  Delish macaroons.  Try the nutella one.Also cupcakes are good.
2016-07-25,4,I stopped in here to get a couple of macaroons and a water. The place is very cute and tiny.  The macaroons were excellent.  I stayed there for awhile munching and reading and then transferred to sitting at their seating outside.
2016-06-27,1,Was so excited to see a macaroon place right near my work but was terribly disappointed. Not fresh at all and ridiculously overpriced !
2016-06-15,5,Delicious! Just had a cookie and cupcake from here. The cookie was chewy and not too sweet, and the cupcake was moist with great frosting. I'll be ordering my baked goods from Baking Mama!
2016-06-10,5,Got a box of 12 macaroons to bring to a friend's and they were a hit. Really delicious macaroons. I always love supporting the small businesses in Hoboken and this one definitely deserves it with the macaroons they sell. Only thing I wish was if they open a little earlier. Would definitely stop in every morning for a coffee on my way to the path!
2016-05-20,5,Stopped here on a whim after work and I'm so glad I did! I had the sea salt chocolate chip cookie which was delicious but it's the macaroons that will bring me back. I decided on the vanilla, s'mores and salted caramel. Honestly they may be the best macaroons I've had! Highly recommend you stop in.
2016-05-11,4,I picked up some cupcakes and macaroons the other day for a coworker's birthday and everything was really good. We spoke to one of the owners (husband to the actual baking mama) and he was lovely. They were out of red velvet cupcakes so we got chocolate and an assortment of macarons. The cupcakes were so good - very moist and flavorful. In my opinion, they were leagues ahead of Carlo's Bakery cupcakes, which were the only other option for ages and are really mediocre. I hope Baking Mama adds more cupcake flavors soon. The macarons were also great - flavorful and with the right balance of lightness and chewiness.The owner mentioned that they're likely looking to open earlier than nine in the future (good for commuters) and also that they tend to sell out of their bacon macarons first - guess they must be good! He also said they're introducing more coffee products soon - i.e. lattes etc.
2016-05-01,5,Omg. I'm in heaven. The salted caramel and lemon macaroons are unlike anything I've ever tasted. We also tried the sea salt chocolate chip cookies. They were warm, slightly crispy and definitely chewy. This bakery is a great and needed addition to Hoboken! We'll definitely be coming back.
2016-04-30,5,Baking Mama is a small bakeshop & coffee shop in Hoboken, New Jersey located at 88 Hudson St. This cute little shop serves a variety of baked goods. The red velvet cupcakes, chocolate cupcakes were moist, not dry at all, & delicious. The chocolate crinkles were yummy yummy. They also had some banana nut bread cookie squares, it was great too. The most thing I liked in their shop were the french macarons, which I think is their specialty. They were all super delicious, especially the one with bacon in it. That was "the bomb"!!! ... Who knew that bacon & cream, sweet & salty would blend like that?!? ... Yup! They serve coffee too! & Oh, btw, they make cakes to order too. And the best part of it is that you can place orders "ONLINE"!!!. What a great little shop! I would definitely recommend trying them. It's definitely worth it!
2016-04-29,4,Such a cute little shop! I always end up stopping in on my walk home from the path. Tons of macaroons, cupcakes and other baked goods. The owner is a sweetheart.
2016-03-29,4,Stopped into Baking Mama not long after their soft open. The shop has an assortment of baked goods and macaroons. I tried a small box of macaroons and really enjoyed them. Pistachio was not my favorite, but I really enjoyed the vanilla, salted caramel and bacon. Bacon sounds like a weird flavor, but it's actually quite a nice mix of sweet + savory. The filling of each macaroon was super flavorful. Would definitely recommend checking out this shop. They're currently open 9-6. Not sure if they'll eventually open early to do pre-work baked goods + coffee considering they're on the way to the Path train.
