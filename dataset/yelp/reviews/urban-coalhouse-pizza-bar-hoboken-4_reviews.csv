2021-07-09,5,Terrific experience at Urban CoalHouse.  My husband and I hosted a pre-wedding party for our friends & family from out of town and wanted a casual place with good food and plenty of space and this place was perfect.   Arranging everything with Ryan was very easy...so easy that I was worried something was missing but it was all good.   As people started arriving, food started coming out and our amazing server Lydia made sure everyone had what they needed,...food, drinks, you name it.   The wings were a huge hit.  Even people who don't like wings said they loved them.  They were baked rather than fried and so delicious and tender.   Salads were good, the spinach dip was great and the pizzas were outstanding.   People ate the Margherita pies like they were going out of style and the veggie pie with carmelized onions and brussels sprouts was amazing.   One of my friends who can't eat gluten got a gluten free pizza which he liked very much.   There was also penne and chicken parm which people devoured.  Unfortunately I was too full by then and couldn't eat any more.Everyone had an amazing time and I received so many compliments on the food, the venue and the service.    It was really a special night and so memorable.   We look forward to going back soon.
2021-06-21,5,Great food!  We ordered on Saturday, food came super late but not the fault of the restaurant.
2021-06-06,5,Came here today for the first time, we only ordered drinks at the bar but the bartender was extremely friendly and talkative. I would love to come back here to try their food considering my first experience was so lovely. Reasonable beer and drink prices and many TVs to watch sports games.
2021-06-02,2,i was not really impressed with anything.. unfortunately covid has made a lot of establishments completely forget about standards.. most are just victims of everything that has happened.. prob wont return
2021-05-24,2,On a cold May evening air conditioning on full blast -manager refused to lower so good didn't stay hot that long so had to woof it down Meatballs good but sauce cold Wings excellent caramelized onions  stupid Pizza good as wellBest part of experience was the waitress Felt bad as manager didn't listen to people complaining to her about how cold it was Also he had an little issue as I was probably the oldest diner
2021-04-20,5,I travel for a living and decided to eat here on this trip.  I had the Apple salad snd it was delicious. I ordered the wings and I have to say they are THE BEST wings I have ever had. The server was great as well. Try this place now!!!!!!
2021-03-28,4,Went here for lunch a few weekends ago and the service and food was great. I felt that the restaurant was taking all the appropriate covid precautions and had no issues. I'd definitely go back to try their other brunch/lunch foods!
2021-03-19,1,Hi - this obviously is not a mom and pop tiny operation and they price of their pizza reflects this. With the said, when placing a direct order from an establishment like this - I do expect the pizza to arrive on time and warm. Instead - it arrived over an hour late and cold - despite assurances from the management that this would not be the case after having to call in numerous times to check in in my order, which was another horrible experience. The person answering the phones could not hear me because it was super loud in the establishment - I get it if you're busy , but again a business at this price point should have all those things figured out. I got two cold stale pizzas  and a stale garlic bread an hour late  for $60. It was a race against the clock to eat with a four month old and a treat to have great pizza - two huge misses for our Friday night. If that's not robbery - I don't know what is.
2021-02-27,5,This place definitely is a consistent flavor provider. I feel its a great go to spot when you have some friends looking for decent food and drinks at night. We had meatballs and the wings for apps which I thought both were very good. The wings definitely had a unique cook and flavor making it more tender, something im not normally used to, but I enjoyed it!To me though the standout was the pizza. Honestly it was freaking good. I usually get pizza every week, and I would say this was definitely a fresh breath of air. We got the spinach artichoke, and I thought it was phenomenal, the cheese was so tasty and the cook on the pizza was perfect. Crispy and held together every bite. My only complaint was the prices definitely were a tad high, I mean hey, higher quality, higher price I guess!
2021-02-07,1,I placed an order at this pizza store that's a 15 minute drive from my house in order to support a local business.  I asked the lady in the front of my order was ready (I had already received a notification that it was).  After waiting for 15 minutes I asked again and was told that they were waiting on the pizza to be ready.  It wasn't until another customer went behind the table and saw their order that the hostess doubled checked and saw that my order was actually on the table for the past 30 minutes.  I wasted my time waiting and I received cold food.
2020-11-03,1,I called to order a pizza to go on my way over and when I arrived it had just been put in the oven. There was no one inside the restaurant and so when I arrived I asked if I could sit down and eat the pizza inside. The hostess said I was not allowed and those tables were for service only. I said, that was fine, I would tip the server. She replied that I wasn't able to sit there and that I had to take my pizza to go since that's the way I originally ordered it. I thought that was very rude, especially since it was 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon and there was no one around. Also, she was wearing her face mask over her mouth but not over her nose. Why bother wearing a face mask at all? If they are so relaxed about precautions with the hostess I can't imagine what other short cuts are being taken. The pizza was bland and it lacked any sort of flavor. I will not be returning to this place.
2020-09-13,4,This place is great!The starters are all really big, you definitely get your money's worth. We got the calamari and the garlic bread, both really great. The calamari was crispy and plentiful. The garlic bread is essentially a small pizza, so careful when ordering (we over ordered).We ordered two medium pizzas, and they were really good. The crust here is fantastic, they don't over sauce. I love pizza (who doesn't?) and thought it was excellent. Staff is really great here, they get you in quickly and the food comes fast. Recommend!
2020-09-11,5,Lydia is the absolute best.She serves with integrity, a smile, and kindness.
2020-09-03,1,Man I have such low standards for pizza, but what u got was just horrible pizza. My pizza was so over burnt and overcooked, it was like biting into a chip. I would avoid this place.
2020-08-17,5,This is the first time I've visited this establishment and I'm so happy I did! Our server Michael was extremely personable and attentive. I have a gluten allergy and he  was very accommodating to that. People go back to restaurants for the food but a BIG part of it, is the employees. We will definitely be back! Also, wings are Bomb.
2020-08-07,5,My girlfriends and I came for dinner one night during the week and were seated right away. We came on a Wednesday night and the sangria was half price!! Best deal. 2 pitchers for $30 instead of 1! The San Danielle pizza was terrific as was the vodka pizza and the spinach dip. Our waitress was also so nice and welcoming!
2020-07-12,4,Ordered the Don Gregorio pizza and chicken fingers. Really enjoyed both - the chicken fingers were crispy and the portion was large. The pizza was pretty good too. I wouldn't say it's the best pizza I've had in the area but it definitely one of the good ones. Would love to try other food items this place has to offer!
2020-07-11,5,Had a great afternoon at Urban Coalhouse! Michael our server took great care of us despite the fact there was a monsoon out! Food and drinks were great, definitely recommend the wings!!
2020-07-05,2,This places use to be great. Not sure what happened. The last time I ordered from here the pizza arrived cold n the driver got lost getting it to me. I live a few blocks away. Furthermore, my order was incorrect. Came plain when I ordered pepperoni. For $25 for a small pie. Wake up n act professional.
2020-06-28,1,Poor service on the waiter. My husband received 3 different meals while I was still waiting for my one pizza for 45 minutes. I tried to get the waiters attention but she did not acknowledge us. She proceeded to attend to 2 other tables. What looked to be the manager helped us get the food earlier. He proceeded that he will work it out due to the lateness of food but did not come back to follow up. We left very unhappy as the service was not good.
2020-02-08,5,Mike, Justin, and Bobbi were some if the best hosts in all of Hoboken. Urban CoalHouse has become one of our favorite places to go and always recommended!
2020-02-08,5,Great bar for late night drinks and food! Mike, Justin, & Bobbi are the best in Hoboken! Great personalities and conversation on Saturday nights. We definitely plan on making this one of our local  spots
2020-01-04,4,We came for Brunch & Bingo on a Saturday afternoon. Cozy place that filled up very quickly by the time we left around 2pm.We ordered a mimosa and Bellini, both delicious but we preferred the mimosa over Bellini. We also ordered the Coal House Burger which was so delicious, I'd come back just for that burger-didn't care much for the fries. We also ordered two pies- San Danielle and Southwest Urban. Pies were coal fired, thin pizzas, yummy but nothing extraordinary. The burger  was the best thing we ordered.Prices are typical for the area, personal pies $14 each and burger as well was $14. Drinks were $7. Brunch and bingo was definitely a fun time. Would love to come again just for the burger and maybe try a different pizza pie.
2019-12-29,4,Good experience with delivery this weekend! Delivered within 45min (they stated it would be delivered in 50-65min) which was impressive! I ordered house salad and the garlic bread. Salad was good and the house dressing is delicious. Garlic bread was a nice touch, glad I ordered that! Servings are generous as the price is a little expensive for the area but worth it! Everything was fresh and delicious! I would order delivery again! *I also would like to recommend they add French fries to the menu :) I would have definitely ordered along with my salad!!
2019-11-24,1,Arrived on Sunday - only one seat at bar, so we took a table next to it.  Was informed by waiter we could not get the drink specials at our table, only at the bar (literally 1.5 ft away).  Also, the pizza oven wasn't working... pretty big fail all around
2019-11-09,1,Complete and utter joke of a place. We have lived out here for over 3 years and figured that it was time to try this place out. It was 630pm and it wasn't crazy busy and we were sat right away at a high top table. As we were reviewing the menu the man and his kid that was sat after us already was served their drinks and order taken yet we sat there without any acknowledgment. So we waited and waited and still nothing from any waiter meanwhile about 3 of them passed us over and over. Now comes another couple and they were sat next to us at a regular table and would you know it they were greeted promptly so thats when I called it quits and decided that this place doesn't deserve my business. So if you enjoy not being served then this is the place for you otherwise I would highly try somewhere else.
2019-11-04,3,Pros:-decently fast service-quality ingredients-good salads and pizzas-nice atmosphereCons:-they use styrofoam containers -a bit pricey for bar food-no multigrain pasta or pizza options-no vegan labels on menu-cold if u sit near the door / they need a double door to keep the wind from blowing in
2019-09-30,5,One of my to go places on a week night. Tuesdays is half price on house wines which I highly recommend trying. They also good number of options for pizza pies which tastes really good and fresh
2019-09-29,2,After sitting fir 20 minutes and asking to otder, waitress came and took order. 30 minutes later, a pizza was served,  not our drinks, not our appetizers. 10 minutes later my salad arrived. Which was the other entre ordered. At this point I asked where the drinks were. 10  minutes later we got the beer and wine. After dinner was almost done, the calamari appetizer arrived not with balsamic as ordered but with tomato sauce. HORRIBLE SERVICE!! Finally got check after waiting a long time. Wow, not going back.
2019-09-28,4,Since my initial review I have been a number of times to Urban CoalHouse with my husband and honestly I really like coming here.  Yes there have been a few moments where the wait is a little longer because its packed or they are under staffed, but a majority of the time we dont have any of those issues.  The staff is super friendly, the location is great, and the food is good.  Overall I would recommend coming here if you are looking for a fun bar & grill type vibe to watch some of the sports games.
2019-09-27,5,Mike was a great server! Food is always consistent - wings are a must have! We came with our dog and ate outside late on a Friday night. We were seated right away. Mike was very attentive and we enjoyed our dinner on the patio. Will definitely be back soon!
2019-09-27,5,Mike - guy with red beard was excellent!!! Great service, great sense of humor and my 1 year old loved him and his jokes! Will def come back to see Mike and have a great slice of cole fire pizza. Food great for the price, simple and well done.
2019-09-15,5,I am a picky eater so when me and my family went to urban coal house I was unsure what to order. I decided to just get pasta and butter. My family got chicken tenders for the table and I was hesitant to have one however when I did it was delicious. After that I decided to have white pizza since I don't like sauce. They made it perfect. After this it's time for dessert. I don't like cannolis however the waiter tell me how good it was so I decided to order it. It was amazing and the only place I've ever enjoy the cannoli. I highly recommend this place and will come back again. The owner it's so nice and treats every customer with respect.
2019-09-13,4,Great brunch spot. Breakfast pizza with eggs and Brussels sprouts need I say more. They make a pretty good Bloody Mary too.
2019-09-06,2,I thought my evening was going to be enjoyable here.  I was with my family and we all were in a joyous mood, arrived at 6:30pm.  We started w ordering our appetizers and drinks, pitcher of sangria and crushed pineapple. Our appetizers arrived at 7pm, only 1 water was brought to our table to drink.  I thought our other drinks would be out momentarily. I motioned to our server for our drinks and he brought over a jar of cheese, nope sorry he didn't get that hint.  7:10 rolls around and still no drinks. I called our server over to ask if he could take our drinks off since we never received and our meals were almost out. He mentioned there was a shift change and nothing was coming out.  He asked if I wanted him to make the drinks for us, I was just turned off by the whole event.  Having to wait 40 mins to only be told they are having a shift change during a Friday evening at the busiest time is ridiculous.  Mind you the same bartender has been there the whole time we were in the restaurant.  I have been in the service industry for years and being told that was unacceptable.  Not to mention our set never asked how our meal was. Food was alright but the service brought down the stars tremendously. I will not be returning to this establishment. Good luck next time.
2019-09-04,4,We happen to come in on a Monday and got the special for the night. $20 for a pie of pizza and two beers -- I'll take it! I've been wanting to try this place out for a couple years now and finally got to.The atmosphere is really friendly and attentive. I love the look of the whole place with the open doors for outside seating. We chose to sit inside this night.We ordered the San Danielle pie which came with imported prosciutto, fresh arugula, fresh basil, San Marzano tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. We really enjoyed this pie. Mike thought they could use a little more cheese, but I liked it the way it was.I thought there was a lot of arugula, but Mike thought the opposite. So it really is your preference! We enjoyed the type of prosciutto they used for the pie and our waiter recommended ordering gluten-free pizza next time!
2019-08-30,4,Total fanMy brother in law's go to when we go out to eat with his 2 year old!Food is great - SUPER accommodating for the kid Their pizza is Def worth sitting down and staying for... Brussel sprouts on pizza!  YES please (at least from here)And I LOVE that there is a photo opt for the dog outside! @standalilman approves !
2019-08-13,2,Booked a table for two via the Seated app for a Friday night at 8. The restaurant was pretty empty, which should have been a warning sign for us. But we still decided to try it anyway since we've never been there before. You can't go wrong with pizza and pasta, right? WRONG.Things actually started well. We ordered the meatballs as an app, which was pretty good. But then we got to the mains. My BF and I decided to order a pizza and a pasta to share. For the pizza, we had the medium San Daniele (prosciutto, arugula, basil, San Marzano tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, EVOO). For the pasta, we did the penne vodka. Both were SO SALTY that our tongues were numb after the meal. The ingredients on the pizza were not bad, but I'm just not sure why they had to dump a mound of salt on top of it. The pasta was even worse. I had to have each bite with a bite of crust, just to make it semi-palatable. On top of that, it was more like a marinara sauce than a vodka sauce. They must have run out of heavy cream in the back.To conclude, while the meatballs were good, they're not enough for me to want to make a return trip to this spot.
2019-08-10,2,I've been to Urban CoalHouse Pizza and Bar a few times, and every time I've been, the food is always pretty good (amazing wings) but the service is terrible. The servers all seem to be irritated that you're even there. Would recommend if you don't care about quality service and are fine with decent pizza.
2019-08-06,3,Lunch review:Staff was very friendly, attentive and helpfulAmbiance and decore was tastefulFood (chicken parm sandwich and Caeser salad) was mediocre.  Sandwich lacked flavor, was dry/not enough sauce and the chicken was overcooked.  Salad looked good, but dressing, croutons and cheese had an overwhelming bitter taste.
2019-08-02,3,I loved coal house when it first opened but after a few years it is not my main choice for Italian in Hoboken. It is a great atmosphere and good for groups but would recommend for pizza only. The buffalo chicken meatballs were very very dry and almost tasteless. Would not order again and had turned me away from anything outside of pizza. Service has always been great and friendly.
2019-08-02,4,Overall good experience!We started with drinks and the eggplant rollatini, which was so good! Something about the sauce!We shared two personal pies, the brussel sprout and the Milano, both really good with very different tastes. Service was fine, nothing exceptional, but maybe a little inattentive for the lack of crowd that night. However, that would in no way stop me from going back!
2019-06-23,2,We've been here once prior and had a similar issue but returned since the food was quite tasty. After being seated outside in the front of the restaurant, we waited a full 20 minutes before going inside to ask for a waiter/waitress. We hadn't even been greeted or provided water.  The hostess was shocked and sent a waitress to our table. The hostess accused the waitress, and the waitress apologized and accused the hostess. Once ordered, the food came out promptly from one of the food runners. However, our waitress returned not once during our meal to ask if we needed anything or if the food came out okay. After eating every last piece of the meal, we then waited approximately 15 minutes before going inside yet again to ask for the check. Both myself and my guest needed another drink for the past half an hour and never had the chance to get a refill. Once the waitress then brought out the check, it took another 10 minutes for her to retrieve the check. When she returned, no apologies and no "thank you for coming!" While the food was tasty, I do not plan on returning as both times my service has been atrocious. Do not recommend if you are hoping for timely service.
2019-06-22,5,Really great food and even better service. The food was delicious and the entree was actually a great sharing size. Mike was our server and really took care of my boyfriend and I. He even suggested and brought out a speciality cocktail off the menu for my boyfriend, which he loved. We will be back for more !
2019-06-08,5,They may not have the most gluten free options but their gluten free  pizza was probably the best that I've had.
2019-05-27,1,Walked in and was seated immediately. We were handed menus and then 20 minutes passed and no one came to take our drink or food order. The restaurant was 70% empty.
2019-05-25,5,This is my favorite place on earth, best sangria I ever had. Reminds me of "cheers". I know everyone by name and they are the best. I had some wonderful times here and it breaks my heart that the Paramus location is closing and moving somewhere further away. If only they could wait until the old Sears wing reopens with the movie theatre. Would have been great for business. Just my luck!  Can't tell you how sad I am...
2019-04-26,5,I can't even describe in enough words how great this place is.  The food.  The manager. The employees. I just ran into my first mixup and it was my fault placing the order and already while I'm typing there is someone coming up to the apartment with a new order.  You would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not go dine or order from this place
2019-03-25,2,Went to Urban Coalhouse for dinner on a Monday night. We got there around 7pm and there was only one other table and no one was at the bar either. We ordered a personal size pepperoni pizza and an order of meatballs. The meatballs were supposed to be four but there was only three and a half (it looked like it had been cut). The flavor of the meatballs were good but the sauce was a little sweet. The pizza left a lot to be desired. For a personal size, it's definitely on the larger side. Sauce was uneven and the crust could use some more color. The pepperoni they used ended up with a very nice crisp.Overall it was just an okay experience. Tough to say if I'd return. We didn't order any drinks tonight but the bar seemed like they had a great selection of beers.
2019-03-24,4,They have the best baked wings. They comes with some of the tastiest onions on top as well. Definitely a nice variation from your traditional buffalo wings. I'd go back for these anytime. I've also tried the Margherita pizza. It was decent, but not anything I'd go out of my way for.
2019-03-09,3,Came to urban coal house on a Fri evening in March with a reservation for 6 at 745pm. Two of us got here 10 min early and they actually had our table ready despite being packed so have to give this place credit for that!! Unfortunately we were in a separate area with a dozen screaming 7 year old boys....they left half way through our dinner thankfully. We ordered a few apps for the table - 2 eggplant rollatini dishes, balsamic calamari and grilled octopus. They were out of the octopus so we got the spinach artichoke dip instead. The rollatini are 3 to an order and are enormous. We definitely could have split them each in half for 6 and didn't need 2 orders (waitress should have told us this). The balsamic calamari was really good! Spinach artichoke dip on crostini was tasty as well. I'll add before the apps we all places drink orders and they were out of 4 of the beers we asked for. There's a decent craft beer list so we all picked new ones, but kind of odd they were out of them. Fine if the keg runs out, but the server should have told us beforehand.Pizza. We split two large pies - one margherita and one margherita with half broccoli rabe and then half mushroom/bell pepper. When the pies first came out, it was pepper and onion not mushroom and pepper so we had to send that pie back. We started with the normal margherita and it was a decent slice. The slices were definitely floppy so toppings fell off easily. Crust could have been more crisp to prevent this or less sauce on the slice. All in all average dinner.
2019-03-03,5,Busy Saturday night but we were seated almost immediately (with a reservation). Our server Megan was very attentive.....brought over water right away while we were pondering our beverage choices. When they were out of the Cabernet I chose, she came back with a suggestion/substitution and waited while I tasted it to make sure I was happy (I was). Large Arugala salad was plenty for the 4 and the lemon vinaigrette tasted amazing with the artichokes.....winning combo! 3 medium pizzas....margherita, Milano and a sausage and mushroom came out quickly after salad was finished.....all delicious! Very impressed with all employees we came in contact with.....despite it being VERY busy, all seemed happy to be there and more importantly, happy to have us at their establishment!
2019-03-02,5,On the corner of 14th Street and Bloomfield lies a golden oasis of delicious beer and pizza. Its name? Urban Coalhouse. Since moving to Hoboken, I've been hard pressed to find a better pizza and beer joint in the whole area. You want a giant slice? Go to Benny's. Want typical pizza? Hit up Uptown Pizzeria. But if you want killer thin crust, wings, meatballs, brussles sprouts, delicious beer and a killer soundtrack to enjoy all of that, check out Urban Coalhouse!
2019-03-02,5,Love this place the food, atmosphere  everything.  Evelyn is amazing.  Will continue to spend my Saturdays here.  Great service.  Great people.  Thank you.
2019-02-21,5,A highlight of Hoboken after moving here from the city a year ago with a toddler and infant....by far the the best customer service, kid friendly, sports bar in uptown Hoboken...staff is warm and welcoming at all times....the service and food are excellent and always consistent...outstanding and diverse tap beer selection...great coalfire pizza.....best place to catch a game with plenty of tv's and bar.....Especially great for kids as I often take my 2 year old out to dinner to give her mom a break at end of day and Coalhouse is our go too....we never feel like a nuisance to employees, unlike other spots in the area and are always welcomed by a dish of focaccia bread for my daughter  and a cold beer for me....one employee in particular that embodies the excellent service described above and makes Coalhouse especially welcoming for us is Kianna, who has always gone out of her way making us feel welcomed, whether it be cheering up a grumpy toddler or making sure dad's beer mug is full!
2019-02-20,5,Love going on Tuesday's to get the Rosé and, it's half off wine. Kiana's amazing and always on point. The food is great.
2019-02-20,5,I've been to the coal house a couple times the staff is great especially Jonathan he was super attentive and shows great service. The food there is also amazing ! Would deff recommend to anyone in the Hoboken area.
2019-02-17,1,Terrible service. Terrible food. No need to go back here. Wasn't impressed with anything.
2019-02-09,2,Not sure I would return, food was just average bar food. Jack of all trades, master of none would come to mind, maybe. Good for sports, and a beer.
2019-02-04,3,I've been to Urban Coalhouse several times since I live very close by.  They have great beer specials all day on Saturdays & Sundays if you sit at the bar and free trivia on Saturday nights.  Their food is decent - I really like their balsamic calamari and the don gregorio (meat) pie.  Service can be hit or miss depending on how crowded it is.  This review however reflects my most recent experience on Super bowl Sunday.  I came to sit at the bar to watch the game for the super bowl.  The food on Super Bowl Sunday was below average.  The restaurant prides itself on 'award winning' wings yet the order we got was pitiful.  They are supposed to be smothered with over roasted onions and come with focaccia bread.  When the wings came out, they were missing the onions and bread.  I asked the bartender about this and he said they ran out of both.  He could have told us this in advance of us ordering the wings - had we known we probably would not have ordered then.  They also could've given us a break on the cost.  We also ordered a medium margarita pie.  The pie was under-cooked.  You could tell they were very busy with takeout/delivery pizza orders and as a result the food suffered.  The other annoying thing was the pizza chefs kept  banging the ceramic plates - it was very loud and it went on during their entire busy rush.  I'm surprised they weren't shattering how hard they were dropping them.   By the time half-time came along, they had slowed down and the noise stopped. There are several pizza options in town and Urban's is average.  I'll still come here for the drink specials and because it's close.
2019-01-28,4,A very good place for Pizza, Wings and Drinks on the North end of Hoboken. Service is attentive, the food is solid and its all priced well. The pizza, while basic, is thin crust with a good chew. The fried calamari with balsamic reduction & cherry peppers were also great. The wings are seasoned perfectly and are a great alternative to the fried/buffalo variety. Their menu is expansive and I need to try other things next time.They have a 7 day a week happy hour til 8pm at the bar too.  Extensive beer selection and strong drinks. Place always has a crowd, especially when there's a live sporting event on. Will try the Red Bank location too soon. Recommended!
2019-01-22,3,Went for a group lunch this past weekend. We got two orders of fried calamari and 3 pizzas. The food was fine, though not particularly memorable. The calamari was really good though. The pizzas were just okay. Neither amazing nor bad. Service was good. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. There's no shortage of pizza options in Hoboken, so I don't see myself prioritizing coming back to Urban Coalhouse too soon, but we'll see.
2019-01-10,2,Food was great and service was bad. I sat at the bar. The bartender acknowledged me when I first sat down, but cleared plates from someone else before serving me and then gave me an attitude when I asked for the menu. It was not many people there when I arrived and although the food came out fast, the bar service was slow and the bartender left me alone for the most part, which was probably due to her giving me an attitude as a first impression. I wasn't allowed to purchase a personal gluten free pizza, so I couldn't have the pizza I drove an hour to taste. I'll provably never come back even though the food was good unless I sit at a table.
2019-01-06,1,We walked in last night (Saturday) during a playoff football game.  Most of the bars with TVs in Hoboken would have the sound playing through the speakers but I'll give them a pass for that.  Instead they had some dumb trivia on a Saturday night! First of all, no one wants to hear random facts on a Saturday night when they are trying to have either a date night with their significant other or trying to close the deal on their 3rd date. Secondly, know your audience and save the trivia for the losers on the weekdays like 99% of the other bars.  Advice - go anywhere but here on a Saturday night unless your one of those losers that wants to hear lame trivia.  And if you are that one case that likes trivia on a Saturday night, good luck in life.
2019-01-04,5,My husband and I love to come here for our Friday night go-to restaurant. Great food and goatmosphere. Best server is Mike. He couldn't be more accommodating and friendly. Always has a great smile and just makes it so pleasant to be here. I highly recommend this restaurant.
2019-01-03,5,This is by far one of the best places to eat,Ryan was awesome, we had a great time and enjoyed Atmosphere here.
2019-01-03,5,Mike is the best  , service was awesome the food tasted perfectly enjoyed the buffalo Cesar salad and soup I will definitely come back again
2018-12-11,2,I feel terrible writing a negative review because I am obsessed with the menu here for both food and drinks. However, there has been one server in particular who has provided terrible service both times I have been there to eat in the past couple of months. A young man who was wearing a red holiday blazer this past weekend served us. He was polite both times but had extremely low energy and no sense of urgency. He sat for about 15 minutes rolling silverware in the back without checking in on our table, while we sat waiting to place another drink order. After serving our food, he never came back to check on us or offer to clear any plates. I enjoyed the holiday drink menu and have always enjoyed the food so much (I love takeout because i live close). I cannot see myself dining in again, because I worry about having this experience again.
2018-12-08,1,The penne in my two orders of chicken parm were raw. Their "award winning" wings were also raw. The only thing edible was the garlic bread and the meatballs. I called to discuss this with managment and was informed that they don't deliver to my area and their hands "were tied".
2018-12-06,3,We came here for dinner. The food is great (you can pretty much get any of the pizzas and it will be tasty - we tried four amongst the group), and the happy hour specials are good deals. The stars off are for the service. It was not massively crowded, yet our waiter kept disappearing. We'd ask for a water refill and not see him for fifteen minutes. It was to the point where I really think we added over half an hour to our meal just waiting for him. I'd be willing to try again and hope for better service, but this waiter was pretty unacceptable.
2018-12-03,2,My husband and I made the mistake of coming here for dinner on Saturday night.  We had no idea that Saturday at 9PM is their trivia night.. Crazy that a restaurant/bar would host their trivia game on the prime night of the week.  The trivia was so loud and took over the entire place.  We wanted to stay for more drinks, but instead, had our pizza wrapped and got the check.  The food was ok.  The balsamic calamari was good. We didn't realize that the prosciutto/arugula pizza (San Danielle) came on top of a red sauce which is a very odd combo.  We took the other 2 pizzas we didn't finish to go and left that one there.
2018-11-29,5,Great place. Good food. Don Gregorio pizza loaded with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs is my favorite. The chicken wings a must have!! They have great deals every day. Favorite night Wednesday $15 sangria pitcher and $6 meatballs. Our waitress Jamie assisted by Kiana provided a very welcoming experience. This is definitely a place we will come back
2018-11-23,5,Realy good food but really busy ! Everything took forever but worth the wait! Had the garlic bread, eggplant rolintini was excellent super cheesy and saucy  && a ceasar salad with tuna
2018-11-20,4,Solid pizza. Solid wings. Solid beer. Industrial look pairs nicely with the Smokey coal aroma. They bust open the garage doors when it's warm, great place all seasons
2018-11-14,4,Went for Good Beer Passport DinnerFood - 4/5. Pizza had a pretty good dough that gave a nice chew although I would've like a bit more color to really make it taste like it came out of a brick oven. The prosciutto and arugula were tasty themselves but being raw, it felt a bit pointless to be on top of the pizza as it would've been the same if these ingredients were served to you on the side. The sauce and cheese were both pretty good.Service - 4/5. Service was friendly and although our waitress seemed fairly new, she was on top of things and available when needed.Value - 4/5. The artisan pies run at $13 for a personal size in any flavor. The portion size of the  personal pie is more than enough for most and the price is fairly average for the area. However, when compared to the numerous amounts of pizzerias in the area, I feel the price and food doesn't really stand out.Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-10-18,2,I was very excited to try this place in Hoboken, it looks very nice with a woody rusty undertones look. I was not impressed at all with theirs drinks, the Sangria was turn off. Appetizers were a come down.  The avocado toast was good though, I have to admit. I hope they were just having a bad day and we probably did not order the right stuff. Should probably try their pizza, before putting them off my list.
2018-10-15,3,After hearing so many different reviews of Urban Coalhouse, I had not made visiting it a real priority.  However, when I was walking by its open façade on a busy Football Sunday, I was drawn into the buzz in order to sample their brunch.  I started with a Bloody Mary, which was bold, peppery, and spicy.  It came with an abundance of garnishes, such as 3 plump, green olives, lemon and lime slices, and a huge slab of crispy bacon.  It was much better than expected from a more Italian restaurant.  My companion selected a Manhattan from the menu, which our server noted on the tab before heading off to place our orders.  She then quickly returned to say that the bar did not have the necessary bourbon for the cocktail.  When he inquired about what types of whiskey they had instead, she mentioned incomparable substitutes, such as Fireball and Jack Daniels.  She seemed completely clueless, and we were not sure that the bartender was any better.  My companion was annoyed and just asked for a Jack & Coke instead, which apparently came out alright.  After that hiccup, we were not sure what to expect from our food order.  My House Salad was a step above the norm, including Mediterranean toppings, such as cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, celery, and Kalamata olives.  I selected the Personal size portion, which was the perfect amount, and I also added Grilled Shrimp for some extra substance.  The marinade on the perfectly cooked shrimp was herbaceous and flavorful.  My partner ordered Panko-Crusted Chicken Fingers, which appeared a bit more fried than I would have enjoyed.  The side of French Fries was sprinkled with seasoning, but still tasted rather bland.  Overall, Urban Coalhouse provided decent food and drinks in a fun-filled environment, but it was far from an upscale, refined restaurant.
2018-10-14,1,I was seated st a table Sunday afternoon  and the place was about 85 percent full.  There were football games on and I came to finish watching my team . The host sat me with menus and I said I would be ordering something to drink . I was excited to try some of their cocktails .  I sat here for an entire hour with waitresses and managers walking by me over and over and I was never served the entire time I was there - not even water was served but it was given to other tables . I was occupied by the game  and thought at first they would get to me at some point but they never did . How does this place stay in business with such disregard for customers ?
2018-10-05,5,Stopped in for some good local food and a good local brew. Sat at Sarah's bar. She gave me a small sample of Hoboken Blonde, a local IPA.  Ordered a pint & then another. A chicken parm sandwich was her food recommendation... Good beer, good food, great place... Sarah for President! !
2018-09-27,4,not sure what the 3 star hateration is all about. UCPB was really accommodating during my friends huge bday party. the service didnt get angry and kick us to the curb. instead they provided us w lots of pizzas and other treats. btw the pizza here is dope. its on the thin side which im into because that means you can eat 5x as much. the sauce to cheese ratio was on point. fyi this spot has tons of bar seating and a lot of tvs and outdoor tables
2018-09-26,2,Ordered pizza for lunch.. it was long delivery and all the food came cold and not so good.. very disappointed!
2018-09-15,3,First time here and went for brunch. No wait for a table, nice atmosphere, friendly waitress. I don't know what the deal was with the kitchen, though. 2/4 of our meals came out pretty quickly (not exactly what we ordered but it was ok, didn't need to send it back). The 2 pizzas we ordered took an extra 20+ minutes! The wait would have been perfectly acceptable if all the food came together but it was ridiculous to serve half the food so much earlier. The 2 with food early just waited for the other 2 and by the time their food was cold/stale. All said, the food and coffee really were delicious and the place was cute but the service from the kitchen was just bad.
2018-09-05,2,Decent pie. I got vodka chicken pizza. It was good but the restaurant was kinda "eh" There was a massive leak in ceiling, the bathrooms were disgusting and the staff was all hanging around the bar. I went once before and it was great, this time just not a pleasant experience. I would still come back but not anytime soon.
2018-08-30,5,Just had this for the second time in my life. Food was fantastic. We ordered delivery, got here relatively fast and everything was fresh and delicious. I will defiantly be ordering from here again.
2018-08-26,5,I came here with a reservation for Sunday brunch at 11am(Urban coal house opens at 11am). My party was quickly seated. The brunch cocktails ranged from $7-$11, and I ordered a $7 mimosa (they were out of ingredients for bellini's). The mimosa was pretty strong than other brunch places I've tried- more bang for your buck! I ordered the Avocado Benedict for my entree ($13) without bacon. It came with the most tasty and savory hollandaise sauce I ever had! It was creamy and seasoned well! The avocado made the meal filling, but the poached eggs could have been cooked for a little longer in my opinion. Can't wait to come back to get this dish again! !
2018-08-22,5,in love with their meatballs .. and our server kiana was a delight very tentative and professional definitely will be going back !
2018-08-22,4,Not too much to report on because I was in and out fast. I sat at the bar and ordered chicken fingers and a beer. But even though my visit was short it was a pleasant one!Even though this is a pizza joint the chicken fingers were slamming. Perfectly fried and golden brown and extra crispy which is always my favorite. Honestly, not all chicken fingers are created equal and these are some of the better ones that I have. The menu is pretty large and all of the pizza pies sound amazing, but there are also lots of other options like salads, apps, etc. Service at the bar was super speedy and there are a ton of beers on tap. The interior is industrial and modern - lots of exposed brick and exposed air ducts - that sort of vibe. There are also plenty of tvs if you come in to watch a game. Next time I'm looking for a dinner spot in uptown 'boken I'd definitely throw Urban Coalhouse into the consideration set. It's a the perfect spot for easy to please bar food and beer, and the ambiance is warm and inviting.
2018-08-10,5,I've ordered delivery from this restaurant many times and have also dined in with a large group of friends. The menu has a good variety of foods to accommodate everyone's taste. Their salads are delicious and great to share with another person as an appetizer. The pizza...ALL of the pizzas are delicious and well portioned. The dough is a perfect mix of crispy and soft and might just be my favorite in Hoboken. Oddly enough my favorite menu item is actually the chicken fingers. They're so light and crispy and I just love the dipping sauce. What puts me over the edge to give this place 5 stars is that they were extremely accommodating when I dined there with my mom friends and several babies. They helped us put a bunch of tables together and somehow helped us fit all of our strollers. If your looking for a nice lunch spot or even casual dinner this place is a must!
2018-07-30,3,Pizza review only. It was bad. Terrible cheese. Not enough sauce. Crust not great. See pics.
2018-07-25,3,Instead of our usual Napoli's for pizza, my husband and I changed it up and tried Urban Coalhouse Pizza.   Overall, we liked the vibe of the restaurant and they had some good apps (some were gluten free). I ordered a gluten free pizza with sausage while my husband got a meat lovers pizza.  The gluten free pizza I thought was good, not great.  If I go back I would order without the sausage. Overall I would be willing to give it another shot, but Napoli's is still number 1 in Hoboken for gluten free pizza as of now.
2018-07-20,5,Great happy hour ! 5$ beer and wine and well drinks! Monday-Friday 4-7. And all day sat and sun ! They are known for there oven baked wings with onions. And are also #17 on top 100 pizza issue on the pizza today! Friendly staff great food!
2018-07-15,2,I walked into the Urban Coalhouse at around 11:45am and was immediately seated. No one came to our table until around 12:20pm. I brought up this issue up to the hostess and then to another young lady passing by and they said someone would assist us. Eventually someone took our order and the food took about an hour to get to our table. The food was delicious but the service was awful. All I received was a sorry and a thanks for my patience for the wait instead I could have been offered a free drink for my "patience." I will not ever return here and it's very sad because the restaurant has a lot of potential and a great variety on there menu but customers will be driven due to the long wait.
2018-07-03,2,Service was very slow and pizza was subpar. There are many better pizza places in the area. Would not recommend.
2018-06-23,1,Overpriced. The menu prices online didn't match what we were charged for take out. There's no excuse to lie about pricing. With so many better options this place isn't worth spending money on. I bet this place will close soon.
2018-06-09,4,I pass this place by walking often and it always looks like it has a nice, easy vibe. My boyfriend and I went here to eat outside with our dog. The place was super accommodating about the 3rd, 4-legged guest. Personally, I loved this place and would go back in a heartbeat. My boyfriend was less impressed (I am a thin crust pizza gal while he is not). Its a great casual atmosphere and perfect for a weeknight.
2018-06-04,5,We went here yesterday, for the first time, with my family for dinner. Not a big menu to choose from which is a good thing... We all had a delicious arugula salad, that was super fresh, with small cherry tomatoes, padano cheese, and a light lemon dressing, definitely made with love. Then we had their five star coal fired thin crust pizza with mushrooms and onions, with just the right amount of coal fired taste. every morsel was delicious right down to its perfectly salted crust!  My daughter, and my husband loved their tasty meatballs, I am a vegetarian who almost tried them as they looked so scrumptious. Of course, this review could not be complete without mentioning our awesome server Jen F. thank you Jen for being nothing short of professional, and always served us with a smile, it was greatly appreciated. We can not wait to go back there again soon. We live twenty miles away, but will definitely be going back for seconds, thirds and more. We sat outside and enjoyed people watching. I love that it is located on a corner.Prices are very reasonable and beer was ice cold. I am sorry that I never went inside to check it out, another reason for us to go back.
2018-06-03,2,Every time I make a reservation, I end up waiting at least 30 minutes. Poorly organized.The worst was when a small group of friends and I had made a reservation so we could be seated to play trivia. Another group of the same size came in 15 minutes after us and after some serious complaining, they were seated before us. The managers had completely forgotten we were there and when asked they just said "sorry it's crazy tonight". Not good. We were seated after waiting 45 minutes with a reservation. Saturday night trivia is fun but if this is how they want to run their operation, we won't be back. Food is "ok".
2018-05-30,4,Wasn't truly impressed with the pizza, but the service provided was great.My coworker and I went here for lunch because we got gift cards from our bosses. We were greeted as soon as we came in and seated right away, only a few others were there. We both order the lunch special which was a personal pie with either a soup or salad. He got the bye bye Buffalo pizza and I got the vodka pizza. The Vodka pie was way better than the buffalo pie. The buffalo was just heat, sprinkles, of chicken and crust. The vodka pie tasted fresh, was just like eating the pasta and pizza at the same time. I'd like to go back here, maybe to watch a game. The bar atmosphere looked nice. There was multiple TVs all around.
2018-05-21,3,Ordered takeout pizza and wings on a Monday. Decent delivery time through Uber eats. The pizza was decent, nothing to write home about but satisfying. The wings, now that's another story. Ordered 2 orders of hot wings. They are not traditional hot wings. They come grilled with onions with the hot sauce on the side, which wasn't what we expecting. Lastly they are all the drum sticks, there were no wing parts in 20 pieces. How is that possible? Maybe it's me but I prefer the wing and would have appreciate the variety of pieces.
2018-05-20,3,I love dining in but have had subpar delivery service two times. Most recently, My order arrived and the pizza was COLD. Really cold. I got a GF pie so even after warming it up myself (which I shouldn't have to do) it wasn't the same. The crust was so hard, my jaw hurt from chewing it. The toppings were skimpy too. There was a lot of bare crust.
2018-05-19,5,This place is great! It's very hard to find meatballs that are good at a restaurant, but they are great here. I'm on a Keto diet so the meatballs along with the broccoli rabe (which is cooked properly and easy to chew) is my go to meal. Watch the huge garlic cloves in the broccoli rabe though or else you'll be offending people left and right. You might be like 'wtf, I just ate a huge garlic clove!' and someone next to you may be like 'Dude, you just cursed. Please be respectful'. Also your breath will stink, so pick them out. The Pizza: My kids love it. They kick it old school and only order the plain pie, but they offer a lot of toppings. Also, it seems like a cool place to have a nice cold beer on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon, but I haven't done that yet.
2018-05-13,5,Urban Coalhouse has the BEST gluten free pizza I have ever had!  It's rough finding good gf pizza that doesn't taste like cardboard, and they have perfected it!  Thin, crunchy crust, amazing sauce, great "personal" size, generous portion!  It's my go-to pizza!
2018-05-12,4,I'm genuinely surprised with the lower rating this place has. The pizza was some of the best I've had in a long time. It's not super artisanal like Dozzinos, but much more so than your typical by the slice places. The end result here is a pie that has a crust that is super light and airy. The Milano pizza had a really nice mix of garlic and artichoke with creamy ricotta. We were big fans of this one. The plain pie also was really good, with that's same light and airy crust. We also had the arugula salad, which was refreshing with a really nice vinaigrette. We had ordered one of the chicken parms for our little dude, and the portion was absolutely massive. Left overs for days. Prices were ok, coming out to about $50 after tax / before tip for the salad, two personal pies (which we had 2 slices leftover of each), the chicken parm, and a beer. Don't let the lower stars on this place deter you. You'll be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was.
2018-05-09,4,The food is really good here! I'm a big fan of the arugula salad - it is very refreshing and tasty. The pizza is always fresh and you can tell that they're using high-quality ingredients. The only reason I give 4 stars and not 5 is because the service is a little ehh. Sometimes you get a good server, sometimes you don't. But the food is always consistent so I'll be back.
2018-05-06,4,Great pizza , mediocre service . This place is always crowded and never can seem to staff appropriately.  The atmosphere is fun and upbeat . They have delicious sangria and a great selection of beer on tap . One of my favorite pizzas is the classic pepperoni . Also try the meatballs as an appetizer , there delicious!
2018-05-06,4,Urban Coalhouse is a great spot for lunch, dinner or drinks in Hoboken. It has outdoor seating which is great on a summer day - I prefer the indoor area for nighttime, as it's high-energy inside. The pizzas are all very good - my favorites are the Don Gregorio and Spinach Artichoke pie. The Cucumber Strawberry Smash cocktail is amazing - when I had it, I think it could've been a little stronger, but the taste was delicious. Overall, I recommend for a more casual/fun spot in Hoboken!
2018-05-05,1,Saltiest pizza and toppings ever!!!  Was to to disguise bad taste?  Better to be lighter on salt though I know restaurants use this tactic to make people think their dishes are good...really wanted to like it here too...
2018-04-27,2,Really bad day at Urban Coalhouse Hoboken. Went to pick up a carry out order. 30 minutes after the pick up time my order was still not ready. Finally, my order was ready and I left. Got home and unpacked my order. I found a half cooked pizza and cold, over cooked wings.  A wasted $30.00. The management team needs to get this straightened out. They used to be very, very good.
2018-04-06,4,We tried the personal pizza for the lunch during weekday. Each personal pizza comes with a salad or soup. We ordered all kinds of pizza and each of them all tasted unique and great and not very oily. If you're Hoboken museum member you can get 20% off.
2018-03-24,4,This place is good for everything​. A simple pasta, great salads, ​and kick ass wings. The pizza is really good quality and has great flavor. Its a great spot for a girls night or a big family dinner. Service is great and prices are good; highly recommend​!
2018-03-14,5,Great pizza great chicken fingers. My server Elias was verry attentive helpful and polite. I will defiantly be returning
2018-01-27,5,Urban is the place to be on a Saturday night in Hoboken! Sarah and Evey on the best!!!
2018-01-21,5,Pizza is great, coal fire cooked so a slightly different less greasy style. Roasted wings are also different but delicious. Delivery is prompt. Have eaten here in person and in takeout, it's one of my go to places.
2018-01-14,5,I've been in Hoboken for about 1 year and finally made my way over to urban coalhouse. I ordered a large pizza which was amazing! The Thin crust was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce on top was delicious. One of the best pizzas I've had in Hoboken. I will definitely be a regular customer.
2017-12-27,5,I went here for Trivia Night. I had a blast. I also had pizza. And I had a blast eating the pizza.The staff working were helpful and nice. I love the ambiance here.Perhaps the only complaint I have is lack of space - it was like bumper to bumper with people having to fight a wave of people to get through - but as the night led on and people started to leave, there was more room to move and sit. I think it's a good complaint to have - you'd rather have more people than less!
2017-12-26,5,Great little pizza place in uptown hoboken! Have dined in and ordered out numerous times and all have been really good! Ordering the chicken wings is a must! Pizzas are really good thin crust! Love the dog friendly outdoor dining in the summer!
2017-12-08,2,This place looked nice! But the pizza was not very good. Bland, weird flavors, not satisfying at all. We got a large pie half plain half mushrooms and onions. Each topping on the large was $3 each, meaning we paid $6 for less than a handful of onions and mushrooms! They definitely get a big profit off of that. Forgettable, unimpressive.
2017-12-01,4,4 stars for Delivery.  I agree the in-person service and experience can be dicey.  They seem to nail it with delivery every time: my pizza is delivered hot, it's good, reasonably priced, and they are significantly faster than a lot of places in Hoboken.
2017-11-18,5,Great spot for artisanal pizzas. Went for a snack before a late dinner on a rainy Saturday. It was pretty empty at the time so no problem finding a table and the hostess and waiter were attentive and accommodating. I shared a medium San Gregorio specialty pizza. The dough was cooked to perfection: just firm enough to hold the delicious imported pepperoni --crispy cups of flavor -- sliced sausage, basil and mozzarella. The sauce was a little on the light side but was tangy enough to balance the sausage and 'roni. The crust was excellent as well -- crispy and crunchy without being difficult to eat. They also have a really extensive craft beer collection -- nothing too exotic or rare, but definitely a wide variety for the beer lover. 9/10 would go again
2017-10-14,1,Don't waste your time. Watered down sangria, chicken that seemed like mystery meat, and watery pasta. Horrible food. The waitress seemed angry and uninterested.
2017-08-10,4,So I come here most Wednesday's for their half priced meat balls, half priced sangrias and Brussels sprout pie.. I love their food and beer selection.. the server Kiana is always friendly and fast.. but when I don't have her service is O.K. I recommend Urban Coalhouse to a friend and he loved it. Can't wait for Wednesday !
2017-07-10,1,I came here with a friend and we were seated outside. Server came over right away & took our drink orders. Drinks took awhile to come. After a few sips, I noticed a fly flew right in my drink. (It wasn't there before) but still, Gross!!! I looked for the server who wasn't around and ended up having to ask the host to call her over. She apologized and said she would get me a new one. We received our food in the meantime. Ordered the grilled octopus, plain personal and the personal artichoke pie. Everything on that end was great. However my replacement drink didn't come till I was almost finished with my meal. Still, no biggie. I figured maybe the inside of the restaurant was super busy. So when I went to use the bathroom and saw the place was completely EMPTY, I was a little annoyed, but whatever. The bathroom was DISGUSTING. I still was going to give this place more stars because the food was good. So why the one star?! ...the server actually charged me for the drink with the fly in it! I was legitimately shocked. The manager was nice & refunded the charge, but will I return? Absolutely not!!! Urban coal house needs to reevaluate their basic service skills and cleanliness. It's really disappointing because it definitely had potential to be great.
2017-07-08,2,Awful service. It took the waitress about 15-20 minutes just to take our order. Our group ordered 3 personal size pizzas, & 1 buffalo chicken salad. 40 minutes went by, & nothing came out. At this point, we caught the waitress's attention to ask her when we could expect our order. She said, "I know, the kitchen is backed up," Another 20 minutes go by, we see them bringing out other orders. We get the feeling there may have been a mix up, but no one comes to address our table. Finally after an hour of waiting & no food, our order arrives & one of the pizzas is missing 2 key ingredients. At this point, we flagged over what appeared to be a manager, showed him the pizza & he offered to replace it if we could wait longer. He said there was a promotion going on (what promotion??) so the kitchen was busy... we didn't want to keep waiting, so just asked him to bring out the missing ingredients, which eventually came. All in all, the pizza was fine, but there are MUCH better pizza places in this town with nicer & FASTER service. Our waitress never came by to ask how the food was. Our water glasses sat empty. Disappointing experience. No incentive to return.
2017-07-08,5,Great deals on weekdays consistently good and cheap for what you get.. Mike the redhead guy was awesome he had seen us in the restaurant before and he bought us our first round of drinks, overall not the most variety but solid place
2017-06-11,3,Wings are very good as are the salads. Prices are a little high for the portion sizes. Service is very slow.
2017-06-05,4,If you're looking for pizza dinner - this isn't the best place in Hoboken. If you're looking for wings - this isn't the best place in Hoboken.If you're looking to hang out at the bar, have cheap drinks maybe watch a sporting event and an average to good meal - this is your place.During the week if you want a solid lunch special - this is a good option. I think of this as a bar not a restaurant. I've had mixed service in the restaurant portion of the bar, the bathroom line can be a problem.
2017-06-04,5,Best Arugula and Italian Tuna Salad I have ever had. Great Pizza as well. We have live in Hoboken for 30 years and eat out regularly.
2017-05-21,2,We should have listened to a few gentlemen that were leaving as we waited for our table. They complained about service, but we decided to give it a try. Oh my, they were so right. Super slow, and not attentive AT ALL. Will not be returning. Margarita Pizza was just okay.
2017-05-21,3,2nd time visiting and the food is amazing.  Unfortunately, the service is just not social or welcoming either visit.  Still recommend stopping in, but keep the service expectations low.  Cheers!
2017-05-15,1,We live a few blocks away. We come here often. Have been coming here since the opening. Sat for 15mins tonight with very few tables seated and couldn't get a server to ask us if we wanted a drink or anything for that matter. Got up and walked out. No one asked why we were leaving. Went down the street to Bin 14 and spent a lot more for dinner, but we received great service from start to finish.
2017-05-03,2,Another pizza place in hoboken that spits out OK pies. However, please be aware that there oven is a fake.  They go to great lengths to try to show that they have actual burning coals in that oven, but upon further review, it's nothing but a glowing pile of fake coals. It's a gas oven, and therefore, the pizza doesn't have that classic coal taste that you can get at Grimaldi's. Based on the name of this place and how hard they have worked to hide the fact that it's gas, I would say this is deception at its finest.
2017-04-24,5,Stopped by here yesterday with my friends for a drink. We all got the sangria, which is a must try (not too sweet like a lot of places and not weak). We will be back soon for Sangria Wednesdays, where they offer half off sangria and half off meatballs all night (which are also amazing).Looking forward to my next visit!
2017-04-22,1,Never in your life order the buffalo style personal pizza.Management here is a joke.  My pizza arrived with more ranch sauce than marinara sauce.  It was so bad that me and my brother only ate a few bites of the pie and just stared at it intently wondering why it was so disgusting.The manager comes by and I told him the pizza wasn't as expected.  He looks at the pizzas and said "yeah you're right, we don't usually make them like that."  The waitress then comes by shortly after and says "because the pizza was on sale already, we can't comp your meals."The circus continued when the manager said "hey next time you come in, i'll get you a pizza."I don't want anything free in this life, and in my 30+ years of life, this is the second time I've actually flagged a manager down to complain about food quality.Skip this place as they don't about their customers, and honestly, we had a few different items at our table, and none looked good.
2017-04-17,2,The two major ingredients you have to get right for a high end pizza joint is crust and sauce. They missed on both. I was surprised that the crust was tasteless, lacking that wood/coal burnt flavor.  The sauce was sweet and lacked any herb flavor and skimp on the pie. For the price and expectations, a big disappointment. We paid $27 for a large Tomato Pie (no cheese) with basil ( barely any basil), onion, artichoke and cherry tomatoes.
2017-04-14,4,A nice Italian place for lunch, dinner or drinks. We came here with my wife and 6-months old daughter for lunch while visiting Hoboken. There is a large selection of items and we both tried different pastas and we liked both of them. We also got the garlic bread that was awesome. Their pizza looked good too. Service was helpful and fast and it is certainly baby-friendly.
2017-04-13,3,Great place for lunch or a game night. Enjoyed the Brussels sprout pizza, arugula salad and fried calamari. Wine list is very reasonable and will return in the future.
2017-04-11,1,There's just no excuse for COLD pizza after 45 minutes from a place that is literally around the corner from us (on the same block, 1 minute walk away).  Called to complain and was told all they could (would) do was to resend the pizza, this after telling me that their third party delivery service takes 45 minutes.  No thanks, don't need to wait even longer for another cold pizza.  Will not be ordering from here again, or going to them in person either.
2017-04-10,1,So sad that a local pizza place that is one block away from me ... delivers COLD pizza. The pizza flavor is so-so. Takes 30-45 minutes to get here which is strange since it takes less than a minute to walk here.  Pizza was not taken from a hot bag... thus soggy and disappointing. This is the second time we've ordered to give them a chance. Not going to order again. Such a shame of poor service.
2017-03-31,1,Don't order takeout from here. They will accept your order and then when they get "too slammed" will completely ignore your order or any obligation of telling you they've decided not to deliver the food. Then proceed to blame it on a third party delivery service. Altogether unacceptable.
2017-03-22,3,The employees were welcoming upon entering. It was happy hour so we got half off drinks and the wings were part of a happy hour deal. I liked the wings but i was shocked we were not given blue cheese or ranch  or even asked if we wanted sauce. My friend got the Brussel sprout pizza which she enjoyed and i got the vodka pizza. I thought there could be a little more sauce and some more cheese. I felt like i didn't see cheese on more than half my pizza. The crust was a bit hard. The vodka pizza wasn't bad but it also wasn't to die for. I would give this place another shot. The waitress was attendant and made sure we didn't need anything.  Street parking is available and the meters do have to be paid till 9 pm. There is a garage you might be able to park at close by.
2017-03-19,5,Excellent pizza- we did the classic but added ricotta. I'm still dreaming about the light fluffy crust, delicious sauce, and creamy ricotta. Also a big fan of their house hopped cider. Will be back.
2017-03-14,2,Penne was decent. Pizza- I'd rather not eat anything at all. Totally disappointing and way overpriced for small portions. We actually ended up throwing the rest of the pizza away. Worth the skip.
2017-03-04,5,Personal pies are excellent - and they'll make it per your preference (not too well done, extra sauce, etc). Great service and and ambiance as well
2017-02-28,3,3 stars for the nice cold beer until they ran out of blue moon. The bartender has no personality to be one and each time we needed something we had to ask for it. Most say "would you like another beer"? We had the wings to start, and it took her 15 min to clean the dirty plates. Mind you we were like the only customers. It was so bad that when the bartenders were having a convo a customer got up right IN FRONT of them and they didn't even stop, they completely ignored him and he just left. If these were my staff they would be fired. I got the Brussels sprout pie and it came out half cooked. They were so hard I had to send it back. No apology from my bartender, 15 min later my pie comes out while my husband is now done with his. Again, the bartender was too busy in a convo to even care to ask if I am enjoying the second one. Also this by any means did not taste like coal fired pizza, they need to get it right if they want to stand by that name.
2017-02-22,3,Things I like about this place:- They have a liquor license. - They have a greater diversity of salads than comparable pizza places in Hoboken.- They do get credit for trying to be a bit bolder with their pizza selection.In terms of pure pizza making execution, however, they aren't as good as Johnny Pepperoni's, Dozzino's or their main competitors in town.
2017-02-16,3,Love the look of this place, as well as the food. Amazing gluten-free pizza!! Only complaint is that pick-up is never a simple task, in my experience. It's a wait to be acknowledged by staff, and then a wait for our food, despite showing up a few minutes later than we are told.
2017-02-11,3,Cool atmosphere! The food is inconsistent. The 1st time we went everything we had was delicious. The second time was good but not great. The cooks cut so much onion in the kitchen all our eyes were tearing. The 3rd time the chicken was rubbery and could have been cooked more. The cheesecake was half frozen. I ordered a single shot of espresso and was brought a double. When I told the waiter I wanted a single he said the machine only produced double. They should tell you that when you order. (Reason being I get a shot of Sambuca with it and 2 shots of espresso is too much.) I dumped the other shot but was still charged for 2 shots.
2017-02-10,4,Great neighborhood spot with a good vibe and solid food. Cocktails, pizza, and chicken parm were all very tasty.  Like that this place can be a bar and a pizza/Italian restaurant at the same time. Good casual spot to hang out at bar or eat dinner. Will return.
2017-01-24,3,My friends raved about this place.  I went here and didn't see what the hype was about.  Pizza I got was good and would def come back another time.
2017-01-21,1,The penne vodka had no taste at all and the cheesecake was FROZEN. The service was sub-par. I definitely will NOT be returning to this establishment
2017-01-20,1,Delivery took 2 hours @ 7:30pm on a Friday. One of the pizzas was burnt to a crisp and all the food was cold.Pretty crappy experience all around.
2017-01-17,2,Delivered quickly, sauce was ok, crust was well baked, the cheese is not fresh mozzarella.  Most importantly, pizza is extremely salty.  Doesn't anyone ever taste their own food they sell?
2017-01-12,3,I've had better coal oven pizza before so the pizza here is okay, not the worst but also nothing too amazing about it. If you're in town  looking to maybe catch a football game and drinks with friends this would be a nice place to come to.
2017-01-09,1,Food was bland, service mediocre. We had the wings, they were fine. The eggplant parm bland and no flavor. The chicken parm overcooked and bland. Wife said sauce overcooked. Red sauce lacking. The rolls were cold. The waiter didnt want to be here. Good thing i had a local flavor coupon. Would be mad if paid full price.  The only good thing was the atmosphere.
2017-01-05,5,Great wings and beer selection!! Pizza is also very flavorful and appealing! Try the specialty pies!! They never disappoint. Also, the sangria is the best I've ever had!!!! Check this spot out!!
2017-01-04,5,Garlic bread and Balsamic Calamari are outstanding. Pizza really good - ask for well done. Great draft beer options.
2017-01-03,3,A real mixed bag but worth a try if you're in the neighborhood.Having gone twice I can already see the trend of the servers being sort of all over the place.  Not expecting fine dining but they run around like crazy here and you have to flag them down for anything.The food is the real mixed bag.  The pizza is solid enough but not going to rank on anybody's top pizza lists.  The salads were sub-par, there was almost no dressing on the ceasar last time.  Kinda pricey for letucutte and cheese.Overall though it's not a place to avoid, just don't go out of your way to go there.
2016-12-16,4,This place is perfect for my husband and me.  A sports bar with actually good food. The pizza, chicken parm and eggplant parm is delicious.  There is a nice selection of craft beers and highchairs for babies.  Unfortunately, you have to park your stroller outside.
2016-12-14,5,Love coming here during the football games on Sunday. They have drink specials throughout the week. And the pizza is great. Thin crust!
2016-12-13,5,Perfect place to come for pizza/wine night with your girlfriends or wing/beer night with the boys Food is good and craft cocktails are amazing! You definitely have to look at the specials menu for the best deals!
2016-10-17,4,Live around the corner and have been here several times. As someone who has a gluten allergy, their gluten free pizza is the best I have ever had. Plus, anything else we have tried has always been delicious. I reviewed this place months ago and said the service was amazing but I've been back several times since and it has gone seriously downhill! Food is still delicious but the service and lazy and not so good
2016-10-17,2,I've passed by this place a few times and wanted to try it out. It looks like a decent place from the outside. My friends decided to swing by since they were around the way and I decided to meet them. I was super hungry and after reading some comments and perusing their menu I was apprehensive about coming here.                 Once arrived, I noticed my friend at the bar and made my way there. The bartender handed me the drink and food menu and told me the specials. $4 well drinks, $4 house wine, and $2.50 coors light. Not bad for a Sunday night. I ordered my drinks and while I was waiting, I saw servers bringing out pizzas to tables nearby. Honestly, they did not look so great. They were also tiny for the price they had on the menu. For that, I'd rather go to Manhattan. I opted for the broccoli rabe with sausage instead. It was under the sides. Now, they made the price a little ambiguous. I thought that it was only $6 but for some reason the broccoli rabe itself was $12 and with sausage it was a whopping $18. Let's just say I did not know that it cost this much otherwise I would've had a better meal or I would've waited somewhere better to go to. So I finally get the side dish and I will say that they were pretty generous with the dish. The dish contained 3 hefty sausage links however they were not cut. It was such a weird presentation. The sausage was super dry as well. The broccoli was cooked right but I still had to add crushed red peppers and Parmesan cheese for extra flavoring. Needless to say when I received the check I was a little annoyed. $25 for a "side dish" of veggies and a coors light is beyond what I expected to pay for for a meal like that. I don't ever mind spending money but the ambiance and dish has to coincide with the cost. It's a casual pizza joint in Hoboken. Come on! I'll come back for drinks but I certainly have to desire to eat anything else there. The bartenders were nice though so that's a positive thing.
2016-10-17,4,Went here yesterday for football Sunday. For Hoboken, the pizza is pretty good. I had pepperoni on it and thought it was great! The chicken tenders seemed to be fresh and not something that came out of a freezer. I would give it five stars but we only came here for the happy hour menu which is advertised as "all day sunday" on their website and our waitress didn't even know what we referring to. Loved it but with all the great sunday deals else where, I will be skipping it.
2016-10-14,4,I rely on photos from Yelpers to typically decide what I want to order. I will say that most of the photos I saw were not very appealing so when we ordered our food, I was pleasantly surprised how good it was! They currently have extended hours for specials but you have to sit at the bar only, so our pies were from the regular menu as we sat in the middle row of seats. Another ++, I usually hate sitting on 2-tops sandwiched in the middle row between tables, but shockingly, there was enough space that not one waiter or patron bumped into me or my bag hanging on the chair. High five!! This tends to happen a million times in small spaces and makes for an irritable dining experience. We had the regular margherita and spinach artichoke pie. I had their Passionate Punch martini and can seriously drink it like candy. Now this is not spinach artichoke pie on the same level as Artichoke Basille's in the city, but it was still tasty. I'm more of a thick crust kinda gal, so these pies are pretty flimsy in comparison. But tasty nonetheless! The old Puerto Spain used to be one of my top 10 faves in Hoboken, but knew it would be coming to an end soon. The place was just too dated and never seemed to have enough business to support a modern renovation, outside of their flamenco nights which were sparingly scheduled. Now, you seriously can't even recognize the place. I'm almost shocked how quickly this place opened with all the red tape in this city that seems to preclude businesses from opening without delay. The only negative is that there are a million TVs like every other place in the city. Do we really need another 'sports bar restaurant'? That would be a NO. Patrons remember, this place is a restaurant first, so if you're going to come in to watch football and start hooting, hollering and screaming profanities from your bar stool, remember you're not the only one there. You're annoying the rest of us who just want to watch the game and eat a decent meal. I'm fairly sure the parents in the restaurant were not pleased with the lone LSU fan so excited he must've had $$ on the game. But that's also a fault on management's part. Tell the dude to calm the heck down when it's prime dinner hour or he can go to one of the 100 other sports bars in the mile square city. Salute!
2016-10-13,5,This place has a great lunch special. I love the soups and salads. The pizza is tasty and filling. Two people can share the personal size pizza.
2016-10-12,2,Service and atmosphere are excellent at this Hoboken location. Major downside is the advertised happy hour menu and drink specials do not exist at this location. I went with my boyfriend to try a few apps and drinks at the happy hour prices we saw online and to our dismay those prices and deals were not accurate for this location. That being said the food was decent and the only disappointment was that there was no ranch dressing. Overall a nice experience but we will probably go to other Hoboken spots before coming back here.
2016-10-07,1,-too salty, NOT fresh mutz, flat overworked crustArtisans Pies:The Don Gregorio: too salty, too much pepperoni, cheese is NOT fresh mozzarellaSan Danielle: pie was cold when they added the prosciutto, cheese NOT fresh MutzCauliflower pie: cauliflower NOT roasted...tasted like steamed. not much cauliflower on it.All crusts are flat, over-worked, too chewy.....like bad stale bread.-this is really a shame given the location and the license opportunities.
2016-10-02,2,Nice decor. Small beer list. Pizzas are small, but above average. Similar to Anthony's Coal Fired pizza. Limited menu, very crowded seating - we were on top of the table behind us. Much better options in the area, won't be back.
2016-10-01,4,Artisanal pizza has come to Hoboken.  Plenty of pizza places both by Slice, BYOB or takeout.  This place  has full bar which not sure how as within 500 feet of other places that do also though might have taken over license held by Spanish restaurant.Beers selection is now standard 20 craft, local and other beers.  Have hanging signs with what is on tap.  Split signs between two sides of bar so beers on side you are not will be hard to see taps or signs.   Should switch signs so they are on opposite side from the tap so can see one or other.Pizzas come in personal, medium and large.  The medium more of small as person next to me finished theres off and I likely could have done same.   It was good as what i will call meat lovers had plenty of meat and was well cooked.Space is gorgeous though I have a sweet spot for exposed brick.  Plenty of tvs so likely great place to watch the games. Service could have been better as server disappeared though stated was fighting the keg.  Another person had broccoli rabe brought out when ordered Brussels sprouts. They have long happy hour as could call happy day as goes from 12-7 and all day Saturday and Sunday.    Includes personal pizzas for 1 dollars off or 2 dollars if order two.I will return as happy they opened.
2016-09-30,1,I'm a soda drinker, through and through. I love snacks, whether they be chocolate, sweets, or just anything generally corrosive. Therein lies the root issue for the well being of my teeth. To date, I've received three root canals. I can wholeheartedly say that I'd rather get a fourth, with no form of anesthetic, than to ever come here again.Lousy service, poor bait happy hour advertising, atrocious management. Can't comment on the pizza because I was so repulsed by the other factors. The fact that I left any sort of monetary tip should put me in the candidacy for a Nobel Peace Prize. Save your time, go somewhere else.
2016-09-30,1,Came here with my boyfriend and best friend on a football Sunday for the 4pm game. We walked up to the hostess stand with several parties behind us and the hostess was no where to be found for about five minutes (which is a long time if you're just waiting). Thinking this place might be like most restaurants for football Sunday, we walk in and think "since there is not hostess it might be seat yourself/standing." Two of us stand by an open table while the other continues to wait for the hostess. A manager walks by us and impatiently tells us that we need to be seated by the hostess to which we tell him that she is no where to be found. He finds her and she eventually seats the three of us at the table we were waiting at.We waited about ten minutes for a waitress to come (mind you it was NOT crowded in here) and when she finally did all she said was "do you want drinks?" without even glancing up from her notepad. Thinking it was happy hour (as advertised) we were disappointed to find out that happy hour was only at the bar which has maybe about ten seats with no place to stand if all the seats were taken (which they were). So we order our beers anyway and continue to wait. She comes back with ONE beer and tells us they ran out of Bud Light. So we place an order for two different beers, chug them, paid and got the HELL out of there.So disappointing because from the outside it looks like it can be a fun place.
2016-09-28,5,There are plenty of pizza joints in Hoboken but not like this one. It's inviting and not stuffy, wall to wall tvs, friendly bartenders and thin crust pizza. I can't stand soggy doughy greasy pizza (maybe when I'm hungover but those days are gone) so it's refreshing to be able to stop in during lunch hours, grab a personal pie, yummy salad and topped with 2 delicious but dangerously potent glasses of sangria, white and red, and walk out smiling!
2016-09-28,1,I hate doing this but my visit was a 1 star experience.First off the server took a while with our drinks and did not even give us enough menus. Then we ordered the signature wings which were dry wings with onions.The pizza was not terrible but there are a ton of better spots in hoboken. The server also messed up our order where we did not receive ours apps until our entrees came.I know the place is new but between the food and service this was a one star experience.
2016-09-27,2,I'm think this place will get a lot better over time. The food was very good and they were very busy but being open for only a short time I don't feel they have everything fully in sync just yet. I was there with some family and my 1 y/o daughter was starting to get cranky bc she was getting hungry so my wife took her outside as not to disturb others. I asked the waitress for bread for my daughter 3 times before our food came and the manager happens to go outside and saw my daughter crying and asked my wife if she needed anything and she said we're waiting for bread and instead of going back in to make sure we got the bread, he said ok and went back to his phone. By the time the bread was finally brought to us the pizza had arrived so was useless at that point. I would assume that the rating will get better over time.
2016-09-26,2,I know they're new and may have some kinks, but overall it's just another average place opening up in town. I wish they'd done some market research to realize there are 2335938 pizza/Italian joints in town and in all seriousness at least 5 within a few blocks of here. We need more pizza places like we need more realtors and nail salons.Came on a Sunday night, sat outside, the hostess was nice enough. The menu is sparse, mainly just pizza. The server was nice but missed a couple things like the water I asked for, timing of food, etc. We ordered spinach and artichoke dip, they were out. When he came back to tell us we ordered garlic bread instead (8 bucks for garlic bread too..meh). The pizza we ordered, The Don Gregorio, came before our app. We canceled the garlic bread. I don't think it was ever put in.The pizza was OK, just OK. If you're gonna open a pizza joint here I feel like you need to have a solid pizza game. It was average, the toppings were ok, but the "medium" was small by pizza standards and the wife and I finished it, for $17, it just didn't get there. I'm not saying it was bad, I am saying it was small and not worth that price tag at all. Maybe 12 bucks.The space is better than Porto Spain but I think they're going for more sports bar with wall to wall TV and decent beer specials. For a place to sit down and eat, I'd skip it all together, there are far better specialty pies to be had in town for a better price and value. Don't think we'll be back.
2016-09-25,5,What can I say. This place is great. We ordered the Brussels sprouts and they where cooked perfect. No heavy oil. We also ordered the gluten free pizza and it was amazing.
2016-09-23,3,Pizza is definitely not up to par with the rest of Hoboken, but super cute space especially for football. The brussel sprout pizza is a good choice!
2016-09-23,2,The pizza is not good - tried 3 varieties and all three were close cousins to pre baked crusts sold in stores. Toppings were extremely skimpy as well which doesn't help the overall flavor. Service was lacking as well.... Pass!
2016-09-18,2,The "Margherita" pizza was so so; definitely not on par with Ny/NJ pizza while charging $13+ for a small personal pie. Semi acceptable. My friend ordered a white pizza, and it was delish. So, anecdotally, it's a hit or miss on the menu. Also, don't rely on the online menu. They said there would be lunch specials daily, but when we came in for football on Sunday, we were told the website was wrong. Bait and switch much?The crowd was awesome and the multiple screens for football watching was great. But that's about it. Sit by the bar and drink beer, and when you're drunk enough, order food so it tastes better. But that's about it.
2016-09-14,4,Hoboken is filled with really bad, frat boy pizza -- virtually on every corner. Doughy, soggy and horrible. So when I heard there was yet another pizza restaurant opening, I wasn't thrilled.But today I went in and had lunch. Started with the tomato soup which was solidly good. I ordered the meat lovers pizza - The Don Gregorio - and it was very good. The only thing I might fault is that the crust might be a little more tender but otherwise, I was very happy. The server Kiana was friendly and did a great job. Urban Coalhouse is a solid addition to Hoboken.
2016-09-14,1,Don't think this place will last long. I also don't think they do a background check on their waiters. My waiter obviously hasn't had a really good history with waiting and he smelt like weed. Basic food and mixed drinks were terrible. If you go order, a beer or wine so you can't go wrong. Small thin pizza for $15? I'd say it's overpriced. Overall, I won't be coming here again. There are a lot of other places to go to.
2016-09-14,3,Urban Coalhouse is a nice addition to uptown (assuming it stays open), and seems like it may remain a decent low key spot for a few drinks or food.  The inside is a little tight, and will only shrink once the warm weather fades, and they have to start closing the windows.  The first time there, my girlfriend and I sat at a two person high top table, and kept getting bumped into but the crowd standing at the bar.  This is extremely annoying when you're trying to eat.  The pizza is good - not great.  The shrimp could use some work.  Wasn't really sure what type of spice they were going for, but had a strange makeshift italian flavor to it.  I know it's still too early to tell how this place will pan out, but so far they seem like a solid backup plan.
2016-09-11,2,Decent beer selection.  Decor is nice.  Food is average at best.  The pizza was sub-par given the other choices in hoboken. Not clamoring to get back any time soon.
2016-09-11,2,Great establishment in theory.  While sitting at the bar, fully pinned behind the conveniently placed large brick pillar my girlfriend and I tried to figure out one thing... Just how is it so messy behind the bar and around the soda machine on a late empty Tuesday night during their first week of business.   Then it hit us, during the 10 or so minutes or so it took to start with a glass of water; sheer inexperience.   One cool bourbon beer and a dozen or so 'craft beers'  I can get at my local Bodega. Medium prosciutto pizza that contained a mound of arugula and literally less than a slice of prosciutto per slice.  Maybe slice it thinner and deceive my mind a bit??  Little evoo on top possibly?  All in all a cheap tab, luckily.   After the server launching the silverware as loudly as possible for 10 minutes for that finishing off sidework duty.... It was time to go.... Good luck guys. I know this isn't fine dining but damm.
2016-09-11,4,Great place for eat and drink while watching your favorite team but again they try to usher you out of the place if it gets crowded.
2016-09-11,4,Overall very good first time experience. The restaurant happened to be very busy the day I went so service was very slow. They have a great selection of beers and wines. The salad we had was good. The pizza was pretty good as well. The only issue we had was the Music was way to loud. Really wasn't in the mood for head banging Loud rock and roll music. I'd go back not sure my wife will.
2016-09-10,2,Meh. Nice looking place. First off, we ordered a beer (fine) and the strawberry basil smash cocktail- the cocktail came out in the smallest glass I've ever been served a cocktail in, ever. While putting it down the waitress said 'the size of this drink is pretty inconvenient' haha whatever that even means. Seven sips later, I ordered a beer which came in a glass with a huge splintered crack down the side. We ordered:  wings, Caesar salad, meat pizza and prosciutto arugula pizza. The wings came out super quickly. They're interesting. You get maybe 10 wings smothered in sautéed onions? It makes you feel like there should be pierogis on the plate instead of wings. With that being said, they're really tender. The menu says the wings come with focaccia bread, but it's actually pizza dough rolls. Not sure they know what focaccia is... The Caesar was fine, a lot of shaved Parmesan on top. The croutons were definitely not homemade which was slightly disappointing. The pizzas were interesting too. They're a pretty big size for personal sized pizzas. But they're thin and hard as a board. We were cracking the slices like crackers.... I think there's just too many local pizza options that outdo this place. All in all, I'd return for some beers and sit at the bar. The food is forgettable to say the least. The waitress was attentive in asking if we were okay, but inattentive when it came to cracked glasses, being unhappy with the size of the $10 cocktail and the fact that we didn't eat half our pizza :(
2016-09-07,4,Great food, bar and scene...and most importantly, great service which seems to be a rarity for Hoboken these days. Happy to see a new restaurant uptown that has their act together. Welcome to the neighborhood
2016-09-05,3,Judging by the pretty basic menu, they're really not trying to reinvent the wheel here. I think they're just banking on creating a fun environment with good drinks and decent food. The bartenders were friendly and they had a good number of TVs with baseball and college football on. Combine that with all day happy hour on Sunday and I think this place will really kill it during football season, but I don't know if I'd come back just for the food come wintertime. In the meantime, I'm looking forward to holing up here every weekend for beer, pizza and football until January.
2016-09-03,3,The meatball was delicious. Even the house salad was tasty. The pizza was so-so... Would be awesome if the crust wasn't a cracker. Very, very thin, and crispy / cracker-like crust. I prefer a crust that's a bit softer. Toppings were great, especially the ricotta on the white pie. Wait service is severely lacking... Wasn't terribly busy when we arrived at 5pm, yet took 15 mins to get anyone to even realize we were here. Food came out quickly, but then we sat for close to 30 mins after dinner, waiting for a check. Hopefully they're working out the opening week kinks. All of the staff were extremely friendly. Went to the bar for a glass of wine after dinner... Bartender was was super friendly.
2016-08-30,3,They have some timing to work on still with getting your order to the table and general attentiveness. The pizzas were good. The wings are half priced on Tuesday but still wouldn't say they were worth it. Decent draft list
2016-08-30,5,Urban Coalhouse took over the old Puerto Spain in Hoboken, and all I have to say is what took so long!?  In this part of town with so many other restaurants/bars to go to, Urban Coalhouse stands out in just 2 weeks of being open.  I've already been there twice since opening and am impressed on how great the food, service and overall atmosphere in the opening weeks has been.  I've already tried the pizza, Octopus salad and wings which were all a hit.  The wings especially were fall off the bone tender and had great flavor.  The service was extremely friendly, both wait staff and bartenders.  I even had a chance to meet the owners as they took the time during the busy opening days to check on our table and introduce themselves.  The bar has an awesome vibe with a bunch of great beers on tap and is spacious enough to eat at without feeling crushed by other patrons.  I'm pretty sure they mentioned happy hour all day Saturday and Sunday so you can't beat that.  Definitely happy about the new edition in town!
2016-08-29,5,I've been waiting for Urban Coalhouse to open its doors and this week they finally did with a soft opening. On the corner of 14th and Bloomfield, they occupy the spot Puerto Spain was once located. I've heard good things about Tommy's Coal Fired Pizza (Paramus/Brick/Red Bank) and I'm a fan of Tommy's Tap & Tavern in Sea Bright. When I heard they were coming to Hoboken I was pumped. The place was gutted and completely redesigned. The spot now sports a modern look, lots of exposed brick and a big open air design thanks to sliding glass panels in the front of the restaurant. There's a big bar and plenty of flat-panels to catch the games. Hi-tops and regular dining tables fill the rest of the space and an outdoor seating area extends down the Bloomfield side. They definitely nailed the cool vibe part of things. There's a strong selection of brews-- from staples and classic imports to seasonal and craft beers. I didn't notice the vino choices but if they put as much thought into the wine list as they did everything else, wine drinkers will not be disappointed. The bar is the reason you're going to stay here longer than you planned, but the reason you're going in the first place is the food. Calling this place a pizzeria is a disservice. It's an upscale casual establishment with an solid, simple menu. Their pizza is excellent, their meatballs would make nonna blush, and their wings are out of this world.The wings. Oh the wings! They ain't from Buffalo and they ain't deep fried. They're  seasoned, oven roasted and served on a hot platter with onions and a long hot. Magnifico!The prices are fair. Maybe even too reasonable for Hoboken. I'm not sure a bottle of Bud Light is still gonna be $4 a few months down the road but they have a decent Happy Hour with $2.50/$4.50 drafts and discounted apps. My only knock on the place is they're still working the kinks out. They ran out of pepperoni which I'm pretty sure is a felony in the Old Country. They also didn't have a couple of other menu items and a few of beers. The staff struggled with the POS system. The food runners sometimes seemed unsure where they were running. Despite all of this, everyone was friendly and attentive. None of those hiccups made our visit any less enjoyable. That's why there are soft openings. I will return. And whoever you are Tommy, keep up the good work. Not a lot of people in this business get it. You, my unmet friend, surely do.
2016-08-29,2,Avoid this place til they get the kinks out.  Long delays for seats, explained that we could only sit in sections of the restaurant where servers were not backed up!???   Tons of other open seats were available. Long wait for water and drinks - upside bud lights are only $4Food was served by the owner / manager cold.  Clearly there was no attention to detail.  While we ate the warm pizza we hD to send the chicken parm back.  Unfortunate the owner / manager couldn't tell that melted mozzarella was no longer hot.  While a free round was provided and the chicken parm was comped, folks would be better served going to a place in town with a lot less problems.  Btw, the warm pizza was tasty, the chicken parm tasted like it was coming from a franchised restaurant or frozen food box. Stay away.
2016-08-29,4,Delicious and a great addition to the neighborhood! Now if I could only get them to start delivering.
2016-08-28,3,Went one week after opening just to check out the place - figured given the soft opening, I wouldn't order any food and just try the highly touted "20 beers on tap".  I was in the mood for an IPA and the first 3 I requested were "tapped out" - so I had to settle.  C'mon guys - you are in the largest market in the country and run out of all your IPA's when that is the most popular beer in the country now - woof.  Whoever is in charge of procurement needs to be re-trained or replaced...realize food/kitchen can be challenging at first, but expected more on the drink front...not a good start.
2016-08-28,4,Went for dinner during their soft opening. The service was pretty decent considering they just opened- the staff was all very friendly and trying really hard to keep up with the crowds- but did require a bit of patience. Food was pretty good - pizza was light and flavorful
