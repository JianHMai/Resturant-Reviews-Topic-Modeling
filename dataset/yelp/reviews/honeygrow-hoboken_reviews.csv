2021-11-15,3,Okay food for this area. Most veg food isn't very good or is too salty around here, so the options are limited. This wasn't bad, but was oily and I don't think I'll order it again. We had the Red Coconut Curry and a create your own rice noodle stir fry.
2021-11-08,5,Been waiting to order here since I moved to Hoboken. I ordered take out and got a salad and it was so fresh and delicious. I did a great your own and they got everything right. The dressing was so good and the focaccia bread and croutons were amazing! Can't wait to order from here again!
2021-09-30,2,Got egg white noodle stir fry with chicken and other toppings, plus spicy garlic sauce. Egg white noodles were not cooked fully in my opinion, and there were only 3 small cubes of chicken included. More parsley than noodles, to boot. Not to mention their chip readers were all malfunctioning.
2021-09-25,2,I ordered The Vegan Sesame Garlic Stir-fry and Brownie Crumble. I substituted the beef for chicken (chicken was salty as hell, have a bottle of water nearby). It had a burnt smell and sure enough when I was eating I tasted something funny..it was the  black burnt bits and I picked out some more pieces.I was looking forward to the brownie crumble but it was a big disappointment. It  had three pieces  of brownie  and  a ridiculous amount of chocolate chips. Maybe they should change the name to chocolate chip crumble. Grapes and strawberry added nothing to the overall taste. I won't be ordering again..
2021-09-23,1,I used to order here from time to time over the last couple of years and have been fairly happy with the food. Today, I ordered a Caesar salad. Greens were partially frozen and not fresh. Chicken was very very salty salty, as if they put that much salt on it to preserve it. Halfway through the salad, I couldn't eat it anymore. I don't remember the last time I didn't finish a salad. Needless to say, I will never go back here and will let all of my friends know. This place will close down within two years if not less, is my prediction.
2021-09-12,5,Both dishes were good! Sesame was classic staple and miso was good to venture off and try something new.
2021-09-09,4,Extremely tasty.  I had the Sweet Soy Five Spice stir-fry and The Cobbler from the honeybar. Both had really delicious flavors. I do think it's a little overpriced for the portion sizes you get especially if you order for delivery, so I can't say I'd be a regular (almost $30 for the 2 food items and a soda, delivery service fees not included) .. but that's really the only slight downside IMO. I will definitely order again sometime...
2021-08-24,1,I placed an order online which was supposed to be ready at 7:22 pm. I got there at 7:40 so plenty of time to be ready. When I walked up they said no we don't have it go talk to another employee. The other employe said ya I made yours so sent back to the first employee. They had gave away my food to the wrong person. I wanted patiently thinking they would just remake my order. 20 min later and they asked each other should we remake hers? Then asked for my order again, this whole time that's what I thought they were doing. At that point I requested a refund as ididnt want to wait any longer and they said no problem but gave me no proof of a refund.... Really bad customer service. I understand they were busy but they could have communicated what was going on.
2021-08-19,2,I loved honeygrow company , however this location really lacks. I ordered through doordash and asked for sauce mixed in and sauce on the side ( yes i paid for the sauce on the side 66 cent i believe) all to get ONE sauce on the side and nothing mixed in. So i gave honeygrow 66 cent for nothing. Also my vegetables are uncooked! everything is tasteless and mediocre. I dont understand how this comes to $40 for two bowls and our food is weltered and taste like something from Mcdonalds. Extremely annoying
2021-08-03,2,Literally just ordered take out from here and the box is literally half empty... why am I paying $13 for half an order. And this is literally the 3rd or 4th time this has happened. That's why I'm writing this review. It's incredibly ridiculous I don't know how someone can fill half the box and think that's ok? Again this has happened multiple times that's why I didn't know what else to do but write a review at this point..
2021-07-26,2,Usually I always have a good meal at this honeygrow but tonight not so much. The chicken tasted like leftovers, they used the wrong sauce and didn't put some veggies in my stir fry. Oh also my Mexican coke I paid extra for they "ran out of" and gave me an expired regular coke for the same price. Don't know if it was a bad night for them but I'm very disappointed.
2021-07-25,1,Very rude as others have said. The food looks great but we were told you need to punch in every ingredient if you wanted the salads pictured on their displays. And the way she spoke us... I hate leaving bad reviews but this place needs it.
2021-07-14,2,I've been to Honeygrow in other places and this has got to be the worst location. Since the panoramic (lol) I order most of my food either on an app on call ahead. Honeygrow makes it easy to order your food ahead on the app. I ordered food for my partner and I before a road trip. We are both vegan and I am gluten-free. I ordered him the wheat noodles. I ordered myself the rice noodles (because again, I'm GF). My error was opening the food on the road and not immediately. The wheat noodles lacked any kind of sauce and the vegetables were sparse. Tasteless. My rice noodles were wheat. I couldn't eat it. After paying over $30 for food, I couldn't eat, I was annoyed.
2021-07-07,5,I eat here all the time, maybe 1x or 2x a week, i am vegan and they have plenty of options for me but i tend to stick with the red coconut curry. theyre food is always fresh and tastes fresh. the red coconut curry is always the perfect sweet and spicy meal, i never get tired of it lol. also whenever i order for pickup, its always ready on time which i appreciate. i have to say since i have ordered here many times, sometimes i'll get a dud order. as in, they skimped me out on my food or they messed up. i will contact their customer service and they respond quickly and give me a credit which i appreciate. this doesn't happen often though, but i just wanted to point out there good customer service. also it is a bit pricy but its worth it.
2021-06-24,4,Great healthier option for takeout! Created my own salad and added their seasonal watermelon and mint toppings! Also, the rosé vinaigrette is fantastic! Wish there were more menu items already created. There were only a few for each category and then a build your own.
2021-06-14,3,Delicious but overpriced.So because of that, I will not reorder.We ordered delivery for the CYO salad and the Keto Stir Fry.The keto stir fry was $19.70 and the CYO salad was $20.15! Crazy. Portion sizes were average. Everything was good and fresh and cooked perfect but nothing really stood out. I can't say it was worth the money.
2021-06-09,1,Did a DoorDash order, it was 2/3 empty and there were barely any veggies. The amount of food that was in there was enough for a 4 year old. I ordered from here to eat healthy not to pay 18 dollars to starve myself.
2021-05-29,1,This spot was very rude when I walked in after the mask mandate was lifted. They made a company policy to wear a make even if vaccinated and I will not be dining here until they lift it. I know many others won't either and they will be losing business.
2021-05-19,4,Ordered again. This time I added shrimp as my protein and the quantity was good. So changed my rating to 4.
2021-05-18,2,I acknowledge that COVID may be impacting things here - but - I have been super disappointed by honeygrow's salads the last few times.  I feel like the quality and quantity of ingredients and gone down significantly. They options feel more limited and what I do order there is not much of in the salad - it ends up being mostly lettuce.  Hopefully with time they can get their groove back!
2021-05-15,4,Been going for their delicious noodle bowls. Good vegan option with nice tofu and flavor / sauce. Just wish the portion was a bit bigger (I eat a lot) and that you could get more vegetables and toppings without racking up a bill
2021-04-11,5,Got the shrimp bowl and wow! Highly recommend it! Love this location. Glad honeygrow is here ! Repeated customer! All the bowls are great and always clean! Highly recommend it for speedy service and delicious bowl
2021-04-07,4,Treated myself to a honeybar snack this afternoon and it was delicious!I ordered ahead and at lunchtime the wait was only 15 minutes which is very reasonable. Ordering via the app, I started with the Fruit & Granola option and swapped out a few things based on my preferences (hello chocolate chips - goodbye coconut!). I like that you can see the prices for the add-ins while you're creating your order. They offer curbside delivery; when I texted upon arrival, someone wearing a mask brought out my food almost instantly! 4 stars because it's pretty expensive for the size of what you get ($7.50) but as I said before - it WAS delicious.
2021-04-06,3,Ordered the spicy garlic noodles with chicken. The flavor of the noodles is really good, with the heat of the sauce coming through and a good texture. Good balance of vegetables and meat. However, the chicken is not the freshest and the broccoli is slightly undercooked.
2021-03-28,1,Company gave a credit for this awful food. Just cashed it in - and I can confirm that this order was equally terrible. Maybe it's better if you order in person but don't bother with delivery. Hardly edible.
2021-02-11,4,The good: The ingredients are fresh and delicious. I made my own stir fry with kale, mushrooms, scallions, jalapeño, chicken, and sesame seeds, with the sesame garlic dressing. The dressing is super flavorful! I like that they label all of their ingredients that are vegan and gluten free, it's very helpful. In addition, we ordered via Uber eats during lunch time and it was delivered in under an hour (with our correct order).The not so good: Like other reviews mention, it's a little pricey especially in terms of their portion sizes. My fiancé's stir fry with double protein came out to be $22 which even with an extra protein side seems steep. I definitely love this place for a healthier lunch option but wouldn't order from here often due to the prices.
2021-02-08,4,I've been introduced to honeygrow by patronizing the Philly locations.  And when I was in the north jersey area, I was extremely excited to find out the chain was also there!  While in the area I've gone to this honey grow tons of times and I've gone even more since the pandemic started.  This Hoboken location is right smack in the middle of the hot spot location in Hoboken and finding parking is nearly impossible.  But since the pandemic, ordering to go makes life really easy.  I've ordered on the app, received a text with the estimated completion time, arrived 15 min later and texted CURBSIDE, and they bring the food to my car fully masked. While I've tried all the sauces and fixings, my go to is the coconut curry with shrimp and rice noodles.The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  Prior to the pandemic I lost my wallet and this was one of the places I stopped and they were helpful in trying to help me recover it by reviewing their cameras and following up.
2021-01-17,2,We thought it was risky since it's a fast casual chain, but wanted to try it. My friend and I are both disappointed. We both got a stir fry with the whole wheat noodles. They were definitely the best part. I got the red coconut curry sauce which was good. He got the spicy garlic which he called "uninspired". Our vegetables were raw and almost nonexistent. Also paid extra for 3 pieces of pineapple. The crispy shallots were stale. And the entire dish had a hint of gasoline...I guess from the stir fry stove...but - gross!
2021-01-12,3,I was extremely hungry when I ordered but I got the sesame garlic noodles with beef it was pretty good overall I can't complain probably would have definitely been better with it a side of rice. The apple pie was terrible to sweet and way off from your traditional apple pie.
2021-01-06,4,I absolutely LOVE the salads here. I love the seamless ordering process through the screen kiosks. I love that you can pick and choose your ingredients and I love the assortment of ingredients they offer. But how many times can I say love? ha! The food is healthy without tasting boring and bland. Today I give it 3 because I ordered the sesame garlic stir fry and my friend ordered the spicy garlic stir fry but I was not fully impressed by either. Mine was a glorified lo mein and a bit on the salty side but my friend's spicy garlic stir fry tasted like curry so I felt like the name was misleading. I would probably not reorder either of those. However, when it comes to the salads, I would give this place a solid 5. Love their salads so much! I would drive out of the way to Hoboken to fill a salad craving here. Moral of the story, stick to the salads. Also, love that they have outlets at every table here. if you spent a long day walking around Hoboken and you need to charge your phone while eating, its a good pit stop. It's a clean modern interior, a little nicer than a Panera but it's nothing too fancy.
2020-12-11,1,I ordered via DoorDash app.  Very disappointed.  This place is too expensive for the lack of ingredients they don't include (which you would typically get) in a salad!I ordered a CYO salad and you're only allowed one vegetable add on - okay, so I added cucumbers.  It was literally mixed greens, cucumbers and tofu.  That's it - no carrots, no tomatoes, etc. So 12.00 for 3 ingredient salad.  I could have made my own for less than $5 with a lot more ingredients!I also ordered a CYO stir fry - they forgot to include all the ingredients I asked for - mushrooms, spinach, etc.  wth?!  Were they in a friggin' rush?  Unreal.  $14 for noodles with barely nothing in it!Not sure why this place has such high reviews.  Their food is okay and way overpriced.
2020-11-17,2,I eat here a lot.  It's the only true tossed salad place in town, and the salads are pretty good, but ingredient quality does fall a bit behind Sweetgreen. Prices went up a bit to cover costs during COVID, which was fine.  Now I think they are now skimping on quantity as the last few salads I got were barely more than half filled bowls for $13-$15 salads, which is not cool and makes me feel like they are ripping me off.  Their CURBSIDE deliver service never works, so I would advise not waiting in the cold to avoid going indoors.I want the place to be better, and they're ok.  If sweetgreen, just salad, Chopt, or another competitor comes to town, I will ditch Honeygrow in a heartbeat.
2020-09-26,1,Noodles are stiff and undercooked. Terrible.Moldy onions - I hope I don't get sick. They forgot the spinach mix in. This place used to be very good. What happened???
2020-09-23,3,Honeygrow has quality ingredients and flavors but the salad I got recently was a let down. You can no longer argue the price points of salads, it is what it is. What I will say is that my bowl was filled 3/4 of the way including the toppings just sitting on top. I paid extra for broccoli and got about 3 stems. Salads at places like quality greens and alfalfa are packed. I struggle to get through them. That doesn't happen here. Please add more toppings, fill the bowl. If I'm paying I want a fair amount of protein and toppings that make that price justifiable.
2020-09-22,5,Love honey grow- this one is always fast and warm when it comes out. A great go to spot for stir fry or noodles, even salads '
2020-09-02,2,This place lacks any human interaction.  They botched my salad that I spent 5 minutes on a tablet ordering.  $18 salad and barely filled their little to-go bowl.  Would be nice to say "a little more of this and a little less of that." But when you order through a tablet you get "machine" portions and no input of your food.  No option to request more greens (wth)?  So the girl skimped on the greens and then proceeded to put a whole cup of shredded carrots in.  That would be a carrot salad and not what I want.  Then a ton of mushrooms instead of a nice garnishing.  Who teaches these people ideal portions?  Overrated.   Glad I didn't have to leave a tip cause this service is non-existent.  Order their pre-determined salads, or go to a place where you might actually have some input.  Also if you could order bigger bowls of greenrather than the "waif" sized salad bowl would be nice.  Very disappointed.Update:  9/20I keep wanting to like this place but have been disappointed every. Single. Time.  Went a couple times this summer and again today.#1.  Chronically Tiny salad.  What gives?  For $15??#2. No way to request more greens.  Greens are cheap but I'll pay an extra $1-2 for more.#3. Waited 10 minutes for a salad! And no one in line before me.  3 people standing around not making my salad.  Then made the wrong salad.  Software glitch apparently.  Oy!
2020-08-27,2,Im not certain why this restaurant can't EVER include everything ordered in my deliveries.  Cross the T's and dot the I's...it's that simple.  On at least 3 occasions I've ordered from this Honeygrow and only part of the order arrives (via Doordash or Seamless).  VERY FRUSTRATING.  Honeygrow Manager/Operator, if you're reading this... TRAIN PEOPLE ON HOW TO PACK ORDERS!
2020-08-23,4,I would like to update my review as I tried this place again after craving for some good NEW YORK CITY noodles which was closed. I am glad that I tried it again. This time I really liked honey grow and the quality of the products they use. Definitely going to try it next time now that I know what combinations I prefer! I ordered the red coconut curry through their app which btw is super friendly and easy to use. Also I would prefer ordering from there instead of going to the store and standing in the line if at all. I just have one complaint that the sauce used was too less and I kinda felt like I needed more curry sauce with my noodles as it was mostly dry after couple of bites. I will make sure to mention that to the person there next time.
2020-08-03,5,Update, got my refund. Handled it very professionally, also got a $10 reward which was really nice. Definitely will be visiting again just double checking my order before leaving.
2020-07-22,1,I ordered here twice. The first time, my food arrived slightly late and I received the wrong items. The food was very good though, so I decided to order again.Tonight, I ordered delivery at 7:43 pm. The latest arrival time was set to be 8:10 pm which was very reasonable. Then it got delayed to 8:30.. 8:50.. 10:10... then just completely cancelled. I am so hungry. No explanation from the restaurant. This is absolutely ridiculous and I will NEVER order from here again. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONLY FOR THE HORRIBLE SERVICE.
2020-07-07,5,Delicious salad! I was craving sweetgreen for lunch, trying to be healthy and all, but unfortunately the chain doesn't have a store near me. I was a bit hesitant to order at first because I was worried it would be a salad with tons of lettuce and no toppings, but it was packed with meat, veggies, and flavor. Quite filling.
2020-07-03,3,Here's the thing, Honeygrow is good, but the portion is tiny. I got a salad with chicken and it came out to almost $17, but it was VERY small.The ingredients are good and quality, just not worth the price tag. Also, it's definitely more of a lunch spot versus dinner.
2020-07-01,3,Forgot my sauce on the side so I have super dry noodles thanks guys I have to see what's in the fridge to add it just not the same
2020-06-21,1,Using the self-ordering kiosks was a huge mess. The first time I ordered and paid, the order never went through I was waiting 30 minutes until they realized there was a problem. The second time I ordered, I chose tofu as my protein and they mixed tofu and chicken together. I am vegan, so the food was inedible. Never going here ever again.
2020-06-05,5,I honestly think Honeygrow makes the best salads in Hoboken. Huge portion. A TON of ingredient options. Everything is fresh. Pretty affordable. I've always gone in and placed my order on the big touch screens and it's ready in like 15 minutes tops. My last order was during COVID so I placed my order via Yelp and opted for Curbside Pickup. I received a message saying that I'd get a text when my order was ready. Great in theory but after waiting outside for quite some time, I never got a message and ended up going in the store to check. My order was waiting on the table. Not the end of the world and I'll still 100% come back next time I want a delicious salad but still a little annoying. I usually go for the "Create Your Own" but they have some really great precrafted options, my favorite being the Make it Grain. (I'm just a sucker for roasted beets). Maybe ask for extra dressing because once or twice I did wish I had more. Anyway, thanks Honeygrow for letting me eat healthy and not letting me be bummed about it!
2020-05-31,2,I've ordered from Honeygrow several times and not once has the order been correct. Today was the last straw. Decided to give one more shot, and not only were the items I ordered incorrect again, but my husbands food wasn't even in the bag. There was no offer to remake the food either. The only reason I've given two stars instead of one is because the person I spoke with when I called immediately offered a refund for the whole order. I appreciate her effort to resolve things quickly.Super disappointed in this place though. Will not be ordering from here again.
2020-05-18,1,Honestly, love their stir-fry and had returned a second time for it this week. That's when things took a turn for the worst.Placed an online order for pickup at 12pm. When I arrived, there was a long line of people waiting for orders which didn't deter me and I had waited for my turn. However when I arrived at the front of the line, it was made aware to me that the employees had accidentally given away my order to another customer. I told them I'd return in 30 minutes and give them time to remake the orders. An honest mistake, which I understood.I returned back to the facility 30 mins later, and was greeted by a different employee who had no idea what had transpired half an hour ago and didn't have my order for me again. They told me to give them another 15 mins to make the order and I watched them rush to put together my order that was placed an hour ago.I understand that businesses are working hard during this pandemic but I am a healthcare worker and had to return twice to the location for lunch during my break and while I'm on the clock. It's completely unprofessional how service is at this place was. While the food was good and I enjoyed it, I don't believe I'll be returning to this establishment because of how terrible this experience was.
2020-05-15,4,This place has some really delicious, fresh food. Any stir fry is really good and filling. I like the aesthetic and set up as well: you order on a screen that is really easy to use with pictures and information on all the ingredients. I've always been very satisfied with the quality of ingredients that they use. I've never received a soggy piece of lettuce or anything less than super fresh. The honeybar is kind of nice too but a little too simple for the price. It's about six dollars for a small cup of just three kinds of fruit with honey and maybe a couple other toppings. The only reason I give four stars instead of five are some of the prices. The stir fry price is pretty fair for the portion, quality, and location but I wasn't thrilled with the salad I got. Good fresh food but it was skimpy on the toppings. Three vegetables are included but you don't get much of each. I also paid over two extra dollars for a small amount of "spicy" tofu added which I thought was bland. I was still hungry after and I know many places in the area that you can get a more filling salad for the same price. I will definitely keep recommending them and returning for their stir fry though!
2020-05-01,2,Recently ordered from them this past Sunday and received my order that was undercooked, missing ingredients, and they forgot my drink. I spoke to Sharon and she said that they would refund it (which they didn't). I gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered from them again on Tuesday. This time they never delivered my order and offered to refund it. Again I spoke with Sharon and AGAIN they have yet to refund my order.
2020-03-25,3,Not bad at all and we appreciate them being open during such a crazy time. Good price and nice amount of food (we all wished we had some soy sauce though.) I got the apple ginger juice and it was amazing!
2020-03-14,1,Ordered two bowls of create-your-own noodles today. Delivery was fast. Food was disappointing.For the bowls, we choose to add broccoli, edamame and mushroom. And there's literally NO broccoli and NO edamame. It was just noodle, salty sauce and mushroom. Disappointed.There were vegetables in the second bowl which my boyfriend had. We ordered the SAME thing but how can they be so different?? The vegetables were still raw and overall it was just overpowered by the sauce. Spicy and salty.It was our first time ordering from here and will he the last.
2020-02-25,5,They were super understanding and caring about the situation and fully refunded my order!
2020-02-24,1,Did anyone else get poisoned on Sunday night Feb 23rd, 2020? I ordered a salad on seamless and it was two hours late. Got grilled chicken salad with romaine lettuce and some veggies with the avocado dressing. I was in the bathroom the entire night. I have not been poisoned like this ever in my life
2020-01-29,3,Food is fine but service is slow. They have so many people working and they take forever to throw together a damn salad. A SALAD. They also keep shouting at each other about when they're going to take their breaks. Like, I get that they're legally obligated to take break but maybe don't do that when there's a crowd of customers waiting and you're moving slow as anything.
2020-01-25,5,Such a great place to eat, really nice you only have to use the computer everything is very simple and the food is really good
2020-01-19,1,This place has gone down a one-way street, straight South. Downhill on a steep decline. The salad sizes are literally half what they used to be, skimpy, not filling . . just truly inadequate. Are they trying to trick customers by so obviously cutting back on portion sizes, instead of raising prices ?? Isn't that the same thing, just an alternate  way of doing it ??GO TO ALFALFA, UPTOWN. Go there 1 single time if you haven't already been; order a salad off the menu or make your own - just 1 time and compare for yourself. The difference is night & day. Guaranteed you won't waste your time {more importantly your money} at HoneyScam any longer. HoneyTrick. HoneyPoop. Call it what you want; I call it a disappointing result of poor management for a place that started out so well, with such potential.  ALFALFA - try it once, then a simple "Thank You" afterwards will suffice !
2020-01-09,4,Stopped in here one night looking for a healthy but tasty meal and was not disappointed. They have tons of options and list the calories of all the dishes. Their seasoning is very flavorful and their ingredients are all fresh and delicious. I've been back 3 more times and very happy with everything I have tried. Looking for low cal and low carb meals, I have tried their zoodles, spinach noodles and salads. The chicken is moist and flavorful. I am a big fan!
2019-12-25,2,Located on Washington Ave in Hoboken, it's very hard to find a parking to pick up food here.Ordered a salad with chicken to take out which was just ok, not great.  Also pricy at over 10 dollars for a not so great salad.  Don't think I will be spending all that time looking for a parking spot for an just ok salad again.
2019-12-17,3,One of my favorite places to grab a quick dinner! This location -- was a bit on the messy side. I wasn't that pleased with this honeygrow and this was my second visit.First, I couldn't ignore the messiness of the toppings' area. It's right next to the Kiosk. I was disappointed to see how unappealing it looked where they cooked and prepared the food. The bathroom was also a mess. Ew!I ordered the seasonal truffle honey heat sauce w/ roasted shrimp, rice noodles, pineapple, jalapeños, pineapples (wish it was cut smaller), and cilantro. My portion size was a bit smaller than what I'm use to receiving from honeygrow. The taste was mediocre but I liked the truffle honey heat. Just wish it had more sauce. The cashier was pleasant and was helpful with obtaining extra sauce. Not sure how I feel about this particular honeygrow. Think it could be improved.
2019-12-15,1,I ordered food today and I thought ordering three stir fries was a good idea, boy was I wrong. The food I ordered today was smothered in sauces and the sesame garlic stir fry was salty to the point where it was unbearable to taste. My girlfriend loved the salads and expected better since the stir fries were signature dishes. Not to mention the noodles were bathed in a puddle of sauce which overwhelmed the flavor. I bought three stir fries and two off the popular menu, the custom one was okay but the other two tasted despicable.
2019-11-25,1,$20 for yellow arugula.  Had a salad delivered last night.  Yellow, and in some cases, yellow with dark spots arugula isn't what one is hoping for.  One would hope, at the very least, for generally fresh greens.  No worries, though, it's now also the last thing I will order at this Honeygrow.
2019-11-15,5,Delicious healthy and inexpensive. Triple threat combo. Service is also great. Only complaint is that the portions are a bit small but overall it's a good experience
2019-11-09,5,The staff at this location are amazing. I went in today and arrived 10 minutes early, it was cold out and they welcomed me in and were so nice. They work their asses off, and are always thoughtful of their customers. I come here weekly and can only give it 5 stars all bc of the staff. Food is amazing as well.
2019-11-05,5,Excellent place. Been there lots if times but my first review on yelp but it is a great review. The salads are healthy and hearty with lots of good people there to help you to choose. Excellent.
2019-10-09,5,Great spot for catering!! I am part of a student group that regularly orders food from this location for our events. Always a huge hit, and they are very accomodating with any and all requests !
2019-10-09,1,This is by far the WORST branch of Honeygrow. Two things: They never get my order right (missing ingredients - I once had the sauce missing from a delivery order), OR they add a fatal special ingredient -  I actually found half a screw in my dish. I contacted Honeygrow because I was afraid I may have consumed the other half, and they said they would send me coupons (which they never did) as if I would come back to eat here again. The experience still haunts me today I felt I had to write this review. I would never come back. Better places in Hoboken. Again, this is the worst Honeygrow branch.
2019-10-04,5,HOLY. COW. I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED!I've always heard people rave about HoneyGrow but I've never tried it until today and I swear it became my favorite spot to grab lunch from! I figured I would order online since it's in Hoboken and the lines would be out the door (and...they were lol) when I came to pick it up my order was hot and ready to go. Ordering online is so simple and easy too that it's totally worth it to skip the lines. The inside is rather big for a spot in Hoboken so definitely plenty of seats to choose from. Anyway, it was a great experience for a first time trying something new and I'm already thinking about my next order!!!Oneeeee tiny problem is the fact that the food is loaded with sauces/ broth that it seeps through the paper container and the food is packed to the very brim (which is a bonus! Haha) but it spilled all over my car but I guess paper is better than plastic. Maybe double packaging the orders would be better or taping it down.
2019-09-28,5,Egg white noodle stir fry with ground turkey is my favorite thing to have here. I have also tried Whole wheat noodles with grilled chicken stir fry which is also good and unlike most other places around Chicken is always fully cooked. They also have a cool way to order food with self ordering systems with good graphics and easy to pay machines
2019-09-19,5,I love Honeygrow!! I always do the create your own stir fry with the spicy garlic sauce and the spiced ground turkey. The Greek salad is really good too. Lots of healthy options and alternatives as well, I always get whole wheat noodles! A solid spot in downtown Hoboken. You won't be disappointed!!!
2019-08-31,5,This place is delicious and so fresh every single time! I do not like their seating set up when it is busy. Stir fry is very flavorful and overall healthy.
2019-08-26,1,Horrible staff ....intentionally slow, rude and keeps your prepaid item behind the counter while they just stand there.. it is almost as if they enjoy making the already busy commuter just stand there waiting for them to decide when you get your food....Keep in mind the place was dead (6pm) and filthy ...  no one cleaned up from the obvious lunch rush.  I recommend more supervision or for corporate to take a good look at this location.
2019-08-06,5,Love the rice noodles with spicy tofu and garlic sauce! Yum!!!
2019-07-23,1,Just ordered a chicken stir fry. Inedible. The chicken has a weird pasty texture as if it's old or has been grinded with some by products.  Going in the trash. So there goes my $ in the trash. I am just hoping I don't get food poisoning over the next hours from this.
2019-07-09,5,Love this place great environment, friendly staff and they have tables outside so you have the option of eating in or out which is nice.
2019-07-09,3,Really enjoyed the make it grain salad disappointed with amount of chicken n cheese even after I paid for additional would've given 5 stars if not
2019-07-08,2,They ran out of zucchini noodles but instead of asking us what we wanted for a substitute they made stir fry half full with only veggies and meat. We waited 25 mins for a new one and watched a bunch of other orders go out with mistakes and be taken back. Forgivable, until we watched a worker drop a container of stir fry on the ground then pick it up and continue making it! We were laughing out of disgust he saw us but someone ordering from an app still was sent food that had fallen on the ground! When we finally got our orders home, we realized they messed up again and forgot the meat this time. When we opened the other order we assumed was correct, they forgot the curry sauce. At the ended, we ate only veggies and bland unseasoned noodles.
2019-07-07,4,It was our first time getting to eat at this restaurant and it was super yummy. At first we received the wrong salad, but the staff quickly remade it. Overall this is a great lunch spot and I love the fully customizable items :)
2019-07-02,2,I come here once in a while. Usually it's pretty good, but sometimes the staff doesn't pay attention. If you order take out, make sure you check to make sure all the ingredients have been included before you get home. Very frustrating to walk all the way home only to realize half your meal is missing!
2019-07-02,4,Good place for healthy option.  Prices are okay, and portion sizes decent.  I like the kiosk to avoid having to order via a human.  Thumbs up for Purell dispenser near the kiosk.  My only gripe is that sometimes the workers behind the salad station have friends come in and they bull$hit and slow things down.
2019-06-15,5,I come here 2 to 3 times a week. The salads here taste great and are well constructed (each ingredient serves a purpose in providing a certain taste or texture that makes the overall salad greater than the sum of it's ingredients). The ingredients are fresh except for the meat which is prepared off-site (I believe). I've tried the stir-fry's. They are tasty, but like almost all stir-fry's they are very unhealthy and you'll be hungry again in an hour. Just eat the salads instead. Happy to have Honeygrow here in Hoboken.
2019-06-07,5,My new favorite lunch spot in the area. Ordered a build-your-own salad bowl with zoodles as the base and added a ton of fresh veggies on top and it was a huge amount of food all for under $10! Everything was fresh and delicious. Service can be a little slow during lunch rush, but I would recommend ordering beforehand on the app then picking up. Happy to have found this healthy spot
2019-06-07,2,The food is good however they routinely leave out salad dressing when you order delivery.
2019-05-26,4,I went with my husband on a late Sunday afternoon for lunch. We had a customized salad and a stir fry. I must say the food was really good! I was disappointed by Quality greens and was looking for a salad place. Pros: --Easy user interface for customising the food: salads, bowls or otherwise, you can exchange noodles with brown rice, change any vegetable or protein --Fresh and healthy ingredients-- Appropriate portion size-- Courteous StaffCons: A bit expensive, 15% more expensive than DnB, but hey it's delicious I will be definitely visiting again
2019-05-18,5,honestly this place is great. i used to live in philly and hadn't had this for years until i moved to jersey city (where they deliver!). they've changed in a good way since i've last been. the delivery was pretty quick ~30 min and the food was awesome. so happy there's one near me again
2019-05-02,1,Honeygrow does it again!! Get home to find missing avocado. So glad I paid extra. And even more glad I decided to give them yet ANOTHER chance.
2019-04-26,4,First time here, I ordered a grain salad and it was amazing so delicious!!! Will definitely come back. It is pricey but the food is good very fresh and delicious. 4 stars because I ordered my food to go but they didn't put any utensils or napkin in my bag bummer. When i picked up at the counter i didn't see any utensils so i assumed they had put it in my bag‍‍. Also i paid almost $2 extra for avocado and barely had any
2019-04-23,1,Honeygrow Hoboken started out great but we've had a lot of hits and misses. Tonight was a total miss.I always order extra sauce for my stir fry because the rice noodles are dry and tasteless without it. Tonight, instead of extra sauce, I got - at the most - a teaspoon of sauce - along with 2 tiny pieces of broccoli, one spinach leaf, and 5 mushrooms. The rest of my stir fry was a mass of naked rice noodles.My daughter had a stir fry with regular noodles - and also ordered extra sauce. I don't think she even had a teaspoon on hers. Dry as a bone - with a mere hint of vegetables. And, because we did take-out - not much we could do. I made a garlic sauce for her - but she was very disappointed.We go to the Honeygrow in Brooklyn Heights and its so much better - and consistently good.
2019-04-09,4,I am officially obsessed with Honeygrow; I think about it all the time and want to eat here every night of the week.  That I do not is amazing.  The red coconut curry stir fry is my favorite dish, but also the salads are great and the spring seasonal stir fry (pesto noodles with shrimp) is good as well.  I love that the nutritional information is very easily accessible and you can order one of the menu items or make your own salad or stir fry.I am not a fan of the fast casual restaurant concept, and it is what I like least about Honeygrow.  Restaurants in Hoboken in general seem to love the concept of costumers ordering and paying at a kiosk, but I find it to be a little alienating; if I don't want to talk to anyone when I grab dinner I can just cook at home.  Fast causal restaurants seem to be popular though, so maybe I'm in the minority opinion on this one.  I do like that while ordering at the kiosk I can customize the ingredients of a dish very easily.  Honeygrow needs to improve their process a bit; on one visit I received the text notification that my order was ready 10 minutes before it actually was ready.  That's okay, but I was unable to engage with an employee during this time to confirm the text was sent too early, and that was very frustrating.  I don't blame the employees however, it's the set-up of the restaurant which discourages employee-customer engagement.
2019-03-09,3,I've been going to HoneyGrow for many years since it opened. Food is very fresh and good, the only issues I would have would be the prices ...(Hoboken, expect to pay in New York City prices) and the long wait times during peak times.
2019-02-18,5,Favorite place to eat in Hoboken. Ingredients are fresh, great customer service, delicious food options and good portions.
2019-02-17,3,Honeygrow food was Okay. They "ran out" of the white balsamic dressing (not sure how that happens it's salad dressing just open another bottle) we were told this after we had ordered. If the dressings unavailable, please take it off the ordering screen, as I probably would have chosen different ingredients to go with the dressing. Also when I came home I noticed as other yelpers have I was missing croutons in my salad. I thought I must have forgotten to add them to my order, but on the receipt it says CROUTONS. If you are going to charge me for an ingredient please make sure you add that ingredient to my order. I won't be back; there's plenty of other places to eat in Hoboken. If it wasn't for the work/salad crowd I don't think this place would survive.
2019-02-15,2,I don't know how places like this survive. Where is the value in what I'm ordering? They put together whatever ingredients you want for a rice, salad or pasta bowl. I do that at the Chinese place down the block, and theirs has more flavor and is a better value.
2019-02-13,5,Honeygrow is a great lunch spot in Hoboken, especially if you like salads!Their noodles/stir fry is alright, but I almost always go with a salad! They're great! My favorite is probably the Cobb Salad - the bacon and egg in the salad are really tasty. Honeygrow is great because it has something for everyone. Honeygrow is a great spot to go out for a workday lunch or pick up lunch and take it back to your office with a group of people. Everyone can find something they like at Honeygrow! In addition to the salads and the stir fry, Honeygrow also does these little frozen yogurt with honey and granola bowls! They are great as a snack or as a dessert. They are also a super tasty alternative to "grabbing a coffee" with a friend or as a date.
2019-02-04,1,This place has gone from my absolute favorite place in Hoboken to a place I will never order from again. They halved their portion sizes for the same price and they CONSTANTLY get orders wrong. I pay more for extra ingredients and don't get them, sometimes I don't even get the standard ingredients that come in a bowl. I've given them tons of chances but I honestly can't eat there again. I wonder if there is new management or what because I used to love it here.
2019-01-03,5,Love Honeygrow.  Very interesting menu options or easily build your own with the easy touch screen.  Focus on locally sourced ingredients.  I usually get the noodle bowls although the salads look great also.  Portions are big, I usually end up taking half home.
2018-12-03,4,I ordered a salad with spinach, bacon, hard boiled egg, croutons, chicken, cucumbers, goat cheese, and Parmesan dressing.  Absolutely delicious.  Totally recommend.
2018-11-27,2,Our experience at the Hoboken Honeygrow gets more and more frustrating. Although the food is good the experience is awful and inconsistent. When we first starting going to honeygrow about a year ago they were efficient, accurate, kind and fast. Now they are sloppy, rude and slow. They consistent forget something from our order and use the wrong ingredients that we selected for our create your own meals. Today we orders on the mobile app for pick up and after my boyfriend walked back home with our meals, the lettuce cup that is the base of my entire meal was missing. He proceeded to walk back to the restaurant to be greeted with NO apology and rude judgement when he asked for a bag. I really love the food but given this constant disappointment I don't think I'll be returning to honeygrow until they fix their operational pitfalls and staffing.
2018-11-19,5,I love honeygrow. Love the food, love the interior, as well as the exterior, especially during the warmer seasons when they have outdoor seating. The system they use to order food is unique, and their employee they have out greeting guests in the dining hall, Arvin? I believe is his name, he is super friendly, very congenial. He helped me place my order and answered every question I had. He had a such a positive attitude towards me as well as the other customers, and if it weren't for him, I would've left out of confusion and aggravation.
2018-11-12,5,Very surprised it has such low stars! I had such a great customer service experience and a very delicious meal. The ingredients were top notch and the place was popping.  The people greet everyone that comes in and you can see all the workers in the back working hard to get all the food fresh, out quickly, and deliciously prepared.I will definitely be back!
2018-11-06,2,$8.50 for a spinach salad with one egg, the allowed number of toppings, no cheese, and an extra $.50 for a piece of bread, which is kind of lame.  This is a pretty small salad, btw.  Unimpressed.Oh, and they forgot the dressing.  Awesome.  This is why I hate ordering on a touchscreen because you don't get to see your salad being made.  Why is this so hard?
2018-10-29,5,Very friendly staff for such a high volume of customers around lunch. Especially the guy at the register today:)
2018-10-26,3,lots of options for vegan/vegetarians and food is pretty tasty. i'd say the quality is inconsistent and depends on who is working. there have been several occasions where my order is missing things and the veggies are undercooked. but overall it's an easy quick meal when you're trying to maintain conscious eating.
2018-10-24,5,I usually complain about how slow this place is but the food is delicious and if I'm in a rush I order on the app. However I recently had a situation where the employees went above and beyond and certainly locked in my business for a while. I ordered a CYO stir fry on the app for pick up, when I eventually sat down to eat I discovered there were no noodles. I immediately called to complain, they asked if I could come back to which I said no and without question they told me I would be refunded and comp'd a free meal on my next visit, this was very nice but honestly I just wanted to enjoy my stir fry and asked if someone could deliver noodles to me. They said okay (I don't live too far) and would deliver a totally new stir fry not just the noodles.  Shortly after I hung up I discovered I was the one that messed up and didn't order any noodles (honestly the app should be designed better). I called them and said thank you but it was my fault, they had already figured that out but were not at all perturbed and remained very pleasant.  I thought that was that and I ate my noodle less stir fry. About 20 minutes later honey grow called to say the delivery man was out front. I was so surprised and he said not to worry about it and they wanted me to enjoy the meal I expected and paid for (after all it's at least $11 with or without the noodles). In addition they gave me a coupon for a free meal. This made an unfortunate situation much better. Props to the staff at Honey Grow for handling it so well.
2018-10-24,5,I love this place.  Was walking by 2 weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  I purchased the create your own stir fry.  I've been back already since the first time.  Just love the veggie options with heat instead of always opting for a cold, dry salad.  The stir fry is only one of the healthy food options.  I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a quick, inexpensive healthy option!! I've only visited the one in Brooklyn; the place appears to be very clean and the staff are nice and accommodating.
2018-10-23,4,Really good choice if you're in the neighborhood and after a custom salad with really fresh ingredients.  Make sure to come at off-hours (for lunch, before 11:30am) because the lines can get looong.
2018-10-13,3,I have visited a dozen times for lunch and kept coming back because the Wheat Noodle salad is delicious. But... as mentioned in earlier reviews this Honey Grow is mismanaged. I ordered delivery today - one salad and the order was wrong. It was missing the protein. It's annoying to pay extra for delivery and tip & not get what was ordered.  My money  was refunded through Grubhub.   Last time I ordered in the restaurant and took home to eat and a main ingredient was missing from the salad.  As many others have mentioned the wait time is crazy !  For a salad where the ingredients are pre-prepared you could wait 15-20 minutes. I have visited the locations in both Philadelphia and Cherry Hill and the experience is much better at these locations. I am moving on for the reasons mentioned above but also because the salad portions are getting smaller as another reviewer mentioned and not worth the $10 plus dollars.
2018-10-10,2,Their overall operation was chaotic and the few folks who worked in the front seemed disoriented. For a fast casual restaurant that advertise healthy food & a fast check out options via mobile ordering or self ordering on their mini screens at the venue, I was surprised they weren't able to match supply and demand. A few observations:I waited more than 20 minutes for my food (I ordered via mobile and my food arrived 10 minutes after the expected time). While I was waiting, the cooks in the back were busy cooking up a storm to fulfill the orders, two people in the front near the salad bar were busy filling orders - the woman on the left side was fine, the man on the right side (near the foundation drinks) was very disorganized. They use the beige tape to tape the cover of the chinese takeout boxes; I never seen this at at restaurant. While the man was getting the ingredients (veggies or chicken) to put inside the paper / cardboard Chinese take out carton, some of the ingredients even touched the tape. Eww.One of the guys who was moving the cooking pots or pans dropped all the pots & pans on the floor which made a loud noise. Everyone seemed to be in a rush and disorganized to fulfill the orders. There were at least 10-15 customers standing around the cashier waiting. I think the way they set up the waiting area for pick up and walk in orders (when they order on the screen at the restaurant) were very sloppy. They also need a bigger kitchen space in the back to so stir fry. There were at least 3 guys in the back; with the heat and small space, it is understandable that everyone was having a difficult time cooking and moving around. Honeygrow is the same company as Minigrow but if you ever visit a Minigrow or Honeygrow in the city, you will see how efficient their operation is compared to this Hoboken location.Additionally, the manner in which they handled the food and taped the top to keep the lid on was utterly sloppy and disgusting. I will not be going back to this location. I actually felt bad for the guy near the cashier (maybe the manager), who was scrambling around to pack the food.
2018-10-03,3,Very modern! I really like the order process with the computer & check out options w CC machine or cash.  Convenient!! Looked very clean & the staff is friendly. I'll def come back!!
2018-09-18,3,My friend was coming over and sent me a quick text saying he was at honeygrow and could pick something up for me on his way.  I had been eager to try the healthier quick-serve restaurant, so this seemed like the ideal opportunity.  I decided to Create My Own Stir-Fry, starting with a base of brown rice.  I then added their non-GMO, roasted spicy tofu as my protein and contemplated my selections for the 3 included vegetables.  I wound up opting for the shredded carrots, snap peas, and mushrooms, and then proceeded to the sauce selection, choosing the sesame garlic sauce.  Unfortunately, I was not aware that I was also entitled to 2 garnishes, such as pickled cucumber and spiced agave cashews, so I missed out on those toppings.Once my meal arrived, I smiled at the familiar Chinese takeout packaging and grabbed some chopsticks for the fun meal that awaited.  The tofu had a subtle kick that was still distinctive beneath the heavy amount of garlic sauce.  All of the vegetables were crisp and fresh, but I was disappointed to find snow pea pods instead of sugar snap peas.  Snow peas were not even a menu option!  Also, my friend had apparently asked for them to go easy on my portion of sauce, though I found it rather saturated.  Overall, the flavor was rich and impactful though, so I would say this would be more of a 3.5-star rating.
2018-08-31,1,I had a horrible experience here. We were waiting at least half an hour (being generous) for our honey bar order. Not even a stir fry- honey bar. When we got there there was hardly a soul in the place. When we left there were about 25 people waiting for their orders to be done. As per the worker their machine wasn't working so they weren't getting orders. Not sure why the mass group of people did not allude to something being wrong but it is what it is. He assured me he'd get right to it. I waited about ten more minutes- saw that there was no sense of urgency from any of the staff. I left without my food as I had no where to go. $7.00 and 45 minutes shot to hell. Not happy about it. Sucks because I used to love this place.
2018-08-28,2,Customized my salad. They did not include everything I ordered. Salad is very small and not worth the price. Will try their noodles and stir fry next go around.
2018-08-28,2,I've literally been waiting 40 minutes (and counting) for a salad and decided to write a review since I've got all this free time.The last time I came, they completely forgot to put the chicken in. It's a chicken salad, and they forgot the chicken.I used to come here just about everyday as my office is nearby. It used to be pretty good then and it was my go-to spot. But the quality and service has gone downhill in a big way over the past couple months, and it seems from all of the other recent negative reviews that I'm not alone in thinking that. The customer service reps at their HQ are always super responsive and helpful, but I shouldn't have to reach out to them so frequently about order issues.Unless you're okay with waiting 40 minutes for a salad that might be wrong anyway, go somewhere else.Giving them 2 stars for the quality of the ingredients they use (the veggies are always really fresh) and the fact that they do get my orders right the majority of the time.
2018-08-01,1,Honeygrow has a great brand and great staff, but the food not so great. Not only waiting 20+ minutes (only person at the restaurant at this time), the food was undercooked and drenched with thick sauce. The stir-fry comes out slimy, unhealthy, and a waste of money. My instructions were not honored and I felt rushed out of the restaurant. There are too many great food options centralized in such a small place that I'd recommend look elsewhere. I hope to return some day if I see some improvements.
2018-08-01,1,Ordered seasonal crab noodle take out. Charged $5 for the crab. Got ZERO crabmeat. Make sure you have the protein you ordered before you leave.
2018-07-29,3,I enjoy the food, but this place will be completely empty and still take over 10 minutes to make a salad. It's so frustrating. The Parmesan crips are great salad add though.
2018-07-26,2,This place is the worst. When done properly, their salads are good. Unfortunately, they consistently and without fail screw up my orders. Did you pay an extra $1.25 for parm crisps? Oops forgot those. Did you pay an extra $1.50 for avocado? Forgot that too. Does a Cobb salad have bacon? Oops we left that out. Their salads are pricey to begin with and when they charge an additional 15% to 25% for add-ons that they forget to include, it ruins the experience. I recommend avoiding Honeygrow.
2018-07-26,1,This place is in serious need of a manager. I once waited 39 minutes for my food and even then they forgot half of my order. Gave them another shot recently and both times ingredients were missing from salads. Complained to their customer service line and never even received a response. This place is run by children. Don't waste your money here.
2018-07-24,1,Heard a lot of good things about this place and decided to try it out since I work so close. First of all the female workers attitude is disgusting. I had ordered food with brown rice, one of the employees had explained it would be 15 mins so the rice could cook. I didn't mind waiting...until it was past 30 minuets so I had asked how much longer and the female works had rolled their eyes at me. They were extremely rude to be verbally and attitude wise. I don't recommend anyone going their again. Update: I took my food home and there was paper in my food
2018-07-24,2,Delicious, but evidently the stir fry comes in a half portion now. Used to come in a larger takeout container, then in the Chinese food container (cute but less food), now it's half a Chinese food container. All for the same price.  Will be our last order from Honeygrow.Update: I emailed honeygrow this morning per their instructions below-still waiting for a response.
2018-07-22,4,Since moving to Hoboken, I had been wanting to try Honeygrow. I hadn't yet because it was a bit of a walk from where a live. Fast forward to one Sunday, when my BF and I were walking around trying to decide what to eat for lunch. We wanted something relatively healthy, and that's when he pointed out HoneyGrow.Once you walk in, it's a self-ordering system. They have a few stations where you can pick what you want and customize it to exactly how you like it. I went with the summer seasonal item, the Chesapeake Crab (noodles (+50 cents for wheat), with tomatoes, red onion, scallion, parsley, and swapped the bell pepper for bean sprouts). It was served in this tomato brothy sauce, which was packed with flavor. They also gave a generous helping of crab, which I did not expect. I enjoyed every bite, especially with some Sriracha sauce. BF got the Sweet Soy Five Spice (brown rice, spiced ground turkey, green beans, red onions, sesame seeds). He liked his too but his portion looked small - smaller than mine at least.My favorite thing about Honeygrow is that the menu items are customizable. If there's a menu item you like but an ingredient in there that you don't, you can easily swap it out. If that's still not your thing, you can always create your own stir fry. Be prepared to wait though. We waited about 15 minutes before our food was finally ready. But it was worth the wait.
2018-07-18,2,I have eaten there 4-5x per week for the last 6 months. No longer...their staff is inattentive, more aloof than rude. Orders are long delayed leaving the kitchen and are often incorrect. Ownership and management should make changes immediately.
2018-07-17,2,Only giving 2 stars due to the NEW APP which SUCKS!!   You need to go back to the previous app for ordering, I get food for executives at my job everyday and this order was a nightmare.  First I couldn't get the app to work, then I had to leave a co-worker dealing with the problem placing the order and calling the location manager to troubleshoot.  While all this is happening I am driving to the location to pick up the food!  Bad idea changing an app that was just fine!
2018-07-13,5,The employee who responded to me sent me a giftcard for $15. Thought this was very nice. Got a salad and its pretty good! I appreciate good customer service
2018-07-08,1,Place really fell off. I ordered the make it grain salad and I was not a fan. The flavors did not work and the dressing was overly salty.  They claim to have all these ingredients in the salad but there is barely anything in there. I should have listened to the reviews of this place before ordering. They also gave my wife a completely wrong order. The guy over the phone refunded us the salad which was a saving grace. Looks like the quality has gone down here...
2018-07-06,3,We ordered rice noodles in coconut curry, which was good. Although it would taste better if the food was more warm and there was more of the curry sauce. You can choose your veggies and protein through a kiosk, which is used to place your order and that is what I really liked about the place as you can customise the dish as per your taste. But we ordered for red yellow bell peppers and instead got green capsicum. Otherwise overall it was ok.
2018-07-02,1,I'm so grossed out. I was about halfway through eating a stir fry and I found a big fly in it. I was actually enjoying the meal until I found this. Safe to say, I will never be returning.
2018-06-24,4,I love this place because of the humanely, locally raised protein they get. The selection in this area is slim and they do a great job at a quick, healthy, delicious fix. This is a great place to sit and do work but...Except for my biggest problem which is that the music is TOO LOUD!!!! Way way way too loud. It's too loud to do work, to sit for my meal, and to talk to someone sitting next to me or infront of me. The music selection is amazing, but please tone it down.
2018-06-19,1,Food is pretty good, but service is terrible. If you order more than 1 item prepare for them to forget something. It happens at least half the time you go in there. And instead of apologizing for you having to stand there while orders placed after you come out before you, they just try and act like nothing happened. Update:1 star- they consistently give you an incorrect or incomplete order and you don't realize until you get home and open the box. Then they tell you to come back if you want a refund. I came there to get a quick meal on the way to something else I have to do, I'm not coming back because I don't have time
2018-06-15,4,Good and speedy service and great taste. However, it is a bit expensive for fast food.
2018-06-15,5,The food is fantastic, everything is always fresh.  I can eat this everyday.  Customer service is absolutely amazing.  We had ordered honeygrow for our military unit and they were very accommodating.  Thanks again for the great food and excellent service!!!
2018-06-15,5,I have eaten at this location multiple times and it has never failed to provide a delicious fresh meal! Recently I put in a catering order for my company for several days and Steven the Catering Manage r has been nothing but supportive, patient and helpful. Despite changing our order several times and having some difficulty with the payment issues Steven worked with us every step of the way! I would recommend this location for just an easy lunch or dinner  but also for any of your catering needs. I love honeygrow!
2018-06-13,3,Like the concept of self service order kiosks. Wasnt very impressed by the food. Will give it a couple of more trys.
2018-06-05,4,I ordered a vegetarian CYO stir fry from this location through yelp.The pickup was quick and easy but after reaching home discovered that the meal had chicken pieces in it. No reply whatsoever on calling the location.Eat at your own risk !Update:I was reached out eventually by the business and I was compensated fairly for that .
2018-05-18,1,I went back to HG today for the first time since my last review. My order was prepared incorrectly yet again. There was an extra item that I had paid for which was left out of my salad. Unfortunately I did not realize the omission until I was already home. I actually emailed the management team as I had been asked to in response to my last review and never received a reply. Maybe it's all for show - asking those that leave negative reviews to contact them.
2018-05-15,5,Great fresh salads. Love how you give you options and let you make your own dishes as well. Last time we tried the noodle salad and it was awesome. This time we made our own salad and stir-fry and they were amazing. After a great workout we wanted to eat healthy and this was the perfect spot
2018-05-15,5,Why has Honeygrow not yet eclipsed Sweetgreen?!? It's better quality, better tasting, and less expensive. Plus- so easy. When you walk in, you use the giant touch screen (there are several) to customize your order and pay. Your delicious salad or bowl comes out fast, and you're good to go! It's the perfect spot for a healthy lunch, especially in a busy work day.Any dietary restricted humans can find something to love here. I customized a Cobb Salad and let me tell you, mesclun+spinach and balsamic (no cheese, thanks) makes it a healthy salad and super fresh.Rooting for honeygrow to steal the market from sweetgreen
2018-05-09,1,Was looking for a salad place in Hoboken, and came across this place.  The spinach salad was dry, the chicken was almost frozen, the vegetables and toppings were not fresh. would not recommend.
2018-05-02,2,When the place first opened it was amazing. But the food product has greatly decreased since then. I am writing this review after my last 3 experiences were bad. Yes, I gave it 3 more tries because I used to love this place. One time the stir fry was burnt, I actually returned it and ask for a new one. The second time there was barely any sauce on my stir fry. And well this past week I got my stir fry and it wasn't cooked. The spinach looked the same way it would on a salad and the pineapple was still cold. I really hope management comes in and pays attention to the product going out to its customers. Unfortunately, I won't be returning.
2018-04-30,2,The first few times I ordered from here I really loved it. Ordered last night and they mustve changed up their portions to save money. I ordered tofu as my protein and there was only 3 tiny cubes of it in the whole salad. Also added avocado and there was only one sliver of it. If youre paying extra for items you expect there to be an acceptable quantity of them.
2018-04-21,1,Avoid, was once good but service has rapidly declined and workers almost always forget items in orders. I was given a stir fry with NO SAUCE, how is that even possible? If you want a good meal go up the street to quality greens kitchen, forget this place
2018-04-18,4,I got the egg noodles with chicken, broccoli, green beans, and carrots with spicy garlic sauce. Topped with sesame seeds and pickled cucumbers. Their lemonade is really good too. Ordering on the kiosk was easy but it was crowded so it took a while to get the food. The floor was a little dirty with food in the dining area.
2018-04-09,2,Service: 0 stars; Food: 2. They lost my order when I was standing at the counter - frustrating experience when you only have a 20 min lunch break. Food is ok but not a lot for your money.
2018-04-01,4,This is one of my favorite places to get stir fry! I like using the kiosk and it gives the customer the opportunity to look through the ingredients thoroughly. Staff there is very nice. I have gone there mostly during lunch hours so it is usually pretty full in there and the wait can take a while. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and the food is great!
2018-03-26,4,The food is amazing!!.....however expect to wait at least 25 mins. It's not a quick grab and go experience after work!
2018-03-24,4,I loved my meal. It was delicious. I ordered the chicken stir fry and the better off red cold pressed juice (pre-packaged). It's an open kitchen so you can see them cook your meal in front of you, which is nice. Portion was a good size for the price. Ordered on GrubHub through yelp. It was convenient and quick.
2018-03-22,5,William was very professional. He took matters into his own hands and helped me immediately, definitely come back again:)
2018-03-22,1,Complete and utter disappointment. I paid $12 for one of the smallest portions I have ever seen. Although the flavor was good, 100% not worth the money and would not recommend. The picture below is exactly how it came, untouched & uneaten.
2018-03-22,1,really bad stirfry and extremely overpriced for the amount of food. They also didnt close it properly and it went everywhere
2018-03-17,3,Love this place good tasting food good quality   one time my salad was missing ingredients and the manager was nice enough to waive the cost for my next meal there
2018-03-08,5,I love, love, love this place. For my first visit, an employee asked me if I had any questions and, after finding out it was my first time, talked me through the menu. She listed her favorites, and was also very descriptive on flavors of topping options. The portion sizes are huge and I always feel full after eating here. I highly recommend if you like healthy and fabulous food selections.
2018-03-07,5,This place is delicious. Great healthy options and the service is awesome!! Love the honeybar option for a treat!
2018-03-01,5,I love honeygrow! The Hoboken staff is so fast and friendly but the best part is the quality of food. The stir frys are always made fresh to order and there is nowhere around like it!
2018-03-01,5,Just tried the red coconut curry and LOVED it! Will definitely make this a new go-to to pick up for lunch or dinner! Everything was super fresh and you can customize whatever you want on the menu! Always hard to find quality places for value in the city, so happy to have found honeygrow!
2018-02-21,4,First time visit. Had tuna salad with some add-ins. Tasted fresh. Not too much dressing. Hubby had Cobb salad with add-ins. Liked his too. We shared fruit & honey for dessert. Lovely! Open one near us in Bergen County.
2018-02-15,2,Service needs significant improvement!I'll start by saying that the ingredients and meal overall is always good. I've been going to HG for years and usually get salads because of the ability to customize and enjoy the stir-fry when I do order.However, HG has always struggled to get customer service right (at least at this location) and similar to other reviewers, there's usually something incorrect about the order.Tonight was the first time I got so frustrated I almost walked out. I encountered a very negative employee making salads that incorrectly put tuna on top of my salad (side note: who actually likes tuna?). When I corrected her and told her it was okay just to take it off she had an unnecessary attitude, threw the salad out, did not apologize for the already 15 minute wait and aggressively slammed together my new salad. Without speaking one word. I want to be understanding that there might be something happening in her personal life but I have learned in the service industry you must put on a poker face and be pleasant to customers and fellow employees.I will likely be returning because I do enjoy the food, but if I'm in a hurry or trying to avoid negative vibes will likely go elsewhere for lunch and dinner.
2018-02-01,1,Why is this place so crap?  Keep messing up our orders and providing such bland food??  Never going back.
2018-01-30,4,Been wanting to try this place since being in Hoboken as it looks pretty good from the outside. This review is based off of a one time visit. I ordered shrimp stir fry with spicy garlic sauce and rice noodles. Serving size is decent so price of almost $12 is reasonable. Problem is the meal lacked salt. Understanding that it is a "healthier" alternative to take out foods in Hoboken which I am thankful for, I won't go too hard on the review but as we know , even a hint of salt can change the world. Anyway I liked the experience because I ordered and received my meal in about 5 minutes and the food is fresh.I will try again and update my review if there are any changes.
2018-01-25,4,I give this place 4 stars because their ingredients are great. I will say that they've gotten my order wrong multiple times and it's been frustrating. However, when they do get my order right, the meal is great. I typically get stirfry because that hits the spot with my tastebuds, but I have gotten salads here and thought they were fine. I can tell that they've hired some new staff and they are trying to do better with their customer service so I do want to give them credit for that. There was a period of time when they handed out coupons because I think they realized they were getting a lot of orders wrong and trying to bring back customers, which I think was a great idea.Overall, my experience with them has been average. Mistakes happen and sometimes too often, but the food makes up for it and makes me want to keep coming back. I don't know what is in their sauce but it is so great!
2018-01-24,3,Decent taste, little expensive lunch option , definitely healthy options , always choose ur own plate
2018-01-13,3,Healthy fast food option. Pretty pricey for what you get, but food is fresh. I like that they have an app, so you can order and pickup on the way home.
2018-01-10,3,I'm upgrading to 3 stars since the food has been consistently good and without missing ingredients lately.  However, the portions seem to have been cut by about a third, with the prices at or above what they used to be.  Not a good move.
2018-01-09,4,I didnt expect much but it was pretty good. I came after the gym thinking it would be healthy but not everything is, or rather the bowl i made was not. I got the egg noodle bowl w mushroom, tofu, beans, broccoli, cilantro and fried shallots in a red curry sauce. It definitely tastes good and has a nice freshly cooked charred flavor.  Id come again!
2018-01-04,2,GREAT food, but so, so, so slow service and cooking time! Waited 30 min for a stir-fry! I'm not expecting speedy Micky-D servings, but 30 min for a to-go meal is simply too long. Never again - sorry, Honeygrow.
2017-12-19,2,I usually love honeygrow! As a gluten free person I love that they have rice noodles! Sadly, they just gave me the incorrect order which I didn't realize until I got home. Thank god I realized the noodles weren't what I ordered otherwise I would be super sick! Note to self, always double check your order before you leave any restaurant!
2017-12-13,5,I want to give a huge shoutout to Shenise! Thank you so so much! My husband and I walked in at 9:58pm and they were already starting to clean up. We asked if they were closed and she said, "What time is it?", when we said 9:58 she said, "We're open, put in your order!" She was so kind and made our salads so quickly and not even complaining, even though I'm sure she was ready to go home for the night. At the end we offered her a tip and she so politely refused and said they happily accept reviews on Yelp, so here it is! Thank you Shenise!!!!!!
2017-12-13,3,I am a regular customer at honeygrow so when I saw that they changed the size of the salad bowl I was very upset. The bowl is much smaller than the original size and the prices are the same, which is expensive. I asked for a salad with extra dressing and ended up with a container of oil because there was not enough vinegar mixed in with the oil. The salad was not appetizing at all. I really hope they change the size back to what they had because the size they have now is not filling.
2017-12-04,5,BEST STIRFRY IVE EVER HAD!! I got the Sweet Soy Five Spice stir-fry bowl and substituted the turkey for Tofu 5/5 Stars
2017-11-28,3,When they get it right, this place is great - but I've now had multiple instances where my order doesn't have all the ingredients I chose, some of which I paid extra for.
2017-11-28,2,ReAlly liked honeygrow at the beginning but lately my salads started getting lighter and lighter until the day when they called my number and the lady handed me the paper bag to go and I literally thought she gave me an empty bowl  so I opened and voila new to go bowls which are smaller and filled much less salad. Not more my fave place I'll buy my salad elsewhere. For over 11$ I want more salad ! It's not filet mignon its salad !!! And that small bowl was not even filled with 4 poor tofu bites. Disappointed very very much
2017-11-21,1,Unfortunately I had to write this review. I actually like the food but their service sucks! This literally just happened: Ordered through Seamless at 8 pmGot a text at 8:30 pm saying the food is on the way9 pm the food still didn't show up Seamless order tracking said the food has been deliveredCalled restaurant 5 times nobody picked up Called Seamless and they couldn't reach the restaurant eitherCanceled order through Seamless at 9:20 pmThe delivery guy showed up at 9:30 pm and said he won't give us the food because we canceled and he walked awayCalled the restaurant another 3 times still nobody picked up. Don't order from this place unless you are interested in waiting for 1.5 hr for nothing.
2017-11-18,5,Dennis and Will were super helpful!!Grub hub a delivery service, failed to deliver food items ordered.BUT the manager and staff completely compensated me.This the of customer service should not be over looked in the food industry:)Also the food is delish, Very happy customer.
2017-11-16,1,This place has the worst customer service and very low quality. I would give zero stars if possible. Good food when it's right, but that is very rare, so it's not worth wasting your money (have wasted $50+ on incorrect orders at this place).I stopped coming here for a little while because the peppers and green beans tasted old and were not fresh. They also got my noodle base selection incorrect multiple times. I had conversations with management and the former issue was solved.I received an incorrect order using the app which was ordered for pickup. I called and requested a refund to my credit card because I had left the store (after a very rude employee handed me/threw my food at me since it wasn't in the pickup section 10 minutes after the designated pickup time. I was told I needed to come back to the store in order to receive a refund. I will be returning to get that refund issued to my credit card. Horrible system that it can't be processed otherwise.We ordered from Seamless and yet again the order was wrong. I tried calling the store and all I got was a busy signal. Once again, another order wasted. Honeygrow, I like the food when you get it right, but when you only get it right 25% of the time, it's not worth the frustration.
2017-11-13,5,Fabulous foods! The option of creating your own plate is really awesome. Food is usually fresh and tastier than I would get in other places.
2017-11-06,4,Stir fry at its finest! Sometimes they get the orders mixed up but it's not too big of a deal. That's why I gave them 4 stars, nothing with the food just with the accuracy of the toppings mixes
2017-10-27,3,Writing an update for Honeygrow because I've gone back now 2 times since and they've had a drastic improvement (solid 3.5 stars but because they did me so wrong the first time they are at 3 stars right now, might up this is I have another good experience). The last two times I've gone, I've gotten the salad and also the stir-fry. The sauce this time was pretty yummy and my noodles were cooked. I really did enjoy my experience and there was also every staff members asking if they could take our trays away. This was a night and day experience from my first experience.
2017-10-18,2,Overrated and expensive. For many in America, Asian food means adding twice as much salt to any recipe.Honeygrow dishes suffer from this.
2017-10-12,2,I had high hopes when I walked into Honeygrow.  Choices up on the board had appeal and looked to be healthy options - the restaurant was clean and had a good energy level. Love the kiosks for ordering!The problem was that the Stir Fry I ordered (Red Coconut Curry) was quite oily and very bland. It was a little pricey but had the food been better that would have been ok. It's possible that using more sauce might have increased the flavor to a satisfactory level; not sure about the amount of oil - maybe one more try is needed to see if the heavy oil was a outlier.
2017-10-09,2,Had some good options but the overall taste was very bland. They also hold back on ingredients. I ordered spinach in my bowl and felt like i only had a sprinkle of spinach. Never coming back here
2017-09-28,5,Their salads are fresh and the homemade dressings are pretty good. Love the option to create my own salad. Impressed with the egg white noodle dishes. Definitely a nice healthy option!
2017-09-26,4,Healthy fast food?  Check.I end up here a couple of times a month when I'm simply too tired to make dinner and have to be up early the next day.  Veggies and protein are super fresh (never once have I gotten anything questionable).  Salad with cold ramen noodles and tofu, avocado and cucumbers is my go to.  Honeygrow to the recuse!Enter and walk up to the kiosks. Everything is ordered on a kiosk.  If you want to pay cash, make sure you select that at the end.  You pick what you want and custom order.  Base items are salad, stir fry or the honeycup.  Salads are fresh - there's no chance you are getting any yuck brown lettuce or ice berg here.  You can add avocado and special house made like diced pickled peppers, tea soaked raisins and pumpernickel croutons.  All the dressings are made in house and labeled GF, V, LF to make it easy.  If you want more than one dressing, just ask!  My personal fave is the honey ginger.  It's one of the only lower fat ones and it's really silky and gingery tasting.I really like honeygrow.  Like that I can choose my own ingredients for fresh salads and stir frys.  Dinner when I have had a long day has never been easier and healthier.
2017-09-25,1,Usually love Honeygrow but today it was terrible . Ordered the food and then they told me no more sesame garlic sauce and I'm vegan but I don't like the curry sauce ! How do you as a franchise run out of sesame garlic sauce so eating this stir fry with tofu and broccoli and carrots just tastes awful. The guy that was making was nice enough to at least warn me but come on a franchise running out of sesame garlic sauce is not good at all !
2017-09-23,5,This is a favorite healthier food but still tasty spot in town.  Feels clean and fresh.  Friendly but more importantly the food is freshly prepared and satisfying.
2017-09-13,4,I am OBSESSED with this place and if they were on Seamless, I'd be broke.com. It is refreshing to have a place to go to in Hoboken that has healthy and fresh ingredients. I am a fan of both the salads and the stir fry. The touch screen ordering system makes it easy to customize your order so you can get exactly what you want. This place gets super crowded during rush hour when people are on their way back from the PATH. Apparently they have an app now where you can order ahead which would be great so you can skip the line. Even when there is a line, you usually get your food within 5-10 minutes.
2017-09-08,1,EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!! This place honestly is great for anyone who is wanting to eat healthy/clean . But the customer service environment? Is HORRIBLE. Is a bunch of young kids with attitudes . They don't greet you when you walk through the doors . I've had four times where either it was my order or my wife's order was missing either a topping or either mixed up tofu for turkey. I understand that this is a popular food location in Hoboken and it gets really busy but that should be enough motivation as a restaurant business to basically get it together . And have everything down packed . Every time i walk in the cooks and the additional employees are horsing around, and the employees in the back I'm guessing in the break room you can hear them yelling . The managers are horsing around with them as well and you can't even tell who's the manager . Now my question is why is it that there's only 1-2 people per station especially when it's BUSY. The other employees are in the back just hanging out . There's a good I would say 10-20 people still waiting for their foods all the time this happens. The people who run the food have forgotten to hand me the drinks that I have payed for and have the audacity to give attitude and slam the drinks on the counter instead of handing it to you. I'm usually here at least 3-4 times through out the week and it's the same thing all the time . And this food is expensive not too add . So it's not fair to have to experience an unpleasant service every single time . I'm pretty sure that's there's customers who feel this way based upon their facial expressions when they experience the same customer service as I do . To top it off I just ordered the Sour Cherry BBQ and I got NO SAUCE it was so dry and oily and on top of that I got raw garlic mixed in ?!!!! WOW !!!!!! Me and my fiancé ordered the same stir-fry and she also got NO SAUCE AND NO FRIED SHALLOTS ON TOP HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE ! Never ever coming back . I'm done spending so much money for horrible a continuous horrible service
2017-08-20,5,Honeygrow specializes in all locally sourced products. They have a board stating where each of their ingredients originate from, including the vegetables and chicken. The place is computerized with touchscreen terminals where you enter your orders for food and drinks (no alcohol). They have already made salads and stir fry, or you could select your own ingredients. Everything is natural, organic and from local sources.When I'm craving a salad or stir fry there is no better place than Honeygrow! A great option in town for a healthy and quick bite!
2017-08-17,3,I love Honeygrow and go frequently but DON'T GET THE CHICKEN OR TOFU! I got the tofu once and, to be fair, it was around 8:30 so maybe this was a factor but the tofu was very tough. Then, the first time I added chicken to my salad I thought it tasted rubbery and uncooked. Later, I decided to give the chicken another try only to have the same rubbery taste from the chicken spread all over the rest of the perfectly good salad.
2017-08-16,3,It's great when they get your order right. Three times already they forgot to add  tuna on my salad.  I  order to go, so I don't realize till I get home. By then, I don't have the time nor energy to go back and complain. I paid shy of $12 bucks and no protein. Furious!!! It's been hours since this happened, yet I can't shake it off. So, here's my 2 cents for you, check your order before you leave. You shouldn't have to, but the only other alternative is to make your salad the old fashioned way... At home.
2017-08-02,1,Poorly run place desperately needs new management. I've always waited at this place while they struggle to new up with demands at high traffic times but just witnessed a clear violation of the health code when one of the cooks was wearing plastic gloves, checked his phone, then went right back to handling the food with the same gloves on. The staff all seem like they are not managed well and this will bet last visit after demanding a refund and leaving.
2017-08-02,5,Consistently reliable and delicious food. Easy ordering with the touch screens, with an easy to understand pricing guide as you go along. Whether you get salads, noodles, or the unique and delicious honey and fruit desserts, Honeygrow has yet to disappoint. Plenary of veg and vegan options as well. When busy the food can take a while at peak hours, but typically you have your meal in minutes.
2017-07-18,5,This is a regular spot for me in Hoboken. The menu is diverse and the create your own makes every order of mine completely new and different. I also love how fresh the ingredients are. The flavors are well developed and this kind of restaurant is what thrives in NYC, so it's great to have one in Hoboken for a few dollars less. I swap back and forth between salads and stir fries because they're both so yummy! There is also a ton of seating both inside and out, and the food comes out quickly even when they're super busy. My husband also ordered me a gift card here, and one thing I love about this place is that they HAND write cards to go with gift certificates and will mail them to recipients (if necessary), such a nice touch!So yeah. I love this place.
2017-07-10,3,I eat here 2x a week at least....and it seems that for stir fries, they always forget a key ingredient, or worse, the sauce.  Still good, but dry!
2017-07-09,5,Need one of these in Bergen county!!! The sauces are amazing and I love all of the options. Their stir fry is the best I've ever had! I've been here on the weekends and during the week, week crew is definitely better at serving sizes and customer service. I live 40 mins away and am still a frequent here.
2017-07-08,2,The star level goes for the service provided here. I do love the food here, but the service is really lacking. Rude and  inattentive workers makes me feel like I don't want to return
2017-07-02,5,We went on a very busy hour but the service was quick so we didn't have to wait long. I forgot what exactly I ordered but it's something with the sour cherry sauce and it's the bomb! I liked it so much that I had to search the recipe so I can make it at home. Unfortunately, couldn't recreate the exact taste. Lol my bf had the stir fried noodles and I actually liked his order better than mine. Right level of spice that wasn't too overwhelming. I was so satisfied with the food that I had to look if they have a branch in NYC. I hate to say that for some reason, there was a stark difference in taste between these two branches.
2017-06-28,1,Honestly, I've never been here before but they messed my bestfriends order up.. and no one messes with my best friend/people I love so for that you get 1 star
2017-06-27,4,I like their marketing; but feel they have space to improve about the quality and quantity of the food.It is totally a self-help store. There is no cashier there but only nice machines with nice pictures. The restaurant is also clean with open kitchen. You can see how they prepare food. The staffs there are friendly. The restaurant brands their healthy food, and almost convinced me: many vegetables there to choose, salad looks beautiful, until I realize it is not really healthy for their oily stir-fried category food.For the stir-fry style dishes, they are definitely Asian. As mentioned, they are oily, more than Asian-Asian and comparable to some American-Asian. In Asia things are fried in order: different food need different heats; in this store it looks like they mix whatever protein, vegetables, sauces, etc. and stir-fry them altogether with oil. Of course finally there are raw things and there are over-cooked things. Luckily I never see meat are undercooked, probably their standard is to fully cook the meat and let the vegetables whatever. I guess they should observe how an Asian restaurant in Asia works on this matter. The quantity is not much, either. They should at least offer more noodles or rice with very low cost or even no cost for people to choose. These things are cheap.But anyway, for stir-fries, they are actually comparable or even slightly better than most American-Asian in Hoboken regarding to flavor, probably much better regarding to raw material freshness, and light-year better regarding to branding and marketing. Of course they are more expensive, too.
2017-06-26,1,I've been going here for a while now and have had mixed experiences. But today is by far the worst I've had in terms of quality control. I ordered the Sweet Soy Five Spice with double protein and it came out with less than a normal portion of protein and way undercooked. They didn't even add all the garnishes I asked for. I feel like I keep going back and they find new ways to stiff me. Retrain your cooks or you're going to lose your customer base.
2017-06-11,4,Awesome build your own salad/noodle restaurant. Do it yourself order station so you dont get the pressure of trying to figure what to put in it when you get to cashier. Super fresh ingredients and definitely worth  the typical long wait.
2017-06-09,4,Honey grow is so delicious and healthy. They have a super simple ordering experience where you explore the menu on a touchscreen computer. They have juices, yogurt parfaits, stir fry, and salads. I got the spicy garlic stir fry bowl which had chicken, egg white noodles, pepper, broccoli, pineapple, onion, parsley, and spicy garlic sauce. It was so good but extremely spicy! If you don't like spicy I would definitely steer clear on any that notes it on the menu- it's definitely above a medium spice. They have lots of seating, both indoor and outdoor, and offer a water cup which I've come to appreciate. Lastly, they clearly note all diet restrictions on every order. Would recommend if you need a quick and easy bite!
2017-06-05,4,I come here 2-4 times a week- A great healthy option in Hoboken that is close to my gym and apartment. The touch screen ordering pads are super convenient and make it easy to customize your salad or stir fry. I mostly get salads, and they have a ton of veggie options to make an actual healthy salad (or a not so healthy delicious one if that's what you're in the mood for).My only complaint is the crowded pick up area and service speed. Some days I am waiting for over ten minutes, packed in the front of the place like sardines with the other people waiting, while the workers talk to each other and salads sit behind the counter, with no one making an effort to serve them out. I know this is mostly due to the rush of lunch/dinner, and they're working on speeding this up with their order number board, but it's been a constant issue even during the non-busy hours.   That said, I will still keep going back on a weekly basis. I wish they had a rewards system so I could capitalize a bit on the hundreds of salads I've bought so far!
2017-06-03,4,Honeygrow, where have you been all my life? Please open up a location in Downtown Jersey City! We desperately need your salad options here. Stopped in at your Hoboken location with my fiancée today, and our salads were great. We'll be back tomorrow for more deliciousness.
2017-05-31,4,A Hoboken Staple! Healthy, clean, quick and easy - Honeygrow is perfect for a quick and healthy meal. My favorite is their salads, their stir fry is good too but I prefer their salads. I usually make my own salad with romaine, grilled chicken, cucumbers, beets, pickled peppers and their white balsamic vinaigrette - which is absolutely amazing! A few minutes from the Hoboken Station its a great stop on your way home from work.
2017-05-19,4,I got the sesame garlic bowl which features creekstone beef. Honestly it's not as flavorful as I thought it was gonna be. But it tasted fresh and rather healthy! The best part for me was the fact that they use creekstone. As a Muslim that's clutch!
2017-04-28,3,I love this place... it gets pretty packed but the service is timely. The food is good though I wouldn't recommend the tuna (it taste like it's straight from a can). I usually get the salad with tofu and shiracha dressing. The vegetables are fresh. I would've given this a 4-5 star review however they got rid of their Brussels sprouts and roasted yams on the menu options.
2017-04-24,2,I just paid $16 for an Arugula/Tuna salad and when I get home and open theres no tuna in it. And very little of each topping, is basically arugula, radishes and dressing. This was my 3rd time giving it a try, but each time it got worse, last time my noodles choice didn't have the mushrooms I paid for. The concept is great but the people that prepare your meal need more training.
2017-04-21,3,I've been to this place twice first time was very good second time the chicken didn't taste good . There's a lot of young kids working here they're so loud and rowdy ... the second time I came here I was watching a young lady handle my food she looked like she didn't want to be there she kept rushing and throwing stuff . Then I seen a young man handle my brown rice with  ( NO GLOVES ON ) I know that's not sanitary.......... He seen me watch him the entire time he did it and turned around quickly ..... people at this place weren't taking their job seriously...
2017-04-20,4,It was good for some salads, but few of them are completely not tasty. Have to choose sauce carefully, Not every combination is great.
2017-04-13,4,Food: 1 starsDecor:3 starsHoneyGrow ..or HoneyNO that is the question?   The inner hipster in me wants to love this place, but be fooled not by the fancy decor. I do love the touch screen pads that you use to place the order especially if you're slow to order like me there's no pressure to choose something. The building is beautiful its simple but yet fab at the same time. To me it was an upscale McDonalds. The workers were very very meh except one young lady she was very nice. I was asking questions about the sauces and she let me try them I thought that was nice. She was the only one who wore a smile.  Even the cashier attendant who just called out the numbers of the orders like a drill sergeant. So maybe all of that influenced the overall taste of my food.  As far as the food goes it could use some work. Just because its vegetarian doesn't mean it should lack flavor. I got the stir fry noodles with egg and spinach and chicken.  The noodles were great the spinach was great, the chicken is another story. I was sold on the idea that this is all organic or farm raised . from farm to plate type thing. But just because its organic doesn't mean it has to lack flavor. I wanted something super quick and light that is what I got essentially but I wish it had more flavor. The chicken really reminded me of that chicken from subway G R O S S.
2017-04-11,5,Honeygrow is a frequent stop for me, and I think my boyfriend would eat here every single day if he could! The menu offers a bunch of salads and stir fries that sound pretty great as described, but it's also super easy to modify any of the offered items to your liking OR create your own (customers create their orders manually on a very user-friendly computer). My go-to is the sweet soy five spice stir fry, modified to replace spiced turkey with chicken and rice with egg white noodles, but when I'm feeling reckless I opt for the spicy garlic stir fry (which is pretty damn spicy but very worth it). I love these two stir fries so much that even though I would like to try other items on the menu, I can't bring myself to deviate! Fast ordering, efficient service, affordable menu, and consistently delicious healthy options? Five stars for Honeygrow!
2017-04-05,5,I have a friend visiting from out of town and she stopped by and ordered a salad for lunch. She loved it so much that she went back later to get another salad for dinner. Seeing her salad and hearing how good it was made me want to go. I ordered the Spring Thai'm salad and it was absolutely delicious! Everything was perfectly made and definitely hit the spot. The staff are also very friendly and all had smiles on their faces.I've always enjoy eating from here. The portions are enough for me to have two meals out of them. I usually get noodles, which always hit the spot.
2017-04-01,5,Super fresh food! I love the simplicity of ordering your food on the iPads and customizing however you want. I just wish they delivered!
2017-03-26,5,If you're looking for a solid salad in Hoboken, this is your spot. It's take out or dine in, and on non-peek hours its fast. On peek hours you'll wait a little but nothing too bad. The salads are all customizable or preset recipes which can be edited. It's all done on a touch screen which is pretty effective. The ingredients are hearty and quality, with a large selection of options. They also specialize in stir fry which is great, never been disappointed. Again you can customize or get a preset recipe. And the root beer, it's the best I've had - worth a try. Really not sure why this isn't 4+ star right now, people in Hoboken complain about EVERYTHING it seems... And they drop 1 star bombs if anything goes wrong - get real people. One thing I will say is that they should offer some free foccacia bread with the salad, it would be a nice touch.
2017-03-25,3,Quality has gone down in recent months. Twice received brown avocado in a salad (that I paid extra for) and another time, they forgot chicken (that I paid extra for).
2017-03-16,5,I wouldn't keep coming back if this place wasn't delicious! I started coming to Honeygrow in Hoboken when it first opened in q4 of 2015. First impression was amazing- with touch screen menus, assortment of tasty yet healthy options, and a friendly staff were all there from the very beginning. Now that it has been almost a year and a half, I'm not surprised in the slightest at the success this eatery has achieved!Honeygrow is by far one of the more popular lunch/dinner places on Washington Street, given it's optimal location, and fast/reliable service. Although the place can be crowded from time to time, the line is usually pretty quick, and most people do take out so there is plenty of space to sit. The wooden tables and chairs are a nice touch, and really gives the place a lot of personality. I've tried just about every combination of stir fry imaginable and they are yummy! The portion is pretty reasonable and not overpriced. The staff is incredibly friendly- they even offer to take your tray from the table when you finish eating.To summarize, Hoboken is happy that the Philly native has come to town!
2017-03-07,4,My boyfriend picked up salads last Friday for dinner and they were great! We plan on doing the same thing this weekend because they were just what we wanted. Instead of getting pizza delivered or dining out, we decided to keep it light (so we could go HAM on Saturday nights and not feel so guilty, duh) and try out honeygrow. Exactly what we were looking for! I enjoyed the "make it grain salad" added on cucumbers and chicken! Mmmmm!
2017-02-04,4,I love it here been here three times already. You order your salad on the tablet like screen they have and then pay but the cashier once it's finished. I can't say specifically what I eat there because im always switching it up.The salad is fresh,some of the workers are very helpful and others eh. There's indoor and outdoor seating.
2017-01-22,2,Very disappointed in Honeygrow. I used to love coming here as it was a good healthy and quick option in town. I came here yesterday to pick up a salad and honey bar. With the salad, the person making it couldn't find the correct salad dressing. After taking a few minutes to rummage around she took a to go salad dressing container and dumped it on my salad. It was not the right dressing. If they did not have the proper salad dressing they could have let me know so I could choose a new one instead of them dumping a random dressing on it to complete the order. Unfortunately by the time I realized it was not the correct dressing, I was already back home. In addition, with the honey bar, they must of mixed my order up with someone else's. I paid extra to have yogurt and extra fruit/toppings and the honey bar I received was nowhere close to what I ordered. Honeygrow needs to properly train their employees because every time I give Honeygrow another chance they mess up time and time again. This restaurant has potential but it's unfortunate that the employees can't seem to get orders right.
2017-01-19,1,Do not walk, RUN! I do not know how this place is still in business. The place is such a scam, you think you're eating healthy but all of the food is filled with oil and chemicals you can taste it. It's completely disgusting and the staff is unfriendly and not accommodating. I was so excited to have a healthy food destination in the area, but I am honestly disappointed to the point where I will never return. I'd rather eat at Mcdonalds. Overpriced.
2017-01-15,5,This place is a regular for me because of all the healthy choices ..  the local ingredients are awesome ..
2016-12-29,5,I absolutely love this place. Starting with the convenience of being able to customize your meal on the computer without the pressure of being in a line and talking about what you want. I also love how they recommend 4-5 speciality salads/stir frys with the option to tweak those or build your own. I like the fact they give you recommendations that they know they do really well instead of you only having the option to build your own. I have been 3 times and tweaked the Cobb salad options with the peppery ranch dressing and it has been superb. When I ordered for here one time, the employees were very nice asking around if I needed anything and they delivered me an extra sauce free of charge so I didn't have to go to the front and ask for it myself. Definitely going to make this a regular spot!
2016-12-12,5,I just want to say that this places rocks.  One of my co workers kept telling about this place and how great it is so I decided to give it a try.  I went to honeygrow this past Tuesday for the first time and I could not believe how busy it was for lunch.  The kios was a little confusing at first but once i got the hang of it, it was easy.   What amazed me even more was that you did not see the staff panic on how busy they where.  Most places would panic when it get that busy but your staff stayed calm.  When I got to my office and tried my spicy garlic stir fry it was great.  I'm definitely going back to try the rest of the stir fry
2016-12-11,3,Always on the lookout for healthier dining options, I was intrigued by honeygrow while walking around late one night in Hoboken. The setup of the place and ordering process is convenient for sure, but the place didn't quite connect for me in the way that I was hoping. The food, while definitely more health-concious than other washington street establishments, was on the bland side for me and the smoothie I ordered was a regrettable selection. This was made all the more unpalatable by the amount of money I paid for the late night dinner. Honeygrow has the potential to be much better than it currently is but for now isn't a terrible alternative to healthy eating when you're dining away from home.
2016-12-02,1,I usually love eating here and was craving it badly.  This place is way out of my way in Hoboken when I live on the other side of Jersey city, opposite side of JC/ Hoboken border.  I ordered my food to go, drove home, took a couple bites to find it was beef and not tofu.  I have been a vegetarian for four years and had to give up beef even before becoming vegetarian since beef started making me violently ill.  I called Honeygrow to let them know I was coming back for the correct order, they had my order number and I told them which order was mine (since there were two stir fries on the receipt).  When I made it back to the restaurant, my stir fry had not even been started.  I received no apology.  Not only was I already very hungry, but having to drive the 15-20 minutes in traffic each way, and having beef in my mouth was very upsetting.  I'm not sure I can bring myself to come back again. Every single business needs to remember the value of a lifetime customer.
2016-11-28,1,I really really loved this spot...until tonight. I came home with my take out and as I was eating I began to choke. Not in a dangerous way thank goodness, but something was definitely stuck in my throat. And it was a looooooong hair that I had to pull and cough up. I was so disgusted I got sick on the spot. Even if I wanted to,  I could never ever go back there without feeling ill because of my experience there tonight.
2016-11-21,4,So glad honeygrow finally made it to this area from Philly.  I'm a big salad person and they are the best in the area.  It helps to familiarize yourself with the menu/ingredients before you go or experiment a few times, because everything can be customized, that's one of the reasons they are so great.  The other is that the ingredients are really fresh and wholesome.  They are a little pricey, but good quality ingredients cost more and portions are more than enough.  Glad to see honeygrown is continuing to expand their market.  Great alternative for "fast food"!
2016-11-14,5,Very good, affordable lunch option on Washington. It can get pretty packed during the lunch hour rush so keep in mind you may have to wait.
2016-11-14,5,Being gluten free is a struggle wherever you go; however, Honeygrow is a great place to go. I've been there twice already and don't have any complaints. Both time I've ordered the custom stir fry. The first time I got rice noodles with shrimp, broccoli, parsley, cilantro, and spicy garlic sauce. The spicy garlic sauce is delicious, but truly spicy. They also have gluten free soy sauce which is a bonus. The downside to my delicious meal was that there were only 3 shrimps in the whole $12 bowl.  After that, I learned my lesson and got vegetables only for around $10. I got the same thing and thoroughly enjoyed it. Ordering is simple and efficient as you select your food on a touch screen desktop and pay with credit there or take your receipt then go to the cashier and pay with cash which is also where you pick up your food. When I was waiting for my order, I heard a man tell the cashier he had an allergy and the cashier immediately notified all the staff. If you're gluten free, have allergies or have any diet restrictions, they're extremely accommodating and everything is labeled.Honeygrow provides a large portion and has a nice atmosphere. It's great for friends or for a laid back date. Their sodas are all natural and the two times I had them, they weren't bad. I had the natural lemonade the first time which was perfect, but the second wasn't sweetened enough. They have many healthy options which I plan to try down the line.
2016-11-10,3,Healthy, pricey, bland.I've been here 5 or 6 times to try the salads.  I like the idea - healthy, organic salads prepared as quickly as other 'fast' food.  The salads have been decent, but not great.  Here's where they can improve:-A single portion of protein (chicken or shrimp) is small, probably only 2 or 3 ounces.  If that's not enough to satisfy you, you'll have to go with a double portion, at extra cost.  -Price:  if you go double protein, expect a salad and drink to run $15 - $16.  For what you're getting, that seems high.-Flavor:  I've tried many different salads here, many different ingredients, dressings, etc., and most combinations have been bland.  So tomatoes don't have much tomato flavor, the chicken has very little chicken flavor, etc.  Even ingredients that should normally be bold and assertively flavored (blue cheese, onions, etc.) are somehow lacking.  Honeygrow is a chain, and it seems they've focus-grouped their flavors to aim for the lowest common denominator.  That is, they've made everything mild, so as not to turn off customers with more sensitive palates.  Even the dressings, which are there mainly to add flavor, are mild.  -Dressings:  Lots of choices, but too many closely-overlapping ones.  So they've got a balsamic vinaigrette.  Also a white balsamic vinaigrette.  Also a cider vinaigrette, etc.  That would be OK if each one had a distinct flavor, but they don't.  They're so mildly-flavored, it's hard to discern differences between them.  Honestly, most bottled dressings you'd buy at the store pack more flavor than these.  (Protip:  the one non-mild choice is the sriracha one.  Go for that if you like actually tasting things.) -Ingredient segregation limits choices:  Honeygrow makes two things:  salads and stir-frys.  But for some reason, ingredients that are used in the stir-frys aren't available to be added to the salads.  Green beans, jalapeños, shredded pork, etc. can go in the frys, but not the salads.  Mr. Honeygrow, tear down this wall!Honeygrow, if you're listening, this is a decent start, but you've got room to improve.  Make these changes and you'll earn . . . my coveted fourth star!  (Cue: crickets chirping . . . )
2016-11-09,4,Love this place. We've been going since the week it was opened and all in all it continues to be a great alternative eating place to the many other "less-then-healthy" choices in the area. All the site fry options are great, I'm a personal fan of the Cherry BBQ and/or Spicy Garlic sauce. The opportunities to try a new dish and create one are endless. It's fun to mix and match ingredients and find out what works best. It can be a little pricier but you'll never leave hungry. The ingredients are fresh, the food is tasty and it's served relatively fast.
2016-10-25,4,I did the build your own and chose the spicy garlic stir fry with chicken, shrimp, spinach, broccoli, carrots & parsley. I also added in fried shallots which were a great add on for me because it had a bacon like texture (I love bacon!). Personally, I could have used a little salt or another spice to kick it up a bit but, otherwise, it was awesome.
2016-10-20,3,Honey grow definitely cleaned up their act in terms of the amount of ingredients they serve in their custom salads however... I walked in tonight to order stir fry and inquired about their missing rice option.. the girl I initially spoke to said they'd be cooking more rice and would let me know how long it would take.. then another girl approaches me and rather loudly yells "you're going to NEED to choose another option because we're out of rice". Ok, seriously? Why could you have not just told me? I'm trying to give you my business and that's the way you speak to me? I'm asking about rice. This isn't life or death. Screaming at me seems a little absurd.
2016-10-18,5,First night in Hoboken, I wanted something healthy and light. Loved the ordering process which was fast and smooth. The enormous customized fresh Cobb salad was a whopping $12. And to cement the five stars someone came out to the dining room to ask if everything was to my satisfaction, chatted a bit and offered me a glass of iced water. Great place and concept.
2016-10-16,4,We go to honeygrow so much that many in the staff recognize us.  The food is fresh, local and well combined.  You can order straight off the menu, modify their menu or creat your own.  The flexibility is great. Most nights we get a salad and a stir-fry - our favorite is the philly roast, which we swap the pork out for shrimp.  The honeybar is also nice and healthy treat.
2016-10-13,4,Our new go-to for an easy, tasty, fast and healthy(ish) meal! The red coconut curry (aka red coco aka I'm in love with the coco) is absolutely delicious!! I've tried a few of the other stir fries but this has been my favorite sauce. I recommend adding the spiced turkey as the protein instead of the tofu (unless you're vegan/vegetarian of course). Philly roast pork stir fry is also great if you're in a pork and cheese kind of mood! Two cons:1. They serve the hot stir fries in plastic bowls if you eat in. Really?? With the whole modern take on local fusion food with wood and sustainable tables/chairs, you serve in plastic bowls? I do not eat anything hot out of plastic as a rule of thumb so this was pretty disappointing. I usually do take out for this reason.2. The topping amounts are not consistent. Sometimes I get 2 pieces of broccoli, other times I get 10. To be clear, I'd prefer 10. :) When they get stingy with the toppings, it becomes just a bowl of noodles/rice...not so fun, and the inconsistency becomes quite disappointing.
2016-10-10,5,This place is great. Fresh food, great helpful and friendly staff always. I love the ordering process, touch screen monitors that are easy to use and see. Other vendors should implement them too. I love the chicken stir fry with brown rice and sesame sauce. Try the honey bar with pineapple, strawberry and bananas. Top off with coconut, choc chips and the dark honey. You're welcome :)
2016-09-23,2,The quality has really gone down since it opened.  The noodles in my stirfry have been chewy the last 3x and there is so much sauce in my order tonight that it is inedible. There are also often employees walking around on the floor reaching over counters and eating over counters. It's really gross and points to inexperienced management.
2016-09-22,4,I lived in Philly for several years and that is where my addiction for HoneyGrow started.  It has the best concept which is fast, fresh, healthy, and LOCAL food.  When I moved from Philly to NYC I was slightly devastated that I was no longer within blocks of Honeygrow. I remember when they announced they were opening one in Hoboken I was so excited that they would be closer. Yesterday I decided to venture out the city to give the Hoboken location a try.  I must say it is easy to get to from the Lower Manhattan via the PATH train. And only about a 5 min walk from the Hoboken train stop.The establishment has that modern look incorporating wood as well like many other locations.  They have outdoor seating which is great for nice evenings.  They have 4 kiosk to select your food and that evening a small line was forming to order around 7ish.  I ordered my regular spicy garlic stir fry and adding in shrimp as well.  It took a little less than 10 minutes for my food to be ready.  Once I received my food it looked amazing at first sight, but then I noticed that the noodles were undercooked and clumping together.  On top of that they went very light on the sauce which made for a rather dry entree.  At this point I am tired and hungry from a long day I just ate it as is.  My meal with my bottle of water was about $16.  They didn't knock my socks off as I PRAYED they would. Will I give it another try? Probably will but I know to ask for extra sauce and to tell them about how I want my noodles.
2016-09-15,4,I consider myself to be a pretty healthy eater. At the same time I also happen to live in Hoboken, a land where Italian and American cuisines rule. It might be surprising to some, but those two do not tend to offer many healthy dishes so I would often dream of a local establishment that could offer something else. While there are a few businesses, most of whom have closed by now, who promised a healthier option they were either tasteless or had awful customer service.When I saw that this location was under construction, it happened to mention the name of the place and when I looked it up I was very excited to find out that Hoboken was finally going to have a healthy food option that also seemed appetizing. I kept checking on the progress of the construction and was there within the first week of them opening.The service: when they first opened, people greeted you by the door and gave you the menu while you were waiting in line (and there was quite a line). Everyone working there was very friendly and was obviously trained well. While the greetings have subsided, I still find them to be very nice and do get the occasional greeting from time to time. Since you use a computer to place your order, the communication is somewhat limited as is. the food itself: I was very hesitant when I tried my first dish from them as I had such high hopes and was all too used to the disappointment. However, it was excellent! It was hard to believe that what I was eating was actually (well, mostly) healthy. Full of flavor and the serving size is enough for me to split into two meals. I also like how one can customize it, I usually get either the spicy garlic or the sweet soy spice five stir fries and substitute the meat for tofu.the price: Very reasonable considering what you are getting.The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because the tofu has been inconsistent and overcooked on a few occasions. Also, do expect a reasonable wait for stir fries. Otherwise, I really do love it and hope it stays for a while
2016-09-14,5,So amazing, delicious, healthy and helpful staff!  This will be my new lunch spot!!  Touch order screen, which makes it super easy to order.  Was crowded, but the salad was ready very quickly and thy even helped me to my table because I was with my toddler.
2016-08-31,5,Very fond, great food. You'll pay a bit of a premium, for the location. But, you won't be disappointed by portions or quality.
2016-08-31,4,Ohhh Honeygrow, how I love you. Actually, it's love/hate because of how expensive you can get, but I understand there's a price to pay for fresh quality ingredients. This is my go-to lunch spot in the area. There was a time when I used to come here 2-3 times a week, but now that I am exploring more in Hoboken, I've brought this number down to once every other week or so. Still, when I'm craving custom salads or stir-fry, there is no better place than Honeygrow to satisfy my palate. I ALWAYS get the same thing here. Custom stir-fry with chicken, egg white noodles, peppers, bean sprouts, chili flakes and sesame seeds, with sesame garlic sauce (less sauce). I don't know why but I loved this combo so much that I never bothered to try anything else. I've heard EVERYTHING here is good though, so you really can't go wrong.The key to this place is arriving BEFORE lunch time. When there's no line, you'll be in and out within 10-15 minutes, but if you wait until peak lunch time, there's no telling how long it will take. It's also not very cheap, so try choosing a combo that you like, and prioritize the toppings that matter to you most. Customize to your heart's content! Order takeout and take your yummy lunch over to the pier and enjoy the nice view while you eat.
2016-08-17,4,They get 5 stars for service. Great staff! Noodle stirfries are loaded with too many noodles. Their salads are yum!
2016-08-14,4,I love this place!  A little pricey for what you get, but I suppose it's all fresh so perhaps it's reasonable.  I'll be coming here more often.
2016-08-09,5,I came in to Honeygrow when it wasn't busy. I had ordered from the kiosk but none of the workers began working on my order. It didn't take too long, but my order was eventually ready and a couple of the workers apologized. I was presently surprised when one of the managers, Angelo, came over to apologize. He then gave me a free smoothie and offered me a discount on my next visit. I don't normally write reviews but I felt it was important to share what awesome management and staff they have working there. Talk about customer service. Will be back :)
2016-08-03,3,Great idea, however they need to improve the execution.I typically order a salad or stir-fry.  I love the idea of their fresh, natural, veggie centered menu. However, the dressing/sauce is always too little or too much.  They can never seem to get a consistent product.The good thing is their Honeybar, where you can get fresh fruit with honey and their amazing whipped cream.
2016-07-31,4,Reasonably priced, relatively healthy option in the area.We come by fairly often and typically order the noodle option, and we find the food to be fairly filling and tasty, filled with fresh ingredients. The amount of other ingredients put in the box is sometimes inconsistent (so we check all the time before we walk out to make sure the box is filled with food), but it's otherwise consistently flavorful and fairly priced quick dinner option.
2016-07-28,5,I con only say great things about this place!  I love the touch screens where you can customize exactly what you want.  I needed a gluten free, dairy free meal and the ingredients showed clearly what to choose to be safe.  I got the cherry sour BBQ sauce with brown rice and tons of veggies.  It was great and so steamy.  My wife got the cane sugar root beer that tasted amazing.  My only complaint would be that it was just too cold in there, but that is minor.  Also, you could watch them make your food, so that is great.  And the back room behind the bathrooms, I found a wall outlet to charge my phone!   Finally, if you live in Manhattan, it is not far, we took the PATH rail and it was only $2.75 one way and only took about 20 minutes to get there, then a few blocks to the restaurant.  Then, you can go down the street to Carlo's Bakery for dessert!
2016-07-22,5,Great, friendly service! One of the workers named Shantel was super nice and helped make sure I was satisfied with my order. Will definitely eat there again!
2016-07-22,5,Love this place, come here all the time for salad, always fresh and yummy. The staff is also really helpful and friendly, Shontell Jones in particular was super sweet and helpful. Definitely coming back!
2016-07-22,5,Love this place, food is fresh, staff are friend, thanks shantelle your a great ambassador for honey grow
2016-07-22,5,The deliver what they say, the food is fresh and delicious. It was super easy to order using the kiosk and with the create your own menu, the options for food are limitless. I haven't tried the honey bar just yet and it is def on my list for next time! This place is perfect for good, healthy and well resourced eats in Hoboken!
2016-07-22,4,*review for salads only*i come to honeygrow at least once a week - it's the only place in hoboken you can get a good make-your-own, quick salad.  quality is pretty consistent, ingredients are always fresh and the service is accommodating and friendly.  only complaint about the staff is sometimes they are super slow and it's frustrating to watch - some of them look like they don't know what the word salad even means. but if ever you feel you don't have enough of an ingredient they are fast to fix it! overall great spot for fresh, delicious salad :)if anyone wants to copy my make-my-own, it's pretty great (spring mix, arugula, tomato, avocado, cucumber, chicken, pumpernickel croutons, and mustard soy vinaigrette).
2016-07-18,4,The salad I got was delicious and enough to supply 2 meals! The ingredients were fresh and combined well. I only demoted a star because my bread that I paid extra for was forgotten. Just make sure to check your bag before you leave
2016-07-15,2,Have gone here three times and each time they have messed up my order, and charged me for salad add-ins that they didn't give me. Wish it were better, because three aren't many good salad places in Hoboken.
2016-07-13,5,Shantal was such an amazing server, she was so sweet and nice and always tending to our needs and providing whatever we needed. Thank you so much!!!!
2016-07-11,5,Always have a fabulous experience, food is fresh, healthy and served with a smile.  Place is very clean. Shantelle took extra great care of me tonight, checking in to see if my drink needed a refill or if I wanted more dressing. Highly recommend!
2016-07-10,4,They somehow make Cobb salad not boring and delicious! Cool and clean restaurant. Only giving it 4 stars because the wait can get a little crazy around lunch time.
2016-07-10,5,I just moved to Hoboken last month, and Honeygrow has already become the go-to spot for me and my cousin. Aside from the food, which taste fresh, healthy, and delicious, the hospitality is unbelievably warm, especially for a "chain" restaurant. Darnell runs the kitchen with amazing efficiency, and I'm always impressed by his positive energy. In addition, Shantel has an incredible attitude- she always greets us with a huge smile, and it's a major reason we keep coming back. Thanks so much to Shantel, Darnell, and the rest of the team. You guys are amazing!
2016-07-10,4,I seriously love this place, as it's an easy go to at for relatively healthy food in Hoboken. Also the staff, particularly Shantel Jones, are super nice. I'm always greeted at the door, and tonight Shantel was amazing following up on my questions about my order and even bringing me water! With service like that, I'll be coming and dining in more often. Thank you, Shantel!
2016-07-02,5,Absolutely delicious! Pick something... Anything... Sure to delight. Staff is very friendly & helpful.
2016-06-29,2,First time I tried honegrow, there was way to much sauce in the noodles. Just tried a green smoothie today, took a few sips and then grabbed a piece of plastic from my mouth. Disgusting!
2016-06-29,5,Had a delicious and FRESH meal at Honeygrow during my visit to Hoboken. I had a salad and my friend had a stir-fry. Ordering on the screen was a bit intimidating at first, but I was happy to have a healthy, local, 100% customizable meal. Definitely check it out!
2016-06-28,2,First time ordering from this place. I was excited, and really wanted to like it! I ordered the Red Coconut Curry, as is. Sadly, there was just no flavor. I completely agree with another reviewer who said it was more of a "coconut curry was here" vibe. The dish was also very noodle heavy, seriously lacking in veggies. It was basically a carton of dry, flavorless noodles with a few tofu and pineapple chunks thrown in. My boyfriend tried the Philly Roast Pork - another disappointment, loaded with an absurd amount of pepper and very little flavor otherwise. And this is coming from someone who loves spicy food. Woeful.We may go back once more to try the salads, but until then, honeygrow gets a firm two stars. Another mediocre Hoboken restaurant added to a long list of the same.
2016-06-28,2,first time eating here and ordered the Philly Roast pork stir fry which had zero flavor and was absurdly spicey hot. added some sweet baby rays BBQ sauce to it so I could finish eating it. really bad.
2016-06-26,5,This is probably my favorite lunch spot in Hoboken. We work on River street and probably come here once or twice a week.Hands down the best custom salads in the area. The ingredients are always super fresh, the staff is super considerate (they always double and triple check to ensure your salad has all the ordered items in it), and the ordering computer system is cool and helps to expedite the line, as it does get crowded around lunch time. Food favorites: I always customize what I eat, but I usually opt for arugula with the sesame soy dressing, or a stir fry with egg white noodles and veggies with garlic soy teriyaki. Beverages are a little pricey, but they have cups by the soda machine for water. So beyond glad that Hoboken has this neighborhood gem!!
2016-06-13,5,Great Food! Healthy options and portions and Delicious too! The stir fries are great! I highly recommend for a good lunch or a light dinner! Ordering on a screen seems intimidating at first but it was very user-friendly and pretty cool too. It allows you to see exactly what you're getting and easily customize it if you want to substitute or add anything!
2016-06-07,5,Had a great first experience here! Jason helped me figure out how to order and find gluten free options! I got rice noodles, beef, shrimp, green peppers, spinach, and it was delish!!!!! Tasted healthy and yet still filling! I will be back!
2016-06-07,5,I checked out Honeygrow on a weekday while visiting my friend in Hoboken. I got a Cobb salad and it was somehow amazingly good!! It was fresh! Lots of avocado, chicken, egg! I thought it would be an average salad, but it was even better!! It was around 1pm, so the restaurant was full of moms, people taking their lunch breaks, etc, but I still got my food pretty quickly! The one downside was that the smoothie wasn't completely smooth and I could chew on some of the greens in it. They have descriptions throughout the restaurant about how they are environmentally friendly which is always a plus!I highly recommend Honeygrow!
2016-06-05,3,Good fresh food that you can custom to your preference and great customer service. Staff really looks out for every customer.Adrian is really friendly.
2016-05-29,5,This is the only GOOD salad spot in the area. We need more like this in town! It's a dollar or two more than I usually want to spend for a salad, especially outside of Manhattan, but everything is fresh and delicious.
2016-05-29,3,Just got home from the place, and once again they forgotten to add protein to the salad.
2016-05-20,2,Please bring back the real eggs for the stir fry.  I'm a vegetarian and the egg was the main protein I could have but since it's been changed to a pre-cooked "fake" egg, it's really mushy and gross and not something I'll ever eat in the future.
2016-05-11,4,I have been to Honeygrow in Hoboken about a dozen times now.  Each and every time I go my order is the same which is a good thing, consistency is key!  They have a large selection of  ingredients to choose from when you decided to make your own stir fry or salad, and everything is fresh and delicious.  One additional nice touch is the fountain soda is not your run of the mill coke or Pepsi they have cool choices I recommend trying the blueberry soda.  Yum!
2016-05-06,4,This place is pretty unique in Hoboken - you order at a kiosk sort of like what you'd find at Wawa, and you get to choose from a bunch of options for stirfry (and some other items). The food is great - very tasty and flavorful and moderately healthy. For build-your-own, you can get noodles, rice, or lettuce as a base, and then you build off of that with different ingredients and sauces. Otherwise, you can get one of the pre-set stirfry options, which I've opted for and are delicious. I've enjoyed every different sauce I've tried here, so don't be afraid to experiment! I also usually get the lettuce cups for a healthier option, rather than noodles or rice. It's still super tasty, so don't be afraid to try it out as well. The lettuce cup comes in a separate little container.Overall, I really enjoy the food here, although I do think it's slightly pricy for the amount of food you're getting. But it does fill you up just the right amount, and the ingredients are fresh and prepped and cooked well. The food is a little bit reminiscent of Chinese or Asian stirfry, so if you're into that, and you're looking for healthier or more customizable options, this is the place for you!Service is also good - you'd think that you don't interact with the staff much because all of your ordering is through the kiosk. But there's a staff member by the kiosks to help guide newcomers through the ordering process and to assist with any questions. I mean, the ordering process is pretty straightforward, but I like that they're friendly and there to greet you and help you if needed.
2016-05-05,4,Honeygrow has something for everyone.  I love the fact that you order on a screen, not with a person.  Sometimes it can be overwhelming to walk into a place that has SO many options and have to order with a person at the counter who is standing there waiting for you to make up your mind.  At honeygrow, you can take your time browsing the menu items on the iPad screen and building your own meal.  The food is always fresh and delicious, and portions are huge.  It gets a little crazy when it's crowded, and the waiting area is a little small and awkward, but that is expected at a place like this.  Prices are fair.  Overall an awesome place to pick up a healthy yet filling meal for lunch/dinner.
2016-04-22,3,I really wanted to love this place, but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be. The options for vegetarians were plentiful, however, the tofu was not seasoned well enough. I decided on a "build your own" stirfry with wheat noodles, veggies, and red curry sauce. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my preference and the flavor was underwhelming. I would be open to trying honeygrow again, but a different dish.
2016-04-17,4,Healthy and tasty! Also like the way of ordering food, especially you are not sure what to eat and what to add.
2016-04-16,4,I enjoy this place and mostly get salads, I'm a big fan of how the salad is thoroughly mixed so that dressing is generously and evenly dispersed throughout the greens- no dry leaves at the bottom! They are also generous with the chicken and toppings, however as far as comparable salad/prices go at similar places, this is on the pricy side. I ordered one of their readymade salads and it came out to $11 and it was regular sized, whereas I usually eat at just salad and their salads are around $9 and they are HUGE. Originally I had tried to make my own salad with no add one but it came out to be more expensive than the readymade salads. Overall a good experience, the freshness of the ingredients is noticeable
2016-04-13,5,I REALLY like this place. Every time I've eaten here I've had the whole wheat noodles with beef, edamame and kale (with the other ingredients varying each time). I could probably eat here once a week and not get sick of it. I really like that cherry barbecue sauce a lot too. And that garlic one . My only complaint is that they got rid of those candied cashews. What the hell, why would you get rid of those ?? Charge me extra if necessary but don't get rid of of them, damn.
2016-04-11,3,Love noodles so came here!! Concept is great, very clear and the decor is clean lines and cosy! That's the best bit about it. Sauces taste synthetic!!! The ingredients are good but was expecting a better flavour. No one knew the wifi password which I find pathetic! Like seriously?? I asked 3 people ..... Will maybe try one more time but not impressed!
2016-04-04,5,I went here a few months ago for the honeybar, but last night I finally went in for a sit-down dinner (not take-away). I chose to make my own salad- it ended up being DELICIOUS. I had green kale & organic baby spinach, with chicken, goat cheese, cucumbers, onions, apples, pumpkin seeds, and honey ginger vinaigrette dressing. I was nervous it wouldn't be big/filling enough for dinner or they wouldn't put enough chicken in- however, they put the perfect amount of each item in! I liked how the salad was basically mixed already so I didn't have to do much cutting up myself before eating. Not only was the salad great, but as my friend & I were eating, an employee came by to ask us how our meal was and if we needed anything. Around 10 minutes later, he again walked by and collected my tray since I was finished (it was nice not to have to throw it out myself!). Lastly, the price: a healthy, satisfying dinner for $10.40 is a great deal to me, especially compared to other Hoboken eateries. I will definitely be back!
2016-03-26,3,I wanna be able to give this place 5 stars but I just can't. I love that it's healthy locally grown food but the quality control is just terrible. Found pineapple in my stir fry that wasn't supposed to be there the first time. Then next time I got home to find they forgot my garnishes(which I paid for). The food is pretty good but just isn't consistent. Sometimes I get barely any sauce, sometimes I get a lot of sauce and each time I've been my stir fry isn't well mixed.
2016-03-23,3,I love the menu, concept, ingredients. Never have any complaints about quality. I would give this place 5 stars but, they almost always mess up my order. I usually order to go and bring it home and its extremely frustrating to get home and discover that the chicken, avocado or falafel is missing from my salad. One time I brought it back to have it fixed, another time I called but only received an apology, a third time I just sucked it up and ate the salad without the falafel.  I suggest ordering and eating there! And the honey ginger scallion dressing, yum!
2016-03-23,1,I want to like this place, but every time I come here the portions just keep getting smaller. I don't mind a small portion size, but the prices should be adequately adjusted to reflect the portions. I just paid $11 for a salad that only filled the bowl by 1/4 of its size. If I had purchased this size salad anywhere else (including in Manhattan) it would have cost $5 or $6. This is ridiculous.
2016-03-19,3,Finally had a chance to check out this place after eyeing it so long ago.  It's definitely a california style restaurant - all natural, locally sourced placed.  For vegetarians it's great because there are so many options which is great but flavorwise - it just fell short.  For the price, the quantity - you get a pretty large bowl of noodles (which I got in the stir fry form).  I did the make your own and didn't add any add'ons and it came to 9.75ish.  I had the organic tofu with bell peppers, red onions, and jalapenos garnished with parsley and candied cashews (must try) with spicy garlic sauce.  I had the flat rice noodles.  My fiance tried a pretty similar dish with round egg noodles and same sauce. For whatever reason, his seemed to be slightly more tasty.  Mine was almost missing some salt (adding some would definitely elevate the taste and I'm not a salt heavy eater either...).  Again, the entire dish was somewhat bland even with a spicy garlic sauce.Other areas to improve, the jalapenos were cut into huge round chunks - I love spicy food and I wouldn't even eat a jalapeno like that.  I would recommend trying the sauces before you get it just to make sure you want to commit.  One of the servers was helpful and let me try the red curry sauce which was too sweet for my taste.   Definitely try the sodas though - they are great!I probably won't be rushing to go back soon but probably will give it one more try in the future.
2016-03-17,4,Everyone should try something at HoneyGrow. HG has positioned itself in the perfect spot in the trendy "organic / free range / vegan " niche market. Better yet, its not just not banking on the trend, its providing great quality food, large portion sizes (I couldn't even finish half of my stir fry) for a super affordable prices.I stopped by for a quick lunch, and had a wonderful experience. The staff welcomed me, gave me helpful recommendations as to what to try (100% recommend the red coconut curry!!), and served me quickly. Even when waiting for my food it was an enjoyable experience because automatically, visually, it meets expectations. Very new, very minimalist, and very conscientious of the image it should hope to portray. Even the kiosk was appealing: everything is touchscreen, high tech, beautiful videos of Hoboken...and better yet, super easy to use. After finishing my meal and transferring it into a container to go, I ordered an extra stir fry for my boyfriend, two items from the honey bar (their fruit, honey desserts). Very great packaging for the stir fry: adorable chinese take out boxes. Why not five stars? I feel like HG has the potential to do so much more. My roommate is a vegan and what makes HG great and unique is that its definitely the only one of its kind in Hoboken: a cheap, tasty filling meal that tends to a broad range of dietary needs (health conscientious, vegan, vegetarian and gluten free--but don't worry, great tasty, meat options too!) What I would like to see would be greater portions of vegetables in the stir fry, have it served warmer (sadly, my rice noodles were a little cold), a colder drink (the kale smoothie was disappointingly lukewarm), and most definitely more options for smoothies. There are tons of options of vegetables smoothies which would be great because tons of times there are only juiced drinks or only fruit smoothies. Also, with the honey bar, as nit picky as this may sound, I would like to have contents mixed so that everything is equally coated in honey/coconut what have you, and I can enjoy all of the fruit at once. Also, possibly introducing seitan in addition to tofu would be a good idea for vegans! Overall, great experience and recommend to all!
2016-03-15,2,I never write reviews but really felt the need to write one this time. While I love the concept of Honeygrow, some of their meat definitely has a distinct aftertaste and it's absolutely horrible. The first time I went I got the make your own chicken stir-fry, and I thought it was delicious at first. After one of two bites, there was this really weird aftertaste with the chicken. I tried to force myself to eat thinking it's probably just me, but towards the end I couldn't do it anymore and just ended up eating around all the chicken. I really liked the rest of the food so the next few times I got the beef and it was great. Then I went another week for a beef stir fry and the aftertaste was there again. I got the chicken again tonight to give it another chance and the aftertaste is definitely there. It makes you want to stop eating the whole dish. I hope the owners or managers read this and help fix whatever is causing the aftertaste because everything else is really good. It's a shame!
2016-03-14,5,The first time I went to Honeygrow, I ordered a create-your-own salad, and to be honest, I was disappointed. I came back to try a stir fry and was very pleasantly surprised!! The lemon miso tahini dressing is my favorite, and I've been back another time since. Everything is super fresh,  health conscious and delicious, which can be hard to find when food is deemed "healthy". I love Honeygrow and I'm so glad I gave it another chance!
2016-03-12,3,I still love the concept but consistency has to be kept up. For today's order, the egg white noodles were a bit underdone. Also, I optioned for sliced jalapeños and there was an overload. I had to pick them out and I produced about a large fistful.  I like spice, but the veggies need to be reasonably balanced in each order or it's overwhelming. Spinach and mushrooms were a small portion compared to the peppers. Hopefully, my next visit brings it back up a star.
2016-03-01,4,This place was a lot of fun. You go up to a computer and pick out what kind of food bowl you want.  There are so many choices. The atmosphere is casual.
2016-02-29,5,Finally!!!..What a great place!  I Highly recommend Honeygrow!! Super healthy flavorful  noodle choices!
2016-02-18,3,I visit Honeygrow regularly for the convenience of ordering a fresh meal to-go that I can easily customize.  They have a wide selection of stir-fries and salads and you can pick and choose things you want to add or remove on their kiosks.  The salads are good, but never have a lot of protein in them.. I recommend ordering light dressing or dressing on the side because they tend to add way too much.  I like the lemon miso stir fry and the vegan kale salad (dressing is so good), but was really disappointed by the kaleatta that is a little slimy.  Ordering is easy, but during busy times you'll have to wait a while for your food.
2016-02-06,4,Boyfriend and I went in for dinner on a Saturday. Both got our own stir fry watch various mixins with sauce in the side. Everything was super fresh and yummy! Also ordered their kale smoothie which was not that great. Manager was kind enough to replace it with a really yummy blueberry soda and a gift card for future use. Will defiantly come back here!
2016-02-02,5,All natural ingredients, healthy and delicious!!! What's not to love? The ordering is simple. Huge touchscreen computer with easy navigation. Meals are all prepared to order and served super fast. It's well balanced and takes advantage of local farms to serve up fresh food.  I'm looking forward to trying out entire menu.
2016-01-24,2,I like this place and will return but I have been there 3 times and 2 out of three times the order was wrong - even though the order is taped to the container. Does this look like broccoli?  Yep, that's snow peas. I'll chalk it up to the fact they've only opened a month.
2016-01-20,5,This place is a much needed healthy (and fast) option amongst the taverns and pizza joints lining Washington St. I've only had the stir fry via the create-your-own on the touch screen, and I left feeling nourished as the ingredients are fresh, filling, and portioned properly. The staff is really friendly and the interior is clean and looks brandy new. This is the perfect place to grab a quick bite off the PATH after a long day that will leave you feeling better than pizza!
2016-01-17,5,Great place to get a quick salad or stir fry in Hoboken. I've been several times for both lunch and dinner. The ordering process is all electronic on touch screens but is pretty simple and easy to use. It is made to order so be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes once you place your order for it to be ready. Ingredients seem to be very fresh and tasty so overall good value for $10.
2016-01-16,1,I was really excited to finally try Honeygrow but I never got the chance. Since you can only order on the iPads, I had lots of questions about then menu (since I have celiac's and eat gluten free) but there was no one around to ask. When ordering one of their pre-selected stir-fry's it only said if the sauce was gluten free after you made a selection. When I tried to make my own there was no indication of gluten free options for the individual ingredients. I can't believe a place that has signs everywhere about being allergy friendly can't even write it on their menus or have someone there to assist.
2016-01-15,3,I have been here twice now - once for a stir-fry and once for a "honeybar" yogurt bowl. The first time I came in to order my yogurt bowl, they omitted the crushed candied cashews. This was even after double-checking (as I saw one or two messed up orders before mine). The cashier blatantly lied to me and said that "the cashews were at the bottom of the bowl". I remained skeptical, but was in a rush so trusted her word. Nope, not there. *Wave*The second order I placed here was for the sesame garlic stir-fry with egg white noodles, naturally raised beef, sugar snap peas, bell peppers, red onions, carrots, scallions, and I added fried shallots and cilantro (.45 cents extra for cilantro - come on). Generous portion, fresh ingredients, but the beef was not very flavorful. Overall, I was much more satisfied with the stir-fry than the yogurt bowl. I'm all for fresh and natural ingredients, but still, $15 for a stir-fry is a bit steep, especially since there wasn't enough meat in my order. I really do like the concept of Honeygrow and the kiosk system, but every time I come in here I find that there's about 15 people waiting in front of me, regardless of the time of day. It seems like the orders get backed up with the kiosk system and Honeygrow rarely has the manpower to keep up. The waiting area itself isn't exactly spacious, either. Pluses: Fresh, natural ingredients + variety in healthy menu options Minuses: long wait times + very expensive prices I'm willing to give Honeygrow another try, as I know they are a fairly new business to the Hoboken area. Maybe a salad will be simple enough next time.
2016-01-13,1,I've been to Honeygrow 3 times since it opened, and 2 out of the 3 times they forgot to add several items that I ordered as part of my stir fry or salad. Most of these were add-on items that I paid for, too. It wasn't even all that crowded when we went, so I can't chalk it up to the staff being extremely busy (and that's not even a sufficient reason in my mind). The items are on the order slip, all they have to do is go down the list. Very disappointing that they can't get the orders right when it's all spelled out for them. The food is actually pretty good but it's expensive, you have to wait for a long time in a very overheated and cramped space, and the place is ridiculously loud. I won't be going there again.
2016-01-11,4,I'm so happy Honeygrow opened a location in Hoboken because the town is desperately in need of healthier options (read: Hoboken has more than enough pizza and burger joints).  The ordering process for me has been simple, with the touch screen computer.  After submitting my order, I haven't waited longer than 5 to 10 minutes.  The food has been enjoyable as well (I've stuck with the stir fry).  Definitely recommend this place over other nearby options!
2016-01-09,2,I've been here a few times and I really wish it was better. The food overall is good but the system is HORRIBLE. They are understaffed and disorganized so customers were waiting for a takeout dish for 30-60 minutes. Once I realized there were 20 orders in front of me and I watched the speed of the salad maker I decided to cancel my order or I literally would have waited close to an hour. When I asked them if I could cancel it they said the computer system can't do a refund. The only option was a gift card....so I took the gift card and left. Maybe I can try again when it's not so busy? Need better management and more employees and would be more successful.
2016-01-09,3,So happy to have this place in Hoboken as the food is delicious and I love all the choices (especially the honeybar). My only complaint is the wait time for food, as I have waited 30+ minutes for a salad on multiple occasions now.  Hoping it is just because this location is new and they will figure it out!
2016-01-09,2,Two stars because the food is quite good but waited 50 minutes for a salad which just turned me off to the place -- who has time for that??
2016-01-08,5,I rode my bike over to hoboken just to check this place out... glad i did! healthy and tasty! I had the kale salad I highly recommend this place
2016-01-07,4,I'm a big fan! I really love the place - healthy, tasty, customizable, digital ordering, lots of vegetarian options. It's all right up my alley!My favorite is the vegan kale salad - I just add blue cheese and it's delicious every time! The red coconut curry noodles are really tasty too but a bit more of an indulgence for me.Deducted a star only because their system for getting food out is a little frustrating - most of the time, they seem to put food out in the order it was ordered (based on receipt number). This is really annoying to me because sometimes there are a lot more stir-fry dishes before my salad and since stir-fry takes longer to cook, I wait longer than necessary for my salad. There are a few times that I've thought I saw my salad sitting right next to the register and didn't say anything because I wasn't sure, but then was handed that salad 15 minutes later. PLEASE fix this, Honeygrow - it would be 5 stars if you do!
2016-01-07,3,This is my third time here. The idea is excellent and I love a good clean meal. The customization is awesome and I dig being able to order on a computer like you would at Wawa. My only complaint is the beef and chicken taste extremely processed. Like it was frozen for a year or something with tons of sodium. I'd be fives stars all day if they went with a higher quality meat.
2016-01-05,3,Came here while staying in the area and loved the concept of this place. Completely customizing my order was great and liked all the options they offered. We tried the Chicken Cobb Salad and Sesame Garlic Beef Stir Fry. We took it to go and when we got home, realized that both of our meals were lacking protein. I called Honeygrow to let them know and they said the next time we come in, to remind them to add the protein. I'm sorry, but when each and every ingredient is listed on the receipt, I expect it to be placed in my food. Both the salad and stir fry were a little bland, but we would be willing to give this place another shot. Just make sure everything is included before you leave with your order!
2015-12-30,3,Fresh ingredients, interesting choices. The Honeybar is cool with good ingredients but the honey isn't a strong enough selling point. A larger yogurt selection would make this more exciting. Great toppings though. Salad was your normal good quality salad. I would go back to try the stir fry. They forgot my dressing which was a pretty big bummer & I wasn't walking all the way back. Overall decent.
2015-12-23,3,I really really wanted to give this place 5-stars because the food is so delicious but the service and wait times were just too long. I've tried this place twice now both during the weekend after lunch times and both times i have waited over 15+ minutes for the food. I understand the stir-fry is made from scratch but even when it's not too crowded the wait times are just too long. If they add more staff to accommodate the orders this place would def be a regular for me.
2015-12-23,5,So happy to have farm to table as an option in Hoboken. Along with vegan and gluten free options. The pricing is appropriate for the size of portions. I always end up getting two meals out of it. Also, great location in Hoboken. Good space to unwind. The vibe is always laid back with good music. I love the local photographs too. A nice touch!
2015-12-19,3,I don't know.... I really really love this place compared to all the restaurants in this area... It's the only one of its kind-- (healthy and trendy) the layout and interior design is very appropriate with the overall mission of the place. Farm to table type service. And all self serve digital ordering. Cool! I've waited to write my review on this place because it was just so new... And I'm glad I waited. First time I went I tried the stir fry-- lemon miso. It was... Creamy and the noodles were prefect texture. But something in my dish tasted like.... Dirt or like mushroom fungus. Idk what it was but there was something in it that definitely did not taste fresh. My coworker tried the sesame stir fry and he said it was salty and mediocre. Second time I tried a honey bar. Fucking amazing. Jesus it's so good. The granola?!?! The maple yogurt?!?! To die for. Serious the best granola I've tried. The fruit can be a little better condition but overall the honey and the granola and yogurt really do it for me. Wish they had BIGGER sizes!! Hope the owners read this. Cause I would Definitely get the biggest size they offer.Third time I tried a salad-- made my own and it was AMAZING. It was just too small.. BUTTT they are definitely falling off with their "assembly line" quality. I had a vegetarian salad--just tofu no meat. And I had a SHRIMP IN MY SALAD?! Obviously doesn't belong there. And I also ordered my favorite thing on the menu the honey bar.. And in my honey bar I had two prices of spinach ?! Ummmmmmm why is that there....... Two words. Quality control. I get you guys are getting super busy. But the quality cannot start slacking already when you've only been open for 2 months maybe ?! Disappointed.
2015-12-18,4,Tried it for the first time last night and I was pretty impressed. They let you customize everything from the type of noodle you want to the garnishments on top. I got the egg white noodles with spicy tofu and garlic sauce and an assortment of veggies. Really really good, worth checking out. Prices are reasonable, quantity is solid as well.
2015-12-15,4,I really liked my spicy garlic stir fry bowl from here. Really tasty and a satisfying lunch with fresh ingredients. The green smoothie is also really nice and one of the cheaper things on the menu. I'm docking a star because the staff still seems a bit unorganized and there's always a long wait. Also, it's a bit pricey.
2015-12-11,4,What took you so long? Seriously! As if Hoboken, NJ isn't the ideal location for a "create your own salad" joint. When I lived/worked in NYC chopt was one of my favorite lunch spots and this imitation does not disappoint. Even better - the lack of human interaction necessary is awesome with a new baby. All you do to order is enter what you would like on a touch screen monitor at the front of the shop. You can specify how much dressing you'd like or if you'd like it on the side. If you're not into salad, they also offer stir fry. The average salad runs about $10, but they are very big. Can't wait to check it out again soon!
2015-12-04,1,I was really looking forward to going to Honeygrow but the meal I had was absolutely disgusting! My friend and I ate here today and both got sick after 2 bites.  The chicken and vegetables tasted days old and the egg noodles were super firm.I felt terrible throwing away a whole bowl of food but I couldn't give this sickening meal to a homeless person.  The 1 star goes to the friendly staff not to the food that was served there.
2015-12-04,4,I'm certainly a fan of Honeygrow! I came here on a Friday during the lunch rush not sure what to expect as it was my first time. I wound up ordering from the honeybar which was outstanding. Fresh and delicious. My cup was filled to the top, spilling over, and probably overstuffed by most standards, but to me the more the merrier!I also got a build your own salad. I felt there was the perfect amount of dressing, the salad was well-mixed and had a good amount of ingredients other than the lettuce.I paid just over $16 for my lunch, which is a little pricey in my opinion.I was a bit nervous that I would hold up the line with the touch-screens, and maybe I took a little longer since it was my first go at it, but overall I think if you're literate you can pretty much figure it out. Between the line to order and the line to get my food, I waited all of about five minutes.Clean place that I will certainly be paying a visit to again. A great option for lunch in Hoboken.
2015-12-02,4,Walking into this place and up the the registers to order was actually super fun! I thought I would hate not interacting with the staff, but ordering on these shiny screens only made me add more and spend more. The food was delish - I had the lemon miso tahini and piled on the noodles, veggies, chicken, etc. etc. and ended up with a $14+ stir fry bowl. Worth every penny. The place was clean, the staff were nice, and the music was pleasant. Now can you just open one up in JC please?!
2015-12-01,5,We ate at honeygrow on Friday for the first time.  The place was bright, clean and inviting.  I had the stir-fry with shrimp and wheat noodles, it was a nice serving and the it was delicious.  The staff was was very friendly and I saw them helping folks that had a little difficulty ordering their meals on the computer screens.  I like that you can place your order and pay for it all at the same time.  I would recommend it to everyone.
2015-11-30,1,Horrible !! I got take out the noodles were disgusting and dry !! They say organic but all I saw were rice noodles and green pepper in my stir fry!! I like to know where they buy their vegetables because it looked like they were your typical precut frozen vegetables you buy in the freezer section. Tasted like cardboard ... No flavor what so ever .Save your dough and choose else where.
2015-11-24,2,Usually love the stirfries here but decided to try their salad tonight. Got the signature salad with shrimp, egg white noodles, spinach, etc. Paid $11 and change for this and this is what I get. NOT worth the money since the salad girl clearly does not know how to fill the to-go container. SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!
2015-11-21,4,A great addition to Hoboken - healthy, fresh, quick food for dining in or taking out.Their menu consists of stir fries and salads - you can customize anything protein, veggies, noodles.  I like the fact that we have a healthier option now for nights we don't want to cook.
2015-11-13,3,Hoboken definitely needed a place like this especially with all the young, busy professionals who don't have time to cook. I love the concept of local and fresh ingredients of course, and how they are very transparent with everything that goes into the food. There's barely any human contact here. You order from an iPad which is easy to use. You're given a number on a receipt and they call you by number. You can watch to see how the food is made if you're into that. I like how I'm usually talking to an employee when my food is being prepared, so this is something new. The stir fry seems to be the more popular option here and everyone seems to like it. I'm not really a stir fry person so I went with the salad. They have their signature salads that you can order from and salads that you can choose what ingredients you want (this is cheaper). My salad came out to around $10 keeping ingredients to a minimum. I wasn't really impressed with the salad, I felt like the portion was small and the add ins were kinda skimpy, and the salad was not mixed well. So I suggest you stick with the stir-fry, which seems to be more their forte. The interior is really nice with tons of seating indoors and outdoors. The staff is very friendly and walks around to clean tables from plates & garbage when you're done eating. Overall, a nice addition to Hoboken.
2015-11-13,3,I like the concept but the stir fries are way too salty and over-sauced. Because of that I'm not sure I like any of the stir fries. In contrast the salads are under-dressed (though the dressing flavors are better than the stir fry sauces IMO). The ingredients are good and the produce is fresh, they just have to work on putting them together in the right proportions. I just found out you can get less sauce or sauce in the side so that's what I'll do from now on. The kalelatta smoothie is yummy though! The ordering system is cool in that it's all via touchscreen but the wait for it depends on how savvy people are with technology. Some people needed handholding so that holds up the line a bit. A little crazy during lunch but I guess that's expected with few healthy options in Hoboken. Everyone who works there seem genuinely nice though. Once they work out the kinks and people get more accustomed to ordering via screen then I think this place will be very successful in Hoboken.
2015-11-10,5,Have been to a location in Philly and was so excited to see this one finally open. I love the ordering via tablets - it's perfect for a picky eater so you can say exactly what you do/dont want and have it come out exactly that way. Delicious stir fry dishes too!
2015-11-09,4,I like the concept of Honeygrow - healthy, fresh, farm to table, organic, protein, vegetarian - all buzz words we need to hear more of! If Hoboken had other similar options like Terri or Hale and Hearty, Honeygrow would rank between 3 to 3.5 stars. With virtually no competition (yet), I'm going with 4. Pluses:- Food was really fresh and portions were substantial (I had plenty of leftovers)- Many options for toppings and veggies - huge score on that front - Stir fries are really good - love the unique range of sauces too - Nice, clean interiors, minimalistic and airyMinuses:- The touch screen kiosks can get a little confusing - it's tough to edit your choices or get rid of something you've added by mistake to your cart- Long wait times for your order- Would like better options to customize the sauces at the kiosk (mild, medium, spicy or add extra sauce)What we got:- Stir fry with whole wheat noodles, coconut red curry sauce, tofu, carrots, snap peas and coriander. Over all the combination really worked, though found the sauce to be on the blander side - lacked the flavor of coconut and a little kick would add to the authentic Thai/Asian concoction.- Husband got the egg white noodles in lemon miso sauce - he only wanted beef, but somehow we didn't notice, but the default option on the kiosk is chicken; so he ended up getting both and being charged extra!! The lemon miso combination was really good - much more flavorful then mine.Would love to go back and try their salads next.  Over all, great new addtion to the neighborhood!
2015-11-07,5,Told myself I would only have protein and fiber for the rest of my day and this place hit the spot. I had a sesame garlic stir fry with free range chicken and beef as well as the Boston lettuce that with some toasted sesame is on top and sesame garlic sauce was spectacular.Some of the other garnishes I added was bell pepper carrots pineapple roasted corn roasted squash medley and crush candied cashews.
2015-11-07,5,So healthy and delicious! I love being able to create my own salad and my boyfriends stir fry was really good (and spicy!). Would definitely recommend and can't wait to come back!
2015-11-06,1,You Suck. Thanks for the 40 minute wait and the salty gross stir fry. Was the correct response you were looking for in the chef interviewing process "Noodles?  I can do italian, how hard is stir fry?" Because my mouth says it's the WRONG answer.  If you are looking for the right answer. The question would have had to been...Why does the new stir fry place in Hoboken, NJ suck? Because they hired a cook that looked at the menu and thought "Noodles?  I can do italian, how hard is stir fry?" NO STARS!
2015-11-06,4,Very overwhelming ordering for the first time especially with a crowd of pros behind you HOWEVER a nice woman took time to explain the system to me and my meal was delicious. So excited to welcome Honeygrow to Hoboken!!
2015-11-05,3,I really wanted to like this place.  Good clean atmosphere, friendly service, but ... The noodles are WAY too heavy.  I always feel really gross after.  Don't come in here expecting to eat a healthy meal when you get a huge portion of noodles soaked in sauce.  Secondly, they really nickel and dime you for additional toppings.  You really are paying $12 dollars for noodles and sauce people.Honeybar was a disappointment.  When I first sampled it it was delicious.  I ordered it a separate time and I came home with a bowl of fruit and honey, NO yogurt.  I went back and they looked at my receipt and informed me that I didn't choose yogurt.  I didn't realize people ordered just fruit and honey for $6?  When I got my new one I still didn't see any yogurt.  I poured everything into a bowl and got a pink soupy mess at the bottom which seemed like a mix of water and yogurt.  Definitely nothing like what I sampled.Still looking for that perfect healthy takeout place in Hoboken, the search continues.
2015-11-02,2,The main positive about this place is that the ingredients are noticeably fresher than other fast food places.  However, that is offset by the fact that it's expensive.  The people are friendly, but they are obviously still learning on the job.  The stir fry is usually bland, so I ask for extra sauce, which always causes mass confusion.  I thought it's a very simple request, but apparently it's not.  They also don't give much protean (I usually get chicken), which is disappointing.  I don't want double (and make an already expensive stir-fry even more expensive), but I want more than what they normally give.  The waiting area is basically everyone congregating around a big column near the cash register, which gets crowded and uncomfortable.  If you sit in the area with the tables and chairs (if there are any available), you won't be able to hear them call your number when your meal is ready.  They need a PA system or something like that so people don't need to crowd themselves by the register.Overall I think it has potential, but as of now there is a lot of room for improvement.  I am going to give them more tries and will increase my rating if they get these issues sorted out.
2015-11-01,3,Conflicted on the review- but absolutely love the concept of honey grow. First time had a phenomenal experience - however, my second time here they had to remake it after forgetting three ingredients. Once I got the re-make, it was drenched in sauce that I could barely eat it. Picture shows first wonderful experience and second time after trying to transfer the stir fry to another bowl.
2015-10-31,5,Great new addition to Hoboken! Everything is fresh, made to order, and healthy. The choices were overwhelming on my first visit---stir fry or salad? make my own or suggested mix? I compromised with the whole wheat noodle salad (noodles and salad in one) and it was delicious. Very reasonably priced too!
2015-10-30,4,I was eager to check that new place out! Finally a healthy and good place to have lunch in Hoboken! Delicious stir-fry, great kale-banana juice, and a yummy bowl of fresh fruits, honey granola and shaved coconut: nice concept! Plus it's very easy and fast to order on the screens :)
2015-10-23,5,I was walking down Washington st looking for a lunch place to catchy my eye and I spotted Honeygrow. I could not be any happier with my choice. Super simple to order and super delicious to eat. Such great healthy choices. Choose from an a stir fry or salad or make your own.
2015-10-23,4,Very excited for this to open in Hoboken. I went last night and will definitely go back. Although right now they are crowded and having some customer service issues as we had problems last night. The food was great! I had a make your own salad and this is what I have been waiting for in Hoboken. It's healthy and fresh a little on the pricey side but I wasn't disappointed. Would definitely go back. Hope they will open a 2nd one uptown Hoboken at some point.
2015-10-22,4,Finally! Finally it opened because I had been eagerly anticipating it's opening for months, and finally we have a healthy 'fast food' place in Hoboken, not just another bar. I live and work in Hoboken, so I'm always looking for new lunch spots in downtown. Stopped in today and got a salad. Fantastic choice of toppings- I had Brussel sprouts and marinated mushrooms and about 10 other things. Edamame, feta, carrots, grape tomatoes, croutons, candied nuts. I got a little carried away.  There was also a nice selection of dressings. The salad was awesome, but I was disappointed it didn't come with a roll. The roll was an additional $.45, which would have been fine if it tasted good, but it was terrible. I almost went back and asked for my $.45 back it was that bad. The marketing made it sound so appealing- baked at a local bakery somewhere in NY. But the execution left me with a dry bun that tasted like something sitting overnight in those bins at a&p. Don't make the same mistake :) go bunless. I will definitely be back often. So happy Honeygrow came to Hoboken!
2015-10-22,5,2nd trip here! First for salad and now for stir fry...yummy. While things maybe a little slow due to growing pains (they just opened this week), it is well worth the wait for yummy, fresh, healthy food made to order by happy and friendly staff
2015-10-21,4,I think I've found my new go-to for a quick and healthy lunch or dinner in downtown Hoboken! I've been walking by the covered storefront for months now, IMpatiently waiting for the opening, and it has finally arrived. Honeygrow is EXACTLY what Hoboken has been missing. A few other restaurants have opened, trying to emulate the eating local trend, but this hits the nail on the head. Even the furniture is made from recycled and locally sourced materials! The selection of pre-designed stir frys and salads are awesome plus you can create your own which is always a huge plus. The interface is user-friendly and pretty descriptive. While waiting for my food, I walked around the two dining areas and checked out the prep stations - everything was clean and easily identifiable. For my first round, I made my own stir fry with whole wheat noodles, broccoli, mushrooms, onions and shrimp with the sesame garlic sauce. I must say, I was thoroughly impressed. Love the Chinese take-out boxes too! They did not skimp out on the protein or veggies so there was a good balance of noodles and other toppings. Very filling and drum roll please... affordable! With a bottled water, my meal came out to $13 which I feel like is hard to find at an organic/local eatery around NYC. There are a lot of options for vegetarians and gluten-free diners, which appeals to a lot more people as well. I cannot wait to go back to try more, especially the honeybar! Aaaaand then come back to Yelp to give them that last star, because I think it's not far off from "As good as it gets!"
2015-10-19,3,Messed up my whole entire order!! Will give them another try tho because it was their first day opening. The people working there was extremely friendly and helpful-just wished the got my order right.
2015-10-19,5,The best natural, quick, customizable most delicious food in Hoboken! What a great addition! It'll be hard for me not to visit every day
2015-10-19,4,The food is good.  Had a salad there today.  But really wanted to try the stir-fry options. The problem is they all come with carbs.  They should have a base of something non carb for the stir-fry.
2015-10-16,5,Amazing service with amazing food! The manager was friendly and welcoming. The people who were working assisted us with everything. It was a really cool layout and ordering system too. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone!
