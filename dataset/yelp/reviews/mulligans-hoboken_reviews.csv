2021-11-08,5,Great place. Great staff. Really good food. Great place to stop in for a quick beer or stay for a while and watch a game.
2021-10-24,5,Have been a patron of Football Factory at Legends bar in midtown Manhattan for a decade. During the pandemic I watched all of my team's games at home but did miss a little cameraderie. Roll on to the Euro 2020 tournament in 2021 and making a trek into the city for multiple games a week was a little much. So I looked for a local bar showing games. And I stumbled upon the Mecca of soccer in NJ. Great bar, incredible fan base, standing room only and one-in-one out for the later group games. Amazing stuff. Bar staff are knowledgeable, fun and accommodating. Thoroughly recommended. Food is similar to what you'd authentic non-premier league game in England. Joking aside, the curry pie served with a side of curry sauce and chips was superb.
2021-08-05,5,Mulligan's is a great local bar. The atmosphere is friendly and comfortable. The bartenders are great, the food is tasty and most of all the monthly comedy show is amazing! The producer James Mac picks a talented and diverse lineup. I could not stop laughing!
2021-08-05,5,Comedy has moved to Wednesday and it is packed out. The beer is pretty cheap but they have great staff.
2021-05-25,5,Stopped by mulligans for some drinks after work with my boyfriend. We were greeted by a very friendly guy who brought us the menus and served us our food and drinks. We ordered the wings, chicken sandwich and the cheese quesadilla. The wings came in a buffalo sauce and were really fantastic! I will definitely come back here for the wings. The quesadilla was pretty standard but hit the spot. The chicken sandwich was basically two chicken tenders on a bun haha! Next time I think I will just order the chicken tenders instead!For drinks we ordered a few of the high noon spiked seltzer's (they had black cherry and pineapple and grapefruit available). The seltzer was served with a glass of ice which was really great! Overall, mulligans is a solid spot for drinks, wings and to watch soccer. The outdoor seating is awesome too and the service is friendly.
2021-05-16,5,BEST PINA COLADA I've ever had in my life.  Ilya blended it to perfection, the sweetness from the fresh bottle of mix was perfect for a lovely summers day. MUST TRY!!! Omg
2021-05-14,5,BEST pina colada in Hoboken. You might think this is an Irish bar,  but order a pina colada and you've just taken a trip to the tropics. Surfs up Jersey!
2021-04-08,5,fancy a saturday afternoon  pint or a wee dram ?  have one with top barman larry or as his close liquid associates refer to him as 'aggro'. he will regale the customer with stories about legendary uk rock group--the jam.  he's a good man himself !
2021-03-06,1,Wow place fits the mold of hoboken a$&hole bouncers... two people walk in and the guy at the door couldn't have been ruder.Who do you think you are ? You're a business surviving in covid, try to be nice to people cuz though you may have lost my business, you need others.. goodbye! Glad you're making soo much money , you can treat clients poorly!!
2020-12-08,4,Old school pub with cold beers, a basic bar menu and good foodTvs galore and a welcoming atmosphereThis is definitely my new go toAwesome buffalo wings!!!Covid safe and they follow all protocol
2020-01-19,5,Me and my best friend weRe visiting NYC. This bar has amazing atmosphere and stuff is very friendly! Had a great time in our short trip!
2019-12-05,5,Great food, super Eagles bar on game days.Philadelphia Soft Pretzels on the house.The whole staff is nice
2019-10-23,5,If you are an EPL soccer fan, this is the place is NJ / Metro NYC to watch the games. NY Waterways is close bye to get you across the river. The New York Blues host an array of events and get together's here. Wear your soccer colors as it will always be good banter and a conversation starter. I used to play at Frank Sinatra park on Sundays and would go to bar after for a Guinness and a bite to eat and / or watch games.
2019-10-12,1,The "muscle' at this establishment left me feeling unsafe and cornered. After waiting to use the ladies room (which was occupied from other female guests that were enjoying rounds of Cocaine), I banged on the door to attempt entry. Instead of being granted access to the restroom, I was escorted to leave.
2019-09-29,4,Fun bar with fun drinks! They do have awesome Monday night trivia with exciting prizes!
2019-07-10,5,Went there to watch the Women's World Cup 2019. Great place to watch the sports. Awesome and friendly staff. Definitely a place to come back
2019-03-31,4,Love soccer, then this is the place for soccer fanatics with a variety of beers, good bar food, with plenty of good size TVs and with a sneaky Eagles (American Football) bar.
2018-12-07,5,This is THE best place for watching soccer/football in Hoboken. It has been for quite some time. They open early to accommodate the UK kickoff times and it really fills up so you get that atmosphere you want on a game day. They'll also probably show some of the more obscure (at least in America) sports such as GAA and Rugby.
2018-11-12,5,Excellent place to watch a game!!!!Good staff. Good beer selection Had a great time at Mulligan's a few night ago, staff are very engaging
2018-11-05,1,I find it so ironic that this place is called Mulligans because I really wish I could have a free second chance at this place, but I give up. Let's set the scene. Myself and some friends were all happy it's Saturday, Liverpool arsenal game is on and we're about to enjoy some beers. We walk in, sit at the bar (not the main one) and we're greeted by who I thought would be a nice woman, the bartender. She proceeds to yell "WHAT DO YA WANT?" and points at us while walking down the bar, barely giving me a chance to speak. I asked if they had pitchers, cause obviously I'm looking for mass quantity here. She simply says "nope" and walks away without me ordering a beer. At this point, we all look at each other like, "is this b*tch serious?" I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought this was a phase. Little did I know, this was just the beginning. This chick was yelling at customers, her bus boy, and most likely her whipped boyfriend who works at Home Depot, that night. We continuously shrub off her shit attitude, drink our beers, and continue watching the soccer match, cuz that's what men do. To top it all off, my friend and I order chicken fingers and fries to hold off the buzz that is starting to become me getting drunk by 3 pm, not good. About 30 minutes goes by and I kindly asked where our food was, as if that deep fryer in the back was even turned on. To my surprise, she went and checked. About another 10 minutes goes by and they bring out chicken fingers.... no fries. At this point I threw in the towel and didn't even bother asking where the fries were, I was defeated and on the verge of being drunk. But that didn't stop my good friend standing behind me encouraging me to ask her about the fries. So I manned up and asked. "FRIES ARE SEPERATE, GATTA ORDER THEM WITH THE CHICKEN FINGERS." As if I'm some sort of psycho who would order just chicken fingers? In conclusion, that bartender sucks. She's got to go. Ask 100 people in that bar if she sucked, 96 will say yes. The other 4 were probably trying to get with her.
2018-09-24,5,This was my first time at Mulligan's and it's one of the best sports bars I've ever been to. The back room is so much fun during games and the bartenders Sean and Chris are just awesome. I will definitely be coming back with my wife and friends as often as possible.
2018-09-23,5,We went here for Sunday night on a long weekend. Not being too familiar with Hoboken pub scene; we went here with some friends. This place is actually pretty good. The bar tenders are friendly and quick to serve. What I liked the most about this place: the gaming. They have a pool table and darts.
2018-07-13,4,Stellar service from the bartenders! Came here for a FIFA game last Saturday. My guests and I were standing against the wall (behind the seats of the bar) and were still getting attention from the bartenders.After making sure the guests were satisfied at the bar, they would look over their heads and gesture to us if we were okay with drinks. I've never had this service in other bars. We would normally have to shimmy our way through guests just to squeeze in at the bar. Not here!I had a great time, the bartenders were extra attentive and the bouncer was really nice also!
2018-06-30,5,Attended the world cup. Lots of enthusiasm.  Decent prices for decent beers. True sports bar.
2018-04-30,5,Entertaining bar. I come here a lot and it's always a blast. Enjoy their pool table for the chill nights. Great draft selection and food is tasty for bar grub. This place gets me nostalgic about college. If I ever need to go to a sports/college bar I choose this one. Clientele can get loud, especially during Eagles games but that's half the charm.
2018-03-30,5,They have Yuengling on draft, so that's already a plus in my book. Need I say more. I mean I only come here to drink heavily so I mean as long as I'm served it's all good. 5 stars.
2018-02-23,5,Not only is Mulligans a great local bar - soccer temple - but look up Jerry if you'd like fantastic french martiny made.... little secrets of Hoboken !!!! :)
2018-02-18,4,Fun place to drink. If you like rugby or soccer, get your butt over here! No food though so fill up before......
2018-01-10,5,This is my go to bar for pretty much any occasion. However, I'm mostly here for the Philadelphia Eagles!! Great service with superb hospitality. The regulars here also makes it a great time.
2018-01-10,5,This is my favorite bar in Hoboken and Chris & Sean are hands down the best bartenders.  It feels like family,  been coming here for more years then I have fingers to count.  There is no place I would rather be in NY/NJ to watch the Eagles game.
2018-01-10,5,My favorite bar in Hoboken for the past 10 years. Has something for everyone, depending on when you go. Best Eagles bar in the northeast.
2018-01-10,5,This place is awesome if you're from Philly and wanna watch the birds. The girl below, Gabrielle, and her friends were a sloppy mess who were the first people in the history of Eagles bars to be cut off. Best Eagles bar in the area.
2017-12-04,1,If you are from Philadelphia DO NOT go here for a game. Hoboken's "eagles bar" had terrible service and aggressive bouncers. The environment was not friendly and was a huge disappointment. It is worth the hour drive south to be back in philly for the game.
2017-11-22,5,It's the best sports bar in Hoboken. It's the best neighborhood bar too. The bartenders are really nice, unlike those bartenders in NYC that they'll force you to order something to stay in the bar. It's a heaven for soccer fan! No matter what Europen football team you support, you're always welcome in here. Great atmosphere and you can hear people chanting after the soccer match. Food is okay but serves with big plates with cheap price.
2017-09-12,4,Solid place to watch soccer (football)! It's a great vibe if you're looking to watch a game & the price for the drinks and food are also pretty cheap for Hoboken. A table favorite were the curry fries! For around $5, you'll get a plate of fries with curry on top and it's a great app to share while catching the game and drinking a pint of Guinness.
2017-08-05,5,I landed here after not being able to get last minute tickets for an exibition soccer game at the MetLife and honestly this is the next best thing. This bar has soccer in it's DNA and not to mention they have a great selection on tap. Definitely going to be here for some games.
2017-03-02,4,Make no mistake about it, you are coming here for either the chill vibes on weekdays, or the rowdy soccer crowds on weekends, pick one. This European Football bar is part of the "Irish Pub Alley" in downtown Hoboken. There are a few things that I like about this place versus its competitors. First, the atmosphere seems more intimate than the others. You'll see the same folks in here routinely, not that it's such a bad thing, given the people could not be more friendly. The pool table in the back is a nice touch. All of the bartenders here provide excellent service and attentiveness, no complaints really.Music is also very chilled out- a lot of alternative rock, as well as Foo Fighters, DMB, Green Day, Matchbox 20, etc.This is a great spot to come with a few buddies, have a couple drinks, and catch up on life. I would classify it as a "conversational bar." Wall to wall in sporting apparel and TV's, I found this to be a great place to be a sports fan. They open up shop early for all the European matches, if you're into that sort of thing.
2017-02-16,4,Yet another Irish pub in Hoboken. What is there to say, really? I can't speak for the food, nor am I so sure I would want to, but the beer selection is pretty decent and they have lots of TVs, flair and a pool table in the back. Mike, the authentic Irish bartender with the accent to match, is super nice. I'll probably take a Mulligan and come back here again.
2017-02-11,2,I have always loved watching all sporting events at Mulligans. However, it seems they may be streaming their rugby/soccer games and still charging a $20 cover. The picture and sound are absolutely sub par for such a high cover charge. I hope this changes because I love watching sports here, but will not continue to pay the cover for poor picture.
2017-02-03,3,I like to come to Mulligan's when I'm feeling nostalgic about college. It's got the vibe of a college pub for sure. Loud music, packed in crowd, and a no-frills casual atmosphere. I also think it's really cool that they play all Premier League games live (come on you Spurs), although I haven't made it here for one yet. From my experience here, it's a great place to come if you want a typical pub experience with loud music and lots of drinks. You can take your pick between three rooms - the slightly more laid back main room, the back room with pool tables, or the side room for dancing.
2017-01-28,5,As a soccer fan this is just the perfect bar. Not a whole lot of places in town where you can always catch the match. Bar staff is awesome and always make me feel welcome.
2016-10-31,5,I had a private party here Halloween weekend and it went so smoothly. I cannot say enough positive things about this place. The bartenders are awesome, the owner is great and the entire overall accomodation for my party was perfect.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
2016-10-16,5,Great place to watch games. For Eagles fans, great place to come together and cheer on the birds. Friendly staff, good drink specials, and good food.
2016-08-27,5,Great Sports bar, great staff + an ideal spot for a private party.They have a seperate party room that you can reserve for large group which I recently did for birthday party I was planning. They allowed me to do the party on a Saturday during peak hours which a lot of places won't do (if you're trying to have a room to yourself).I can't say enough about how accommodating the staff was.They were so helpful with setup before the party, very flexible about letting me move things around the room etc and they were super attentive during the party.The flexibility and kindness of the staff really makes all the difference when you're planning an event and they truly went above and beyond.Would definitely recommend Mulligans!
2016-08-09,5,E-A-G-L-E-S ....EAGLES!!!!If you are an Eagles fan in Hoboken this is the place to be! Every year when football season rolls around I am so excited to go here! Get here EARLY for games or you will not get a seat. For division games get there SUPER EARLY.Service is quick and be ready to sing the fight song.
2016-08-06,5,Its close by my house but had never ventured in.  What a great place.  I love that they show sports, especially soccer.  The atmosphere is great, I met a few good people who know their stuff.  The drink selection and prices were good, and the cheeseburger/ fries were great.  I did a little drunk, good thing I live close by.  Thank you Mulligan's.
2016-05-31,4,Watched a random soccer game here at night, the crowd was good and they were all into the match.  I've heard it gets crowded for the morning BPL matches, but would still like to watch one of those games there.  Decently priced drinks.  Will update after going on the weekend for a better game and see how the crowd is then
2016-03-24,5,Cool sports bar !! Separate section for sports. Nice ambience and atmosphere especially during soccer matches. I am usually here to watch Arsenal FC which I am a die hard fan.
2016-03-10,5,I left my video camera at the bar and the next day - i came back searching 4it-and they had it!! Bartender held it next to the register. A miracle! Friendly helpful staff, honest service , A++
2016-01-24,5,My second favorite bar on First Street. No food so it limits my visits however the soccer vibe is awesome and the bartender's are great. My friends and I do our Friday or Saturday nite Mulligans, Marty O'Briens and Mcwiggans mini bar crawls always a good time no need to go anywhere  else in town! All 3 bars are half a city block apart.
2016-01-08,5,I've only ever been here to watch soccer on weekends, unsure what it's like ANY other time - but I must say that it is a SOLID bar to watch soccer at. There are SO many fellow English Preimer League fans that come through - it's great to see it's popularity grow in the United States. Additionally, they have amazing curry fries, a ton of tv's, and a decent amount of seating. The service was solid despite the VERY busy crowd, prices are reasonable and the beer selection is on point. I'm a fan for sure!
2016-01-02,4,Here watching a Man City game, which will never be as crowded as whenever Chelsea, Liverpool, or Man United is on, but that's good for me. Esp since this place is always a good place to watch soccer.Anyway, even though Mulligan's have a limited menu,  the food thats on it is pretty good. Plus their appetizer combo will fill you up.Always treated well here.
2015-11-27,4,Friendly bar, gets super packed when there are soccer games. Go crowd and the drinks are a lol pricey, but then again it is a bar in Hoboken. But the atmosphere is great.
2015-11-16,4,If you make your way off of the (very, very) beaten trail of Washington Ave. and head down 3rd, you'll eventually find mulligans. After waiting for 15 minutes in a line of drunk 20-somethings (Hoboken protocol), you will be greeted by a surprisingly jolly owner/bouncer. He'll pick on you and joke around with you until he sees that enough dudes have left the premise to let you in. After that, it's a pretty normal Irish pub that does soccer in the AM and partying in the PM. I'd like to go back.
2015-11-02,2,Guess this is a bar that opens early on the weekend for epl and may show some intl team matches here & there...trekked all the way out here for some champions league action & it was closed
2015-10-20,5,One of the coolest bars to go to in Hoboken. Excellent prices!...cool bartenders that are very friendly. And lots of bathrooms so there's never a line emptying that bladder :-) if you're into soccer it's the place to be & if you're an Eagles fan it's fan heaven during football season. Has its own club side for (just) Eagles fans ....a great experience located a block off Washington ave.
2015-10-08,3,I want to give this place more stars because of the great draft beer on tap and all the ball games they show, but the place smells awful.  What's up with that?
2015-05-30,3,Good place for the Irish vibe, pool tables and to massage a world cup replica trophy made out of a fallen tree outside the bar (look through the pictures to see what I'm talking about). Also good for English Premiere League games.
2015-04-23,5,I love this bar. One of the friendliest places in Hoboken with a crowd from around the world. Great selection of drinks and the bartenders are terrific.
2015-03-20,5,Tough to find a better bartender than GerryGreat bar, definitely a favorite spot
2014-12-30,4,Friendly staff and they show all of the english premier league games!
2014-11-25,4,Great bar to watch sports and have some beers. It gets crowded during games, but that's expected. I haven't tried the food yet; once I do I will update my review to include food.On weekend nights it's definitely a go-to bar if you're bar hopping. There are few rooms and they each have their own vibe. The front room is more the chill side where you stand or sit at the bar or the high tables. The back room has a pool table, booth seating and is more open. Then the room on the other side of the bar is more dance party. It gets darker, the music is louder and you don't sit at the bar.Overall, great vibes because it's got a little of everything. Fun bar.
2014-11-16,5,we came here after doing some bar hopping, this place has still kept its fun vibe.  bartenders are quick! especially for a packed place. recommended!
2014-11-15,4,Great spot, very crowded. Music was on point but kinda tight to walk around as this place was packed. Security guy was cool as we were waiting in line, and was friendly. Nice girls inside, wish i had come earlier in the night. Will come back.
2014-11-01,5,This is My favorite bar in Hoboken. The crowd is great, the staff is friendly and professional, and it's the best place to be to watch a good game of soccer.  The prices are good and it's always my first stop when I show friends around town who haven't been to Hoboken. In fact, we are going there tonight for a going away party for my little brother who also frequents the pub on the regular. If you want to have a good time with un-pretentious pretentious people, check out Mulligans Pub in downtown Hoboken.
2014-10-17,5,This is a great bar. Being from the UK this feels like a little piece of home to me. Best soccer bar in the tri-state area. EPL on Saturday and Sunday mornings with a couple of pints and a full Irish breakfast no better place to be. The atmosphere is great and the staff are friendly.
2014-10-16,3,A few friends and I came here fo watch a US Soccer friendly match on a Tuesday night. There are a bunch of different flags and scarfs drapped across the walls and ceiling. The atmosphere was really cool, especially for a weeknight. There were at least a dozen people in US jerseys screaming a cheering. The draft selcection covered domestics, a few British beers, and some crafts. I was hoping for some deaps on a Tuesday but no such luck. Bud Light pint was $4 and a Sam's Oktoberfest pint was $5. My friends and I also grabbed food since we had all worked late and were starving. The food manu is very limited (almost exclusively things that are fried or griddle heated). One friend and I got the Buffalo Chicken wrap ($8) and our other friend got the apps platter (wings, tenders, and mozzarella sticks - $10). I can't say it was the best thing I've ever eaten but it certainpy wasn't the worst. Basic pub food - what we were expecting so no complaints.
2014-08-30,5,I can't say too much about Soccer Bars/Pubs here in the US, but I don't think it gets much better than this. My friend and I went here today for the Chelsea Everton 6-3 thriller and it was a great time, yes I am a Chelsea fan! There are multiple beers on tap and it costs around $6 for a pint, not too bad. The bartenders and people who seem to frequent the bar know the game cared about the results. Multiple fans had jerseys and when the game was going on the sound was full and people were not only talking and drinking, but watching and rooting on their squad. The bar is decorated with everything soccer related and when you walk in you know you are going to be watching soccer and not football or baseball which is nice since there is no worry about what will be on the TV. I did not have any food, but the selection is limited to bar snacks and small plates which is probably best for a bar like this. I wasn't sure whether I should rank this 4 stars or 5, but I had no real reason to knock it down so 5 it is! If only this bar was in Montclair, but next time I get the chance I will be making a trip back to Hoboken for some soccer at Mulligans.
2014-06-23,5,Absolutely love this place.  Met my Fiance here on a cold January night 4 years ago and it's a staple on our stops into Hoboken.  Very friendly staff, wide selection of draft beers and full lineup of alcohol.  Decent prices as well.
2014-06-22,1,Watched bouncers let their friends in the bar but not people waiting outside. Waited an hour to get in and then the owner came out to tell everyone no one was allowed. Lots of bar fights and douchey employees. Don't even waste your time coming to this shithole.
2014-06-20,5,Came here today to watch the World Cup, and aside from Italy losing, I loved it! The bar is full of soccer scarves, jerseys and posters, a true footie fan's dream come true. Definitely recommend to any fans in the area.
2014-06-15,4,Just what a sports bar should be.  Lots of big TVs.  Guinness on tap.  Real soccer fans.
2014-03-26,4,Went in here to watch an El-Classico.The place was pretty full about half hour before start of the game. They have lots of room and the the TV and sound system was good. Well priced beer, crowd that was there for the game and cheering/booing at all times. All I can say is I have found my Legend'ary place in Jersey City for any soccer game.Note - Guys can also score practice scoring goals in the washroom while they get ready for their next round
2014-03-14,3,This was our first stop for the night to grab a few drinks.Surprisingly..their kitchen was closed and there were no servers around,so we had to get our own drinks from the bar.Based on the other reviews,I guess we caught them on a bad day or maybe the kitchen closes early here.There werent all that many people around when we dropped by at 8.30.The pool table was available which was great coz it took our mind off the fact that we didnt have anything to munch on while having our drinks!The bartender was nice and offered to get us food delivered from elsewhere if we wanted.Based on the drinks alone..it was nothing special.!
2014-01-23,5,One of the top sports bars in the Northeast. Soccer, Rugby are available to view. A great menu with a friendly staff that makes you feel at home.A top selection of beers are available. Owner Paul makes a personal connection with his guests.
2013-12-26,4,Great bar in Hoboken.  Not too crazy, but not too packed.  Can relax and have a good time here.  I only wish they would get some other non-Magner's brand cider.
2013-12-21,4,This is my place in Hoboken for watching sports.  The bartenders are always really nice, the beers are cheap, and it's got a pretty decent vibe.  Well, one half has a nice vibe.  The other half feels a bit like a garage, or a basement.  But it's not the worst place to watch a game.It's also a good place for Philly sports fans.  Especially Eagles/Phillies.  The only complaint I have is that there's so little sunlight in here.  But there's nothing they can really do about that.  I'd just much rather be somewhere with some air and sun when it's a nice day outside.
2013-08-25,4,Great bar for watching soccer. Bartenders are pretty cool and the drinks aren't expensive.
2013-06-18,4,Home away from home.  Mulligan's is a soccer-based bar, but don't let it fool you - it gives you the best of both worlds.Weekdays:  Happy Hour is what's up.  Your barkeeps take care of you and there's always regulars there to watch sporting events.Weekends: Dual bar-dom.  The front side of the bar is more relaxed - but it WILL get busy up there.  They also have darts and a pool table in the front.  The back of the bar typically opens at 10 - where they have a DJ and host a good ol' fashioned dance party.  So really, you get a little of everything at Mulligan's.  And there's nothing wrong with that.
2013-03-23,4,Ah, Mulligan's. I hate to love you. You do bad things to me. Whenever we're together, you make me make some really poor decisions. Damn you.In a town full of ex-frat types who like to congregate at fratastic bars downtown, Mulligan's is a welcome relief. More laid back and not blaring fist pumping music, Mulligan's is off the main drag tucked away on First Street.Why I love Mulligan's:-Bartenders: super friendly, attentive and willing to put up with our drunken shenanigans. In fact, they seem to encourage them.-Bathrooms: Singles. No bathroom stalls! I love this. I hate talking to drunk strangers in the bathroom. Everyone knows drunk girls are the worst.-Sports: Always on TV. I love that there seems to be an underlying Philly tone here (I'm willing to admit this as I recently "came out" as a Phillies/Eagles fan to my NY friends).This place is amazing. Leave your YOLO tank at home.
2013-01-16,4,I enjoy this place.  Its nothing special or amazing, but its always a good time.  The drinks are good priced and music in the dance room is always on point.  You can come in here with jeans and a tee and have a great time.
2012-11-18,5,I always assumed this was just another crappy fratty first street bar until a friend told me it was a Philadelphia Eagles bar. I finally checked it out and indeed it is! The back room comes alive and its about as glorious as the Birds are awful this year. Finally somewhere to catch the games without all the obnoxious North Jersey Giants fans. Just obnoxious fellow Birds fans :)
2012-10-24,4,Mulligan's is a pretty reliable weekend bar. It doesn't really get packed even after midnight, they make good drinks, and the clientele doesn't reek of douchebaggery.However, I'm not a fan of PDA, and it is all over the place here! Someone get the hose, really.
2012-10-22,5,A perfect soccer pub. At 8 am, the true fans were here enjoying the Tottenham-Chelsea darby. It was at least half full by 9 am. Though there were some really annoying CFC fans in the house, it didn't spoil the experience.There's free coffee at the front of the bar if you're not down for hair of the dog raging. The Irish breakfast (a wee $10) comes with a bounty of meats, including your favorite black and white sausage, eggs over easy, and lovely beans.The TVs are awesome, with brilliant clear displays that look sharper than any other sports bar whose screens I ever paid attention to. You'll have a good view from just about any angle.Mulligan's caters to their audience pragmatically and professionally. There should be a soccer bar like this in NY! (Sorry, Triona, I do like you to, but I like Mulligan's better). Tip: If it's busy here, try McSwiggan's down the street.
2012-08-15,5,I. LOVE. Mulligan's. I've eaten dinner here a few times and the food is decent - typical bar food. The 5 stars is because I SUPER love this place on the weekends - it's perfect to have a few drinks (ok, maybe more than a few) and dance your heart out. I've never had a bad time here.
2012-07-22,4,Went on a Sunday afternoon, pretty empty, fine by me......very laid back, lots of soccer gear hanging everywhere, super cool bartender...bummed out only by the fact that the kitchen was closed!
2012-07-11,4,I didn't eat here, so I don't know anything about the food...but I loved the people at the bar, cuz they were friendly and also over all mood of the place.This is not for music, or dancing and the music might disappoint you if you were looking for a place to go crazy. But overall, a perfect place for after work drinks, or the second bar you hit after getting drunk, and dancing a lot, and are tired in Hoboken...I'm giving this a big thumbs up!Also did I mention that all the soccer references on the walls are suave!
2012-07-09,3,So it's Sunday at noon and I have absolutely nothing to do.  Hoboken is empty (citizens are down at the Shore) and so is my stomach.  I recall some Yelp reviews lauding the Irish breakfast at Mulligan's and decide to give it a shot.Long story short, I arrive at Mulligan's and it's totally empty.  When I say empty, I mean the only three people at the restaurant/bar were the bartender, the cook, and myself.  Sounds depressing, but it was actually kind of awesome.  I had the best seat in the house for the Wimbledon men's final and a pint of Guinness.  I ordered the Irish breakfast and was not disappointed.  It's a ton of food, so bring your appetite.  Eggs were pretty good, but slightly underdone (I dunno if that's customary for Irish breakfast, but I'll order my eggs over-well or over-easy from now on).  Everything else was great.  Sausage and Irish bacon (think sliced pork) were excellent.  Service was really fast and my food was fresh and hot.  Best of all, my Guinness was ice cold and the tab was low.I have a feeling that when I come back (which will be soon) I'll bump this place up to four stars.  *3.5 stars.
2012-06-12,4,Mullie's is a great place to watch international football matches and chill over a few pints. Fish and chips is light and crispy; curry chips are delicious but you will pay later; the meat pasties look basic but tasty; and my (British) friend swears by the Irish breakfast with blood sausage. No frills. Good bar. About a dozen TVs. International and local crowd that is serious about sport. See you there for the England match on Friday!
2012-06-12,4,Is this place cool enough, trendy enough, special enough for 4 star? Not really. So why the 4 stars? Cause I've never had a bad time here.Travel back with me to New Years Eve 2005... my buddies and I were here celebrating in belligerent fashion, and one of my friends had taken a liking to a lady at the bar. She started talking to another guy, so my buddy decided it would be a good idea to pull the fire alarm to break up their conversation, and coincidentally, empty the bar on NYE for the night. The bouncer kept asking him "Why'd you do it man?!?" to which he had no reasonable response.Fast forward to now. Any time my friends and I (minus the dude who pulled the alarm - he is now married and living in Long Island) come here, the bouncer always remembers us and asks us "You didn't bring your friend, did you?" Even though he remembers us for the wrong reason, you have to like a place that remembers people from something from 7 years ago.Short version, this is a chill place you can you always pretty much count on enjoying yourself with a less than pretentious scene.
2012-06-08,3,One of the few bars on 1st Street I can actually put up with! I always have a good time. Good music, friendly bartenders and usually not super packed.
2012-06-05,5,Best bar in Hoboken.  One of the few things I miss after moving uptown.  Friendly bartenders.  Love the soccer motif.  Best Guinness pour around.Weekdays - great place to have some pints with friends.Weekends - Irish bar madness... in a good way.
2012-05-27,5,Great place to watch your favorite European football team or join The Philadelphia Eagles Club on Sundays or the Phillies Club on Fridays for regular season games. Mulligan's hosts these clubs - and fans of our teams are encouraged to join our Facebook group to see the outstanding beer specials that Mulligan's gives to Philly fans of our club. The staff is fantastic and the crowd on the weekends is usually 22-28 year olds looking for a fun night out. They have a DJ on the weekends and one side of the bar will be the "drink" side while the other is the "dance" side. It's hard to find bars in Hoboken that are popular and try to keep the guests happy. An earlier reviewer groused about her Halloween experience because of the playoffs of Yankees vs Phillies in 2009. You have a 'regular' crowd who comes to this bar and Mulligan's tries to accommodate them, which isn't necessarily fair but these are people who over the years have spent a great deal of money for their patronage. That's life. But with that said more often than not Mulligan's will bend over backwards to keep newbies and regulars happy - but the price of being a popular bar is that on busy nights someone will be waiting in line.Also probably the best pint of Guinness in town. Bar none.
2012-02-27,3,Prepsters paradise.   Both times I've been there there just so happened to be really large upset white guys occupying the pool table.  Just the douche type who stares everyone down.  The pool table is decent and they have darts.   Don't think I'll go back.  A sea of never ending pastel colored polos.  Seems like a decent place to watch a soccer game but other than that not worth it...unless you're a prepster.
2012-01-22,5,2 of my girlfriends and I ended up at Mulligans because Pourhouse wasn't letting anyone in for 30 minutes. It ended up being the BEST thing ever! The DJ was on point with playing what our generation will consider classics. We literally danced our butts off for hours. The drinks were cheap and the crowd was decent. This will def be our first stop from now on when we're going out in Hoboken!
2011-12-15,4,For the longest time, I had only visited Mulligan's during the day to watch soccer. As a big fan of the sport, it's one of the best (and only) places in the area to watch big games live. Barca Madrid? You bet. Rangers-Celtic? Definitely. Even my very own NY Red Bulls get featured on a few of the TVs when they have games, so it's not like they discriminate against MLS or are Eurosnobs.As a place to watch soccer with other soccer fans, it's a fun time. You really get that European pub feel, and there are enough TVs that you will always be able to see what's going on.Fast forward to a month or two ago. I went out one Friday evening with a buddy and we were talking about how we hadn't really been to many of the downtown bars. We walked around and eventually got to Mulligan's, when we realized that we'd never actually gone there at night. Maybe we'd swing by and enjoy a quick beer in a relaxed atmosphere we thought.Wrong. The place was PACKED inside, and resembled a frat party / Green Rock more than it resembled the quiet pub we had expected. They had music going (top 40 / dance), drunk girls everywhere, and overall a fun time, if a bit crowded. We stuck around for awhile and had a beer, but eventually it became too packed to fully enjoy. Still, if you're into the whole frat scene still, it's worth checking out in the evenings.Overall4 stars as a daytime/soccer bar, 3 stars as an evening / frat party bar. Avg 3.5, rounded up for being Hoboken's only soccer bar.
2011-11-17,5,Review for daytime football watching.I love football (soccer, if you must). Grew up watching random matches on Telemundo when no other coverage could be found. We went here for the epic women's world cup quarterfinal match, USA vs. Brazil. You know, the one where we're about to lose, Brazil's Erika fakes an injury and gets stretchered off, and the resulting stoppage time allowed Abby Wambach's forehead to do its thing. And we won on penalties. Take that, Erika.Sadly, this being a women's match, there were only about 8 people at the bar. The atmosphere more than made up for it, though - those of us that were there were ALL ABOUT IT. The owner poured us all "lucky shots" on the house before the penalty shootout. Lucky, indeed!All that said, I don't think I'd come here on a weekend night, since I'd expect the kind of atmosphere other yelpers have mentioned. But it's my top choice in town to watch a great game with great people.
2011-10-31,3,3 stars strictly for the fun vibe during daytime rugby/soccer (football) matches.lots of locals chill here during the week...but becomes a shitshow on weekend nights.The one-in-one-out policy (fire code bullshit) was mad ill on halloween night...chicks with ho outfits on getting all wet and shit.  bahahahaI witnessed what one of my hoboken d-bag whiteboy friends said to me, "ain't nothing but big honkeys up in here".he ain't lyin.
2011-08-16,5,Best bar in Hoboken (especially if you love football)... Food is great (get the Traditional Irish Breakfast or the Fish n' Chips... Yummm!). Guinness = bomb! Or even go for the Poor Man's Black Velvet if you like a sweeter taste than Guinness alone (1/2 guinness 1/2 magner's cider)... Service is awesome... All around amazing...
2011-05-25,4,In Hoboken, a perfect fan-base intersection for all New York metropolitan area sports teams, Mulligan's happens to be one of my favorite watering holes in town. And of course, of all places within the square mile city, it just had to be Philly headquarters, didn't it? Go figure. As you can probably guess, I do not go here to watch the Flyers or the Sixers or the Phillies or, God forbid, the Eagles, and while it also serves as the destination for soccer fanatics in the area, I simply frequent here for one thing and one thing only - to party.On the weekend, Mulligan's hosts one of the most unpretentious night's out you can have downtown. There may be a wait at the door, but the line typically moves quickly, and all the other bars on the block have queues just the same. But once you're inside, make your way past the crowded front bar, which is more of a laid-back, pub setting, and circle around to the second room, whose entrance can be found in the back right of the real estate. You have just entered the party zone.There may be a group of lively, young Hobokenites creating dance circles that you must pass through en route to the bar. This is standard operating procedure, so please oblige them and shimmy onwards. Once at the bar, mixed drinks are served in mini-chalices that you might find in your grandmother's china cabinet, because, well - why the hell not? Grab your tiny pimp cup, grab your friends, grab a girl (but don't "grab her" grab her, you creep), and hit the dance floor. The DJ spins mostly pop, hip-hop, your flavor of the moment hits, and the entire room is pretty much down. You will be, too.And really what I may like most about Mulligan's is its positivity. Never have I seen an incident between patrons, never have I been treated rudely by any of the staff, and never have I had a bad time here. And from the smiles across everyone else's face in the second room, I don't think they have either. Plus, I'd be crazy not to mention that the mens' room has little soccer goals set up in the urinals, so when you, uh, relieve yourself, you can hit one through the net every time. Trust me, experience it for yourself and you'll see how this plays into my whole positivity pitch. Anyway, unlike other bars in the vicinity, Mulligan's doesn't publicize big events or position itself as some flashy, exclusive spot downtown in order to get people to come to their party. Mulligan's got a good population of people who think this place is just right, just the way it is. And I'd have to agree - why mess with a good thing? Very simply put, this place is pretty damn cool. Well, for a Philly bar, at least.
2011-03-26,4,Best pint of Guinness in town....bar none! A great bar to chill away from the crowd on the weekdays. There's always some sports on TV whether American or European. The drink selection is OK, nothing crazy. They definitely don't skimp on the booze which I like. The staff are pretty cool too; friendly and willing to talk. The regulars during the week are a good down to earth crowd.On the weekends it gets insane here when they open the back room with dancing. The crowd is typical Hoboken on Friday/Saturday. Overall one of my favorite Hoboken bars.
2011-03-05,2,Went for the Hoboken St. Patrick's Day Parade. $20 cover charge (which was actually on the cheap side for Hoboken) - cheapest beer was $6 and the only food was corned beef on white bread.  I would've given this one star but boosted it up to two in comparison with all the other places in town which rip you off even more.  My advice: if you want to celebrate St. Patty's Day without going into the city, head up to Pearle River.  It's cheaper and it's a better parade.
2011-03-01,4,Best bar on this block BY FAR and the only one I will enter willingly.  As many of us Hoboken-ites know, the closer you get to the PATH, the worse the scene gets so this place is refreshing, although I wouldn't dare hit it up on a Saturday night when you're likely to get Shannon overflow. It's a football and rugby joint with decent and reasonably priced beers on tap.  And a lack of excessive amounts of douchery on 1st Street just off Washington????  That's likely the best part!
2011-01-24,5,favorite bar in hoboken, by far!!good people, excellent staff, great drinks.always a good time... i try and get to this place at least every couple of weeks.
2010-12-21,5,My favorite bar in hoboken... and I don't even like soccer!Laid back place to relax with friends during the week - packed irish bar goodness on the weekends.
2010-12-02,5,Was looking for a place to watch the awarding of the 2008 and 2012 World Cups this morning on my way to work this morning. Went to Mulligan's and even though they weren't "open", the owner Paul and I watched the ceremony and Paul couldn't have been nicer.So, this review isn't much a review of the place, but of the owner. A+ top notch guy.BTW...the place looks like a great set-up. Many TVs with a great soccer bar feel to it. Will have to get back there very soon for a match.
2010-06-10,3,"Hoboken has more bars per capita than any other city in the United States-though these bars tend to be very similar in design, size, beer options and clientele, the latter of which tends towards the white, straight, upper-middle-class, and socially conservative. The scene draws people from all over New Jersey, as well as locals. "This is why I never see a reason to wait on a line. Especially if the place is already as packed as Mulligan's gets somehow. Reasons not to wait on a line:1. Your waiting to get into someplace that is at capacity. Good luck getting to the bathroom/bar/backroom.2. Good luck ordering your drinks with a packed house of thirsty animals.3. You could be drinking at another bar that doesn't have a line. I'm already on my fourth round down the street by the time you get in. 4. The bar without the line is a stone's throw away. First street has bars next door to bars. No need to stand still, EVER!5. You could always come back later. Crawling around the streets, hoping from one place to another is how it's done. 6. Lines are for poor people. This isn't welfare. Your not winning a prize. They got the same beer and spirits here that they have at every other place. 7. You don't play pool well enough to impress anyone. So if you came here to show up your friends, just move it down to Northern Soul, cause that place is alot more low key. Good night and good luck!
2010-05-20,5,Best football (soccer) bar in NJ without a doubt. The place is pretty big and you get a lot of football supporters from all over to cheer for their beloved clubs. The beer selection is pretty good, the owner Paul is a cool guy even though he's a Chelsea supporter =/ The prices are very reasonable and the place is pretty close to the Hoboken Path Train so it's convenient getting there.
2009-11-18,4,I didn't give this place a fair shake based on the stuffy (literally stuffy, not meaning stuck up) air in the main room, but this place gets a great crowd on the weekends, and the DJ party in the second room is a nice change of pace from the pub scene in the main room.They get very crowded Friday and Saturday, so if you don't want to wait on line (and who does), get there on the early side (9-10pm should do it), especially if you're going with a group.Great TV set up for whatever American or European sports are on the tube...
2009-11-02,3,I like the setup of this bar.   With multiple rooms, games, and plenty of TVs, it is like my sports watching comfort zone.  If I was rating it on the time we went there for St. Paddy's this spring, I'd give it a five.  But, after returning for Halloween, I need to knock off two stars.  Yes, I know it was Halloween and we should expect crowds... It is the staff's behavior in the face of such crowds that knocked off the stars.  Our group of 9 arrived at 10 to a line of about 20 people.  Now, most places had lines already given that it was game 3 of the World Series and Halloween night.  Fine.  We watched as people trickled past us to go to the private party being held at the right side of the bar.  We watched as the line in front of us was slowly reduced until we were next to enter the bar.  And then... the wait.  We had been on line for 20 minutes, and then stood right in front of the door for FORTY.  When we inquired, the bouncer told us he would let us know how long it would be once he went inside and checked on the crowd.  Then the other bouncer walked over and told us that unless we wanted to pay for the open bar private party ($30 for the hour remaining!), we'd be in line til after midnight.  He also said as a Phillies bar they were giving preference to Phillies fans (he had heard us clearly discussing the game and the fact that we are Yankees fans) and that we were welcome to go find another Hoboken bar if we had a problem with it.  Yes, because after waiting in line for an hour on Halloween, I'm going to wait on ANOTHER line somewhere else.  Right...  They finally let us in 20 minutes later, but only half our group.  After we went inside and bought a round, the other half of our group was apparently told that they would be waiting at least another half hour (they were not told this before we went in, or we all would have left together).  I would go back, but only on a night when there was no drunken holiday and certainly not when the Yankees are playing the Phillies.
2009-04-28,5,A short Review. One Saturday morning the pub packed and everyone was singing the "The Fields of Athenry"  along with the crowd at Croark Park, Dublin.  A full Irish Breakfast, a cup of Tea and Some Rugby is a good Saturday Morning:-)
2008-08-13,4,After a Saturday night of bar-hopping, my friend and I enjoyed Mulligans best.  The crowd was young, but not fresh out of college like around most of the downtown Hoboken area.  The bar had several different rooms and some pool tables to keep the night interesting.  I will definitely head back to Mulligan's, but next time make it a first stop, rather than an end to the evening.
2008-07-31,4,Any early-morning soccer (football) afficianado will tell you that finding a reliable hangout for EPL, La Liga or Seria A games is as important as knowing that rooting for Everton in the wrong bar will get you tossed. And not in a good way.Mulligan's, which we were visiting for something entirely unrelated to soccer, is one of those good types of places. The beer is plentiful, cheap and terrible (crappy American light, my favorite) and they have plenty of jersies and knick-knacks on the wall.They also have a plethora of televisions and every sporting package known to man (meaning I could get the Cubs game on sandwiched between the Phillies and Mets. Good bartender, ample space and decent lighting (important when I can barely open my eyes at 7:45 a.m. on a Saturday) mean it's one of the few places I'd cross the river for.Except at 7:45 on a Saturday morning. That's just too early to cross water.
