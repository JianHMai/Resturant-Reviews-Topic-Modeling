2021-10-23,5,Went in here randomly when walking around Hoboken. What a gem! The pasta was quite literally the best pasta I've ever had, you can taste how fresh it is. They give you complimentary bread and the servers are very accommodating and kind. Our waiter recommended the bruschetta and im not a huge fan of bruschetta because I feel like it's just bread and tomato but this one is completely different! Sooo good! Definitely will be back. Oh and it's BYOB! (There's a liquor store one block away)
2021-10-05,4,This place was excellent and the food was a 10 across the board  great service, intimate and its also BYOB. Highly recommend and can't wait to visit again!!
2021-07-03,5,We had dinner. We ordered 1. Bruschetta2. Penne de Carlo 3. Pasta al PestoEverything was sooo good! As always very nice service.Def recommend the place if you crave Italian in Hoboken
2021-05-16,5,So I'm vegan, right, and I was on my way over here thinking I wasn't going to eat anything. Little to my knowledge they have 3 vegan dishes on the menu. Although you do have to bring your own alcohol (bring wine). I wasn't mad that I got to go pick up one of my favorites.. I mean I'm paying for it anyway! Our server's name was Tank, who was awesome and told us all about the bread they give before the meal and how it's made with no sugar (how it should be). Not only is the inside gorgeous and very well lit, but the bathroom was spotless and tank was so generous and knew what he was talking about! Quality restaurant with high quality ingredients. Great spot, thanks Tank!
2021-05-08,2,Diner beware - don't order a special here without asking the price!I haven't ate at this restaurant in over 12 years, so when my friend asked me to go, I was shocked to find out they were even still in business. They aren't big on social media and the regular hoboken foodies/bloggers don't post often about this place. We had a table for two inside at 730. The acoustics inside were bad, it was really hard to carry a conversation without yelling.  The main menu is online/scannable code and is basic,  standard Italian restaurant prices. They had several specials though - about 7-8 of them - which the waiter told us while pointing to the pasta shape on a plate. I decided on the special lobster and shrimp tagliatelle in a pink vodka sauce and my friend got the pork ossobucco. Right before our dishes came out, I was surprised when a server brought me an extra bowl and shell cracker. Not once did the waiter explain it was a lobster claw and tail. I assumed it was chunks of lobster in the pasta. While the pasta was good, I was annoyed about the work with the lobster claw (not an experienced whole lobster person). The Server didn't bring me extra napkins or a small fork.  They also forgot a knife to cut the pork. The pork was big but dry inside. It Was served over a saffron risotto that was inedible. When our check came, we were blown away that the lobster & shrimp pasta was $47!!  Absolutely absurd. It's no wonder they don't have a menu of the specials. I would've never ordered that had I known.  You can easily get a lobster pasta for $30 at Court street or Sirenetta. Do yourself a favor and go to any other amazing Italian byob restaurant in town but this one; food is much better and no hidden costs.
2021-03-13,5,I have been here a few times and I absolutely love the chicken Milanese. The best in town. The service is always solid and they treat their customers with respect. The rigatoni dish is also excellent. I will continue to go back!
2021-02-20,5,Food at Trattoria Saporito is amazing. It doesn't look like much but outside but it is definitely worth it! BYOB, great food and great service.
2021-02-17,5,Came here the night before Valentine's day and was very pleased with my experience. Old school Italian food. Loved the fact that it was BYOB. Everything was delicious. Classy ambiance. They gave complimentary Bruschetta with the meal as well.
2021-02-16,5,Was there with my family on Valentine's Day, it's was six of us at night (very difficult to find a restaurant and we came across here) and  What a lovely night it was, food was amazing, service was exceptionally great overall one of the best restaurant and experience.
2021-02-05,5,This is an under the radar Italian place that I sometimes go to. I often do take out from here and I have recommend their Chicken Marsala with vegetables. I thought it was reasonably priced for the quality of the chicken and vegetables
2021-01-09,5,The lasagna was so good, just like an Italian grandmother would make and the portion was finish on its own in over with plenty of cheese which is exactly how I like it. The veal parm was cooked perfectly and came with a choice of vegetables or pasta. The best part we're the amount of choices of pasta. Typically, when I get veal parm I don't get pasta which is hard to give up when I go for Italian.
2020-12-14,5,Great service and delicious food with very generous portions. We thoroughly enjoyed our time at this restaurant.
2020-11-15,4,Went here for outdoor dinner with a friend and they were very accommodating even though we walked up without a reservation during the busy dinner rush. We both ordered different lobster dishes off the specials of the day and really enjoyed them!
2020-11-06,5,Awesome meal great service. Took my son here for birthday dinner. Veal great, gluten free options and BYOB everyone happy
2020-10-11,1,Got calamari for an appetizer and the bucatini alla Giulia for my meal. The pasta was not bucatini it was linguini. Was disappointed. Calamari definitely was not fresh and might of been what gave me food poisoning. My meal was very heavy and didn't have great flavor. Would not recommend this spot.  Only good thing I ate was the bruschetta on the house.
2020-08-03,5,I should start by saying it was certainly one of my top 3 best experiences ever at a restaurant. Mr Tank, long time manager was so clever helping my wife and I choosing our dishes we couldn't be happier, not only that he took his time to explain how everything was made and we loved it. The food was absolutely amazing! Price is very fair for what you get. It's clear they love what they do and you get just the best, from a simple bread and butter to coffee and desert. A+ for this place and we'll most definitely return again.
2020-06-16,5,Delicious, fresh, homemade pasta, good specials. No alcohol- BYOB . Outdoor and indoor seating. Friendly great service.
2020-05-27,5,Best fancy Italian in Hoboken. Large portions and great specials. Romantic date spot. Was pricey but last time I went I felt like it was completely different price wise, not as bad. Great food
2020-05-23,3,Ordered the spaghetti carbonara for takeout. Not bad, but not great either. I was really hungry so it satisfied my craving, but it felt more like an Alfredo than a carbonara. The bacon pieces were more like chunks of lard. Portion sizes are generous though.
2020-05-08,5,Ordered from here during the pandemic.  Thank you Trattoria Saporito for your speedy delivery and delicious food!!!
2020-02-26,1,Heard on the radio today that this place not only has late delivery but also sends bread without packaging.
2019-12-17,5,I came here on Sunday for my dads birthday and it was a very pleasant experience. Our waiter named Tank was very attentive and he explained the menu and specials in great detail. This helped me realize that the lobster pasta picture I saw on yelp before I got to the restaurant ,was exactly one of the specials !!! It was so good !!!! It was creamy and light at the same time and I told them to make it spicy. The pieces of lobster that came with the pasta was a perfect size. My dad got the stuffed rigatoni with meatballs which was my second choice. I tried it and it was mouthwatering !!! My sister had ravioli, her boyfriend had penne ala vodka, and my mom had spaghetti with vongele but they gave her a larger clam which was very nice. The espresso was very delish too. I also have to say the burrata special appetizer is delicious and fresh. The argues salad was made perfectly and last but not least favorite the stuffed artichoke. I wish I was eating it right now ! Next time I'm with my sister in Hoboken I will definitely come back here. Amazing Italian food approved by an Italian !!!!
2019-12-15,5,Favorite restaurant in Hoboken . Great service from the waiters, great Italian food , and the manager Mike is the best. Definitely my goto place to eat when in Hoboken .
2019-10-26,4,Came back again and got their lobster ravioli with their pink vodka sauce and it was AMAZING. It had chunks of salmon too.
2019-10-26,5,I went for dinner yesterday night and had the lentil soup and chicken parmigiana.   Hands down one of the best soups and chicken i have had.   The soup was so tasty and the chicken didn't have a regrows or refrigerated taste.   The sauce was so thin and tasty.The owner Mike was very attentive and was visible the whole time i was there.The waiter was sweet and attentive too.I highrly recommend this Italian restaurant if u r looking for real fresh homemade food.
2019-06-27,3,Food quality good, service was good. Except the Indian looking guy was rude and didn't allow us to sit on the table we wanted. Over Half the restaurant was empty and we weren't asking for bigger table we were just asking for same size table but away from door. Later when we asked the same person to take our picture he started with how good his phone is it and all.
2019-04-25,5,It was a little on the pricier side for BYOB Italian, but it was well worth it! The portions are huge and the food is delicious! The Caesar salad dressing was made fresh and a great size for sharing. They had an extensive list of daily specials. Both pasta dishes were amazing and the complimentary bruschetta was a nice touch. Would definitely return!
2019-03-13,5,One of the best meals I've had in a long time!  Simple chicken parmigiana is one of the best anywhere. The sauce is hearty and robust. The chicken is crispy underneath. And then there was the cannoli. The very, very best we've had.
2019-01-26,5,I couldn't even wait to leave before writing a review. The ambiance is perfect--I feel like I was transported to Italy. The food was beyond delicious. I ordered the short rib ragú and I can't recall the last time I had pasta cooked perfectly al dente. I highly recommend this place, and will be visiting again hands down.
2018-12-22,3,There's a lot to say about this place. We came here at 8pm on a Saturday without a reservation. We waited about 40 minutes for a table, but we weren't all that surprised since it was a Saturday night. They do try their best to seat you as soon as they can. But for the future try and get a reservation.We ordered immediately so as not to waste any time. Unfortunately, they were out of the Calamari. They were also out of the mussels. Good point to know is don't go there late because things will run out. For our entrees we got the pesto, the cauliflower bacon, and the broccoli rabe. We'll go from worst to best. The broccoli rabe and the cauliflower bacon both come with no sauce, it's basically just in a garlicky coating. Usually this is fine but it wasn't that great. Slightly dry and could use more flavor. The STAR of the night was the pesto. It is creamy and delicious. We ate everything on that plate and in fact used some of the leftover sauce for our other entrees. However, just because the pesto was fantastic doesn't make up for the dinner.We tried the tiramisu for desert. They didn't show prices but for ONE SLICE we were charged $10.95. We weren't too happy but we were there for a birthday so we just made do. Overall, it was a fine dinner but lots of small things made it a bit of a sour, bittersweet trip.
2018-12-02,1,Scam  Alert! As per a few of the reviews below, when bill came they took my Amex and came back saying it was declined.  Okay I checked my phone app and Amex did not send me any alerts.  I then gave them my debit card and they came back and said declined. At this point I knew they just did not want to pay the credit card fee.  Ended up paying cash.  Called Amex and my bank neither card was ever run.  Do not go here, these people are scammers with credit cards.  If you don't want to take credit cards just say it up front.
2018-11-10,1,Complete waste of time.  This place wasted 45 minutes of our time and did not honor the reservation our group made nor were they apologetic or concerned.  Skip.
2018-10-14,5,Best pasta dish I've ever had in my entire life. Beautiful little restaurant in a great location in Hoboken with a very authentic feel. Service was great and waiter was very helpful
2018-09-08,1,Service from waiter Gustavo was terrible, had to walk all the way into the restaurant after not being greeted at the door. Had to constantly ask for water refills as there was no attention to the table even though we were one of two in the dining room at the time. I had ordered chicken cacciatore and asked TWICE for no mushrooms and low and behold mushrooms. Mushrooms everywhere. Good thing I wasn't allergic!! Gustavo woulda had to give me mouth to mouth! I'm not one to usually write reviews, but the thing that really got me was the tip is included on the bill.. TWENTY PERCENT! Even though they messed up my order and offered no attention to the table. Truly horrible service. STAY AWAY! Stay far away!
2018-08-30,3,Two parts. Came here for dinner mid week around 530 and were the only customers. Brought wine and had a very enjoyable dinner and dessert. 5 stars all the way Next night we ate at a different Italian joint and were so displeased we came to this place did champagne and dessert. The waiter was visibly upset that we wouldn't be ordering a full meal, despite being an empty restaurant at around 7pm. After spending over 20$ in just desserts, we were asked only to pay with cash- which was different from the previous night. We used two $20 dollar bills to pay our bill, expecting to use the ~$15-17 in change to tip the waiters. After 15 minutes we realized they planned to keep all of our change as the tip, despite not pouring any of our champagne and only having brought us two plates for dessert. When we asked for our receipt and the change, the waiters argued loudly at the register and eventually brought over our change without saying a word to anyone at our table. Not sure if they thought we would be too intoxicated to notice tipping ~17 for a piece of cake or what. Drastically different service and experience the second night. Wish we had not returned so we could have given this place a 5 star review as originally planned
2018-08-23,3,I saw pics of the food at this place and thought it looked really good so just decided to read the reviews on yelp. Won't be trying this restaurant given the shadiness of them constantly saying the credit card machine is down trying to get customers to pay cash!! It's review after review and not even in the same time frame! What a stupid thing to do to try and save money paying taxes. Now I have no interest in going and I'm sure others feel the same. Dumb move
2018-08-10,4,We called last minute with a group of eight people. They accommodated us and were very pleasant. The service was fast and friendly and the food was very good.  I will be back and would recomend to friends.
2018-07-01,2,This is our second time coming. Food is good but service is disappointing. I also feel like the specials are always the same. Although it is my responsibility to ask for prices, I was overwhelmed with how much our bill came out to. I mean $18 for stuff artichokes, it's an appetizer! My braised short ribs with pappardella was $42! It was certainly not worth it. We eat out a lot and this is just ridiculous. The restaurant was pretty empty. I feel like we were slapped with a big bill because of it. First time we came their credit card machine was broke! Cash only. The bus boy who is extremely rude and lazy was probably one of the reasons I did not want to come back. First time we were there he put parmesan on my husbands shrimp without asking! And when my husband told him I did not want Parmesan on my shrimp he argued with him. Instead of apologizing and saying ok I will get you another plate. The manager had to get involved and instead of getting a fresh plate of shrimp they scrape the cheese off his shrimp. My husband said let's give them another chance. I'm super disappointed and told my husband I do not want to come back here anymore. The prices are ridiculous for specials! This is not Il Mulino for crying out loud. You can find better homemade pastas elsewhere. Try Locale in Closter NJ. Great homemade pasta!!!
2018-06-25,2,Unfortunately, this place disappointed me due to their dishonest services. I have been there twice, and both times I was told cash only AFTER I ordered food. First time, I believed in them saying that the credit card machine wasn't working. Second time, I didn't have enough money with me, and I was told to get cash and come back. I did not like that. I started reading reviews of unhappy customers, and then I found out that this place has been using this excuse "the broken machine" for at least the past 2 years. I think the food itself was decent and I liked it. It's just sad to say that I would not like to come back here again because of their bad business model.
2018-05-26,3,Came to dinner with my family to this Italian restaurant. It was air conditioned so that alone gets them a star. They have homemade pasta that's actually very good. I had the cavatelli with broccoli rabb and sausage. My cousin had pasta in pink sauce and lobster, delicious. It's a BYOB situation but the liquor store is a block away.
2018-05-21,4,Trattoria Saporito has some delicious pasta selections in particular. I love the chicken parm, which is definitely a classic, and the lasagna. Most of the food is pretty good here. However, the specials are okay and extremely overpriced, so I would recommend ordering only the menu items. They start you off with bread and a bruschetta generally too and the atmosphere makes it more upscale compared to other Italian food options in the area, with table cloths and possibly candlelight. On a nice day, there is outdoor seating right on Washington street. The location is great.
2018-04-06,4,Went here for the first time last night for dinner and It was so good. The pasta was homemade and I believe the vodka sauce I got too! My parents seemed to enjoy their dishes also. The staff was so nice and attentive. Deff  going back to try more pasta dishes out!! It's BYOB by the way.
2018-04-01,5,All I have to say is this place is absolutely  delicious. From apps to dessert. Had the squid fettuccini with crab meat, and mushrooms in a vodka sauce. Never tasted anything like it.
2018-03-19,5,As an Italian cook when it comes to going out for Italian food it has to be really good. This place is really REALLLLYYY good!!! Their homemade pasta is phenomenal. The menu has lots of options so it pleases a variety of palates. The staff is so friendly also. I waked past it for years and finally tried it and SO GLAD I did!
2018-03-16,5,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed lunch - Businessman's special at $16.95 for appetizer and any entree.  Tablecloths, elegantly decorated, peaceful ambience.  Excellent attentive service by maitre'd Saural Tank.Appetizers clams oreganato (3) and soup of the day (pasta fagiole) were both good.  Entrees tilapia with sauteed vegetables and seafood risotto were both top-notch and excellent.  The clams, shrimp and squid in the risotto were all so tender and fresh. The lemon sauce for the tilapia was sublime and complemented the very fresh vegetables --- we saw their vegetables delivered from the street and they were certainly super fresh and attractive.  For dessert, the homemade tiramisu went superbly with the coffee; the cake in the creamy tiramisu was delicately flavored by coffee and expresso.BYOB, so next time we'll bring wine.
2018-02-06,5,Went last Saturday to Saporito's. I never reviewed this place and I felt after the dish my girlfriend and I had on Saturday. It deserved the review it deserved. Wow wow wow ! Crabmeat pasta had to be one of my top 10 best dishes I've ever had ( and I'm a foodie ). We started w a little hot antipasto. Ohhh before I forget BYOB. Then dinner was just cooked perfect. We shared a crabmeat pasta and a veal martini. Finished off w a tartuffo and coffee. By that time we were stuffed !  Amazing place, amazing staff and beautiful Italian music in back.
2018-02-03,5,So glad we came here! The service was amazing and the food was unbelievably good. Perfect Italian restaurant, perfect for date night. Will definitely be back! Best pasta in Hoboken so far and I've lived here over two years! It's also BYOB!
2018-01-21,5,Everything was great! The staff was super nice. I got beef ravioli with white sauce, best white sauce I think I've ever had!
2018-01-08,5,I went to this place on a Friday night with another couple. Was greeted right away with a nice smile from the waiter. He introduced he specials as well as the menu. Everything sounded delicious! We ordered ceased salad which was SO good. Had a nice mustard taste to it which was impressive. I then ordered the special, lobster and fish over pasta. It was outrageous, but to my surprise it was $50! The food here was awesome, despite the high prices the quality is a 5!
2017-12-29,3,The food I ordered was okay but it was really expensive! The portions were pretty small. We spent over $130 for 2 people without drinks. Way too over-prices IMO.
2017-11-04,5,Upon arrival, we noticed the place was pretty empty but we decided to give them a try any way. Thank god was did. The service was impeccable and the food was even better. They gave us complimentary bruschetta which tasted amazing. I was able to enjoy the Nonnas pasta which was tortilini with mushrooms in a white sauce. The sauce was light and was packed with great flavors. My boyfriend had the linguini and clam pasta. It also tasted very good. The staff was very attentive. They made sure to refill our waters without us even asking and checked up on us frequently. I am definitely coming back to this place for more pasta. This place is also byob so don't forget the wine and beer!
2017-10-08,4,Classic old school Italian BYOB.  Very attentive staff.  Comfortable vibe inside.  Calamari appetizer was excellent.  They always have a wide assortment of pasta specials which they come around and describe in great detail.  Large portions, I usually end up with a good lunch to take home for the next day.  Hang around for a coffee or very well made cappuccino and yummy desserts.  Great for a dinner with friends or entertaining out of town family.
2017-09-24,1,Be VERY careful dining here: 1. The staff would recommend you expensive dishes telling you it's "today special".(As pic below, $49 for spaghetti). Do ask for the price before you order; 2. We were only 2 ppl, but the tips 18% was automatically added w/o my acknowledgement. 3. The staff said it was cash only because the machine was down. However after I insisted that I didn't have so much cash as your price was beyond my expectation, my credit card was accepted. Obviously he was lying to me. Avoid this dishonest restaurant!
2017-08-13,5,Great Italian BYOB with outdoor seating. The service was fantastic, the best in Hoboken I've had. Pasta is homemade and delicious! I would definitely come back here again and suggest it if you are looking for a decently priced byob.
2017-08-11,2,While the food is decent, we had a negative experience. We ordered 2 items off the specials that were presented. One was black pasta with crabmeat in red sauce, the second was a red snapper. All the pasta items on the menu were in the $15-20 range. The black pasta special turned out to be $36 when the bill arrived. The fish dish was $34. When I asked the manager why the prices weren't mentioned when the specials were presented, he said they don't mention them unless asked . We were outraged. The prices for these dishes were completely unjustified. Will not return.
2017-07-23,5,Wonderful neighborhood Italian place. Offers homemade pastas and tons of specials. We shared the mixed seafood appetizer which had butterfly shrimp, clams in white wine, mussels in red sauce and fried calamari - all delicious. Main was a great pappardelle with Lobster in a pink sauce.
2017-07-02,4,A little more expensive for what you get, but I have to admit the meal was really well prepared.I ordered a Pappardelle with Lobster and Shrimp. It was delicious!!! The total check comes to $55 (including tip and tax).Tip is automatically added to your check even for a party of 1.They did not accept credit card at the time - their machine didn't work. So I paid cash.
2017-06-05,1,I wish I could give zero stars.  A few friends and I went here for dinner, because right when you go on their website, they advertise that every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday from May to June, they have certain specials on apps, dinners, and desserts.  We decided to come and check out the specials.  We ordered multiple appetizers, entrees, etc.  The food was mediocre at best, and then when we received the check, they charged us full price for everything!  We showed them their site which advertises the special deals immediately, and they said that those deals were actually for LAST YEAR for their 17th anniversary, and that we should have known it was their 18th anniversary this year!  Is that a joke?  They should take this off their website immediately then if that's the case.  They even admitted other people had asked them about it before too, and still did not remove it off their site.  We asked to speak to a manager, who was extremely rude and unhelpful.  One of my friends asked if she could leave her number and have the owner call her, and the manager said absolutely... of course no call whatsoever, as expected.  Do not go here, it is a scam.
2017-06-03,1,Despicable. Do not go here. Dine here if you want to leave with a bad taste in your mouth. They also say its CASH ONLY after the fact. Unbelievable.
2017-06-02,2,They were so desperate to get us in and they should have told us they were not accepting credit cards despite they having the signs at the door.   We then had to walk across the street in search of an ATM.  They then convince my friends to get the bigger portion and they could share the meal. My friends opted for the bigger portion as opposed to the smaller portion (because of their recommendation) and then they get slapped with a "split" fee.  They should have warned about the fee when they suggested the split in the first place. With all the inconveniences they also put in their tip amounts on the check. I was there to enjoy a meal with family from out of town and it was disappointing and awkward, especially at the end.
2017-05-25,1,Buyer Beware!!! We eat here on a Monday night where their website lied about a Mon/Tues/Wed dinner special. When we questioned our waiter, he said that this has happened before and that it was from the previous year (it was to celebrate their 17th anniversary and he looked at us in surprised that we didn't know it was their 18th anniversary this year - how were we to know).  Then why not take down the deal from the website!!! When asked to speak to a manager, he said that he was in Italy and is unreachable. This restaurant lies!! They are tying to con innocent Hoboken residence and should be ashamed! I was a long time customer of this restaurant but never again!
2017-05-08,4,Good red-sauce BYO place located in downtown Hoboken. I've come here twice for dinner, and everything we ordered has been solid. Calamari starter is fantastic - lightly fried, tender squid, and an amazing garlicky marinara on the side that I'm still dreaming about. For mains, I've had the squid ink pasta with vodka sauce and lump crab (delicious and abundant crab, but I found the vodka sauce to be too sweet) as well as the gargenelli ala garibaldi, which was delicious. Also had a bite of my friend's linguine con vongole, which immediately made me regret my order. Entrees are on the pricier side, but the portions are huge. For dessert, get the tiramisu, which made even me (a self-proclaimed tiramisu hater) a little bit of a convert.The restaurant was bustling on a late Sunday night, and we counted 2-3 birthday celebrations. Everyone seemed to be on friendly terms with the GM, which means this place has attracted a lot of regulars. I see some reviews complaining about service, but I found it to be perfectly friendly and attentive.Tip is automatically added onto your bill (even for a party of 2), so just be cognizant of that.
2017-05-04,1,Beware! This place is a con and has a very rude manager. They force you to pay the 25% tip (for party of 2!!) - and this policy is not mentioned anywhere on their menu. If you don't pay - they threaten to call the cops on you. I have never had this experience anywhere in the world!! Call and confirm before you go.
2017-03-27,5,This is turning into my favorite Italian spot in Hoboken . Been here twice and have experienced excellent service each time. It's a BYOB spot and lots of places near by where you can pick up a bottle .Service it's fast and excellent . The wait staff are very accommodating and friendly . The last two times I have been here I have always gotten the penne all'arrabbiata - it's a penne pasta with spicy chili pepper and red sauce . If you love the heat this is the dish for you . I always ask for some extra crushed red pepper on the side . It's a good portion size and has always been very well cooked .One dessert I don't leave here without eating is the tiramisu. The tiramisu is very rich creamy and decadent . If you come here you have to try the tiramisu . Save room for dessert :)
2017-03-18,1,Good food that's overshadowed by shady practices. They told us the credit card machine was broken and that we had to go to the ATM, before they mysteriously were able to figure it out 1 minute later. Although they snuck a 20% tip in for a party of 3 that we didn't notice, so we double tipped. Not worth it, won't be back.
2017-02-24,1,I went last night with two friends and there was a hair in the bruschetta (not ours).  We politely told the waiter that there was a hair and that we'd like a new batch.  He barely apologized and never brought over a new batch.  Aside from this, the food was very heavy and made me feel sick.  I will not be returning to this restaurant.  There are plenty of Italian places in Hoboken with better food and better service!
2017-02-14,3,We had a reservation and got there and were seated immediately, which was good. However, it took them 20min to come to our table to get our dinner orders. The food arrived pretty fast and it was okaaaay. It is overpriced. $23 for a spaghetti carbonara that wasn't even that good is absurd. The main problem was the bill: they added a 20% tip without asking!! The service wasn't that good, I was planning to give a 15% tip and they included 20%??? As a client, I felt robbed.
2017-02-10,5,Located on the main drag of Washington Avenue in Hoboken, which is home to countless dinner options, Trattoria Saporito stands out amongst the crowd. This is an Italian BYOB that specializes in truffles and fantastic pasta dishes. All are made with homemade fresh pasta and the care put into each dish is evident. Tonight, I enjoyed the squid ink linguine with lump crab. I cannot put it any other way; the dishes here are special. Service is very professional and efficient. The dining room is small, so make reservations and be ready for a high noise level (they were blasting Michel Jackson the whole night). Yes the specials are a bit pricy, but they are irresistibly delicious and the BYOB makes it easier to handle. Trattoria Saporito is a must try for any occasion.
2017-01-29,5,Delicious food and IT'S BYOB!!  Great services and atmosphere, really felt like we were in a restaurant in Italy. We went on a Wednesday evening and were taken right away and sat on a nice table near the window. We were also bought a delicious bread basket. We had the bucatinni with tomato and eggplant 5/5 and the manicotti (5/5).
2017-01-17,5,Been going here for 15+ years.  This place is an institution for Hoboken Italian food.
2017-01-08,2,My husband and I went here for dinner on a Sunday. The restaurant was quite empty with only 3 tables filled including ours. We got warm bread to start with and some bruschetta on the house. Being vegetarians, we ordered spinach ravioli with pink vodka sauce from the specials which was good but a bit salty and gnocci with pesto sauce which was a little bland. I would rate the food at 6/10. What disappointed me the most was that a gratuity of 20% was added in the receipt. I did like their service and would have ended up giving the same amount as tip, but I would have preferred if they had let me make that decision though, especially when we were only a party of 2.
2016-12-22,4,I love this little place and really need to make more of an effort to get there more often. The menu is pretty extensive but then you hear the specials and wish you had brought a pen and paper. It's BYOB which is a nice perk, however, they have a tendency not to tell you the price of the specials and then gouge you on the bill which I really do not appreciate. All of the food is stupendous and the location is pretty accessible no matter what part of town you live in. I usually get the gnocchi which is nice and light and doesn't sit in your stomach like a brick. Do yourself a favor and give this place a try, but make sure you ask how much the specials are-especially the seafood ones!
2016-12-10,1,It's been 5 years since we last visited Trattoria Saporito. Why so long? We felt that the food, which at one time was quite good was now bleh, and the service frequently below that and the pricing somewhat lofty on "specials".So after a long absence, we gave it another chance earlier this evening.Fruitti del Mare was supposed to be prepared diavolo. Large portion of pasta but prepared very blandly with few mussels, two shrimp, and some clams. House salad for my wife was barely edible with ageing lettuce. I'm not sure when a bocconcini grows into regular mozzarella, but my bocconcini appetizer was well beyond the maturity phase.A rather undistinguished meal is finished and we are offered dessert and coffee as one would expect. We indicate that we may be interested after we finish our wine.Rudely, two minutes later the bill is presented without any offer of dessert or coffee. And by the way, underlined and in BOLD CAPITAL LETTERS, this suddenly becomes a CASH ONLY restaurant. So, I have to schlepp off to an ATM.Strange circumstance. The party at the table beside us had paid with credit, only twenty minutes earlier. Suddenly, the credit card facility is not working.We question this. We are told by the waiter that credit cards have not worked since "yesterday". Wouldn't it have been appropriate to tell us upfront and BTW, why was it working for others?So there you have it, a combination of mediocrity in food, lackadaisical service, and untrustworthy business practice.There are many superior choices in Hoboken. Choose them and avoid Trattoria Saporito, in my opinion. Never again for us!
2016-12-05,4,Food was excellent...started with the shrimp and tomato sauce. Healthy portion and the shrimp themselves were far from puny. Chicken marsala was perfectly cooked and the mixed vegetables were crisp and delicious. Not on the menu, but date ordered eggplant rollotini and was not disappointed.  Alcohol is bring your own, which is a benefit unto itself.Just about my only criticism is the size of the restaurant, every ounce of floorspace is used to maximize tables, but it's to be expected from a restaurant in a bustling urban area. That being said, wait staff is extremely attentive, polite, and friendly.
2016-11-30,3,We came in on a rainy Wednesday. I ordered pasta with clams (which has lots of clams but the sauce was bland and underwhelming) and my friend got the spinach ravioli pasta special. She said the vodka sauce was good, but the salmon on top was inconsistent (some dry, some fine). In general, I feel that the meals didn't have the same value as the prices... definitely overpriced. I guess that's what you get for a BYOB on Washington St. When we went to pay, they told us the credit card machine was broken and we had to pay cash. I offered to pay them with a check, and they said they could "call in" the card, which (suspiciously) took the exact same amount of time as just swiping a card. It seemed very disingenuous, and I would not come back here based on that experience.
2016-11-14,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants.  The food and service are both excellent.  If you go on a somewhat regular basis they do remember you and go the extra mile for you.  The meat lasagna and pasta al forno are amazing.  It's BYOB, great atmosphere and reasonable prices.  They always have a lot of specials.  Love this place!
2016-11-12,4,I have always been fond of this restaurant --- cute date spot, byob and good atmosphere.  In addition you can't really go wrong with anything you order here. They obviously bring complimentary bread but they also comp really great bruschetta!  We skipped appetizers tonight but for entrees we got the following : chicken parm with rigatoni my husband got .... I got the squid ink linguine with crabmeat and mushrooms in a pink vodka sauce (a special).   Both were great! This place never lets you down:)
2016-10-14,2,My feelings on this place have changed recently.  The past few experiences have been very average. The food is good, but probably not as good as other Hoboken Italian options. Of note, the wait staff is quick to try and turnover tables so it's not uncommon to feel rushed. Additionally, for the last 3 times we ate there, they have the played the "our credit card machine is broken, cash only" card.  We literally watched them swipe other credit cards just minutes before and by the third time, we now caught on to the game.  If they tell you the credit card machine is broken, give them a card anyway. The waiters won't even blink.  It's pretty low to try and take advantage of customers like that.  Or just go to another of the many Hoboken Italian restaurants.
2016-09-19,4,No idea how we managed to miss this gem on Washington St since moving to town. We do enjoy Cafe Michaelina but on Friday night the line was out the door and no hostess or staff in sight. Instead of waiting aimlessly for someone to appear I suggested walking up one block to try Trattoria. From the moment we walked up to the front door the service was impeccable! Greeted immediately by the manager. Mind you we were just two hungry kids with a bottle of wine looking for a BYOB spot. Did not expect the whole intimate and romantic ambiance but hey it worked out. Our server came to the table with a plate showcasing all the different pasta options and daily specials. Just be aware the specials are insanely overpriced and where they get you. Our dishes were specials at $35 each. We were just unaware that a special menu item would be $15 more than a regular dish.I opted for the seafood black linguine special with white wine and garlic sauce. This is hands down my favorite black linguine dish I've tried yet. My boyfriend got the cavatelli vodka sauce, if you like vodka sauce with a nice kick to it try this. The food is really good and portions are decent but price point per plate kind of hurts. If you stick to the regular menu items are around $17-$25.
2016-09-16,1,We ordered 3 fettuccine Alfredo with chicken, the quantity was very very small we didn't feel like we ate and the bill came $70 . Last time we eat here.
2016-09-01,4,The employees here are the absolute nicest people. They let us sit and eat on a late weeknight even though the kitchen was about to close. BYOB and homemade pasta, nothing can beat that. They also have excellent specials and you can sit outside!
2016-08-30,3,We were invited into this restaurant after looking at the menu on the sidewalk.  The pasta menu looked good, so we decided to try it.  It turns out that the food was good, but a little overpriced.  As a New Yorker, you grow to expect a certain experience for a pasta dish priced over 20 dollars.  This just wasn't it.
2016-08-27,5,My first time here -- we were a party of four, and, unanimously, we agreed it was an absolutely fabulous evening. From the greeting, to being seated where requested when made reservation, to the attentive and courteous service....and the FOOD -- absolutely amazing.  Huge portions, fabulous flavors.  The best meal I have had in a very long time! And, on top of it all, a BYO. Can't wait to go back. We live in Bergen County and are talking about it being our Saturday night place.
2016-06-12,1,Found this spot on YELP! Not sure why it has 4stars. Food was horrible. Service even worse & this restaurant is not clean. Found a hair in my app & shells in my entree. Silverware & glasses all dirty. Roberto the manager is very rude & presumptuous. Trust me Yelpers do not give this business your $ or time! So many better places in the area. Happy hunting!
2016-06-07,1,My fiancé and I were looking for a new Italian spot in Hoboken and while searching, came upon the Trattoria Saporito website which was offering an "anniversary special" Mon - Wed through June 30th (today is Tues June 7th). Being within the presumed advertising restrictions, we were excited to try any pasta for $15! We get there, settle in with our bottle of wine, and ask about the specials, however the anniversary deal was never mentioned. When we ask about it, we were told that it is no longer valid, that it was supposedly for the month of May only, but the owner "doesn't know how to take the advertisement down". I'm sorry, but that's not our fault. If you advertise it, you should abide by it - regardless of your less than par computer skills! Now that we had already opened our bottle of wine we decided to stay. I then ask about the "truffle corner" which was very nondescript. The waiter explained that the pasta with truffle comes with your choice of veal or scallops for $39. I asked for it without a meat option, but they said that the price would then be $34. So you are telling me that your scallops or veal are only worth $5?! Again, since I was in the mood for these seasonal truffles they said just came in I went for the $34 dish without meat, only to be served what is basically an alfredo - the truffles were barely evident if there at all. Needles to say, we'll never go here again, this place is a rip off and doesn't stand by their word!!
2016-06-04,4,Great little Italian restaurant in Hoboken!  We enjoyed eating outside and it was a beautiful night. The food was great and the complementary bruschetta was a nice touch.
2016-06-02,5,My all time favorite Italian place in Hoboken. They make their own pasta so it is always amazingly fresh! They always have so many new specials, and they never disappoint. Service is good, staff is friendly and beyond happy to explain anything on the menu in full detail, but the wait can be long on a Friday/Saturday for a table. They get really crowded for dinner so try and go early. Definitely highly recommend if you like true Italian food and BYOB nice plus!
2016-05-07,4,Came to the restaurant by a reccomendation from a former Hoboken local who only had wonderful things to say about the fod and service.My fiancee and I waited a few minutes to be seated and were quickly greeted by our waiter who described all of the specials for the evening. We ordered the fried calamari and ceaser salad and were given complimentary bruscetta which was simple but very flavorful.The calamari was perfect. Lightly fried, tender, and served with a well seasoned marinara sauce. Salad dressing was made in house. As for the entrees my fiancee ordered a pasta special which included a half lobster, scallops, and shrimp which he thoroughly enjoyed  (and only $36!). I ordered a pasta dish with tomato sauce and fried eggplant. The pasta tasted fresh and absorbed the sauce. Eggplant was tasty. I wouldn't order again mostly based on the fact there are many other dishes to try. We ordered chocolate gelato, ricotta cheesecake, and tiramisu for dessert. Gelato was by far the be at however we took the tiramisu to go and have yet to taste. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service. The restaurant was very busy up until we left around 10pm but I had to waive down the waiter every time I needed something. The owner however is beyond personable and I would go back just to see him. Will be going back!
2016-04-03,5,I love this place. The food is great.  I love that they have the option to have your meal made with fresh pasta. They always have great specials. The staff is friendly and helpful. They leave you alone and don't bother you too much while eating. The food is very consistent. I've never been disappointed. BYOB
2016-03-25,1,Beware of the specials. Average cost of a menu item 15/20....specials costs 2 times that. They don't tell you the price of the specials. You can go to a place with a full bar and pay the same as this place. If the food was worth it I would be quiet, but it's not that good.
2016-03-19,1,I have never felt so embarrassed or angry. I came in on a Friday evening and was sat right away the waiter came over poured my wine as I waited while my fiancé parked the car. He came in to join me we were read the specials..... That's where the night went from beautiful too terrible. After being read the specials I decided I wanted the Osso Buco - my waiter asked me if I was sure because the plate was $49. My fiancé and I I eat out 3-4 times a month - never have I once been asked am I sure - yes I have been made aware of a price but not like this.The appetizer that was described was prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella what arrived was a caprese salad with two slices of prosciutto. Next up - the veal osso Buco over risotto. The risotto tasted of dirty water and the veal no flavor. Listen-  every place has an off night , I picked around the meal- I was never asked how my meal was .... My fiancé order a pasta dish - neither of us was offered black pepper or cheese.Now the bill comes .... The waiter informs me gratuity has already been included , after watching the table next to us receive their bill ... Gratuity for them was NOT included. They charge my card the gratuity without my permission. So welcome to a PROFILING restaurant. If a place is going to automatically add gratuity the have to do it across the board. Will never  go back. The owner should be ashamed.
2016-03-03,3,I've been here many times over the last few years, for lunch and dinner, and the experience is always the same. It's solid, but unspectacular, Italian food. The dishes are straightforward Italian classics, and the prices are reasonable (especially the $16,99 lunch special that includes an appetizer and a main dish). It's BYOB, and they are very accommodating to larger groups, which  makes it a very solid bet for anyone looking to have a straightforward meal with a group where everyone can find something they would like.
2016-02-03,5,My favorite restaurant in Hoboken, such a perfect little hidden gem! Grab a bottle of your favorite red wine at the liquor store down the street because this place is BYOB only. The seafood pasta they make for me is unbelievable and has the perfect amount of spice. The serving size with shrimp, clams, mussels, and calamari is so generous I always have to box it up. My boyfriend swears by the farfalle with caviar and salmon. The lunch special here is unbeatable, also. Appetizer and an entrée for $16.  Did I mention they make all their own pasta? That, and there are always off-menu specials that they're running. Must-try
2016-01-23,5,Holy Canoli!!!! This place is good! Came here with my boss and a co-worker and was amazed. Then i tool my lady here for a date a few weeks later.  I felt like I was really Italian when i was eating there. Give it a shot, you will like the way you feel.
2015-12-22,2,My buddy was dead set on going here for lunch the other day, so I obliged. I had honestly never been a huge fan, but I figured I would give it another shot. I have been here on a weekend night and the wait seemed like forever, so I was happy to show up to an empty restaurant for lunch. They do a business lunch for $16.99 that includes one app and one entree per person. I was super confused, because they gave us a dinner menu too, but then told us that we couldn't order from that menu. Huh?! The menu is decent, a ton of pastas, a few meat options on one fish entree (tilapia). I ended up ordering an eggplant appetizer and their chicken Marsala. The eggplant was okay, I paired it with some marinara sauce and thought it tasted much better. It was 3 pieces of eggplant lightly dashed with olive oil and some cheese. Decent. The chicken Marsala was pretty good. It came with one piece of chicken, some mushrooms and either pasta or vegetables. I had it with the vegetables. Generic vegetables that often accompany chicken dishes at an Italian restaurant. My buddy ended up ordering calamari, it was pretty typical of calamari, the sauce was better than what I had remembered. He also ordered the risotto which came with shrimps and clams. I've gotta say, for the amount he raved about it, I thought it was a big disappointing. It was kind of bland, I expected better. Overall the food was average, exactly what I had remembered. Basic, average, generic Italian food. Nothing out of the ordinary, so as a foodie, I'm giving it two stars. I generally lean more towards Jersey City over Hoboken when I want a good meal. The BYOB thing can be awesome, but when you're waiting in line to sit, there's no bar which is a bummer. Service was decent.
2015-12-21,3,I still can't believe 2 little girls finished the whole bowl (twice of the size of our face) of pasta. That's how good it goes.I got the seafood mix (including lobster, scallop and shrimp) with angel hair noodles, it's one of the specials where the host will come out with a plate of raw materials and introduce. Pretty interesting. And it's hoboken, so don't forget to bring your own wine.
2015-12-14,1,1 star for the service, the food is 4 stars. Unfortunately I will never go back. We were a party of 6 and came early and stayed for the evening, ordering a ton of food throughout the night. At a  certain point we asked if it was OK that we were still there and they assured us it was. We asked if they could create a cheese plate as part of desserts and they brought a nice platter of cheese. When we got the bill (which was $$$$ from all the courses we ordered), they had charged us $40 for the cheese plate, the most expensive item on the bill. When we questioned it they said it was because we stayed all night and they could have asked us to leave. So we were overcharged on a cheese plate for staying at the table. I am very disappointed in them and unfortunately will never return after having several great experiences and delicious food there.
2015-12-12,5,This is my favorite place to eat in Hoboken!  I simply cannot get enough of the meat lasagna (not on the menu but normally a special).  Everything else I've had is delicious, including the buffalo mozz, calamari, seafood app (clans, mussels, shrimp), and cappellini with lobster in vodka sauce.  Many times they'll just make what you want, so just ask!
2015-12-01,4,The specials are a bit pricey- but the food is very good and BYOB makes it less expensive when compared to other restaurants in the area!
2015-10-20,5,This place is hands down the best Italian place in Hoboken. The service is great. They always have great seafood specials. Perfect atmosphere for a date or a girls night out - dimly lit and romantic!! The food is truly unbeatable!! Whenever I'm craving Italian, this is my spot. BYO too.
2015-10-13,1,Do yourself a favor and never come here. Went for an app (bufala mozz) and an entree (lobster ravioli, the special) to share with my date. Never. Again. Bufala was horrible. Any Hoboken corner deli offers superior mutz. The lobster ravioli had loads of bland sauce and little stale pieces of salmon. The damage - $66 for 1 app and 1 entree, with an automatic 20% gratuity for a party of 2. Wow, I have just been had. Thanks Saporito, you have brought Hoboken dining to an all-time new low.
2015-10-04,3,The reason I feel the need to give this restaurant three stars is because the food is very good. Although the meal me and two others had there last night was completely over priced. BEWARE OF SPECIALS THIS IS WHERE THEY OVERCHARGE!! We ordered the special it was capellini pasta with crab sauce.. It was 32 dollars for that dish!? I think it is absolutely ridiculous the price for that. Make sure to ask the price of the special you are interested in. I also ordered a pasta with just marinara sauce and shrimp and it went from 16 dollars to 26. They really know how to up charge here!!
2015-10-02,5,This is one of Hoboken's best restaurants.  The food is great and you can't go wrong with the specials but ask teh waiter as tehir menu is really quite good & reasonable.
2015-09-24,4,Came here on a recommendation for the best Italian food in the area - and it didn't disappoint! We sat in the outdoor area, and the staff was very courteous. Knocking down a star because our food took some time to come out, but that may just be because we were there pretty much right when they opened. I tried stuffed artichoke for the first time here too, and it was delicious!
2015-09-13,4,It gets super loud in here and the servers can be hard to understand but they have some incredible food. BYOB, free bruschetta, amazing vodka sauce. Lobster ravioli was delicious but skip the chicken bolognese.
2015-09-12,1,We didn't make it past the front door since the host (an older man) was rude and didn't seem like he wanted to seat us. There was outdoor seating available and he really didn't give us that option until the nicer gentleman working there mentioned it. And even then, the host told us with an attitude that if it rains, he can't do anything about it. With poor customer service, we decided to go elsewhere where we enjoyed a delicious meal across the street. Hopefully everyone else gets better customer service than us. I'm definitely not going to attempt to eat here again.
2015-08-18,3,Ok.  Not entirely thrilled about this place.  It is BYOB, so be prepared or they will suggest you go to the alcohol store down the street.  Seating outside has a great view, but the slant of the ground makes it a little uncomfortable to sit there and eat.  The waiter was check out.  He disappeared and looked confused when we asked questions about the menu.  I ordered a lasagna with mushrooms but it came with NO mushrooms.  I didn't even bother sending it back.  The coke I ordered was in a microscopic glass and full of ice.  The decor inside is sad. Cheap photos and cheap frames just for the sake of having something on the wall.  Not authentic at all.  Prob will not be back, but if I do I will definitely bring a LOT of alcohol.
2015-08-17,2,Just ok. We went on a Thursday night and felt rushed the entire time. No one Checked on us, food was middle of the road. Bruschetta and chicken parm were good but I wouldn't go back or recommend any time soon. Better options in Hoboken
2015-08-07,1,Where to begin...Went here with my mom. We sat down outdoors, which was very nice (but about the only nice thing of the evening). When the waiter came over he read us the specials, we were immediately hooked and each ordered one of the evening's specials. The waiter mentioned to us, "the specials might be a TAD over the price of the normal prices" and we did not think much of it as every meal on the menu was approx $15-20. I ordered a mushroom truffle pasta and my mom ordered a seared scallop pasta. All was going well until the meals arrived:-The scallops were NOT seared, as any foodie knows scallops have a slight tar to their faces as any SEARED meal does, these looked as though they were boiled- We mentioned it to the waiter, next thing we know the manager is at our table preaching about the proper cooking of searing of scallops, but as he walked away he rolled his eyes at the other waiter and made both my mother and myself very uncomfortable- We did not argue further as we wanted to just enjoy our meal, half way through our meal my mom saw that there were only 3, yes THREE scallops in her dish. WHAT?!- We ate what we could and asked for our receipt; $88 for 2 meals and one slice of cake.This means that my meal was $40 and my moms was $35. This is NOT a TAD higher than average prices, this is SUBSTANTIALLY higher than normal prices. And to be charge $35 for a pasta dish with THREE scallops- we've both traveled around Italy and were extremely shocked and disappointed that we had picked a place that was such a rip-off, of all the nice places in Hoboken.All in all, please take our word and approach this place with caution, they will take advantage of your well-mannered behavior and you will end up feeling screwed rather than full.
2015-08-07,5,Best bruschetta I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I really enjoyed the whole meal, I had the cheese ravioli with a meat sauce, had tiramisu for dessert... but that bruschetta.... oh. my. goodness. I can not stop thinking about it!
2015-08-05,5,I can't say enough about the folks and food at Trattoria Saporito. I recently hosted a birthday party for my wife with 20 guests and everything was perfect. The food is outrageously high quality, authentic Italian; mussels, clams, carpaccio, 2 pastas, fantastic entrees and trays of assorted desserts and little extras. The staff was perfect, friendly, and attentive. It is great that it is BYOB, especially with a large group. I had the wine delivered early and everything was chilled and waiting. 2-20 people! You must go here! Best in Hoboken!
2015-08-01,1,Mediocre service followed by the 20% tip that the waiter gifted himself ruined it for me. When asked why the 20%, I was told "That's what we do" .  They just lost themselves a customer .
2015-08-01,5,Never had a bad meal here. The staff and owners are   very kind. Byob always a plus. :)
2015-07-01,3,A very simple observation for this fine Italian eatery.  They used to have an incredibly priced lunch special: $10.95 for an appetizer and an entre.  The most unbeatable deal in Hoboken, and I always wondered why the place was usually empty at lunchtime.  There are a lot of restaurants in this area, and one would think that the business crowd would fill up the place, with those kind of prices.  Well, Trattoria Saporito couldn't fill even a quarter of their tables with this deal, so what did they do?  They increased the price of the lunch special to $16.95!  They figure: if we can't attract people with the $10.95 deal, maybe they'll come for the $16.95 deal.  (And of course, the place is still largely empty at lunchtime.)It's always packed for dinner, however!
2015-06-21,4,Very traditional & reasonably priced. They seem to have several dishes made around seafood..My wife and I were immediately greeted by a server who displays and explains ( in a broken English accent ) the home made pasta's and sauces..I ordered the Spaghetti alla carbonara . (spaghetti with eggs, bacon ,and fresh peas in a cream sauce) which was excellent and my wife the Lobster filled ravioli in vodka sauce topped with bits of Salmon.  All the pasta is home made! and served al dante, unless requested otherwise..Quaint atmosphere and very comfortable padded chairs, open fairly late into the night.  No reason not to return if ever back in Hoboken.
2015-06-20,5,Truly some of the best Italian dishes I've had in Hoboken, which is high praise considering all of the options in town. A bit overpriced, especially for some of the specials, but the osso bucco is ridiculously good.I'm surprised to see other reviewers here complain about service, as that is definitely a strong point for Saporito. They don't take reservations, and every time I come here they make every effort to seat our party ASAP. And even when we keep our table a bit too long, they don't make a big stink about it.
2015-06-19,2,I wanted to like this place but it just wasn't up to snuff. Everything was bland.  We ordered the stuffed artichoke and the breading was soggy.  The broth was very bland.  It's a simple dish to make and its simply better when I make it at home.  Next I ordered chicken cacciatore.  As soon as it came out, I knew I would be disappointed.  It was tiny medallions of chicken breast.  Anyone who know Italian food knows that cacciatore should be on the bone skin on chicken for flavor.  This tasted like boiled chicken and the red sauce was bland to boot.  The pastas the others ordered were satisfactory but nothing to write home about. Stick to the pastas here.  BYOB is nice and the servers were attentive.  If you want a good Italian meal however, this is simply is not the spot.
2015-06-07,5,After spending ages searching for an open restaurant on Washington street at 10:30pm on a Friday, we luckily came across this gem! The homemade pasta was authentic and fresh. HIGHLIGHT: the mushroom tortellini served in a rich, creamy sauce was incredible. Pasta portions were big, around $20 each, and an entrée could easily two people. But because we ridiculously hungry, our party of three cleaned up three large entrées. Great service from the Italian waiters! Even though we arrived 30 minutes before closing, we still received piping hot entrees within 15 minutes of ordering. And the perfect cozy ambience complete with Venetian paintings makes you feel like you're in Italy.
2015-05-31,5,I went here for dinner for the first time with 10 of my family members visiting from out of town. You can't beat BYOB and who doesn't love Italian food. The food was so fresh and delicious! They give you free bruschetta as an appetizer, but I'd also highly recommend the fried calamari it was by far the best I've ever had! All of the pasta is homemade and delicious!! My family was so happy they spoke about it all week and was better than some of the "top chef" places we went in NYC. I will definitely be going back soon!
2015-05-29,1,Well, aside from the rude owner that sat me in a chair alone on the sidewalk like a public shaming because the rest of my party wasn't there, I'm pretty upset about the cost of our meal and how completely blindsided we were. Average pasta dish on the menu is about $18, and when they announce their myriad of specials they do not mention prices. Well, each of the 4 of us ordered a special, and little did we know they were each $35!! I mean, if we were ordering steak maybe that's fine, but we had pasta dishes!!! A casual night out quickly turned into a major expense and considering the experience with the waitstaff all night I am just appalled. You will get MUCH more for your money elsewhere. My dish was straight up creme, and no one else at the table was completely satisfied (too much sauce all around). Save your money and go elsewhere.
2015-05-24,1,We ordered a chicken dish and returned it because the chicken taste bad. The owner charged us half price for the returned dish. Stupid man. You just lost a customer. I will never return.
2015-05-19,1,I have only eaten at this restaurant once, and would not typically write a review but my experience was horrible (which is unfortunate because the food was actually delicious).We ordered our food which we found to be great! Towards the end of our meal we noticed a cockroach crawling under the table across from us. After we saw that, we stopped eating. To make it worse, I had to knock a cockroach OFF MY SHOULDER as we waited for the check. It did not seem to surprise the waiter - he just picked it up with a napkin and brought it to the back of the restaurant. Needless to say I will never be going back there.
2015-05-16,5,I was so pleasantly surprised by this place! The food was nothing short of delicious, and reasonably priced. We had the grilled eggplant and calamari app.  I had the black fettuccini with crabmeat in vodka sauce. So wonderful!!!Will definitely come here again.  And with BYOB- can you beat it?
2015-05-06,4,Was there on Sat nite nice place & food was good. Thought the special "Lobster & pastawas somewhat pricey. Did not know the price until we got the bill. Would go back.
2015-04-30,2,**********MUST READ********** My wife, son and I went there on Sunday April 26th. First the menu is limited and there is a reason for this and the reason is called "specials".When your server stands at your table and rattles off 10 minutes of specials you know that means trouble, especially when the do not say the price.These specials are the same everyday. I did not want chicken parm, I can get that in a pizzeria. I asked then for chicken sorrentino which any restaurant or pizza place makes.The waiter said that would be a special. Are you kidding me? So I ordered pasta fagioli for soup.$8.50 for a small bowl. I went with a Risotto with Shrimp and clams, 2 shrimp and the tiniest clams on this earth.$19..50. My son ordered lobster ravioli and it was a special.$23.95 for raviolis. To top it off my wife ordered a stuffed artichoke. Holy cow $16.95. The maître d" was very eager to get us in but could give a crap after that. Go to a restaurant that has a liquor license and you will save money. So many in Hoboken to choose from. We will never go there again. DC
2015-04-22,4,We came for dinner last Saturday for 5 people, they don't take reservations but if you have a party and call ahead, they can usually tell you what time to come in order to best accommodate you! They are extremely helpful :) also it's BYO! Portions are pretty big so definitely plenty to share if you're getting appetizers as well.They start you off with complimentary bread and bruschetta, so if you don't have a big appetite you may not need to order an app. We started with a special appetizer of buffala mozzarella and tomatoes with prosciutto and spinach - big and amazingggg. Next I got the cheese ravioli with vodka sauce (it didn't come that way on the menu but I asked and they easily made that combination for me!). It was pretty good, but I have to say my friend's Tortellini Della Nonna was outstanding in comparison - he got both meat and cheese tortellini with mushrooms in a truffle cream sauce with mushrooms. It was by far the best dish at our table, and I highly recommend any of their tortellini dishes. My boyfriend also really loved his zuppa di pesce with black and white linguini. We didn't have room for dessert, but maybe next time! I would definitely return, especially this summer with the outdoor seating :) and I will be ordering the tortellini della Nonna!
2015-04-15,3,I really wanted to like this place.I went on Saturday night with my husband and another couple.  The place is cute enough inside, not the best ambiance but not the worst either.The service was, for lack of a better word, odd.  They rush through a bunch of specials and expect you to remember everything which is annoying.  The waiter was short with us and seemed annoyed when we needed a minute to decide our orders.  The specials (which some in our party ordered) ran from about $25-30.  It's a BYOB, we brought wine which they opened promptly but then only filled 3 out of 4 of our water glasses.  We ordered a couple appetizers which were practically thrown in front of us.  When we were finished with our apps, they grabbed our plates quickly, but then threw our utensils back on the table (including serving spoons from the appetizers). I'm sorry, but if I'm paying 20+ bucks per entree, you can bring me another fork!  Because of this, the table got pretty dirty fast and was cramped.The food was fine.  It was good but not great.  I ordered clams linguine which I personally thought could have used a little more garlic.  They use fresh clams but don't put chopped clams in the sauce like other restaurants (this may be more authentic but I personally enjoy a mix of chopped clams and clams in their shells).  Everyone else ordered specials which they said were OK.  Not special, not awful.Halfway during the meal, the lights starting flickering and they began blasting birthday music.  This was cute at first but after a minute and a half of blaring music, it got old.  All in all, it was just an odd experience.  I wouldn't take a date there, they won't be overly impressed.  The food was fine, but overpriced for quality/service.
2015-04-12,4,Came here last night and definitely wasn't expecting to love the meal as much as I did! First off it's byob, which is great. The restaurant is very cozy, with that being said, if you're coming on the weekend, you'll probably have to wait to be seated. But the host opened our bottle while we waited at the tables outside of the restaurant, so the wait didn't feel too much like a wait ;) When we were seated, the waiter told us a list of specials which all sounded amazing. So I got the cavatelli with chicken and shiitake mushrooms in a vodka sauce. SO yummy! And my bf got the seafood pasta with lobster sauce. The dish came with lots of lobster, fresh shrimp and scallops. Also delicious! Definitely loved the food, ambiance and service.
2015-04-10,4,My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary this past year after I tried it out first with some friends prior. It's really great Italian food. The food is very fresh, the service is great and being able to BYOB makes it really affordable. Would highly recommend!
2015-04-06,2,Maybe I should have expected highway robbery in the greater NYC metro area, but I just can't justify pasta for three people at $160. Upon review of the menu you may notice that dishes are priced reasonably. Well, don't fall for it gentle reader. They definitely get you in other ways. Take, for instance, the $9 bowl of soup. Actually, soup is a generous term, as it was a few tortellini floating in broth. There was nary a carrot or onion to be found. A word for the wise-ask what the prices of the specials are before ordering.  Otherwise, you will be stuck paying for a $33 plate of pasta. The real kick in the ass of this whole ordeal was the soda.  $3.75 per cup of soda, no free refills.  WTF. And, our douchey waiter insisted we drank four sodas each (not the case) and gave me a 'tude when I asked him to fix it.The denouement of this whole shit show is that they count themselves i for a 20% tip.  And it's not like we went during peak hours with a huge party.  The was 3 of us at 4:30pm. Not cool. And really, what's the motivation to not be a dick if you're going to make 20% anyway?Our dinners were good, but not $50 a person good. That's just silly.
2015-03-15,1,BUYER BEWARE!  if you value your money, do not come here because this place will try and squeeze every $ out of your pocket.  NEVER stepping foot in that place again.  absolutely no respect for clients.  read some of the reviews below, because it appears we weren't the first to get swindled and there are many cases of this. our group of 4 came here on a recommendation. the food was "meh", pasta was mediocre at best.  we had pasta alla giullia - bucatini with eggplant and a TON of tomato sauce, which tasted straight out of the jar.  my friends had pasta carbonara, which came with spaghetti.  first of all, waaaaay too creamy. overload for sure.  since we had two orders, one of my friends requested fettucini instead of spaghetti, which cost $4.  $4 to change out the pasta?!?!  that should have been an indication of things to come.  anyway, we ordered some sparkling water for our meal; however, shortly after, the water server in his haste to refill water glasses, simply poured tap water over it.  free of charge.  when we noted the mistake, he took away the glass, brought a fresh one and poured tap water in it.  WTF!?!  no offer to refill the sparkling water at all.  second red flag.  we made it through our dishes after which our waiter asked about desert.  no menu - just rattled it off as if we should be remembering the laundry list of items, which was quite difficult with the loud tacky music in the background.  anyway, we finish up our meal and bottle of wine (BYOB mind you) and got ready for the check.  to our surprise it was a bit out of the range we expected (especially since the place is BYOB and the prices seemed "reasonable").  we found why after inspecting the bill.  we were charged $10 extra for the appetizer (sold to us as "family style") since the waiter said there was 2 couples and so he gave us extra.  without asking or mentioning a peep, of course.  our tap-water pellegrino, of course, was on the bill.  as was a 20% tip....for a party of 4, that was probably the most surprising part - especially since no one said a word to us about that, nor was it noted on the menu as in most establishments that respect their clients.  aside from that, we had a big, obnoxious arrow drawn in sharpie pointing at the tip (assuming calling it out for us to ensure we understand what we're obligated to) and a note that said "cash only".  no one ever said anything about the card machine being broken either during the course of the dinner or when the check was presented to us.  I don't need an apology, but a note to your clients would be nice.  apparently, not so in this place.  anyway, we don't typically do this but we asked our waiter to clarify some of the charges.  after saying he would, he disappeared and never appeared at our table again.  so we asked a different waiter to see if he can find our waiter, after which the douche of a "manager" showed up explaining to us the charges and such.  forget the extra appetizer charges, the watered down Pellegrino, the $11 per desert (off the rattled off menu) our biggest contention was the tip, especially after the obvious lack of service at this place.  his explanation:  99% of visitors to Hoboken restaurants are tourists and he needs to add the tip.  HUH?  why do you need to mandate a tip on tourists??  and second of all, I live in the area and Hoboken is one place that is NOT known for tourists, especially given the SINGLE hotel in town.  seriously!?!?!  Obvously this guy thinks his clients are idiots.  after exchanging some words, we paid what we were obligated and left. like i said - never again.  if you want good (and i mean good) Italian food, there are plenty of options in the area.  save your money and your aggravation for a place that cares about their clients (and having them come back).
2015-03-15,1,Food is ok, nothing to rave about.   The reason I am writing this review is to confirm for everyone the 1 star reviews that are here on yelp.  All are spot on.  This place will try to get every penny out of your wallet, keep it close to you.   I went there with a group of 4 because our friends picked the place.  Did not read the reviews before going. My mistake.    I will start with the end cause that is when the bill arrived, placed on the table with a big, "CASH ONLY" in black marker with an arrow to the tip line.   No notice ahead of time that the machine was down or anything no excuse me nothing.   And a 20% tip added in automatically.   They charged us $40.00 for a "family style" appetizer of seafood.  We ordered 1 for the table but the waiter said they charged us for 2 because there were 4 of us.  I complied and said we only ordered 1 but he said the gave us a deal and normally its less food for $30 and he gave us twice the seafood for $40.  I told him he should ask and not make decisions for us.  We called over the manager and he started telling me that water was spilled on his credit card machine and that he can't change the tip because it has been there for 15 years, blah blah blah and that he has so many tourists coming in and they put the tip automatically.  What a LIAR!!!  There is 1 hotel in hoboken so there are no tourists.  Even if there were tourists you should not steal money from them, or locals either.  I asked him if he knows what the word "Gratuity" means?  he did not respond.  My friend had to walk out to the ATM in the rain and get cash.   We paid and left.  To my amusement upon my return home I saw all the reviews of how this place steals money from their customers, not only me.  There was no water spilled on the cash machine.   Read the reviews and make the decision for yourself but not worth the hassle.  There are many nice places in Hoboken that don't try to steal your hard earned money.   BEWARE!oh not to mention a $4 charge my friend got for switching pastas from spaghetti to fetuccni, $11.00 canoli, and $8.00 for Pellegrino, which the waiter poured tap water over in our glasses.   The prices seem decent on the menu but once they start stealing with their specials and charges you will pay like you never paid before.
2015-03-04,4,Ever since I moved to Hoboken a few months ago, I've been wanting to try Trattoria Saporito out. I finally had the chance to this Valentine's day and it was a really nice experience. I'm not sure if on a normal day they take reservations, but they didn't for Valentine's day (which ended up working out fine!). We only had to wait 25 minutes on one of the busiest days of the year so we weren't upset at all.Since there isn't any room to wait inside, they agreed to call us when the table was ready so we got to walk around the streets of Hoboken for a bit which was nice (but probably wouldn't be too fun on a rainy night.)Once we were sat, we were quickly greeted and our wine was opened and chilled. Our food was brought out in a timely fashion and was delicious! I got the penne vodka with chicken and he got the spaghetti alla carbonara. The portions were very generous so we both took home leftovers.Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and will certainly be heading back!
2015-02-23,5,I dream about that chicken parm. So dang good.
2015-02-19,3,Trattoria is a cute reasonably priced restaurant.  The staff is extremely sweet and really makes you feel like you are a part of their family.  It's a BYOB which is amazing and the pasta is made fresh!
2015-02-07,4,Excellent pasta and fish.  Small place that was a little loud, but well worth visiting. I will go back next time I'm in Hoboken.
2014-11-11,3,I had last been to  Trattoria Saporito over five years ago, but remembered enjoying it and continued to refer others to the delightful Italian café.  A Groupon deal drew me back to this intimate space, and, for that, I am grateful.  The décor was nothing impressive, and there was no bar, but the food certainly was tasty.Our deal included a beverage, so we each requested a simple seltzer with lime.  The citrus slice had a browning peel, which was off-putting.  Our attention was quickly diverted to the tasty Italian bread and heavenly tomato bruschetta, both compliments of the house.  My Chicken Pizzaiola entrée was portioned on the smaller side, but was just enough to fill my growling belly.  The chicken had been pounded extremely thin, and the sweet, peppery red sauce was robust in flavor.  My side of sautéed spinach was cooked in the perfect amount of garlic and olive oil, allowing it to maintain some body and avoid extra sogginess.Tratttoria Saporito might not have been the fanciest dinner in town, but the food was comforting and flavorful - definitely worthy of 3.5 stars.
2014-11-06,5,Beat Italian in Hoboken no joking!!!  Homemade pasta with huge variety. Northern "rustic" style with a staff straight from the homeland. Only drawback is no liquor license but then again u save money bringing your own wine. The food keeps you coming back!!!
2014-10-13,5,Homemade pasta with crab sauce was absolutely delicious. From the moment you walk in you are treated like royalty. I live the big plate of the various pastas to show you. Bring your own alcohol is a big plus.
2014-10-09,5,Wonderful authentic Italian restaurant! I loved that they feature about 10 specials every night. I had the cappellini with crab in a vodka sauce and it was absolutely amazing. The place is BYOB, has great service and atmosphere!
2014-10-07,5,This is probably the most "fancy" reasonably priced Italian place in Hoboken. Ideal for date settings. My boyfriend and I LOVE their bruschetta! The chefs come and show you the pastas of all their specials for the night, plus they have a great menu. Definitely recommend this place! Also, the best part, it's also BYOB!
2014-10-02,4,Often times, I find that BYOB spots end up serving better food and that is certainly true here.  The food was terrific.My appetizer was eggplant prepared with ricotta cheese on top.  It was good, but the real highlight was my entree.  The special that day was snapper made with capers and broccoli rabe.  It was amazing!  The one dish alone convinced me that I will have to come back.
2014-09-28,4,i've never written a review but this place has the most amazing italian food and i'm italian. it's byob and the pasta is all home made, awesome flavor's and healthy size portions
2014-09-23,3,We got the Seafood risotto, osso bucco special ($50), and a pasta special with chicken and mushroom for entries. The Osso bucco was definitely the best dish but not worth $50 in my opinion. I felt the pasta felt hard and did not taste like fresh pasta. For dessert we had tiramisu, limoncello cake, and pistachio gelato. The limoncello cake was definitely the best of the desserts. I felt like I have made better tiramisu and the gelato tasted like Turkey hill ice cream and did not have a real pistachio flavor. I was not happy with the service. It was hard to.understand the manager when he was telling the specials because of his thick Italian accent. And he seemed very annoyed when we asked him to repeat our explain dishes.  We also brought a white wine but were given ordinary water glasses...Which was fine except the waiters started pouring water in the wine glasses instead of our water glasses.
2014-09-13,4,I looooove the food here!! Staff is awful though, very strange people, and it is expensive but it is worth it for time to time
2014-09-11,2,Been here a few times, and have never been impressed with their food. The most recent time, was on a groupon deal, and received the worst service I have ever experienced. Prices a bit higher than their competitors, and their food is inferior. Won't be back with so many other better options close by.
2014-09-07,2,Absolutely terrible service. Completely overpriced. 36 dollar pasta dishes that were mediocre to say the least. Not impressed okay quality meals; pasta was fresh but totally not worth the price.
2014-09-03,1,The price of lunch menu on their website is 10.95, but the actual price is 16.95. The Italian guy said it is from when they first opened the restaurant, and that his cousin in Italy hasn't updated the website!!!  We decided to give this place a chance anyway and it was a mistake. They charged us a 20% tip (we were two) and did not offer a possibility to change it. The food was very mediocre ((I've worked in many restaurants in Italy and have tried good Italian food before -  this place was nothing special). The lunch was definitely not worth 16.95 per person, especially not in Hoboken where all nearby places have better deals and use more honest strategies to attract customers (with $7 tip we ended up paying almost $44 for the two of us for a very regular lunch, which is almost $20 more than we were planning to spend).
2014-08-27,5,I've been reading the other reviews and think there must be a space warp in Hoboken -- or some link to a dark parallel universe. My wife, daughter and I were visiting New York last week and decided on a whim to check out Hoboken. We literally stumbled in to this restaurant for an early lunch on an overcast Tuesday (I think my wife had seen a good review on an foodie website) and proceeded to have one of the best Italian meals we've ever had. Ever. And I'm including Rome, Tuscany and the poshest restaurants in a dozen cities in that comparison. Astonishingly good food, served with just the right amount of casual but attentive service. This wasn't just italian-flavored stuff, this was perfectly prepared fish, pasta and salads. Whoever was in the kitchen knew the precise second to stop cooking my branzino which arrived hot, perfectly tender and flavorful (the balance of herbs, capers and lemon wasn't overpowering, but found the music in the fish). In fact, every single thing they brought to the table -- from the delicious warm bread to the baked clams, several salads, exquisitely cooked pasta and summer-perfect desert -- was a delightful expression of inspired cooking and gracious hospitality. Maybe we got lucky (and, no, we certainly didn't try to use a Groupon) but I know for certain that we will be returning to this place every chance we get. We had a perfect meal there. All I can say is Grazie! (If we go back for dinner, I'll remember to bring some wine. As I recall, the place is BYOB)
2014-08-26,3,My family and I came in on a sunday about 7:30pm. The four of us got a table, immediately and the service was good. The food, I must say was excellent, ranging from the salad to my dish, past with crabmeat in a vodka sauce! The only caveat was the following: as you walk in there are stickers on the door displaying all the major credit cards that are accepted in the establishment. When the bill came, handwritten on the bottom was "CASH ONLY". It would have been nice if this was stated before we ordered! What happened to all the patrons who didn't carry cash with them? I would make a return trip, though.
2014-08-22,3,Came back in service was not like before. He over charged us this time after 3 visits and added his own tip of 20% . I usually like to tip according to service and get ticked off when you come back and get bamboozled on the price and I only believe in the server tipping you when your party is over 8 ppl. This time it was my husband and teen nephew and my myself. That stopped me from coming in honestly. Lost customers because there's so many Italian authentic spots in the area. Hate to leave bad comments but you can see before I gave them 4 stars.
2014-08-18,4,I took my Mom here who was visiting from Michigan. She wanted Italian so I searched and I chose to go here. It was my first time too. The ambiance was calm and relaxing. We went for late lunch on a Monday and sat outside. The weather was perfect. The manager was a sweetheart. He gave as a complimentary bruschetta which was amazing. The waiter could not speak English but he was polite. The food was amazing. I had the salmon with mushroom abd mushroom sauce with a side of spinach abd my mom had some kind of a seafood pasta but the sauce........it was the BOMB! Never had that before. I loved it and I'm not even into pasta. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it.
2014-07-27,3,I used Yelp reviews to find this restaurant. They were mostly accurate. I wasn't crazy about it, but it was just ok. The tables are jammed together tightly making it hard to move about. The wait staff was efficient. Maybe too efficient as we felt like they were rushing us. They went through the motions but we felt like they really didn't care if we were there or not as long as they got paid. The noise level was astronomical. Imposible to carry on any meaningful conversation, or hear the waiter's specials. The food was average. I had chicken marsala. The sauce was very thin but flavorable. There were two very small chicken breasts and a small side of pasta. My wife's eggplant and pasta dish was tasty and plentiful. All in all, an average dining experience. They had us out of there and someone else in our seats in 45 minutes, so don't expect a relaxing evening.
2014-07-22,1,Came here on a groupon deal food was ok but I actually received half a chicken cutlet and a spoonful of spaghetti. I will never understand this the point of a groupon is to show people how great your restaurant is and make them come back but NEVER again. Not even close to the value of the groupon and I left the restaurant starving. Truly ridiculous.
2014-07-03,2,OK, the food is great. I cannot deny it or go against the obvious fact that this pace is old school.Let me explain my issue I experienced now twice. I have enjoyed two great dinners here, however they have been over shadowed by an awful owner that tries to get every dollar from you. My previous visit, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the specials, which I had asked the price of before, only to be charged 48 dollars for a seafood dish. I figured this was a misunderstanding this time and just chalked it up to that. I came back tonight thinking last time was a fluke, me and the girlfriend ordered some food and enjoyed our night. Then the bill came, and I thought it looked weird. I paid and then asked for the menu, as it turns out, I was over charged by 20 dollars when I explained it to the "owner" that it was an error. He told me that he kept the place open for me, with 5 other tables there,  so he gave me prices for July 4th on July 3rd? He then realized I noticed what he did and apologized. Too little too late.  I can't be upset on the service or the food, but the owner ruined it again. I will never go back because of him. If you go here, please check your bill! the owner will try to scam you.
2014-06-21,5,Came to Hoboken for quick late lunch. Saporito had space available and friendly service. Risotto Frutti di Mare is delicious. Complimentary Bruschetta! Will be back!
2014-06-18,4,Some of the best Italian food in Hoboken. This is one of the go to spots my boyfriend and I have when we can agree on a place to have dinner. The complimentary bruschetta at the beginning of the meal is always delicious, and we get the beef carpaccio every time we go!  BYOB makes it even better.My only complaint is they sometimes give you an attitude when you come in with a groupon.  I've been there plenty of times with and without a groupon though and the food has always been delicious!
2014-06-14,3,Not bad.  Good quality Italian food.  I had the typical (chicken parm), just to see if they can make that dish quality.  They can.  I'll say that this place was packed on a Wednesday night, which says something.
2014-06-03,4,Had the linguini & clams the 1st time and it was delicious! Went back recently on a Monday and was super excited that almost all of the specials were with Vodka sauce (my favorite), got the lobster ravioli. my boyfriend got the chicken martini (which is basically chicken francaise) and both dishes were delicious and a decent portion size. The calamari appetizer was also very good and larger than your average app. Service was great and I also received the complimentary bruschetta on both visits so that must be their thing, cute! Ohhh and the BEST part, BYOB! :) will definitely be back more often
2014-05-22,3,3.5 stars. I really liked it. We came for my friend's birthday and the waiter was very accommodating. We wanted a seafood appetizer so they made us a huge platter of mussels, shrimp, clams and calamari for 7 people. It was delicious. We also got tomato and fresh moz salad that was good too. Then the waiter came by with a platter of about 10 types of uncooked pasta. He described each one to us and told us a special that was served with each. I got the angel hair with lump crab and vodka sauce and it was amazing. At the end they brought the birthday girl a piece of chocolate mouse cake. They included 20% tip on our check and it came to a little over $360 for 7 people. That was about $50 per person (or $60 since the birthday girl didn't pay). I thought it was kind of pricy for being a byob but the food was worth it. I'd come back!
2014-05-09,3,I came in with a groupon after reading the reviews so I was prepared to pay the tax and included 20% tip in cash. It's a stupid policy as they take credit cards normally and I definitely would have been annoyed if I didn't know about it ahead of time. Unlike a lot of people who reviewed this place, I was not turned off by the fact that I had to make a reservation to use my groupon as most groupons specify in the fine print that you must make one to use it.I was a little disappointed that the calamari was not remotely crispy but the rest of the food was really good and the portions were not overwhelming. The service was also really spectacular. My only major complaint is the awful birthday music. There were three birthdays in the hour that I was there and they blared terrible birthday music, which goes on and on even after you think it's going to end. That absolutely destroyed the ambiance.
2014-05-07,1,If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The first time I went, myself and my entire party (4 of us total) got food poisoning, assumedly from the calamari. Things happen, of course, so I hadn't quite written it off yet. The second time that I went, I purchased a Groupon deal. The fine print stated that Groupon patrons needed a reservation to use the deal, so we obediently called to make our reservation, at which point the hostess informed us that they DID NOT EVER accept reservations, and specifically said that Groupon holders were first-come, first-serve each night. We finally arrived to a near-empty restaurant and sat down, informing who we believe was the owner that we had a Groupon deal to use. He asked if we had a reservation, and, a little taken aback, we explained that we did not. He said "no reservation, no Groupon." We further elaborated that we had tried to make a reservation and explained that we were told that they did not accept reservations; he said that he had "been there all day," and there was "no way" that she would have told us that. He went on to call us liars, despite the fact that we all were remarkably patient and polite to him, and was unapologetic about both the situation and his own atrocious behavior. We left and went to Pita Grill next door (which was wonderful). I will never return to this place. I swear that I've never been treated like this at any place, let alone one that relies on its customers to survive.
2014-04-22,5,Delicious! Home made pasta and BYOB, a real Italian can appreciate that! Only been once but can't wait to go back.
2014-04-20,3,I came here with my two girlfriends on a Wednesday night to celebrate our friend coming back from Peru. Our experience was good, but not great.So, since we were obviously catching up and gabbing away, we were taking a while to order, which wasn't a huge deal since this place wasn't THAT busy - I mean, it was only Wednesday. So we ordered fried calamari as an appetizer, and asked the waiter to give us a few more minutes for our entree order... So we eventually decided and closed our menus, and waited... Then waited some more... Then finally we got the waiter back over and placed our entree orders just as our appetizer was coming. Sadly, the calamari was really tough. We each enjoyed our entrees, however. I ordered the gnocchi special, which were perfectly cooked. The sauce was full of flavor and herbs and coated the gnocchi like a delicious, creamy blanket. I literally couldn't stop eating it and devoured the whole dish. One other annoyance: the decibel level when they blast their birthday song over the speaker system. It was a bit much, and that night while we were there FOUR different groups of people celebrated their birthdays. I get that staff doesn't want to sing the birthday song, but that was a little excessive. Other than the service mishap toward the beginning, the waitstaff was kind and attentive for the remainder of our meal. There are so many good Italian restaurants in the area though, I don't know if I'll be back.
2014-04-20,5,I have never given five stars, but this place definitely deserved it. We ended up here after running into problems getting a table for a party of six. They sat us right away with smiles. We received complimentary bruschetta which was delicious. Four of us at the table ordered one of the many specials for the night, which was lobster, scallops and shrimp with angel hair in a lobster bisque sauce. Amazing. The presentation was great, the portion was huge and tasted fabulous. The restaurant is BYOB so make sure to bring lots of wine! I also see this place on Groupon a lot, so I will be buying one and returning soon!
2014-04-08,5,We come here specifically for the clams , eggplant parm, & gnocchi .. Absolutely to die for and the service is top notch .. This place is a local gem and will stay coming back here
2014-04-05,1,We used a groupon deal and they were extremely rude about it. Wouldn't go there again, not worth it.
2014-03-28,2,Bad bad bad first impression for this restaurant.  Came to this restaurant with a groupon, however since we didn't have a reservation, they refused to honor the groupon. The restaurant was empty and i even mentioned, can i call right now for a reservation tonight, and was told NO.  We asked the waiter to speak to the manager or owner, and he advised that they would let us use the value of the groupon towards the check.  (the value of a groupon never expires, only the deal can, so this was them not doing any favors.)  The food was just alright, and due to this bad first impression, if I want BYOB italian in Hoboken, I will be going back to Cafe Michelina, Margaritas or Johnny Pepperoni next time.
2014-03-21,3,The food was very good and of course, BYOB is great. However, the service was really disappointing. There is no real space at the entrance of the restaurant so getting your name on the list is a bit chaotic, especially because the host is typically nowhere to be found. We experienced a lot of waiting around in a cramped area with a lot of people.The wait took much longer than expected and it really didn't seem like they were following the order of the list; overall, it was just really disorganized.I would recommend the food but would probably suggest going on a weeknight to try to avoid the chaos of being seated with the weekend crowd.
2014-03-18,1,Unfortunately, have to leave a negative review specifically for my experience using a Groupon. I have been to this restaurant before as a regular customer, and was very happy with the food and service. However, with a Groupon- totally different (and very poor) experience. A few major issues:1. We called to make a reservation twice, both times a few days before we were planning on dining. We were refused a reservation, until we tried a third time and called one week prior. Apparently, there are only so many open Groupon tables per day, which is very limiting and I've never experienced that at other restaurants before when using a Groupon deal. 2. The waitstaff rushed our order, telling us that the appetizer order and the entree order must be given together. When we were still eating our appetizers, the entrees were brought to the table and we were forced to rush and finish the apps.3. One of the four entrees was not as described, and not eaten. The waiter never checked on the meals after they were delivered.4.  After requesting to speak to a waiter, the waiter laughed at the concern of the dish that was not as ordered and refused to remake it, or offer any other option to make us happy with the dish.5. The check was marked "Must pay balance in Cash" and the gratuity was entered at 20%- something that has never been done before until we came in with a Groupon.6. We asked to speak to the manager.  The owner, when told about the problem with the one order, only indicated he would speak to staff. No replacement or adjustment was offered, so one of our party left hungy and unhappy.7. The waiter brought back the bill and claimed that instead of $31 in cash, only $11 was in the billfold.  This was not true, and made us all very uncomfortable.Overall, I wouldn't come to this restaurant again after the experience we had.
2014-03-11,4,How much Italian could it get.... italian decor, the waiters with a heavy Italian accent and of course the great Italian food. Tables are served with bruschetta which is spectacular.  We were a party of 4 and all of us and all ordered different pastas and none of us had a complaint. You could tell the sauce is fresh and made with love. I wished they took reservations but this is your local Italian restaurant....
2014-01-24,1,It's absolutely rude to judge a restaurant by it's sh*tty interior. But in this case, it's completely appropriate. I'd rather pee into a fresh can of spaghetti-O's, sprinkle some d*ck cheese, and slowly chew on it. It's shocking that people have actually enjoyed their food. If I were Italian, I'd be insulted.Their Aglio E Olio had a 2-inch soup base in a bowl with a diameter of 8 inches...and it tasted like clam. Their pasta didn't seem fresh. It was very Al-Soft-as-Sh*t. Their service wasn't terrible, but they wouldn't give me a refund for the pasta I barely touched. The waiter said, "This is how traditional Aglio E Olio is made." I was completely offended by that statement.I'm trying to remember the rest of my bad experience. It's really hard to. I feel like an altar boy who spent years getting fondled by a priest and now I'm trying to forget about the traumatizing events.
2014-01-23,5,Absolutely LOVE coming here, and make it a point to dine at this establishment at least once a month. The service is top notch and extremely attentive which is always great, and it's BYO! Plus, the food is outstanding. Everything I've ever ordered here (I've ordered from both the regular menu and many of their specials) is delicious. But my favorite by far has to be the angel hair crab pasta. Trust me when I say you won't be disappointed. Definitely the best Italian restaurant in the Hoboken area.
2014-01-22,1,The first time I went here, I loved it. Then the subsequent times I have been they service and in particular has been extremely rude to myself and the party I was with. The first time I called up to make a reservation because of Groupon, which I purchased and asked if we were to use the Groupon then we had to make one. I called and they said they don't take reservations. I go there and tell them I have a Groupon in person and they very rudely instruct me that you need a reservation to use it. They would not accept it even though they said they do not take reservations. I left. The next time we call up and make the reservation for 9. They make me wait over 30 minutes to sit at a table when people who did not make reservations with a Groupon got the priority seating, very rude. I finally sit at our table and I am ordering and they would't allow me to order something outside the price range of the Groupon and just pay the difference. I accepted this but didn't understand why they wouldn't encourage us to spend more money on our dinner. Then I ordered a coffee and once the owner heard about this he pulled over his staff member and scolded him for allowing us to have the coffee which was included in the Groupon. When I was ready to get the check, the owner tacks on a 20% mandatory gratuity which the Groupon does not state when you purchase along with the tax of the bill. I could understand paying the tax EVEN though no restaurant has asked us to pay the tax or require a tip after purchasing and using a Groupon. I would have given the tip, but the fact that he required it was absurd, and on top of that it had to be cash. I did not have cash and he said well we have a $20 minimum for card, which is illegal in the state of NJ. He finally understood and didn't want a scene, so he let us use the card to just pay the tax. I did not leave a tip and that was the first time I have ever done that, due to the absolute rudeness and bad experience we had. I will never go there again.
2014-01-13,5,Really, really good traditional Italian food. The atmophere is nice- it's loud but we liked it that way because we're a loud group. Service was good. I brought my parents here when they were in town visiting and they loved their meals. We had enough for leftovers the next day, which is always a plus. I'd recommend it for sure and I know I'll be going back soon!
2013-12-11,4,This place has great food, but there are certain things one should know before coming. Came here with a Groupon. Be aware: if you don't make a reservation, they will NOT accept your Groupon. This applies even to when the restaurant is empty. Don't understand the logic, but that's the way it is.     Another issue with the Groupon, is that you must order a dish that is no more than $20.50; if you order something more expensive, you cannot just pay the difference... You must pay full price. This also doesn't make any sense to me. Wouldn't you want to up-sell the new customer once you get him/her in the door for the first time? The Groupon deal has a lot of shadyness to it... so much, that it almost turned me completely off from coming here. Luckily, I had a change of heart.The restaurant is pretty great, the food is wonderfully prepared and the BYOB makes it worthwhile. The veal parm is satisfying and tender. The cannoli is delicious. The portions are large enough for leftovers. The service is good (I didn't have the issue that other yelpers before me did... My server had a helper who refilled our water and boxed my food.)The 20% automatic tip didn't bother me. But I was also aware that it was coming. I also knew before arrival that they are cash only, even though there's a Visa sticker on the door. I would have probably been pretty pissed if I didn't know that before the bill came.Long story short, the food is good, just know about the little things that may turn you off so that your experience isn't ruined when you come there for the first time (especially with a Groupon.)
2013-12-05,4,Came here to celebrate my 30th birthday with a nice dinner - and it was everything I expected. My boyfriend had one of the specials - linguine and seafood. It was  so much food, so much absolutely delicious food. I can't ever say no to vodka sauce so I had a dish with vodka sauce.  It was everything I hoped for! Go to this place - its Awesome!
2013-11-24,4,I've been here twice and each time the food was wonderful.  The place is small and doesn't take reservations so we get here around 5:30 to make sure we get a table.  Get ready for a very long list of specials, too many to remember.  They really should print them out and put them in the menu.
2013-11-16,1,Came here with a Groupon reservation. They have specific timeslots/tables to seat Groupon users and they were all booked for three of the weekends I tried, so I would recommend calling a week in advance if you also bought a Groupon. Got the calamari for appetizer, which was very good. Tender pieces, not overly oily, marinara was alright. For mains, we got the veal parmigiana and the Fusilli Cacciatore. Like others have said, portions were huge but taste/quality was standard (same w dessert). At their normal prices I would have felt extremely ripped off. The best part of dinner was the complimentary bruschetta - aahmaazing. Overall the food was alright (3.5) so why the one star?The service/front of house SUCKS. No one acknowledged us or the couples behind us when we entered, and the place really isn't big enough to have people loitering around for even a few minutes. There's a lot of staff but everyone is disorganized, and no one seems to know what the other guy's doing/did.  Thus service is wildly inconsistent - we waited twenty minutes for someone to come take our order but after our appetizers came out, the service became so 'attentive' that a waiter took my plate and other utensils away as I was still forking up the last bite. Wtf? The inexcusable part happened at the end though. When the bill came, the waiter explained I had to pay in cash because of my Groupon - otherwise they wouldn't be able to charge me the necessary gratuity. So not only did they try to add arbitrary rules to the Groupon use, they ended up forcing a 15% gratuity on our party of two. I ended up arguing to use my credit card, and told them I always tip on the original bill so not to worry (usually at LEAST 20% - food coupons make me feel extra generous about the tip). The waiter hesitated, said OK, left to confer w someone outside the restaurant (again wtf?), then an inordinately long amount of time later finally came back with the check. He must not have trusted me at all and spent all that time manually entering numbers into the cc billed amount because guess what, the total was still with the 15% gratuity! Real classy!As a side note, the table beside us, regular non Groupon customers, looked less than satisfied with the service as well. They noted something off about the items on their bill after the cc was swiped, and the waiter took it back to charge them more. Wtf#3??That level of behavior and rudeness is OK maybe at Burger King. But here, where I willingly spent $55 even with the Groupon? Yea, no thanks.
2013-11-10,4,Food is very good however beware of the specials. $18.00 for a dry artichoke is a crime.
2013-10-20,4,Go for the silky, rich, heartwarming carbonara. Stay for the coziness and, well, your bowl of pasta will have you in a delightful coma anyway. Boyfriend had the vodka sauce cavatelli special and liked that as well. Next time will bring wine to linger over, and a determination to share dishes and make it through to dessert. The following were insignificant once the steaming spaghetti hit the table, but to be fair -- Knocked off a star because service was slow, credit cards weren't being taken, and someone over the phone said there would be no wait for two - until we got there and waited 45 min easily.
2013-10-03,5,I am not a lover of Italian cuisine. This restaurant falls into the very tiny micro-chasm of Italian places that I plan to frequent as often as I can. The menu was very extensive, but it was the specials that I was after. Our server came and told us the specials. The only words I was able to understand was "chicken" and "salmon" I think. I had to have him repeat all the specials in hopes of catching more of it since his Italian accent was so thick. No luck. I just told him I wanted the first one which ended up being a chicken in cavatelli in vodka sauce. All of the pasta is made from scratch in-house. Let me just tell you how amazing my food was. The pasta was al dente of course. The difference between a fresh-made pasta and the store-bought pastas is SO different. I never want boxed pasta again. The texture is something wonderful that everyone just experience at least once in their lifetime. Chewy, but not mushy. The pasta was perfect for catching sauce in its folds and the chicken was tender and delicious. I ate the whole thing. The bread that they put out is also perfection. Crusty pieces of bread with soft slightly salty centers. I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.
2013-09-08,4,Great reasonably priced Italian. Service was very attentive without ever being overbearing, and food was terrific. Just moved in around the corner and will definitely be back.
2013-09-08,1,The food was okay not anything to write home about but what makes this review so bad if the service. On top of things to start but took like 20 minutes to get the check when I was staring down a group of waiters just talking. Then they tell us they only take AMEX  and cash today. They had a visa and MasterCard sign outside so they should have told us up front if there was a problem with it. So I had to leave my sister there and walk to an ATM. Ridiculous.
2013-09-06,2,Went here on a recommendation for anniversary dinner. Wasn't in my seat 2 minutes when waiter spilled bottle of wine on table and all over me. It was an accident but we were very surprised when manager never even came over to see how we were and nothing was offered as restitution for incident. Food was good but wait staff was slow and not to ambitious. Don't think we will go back.
2013-09-04,1,Good food, bad service.1. They made us wait for main courses for the whole hour. The waiters were not eager to get our orders before everyone arrived at our table, though the ones who arrived first were very hungry. The waiters weren't prompt in general.2. They got one of our orders wrong. Though they corrected it right away, they were making it so that it was our fault and that they brought us exactly what we ordered.3. They took the liberty of including a 20% tip in our check as a separate line. 4. They mixed up our "to go" leftovers as we were leaving. So we found out that we got someone else's leftovers when each of us got home.Will any of us come there again? No, thank you.
2013-08-07,4,Good food; good service. Just make sure you have ample time. If you are looking for a quick meal, this place may not be for you.
2013-08-01,5,My favorite Italian Rest in Hoboken!! The food and service is amazing...
2013-07-20,5,I was sure that I wrote a review on Trattoria Saporito many many moons ago...but I'm going to correct that mistake right now.  This review could go on for pages, but I'll try to keep it short.  A cozy Italian restaurant, with great service and fantastic food!!I've been coming here for years, I'm not sure that I've ever ordered off the menu since there are always specials and they are always amazing.  Pay attention, the specials list is LONG.  :)  The service is friendly and attentive, the restaurant is BYOB which is just wonderful and the portions are pretty large (yeah for leftovers).  My favorites (specials, but almost always available):  portobello in balsamic appetizer, mixed seafood appetizer (huge, you'll want to share this with at least several people), angel hair with crab meat in a pink sauce & cavatelli with chicken and shiitake mushrooms in a pink sauce.  For the meat eaters, osso bucco with risotto.  I've tried many other things over the years and have never been disappointed.  If you manage to save room for desert, you won't regret it!!
2013-07-10,5,Great place to go on a date or with a group of friends. The wait staff is extremely attentive and the food is some of the best I've had in Hoboken. After the first time I ate here I was back for another dinner a week later. The portions are large and the pasta is made fresh daily. They start by bringing bruschetta out to the table and it is  close to the best I have ever had. After the bruschetta comes the warm fresh bread that is just as good.  It is a BYOB spot so make sure you stop to pick up a bottle or 2 of wine.
2013-07-09,5,I was visiting a friend in NY and we decided to go to Hoboken to visit my previous workplace, for nostalgia.  We walked around trying to decide on a place to eat and came upon Trattoria Saporito.  The food was as good as it gets.  We had a phenomenal buffalo mozzerela salad- da bomb.  The waiter (perhaps owner) was kind enough to bring us out a sample of the mozzerela salad, as a courtesy that was made in-house.  Phenomenal.  We were allowed to bring our own bottle of wine, a serious plus.  The calamari and shrimp were something to write home about.  The customer service and attention to detail was exquisite.  I had such a wonderful time and loved the food.  I am coming back there when I return to the NY area.  I would give it six or seven stars if allowed.  -Marie Elena Pollnow, Milwaukee, WI
2013-06-28,3,Good food but poor service. We felt rushed by waitstaff (even though they weren't rude). There was some confusion in using our Groupon and the table next to us had the same problem with very overpriced app specials doubling the bill. Definitely more pricey than other local joints (good thing for the groupon). Good quality was actually really good though so I wonder if the poor service is what's keeping them back. I'd consider them for takeout. Oh and beware of birthdays! They play REALLY loud music and flash the lights like a disco. While it was nice to make the person feel special, it could have been done at a lower decibel.
2013-06-24,4,Generous portions and a lot of daily specials to choose from. Complementary bruschetta (1pp) BYOB always a plus
2013-06-20,4,My parents came to town and we decided to walk around Hoboken to enjoy the lovely weather. After a jaunt in the park we went looking for Tutta Pasta which is now closed!!!! Luckily we stumbled on Trattoria Saporito. The bruschetta they brought out was better than any we've had before. My dad (who's Italian) said it was the best he'd had in a long time.All the pastas are handmade and everyone's lunch was delicious. The portions were also very generous. We ended up taking a lot home.I'm so glad we found this place - it definitely feels authentic and the vibe is family friendly - but could lend itself to be a date spot.
2013-06-03,1,I called ahead to make a reservation, and the gentleman on the phone told me that the restaurant does not accept reservations (unless it is for a large party).  He said that they should have no problem serving our party of four at 8pm.  However, when I arrived at 8pm I was turned away because I had not made a reservation.  I hear the food is good here.  However, this is Hoboken - there are plenty of other restaurants that probably have better food.  At least I know for sure that the service can't get any worse than this.
2013-05-07,4,I came here on Saturday night and we got seating relatively quickly; they even let us sit outside to wait and opened our wine bottles so we could drink while we waited! Huge plus.The staff was extremely friendly. Once we were seated for about 5 minutes, they had to physically move our table slightly to make room for a larger party. I didn't mind at all and it took only a few seconds, but they brought an appetizer of bruschetta on the house because of that. Listen closely to the specials. I had parpadalle with shrimp and it was delicious. My friends had gnocchi, spaghetti, and orecchiette, and all were phenomenal. The homemade red sauce is amazing.I would definitely go back here many times! I felt a little bit like I was in Italy.
2013-05-06,1,The one star is not so much for the food, more for the managerial service. It's true, the bread and bruschetta at the table are nice, and the waiters are very attentive. The sauce is good, although I didn't see a real Italian working in the kitchen or at the tables. Everything was ok, except for the manager, GASTON. We were six people with big appetites, and when we had a little question about an appetizer (Stuffed Artichoke) we figured the manager would take care of it. After all, it was an artichoke!!Nope, not GASTON. He insisted all was fine and refused to get us a new one. That might have been the end of it, but NASTY GASTON made an uncalled for comment to us when the dinner was served. So classless. I would never go back  as long as GASTON is there. Yeah, it's a decent restaurant, but look up and down Washington Street. All you see is competition. So, See Ya GASTON. (GASTON: a very appropriate name for a man with a Napoleonic complex). P.S. We paid full price.
2013-05-05,5,Just moved out of Hoboken after 10 years there and went for one of my last dinners on the east coast.  Hadn't been for several years (somehow, between new Hoboken places and some NYC spots, it fell off my radar) but had remembered really liking it.  Hands down, some of the best Italian food in Hoboken.  Incredible vodka sauce (I had the chicken, shiitake mushroom, and vodka sauce pasta special).  Was with a very particular foodie friend of mine and she had the pasta with crab--fresh crab meat, no imitation--and she absolutely loved it!  The other two in our party really enjoyed their pasta as well.  Everyone walked away raving.  And it's BYO.  What's better than that?
2013-04-18,1,I didn't even get to try the food and I am not sure I ever will.My husband and I walked in and asked how long the wait was since the place was packed. They said that 2 tables were leaving and one should be available in about 15 minutes. While we were waiting, 2 groups of 4 showed up. As soon as tables became available, those two groups were seated promptly before us! I was so shocked, and annoyed that we simply left. My only regret is not saying something. I realize that more money would have been made with a larger group, but come on....we could have possibly been returning customers. Their loss.
2013-04-07,4,I have always walked passed Trattoria Saporito and finally decided to give it a try last night.  I showed up with my girlfriend around 8:30 (Saturday night) and were told there was an hour wait (no reservations accepted) so we went to a close bar to grab a drink.  I figured if there was an hour wait, the place must be pretty good.  Service was better than average and the food met expectations, plus some.  I usually frown upon fried calamari order that don't come with scungilli; this is the first time where I had fried calamari without the scungilli and loved it.  For my main course I went with the chicken cacciatora and that was tremendous.  I asked the chef to give it a little kick and he crushed it.  Came out with the perfect heat and I even have leftovers for tonight!  My girlfriend ordered linguine with meat sauce and the pasta was cooked just perfectly, sauce was tasty as well!  People compare this place to Augustino's (where I have been) and I will say this is a close second!  All in all, this place will be receiving my business again.
2013-03-18,4,I came here on a Thursday night after buying the Groupon for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, 2 (non-alcoholic) beverages for $29.  I figured at that price it was a good deal, and it definitely was!  It's BYOB so we also brought a bottle of our own wine.We ordered the carpaccio for the appetizer which was OK.  It was pretty generous in portion but was missing something that would have made it great.  They also brought out a complimentary bruschetta which was really good - very fresh and lots of flavor.For entrees we got the veal parm and rigatoni al cuoco.  Both were solid dishes, and also HUGE portions.  We ate half and actually had the other half for lunch the next day!  For those that think this place is pricey, I'm not really sure why.  The portions are huge and it's not any more expensive than other comparable Italian restaurants.We ordered tiramisu also (not included in the Groupon) mainly because I LOVE tiramisu.  Now if you recall I was just saying how this place had huge portions so I was extremely full at this point.  The dish came and I thought surely I'd take a bite and take the rest of it to go with the rest of my food, but once we took one bite we couldn't stop.  It had excellent flavor, but was also so light and airy I'm pretty sure I could have eaten an entire tray of it.  Definitely the best tiramisu I've ever had!
2013-02-17,5,I love this place. The food is delicious,  the staff is friendly and very professional,  the place is cozy and clean and the location is great. I'm regular and I've never been desappointed. So go, you won't regret it!!!
2013-02-16,4,I've been looking for a good italian place since I moved here, and this exceeded my expectations. The aroma from outside the restaurant drew me in and the food from bread to dessert was extremely savory. This little spot has an intimate ambiance with faint music and dimmed lighting and sets the mood overall. Favorite spot in hoboken now!
2013-01-28,5,I literally have to come here every time I'm in Hoboken. The food is amazing.
2013-01-27,4,Best pasta fagioli I have ever tasted. The waiter that is always helping us is super nice. Pretty sure the pasta is homemade. Very cozy and friendly restaurant. I will certainly return. Keep in mind it is an expensive restaurant by Hoboken standards.
2012-10-27,5,Ok Augustinos, step aside .. having eaten at this place multiple times I can say its hands down better .. none of the silly pretension you get at Augustinos - I mean, I really don't even get the hype over Augustinos when you can eat here without the hype with much better food and bring your own wine over the lackluster wine list at Augustinos
2012-10-07,4,This place fits the bill for a lovely little Italian spot. Second only to Augustinos, it is a fresh helping of good ol' Hoboken Italian cuisine.It's a bit on the pricey side, so be warned. Be prepared to bust out your wallet - can't have any moths flying out on your night out here. However, their pastas are top notch quality. There won't be any question about whether you'll be satisfied coming here or not.I've been here multiple times. I've always stuck to the pastas so I cannot critique anything else. They love to dazzle you with their specials for the night - be ready to take a couple notes, there are nights where there are many. Anyway, the pastas are excellent. I'm a big fan of the meat lasagna, meat raviolis (meat sauce is to die for!). The rigatoni al cuoco is also very zesty. I tend to stick to the  Bresaola for the appetizer. There are selections of fish, veal, poultry, etcetera on the menu - stuff you would typically expect from an Italian restaurant. The times I've been here, I haven't had complaints about whatever my partner would be having (typically the poultry).The deserts are a little meh. Main reason I zinged the place a star, besides the fact that it's still #2 to Augustinos. It's BYOB. The waiters are very attentive in all my experiences here. Knowledgable too. I tend to come at good times, so I can't judge how they are when the place is completely blown out (the seating is a little bit lacking, it is not a huge place).
2012-10-05,4,This place has very good Italian cuisine  I went here on a nice fall Sunday night with a lovely lady.  We were immediately seated outside which was our desired plan of attack.  They do not take reservations for the record.  Outdoor seating is limited... they tightly pack in probably five small two seater tables.  We had the table in the corner that was on a slant.  Most things in Hoboken are on a slant though (including some apartments that I've been in).The place is BYOB, and that is a plus, thus helping the star rating.  It's odd because they also serve alcohol which I heard is a recent change.  I think they are in some sort of a transition phase so I can't guarantee that the BYOB thing will continue for legal purposes.  Either way, they gladly corked the bottle for us and kept it on ice.  The servers are friendly and constantly fill your glass almost after each sip.  Perhaps the plan is to get you ripped.They bring out warm crusty bread which is delicious.  Be careful not to fill up on it.  It is tempting to do so.  We looked at the menu, but the waiter offered specials that sounded deliciously irresistible.  He had me at lobster ravioli.  My guest ordered a seafood, mussel shellfish type dish.  The waiter arrived shortly with sample serving dish that showed an array of available pasta categories that you must chose from.  This was a nice touch, and it definitely starts your palate watering.  The food arrived a short time later at the proper temperature.  Another waiter arrived with freshly grated parmesan and pepper to season where appropriate.My dish was phenomenal.  The lobster meat was in the sauce rather than inside the ravioli.  Obviously, the ravioli must be universal to other dishes, but I do prefer the lobster to be inside.  Either way, I was completely satisfied, and I definitely did not need to take anything home.  I even tried some of the mussels, and they were equally as delicious.The only reason that I could not award the extra star for this establishment was due to the bill.  I was a bit tipsy from the wine and did not look at it.  The bill came to $70.  We did not order drinks or appetizers.  I thought that for two entrees, perhaps because they were "special",  $70 was a little pricey.  This is Hoboken, not the Theater District.  Bring your Amex.
2012-09-16,4,"Would you like to hear about our specials for the night?""Yes, we would love to hear about the specials."... and 16 dishes later, our waiter covered all of the specials for the night. Seriously. There were probably 4 different appetizer specials, 8 pasta special - each of which he showed us on a plate the type of fresh pasta that would be used with detailed descriptions on the sauces and meats, and another 4 or so meat / fish dishes. Just to memorize all of these specials on any given night, these people are probably the smartest waiters in Hoboken.The meal is started with some fresh out of the oven bread, and some very tasty, on the house, bruschetta. Excellent start to the meal twice. We started with the fried calamari. It was good, but nothing mind blowing. The tomato sauce it comes with is thick and chunky and probably was made in house earlier in the day. For our mains, we both had specials. The lady had a chicken dish with mozzarella, prosciutto, basil, and asparagus in a white wine sauce, accompanied with a side of your choice, (linguini in tomato sauce in this case). The chicken was tender and tasty, but the pasta was just ok. I had the veal osso buco which came with what they called "seasoned rice," but was actually more of a delicious risotto than a rice. The veal was super tender, and absolutely fell off of the bone with just the tiniest of shakes. Now... what ever you do, do not throw away that bone! It came with a small fork for you to scoop out all of that delicious bone marrow and throw it in the crusty heel of the bread. The "rice" and a creamy and delicious risotto.Portions here are generous... we ended up taking home half of each entree.Couple of things to be aware of, or beware of here... 1) While this place is still BYOB, they now have offer wines in house... this worries me that the BYOB might disappear.2) They automatically add in a 20% gratuity onto the bill. Now... our server was great, and I would have tipped about this much, so in this case, I was ok with it, but the table next to us complained of missing an ordered side dish, so if I was them, I would be more than annoyed at an automatic 20%. 3) Ask how much the specials are... I did not, and my veal osso buco was $40... $40 dollars! Given that everything on the menu was about $20 or under, I was shocked that this dish was twice as much. I think this quite possibly might be the single most expensive dish anywhere in Hoboken.Overall, the service here is very attentive and friendly, and the food is flavorful with generous portions. The drawback here is that it is expensive for Italian food, and expensive for Hoboken. The total bill for 1 app and 2 special dishes, plus tax and the automatic tip came out to $100. That's high for Hoboken. That being said, the mammoth list of specials and good dishes, and BYOB were enough to impressive me and make me want to come back. Just be prepared to pay.
2012-08-11,1,Everything on the menu seems to be about $5-$8 too expensive, and I hadn't yet dined here in the 5 years I've been in Hoboken because of that. But, we got a gift card from a friend and thought we'd try it out. First the food, my girlfriend got a chicken special and pasta. She actually really enjoyed it. My Seafood Fra Diavlo on the other hand, was nothing to write home about. It had a lot of seafood (it better for almost $40), including Lobster, Calamari, Clams, and Mussels. The lobster and clams were both quite good. The Calamari and mussels were terribly overcooked and almost inedible. I'd give the dish a 3 out of 10.I've had worse meals, but what really killed me about this place was their dishonesty regarding the gift card. We were presented with a bill of $22 (originally $72 before the gift card), and the waiter ran my credit card. When the bill comes back, the $22 check had been removed and the $72 check had been secretly swapped in, and my credit card charged for the full amount. Had I not been paying attention, this would have been a free $50 to the restaurant. I brought this to their attention, and they were hardly apologetic, and actually seemed annoyed at me. I have a feeling this wasn't their first time trying to pull a fast one on  a customer.
2012-08-08,4,One of my top two Italian places in town.  BYOB which is perfect.  Have not been disappointed by food.  Tortellini w/mushrooms, out of this world.  The portobello/mozzarella appetizer is delicious ( although a bit pricey).  Staff is always very friendly and accommodating.  Josser is my favorite.
2012-07-17,1,I had one of the worst meals I ever had in my life.  I asked for the $27.00 crab meat over pasta and it was disgusting.  The onions were raw, there was so much sauce, you could barely find anything else.  I would never go there again.
2012-07-16,4,Great food....excellent arugula salad and the squid ink pasta with crab meat was top notch.
2012-06-18,1,Came here on Father's Day because Madison's was overcrowded for brunch.  Not many people here so thought we could get in and out rather quickly.  Exactly the opposite...50 minutes later still no food and three people who came in after us ordered, ate and paid before we got up an left.  Big pet peeve of mine..Didn't even try the food but definitely not coming back here.
2012-06-18,1,Just left this establishment..and sadly very disappointed. When we came in we were seated promptly and had our water filled promptly,..off to a good start..food was decent nothing special..we ordered buffalo salad and clams In a red sauce..waiter took our order..seemed uninterested..I ordered chicken Marsala specifically asked if it came with potatoes and vegetables and was told yes.  Food came out got a dish with chicken and vegetables no potatoes in sight waved somebody down to ask about my potatoes..you would have thought I was asking for caviar..everyone looking around...really people???  So I started eating my food still no potatoes in sight..waiter never came over..ridiculous..finally after almost being done with my meal I get a plate of half cooked potatoes..delivered by someone else barely apologetic. Got through our meal mind you it was fathers day and not very busy..,waiter still missing in action..finally waiter appears and plops down the check..not would you like dessert nothing ..I was already mad at this point and had my husband not wanted dessert I would have passed..but he had it anyway..finally got the check and noticed gratuity was included and 26 was going to this waiter who was rude and did nothing..absolutely not called manager over and gratuity was taken off but I felt that HE also was less than apologetic...I paid too much money for an average meal and poor service,, too many good restaurants in Hoboken so my advice is go elsewhere..
2012-06-12,4,Now one of my top 3 Italian spots! Awesome old school Italian. I ordered the Fusilli alla Cacciatoria and it was perfectly done. The sauce was very flavorful and the pasta cooked perfectly. Will definitely be back!!
2012-06-08,5,By far the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken!!! Great food
2012-05-05,3,NIce decor, a bit noisy as the sound seems to bounce around alot here. On to the food, we had salad which was fresh and crisp to the bite with just the right amount of dressing. The bread was also fresh and delicious.  The main courses, two different pastas definitely tasted fresh made and the sauces one red, the other garlic and oil were well balanced and complimented the pastas just right. Portions are very generous, you will likely be taking some home with you.. Service was a bit loose as we kept getting different servers instead of just one thru the whole meal, this seemed to cause a bit of a lag in our service at the begining of the meal. This did improve after the salad course but I would rate the service as acceptable but just that.  I also found the music selection as strange, it was mostly hard rock and loud and not at all fitting with the style of the restaurant or the mood it seemed they were trying to create in both the food and decoration of the place.  We actually decided to not stay for coffee and dessert  as the music was just too annoying. I like rock and I like loud  but not when Im having good Italian fare.  All in all a decent choice for Italian.
2012-04-16,4,The place was recommended to us by a longtime Hoboken resident.  If you are looking for that old-style Italian meal then this is the place.  If you don't mind paying a lot for it then this is also the place.  Even for Hoboken, I thought everything we ordered was about 25% higher than it should have been.  $25 for a pasta dish that had no meat or fish???So much for my price vent.  I loved the food.  The complimentary bruschetta was delicious as was the hot and crusty bread they put out.   We started with an appetizer of fried calamari (overpriced item #1).  The calamari were large and tender but the sauce was only so-so.  It needed  some zest!  Next we had two pastas for our main course and both were outstanding and extremely large.  I wish I had known that before I devoured the bread.  My dish was about $15 which seemed about right but my wife's "special" rigatoni was about $25 which seemed about wrong.  Upon leaving, we agreed that we had just had an excellent meal which is about the most important and best thing you can say about a restaurant.  Just as an aside, the menu says that all pastas are cooked on the premises.  I was glad they pointed that out because I was afraid that maybe they cooked them at the falafel place across the street and brought them over for consumption.
2012-03-10,4,We went there last night for the first time.  It was crowded but we got lucky only waited a few minutes.  The waiters are all very nice.  The place is kind of loud but its good because the tables are close together and you cant really hear your neighbors conversation.  The pasta dishes we had were delicious and huge! its byob so the bill was not crazy.  we had and appetizer, pasta dish specials and coffee and the bill was $66!  we will defiantly go back.
2012-03-07,4,Good place.  I'm not so thrilled with the Italian restaurant selection in Hoboken.  The food and service were all great but nothing that really makes me wanna come back.
2012-03-05,5,Best Italian in Hoboken.My husband and I have been coming here for seven years...it is so popular, there is ALWAYS a wait on a Friday/Saturday night after 7:30 p.m. but they do a good job of getting people sat.  The staff is extremely attentive and the food is delicious.  I find it hard to believe that someone commented negatively on the FREE bruchetta they bring to the table.  First off, it's complimentary, geez...and second, it's pretty much my favorite part of the meal - it's delicious. The specials are pricier than the menu but excellent, service is great, ambience is very nice/romantic.  NO complaints here!
2012-02-13,2,I would actually go with the 3 stars, but i think the "meh i've had better" rating better suits my thoughts on the place.  First the positives:We were able to get in at 7pm fairly easily for a saturday night.  Food portions are generous.  And the plates that I tasted, but did not get, were much more flavorful than mine.  The price was what you'd expect for hoboken, so not really expensive.  Also, they were really good at keeping my glass of water full.  The caesar salad was solid, not too anchovy, and perfectly dressed.Now for the negatives:The plate of fake pasta that they bring to the table to show you the specials is kinda wierd and tacky.  We had a bottle of cold white wine, as it was a byob, and they had no ice bucket or marble cooler to put the bottle in to keep temp.  Nor were they particularly active in making sure our glasses of wine were full(wierd given how good they were with the water).  My Chicken Parmigiana was middle of the pack.  The chicken was cooked perfect, and had the right flavor, as did the pasta.  But the marinara on the pasta had very little flavor to it.  If it hadn't been for the pieces of tomatoes in the sauce, i would not have been able to discern the flavor.  The cheese was put on by a very heavy hand, and thus undercooked and greasy, as opposed to bubbly and golden brown.  Also, the complimentary bruchetta they brought to the table, in my own opinion, was derailed by the large chunks of onion.  Now my personal preference is to omit onions altogether, but if you must, they should be cut small.  At the very least, it should be uniform to the size of the tomatoes, if not smaller.  The sharpness kills the freshness of the tomatoes and balsamic thats drizzled over.  One last note on the service, i was slightly turned off by the look of contempt for not ordering dessert.  If i wasn't turned off by my meal, the portions would have filled me too much.  I probably won't look to go there again, but its not something i'd fight going to.  Certainly open to having them change my mind and prove me wrong.
2012-02-04,1,Not impressed at all.... Had better pasta cooked at home....Staff very unattentive
2012-01-03,4,I guess the prices are normal for Hoboken. But I thought this place was pretty good! I had the raviloi bolognese and i tried some of the seafood risotto. They were terrific! The noodles were perfectly al dente and the risotto wasn't too soft or was it too hard. I don't know why this place doesn't have any better reviews, but maybe it's because I haven't had much east coast italian food which is where it's really at. can't wait to try more when i go back!
2011-12-17,4,For as picky as I am with my Italian places, I have to say, this place is actually pretty good! It's no Augustino's, but it's way better than Leo's, Cafe Michelina or Tutta Pasta. We came last minute on a Friday night and it was crowded, but not packed, and we were seated right away. The servers were very attentive and even with an app, two entrees and dessert, we were in and out in less than an hour.The complimentary bruschetta was nice and garlicky, and the bread that was brought out was warm and soft. We tried the carpaccio app and enjoyed it. All the pasta is homemade (love that!) so knowing that, I had to try the gnocchi. I liked the gnochhi, but thought the bolognese sauce was average. My boyfriend got a seafood pasta with scallops, shrimp and lobster and really liked it. He loved the sauce and had never had homemade pasta before and couldn't believe the difference in taste. We also got the hazelnut gelatto and cannoli, and enjoyed both of those as well. The homemade pasta was a little expensive, but I always believe in paying for quality. It's not mind-blowing Italian, but it is better than most of the other Italian restaurants in town.
2011-10-16,5,I live in Hoboken and have tried over a dozen Italian restaurants and this is by far my favorite.  The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable and they bring out AMAZING bruschetta to wet your palet when you first sit down.  Any dish with red pasta sauce is recommended. It's fresh and sweet and probably the best I've ever had!  Plus it's BYOB so you can bring your favorite bottle and save some money.
2011-09-07,4,5 for byob4 for Ambience for cleanliness and decor but 2 bc it gets really loud so a 3 overall 5 for service5 for bread and bruschetta4 for food...everything was excellent but some dishes (Pesto and pink Bolognese) were a little richer than I would have liked. Caesar salad was Good, not overly creamy which I hate.  3 for dessert...Ricotta pie tasty but too dry, cannolli very good but a little sweeter than I like, and gelato was very good.Overall an excellent dinner.
2011-07-29,1,Don't waste your time at this place. We brought our parents there with a 10 yr niece with us (total 5 ppl) to this place. The ladies walked in first and they won't sit us until all parties are here which was fine with us. We enjoyed our meal overall, I gave the food 3 stars. The service was average with very difficult understand Spanish accent waiter but with good attitude. When we asked for the check, we noticed that they automatically charge almost 20% gratuity to the total. We asked the waiter why was that and he said they did that for party of 4 and over. We asked to see the menu again if it was stated or informed and we did not see that on the menu. We were going to ask the waiter again why we were not informed of that prior and the manager came over and rudely said to us that 'you can pay anything you want!' and rudely through a different check to us. When he walked away, he gesture a 'F*** off' sign to the waiter. The whole time we were very polite with them and we just wanted to find out why we were not informed for the charge but instead were treated in such a rude manner. We will nver go back again.
2011-05-31,3,Came here for the first time a few days ago while visiting my cousin, and I'd have to say that based on her recommendations and descriptions about the place, it was just okay for me.I have a pretty picky palate when it comes to Italian food because I'm not huge on cream-based pastas. I like sauces that are less creamy because that way it allows me to really enjoy the herbs and spices that the pasta dish has to offer. When it's slathered in cream, I feel like it's just a way to disguise the lack of fresh ingredients in the sauce.My cousin is a regular here, so we got pretty good service. She ordered the Hot Antipasti as our appetizer. Apparently, it's not on the menu, so you'll have to request it. They have it in 3 different portions measured by 1, 2, 3 respectively. Size 1 feeds about 2 people, 2 for 3-4 people, and 3 for 5-6 people. In it, there is an assortment of mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari with a delectable tomato sauce. The calamari was great - not overly fried and the squid rings were fresh, not rubbery. I only wish that there was a bit more. The clams and mussels were steamed just right and had a nice flavor to them. Mostly garlic, so if you're not a fan, make sure you let them know ahead of time to lessen the amount. The shrimp was blah, and they don't even de-vein them! Gross.For the entrees, the three of us decided to split the crab lump pasta in a cream tomato sauce and the homemade lasagna. Out of the two, the crab pasta was the winner. Though it had a little more cream than I would have liked, it wasn't overbearing like at some other places I've been to. The crab meat was plentiful and fresh, and definitely did not come from a can. Big plus on that! :) The only downside to it was that I felt the pasta was overcooked and a bit soft. I like my pasta with a bit of a bite to it, and this was cooked just 1-2 minutes over to my liking. The lasagna was very rich and had way too much ricotta cheese. At least the serving was not a whole lot, so the three of us were able to finish it up.The place itself is quite small, and I don't think they take reservations, so it's best to get there before 7pm. We got there a little before 6pm, and by the time we were about to leave, the place was already packed, inside and outside.For 3 dishes and a bottle of Pellegrino sparkling mineral water, the bill turned out to be around $97, so definitely pricey to me. I didn't think it was worth that much. The only dish worth going for is the crab lump pasta, which I believe is a daily special. Other than that, everything else was just average. Service is pretty good, but I don't know if it's just because my cousin was with us, but they seemed pretty attentive to all the tables around us.
2011-05-21,4,Good food.  The portions are large and the service is attentive.  A little on the pricey side, but considering the portion size and quality of the food I'm not upset about it.
2011-05-09,2,The food is good but not excellent and their dishes are way overpriced for what you get. There is always a wait to get in and sometimes you will be passed over for a table if a regular comes in. The daily specials seems to me disproportionally more expensive than the regular menu so be prepared to sink down some extra change if you go that route. It's BYOB, so make sure you get some wine before you go.
2011-04-20,4,The homemade pasta here is amazing and I love that it is BYO Vino - just consistently yummy food and I am very particular with my pasta. The perfect place to grab some good Italian food in Hoboken!
2011-04-10,5,Amazing wait staff and servers. Very professional, knowledgeable and kind. The homemade cavatelli with mushrooms, chicken, and pink sauce= heaven!BYOB place so pick up a few bottles of wine before you go.Downer- they don't take reservations. It's a small place so get there early or you will have to wait for a table.
2011-03-24,3,First impression upon walking in with some friends:WTF, is this place an ex-Chinese restaurant? Tall - backed chairs... the shape of the water cups... even the style of the cloth napkins.. Plus, the restaurant was a bit dingy, didn't have the best ambience. And btw, my friends are Chinese, so this comment does have some cred. But we were starving so we sat down.The free bread - ehhhh, tasted like the bread you get from your local grocery store's bakery. Not a good sign.Bruschetta - surprisingly good. Tasted refreshing, almost. Entrees - anything other than a pasta dish is pricey! I ordered Tortellini (you pick between beef or cheese, I picked cheese) which was THE MOST DELICIOUS tortellini of my entire life. Cooked in a mushroom sauce, all I could think about was cream of mushroom with cheese. In pasta. Yum! Thank God for the tortellini, I think it saved our experience!The other pastas, however, tasted a bit like something that I personally could have made (which equals boil water + Barilla pasta + sauce from a jar). There wasn't anything particularly authentic about the sauces, and one of the pasta shapes I described as... tubular. But considering the gigantic portions, a dish of pasta about $17 was reasonable. Food comes out fast, and the service is very Italian-ish: meaning brusque, and to the point. I actually come back for the tortellini, but nothing else.
2011-03-06,5,Wonderful! Fabulous fresh food. Reminds me of italy
2011-03-06,4,This review is for the cappellini crab only as I've never had anything else there.  It comes in a big heaping plate with generous portions of lump crab meat and pink vodka sauce.  DW absolutely loves this stuff and licks the plate clean each time!  I've heard the other items on the menu are not as good but to be honest, who cares?  This is the only thing I need...
2011-02-26,3,Solid, unpretentious, well-cooked traditional Italian food. Not trendy or modern. I've had better for sure in NYC but this is very good and worth checking out. Good service and a nice looking place. Not too pricey. I like it. I lived in Italy for almost a decade and for American Italian food, I have no objections at all to eating here. It's a great place to have around the neighborhood if I'm not heading into the city. I think it is better than Tutta Pasta and Piccolo Roma overall.
2011-02-14,5,You def need to plan ahead as they don't reservations, so go early or go later.  BYOB is a nice plus!  The food is GREAT!  If you can't get into Augustino's, this is def one of the better Italian places in Hoboken.
2011-01-02,3,A solid and consistent traditional Italian restaurant. The service is attentive and personable. The pasta is good and comes in large portions, but it doesn't knock your socks off. I have visited several times and will likely return when next in the mood for a big bowl of pasta.
2010-11-12,4,Stopped in early with my kids on a Friday evening. No wait which actually made me a little nervous. But the place filled up quickly. We all had pasta dishes - fresh and tasty. The service was great.
2010-09-22,4,Went here with family following a graduation party which landed us stuck in the rain.Decently surprised by this place.  Good wait staff, great food, decent prices.I got the veal parmesan which was really well cooked.  The bread they bring to the table was fresh and delicious.  Really cannot complain at all, except maybe for the fact that seating is a little tight.  Otherwise, great place.
2010-09-15,1,this place stinks watch you credit cards and be careful. just watch them very careful there double charge you and then refuse to issue you a refund beaware there many other places then here
2010-08-26,5,This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  Every dish I've ever had there has been simply amazing.  The salmon with mixed mushrooms they have on special is to die for, as are all of their pastas.  My fiance loves the gnocchi bolognese.  The staff is attentive and the head waiter, Feddy, is the sweetest man.  We always have a great time, and always leave totally stuffed and satisfied.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!
2010-08-22,4,A sit-down restaurant that doesn't double as a bar and serves good food is, in my opinion, somewhat of a challenge to find in Hoboken.  And again that challenge of a search was upon me last night.  Cue Trattoria Sapaorito...Pleasant surprise.  Not that I didn't expect there to be good Italian food in this little neighborhood but most of it tends to come in the form of old school delis vs in a more formal setting.  I'm a fan of anything BYOB but don't forget to prepare because the nearest store that has wine for purchase is a good 5+ minute walk each way.  Luckily for us, there was a bit of a wait (about 15min) so we had a chance to pick up a bottle of wine.  (note - no corkage fee)The menu is limited but I actually think that's great.  Do a few things but do them very well instead of a crazy expansive menu with things that are just so-so.  If you're on a budget, stick with pasta...Those are the only dishes under $20 on the menu and the portions are HUGE. Caesar Salad - Definitely big enough to share, but it better be for $10.  Two of us couldn't finish it. Pasta with pesto sauce - Delicious, homemade pasta, cooked perfectly with a wonderful creamy pesto sauce.  It came out steaming hot and was fantastic.  I have at least half of it left to enjoy for a lunch/dinner over the next day or two.  Veal parmesan - I had a bite and it might have been the best veal parm I've ever tasted.  Perfectly salted and cooked and topped with a fresh mozzarella that tasted almost like cream.  It came with a heaping side order of spaghetti as well.  The service was good, the bread, free bruschetta and meal was tasty, and the price was right ($48 for two people, appetizer and two entrees is a bargain in my book).
2010-08-12,4,There are so many 3-star reviews for this place - I guess Hobokenites have very high standards for their Italian food.Pros:FOOD. YES. FOOD. Most of their dishes are amazing. It seems like the chef likes to use a lot of everything, so their food may taste too "strong" (salty, cheesy, you name it) to some patrons, but personally that's how I like my food. I do believe it when they say they make their own pasta because the quality of the pasta is exceptional. The portions are not extreme, just the right amount for an adult to feel comfortably full after an appetizer and an entree. I never had any problems with the staff here on my visits, but it is true that they seem a little disorganized. But at the same time, I think it adds to that folksy feeling an Italian restaurant should have. If you want a perfect service, go to a French or a Japanese restaurant. Cons: The place is expensive. Yes, the food itself might be worth the price, but I'm not sure if the ambiance of the place is worth $20+ for a plate of pasta.  Also the parking can be extremely hard if you don't live in Hoboken, but that's common for all downtown Hoboken restaurants. Overall:I am sure this place beats most of the Italian restaurants in New York City. I go here quite often already, but if it was a bit cheaper than now, I will probably go here pretty much every day.
2010-07-15,4,The special Osso Bucco was awesome ($34, so not cheap) and it was a huge piece.  The risotto that went with it was great.  I could have just had that risotto alone.My husband said the gnocchi with meat sauce was outstanding.  I tried one gnocchi and can only describe it as velvety.  Oooh.Raviolis with cheese fililng & marinara sauce was tasty but portion was SMALL- only 5 of them!  River J's review said the portion was big.  Maybe the restaurant saw my child was ordering so they gypped her.  Bad thing to do to a kid who loves raviolis and could have eaten at least twice as many.Waitstaff seemed brusque at first but turned out to be nice by the end of our meal.
2010-05-02,3,I've been here twice and both times were good experiences.  It's BYO so plan accordingly.  Some key points:-  They will always point out that they "make their own pasta."  I have to admit, never once, anywhere, have I said, "damn, this taste like store-bought pasta," and then threw my fork in disgust.  Either way, it's good pasta.-  Both times I've been was on a Friday night, and I've never had to wait.  -  Recently had the meat ravioli.  It's was very good.  No complaints, and the portion was more than I could finish.  -  Another friend dining with us always goes for the chicken parm (which is touted as made with "mozzarella", which is good but confusing) and swears it's great.-  The service was a little disorganized, but overall they took good care of us.  If there's one negative to point out, it's that we had to argue at bit at the end of the meal to get back the 5 remaining beers in a six pack they had refrigerated for us.  It's not that they said they didn't belong to us, it's that they said they didn't have them.  We did eventually get them back , though.  To be fair, I don't know their intent.  This may be another result of disorganization, and not at all about trying to keep our leftovers.  Overall:  Try it out.
2010-04-02,1,While I've reviewed very few places (if any), going to Trattoria Saporito upset me enough to start.  When we sat down, everything seemed fine and we heard one of the Trattoria waiter/manager recite the specials.  One of the appetizer specials caught the attention of the guests in our party and she asked how much the special was.  The waiter/manager told her that it was $19.95, while all three of our party were clearly seated.  The appetizer and entrees came and it was decent, well-portioned and the BYOB was a plus.  However, the issue that really upset me came at the end of the meal, when we received our check.  The appetizer that we ordered was charged to us at $23.95.  When the issue was brought up to the same waiter/manager, he said it was $19.95, but once we showed him the bill, he started to say some B*S about how it was dependent on how many people were at the table, when clearly we were all seated at the time when we asked.  What did he think we were asking?  Did he think we wanted to know the base cost without asking for the extra dealer add-ins?  We paid and left, but I was not happy.  I can tolerate bad food, bad service, but this irritated me enough to post on Yelp.  While it is only $4 difference, it is the principle of the matter that upsets me.
2010-03-27,3,I ran in here early this week for the first time and was impressed with the food. However, the service is a bit slow and the atmosphere was lame (cranking AC trying to freeze us didn't help.) After wolfing down a loaf a pretty good bread (note that you have to ask for the olive oil and balsamic), we devoured meat filled Ravioli's in meat sauce and Linguine Bolognase. Doubling up on meat sauce entrees didn't really do much for exploring the menu, but it did ensure that these guys would get a return visit. Had the non-food aspects of the meal gone well, I might have thrown down four stars.
2010-01-15,5,I love this place!!! My husband and I have been going here once a month for the last 4 years . The owner & staff are very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is very cozy and authentic Italian.  The food is always fresh and delicious . It's BYOB, so you can bring your favorite bottle of wine while keeping the price of the meal very affordable.I highly recommend the seafood which is  my absolute favorite! I simple love Trattoria Saporito and couldnt go more than 30 days without having my very special dish PESCI AL FERRI , which is out of this world!!!!!!!
2009-12-18,1,This place is absolutely terribleWe're on hour 2 of a "30 minute wait " Twice we were told ten minutes to a table but now were still waiting. The staff is rude and has basically trapped us here. By continually telling us that there would only be a ten minute wait, has caused us to miss opportunities at other restaurants. Its not only us, the staff has been rude to everyone - I just saw them ignore a very polite couple.
2009-11-11,3,Went here several weeks ago. It was recommended by several friends of mine. I was not impressed at all. I had a pasta dish and the sauce tasted like it came out of a can (apparently my friend said it was the best he ever had). The apps were small and flavorless. The service was good and the atmosphere was ok. It's BYOB which is the best part BUT the food is extremely over priced and portions are a bit on the small side. My gf had the ravoli which were eh. Not in a rush to go back.
2009-01-27,3,Stopped here after a recommendation from my friend's mother's friend, who happens to be a little Italian lady that knows how to whip up a mean meal herself.The service here was impeccable, especially after she started speaking in Italian to the waitstaff. I suspect an English-speaking patron would be dealt with differently.Had the seafood medley and gnocchi, both of which were very fresh and very big dishes, impressive lasagna, too, although the size on the lasagna was much smaller than the other dishes, surprisingly.  Seating outdoors until late fall, and deep red tablecloths that are a little tattered at the ends at times. A BYOB, too.
2008-11-24,3,First off, I love that there are so many BYO restaurants in Hoboken and Soporito is one of them.  Soporito's menu consists of your traditional Italian favorites, including pasta, seafood and chicken and meat dishes. We ordered the Penne ala Vodka with chicken and mushrooms and the fettucine bolognese.  Both dishes were very good, and the service was exceptional.  Plus, the free bruschetta appetizer is a nice touch and that alone is worth the visit.  Props to by boy Jared for the recommendation.
2008-11-23,3,I wish i had known this place was BYOB. The lighting is quite dim - so factor that in if you're looking for a romantic place... or not.The seafood risotto was impeccable. Really generous servings of the seafood. We got a plate of bruschetta thrown in for free as an appetizer, I guess they always give that along with the warm bread and butter. The food was a little pricey, but the service was great. The cappuccinos were delicious, we skipped out on dessert because we were stuffed.
2008-11-20,4,This place has really good brushcetta which I think they always give in additon to bread. The fresh mozzarella is also really good.
2008-11-14,2,There's nothing wrong with Trattoria Soporito per se, but it's not really remarkable.  The pastas are ok-- a little overboiled, and the sauces are run-of-the-mill.  It's BYO, which keeps costs down, but somehow we ended up receiving free limoncello at the end of the dinner.  The service was solicitous, so no complaints there, however there are several far better Italian restaurants in Hoboken.
2008-10-28,4,My cousin introduced me to this place for my last meal on my east coast trip. fresh pasta, fresh mozarella = yum!I was surprised this place was crowded on a monday night.  Small restaurant, low lighting, and good service.  We had their special pasta, seafood stuffed ravioli, and penne with sausage, mushrooms in tomato sauce.  The pasta did indeed taste fresh.  My cousin was right, the best part was the fresh mozarella!  For dessert we had their chocolate mousse.  it was not too sweet, and the chocolate just melted in your mouth.  I am not a big fan of chocolate desserts usually but this one i kept on biting off my cousin's fork!  The different layers of chocolates and crust made it wonderful.  i think it made me hyper though because I haven't had that much sugar in awhile!  Good Hoboken first time experience !!!
