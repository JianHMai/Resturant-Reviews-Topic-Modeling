2021-10-10,5,A local treasure, and a real piece of Hoboken history.  Go for the great Italian classics.  Play some Deano on the jukebox, or that skinny local kid.  Embrace the moment, and enjoy the timelessness of the place. Mangia!
2021-07-30,1,Food is excellent but service is horrible.  My wife and I went to have dinner on Friday and the waitress was so disrespectful.  She gave us the wrong order and when we asked to change it she started having a really bad attitude.  Never have we been treated this way in any other restaurant in the NYC/Jersey City area.  So sad that a nice place like this would have such a horrible waitress.
2021-07-29,1,WATCH OUT!! The other night I ordered two chicken meals for me and my husband and was told it would take 40 minutes for pickup.  When I arrived the place was empty and food was already cold.  I signed the receipt and walked away.  The next day I find out the gentleman who charged my credit card decided to TAKE IT UPON HIMSELF TO INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL $12.00 TIP (without my consent). . . Not Cool, Not Right,  Not Fair!!!  Made me wait 40 minutes and food was already cold.  Won't be going back that's for sure.
2021-07-12,1,my wife had days asking meTo take her to this place, what a waste of money, time and food, the food was awful, I ordered a spinach carbonara the worst pasta I had eaten in my life I couldn't finish eating, how can you messed cooking pasta?, my wife ordered some gnocchi that were ok, the sauce lacked flavor.. thank god we ordered a pizza for starter that saved me to starve, we are not ever going back to this place. A food court pasta is better that the one I had here.. without exaggerating the pasta made me nauseous it was so nasty.. I don't understand how they have so many customers
2021-06-26,5,Service goes a long way.Since living in hoboken I have tried many delicious places. However, one of the complaints has always been the serive isn't great. May be contributed to the virus and short staff. But Leo's service was excellent and refreshing since moving here. The waiters were very friendly constantly asking us how the food was. They also have live entertainment on Wednesday and thursday! Great for a nice day to relax and eat some great food. Definitely plan to come back not only for the food, but excellent atmosphere.
2021-06-18,3,Leo's is a place I've been coming my entire life, and probably will for years to come. My family knew the staff... Kathy and Betty were the absolute best. The place was tiny, dark, and smelled like gravy cooking. When it was packed, you waited and the food took a little long but was the best in Hudson county and you could share everything... all while Sinatra blared from the jukebox. Recent visits have been different. Entree's sent back because Truglios closed and they couldn't get veal that came close to that good, free apps with a drink at the bar, mussels served lukewarm or so spicy they were inedible, smaller portions, and almost triple the seating capacity which if you ask me is the reason for the decline. What's worse is no one came to Leo's for chicken cordon blu or bass with purple potatoes... Leo's was the best red sauce joint I ever ate at. A positive is that the red sauce in question still tastes the same after 20 years and Linda is a reminder of the former charm. No one asked for my advice, but I feel such a connection with this place that I had to write something. I'll always support and go back when I can in the hopes that the charm will be back once again.
2021-06-14,5,Delicious food!! Warm bread to start the meal and a large menu with options for everyone! Definitely try the bar pizzas they are the perfect size for an app! Baked ziti came in a skillet and was cooked to perfection with the perfect sauce to cheese ratio.
2021-06-11,1,I picked up an order here after reading so many good reviews, but I was seriously let down. First off, the pasta is Barilla. The sauce all tastes canned and jarred. The penne vodka costs $18. You are better off getting a pasta meal from a nearby pizza place - it will taste better and cost less. I also had one of the veal entrees, which was like cutting and chewing rubber. The bar pie we ordered was okay, and probably the only thing that was remotely close to be worth the price we paid. Altogether, three dishes for $70 is outrageously priced for the quality of food. You are better off ordering pasta from a pizzeria or getting much higher quality food for the same money.
2021-05-28,3,We live nearby Leo's and always see people dining outside so we figured to walk over yesterday since it was so nice outside. We were seated right away and given menus. Unfortunately I had to request a bread basket two times since I saw another table with one who were seated after us. My husband ordered the mortadella and burratta and was not blown away. I ordered the baked clams as an appetizer. It was a giant clam opened, lukewarm and extremely under seasoned. Anytime I've ordered baked clams at an Italian restaurant it would be small clams with plenty of garlic and breadcrumbs seasoning. We were underwhelmed with the appetizers.Hoped maybe our entrees would be better: my husband said the chicken parm was ok. Nothing great. Pretty tasteless. My entree was the mussels in marinara sauce, which came out also lukewarm and tasteless. The sauce barely tasted cooked and had no seasoning of a marinara sauce. I just felt so sad that this local place that always looks crowded was so disappointing. We don't plan on returning and we would not recommend.
2021-05-11,5,I can not speak high enough about Leo's.  If you are looking for fine dining, no, but if you want amazing red sauce dishes, run.  We do tend to be there a fair amount and it's the kind of restaurant that makes one feel like family.  Strong applause for Linda, who you will find behind the bar.  If you are looking for old time Hoboken with casual dining this is the place, where one can feel the spirit of Frank.
2021-02-23,4,The food here is very good. Came on a Monday night without reservations and got seated right away. The tricolor gnocchi and seafood salad was my favorite. The chicken cutlet & veal cutlet was breaded and seasoned perfectly!! Would love if the vodka sauce was a bit more creamier. Overall very good and can't wait to come back!
2021-01-07,5,I LOVE this place. I get takeout occasionally and it's always been great and I appreciate the healthy options.
2021-01-01,5,What can I say. This place is a staple in town.  Bar pie, mussels, veal saltimbocca...madonnnnnnn!!
2020-12-30,5,Leo's has amazing food! We ordered through doordash, order and delivery was seamless. Everything was extremely fresh and tasted so good. We ordered the mussels in white wine sauce, tortellini Alfredo with shrimp and penne ala vodka with chicken. Food was cooked perfectly! Can't wait to dine-in next time!!
2020-11-16,1,Tonight I bought two chicken parm cutlets with linguine from here and it was honestly inedible. The pasta/sauce was okay, but the chicken tasted like it had been sitting out all day. The "fried" outer part of the cutlet fell off and tasted burnt, and the cheese was almost hard. Extremely disappointed. Paid nearly $75 with delivery fee and was only able to eat the pasta.
2020-11-02,5,Great food! Just had mussels and the special beef stew! Out of this world ! And thank u to tessie the best bartender...... highly recommended beef stew
2020-10-10,5,Great spot in Hoboken-- old school, family owned and operated. Food was delicious and a great price. $100 including tip for 2 ppl, drinks, large portions of pasta and dessert. More than enough space between tables and hand sanitizer at each for covid rules. They let us hang out and relax until close. Can't wait to go back!
2020-10-02,5,Leo's Grandevous is not only a Hoboken staple and a previous favorite haunt of Frank Sinatra's, but it is also a delicious restaurant that really lives up to its hype.  I have been there several times since my previous review, including my most recent trip, which was my first since the pandemic began.  The restaurant offered a breadth of outdoor seating options, including several tables on the sidewalk across the street and a few just adjacent to the building, which was where we sat.  Our server approached and handed us separate drink and food menus, which I was hesitant to take hold of with everything going on in the world.  Though they offered hand sanitizer on each table, I still was not thrilled that they did not offer digital menus.  Aside from that, we had a fabulous experience.  I ordered an Aperol Spritz, and as on my previous trips, they made one of the best and most balanced versions of the cocktail.  For my dinner, I went with my favorite Shrimp Sinatra, which consisted of plump shrimp sautéed with artichoke hearts and mushrooms in a herbed white wine sauce.  The dish was typically served over fettuccini, though I substituted spinach to keep it low-carb.  It was absolutely delicious!  My friend loved her Penne alla Vodka as well.Leo's Grandevous offers traditional Italian fare in a comforting environment, making it worth a visit.
2020-08-19,5,I absolutely loved my recent experience at Leo's! They have a great outdoor space across the street and all the staff is super friendly. The Burrata was to DIE for and the baked shells with grilled chicken was delish. The prices were a little high, but for great food and awesome service during this time - totally worth it.
2020-08-16,1,I'm really disappointed in this place during the pandemic.  They have not taken customer safety seriously and just about every time I've come here during the pandemic there are staff not wearing masks properly or at all.  They have also let customers sit at the bar and not wear masks even though they have the takeout food near them.  I'm not going to be back here for a long time at this point.
2020-08-08,5,First time trying Leo's, overall a great experience. Friendly staff & great food. Chicken parm and prosciutto pizza were both delicious. Definitely recommend this spot - will be ordering again soon
2020-07-30,5,My family and I really enjoyed eating here the other night. Because of COVID and no indoor seating, they did a really beautiful job with the outdoor area. We ordered the fried ravioli and the white bar pizza for apps. Both were fantastic but the pizza was my favorite. We then ordered many specials for entrees, but the entree that stood out the most was the gnocchi!! Tessie, our sweet waitress, recommended and did not disappoint! Drinks were delicious, even served in their plastic to go cups (COVID reasons) Support family owned restaurants and come here! Top 5 Italian I've had!
2020-07-20,2,We went here the first weekend of outdoor dining and unfortunately our waiter didn't have their mask on properly (wearing it under the chin)! We were disappointed as this was one of our first times outdoor dining. No one (including the owners were there) addressed the employee.
2020-07-12,5,Already a legendary Hoboken eatery, this Italian gem has nailed everything you want in a COVID world and all restaurants should take notes...Tables spacingTable cleanliness - witnessed thorough table wipe down as well as salt & pepper shakersPlastic cupsPaper napkinsPatron packs "to-go" bagBring paper check without check presenter/holder
2020-07-08,3,I dined at Leo's the third weekend of outdoor dining.  We got there around 7:30 on a Friday and it was only about a 20 minute wait for a table of 2. We were sat in the high top tables next to the restaurant (as opposed to the new dining section they created across the street).  The service wasn't great but the waiter seemed to be hustling as much as he could.  It took a long time and a few prompts to get water, silverware,  butter and plates for our bread.   For our appetizer, we shared the burrata stuffed beef steak tomato with pesto drizzle.  It was good but not out of this world.   For our mains, we each got the Gnocchi trio - I had seen photos of it on Instagram so I really wanted to try it.  I really enjoyed all 3 sauce flavors - it is a pretty heavy dish though so definitely expect to take home leftovers or it would be a good dish to share.
2020-07-01,2,Not impressed. I went here bc of a Recommendation on a blog and was not really excited to eat here. We ordered a beef steak tomatoe with burrata, watermelon salad, and the tri gnocchi. The tomato burrata was literally a tomatoe with a scoop of burrata on topWatermelon salad was good but missing somethingTrio- all about the insta but no taste! Plenty of other good Italian restaurants in the area.
2020-06-05,2,Recently ordered takeout.The fried raviolis weren't breaded, as expectly. They were simply fried and quite hard.. not to mention cold.Penne vodka - the vodka sauce was good, but there are so many better places to get pasta in Hoboken
2020-03-07,2,This is a review of a delivery order so may be better in the restaurant...but I wouldn't order in from them  again.I ordered the cheese sauce gnocchi and got the plain marinara. The meatballs didn't taste home made and the pasta was okay. And they just tossed the bread into the delivery brown paper bag without wrapping it at all, seemingly without care so it was rock hard and cold by the time it got to me.
2020-02-16,4,Small Italian restaurant with great service and great atmosphere.  Waiting staff is very nice and quick with refilling water.  Very family friendly, and love Frank Sinatra.  Ordered the salad, which was good and made to order.  The chicken parmigiana sandwich was very good and not too filling.  Definitely recommended!
2020-02-14,1,What the actual hell! I waited 30 min for the delivery guy to bring my food- and it was cold and small! Last time EVER will I use their services! I need a refund
2020-01-20,1,Placed pick up order for chicken parm, was quoted 20 minutes, went to pick  up, and waited another 20 minutes ((40 total)). Got home, food was cold and there was no cheese on chicken parm. Very confused how you can get something so easy, so very wrong...
2020-01-08,4,Leo's is the prime Italian Jersey dining experience. The food is delicious, the people are great, and the atmosphere feels like your grandmothers dining room! I ordered the veal piccata with spinach and it was so tasty with the perfect sauce. It's hard to find one that's not overpowered by lemon but this was just right. The prosciutto and mozzarella was amazing too, and the wine pours were generous and delicious. The people are incredible too. Liz was our waitress and she was so helpful with our order and wine selection. You could tell she was a real born and bred Jersey girl too.. so friendly and brightened up our whole dining experience! They're also really willing to make accommodations/alterations to menu items.We left with clean plates, full stomachs and are 100% planning our next visit.
2020-01-06,5,Amazing pasta!! They don't do delivery but I order take out and grab it myself. I make sure to pick it up piping hot and also saves me on delivery tip. I've also eaten there a few times - my son's name is Leo and we convinced him that this is his special joint. It is a Hoboken institution with over 80 years and a street named after it. Here are the crowd pleasing dishes we typically go for:Penne alla vodka with shrimpChicken marsala with angel hair pastaMeatballs in marsala sauceStuffed shells with grilled chicken
2019-12-23,1,Ordered pickup, gave them the full hour of the estimated 45-60 mins. Order was entirely forgotten but they played it off like it would be a few minutes. We stood there for around 45 mins for the order to come out, which was not only missing an entire meal, but when the missing meal was brought out it was still wrong and clearly thrown together last minute. Not even an apology or an offer to sit while they made our forgotten order. UPDATE: The Chicken Marsala came with free food poisoning :(
2019-11-15,5,Brought my family here for my birthday and everyone was impressed. Amazing food, great portions and the server was friendly and quick.
2019-11-15,5,Great food, exactly the type of atmosphere I was looking for when I searched Italian food on google and took an Uber from JC. Absolutely worth it. Management was EXCELLENT handling a situation that was my mistake. Will definitely be back when I'm on the east coast to satisfy my Italian cravings.
2019-11-12,5,Classic Hoboken spot. Established in 1939. The place is adorned with Sinatra pictures and memorabilia of the time. Must visit in Hoboken. Great family spot and feel good spot. Feels like you're at a big Italian family's Sunday night dinner.
2019-10-29,5,I came here in the August during restaurant week. The price was right and the atmosphere quite relaxing. I honesty thought the food was delicious. I came with my friend who ordered watermelon and feta which looked amazing. I ordered some dishes I never had before. Below I'll write my first impressions on each dish I ate.Appetizer: Beef Tartare w/ quail egg - It did taste a tad bit metallic but overall this was a hit for me. The quail egg was so rich that it enhanced the meats texture. Main Dish: Fig and Prosciutto stuffed quail over potato pancake, madeira wine sauce - This dish was so tasty. Saltiness from the prosciutto mixed with the sweetness of the fig was pure harmony. Ice Cream Brownie - dessert was okay. They put it together fast. Overall, I would recommend this place for a cozy night out in the city.
2019-10-14,2,Unsure what is so special about this place other than the Sinatra mystique.  Service was generally poor-long wait for waiter despite restaurant mostly empty, couple of bland pasta dishes.  But at least it was cheap.
2019-10-07,4,The oldest restaurant in Hoboken has survived for a very good reason, good traditional Italian food. Not fancy but really good. Service was very good and attentive. Must have the mussels, which is available in several sauces. The marinara was our choice and there is plenty of bread to soak up the tasty sauce. The minestrone was very fresh with plenty of vegetables and a great broth. Scungilli Fra Diavolo was perfect and spicy. Clams and linguini had about a dozen clams on top. Wine list has many choices starting at around $30.
2019-09-28,2,Good for the price but I wish they had better pizza crust. I have got cheese pie twice and there are no chili flakes or anything on the side which is odd for the pizza delivery.
2019-09-24,3,Second time eating here, first time really good, B+ food and service with an A atmosphereUnfortunately, second time , a Saturday night, I made reservations for 11, my family from Florida. I wanted to expose them to a really good Italian Hoboken restaurant that would leave them wanting to come back and impress them. I left having to apologize to them for the restaurant, making excuses that perhaps they were too busy to serve good food.The service was slow and un-attentive, the baked clams were under cooked and raw, the sausage on my brother in laws main course was over cooked and hard as a rock, my meal, the Frank Sinatra pasta dish was under cooked and tasteless.I will probably say that overall the restaurant is good, only if there is no one in the restaurant, once it gets busy, it's not good.My recommendation, drive to Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, it's worth the trip.
2019-08-13,5,Wow. Best Italian meal I've had in a very long time. Nothing needs improvement at all. Don't change anything! I love all the Frank Sinatra memorabilia in the restaurant and has the required Frank in Jail Booking photo. The third generation owner greeted me and exchanged a great conversation since there wasn't a crowd. The place has personality and oozes class. Full bar. I had the veal, so good, nice a light, fresh, good breading and not over cooked. Just the right flavor of the sauce. Side of meatballs put this over the top. Meatballs that taste like meatball and not filler. With places like this why do people go to Olive Garden? Hats off to the cooks and Nick (owner) on keeping tradition alive and not selling out! Veal A#1 = $22.00, Shrimp Cocktail $11.00, Meatballs and a coke.
2019-08-07,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Every time I go in the vibes are amazing. I love the ambiance, the music and the lighting. You are greeted right away and it feels like a friendly, neighborhood hello. The service has always been great and the people are cheerful. The food is always delicious and the prices are extremely fair. I love the bar pies for an appetizer, they are delicious. The bottles of wine are also fair price and not ridiculous. Leo's is doing it right still and there's no wonder why they've been around for 80 years. I highly recommend this place!
2019-06-22,5,First time trying Leo's. Was recommended by a few coworkers who have lived in Hoboken for decades. The bread that they bring out before you place your order was decently warm but nothing special. I'd rate 7/10. My girlfriend and I ordered the Margherita Bar Pizza and the Fried Raviolis for appetizers. I'd honestly rate the pizza 10/10. It was some of the best pizza I've ever tasted. As for the raviolis, I'd rate them somewhere like 6.5/10. Being my first time trying fried raviolis I was unsure what to expect. They were pretty dry but were definitely tasty. For a main entree I ordered the Cavatelli and Broccoli. It was very good but needed some cheese to add flavor to it. The sauce was a 9/10, while the broccoli and pasta itself prob fall into the 7.5 range. Overall, the service was above average. It wasn't too crowded and it was a very chill setting. Definitely looking to go back in the near future.
2019-04-28,4,We came for the first time in over 15 years, we had moved away from the area but were so pleased to see the original place is still here and being run by family members.  We sat at the bar and Phyllis is still there, she has been here for 30 years.  It's a good local place, welcoming, down home atmosphere, very nice staff.  The young "kids" working there were all very sweet, attentive, energetic and nice to talk to.  Since we were at the bar, we would have conversations when they came for drink orders.  Lovely girls I must say.  Had the Leos salad which was always my fav, and it still is.  I love the salami and provolone cheese on the salad, brought back memories. My hunny had the mussels in wine sauce and as they were years ago, still a big draw to the restaurant.  Next I had the pasta with short rib ragu ( a special that night).  This was a very disappointing. The meat was tender but the sauce was non existent.  My pasta tasted like meat and water.  I think the chef needed to give the pot a stir and it would have been better. There was barely any "sauce" on the pasta. Hunny had a pizza also very good. Even though I would never get that pasta dish again, the salad, mussels and pizza all were winners. If you plan on having several glasses of wine, I recommend getting the bottle, it works out much more economical than buy the glass. We really were looking to hang out for the late Sunday afternoon when parking is easy so my hunny had a bottle of wine...I was driving so no biggie. Good afternoon, again, nice staff. We will come back, glad to be back in the area
2019-04-23,4,Dinner was good but i wasn't "wowed" by anything. The mussels and Caesar dressing weren't as flavorful as I thought they would be. The ambiance was nice. I liked how it had an older feel and you could tell it has been there forever.
2019-03-20,5,Excellent! My boyfriend and I came in Sunday night to try this place out since we live pretty close. We sat at the bar. It was cute in side. I like the dim romantic lighting. It wasn't that busy which is nice sometimes. Service was great. We were immediately greeted. We got warm crostini with butter which had the perfect crunch. We tried the mussels with marinara. Great flavor and cooked perfect. Nice portion size. We got two pizzas. Both were very good. One with buffalo chicken and the other with prosciutto. Prosciutto was thick cut. The buffalo chicken was perfect. Would order it again! We were very full.
2019-03-09,5,This place is always a good meal. I've had a few different pasta dishes and they're always delicious the muscles are some of the best I've had. They also are always warm friendly appreciative of your business and pour a very generous glass of VinoHoboken has a ton of Italian joint but Leo's is as good as any
2019-01-28,5,Leo's was very quaint and cozy! We had a great meal and the service was wonderful. Our server was very kind and helpful and everything came out in a timely manner. Not to mention the food was all DELICIOUS!
2019-01-24,5,Came to Leo's on a Saturday night and were seated immediately. Having passed the restaurant multiple times on the outside, it's surprisingly large when you go in. It's also bustling. The decor is classic and the bar looks great. The service was very friendly and we end up sharing bread, mussels fradiavolo and a mozzarella bar pie as well as tiramisu. I ordered the veal parm and she the chicken parm. Both came with a side of linguine. Wine by the bottle doesn't go higher than 39 with the by the glass options at 4. There are also cocktails and beer. Frank Sinatra apparently loved this place. It's a nice place for locals and reasonable priced and everything is served hot and well made. Nothing was mind blowing but when you pay like 5 bucks for the bar pie you have to calibrate. I'll definitely be back. Everything was excellent.
2019-01-23,3,Our visit was underwhelming. Our waiter was not very attentive or welcoming, and made us feel as if we were a bother. The food was average but based upon the way I felt I will not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone. They cannoli shell tasted stale. Sad to say the best part of our meal was the cappuccino.
2018-12-28,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The food is always amazing and the people here are so great. 10/10 must try.
2018-12-21,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5. Carpaccio had a wonderful medley of textures! The soft beef with slight sear combined well with the sturdy Parmesan chunks and the fresh arugula added a good peppery bite. The lamb was absolutely fantastic! It was beautifully tender being a good medium and cut thick to give that savory bite. The mint pesto made it even more umami and fragrant while the Madeira sauce moistened up the whole plate with flavor. The vegetables were good as well being a perfect fork tender. The ricotta cheesecake was alright; sweet and soft but the quality difference from the other dishes were clear and probably outsourced.Service - 4/5. Friendly and professional.Value - 5/5. The selection they offer for restaurant week is great and many items are specials that they don't even offer on the regular menu. Restaurant week is great for restaurants and customers alike to try new things and I'm glad the chef was being adventurous. The delicious three course ran at $39 which is an awesome deal. Great value!Parking - Street (Free)
2018-12-10,5,The Best Italian Food around! We often take a 1 hour trip to Leo's...why? Because it is worth it!!!! Classic Italian food along with some inventive, new twists.  Wonderful atmosphere and attentive, friendly service. Leo's granddaugther, Grace, is a professional and warm hostess and when we dine here we know that her grandfather is smiling up in heaven. A family-owned business like this is a rare gem. Right now, the restaurant is decorated beautifully for the holidays and they have live entertainment, too!
2018-11-23,5,Happy Holidays!!Today I visited Leo's and to my surprise the food, and friendliness has not changed. I have been visiting Leo's since 1983. The Mussels are to die for in Marinara sauce and still the same in 2018. My warmest regards to Leo's Grandson and the clan for keeping the family traditions. Keep it up. Thank you. Luis.
2018-11-18,5,One of the best Italian restaurants in town.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, good drinks. Service was friendly and on top of things.  I can't stress enough how homemade the food tasted.  The bar is big and it was great to sit there and eat when a game was on.  Highly recommend!
2018-11-14,4,This is a nice neighborhood bar which used to be Frank Sinatra hangout place - pictures on all walls! The food is good basic Italian and cooked from scratch. Good wine selection too. We went there for lunch and we split some of the personal pizzas and then had veal Parmigiana, eggplant rolatini and clams for main courses. Great lunch spot!
2018-11-11,3,This review is based on a delivery order.Allegedly this was my husband's Sunday Italian dinner go-to years ago when he lived in Hoboken, when he didnt feel up for cooking.  Unfortunately I was not as impressed as he seemed to be years ago.Overall I would say the prices are too high given the quality of food.  They are a bit on the higher end (20+ for entrees) but I would argue the ones we ordered are comparable to what you can get at any pizza place (for cheaper).  The chicken in our chicken marsala was definitely over cooked.  The flavor was ok.  I also ordered the caprese salad which had very unripe tomatoes in it (yuck).  We also started with the clams, mussel, and shrimp app which WAS very tastey.  And finally we also got one of their bar pies which was good but SO small.  I actually laughed when opening the box and seeing the size.  All in for just under $100 I would probably go some place else next time.  There are too many really good Italian restaurants in the Hoboken/JC area.
2018-10-23,5,Good food- they had a big selection of specials..love the old school atmosphere and all the frank sinatra pictures on the wall, friendly and attentive waitress, reasonable prices
2018-09-26,5,Best Italian food in Hoboken hands down!This place is definitely worth a shot if your looking for a nice hearty Italian meal. Parking is not impossible if your not taking metro so that was a big plus for us!I kept it basic and ordered the chicken Parmesan. The sauce was a fine balance and complemented the protein well. I recommend the spicy sausage and broccoli rabe for an appetizer...completely exceeded expectations!Service was right to the point, never had an empty glass, 5 stars all day long!
2018-09-26,4,Great option for dinner! I live right next to Leo's in Hoboken so I come here about once every other week. Luckily, they have a decently sized menu so there's a lot to choose from. The restaurant gives off an old school Italian feel, which is very welcoming. The staff have been great every time we've dined there. They pour the wine to the brim of each glass so you are definitely getting what you paid for. Same goes for the food, decent portion sizes that are not overpriced. While it is probably the best Italian food in Hoboken, to me that isn't saying much considering there aren't many other good options. I would say the food is good, or obviously I wouldn't keep coming back, but it could be better. I've had much better Italian at small restaurants like this one. But for the location and all around vibe of the place, it is a great option in Hoboken!
2018-08-26,5,We came here on New Year's Eve for dinner. We got there early, around 6PM, because we figured it would be mobbed. We were immediately seated in the back dining room. The food was delicious and all of us kept saying we couldn't believe we had never eaten there before! Definitely a good spot to come for a cozy dinner in Hoboken.
2018-08-26,5,Amazing authentic delicious food, service that makes you feel like you're family and ambiance that puts your right back in the brat pack era! I've been looking for a place that feels really authenticity Italian and not forced or fake... this is it! Everything they had was delicious...the Barbara, Leo's salad... and homemade gluten free pizza and ravioli cannolis you might kill for.. My family was in heaven. So glad we found this gem, for sure our new place!
2018-08-23,5,well, i do know that Francis Albert Sinatra was born in Hoboken. the walls are decorated with his photographs. my niece is a recent resident of Hoboken. she recommended this italian restaurante to our family. there is an old world feel that comforts like home. the bread and dipping sauce is one of the highlights besides the entrees. i don't know where the bread is baked but it's on point. the dipping sauce had some kick which satisfied me. i ordered the baked clams as well as the rigatoni bolognese. my sister and her family requested the hunter's medley appetizer. i tasted the mozzarella and prosciutto. it will definitely one of the most artful cheeses and ham portions. the entree was served quite warm in temperature. the sauce for the bolognese really impressed me. it felt like an old fashioned mamma's recipe. i was starving after so much bread and water. i finished my pasta entree and could have had room for dessert. i would no doubt commend Leo's Grandevous to anyone who is intrigued with Hoboken's Italian background. Ciao Bella,Jt
2018-08-22,5,I saw this place featured on the Food Network as one of the best Italian Restaurants in the country and the excellent reviews were definitely spot-on!  We've eaten here twice and both times the food, service, and ambiance were exceptional!  This is definitely that type of authentic Italian Place you expect when you think of old school Italian Dining!  Food is delicious and prepared with love.  Portions are generous and the staff make you feellike family.  Linda and Chad are amazing servers and Grace (the lovely granddaughter of Leo) is an amazing hostess!  Definitely come here and enjoy the history, the food, and the total experience!
2018-08-20,1,I was there on a Sunday night , the person at the bar was veryy rude and very bad customer experience, no smiles and I was so upset. We were seated at the corner of the restaurant and the waiter who came to take the order had no smile or greeting. THIS place is absolutely not recommended.
2018-08-01,3,I was complaining to a friend who lived in Hoboken for many years about the lack of good Italian food, and she immediately recommended Leo's. I stand by my complaint. I came here for lunch and was very unimpressed, overall. The food lacked flavor (I tried adding salt and the shaker was all caked up and I had to take the cap off). They had soap operas on the TV playing really loudly. It was peak lunchtime and there was nobody else there. My meal came to almost $30. Get a lunch menu, Leo's. Your food isn't worth that much.Maybe it's better for dinner?
2018-07-27,3,My workplace orders from here often. Penne vodka is DELICIOUS it'll make you want another plate. Bread that comes with catering orders is chewy could be way softer. Eggplant parm was ok nothing extraordinary. I would like to come visit this place and have something other than what they cater to my workplace. Overall decent place, their penne vodka is my favorite thus far.
2018-07-09,5,Food was great and the service was amazing. We've been coming here since the 80's and it keeps getting better every time we visit
2018-07-07,1,Where to begin the restaurant is empty it's Saturday Night. We get seated in corner the back of restaurant next to the kitchen. Food was tasteless nor hot. I was hotter than the food was. The staff was nice but didn't ask if there was a problem with the food we didn't eat. Oh well lesson learned.
2018-06-05,5,This place is literally magical - the people that say the food isn't good are absolutely insane.First got the smoked mozzarella red pepper tomato sauce - life changed.Then i got the spinach ravioli dish, the only thing i wish is the raviolis would be non stop forever.Very clean and super nice waitress.I'll probably be back Friday with my boyfriend
2018-05-28,4,Second time around, it's was very good , faster service and excellent mussels .We ll defensively come back for some late limoncello at the bar
2018-05-26,5,Gnocchi done right!This is one of the few Italian restaurants that has excellent gnocchi. Before I move on to the rest... If you don't know what gnocchi is, it's a good way to gauge an Italian restaurant.There's "good" Italian restaurants...and then Italian restaurants that know how to make gnocchi... If the gnocchi is good, you know it's a solid place.If you don't like gnocchi... Make sure you tried here before you write it off, because this place makes it right!Moving on to the rest...Bread was excellent.Mussels in red sauce - (excellent, and excellent execution on the sauce)Clams- (also excellent).. perfectly cooked and fresh... And a little bit of breading to them so good... Wish it was dinner time againMozzarella with prosciutto and artichoke hearts. - ... Honestly this was amazing I don't know what they did to the mozzarella but it was on point, and the artichoke hearts were the best I've ever had. And the prosciutto was just perfect.. meaning it wasn't stringy (This may have been a special, but look for it in the pictures)Veal saltimbocca - good prosciutto and a good cheese, the sauce was excellent. Light, with serious flavor. ... You might think this dish is Universal everywhere, but this was excellent... Perfect cut of veal.. almost melted in my mouth, so tender. The breading was also perfect on the vealVeal parmesan- honestly... Perfect breading perfect cut of veal... And the sauce, that red sauce is amazing.Gnocchi- I'm going to say it again, it was amazing! Also one of gnocchis was in Bolognese sauce..  I think that needs a separate category.Bolognese sauce - excellent on point... Definitely lots of meat in this sauce, they did not skimp on anything. Perfect!If you're questioning which place to go to, I have been all over New Jersey in search of an excellent Italian restaurant. I do not leave a review unless the restaurant is excellent. ... That being saidThere are bad restaurants, okay restaurants, "good" restaurants. GOOD restaurants. .. and then there is excellent.This place was excellent!Also the espresso was solid. You might think that's something standard, but if you go to a lot of Italian restaurant some of them don't know how to make a good espresso, and this one was on point!
2018-05-21,4,The menu at Leo's is absolutely huge. This is the place to go if you are craving a classic Italian restaurant experience and the menu has basically any dish that you could want. There are a ton of pasta, chicken, veal and seafood options to choose from.No reservations - first come first serve. On a Friday night at around 8 it was pretty crowded. I was expecting to wait for an hour plus but luckily we only had to wait for a half hour. And then that half hour wait consists of drinking an Aperol spritz at the bar then it really isn't so bad.The interior is cozy and warm. Loved the pictures of Frank Sinatra all over the walls! On to the eats. To start we split the hunters platter which came with olives, cheeses and meats. The fresh mozz and fresh parm were delicious. I'm not a mussels person, but my friends who are big fans of Leo's before swear by them. I tried some of the spicy red dipping sauce with bread and it was absolutely delicious. For my main I was torn between veal parm and ravioli. Luckily my finace ordered the parm so I was able to get the ravioli and try both. The ravioli was stuffed with spinach and topped with Alfredo sauce and prosciutto and was absolutely delicious. I snuck a few bites of the veal parm which was definitely tasty, but not what I had expected it to be. For the $22 price tag I did think that the portion of veal was a bit small and expected the piece of veal to more breaded and crispy. Instead it felt a little mushy. Only knocking off a star for that, otherwise I felt that this was a five star experience all around. Loved the vibes here. There aren't as many places to grab classic and delicious Italian food in downtown JC, so next time I have a craving I won't hesitate to take the short trip over to Hoboken to grab some Leo's.
2018-04-19,5,Hoboken at its best.  An intimate experience enhanced by a great menu and wonderful staff.A combination of the short rib special (to die for), fresh seafood and Tiramisu was outstanding!
2018-04-16,5,Top notch. One of the best Italian restaurants in Hoboken, good staff, food, portions, prices etc. I would recommend this place to anyone
2018-01-08,5,What a night ! Food was delicious , Osso Buco fell off the bone , Scungilli Fra Diablo was amazing , Carbonara was spot on. To top it all off Alonzo our waiter was very enjoyable , very friendly and accomodating. Great night we WILL be back.
2017-12-13,5,Great food, friendly service...would definitely recommend and go again!Chicken marsala was delicious and others in my party tried dishes with red sauce and said theirs were great too.
2017-12-10,1,I'm surprised this place is still open. The last time I went the food and service was horrible. The servers act like we were begging for free food. It's such a tourist trap.
2017-11-18,4,Pretty awesome food. Most authentic I've ever had. I ordered the four cheese gnocchi with a side of broccoli and a bottle of Cabernet. Food was fantastic and the wait time was short. Tables were situated very close to other diners so the atmosphere was lacking and our waitress was a little odd and over the top. Other than that, one of the best Italian meals I've ever had.
2017-11-12,5,Took my 8 year old and 11 year old nieces here for pizza.  They LOVED it, my nieces told this was the best pizza they ever had (and believe me, these little girls consider themselves quite the pizza critics) and keep begging me to take them back!   I had a salad with grilled chicken and it was super fresh and tasty. What a great place to stop in for lunch as well as dinner! Super friendly people and service.  Love it.
2017-11-10,3,ate a personal pizza from here last night. pretty good. classic italian food and gives off that old hoboken feel. solid!
2017-11-09,1,First review on yelp ever but something needs to be said...... we were really excited to eat here since some of us have been here in the past... meals were not worth the money. Mozzarella sticks - amazing Garlic bread - tasted like toasted bread Cavatelli w broccoli (added sausage) - our cavatelli was tasteless and tasted like pasta water. The sausage was pink and tasted like a rubber glove. Couldn't even bare the taste of that sausage Carbonara - first off.. It comes w red sauce??? It would be great if the menu mentioned It wasn't carbonara but instead pasta w red sauce and bacon. Chicken francese was small and not worth the money. Gnocchi was chewy (and not in the good way) pasta sauce tasted like a jar of canned tomatoes... worse than a jar of ragu. All in all the meal was subpar. I've never left a review but the restaurant needs to keep consistency and do something about their low standards. I was really disappointed.
2017-11-05,1,Been to Leo's a handful of times and every time leaves me feeling the same.  The food is decent but very overpriced for the portion/quality.  The dishes should be about 30% cheaper for what is offered.  They should get a 3 star rating for that part alone however the 1 Star is due to my most recent experience on a casual Sunday night.  Placed order of a salad, veal dish and pasta. It took 30+ minutes for the salad and almost an hour for the entrees.  Oh and the order was wrong. Waiter did not acknowledge long wait or poor service.  Had to hound the bus boy for service.It's a bit disappointing as this place should be a good casual Italian restaurant but needless to say I feel it's gotten enough of an opportunity to impress and has consistently fallen flat. This last time is the nail in the coffin.
2017-11-03,5,My business partner and I visit Leo's regularly. It is one of Hoboken's finest dining establishments with great food, friendly, attentive service and chock full of Frank Sinatra memorabilia.  The proprietors Nick and Grace are always warm and friendly when you visit.  We love this restaurant.  Please avail yourself to the daily specials and gnocchi dishes.  Open since 1939, they are truly a treasure in Hoboken.
2017-10-28,1,Do you want a throwback to the old days where male employees could say fun things to ladies like calling them a b@tch or telling them to suck them? Well this is your place!!! It is applauded and encouraged for their staff to speak to women this way, and they are rewarded with a nice glass of wine at the bar. We've eaten there many times, but never again. Simply disgusted
2017-10-15,5,Leo's is some damn good Italian food. First, lets start with the atmosphere. It's not fancy but has a cozy feel to it. When you walk in there is a bar and a few high top tables, then a good amount of tables in the back. There are pictures of Frank Sinatra everywhere (he used to eat there).  I've tried a bunch of different dishes, bar pies, salads, pasta and chicken. Everything is great but my favorite is the bolognese!!! It's to die for. The bar pies are great too, so many topping choices and very inexpensive. If you haven't tried Leo's, do it.
2017-09-16,5,the mussels fra diavolo are amazing. highly recommend to anyone who lives in town
2017-08-26,3,This was my second time at Leo's on a Tuesday night for dinner. The food is good but the service leaves something to be desired.  She was not only slow, she forgot was requested and seemed like she forgot about us until she walked to the kitchen, where we could see in the window she was having a grand old time only to have her walk straight out without our items.  I really hope management reads some of these reviews because this person should be retrained or put in a different position.  Ive never been so disappointed but to top the evening off, she hands our 90 year old mother the bill.  I mean really.  We sat her at the head of the table because she has problems getting in and out, but my bf and her son were seated on either side which she could have easily handed the bill to either one.  If someone wants to talk to me about this, ill gladly respond.
2017-08-24,5,Came in after doing a yelp search looking for pizza. Met the owner Nick when I arrived and he was very courteous and polite. The bar pie was very good. I would definitely recommend checking out Leo's!
2017-08-06,5,Best old school  Italian restaurant in Hoboken the very vintage and classy bet frank Sinatra can walk in there and still think it looked the same .. keep up the great work !
2017-08-03,5,This was my second time at Leo's and I had a great meal. We sat outside and the service was a little slow but the food is so great. I had shrimp parm and I would definitely recommend this entree
2017-07-25,5,This is absolutely one of my favorite places in hoboken. This has become my go to place to eat with my girlfriend, everything from the mood to the food is fantastic! You must try their white mussels!!
2017-07-08,2,Been coming here very sporadically for 20 years.  Generally, I stick to the basics (parm and pastas) and they are good enough.  It's a quaint, charming old school italian joint that pays homage to Hoboken's Italian and Sinatra heritage. However, we deviated from the plan last week and ordered two things that were awfully bad:Chicken Marsala:  It was horrific.  It was sickeningly sweet.  Not sure what they are thinking about having a sweet main course, but this dish is really off.  Either they use a very cheap sweet Marsala wine or sugar (yes, it was that sweet).  Generally, Marsala calls for dry Marsala wine.  Sweet Marsala is used for desserts.  Soup:  We had a cup of Minestrone.  In short, they use cheap, flavorless canned broth and the soup has little flavor.  Minestrone soup is supposed to be the exact opposite as it packs tons of flavor.  However, Leo's version is devoid of flavor and seems reminiscent of a few vegetables floating around in faux chicken broth.  Overall, I get the Sinatra schtick, but the food is mediocre at best.  In Manhattan, this place wouldn't last as the market is much more competitive.
2017-06-14,2,I like you Leo's, but your sauce is just not good. At all. The atmosphere is comfortable and cool w the Sinatra vibe.. But anytime I eat there I think 'this is just NOT good Italian food, how come soo many people rave about it? I guess Leo's is good for non-Italians who don't know any better.
2017-06-08,5,I'm a big Frank Sinatra fan and visit Hoboken regularly even though I live in Forest Hills, Queens. I'm retired and eat in Leo's about once a month for lunch. Food is great, atmosphere is great, staff is great, clientele is great and they always feed money into the juke box for me to play the greatest music ever made - Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jimmy Roselli, Nat King Cole and the rest of the great WWII generation singers. The Sinatra theme is fantastic and it was really great to be there for Frank's 100th birthday celebration. Great traditional Italian restaurant!
2017-06-04,1,Better pasta sauce can be found in a jar from my local corner store. I think they actually just dump tinned tomato purée over their dishes.
2017-05-29,5,Great food, quiet, away from bustling Hoboken. Good prices. Really nice time, I will definitely go back
2017-05-18,5,Been there tons of times- best Italian spot in Hoboken... love the Sinatra connection
2017-05-16,5,Delivery. We got delivery because me and wifey didn't want to get out and about. The food was on time. Delicious just like eating there. Fresh food. This was one of the best if not the best delivery we have had in Hoboken.
2017-04-25,5,Everyone says it's like "grandma's cooking", but I don't have an Italian grandma. So I can just tell you that it was really good!
2017-02-20,5,We have been going here since we were young. Stopped by on Saturday night because I was craving some mussels and bar pies. I was not disappointed as the food is just the same as it's always been. The atmosphere, staff and food were terrific. I had the mussels which were clean and delicious. The bar pies are exactly the same, scrumptious. Then we are shrimp parm sandwiches with home made fries-YUM !Nice to see the grandchildren are carrying on the restaurant's traditions. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone. If you are in Hoboken and looking for a great place to have some good Italian food stop by Leo's !
2017-02-17,4,waitress was friendly with my two year old daughter and tolerated the mess that she made. (BIG PLUS) downfall was that the sauce tasted like it was out of a can. flavorless. meatballs were dry and bland ( had the same sauce) not a fan at all. The chicken piccata though was perfect! enjoyed the clams and mussels very much, seasoned well and tasted fresh. I loved how kid friendly the place was and my daughter LOVED everything we ordered.
2017-02-15,5,Great food! I had shrimp scampi and I would definitely recommend this dish. As well as re bruschetta appetizer.
2017-01-25,2,Lady on the phone is rude. Did not bother eating there. Would rather go and spend my money elsewhere. Shameful.
2016-12-23,5,Beat place in Hoboken for all things delicious! The waiters are gorgeous and gracious and the bartenders serve 'em strong.
2016-12-12,2,Good Sinatra style neighborhood spot.  The food was much better several years ago (the sauces and some of the dishes used to have more flavor).The atmosphere is old school but weirdly mixed with some new fixtures.  The staff is very nice and attentive, but as far as the food you do not get one bit of authenticity. Don't expect too much and you will enjoy it.
2016-11-20,2,Ok... So this was going to be an OK review but something at the end that just burns my A**... which drives this down.  Looking for a quick place in Hoboken that fit the bill this past Friday Night..  Casual, good reputation, a little atmosphere, and good food... So off we go and arrive to this well thought of place by many in the Yelp community as well as a recomendation from our concierge at our Hotel. First off I HATE HOBOKEN....  An hour to get there from Secacus because some brain surgeon decides to shut down them main artery for construction at 7PM during rush hour.... Then you get there to "LEO's" and there is absolutely no parking so you have to 2 blocks "LONG BLOCKS" to the parking garage and then walk back... Place is real quaint, big half moon type bar with real casual dining tables very old place with paper napkins... in short its not formal dining but that is OK..  Supposed to be A Sinatra place with Sinatra music, but I didn't hear anything. So we arrive and its JUMPING every table taken the bar is packed and we are seated in the back near the kitchen when a table opens and its directly under the A.C vent which now I know why nobody is sitting there... our server says no problem move to next table... which we do and are told nope can't have that one need it for a bigger party so we move again and this time it's different servers area so nobody comes to us for 15 minutes STRIKE 1.  Order some wine which was not over priced by any means the win menu was fair. Finally Grace the original Owners Grandaughter a very nice lady take our order.... Fresh bread really tasty is provided.  We order a Hot Antipasto for 2 which some things were excellent while others just ok.   The Mozerella sticks were store bought deep fried and well you get the idea, the dipping marinara was a little thin but tasty.  Baked clams were tasty but not piping hot as were the famous mussels.. clean and tasty but not hot enough.  Real winner was some of the best Eqqplant Rolotini I've ever had... Entrees....House Special tonight was a parpadella pasta with pulled short ribs in a marinara... I personally thought the pasta was over cooked and again entree was NOT piping hot Other entree which was a veal Saltamboca .. which was very good quality veal, over spinach with demi glaze and mushrooms. All good quality ingredients but sauce was very bland..  Side of Pasta no up charge angel hair with olive oil and garlic was a winner... OK so we decide to head to the bar for coffee and after dinner drink...  and here is where it gets wierd.. Grace on her way out the door I had paid the check and tipped her very nicely... walks by and says thank you ... and tells the bartender red headed girl There coffee and after dinner drinks are on me... she acknowledges this.. and then as we are leaving says its $20.00..... I mention Graces offer which by the way I didn't solicit and she just says Sorry didn't hear her.. and takes my $20.00....  Honest mistake possibly but honestly I don't think so.. Figured we were 1 timers and she'd make a quick $20.00Summing it up... if the incident at the bar hadn't happened I'd probably been a 3 star good yea I'd go back type place but after that... Sorry folks better options out there.. trust me the $20.00 bucks doesn't mean a dam thing to me, but don't take advantage like that.. that's just Rude.
2016-11-07,5,Not sure how anyone could give Leo's a negative review - it's some of the best Italian in North  Jersey. You can smell the garlic simmering from blocks away. Everything we've ever ordered comes out quick, hot and full of flavor and authenticity. It's a small place so beware of showing up on a Friday or Saturday at 7PM and expecting not to wait. I also wouldn't recommend going with a party larger than 4 people. On my most recent trip there it was a Saturday night and they were offering a $20 bottle of Chianti as a special - score!
2016-11-02,3,Hit or miss every single time. That being said, we keep coming back because there have been some good hits. This past weekend's delivery experience was EXTREMELY SUB PAR - food was 2 hours (we live 1 block away) and yes, we got delivery... but it was raining and we were hungover. We called a few times to see what the delay was, and they 1st said it was on the way, then 30 mins later said they were just making it....? There was barely any sauce on both of our pastas - we ordered Penne Vodka and Fettuccine Alfredo. Extremely watery. 1 note - when the mussels are good, this is one of the best mussel sauces i have ever had. (when they are good).Also, don't go on Sunday nights - the amount of kids in there will drive a sane person crazy.
2016-10-01,5,Absolutely delicious garlic bread with cheese and last with meat sauce. I don't order anything else but have been coming for the last 16 years and the quality is so consistent and delicious, we keep coming back. Very friendly staff. This is a legacy Hoboken joint and is very authentic old school Hoboken complete with juke box and Frank Sinatra photos on the wallWell worth a visit for dinner!
2016-09-15,5,There are a handful of Italian joints in Hoboken, but none of them stand up to Leo's. The mussels fra diabolo are an absolute must. Their 3 cheese gnocchi is incredible and their chicken parm is also great. I've never had a bad meal from here, which can't be said for other Italian joints in town. If your in the area and looking for a good authentic Italian meal, I would recommend stopping in.
2016-09-06,3,Solid dependable Italian food.  This place is not looking to revolutionize the old standbys but rather provides reliable and tasty staple comfort food.  Their chicken franchese and penne vodka are standouts if you're not too full from chowing down on their delicious hot Italian bread! I bring my family here from out of town & country to experience some NJ Italian nosh - its so unique and good.
2016-08-23,5,Leo's is incredible. I felt right at home (and like I went back in time) as soon as I stepped in. Everyone is so friendly and there are many regulars. My two friends and I tried various drinks made by Nick (he's the best!). The bar pies are so cute and perfect to fill you up -- so many different kinds and a staple at Leo's. The pasta was delish and you should definitley ask for an order of mussels or mussels oreganata. The mussels are how Leo's all started! The cappuccino and nutella mousse were INCREDIBLE. Make sure you ask if they have any of the mousse available. You cannot leave without having it. I'm upset I didn't visit sooner and I can't wait to go back! Thank you, Nick and Grace!
2016-07-27,5,The food tastes like it was made in heaven and the staff is extremely friendly!! If you're looking for a great date night or family get together I highly suggest this place. Thanks for having us!!!
2016-07-20,4,The wife and made our annual trek to the East Coast to visit relatives.  Although we generally stay at the Sheraton Lincoln Harbor in Weehawken, NJ we had never made it into Hoboken for dinner until this trip.  I'm glad we did.  The place is filled with wonderful neighborhood restaurants and Leo's Grandevous is no exception.  Since finding street parking can be a problem, we took a short cab ride from the hotel.  That worked out well.  Being a weekday night, the place was not very busy, but we had called for reservations anyway and we were placed at a seat by the front window.  It was great watching most of Hoboken parade by this corner restaurant.    As the locals filtered in, they all knew the wait and bar staff on a first name basis.  The staff knew them as well.  Boy, this place is as comfortable as your favorite sweater.  But we came for food as well as atmosphere.We were in no hurry and ordered drinks and antipasto to start.  I'm used to cute little California wine pours, so when my Straccali Chianti came filled to the brim of the glass, I knew that was going to like this throwback restaurant.  Then came the antipasto.  It could have been our meal, especially since it was accompanied by a basket of yummy bread.  What a great start!I ordered the night's special,  veal osso bucco.  Special indeed!  Tasty, tender and more than I could eat.  My wife had pasta and meatballs.  Big ass serving.  We tried to stuff a shared dessert down.  After another round of overfilled wine, that cab idea sure looked smart.  Nice neighborhood restaurant.  It probably looks the same as it did 30 years ago.  Good wholesome Italian food.  Friendly service.  Try it you'll like it.
2016-06-26,1,Maybe its because im a italian from brooklyn, but i didnt like the food at all.The atmosphere was old school / sinatra style, which was cool and the staff was nice and attentive, but as far as the food i did not get one bit of authenticity.Imo it was a regular restaurants take on italian food.
2016-05-31,1,The sauce is too sweet and the food is overrated. We ordered salads and there was no dressing.
2016-03-06,5,They have the best Alfredo sauce I've ever had! Fresh bread and a great atmosphere!! We'll definitely go back!
2016-01-31,2,VERY DISAPPOINTING on many levels....Last night was not the first time we have dined at Leo's, although it will certainly be the last time we return.After finishing an appointment in the neighborhood (approx 6:00pm-Saturday) my husband and I thought....Let's go to Leo's for an early, casual dinner. He ordered a draught beer, I ordered wine. The server returned soon thereafter to inform us that they did not have either of our selections available. We made new drink selections and ordered dinner - after having to ASK our server about any specials that were being offered. Once again, she returned to explain that they were sold out of my husband's dinner choice - veal and peppers. Really?! It was too early in the evening to have had a "run" on this dish....and the kitchen had NO veal?...NO peppers? They obviously did not care to be accommodating.... about anything. The paper napkins they use are flimsy, cheap-- not even of the quality that come with pizza or Chinese food delivery. And there should have been more wait staff working, as well. The food was OK - not outstanding, not even HOT by the time it arrived.Unfortunately, on numerous occasions we have found Leo's to be a mis-managed neighborhood place to eat; cannot really be considered a restaurant. You will be disappointed (and frustrated) if you are expecting a nice dining experience.
2016-01-30,4,If you want authentic Sinatra era Hoboken this place is for you. From the 70s decor to the sinatra photos you feel like your italian grandparents have cooked every dish for you.  The Italian is authentic and the simple dishes have been mastered for decades.  Be sure to bring cash.
2016-01-19,5,Wow... just a staple. Likely the best old school restaurant in Hoboken. No glitz no glitter. Just perfect bread, food, drinks and environment. Juke box is an added treat. Kathy was amazing. We miss you.
2015-12-20,3,We wanted a Hoboken restaurant with a connection to Frank Sinatra and a friend recommended Leo's. The food was good but one dish was painful. My friend ordered Fettuccini Alfredo and it game out with pieces of grilled chicken. That was strange but the worst part was that the chicken was inedible. It was flavorless and rubbery. I literally couldn't swallow the piece I sampled. Was it frozen and reheated? I don't even know. Waitress did bring us a fresh dish with no chicken!
2015-12-19,3,I've only had the pasta here and it is solid. Fun environment to eat dinner and staff is friendly. Haven't had delivery from here, so can't comment, but it's a top spot here because of the food.
2015-11-14,1,Just finished a meal from here. Once again, like so many places in town, the food tasted as if it had been frozen awhile-sausage was cardboardy, no seasoning; meatballs were only slightly better-they were a little fresher. The sauce was greasy and watery- again lacking in seasoning. All in all, for 12.95, it didn't even meet that low bar. Did give me a lot of decent bread and the delivery was fast. Pass on by this one if you're a serious Italian foodie.
2015-11-08,5,Mmmh mmmh mmmh! Love their food! Lobe their prices! Love their service! Only opem for a couple of hours a day, but worth it! Definitely recommended!
2015-11-07,5,Always great, quality food. FromThe caesar salad to the bar pies and every pasta I have tried to date has been delicious. Even the bread they bring you is fresh out of the oven. Laid back atmosphere makes this the perfect go to.
2015-10-30,2,It's pricey, $20 for a plate of pasta pricey.  My plate of pasta came with very little meat and I thought I was eating chef boyardee's for a super inflated price.  The waitresses were super nice and the atmosphere was authentic Italian.  As a while the experience was mediocre, there was nothing special about the bread or pasta.
2015-10-12,5,We had our daughter's baptism here on a Sunday afternoon and everything went perfectly.  I enjoyed working with Grace and Sergio while planning the party. Grace was so kind and attentive throughout.  She thought of every detail, including serving all of the kids a special pizza during the first course.  The staff was so patient with us and the kids and the restaurant was so accommodating.  The food was delicious and came out quickly.   Will be back and would highly recommend to everyone.
2015-09-19,5,Met friends for a casual dinner. This is old school Italian food at its best.  The service was really good. The food though is as good as it gets. We had their mussels as an appetizer along with one of the salads and garlic bread.  WOW!  The main courses were all terrific. We even had cannoli and tartufo for dessert.   All of left really happy.
2015-09-06,5,This year marks 19 years of living in Hoboken and dining at Leos. I love having it right down the block and taking a stroll down the street to get my delicious dinner fix. my off the boat from Sicily dad loves this place too. Their eggplant parm is my favorite and tastes like my Nonna's. mangia mangia!
2015-09-05,1,Had a strange but seriously concerning experience on my only visit to Leo's.  We are new to Hoboken and live close by so we stopped in late one night for a drink.  We sat at the bar and immediately met the owner who introduced himself as so.  He was the bartender at that time so we ordered a couple of beers.  We watched as he introduced himself to others at the bar as the owner and shook everyone's hand as he did so.  Within a few minutes someone ordered a mixed drink.  Instead of filling the glass with ice with a scoop he actually reached into the ice bin with his bare hand to fill the glass with ice.  This IS disgusting.  Needless to say we have never been back and intend to stay away.
2015-08-31,2,I've been going to Leo's for 10 years.  Recently it seems like there has been lot of new staff turnover and the place isn't the same anymore.  I've probably had 20 chicken parms over the years and the last 3 times the chicken has been terrible.  The first time the chicken wasn't fully cooked.  The last two time the chicken wasn't tender and tastes like it was frozen.  Not sure if they changed their supplier and got lower quality food or if there is a new chef in the back but something has definitely changed.  Was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt since it was so good for so long but 3 strikes and your out.
2015-08-29,5,Authentic Italian!!Leos has been a long-standing Hoboken establishment from the Sinatra days. The food is authentic and unapologetically Italian. If you're feeling hungry, Wednesday's is lasagna night - yumm! Besides the lasagna, I recommend ordering the mussels a diavlo and meatball bar pie. A MUST visit for any Hoboken resident in which it will undoubtedly become one of your new favorites!
2015-08-14,4,Very cozy family style restaurant. We had the shrimp fra diavolo and the shrimp with Brussels sprouts and pancetta. They were both very tasty meals with very generous portions. Shrimp was cooked wonderfully.
2015-08-11,1,It was nice of the manager to comment here but it didn't change the experience. The day of the reservation was the same day I left the review, July 1st at 9:30PM. I
2015-08-11,4,I love Leo's.  Classic staple Italian food in a no-nonsense setting.  Generous portions and large menu with Italian classics and some specials.  Not a super fancy joint by any means, but  quality and dependable food.  And the waitresses are Jerseylicious.
2015-08-08,5,At first I would of given this 3 stars because when I received my penne alla vodka it came a little dry and without chicken. It wasn't the restaurants fault as delivery.com failed to have a drop down option for the chicken so I just assumed that it came with it at the $15.50 price. I called and they were quick to bring me a whole new order with more sauce and added on the chicken for free. The guy on the phone was extremely nice and attentive to my feedback and was quick to offer me a new dish on the house. I will definitely be ordering again. Great food, better service . Thank you !
2015-07-22,5,I sat at the bar for a bite and asked for a 'classic' dish. Nik the bartender gave me the fantastic recommendation of vodka sauce pasta and side of meatballs. Absolutely delicious. Some reviews have called the restaurant dated, but in all honesty that's where the neighborhood charm comes from. It's a relaxing and fantastic place to eat.
2015-07-20,4,Just moved to hoboken and this is by far one of my favorite spots..food has been on point each time i have visited, and the personal service by Sergio is  fantasticEveryone is extremely friendly and the pesto chicken pasta is one of the best i've ever had. I will become a regular bar fly as i set up my roots in New Jersey.- x new york city food snob
2015-05-29,5,From reading other reviews, I get the feeling a lot of the negative comments are from people who don't know real Italian food or just can't handle New York Metro attitude. Leo's is an institution and the best of its kind outside the Bronx. I used to live in Hoboken and my family still occasionally meets out there for dinner despite geographic inconvenience. It's great, not overpriced, and no one I've gone with has ever been disappointed. We love this place through-and-through. It is a member of a dying breed of delicious, independently-owned Italian places that don't solely exist as a tourist trap. Definitely check it out. Leo's beats Carmine's.
2015-05-16,4,When I first heard of Leo's Grandevous, I was intrigued once I learned of its history.  Opened in 1939 by Leo and Tessie DiTerlizzi, it was a favorite of Frank Sinatra's.  Whenever he was in the area, he would always pay a visit, usually after hours as he enjoyed not only the food but the company of Leo and Tessie.  Here is an article that talks about all this:  nj.com/sinatra/ledger/in...We were visiting our daughter and her family for Mother's Day and decided that we would try to have dinner here.  They don't take reservations but we took our chances and showed up around 5:30 p.m.  The place was busy but they were able to put together some tables so that there was room for the 7 of us.Looking around at the customers, it was clear to see that most were older folks which I suspect were part of the BNR (born and raised) Hobokenites.  It also appeared that much of the staff was also.We found service to be friendly and efficient.  For starters, we decided to get a large antipasto to share.  This dish is attractively presented and consisted of black and green olives, salami, iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, hot peppers, shrimp, roasted red peppers and wedges of cheese.  We liked most of it, except the cheese.  Most antipastos have mozzarella in them but here the cheese was, apparently, romano which didn't go well with the other items.  In fact, most of us didn't like the cheese with the exception being one of the grandsons.  In fact, when his brothers discovered that he liked the cheese, they gave him their portions LOL!One of the specials of the day was filet mignon served with mashed potatoes with gorgonzola cheese.  Our son-in-law wanted this until our daughter guilted him out of it by telling him that we were in an Italian restaurant that was well-known and he should get Italian food.  So, like me, he ordered chicken parmigiana with angel hair pasta.  I had heard that Leo's red sauce was on the sweet side but that wasn't the case.  It had good flavor and wasn't at all sweet.  The portion was huge---2 chicken cutlets (one would have been fine!)  You are given a choice of sides and I chose angel hair pasta, as did my son-in-law.  I think that the pasta was from a box as it didn't have that homemade flavor.  The cutlets were breaded and thin plus the amount of mozzarella on them was generous.  We both enjoyed our meals.They don't have a kids menu here so I told our daughter to ask if they would do a half-portion.  It turned out that they indeed do offer that option.  So the 3 kids got cheese stuffed tortellini with red sauce.  All of them just about inhaled their food---they liked it that much!Our daughter got the eggplant parmigiana with a side of pasta (I forget which kind).  She raved about her eggplant saying that it was the best she ever had.  In fact, she told me that she can't wait to go back for more!  I tasted some and I agree that it was well prepared and flavorful.My husband got sweet Italian sausage with penne and red sauce.  The sausage was nicely flavored with fennel.  He enjoyed every bite!For drinks, my husband and our daughter each had a Peroni beer.  I had wanted some ginger ale but they were all out.  So my son-in-law and I had Pepsi.  Our server brought us a pitcher to share.  The kids had water.We all left feeling quite full!  The kitchen was on the slow side but I think it had to do with their being busy.  We didn't mind as we were in no rush plus the wait wasn't so long that we felt annoyed.  Prices are very reasonable as all our entrees cost less than $20 each.  The large antipasto was $9.50.If you are in Hoboken, I recommend a visit here, if for no other reason than the history.  There are lots of Sinatra photos on the walls and the jukebox is filled with Sinatra music.  It's an easy walk from the train station---find your way to 2nd Street and it's right on the corner of 2nd and Grand.
2015-05-14,4,Went back for a second time and the bartender was very friendly. The food was pretty good too. Would come back for a bar pie and a drink or two.
2015-05-14,2,I have heard good things about this place from friends. Got it delivered tonight. Got the rigatoni bolognese. They apologized on the package that it was penne, not rigatoni, which I did not care about. But while eating I bit into something gritty and hard. It was a piece of glass. This I am not ok with. I hope the chef and his kitchen staff use safe and careful food prep in the future. I will be giving it a second shot at some point because I believe in second chances. It just sucks that my first experience here was not great.
2015-05-12,3,Well, this is an institution. Good 'ol hearty Italian food. Very saucy, lots of rich pasta dishes. Sinatra playing loudly in the background. The food is okay, but I didn't find it that impressive.
2015-05-08,5,Their food..is...delicious!! The service is great and my fav dish hands down has to the Penne Vodka! it is absolutely mouth watering!
2015-04-04,5,Don't understand the other reviews.  This place is always spot on when I go.  Service has always been great, food has always been superb, and the ambiance takes you back to the times Sinatra roamed the place.
2015-03-03,1,I have fond memories of my first and subsequent visits to Leo's. The food was nothing short of a portal back to my childhood in Brooklyn eating good old fashioned Italian staples bathed in a great red gravy. More recently though my visit was a major disapointment. The bufala mozzarella and tomato lacked the basic oil and vinegar you would expect and was room temperature.That was followed up by mussels in red sauce. For reasons I can't understand they are cooked and served on a half shell. This of course leads to the dry rubbery items I found before me.Having ordered the veal parm I expected good things to come despite the two previous courses. Instead I received some water logged pasta and veal so thickly coated in egg that it tasted more like an omelette than anything else.Once upon a time Leo's was a great place for Italian comfort foods. Nowadays it seems they rely on the fact that Sinatra once ate there and have little concern for what they put on a patrons plate.
2015-02-16,2,I don't get the hype about this place at all.  I've tried it twice and twice have left disappointed. Not a good spot, not a place for a date and not good in general.  I feel as if they litterally stole my money.
2015-02-05,2,I just got back from having dinner at Leo's, and I have to say both my partner and I were very disappointed. It's a shame, because we were both in the mood for Italian, and I have been wanting to give this place a try ever since I heard Sinatra was a frequent visitor, but it's clear this place is riding on it's name only. I rarely write restaurant reviews, but this place definitely needs a wake-up call. About the food: For appetizers, we had the warm prosciutto and fresh mozzarella and Leo's "Famous" Mussels (in garlic and wine sauce). The first was two slices of meat and two tiny pieces of mutz over a generic salad. It tasted ok, but the portion was a joke for $11. I mean, are you kidding me for that price? I'm still shaking my head. It was all salad, barely any prosciutto or mutz. The mussels were on the half shell (very odd choice) over a very watery, bland sauce. The real kicker is the mussels were clearly pre-frozen or cooked earlier and reheated (my money is pre-frozen). I know mussels very well and cook them regularly at home. These were fishy tasting, and had an almost pasty texture... no resemblance to fresh mussels. Honestly, they were some of the worst I've ever had, and my partner agreed. We ate a few and stopped, and I'm now hoping they're not going to make me sick. For entrees, we both had veal parmesan, and while it wasn't nearly as bad as the appetizers, it was very mediocre and unseasoned. All I tasted was the tomato sauce that the veal was drowning in. Not worth the money. We both wanted to get a veggie of some sort instead of pasta as a side dish, and that was a $3.00 upcharge - each. We got broccoli rabe and spinach. Honestly, those two simple, sauteed greens with garlic dishes were the best thing we ate during the whole meal.Other negatives: When we sat down our table was dirty, and the floor was very dirty. Positives: The restaurant has some great old school charm, and I am a sucker for that kind of vibe. I love restaurants that have been around doing the same thing forever. Also, the service was quite good-- the young waitress we had did a nice job and we didn't wait long for anything. To sum up, I'd never go back. There are too many other (better) choices in this town. For $85 for two people, without any alcohol or dessert, we expected much more... or at least an average meal. You get (very weak) pizza-joint level food at Italian bistro prices. My advice to whoever manages this place: Get a new chef who can do justice to classic Italian food, clean the place up a bit, get some real napkins and silverware, and you'd have a real gem on your hands. As it stands right now, it's a pretty bad dining experience.
2015-02-05,2,I don't get why anyone calls this "the best" or even "good".1) It's dirty. Very dirty. The entryway is dirty and this should've been my tipoff (dust and dirt all over the walls). The table itself had crusty food still on it (how hard is it to wipe down a glass topped table?)2) "Leo's Famous Mussels". Leo is rolling over in his grave. So is Sinatra. These were clearly frozen mussels in a watery garlic sauce. No flavor, gross texture. Why use frozen mussels? 2.5) "Warm prosciutto and mozzarella". $11. Less than 1oz of either prosciutto or mozzarella over a majorly overdressed salad. Their cost? $.253) Veal Parm. Not bad. Might've been pre-frozen (kind of tough), but when you bury it in a salty enough tomato sauce it's hard to tell where any flavor is coming from. The only bright spot was the broccoli rabe and spinach, both of which were a $3 up-charge on an already overpriced dish.Total bill was $84 after tip (the service was good), which is insane given no alcohol. I would never return given the other options in Hoboken.
2015-01-30,4,Best home style Italian Anerican pasta in Hoboken served in a very quaint and cozy environment. Walls strung with photos of Sinatra and hearts. Service could not be better! (Thanks Ben, still surprised you are not a singer). My husband got the warm appetizer, an array of mussels, stuffed clams, mozzarella sticks, all very good.  I got the short rib pasta special and oh was it delicious and a very generous portion of ribs with meat falling off the bone so tender. It was memorable!  The Pinot was very good too. Finally the bread basket (did I espy Dom's bread) was as good as it gets esp when dipped in the chilli infused high quality house olive oil. I would have bought that olive oil were it on sale.
2015-01-11,4,I went here for a date last night (1/10/15). I was able to get a table for 2 around 8pm without reservations, despite Leo's having a pretty good crowd. Service was excellent- all staff I encountered were notably friendly and helpful. My meal was good, could have been excellent if I had asked the pasta to be prepared al dente- it was a little overcooked for my taste- but the bolognese sauce was terrific. We stayed for coffee and dessert, and enjoyed a nice conversation without feeling rushed out. I'll be back here again.
2015-01-08,1,We just left Leo's  and the service was poor.  We sat and waited for their signature mussels for an hour.  When the mussels marinara came they seemed cold and the sauce looked more like tomato juice.  They were small and nothing special at all. Our entrees came within minutes.   We were starving at 9:15 on a Monday and there were 3 servers in a small place!  Our entries were tasty but a bit salty.   They came with pasta or fries, salads were extra and overpriced.   We will not return and were extremely disappointed .
2015-01-04,5,Great home cooked pasta dishes as well as a fun evening with family or friends!  The juke box and Sinatra memorabilia are amazing!
2014-12-27,2,Frankly this was extremely disappointing - after hearing great reviews both on Yelp and from some family friends I was excited to try it out. The Good - Bar pizza was interesting and different/enjoyable for bar pizza (got a goat cheese/salad pizza).I ordered a meatball parm sandwich and Alfredo pasta - two Italian dishes that should be simple to get right and that any Italian place should pride themselves on - the meatball was bland and tasted like there were no spices used. The Alfredo tasted like a mix of jar sauce cut with water - terrible. Will likely not go back - if only to grab a wine and bar pie at the bar.
2014-12-12,2,The place is nice and the staff were attentive, but the food is lacking.I went with three people and nothing anyone had was great.
2014-12-06,5,Leo's is a Hoboken Institution where you feel like you are visiting friends and family each time you go. The food is delicious. The specials can be out of this world. Try the fish specials or the braised short ribs over rigatoni if they have it cause it's just sooooooooo good. Sergio and Nick take terrific care of you and the waitstaff is the best.
2014-11-27,4,Great food, great atmosphere, great service.  Very reasonable prices.  Great spot in Hoboken.
2014-11-24,5,Without question, this is the best Italian restaurant in Hoboken! And that's saying a lot! Linda, Betty and the whole crew could not be any nicer!
2014-11-22,4,Good food, sometimes if ur not w regular service could be improved... Fortunately I'm a regular so good food and friendly service for me!
2014-11-11,5,The best thin crust pizza and pasta Diavolo we've ever had. Our server was Ben and he explained the menu and made suggestions based on his favorites and both were superb. We like the menu options, the homemade rustic warm bread, and the service. This was truly one of the best meals we had in 11 days on the East coast. Not too expensive and great flavor.
2014-11-11,4,Pretty good italian restaurant in Hoboken. The food is delicious and the wait staff is very friendly. I ate the veal marsala and the sauce was a little too thick for my liking but everything else was delicious. It is cash only so be prepared for that!
2014-11-10,1,We went here based on some recommendations we read. We were seated way in the back next to the kitchen door and experienced all of the traffic in and out of the kitchen. Our food arrived in a decent amount of time and was not that bad, What was terrible was the waitress. She gave us a bill and most items were much higher than was on the menu. When we pointed out these mistakes, she said I will fix them. She then took off $1 for a $3 over charge on one item. $2 for $2.50 over charge. We spotted another over charge and she said she would total it again and took my credit card. She came back minus the itemized bill and said all was fine. Later, we discover that we were charged $18 too much. I do not know if this was something dishonest or a completely incompetent waitress, but the result was the same. I would recommend avoiding this place since there are so many other good Italian restaurants in Hoboken. This was my first and last time eating here.
2014-10-22,3,I heard a lot of fan fare about this place. I visited a few months ago and was a little disappointed. The service was good, the bartender was nice and they were accommodating to us despite the lack of a reservation. So on service I would give 5 stars no problem.The food was the issue. I had chicken parm, it was definitely over salted and the sauce was overwhelming. I felt like it was drowning in it. We had salads to start, they were fine. Nothing to talk about really. I wouldn't come back unless it was to grab a. Drink at the bar before dinner.
2014-09-28,4,4 stars only because of Ben, our waiter. The food was taking a long time & he kept coming out & apologizing, making sure we were ok, Etc. He was great - definitely an asset to the restaurant! I wish the food could have been a bit better. We had the hot antipasto ; the eggplant rollatini was excellent, I loved the sauce, but the mussels were tiny & clams oreganata  hardly had any taste to them at all.  Did I mention Ben was great?  I'll go back next time I'm  In town to try again. Thanks for a helping make such a not so great night so much more pleasant for us, Ben!
2014-09-16,4,Very nice Italian Restaurant, If you a Frank Sinatra Fan you are going to love it here. There tons of his pics all over the restaurant and they play his music in the background, the ambiance is quiet and romantic. I skipped the appetizers and jumped right into dinner. I had the Sinatra Shrimp Dish. It was delish! Will def come back soon!!!
2014-09-13,3,Leo's barely deserves 3 stars. We went last night and it was pretty disappointing. We ordered the antipasto, mozzarella pizza, and rigatoni bolognese. The antipasto and pizza were ridiculously bad. Although the pizza was only $3.75, I'm pretty sure it was a frozen pizza that they just heated up. The antipasto had a few pieces of salami and a random shrimp- gross. I did, however, like the rigatoni bolognese. They were even nice enough to split it onto 2 plates for us. That was really the only thing the place had going for it. Also, not a byob. I would def skip this place.
2014-09-08,4,Best Italian restaurant in Hoboken. Authentic, cooked with love like your grandma food. I will say that the servers are a different story. They don't seem to care if you are there or not. I've come to think of it as part of the charm of the place! Know this going in and you'll have a great experience. It's cash only. In case you're out, they have an ATM in the restaurant!
2014-09-06,1,Serious this is not good Italian food.. As in other posts the tomatoe sauce is horrible.. How do they let this garbage come out of the kitchen.. Really the owner needs to change the food.. Everything poor quality and is tasteless.. Even the bread.. I do not think the chef is Italian .. Worse Italian food I have ever had ..I am not going to waste my time telling you all about what I had and how horrible it all was.. Just want to let owner know you need a new chef. And he or she should have knowledge of Italian cooking if you are an Italian restaurant..
2014-09-06,1,Honestly the worst dining experience I've ever had. Over priced. Terrible terrible service. Waitress served us half used pitchers of water and didn't take drink orders and forgot an entire entree. Do not ever go here. Food was below average as well. I can't stress how bad this restaurant is.
2014-08-26,4,Excellent dinner of shrimp fra diavolo and the monk fish special.  Tasty.    Bread is always warm and crisp.
2014-08-18,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The service is great and the food is phenomenal. It tastes like my mothers home cooking! I love the jukebox with all the Sinatra. Always feel like your family / a regular by the staff.
2014-08-07,3,Solid food, decent prices, but hit or miss wait staff. Some of them are really attentive and polite, while some of the ladies make you feel like you're bothering them the entire time, and will rarely come check on you. I guess if they never come to be table then anytime you actually need something, it does feel like you're bothering them. Stick with take out. Cash only, but there is an ATM at the front.
2014-08-03,1,Overall bad food, bad decor, bad service. Not sure what the hype is about this place but it is just bad. How about ordering a chicken parm and it comes battered in a franchese egg batter opposed to bread crumbs. It was also 2 inches thick!  Really?  That's a first. And they sell their own sauce in a jar if you like watery marinara sauce. I think Ragu does it better.
2014-07-25,1,Heard great things about this place and was thoroughly disappointed this past Wednesday night. My boyfriend and I went with his parents and uncle and I was actually embarrassed to have brought them here. His mothers pizza came out 10 mins after the rest of the food and looked like it came out of the microwave. The shrimp fra diavola was soggy and the chicken was just okay. The service was even worse than the food. Needless to say we won't be going back any time soon.
2014-07-13,4,The atmosphere is quite old school and a bit boring, but the food speaks for itself. Amazing pasta dishes from the mussels to linguine and meatballs. Even the bread is delicious. They also had a special edition Italian beer that was quite good and went well with the food. The fra diavolo sauce on the mussels was delicious and good and spicy. They even made a special sauce for our pasta which was delectable. Great place that makes you feel at home and far off the beaten, touristy path of the rest of Hoboken.
2014-06-28,3,Food was good.  Wait staff was better.  Our server and the other servers seemed sincerely interested in making sure we were having a good time and enjoying our food.  It made us feel welcome.Oddly, someone was playing a lot of Fleetwood Mac on the jukebox when we were there.  I'm a Fleetwood Mac fan, but it just seemed out of place with all the Sinatra memorabilia on the wall.  It feels like there should be nothing but Francis Albert playing in there...
2014-06-15,2,Leo's is a big place, good for a group, and loud kids. The staff is friendly. Recently attended for a birthday and we were all pretty disappointed in our food. I will start off with the mussels. The menu states that they are known for them. It literally tasted like they dumped a bottle of Ragu over steamed mussels. I wouldn't even do that at home. A signature dish should be a show stopper. Next, I got the linguini with white clam sauce. Another mistake. First of all, they make it with canned, chopped clams. They added three clams in shells to the top (along with their broken shell bits in my pasta, seriously?!). The broth was terrible. It tasted very strongly of butter and that's not the way the sauce should taste (white wine and garlic). Stick with the bar pies.
2014-06-05,3,A bunch of coworkers and I came here for a classic Hoboken meal and we had a really great time.Decor: I would classify the decor as more bar than Italian restaurant, cut that is not a bad thing. There are tables in the front, aka the best seats in the house, and a bunch more in the back. The bar, though, is the nicest part as it is big and very inviting. Every wall is also a shire to both Jersey, Hoboken, and Sinatra - should come as no surprise to anyone. It is also a bit off the beaten path, being deep western Hoboken.Bathroom: It's a bit small and cozy but it gets the job done. It isn't filthy but I also wouldn't eat off the floor.Staff: The bartender was fast and pretty friendly, although he seemed to want to keep it strictly business. Our waitress, however, was awesome.  We were a group of 7 guys and she was quick with the uptake on jokes and wasn't afraid to banter back and forth with us.Food/Drink: They have a full bar and cold beer, no complaints. The food is hit or miss, however. I have been here in the past and had a pretty good meal but this time was certainly different.  We started off with some mussels (I didn't have any, but the others raved about them) and a few bar pies (really, really good!) and moved to the main courses: I had the Chicken Francese (sub-par at best) and the others had an assortment of things (which they all claimed were good). I guess I just ordered the wrong thing and I wouldn't hold it against anyone but myself.Value: The prices are very reasonable for the portion sizes, food quality and location.While I did not particularly enjoy what I ordered I definitely had a great time. It could have been the company I was with but, remove my meal, everything was good. I'd come back again, but not before trying a handful of other Italian places.
2014-05-28,5,Leo's is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken.  The food is that good, old fashioned Italian food.   The service is friendly and fast.  I love to take family and out-of-towners here because there is quite a large menu to make everyone happy.  They even offer gluten free pasta as an option!   I love any shrimp & pasta dish and the baked ziti, while my husband loves the chicken parm.  If you dine here, you must order the cannolis as dessert.  Best cannolis ever!  Even if I am too stuffed for dessert, I will ask to take a cannoli to go.  If you are looking for a restaurant that is not on Washington street, where its mostly locals, definitely try Leo's!
2014-05-17,3,I wanted to find a cute, atmospheric, and reasonably priced good Italian restaurant for dinner. I Yelped the place before coming and thought it sounded pretty good. However when I got there I was a little disappointed. I order the garlic wine mussels and the hot antipasta and although I consumed the whole thing, it wasn't amazing. I thought the muscles were a little dingy, and the wine garlic sauce could have been done better. It should have been served in a deeper dish so that the mussels can simmer in it's flavor. The hot antipasta was good, ha mussels, bakes clams (that was a bit too baked), shells, mussels, and shrimps (they were pretty good). My boyfriend got the spinach ravioli and told me that it tasted like it looks--drenched in Alfredo sauce. My aunt got the chicken Marsala. They did an I interesting spin on it and made it sweet. I thought it was tasty but I can see how the sweetness can get to you at the end. Overall nice staff, decent prices, fun decor with pictures of frank Sinatra all over the place and a cool bar in the middle. Food ....mediocre Italian.
2014-05-15,5,Went to Leo's for the first time last night and was very impressed.  The atmosphere is beautiful and Linda was friendly and welcoming.  Great wine, great people - will be back... a lot!
2014-04-29,3,I came here once for my roommate's father's birthday dinner. Everyone seemed really happy about the food and the ambiance, and I have to admit I had a fun time at the dinner, mostly because they were very accomodating to our large group (about 10 people). The only reason for the 3 stars is that I am not a huge "red sauce" italian food fan, but the food was decent for what it was.Pictures on the wall of Sinatra were very cool. All-in-all, a place to go if you like Italian food. Or Sinatra. Or wine.
2014-04-26,5,This place was recommended to us and we were so pleased.  We are in town for a wedding, not familiar with this city.  The food was plentiful and delicious!  We had Kathy as a server, it seemed like half the restaurant did!  Lol she was focused and friendly!  Thanks Kathy, wonderful evening at Leo's.  And your entree suggestion, it was wonderful.
2014-04-19,1,Just awful! I had the Hot antipasto. One of the worst plates of food ever set in front of me. Clearly prefab, old mussels, tiny tasteless baked clams, awful mozz sticks that clearly came from the supermarket. A Good Friday meal that was anything but good. I've been here before and it wasn't bad but my last visit to Leo's will be my last ever. It was that bad and not cheap since it was the quality of hospital cafeteria food.
2014-04-16,4,Food is delicious.   Baby spinach salad is terrific. Portions are good for the price. Decor is a throwback and homage to old school Hoboken which is great particularly the bar.  If you have anyone from out of town visiting this should be near the top of the list to visit.
2014-04-15,4,Love Leo's!!!  The servers are extremely nice and accommodating.  The food has generous portions and  is awesome.  It is definitely well priced for the portion size and quality!  So many carbs!  Bring it!
2014-04-03,5,If you're looking for "Old Hoboken Italian Eating", this is the place. The food was terrific and the service outstanding. We had it all - pasta, meat, fish - the four of us enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The wine selection was an added pleasant  surprise. We drank 2 bottles of Amarone.The oval formica bar is classic and could be declared a city landmark. Go there as soon as you can!!!
2014-03-26,5,What can I say, Leo's, I love you! The red sauce is sweet and bold. The prices are unbeatable and the bar pies will blow your mind. Try a couple different pies to start off your meal. They are small and tasty. The service could use a smile here and there, but I come for the food!
2014-03-21,4,Came here for the Gluten free options. There was pizza and cheese ravioli. Despite the limited pasta choices they said you could pick any sauce on the menu, same for the toppings for the pizza.The one downfall as far gluten free is that the waitress  didn't really know what was 100% gluten free, we appreciated the honesty thoWe went with the ravioli with meat sauce which was AWESOME.On the pizza we got Italian sausage and smoked mozzarella. It was pretty good as well but could have been more crunchy in our opinion but we are picky pizza eaters.Overall good and nice for a decent price.
2014-02-19,1,Really Hoboken?  This place was AWFUL!!!! If you like good north jersey Italian food do yourself a favor and don't go here!! This is Italian good you would get in the Midwest. I don't understand the reviews below. I even went there after happy hour- when everything tastes good- and couldn't eat my food. It was that bad. I would not trust one persons review that thought this place was good.
2014-02-14,1,Sitting here waiting 2 hours and 15 minutes for my order now. Njwaiters (delivery service) won't tell me where the food is. Says they'll call back but they don't. I try and they don't pick up the phone. Call restaurant. First employee tells me it went out "a looong time ago." 5 minutes later, new person. "Oh it went out 15 minutes ago." No one cares, I already paid, still no food. Don't ever, ever order delivery from these guys.  Your food will never arrive and nobody will take responsibility for it. Money down the drain.Update: driver showed up, said she was pulled over by a cop. I guess for an hour? Anyway, resolved. Still not happy though.
2014-02-12,3,We've dined here a few times and it's generally pretty good.Very much old school family type of restaurant...somewhat chaotic too.This is not a quiet dining experience- it's lively.We've sat at the bar and had pizza & wine...pizza was pretty good.We've had groups of 10 people and had a solid time.Generally speaking, the food is old school Italian.  Sauces are good, the meatballs were OK, pasta dishes were good.Not outstanding and not subpar, hence the 3 star rating.You'll have fun here.
2014-02-05,4,When I lived in Hoboken I always passed by this place but never checked it out until last night. They have a full bar in the front and plenty of seating in the back room. The place does have a cozy and homey feel that most reviewers mention. The glasses of wine were priced at $8. They have plenty of options if you want a bottle. I had the Penne alla Vodka with chicken which came out to $19.50. It was a good portion size for the price and it was absolutely delicious. I wish it had more chicken of course. Our server was Kathy who was super attentive, friendly, and funny. At one point I wanted her to sit down with us for dinner. She made us feel at home. This is a great Italian restaurant that I plan on returning to, for sure!
2014-02-04,5,Leo's has been and will always be my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. There is not one negative aspect about this place. From the decor, staff, food, and overall mood everything is marvelous. What sets Leo's apart from the other Italian restaurants in Hoboken is that it has stayed true to their roots. The decor is true "old Hoboken" as some may call it. Frank Sinatra photos hang all around the restaurant, and you'll catch some of your local citizens who have been in town for years dining at Leo's. As for the food. Delicious is all I have to say. I have had their penne aka vodka, baked ziti, chicken parm, and seafood. All of the dishes are superb! Perfect portion size, temperature is always warm, and the ingredients taste authentic and fresh. The bar pie is a must have appetizer or even addition to your meal. If you are looking for a nice family feeling restaurant in Hoboken go to Leo's and ask for Cathy! She has been the waitress there for over 26 years and has been doing a fantastic job.
2014-01-26,4,Wonderful! Will definitely return. Had the Shrimp Sinatra, excellent dish. Would only have liked to have been able to hear the wonderful music at the tables in the bar area where we were seated, but overall very enjoyable!!
2014-01-20,4,Decent Italian food
2014-01-16,4,This place was just MARVELOUS!! What a gem in this neighborhood. Everything they served us was just as you would imagine it should taste.  The deserts we had ( I had the tiramisu) were marvelous. I am not listing everything we had because there were 5 people and we got 5 different things and EVERYTHING was superb and not one complaint. All finished plates and no to-go's! If I am in the area again, I will make sure to stop here. The service/servers were all so wonderful and attentive.Why the missing star? They don't take credit cards!! Its 2014!! People have been to the moon!! Suck it up and take credit cards! I guarantee your profits will go up because people will order more food! I know we were all wondering if we would have enough cash to cover everything. Get a credit card machine already and get the ATM out of there, it trashes up the place!
2014-01-15,4,This should technically be a two part review. I came here for my company team luncheon and ordered the veal, which turned out to be a sad meal. The bar pies were pretty good, but not good enough for me to come here just for that. I came here again last weekend and ordered off the menu. I had the chef prepare a broccoli rabe and sausage with pasta in white sauce and that definitely nailed itself a 4 star. My previous boss had introduced me to it and I'm a fan now. Although his wife's version is still much more delicious. I need an invite myself to his house for dinner :)
2014-01-14,5,Hoboken, NJ was the first place I moved to when I graduated from High School. So feeling nostalgic when friends wanted to go to lunch, I said let's go to Hoboken for good italian food. I had never been to Leo's but googled it and the menu looked good. And it was! Located on the corner of 2nd Street and Grand Street the food was authntic, service easy going and inviting.  The bread was great served warm with olive oil or butter. I ordered the Mussles in white wine and Garlic and Linquini with tomatoe sauce.  I was not disappointed. I would have had desert but I was too full. Next time. If you want to feel like you are in Italy go here! And NJ still has the best Italian places, you DO NOT HAVE TO GO INTO NYC for a great meal and great time.
2013-12-26,2,Came here with a few coworkers for lunch.  Not impressed by the food or atmosphere.  It does have a very "homey" and comfortable touch to the place but ultimately I came for the food.  We started with the pizza which was ok.  For an entree i had the pene vodka and it was ok along with the eggplant parm.. very mediocre. The service was not the best.. waiting 20 minutes for pizza, 30 minutes for entree.. it was a project.
2013-11-12,5,I've only dined in once and the service was fine. The food, however, is excellent. Anything with meatballs, the penne vodka, and the chicken parm (and I'm sure everything else, but those are what I normally stick to) are top notch
2013-11-11,5,We love Leo's!!! The food is basic old school Italian and absolutely delicious. We always get a bottle of wine, a Caesar salad, and a (free if you like them on Fb) order of mussels in white wine and garlic. Wednesday night is lasagna night which my hubby loves. Nightly specials are always tasty too. The servers are unique - friendly but in an old school Hoboken way which we love. We live only a few blocks away which is good for our taste buds but bad for our waistlines! The new ricotta cheesecake is outstanding. And, btw, they ACCEPT credit cards now!!!
2013-10-19,5,We went tonight and as usual, the food was fantastic. I ordered chicken stuffed with prosciutto and asiago in a Madera sauce off their special's menu. My dh ordered the scungilli fra Diablo and mussels. Their mussels are the best value and very tastee.  We also had dessert, not usual for us. The tiramisu was ok but the cannoli was good. However, I know I wouldn't get it again. Since we had not planned on going there, we were a little short on cash. When the bill came my dh told the waiter he was going to the Atm up front. Guess what.... It wasn't necessary. LEOS NOW ACCEPTS CREDIT CARDS!!!!!
2013-10-05,5,This is as good as it gets when it comes to italian food in Hoboken. As old school as it gets and still going strong.
2013-09-28,3,A solid place for feel-good, comfort Italian food. I went there last night (09/27) with my boyfriend for dinner, and although the service was a bit spotty in the beginning, it improved as the meal progressed. I ordered the baked ziti with ricotta and mozzarella, and my bf ordered the veal Parmesan. We both had a glass of wine with our meals--Chianti for me, Chardonnay for him. I really enjoyed the consistency of the pasta with the baked/melted cheese, but my boyfriend wasn't thrilled with his veal, claiming it had a "overly-fried" texture. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful (when my bf tried to pay with his Citi card, she subtly whispered to him that Leo's is cash-only, rather than loudly announce it to the whole restaurant, which I thought was rather considerate). The only issues I had with the overall service were that we had to ask for water twice, and one busboy kept passing our table without bothering to refill our water glasses. The place got a bit noisy towards the end of our meal, but that's to be expected from a local Italian eatery. We'll be back.
2013-09-11,5,Continuous Frank Sinatra in the background, local crowd, simple but tasty menu, authentic decor, and decent prices make this the best Italian in Hoboken. Stay away from that faux-nouveau Italian crap that takes up many spaces on Washington.
2013-08-16,2,Although the reviews speak highly of this place, the food was mediocre at best. Both dishes, baked shells with cheese and chicken picatta were extremely bland. We tried salt, Parmesan cheese, pepper but still nothing. The meal was sadly disappointing.
2013-08-07,5,This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.  The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is friendly.  They have an awesome jukebox too!  I've been going to Leo's for over 5 years and it never gets old.
2013-07-16,4,Leo's is a favorite.  They have great red-sauce Italian food, a fun jukebox, mean martinis and a staff that makes you feel at home. Fancy it isn't, but get over yourself and enjoy why you are there - for old-school, quality time with friends or family.  There are some reviews referring to servers as rude or scary.  I don't understand why these reviewers would be so rude.  The staff at Leo's, including the sisters Kathy and Linda, are dedicated to making your night easy - they'll make recommendations based on what you want, and remember you when you return.  Big difference between new-school polished and old-school real.  Remember where you are and you'll love every minute here.  We do.
2013-07-15,5,great food, reasonable prices and a family-like wait staff (the wait staff and patrons seem chummy with one another as if they all grew up together asking how each other's family members were and all - I mean it is Hoboken, and the Hoboken community is tight, so who knows, they might have all grown up together!) i'm such a fan of the food (i usually get the pasta dishes) that i even go out of my way to buy their jarred sauces to make at home when i'm entertaining company...I'm not from Hoboken, so it's quite a trek for me.  Sauces are always quality ingredients and fresh tasting!
2013-07-03,4,Good food, good prices, friendly staff.  Leo's is a nice mix of atmosphere with family style casual in their backroom seating, and more intimate seating in the bar area.  However, it wouldn't be an Italian place without some TVs with the soccer game on!My cousin and I didn't feel like cooking our own Sunday dinner so we decided to go check out Leo's.  We ordered some pasta dishes and split a bottle of wine.  Their marinara sauce had a ton of garlic, so if that's not your think, order something else!  The bolognese was very tasty.For the super healthy eaters, their menu had plenty of dishes that weren't straight pasta.  Also, their bar pies looked really good too, and I definitely plan on making it back to try one of those!
2013-05-14,5,My boyfriend and I have ate here on a few occasions - some take out, some dine in. We have never been dissappointed! The food is delicious and comforting, as we both come from big Italian families. Also, you can not beat the prices here, especially for the quality (note: they only accept cash).We dined outside one day with our large dog and our waitress (an older woman) was warm, kind, and attentive - even to our dog! We left feeling very satisfied with our meal and the service and appreciation we received.We will be back!
2013-04-06,3,I had been looking forward to this place for a couple of months and when my gf and i finally got there, it was a bit of an anti-climax. The food was good, but we have way better boot food in L.A. I guess it being in NJ, I'd had high expectations of it. We went there because we're fans of Sinatra and live and die for Italian cuisine but the service was minimal for a restaurant setting. I guess non-Italians from out of state just don't get the same level of customer service locals would. Meh.
2013-03-24,1,STAY AWAY FROM SCARY KATHY! She is a miserable server who has no class, no hospitality skills and is down right mean. I feel sorry for her. She must be a sad person. She was so rude to us on 2 different occasions. She was also argumentative in front of the owner, Sergio, who has no clue and did nothing to appease the situation. His response was, Sorry, she is Old Hoboken and has been with us for 25 years. He is clearly scared of her and I get it. She is scary. The food is great and most of the other staff is friendly. Too bad that Kathy will prevent us from ever going again. TERRIBLE SERVICE. She definitely has a chip on her shoulder for no reason. Very disgusting. We will be sure to let all of our Hoboken friends know to stay away as well. STAY AWAY!
2013-03-18,2,Possibly would have given it three stars if not for the terrible service. I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome walking into a restaurant. We came in as a party of 4, and two waitresses just looked at us. We asked if we could sit at an empty table in the window and were told we could after they had a conversation about it. The bread was very good, other than that, meh. Clams and mussels were ordered for the table which were just ok. I had a Leo's salad which was basically iceberg lettuce, topped with a julienne of salami and a small dice of provolone. Three of us ordered pizzas, they're bar sized, also just ok. The fourth in our party had a scungilli salad which was obviously canned scungilli over lettuce.
2013-03-11,5,Jeeezus H. Christ of Latter Day Saints, this food is good!!Best Italian food I've EVER had in my entire life. Went on a Saturday night around 10:00pm. Had the usual headache of finding parking in Hoboken, but once that was settled my fiancee and I trekked down to 2nd St & Grand. The restaurant itself is a pretty comfortable mom & pop style place. The place is an ode to all things Frank Sinatra. Hundreds of photos and portraits of Sinatra line the walls all around the restaurant and they play a never-ending stream of his hits playing through the speakers. It's actually quite pleasurable.We bypassed the bar  and went towards the dining area. We did not see anyone at the door so quickly realized we could sit where ever we wanted (after confirmation from one of the passing servers). The place was about half filled since it was later in the evening (they closed at 11 on Sat.) so it was easy to find a table and it wasn't too loud. Our server was nice and down to earth and checked on us frequently enough so that we didn't feel ignored and was careful not to be annoying and hover. Him and the rest of the servers are super helpful and seem to care that their guests get everything they want.The menu is pretty extensive, offering loads of traditional italian dishes. We ordered the Warm Prosciutto & Mozzarella & Mussels in Garlic sauce for apps. For entree we got Three-Meat Lasagna (beef, pork, veal, i believe) off of the special menu and the Veal Saltimbocca off the regular menu. We also combined it with a bottle of pinot grigio (Leo's is not BYOB since they have a full bar). Warm Proscuitto & Mozz Salad: HOLY SMOKES--orgasmic salad. I wish I was exaggerating so it wouldnt come off as me just being cray cray but im so serious. The proscuitto is a great salty season to it and has a lovely soft texture thanks to the mozz. Combined with the crunchiness of the (also seasoned) salad and it was absolutely perfectMussels in Garlic Sauce - I'm not a fan of clams or mussels so I didnt eat it but my fiancee did. He said while they were good, they werent amazing. He ordered a small tray but it was still a HUGE portion so he didnt finish it.Three Meat Lasanga - This was another hit, beautifully executed and a perfectly balanced taste. Their tomato sauce is so boss and went well with everything. Perhaps one of the best lasagnas I've ever encountered, hands down.  It came with a choice of two additional meats on the side--I chose a meatball and sausage but didn't finish because of the next dish....Veal Saltimbocca - If the menu is the Greek pantheon, then this is probably Zeus. The veal is so friggen tender! And the saltimbocca...What the heck is in the sauce!?!? My fiancee ended up taking pieces of bread that they brought out to our table earlier and sopped up every last inch of the liquid off his plate. I joined in (lol). It also came with a side of spaghetti (also good).To say we were happy campers by the end of the meal is a vast understatement. We were pleased, surprised at the huge flavors, and thankful. Funny because a woman at a neighboring table quipped to her date "i wish i could live here..." At the end we got a slice of red velvet to go (which was decent, but i dont care for red velvet anyway).Our entire meal rounded out to around $85--VALID! For the amount of food and sheer awesomeness (including a whole bottle of wine) that is relatively cheap! the most expensive entree on the online menu is $19.95 so its definitely affordable. I almost forgot to mention that each course was timed perfectly, our entrees coming out in about 20 minutes.In one visit Leo's has stolen my heart and I intend on bringing my whole family here. Definitely want to try the pizzas too since I've seen rave reviews about it. If you're an Italian fan, do yourself a favor and go to Leo's!!TIP: this place does NOT accept credit cards of any kind so make sure to bring cash or be prepared to use the ATM.
2013-03-07,4,Bottom line - Fantastic food.  I came here after a number of people recommending it as well as the stellar yelp reviews.  Came on a Tuesday and the place was almost empty when we arrived at about 6:45.  By around 7:30, the place filled up, the music came on, and it was lively and a great ambiance.Food:App - Mussels in the garlic white wine sauce. Entrees -  Rigatoni Bolognese, and the Shells with chicken, pancetta, and mozz in a red sauce. All the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable.  The waitresses were nice enough.  Great overall experience, will definitely be back.
2013-03-05,5,I must say that I really, really love Leo's. When I eat here, I feel like I'm eating in the Hoboken of 1952. The servers are a bit cantankerous in a fun sort of way, really adding to the atmosphere.The salads are kind of bland, but I never go to an Italian restaurant for the salad. I ADORE the mozzarella-topped garlic bread with marinara sauce. It's pretty much the reason I go there. Otherwise, the baked macaroni and gnocchi are delicious!!
2013-02-16,5,A+.  Leo's is the kind of place you eat at once a week.  the food is delicious, the service is great and the prices are very reasonable.  the pizza is great, chicken parm is great and the veal saltimbocca is my favorite around.  the place is always packed and there is a reason for it.  the ambiance reminds you that the place has been around for a million years and hasnt changed.  those who prefer trendy spots may not love Leo;s but i will be dining there often.
2013-02-01,4,Came to Leo's to celebrate a friend's birthday with her family, and had a lovely time.  Leo's is a bit off the beaten path in Hoboken - a few blocks west of the popular Washington street strip.Uncomplicated and thorough Italian options on the menu - we started with an antipasto, which had amazing eggplant & ricotta bites as well as fried clams & shrimp.  Homemade  Italian bread as well.I tried the house specialty, the Chicken Sorrento - a balsamic glazed chicken with a strip of eggplant, mozzarella, red sauce, and penne.  Bangin' combo. Also tried a friend's vodka sauce - SO good.  Would go back to order anything in that sauce again.
2013-01-07,5,We visited Hoboken to pay our respects to the Chairman of the Board. The Frank Sinatra Birthplace is nearby on Monroe. We walked in at 4pm and unfortunately the dining room was closed. But, the bar was open! Sergio is the man in charge hear and he made a good stiff scotch and soda. We dropped $5 in the Juke Box and listened to Sinatra and Count Basie live at the Sands. I perused the pictures on the wall and sipped my cocktail. The place was a great place to rest on a cold January day after hours of walking Manhattan and Hoboken.Sergio was very kind. We had asked for another place to eat since the dining room was closed for another hour. He said this was the best place in town. And I must admit, he was right. We stayed in New York for a week and this was the best meal I had the entire 8 days. This is the place served up the best Lasagna I had ever had in my life. The meatballs were to die for and the sausage...oh the sausage was delish! So glad we stayed for dinner. Everything is right about the place. The history, the vibe the location. I don't know when I will be in Hoboken again but I will gladly come here again. Great food, great service, great place. You MUST eat here if you are a Sinatra aficionado.
2013-01-03,4,Family owned, waitresses that have been there for a long time, Frank tunes on the Juke Box, cash only.  Classic red-sauce Italian that is a pleasure to revisit. Food is good, ambiance makes it better.
2012-11-10,4,Service was super-friendly. Ordered clams oreganata and penne alla vodka with shrimp to go. Took it all over to the hubster while he was on break at a gig he was doing while in town here. Even lukewarm, everything was delicious and the shrimp were plump, meaty, fresh deliciousness. I had to ask for plastic ware (was only given one set) and there were no extra napkins, Parmesan, red pepper flakes, or olive oil put in my bag. Not sure if that's an east coast thing, but the food was delish and needed no extras so its all good. Would've liked to dunk chunks of that crusty bread in some garlic and evoo though...
2012-10-22,5,After visiting Hoboken for more than three years, I finally checked out Leo's. It was great! Very old-school Italian vibe, and the staff was really friendly and welcoming. We had to wait just about 15 minutes for a table, but there was a spot at the bar, so we had drinks, and the wait wasn't a big deal at all. When we sat down, the waiter brought us a basket of bread... seriously delicious, warm, crusty, bread. We ordered the mussels special to start, with corn and tomatoes in a white wine sauce, and they were fantastic. The rest of our meal was great, especially my penne with vodka sauce. Our entire meal cost about $80, including alcohol and tip... not bad for a Saturday night in Hoboken. I'd definitely go back!
2012-10-16,4,Food is delicious! The inside is somewhat dated and run down and the staff is a bit older but the food makes up for it! Great Italian- cant go wrong.
2012-10-11,4,Great place to eat in Hoboken.I swung by here with a date on a Friday night. Managed to have seating within 10 minutes - so ultimate win right here. I found the service quick and attentive despite how rumbustious the place was at the time. I don't recall her name, but our waitress took great care of us. Very friendly. Seriously. Mega-friendly, even.Food was fantastic. Both times i've been here, I've had meat raviolis & the baked ziti. Simply to die for. You will not find anything wrong with the pasta selection here - they know what they're doing and they do it well.Prices are good.Two thumbs up here. I'll be back here many times in the future.
2012-10-02,5,This is probably my favorite place to eat in the entire world! I had family that used to live in hoboken back in the day and they came to Leo's all the time. As a child i was brought here as well and always had fond memories of bar pies and pasta just as if my mother made it. Yes, i am Italian, and it is very important to me. Being at Leo's is like being at home surrounded by family enjoying great food. It's a very intimate place. you WILL rub elbows with people and wait in line for the bathroom, but the food makes it all worth while! The only thing that never liked was the parking and the fact that they don't take cards. For the parking, it's hoboken. what can you do? get there early or go to a parking garage. For the no credit cards, they've been doing it by cash for years. you'll just have to bring some. I think they might even have an ATM to use.
2012-09-13,3,It's fine. Nothing particularly special. Okay food, okay service. Affordable, good if you're craving some chicken francese or something.
2012-08-27,4,Great. Food and inexpensive.   But. Not. Accessible. No. Parking.   And.  The. Service. Ends. Too.   Early.  Kitchen. Closes.  Early. Xcept. On. Friday. And. Saturday.     Good. For. People. Who.  Live. In. Hoboken.  AreLocals and. Can. Walk
2012-06-26,5,I googled "Best Italian Restaurant in Hoboken NJ" and this place appeared on my Blackberry. So I HAD to investigate as I have yet to find an amazing Italian place in Hoboken. This place is not on the beaten path; it is tucked away, far from Washington street where it's ALL about location and less about taste and service. The waitresses, two lovely ladies who happen to be sisters, are super friendly and endearing. They bend over backwards to make sure you are taken care of and get your order exactly how  you want it. The place is clean and is clearly a tribute to Frank Sinatra (who was born in the same hood and used to frequent this place ages ago).The food is SUPER yummy. Authentic Italian all the way AND moderately priced. They have a cool looking bar where locals sit and chat to the bar tender in a separate room. You can tell this place is for the locals, by the locals. I heard the owner died a few years ago but the staff still speak kindly of him and want to uphold his high standards. This place is so cozy, friendly, tasty and cool, I am going to become a regular. LOVES IT!!!For once I've nothing negative to say. Meow.
2012-05-21,2,I've been raised by Italians my whole life; this is NOT Italian food. The prices are reasonable and the staff, attentive; however, the food itself was below average. My linguini with clam sauce was swimming in butter. My boyfriend also got a pasta dish where butter seemed to be the main (if not the only) ingredient. While there were actual clams in my sauce, there's no question that the rest of the clams were canned. Our hot antipasto consisted of all frozen, deep fried, finger foods. To top it off, the soda was  disgustingly flat. Try washing off two day's worth of oil and grease with flat soda ... it's the worst. I'm usually very generous with my ratings, but when the best part of the meal is the bread that's served at the beginning, the place deserves only 2 stars ... at best!
2012-05-21,1,So I go with the gf because we feel like some Italian.  I lived down the block from this place for a year and never went in.  Too bad I had the bright idea to try it today.  We got the hot antipasto or as it should be know the pre frozen deep fried special - fried ravioli, mozz stix, and some pre frozen mussels marinara to boot.  Oh there were 2 baked clams in there as well.  Nice the waitress failed to mention this as we also ordered a dish of baked clams.  Maybe we would of stuck with them or got something else, as a former waiter, to me its just good service to mention you are getting the same thing in 2 dishes.On to dinner, yes the hill only goes down in this place.  I got linguine carbonara. Pancetta instead of bacon, yes it should be a nice dish.   I got a child's portion of pasta swimming in cream sauce.  The amount of sauce (heavy cream and butter) could have been good for 5 lbs of pasta.   The gf went for linguine with canned white clam sauce.  They actually threw  in 6 real clams to top the dish off.  I guess even they have limits on the minimum acceptance of the slop they serve.Leo's is def in my top 3 most disappointing meals of 2012.Leo's Grandevous - OUT!  do yourself a favor and Rendezvous elsewhere.
2012-05-14,5,Love this place! I've been eating here with my family for years.The food is delicious, the portions are large, and it's reasonably priced. The servers are extremely friendly and attentive. I would recommend the Mussels, the Meatball and Prosciutto Pizza Pies, the Linguini and Clam Sauce, and the Veal Parmigiana.  All very great choices!
2012-05-13,2,Blandest pasta I've ever had....real Italian food when they don't even have fresh Parmesan??this place had its hey day but now is just a run down place that's getting by on the glory of its past....
2012-04-16,3,Lorenzo T. nailed it - You want good Italian food on a budget then Leo's is your spot.  The food isn't going to wow you, but it's all reasonably priced along with the drinks ($4.75 heineken and peroni bottles).  The atmosphere is great  with a laid back old school vibe.  If you're in the mood for a local Italian place, then Leo's is worth a look at.  It won't be the best food you've ever had, but it will hit the spot.  Despite some of the reviews, our waitress (whose name I sadly forget) was terrific and very attentive.
2012-04-13,1,After reading all of the reviews about Leo's, my boyfriend and I were extremely excited to try it out. Upon entering the restaurant we were suprised by the informal decor and atmosphere. There were many children sitting in the surrounding tables and it was very loud. Our server was an older lady who was sweet as can be and very attentive. I ordered the chicken marsala and my boyfriend ordered the pasta with vodka sauce. While we were waiting for our food the waitress brought a basket of bread over. Some of the bread was OK and other pieces were burnt and tasteless. We ordered diet cokes which were the most flat soda I have ever tasted before.Our main entrees were also a huge disappointment. My chicken marsala tasted so strong of alcohol that i could barely eat it. The cook must not have cooked off the alcohol from the marsala wine which left the chicken tasting like it was sitting in straight alcohol. Finally i gave up on trying to stomach my chicken and pushed it aside. Along with my meal I received a bowl of "angel hair" pasta that looked like it was just taken out of a store bought bag. The sauce was overly sweet and unimpressive. My boyfriend's penne with vodka tasted nothing like vodka sauce. The waitress asked if I didn't like my chicken and I told her it was very bad. She took the entree off of our bill which was very nice and we appreciated it.This restaurant was a huge let down, as we were excited to have a great italian place right around the corner. They did attempt to correct the horrible meal by not charging us for the chicken marsala but it does not change the fact that it was bad food .Do not listen to the hype about this place, we did and we will never be returning!
2012-03-22,5,The travel booklet from our hotel called this place a "a shrine to Frank Sinatra".  They were right-this place loves Frank!  In addition, the food was remarkable.  They had an excellent selection and everything was great.  I'm gonna miss this place when I'm back home in Boston.
2012-03-14,3,All the other reviews regarding the service are very accurate. Our waitress was this sweet elderly woman but the hostess(who is also a waitress) was very rude. I got the linguine in red clam sauce and it was really good. The spinach in garlic was ok, I wouldnt order it again.
2012-03-07,4,Few places in Hoboken make you feel more at home than Leo's.  Italian comfort food in a casual setting.  Heaping portions.  One time I ordered the shrimp parm and it was smothered in cheesy goodness.  Their various pasta dishes are good  too, and they have excellent specials.  The service is good and the price is right.  And the whole place is pretty much a shrine to Sinatra.  What more can you ask for?
2012-02-29,1,Worst meal and service I've had in a very long time. Took almost an hour to get watered down soup and salad for my wife which looked like it came from the Shop Rite deli counter. Main course was equally bad, again the pasta was tasteless and the SAUCE!?!?!?!!?! I would honestly prefer ketchup. One waitress for the entire dining room kept one thing under control...nothing. I am not a disgruntled customer, but I just really wanted to share my thoughts, as this place is truly terrible.
2012-02-20,2,I ordered the shrip scampi. The shrimp weren't cooked well and the sauce was less than mediocre. The pasta on the side was decent, but you can find good pasta at almost any Itallian restaurant in NJ. Nothing to write home about. My friend had chicken parm which he also said was good, not great. The service was terrible. Our waitress was pretty snotty the first couple of times she came to our table. Then she asked if we had a Groupon and we said no, so she got a little nicer, but still a sourpuss. She was busy watching The Bachelor on the TV by the bar, which was obviously more important than waiting tables. Oh yeah, we were her ONLY table and still couldn't be bothered. I wouldn't go back unless there was nothing else open and I was starving.
2012-02-14,2,I don't have any complaints about the food at Leo's but everything else about this restaurant makes it a non-enjoyable experience. The service is about as terrible as you can get, I've eaten here several times and each time we waited about 20 minutes to put in our order. I don't need to be pampered and made feel special when I eat, I just want someone to realize that I've been sitting around with my mouth watering for quite some time.There are some other nuances that kind of annoy me about this place. The menu is very limited and doesn't have some staples that you'd expect to find at an Italian restaurant, calamari is one example that I can think of off the top of my head. They also don't accept credit cards which annoys me. It's 2012, I don't find it cute and retro to be a cash only establishment, I find it unnecessarily frustrating. And if you're going to make it cash only, at least have an ATM in the place, but they don't even do that, and by Hoboken's standards, there's nothing with ATM near by.Overall the food is pretty good (although definitely not the best Italian in Hoboken) but be prepared for an exhausting dining experience.
2012-02-07,5,Every time I have been here I have had an amazing meal, one weekend I went twice!  They start you with bread, dip it in the oil thats on the table, I could eat an entire roll! Then I normally get the mussels fra Diavolo, perfection!! I had lobster ravioli in Venetian sauce one time, it was one of the best things I ever tasted!! It was a special so the next time i went back they did not have it so i asked if i could get the sauce on something else, and they did!!  Onto dessert, the cannoli's AMAZING! They even sell jars of their sauce, I would buy it just to dip bread in its so good!! Staff makes you feel like family! One of my favorite places in Hoboken!Just remember cash only!
2012-01-30,3,This place can be very hit or miss.  Sometimes I've gone, loved the service, loved the food and other times the food is bland and the service is bad.  They are good with making adjustments and changes, which is nice and has helped make a decent meal into a good one.  I've tried a few appetizers and nothing was great, it's worth waiting for the dinner.
2012-01-29,2,Eh... been here a couple of times, and really, I'm not impressed with anything about this place. I could make dry spaghetti and tomato sauce out of a jar just as easily. The bread is not worth chewing. Tutta pasta is moderately better, but the problem is I have been spoiled with truly good Italian (Scarpetta and Crispo, to name a couple). I'm sure this place is totally acceptable to the culinary ignorant. Also, they are cash only.
2012-01-24,3,Good food, terrible service.  I was here on a busy Saturday night and an empty weekday night.  Both times we had a younger male server who (a) took forever to greet the table (b) took even longer to bring us beverages (c) was overall unattentive and aloof.  To top it off, the bread that they served while we waited was chewy, hard and flavorless.As for the food, it all tasted homemade and used fresh ingredients.  We had Deep Fried Ravioli. Scungilli fra Diavolo, Vegetable Bar Pie, Vodka Sauce Pie, and Penne Vodka.  The thing this place does exceptionally well is the sauces.  If no one was looking, I would have lapped up every drop of their Fra Diavolo and Vodka sauces.The Fra Diavolo has a nice tang, is pleasantly sweet, and comes in with a nice spicy kick at the end.  The Vodka sauce is rich and silky with a prominent taste of ripe tomatoes and fresh cream.Although the service has been bad, it will not stop me from dining here again. BEWARE:  Cash only.
2012-01-19,4,Solid Italian food at reasonable prices. It's nice enough to take a date without being too stuffy.
2012-01-14,4,Solid, no frills Italian food at a reasonable price. Wait staff is very warm and accommodating. Great place for dinner on a Friday night.  Downside: no credit cards.
2012-01-06,5,This is not a fine dining restaurant. Leo's is in a league of its own. I've been going for years - approximately 35. I've gotten pretty much the same meal for all 35 years  - Leo's famous bar pies. Sometimes plain. Sometimes with a topping. Sure they have other food that is good, but I don't care for anything else but the pizza, salads, and bread.As for the servers, bartenders, bus boys, etc., that's what makes Leo's such a great place, Mark L. That crabby waitress has been working there for 30+ years. She's like Flo in Mel's Diner on the show Alice. The other waitresses are sweet. One waitress is over 70 years old. The bartender is Leo's nephew. Yes, Frank Sinatra frequented Leo's. He and Leo were great friends. This place is flashy. The food is good. And the service is what gives it the character that's lacking in many YUPified eateries in Hoboken (many good in their own way). It's an original and hasn't changed. It's okay if you don't understand or like it. 1000's of people do. Go somewhere else. Trust me, you won't be missed.TIPS:  Get the bar pies. Say hi to Sergio, the bartender, and enjoy it for all it is, and isn't. No credit cards. Bring cash. There's an ATM.
2011-12-14,4,This place is a blast from the past, where everything is fixated on Sinatra, and I'm not complaining.  It's a cozy atmosphere, and after a few glasses of wine and an italian dish that will no doubt put you on that slow motion status, you won't want to leave.  If you're looking for an inexpensive, tasty meal, with a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, this is your spot.  Skipping the nonsense and getting straight to the point, here's what you should know:- CASH ONLY, but they have an ATM so don't worry.  Unless you're on that broke status.- Any of the pasta or spaghetti dishes are a can't lose decision.  I had a really good shells dish with chicken and cheese mixed in.  Pasta with meatballs classic also didn't disappoint.- Mussels Fra Diavalo are delicious- Pizza is your cheap yet tasty option- Be ready for some Sinatra, a glass or three of cab, and a good meal
2011-12-02,2,This a generous two stars.  How can anyone, in their right mind, give this place five stars? This place has no personality, average, at best food, and a service staff that wishes you were not there even though they work on "commission" aka tips. No customers, no tips. It is truly mind boggling.     We arrived and were sat by a what I assume was a bus boy. Greeted thereafter by our waitress who didn't seem too happy that she nor we were there. We were expected to share in her misery and she did a good job of sharing. Scowl, negative body language, the whole nine yards.                                            Ordered a couple of apps. Hot and cold antipasto. Total mistake on both. Two little wedges of provolone and two slices of salami, some greens, tomato and that was about it. The hot was a couple of clam shells with what I expected to be clams, but there weren't any clams with the stuffing in the shells, frozen cheese sticks, some fried ravioli and some mussel with a purple, red sauce tiny and nut much "muscle". Total miscue on all aspects.     The entrees were a little better, but I expected more from them. This is not an expensive place but it wasnt cheap either. The food was what you would expect in a two bit pizzeria that also cooked regular food. Sauces sucked and the portions were not that wow, and who wants more of lousy food anyway.     Out of habit I ended up leaving a 20% tip, though half that was deserved. That was the worst part of the night. Over tipping. Plus, as we left, the two waitresses were sitting at the bar and not a single lift of the head, not a good bye or a thank you, have a nice evening....  Save your money, this place is not worth it.
2011-11-27,2,I went to Leo's a couple of week's ago after having not been there for at least a couple of years. I was so disappointed! The place that had once been such a good, dependable Italian place was no more.  Food was ok - mussels were good and our entrees were fair.  The charm of the place could almost make up for this, but what really ruined it was the terrible service. We waited at least one solid hour for our food and the waitress hardly ever checked on our table.  When the food was finally dropped off, there were no mentions or apologies for how long we'd waited.  It then took forever to get the check as the waitress had to be hunted down!Won't be back.
2011-11-20,5,So delicious! I had been hearing great things for so long and finally tried it. The chicken marsala was delicious, and the portions are tremendous! Enough for two meals. Could not be more reasonable in price. This place is what great old fashion italian food should be!
2011-11-14,4,Italian comfort food at it's best!!!Have been eating at Leo's for many years now and it has never disappointed!Food is always consistent and the staff makes you feel welcome.The shrimp Sinatra and shrimp parm are two of my favorites. If you like shrimp you cannot go wrong with either of these two dishes. Their chicken and pasta dishes are well served also. If you are looking for some  Italian comfort food then look no further then Leo's you won't be disappointed!
2011-11-12,2,first i ordered, a soda. soda was flat, got another one and still flat. then, ordered mozz sticks and garlic bread. mozz sticks were good, garlic bread needed more garlic. main course was chicken parm with steak fries. chicken parm was completely bland! flavor less! and the sauce was also bland. steak fries were good.
2011-11-08,4,Hoboken Foodie loves this place! Why? Good food, reasonably priced, great ambiance and the service is good. This should be the poster child for a real "neighborhood" joint. No glitz just good food! The tomato sauce has a velvety texture and great taste. I had the veal parmesan and although it was not pounded to maximum tenderness it was in fact tender. I wish the pasta was fresh but hey that would drive the price up wouldn't it? Besides the sauce makes it alright alright!!
2011-11-04,1,Honestly I can't say that the food is good but I do like the atmosphere for drinks.  As a person who has waited tables in the past I find the servers have a lot to be desired especially your old timers they have been there a long time and make no effort to go out of their way..
2011-10-30,2,i am still so confused about the other reviews i read.  were they eating at the same place i was?  did we just go on a bad night?  it was a saturday night and the place was packed.  thought that was definitely a good sign but it went downhill from there.  and before i begin on a rant of disappointment, i must say that the service we received, from the hostess to the busboys to our waitress, was great,  and i think that is where the 2nd star comes in.the food was pretty tasteless, the presentation lacking (throwing appetizers on a bed of shredded iceberg does not mean a dish is well plated) and the pasta left much to be desired.  i was never really sure how you can mess up pasta but i have now seen it done.  the portion sizes were pretty good but who needs more of something you don't like?  maybe i should have gotten a bar pie because that is something people seem to like.....not good overall.
2011-10-18,4,You want good Italian food on a budget. Then Leo's is your spot.You get the best bang for your buck here.Personal bar pie's are great . Super cheap ($3-$7) with alot of topping options. I really liked the Vodka Sauce pie, and am looking forward to trying a few others next time. Soft, thin, and crispy. Just the way a pie should be. Really great sauce!It's a great spot for groups. Alot of seating and no reservations means you can pop in and get a big group seated fast.Bar in the front is old school cool, and drinks are on the low side price wise as well. The pasta options are great and so many are homemade, can't go wrong here. Overall Leo's is a standard in Hoboken dinning. It has served so many people over the years and continues to be a place that people ask me about when I mention I live in Hoboken. Eat a little history and try out Leo's next time you in the mood for some Italian.  Tell them Sinatra sent you.NOTE: Cash only. ATM near the bar.
2011-08-28,2,I wanted to like this place I really really did.  An old school place with a lot of potential.  Classic menu but the food just didn't do it.  Based on two trips the food its below average.  Servers have an attitude like they work at the greatest place in the world.  I guess you could do worse with Italian, but would say pass on this.  Not sure how the yelp review is so high it's usually more on point.Cash only.
2011-08-05,2,Went here on a recommendation and I was disappointed. I had the chicken parm which is a staple in an Italian restaurant. It was a bit soggy and the sauce was not the best. The pricing and the service was adequate. The bottle of wine that we bought was not that expensive but expect to pay over $40 for something like that. The ambiance was not romantic or even conducive to talking.
2011-08-03,5,How can a shrine to Frank Sinatra in Hoboken not receive 5 stars!?I loved this place! On a random trip to Hoboken, a friend and I wanted dinner with a Frank Sinatra feel. We searched Yelp, and found Leo's to be our best option. We were not disappointed.The atmosphere is very cozy, with a family sort of feel. I loved all of the Frank pictures decorating the walls. Frank visited the restaurant and his chair is on display above the bar (nice touch).The food is delicious and tasted homemade. It was also very reasonably priced. However, be aware they only accept cash (if you forget there is an ATM in the restaurant).The service was very friendly and attentive. The made you feel welcome and at home.This is a must for a Sinatra fan in Hoboken or for just a nice reasonably priced night in a cozy Italian restaurant.
2011-07-22,3,I really wanted to give Leo's more than 3 stars, but I couldn't do it.  Here are my thoughts:(1) Decor and Atmosphere:  I thought that the place was quaint, with soft rat pack music playing in the background, and a wonderful array of photograpsh of old blue eyes hanging all over the walls.  This, in and of itself, gives this place one star.(2)  Service:  Although the staff was attentive and sweet, they all could really learn a few lessons.  We ordered a bottle of white wine, and the waitress filled our glasses all the way to the top and left the bottle on the table without putting it on ice.  Clearly, filling a glass to the top will allow the vino to get warm quickly, and not putting the white wine in a wine bucket on ice will also ruin the remaining vino.  Another service point is that we ordered  a small dish of mussels fra diavlo to be followed by chicken parmigiana for my date and the three meat (veal, pork, and beef) lasagna special for myself (I'll discuss the food in a second).  We were not even half way done with the mussels and the waitress brought out the entrees and just put them on the table.  I couldn't help but make a snide remark; after all, I don't just eat, I like to dine.  Pushing dinners on top of your entrees does not allow you to dine.  Further, the bus boy continued to come back and attempt to take the food from us while there was more than half of the chicken parmigiao left.  I felt like telling him, "Don't call us.  We'll call you."    (3) The Food:  This has to be the highlight of my experience, because at the end of the day, it's all about the food.  This is probably the reason why I will return here, and order a bottle of red next time.  The mussels fra diavlo were excellent with just the right spice in the marinara sauce and appropriate tenderness in each mussel.  The freshly baked italian bread was great to soak up the sauce.  As far as the meat lasagna special goes, the lasagna was cooked perfectly, and mixing those three meats the good old-fashioned Italian way made me feel like I was at grandma's house for dinner.  I also had a delicious sausage and meatball that came with the special, which were tasty too.  The tomato sauce tasted fresh and home-made. (4) The Price:  All of the dishes were moderately priced and just about what you would expect for an Italian joint of this caliber.
2011-05-31,4,Where to begin?I read the reviews on yelp before I went to this place, and I think some people here have some screwed up ideas. 1. I went on a hot day, around 5pm. I felt sticky after walking from the PATH. It was so nice to walk in and sit at a pleasant bar with a wonderful bartender!2. I'm glad I knew it was cash only.  I've been to plenty of cash only places in NYC- yes, they exist, and they aren't rare. 3. I had a gin and tonic. they had a decent selection of gins, although there was nothing fancy. The bar was formica- it was like being in the 60s. Cool. And yes, there is Sinatra memorabilia everywhere- Frankie used to eat here and he was a Hoboken native. If you go to Italy and have dinner at a place where Giuseppe Verdi hung out in 1901, you'll see tons of opera stuff from him everywhere, too.  Sinatra was one of the best jazz musicians of all time- listen to his albums from when he was with Capitol.4. I told the bartender that when I was a kid in Queens my parents used to take me to a small neighborhood red sauce place, and I was in the mood for old-school. The guy actually put on the jukebox and played oldies like Louis Armstrong, Jerry Vale, Elvis, and Luis Prima, as well as The Chairman of the Board. That's hospitality.5. My bread came to me warm and crunchy, with soft butter. Perfect. And my drink wasn't watery. Nice.6. One guy at the bar ordered pizza. People, this is not a pizzeria- this is an italian restaurant. The pizzas are bar pizzas, i.e., for one person. It looked delicious and slightly floppy, the way NYC/NJ pizza tends to be. Yum. In this area, if oil isn't dripping off the pizza, something is wrong with it. 7. I ordered shrimp Fra Diavolo. It was on a Tuesday after Memorial Day.  The shrimp were fresh and slightly briny, with good texture. The sauce was spicy but not to the point where there was only heat and no flavor. The spaghetti under the sauce was al dente. Great.8. When my order came, the bartender looked at it and asked me if it had too much sauce. He said they could re-plate it with less sauce if I wanted.  I declined.  That was good service too.9. I ordered a cannoli for dessert. The shell was crisp and the filling was fresh and homemade.  The espresso was tasty. I ordered it with a piece of lemon peel on the side, Sicilian peasant style. 10. One drink, one entree, one espresso (comped), one dessert- $29 and change, including tax. The bartender was personable, friendly, and gave me great service. And as an African-American woman dining alone in a mostly Italian-American neighborhood, that's a big deal. I'm also a personal chef who went to culinary school and who has eaten in numerous fine restaurants, and I was impressed.I will be going back with my boyfriend so we can listen to Dino, have pasta 1920s style, and maybe finish with some limoncello. One thing. This place will let you order takeout, but don't expect a takeout waiting area.  This is a real restaurant, not Applebee's.EDIT- Four stars here means 'This food is pretty good, the ambiance is fun, and I intend to go there again'. It does not mean 'the food and ambiance here is one step below Le Bernardin'. In other words, it's a good solid place and a special neighborhood gem. If you are in Hoboken it might be worth stopping in because there's a high probability of having a good relaxed time.  Danny Meyer, the patron saint of NYC hospitality, would be happy with the service I received.
2011-05-27,3,Four or five years ago, this would've been a five star review, and not because it was the best Italian food in the world. Leo's food has always been good, solid, dependable, affordable and satisfying, but nothing to write home about from a culinary standpoint. But it was a completely authentic, old school Hoboken experience, from its fantastic jukebox to the cheesy decor (Sinatra memorabilia notwithstanding) and the cranky staff. A number of years ago, however, they tried to make the joint a bit more upscale, did some renovations, removed some of the Sinatra artwork and just made it less... fun. (At least the jukebox is the same and I actually like that they only take cash.) Leo's is still one of the best places to go for a gut-busting Italian meal in the home of Sinatra (although the wine list is meh at best... that's the one thing I wish they WOULD'VE upscaled), but, like so many things in this gentrified mile square, Leo's just ain't what it used to be.
2011-05-25,5,LOVE this place.  Kind of a bummer that it's cash only, but the food is more than worth it.  Tastes homemade, and all the wait staff has that italian mother feeling -- always making sure you're happy and have everything you need.Best eggplant parm I ever had too.
2011-05-24,4,I had the chicken marsala. This is one of my fave Italian dishes. The wine was extra sweet but I loved it.  The food has a home made taste to it.  The mozzarella pie was good also.
2011-05-23,5,Leo's is the Best Italian Restaurant in Hoboken!!!   it is HOBOKEN....If you want a true feel of the town go here.   The food is great and extremely reasonable.   You cannot get broccoli rabe anywhere for 5.50. Frank Sintra all over the place,,,you can feel his presence.  Some of the waiting go back to the days when Frank was there.If you haven't been there go now!!!!
2011-04-28,5,My fave Italian spot in Hoboken.  Old school, no frills, gritty, and good.  Do not come here if you want something "inventive" or with "depth of flavor."  You will be disappointed.  Come for the Italian classics, huge portions, surly waitresses, and simple good sauce that reminds you of the one your grandma used to make, you know the one she simmered on the stove for hours every Sunday and stirred with the same wooden spoon she beat you with.  That's Leo's.  And like many other Italian-run "establishments" don't forget, it's cash-only.
2011-04-13,5,I have often driven past Leo's on my way out of Hoboken and into the Heights. The feel of it is so inviting, every time. Perhaps the vibe just jives with what I like about a bona fide Italian restaurant.There is a genuine and casual feel to this place. Sautéed broccoli rabe to start. Housemade Caesar dressing on the salad. Linguine with clam sauce. Lasagna. Martinis. red table wine. Jamesons.We left happy.You should go here.
2011-04-06,5,I LOVE LEO'S!!We usually come here almost every Friday night after work, and we love it!  The food is good, the staff is good, and the drinks are well priced.  After going there so often, the staff and owners are almost like family to us.  Even alot of the Friday evening customers we have gotten to know and love.  This is not really a typically Hoboken drink all night type of place.  It's a old-style Italian family type place.  We really enjoy it and we will continue to return!
2011-04-04,5,I've been going to Leo's for about ten years now and it is my absolute favorite restaurant on the planet. Let me put it this way... If I knew it was going to be my last meal, I'd head to the corner of 2nd and Grand. Depending on which day you're there and the luck of where you're seated, the service ranges from good to out of this world. If you get Linda as your server, you'll know what I mean. My only suggestion for food (because honestly, everything is really great) is to definitely try the mussels. If you like food on the spicier side, get them Fra Diavolo. The sweet sauce is good also, but fra diavolo is the way to go. The mussels are always cleaned to perfection (I've never had any grit at Leo's) and cooked perfectly. Price-wise, its not too bad. With mussels and an entree expect around 20-25 a person. Definitely WELL worth it. It's no wonder the chairman of the board used to hang there, this is classic, great, Italian food. I recommend it 100% and had to come on here and spread the word. If you go, have a few mussels for me.
2011-04-02,4,The little bar pies here are fantastic and are offered in so many different varieties. Try one with caramelized onions, goat cheese, and a vegetable like spinach or broccoli.. delicious combination. The entree selection is that of your typical Italian restaurant, which isn't a negative by any means. I had angel hair pasta with meatballs which was very good. The cannoli for dessert was good too. There seemed to be much more here than I experienced the first go-around, especially at the bar, so I'll need to go back sometime.
2011-01-25,4,It looks like I just found my neighborhood bar!  Good food, friendly service, well priced and a relaxed atmosphere.  My girlfriend and I went to Leos on Friday night to grab a bite to eat and a drink before catching a movie and it hit the spot.The bar area at Leo's definately has a neighborhood bar feel.  The bar tenders are very friendly, and you can tell that they remember the people who have been there (there are a good many regulars).  They called us out asking, "Is this your first time?", which was a bit embarassing, but they were trying to be helpful, not rude.   The food at Leo's was better than I was expecting.  Their muscles, were simple but very well done, they halved the shells, which made them very easy to eat.  Their bar pies were good too, and were larger than I expected.  Add on the bread they serve with dinners, and that is a TON of food, for around $20. We also ordered the antipasta, which was ok, but nothing special.We ate at the bar, and between the bread basket, muscles, anti pasta, two bar pies, and extra plates, we took up a lot of space, but no one minded a bit.  They kept giving us extra serving plates too, which confused me a bit, I wasn't sure if we were doing something wrong, or they were just being helpful.  (For 2 of us there were 7 full size plates on the bar between everthing.)I will be back to Leo's soon, to grub on some food and enjoy some adult beverages.  I next time I leave Leo's I hope to tell the bar tender "see you next week" before walking out the door.
2011-01-12,4,I came here for a mothers day dinner. It was great. The only thing that sucks about downtown Hoboken is looking for parking. This place is worth it. Starting from the mozzarella stick to the the shrimp parm. The staff was extremely attentive. A mush go for anyone
2011-01-10,5,Definitely my favorite place to eat in Hoboken! The food is fantastic and reasonably priced and the atmoshere is lively. It's someplace I can bring the kids and/or my parents and know that everyone will have a good time.
2010-12-22,3,We went to Leo's on a friend's recommendation.  Immediately upon walking in, you could tell exactly what kind of a place it was.  There were very clearly regulars at the bar, and the waitresses all had that "if you get to picky you're going to bother me" attitude.  For what we were looking for, it was perfect.We had clams for an appetizer, and as the waitress told us, they were pretty bread-y.  Good but not outstanding.  In addition, we had a salad with olives & cheese that we shared that we really both liked.  As entrees, I had chicken francese, which as someone else said was good, but pretty run of the mill.  Nothing special.  My husband had the special, which he felt was really good.  The coffee and espresso were actually really good.We have eaten at what feels like countless Italian restaurants.  This was by no means white tablecloth, but it was a good meal, at a very reasonable price.  I doubt we'll ever be in Hoboken again anytime soon, but I would recommend Leo's as a good place to get a reliable meal.
2010-12-16,4,I was walking through Hoboken on my to Grimaldi's when the smell from Leo's drew me in for a closer look. I peered through the window and saw a very cozy (yes I'm using the word cozy) bar with pictures of Frank everywhere. I popped in to look at the menu and was very surprised to see how reasonable the prices were. I decided to sit at the bar and have a drink and held off on ordering food until I saw somes dishes come out of the kitchen. I ordered a Jim Beam Manhattan up and it was made perfectly, with bitters. The Lasagne (wed night special) was delivered to the gentleman sitting next to me. It looked delicious and was served with seperate side of meatballs in marinara. I followed suit and ordered the same. It came out after a noticeable wait, fine with me because In had a great drink in front of me and enjoyable conversation with the bartender and the gentleman sitting next to me. The meal was terrific, and I enjoyed a glass of the house red which they comped at the end of the meal. I have been and will continue to go there at least one Wednesday a month for that dish. The total bill was 29.00 before tip.
2010-12-04,2,I wanted to love Leo's, I really did. I've heard good things about it, and when we were seated, we were surrounded by several diners who you could tell were regulars, which was a promising sign. We got the fried ravioli for an appetizer, which was just okay, nothing out of this world. I got the chicken francese and it was just okay - nothing special. My dinner came with a side of pasta in their marinara sauce and I thought the sauce was a little bland. My boyfriend got the penne vodka with chicken. I tried some and the vodka sauce was decent but again, nothing special. I did enjoy the ambiance and our waitress, but overall, I was really expecting a better meal.
2010-06-01,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Really cozy atmosphere and classic italian dishes. Cool spot to come to mid-week for comfort food and a glass of wine. I usually get something with the bolognese sauce. The bar pies are really good too, and very comfortable bar to hang at.
2010-05-07,2,Seriously....yuck! Get a chicken parm sandwich from luca brasi's, entrees from augustinos, pizza from wherever, but don't get them here...they need to step up their game if they want better reviews. It's a shame that average (at best) food can pack the crowds in. On a side note I might conduct a psychological study to see why Sinatra playing in an old Italian restaurant elicits a positive response and makes food taste better to many people.
2010-04-11,5,On our last day in the big city, one of the port authority cops recommended this place. So we ventured over and had lunch on our way out of town. Can you say O-M-G? What a wonderful hidden gem. The lasagna was to die for and the sausage and meatballs literally melted in your mouth. . .fantastic place, Plus the nice lady gave us a fee t-shirt because my hubby was on the job like her nephew.  A true delight and contrary to Amanda S.'s lack of knowledge of WHY there is Sinatra memorabilia there, I in fact knew why. And ole blue eyes may be dead and gone but his legend lives on with many true blue Italians like myself. Keep it up Leo's we will be back when we venture back to the East Coast.
2010-03-11,3,Leo's is a Hoboken institution, and I after I set one foot in here, one thought crossed my mind: does Sinatra own this restaurant?  No?  Just some creep who thinks it's appropriate to hang about 700 photos of Sinatra all throughout the restaurant?  Cool.  But in the bathroom, really?There was an old chair on the cabinets above the bar, which I can only conclude was a chair that Old Blue Eyes once sat in.  GET A GRIP, PEOPLE, THE MAN IS DEAD.DEAD! Sinatra-obsessed decor aside, this is old-school Italian, and by "old school," I mean pasta with red sauce.  If you're looking for crispy crostini, tender short ribs, or imaginative pastas, you'll be disappointed.  The cheese tortellini was pretty good and the caesar salad was decent, but the whole experience was just pretty underwhelming.A Hoboken institution, indeed--like the whole city, you leave, thinking, "Ehhh..."
2010-03-07,2,I did enjoy the bar, and the very local italian american atmosphere... The menu also had some great Italian American dishes.... Unfortunately that is as positive as I can get. The friend Ravioli, had a lack of flavor and filling... the Veal Parm was tough. But the bill was not bad at all, so I may give them a second chance... but with so many choices in town, it may not be soon.
2010-02-17,1,SKIP IT!You can find better Marinara sauce in the canned sauce section of A&P.  It is sans-taste.I think a lot of these reviewers either just assume that they were supposed to like the food because Leo's is an "institution" or maybe are from the Midwest or something.  Disappointment at your own risk.  Don't say I didn't warn you.
2010-02-13,1,Leo's has been in Hoboken for over 70 years . . . and after many sputtered out attempts, my g/f and I finally managed to get a Friday night table at this Hoboken institution.The $20 bottle of pinot nightly special started the evening off on the right foot . . .unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.The mussels, which were always raved about, were sandy, slight and unsucculent.When I asked what came on the "supreme bar pie," the less than friendly server simply replied, "everything" and asked if I wanted Anchoivies. I said, "sure", a big mistake. These Anchoivies tasted like they'd been sitting in a can from the beginning of Leo's time in Hoboken.And the service, was, well, our server seemed to have stopped caring about her guests experience about 20 years ago.Look, its an iconic locale in the back of Hoboken. There is charm in that and charm in good home italian cooking. But, seriously, one can't ride on history and nostalgia alone.
2010-02-09,4,I have one major issue with Leo's. Whenever I take my friends here from out of town the next time they come and visit they don't want to go any place else! There's nothing special or unique with the food here it just good fresh basic Italian food. You can sit there all day with there freshly made red sauce and out of the oven bread and be happy! The service can be kind of bipolar. Have had a middle age angry at the world woman throwing plates of food at us on one hand. But other times the sweetest little old lady who will get anything you need and everything else in between. But even with the bad service the food has always made up for it. My go to dish usually is the Shrimp Parmesan but I have brought other people who have raved about there clam sauce. My sister who only eats about 8 dishes ever, one of them being Penne Ala Vodka has said it's the best Penne Ala Vodka she has ever had. But even with the bad service the food has always made up for it.
2010-01-25,5,We will keep coming back! And we will wait for a table like we were in NYC 'cause this is just a good ol' classic family run Italian restaurant offering a hearty meal for cash. The ravioli didn't look so hearty, but i was quite full by the last bite.
2010-01-16,2,Grimalde's and Delfino's has better food. Leos is good, but come on... Accept credit cards! Don't milk us by pointing to the inhouse ATM right next to the bar like some kind of coincidence.The bread boy also touched our bread with his bare hands... and all 6 of us knew he came from the dishwasher. We just saw him! Seriously... Frank Sinatra is a great guy and all, but just because he ate here, and the countless other spots in Hoboken for that matter, does not make you guys worthy of a 5star diamond award. That place is in Hell's Kitchen.
2010-01-08,4,Went here with a big group based on the reviews on yelp. The food was great. I had the veal parmesean. Wonderful. Contrary to what is listed on the top of the yelp page, they do not take reservations. We had a party of 10 and were able to sit right down though. It is a quick walk from the train station and even faster from the light rail. There are a couple reviews talkign about the waitresses. We had a waiter who was very sharp and personable. The food was all served hot and tasted fresh. No complaints from anyone who went. You can get beer by the pitcher which is a good value, and the food is generally a good value. The portions are not gigantic, but what you do get is very tasty. I would recomend this place to friends and would be interested in going again.For some reason it reminds of a place in little falls called ernestos that I used to go to with my grandparents. It smells very authentic inside.I would give the bathrooms a 3 star rating. They arent the cleanest but they arent dirty either. Just old I guess.Overall, great resteraunt if you are looking for some good italian food at reasonable prices.
2010-01-08,4,The service is not terrific, but the food is.  The seafood especially is very fresh.  The prices are also much better than the Italian places on Washington Street.
2010-01-08,5,Some of the best vodka penne I have ever had- highly recommended! Great service and reasonably priced.
2009-12-23,4,Leo's is cash-only no frills Italian with excellent service and what seemed like remarkably authentic Italian (without being too heavy). Prices, Portions and Plates are all great. Here's the rundown on what I tried tonight:-Mussels Marinara - first place I've been to where they halve the mussels for you (awesome) and simply throw some sauce on perfectly cooked mussels. Simple but good.-Mozzarella Sticks - standard fare, nothing exceptional here-Veal with Mushroom & Lemon - excellent and highly recommended-Shrimp Sinatra - very good-Linguine w/ Meat Sauce - very simple dish, but awesome
2009-12-18,4,This is the restaurant version of an old-man bar, which is part of its charm. The waitresses are salty but efficient, and the food is good ole red-sauce Italian. It won't wow you or anything, but you go here to bask in the Sinatra-loving Hoboken of yore vibe and to drink some vino with your buddies. The mussels marinara were pretty good, and the prices make me happy. They renovated since the last time I was in there and fancied up the joint a little bit, modernizing and enlarging the bar and moving it (I think) over right by the entrance. Mr Blue Eyes would approve.
2009-11-12,4,Reminds me of the 50-year old, old-school Italian restauant we went to every week when I was a kid growing up in PA.  Except Leo's is better because Frank Sinatra used to hang out there.Maybe I love Leo's because of the nostalgia, or maybe it's because I love a traditional hearty Italian dinner with meat, cheese, pasta and red sauce.  I order the lasagna whenever they have it and I always get the meatballs.For the most authentic experience, skip the dining room and pull up a stool at the 75-year old bar, order a Chianti, make friends with the bartender, and enjoy your lasagna and meatballs right there.
2009-11-01,4,Nice dinner last night, Halloween night.  Cozy, comfortable neighborhood kind of place.  Took another reviewer's advice and ordered off the specials - Mahi-Mahi with Lentils and Grilled Shrimp with Butternut Squash Ravioli - both creative & very fresh.  Service was responsive and warm and friendly, treated like regulars.  Bread was excellent.  No champagnes on the list, so had the $19 Prosecco - a good substitute.  The Sinatra memorabilia is everywhere - funny.
2009-08-29,4,Excellent authentic Italian food I love the chicken parm but services gets slow when busy but is still a great places
2009-07-14,3,Ate here a while ago, don't remember what I got. we were seated in the bar area - I think there is a back room area as well. I did not like the ambience of eating in the bar room due to the close proximity to the bar, tv noise, etc. The food and service were good - but it didn't make me want to travel ALL THE WAY across Hoboken when there are great Italian alternatives closer to me.ALL THE WAY meaning like 5 blocks off Washington.
2009-06-15,5,My favorite little Italian place in town! BEST LASAGNA ever (seriously folks, don't pass this up!) Small and a bit off the beaten path in Hoboken, but so worth the trip.
2009-06-05,1,When my pasta arrived, there was a hair sitting right on top and the waiter didn't even notice. I returned it. When my second one arrived, all seemed fine. I ate half of it and brought the rest home. Today, I wanted to eat the leftovers, and HEY guess what? THERE IS A HAIR IN IT... GROSS. Mediocre service (waitress didn't even know there were empty tables and kept patrons waiting to be seated - we basically had to keep telling her there were available tables). Half-decent food (over-rated by the other users for sure).. and worst of all, GROSS HYGIENE! The only thing "grande" about this place is how overrated it is. DISGUSTING.
2009-05-24,3,Bland sauces on various pastas. The price was right but the taste was not out-of-sight. Not sure I'd come back. Doesn't Hoboken have anything better than this?
2009-05-15,5,i grew up eating their bar pies. they used to be like 2.00 a piece now i think there like 5 but still worth it. i could eat 45 of those things!the mozzarella sticks are great too!!!  it has a very vintage frank sinatra-ey feel to it inside!  good old hoboken will be nothing without leo's!
2009-04-25,4,Good for "Jersey" italian, but don't expect haute-italian featuring grilled fish, etc.  This is "red lead", great pasta, gravy, and meatballs.  If you get a spaghetti-and-meatballs urge, go.
2009-04-14,4,4.5 stars.. Aye Mambo, mambo Italiano, aye mambo.. that's the song that plays in my head when I enter into Leo's, my ode to old Blue Eyes (who frequented this place).  Probably the one of best Italian foods in HOBOKEN (I'm split between here and Michelina's).Like Callie T, I always end up ordering the baked pasta shells with chicken and melted cheese throughout.  It comes out piping hot and it looks like it would be a small portion, but it is actually really very filling.   My husbone likes to order veal and it was cooked to perfection.  He ate it up in 5 minutes that I didn't even get to taste it.  I know, what an oinker ;)  I've also had the lasagna - perfect.The place only takes cash and the wait for dinner time rush could be 45 minutes.  They have one waitress who has been there forever, she is a little rough around the edges, but hilarious at the same time.
2009-04-05,5,Best bar pies in Jersey, Great food and bar also. this is a good place to dine  with your family, friends, girl, or whoever.
2009-04-03,5,AMAZING Italian Food...I had the baked penne pasta with chicken, and it was so good, I kept eating, even when I was stuffed!!! The sauce (or gravy, whatever you want to call it) was the best I have ever had!!! I also split a bar pie with my BF, for an appetizer, and it was delish as well.The service was fantastic. The selection was great. It was a Friday night, and the place was packed, but we still had good food, and didnt have to wait super long. You can make it a casual place, or go there for a date, and get a little dressy. Overall, this place rocks, and everyone should experience it at least once in their life!!
2009-03-21,2,I have lived in Hoboken for 2 years and my husband has lived here for ten years. He took me to Leo's tonight because I wanted to try a restaurant that I had never been to. Now I know why he always takes me to Margheritas! Am I missing something at Leo's? I ordered the penne with tomato sauce and meatballs and when the penne arrived it was cold all around the plate but the meatballs were sort of warm. The waitress brought it back and it came back steaming hot meatballs and again the penne was not hot. The sauce was absolutely herendous as well. I don't know if they make their own sauce but it tasted like it came out of the can. We also waited for our appetizer salad, mind you, a salad which takes no cooking preparation for at least 20 minutes. I would never go back there and I will stick to going to the best italian restaurant in Hoboken which is margheritas or stay home and make my own pasta with sauce from a bottle that doesn't taste like Ragu.
2009-03-12,5,Nom Nom Nom.Their vodka sauce is amazing.The prices are cheap!The waitstaff is friendly.Great all around. One of my Hoboken favorites.
2009-02-17,5,What's not to like?  Delicious food, very reasonably priced, and Frankie Blue Eyes was a regular!I've lived in Hoboken for two years but only been to Leo's twice:  once for take out and once for dinner, both times had a good experience and a great meal.Can't belive I missed it for this long.  It's now officially part of my dining out rotation.
2009-01-14,5,I'm so sad my brother is leaving Hoboken, although I know my parents will still take me to Leo's when I visit Jersey.  Everything on the menu is fabulous, but all I ever need to eat is tortellini with marinara and a side of meatballs.  Their sauce is that good.  I flipped when they started jarring their sauce--I pack up about 2 jars in my suitcase to bring back to STL.  Sometimes I share, but usually only with my husband.
2009-01-12,5,If you're looking for Italian food, and I don't mean fake, I'm talking the real thing - this is the place.  Great pastas and chicken dishes - the gravy is delicious.  The portions are huge as well - I brought at least half of mine home for a second meal.  Eat to the tunes of Frank Sinatra and his face is pretty much like wallpaper at Leo's.  I'd definitely consider it a great family restaurant and will go back at the next chance I get!
2008-03-29,4,Pros: 1. Great pasta sauce2. Lots of babies to look at if you go before 7pm for dinner3. Frank Sinatra's pictures and his "throne"4. Dont try to order lean at this place - better eat the food as greasy as it is. We order our chicken parmesian dishes grilled and we regretted it! Cons:1. Only 2 meatballs with your spaghetti & meatballs2. If you get the sausage sandwich, dont expect any veggies or anything on your bread except a sausage and bread. I would pay extra for the onion.
2007-01-19,5,My friends and I stopped here for dinner with no idea of what to expect --- the outside is unassuming and there aren't any windows to peer into.  What we found is a shrine to Frank Sinatra that happens to serve Italian food.  The staff is friendly to the point that you could bring a date and even if it was your first visit you could give her the impression you are somehow connected to the mob.
