2021-10-24,3,Nice location by water and good service by the staff. My only gripe is the 24k wings, they're decent at best.  Not too much taste and relatively bland. I as well as the table of people I was with definitely had high expectations. Hey at least I can say I tried edible gold‍.  3.5 stars
2021-10-20,4,Pretty good spot. We had dinner there when staying overnight in Hoboken. Food was very good. Atmosphere is cool and service was fine. We were sat quickly but the table we were given was a strange choice when there were much better options available. Before sitting, I noticed my chair was broken (I assume they tried to hide it at the table no one is even given).
2021-09-28,4,The Ainsworth is one of our favorite spots in Hoboken, we never have a bad meal here. The atmosphere was a little louder than usual as well as the music but overall was another successful trip this restaurant. I would definitely recommended their Mac & cheese burger.
2021-09-26,4,We went here last week for brunch with a friend. I would give the place five stars for the service but closer to three for the food. Our server was really friendly and helpful, and she was understanding that one of the members of our party was running a bit late. We did the bottomless mimosas brunch, which wasn't a bad choice. The mimosas were good and came through continuously. All things considered, it was a bit pricy though. We paid $45 each for the brunch, which included the mimosas and choice of an entree. I did the huevos rancheros. They were good but a bit plain all things considered. It didn't come with a side. My partner got the steak omelet, which he quite enjoyed. Again though, a bit pricey. If you think you can get $30 worth of mimosas in your 90 minute reservation, then by all means go for it. Otherwise, you're probably better off just ordering an entree and whatever drinks you'd otherwise order.
2021-09-21,2,First of all let me start off by saying that this place is expensive. Drinks are 14-16 range and not worth it at all. Service is far below average. You better have deep pockets ready before coming here. Food was just okay. I would probably NOT recommend this place unless you're really dying to check it out. This place is overhyped.
2021-09-16,4,A solid brunch spot! Gorgeous views from this place and a decent menu. I was able to enjoy the beyond burger and a Bloody Mary. Everything tasted fresh and came out very quickly. Prices are decent and service was friendly.
2021-09-13,2,Always liked going to the ones in Manhattan. Turkey burger is excellent. Atmosphere is fun and if you go at the right times the music isn't blistering loud. Favorite cocktail is the Crooked Knife. Jalapeño Tequila, Agave and Lemon juice served over one block cube. Unfortunately the bartender at this one didn't know I've been a regular at 18th street and 26th street. I watched him substitute agave for Simple Syrup (they are not the same!) which have totally different flavor profiles. Agave offers a touch of complexity and sweetness where as simple just sweetens a drink. Ordered two of these both times they tasted different and both times I got regular ice chips which was the same ice he used to shake the drink in, not even strained over fresh ice I guess when your base clientele is early 20 somethings looking to get hammered (which is cool I've been there myself) drink consistency and proper building techniques don't really matter but it did to me, both drinks looked and tasted like crap.
2021-09-09,2,Horrible service!! Visited the Ainsworth for lunch and we were not greeted by a server for over 15 min. After approaching the host requesting a server a waitress came over and was blatantly rude. We had to stand up and find her anytime we wanted to order food or drinks. Food was average.
2021-09-07,4,It's a reliable spot for good food and good vibes! It's classic American food such as burgers, nachos and tacos, but with an upscale and upbeat vibe with a gorgeous view of the city. It's always my go to on a beautiful sunny day!
2021-09-04,5,Great service! Food was good especially the Mac and Cheese Burger. Noel was our waiter and he was super great!
2021-08-25,5,It was a cute chill spot , the food was great and the drinks hit for sure . Great for a night out on the town
2021-08-22,4,The place is very nice for a night or day out. Staff great.  Food was just ok. The fried mac n cheese app, don't even do it to yourself. Oh the cocktails were heavy on the liquor. I guess that's a bonus.
2021-08-14,3,It's $45 for bottomless brunch on the weekend and it starts at 11 am. I made a reservation online. There's a live DJ. It was really hot inside and my friends and I were sweating. We asked to turn on the fans or the air condition but they said the air condition is only by the bar area. It was uncomfortable. I ordered the loaded skillet and it was pretty pricey for a small amount of food. It was a little greasy too. Overall 3/5 stars because of the uncomfortable environment and okay food. I did enjoy the atmosphere though! Also you'll need to spend a few minutes looking for street parking or you'll have to settle parking in a garage.
2021-08-14,5,The food in this restaurant was unbelievable because when I took that first bite I loved it! The place looked really nice and was really fun 5 stars
2021-08-01,5,The Ainsworth in Hoboken is my new favorite lunch spot. Today was my first time visiting with my family and I was very pleased. The service was fantastic and so was the food. The atmosphere was also very fun with music and a great view of the water. Highly recommend!!
2021-07-20,3,Where do I even begin..... FOOD WAS OK. WAS NOT WORTH THE PRICE! I asked for a ginger ale and Tito's and no joke the whole cup was filled to the brim with Tito's. Also my 16 dollar salad was underwhelming. Come here if you have an heavy wallet...
2021-07-16,4,One of my go-to place in Hoboken for Brunch, happy hour, Lunch or Dinner! They have wide variety of food. It can be your place for a date night, girls brunch or just a happy hour. The ambience has it all. If you are a vegetarian, their black bean burger is one of the BEST!!!!  Definitely worth a try. Pro Tip: If you are going on a date night, do pick their indoor tables, whereas simply going for a brunch try out their outdoor tables. And for happy hour their bar is simply the best as it has a NYC view.
2021-07-08,5,The Ainsworth in Hoboken went above and beyond for my daughters Sweet 16 dinner last night. The food,service and atmosphere was absolutely fabulous. My daughter and her friends had a great time.  We would definitely be going back for dinner. I'd also like to give a big thank you to Haylee for helping us plan out the evening from start to finish. The Ainsworth definitely made this birthday celebration a huge success.
2021-07-06,5,The Ainsoworth in Hoboken is the perfect place to visit for a cute girls date or special occasion. I visited on a Monday and me and my friends were seated quickly at a nice booth table. The place looked so nice inside. Classy yet trendy with the neon sign flower wall. They also have a outdoor seating with a view of the NY skyline. Our waitress was very sweet. She gave exceptional service. We kept asking questions about the drinks and she made sure to double check with the bartender to give us correct info with no hesitation.We ended up ordering the biggest pitcher of "The Whole Pineapple" which is a coconut, pineapple, and rum drink. It tasted just like a Piña Colada! So if you like those definitely go for that. We were told the bartender can put any cocktails in a pitcher and the bigger pitcher size is $65. It served me and my 3 friends 2 glasses each. As for my entree I ordered the Pesto Grilled Chicken sandwich. It was DELICIOUS. The ciabatta bread was so soft and tasty. The chicken was cooked just right and the arugula and mozzarella made the taste even better. The pesto was also so good. It was my first time trying a sandwich with pesto and I definitely need to go back for it. My other friend ordered the same as me while the other two ordered the Classic Burger and Short Rib Grilled Cheese. We all devoured our food. 10/10!The prices were pretty average. $40 per person. The experience at The Ainsworth was all around perfect. Will be returning.
2021-06-26,1,Made a reservation and was asked table preferences. Indoor or Oudoor? I chose outdoor, arrived at the restaurant a few minutes  before my reservation and saw two tables outside, assuming one was for my party of four. After giving our name to the host, she grabs menus and walks to an indoor table. I then tell her the reservation was for outside and she tells me that outdoor tables are first come first serve! Okay well if that's the case we were the only ones there and why give an option when making to the reservation to sit outdoor or indoor if it's not really an option after all??? We were just hungry so didn't even matter at this point. We sit down and notice the restaurant has no air conditioning. We are all sweating and someone comes over to serve water. I grab my glass because it's so hot in the restaurant and need something cold to drink and the water is room temperature, really?? We then order appetizers and got the Ainsworth buffalo wings, which were surprisingly pretty good. Also ordered the Buffalo cauliflower, let me say it was awful! Literally cauliflower with hot sauce drizzled on it, that's it! No seasoning, batter, nothing! Just Gross! Then i order the fried chicken pepper jack cheese sandwich. I could not even bite through the chicken it was so hard. I literally feel like my tooth is loose after trying to take a bite out of that sandwich! Really awful experience and will never come back! The waitress was nice but the bus girl (well not really a girl but older woman) kept coming over removing dishes from our table. But she kept coming back, taking glasses, silverware. It was super awkward as if we were being rushed. Honestly I couldn't wait to leave that hot box of a restaurant but someone in my party placed a to go order so we were waiting forever on the order. Come to find out the waitress forgot about the order and in the mean time everything including silverware down to the napkins were removed from our table rushing us to leave even though the restaurant wasn't busy at all. Save yourself a trip and don't go here, so many better places to eat in Hoboken!
2021-06-20,4,Pricey food, excellent service, generous portions, expensive cocktails and a pleasant atmosphere.
2021-06-18,5,Great food, service & music.. Great location by the water, but minimal parking (suggest taking an Uber)
2021-06-16,1,Unfortunately we tried to make a reservation for 10 girls on a weekday at 2:30 for lunch. Their policy is that parties over 8 are subject to a minimum $50 a person. This is disgusting. I've heard of this for dinner at certain restaurants but never breakfast and lunch. Most salads and burgers are $15-17. If I ordered a salad and an app I would have to pay $50 while the person next to our table pays off the menu. They then proceeded to justify the charge assuming that we would have cocktails. This is an absolute disappointment. I will never go back to this establishment or at any of their locations.
2021-06-14,5,My friend and I came here for some food and drinks after work and had the best time! Alex was super friendly and took care of everything we needed! We had the short rib grilled cheese and wings and everything was delicious!! Can't wait to come back here and visit Alex and this menu again!
2021-05-24,2,Highly overrated. This place does business because of the location to the waterfront. However, even so, the prices are entirely inflated, and the food is average. I went for dinner Saturday evening two weeks ago, and the service was awful. The waiter gave everyone at our table about four ounces of water, and we had to beg to get refills. Eighteen dollars for chips and guac, give me a break. The braised rib tacos were decent, but our entire table was disappointed on so many levels. Way too many good restaurants in Hoboken to choose from,Short Rib Tacos and I won't be running back anytime soon.
2021-05-16,4,So the food is amazing!!!  Absolute best burger in Hoboken.But I do have one complaint.  I asked the waiter for the check and he asked me if I wanted another drink.  I said no thank you just the check please.  Then he said "are you sure?"  I honestly found this to be incredibly pushy.  I get that waiters don't make much money and do have to rely on tips, but don't push it when someone says they don't want another drink.  I will come back because the food is great but hopefully I'll have another waiter.
2021-05-07,1,All I can say is this was absolutely one of the WORST dining experiences I have ever had. Our server was missing the entire night... It took him 15-20 minutes to drop off water...I tried  to order while he was putting the water down but he ignored me and walked away. Finally was able to order my drink but he wasn't the one to drop it off & the server who dropped it off said she couldn't take my order... At this point we ended up moving inside because it got very cold outside. Unfortunately we had the same server who was outside as well. He finally came by our table probably 15 minutes later to take our appetizer order and my friends drink order. After the Appetizers  arrived, we didn't have any share plates, utensils or napkins & had to ask our food runner to get it for us.. We finished our appetizers and the server was still nowhere to be found to take our entrée orders...he finally shows up after about 15 minutes (shocker). We are finally ordering our entree's & I had asked him if I could substitute asparagus for mashed potatoes for the chicken entrée (simple?...right?...NOPE), he told me no I can't substitute & also told me my dish would take 45 minutes for this chicken to cook. (Why so long?)...So i had to order the tacos instead so I can get my food faster. In the middle of us eating our entree's, we were trying to find our server to order a second round of drinks but he never showed up. Luckily, the busser was nice enough to keep refilling our water all night and grab us more napkins. We also had to ask our busser to find our server after our meal so we could get our check... It took another 15 minutes to get the check & it was also not dropped off by our server... Funny thing is as soon as our credit cards went in the checkbook our server popped out to run our cards...But we did not get our cards back for about 10 minutes... Terrible service... Overpriced and overall just a bad dining experience. Basically if you're not white...they will ignore you. COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!!!
2021-05-04,2,On a beautiful tuesday day in may, we decided to eat at the ainsworth hoboken for a friends birthday. The waiter was not my favorite and to top it all off, they were incapable of making a plain pizza. They had pepperoni pizza, but no plain. How does this make sense? Especially when both were on the menu. Service was definitely subpar to say the least. Food...average. However, one of the bus boys was great and acted as the saving grace for the meal. The guac as well, helped save the experience.
2021-04-25,3,Decided to give this place a try after seeing it on Tik tok. The location and view was beautiful. However the service was very bad. My and my 2 girl friends had reservation for 8:30. When we arrived the waiter said there's no available seats when half the tables were empty. After finally being seated we decided to start with the calamari. It wasn't too bad but needed for seasoning. I got the Mac and cheese burger which was a little too dry for my liking so I asked for ketchup and Mayo....but it never came. My girl friend got a side of Mac and cheese which was good and gooey. My other friend got the hanger steak burger which actually was the best thing out of everything. Very juicy and spicy. Overall I wouldn't come back for food maybe for drinks.
2021-04-20,3,I went here on Taco Tuesday. The fish tacos was okay, however the print on the menu in reference to Taco Tuesday is very misleading. Also for the price of the drinks, it wasn't much of a buzz. The waiter didn't check on us all night. We had to ask for a fork and napkins, after waiting for a while. At the end, the waiter offered to call a manager, yet the manager never came. I will say that my mate enjoyed the mac n cheese burger.
2021-04-18,5,Stopped by for pre-lunch cocktails on a Saturday afternoon. They were busy but still had enough seats available to avoid a wait, we sat outside. My friend got the rose sangria and i got the Roosevelt. The cocktails mostly seemed like sweet drinks but I was happy with mine. A lot of pineapple options right now. Drinks are pricier at $16 and I ended up getting 2. Waiter was attentive and nice. The food menu was tempting but we had reservations elsewhere.
2021-04-10,3,My mom and I went outdoor dining here in the middle of a Saturday. We didn't have reservation but we were still seated right away. All the windows of the restaurant were open, so we were able to view the TV screens from outside and hear loud, club type music and loud ass drunk young women, who were screaming on and off during their time there, that was coming from indoors. I have never been to any restaurant in my life that was as loud as this one, which is saying a lot because we were sitting outside! The music was really good, but I think it was too clubby for the ambience. The ambience indoors was really nice. I got to see the inside because I had to go to bathroom, which was somewhat dark inside. The whole restaurant is somewhat dark inside, but the dark furniture is nice and the open, wide space inside looks great. I gotta reiterate that the groups of very young women, some who look barely legal in terms of drinking age, were loud af! One of them came out of the restaurant really drunk! It kills the vibe. Maybe they should go to Madd Hatter instead. For the food- I ordered the turkey burger with asparagus. The asparagus costs $9 as a side by itself but I was able to substitute fries that the burger comes with with asparagus for only $3 more. The asparagus was fresh and delicious. However, the turkey patty seemed like it was made with bread mixed together with ground turkey, onion, and other ingredients. It didn't even taste like a turkey patty. It tasted good but I stopped eating it in case it wasn't gluten free. My mom got the brick pressed chicken, which she said was good. The food somewhat took a long time to come out and our server took the receipt and credit card from the table super quick. My mom didn't get a chance to explain to him that we wanted to split bill, so everything winded up being charged to my mom's card. I would come here again, but to try food indoors during off-peak hours. I don't want to get a headache nor COVID-19 from the loud mouths!
2021-04-07,1,Terrible experience. We drove an hour to eat here based on a recommendation from a friend. Upon entering the hostess brought our group of 4 to a table with 3 chairs and walked away. The manager got us a new chair and then we sat... for 30 min without any wait staff coming to our table. The table next to us sat down 10 min later and was met with water and served drinks. I then decided to try and discuss this issue with the "manager" who said "we can serve you now". He offered no apology or acknowledgement of this issue. He then proceeded to put his hands on me while in conversation and when I asked him to please not touch me, he then stormed off and said he didn't care if we left. This is inexcusable behavior from managerial staff. The restaurant had several open tables and was not busy at all. I would NEVER frequent this establishment ever again. I would give 0 stars if I could.
2021-03-30,1,Horrible service, bad drinks. It was self seating but there no indication and it appear that one server is handling 8 tables.
2021-03-22,5,great outdoor dining available! tasty food, great service. very clean and covid conscious!
2021-03-08,2,Didn't eat there, just went for drinks on a Sunday with 5 people (one other showed up a little late for one drink). Did nit mention gratuity was included (and WHY would we think it's included if it's a small party getting drinks). So we paid and then gave a cash tip (of 20%) so they basically got $80 tip on $190 worth of drinks. Never had to bring anything to the table but 3 rounds of drinks. We may have even said "keep it!" But it def felt sketchy when we left snd I def won't be going back. Then I had to "report" that I showed up for my reservation via open table because they marked me as a "no show" (eye roll). Sorry, I know it's COVID and I get everyone is doing the best they can and we are always tipping more these days, but again felt a little bamboozled. They should DEF mention gratuity is included as it was never for something like this before.
2021-03-07,1,Would be hesitant if booking for a party of more than 12 people. I booked the back room which was supposed to be more private and signed a credit card authorized form to lock this in. On the day of my event, I received a call "letting me know" that they would need to move my party 1 hour into my reservation to another table. They never apologized and acted as this was acceptable, at this point we couldn't find another reserve for our large group anymore so needed to use the ainsworth. This was extremely disappointing as the regular table we were sat at was in the middle of the restaurant and I wasn't able to talk to half of my party that traveled in for my birthday. Very unprofessionally handled in my opinion.
2021-02-16,5,Thankful that this venue was in full operation during Covid. I believe the temperature was about 20 degrees then night we visited so dining in was a treat for sure. The food was deliciously and the drinks were made evenly.  Shout out to the manager who grabbed us a table right in the midst of all the activities that was going on. There were a few sporting games on the television and the UFC fight. This was a great evening as there were so many things happening at once, you know? Something most of us haven't experienced in quite some time. Ainsworth offers a great dining experience, complimented with a sporty but cozy environment and solid drinks. You all should def come through here. Oh and the female bartender with the pink mask is stunning. Say hello to her for me if y'all see her. 5 stars.
2021-02-09,4,Ambiance 5 star ! Drinks 3 star ! Food 4 and half star ! Good place to go for date and special occasion.
2021-02-02,3,The experience was amazing, however those gold wings were not what I expected.  Based upon what I read, I was expecting savory, buttery coconut garlic flavor.  Instead it was more on the bland side.  Apart from that awesome experience.
2021-01-31,4,Came here for Sunday brunch. We had a reservation for 11am and were seated right away. There was good music playing and had no problem talking over it. Server was attentive and friendly. We ordered the supreme nachos as an appetizer which we enjoyed. Entres came soon after. French toast was yummy as were the chicken quesadillas. Portion sizes were decent. Prices were moderate but I guess ok considering the area. Wish French toast came with a side. Overall we enjoyed the vibe, drinks and food and would return in the future!
2021-01-24,1,Came here tonight w my husband. The host who's name is Alex told us there was only one seat available (in the corner by the entrance). We politely told him we didn't want to sit there. He proceeded to tell us that there was an hour wait for another table. We browsed the restaurant and realized there were several seats that we could be seated at but he obviously did not want us there. Before we left, my husband asked for his name and he responded by saying "don't worry about my name". I'm honestly very disappointed as this was a special night.
2020-12-19,1,This was absolutely the most horrendous experience I have ever had!!! I went out with my sister and a couple of her friends for her birthday dinner. We made reservations at 8:30 PM which were taken for a party of seven. The waitress was very nasty and inattentive . When we made the reservation we understood the curfew in place for covid. The waitress took our order very late which contributed to why we could not have dessert. The waitress never came back to ask us if we needed anything and we missed singing to my sister . There was no "last call " given. We expressed our concerns to the waitress and she was unapologetic making excuses which were invalid. We talked to the manager who was WORSE than the waitress !!! He started a conversation with someone else as we voiced our concerns. Just because a bunch of "young girls" are complaining doesn't mean you don't take it seriously. If you're going to use Covid as an excuse make sure you all wear your masks appropriately and don't hang on each other inappropriately .
2020-11-22,5,HIGHLY recommend the red sangria pitcher, it's huge and tastes delicious!! Can be split amongst 3 people. Also stick to the burgers or salads (they're big) - I got the short rib tacos and while delicious, I left hungry. The manager guy (?) who sits by the hostess station was somewhat annoying and we wound up having to move tables halfway through our meal to a different section because he didn't quite know what he was doing. Nobody helped us move our pitcher and plates to the other table either... not a big deal, just slightly annoying However the servers are awesome and what keep us coming back. They don't hound you/ let you enjoy your meal there which is rare for such a busy place. There is a server whose name I forgot to get, she's short and looks Hispanic - we love her!!Indoor and outdoor seating available!
2020-11-21,1,Terrible experience. Waited 3 hours for my brunch and received the wrong order. The waiter, Luis, challenged me and rather than getting the manager involved, who ended up being useless, got into a heated argument with me.Would not recommend to anyone
2020-11-21,1,Worst experience I've had in Hoboken. Took over 2 hours to get our food with no apology and the wrong order. We complained and the waiter started yelling at us again with no apology and no money off the bill. Will not be returning.
2020-11-10,3,This place is good for brunch. They have a brunch package where you get a brunch entree of your choice + a champagne bottle for each person. This definitely does the job. The food is mediocre not so great and so is the service.
2020-10-17,4,Great spot by the water. Menu is extensive. Tried their vegetarian pizza and it wasn't bad.
2020-10-12,5,Sat outside for a covid experience. Service was somewhat slow but that was nice for outdoor enjoyment. I had a burger and it was everything I forgot a burger should taste like- it was juicy, fresh toppings, delicious bun. The fries were perfectly crispy. I went inside to use the bathroom and was shocked how full the inside was in covid times but had felt safe outside.
2020-10-11,1,Worst service and they do not respect covid rules at all.  The staff did not wear mask and most that did wore them incorrectly even when handling food. They brought our food to the wrong table and then attempted to give it to us, off of someone else's table. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone at all. The music and atmosphere is really nice and upbeat but if you care about your health and eating Pass...there's lots of restaurants in the area.
2020-10-09,1,I'llGo with 1 star for now.  I have not yet dined in at Ainsworth in Hoboken  as of yet. The reason for the 1 star is I've been calling this number for over a week to make reservations for over 6 people.  Anytime you call this number is says mailbox is full. So you can't even leave a message for someone to call you back to make a reservation. I guess I'll stick with my online reservation and hopefully when our party gets there they can accommodate us ???? Hopefully
2020-10-03,5,Had brunch there outside overlooking the Manhattan skyline on a beautiful fall day.  Best huevos rancheros ever!  Would highly recommend for the view and for the food.  Very reasonable champagne brunch special.
2020-09-30,3,The food was excellent and our waitress was fabulous. I was not a fan of the very slow service. It was a busy night, but the hostess was inattentive and on her phone the entire time. We waited an hour to sit just for the service to still be slow. The women's bathroom was also filthy. The person bussing tables also seemed to have an attitude. Almost seemed as if they were understaffed and under a lot of pressure. I would go again but on a slower day, and during the day. Again, the food was excellent and our waitress was a sweetheart. Food was 5 stars, the service was 3
2020-09-26,1,Unreal. Rude. Good luck surviving in this pandemic. There for less than 3 minutes and walked out. Where they find the incredibly unprofessional people that work here is a mystery. I'll take my money to the hundreds of other restaurants that appreciate my business. Funny how Yelp won't let me post this negative review...
2020-09-22,1,Had brunch there last weekend. The bloody Mary was the worst I've ever had in my life. Basically dirty water and very cheap vodka. The celery in it was dirty and had mold on it. The loaded skillet, highly recommended by the waitress, was literally disgusting: raw potatoes and very fatty sausage covered in cheese. Waste of money and time.
2020-09-13,1,My boyfriend and I ordered food from our waitress and waited almost an hour. We only seen our waitress twice. When we sat down and the second when I went to go get her myself. Then when they did bring the food out they brought my food and not my boyfriends. I guess to compensate they gave us a house shot and also took a lot off our bill. I thought the Ainsworth In Newark was trash but this one is just as bad. I don't recommend coming here. Annnnddd their mimosas are $15 you're kidding right ? For a small ass cup
2020-09-12,5,Cannot say enough about how amazing this place is. The food, the service, the atmosphere were all outstanding. I will be back in the VERY near future.
2020-09-11,1,I understand we are in a pandemic. But when going to a restaurant you shouldn't have to wait. 25 minutes for a server to even come to the table. We didn't get water. We waited another 15 minutes for our drinks and I had to ask for water then. When  we finally got our food. We had no silverware or napkins. They brought all our food at once. The appetizer of nachos was burnt, and the cheese was hard and congealed like it's been sitting under a heat lamp too long. The short rib tacos were cold too. The wait staff was short staffed it appeared.  . But it didn't stop them from allowing more and more tables to come  in. Every table was either waiting for a long time for food or for their check. It was a complete mess! I understand it's hard right now for restaurants. I worked as a server over 11 years myself. But People want to enjoy their time out too. And for the money they charge. It shouldn't suck this much! My server said she wasn't our server, that she was just helping out. So I'm not sure who my server was.. The most atrocious part was they changed my tip amount on my credit card. That is illegal and I will never go there again. I absolutely reported this to my credit card company.
2020-09-06,1,Food here is horrible. Definitely microwaved. Even the stake looked was left over from different plate and was put together and microwaved. It's obvious they know about it too and just don't care. They make you order full entries to even have one drink.
2020-08-03,4,My friend invited me to dine out in this area off the Hudson and we ate here. We were lucky their kitchen was still open after 10pm. The host was great. We had to wear our masks to approach him of course and to order at the bar inside. We ordered mild buffalo wings for appetizer and the pesto chicken sandwich. Omg guys, the pesto sandwich was so amazing! I hadn't had one in a while. The wings were dry so don't recommend.
2020-08-03,1,The hostess on 08/01/2020 (dinner) was extremely rude with an attitude. She was NOT wearing a mask (unsafe during the Covid lockdown) and never called me to let me know my table was ready even though I put my name and phone number down and was promised a call back in max 1 hour. Won't try this stinky place again. Hoboken Waterfront has way more beautiful and fun places to try.
2020-07-20,1,If I could give 0 stars I would. I have not been this disappointed with staff, experience and food, ever. This is the worst management I ever came across. Where do I even begin with this review? I understand it's pandemic times and I personally have been a server and a bartender before so I am very familiar with how restaurants work. Upon being seated and given a menu, I ordered a cocktail off the menu and was told that they only have one out of the 5 drinks offered. Which is fine and I settled for the one they had which was a mango margarita. I was in a group of 5, and two gentlemen ordered beer. The server came back and said they are out of all except  2. One gentleman settled for what was available the other passed. We ordered a juice, they came back and said they are all out of those.. We came here specifically for the 24k gold wings, and have had them at the other two Ainsworth locations. We ordered 20, the brick chicken, a vegetarian pizza and a side of Mac and cheese. The server came back 5 minutes later and said they only have pepperoni pizza. Which for me is not ok as I am allergic.. I passed on the pizza and made sure that the server knew we came here for the wings and if those are out she needs to let us know now. She said that she already put them in and they are available. As we wait for our order, the cook came out and brings 6 wings barely dusted in gold out... SIX. He apologized and said that's all they had as they had a party the night before. Now mind you remember I asked the server about them? About the 20 wings we came here specifically for? Well apparently now they don't have any and we were not told ahead of time. The cook did say he won't charge us for them, and of course I wouldn't expect to pay for some half done wings. Then the brick chicken came out which was the only thing on the menu that came out right. Bottom line is the management is terrible. Why are these things still on the menu and not crossed out or why have the servers not been told that those items are out? They came back FIVE DIFFERENT TIMES to tell us they are out of what we ordered. I will never be back to this location, I am surprised they are still open to be honest.
2020-07-03,1,***COVID REVIEW***We went to Ainsworth on a Thursday before a holiday weekend. It did not go well. Our first suspect encounter was with the drink menu. The drink menu showed a "special" - six random cocktails. Buy ALL SIX for $75. If you bought the six cocktails separately, they would probably each be $12, at best. 12*6 = 72. Not 75. That's not a deal. Additionally, you couldn't order any of those 6 drinks unless you bought them all together. We ordered our cocktails (electric lemonade for me, old fashioned for my fiancé). The lemonade was super sour, like it had been sitting for many days. My fiancé's old fashioned was mostly grenadine. For apps, we ordered the buffalo cauliflower.  Before the app came out our waitress came to take our dinner order. They've removed most of their good sandwiches and burgers from the menu (for now, I hope) so, we ordered the skirt steaks. Shortly thereafter our server brought out our packaged plasticware utensils. When our cauliflower arrived it looked as though it had been microwaved and tossed in buffalo sauce. It was served in a to go container.When our steaks came, they were overcooked. Also in a to go container. We had to beg the runner to bring us steak knives and even they couldn't cut through the steak. We asked for our check and left. The next day, we both did not feel well! Disappointing experience overall. If Ainsworth wants to stick with to go style everything, they should shorten their menu to apps, burgers, and sandwiches or at least notify guests they'll only get plasticware and all dishes are served in to go containers.
2020-06-26,2,I live a few blocks away and have been here a few times over the years. Nice beer selection and now they are apparently doing drinks to go. I walked by at 1pm this past Tuesday and Wednesday hoping to find a seat. However, both days I see the same packed crowd and same servers without any sort of face covering. Not even around their chin, just nonexistent. This is unsafe and going to cause spikes in Hoboken. Where is Management at this point?
2020-06-06,1,Stopped by to get couple to-go drinks. The drinks were already made in plastic bottles. No issue there. Pandemic going on, we understand. The very pricey drinks we got had not a hint of alcohol. Felt very taken advantage of. Will not be going back.
2020-03-14,3,Came here on a whim as it was right at the Hoboken Waterfront Walkway. It was right across the street from the water and had amazing views of the city and it's skyline. We walked in to look at the menu and were sat at a table to the bar area. The dining room has a completely different vibe to it than the bar area and I very much liked where we sat better. I noticed there was a happy hour section on the menu and asked for the happy hour wine and our server who was also the host mentioned that happy hour is only at the bar but that they'd make an exception which was nice. My friend ordered the sliders, only meat and cheese and I ordered the beef nachos. The sliders only came with 2 sliders and of course had lettuce, tomorrow etc on it but it's not a huge deal. My nachos came basically naked (just chips, beef and jalepenos) and with everything on the side which I've never really seen before but that's ok it was very good anyways. Service was good, attentive and fast. 1 glass of happy  hour wine, the nachos and sliders came to $36. Overall everything was good, probably nothing to write home about. I would come back if in the area, but would definitely sit in the bar area because I didn't super love the vibe in the dining room. Email: diningwithpyt@gmail.com.  IG: @diningwithpyt
2020-03-01,1,Tried this place for brunch today for the first time and I can't say I was impressed. Food took a very long time to get to us, and when it did, it was cold. the biscuit I ordered was hard as a rock and inedible. It tasted like a bad version of a pillsbury biscuit cut from a tube. My sausage tasted like it had gone bad. I hardly ate a thing. I told the waitress how bad my food was, and didn't send it back initially cause I was starving and didn't want to wait an additional long time for something else. She told the manager, who instead of doing the right thing and comping my meal or offering something else, took 20% off. Really? Such bad business. We will never be back. Expensive, bad food, slow service and poor management. With so many other choices in Hoboken, don't bother wasting your time or money.
2020-02-25,3,Not as great as I remember. The locations in the city are a bit more up-scale. I would consider this an upscale dive bar. Waitstaff was wearing sweatshirts and leggings, no host working, mediocre service. The food runner was the nicest person I interacted with and he brought me silverware because I was never given any prior to my food arriving. Food was just ok- tacos good and asparagus soggy and a bit brown. With all the options in Hoboken, I probably wouldn't return.
2020-02-24,5,Such an amazing experience here. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. We went for brunch and I got the egg white omelette which was delicious. We all did the brunch entree and Prosecco bottle which each person had their own bottle!!! So much fun. Will definitely be back. Definitely recommend making a reservation especially on a weekend during brunch time!
2020-02-23,3,The food was good no complaints there, but service was lacking. The restaurant was pretty empty but it took our server a very long time to come check on us at any point even when we hadn't ordered yet. Additionally they brought us our check without confirming we were done eating.
2020-02-16,4,Came for brunch and we were "the last table seated for the day" at 12:30 PM and the restaurant was empty. Confusing. But the food was delicious and the mimosas were cheap and good.  I loved the skillet!
2020-02-05,4,Came here with some coworkers after a tough day at work, and really needed a good meal. My coworkers ordered some cocktails(I'm lame ). They all agreed that the cocktails were to die for! After seeing the reviews we were all a little skeptical, but I went for the filet and everyone told me not to do it. Our service at first was sus let me tell  ya but once our servers got warmed up you could say so did the food! So the filet arrives and after my coworkers made fun of me MULTIPLE people wanted a bite, which I happily obliged. Overall a charming night with my pals!
2020-02-02,2,We had a reservation here Saturday for a party of 15. Food and drinks were good, but the service not so much. Our waitress was nowhere to be found most of the time. While some of us were mid-eating the manager told us we had to leave because there was another reservation that specifically needed our table. The waiters all of a sudden had no problem coming by to take our plates when we weren't even done eating. This was for a birthday.... we did not have dessert and were in no way compensated for basically being kicked out. Won't be back!
2020-02-02,4,Had a great time with some friends at the Ainsworth the other night. We all ordered a couple of drinks and some tacos. I opted for the short rib tacos and they were delicious! They come with avocado and fried onions. The portion was enough to feel full, but not uncomfortably stuffed. For my cocktail, I went with the Hemingway, which had rum, raspberries, mint, and lime. It was incredible. I would drink that everyday if I could (I may learn how to make it just so I can...  yes, that good!). After that I switch to a beer, because $14 per cocktail can get pricey. Overall, I liked the atmosphere, our service left more to be desired (we waited quite a while for the hostess to return to the front to seat us and then for quite some time for our drinks and food), and the food and drinKs really hit the spot. Side note: on the weekends, the parking situation is terrible. Come prepared to pay upwards of  $30 to park in a nearby garage.
2020-01-27,1,The noise level in this restaurant is so high that my ears were ringing hours after I left.  The food was decent but not good enough to endure the noise.  I don't know why anyone would put up with it.  You can't have a conversation with the people you're with.
2020-01-26,5,I have been here twice for brunch and both times have been great. The brunch package was great. Each person gets a bottle of sparkling wine and an entree item. The waitress brought over one bottle at a time for us and it worked out great. On my first visit I ordered the stuffed French toast. It was delicious. It wasn't too sweet. On the second  visit it ordered the loaded skillet and it was cooked perfectly.
2019-12-23,3,Came here for Sunday night dinner with 5 friends. Prior to dinner, we came to the bar for a drink. I kid you not, we waited 10 min before WE ASKED the bartender to take our order (there were only 5 other people at the bar). The house drinks were $10- average. The house whiskey was not great at all- I do not recommend it. For dinner we ordered around 8:30pm because the kitchen was taking orders up until 8:45pm. I liked that there were a couple of vegetarian options here. I ordered the chopped vegetable salad with a side of yucca fries. This salad was so flavorful and fulfilling! The oregano vinaigrette was to die for!!! I also loved how the yucca fries didn't taste frozen and heated up- seemed pretty fresh! Overall good experience for food but not so much for the bar. Would come back again.
2019-12-18,5,Went with a group of friends for a birthday and the food was great atmosphere was nice, not too crowded.
2019-11-03,1,I've been waiting for brunch for an hour.... and I've been told the food will be out in 2 minutes twice now.
2019-10-28,4,Some of the best burgers in hoboken! If you go, also make sure to get the Mac and cheese fries- almost a combo between mozz sticks and deep fried Mac and cheese. It doesn't disappoint!
2019-10-13,1,First time I went for brunch, place wasn't crowded at all and service was still slow. I had to check with staff few times for 30-35mins. Went there again second time few weeks later and found pieces of glass in food. Showed it to staff they were very rude and not ready to do anything about it. Never going here again!
2019-09-30,3,This was my first experience here, as I was visiting from out of town. We had an 8pm reservation on a Saturday night.The food was great, the service at the host stand was great as well, very friendly and welcoming. The service once we got to the table was a huge disappointment. I normally would try to give restaurants and servers the benefit of the doubt and say, "It was a Saturday night and they were busy," but they weren't extremely busy that night, especially past 9pm. It took 20+ minutes to get our drinks; the waitress only took drink orders from 2 of the 4 people at the table to start (her only taking a few drink orders without asking everyone at the table continued throughout the night), then did a poor job of checking in. We finished our first round of drinks and had to hunt her down after sitting drink-less for quite some time to order more. After we got our food, she did not come back to check in on us, and did not bring us our check, so after sitting for 30 minutes past completing our meal, we got up and asked someone up front for the check.All in all, disappointing service-wise. The food was good, however.
2019-09-13,3,Food is decent-we stick with what we know-mac and cheese burger and apple poppy salad. Service is always hit or miss. Drinks are good. Music is always way tooo loud so we only eat here in the summer when we can sit outside and not get a migraine from the blasting bumping music at 6pm. The attitude of the servers and hostess are awful. On multiple occasions when we've eaten here they roll their eyes and act like youre bothering them when you ask for a table. Ive asked for tables outside and they always say "its full" but yet I point out empty ones that need to be turned over and they then go clean one. I don't get it. In all decent food but I don't go out of my way to eat here bc of the service.
2019-09-08,1,Went to the Ainsworth for a surprise party. Bartender that attended us from 12-3 was one of the rudest bartenders I've ever experienced. Had zero enthusiasm to serve us. Woman who was the bar manager (wearing a purple and maroon flannel) was condescending and rude and visibly speaking about our party for the entire three hours we were there. Will never plan/attend another gathering at the Ainsworth again.
2019-09-04,5,Lovely setting over looking Manhattan.  Food was delicious and great selection.  Lauren provided us with the kindest service.
2019-09-02,2,The only thing of three appetizers worth getting are the wings.  Ordered some sliders, bland and cold with a bun that was larger than the beef so sent it back for nachos with beef.  The nachos are average but don't spend the extra $5 on the beef because Jets just ground beef with no seasoning or flavor. The waitress was nice to take my order back.
2019-08-30,4,Had dinner here with some out of town friend COMPLETELY by accident I gave bad directions and found this place in staid PLEASANTLY surprise and happy with food drinks, ambiance and staff!
2019-08-24,1,Came in here on a Saturday afternoon for a drink. We sat at the bar. Awful service and even worse music. The bartender looked like he had better things to do, and we had to ask three times for a soda. The music selection tries to make this place "young" but at the bar were nothing but 40 somethings. Any good manager/owner would not stand for this and could whip this place into shape. The one star is only for the potential this place has. Needless to say, I will not be back!
2019-08-10,5,Loved this place for HH. The drinks were cheap and strong. The bartender, Juan was amazing! Had a great time even as it got a bit louder and busier. The setting is classy but fun. Enjoyed the music they played as well, will be back to try some of the food soon!
2019-08-03,2,Came here for lunch. Not much to say. Food was good. Music was loud. Interior was nice. Service was slow. Water was warm. Location was near the boardwalk and parking. That's it.
2019-07-27,4,The Ainsworth is a good spot for large groups/parties as there's a large dining area with room to accommodate lots of people. The food is pretty typical American, I got the turkey burger and added feta cheese to it. The flavor of the burger was good but the bun was pretty dry, I ended up taking it off. What I wish I had ordered for my meal were the wings. We got some for an appetizer and those were really good. Highly recommend the wings. And not the $50-1000 gold wings lol. Just the standard, normal wings were fantastic.
2019-07-23,3,The Ainsworh. Average place with average food. All was well I just feel like the price was not worth the food. If your looking fo an upscale bar this is the place for you. I'm pretty sure the price was because of the location.
2019-07-20,1,Terrible. Terrible terrible terrible. I ordered the famous Mac and cheese burger, disgusting. No salt, the bun was hard, the Mac and cheese had no flavor. Fries were madddd salty. Not to mention. Terrible customer service. Didn't ask me how the food was. Gave me the wrong drink. They seemed like they didn't want to be there. Made me feel very uncomfortable. Don't bother coming. Wish I could give this zero stars. Highly disappointed.
2019-07-15,4,Came here Thursday night and we ordered the French Onion Soup burger (yum!) and upgraded our fries to the truffle fries. The burger was perfect. The truffle fries were a miss. But it's ok. We ordered drinks too. Some beer and sampled other which were delicious! There was a mango beer that was fantastic! Also tried the organic cucumber mule which I LOVED.. ordered it again. Also tried the crooked knife. Spicy and delicious too! Mike is an excellent bartender!!! Top notch service here at the bar! We met the owner Mike too, great guy! Definitely recommend trying this place out for both food and drinks! Stop in and see Mike the bartender too, and you won't be disappointed!
2019-07-11,1,Very long story short. I came on Taco Tuesday and ordered a margarita with a family friend - hers was fine, mine was "accidentally" made with jalapeño spicy tequila. What. It tasted like buffalo sauce and was revolting. Okay, that's fine, whatever right? Got another one free of charge (which didn't come until my friend got her second drink about 20 minutes later) - it was great until I got a piece of glass in my mouth with the ice. I didn't realize it was glass until I crunched on it, thinking it was ice. It was GLASS. I told the waitress and she was very kind and understanding and she got the manager on duty (I think that's what he was) and he apologized but literally told me that "unfortunately this is a busy establishment and it happens all the time." First of all, that shouldn't be happening all the time. Second of all, that's unacceptable. He gave us 50% off of the bill, but that meal should have been covered if I'm literally crunching on glass. The only thing that made my night was Cory, a local person that apparently comes for karaoke every Tuesday and he was hilarious.
2019-07-04,5,I was recommended by my cousin and it was good we ordered the turkey burger, classic burger, NY cheesecake, and a flatbread
2019-07-04,1,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. I was looking forward to coming here, I live in Los Angeles, and came to New York / New Jersey for the Fourth of July. We arrived here at exactly 11, I had a reservation at 11:15. When I walked in no hostess, no server, just the bartender. He then proceeds to tell me that they don't open until 11:30.  Bad start. Why on earth would they take a phone in reservation at 11:15 if they didn't open till 11:30? Anywho, my friend and I with our luggage from our flight still , wait outside. Only to see a group of 5 be seated right after. That's strike two. We go ahead walk in, and find a seat. The server, Melanie seemed unenthused to greet and help us. She took 25 minutes to bring out our drinks, she got my friends order wrong, and just didn't seem to care much. Overall, the drinks were decent, and so was the food. But when the service doesn't meet the standards that you're expecting, especially after hearing great things, really makes the experience overall disappointing, and not worth the time nor the money.
2019-07-03,1,This is how my fish tacos arrived via takeout. I've tried calling the restaurant and the delivery service and no one will return my calls. I also should have never tried eating one of these because I've been sick ever since.
2019-06-30,5,man oh man...the mac and cheese  hamburger!!! come hungry...very hungry  i suggest....leave happy....extremely happy!!Vegans stay out of this...lol.This was the. most filling tasty satisfying burger  i have ever had. Jackson Hole and Fuddruckers come close..smash burger too..but the bun toasted to perfection  here at this restaurant and the mac and cheese  and an onion ring atop this juicy burger is sure  to  satisfy.I Recommend a draft beer to  go long with  it Heineken  Blue moon etc.The restaurant itself is great  especially with the hudson river and view of manhattan right outside your window(you have the option to dine outdoors as well). The burger of course comes with fries and the  restaurant has pretty good music playing all the while. to go to the beautiful  park and see manhattan all lit up and stroll through the park after going to this restaurant is the perfect combination.I highly recommend this restaurant and especially this dish...bon apetit.
2019-06-29,2,It is shocking how slow this place is. My coworkers and I have come to lunch here before and the service is always SO SLOW. Each time we've been here, the entire restaurant is empty, but yet we have to wait a few minutes to be seated. It takes 10-15 minutes to receive your drink order, much longer to receive food, and in general long to get just about anything. There is not much special about the food. The truffle fries are good, but everything else is just about average. If you're going to come for lunch on a week day be prepared to wait a lot and spend a long time.
2019-06-25,4,When my go to Hoboken brunch spot was fully booked I made a reservation at Ainsworth and was pleasantly surprised! 4 of us did the brunch special for $35 including an entree and bottle of champagne per person! Although they were not busy service was pretty slow and refilling our drinks required a pretty long wait. I had the Mac and cheese burger and although I thought it might be a cheesy overload it was actually completely delicious! I chose to upgrade my fries to truffle and it was worth it. An unexpectedly good brunch!
2019-06-23,4,Came for brunch on a Sunday after making a reservation--drinks took a while to come out, but after they did the rest of the service was pretty speedy. All three of us dining got sandwiches after our waitress helped with recommendations and they were pretty good, nothing to write home about. Overall, would definitely dine here again--hopefully at a table outside next time so we can enjoy the gorgeous view!
2019-06-18,3,The location makes this awesome, right by the water front and if you sit outside, you have an amazing view of Manhattan Skyline. The weather was amazing and we got lucky they had an outside option. The food a bit lackluster. We ordered the nachos and all the toppings was just basically globbed on top of the first few chips and nothing else. So you had maybe two chips with anything that makes a nacho, nacho. So we weren't really impressed with their menu and they had a very mediocre selection of beer, so not exactly a place we would return to. The view was amazing though.
2019-06-17,1,This was my second and last time I come to this restaurant. The first time I came here I had the best service ever and now I understand that it was only because I was sat at a table. This time around I decided to eat at the bar. It just started being my boyfriend and I,  the waiter didn't even greet us she just placed the menu and left us along for 20 minutes.... we were the only ones sitting at the bar at 8:30 pm on a Monday [today].  But she was always very quick to go to little corner to answer her texts messages. I had to say excuse at least 5 times to get her attention so that the both times I was able to order a beer so she can only slam the cup on the table. Not only I but my friends then started to notice that she was miserable serving our now group of 4 people in total. The 0-2 times she came around our group she made it clear she didn't want to be there. She didn't even bother asking my two other friends if they wanted to open up a tab she just felt like she had to right to put it all under my boyfriends debit card... making it impossible for us to split the bill. Oh I made sure to get her name "Jessican" so it said on the bill. If your so miserable working at the bar then maybe you should seek employment else where you don't have to give your services to other people and make them feel uncomfortable for you dislike your work place. My boyfriend is a server/ Bartender himself and I 100% that not every day is a good day but if there's anything that he taught me is that not matter what's happening in your personal life you keep it out of your work place and don't take it out on your customers... and if you don't enjoy what you do then you should give up your spot to someone to someone who has passion in that field.
2019-06-17,3,Me & my girlfriend Stopped by yesterday (Sunday) for a little day drinking .Upon arrival we did notice it was pretty empty , so we decided to grab a seat at the bar .I ordered an ipa , my girl ordered a mixed drink . We started with the buffalo cauliflower , which was just literally lightly cooked cauliflower with spicy buffalo sauce on it (not so great),Then shared the Mac & cheese burger , which was yummy .I suggest upgrading your fries to the truffle cause their regular ones kinda suck .The music is good and the decor is cute , but our service was horrible , which is enough for me not to go back .
2019-06-16,3,Decent place to grab a quick bite near the water.  The fish tacos and burger was ok, nothing spectacular about the food.  The service was adequate. Nowhere to sit outside on a Friday night but inside was relatively empty.
2019-06-15,4,This place can get extremely busy so I recommend making a reservation. The food is good, the atmosphere is fun, and it has an Amazing view of Manhattan. Great music selection and it always feels Alive! There is a ROCKSTAR Host named CARMEN who has a great personality she is always smiling with good energy all around!  She works well under pressure even when she gets slammed with guest reservations/walk ins she remains professional and acknowledges each guest with a smile. She is definitely an asset to the front desk! I'm impressed with her work ethic, abilities, and the way she conducts herself. I've seen some restaurants where the host gets uptight, panics, and can be very unprofessional but Carmen does the opposite and keeps the boat afloat! Woo Hoo for The Ainsworth Hoboken! :) Keep It Up Carmen!
2019-06-09,2,We just stopped by with our bikes to get something for dinner. The food looks good and so we decided to walk in. After 5 minutes we decided to leave again. The person who is responsible for seating was unfriendly and rude. She, the host said there is only one table for two but this one has to be cleaned first. So she turned around without any additional commend and walked back to the desk. After that we got the table with a lot of trash (Napkins, Water bottle and Some Paperwork). After that we got our menu thrown at the table without any comment by the host, Surprisingly it was empty.  Maybe we will give it a bother chance, since the food looked really good. But only if this host is not in charge next time. (SUNDAY ~ 5pm)
2019-06-02,5,First time visiting the ainsworth in Hoboken and will definitely be returning. It was a little busy but our server Chanel was extremely attentive to us. She suggested the crooked knife cocktail which was delicious. For an app she recommended the fried artichoke hearts which were to die for! Will definitely be coming back here soon!
2019-05-23,1,I have been to Ainsworth in NYC multiple times. I've been to the Hoboken location 3 times, and the service has single handedly ruined my experience every time. Yesterday, we didn't even manage to sit down. We were celebrating my sisters graduation. A server told us we could sit outside and even helped us find another chair for our party of 6. Another server, Meagan, came over after we'd all been seated and told us we couldn't sit there bc parties of 6 can't sit outside (reason being, slower turn around rate). Mind you, it was 4PM on a Wednesday, EVERYONE IS AT WORK. We asked her to make an exception, as we walked our 94 yr old grandmother over here and she still insisted we couldn't sit there. No manager on site and the manager has yet to call us back. The few tables around us were floored by this situation and even offered to give up their seats so we could stay. Truth was, it had nothing to do with space, it had to do with the benefit of the establishment and had nothing to do with making the customer happy. It's a shame because this is one of my favorite places to go in Manhattan and as a resident of Hoboken, that will be the last time I enter the Hoboken location.
2019-05-23,1,If you wish to be treated disrespectfully, where the staff are not interested at all in anything resembling customer service - quite frankly are nasty and rude - then this establishment should be right up your alley.  My family and I went there at 4:15pm on 05/22/2019 to celebrate a graduation and, after being told by one employee that the six of us could sit outside (nice day, plenty of room outside), we were subsequently told by another staff member that they do not seat parties of six outside; it's their "policy."  The reason given: outside seating is first-come, first-served, and parties of six tend to take longer than smaller parties do.  Well, we were there first and they had plenty of room for six to sit outside.  But, since they want to turn the tables faster, they wanted us inside the restaurant.  Oh and by the way, after initially allowing us to sit outside, they wanted to uproot us (including a 95 year-old woman) and move us to an inside table (the place was empty).  The person treating us in this manner is named Megan; not sure if she is a hostess or what her role is, but I am sure she is not nice. She took my name and number and told me that her manager, Mike, would call me to discuss this. I'm still waiting for Mike's call, but not holding my breath.  Please be advised, Ainsworth is far more interested in making money faster than they are in providing a good dining experience for paying customers, and they lost about $300 in the process. Really sad, but for them its all about the mighty dollar.   Go to Wicked Wolf instead; they're nice!
2019-05-23,1,The service here is horrible. I have lived in Hoboken for 6 years and have been just about everywhere. For the name and location, ainsworth has been a complete disappointment every single time I have gone and after this past weekend I will never go back. My family and I went to celebrate my sisters graduation yesterday and were looking to sit outside. There was an open table for four and an open table for 2, we were a party of six. We were told by one server we could take the tables . Another server (Meghan) came out and told us we could not have them and they would not seat a table of six outside. At this point we already had my 94 year old grandmother out of her wheelchair and sitting at the table. Meghan refuSed service to us and made us move (the rationale, if it matters, was that it takes longer for . We put our 94 year old grandmother back in her wheelchair and left this establishment and that will be the last time any of us go there. Good news is there are plenty of places in Hoboken that are happy to accept business, so go elsewhere. I hope it was worth it for them.
2019-05-19,1,We went to eat with family and were told wait would be 30 minutes. after patiently waiting nearly an hour we checked in. we were told we were not going to be seated and that was that. Spoke with manager who called confirmed we were not welcome as they did not staff their kitchen appropriately. They did not bother to let us know and we sat outside in the sun patiently waiting to be told go away and neither the hostess or manager seemed to care or have any explanation why they would not have let us know sooner. Plenty of much better places in area. Will mot be coming back. No thanks.
2019-05-19,1,I came here with my girlfriend for what I thought would be a great Sunday brunch. When we walked in the hostess's were completely rude and were having conversations among them selves. We were waiting for an outside table and a group of 4 girls come in and the hostess automatically tends to them. Makes me feel like there's a Lil homophobia. We finally sit and our waitress Sophia was absolutely great, she's was the best expirence of this visit. We orderd the steak and eggs which on the menu states it's skirt steak, we got hanger steak which was gross and overally salted. Thennnn ! We find out that it's only CASH, not that it was a problem. But they should've been more thoughtful of there customers, not everyone carry's cash . I think we will be going to the place next door next time. Thanks Sophia for providing great service, the minor issues aren't her fault.
2019-05-19,5,Good service! Food came in a reasonable amount of time. This place has a standard selection of drinks and an amazing selection of food. Sat outside this time, and the inside looks really clean and well kept.w I would definitely recommend going here if you want to take in Hoboken and a place to eat nearby the water!
2019-05-18,5,Great menu for brunch. Mimosas and Bloody Marys well prepared. Definitely recommended and will return!
2019-05-11,2,I should have read the reviews before going to this place. I had the Mac and cheese burger. The Mac & cheese was yummy it just lacked a little salt. The burger was burnt and it tasted like it, it was also not seasoned :( totally ruined the experience for me. Then the Mac and cheese patty was bland. I had to put ketchup on the burger itself to give it some oomph. But even the ketchup couldn't save the burger. The fries were yummy and thick, good on salt. My friends burger was ordered well done but came to us medium rare so that had to go back to the kitchen. My waitress wasn't rude or mean but she definitely wasn't friendly or warm. The waitress was bland. All in all it was a bland experience.
2019-04-29,4,Our group of 5 went this past Saturday night.  It was crowded, so glad we had reservations.  The food was great.  For apps we ordered the mac n cheese fries, short rib empanadas, chicken nachos and wings. All good.  We ordered a bunch of different entrees - chicken BLT (husband LOVED) 2 fish tacos - really good, short rib tacos - yum! and the turkey burger.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals.  We were there for my neices' birthday and the waitress brought out a dessert with giant sparking candle on her own just knowing it was her bday.  Our waitress (forgot her name!) was excellent.  It was packed and she always made sure we had drinks and was accessible if we needed anything.  The only semi-not great thing was the noise level, but it was a Saturday night in Hoboken, so not surprising.  As the night went on, it looked more like a club scene, but we left by 9ish. We will definitely be back soon.
2019-04-26,1,Went there during a busy week-end. Was seated immediately. waited 20 minutes to have the menu. Waited 51 minutes to have a burger. The burger was OK, but not great... No apologies, no discount, poor service.Will never come back to this place.
2019-04-25,1,Saw not one, not two, but THREE mice running across the room while eating lunch. There was literally ONE other table eating there when we came (who were just as shocked and disgusted). The wait staff did NOT care  and actually made a joke out of it. The hostess sat a table where we saw the mice run to hide and when I asked why they were seating people where there was mice the waiter said "well now they won't come out anymore". We were then told to come sit at the bar and that "at least our feet will be high off the ground". Very alarming that NOBODY seemed to care. The manager gave us two free beers for having to experience that but it took at least 20 minutes for him to come and address the issue. We were told an exterminator is working on it. I can't even imagine what's going on in the kitchens and areas that aren't visible to the public.
2019-04-18,1,I really try and like this place due to its awesome location, but the food is just not good. Got fish tacos and it was literally one piece of fish and one slice of avocado in a tortilla. At least add lettuce or a salsa or SOMETHING to give the taco more to it. So disappointing and for $15 with no side, absolutely not worth the view. Also the draft beer tastes like their lines are off. Not cold and like it's on it's way to skunking.
2019-04-09,1,Cool decor and decent service/food. HOWEVER A MOUSE RAN OUT AND UNDER OUR TABLE and the waitstaff did not seem to care. I will not go back.
2019-04-07,4,On our walk to the path train we saw this spot and decided to grab something good to eat. The environment is like your normal sports bar with TVs all over but with a touch of a restaurant feel. After reviewing the menu my lady decided on the guacamole and chips. I, on the other hand, posed the idea of getting the 24k gold wings which were noted as "INSTAGRAM WORTHY", along with my regular order of the Turkey burger with truffle fries. Now I gave this a 4 star review because it took 10 - 15 minutes tes tea and to get our order for food and it was not busy. Once the food arrived it was exactly what they said....INSTAGRAM WORTHY! Our phones admired our dishes as we captured worthy images of the table of food with all the right angles. The wings looked like they were 24k solid gold but after biting into one we realized it was just a coconut oil infusion that was coupled with amazing seasoning. I recommend the wings, the burger, and the guacamole with chips. All of the food was delicious. My pictures say more words than I can say so check them out. Also, go follow me on Instagram to see more of my experiences @tonii2eyes.
2019-04-06,2,I've eaten here before and have never had a problem but we were told that there was going to be 35 minute wait and it ended up being almost two hours. So disappointed in this place.
2019-04-01,4,I will honestly give this food a 3 but the service and morning mimosas a 4. I had the banana pancakes and eggs totally not worth $40. My friends had the steak and eggs and they all loved it. Their service is amazing & you get a whole champagne and orange juice during brunch hours. They won't bother you and let you enjoy until you are finished with your bottles. The waiter was super friendly & nice. Next time I think I will just have to get a better plate.
2019-03-24,3,A sports bar for sure but the food is average and the TV situation for sports could be better. I kind of feel like they did average on both fronts thus an average rating. In warm weather the location is unbeatable though with views on the nyc skyline. A solid 3 - star rating
2019-03-22,3,Went for the gold wings... they were out of the gold wings. Lame. Burger was good. Wait for table was longer even tho place was empty.
2019-03-08,4,This location has one of the best brunch specials I have ever seen! I can't believe after living in Hoboken for almost three years that I just found out about this deal.  For brunch, you get  BOTTLE of champagne with an entree. That's right a bottle! This place is now my new favorite spot for a boozy brunch with friends.  I can't stress how great of a deal this is.I will be having brunch here a ton moving forward.  The city skyline views only make this deal better.
2019-03-06,5,I very much enjoyed Brunch here. Its a great view, lovely atmosphere and you can't beat the price. $39 gets you a bottle of prosecco and an entre. For my Entre I got the Mac & Cheese burger with a veggie patty. It was DELICOUS. They have a Mac & Cheese Patty then top the burger with more mac and cheese. It was great to be there, we didnt feel rushed and felt the customer service was great too!
2019-03-04,2,The service and friendly waitstaff are really the only things that remotely save this place. Food was decent don't get me wrong but it's badly overpriced for what you get. The fries were bland, chewy, and disappointing. The burger was ok but honestly it wasn't $16 ok. I've had better at Applebees. Idk I just wish place was a little bit better...
2019-02-21,3,Three of us went to the Ainsworth for dinner on Monday night. We ordered nachos to start and various burgers because they didn't have short ribs (even though it is part of 2 items on their menu). The food was good but the service wasn't. There was one server for the entire restaurant and it took a while to get drinks or refills. I know mondays can be slow in the restaurant business but it was frustrating to have to try to get the waitress to refill drinks because she was so busy.
2019-02-20,3,I liked the ambience and drinks. We came here for team dinner + karaoke what else you need. Every Tuesday they have kareoke starting 9 pm to 11pm , $5 each song.We ordered couple of drinks and red wine, am putting down the one I ordered.The crooked knife - it was tequila based cocktail with red chilly. It had a unique taste, I loved it a lot. I almost had 5 of these!  Rating 5/5Malbec red wine - it was good, am not a dry wine person but I had little at the end.  Rating 4/5Appetizers : Tuna tartar - it did look good and my colleagues loved it.. intact we ordered another round of this appetizer. If you like tuna (raw) then go for it. I don't like anything raw so I did not eat this one.  Rating 4/5- am giving rating based on happy faces I saw and feedback I received on this.Fried Mac & Cheese - it was delicious. Must try dish! Mac n cheese was freshly made it was defiantly yum! Rating 4.5/5 . Am cutting 0.5 bcoz they served ketchup along with it. I was hoping to see something innovative to have this  delicious fried Mac n cheese!Chips and guacamole- it was average. 1st round of appetizer guacamole was good. On 2nd round, it was super salted! When we notified server, she said you are already eating it, and we make that in bulk! It was kind of rude to point out we are eating and she failed to notice that we tasted and that is how we knew it was super salted. Disappointed with thsi experience! Rating 2.5/5Mains:We ordered various and am going to review only the once I tried.Market catch (fish of the day)- it was grilled salmon stake with asparagus. I asked for well done but it was over cooked and so dry I couldn't even finish half of the dish.  Rate 3/5Veggie Burger - it was a good plate. Tasty juicy burger patty with French fries. They provide hot sauce which is very hot , I think made of ghost pepper and vinegar. It was defiantly tasty Rate 4/5Service: 3/5Parking: there is public parking available right front of hotel W. This is paid parking. Rate 4/5Except for that guacamole part rest of the things were good. I enjoyed my team dinner with delicious appetizer and cool cocktails!  Good place to hangout with friends!
2019-02-18,1,I wish I had pictures of food to share but nope couldn't even get food at this restaurant. Last night after visiting a few bars it was time to get something to eat so we decided to go to Ainsworth since it was open until 1am, but at 11pm we were encountered with a close restaurant. Not being one to hold grudges we tried to stop by for lunch today. We entered an empty restaurant at 1pm. We asked if we could have the weekday lunch special and were told they weren't doing it today (being a holiday I understood). So we processed to order the short rib tacos and short rib grilled cheese with a side of truffle fries, the waitress said she had to check if they had the truffle oil. Turns out they did have the truffle oil but did not have short rib. PLEASE either take things off your menu if you cant provide them or inform your staff so that this doesn't happen. Let's just say I won't be giving this place a third try.
2019-02-17,5,Both times that I've visited, I ordered the Mac & cheese burger .. So if I ordered it a second time .. I guess that tells you something ; ) It's a pretty good burger.. it comes with a panco crusted fried Mac & cheese patty, and more mac & cheese on top .. no complaints.. it's a solid burger and the Mac & cheese is pretty yummy too! The fries are good! Nice and crispy! I've also tried their Margherita flat bread that comes with roasted tomatoes, pesto oil, marinara, mozzarella, Parmesan, and basil. Was pretty delicious!! If you're in the area and are in the mood for a burger and some Mac & cheese then definitely pop in and check them out . Definitely curious to try their French onion burger-caramelized onions, a crispy onion ring, and gruyere on an English muffin with their garlic Parmesan fries so next time I pop in, those are on my list!
2019-02-16,1,BEWARE OF THIEVING, SCAMMING BARTENDERS !!!!! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT give them your credit card ! They take advantage of inebriated patrons and overcharge tabs! I ordered drinks when I arrived at 10pm during happy hour, but my "order wasn't put in" until 1130 (AFTER happy hour), so they attempted to charge me full price. They also added drinks to my friend's tab that we've never even heard of. No ma'am! Besides scamming, they also have attitudes and ignore you until they feel like serving. I stood at the not-busy bar while the bartender had her back turned on and was on FaceTime. When I said EXCUSE ME, she turned around slowly and asked if I needed anything as if I was standing there for my health. In addition to the scamming bartenders, the waitresses also don't care about their customers because their gratuity is already added to the bill. The waitress didn't give the table silverware or ask if we wanted water or drinks. We placed our order with a busboy because she disappeared. She returned with half the table's food and didn't come back. We tried to flag her down and another waitress pointed to our table. She looked, shrugged and walked away. If I could give this establishment NEGATIVE stars I would. I'm going to be watching my credit card very closely over the next few days. I already see one suspect charge and reversal on my card from them. When I confronted the manager about being overcharged and tried to explain the problems that occurred during the night with his staff, this grown man actually ROLLED HIS EYES at me. I've never had so many problems at ONE restaurant in ONE night.
2019-02-16,2,While the food was delicious and I truly enjoyed my meal, I was really unhappy with the service I recited today. This isn't my first time at Ainsworth and I've also visited the location in midtown. Tonight, I ordered the skirt steak, which again was delicious. But when I asked if it came with fries to two different staff members I was told absolutely not, that it came with Brussel sprouts. I checked the menu again on the way home because I could have sworn I saw French fries and I was correct. I understand not knowing the answer and needing to check, but simply saying absolutely no when the menu clearly states all steak comes with fries is disappointing. I will not be returning again, unfortunately.
2019-02-13,4,Ainsworth has great burgers, not the best in Hoboken though (O'Neil's for sure!) but they're a close second. Went here last Friday for dinner and while the food was decent, they had a DJ playing.. during our 8:30pm dinner. It was beyond loud you could barely have table conversations. Would've preferred if it didn't start till 10pm rather than dinner time.
2019-02-09,4,This is a close spot to the W hotel in Hoboken, if your looking for a bar where the bartender can make a great old fashion this is the place to hit up.  Great place to grab some wings and the Mac n cheese burger is awesome, def worth trying!
2019-01-27,1,Service is absolutely horrible. They didn't come to take out order for about 20 minutes. It wasn't even busy. Very lazy staff. Food is mediocre. But won't go again because of very poor service.
2019-01-26,2,My girlfriend has been raving about this place for awhile so we naturally popped in on Thursday afternoon for lunch. It is located in Hoboken, so parking is truly a disaster, esp. midday. Its more of a sports bar meets rustic type of feel. We walked in and the hostess was seated on her laptop doing work and kind of ignored us for a bit. Sorry to have bothered you while you were suppose to be doing your job. But ok, we were seated in the dinning area, which again, great decor. Food: 0.5/2 - Everyone raves about the infamous mac and cheese burger so naturally I had order it and it was disappointing. It was featured as a burger, with a panko breaded mac & cheese patty topped with more mac and cheese. So here were my issues: 1. I ordered a medium-rare burger, but lets serve a well-done one. 2. While the M&C on top of the burger was good, the actually M&C patty was flavorless, which was odd. 3. It appeared they took the deep fried M&C patty straight from the fryer to the burger bun because the bun was drenched in oil and actually disintegrated and I had a bunless burger. Service: 1/2 - While we had a crappy first encounter coming into the restaurant, our waitress was very sweet. The service took awhile but they also had one waitress running the while dinning area during lunch time, which shows poor management. There was probably 6-7 other tables being waited on as well. Price: 0.5/2 - For a sports bar, it is a bit more expensive but they are located in Hoboken so its a catch 22 to be honest. However, my $17 burger was 100% not worth it. Happy eating!
2019-01-10,1,The service was absolutely terrible. Went for a bite to eat with my friend and the waitress took forever to take our order, never came back to ask how the food was, didn't ask if we wanted anything else or bus our table, and after 20 minutes of waiting with dirty plates in front of us, flagged down someone for the check. Once we were given the check, we couldn't even find anyone to take our cards, eventually finding someone that wasn't even our waitress and was the waitress for a different table that asked how she could help.  In addition to the poor service, the music was blasting as if we were at a club, when it reality, it was far from; we we're surround by dates and a business dinner. Needless to say, I will NOT be frequenting this place again.
2019-01-10,4,My friends and I purchased tickets for their New Years ever party. It was super fun! The tickets were expensive but I believe well worth it -- it was premium open bar all night, hors dourves, and free champagne at mid night! The only downfall was that they didn't remove the tables from the middle so there really wasn't a lot of room walk or dance. Also I recommend a bathroom attendant for this event because the bathrooms were gross and a mess. The place was really pretty and right on the water, will be returning!
2019-01-02,4,Very good burger! Service was pretty weak but they only had one server on. She was quick but just seemed frazzled. I ordered the Hanger Burger with seared steak and jalapeños with parm cheese. Tremendous flavor.On the down side, both my beers seemed a little flat. Took a long time to get the check, but none the less a good burger !
2019-01-01,1,Did not eat here, simply went to a party. The party was fun, but the staff here are an embarrassment for such a beautiful setting location. While waiting for my drink I see a waiter separate than mine having a fit about a guy not leaving her a tip for a drink he purchased. She waited for the guy to walk away to blurt out "if you can't afford to tip youre broke and should stay home" myself, my friends and three other people at the bar looked at her in distaste..... Although she waited for the customer to walk away to be a tough guy, other people hearing that is just as highly unprofessional. Next, with a different waiter, I ordered a drink each for my two friends and I and left a $4 tip. my friend got the next round & left another $4 tip and I wanted another drink so I got the 3rd round. I get my receipt and it had 20% gratuity included for 3 $10 drinks, my friends and I had tipped all night and were going to continue to...but it being added to my bill without my consent really put a bad taste in my mouth. When asked why the waiter said "gratuity is now included for the rest of the night" the fact that this was communicated after and not posted anywhere can't be legal. And I will be in touch with my bank... I also won't be returning here. Tips will come naturally when you are pleasing to customers and aren't pressed for them. Every waiter at this party on 12/29 was disgusting and I can see why they would have to force tips on themself. Embarrassing....replace the whole staff.
2018-12-13,5,Took an Amazon client here for dinner and drinks. The staff was on point - very attentive with refills and spaced the food out well from a timing perspective. Got the gold dusted wings just for novelty and they were  pretty fun to eat! Plus, you can't beat the view. Everyone in my party had a great time and enjoyed the meal. I would come back with friends without hesitation!
2018-12-01,4,A few updates to their brunch menu! They no longer have the brunch burger (I'm so bummed - it was the best) and the breakfast burrito. Also, they now offer a $35 brunch package in which you can choose one brunch entree and also get one bottle of Prosecco and mixers (for mimosas and bellinis). This was definitely worth the money! It felt like I got as much alcohol as I would if I did bottomless at another establishment.
2018-11-13,3,Have been coming here since they made their debut in Hoboken, and I've come to the conclusion that it's just "meh" at this point. I want to like it more. It's got a cool set up, lively ambiance, outdoor/open air dining (when weather permits), extensive menu and panoramic views of the Manhattan skyline. The food and service are just ok. I had to send a salad back recently due to blatantly undercooked chicken on top.  I was with a large group and didn't get my salad back until everyone had finished eating and wasn't offered any compensation. On another occasion, I ordered a cocktail and the bartender handed me a rocks glass that was less than half full. I used to see this place as a spot to bring friends and family from out of town, but I'm over it. If you're looking for a vibe and you're able to get passed the mediocre food, go ahead. I just think there's better bar food elsewhere.
2018-11-11,5,Came here with my sister in law prior to my son's game @saintpeters.  We ate at the bar although there were seats available in the dining area . The view from the bar was just too nice not to  grab a seat.  It was a brisk day in November so we started off with shots of tequila. Went down nice a smooth.  We decided to order their house drink.  Unfortunately can't remember the name since I was following my sister in laws lead on drink selections (see photo). Our food entrees were yummm.  We ordered the tuna tartar, fish tacos, turkey burger and fries. Overall everything was great.  Will definitely come back
2018-11-04,2,2 stars because I liked the decor. The service is horrible- took 25 mins to get a refill on my drink. The food is blah- turkey burger was burnt to a crisp. Had no water. The bathroom had no soap. The waitress hardly came to our table throughout our meal, told us 'I'm like a chicken with my head cut off today.' Yea I'd say so. This place needs to be revamped asap.
2018-10-31,4,Came here for my friend's birthday Saturday after the original Ainsworth location we were supposed to go to, wasn't opening to the public until 6pm due to a private event.  We had a large party of 14.  The place was very accommodating, as most of the party came at several different times.   We were here for about 3 hours.  The service was pretty good although there were a few flaws.  The waiter kept forgetting some of the parties drinks/food (I completely understand since it was a large party), some of the food was served cold.  Other than that, it was pretty good.  I ordered the Prickly Pear cocktail and Apple Poppy salad.  My meal was pretty good, I definitely enjoyed the cocktail.  I definitely would come back.
2018-10-29,5,Great staff and nice atmosphere! Me and my friends went here to celebrate a birthday, and I unfortunately lost my phone and ID. Luckily, someone turned it in. One of the managers (Martina) even found me on facebook to let me know that my phone was safe and answered my questions about how I can pick it up, etc. She was so helpful throughout the whole ordeal :)
2018-10-28,4,A nice somewhat upscale but not too trendy restaurant and bar in Hoboken right along the water. The beer selection is fairly decent with a few good craft brews on tap. The food was good as well with some upscale bar bites that were well made. Service was pretty friendly and it didn't take too long to get served at the bar, not always a given in Hoboken.
2018-10-19,2,Big open bar with a strange middle split at the front; turn to the back right and you're at the entry. The bar curling around the left side when you enter.Friendly staff and lots of space for bigger parties, but ironically quiet on a Thursday night. Maybe too far from Washington St or just a cold night outside. Lots of TVs around. First two beers I picked, they were out of, which was disappointing. Ended up with an Allagash. The others tried cocktails which looked fun.Appetizers - had the wings, which were 8 for $14. Not bad, but I like my wings crispier though the sauce was decent (I had mild). They also have this special gold-dusted (literally gold) wings... 10/20/50pc for $45/90/1000 for  "Foodgod 24K Gold Wings", respectively, expensive so that's probably best left to true foodies with extra money lying around to try.Main was the Sinatra Burger ($16), with bleu cheese, bacon marmalade, caramelized onions. I asked for medium well, which ended up well done... not too far off but friends who got it medium rare, they also got well done. Eh. Fries a little thick for me, but others liked it. They ran out of truffle oil, though, so no truffle fries. The mac & cheese burger looked massive - girl who ordered that took 50% of it home.Overall, ok, but I've had a better food at bars. This is an event space so they do close it periodically for weddings, etc.
2018-10-18,2,This is fun place in a great location.  They have an indoor/outdoor bar which is terrific in good weather. The view of Manhattan is as good as it gets and you can see the skyline while you're at the bar watching football.  The problems start when you sit down to eat or drink. The hostesses are very attentive and helpful, but the service is confusing and to say it is inattentive, would be a wild understatement. I had to beg the bartender for a food menu and waive him down to order drinks even though I was seated right next to the beer taps. When my outdoor table was ready the waitress suggested I continue ordering from the bar. As my table was next to the bar and right behind the seat I had just left I didn't foresee any issues.  I couldn't have been more mistaken. It literally took me ten minutes to get the bar tenders attention and that was after asking the bar back to get him multiple times. And he was NOT busy at all. He was just standing at the other end of the bar doing nothing. This happened every single time I tried order or get my check. It was like they were purposely playing a joke on me. But I don't think they were.  They just don't care. The food was mediocre and the beer warm but that's to be expected from this type of restaurant. The energy and crowd was great. I actually would go back. I'd just eat beforehand. It might be the worst service I've ever gotten and that's saying something. I want to reemphasize that they were not busy. The bar almost empty.
2018-10-01,5,My first time at the restaurant & my experience was excellent thanks to Meshon. Great drinks & food was amazing thank youuu!
2018-09-30,3,I definitely would not come here for the food (nothing special and average to low quality) but it is a nice place to meet up and hangout with your friends before you go out to the bars in Hoboken. The atmosphere is beautiful and they play great music. They have a great section of beers, liqueur, and cocktails. I would recommend the Ainsworth for a birthday pre-game because it's really close to all of the bars and its the type of place where you can get dressed up and not look overdressed. They also have huge sparklers that they put in the desserts if it's your birthday and I think that's a nice touch.
2018-09-30,1,Sitting at the window. Room around us so it's not like it's to it's full capacity. 15 min to get approached by a waitress? Is this acceptable to you? Let's try their food and maybe adjust a review from there.... 1h laterBoth had burgers. Great presentation but not the taste. They didn't season the patty and is basically just a blend piece of meat.Had to approach a hostess to ask for utensils because waitress was no where to be found. Wanted another drink and also had to look for a waitress to be accommodated. Sucks since this place is a fun place to watch games and has a good loud atmosphere.
2018-09-30,1,Don't come on Sunday. Terrible service, managers drinking heavy hanging out with their friends and not making sure place is being run properly, food tasted mediocre at best. I've been here during the week and was fairly consistent, avoid the weekend at all cost. Poor showing.
2018-09-20,4,Great spot in hoboken waterfront. They have a smaller food selection, however, their mac n cheese burger is delicious! The views are spectacular and have outdoor seating!
2018-09-09,1,Food pieces of glass in my food and when i showed in to waiters,instead of apologizing she was very rude! Disgusting staff and service and not to forget dangerous food!
2018-09-08,4,Mac and cheese burger is great. I get it ever time I go and it never fails. Nice view of the city and there's a park right across the street. Staff is friendly and atmosphere is fun and inviting. Great spot for a summer night! This place won't disappoint.
2018-09-08,1,Didn't start great, the hostess wasn't able to tell us whether or not there was an oyster special. We then asked to sit out side and got our waters delivered after way too long of waiting. Then we tell them we wanted to know if there's an oyster special and our waiter informs us that there is but you can only sit in a special section to order that. So now we've been waiting to order and we have to be reseated by the window about 5 feet from our original seats outside. Our waiter takes far too long to come back and get our order, mind you the entire restaurant was over half empty. We obviously wanted oysters. After waiting over 30 minutes for them to complete this task and my friend waiting 15 minutes after he finished his first beer for anyone to ask if he wanted a refill, you could say we were pretty annoyed. During our wait our server asked if we wanted the windows open and we obviously did considering we wanted to sit outside originally. The restaurant owner then comes over and verbally chastises him for asking, snaps his fingers and orders our waiter away from us. He was rude, aggressive and an all around asshole. We will not be returning to this venue and recommend you don't try your luck here either.
2018-08-17,4,Just passed by quick to grab a drink before heading to a party, good beer deals and happy hour specials  until 7:00 pm. We wanted to try the oysters but they said they didn't have, I was upset about that but still had a good time. Nice ambience
2018-08-13,4,Pros: The food was amazing, I recommend the Mac N Cheese Burger, it was delicious!! The restaurant is right across the street from the water so you can take a nice walk after you eat to see the NYC skyline. Cons: I wish they had an unlimited mimosa option for brunch. It was pretty noisy as well, which is expected during brunch.
2018-08-11,1,Wish I could give it negative stars. Bartender is a complete inept drink server. Served warm soda with no ice and tells  customer it is cold. When confronted bartender got hostile and argumentative. Low class service in a otherwise nice establishment.
2018-08-11,5,Ok I came here for the first time last Sunday and again this Thursday, I'm loving this place the more I go, the bartenders are amazing! Shout out to Juan, Jose and JD, they definitely make you feel so welcomed, definitely coming back tomorrow for lunch.
2018-08-09,2,Bar is never properly staffed. Takes 45 minutes to get a drink, even if it's empty. They have great food but unfortunately can't see them making it much longer.
2018-07-27,5,My guy JD the bartender is the man! Cool vibe, strong pour and always handy with the phone power cord!  Check me out in chitown dude!
2018-07-19,4,Ive been to this establishment a few times & have always enjoyed it. Being that it is located right near the water, you have a great view throughout the entire place. Personally, I think the spring/summer/fall is the best time to go here because they open up the windows to the outside, have plenty of outdoor seating, & also have a mini bar where you can sit & order drinks/food from the bar inside.On the inside, the bar is rather big & there are plenty of places to find seating. Around the bar are plenty of tv's so if you're there to watch a game, there's no bad spot to view it from. This bar has plenty of beers & drinks to choose from & the staff is very friendly & will offer advice if you're not sure what you want to drink. If you want to sit down & eat, this establishment also has plenty of seating areas away from the bar as well. Depending on the day/time, different genres of music is played throughout.My favorite time to go here is either for a Friday Happy Hour or Saturday during the early afternoon. To me, this establishment gives off a very chill/relaxed vibe which is perfect for both those occasions. I really enjoy coming here during the fall for a Happy Hour & sitting at the outside bar. If you're here & your hungry, I suggest either the chicken wings or sliders, both are great! The only reason that this place is not a 5 is because it can be a bit pricey if you stay for a long time & also it's not really a spot you go to during the winter months (which can last very long in Nj). However, if you need a new spot for Friday Happy Hour or to watch some college football in the fall, this is a very solid choice!
2018-07-17,3,Ok1/2 price tacos on Tuesday, so we ordered one of each.Rib tacos - juicy and a bit sweet with a slight kick from the pickled onions and a slice of raw jalapeno.Fried chicken taco - couldn't try because not gluten free, but my friends liked it Coffee rub fish taco - my favorite. The fish was moist and flaky, at first I couldn't taste the coffee but it became more apparent as you eat it. Great balancing of the bitterness of the coffee with pineapple on the salsa. The avocado sauce in it is pretty good as well, but almost didn't need it. Cobb salad- really liked the vinegar based dressing, it made the salad light and perfect for the summer. I would have liked it better if we weren't greeted by the stench of sewage on our way out.
2018-07-11,4,We visited in the evening and had immediate seating available inside and out.  I had the coffee-rubbed fish tacos, normally 15 but half off because it was a Tuesday.  The pineapple pico and avocado purée were perfect toppings.  Another guy in our party had the ribeye and was happy with his as well.  The steak fries are huge, like a potato cut into 4 wedges!  We sat outside and had a great view of the Hudson.  The draft beer was nice and cold, and the Midsummer Mule was a great summer cocktail.  Service wasn't over the top, but attentive.
2018-07-05,3,Beautiful spot, great ambiance, great everything...except---service.The bartenders are a bit slow and seemingly are distracted by what's on the TV's. At first, I was thinking, perhaps it's the holiday, it is busy in the bar. But then taking a quick look around, everyone had their drinks and were enraptured in their own conversations. Really, I think, and this is just a guess, the bartenders were not getting a lot of tips for their work on a holiday. Call it a hunch, but they were just apathetic to us and the few folks who walked in after us. I saw one of the bartenders was apologetic to his customers who were waiting for service. But ours, well, he just didn't care. I've been here before and their food is great and service is normally top notch. I'm in the area often and will very likely come back outside of a holiday. I hope the apathy was just a bad tip night. I had a Leinenkugals and got my bud a beer as well, the lengthy time to service and time to get him to close out my tab caused us to miss the first bit of fireworks, but not too big a deal.Regardless of my service, I tipped my bartender 30%. Hopefully, they'll remember my face as a local and give me better service next time.
2018-07-05,3,Sometimes all you need from a bar is the ability to walk up and order a beer. You don't need fancy atmosphere or a killer scene, just an ice cold beer served quickly and a comfortable spot to enjoy it in. Ainsworth met that very basic need on a muggy July day.After wandering around the parks and strolling by the water I had developed a powerful thirst for a refreshing adult beverage. Luckily, this establishment came into view and I decided to give them a try. The interior is pretty standard with a friendly hostess waiting to greet you. The bar area had a nice group of like-minded folks also enjoying frosty pints, so the overall vibe was chill.The service was good, the beer tasty, and the seating comfortable. There really wasn't much else to say about the place.Would I go back? Maybe  ̄\_(ツ)_/ ̄ There are a lot of options in the area and without anything original to make it stand out I'd be hard-pressed to return. It's not bad, it just didn't make much of an impression.
2018-06-28,3,Kind of rude waitstaff. Went here to sit outside on a nice day, and the host walked away when she saw us coming, and then tried to lead us to the bar, where we specifically said we didn't want to sit. Food was good but a little pricey.
2018-06-25,1,This review is strictly on the staff and service.  The food was ok, and I loved the burger.  However, I've been here before and I didn't feel the staff was fully capable of the minimal requirements.  Just so that you know, we all work on the restaurant and customer service business and our expectations are very high because we provide an experience more than just a service.   At times the service is what will have the customer returning over and over again.  It was a table of 6 people my family (mom, wife, grandmother, friends and myself).   We originally sat down at a table where it was dark and away from the outside.  I simply went back to the hostess and asked if it wouldn't be too much trouble to move us to a closer table before we even sat.  We got from her a huge annoyed sigh and then a very nice roll of the eyes.  After we sat down, the waitress did not offer any specials, offer any drinks and simply did not care much if it was our first time there or not.  I was here once and rest of my family wasn't there.   We ordered the drinks and 3 times we had to return the sprite that was needed for my grandmother.  Now, needless to say, the waitress did not communicate with the bartender as I went up to the bar and ensure they would give me a sprite.   The bartender also gave me an attitude and said that she's been pressing the button for Sprite, but maybe the fountain was out of syrup.  It really isn't my problem, but I think there should be an effort to provide a 74 year old lady with sprite if she wants one.  Back to the waitress, she gave us 2 mins extra for us to make a decision which turned into 10-12 mins until she decided it was time to take our order.  Once the order came out, she didn't check if we needed anything and we did. We asked for ketchup and didn't come back for another 14 mins.  Not once did she ask us how the food was and also the plates from the appetizers were not cleared so the food runners had to come out with the food and help clear the table properly.  I have to say that they provided the best service of the day.  After we finished our food and she didn't care to ask for more drinks or anything I asked for the check and she decided that it would be ok to have me wait for her to take the check and pay for another 20 mins.  It was simply an F For service all around.  I like the food but I can't say that I will be coming back for another experience like that. Here's the check and what we spent. I recommend you re-train the staff and ensure they smile more and make the experience  memorable for ANY and every customer.
2018-06-09,5,I've been here about 3 times. Every single time has been great. Awesome drinks and delicious food. The burgers are sooo damnnn good. The bartender guy gio was super cool and makes the best drinks. The staff has always been nice to me. Even on my first night there, it was a Friday night prime time, I have no service complains.  Definitely want to go back soon.
2018-06-02,2,My best friend and I decided to have a night out. Keep in mind...we wanted to sit down have a nice dinner and casually drink and buy a bottle of wine. When we walked into the Ainsworth, no one was at the hostess booth, therefore, we stood there for (not exaggerating) 5 minutes before someone greeted us. Upon arrival, it was immediately awkward...the "manager" (and yes I put that in quotations considering he was by far the most opposite definition of a manager I've ever met) he didn't even walk us to a table...he walked us to an area and was like "do you like this table?...cause you can sit anywhere because this place doesn't have good ventilation" . As my friend and I picked our table and waited another 5 minutes for a menu..we picked our food and drinks fairly quickly. Luckily our waitress was very lovely and kind. Our drink order and food came out quick and the food was great! That was comforting until the bus boy took our plates before we were done eating AND the workers were stacking chairs on the tables while were still eating! Obviously, my friend and i started to notice the staff clearly was trying to RUSH people out and they don't want to be there. Oh forgot to mention our dinner reservations were at 10:45pm. Ok..so back to dinner, the plan was to continue to drink wine after dinner and end the night there. We felt awkward to ask for another drink because the staff had already stacked the chairs and began mopping(my friend went to use the bathroom and almost fell on the ground because hey were cleaning the floors...can we talk about a lawsuit if she would have fell!?!?) ...our waitress insisted that we stayed because we asked if they were closing. So, we ordered a BOTTLE of wine because they led us to believe that they weren't closing and or rushing people out. The bottle came and then all of a sudden the staff turned on ALL of the lights. My friend and I then started to drink the wine fast because we felt way too awkward. Continuing to work on the bottle of wine, as if it couldn't get anymore rude and uncomfortable...these people TURNED OFF THE MUSIC! (Keep in mind again it was 12:30 pm at this point and they are opened until 2) so finally I was fed up and called the "manager" over. After a conversation and him agreeing with how wrong the staff was. He comped our bottle and gave us drink tickets for the next time we come (ha I would NEVER go back there) end of story...if you want to go to dinner and inhale your food and get rushed out..this is deff the place for you! Advice to upper management.... this restaurant sells itself by its name...the location is perfect so why have such shit staff if you want to make money!?!? I ate here 6/1/2018 please confront your staff. (I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the food was amazing and our one waitress was nice)
2018-05-31,4,It's one of the best burger I have tried in my life. It has a knife on it. It's huge and I can barely finish the burger and the French fries. But too bad they don't have a huge tv screen to watch sports. They have a lot small individual TVs on the walls. The restaurant locates at Hoboken riverside and it has a perfect view outside the restaurant.
2018-05-30,4,Tried their famous mac and cheese burger.  The mac and cheese was not as gooey as what I expected, it was a bit dry/solid, not in a bad way. I guess it makes the eating experience less messy. Overall it was a good burger, but nothing amazing.
2018-05-20,1,I wish I could tell you about the food....but once we were seated we waited nearly 15 minutes before we walked out.    No waiter/waitress came over, and we tried signaling to the server but that didn't help either.  Not even water or "hey guys I'll be with you in a minute".   Nothing.     Wasn't crowded either.   Was looking forward to the food but it ended in disappointment
2018-05-16,2,Came here for dinner and drinks with coworkers. Typical place to grab a meal and drinks for happy hour. It was okay. Nothing really stood out to me. 2 Stars because I felt the waitress could had been quicker. They seemed pretty slow for there not having much people in the restaurant
2018-05-15,2,Except for one busboy, the service was awful. I came with my partner on a Thursday evening hoping to enjoy the weather and relax. The hostess told us that it would be awhile before we could be seated due to the fact that we wanted to sit outside and all the tables were filled. We waited and waited at the bar while watching tables become empty although the hostess seemed unaware of this. She was very slow to get people seated and seemed overwhelmed even though the place wasn't full at all. We ended up getting seated after 30 minutes of waiting even though tables were cleared after waiting about 10 minutes. Annoying but not a big issue.What ended up being a bigger issue were the waitstaff. Maybe they were understaffed or something, but after sitting outside for another 30 minutes we were never acknowledged or even given water. I ended up getting the attention of a busboy and he apologized and notified the waitresses. The weird thing was that the waitress came over and just stared at us... very weird, like she was too scared to say anything or just confused. Even the other folks sitting next to us were complaining about the service. Again, the place wasn't even close to being full. After being in the place for over an hour we left without even a glass of water. Would not recommend.
2018-05-15,1,Swung by the Ainsworth to check out the bar on Cinco De Mayo. Grabbed two seats on the outside section of the bar and quickly reviewed the menu. Had to actually ask the bartender to take our order, who seemed annoyed doing so. Bar was not overly busy. Ordered one drink, their Arnold palmer (different name same concept)- bartender never came back to ask if we wanted another, never so much as checked on us to see how our drink was, never even brought us the bill. We literally could have gotten up and walked away. We had to ask a busser to get the bartender who was at the other end of the bar doing prep work. Instead of coming over, we had a female bartender come to us and ask what we needed. When we asked for the check she asked what our tab was under, didn't have a tab because our male bartender never came back after dropping our drinks. Eventually he comes over drops the check and walks away. Needless to say we eventually paid and left. I would not return after my first interaction being this one and not sure how I can give more than one star for this kind of service.
2018-05-13,4,I came here with my wife on a Friday for date night and got outdoor seating with our doge. It was supposed to be an hour wait but we got a call back right away because of a cancellation.To our surprise, there were 2 other dogs chilling with their owners on the beautiful night. We spent the night with good drinks and burgers. The wife got the mac and cheese burger, which she was very happy with and I got the burrata burger. Mine wasn't bad, just a big messy and was not the medium rare I had asked for. I am used to the fact that whenever I order a burger and ask for medium rare, I usually get somewhere close to medium. It's not a big deal, but I suppose you have to set your expectations.Other than that, they have a great view of NYC and the atmosphere was nice. Will be back.
2018-05-12,4,This was my second time coming here. I honestly will keep coming back because the food is definitely high quality for a bar in downtown Hoboken. While the happy hour scene is busy and bustling, they don't skimp on the food taste and menu creativity. I've easily been able to get open table reservations and get seated immediately. My critiques are mainly that tables are very close together, and the restaurant is VERY loud. So much so that it's sometimes difficult to hear your dinner guest, as was the case the first time I went. My other critique is that the "chicken lettuce wraps" are a misnomer. It's a single piece of fried heavily breaded chicken wrapped in lettuce with some other fillings. The chicken was a bit dry and this didn't really come off as a "lettuce wrap". Other than that, I will say the food makes this bar worth visiting, especially if you're looking for a fun hoboken bar scene and a great view of the nyc skyline!
2018-05-09,1,Seems that the place gets bad rap from people before they get to taste their food. No surprise my review is the same. I made a reservation witht them for a Sunday's brunch a week ahead and then got a call in 3 days that their kitchen will be too busy to accommodate my party so they cancel my reservation. Well, the least I can do is to return a favor and give them 1 star... Meanwhile, I went to OpenTable and this time slot is still available for reservations. I decided not to try them twice and let someone else get next cancellation call.
2018-05-05,3,Their service needs a bit help my job was having a meeting through lunch and u was asked to pick up the food i called it in ordered and was given a wait time well I ended waiting even more because the host was on her phone rude and my order wasn't ready it seemed like they forgot to put it in i ended up having to leave and purchase beverages at a local supermarket because they didn't have to go beverages the food is okay I guess the location is what makes it appealing
2018-04-29,1,Firstly I'm confused as to why I can only get the Brunch menu at 3.45pm but no lunch menu. Apparently it goes from Brunch to Dinner. Secondly your website doesnt even show a Dinner menu, I looked on line and made a decision to make a reservation based on the assumption we would be choosing from the Lunch menu. How wrong was I...I decided to skip and not eat. My husband ordered the A - Burger..Really? Does A stand for astonishingly poor....2 tiny skinny patties with a slice of plastic ass kraft cheese..I pretty sure Mcdonalds are missing some patties. No kids menu...We ordered the paperback chicken sandwich for our kids to share. It was deep friend and tasteless. Actually I think the breaded outside was thicker than the chicken itself. The portion size is also small, too small for an adult imo not enough for kids to split. I dont know why there is no kids menu? I feel like I would have preferred to burn the money we spent today!!Such a shame really as the restaurant itself is nice and our server was friendly and polite. Wouldnt go back if I was offered a free meal..Save your money and time and choose somewhere else to eat
2018-04-28,1,Not good at all. And that's being nice. Overpriced drinks. The fried chicken tacos were basically a chicken finger in a what they call a tortilla that fell apart. Needed a knife and fork to eat. Chicken lettuce wrap was another chicken finger in romaine. Really. Romaine lettuce for a wrap. Prob the worst food I've had in we'll forever.
2018-04-26,1,We had a reservation and when we arrived we waited 10 mins for a hostess and he never came!
2018-04-15,1,We actually never had an opportunity to eat here as we booked an Open Table reservation for Saturday and we we originally told we had to wait 30 minutes despite having the reservation and were then told 15 minutes later that they could not honor our reservation at all!!! This is obviously a sign of very poor management -will never return here
2018-04-14,2,Server was friendly but food took forever to arrive. Orders were messed up, burger patty was super small, and our appetizers were forgotten. I decided to give this place a try even after the yelp 3 stars rating and now I regret it. Not to mention how overpriced their meals are. Don't bother eating here!!
2018-04-10,5,Excellent dining experience at Ainsworth in Hoboken. Their location is on the waterfront and very close to the Hoboken PATH making it easy to find. I have been here many times since Ainsworth has opened in town, both with big groups for birthday parties and more intimate sized dinners on other occasions. The food has been consistently delicious, the staff is great, and there is an awesome drink selection too. My favorite menu item so far is the mac and cheese burger which is unlike anything else! This burger oozes melted cheese and macaroni and is on top of an additional fried mac n cheese patty too. I will include a photo of this awesome meal. The brownie dessert with sparklers is also pretty cool for a birthday party dessert choice.
2018-04-10,4,My friends suggested that we hold our group brunch at Ainsworth, since they found it very spacious and family-friendly.  They both had children and wanted to go to a place where they felt comfortable, just in case any unforeseen issues arose. I had been to the restaurant for brunch in the past as well - twice in fact, but apparently had neglected to review my one positive and one mediocre experience.  On this recent visit, I started with a coffee, which I think was actually an Americano, given its rich flavor and heartier consistency.  It was really a bold cup of caffeine, three of which helped me power through an afternoon of cleaning when I arrived back at home!  For my meal, I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and added a topping of avocado.  The delicious salad included cold Israeli couscous, peppery arugula, roasted beets, salty feta cheese, and sweet orange.  It was really a terrific balance of flavors and textures.  I requested that the citrus vinaigrette be served on the side, but enjoyed it enough to pour on a decent amount.We were all happy with our meals, drinks, and experience at Ainsworth.  It was the perfect spot for our family brunch.
2018-04-09,4,Have been here a few times and have never been disappointed. Great spot when the weather is nice to dine outside at . Delicious brunch menu , would definitely recommend the eggs Benedict ! Friendly service and a great location
2018-04-06,4,Great location, great atmosphere, and great food! I went with a group of friends and we all ordered a different burger, all of which were very good! I would definitely recommend the chips and guacamole - SO good! Unfortunately the happy hour specials only apply when you sit by the bar, which is a bit deceiving when looking at the menu. The staff is friendly, but throughout the whole evening our waitress was no where to be found. Luckily it didn't effect my night, overall I'd recommend the restaurant - lots of great menu choices & a very cozy environment!
2018-04-01,5,Held a surprise engagement party at The Ainsworth. The staff was very accommodating and easy to work with. The servers and bartenders were attentive and made excellent drinks. This is not a place where the drinks are watered down. All the guests had a great time and were raving about the location, service, and experience.
2018-03-24,3,Good food. Good view. But don't expect to get a drink at the bar. Under staffed under trained.
2018-03-23,3,Told the wait would be 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad considering it was St. Pattys day and it's March madness! Once the 40 minute mark came we asked about how much longer and they stated 30 mins. Had open tables so we pointed a couple out and they sat us down. Ordered a Mac and cheese burger which consisted of a patty,deep fried Mac and cheese, and an extra blob of Mac and cheese too off with the bun. I was only able to eat half as I felt my arteries clogging! The food was decent but I gave it 3 stars because of the service. I felt we were just placed somewhere after we pointed out available tables, and once sat down it took someone 15 mins before coming to our table asking what we would like to drink. During the whole time it felt like we were forgotten.
2018-03-11,4,Had the chicken and sausage biscuits and it was huge. I would order again. Also got a Bloody Mary for $6 for the brunch drink special. I would pass on Bloody Mary and get a Mimosa or a beer next time.
2018-03-09,5,One of if not my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. Located literally right along the Hudson, this casual yet upscale restaurant rocks. I would not attend dinner in tennis shoes and workout pants but no need to get super fancy. Atmosphere and service is a 10. Food is also excellent. The only thing that could make this place better is if there were city views while you ate.
2018-03-06,5,Came here to surprise my boyfriend on his birthday. Everything was perfect. They placed us in our own little section which was nice because there was a bar crawl going on. Our waitress Claudia was so friendly and attentive. They brought out a cake with sparklers. The atmosphere was fun and the place is beautiful. Will be back for my birthday!! Thank you Heather & Amanda for your help with this reservation!
2018-03-05,2,I went for brunch last weekend. The music was a little too loud, service wasn't the best and the eggs were over cooked. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my eggs were hard boiled. My friend ordered the huevos rancheros and her eggs were also over cooked. So many other options in the area that we won't be returning.
2018-02-25,3,Pretty average food and prices. Location is great on water with solid views. Service is usually pretty good as well. Not the best, not the worst.
2018-02-25,4,I have recently discovered Hoboken"hobo" this past summer as I'm a New Yorker. I found this place today as I was looking for somewhere to eat on a rainy day. As soon as we arrived we were seated as it wasn't busy at the time. We did have to wait a few minutes before a waiter came over. The food was better than I expected as I'm very picky. Moderate price for a good amount of food. Service was good and fast. Will be returning here in the Spring.
2018-02-06,3,The atmosphere is cool but the food is just average. When it first opened up I felt like it was very good. It's not bad but it isn't​ anything to jump up and down over anymore. The dessert were amazing though. If you are looking to go get a drink and hang out, maybe watch a game, get a few appetizers and split them with your buddies, then I would say this is the place for you.
2018-01-25,5,Amazing food, amazing music and amazing drinks! Wow this place is great, one of my absolute favorites!! A few items that are a must: mac and cheese sticks, candied bacon, steak flatbread and the tacos. Oh, and if there is a cinnamon peach mule on the cocktail list, do not hesitate, order them by the dozen... best cocktail I have ever had. The waitress was lovey, very attentive and helpful. I will have a hard time going anywhere else when I am in be area.
2018-01-03,1,Having worked in the restaurant industry as server, bartender, floor manager and as executive management for over ten years, I never told a customer "no." Not once. Even with some of the less reasonable requests. That said, I have never been told "no" in the past as a customer either, until I went to the Ainsworth in Hoboken this past Sunday. I ordered a custom burger with carmelized onions, fried egg and gruyere cheese- all items they have in-house and use as toppings on their standard menu listed burgers. But, I could not order those individual items all on one burger as I was told no substitutions were allowed during brunch. Wow, ok. After also telling me "no," the GM gave me his card, and as some kind of empty and meaningless concession, told me to ask for him next time. "Next time?" Next time assumes I'll come back to spend more money, which I won't be. The time to address the issue of my reasonable request was THIS TIME, but they didn't. Edit: Original review was 10/19/15. Two years later and I still haven't gone back.
2018-01-02,5,Thank you Ainsworth for saving our New years and making it fun! They were nice enough to help us out since we had a problem with our tickets and allowed us to get in for a lower rate due to the mistake by the promotor. Also, everyone that worked there was so nice! Especially the bartender Anthony. He was so pleasant and really took care of us! Thank you again for all being so awesome and making sure our New Years didn't turn in to a disaster. I can not thank you again. Happy New Year to you all ! :)
2017-12-26,5,This is probably my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. They are open late and the food is great! The last time I was here, I was with my mom and her friend and we had a few drinks and the service was very good. I loved the view, very relaxing!
2017-12-08,4,Me and my friend decided to come here for happy hour.  On the website we saw that they have $1 oysters from 5pm - 7pm, so we decided to give it a try.  At first the waitress had no idea what we were talking about and said that they didn't offer that deal.  However,  the bartender saw what we were talking about on the website and honored the deal.  Aside from that ordeal the oysters were delicious, we got 2 dozen oysters.  We also got this appetizer called the mac'n cheese fries w/ marinara sauce.  This was probably the best dish of all.  Just imagine cheese sticks filled with mac'n cheese, it was awesome.  I would say that The happy hour specials weren't anything spectacular, but I would definitely come back for the food regardless.
2017-11-12,5,What an amazing Sunday Funday with friends! They have all the games on with a great menu. On Sundays they have a DJ playing during commercials and at half time which ads to the atmosphere. Definitely recommend it for brunch or Sunday Funday w the guys .... oh the Mac and cheese burger is to die for
2017-11-12,4,Food and service was very good.  Brussel sprouts are everything!  They are dog friendly too.  Restrooms and floors in general could use some sweeping.
2017-11-11,5,Fantastic location- best in Hoboken. Street parking available. great cocktails, and fabulous apps. Great for families for brunch, and dates/ friends during the week. Mac and cheese fries, shishito peppers, and the sliders are the bestHighly recommend.
2017-11-08,2,Went here with my boyfriend today around mid day & as soon as we sat down it was off to a bad start. On the table along with all fresh cutlery, is a glass with a clear lipstick mark on it- I never make things like this a big deal, mistakes happen BUT it became increasingly clear from here that there's a hygiene problem. The waitress gave me a new glass which was also cloudy and had something in it, along with  all the other cups on our table. My fork was dirty as well as my boyfriends & so we took them off the next table over & these too were dirty. Mac and cheese burger and the A burger were good but I couldn't help but feel uneasy about the cleanliness issue & won't return to this location because of it.
2017-10-28,3,The view of the New York skyline is absolutely gorgeous from here. Eat outside on a beautiful day and enjoy the fresh air and atmosphere of the big city. Food was good but not great. The service was slow but friendly. In all if you want an experience with food and a view this is a great place to eat.
2017-10-22,4,4 stars for the mac&cheese burger. There are a lot of imitators, but this one is foreal. Tried the one in Manhattan and recently the one in Hoboken. It is just addictive and satisfies a craving like no other. Ainsworth has a good selection of craft beer, and is a low key place to watch Sunday games without waiting in a 2 hour line like Wicked Wolf down the street.
2017-10-21,4,Went there last night. Got the Burata Burger and the watermelon sangria . My boyfriend got the Mac n cheese burger and a spicy drink. The fee shared the guac and chips. The food and drinks were so delicious! Everything was yummy. The drinks were to die for! However, the service was awful. We sat there for over 10 minutes before we had to ask the hostess to get our waitress. When she finally came, she took our appetizer, drink, and dinner orders and then we saw her once more for the entire meal. I understand being busy, but this place was not packed. The service could've been way better. It's a good thing the food and drinks were great.
2017-10-20,2,We had to fill up on the fries.  The wings appetizer arrived cold 25 minutes after ordering.  On the replacement, the temperature was fine but the chicken was rubbery.  My medium burger came very well with completely hard, charred bacon on top.  WIth so many places to eat in Hoboken, we won't be coming back anytime soon.  Two stars are because the wings were taken off our check.
2017-10-13,2,I should group all Ainsworth locations including NYC and Newark together for this review.  I was a fan of this establishment from the first visit at the Hoboken location, I ordered a delicious salmon with Brussels sprouts on the side. It was up there with one of the best Salmons I've ever eaten.  Well we decided to go back to Hoboken and the food wasn't as good the second time around but my biggest complaint is the disgusting bathrooms.  How can the kitchen and the staff be clean if the bathroom has broken seats, urine on the floor and no soap.  I just don't get it. This in and of itself is such a turn off that I will not return, not even for a drink.  I am very disappointed in all of the Ainsworth locations as I have been to all.  They really need to put the customer first, and please put some effort into a sanitary bathroom, my husband said the men's room was just as bad.It's a shame because it has a nice atmosphere!
2017-10-11,4,Let's start off with the mac and cheese burger. Let me tell you that is very delicious, but it could use more flavor or salt. Surprisingly, after eating it, I didn't feel that heavy. It was pretty light considering the photo makes it look like a heart attack. The fries were very crisp and well seasoned.  Now onto the service. With my burger and fries, I ordered a Shirley temple. Well unfortunately, I got more of a sprite with just a cherry instead of a Shirley temple. I politely asked for grenadine and my waitress politely said "I honestly put all that was left in the bottle." Mind you this is a Wednesday Night dinner with a group of friends. I found that my friend who ordered the same drink on the other side of table got much more cherry sauce in her drink. This is the middle of the week guys, I'm pretty sure all restaurant get their stock/food from the beginning to the middle of the week, in preparation for Friday and the weekend of course. To me it just didn't make sense that there was no cherry sauce/grenadine left. Anyways, overall I think the burger was great but overrated. Service was good, I just don't like lies.
2017-09-30,2,I've eaten at every Ainsworth location in NYC as well as this one in Hoboken many times and the last several visits to the different locations I was very disappointed. The service, food and cleanliness have gone downhill. While they aim to be a upscale sports bar and charge accordingly, I was disgusted when I went to use the bathroom and found it worse than any dive bar bathroom I've ever used. Worst of all this was not at 1am after a long night of partiers, it was at 6:00pm when the place was completely empty. It's very visible the place has not had a deep cleaning in months, I hate to think what the kitchen looks like. There burgers are usually awesome, last night it looked like they ran out of buns and ran to the store and bought the smallest cheapest store brand buns they can find. After my last several visits, it's clear the management is focused on expanding new locations and forgetting to maintain the quality of their current locations.
2017-09-26,5,I came here for a date with my wife and enjoyed everything very much.  The weather was perfect to seat outside.  To tell you the truth I had come with low expectations and was blown away at their food (tapas style).  Loved the steak, mac & cheese, shrimp & grits, even the dessert.  Looking forward to my next visit.
2017-09-16,5,My first impression of this place started off top notch, I analyzed the architectural structure of this restaurant and presumed that I couldn't go wrong with this establishment. I entered the property to a warm welcome and sat down with a proper server. I was glad to see that the menu offered an array of flavors for me to enjoy, and gladly ordered myself a burger. However, I realized that once this burger reached my presence, it wasn't up to the standard that I have originally imagined. The reason for this was because it was obviously not as cooked as I wanted it to be, and I felt that this wasn't up to my original expectations. However, a wonderful "baldish" server with hipster glasses rapidly deescalated the situation with his warm smile and hospitality. I couldn't have been happier with the service and the meal I received after the complaint. Big kudos to the ainsworth for their management and employees. I hope to expect this kind of professionalism for every customer that enters this restaurant. Best of luck to you all!
2017-09-16,5,I've been a customer at Ainsworth for a while, until recently I've felt like I can recommend to my friends, the atmosphere, the bartenders (Phil) the managers ( Leo) made me feel accommodated and comfortable.  There are many restaurants in Hoboken, but the view and the services is well worth taking a stroll on the boardwalk and having an amazing burger.
2017-09-10,4,I am always a little skeptical of the ever changing venue on this row.  We were 3 adults plus my 7yo on a Sunday afternoon.  We got seated pretty quickly.  The staff was pleasant, but the food service took a little while.  It proved to be worth it as the food was excellent.  Both the meat eaters and the vegetarian were satisfied.  A little expensive, but in line with other places on the Hudson waterfront.
2017-09-04,4,Pleasant environment looking out to the Hudson River. All the restaurants on River St. Are a bit pricey, but expected due to the location. Service was good. We dinned as vegans, and there were plenty of decent options. The veggie Patty was delicious, the highlight of our meal. A deep fried black bean and couscous, quinoa Patty with a sweet barbacue sauce, tomatoes and sauteed onion. The bun was a giant soft seeded roll. It's a hit. We also had the Mediterranean Couscous dish was was very disappointing. The ingredients were simple, including pearl couscous, spring mix salad and dries cranberries. The problem was the dryness. There was no sauce or dressing which made the dish bland and tasteless except for the sugar coated cranberries. I ordered the Crooked Knife tequila drink which was a delicious and spicy, lemon drink.
2017-09-04,5,Great burgers! Went here for brunch the other day with my friend and we had the mac and cheese burger delicious, can't recommend it enough. Great atmosphere, and our bartender Phil was really great. He suggested the burger and we weren't disappointed, definitely coming back!!  Would pick 10 stars if it was an option!
2017-08-28,1,This establishment is an absolute embarrassment and has the WORST service I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. I worked in a high end restaurant for 2 years and am very aware of the quality and standards of a good restaurant. We came to the Ainsworth last night (A Sunday) around 6:30/6:45 PM for a good friend's birthday. The restaurant inside had maybe 8 tables seated total and was practically almost empty with the exception of some tables outside. The waitress never came over to take our drink orders or even asked if we wanted something to drink. Our whole table of 10 people had to go up the the bar and get them there!! That's problem number 1. Then we could not find the waitress for the next 20 minutes. She never came over to check on us or ask us for our food orders after we got our appetizers for that duration of time. Our table was starving so I got up the hostess stand and ask for our server who finally comes by 10 minutes later and takes our orders. Everyone at our table orders simple burger orders and Myself and my friend finally ordered the Coke soda orders we wanted- which when they came were bizarrely 3/4ths of the way filled?? We were starving and kept asking anyone who worked at the restaurant and our waitress who was barely around when our food was coming out because it was already 30 mins since we ordered. Then we find her and she says it's coming out right now. 15 mins after she says that they come out and a bunch of us have problems with our orders and 3 didn't get their food. The food runner who was giving us our food kept staring at the food receipt and announced the orders but couldn't tell us or figure out which ones were cooked medium or medium rare. The receipts have seat numbers so you should know exactly what dish goes to whose seat- both the server and food runner had no clue what they were doing. Both him and our waitress who comes back over finally figure out whose dish goes to who after 3-4 minutes. Then I check out my burger and realize there is sauce all over it when I simply asked for no sauce. She then says- oh the sauce is light... um maybe there's a reason I asked for no sauce, I do not like it and don't want it so her saying that is like telling me to deal with it... she finally takes it back and I get a new burger 15 minutes later. On top of this, the birthday girl who also ordered the Mac and cheese burger never got here meal until 30 mins after we all got ours because they kept screwing up! That is unacceptable!! Also 2 other people at our table did not get what they ordered. They finally bring it out the girl says it's a Mac and cheese burger and we ask her to check and she says yes it is. She leaves we open the burger and there's no Mac and cheese and it is not the correct burger! Again we wait 15 more minutes for a new one to be made and the a girl who seemed to be the "manager" RUDELY comes over and says "here you go here's your burger!" in the most snotty tone and barely looks us in the eyes and then she's leaves and says in a nasty, fake voice, "have a great night!" Our whole table was shocked!!! I cannot believe the dysfunction of this place and the staff are absolutely awful. My entire table was fuming for the duration of our time here. This place was so bad they took at least $100+ off our bill and gave us a bunch of what we ordered for free plus a free round of shots. That's saying something. The food was mediocre with the exception of the appetizers we ordered and the birthday girl refused to touch her burger once she got it after waiting 60-70 minutes because she was so disgusted and lost her appetite. They took that off the bill as well.I'm sorry but the staff and service at this place is the worst I have ever seen in my life. I expected WAY better for the Ainsworth. The manager who finally brought out the Mac and cheese burger after all of the mix ups needs to be fired. Being rude to customers who pay a lot of money because YOUR staff is clearly not trained and had 10+ mix ups and mistakes is shocking to me. I'm telling everyone I know to not come here, that's how awful this experience was. Run from this place like the plague.
2017-08-27,2,Twelve minutes after being seated no one had visited our table, asked the bus boy and the hostess to send someone with no result. We left and went up a block to House of Que and had a much better experience.
2017-08-24,5,My roommates and I come here quite often, and its arguably the best burger in Hoboken. We LOVE everything about this place. Every single burger is absolutely terrific - the Classic Burger, Fried Mozzarella Burger and Caprese Burger are my favorites -  they come with delicious crispy fries. But my all time favorite is the Mac & Cheese Burger - only order this if you are really, really hungry, but it's absolutely DELICIOUS. Ainsworth has a great ambiance and energy. There's indoor and outdoor seating right near the water, and plenty of it which is not the norm in Hoboken. Be sure to stop by for dinner if you're in the area!
2017-08-21,3,I visited Ainsworth on a sunny Sunday afternoon, and got to sit in their outdoor area. Their view of the city is definitely a good positive, unfortunately their food left something to be desired. My girlfriend and I ordered a veggie burger and a vegetable sandwich to share so that we could both try them.The Veggie burger: the bun was wayyyyy too hard and crunchy for our taste. The homemade veggie burger itself was actually good, but they ruined it by pouring a ton of barbecue sauce on it to the point where that was all you could taste. The fries were good though! Albeit a touch over salted. The vegetable sandwich: loads better than the veggie burger, it came with grilled veggies, a fried piece of mozzarella (yum) and I think little bit of aioli (I think it was aioli? Hard to tell because there was any barely on it). The sandwich wasn't bad but it could've use something to add some flavor and some moisture as it was a little dry. Overall I probably will not be coming back, at least not to eat. Doesn't seem like a bad place to get a cold beer and enjoy the NYC skyline though!
2017-08-18,3,We had reservations at Blue Eyes Restaurant...long story short we walked in and walked right out. We ended up at the Ainsworth and we were pleasantly surprised by the energy and atmosphere. Fun music, great location, and kind waitstaff. Some outdoor seating available which overlooks the Hudson River walkway. Make sure your bladder is empty before you go because the bathroom resembled that of the same as a NYC subway bathroom.To start, we ordered the flatbreads. It was just flatbread nothing special. Next we ordered the Mac n cheese burger and the fried mozzarella burger which were both fabulous. Will definitely go back! :)
2017-08-06,5,Just had my daughters engagement party here.  Excellent!  Food was delicious. Service was fantastic.  They couldn't do enough for me. JoJo was the bartender and my go to girl.  She make everything go smoothly.   Great party. Great day!
2017-08-06,1,I got the classic burger cooked medium with a beer. The waitress was unreasonably slow. Like making errors and taking a very long time. It was Saturday at around 1 so I didn't understand why. We sat there for 18 minutes before getting water. Alright so slow but friendly. Ok. The burger was a big grease ball. The beef was thick but not well cooked. Best word i can think of to describe the meat is "watery". The bottom of the bun was soaked and deteriorating when it arrived. The bacon just got in the way. Honestly, you shouldn't need to dress it up. Burger sucked. But they do stick a knife through it vertically, serve it to you on a wooden plank, and charge you 16 or 18 bucks for it.  If that's where you get off, ignore this review and just go. I recommend the corona. Fries:  good
2017-08-04,1,Usually this place has been good. Went here the other day expecting another great experience and ordered chicken tostadas I think? Anyway, the chicken was all fat and my friend and I were about to throw up eating it. Don't order that.
2017-07-29,5,Came here on a Thursday afternoon to meet a friend for drinks.  The bartender, Phil, was very accommodating and made our happy hour every enjoyable.  If you're a child of the 80s/90s and love hip hop, you'll LOVE the playlist.  I highly recommend this bar to anyone looking to relax after work.  (I have not tried the food, so cannot comment on the menu)
2017-07-25,4,Love the decor/ambiance for dinner. Had a veggie burger that was decent, not the best or worst I've ever had. I would come back here again. Staff could be more attentive, my group came here on an empty night and it felt like no staff was here
2017-07-10,5,I would give this bar / restaurant an overall 5 stars. My boyfriend ordered the Classic Burger and I ordered the Veggie Burger. My Veggie Burger was one of the better veggie burgers I have had. There was nothing special about it but the honey BBQ sauce was awesome! As for the Classic Burger my boyfriend said it was great and a perfect example of a Classic Burger. He did wish it had shoe string fries but the Classic fries did the trick!I will be be back here for some drinks and maybe even try the fish tacos!
2017-07-09,3,Nothing beats drinking outside by the water on a Sunday afternoon except maybe if your drinking outside with your dog! We came to Ainsworth because we heard they were dog friendly and they have great seating with a view of the skyline. The restaurant offers several tables outside as well as a large dining space inside. When we got here at 3pm it was pretty packed. We got lucky and found the last table outside and got situated right away with our dog. I was happy to see that they provide water bowls for dogs as well.The menu offers a range of food items from your typical bar foods to something more hipster such as the avocado toast. My girlfriend and I opted for the fish tacos and onion burger. The price for each range from 13-15 bucks, not to bad for the area. The food itself tasted okay. The fish tacos were very average and nothing to rave about. It came with a sizable deep fried fish, topped off with a ton of pico de gallo and chipotle aioli. It also came smothered in avocado. I must say however that the 3 pieces were pretty large and I was very full by the end of the meal.Overall, I thought the food was very average. This spot is great for drinks as they offer outside seating with a nice view. Being dog friendly also wins extra points from me! I will definitely be back for drinks with my dog next time it's nice out.
2017-07-07,5,Service was great, food was great, I had the caprese burger and it was super good. I also had their midsummer mule which was surprisingly good as well! The only thing is that the burgers aren't, like, SUPER big. It was a perfect size for me since I'm a smaller female but my boyfriend typically is still just the slightest bit hungry after one. If you have a larger stomach capacity, I would recommend getting an appetizer but that's really the only critique I would have.
2017-07-04,2,When we first walked in we tried to sit down at the bar, but the bartender had three seats saved for her friends. After, we were able to find a seat, we then proceeded to order our normal Astor Fizz. We both received our drink 1/2-3/4 full, which for $14, is very disappointing. What made us even more upset was seeing her friends cocktails freshly poured to the top. Very upsetting and unacceptable. This is not our first visit, but it may be our last.
2017-07-04,1,After being seated and waitress took order, waited over 20 minutes before drinks came despite sitting on bar for 15 minutes. Drinks warm from sitting. Asked waitress twice for water and bottle of  Voss was dropped at table while everyone else was getting table water. When I gave bottle to hostess and she spoke to waitress the hostess rolled her eyes and walked away. We paid for drinks and told waitress to cancel food order. Second time here, never again. Go to Hoboken BBQ or Pilsner House when in Hoboken for excellent food and service. Skip Ainsworth.
2017-07-01,4,I came here to try the mac and cheese burger and it was really good. The restaurant is a little too loud for me so I don't know if I would go back unless I really wanted a mac and cheese burger.
2017-06-30,5,Three Words: Mac & Cheese BurgerIt's like if Beethoven made a symphony, but with flavor.
2017-06-25,5,I tried this place for the first time! And my waitress was awesome I ordered avocado toast and 2 eggs over medium. The eggs were over done but I'm not one to say anything, so the waitress noticed and asked and brought me new eggs, the food and as great and drinks were awesome. Great service !
2017-06-24,5,Super nice. Come at 9 for the best table options Saturday night and stay for drinks. The view to the boardwalk is perfect. Review of the food to come...Cool aatmosphere for a great dinner on a Saturday night to hang out with your boyfriend or husband!!!
2017-06-11,1,Quite disappointed in this place. On a 90 degree day, there was no AC or fans indoors. The bathroom was full of flies and the toilets were overflowed onto the floor. The glasses and plates were dirty. After asking for new glassware a few times and not getting them, we left.
2017-06-05,4,Food great. (Classic Burger) Service attentive.  Drinks (Mr. Moore) yummmyyy!!!!!!! Overall had fun.
2017-05-30,5,Entertained about 25 guests in the Back Bar area and the party was a huge success.  Open bar and served appetizers which were bought out with even consistency - no one went home hungry! The mac and cheese balls were a huge hit as were the grilled shrimp and the sliders.  The service was very attentive and the space completely adequate for the size of our party.  Highly recommend this restaurant!
2017-05-21,2,Basically don't go here unless you really have to... Currently sitting at the Ainsworth. It looks nice outside and food smelled good. I was hesitant in eating here since last time I came it took forever to get service. We have been sitting here for 20 to 25 minutes and have yet to order. I guess don't come here if you're starving.. Not only that but the plates and utensils are dirty. The glass I had was disgusting, the waitress said they didn't clean it... the plates had salt and etc on them and the utensils were gross we had to clean them.I ordered the frozen pink lemonade mule and then 15 minutes later she tells me it's too frozen and if I wanted to wait.. would have been nice to know that sooner so I could have ordered something else. So then I got the watermelon sangria it was okay at best ($10)I got the Veggie burger ($16) and my boyfriend got the BBQ pulled pork ($15). The food came in 10 minutes which I was surprised. The food came faster than we were able to order. It was just ordinary. I didn't even finish it, I was still starving when I left. The service is terrible even though they weren't busy. I'm not surprised a lot of people don't come here. Bad service, expensive food that taste only okay, not the best place to go to eat. I saw people leave after waiting a while, that was probably a good idea.
2017-05-20,1,I did not have a good experience here. From being seated to being served, the communications felt impolite. The food was not great either. There are better places nearby that I will prefer henceforth.
2017-05-19,5,I've been here twice now and loved it both times. It's a very casual place with a very casual menu but what makes the difference is that they do everything so well. The Cobb is not groundbreaking but exactly as described and absolutely delicious. So is the vinaigrette. The burger was done exactly as it should be. The French fries - crispy, hot, beautiful color and perfectly seasoned. Service is great. Spot on. My new favorite Hoboken restaurant.PS -- Went for lunch again today. Excellent!
2017-05-17,3,I don't like giving bad reviews but I was very disappointed by my last experience at the Ainsworth in Hoboken. It was a Tuesday night and there were only 3 tables occupied in the dining room yet our food (3 salads and a pizza appetizer) took forever. The pizza came cold and the salads were luke warm. To make matters worse, they had a DJ in the back hosting a trivia night for 2 patrons. We had to listen to this guy talk into a microphone nonstop for 2 hours. He literally never stopped talking. It ruined the vibe of our night and was really annoying. To the credit our our waitress, who was really great, she had the kitchen remake the pizza (which was still awful) and ended up taking it off our bill. I've been here many many times and usually have very good experiences but last night was terrible and I wonder what's going on over there.
2017-05-16,3,Came here on a weekday night to blow off some steam from the week, and we were informed upon sitting that the kitchen would be closing in five minutes. After which at least two more people tried to take our food orders, within the span of 60 seconds. We finally were brow beaten into ordering the hottest shishito peppers I've ever had the misfortune of eating - I finished one, and somehow my friend stomached two before calling it quits. This combined with poorly mixed drinks (mine was way too sweet and my friend's was way too strong, like you could've probably lit a match in it strong) made for a rather unpleasant experience.At least the view of Manhattan is nice.
2017-05-13,5,I came here on Thursday night with some girlfriends who were in town. It was the perfect place to catch up, but still had a really great bar vibe. The bartender was super friendly and had great recommendations for some appetizers. He made great cocktails and was really nice and made an effort to make us feel welcome and have a conversation with us. My friends were really pleased with my pick! I will definitely be back!
2017-05-09,1,I'm a good tipper and tend to leave far more good reviews than bad, but I had literally the rudest experience with a bartender that I've ever had.  I'm won't bother to rehash, but she was so crass, rude, and unclassy that my friends and I chugged our drinks (after waiting for them for 20 minutes) so that we could just leave and end our night early.  Stay away from the very chubby bartender with unkempt brown hair.
2017-05-07,5,Great birthday Brunch.  The service was wonderful.  Food was delicious.  Thanks to Ashley and Eileena for their graciousness!
2017-05-02,4,Came in to enjoy the beautiful weather in their outdoor bar that over looks the water.  Ordered the fried Mozzarella burger.  Not sure if that's what it was called, but regardless it was delicious.  Moist and well cooks.  The fries were pretty Normal fries, but that burger!  Yummy!  Will be back to try more of the menu when it warms up
2017-04-28,2,The food and drinks are great, but the service is AWFUL. Not sure who they employ here but they have no sense of urgency and not enough bar tenders at the bar.  The runners and bus boys are amazing- however the other staff is embarrassing. Whoever owns this place, get a better manager and workers. #pathetic
2017-04-21,4,Decided to spend a few hours here to watch the playoffs. We tried the fish tacos and ribeye steak which were delicious! Drink menu is ok but I wish they had a bigger selection. I was hoping for bigger tvs and live sound but it's rare to find a bar that actually chooses to play sound over music. Overall, satisfied. Definitely will be stopping by again when it gets a bit nicer since it's right by the Hudson.
2017-04-16,4,Decent outdoor seating... Good cocktails... decent music... great location but food can be better
2017-04-04,3,Not my favorite spot of all time but fine for grabbing a drink. Came here on a Sunday for lunch and music was waaay too loud for lunch time in the main dining room. Fine for a sports bar but not what I was expecting here.
2017-04-03,2,Came here on a Sunday afternoon with two others even though the reviews on here aren't that great. We went around 2 in the afternoon and the restaurant was steady but I wouldn't describe it as busy. We were seated immediately due to the many open tables yet our order wasn't taken for a solid thirty minutes, even though we asked TWICE for our waitress. After our waitress eventually came over her response was "sorry no one told me I got seated" Shortly after us the table next to us was seated, served, and left before we even had our food. The food took forever to get to us and even though it was good, wasn't worth the wait or the price. If i'm going to be paying almost $20 for a burger I would like to not have to wait for over an hour on a non-busy day to receive it. After eating we had to wait another half hour for our check? When we got our check it was wrong, there was other people's food items on it which took another fifteen minutes to get fixed. When she came back to give us the right check we were throwing our credit cards at her praying we would be able to get out of there soon. Throughout the entire time we were there I never saw our waitress serve a table around us, she was constantly missing and lacked attention. The entire experience was just a big long wait. The food was delicious and if it wasn't for the awful service I would have liked to go back but i'm not willing to have to dine for almost three hours for a hamburger. Due to the horrible service, I would not recommend this place to anyone which is unfortunate because the food was pretty decent, not worth the wait in the slightest. I would hate to go here at a busy time.
2017-04-03,5,Love this place! I have been back here several times now and have never been disappointed. The burgers are incredible and will set the bar high for every one that you eat after your visit, my personal favorites are the mac&cheese burger as well as the hanger steak burger.        In my most recent visit, my friends and I went to enjoy some food, drinks, and watch the NCAA tournament. Aleksandra took excellent care of us and was very accommodating to any and all of our requests (changing the channel on the tv to watch a certain game, beer refills, multiple rounds of entres and appetizers). She's very patient and kindso we did not feel rushed and ended up spending hours there.        Whether you're looking for a good night out with friends or a nice setting and location for a date, I definitely recommend giving the Ainsworth a try, they've been nothing but good to me so far
2017-04-02,2,I want to note that this review is for the brunch.  My husband and I have eaten dinner here and the food/service was a million times better.  It is also why I am giving the place a 2 star (otherwise i would give 1 star).  It pains me a bit to give this review.  Brunch is completely pack and maybe the restaurant can't handle that amount of people. We sit down, and the first thing we get is a bottle of water.   I am not sure why.. but the tap water tasted TERRIBLE .  She had to come back and give us a new bottle of water. This time the water was fine.  We got the guacamole and it tasted as if the avocado was not ripe enough (we didn't complain).  However, I order the egg white vegetarian omelette and she gave me a meat entree instead (i don't eat meat).  When I told her I got the wrong item.. instead of being apologetic the waitress was completely rude (like it was my fault the kitchen got my completely meal wrong).I did not get my meal until after my husband finished the meal.  Plus, the spinach in my omelette was frozen (I still didn't complain).   At this point I just wanted to leave because I was so frustrated.   Of course I asked for the check twice and she did not bring it out.   I also think waitress should have taken my omelette off the bill since it took an extra 20 minutes to come out.
2017-03-24,5,First time here! The food was amazing and the service was amazing! Really cool ambience! I will definitely be coming here more often!
2017-03-24,1,This is a piece of shit place with a piece of shit staff and management. We ordered drinks which took 45 minutes and when they came, they were all wrong which took another 20 min to fix. The server messed up drink orders multiple times, messed up food orders as well. When we asked for the manager, the guy comes out all rude and slammed our drinks on the table when he served us. Everything is overpriced, but that doesn't make up for the service at all. Never go here
2017-03-22,1,I'd give this place a 0 star rating if it was possible. I went with a few friends on a Tuesday evening around 7:30pm. After getting our table, the waitress took our drink orders which we did not get for another 45 minutes after. When we did finally get them, the waitress got the drink orders completely wrong. We let her know and she acknowledged and confirmed she would get us the right drinks promptly. Another 20 minutes pass by with still no drinks. We finally get them and they're the wrong drinks, AGAIN. We inform her and she replaces them again. Wait for the surprise - it's the same wrong drinks, for a 3rd time. At this point, we ask for a manager, who RUDELY comes over, picks up the drinks and brings back the correct ones. Slams the cups on the table and walks away without acknowledging that there are any problems or anything. Also took close to 45 minutes for the food to be served. Food wasn't even good quality either.Horrible service, overpriced food for crazy high prices. Definitely will never be back here again.
2017-03-21,1,By far the worst place me and my friends went to eat. My friends got engaged by the park, and we picked this place to eat out of all the places in the area..Out of 8 guest of mine nobody was satisfied. They continued to bring us the wrong drinks every round, we asked to speak to management and he gave us a attitude and slammed our alcoholic beverages. I asked for sauce on the side of my wings twice. They kept forgetting to bring my friends appetizers as we kept reminding them. The waitress forgot our sodas as well. I would never send any of my friends here.... Step it up management!
2017-03-16,4,Came here with some girlfriends for a quick bite before heading to the city. Tried the new menu. Portions were pretty good and so was the service. We sat at the bar and let the bartender Leo or Geo (not sure the name) help us out. He was really attentive and helpful with the menu. The only thing that stopped us from completely loving the space was the wait staff that kept going up to the service bar and complaining about their tables. I mean really complaining. We kept staring at them wondering if they realized we could hear them loud and clear. On an up note for the bartender kept asking them to keep it down and that they can talk about it more later. All in all good experience!
2017-03-16,5,Went to dinner on a Wednesday night for my friends birthday.  The waitress was patient as we sat for a long time just talking, which can be frustrating as a server, but she didn't seem to mind. I got the caprese burger which was amazing!! My friend got the French onion burger which she also said was amazing! Would definitely go back again.
2017-03-10,2,Sat at the bar on the weekday evening and encountered a myriad of problems.  - I ordered a margarita ($14) and the bartender didn't even fill the glass up to the top, and put a gigantic ice cube in the small glass so it amounted to only a few sips.- Served beer in a chipped glass- Bartender kept leaving the bar and acted like us ordering was an inconvenience to him- Charged my credit card $70 for tip instead of $7.Will definitely not be going back here.
2017-03-09,1,Food was sub par , service was horrible, and the hostess's were completely unprofessional. Unacceptable for an establishment like this.
2017-03-07,5,I come here often. They recently changed their menu but my favorites like the Mac and cheese burger are still there, thankfully. They also have some really good speciality drinks.
2017-03-03,4,I came to eat dinner here on a friday night with my friend.. the parking was impossible but i mean, its always like that around this area of hoboken. when we walked in, there was no wait which is pretty good for a friday night(I HATE WAITING). the waitress was super friendly.. she gave us a drink menu right away to start off the night. the drinks were pretty good.. not watered down. here starts the food critique.. so whatever you do, dont order a salad in this place. i totally regretted it as soon as i saw the salad come.. i dont remember which salad i was but just didnt like it at all. so the fish tacos are DEELISH!!! i definately reccomend it. i ordered the mac & cheese burger & it was also REALLY tasty. for dessert, the waitress offered like this crazy dessert that was a mix of a whole bunch of stuff but we were so full from all the food that we just got an order or churro waffles with ice cream.. & i def. made the right choice. it was also very delicious. overall, its a really cool spot but the parking is annoying and the dessert choices are limited. i would come here again..
2017-03-01,1,Took over an hour and a half to get our lunch and we were the only table there, besides two other people. We even had a reservation. They claimed it was because of our large group. I understand 16 people is a lot but at lunchtime in an empty restaurant? What do they do on weekends? When the food came out it was lukewarm. I asked for the pulled pork burger, which was not a burger but a pulled pork sandwich. Don't call it a burger then, call it what it is. I thought it would be burger with pork in the mixture. I took one bite and half the meat came out of the roll. My co-workers burger was the size of a hockey puck. I thought this place was known for it's burgers?Also, after waitress brought some of our food around, she said "Can I get anyone anything else?" Two of use said "Yeah, our lunch." She then proceeded to give us the whole "I only have two hands" excuse. Well, I understand that but don't say to the table "Can I get you anything else?" if you aren't finished serving the food! We also tried waving over two waitresses who clearly couldn't miss a table of 16 people and who proceeded to walk right by us. All in all a very infuriating experience for so-so food. The waitress did take 10% off the tab for the wait, which was nice of her. But I think we deserved it after the service we got.
2017-02-24,2,It's the Hoboken Ainsworth...automatically lower your standards. My BF and I have been to this location several times and with each passing meal, the service gets worse and worse. Avoid Aleksandra's section at all costs. I try to give servers the benefit of the doubt, but she literally could care less about customer service or waiting on her tables in a timely fashion. Now I'm sure you're wondering, why return to an establishment if the service is that bad? My response: the food has always been pretty good. The straw that broke the camels back this time? The menu changed. The spinach and artichoke dip is gone and the shrimp tacos are also gone. I tried ordering the fish tacos and they did not have fish (on a Friday during peak dinner time, really?). Alcoholic beverages were also subpar. Ordered a Mr. Monroe and the second round didn't have Bulleit Bourbon in it. It tasted like bottom shelf Bourbon. I sent it back and our server returned with the same drink with the berries repositioned. Bourbon lovers know their Bourbon. I left the drink untouched on the table. Bottom line: spend your money somewhere else. The Cuban has amazing service and great food. It's three block up on Washington.
2017-02-19,2,Terribly understaffed, after being seated waited 20 minutes just to see a menu. Drinks took forever to arrive and my 10.00 glass of wine had about two ounces of wine in it. When we mentioned it to the waitress, she very rudely said "that's our pour". The food was good but too expensive for what it was. Wouldn't spend 18.00 again for a burger that took an hour to arrive, with such unpleasant service.
2017-02-19,1,I was seated for brunch right away and then waited for twenty minutes without anyone acknowledging me. I attempted several times to make eye contact or flag someone down for water and coffee. Every staff member walking by tried very hard to avoid me. I finally left and went to a place down the street.
2017-02-10,5,I was recommended this place by a friend and didn't know what to expect, but the food was great and had a warm atmosphere. The service was amazing! Our server Martina was excellent and came to our table and made us feel welcomed.
2017-02-10,5,Visiting Hoboken from Toronto and staying at the W hotel around the corner.. Stopped into Ainsworth to have a drink and ended up staying and ordering food.. The oysters were just as good as the service was!! Martina who served us was very attentive and made sure we were never wanting anything. We had a great experience and would definitely come back next time me and my girlfriend are back in Hoboken..
2017-02-10,4,This place is awesome it's my Friday night choice the mac and cheese burger is to die for ! Also the bartender Martina was amazing super attentive, funny, and showed us a good time. Also, the drinks were amazing she did a great job I'll be back again!
2017-02-04,3,Classy and spacious interior, decent food, decent service. Our water was never refilled but they did come around for drink orders. I ordered the classic burger medium rare. It came fairly well done but it was still not terrible. Bacon was not flavorful nor was there much. Fries great but comes with very little ketchup. Nice view outside, great location. I'd go back if I were around, but it was kind of loud to have good conversation. Best thing all night is when they put a rocket candle on our friend's bday cake--flame was almost a foot high!
2017-01-21,4,Great location - we were able to sit against the garage doors in the front of the restaurant and get a view of the city. We started with beers and an appetizer of blistered peppers - very light and tasty. For dinner I ordered the French onion burger and my boyfriend got the Ainsworth burger with added burrata. Ainsworth burger was out of this world good!!! We ordered a side of their famous Mac and cheese and there wasn't anything famous about it - really lacking in a unique flavor. Service was good. Overall would go back for burgers - skip the Mac and cheese.
2017-01-09,4,We had a great Sunday funday yesterday here ! The drinks are strong and not too expensive , the musics great & the crowd . It deff did get crowded but we like that . The food was OK , I've def had better wings but that's okay it's not going to stop me from comming back here :) ! My husband and I will be back for another Sunday football before the seasons over !!
2017-01-08,3,Mostly ok, nothing to brag about except the location.  Tasty hamburgers, boring appetizers and underwhelming bar items.  Slow service and slightly dirty tables.  Hard to have a conversation with my friends visiting from Italy, who also did not really enjoy their greasy meals.   Just average.
2017-01-04,5,My friend and I were looking for places to eat in Hoboken, so I decided to find places on yelp. I ran across Ainsworth, and we decided to give it a try. As soon as we walked in, I felt some good vibes. Nice dim lighting, cool music, and friendly hostess. We sat down, I ordered a Bloody Mary, and looked at. Good selection or burgers! My friend and I both ordered the same burger (Forgot what it was called.) we were very impressed. The fries we really good and our server was really nice. Unfortunately, we came on a rainy day, so We couldn't enjoy the beautiful skyline. I'm from Texas, and next time I come into jersey I will definitely be back!
2016-12-30,1,Myself and my family came in here for Christmas Eve dinner. We had requested the private room as we had a party of 8-10 people coming. They called us back to request that we come in earlier on Christmas Eve (assuming that they wanted to close earlier) we happily obliged. Our reservation was now at 530. We had an 11 month old with us and arrived 8 minutes late. We were greeted by the rudest hostess I have ever come across who tells me that she cancelled our reservation because we were 45 minutes late...surprising since we kindly came in earlier to accommodate the restaurant and were in fact 8 minutes passed 530pm. She seats us in the main dining room, when I mentioned that we had requested the private room she said you can't sit there because of a leak...we happily obliged again. She stomped off to chit chat with the bar tender and ignored us completely. We waited and waited for a server. We finally ordered and unfortunately what arrived to the table was luke warm mediocre food, my roast chicken was so salty it was inedible. I passed by the private dining room on the way to the bathroom and found that there was no leak at all just a room completely cluttered with Christmas decorations. We would have happily sat in the main dining room there was no need to lie. Overall this was a horrible Christmas Eve experience and I will never be coming back to this place again!
2016-12-27,3,Not ever super thrilled with the food. The buffalo cauliflower appetizer is awesome. Cobb salad not so much. Bathrooms are always dirty when the place isn't even busy? Nice ambiance, decent drink menu
2016-12-11,4,My group tried about half of the burger offerings, all left satisfied. Juicy without being greasy. Service was prompt, and the cocktails were decently liberal.    I would return.
2016-12-02,4,Great burger.   Awesome cocktails.  One of the best cocktail bars in town.   Go in the summer and enjoy a awesome view as well.
2016-11-30,2,#Review 300Sorry Ainsworth, but I came here for an 11 am brunch and felt I was in a loud nightclub at 11 pm!   The place is really really LOUD and while the food is fairly okay, everything else leaves much to be desired. I was sitting at our table for nearly 20 minutes twiddling my thumbs and waiting for my friend to arrive and multiple servers walked by trying to avoid eye contact or ask if I wanted water/drinks.  Finally I had to flag down someone & ask who would be assisting us. Very poor first impression. I had the fish special (mahi mahi) sandwich of the day and my friend had the staple egg white omelet. The sandwich was strictly okay and the fish wasn't very fresh... right of the bat I knew it was something that came out of the freezer & was deep fried on the spot. Meh.I can see the merits of this place in summer with the spectacular view from their outdoor patio....I will avoid it in winter though and stick to some other local spots with better food and service.
2016-11-23,4,A good pick if you are looking for a sports bar atmosphere but also want some quality eats. Ainsworth has got a pretty extensive menu with a variety of burgers, tacos, and small and shareable plates. The menu is a bit pricier than your average sports bar (15 dollar burgers and 12 dollar wings). But, The Ainsworth is also classier than your average sports bar. The interior decor is chic, think long reclaimed wood tables, chandeliers and decorative wallpaper. During football Sunday, it's an absolute party here. The house is completely packed out and they bring in DJs, shot girls and bottle service- the whole nine. I wasn't expecting much because the vibe initially seemed to be more party than quality food, but I actually really enjoyed my wings. They were some of the better buffalo wings that I've had in the Hoboken / JC area. Perfectly crunchy, and not too spicy but still a generous amount of flavor. I also ordered the mozz sticks (off the menu, you have to ask) and those were just okay.I'll take a star off because our service was a little wonky. She brought out the wrong beer and the wrong menu items with no apology. The host was also kind of snarky about sitting us right away when there were plenty of empty tables. I feel like they have this idea that they need to make you work for a seat on a Sunday, and that was a little off-putting. Jersey City does not have many sports bars, so when I'm looking for a place to watch the game out it's usually O'Haras or Hoboken. Ainsworth has definitely been, and will continue to be in the rotation when I venture over to Hoboken. And I'm not mad about it!
2016-11-21,4,Great cocktails, for sure. I always find parking easy in the area between 5:30-7:00, so dinner here even if you come from a drive away can be a great choice. Lovely walk too if you want that before or after. Friendly service, but it can get slow if they're busy. Food has limited options, and probably only gets 3 stars. But I come for the drinks, which can be pricey, but well worth it. The crowd is also decent. Not rowdy, but not snooty either. I like the mix of locals and visi
2016-11-16,5,Excellent staff, excellent food, and a very nice place. We had a huge party of 15 and the service was quick and delightful. It's right on the Hoboken waterfront, and during brunch, which is fantastic btw, the view is great. I can't wait to go back!
2016-11-14,5,I see a lot of mixed reviews but I have to leave a good one. We had a group gathering to celebrate a special occasion and when way more people than expected showed up, the manager Shawn was awesome and accommodated us without hesitation. The hostesses were really great and the server was too. This day could have been a disaster but turned out to be a great day. By the way the burger was really good too. Thanks Shawn (sorry if not spelled right) and thanks Ainsworth.
2016-11-13,2,High hopes for this brunch considering i've been to Ainsworth NYC locations. Brunch deal ends at 1pm - which is far too early. Afterwards, our guests had to order off dinner menu. This is not conducive to the habits of a brunch crowd. Also, my breakfast burrito was lackluster to say the least. It was small and nothing about it screamed 'burrito' other than the tortilla it was wrapped in. Waitress had to be reminded several times of correct order for our table and wasn't very accommodating to our birthday girl. 2 stars instead of 1 because the drink specials last all day and they allow modifications to the mimosas (e.g. cranberry vs. OJ). Disappointing compared to NYC Ainsworth experience.
2016-11-13,5,so happy with this place!  they were able to accommodate my large party of 15 last minute after things fell through at another restaurant.  the server was so sweet and the food was so delicious. definitely recommend it for brunch!
2016-10-27,1,I ordered off of Seamless. The bone-in ribeye for 46. It was delivered cold, with three onion rings. The steak had no bone...and was extremely fatty. This was the worst steak at the worst price. Never again. If you think it's dumb I ordered a bone in ribeye for delivery - that's fair - but I previously ordered the Tomahawk Ribeye from the Madison and it was fantastic and delivered hot...so...there. I supplemented this terrible meal with a bowl of frosted mini wheats.
2016-10-22,4,Very comfortable atmosphere.. liked the choice of being able to dine in doors as well as outdoors. Service was very good .. Food was as very good although menu was limited. Solid choice of drinks as well as a variety of beers... Enjoyed my microbrew although it could've been a little colder. I would definitely consider going back again.
2016-10-17,5,My favorite bar/restaurant for a Tuesday night! The trivia my doug is witty and hilarious. We had three best night. And the TACOS OH THE TACOS!!!
2016-09-11,1,Terrible service, super loud. My 17 dollar caprese salad was a huge pile of quinoa with some tomatoes sprinkled on top. Never coming back.
2016-09-03,4,Went to dinner here last night and sat outside. I ordered an old fashion that was made perfectly. I also ordered the Burrata Burger, which might have been one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was cooked to perfection, it had a buttery, juicy taste and had a ton of burrata. My friends had been here many times before and ordered a chicken sandwich and the onion burger. We also ended up ordering the warm cookie with ice cream for dessert. The menu must have recently changed because his cookie was Huge and had toasted marshmallows on it. Just sooo yummy!Definitely will be going back to try more of their burgers.
2016-08-31,1,Absolutely awful service - I've given this place THREE tries now (more than I should have) and it's been one terrible experience after another.Most recently, I went there with 6 for brunch (we were one of maybe 3 tables in the place )... And our drinks took 25 minutes to get.25 minutes!!!Not only that - but the waitress checked back to let us know multiple times that our drinks "still aren't ready, the bartender is a little slow".The bartender was totally out of it - Everything was happening in slow mo.We honestly thought it was a joke.We got our FOOD before the drinks (food wasn't great either).when the drinks finally came we asked to speak with a manager at which time we were told "the managers not here yet... I can text her if you want?"What kind of operation are they running ? It's such a shame because the space is so great and the Ainsworth in the city is great.Don't waste your time here - walk a block down and go to Del Friscos Grill.
2016-08-25,5,Great food. Fish tacos are great. They always have different burgers and they are all so good. Mac and cheese burger is a classic. So good and juicy. The burrata burger is also one of my favorites. The cocktails are also really good.
2016-08-22,1,Came here to watch my friend do the burger challenge and to grab some lunch for myself. To start they changed the allotted time of the challenge from 45 min to 30 min the day he decided to do it....... So we were pretty pissed off about that.For lunch I ordered the chicken avocado cobb salad. What was brought out to me was not a salad by any stretch. It was just quinoa, chicken and avocado with a small side of dressing. No lettuce or greens of any kind on my plate. Needless to say I was very disappointed in the deception of the menu. I will not be returning here.
2016-08-19,5,Great location, vibe, and service. I had hosted my friends bridal shower here on a Thursday night since she lives in Hoboken and our guests can easily walk from the path. We had a group of 10 girls and we were able to book their private little area in the back. The room was perfect for our size and more. We were able to have our privacy for the bridal shower games. From start to finish the service was amazing. Jen was very attentive and made sure our group had a great time. The food was really good. We ordered the pretzel crusted chicken fingers as an app and it was OMG delicious. The burgers were unique and amazing as well especially the Mac and cheese burger. Overall all the girls had an amazing time and thought the service was great. We would definitely host another party here again.
2016-08-13,3,Had wanted to try the restaurant for a while. My wife and I went for lunch on Sunday. Overall we had a good experience. The service was a bit slow to start which was a bit disappointing considering the restaurant wasn't the that busy. The food was good. My only  complaint was the portions were lame. I ordered the blackened Mahi and got a very small piece of fish. My wife had a burger and enjoyed it.
2016-08-10,4,I love everything mac and cheese sooo of course I got the mac and cheese burger. Super good, its layered with a fried mac cheese bite, burger, and topped with mac and cheese. Disappointed because advertising pictures more mac and cheese than what I got but cool. My friend got the pizza burger which was good, nothing too great. Really spacious place with a bar. Right on the river, beautiful view of NY at any time of the day.
2016-08-09,2,It was empty when we came in yet it still took a while to have our order taken and the server was a bit rude. Food was mediocre. It's not expensive, but it's also not cheap... all in all, I don't see the point in going back unless it's for a happy hour (no food!)
2016-08-05,2,The food is decent.  Nothing out of this world or earth shatteringly amazing. But the service is terrible. I have been here two times and both times the service has been completely subpar. From the time we sat down it took us almost an hour to get our food and our second round of drinks took almost 20 minutes.  In total we were there for two hours for one course. We had neither appetizers nor dessert. My brother ordered a burger with cheddar and bacon and a burger came out with just cheese on it.  At which point he was told they do not make modifications to their menu items. If that was the case, (which I don't know why it would be) the waitress should have informed him of that when he was ordering.  It took another 25 minutes to get the check and actually pay because our waitress was nowhere to be found.  We almost missed our train home because it took so long. All of this happened when they weren't even full to capacity. There were many open tables around us. There is no excuse for this complete lack of courtesy and regard for people's time. I would never choose to spend my money here again.
2016-07-30,4,Went on a Saturday evening for dinner.  Was seated promptly and the atmosphere is very hip and trendy.  Ordered the bang bang burger and my wife ordered the mac & cheese burger.  The burgers get an A for their composition.  The burger meat and bun are both average, but when you add all of the other ingredients you get a very good burger.  The only reason that this place isn't getting 5 stars is that our server was very slow and pretty much vanished after our food came out.  We shouldn't have to hunt you down to get refills on our drinks or to pay the check.  I'd be interested to try their dessert when they release the dessert menu.  Hopefully next time the servers are more attentive.
2016-07-23,1,We stop for lunch at Ainsworth  Hoboken and it was big dissapoited Basic food,  the chicken wings are disgusting! One star for the location.
2016-07-17,4,I had dinner here the other night. The food was great, the atmosphere was nice. I definitely recommend the patio which overlooks the NY skyline / waterfront. The breeze and warm summer night, combined with the food and drink made everything that much better!
2016-07-17,1,Went for brunch  awed ultimate service we were the onl u people  in there  and  we never  saw waitress  after we set down, and the food was horrible, I had the bicuts and gravy ,it was grease stale bicuts and hard  boiled eggs
2016-07-15,3,The view is spectacular, but the food is nothing to write home about. Had the fish taco's... they were ok, but again nothing special. Doubt I'd go back unless to just have a beer and enjoy the view. Plenty of great places in Hoboken..
2016-06-24,5,Great experience, awesome lunch menu.Got 2 lovely shrimp tacos and a pretty large salad all for $12?!?!.Awesome deal, and got to watch Portugal v Hungary and Iceland v Austria.And i ordered lovely oysters on the half shell.Great deal, great option for lunchGREAT view!!
2016-06-18,2,Very disappointed with this place. We walked in mid-afternoon, the outside tables were full so we assumed it the place must be good, but once inside we could attribute the outside crowd to be due to the amazing weather rather than the location, because the inside was relatively empty. Even though the the inside was empty we were sitting down for at least 10 minutes before we even got water. My boyfriend ordered a beer and the fish tacos, and I ordered a mojito and brunch nachos. The drinks came quickly, and the mojito was pretty good. So two stars for the bartender and for the waitress because she was okay too. But once the food came I knew there was trouble. My nachos were drowned in sour cream.  The sour cream wasn't mentioned on the menu, otherwise I would've known to order without it. I tried excavating through them to eat the things I like, but hey had missed the bacon which was mentioned on the menu. Once pointed out I was brought a plate of bacon, but the nachos were already non edible. My boyfriend's fish tacos, were a little disappointing too. The fish did not taste very fresh.
2016-06-17,5,Our first time at the Ainsworth in Hoboken was awesome! Food was amazing. Highly recommend the hangar steak burger. Soo good. Service was great as well! Our server Lindsay was fantastic. She was very attentive and extremely friendly! We will absolutely be back!
2016-06-17,3,I came here for a relaxed work dinner with about 9 colleagues. I was not super impressed with the food here, but they did have a wide variety of fun burger combinations and definitely had space to accommodate a large group. To start, we ordered a little of everything. The buffalo cauliflower was my favorite and if you ever come here, you have to try it!! They also had really good tuna tartare, and the chips that they served it were killer too. As my main course, I had the burrata burger. It was only okay. The bottom of the burger was really soggy which made it hard to eat cleanly. The burrata itself was good, and I actually ended up eating just that and not the burger/bun.Half of the group ordered the mac and cheese burger, and they seemed overall happy with their choice but it was a bit heavy. Definitely has a fun bar vibe, and bar food. I just wasn't impressed in the sit down dinner aspect of it but would come back to watch a game or grab a few drinks on a Sunday!
2016-06-14,3,I made a reservation on Open Table at 7:30am for 12:00 that afternoon, but I didn't need it. All of the outdoor seating was occupied when I arrived, but since my friend wasn't there yet I elected to wait for a table outside. The hostess was really sweet and accommodating; she said it might be 30 minutes for a table outside, but two actually became available within 10 minutes and because we had a stroller, she brought me outside to ask which table would be better for us, which was much appreciated. I had a Bloody Mary with Absolute Peppar - it was pretty good. Fresh tasting. I appreciate the bottled tap water at the table, so you don't have to wait for your server for some more aqua, particularly because the service was extremely slow.  The server would disappear for a longggg time, even after we placed an order for drinks (the drinks took excessively long to come out).  It's true what the other reviews say about their fries- they are pretty good.  They seem to be freshly cut and are crispy.  The burger I had was just OK.  I actually was slightly disappointed in the size - it barely covered the bun.  The spinach and artichoke dip, as well as the crispy artichokes, were both delicious appetizers.  I would love the recipe for the dip because that's exactly how I like it.The prices were pretty reasonable - I believe our Bloody Marys and Mimosas were each under $7.
2016-06-13,2,This place definitely needs a management change. It was clear that the marketing team was great. They hooked us in with a beautiful website, trendy offerings, gorgeous location. Unfortunately they oversold and undelivered on the product and service. Better prices then other Hoboken selections but the value for money is still lacking. Go down the street to any other restaurant instead.
2016-06-07,1,Had been dying to come here with my husband for some time. The price we paid for dinner was ASTRONOMICAL. Look, the views of NYC are excellent and this place is prime Hoboken location, but if you're looking for the skyline just take a walk along the pier. It's free! I ordered a burger which was an absolute mess and fell apart on me. The artichoke appetizer was great. The drinks were average. Service was awful. Really not much more to say except we will certainly not be back.
2016-06-05,2,Service was good but disappointing food and drinks.  Friends and I had tuna tartare, buffalo chicken tacos, Thai salad and chicken Cobb salad, which were all mediocre at best.  Chicken seemed like it was from the Tyson prepackaged section at grocery store.  Drinks were ok but were 75% solid ice cube and only filled 3/4... A bad value.  Wanted this to be good as I've enjoyed NYC locations but but don't recommend.
2016-05-26,2,This is the classic 'every time I go there I have a problem' place. The food's not bad, although I have had to send things back when they were prepared incorrectly. The drinks are usually poorly made and I have never had a positive experience with service. No one is rude, it just seems like they are seriously lacking training. I gave them a few tries and have consistently been unimpressed. The best part is that they are located by the water.
2016-05-20,4,First, definitely gotta give it up for their location! NYC skyline right across the street, and they have their doors and windows open for you to enjoy, with outside seatings also. With that said, hubby and I went here for dinner on a Friday night. The wait for a table was super quick so we got seated right away. The place was big, not cramped however it was SUPER LOUD. It's like NJ sports bar meets hipster Brooklyn type restaurant. Not a bad spot, atmosphere was good, great decor and setting. I'm giving this a 4 star because of the loudness (couldn't hear a single word the waiter was saying) AND it took about 40 mins to get our food!! Not really great especially if you're running out of appetizers and drinks are priced like NYC clubs (very pricey). We ordered oysters, burrata burger (working on summer body so Mac and cheese burger will have to wait), and fish tacos. All were great! Burger was seasoned well, super juicy, and done just perfect. Must say, a great combo for the burrata and roasted peppers. Fish tacos were fresh and decent portioned. My hubby was obsessed over their fries and saying how fresh the oysters were!Everything was well prepared, fresh, and well seasoned. We also ordered the Roosevelt and Old Fashion cocktails and they were delicious and strong! Other than having to wait long for your food, I'd come back to try other things on the menu! Their bar started to get packed so it must be a good sign. Overall, a great restaurant for casual date night, dinner with groups,etc. the food makes up for the wait.
2016-05-16,4,The Ainsworth definitely lives up to the hype for their Mac and Cheese burgers! The mac and cheese burger has a layer of fried mac and cheese, burger, and another scoop of gooey mac and cheese on top! It also comes with a pickle and fries. Their fries have got to be one of my favorite fries from a restaurant - it tasted amazing!The waitress was great, however a tad bit slow but I went on a Saturday night. It was UFC Fight Night and they have a bunch of TVs scattered around the restaurant to accommodate for the fans. This is a great spot to watch all sporting events! Overall, I had a great experience. Truly, that burger was so yummy! There are more locations in the city, so you don't have to take a hike to Hoboken.  The Ainsworth in Hoboken was right by the New York skyline but you can only see the view if you are seated outside!
2016-05-15,4,Came here with my parents and brother for an early dinner on a Sunday.  The music was a little loud but they seemed to lower it as the night went on.  We each tried a different burger and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I have been here a few times and the burgers are always cooked perfectly and the fries are always on point!  I wished they had more options for their appetizers, but definitely a solid choice for dinner.
2016-05-14,1,The food and drinks may or may not be good here. It's not that I didn't have any, it's just that the terrible service overshadowed everything else. I don't know if they were understaffed or what but I really don't care. It was just bad. I won't be back and I definitely won't recommend it to anyone.
2016-05-07,4,My sisters and I stopped in here for lunch on a Friday. The place was pretty dead but we were there during that awkward time between lunch and dinner. We each went with a lunch special (half salad and half sandwich) for under $13. My burger was simple, but good and I really enjoyed the kale Caesar salad. My sisters were happy with their shrimp tacos and BLT. The fries were very good too, but perhaps just a bit too salty. Our server was also friendly and helpful, until we wanted the check, at which point he/she was nowhere to be found.My only gripe is that they should probably lower the cocktail prices during the day if they want to encourage people to order them. It's kind of silly that one drink is more expensive than the whole lunch special.Other than that, parking it what you'd expect. Hopefully you're lucky enough to get a meter spot on Sinatra Drive.
2016-05-02,5,Great food with awesome views.  Eat outside and enjoy some fresh air.  Great beer selection too.  We used a private room and they accommodated us with ease.
2016-05-01,2,I wanted to love this place since its location and views are unbeatable. The setup inside is very nice and the decor is fun. Unfortunately we found the food to be pretty mediocre. The Quinoa-Kale burger, one of the few veggie options, was overly fried which was a bummer. They are also very touchy about substitutions - we were told the chefs don't like customers to "mess with their vision" - which seemed odd at a bar that serves mostly burgers and sandwiches. I would come back for the view but likely not for the food.
2016-04-29,5,very cool atmosphere. the place is fairly dark so makes for a nice date night. You can hang out by the bar see the nyc view and many faces just hanging out having a drink
2016-04-27,3,The location is second to none.  You are literally overlooking NYC and are about 20 feet from the Hudson River.  That being said the food is nothing to write home about.  The burgers are ok with a few different choices but it is not the best burger I have had in Hoboken.  The beer selection is ok as well.  There are better places in Hoboken but there are also a lot worse ones.  They get extra points for having the windows open up so you can enjoy the nice weather.
2016-04-26,4,Mac & cheese burger is the best burger I've ever had. It's huge so I always end up taking some of it home. Drinks are good and great location right by the water. The only downside is the cleanliness of the bathrooms...they are always a mess.
2016-04-21,4,Came here unexpected on A Wednesday Night , comfy service was Decent ! the drinks were excellent & water was puried ! food was tasteful !!! we definitely enjoyed our time there .. i will revisit & with different people for different opinions
2016-04-17,1,TERRIBLE SERVICE. Waited 20 min to get a table, and 20 min for a Bellini & 1 hour for a burger + fries! Wasted my time with a restaurant like this. I would've been better off grabbing a sandwich at Smash Burger. This restaurant is not equipped to handle the volume. Unacceptable and probably not the best choice to go to if you have an appointment to meet after lunch!
2016-04-06,5,So , we came to this place by chance , we were on our way to Del Frisco and we decided to stop here instead , pleasantly surprised , food was excellent and the drinks were great and the service was oitstanding! Giovanni our bartender was awesome !!!!We will definitely comeback
2016-04-06,1,When I started going to this spot, they hat the Tuna Tataki salad on the menu and that was my favorite. Unfortunately they since removed it from the menu, still went once or twice a week.Now I am leaning towards not going back to the Ainsworth. I was lucky enough to win an open bar this past weekend and while that went off swimmingly, I ended up leaving behind a sweater and my guest's party favors. While material things are not all that matter in this world, I am and will continue to be upset at the loss of about 350's worth of me and my guests property. The past few days, I have called and spoken with the hostess and she has been helpful but she turned rude when I followed up with my inquiry. I know its not your responsibility as a restaurant to keep tabs on my personal belonging, but what kind of clientele do you have that would jack my stuff and go about their day, worse a staff member who would do that and not say anything! I may go back one more time as I like to give second chances and the bar staff rock, talking about Nick and Jose specifically. Not sure I'll recommend this place at all anymore, where as i was once your biggest fan :(
2016-04-03,5,The burgers are the obvious go-to item -- and with good reason, they're inventive and delicious. But don't sleep on the rest of the menu either. The crispy crab tacos are out of this world (if I could buy a tub of the filling and take it home, I would), and the mac and cheese -- the same kind that's poured on top of their famous mac and cheeseburger -- is a must-have side. It's creamy and cheesy and oh-so-delicious. The Ainsworth manages to expertly walk the line between feeling like an upscale bar, and a local neighborhood pub. On any given day, you'll see families in the dining room and young singles in the bar area watching the game, and everyone's having a great time. The customer service is excellent, too.
2016-04-03,5,The food here is a cut above the rest, much like the customer service. The Burgers are just pure insanity but the rest of the menu is just as good. The Thai Kale Salad makes eating salads something you'll look forward to. The skirt steak over chorizo hash is pure joy. They have the absolute creamiest and savory Mac and cheese.And, do NOT leave without eating the brownie fudge sundae. I'm not so into sweets and this thing just really gets me going. Enjoy
2016-04-02,2,I cannot get over the poor service! I've been here twice, once in the dining room and once at the bar. The first time I came here they forgot to bring the fries with my burger and the waitress said she would bring them right out. She never came back after that and I had to ask another server for help. No one ever checked on us once and I had to flag another person down just to get our check. I completely understand that servers get overwhelmed but this was just ridiculous. The bar was just as slow. We sat there for about 10 minutes without even being acknowledged and it wasn't crowded at all. Bartender finally came over just as we were about to walk out. Terrible service, I will not be back.
2016-03-27,5,I'm typically a wino but decided to mix it up tonight. What often deters me from diving into cocktails (besides the hangover) is the amount of alcohol and/or other crap involved in the creation of said crafted cocktail. I decided on a Mr. Moore, again not much of a bourbon drinker but the blackberry and honey/ginger reeled me in.Wow-I was floored by the taste and presentation of this cocktail. It also didn't hurt that the bartender, Giovanni, was delightful - he was engaging and seriously makes a mean cocktail.Ambiance is amazing. View is incredible. Cocktails are delish. If I lived here...I would be here more often :)
2016-03-24,1,The weather is finally getting nice out so my boyfriend and I decided to try the Ainsworth for a drink as they have outdoor seating right along the water. There were no tables open however they had two stools at the "outdoor bar" (there is a window that allows the bar to service outside customers but the bar is on the inside). We had 2 friends coming so we were eyeing tables to open up outside - one opened up but it was only a two top and we asked the hostess if she could take another table and push them together (there was plenty of room for her to do this). She said she couldn't because the tables have different waitresses so it would the table away from the waitress. Our friends came and wanted to sit at the bar so we asked for more stools. Unfortunately we were not allowed to take stools from the inside and bring them outside because they are "designated inside stools" for customers that weren't even there. There was a tub with bottles of water that was sitting on stool for outside tables and we asked to use that stool and they said no its for the water (because water needs a stool too). Finally a table opened up so we asked to transfer our tab from the bar to the table. Well... it was basically asking to do brain surgery as no one could figure out that we moved about 4 feet from the bar to the table. I ordered a drink at the table which never came, the waitress completely ignored us. It is probably one of the most unaccommodating restaurants I've ever been to. The food is nothing special either. There are way better bars in Hoboken to go to. Do not waste your time getting side eyed from the hostess.
2016-03-21,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken, the Mac and cheese burger is delicious. Beautiful view and they allow dogs at their out door seating.
2016-03-16,1,WORSTSERVICE. Not worth the food. RUDE servers. Brought wrong food, extra drinks we didn't order (or drink) and charged us for all of it.  Pulled the "we are corporate" card and said they couldn't take the stuff off.  THEY SUCK!!!
2016-03-15,3,I came here on a Saturday night to meet some friends who were in town visiting! It was a great choice! For a Hoboken bar on a Saturday night it was crowded but not like we couldn't share in conversation. They do not have bud light... And the bar tender was super slow and not very friendly... I was excited to get a seat at the bar when we first arrived, but still waited 15 mins for a drink. Even when I would get to order multiple times she came back without one of drinks. I enjoyed the ambiance and casualness of the place.
2016-03-11,3,Average is how I'd describe this place. I've been here twice for dinner or should I say attempted dinners. The first time, despite there being a half dozen open tables, my girlfriend and I waited roughly 30 minutes to be seated. Once seated we waited another 15 minutes for a server to come. She never did so we said to hell with this place and left. The second time we were seated promptly but our server was pretty much nonexistent. At one point I had to walk up to the bar to get a refill. So service alone I'd give this place 1 star at best. The food is good but no better than your average Hoboken sports bar, just fancier dishes and more expensive. I do like the vibe here and would come back for drinks and apps but never again for dinner.
2016-02-19,5,I went out to dinner with an old friend last night and upon arrival I was greeted by a fabulous host, Heather. She was very welcoming and seated us right away. Our server, Paula was also awesome and checked in on us frequently. Food/drinks were delicious!! I will definitely be back!
2016-02-16,4,What a great surprise. I've always wondered why the places along the Hoboken waterfront haven't had even greater success. It doesn't get much better in terms of location and view than Sinatra Drive. Ainsworth looks like a keeper. I took the comfort food route when I ate here on Sunday night. I enjoyed a few draft beers, some flash fried peppers, and a very tasty French Onion burger. The fact that burger was served on an oversized English muffin didn't hurt. As far as bar food goes...A+. Speaking of A+....the bartender was very nice as well. She took great care of us. I believe her name was Vicki...definitely give this place a whirl.
2016-02-15,3,I came in with my daughter today.  The hostess was not very welcoming but she walked us to our table promptly.  The waitress was quick to greet us and very friendly.  We chose to order from the lunch menu, $12 for a started and entree. I had a quinoa salad and buffalo chicken tacos.  My daughter ordered the burger and ceasar salad.  My food was great, I loved the tacos!  But the burger was beyond rare, it was raw.  I rarely send the food back, but I had to ask the waitress to cook it longer, she quickly told me she would bring another one.  It was a pleasant experience and the service was good, but there was nothing special about it.
2016-02-14,5,Went there for Valentine's day tonight with my boyfriend. We had the pre-fixed menu and it was great. The oysters were fresh and the steak was cooked exactly as I wanted. The server was friendly and attentive and the manager came over to check on us. The specialty cocktails were very tasty. Definitely would go back again!
2016-02-02,1,Came here at 10:15 on a Thursday and the kitchen was closed and they were pretty much closing up. When I called at 8 to find out what time they were going to serve until he told me 1130-12. i would not have made the trek over and would have gone elsewhere. When I walked in, the server pretty much avoided all eye contact and they were already stacking the chairs. I have been to the Ainsworth in the city, both of them and they are by far better than this place. I am sorry to say this location does not embody anybody the key components that make the other locations successful.
2016-01-24,2,A sports bar???? Came once for Sunday football TV  set  up is terrible food is pricey and odd  (tuna tartar and  oysters) not what I would order at a place like  this underwhelming and overpriced.
2016-01-15,4,Very good food. Usually come here for lunch on Weekdays when ìts least crowded. Recommended the place to my boss and team for Christmas lunch with visitors. Everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food. Don't know the servers name but she provided great service consistent with my daily server Natalya. Highly recommend. Only four stats because i have yet to cone here when ìts crowded.
2016-01-12,5,We had come once and eaten one of the best burgers, so we came again with the family and the burger we ordered did not come out as well and was overcooked, the waiter immediately asked if we would like to change it, and brought a new burger which was amazing!! Service was great, best burgers ever, 100% recommended - we'll be back (like arnold)
2016-01-12,5,Great food and great service. We have been here for brunch and drinks a few times before but actually just tried it for dinner and we had an amazing time. The food is always great here and we were welcomed with attentive service from beginning to end. The place was packed on a Thursday and everything seemed to be running smoothly. We will definitely be back for brunch again sometime soon and have found a new favorite dinner spot. Highly recommend Ainsworth for a fantastic meal.
2016-01-11,1,If I could give this place less than one star, I would. My friends and I were just there for lunch and one bite into my burger, I see a mouse by my feet! I immediately drop my food and put my legs up, as did my friends. It took about 5 minutes for someone to even come ask why we were standing on our chairs. When we told them about the mouse, no one seemed surprised! Several of them laughed. Our waitress didn't apologize. A busboy joked, "don't worry the pet snake will get it." The manager comes over and barely apologizes and quickly walks away. Our burgers get taken away (each only one bite in) and our bill comes. They charged us for everything! So I called the manager back and demanded that she remove our uneaten burgers from our bill. She says, "I didn't realize you hadn't finished eating" as if that makes it okay to charge us for this horrifying experience. Our bill comes back and we are still charged for our 2 beers and order of wings. We quickly pay and get up to leave and the busboy comes back around again and laughs, points at the floor and jokingly yells "watch out, watch out" as we are leaving. Extremely confused by this whole experience.
2016-01-09,2,I never write reviews while I'm at an establishment but this is just bad. We came in with no reservations and were told there was a 40min wait for 4 people. We sat towards the back bar at an empty table while we waited. While sitting there these women were clearly concerned because they were scheduled to have a party there but no one knew anything about it. We ended up getting a table almost an hour a half after we walked in! Best part was I was staring at 3 tables that could of accommodated our party the whole time! We asked about them but we were told they were reserved....I ordered the crispy chicken sandwich. I basically could have gotten the same thing at Wendy's for less than half the price. Two stars for the decent Cabernet Sauvignon. Save time and go to Del Friscos down the street.
2016-01-09,3,A larger group of friends and I came in here for brunch today after hearing about it from some Hoboken locals. Unfortunately, this was not a stellar brunch experience. The menu was very small and there weren't any drink specials. We ended up getting 4 liter type pitchers of mimosas, which alone was $80. With so few options, our table primarily ordered the chorizo eggs benedict, with the others getting the ham and cheese omelette and a cesar salad. It was OK, but really nothing to write home about for $15. Service was OK as well. Our waitress was nice, but drinks came out slowly and we were given some dirty glasses with our drinks.  Decor is also interesting to say the least. It has a cute, rustic vibe, but there are TVs everywhere, making it more like a sports bar vibe.  For brunch, it just wasn't really the spot we had in mind. I'd be interested to see how their lunch/dinner food is, but I won't be back for brunch.
2016-01-01,1,I went there last night (New Years eve) with 4 friends and we paid extra money for a table, the burgers were rare and all three of the toilets were overflowing and out of toilet paper. A good restaurant would hire a bathroom attendant on NYE to prevent a wet bathroom that wasn't useable. I told the owner about the bathrooms and he said, the plumbing is bad.. Well would not recommend this place. It was dirty and a waste of money!
2015-12-18,1,This place sucks.  I rarely leave bad reviews, But I honestly don't know how they afford the rent- the bartenders are rude and bad at pouring drinks, and the place is empty on a Friday night.  I am Looking forward to the place that replaces this soon-to-be-forgotten outpost of a great NYC bar(s). Thanks ainsworth for embarrassing Hoboken.
2015-12-17,5,WHAT!I was so surprised seeing this was a 3/5. My boyfriend took me here for a quick lunch a few days ago and I am a picky picky girl. Our waitress was so so so sweet! I was having trouble deciding what to order and she recommended the mac and cheese burger! it was DELICIOUS. My boyfriend got some sort of chicken burger I can't remember exactly but he also said it was delicious. I was really surprised with how good the food was. I definitely recommend !
2015-12-16,5,Last night we went to celebrate my birthday and I was not disappointed with my choice!! Our waitress Jennifer was so fun and fantastic. She really made the night perfect! We got the Ains Martini and the Mac&Cheeseburger which were both amazing. It was a great place for a celebration!
2015-12-13,4,Despite it being a Saturday night and a packed restaurant, there was a short wait for a table.  The restaurant had tv's all around with a full bar that was swarming with people.  My friends and I sat in the middle of the restaurant and it was fairly loud.  We had to raises our voices to hear each other.  They have a small private party room in the back with doors that close.  Compared to their NYC locations (Midtown, Gramercy, and Chelsea), it's a much smaller restaurant.  The location was previously "Little Town" which is no longer there.  Ainsworth Hoboken is located right near the water and a short walk to the Path and NJ Transit, as well as it being close to the heart of other bars/restaurants in Hoboken.  My friends and I ordered the fish tacos and buffalo chicken tacos that were delicious!  The drinks were perfect and everything came out quickly.  Next time I'm going to try the mac and cheese burger.  Overall, delicious and affordable food.  I would go back again!
2015-12-03,4,I always end up coming here for drinks with my friends, but recently we came here for brunch. Their brunch menu is pretty good with a large variety. I had a burger which was massive! My friends loved everything they ordered as well. My only complaint was it was so hot inside we had to leave to drink somewhere else. We couldn't take it anymore!
2015-11-19,4,The crowd is older (which I appreciate). The atmosphere is cool and the décor is trendy. The mac & cheese is to die for! I also LOOOVE the fish tacos. Don't ask to special order anything though because the answer is always no. (Not cool for people with dietary restrictions.) I don't love the stemless martini and wine glasses. Makes the drinks warm since your hand touches the glass vs. the stem. But, what do I know. The menu isn't cheap but I suppose they have to pay rent, as their waterfront location with views of Manhattan is definitely desirable.
2015-11-16,5,This place has a really nice interior and nyc skyline view if you are sitting near the entrance by the bar or outside. Also, this place has some tasty burgers and some nice brews on tap. A bit pricey but def worth it!
2015-11-15,5,Always fun coming here. Friendly staff, delicious food and drinks make the spot perfect!Always cool to stop by and have the best drinks in Hoboken by Natasha!
2015-10-30,3,First of all the burgers are great, and served with an interesting flair (knife stuck through).  And after being here half a dozen times it's probably the only thing worth ordering. I tried a lighter fare, specifically the quinoa salad entrée tonight, and the $3 pile of cold quinoa that came out was not only extremely small but very disappointing... basically not a "salad" by any means, and the size of a side dish.  Our waitress was great, but waited a little too long for replacement drinks (10 minutes).  I want to like this place.  I hope it improves.
2015-10-18,2,Just had brunch here (a Sunday), with 3 friends, I did not pick the place.  Food is mediocre, average, and overpriced.  $14 for Traditional Breakfast aka 2 eggs your way, ham or bacon, buttermilk biscuit, potatoes, also served with a few mixed lettuce leaves (think the 50/50 blend from the bag).  Small portion size and food was not hot when it came out.  No drink specials with brunch.  Service was slow.  Ambience is the only thing going for this place.  I imagine there are much better places in Hoboken for brunch.  I would not go back.
2015-10-17,1,Snotty hostessTold us there was a 45min wait and we saw open tables and no one waiting. They couldn't figure out how to work their electronic seating tablet.  They were a mess.  Save your time and money.
2015-10-12,1,Food was great but the service is AWFUL. We were there for two hours and only got a burger. It took forever to get the waitress to even check on our table never mind take our order.
2015-10-12,2,Underwhelmed and overpriced. That sums up my first and likely last experience at the Ainsworth. I enjoyed Little Town, I thought the food was good, but the service was always something to be desired. I will say our service at Ainsworth was very good but it can't up the rating because of the food and prices. But the layout is basically little town but no skee ball and with more subway tile and a ton of TVs, per every downtown bar. We came for a friends 30th birthday party, there were a bunch of us so they made the b-day party get a prix-fixe menu. The menu was this for $30...shared appetizers and a choice of one burger. The burgers there run $15 so we were paying $15 for sub-par app choices. The choices were Caesar salad, a veggie platter and a tiny spinach and artichoke dip. How do you expect 30 people to share Caesar salads (which were under-dressed and not great)? The veggie platter was a few veggies thrown on a cutting board with a few dipping sauces and what I would describe as a hummus like substance. The spinach and artichoke dip lacked flavor it needed to be seasoned. And it was tiny. For that cost the veggie platter was just pitiful. So 1 star for apps.I ordered the mac n' cheese burger because of other reviews on here. Meh would be the best way to describe it. The mac n' cheese was bland and flavorless and really added nothing to the burger. It was just an ok burger. I would never come here to spend 15 bucks on that burger. The fries however were good. For the $30 we paid we really got a few veggies and a meh burger. If you are going to force parties to have a prix-fixe then step up what  options are available. For 2 people with 4 beers it was $94. Not worth half that. Our waitress was very good and very on the spot, but the food and price point was no good. I doubt I will return.
2015-10-05,5,We accidentally bumped into this place thinking its one of the several bars n restaurants in the area.. But we were in for a total surprise! We ordered quinoa n kale burger, one of the best burgers i have had in sometime! Asparagus skewers and buffalo cauliflower were equally good and they way they served these added to the touch.. Definitely recommended..
2015-10-04,2,We have come here many times and usually love it. The skirt steak with the chorizo hash is awesome,  but last night everything kind of sucked. We ordered the Italian skewer and it came to our table still raw in the middle. When we told the waitress that it is raw, she said "oh, you want it cooked all the way through? "Of course !it's pork! Do you want us to get tape worm lol. Your servers and cooks should know this about pork. So she took it back and literally they just put the same plate on the grill and brought it back to us. It should have been brand new and fresh. Not a re fry.  Them the steal we ordered medium rare was under cooked lol. Get it together!
2015-09-30,5,The mac and cheese burger is incredible. Well worth the price, as it is huge. Fries could have been a little bit better but it was okay because I just ate the whole burger instead of filling up on fries. My friend had the texas burger and she said it was just as incredible. The only thing that I will say about this place is that it is ridiculously loud and for some reason when we went there was a DJ there, which was totally unnecessary and weird. But I loved the food and would come back in a heartbeat. This was probably one of the top five best burgers I've ever had
2015-09-29,4,I recently enjoyed dinner last Saturday night at the Ainsworth. The cocktails were awesome, as was the service...thanks Emily! For dinner I had the shrimp skewers with a side salad, I was expecting less shrimp so I was really excited to see three full skewers in front of me. My date enjoyed the steak, which tasted great and was cooked to perfection. They had a DJ playing music pretty early (8:30 ish), so it was a little loud for dinner conversation, but I liked his song choices. They have a lot of TVs so I'm sure it's great for when football is on! The restaurant is right on the water and has a great vibe, if you're in Hoboken I would absolutely recommend this place!
2015-09-27,5,I loved this place. They were so accommodating. I went on a Sunday with my friend, his son and my dog. They did not appear to have any tables, and told us it would be a 45 minute wait. But the hostess then said, hold on, let me check... And she was able to sit us outside at a nice table, all 3 1/2 of us. Food was great, you can see the TVs from sitting outside. Good music, though it is loud. And fun. If you want quiet brunch its, probably not the best for this. But great if you want a pick me up, fun afternoon. Food was good, plenty of nice brews on tap. Our waitress was always checking up on us and great service. I would definitely go back.
2015-09-11,1,Horrible! Horrible! Horrible service! Today was my second time going there. The first time I went there my friend and I were seated around 6:30pm and we still didn't get our food until it was well after 7:30pm. Not only did the lady not informed us that the kitchen was overwhelmed but we had to keep questioning her about it. On our way out we spoke to the manager and she was kind enough to take care of our bill. She reassured me the next time I come this wouldn't happen. I went there today because despite the experience, the food was really good that first time, And again with a different person they were more pissed about how bad the service was. Now, the young lady's working there are very sweet but they DO NOT pay attention to their tables. I had to keep waving her down and she only came to check up on the table once. I sat by the bar and I see her take orders from people who just sat down meanwhile it's been a whole 10 minutes and my friend still didn't get her beer. It was not crowded, actually I can count on my hands how many people were there. It's sad that this place has really good food but the servers are not trained properly. The bus boys honestly are the only ones I saw really working hard to make sure everything was cleaned up. Wish I gave the bus boy a tip instead
2015-09-10,3,Have been here once. Food was very good, but pricey for what you get. Never drink specials. They do have really creative cocktails (try the rosemary one). Given the choice Id probably go somewhere else... Cheaper and pretty much the same food.
2015-09-07,2,Food is typically pretty good.  Have had really good burger and couple sa switches but service is always bad.  Will get seated and forgotten about for 20 minutes.  Lucky to see server more than once after you get your food.  If they could get some oversight and that fixed would be good but not worth it now.
2015-09-06,2,service is pretty crappy, burgers are ok, fries are pretty crappy. server was nonexistent, threw a fit when we split checks (which wasn't a difficult split), smashed a glass on the table when we were signing checks, and offered no apologies2 stars for putting fried mac and cheese on a burger
2015-08-25,5,I`ve been in here quite a few times since moving to the Hoboken area 2 months ago.I`ve never been disappointed by the food. The appetizers and entrees are great.A great place for a night out with the friends, a casual lunch, or a date.I`ll be a frequent client as long as I live in the area.
2015-08-18,2,This place has a major service problem. The wait for food is crazy long, waitresses disappear or quickly walk through the dinning room avoiding the eyes of customers. Whenever there's bad service at a restaurant, my first thought it that the place is understaffed. If the waitstaff is clearly overwhelmed, I understand slow service. When there are four or five waitresses milling around and chatting with each other rather than getting my bill...well, I'm done. Last time I was here, I had to go up to a group of waitresses to ask for my bill, after having waited for 20-30 minutes. Seriously, who hires and trains these people? Food is expensive and slightly below expectations (as in, good enough, but not worth the markup).
2015-08-17,4,Came here with my friend when it first opened and the service was mediocre, the server wasn't even sure if they had bread for the table. Kale salad and brussel sprout salad was good. We left a survey of our experience and were invited to come back got a free round of drinks. The second time around was much better, and they were very accommodating.
2015-08-15,2,1. I'm super ecstatic about paying $13 for a "Crudite and Hummus Platter" and receiving 3 pieces of 4 kinds of vegetables with a minuscule sized serving of hummus accompanied with ranch and honey mustard.... Said no one ever. Why not just more hummus like the name implies?2. Our waitress focused more on some guy that was there while we were eating. She was nice but frequently absent. The place wasn't that crowded and it took forever to get our wine. I had been here for drinks before when it was way more populated and the service was a lot better. Not sure what to make of this.Most likely won't back to eat. Drink? Maybe.
2015-08-10,1,I went to Ainsworth with my girlfriend after spending the morning at the pier downtown and decided to grab a bite at the outside bar. After looking at the menu I chose the breakfast burrito and my girlfriend got the tuna tartare. The tuna tartare was pretty good but the breakfast burrito was small, came with no sides and was overall subpar. For $13 I would have expected a solid burrito with at least one side. We had a couple drinks which were average and our lunch turned into a nearly $100 affair. Highway robbery for what we received. The service was fine but overall we felt cheated by the food and drinks. The view was extremely nice, but there are many other places with just as good of a view on both sides of the Hudson. We ate dinner later that night in the west village and had an amazing meal for a significant discount compared to Ainsworth. Next time avoid Ainsworth and get the real deal for an appropriate price.
2015-08-07,1,My first yelp review because after my experience here I have never been so frustrated. If it had just been the extremely slow service and just OK food I probably wouldn't be writing this, I get it places have their bad days. We split the bill between two cards and I noticed a few days later my card was charge d the full amount and my boyfriend was charged his half. I called and they told me manager wasnt there and to call back. Called back and manager wasn't available and took my name and number but no call back. Called again and a girl took my information and was going to look into it. Get an email that they "can't find" my transaction and if I could give them a list of what I had... a week later and still has not been resolved.AWFUL customer service, definitly will not be back.
2015-08-07,3,Just meh. Went here on a date for some drinks and ended up ordering the chicken and fries appetizer- I would say mediocre at best. Definitely overpriced but I won't give two stars given that was the only food we got. Drinks weren't very strong and the service was just okay. I'd give it one more try because everyone's food around us looked and smelled amazing (the burger in particular). Also, I just love the outside seating with the waterfront view.
2015-08-04,4,Walked by early Saturday afternoon and decided to stop in for lunch. We sat inside at a high top table close to the window so it was the perfect scenery. I love how you can sit at the bar from the outside also. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. The scene seemed upbeat and everyone dining seemed to be enjoying themselves so I'm surprised by all the negative service experiences in previous reviews. Since I will be in a bathing suit on vacation in a couple days, I was reluctant to order either the Mac & Cheese or French Onion Burger but those would have been my first two options. Instead I went for the Turkey Burger and fries. The burger was substantial, well seasoned and very juicy. It was only topped with mayo and some arugala (which wasn't dressed in lemon vinaigrette as advertised) so I was missing an element of crunch. The fries were great. Thick cut, but not soggy and perfectly salted. I wish there were some alternative options for sides and condiments in lieu of ketchup here. My boyfriend had a bun-less Breakfast Burger which had a hash browns, bacon, cheese and fried egg. He thought it was great, and didn't even need the bun with the hash browns.I have no reason not to come back, and I definitely will be after my vacation to have those two burgers for sure.
2015-07-31,3,Great location with above decent food but not great - certain things overpriced but for the most part fairly priced - service was good but I asked for my bun toasted and was told no changes can be made - so I asked the waitress to see if it comes already toasted and she asked the chef who said yes it is - of course it comes out not toasted- If it was toasted the burger would have no complaints - the fries were not good - other people in the party had fish tacos and skirt steak and said it was good
2015-07-24,5,Had the Mac and cheeseburger which was amazing. Could not even finish it. On Thursdays they have a special for $5 for all drafts.
2015-07-22,5,Came here for a late dinner one night. First off, our server Maggie was excellent. Very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us a great tip on our beers. Artichoke dip was delicious. The marinated skirt steak was not only cooked perfectly, but was also seasoned just right. For a busy night, the entire staff was very attentive to us. Great food. Great service. Will definitely be back.
2015-07-21,1,I will rarely give a bad review but my experience at The Ainsworth was so terrible that I felt the need to write this. The service is undeniably the worst service I've EVER experienced. Our waitress disappeared, no she didn't finish her shift. I guess she decided that after collecting our orders that would be enough service. We sat there for ages wanting to buy another round and eventually we had to flag another waitress down and when my wine came, the glass was shattered!! When we pointed it out she didn't even offer to give me another glass or comp it! The food is ok kind of mediocre but nonetheless it's food. Very very disappointed in this place.
2015-07-19,2,we have been waiting for 20 minutes and counting for our drinks. the service is incredibly slow. the food is good, but not worth the lack of customer service.
2015-07-16,5,Their tuna tartar is to die for!! Great spot with an awesome ambience. Love the indoor/outdoor seating. The drinks are great and not too pricy. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Always come here with my girls for a relaxed type of night. And the city views are definitely a nice bonus.
2015-07-16,3,I had a very good burger here. Unfortunately I almost walked about before I had a chance to order it. I came in alone for a Saturday lunch at the bar. I sat down and waited, and waited and waited ... The bartender in the area was busy but not swamped. After I waited for awhile, before even acknowledging me, he asked the people next to me if they wanted another round of drinks. Then got them those drinks.Just as I was about to get up and walk away, he finally noted that he'd be with me in a moment. The burger was good, but not worth putting up with that.
2015-07-15,5,My friends and I came here last night for dinner and drinks and it was a packed crowd for a Tuesday. It was our first time here so we asked Liz our server for some recommendations. Everything Liz recommended was awesome. Liz  was very knowledgable about the menu and drinks and made our experience all the more enjoyable. We had a great time and will be back.
