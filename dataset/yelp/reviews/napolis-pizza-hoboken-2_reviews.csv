2021-11-07,1,Agnus is so rude I almost left. She makes me not want to spend $300 a week here for football sundays . That would be a shame if the place lost business because of her but unfortunately that's what happens when you hire a mean unprofessional angry person to deal with customers. Everyone else is great.
2021-10-30,4,I've been meaning to try Napoli's for a while! It was really good. We got meatball sliders and buffalo wings to start, the buffalo wings were crispy and flavorful. we got a Sicilian plain pie (only comes in large) and a vodka pepperoni pie. I think the waiter was shocked w differed this much food for three  people  I was expecting the vodka sauce to be more flavorful, but the pepperoni was really good. Warning: if you sit outside expect a lot of comments from people passing by! I would come here again and try different pizzas!
2021-10-17,5,What a pizza! Honestly the pizza was the one I've always wanted but never found until last night. Chipotle bruschetta chicken ranch was completely off the hook. Fresh mozzarella and basil made the difference. But another aspect of any great food experience is the people who serve you. Great staff!Great pizza! Great experience. Thank you so much.
2021-10-02,5,Excellent pizza. Margherita and meat lovers were incredible. Would go back and eat until I can't eat any more again. Vibes were also pretty good
2021-09-04,4,Great for a group outing! BYOB and some of the highest quality pizza in Hoboken. This is not neapolitan style pizza, these are larger pies both traditional and inventive! My favorite pies from Napolis are the vodka and the buffalo chicken! The buffalo chicken is my favorite pizza in town! The staff is super attentive and the atmosphere isn't stuffy! My friends and I go on a monthly basis. And their pizza is always great for takeout or delivery!
2021-08-26,3,Love the pizza here, but shame on them for raising the prices. Just tried to order 2 slices of Pepp pizza that they had in the window to order slices out of and those slices also had some veggies on it, they wanted to charge me $20!!! I asked if that was right, and they said the managers / owners raised the price recently. I then tried to order a personal pizza and it was $19! Wow!! That's actually insane -- I walked right next door to The Brick instead and was charged $12.79 for a personal pie with Pepp!
2021-08-22,5,Great pizza and delicious salads!  Pro tip- if your hungry and getting to go- pick up instead of delivery!
2021-07-20,1,Hey Frank, when was I supposed to ask to speak to manager? The first time I called, your employee lied about the order being delivered in 15 minutes. 40 minutes later, when i called back and said I wanted to cancel, your other employee just left me on hold. Your lying thieving employees told Seamless my order was delivered when it was not. That is FRAUD. Do I care if they lose their jobs? Nope! I support places that do not lie and try to steal from their customers.
2021-06-28,5,I order from napolis regularly, pretty much once a week. Everything I've tried has been good, the service is good as well. Highly recommend napolis for both takeout or dine in if you are in Hoboken craving a slice or a panini.
2021-06-24,1,First time ordering delivery and was very excited after reading positive reviews. Ordered 2 hours ahead of time (6:15) for an 8:15 pickup. I received an email at 7:30 with an adjusted 8:45 pick up time. I called and the host who picked up was extremely rude and cut me short saying it's busy and to come at 8:45. Called shortly after and she said it would actually be ready at original time now... we arrive at 8:15 and pick up the food which was entirely cold. Who knows how long the food sat there. I am not one to leave bad reviews but this was upsetting and dismissive. Train your staff to be kind to your customers and be transparent.
2021-06-24,2,So I often go to the Clinton st location which I love. But this location is awful. The same pizzas I order at Clinton st somehow are made different. The crust thickness is so inconsistent from day to day. They just throw toppings and sauce on the pizza. I ordered a margherita and it's covered in sauce like way more than margherita pizza should have. Sucks because it's such a nice location, cute indooor and outdoor space.
2021-06-23,4,Listen, we got the ciao bello pizza and it was good. I enjoyed it. Our server only talked to us twice though so I didn't really feel the love. 4 stars.
2021-05-02,2,This place got a lot of 4 to 5 stars so I said sure why not let me check it out. Let's start off with the service. Horrible horrible and horrible as all I can say. Waited more than 10 minutes for someone to talk my order. It wasn't even busy. It was before 11:30 am. Tell one guy he goes yea someone will take your order. Another hit with glasses literally glued to his phone didn't even bother to look up. Then after quite some time some young kid came and took order. His service below average also took forever to get the food not sure why. Never waited 10-12 minutes just to get a wrap with macaroni salad. Absolutely ridiculous. He also didn't even ask me once if I needed anything. Now regarding food. The wrap. 12.25. Are you seriously out of your mind or what ???!!! Never have I ever paid that much for a wrap. Also the wrap was extremely small and the portion of the macaroni salad. A joke. I honestly don't recommend this place. Stay away guys unless you really craving for pizza. I might go back just for a slice or two. And will order take out. Def not sitting there. The meal with drink was 16$. And you expect me to give you tip with horrible service. Hell no !!  At the owner , your staff needs to get their **** together. Peace
2021-04-24,3,Pizza comes very charred and with a strong smokey flavor. Not for me but maybe some like that.
2021-04-19,5,Tired of places in Hoboken getting undeserved negative reviews. Great thin crust brick-oven pizzas with fresh mozzarella and a heathy amount of toppings, italian classic entrees that are generously portioned and reasonably priced. Love how you can get your side pasta with a specialty sauce (vodka, bolognese, etc) for $2 more...really adds to a meal. Inside is nothing special ie: your typical pizza shop, but remember you are also paying pizza shop prices. Delicious food both inside, delivery or take out. Young friendly staff as well. Would take over the highly/over rated 10th Street (burnt) Pizza any day of the week. The pictures don't lie!
2021-03-21,5,I got a few slices for takeaway and it was delicious. If I'm ever back in the area I'll be sure to stop by again. I'd highly recommend the Sicilian style pepperoni
2021-03-15,5,Best gluten free pizza crust I've had before! I always order via their Napolis app and the pick up is fairly quick. My go to place for gluten free pizza. Their pasta dishes are also great! Gf penne available!
2021-03-13,4,My go to spot for a penne vodka pizza in the area - always delicious! Pie is sometimes a little too crispy, but it's great reheated that way!
2021-03-05,5,Best pizza spot in Hoboken. You won't find a better slice than the chipotle bruschetta ranch
2021-02-27,1,The pizza here is pretty good!The bad rating was for the unbelievably BAD service!!!! Our waitress was working very hard all by herself with NO help/support at all!!!!!!!  Came here last weekend, we sat outside, took forever to order, and get the high chair and utensils. Kind of ridiculous, it was early Sunday night, it was not busy at all! Ordered half margarita and half sausage pizza and fries. Food came very quick. But the pizza was missing sausage, and the fries were soft and oily. Asked the waitress to fix the pizza, they ended up putting sausage all over the pizza. Anyway, the pizza was very good!After a long day/week, husband was really craving pizza, so came bk tonight. It was busy. But only one waitress was really busy running around and taking care of all the tables both inside and outside. Many of the service ppl were just standing by the kitchen chatting! My table was dirty, took the guy forever to come clean it, and he only cleaned half of the table, the other side of the table was still covered with bread crumbs. After we've told them we were ready to order, all of the service ppl including another waitress were just standing there doing nothing, and waiting for our poor waitress to finally come take the order. When it's busy, you jump in and help! We were starving. It did not help when the waiter messed up the order and put a plate of food in front of my baby, then took it away!!! The pizza finally came, most of the slices only had 1 or 2 pieces of sausage on them?!!!! Seriously!!! After dinner, it took 20 min to get a to go box, another 10 min for the ice cream and the check!!!!Many places run much more efficiently with more tables, higher run around, with less staff! It's no rocket science! You cannot expect 1 waitress to take orders, run the food, box the food and take care of the checks with NO support!!! Never felt so irritated and annoyed after a meal. Ruined my weekend!
2021-02-15,1,I felt compelled to write a review after my delivery yesterday. During this time, I really make it a point to support restaurants since I know they are struggling. I was excited to order a heart shaped pizza for Valentine's Day. I ordered at 5:45pm and was told an hour. My order didn't arrive until 7:20pm. I ordered a heart shaped pie, mozzarella sticks and chicken parm sliders. All of which arrived cold. It wasn't even lukewarm. I was most excited for the pizza and so was my 6 yr old daughter as I had seen so many videos of nice heart shaped pies on Napoli's Instagram stories. My pie arrived cold but also burnt. How this was allowed to be sent out to anyone is ridiculous. I complained. No attempt whatsoever by Napoli's to make things right. Our $50 Valentine's dinner was a disaster.
2021-02-12,5,I've been going to Napoli's (Washington location) for years now and thought I'd come again because I've been craving pasta so much! They never disappoint. Me and my boyfriend got the garlic knots and they were extremely tasty. Perfect amount of salt and garlic. The bread wasn't too soft or tough either. I got my usual delicious spaghetti and meatballs. The meatballs are always really big which I love but I would only say that they should put more pasta since they are so big. My boyfriend really enjoyed his chicken parm with linguini too. I also have to say that our waiter (I believe her name is Agnes) was exceptional. She had the biggest smile ever despite it being 2 hours til closing. She was so upbeat and catered to our table in a quick manner and was always available if we needed something. I also love that they give free refills and she immediately refilled our cups. Overall great experience as usual!
2021-02-09,5,I LOVE this place. The fiancé goes for the veal parm, and I go for the pasta di Napoli. The pizzas are also delicious. I am a garlic knot snob, and these are perfection. Highly recommend the next time you crave Italian!
2021-02-06,1,First and last time. There's a girl making pizza with her long hair down and the girl at the cash register is handling  pizza slices and money with bare hands. Not one glove! Ew never again .
2021-01-31,5,Pizza spots are a dime a dozen in Hoboken, but this place stands out from the rest. Vodka prosciutto pizza, vodka chicken parm, and arancini couldn't have been better. If you're in the area you need to check this spot out
2021-01-05,5,The uptown Napolis has been my go-to pizza place in Hoboken for the last 8 years.  Now with the new streetery they built and the extended outdoor dining section, there's plenty of seating outside and they are BYO which is a bonus.  Their pizza never disappoints.  I love their white pie, margarita, and pepperoni. I also like to sub vodka sauce and add a pesto drizzle to their pies.  I always prefer to pick-up vs. get delivery since their delivery can take a very long time.  I also usually call my order in since with all the substitutions/modifications I make to the pies, I get worried the order will be wrong processed online.   Their chicken parm sandwich sub vodka sauce is also really good!
2020-12-30,2,We totally respect the fact that restaurants are doing their best to make things work during this time but this place has rude wait staff and the ones taking orders on the phone don't know better. Waited for an hour plus to pick up our order when we were told it's going to 45 mins at worse. Fine - kitchen is backed up, it happens. But telling me while I'm waiting that we said it's an hour and we still have 5 mins to go is not okay! There are a lot of places in town that need business, we will be happy to take ours elsewhere.
2020-12-29,1,Wow. Once again Napoli wins the award for rudest restaurant in Hoboken. And to think I wrote a review 18 months ago, again about their rude service. This time I was waiting an inordinate amount of time to get my change for ordering just two slices. I'm a patient person, but as the wait was getting unreasonable, I had to question twice what was going on. Then some gal with a blonde page 'do with bangs, who I never even talked to, came out with my change and a rude comment I didn't quite catch. When I asked her to repeat herself, she stormed off, and then I heard some snide remarks about me from inside. Mind you, I'd never even laid eyes on her, nor was I loud or disrespectful to ANYONE. Naturally, a normal person would have given me a courteous apology for making me wait, but this place has such a consistently uppity cliquish attitude which borders on contempt.  You would think with Covid that a place like this would be  grateful for your patronage, but I'm more than happy to stay away another 18 months. The only courtesy I received was from the Latino pizza chef, who gave me a sympathetic look as he shrugged his shoulders. What a miserable place to work. I feel for him.
2020-12-26,2,Food is amazing, this review is not about that. I've been going to napolis for years and had an awful experience with the waitress with dark hair and highlights. Incredibly rude to me and ignored me until I spoke up and actually rolled her eyes.
2020-12-11,5,Napolis is my go to for game night pizza, late night pizza, parties and days when you just need a pizza and a side of chicken fingers. The honey mustard that comes with the chicken fingers is a major craving of mine. If your looking to have a classic pizza night, order Napoli's!
2020-11-17,5,Delicious pizza with vegan cheese and fresh basil, got this pizza to-go and it was amazing.  They don't advertise that they have vegan cheese on the menu but they do! Just ask :)
2020-11-08,4,Delicious food but take out of regular food is sometimes hit or miss unfortunately. Pizza is always great and can rely on them for a great slice. They do have outdoor dining with heat lamps and have just built a beautiful roofed parklet that I am excited to eat in!
2020-10-30,4,Looking for an Italian BYOB option? Napoli's is it. Their portions are huge .. and I mean it! Get ready to eat and be stuffed.We tried their bruschetta, pizza, eggplant parm, and a sandwich. We were given the wrong sandwich but our waitress fixed everything in snap.
2020-10-17,5,We were introduced to Napoli's through the 5K for Pizza. We wanted to come back and were not disappointed! We ordered the Sicilian pizza, strawberry salad (special menu) and buffalo chicken pizza. Everything was delicious, with even typically overpowering ingredients, such as goat cheese and buffalo sauce, blending in nicely with the rest of the dish. We will be back!
2020-10-07,5,By far the best pizza pizza around!   Thin, crispy, cooked well done and so many choices.  My absolute favorite is their vodka sauce pizza with a pesto drizzle.   Try their pizza you won't be disappointed.
2020-09-09,4,Good pizza. I got the chicken bacon ranch pie. It was a Tuesday afternoon and i was in the area. I took pictures and videos of the pizza. Prices are fair for its value. Purchased a entire pie for 2 people and had enough to take home for left overs
2020-08-29,1,Ok, I walk into Napolis and I see that the food prep pizza maker has his mask on his chin not covering his face chatting it up with the other pizza maker, so I turn around and walk out. Come on, you HAVE to do better than this, we are in the middle of a pandemic and this behavior is unacceptable.
2020-08-21,5,Poppin pizza!Really enjoy the pizza hereThey have outdoor seating.I actually went a day it was raining and I got to sit comfortably at a dry table.The couple by us were completing the food as well.It's a byob And the service is great
2020-08-16,2,Gluten free pasta was so undercooked it wasn't edible, and eggplant parm had a really off-putting taste like it was made with cheap boxed breadcrumbs. Ended up throwing out the entire meal, which was a huge bummer. Saving grace was that me husband shared his arancini which were really good.
2020-08-02,5,Consistently great food with even better service when you dine in. Have been enjoying outdoor dining once a week during quarantine. Napolis is doing a great job of disinfecting between customers and also keeping the cutlery sterile.
2020-08-02,4,Love this place!! Great brick oven pizza & great service!! We just moved here & we've never been disappointed! They even gave us a pen!They have two locations, one opened downtown just as lockdown occurred!! I'm sure they'd welcome the business there. They normally have outside seating so they're used to giving good service where other businesses are still figuring it out. Go here! You won't regret it!
2020-07-28,5,I love this place. I order from them all the time. My fave is their mussels & pizza salad. I can't get enough. Anything you order on the menu is great.
2020-07-19,4,I tried the Veal Marsala for takeout.  It was delicious!  The Marsala sauce was a little sweet and very good.  It was just a little too oily.  We got a side of spaghetti in garlic and oil.  The broccoli rabe was very good but I was hoping for a larger portion.All in all it was good.
2020-06-25,3,Today I tried the bruschetta for the third time still mediocre though highly rated by friends. Plain slice is probably the best offering.
2020-06-23,5,Can't go wrong, everything is delicious. Personal favorite is the rigatoni and chipotle pizza
2020-05-24,1,COVID HEALTH VIOLATION - In the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic, the cooks and staff are making pizzas without gloves and wearing face masks on their chin (not covering the mouth and nose). What a world!
2020-05-19,4,Overall delicious Italian food. The pasta Di Napoli is amazing and we would definitely recommend. It's a cream based sauce but not too heavy. The veal Parmesan was just okay, as we weren't a fan of the sauce. The pizza however was so good and might be our new takeout pizza spot. We ordered the ciao bello with the oil drizzle. Definitely a good choice considering we didn't like their red sauce!!
2020-05-17,2,This used to be our favorite spot! We took the kids her every weekend for the pizza and pasta for years! But within the last year the takeout has really gone downhill. The pasta used to be loaded with chicken and roasted peppers and now it's mostly just noodles. The pizza is thinner, more burnt and the ones with toppings seem light. Really disappointed. My husband even reached out after our last order saying that he was disappointed in the pizza he got as he went for pickup right at 20 min after he called in an order and his pizza was cold once he got it in the car. He decided to push past this, maybe they're busy it's hard times, but got home and wow the cheese pizza was paper thin and the pizza with chicken was severely burnt with very little toppings! We spent $40 on two pizzas. After reaching out he was instructed to send a photo to a phone number and then was ignored. Terrible customer service! There are many other Italian and pizza places in Hoboken we will he taking our business elsewhere.
2020-05-13,5,By far the BEST PIZZA around! Staff is super friendly and food is amazing!  Tried the Sandwiches, Pasta & Pizza, all A++ ! Delivery drivers are real cool but in my opinion food is best when you eat it fresh at the restaurant!
2020-05-06,1,Ordered food and drink from here. Usually love their pizza but food was cold, forgot drink, and the delivery guy was AWFUL!  He rang the door bell 20 times fast without pausing. We jumped up to get the door right away and the door bell didn't stop ringing until we opened the door. SO RUDE! He had an annoyed inconvenienced look on his face when we opened to take our food. I called to tell them how rude he was because common sense you don't ring someone's bell like that when they're paying for a service (or ever).The female on the phone said "we'll talk to him" and hung up on me. Nice. The food usually is good and I'm sure they're busy but that doesn't make this ok when I'm paying for a service. Hope he gains some manners and the female on the phone also. Thanks
2020-05-03,5,One night last week we ordered dessert from here. We ordered the brownie Napoli and the tiramisu.I didn't think it would be as good as it was!Order arrived on time and everything was packed neatly and hot brownie. Vanilla ice cream for brownie was cold and none melted and tiramisu was cold.Tiramisu was excellent! It was almost like the one we made and enjoyed in Rome. Great flavor, great creaminess. Excellent portion. Not overpriced.The brownie Napoli was so rich and chocolatey and had a crunch and soft inner. Topped with vanilla ice cream was sooo perfectly delectable! Also not overpriced.We will definitely order again!! ****Best to order directly through their website or call them so they get the money and not grub hub or seamless.****Not bad for $13!
2020-04-18,5,Great pizza - Hoboken is not short of pizza joints, but this place is top.  Great pizzas, love the chicken Parm, great eggplant parm, the portions are outrageous, the food is always good.  When we order in, the deliveries are pretty quick and the food is always really hot, really good.  We don't talk about 'getting pizza' we talk about 'getting Napoli's'....
2020-04-16,3,Ordered a pepperoni pizza and bacon cheeseburger for take out . The food was fresh, good and made to order correctly ( Fries were very good which boosted the score) Naturally Hoboken is a very competitive City for Pizza and burgers. I would rate 3.5 stars and a dependable option
2020-04-08,5,Best pizza in Hoboken!! Can't go wrong with any slices. Fast service and great service as well!
2020-03-23,5,Love this place, best pizza in town. Support your  favorite small businesses during this crazy time. A world without Napolis vodka pizza....
2020-03-06,1,Placed an order for delivery - the wait time online said 60 to 75min.  The order took over 1.5 longer than the estimated wait time. They gave me no indication that the food would be delayed. When I ask for a refund they refused, and said the delivery was on the way ( I call twice with a 30 minute window).  I've place orders for pick up through Grubhub or delivery.com and when I go in to pick up they haven't even looked at the order.
2020-03-05,5,Great local pizzeria in Hoboken. Sausage and peppers hero is a great deal especially during their lunch special. Can also get 2 slices and a side for $5 for lunch. They also have a downtown location that is not as busy.
2020-02-26,1,I ordered delivery. One small pizza and one buffalo chicken wings made me wait for 1.5 hours and the pizza was burnt. Will never order delivery from here again!
2020-02-13,4,I will drive the 20 minutes to pickup there crispy, slightly charred individual pie especially the Meat Lovers.   This is the closest to the real deal as it gets and I tend to order from Martio's Pizza in Nanuet, NY when I go to Rockland County (they too use the wood-burning oven for after 5pm).    if you are more a coal-fired pizza fan, it's a different experience.   I just wish the owner of Napoli's of Hoboken opened a shop in Edgewater.
2020-02-08,5,Best. Pizza. In. Hoboken. My family will not order from anywhere else in town on principle. The family of the guy who owns it founded Lombardi's, the oldest pizzeria in America (which we used to live around the corner from), where he worked for a dozen years. Margarita is as good as Lombardi's used to be. Their Vodka pie is possibly the best slice I have ever had.
2020-01-19,3,I'm a pretty big fan of Napoli's alll together to be honest. Last two times they have really disappointed me. I called in to place an order for pickup. I happen to be one of the odd people who enjoy onions on my pizza. I asked the woman on the phone to put EXTRA EXTRA onions on half of the pie (emphasis on the onions). You would think there's an onion shortage based on what I got. See the photo.  Otherwise, the pizza was good, but this is the second time in a row they ignored my request. If you want any proportion of topping, make sure you repeat it a few times.
2020-01-18,1,Pizza is not hard to come by in Hoboken, which is all the more reason for eaters to be selective and pizzerias to show some care for their craft. I normally go through a few tries before I can't judgement, but Napoli's takeout pie was so bad I can't bear another wasted meal from there. What I look for in a good NJ slice is a slight crisp, gooey cheese, and a good flavor. Napoli's cheese pie came out crisp as a rock, and a slice would not bend if you tried. The cheese was a harden layer of skin that covered the pie. You'll find better pies from Giovanni's and 10th Street. Heck, I'd take Benny's on its worst day over what I got here.
2020-01-03,3,Ok there is good news and bad news here.  I have ordered three times in the past month or so.  This last order was very unfortunate.  I am figuring the trick is to order small pies, we ordered two large 18" pies and they were literally so burned we couldn't even eat one of them.  We literally threw it out. One other time I ordered a large and a small and the same thing, the large pie was very over done. This time the other large one a Margarita was better but not by much.  When we have ordered just small 10" pies we loved, loved them.  Delicious each time. We have eaten at the place too and the same thing, small pie all the way.  The pasta delicious too, they make a nice sauce.  However, the fact that they actually sent us such overdone pies twice on delivery I felt I had to leave this review.  We tip very well for deliveries and we expect that if they burn it they should call and say it will be longer, make another pie and send it.  They do have another location downtown, maybe we need to try that one next time.
2019-12-22,2,Tried delivery again, this time on an off hour to see if that would make it a better outcome. Somehow worse. The pizza was limp and cold; it actually tastes reheated.  I'm sure it's pretty good in the restaurant because the flavors are good, but even though they get it to you in under an hour, they suck at delivery.
2019-12-10,3,Really unfortunate situation. Great food, but not great service.A few months back (I waited to post this so nobody would get in trouble) my girlfriend and I went to Brick and had a new waitress. We ordered a 10 inch pizza ($11.95) and some appetizers. The waitress brought out an 18 inch pizza ($18.95.) "Oh, I'm so sorry," I said, "but we ordered a 10 inch."The waitress was so apologetic and told us she was new and still getting the hang of things. "Not a big deal. Thank you," I said.I assumed (wrongly) we wouldn't be charged for her error.Wrong. We were charged for an 18" pizza despite only asking for a 10".
2019-12-08,3,Great food and service but pricing has recently turned screwy and designed to rip you off.  Probably why their Yelp rating has now dropped down overall to 3 stars.  See attached copy from menu.  A personal meat lover pizza is 3 ingredient classic for 13.00.  But on build your own side, you can order same exact pizza and pay only 11.05.  Huh??
2019-11-19,3,Pizza is good and local.  Other than that there is nothing special about it.  The only reason we order is because it's on delivery and close to home.
2019-11-16,2,Incredibly dry pizza and clearly burnt (as seen in photos). Waited for the pizza for a long time and while the staff was helpful, people placing orders over the counter got their food quicker than I did. A little disappointed, as this used to be one of my favorites.
2019-11-10,5,Ordered late on Saturday night (10:30pm) after a long day in the city- food came under an hour and was hot and fresh! I ordered Tuscan chicken panini and mozzarella sticks. I really liked the panini- it was larger than I thought so I only ate half. So good! Chicken was delicious! I'd highly recommend!!!
2019-11-09,4,The pizza here is delicious, particularly their vodka pie is very good and smells delicious when it arrives. The wings were good but not the best ever, but they are solid pizza wings and the meat fell off of the bone they were so juicy. I personally prefer when the skin is crispy but otherwise they were yummy.
2019-10-31,1,I order 2 small pizzas through a delivery service. I gave them 1.5 hours (I live literally a few blocks away from the restaurant). I called the restaurant; several times, the phone number didn't even work, when I did get through, I was put on hold 5 different times. They had my order but blamed it on the delivery service for the delivery time. Then they hung up on me. I have never in my life had such terrible service.
2019-10-29,1,Terrible service. The waiter just ignore us and let us wait there. Also, no other waiter come to help even though they see us standing there.
2019-10-29,3,Nice pasta but sometimes service not really good.Sorry for the good waiter but one mistake can destroy all thing.Today we went there and get into restaurant and no one lead us to seat even we said 'Table for three' to one waitress. She just ignore us. Again, sorry for 3 stars...
2019-10-28,5,The best pizza you can find in hoboken! Their Margherita pie is a classic- also super crispy and so quick. Can never go wrong here!
2019-10-25,1,We ordered pizza around 8:30pm, waited close to 90 minutes (which is expected on a Friday night) for it to arrive, only to find half the pizza flipped over in the box. We called and texted pictures of the pizza. The man who answered initially handled the situation, and said he couldn't make the decision to refund us, so his manager, who's also the owner, needed to call us to discuss. The owner looked at the pictures and told us nothing was wrong with this pizza; just a "few slices were flipped over." THAT'S YOUR STANDARD?!? We weren't interested in getting new pizza delivered since it was already 10pm. If they could have delivered new pies in 10-15 minutes, we would have considered it, but when asked how we wanted to handle, we asked for a refund.After arguing for about 10 minutes (which is ridiculous), we were finally offered the refund. To his credit, the owner also offered us 2 free pies (to be used tonight or otherwise), but that was after the heated argument, which should have never happened in the first place. The pizza that was delivered was subpar, and customers shouldn't have to jump through hoops and argue with the owner at 10pm to get their money's worth, or at least something resembling what they ordered. As a Hoboken resident of 10+ years, it's disappointing that a staple in town has such poor customer service. It shouldn't take 20 minutes to argue about a pizza that was CLEARLY mishandled during the delivery. Shame, Napoli's, because your food is very good but the risk isn't worth the reward.
2019-10-22,5,This spot is perfect for a small get together. It was my first time having the vodka pizza and it was amazing. The server was very attentive and we decided to stay for dessert. The tiramisu was very moist and probably one of the best one's I've had in a while.
2019-10-21,4,I haven't had a bad pizza from here yet. The food is always good and fairly priced. Its BYO which always helps the wallet too. Delivery times are fast and food shows up the same as you get right in the restaurant.
2019-10-13,1,Both times I've been to this location, I've picked up the pizza and drove it 3 blocks and it's been ice cold. ICE COLD. If you want Napoli's, go to the Clinton location. Both times I've called them and they won't take any responsibility. They couldn't care less. You'd get better service with Domino's.
2019-10-07,3,We visited for a decent business lunch. Started with some salad, mussels and garlic knots meatballs before a ton of pizzas. As the coffee machine was broken we skipped that but finished with some cannolis and ice creams. We will maybe come back if nothing else is opened like on a Monday, else there are better places in the area.
2019-09-22,5,Visiting family in NJ and had to make a trip down to the waterfront for pictures of the city...All the walking made us hungry and we sought Yelp for advice for good Italian take out.Napoli's popped up as one of the closest within walking distance and I'm glad we had a chance to try their pasta dishes. Having flown in a few days prior from Cali, we'd had our fill of NY/NJ pizza for the moment and were happy to try east coast pasta: Twice the portion size, half the price, and yet still delicious. Great for families on the go!Service was great...they had our order packed and ready when we arrived and even accommodated a last minute change. But I must disagree with the kid who took care of us...it's not possible to get tired of the skyline of Manhattan...but you're welcome to check the puny skyline of SF, just to be certain, lol.
2019-09-14,2,7 dollars and 11 cents for two plain slices and a 12 oz that is half filled with ice. Smh. During the week they have a lunch special.  Same for 5 dollars out the door. I guess no one has lunch on Saturday's and sundays? Does the market for bread cheese, sauce and a soft drink go up 2 dollars and 11 cents on weekends?
2019-09-08,1,TERRIBLE SERVICE. Pizza is okay.. customer service is bad. There are better pizza options in Hoboken. We will never order from here again.
2019-09-03,2,Napoli's has delicious food, very good wraps, lunch specials and slices. Their biggest fault is that they don't take accountability for their mistakes and have very bad customer service. I've waited over two hours for a plain pizza two blocks away, and when I called I was told that they have to make all of the orders placed in advance first so if I need a pizza at a certain time to place the order the day before. When the pie arrived it wasn't hot and it tasted as though it had been made an hour and a half before but was sitting on top of the oven to keep it warm. I have experience working in a pizzeria so I know that the issue was that they had far more orders than their drivers could keep up with but instead of taking accountability or being honest about how long the order would take they said I should've placed the order a day before. I've ordered wraps many time with extra sauce that I've paid for and not received the sauce, I've received the wrong order and simply eaten the order I received because I don't want to wait another order. The women on the phone always seem to have a coldness to their voice that spreads negativity. SO TO CONCLUDE- when the food is right and on time it's absolutely delicious, but at least 50% of the time your order will be wrong or late, and unless you get the one very kind man on the phone you are sure to receive a cold greeting.
2019-08-15,4,Food is awesome but a catcalling oven staff can be a major reason to not wanna walk in to pick up a to-go order here
2019-07-25,4,Natalie and I rolled up here for a hump day dinner date around 9:30.  We had heard the buzz on the streets and had been wanting to come here for months. It's byo so we picked up a bottle of cab and made our way up there.  The place was half full which isn't bad for the time of night. It was comfortable and welcoming. We got ourselves a table outside seeing as it was a beautiful night.   To start, we got an order of the calamari. It came out crispy and tender with a side of marinara sauce and a sweet and spicy sauce. The sweet and spicy sauce took it a notch up.  It gave a standard calamari dish a little funky twist which we enjoyed. Next we split a personal vodka pie w pesto on top and another personal buffalo chicken pie.  We are huge pesto fans so the $2 extra charge for the pesto was well worth it.  Both pies came out great. The tomato sauce on the vodka pie was not too sweet and the cheese to sauce ratio was spot on.  The crust wasn't too thick nor too thin, not terribly crunchy nor too doughy.  The buffalo pie was a pleasant surprise. There was no buffalo or ranch but I'll tell you right now I don't regret it at all. The buffalo sauce was something else. A buffalo sauce like this had never touched my lips. It wasn't overly spicy but the flavor was all there.   Natalie gets all the credit for ordering an extra side of sauce. We brought it home with us.  Overall, two bonafide badass pies.  My only criticism is more of a personal preference but I wish the pies had been cooked just a bit longer to give them a little more of a well done bottom.  I'll add the service was great. Our waiter was a younger guy who was very polite and pleasant even when dealing with the rude family sitting across from us who wouldn't know the words "please" and "thank you" if you shoved it down their throats.  Props to the waiter for being professional and brushing them off bc obviously I can't. Definitely coming here again. One of the best date spots I've been to in Hoboken.
2019-07-24,5,Delicious pizza! Really like the different variety they offer and portions are large. Plus, BYOB is a bonus.
2019-07-21,4,Some of the best pizza in Hoboken. Pasta dishes are great as well. BYOB makes it fun for everyone. Highly recommend !!
2019-07-17,5,I ordered a pizza to go. I picked it up and it was delicious... vodka sauce pizza with meatballs and portobello mushrooms. The meatballs were mini and so delicious. Honestly one of the best pizzas I have had in Hoboken.
2019-07-05,2,I have eaten her in the past and it good, not quite as good as El Presidente said but still decent. Today was a total fail! How do you go in at dinner time and get lukewarm, greasy and flavorless pizza!? This was the most flaccid pizza I ever had, no structure, tough crust that was way too chewy. Still cannot get over how they served it almost cold. The crew working the dinner shift on July 5 is clearly the third string, they do not know what they are doing. They would all be fired(and deservedly so) if the owner were to come in now. The millennials eating here seem to enjoy the pizza... clueless idiots.
2019-07-01,5,Favorite pizza place in Hoboken.  Pizza is amazing and so many choices.  Favorite pizza is the Penne Vodka pizza.  A must try if you're visiting Hoboken.
2019-06-26,5,Love Napoli's! It's my go to take out spot. They have a really great vodka slice and white slice. I like to get the personal pies for $11. They can communicate instructions with the delivery drivers a little better, but they make a mean pizza.
2019-06-12,4,Napoli's is my favorite pizza spot in Hoboken, which I think is also a general consensus amongst all Hoboken residents. Because it's so popular sometimes the delivery could take over an hour, but it's worth it. My go-to order is the penne vodka pizza with fries or regular penne vodka with sausage if I'm feeling hungry. The pizza is a regular thickness, but on the scale between thin crust and deep dish it's closer to thin crust. The penne vodka pizza sauce is delicious with fresh mozzarella melted on top, and the crust is nice and crispy. The french fries are crispy too even when ordered for delivery! And the regular penne vodka with sausage is also very tasty, the sausage is a bit salty but I clearly love it. I'd recommend Napoli's to anyone who loves food period.
2019-06-05,4,i asked the waiter for mozzarellas stick to start of with and i had to tell the dude 4 times didn't get it until i left home but aside from that everything was good the food was good and i had a good time
2019-06-05,3,After eating at Napoli's for over a year, I can safely say that the food here is very much in the pretty good range no matter what you want to get. From pizzas, to pasta, and even their Mozzarella sticks, your choice at Napoli's will generally be tasty and very filling. Of particular note is their Cajun Pasta, different upscale pizza selections, and eggplant and shrimp parm.However the real knock on this place is the service, both in house and for delivery and pickup. If you come hungry, well lets just say you are going to wait awhile for your food. Just last night I came in to pickup my food at the time designated on my e-mail and they had not even started on my order yet. When I tried to talk to a staff member they just brushed me off saying they were busy when the restaurant was practically empty at 9:45 pm. Also if you want to substitute anything be prepared for a huge up charge. Simply changing around a sauce is gonna cost you $2...I have not really heard of that anywhere else.
2019-05-30,1,Napoli's has great food, don't get me wrong. However when placing a delivery it consistently takes forever. Just ordering pizza should not take over an hour. This is not a one time occurrence. They consistently take over an hour to deliver. One time they did not even make my order after an hour and a half. They need to fix their process for their customers. Using their app is no help. Napoli's, you are slow! Do something to improve !
2019-05-30,5,Always a great spot for a few fast slices! Fast delivery or easy pick up at the restaurant. Slices are delicious and a few different varieties. Don't forget to get a side of garlic knots.
2019-05-04,2,Pizza box came all smashed up and most of the pizza was in the corner of the box. The pizza that was left still tasted pretty good, but not going to be ordering delivery from here again. Clearly their delivery drivers don't care. Very disappointing.
2019-05-04,4,There pizza is very very good. Highly recommend the Margarita as it's very flavorful. The service in store was very good, contrary to some of the other reviews. I just moved in down the block and will definitely be back!
2019-04-22,5,Came from the West Coast. It was late night and this place was opened. Surprised by the quality and size for the pizza. I recommend it to others that are visiting the Hoboken Area. The staff is friendly. Hear experience overall!
2019-04-10,2,Food is good, it is the service that is a problem, especially when it comes to delivery. The first time, they didn't even get my order we placed online through their website, and gave us a hard time when we called. It showed up on my credit card statement, but they claimed it never went through on their end. They then said they would credit us and never did. The second time, they forgot part of my order and claimed it was in the box. Luckily there are a million pizza places in hoboken to try that won't give me a headache.
2019-03-15,4,Very solid pizza place to grab a bite. My favorite is the penne vodka. The service is quick and attentive. However, I ONLY order take out as I live a block away, I can't speak for the actual dine in experience. Price is fair, quality is good but the selection they have on display to sell by the slice is usually the same old every day and doesn't have the more "exotic" slices that you'd have to order by the pie. Plan to stand around and dodge the employees while you wait for your order or pay as there is no where to sit unless it is not busy. Other than that, a good place to save your dinner plans.
2019-03-04,4,Good pie with some great options. Typical brick oven pie where some parts are burnt and hard and other parts just right.  Tough to regulate.  I had a Margarita slice and chipotle chicken slice. Margarita was great and the chipotle had good flavor. Friendly staff makes this a good place for a few slices at lunch or dinner. I would go again and try some other of their specialty slices.
2019-02-18,4,We go regularly. Our standing order is arancini, a salad, and a personal pizza. Service is excellent and friendly. The food is fabulous. Once we also ordered takeout, and the food was delivered within half an hour. I highly recommend it.
2019-02-17,5,Favorite pizza place in the area! Very efficient, decently priced and consistently delicious.
2019-01-29,5,My all time favorite pizza place in Jersey and NY! I got here almost weekly- and always bring visitors from out of town- my parents were so delighted with how delicious the pizza was (and that is major kudos from them). My personal fav is the Vodka Pizza with pepperoni - the biggest size you can get. A+
2019-01-23,5,They never fail... food is great.. and service is quick.. I've always had their deliveries.. never eaten at the actual establishment.. but I can't complain..
2019-01-22,5,Ever since I moved to Hoboken I have tried many pizzeria but I would have to say Napoli's is my favorite there pastas are amazing the desserts are mouth watering and of course there pizza is amazing always cooked to perfection
2019-01-17,5,Best pizza in Hoboken hands down. Get the penne vodka pizza, it will change your life
2019-01-07,5,Came here and ordered pepperoni pizza.  Service was fast and friendly.  Pizza was delicious.  Better than the places downtown.
2019-01-06,4,I believe Napoli's has the best pizza in hoboken.   It's a thin, crispy brick oven crust and they are generous with, but they don't over do, the toppings.  I can't give them 5 stars because I feel the sauce is a little too sweet and they don't put enough cheese on the pies.   Still good - especially for a late night, second dinner.
2019-01-03,5,I finally got a chance to try out the clam pie that uses clams from their new supplier. I have to say this. The new clams are even better and more supple than the ones used originally in the early pies. Napoli's clam pie is delicious and doesn't overwhelm the pie with loads of cheese like the one at Denino's in Staten Island. Unlike the Denino's version, this one is for pizza fans who love clams - not smothered with cheese like Denino's.
2018-12-21,5,Stopped here on a whim and man was this a gem of a find.  We had two large pies the meat lovers and vodka mozzarella for a table of 8 and still took home leftovers.  One of the best pizzas in NJ for sure.   It's on our list to come back!  Keep doing what you are doing!!!!  It's BYOB so pick up a bottle and make it a night.
2018-12-19,3,Use to be my go to and I'm sure I've written positive reviews but this place went down hill so bad. I think I get more disappointed every time I order but it used to be so good I always try it again. Definitely won't be ordering from here anymore. Most recent experience I even did pick up in hopes it would be better and after waiting 30 minutes of them telling me over and over it wasn't ready, my pizza was cold when they handed it to me. Not what it used to be and wouldn't recommend.
2018-12-13,5,I love the rigatoni with butter from here it's soo good  and they're so nice every time i order. They do mess up sometimes but I eat it anyway cause it's that good lol
2018-12-09,3,Usually a good place but my pizza was burnt and cold when I got it delivered. It was during prime time football on Sunday but still.....
2018-12-05,4,I love Napoli's. I order from here often. I love that You can get great personal pies, I normall get the margarita. I'm also a fan of the penne vodka. Delivery is always quick and food arrives hot. My only complaint would be that sometimes the personal pies have way too much crust and are lacking flavor probably because there is so much less sauce and so much more plain bread (crust).
2018-12-04,5,I have to say this pizza place is fantastic. Great sauce. Tasty specially pies and a nice crust. They never skimp on toppings either. Not to mention the delivery normally gets here at or before the estimated app time and we never have issues with orders. It's my go to pizza place in Hoboken.
2018-12-02,1,really great hidden ... or mayb not so hidden gem in hoboken ! or so i was told =\. really awful experience here at BOTH locations..first place had a private party with no sign on the door or any indication that a party was happening. i was rudely asked to leave by whoever was renting the place saying " get the eff out i rented this place" so needless to say i leftwent to the SECOND location on washington only to be greeted by the snarkiest teenage waitress i've ever seen. she rudely asked what i wanted and when i took too long to reply she started helping some one else who walked in. she was more focused on seating the party than taking my order when i was first. priority was for her tip i guess and not my order... pizza looked disgusting anyway..DO NOT GO HERE
2018-12-01,1,Every part of this was awful.  my food took over an 1 and 1/2 hours to be delivered.  when it arrived, it was ALL cold and I had to heat it up which took more time (calzone can not be heated in microwave).  the Rice Balls were crushed and greasy, the eggplant rolatini was inedible. when I called to tell them, no reaction.  I stopped going to this place for a reason and now, i was reminded.  NEVER AGAIN
2018-11-29,5,Meat lovers pizza is awesome..pepperoni, sausage, meatballs.  Perfect meal for cold winter
2018-11-18,5,I had an issue with Napoli's delivery yesterday but changed my review today because the food is actually darn good and the owner ("Frank") is an authentically nice business professional. I connected with him today and he genuinely cares not only about his business but its customers and in today's world, that is really hard to come by. I lived in Manhattan all my life (the land of good pizza and the best Italian food outside of Italy) so when I met a Jersey Boy from hoboken, I was looking forward to some great pizza due to the NJ connection with the ita community, specifically Hoboken. I was highly dissatisfied with the Italian food in Hoboken until he took me to Napoli's - The food was great, the pizza was great and the owner is a stand up guy. I recommend you try this place before Augustinos, Leo's or other Italian fine dining in hoboken. The pizza at Napoli's is indeed the best in Hobken - Hands down. But the Italian food is very impressive. If you dine at the Washington St. Location, you will not be disappointed.
2018-11-14,4,Ordered 3 large pies for a party - ended up with more than we expected but the price was still good and we enjoyed the variety. The chicken bacon pizza was the most popular we got! Our margarita pizza ended up sticking to the wax paper and a few of us may or may not have eaten some by accident... Yuck! But wasn't a huge deal overall. If we'd eaten it faster maybe it wouldn't have done that - I'm not sure, I've never seen it happen.Delivery also took a little while for only being 2 blocks away but they did warn us it was a busy night and we could have picked it up but chose not to... So no biggie there.
2018-11-09,2,Do not order from this location off any delivery site (Grubhub, Delivery.com, etc). When ordering delivery off these sites, the delivery time is extremely long (2+ hours) as the restaurant clearly does not like to fill these orders. They even have a physical sign in the location saying they lose a percentage of profit when it's through one of these sites.This has happened multiple times to date. To top it all off when you call the workers are very rude when you try to check what's taking so long!
2018-11-02,4,Great pizza! Byob! Good with kids! Packed on friday evenings! Definitely a good value for money.
2018-10-26,1,If you want to wait TWO HOURS for delivery then order from this place. I don't care how good your food is, nothing is worth waiting that long. Keep in mind I live a FOUR MINUTE walk from this place. Ended up going to pick it up ourselves. Probably wouldn't order again.
2018-10-22,1,Came in for a quick bite to eat. Heard good things. Have been sitting here for 25 minutes. Was given a soda and menu after 10 minutes and server has not come back. Leaving now. Hope others have better luck getting served. Really disappointed as only 6 tables have people. Won't be back.
2018-10-11,5,If you're not closing out your weekend with Napoli's, you're doing life wrong. As soon as the clock strikes 5p on a hungover Sunday and the scaries start setting in, my roommate and I already have our chicken parm (with penne and vodka subbed for spaghetti) and arancini on deck to pair with a bottle of red. I can't speak to many of the other menu items, but I've had their pizza before and it's very good. This weekly ritual just brings me such joy and comfort as the clock ticks down to yet another week on the grind.
2018-10-05,3,Best pizza, worst service. If I owned this restaurant I would be really concerned with the rapidly decreasing customer experience.
2018-10-02,4,This is our go to spot when ordering out. The food is always amazing and delivery is always on point. Last night I hosted a few hometown friends and they loved their meals as well.
2018-09-25,5,This place makes an excellent chicken Caesar salad. They don't skimp on the chicken which keeps me coming back!
2018-09-10,4,Quick service, well-priced, and pretty decent pizza. I ordered takeout, but the atmosphere of the place was nice. However, it's hard to find parking around this area.
2018-08-24,4,Best pizza in Hoboken!! I have eaten in the restaurant and also have gotten take out. Margarita pizza very good. Love the chewy airy crust. Also there vodka sauce was excellent!! Will definitely go back!!
2018-08-05,1,Worst pizza ever  ... late , burn, bad quality ingredients I will never gonna order again :/
2018-08-03,5,Reliable and delicious Italian food. Everything from the pizzas to the pastas to the apps would get 5 stars from me.  Try the Margarita pizza - the crust is just the right thickness and theres a perfect distribution of cheese and sauce.
2018-07-30,3,Pizza is pretty good but they play Fox News in the restaurant for all to see. Maybe something a little less controversial can be on the TV?
2018-07-19,5,I have to say ... this post will be both embarrassing and funny. But it will be good to Napoli.It was a long night, and I was hosting. It was a "school" night, so I offered my place up. Everyone needed something to eat, so I let them use my delivery account to order and I went to bed.What I didn't realize was that they were WAY too banged up. Every single person fell asleep. The result was that the food was never delivered.Now here is the thing ... Napoli did nothing wrong. they called my cell phone MULTIPLE times (it was my account that everyone ordered from). The store called me, the delivery people called me. I got texts out the wazoo.MY point is this. They knew their customer was wrong. They still tried to do everything in their power to make it right. They're a class act.By the way, the whole reason we chose them is because the food is great.I won't contest the charges. You guys rock. Thank you, and we are sorry.
2018-07-10,3,Their pizza isn't bad, but today we ordered 2 salads for delivery and they were both pretty mediocre. They were on the small side, they screwed up one order, and had VERY dry chicken on both. $27+ (including tip) for 2 mediocre salads? That seems really steep for what you're getting. I think they need to either teach someone how to cook chicken or remove salad from the menu.
2018-07-06,4,My boyfriend and I come here for Valentine's Day all the time and we are never disappointed. This place is kinda small, but it's so cute and has a special ambiance to it. There is outdoor seating as well which is good for big groups. During the colder months they have the heater on outside so you're not freezing outside which is very considerate. For starters, we got the eggplant rollatini. It was so delicious and filling. This plate is meant to be shared by two people, so if you have a crowd, I recommend ordering multiple plates of it. We are a sucker for their penne vodka. It's not soupy or dry, it is the perfect consistency. Their portion sizes are huge so it took the two of us to finish the penne vodka. We also had the eggplant parm. With the eggplant and chicken parm you can choose what type of pasta you would like on top. The eggplant parm was crispy and cooked well. Last year I had their lobster ravioli which was delicious as well! I'm someone who loves spicy food, so I found the sauce a little too sweet, so I added red pepper flakes. But even without it was delicious. I wish they had given more ravioli as I believe they only gave around 5. Overall this place exceeded my expectations and is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken for Valentine's Day. This place has really big portions so don't over order. I'll be back here soon to try their pizzas!
2018-07-01,1,We ordered from Napoli's and after it didn't arrive for an hour+ we called to check on the order. They assured us that the order was on its way. After another hour wait we called back. The Napoli's employee said she had spoken with the driver who said that the food was delivered to our address. There was NOTHING delivered and we had waited 2+ hours for a simple order. The Napoli's employee then insinuated that we were lying about not receiving the food. If I could give them 0 stars based on how rude and unprofessional the Napoli's employee treated us I would. No one likes waiting 2 hours for a delivery that was expected to take 30 minutes, but calling a paying customer a liar is a different level of bad!
2018-06-25,5,Recently moved to Hoboken and I can't get enough of this place! No matter what you order, everything on the menu is great. The ciao Bello pie is my favorite. It's made with fresh ingredients and truly baked in a brick oven. I've also had the baked ziti, eggplant parm, and garlic knots with no disappointments. The location on Washington has a great atmosphere with outdoor seating and the inside isn't too small. The place is BYOB which is also a plus. Ive definitely made this place my to go spot for Italian food.
2018-06-23,5,This is literally the best pizza in Hoboken. Probably also in New Jersey. If you're a fan of brick oven pizza, premium quality ingredients, and top notch service, chances are you'll love this place.
2018-06-10,3,I ordered and paid for an item that was not delivered with the rest of my food. This makes me hesitant to order at this place in the future especially with a lot of competition for pizza. I appreciate the response from the owner though.
2018-06-05,5,The majority of times when I cave into my pizza cravings, it typically involves a trip to Napoli's - the home of what I think is the best pizza in Hoboken.  It also does not hurt that the place is BYOB and nicer than most quick-serve pie spots.  On my most recent trip, my friend and I sauntered in after an intense afternoon of sangrias at Pier 13, and we were ravenous.  We began our feast by ordering the Pear Salad with the hopes of being healthy.  A generous portion of peppery arugula was sprinkled with cubes of ripe pear, crunchy walnuts, and shaved Romano cheese, and then topped with their house made balsamic dressing.  The salad was fine, but merely a warmup for the carb-heavy main attraction - a small Mediterranean Chicken Pizza.  This pie from heaven was topped with a garlicky tomato sauce, tender grilled chicken, zesty red onions, smoky roasted eggplant, and briny Kalamata olives.  The flavors truly transported us to a seaside café in Italy.  Plus, the small pizza, with its six slices, was the perfect size to complement our salad and fill our bellies.  Definitely keep this fresh and inviting spot top of mind when you get the urge to indulge in a slice...or several!
2018-06-03,5,Haven't tried too many pizza places around Hoboken yet, but this place has great pizzas.  They have lunch specials every day from 12-4, $5 for 2 slices of plain or margarita with a fountain drink or $7 for 2 slices of anything else with a fountain drink.  My favorite here so far is the eggplant parm!
2018-06-03,4,Had an excellent artichoke basil pizza.   Fresh ingredients properly baked crust in the brick oven .  I prefer this over the famous artichoke pizza place in the city
2018-05-15,1,We have been regulars of Napolis for the past 2 years. We order at least once a week and have always loved their food. This time which was our LAST time was a big problem. There was a stink bug on the Napolis sliders still alive in the lettuce!!!! It was so disgusting and we have never experienced this at any establishment. Clearly they do not wash their lettuce. We unfortunately will not order from Napolis anymore as this was a scarring event and a waste of a $50 dinner as we just couldn't eat the rest.
2018-05-12,4,Personally my favorite pie in Hoboken. Specifically the vodka sauce pie, can't get enough. Also the meatballs are unrivaled, on sliders or a sub they are awesome. Wings are up there in Hoboken too, good size, sauce and color with a creamy bleu cheese sauce. And all this talk about bad delivery is news to me, I order through yelp and have never had an issue. In fact, I've had delivery come in 30 minutes in a dang snowstorm!
2018-05-04,1,I finally decided to give Napoli's a try and was disappointed. The food taste and quality is very average but the kicker was when I got to my dessert that I ordered and after I began to eat it I noticed that it was missing ingredients. I contacted the restaurant to fix the situation and after sending a picture to prove that it was missing ingredients I was told the best they could do was a $5 dollar credit mind you the item cost $10.95. I basically said no thank you to the absurd nominal credit and stated I just won't return. Take this as food for thought before eating there and obviously they have poor management.
2018-04-25,4,Phenomenal pizza and probably the best buffalo chicken pie in Hoboken.  But what is with charging a dollar for condiments on the side? Especially a dollar for an extra two tablespoons of marinara sauce.  Come on now, I know there is enough marinara sauce left at the end of the night to go swimming in.  It also seems a little ridiculous to be charged a dollar for salad dressings (ranch, bleu cheese, caesar) that are squeezed out of a bottle of (what is most likely to be) Ken's salad dressing.
2018-04-21,5,My friend and I were trying to look for a spot open past 10pm in Hoboken and we came across this gem. Vito seated us right away and made us feel right at home. He was very attentive and made sure we were doing good the whole time. The pizza was delicious and fresh. We both got a personal pie and I must say, this honestly hit the spot. Drinks on the house! Thanks Vito!!! We will definitely be coming back.
2018-04-07,5,I was in town with a large group and needed 11 pizzas delivered at a very specific time. I was given the recommendation to try Napoli's and I'm very glad I did. The delivery was right on time and the pizzas were fantastic. The delivery person was helpful and polite. I could not be more pleased and I highly recommend them.
2018-04-04,5,It is always easy to type a review when you are angry. You want to do "something" so your frustration streams out of your fingertips.... That is not this review.We have been in town for three days and have eaten at Napoli's twice (already). After a long day in the City it is nice to have a place that feels and treats you like you are home. The Pie (Meat Lovers) is exactly what you should expect, the Pastas are fantastic and even the Cannoli are outstanding and house made. Phil gladly opened our BYOB wine for us and entertained us with stories of the old neighborhood. The constant stream of Uber Eats and take out customers tells me that the rest of the neighborhood thinks this place is pretty great too.I don't know if we will be going back before we fly home, but I would love to try the Garlic Knot Meatball Sliders, they look amazing.
2018-03-27,5,Best pizza in Hoboken! The appetizers and entrees are great too. Nice people and great service in a casual environment.
2018-03-25,3,The pizza is amazing but the service is HORRIBLE. Putting boxes together during dinner rush and ignoring people trying to order? Really frustrating
2018-02-23,1,This was our second time ordering from Napoli's. The first time food was good except for the desert. This time...it took an hour and 45 minutes for the delivery, 40 minutes longer than the time estimate. We called 3 times to get an estimated delivery time. Each time the person said it was "going out in 3 minutes". I understand a delay but would appreciate honesty, if you haven't even put the food in tell us. When the food arrived it was cold and there was chicken on a vegetarian pizza. The restaurant is 5 blocks away. So disappointed. With many other Italian food options in Hoboken, we won't be coming here again.UPDATE: Manager called and offered a credit (with a lot of excuses). Nice gesture, still never going back.Update: The manager never followed through on the credit. So also not truthful.
2018-02-21,4,Went here with a group of friends last weekend and had a great experience.  I called ahead and within 10 minutes they had a table waiting for us.  The waiters were friendly and the food was great! While the garlic knots were really tasty, next time I would probably forgo apps and just stick to pizza and pasta! Only negative is that the ambiance is definitely of a pizza place --they could benefit from dimming the lights a little!
2018-02-09,1,I love their pizza but the delivery time is always more than 2 hours which is very unpleasant since you're ordering when you're hungry and they never mention that it's gonna be so long, you always end up calling the restaurant to get an update which is frustrating
2018-02-02,5,I absolutely love this place!! It's a bit small the restaurant itself but the food is amazing. Best italian food around. Try to eat here at least once a month. Recommend: Spaghetti and meatballs, margarita flatbread, Bruschetta, Chicken parm, and the cajun chicken pasta!!!
2018-01-29,1,I've ordered pizza from Napoli's several times and it's always a gamble when you get your order delivered.  They said expect it in an hour but usually runs over.  With the being said, the most recent order I've experienced with them was the worst.  I waited 2 hours and 15 minutes for the pizza.  I had to call twice to follow up and the manager didn't seem to care at all that it was late nor did she offer to comp the bill.  For someone who works in customer service, I was appalled by this.  If a customer called ME to say they waited that long for their order, I would be so embarrassed and apologetic.  They definitely lost a Hoboken customer.
2018-01-25,4,Brick oven pizza here was good, a little undercooked (not well done) so if you like it crispy you should request that
2018-01-23,5,Started off on the wrong foot, but after few more visits, things got much better. This eventually became our go to place for quality pizza in Hoboken!
2018-01-16,3,The Pizza is 5 Stars, every time. The crust is perfect, cheese is fresh, and the sauce is homemade. The service is usually average to below average and other menu items, with exception of the spinach salad, have been under whelming. Also I'm all for al dente pasta but there's a difference between al dente and undercooked. The pasta is crunchy.  I'm also not a fan of the delivery drivers blocking the spaces in front, I wish they would look into bicycle delivery.
2018-01-04,1,I ate from the new Napoli's on Clinton street and I was very disappointed both times. The first time I ate from this place I had a Margherita pizza, and the sauce wasn't the best I've ever had. The second time I ordered a panini with only veggies (I am a vegetarian) and they put steak in it, and I paid extra for fries and they tasted like they were fried in old oil.  My coworker said she ordered chicken NOODLE soup and it had no noodles. In addition to the food not being good, the customer needs to be better, on the phone and most definitely in person.I doubt that I will ever eat from there again.
2018-01-03,5,Best personal pan pizza in Hoboken! Salads are also very fresh and delicious.Delivery using Grub Hub is fast too.
2017-12-28,5,Okay, so I just moved to Hoboken and I've had the vodka sauce pie 3 Times last week. Needless to say, the food is great, the delivery time isn't bad at all, the buffalo wings were very good. I've been here in the past and have had a few other items on the menu and they've been just as good.  Can't wait to order it again for dinner tonight!
2017-12-03,1,This review is for the delivery "service" I got last Wednesday through seamless. I placed the order at 7:45, delivery time was originally 8:15-8:25 then got moved to 9:15-9:25. At 9:25, I get a call from the delivery person saying he's downstairs. I buzz him in and wait. And wait. I get another call from the delivery person. He's on the wrong street, one block away. The food finally arrives. The Chicken parm was cold and inedible, the cheese melted and hardened over a bed of overcooked linguine. The tiramisu looked like it had been dropped on the floor. I called and spoke to a manager who gave zero sh!t$, offered me $10 off my NEXT order. I said no thanks, I don't make the same mistake twice.
2017-11-26,1,Lost seamless order.  Might be good pizza.  Might not.  Who can know when it never arrives.  All the waiting.  None of the pizza.  ...at least that was my experience tonight.
2017-11-24,4,We'd gotten the Napoli's nod from native New Yorkers/Hoboken residents and decided to stop by for lunch. I'd read on the Napoli's website that the owner is part of the family that founded Lombardi's in NYC so he's from a pizza dynasty. All positive things!The pizza lunch special (everyday, 11 AM-4 PM) currently is either two Margherita or classic slices for $5 or two specialty slices for $7. A fountain drink is included. For the slices, you go up to the counter and pick from what's available.We sat at a table inside (there's outside seating too) and dined on the Napoli sliders ($8.95) and the pizza slices (I got Margherita and veggie). The four meatball sliders on garlic knots were delicious and had come highly recommended from a friend. Neat and unique concept. The pizza was good too but maybe not quite as tasty. The crust was pleasantly crunchy. Veggie featured broccoli, peppers, onions, and basil. The fresh mozzarella was a highlight of both slices. The young man waiting on us was pretty friendly, easygoing, and attentive.So Napoli's may not be quite as good as Lombardi's, but it's a foolproof choice in Hoboken for sure. Try 'em out.
2017-11-24,5,Love this place!!! They have my favorite baked ziti dish. So happy they opened second location on 1st and Clinton. Vito was very welcoming and friendly. Will be there a lot! Definitely recommend:-)
2017-11-21,3,First, the food was very good. Except for the cheese fries...  I had the woman repeat the order back to me on the phone, which she repeated back to me correctly...cheese fries, with mozzarella cheese. This picture says it all- the saddest "cheese" fries I have ever seen- with the wrong cheese...
2017-11-11,1,A few layers to this review - I very rarely write bad reviews.  I think there have been too many things to happen with Napolis for me not to come on here and let people know.  We have been ordering delivery from this place for a while.  EVERYTIME the delivery takes atleast 75-90 minutes for a simple pizza/salad.  Also, our last delivery they brought us the wrong order TWICE and couldn't rectify it.  We had to call the restaurant instead of the delivery person doing it.  No refund or discount or anything.  Boggles my mind when almost every other pizza place in Hoboken is 30-40 minutes and responsive.  Pizza is good but not THAT good, especially in Hoboken.  Secondly, went to their new location on 2nd and Clinton last nite with my wife.  Took about 10 minutes to get seated and it was very disorganized.  It was very clear that they weren't ready to open.  We had to tell THEM that there was an open table for 2.  We finally got seated, had 2 different people come over but no one took our order or even gave us a menu for about 25 minutes (which we had to ask for). The server came to the table next to us 3-4 times and never looked at us.  Not to mention, that table complained about how their pizza came out before their apps and they were cold.  I finally decided to walk out and go to Leo's.  Had a great dinner with great service there.  Don't waste your time here when there are a ton of other places to get pizza in this town.
2017-11-04,1,Unfortunately, I will not be ordering from Napoli's anymore after them lying to me for messing up my order. After contacting seamless they informed me that you CANNOT order online if a restaurant turns off their ordering but Napoli's blamed seamless saying the website allows you to order which isn't true by my photo below. The reality is that they did not follow thru in their order and screwed it up and had to make up an excuse by keeping me on hold to make up the lie. This isn't the first mistake they've messed up for an order of mine or a friends  we tried them again but this time they completely forget my order; never even apologized and said well if you want it; it would be over thirty minutes. If you're incapable of making your food like you say then don't be part of 5+ different online delivery companies.
2017-10-31,5,There's a reason why the line is always out the door and the tables are always full-- best pizza in Hoboken. Every time I've ever ordered from here the food has always been delicious. Napoli's is definitely my go-to pizzeria in the area. Highly recommend.
2017-10-31,4,Ordered from Napoli's one Thursday night around 9 or so for pick-up. Our pizza was ready in about 20 minutes. When we arrived, they were just taking it out of the oven, so we knew it was definitely fresh. We ordered the chicken parm pizza, which breaded chicken, ricotta, and fresh mozzarella. The chicken tasted a bit dry/tough. I'm thinking they maybe just tossed the leftover chicken parm from the night before because it definitely tasted like it was reheated a few times. But aside from the chicken situation, the pizza itself was very good. The ricotta was a nice touch. I would definitely come back and try their other non-chicken pies!
2017-10-29,1,Good pizza in Hoboken but terrible service, namely when it comes to home delivery, They can't clearly manage they order flow and despite ordering the pizza through their app approx 3 hours in advance, 30 minutes before I get a call saying that it will take them 1 hour to 1.5 hours to get it. Their excuse, they got the info from the app too late and I would have to talk to app.
2017-10-28,5,Pizza was amazing, being born and raised in the Bronx ny made me feel right at home! Great pizza and even better food! Service was amazing.. considering how busy they were! Great place!
2017-10-27,1,Never order from here unless you want to wait 2 hours for delivery. Such a joke. Figure it out.
2017-10-27,1,I waited 2.5 hours for my delivery and the delivery lady wouldn't even come up to my apartment. I placed an order at 7:20pm. The estimated wait time was 75-90 minutes. Knowing that it's a Friday...I was patient. I called at 9pm to check up on my order and they said it's on it's way out. It arrives at 9:49pm. The delivery lady called so we buzzed the door open for her. She lied and said she didn't hear the buzzer. Long story short...this restaurant is full of liars. If they told me they forgot my order when I called , I would have cancelled and made instant noodles. But no, they decided it's a good idea to starve their customers. Ps: My food was cold and nasty. Never again...there are so many better restaurants in Hoboken.
2017-10-27,1,Ahhhh where to begin....we had a good thing going...until you went all crazy on me! Let me explain...we've ordered several times...I would say five times. The first, I was freezing one cold winter night in hoboken walking around looking for a pie. I stumbled upon Napoli's and took it home. It was amazing!! Since that night, I have ordered delivery four additional times. The first two were as glorious as the first. Hot, fresh, melted cheese and garlic knots can't be beat. The last two times is where they steered me wrong. On the third time, the pie was burnt...n I mean burnt. Not only underneath, but on most of the edges of the crust and you could tell it had been sitting for a while before it was delivered. The garlic knots also didn't seem as fresh. Mind you, it was nowhere near closing time when we order $40 minus tip, down the drain. We thought it was a fluke, and was craving a good quality pie last night again. Unfortunately I didn't take a picture last night of the mess, so I only have a pic of the underneath of the couple slices we had left over. But I was irritated again last night when the pie arrives and it's burnt again! I had even called as soon as we placed the order online, to specify "please don't burn it like last time" I called and spoke to someone else when the pie arrived and told them it's burnt....again!! The lady apologized, put me on hold, came back and said when you order online, there's an option to click on lightly cooked or something like that...she said if u don't want your pie well done...I said, hey, I don't normally complain, but there is a difference between well done and burned. I even told her this is the second time!! She apologized and that was the end of that. $30 down the drain...and you don't realize it, until you start eating and the edges are so hard you cannot eat them, and the pie is so chewy it's like a workout for your mouth to finish the slice! Ate the last two slices this morning, and was so irritated, I thought this warrants a review. Although I haven't ordered from bergenline pizza in a while, we had one problem, I think it was the lacking of toppings and also missing some of the toppings we had paid additional for or something, but the owner gave our next pie for free, to correct the mistake (I will say there wasn't much of a difference, but at least he handled it professionally and was very nice about it all) Napoli's put me on hold, and came back and said I'm sorry, click on lightly cooked next time we order online. We were at costco earlier and even waiting having their delicious, yet very processed slices so that we can have a proper better quality one at home, and got this. Very disappointed and a bad experience...will not be ordering from here again, maybe will try if I'm in the area and I'm physically there to pick it up and watch as they make it, but even that's a big maybe. There's an abundance of pizza places here and with service and food like that, I can easily go elsewhere. Thanks, but no thanks!
2017-10-22,4,Ordered food from here last night, it came very quickly. We ordered a pizza, but the menu seems pretty expansive. Pizza was great, thin and crispy, and not too greasy or oily. Also a pretty good deal.
2017-10-08,4,Ordered a Grandma pie and it was really good! The sauce was really flavorful, and if you like garlic, you will love this pie.  We also ordered a regular pepperoni pie and the kids seemed to enjoy it.  It looked a little dry to me, but i guess it was good.  Next time, I would probably just order the grandma pie. Its very casual inside, so I would just get take out.
2017-10-02,4,The food is good/ average. The service can be inconsistent. I have been here many times and it generally meets expectations.
2017-09-25,5,As a longtime resident of Hoboken and a loyal Italian, I think Napoli's has the best pizza in town. I also happen to think their food is fantastic as well. I decided to give catering a shot for a small Sunday football party yesterday! This was a last minute plan and their staff (young woman that I can't recall her name) couldn't be more accommodating when I went in late Saturday afternoon to inquire. She directed me to Jocelyn, who was wonderful in helping guide me on my order. I was a little unsure about adding to the order and Jocelyn made herself fully available in the event I wanted make a change (which I did at the last minute the next day). Aside from the great service, the hot dishes and pizza were a hit! The food was all very hot and the Cavatelli & Broccoli was the best some of my guests had eaten. Really delicious! I would highly recommend reaching out to Jocelyn and catering through Napolis for your next party!
2017-09-25,4,definitely adding this spot to the hoboken restaurant rotation! plenty of things to choose from on this menu. tons of different pizza, pastas and sandwiches along with a lot of apps. and its a BYO.we started with a caesar salad. this was probably the least exciting thing we ate. for dinner we shared an order of the chicken fettuccine with spinach and mushrooms (extra $2). we also ordered two personal sized pizzas. really liked that they had 3 size options to order for the pizzas, so we were able to enjoy the chicken bacon ranch (new) and the vodka pizza. both were delicious, i'm a sucker for vodka sauce so that was my favorite of the two. we ended up still taking the equivalent of an entire personal pizza (4 slices) home with us. they proudly display on the wall near their pizza oven that all of their sauces are homemade on premise. again the vodka sauce was really good. definitely stop in here, and if it happens to be a monday they give out free zeppolis!
2017-09-23,4,We often go here. The staff is friendly. There are plenty of pizza places in Hoboken but we like this place a lot. Good choices on the pizza and the option for ricotta on the white pizza is great. We will be back again.
2017-09-21,4,I've been coming here for years! The pizza is great!! Buffalo chicken, and chicken bacon ranch are definite favorites.. it's BYOB so that's great..
2017-09-16,3,Came here for the first time on Monday, the Pizza was outstanding. Crust is thin baked to a perfect crunch. While enjoying our Pizza we observed entrees coming out of the kitchen, each looked better that the last. We instantly decided that returning for dinner was a must.Tonight we did, Yanni was our server. We ordered sodas that are on the menu but Yanni didn't know they carried them. I ordered the chicken parm, two fillets. One was like leather the other very tender. Both were very salty. Also ordered a Caesar salad from Yanni so I wasn't surprised when I got oil and vinegar. This after Yanni told me she was too tired to know what dressings were available.The young man that brought the food turned out to be the owners son. I didn't know it at the time but he volunteered that info when I expressed all my concerns. He sincerely apologized for the food and service, but made no concessions in my bill.I'll be back but will only order their Pizza. Like I Said the Pizza is outstanding, the entrees and service.......not so much. I Hope Yanni gets the training and the nap she so desperately needs.
2017-09-10,4,Probably my favourite spot for pizza in Hoboken. Awesome apps too! I particularly love the white pie and the calamari. What's even better is the place is BYOB and very reasonably priced. I will always be a repeat customer here. I'd definitely recommend for groups, couples and families, and they also have take out options!
2017-09-05,5,Napoli's is one of our favorite pizza places! Not only is the pizza delicious but the customer service is great. We had a request for Jocelyn to help surprise our friends with a special pizza to celebrate their wedding. She went above and beyond to make a unique pizza just for them and we were all thrilled with the outcome! It's not just a place for great pizza, but also for making memories! We will always be grateful to them for making our friends so happy! Thank you, Napoli's!!!
2017-08-29,3,We started off with the garlic knots, which were VERY good. Everything was surprisingly pretty good, considering Hoboken is certainly a town for pizza. We ordered a large vodka sauce pie that was definitely better than most in town. Overall, it's a place I would go back to.
2017-08-12,5,In our opinion, this is the best uptown pizza. Thin, well done pies with delicious sauce. The vodka pie can't be beat-it's a must. Perfect for delivery, but if you want to stop by, it's bring your own and a very casual spot, think pizzeria vibe with a few tables inside and a couple outside. On certain nights, they have Jazz and the twinkle lights outside are a nice touch.
2017-08-11,5,Delicious food and very attentive service! We had the mussels, which were made with their delicious marinara sauce and the caprese salad. The caprese salad was HUGE and had giant slices of delicious buffalo mozzarella and giant beefsteak tomatoes (the tomatoes could've been more flavorful, German Johnson would've tasted better, but still great)! Best gluten free ravioli and meatballs I've ever had! We were completely stuffed by the time we finished our dinner. My only wish is that this place served wine to accompany their delicious food, but it's byob.
2017-08-07,1,This place has AWFUL service with an extremely rude manager.  I ordered pizza for delivery and specifically wrote I had a food allergy, so no mozzarella and do not slice it (rather than asking them to clean a utensil and cut it).  They delivered it, and it was sliced.  I then called to ask if they used a clean utensil, they said "no I'm making too big a deal, it didn't touch anything it shouldn't and how can I expect them to not cut a pizza- the order is way too difficult."  Against my better judgment, I agreed to let them remake it.  They came back an hour later, and it had mozzarella on it.  This time I called again to get my money back and the manager was yelling at me again saying I'm making way too big a deal, "LADY WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO," etc.  Mind you, I was being very nice about it and at that point I just asked for a refund.  As a paying customer, you should be treated with respect.  I've never had a restaurant manager yell at me when THEY mess up an order twice.  So disappointed.
2017-07-31,1,Ordered via grub hub to pay cash at delivery.  Driver tells me the order is already paid for after i try handing him money,  I assume it must have been paid via credit card through the app.  Later that night text messages and phone calls wake me up from the employees of napolis telling me how the delivery driver is going to be fired if i dont pay.  Next time i order the tough guy owner accuses me of not paying my tab.  Whoever is running this place is a terrible operator.
2017-07-28,1,Waited 2 hours for a large pie and a chicken parm sub to be delivered to my apartment that's only 3 blocks away. Pizza was half burned/black and ice cold. Sub was soggy and cold. Spent $31 on garbage. Never ordering from here again!
2017-07-11,5,Tonight's dinner was by far a favorite.  I had the shrimp Parmesan simply delicious.  The service and food will have me coming back for sure as a regular customer.   The atmosphere is suburb.   Eating inside or outside how great is that to have both options I love it.
2017-07-11,4,Everything okay here , seems a bit understaffed when it gets busy and waiters can't handle
2017-07-06,4,Good place to get delivery from. I ordered a Chicken Parm pizza. Food arrived quickly and was good. Not the biggest fan of their chicken parm pizza but would definitely order from them again.
2017-07-03,5,Awesome BYO; great outside seating with great people watching ability. Great pizza. We also order delivery from here frequently and it is always consistently good. Will be back in person soon.
2017-06-29,1,We have ordered on and off from Napoli's for a few years and at best, it is hit or miss. We have tried pasta dishes - meh - and pizza. We got a pizza last week that was AWFUL. Tasted like cardboard with tomato sauce and mozzarella. We tried one slice and threw it in the garbage. Won't be ordering from here again.
2017-06-16,1,The meat lover pizza delivery I got has all the toppings stacked at the corner of the box and messed up and it is also cold.
2017-06-10,5,Before and after.  Very tasty Sicilian pizza!  Loved the sauce. Definitely worth the drive.
2017-06-06,4,I get food from here probably at least once a week. A solid, good, NY style pizza is what you get here. Thin and crispy, just the way I like it. Outdoor seating and fast delivery is a plus. Their lunch specials are also a good deal. In addition to the pizza, ordering the chicken parm sandwiches are great. They don't mess around with these. Lots of sauce and oozing/melting cheese on the chicken, which is encapsulated by some very crispy bread. Yes. Want.
2017-06-05,5,This is my go-to delivery pizza place. I never think to eat-in there but I recently did and it was great. Caprese salad was delicious the large pizza is big enough for 3 and had leftovers. A couple should be fine with a medium.
2017-05-22,4,I've come here a few times for pizza and it used to be better. Seems like it got greasy BUT their garlic knot sliders are phenomenal. It's a meatball in between the garlic knots with melted mozzarella. It was freshly made and hot! There's 4 per order so it's shareable for sure! It's BYOB which is nice if you wanted to have a casual dinner with some drinks. Outside is decorated with Christmas lights, hard to miss!!
2017-05-17,5,Great place, great pizza, specially the Bacon Chicken Ranch pizza. The Vodka pizza is also awesome.
2017-05-16,3,Food is good but always disappointed when delivered. Every time I order pizza for delivery it is ALWAYS cold. I continue to order hoping that the delivery time would be quicker or that my pizza would be warm but I always end up having to put it in my oven.
2017-05-03,5,The food was awesome. Had gone with my team mates. They liked the food too. Very casual ambience. The waiters were friendly. Service was good. Overall a pleasant experience. Would definitely visit again.
2017-05-03,4,Great pizza especially when everything else is closed. Service is amazing and the staff is very friendly. Even bring very busy they are very patient and responsive. Definitely recommend it to anyone!
2017-04-27,5,Always love their pizza! Recommend ordering for an advanced time because the delivery can take over an hour when they are busy.
2017-04-04,3,Pasta is good, until lately the pizza the pizza also.  Lately the pizza has been dry and too well done...   Their Eggplant Parmesan is TERRIBLE, soggy, thick slices not cooked/ fried properly and left the skin on the eggplant slices. Napoli's wait staff is pleasant and courteous.
2017-04-01,5,Hands down best pizza in Hoboken.  Get the vodka pie, the caio bello, or their pepperoni
2017-03-21,5,We live across the street and order once a week.  Always consistent.  Wouldn't order from anywhere else in Hoboken.  Only complaint and its not about the food or service but the delivery cars double park all the time and its tough to cross the road(jaywalking).  It also usually impeds traffic.  Not sure if anything can be done about that though..
2017-03-18,2,Worst Sicilian pizza ever. Cost almost TWENTY dollars and was inedible. Soggy crust, bad flavor, ugh what a waste of money. Update: they refunded us for the pie which I do appreciate but likely won't order this menu item again
2017-03-14,3,Do not get the pizza with chicken. Rest of them are good. Service needs to be more friendly. But they just reduced our check. So at least they realised it.
2017-03-11,1,I keep trying to give this place a chance bc I live near by but I've never been happy.  They just charged me 3.50 for a plain slice with 3 tiny pieces of sausage on it.  The slices are always burnt on the bottom.  Save your money and go elsewhere.
2017-03-09,3,Ordered delivery but made the mistake of getting entrees instead of pizza. First of all, the order came on time but no bread included. This was our first time trying this restaurant but what Italian restaurant doesn't include bread with entrees?I had chicken parm. Completely underwhelming. The way it was breaded was like a high school home-ec student made it. It was edible but not made in a typical Italian style. Kind of thrown together with cheap store bought breadcrumbs. The pasta was decent. Other than that we may try pizza but won't be ordering entrees again.
2017-03-08,5,Pizza is absolutely delicious. We finally found our favorite pizza place in Hoboken. The Buffalo chicken pizza is out of this world and the customer service is truly top notch. Thank you Frankie!
2017-03-05,4,Just ordered delivery for a couple of pizzas. Great chew on the crust! Sauce has a fresh flavor. Good quality mozz. Recommend the eggplant parm pizza. Margherita is also a winner. Don't recommend if you need it fast, but if you can wait, then this is an excellent choice!
2017-02-25,1,I ordered a large chicken bacon ranch pizza & a cheesesteak w/French fries on seamless; $38 and change when the order was placed.I wouldn't have minded that the food was delivered 97 minutes later, but the pizza was cold and no cheesesteak, no fries.... some shrimp & salad instead. Phones calls and precisely 2 hours after the order was placed I was given a cold cheesesteak with cold soggy fries. I cooked the fries and the pizza in my oven.Automatic F
2017-02-14,1,Do not order delivery! So disappointing when you place an order at 7pm and do not receive it until 8:50pm.  We called 3 times and each time were told it was already out for delivery-40 minutes later it appeared.  Not worth it and they weren't even a little apologetic.  To top it off the food was luke warm at best when it arrived.  Not worth the $$$
2017-02-13,4,We ordered from here for the first time yesterday. The pizza was pretty good. I would order from here again!
2017-02-10,1,Waited over 2 hours for my order when I was quoted 45-60 minutes. It arrived cold. When I called to inquire about my order staff was very rude. Would not order from here agin.
2017-02-10,1,the pizza is tasty...but you'll be WAITING FOREVER for it. last two times i've ordered delivery it's come with a 2 HOUR WAIT. no more. too many other pizza places in town.
2017-02-09,1,Do Not order delivery from here. The last 2 times I've waited over 2 hours and both times the pies had to go back. Such a ridiculous place they are running. Don't waste your time
2017-02-01,5,Best vodka pie I ever had. Thin, crispy crust, tasty vodka  sauce and fresh mozzarella. Highly recommend. Hoboken salad is my other go to at this place.It's BYOB as well, which is always a plus.
2017-01-24,5,Love their pizza!! Always arrives fresh and hot!! Delivery times tend to be really long sometimes but it's worth the wait.
2017-01-14,5,This Pizza is the best pizza in Hoboken.  Frank the owner is a terrific guy and  is very accommodating.  I brought my family there (3 kids ages 5,11,14) and we ordered  a couple of Margherita pies.  I thought the crust was nice and crispy and had the proper texture and the source was not acidic.  With kids I am always nervous about the temperature.  The temperature of our pizza was perfect.  The kids were able to eat it without fear of burning their mouth. The service was very timely and accommodating.  They made room for us and even put on the TV so that my 5 year old stayed entertained.  I highly recommend this place, especially for families.
2017-01-12,5,The service was great tonight, they made room for us even though there wasn't when we got here (lot of big parties)Pizza temp was perfect.Had the GF personal pizza, white sauce and sausage. Great flavor on the crust.Server was cool and fast. I will recommend this place to everyone from now on. Shakablam
2016-12-29,5,Save yourself the trouble of big lines and over paying for pizza in Manhattan, spend that money on taking a quick ferry over to Hoboken and check out this slice of heaven!! Half the price that you pay in Manhattan and the servings are HUGE!!! Amazing value and taste just like Mumma cooks at home!
2016-12-01,4,Frankie the owner called us and will be taking care of this mistake.  I appreciate the quick follow up.
2016-11-13,5,One of the best pizza spots in Hoboken. Good quality pizza. Also has bring your own beer policy.
2016-11-11,1,I ordered and received a text that it would be 45-6o minutes. It took 90 minutes for the pizza to arrive, and it was soggy, cold, and the box was wet. When I requested a refund, they gave me $10, less half of the pizza cost, I still have the entire pizza sitting in the fridge and would gladly give it back for a full refund, because it was inedible and disgusting. Will definitely not be ordering from Napoli again.
2016-11-05,3,Received a nice email from the owner following my previous review. Upgraded based on this. The email was courteous and professional so I respect that. As I said, the 90 minute wait was annoying but the pizza really was great. I will have to give it another try at some stage.
2016-11-05,1,Extremely disappointed. We ordered delivery tonight because we were having a date night in. We ordered pasta, wings and garlic knots with marinara. WOW WHAT A MISTAKE ORDERING HERE. We got our "order" an hour later. We received the pasta and garlic knots (without the mariners) and they had included the dipping sauce for the wings (but no wings). To top it off, the wings dipping sauce had exploded all over the inside of the bag and was covering the food.We tried to call them for about 30 minutes, phone was constantly busy. We ended up having to walk there to take the food back... kinda defeats the purpose of ordering delivery. When we were there they offered to remake it, so we had it remade. I didn't think it was good at all... probably won't eat here again. It's a shame since I had heard good things.
2016-10-30,1,I never write reviews... I'm writing this because I order delivery almost every night and tonight my experience with Napoli's was by far the most frustrating delivery experience I've ever had with a restaurant. After an hour and 45 minutes of waiting, multiple order status calls and being told the infamous "your food is on its way"; I was finally told my order was cancelled by the restaurant over an hour and a half earlier. Christina, the woman I dealt with, should really consider another profession. She was rude, sarcastic and condescending (to the point of disbelief). No apologies were made by Christina for failing to notify us that our order was cancelled for over an hour and  a half made numerous contradicting excuses as to why I wasn't notified of the cancellation (none being her or napoli's fault).  She didn't apologize once and didn't offer us anything like a discount on future orders. If Napoli's had owned there mistake and had been nice to me and at the very least respectful I wouldn't be writing this. Christina made it clear to me this place could care less about their customers and could care less about my business. I will never order from them again.
2016-10-16,1,Great food but delivery time is absolutely ridiculous. I ordered it on Seamless when it said only 45-55 minutes only to place my order and ten minutes later they estimated 1 hour and 45-55 minutes later since an hour later than it should be. There is no reason to take 2 hours to make chicken parm and deliver 5 blocks away.
2016-10-09,1,I am a loyal napolis customer but lately whenever we get a pizza it is so dry even when we ask for extra sauce.  I am a big penne vodka pizza fan and this is the worst one yet here --- so disappointed. This pizza used to be good but lately this place has been dropping the ball. Picture looks good but it's very dry.   I save myself for carbs for good food not this.
2016-10-05,5,Best pizza in Hoboken !! Must try the brownie Napoli desert.The Waitress Alysson was Great.
2016-10-03,4,Very solid pizza, some of my favorite in town. Great buffalo slice as well as the usual fixin's - very thin, typical brick oven style so pretty low on the guilt factor in terms of housing a few more slices than you may have originally planned. Fresh out of the oven while sitting in the restaurant is the best way to go here, as the pizza is so thin it can pretty easily be cold by the time the delivery guy gets to you. That's just as well too, though - makes for great cold leftovers right out of the fridge if that's your thing. I've had a solid wrap and some very good pesto pasta here as well, so this place is worth your time and money on all fronts.
2016-09-28,1,My office frequently orders from Napoli's lunch specials.  Several weeks ago, I ordered a wrap that made me sick for nearly a week.  This week we learned that their $5 hero specials have been raised to $8.50.  (Well, most of them.) However we learned this when the driver showed up. The driver said they'd tried to call but no calls came in during the hour between ordering the food and the delivery arriving.  Will not order from them again. Food is only okay but a 70% price increase is unacceptable.
2016-09-23,1,Today I ordered a large pizza with two topics which I didn't get.  Instead the delivery guy gave me a plain huge pizza. I couldn't call after that because the children that I was babysitting were so hungry. Few minutes later the lady call me from the place telling me that the pizza that I got was more expensive than the one that I originally ordered.  What?? So they were expecting me to pay more for the disgusting pizza that I received? ??  To add, when I call to ask for the pizza this people were just hanging around and putting the telephone down.  Terrible experience.  I'm a babysitter and my accent may not be the more undestanble but I and my children deserve respect.
2016-09-05,5,Napoli's makes some of the best pizza in Hoboken, which is no easy feat in a city with endless pizza joints. They are always extremely busy, a testament to their quality food. The chipotle chicken is my favorite slice in the entire world, though it seems to vary depending on who makes it.
2016-09-02,1,Just ordered from napolis. I made a mistake with the order online- I called and they would not change it even though it was not the entree I wanted . Very dishonest and when the food came it was over 1.5 hours - cold and terrible
2016-08-22,5,Best pizza in town. Alison was great! Very attentive, made sure to get our order right, and was always smiling -- we didn't feel rushed at all. Will definitely recommend Napoli's to family and friends.
2016-08-14,1,I usually love Napoli's and order from them all the time. Today though the order took a lot longer (over an hour and a half) and the penne vodka I received had no sauce on it (just plain penne noodles) which is unacceptable. If there is an issue with what is available at the restaurant you should be made aware of it before the delivery arrives. This definitely makes me think twice about ordering from here again.
2016-08-13,4,Incredible, oven fired pizza.  Doesn't get any better than this but I know people like all different kinds of style pizza and crusts.  This thinner crust and perfect doneness is 5 stars for me.  Service was marginal on a day that was not really busy.  Fine line since you don't want to be bothered but refills on drinks and getting a timely turnaround on the check could have been better.   No worries but I'll rate 4 instead of 5 based on service.
2016-08-11,4,Step 1: Order Chicken Bacon Ranch PizzaStep 2: Cry tears of joyI haven't came across a better bacon chicken ranch pizza in my whole 21 years of living. Give it a whirl. This place is always crazy busy so take it to go & watch netflix while you eat it. You might just eat the whole pie.
2016-07-31,1,This review is for delivery service only. I have eaten here and had much better service experiences and quality of food. I had friends visiting from out of town and was embarrassed today when I ordered two pizzas from here, which took almost 1.5 hours to get to me. This is not a big town, it shouldn't take 1.5 hours to deliver such a simple order. I called about an hour after ordering to confirm. No one apologized for the wait, they told me that the food was on its way. The food took another approx 20 minutes to receive, and the pizza was cold, chewy, and needed to be reheated. Do not get delivery from here.
2016-07-30,3,Okay so service wise this place is rough around the edges n I'll tell u why party of 6 for a bday occasion we had to remove our own dirty plates ask many times for a Check spoons n napkins nvr once asked if we want a refill on our drinks N the reason. Is the waitress get a gratuity without u giving one so once ur served they can care less to wait on you The food is good I give it a 4 star I talked to a manager on site she said she was sorry and very wonderful n pleasant to bad the staff aren't as prepared as the manager
2016-07-25,1,It took them two hours to prepare wings and garlic knots for one person! Amazing! Probably next time I will put my order one day before? What u think?
2016-07-20,5,pizza was amazing omg this vodka pie is insane.also their small pie with extra cheese and extra sauce is literally amazing!
2016-07-08,3,Pizzeria in upper Hoboken with outdoor seating. They sell pizza by the slice or whole pies. Opted for a pie since cheaper than getting a few slices. The pizza is pretty good and prices are comparable to the other pizzerias in Hoboken. Forgot my credit card like a fool after paying and they thankfully kept it safe for me until I picked it up!
2016-06-28,1,Today was my second time visiting this place and yet again their customer service sucks! It's sad because their food is actually good, but their one server is REALLY rude. As for the kids menu, it says it comes with a FREE drink and the server would not give it to me because "it's for dine in only, yet NO WHERE on the menu does it say that!!!!! This will be my last time eating here.
2016-06-15,1,Very slow service. We went to this place at 9:30 pm, placed our orders and did not receive the pizza till 10:30pm. When we went to ask about the orders, we came to know they have not even started processing our order. We just walked away. Also they deliver very cold pizza.Very bad experience. Disappointed
2016-06-15,2,consistently bad service across the board - take out, dine in, seamless - they just can't get it right. extremely disappointing, as they are across the street from my apartment
2016-05-25,4,Always wondered what the hoopla was with this place. It is always busy and figured to try. I have tried pizza all over the ny/nj area and this one stacked up well to the top dogs (spumoni) but was not in the elite category. It is in that 2nd tier of pizza and i would go there before going to grimaldis in hoboken. Overall a great dining experience. The byob aspect helped and i will be back. Also tried the goat cheese salad which was very good.
2016-05-24,5,So the regulars here know who I am...  I'm Livvy:) NOW - Let me start by saying - Napolis is my go to pizzeria and not just because I've been working here for years... I should really start "checking in" being that I'm here even on my days off..Our extensive menu isn't limited to pizza but also salads, appetizers, delicious pasta dishes, kids meals, with gluten free and whole wheat options. We are VERY well known for our gourmet brick oven pizza. Some of my favorite dishes are- the Fettuccini Alfredo (which is really the BEST Alfredo sauce I've ever had .. Sorry Aunt Gemma!) & our Chicken Chipotle Pizza. Service and QUALITY are key ingredients to a wonderful dining experience and that is something we don't fall short of. During lunch (11AM-4PM) multiple lunch specials are offered at no more than $7.00. -2 Slices for $5.00-2 Specialty Slices $7.00-Heros served with a side salad (Chicken Parm, Chicken Francese, Sausage&Peppers, Sausage&Brocolli Rabe, Eggplant Parm) $6.00x-Chicken Roll, Broccoli Roll, Spinach Roll $5.00-Pasta with Marinara or White Wine Sauce $6.00x*All Specials are Served with a FREE fountain beverage* & these specials can't be beat! On Wednesday Evenings we have LIVE JAZZ and on the weekends we don't close til' 12 - so whether you're an early bird or late night foodie... We've got you covered :)  If you're hungry-- 1118 WASHINGTON ST. HOBOKEN, NJ 07030is the place to be.. So clock that address in your GPS if need be & get on down before it gets busy. We'll see you soon! & MAJOR KEY ALERT---------------it's BYOB!!!--------------------**Catering is available In-house and for delivery. We also host different types of events from Rehearsal Dinners, birthday parties & kids "PIZZA MAKING" parties!**
2016-05-23,5,If we could give this place 10 stars we definitely would. My boyfriend and I went for the first time on Friday night. We went shortly before closing time expecting some side faces. Luckily, we ended up with the best server ever! Livy was informative, persuasive, patient, friendly and pretty much everything you'd want in a server (coming from a server myself). On top of that, the food was absolutely amazing and even though we were super annoying with what we wanted on our pizza, those in the kitchen were nothing but happy to do it. Thank you Napoli, especially Livy! You will definitely be seeing us again!
2016-05-22,5,This pizza exceeded my expectations! Everything was very sizable and great for groups for a low price. The service was nice. I loved the pizza (Mediterranean chicken). Pasta was also good. 10/10 would come back again if I visit again!
2016-05-20,5,Amazing food!!! Best pizza in north jersey! Livvy is fantastic she has been great so friendly and such a great personality! She is one of the reasons we keep coming back.
2016-05-20,5,I love this place. The pizza is great (so are the salads), but the pizza is tremendous.  I love seeing how busy it gets, it feels like a real neighborhood pizza place.
2016-05-14,5,Wonderful home style pizza and family environment. We stopped by last minute with a very large party (17 people!) and Napolis was very accommodating to find us space in under 15 minutes. The pizza was wonderful and the thin crust was bubbly and flavorful. Our favorites were the Sicilian (thick crust with many types of cheese) and the fresh and crisp veggie. Definitely recommend! Note it's BYOB but they were very accommodating to our case of wine (no corkage).
2016-05-13,5,Amazing brick oven pizza with a friendly accommodating staff. Been coming here for pizza in Hoboken for a couple years now and it's definitely still the place to go for pizza.
2016-05-12,1,If I could do zero I would. I ordered a large clam pizza to go from here. When I brought the pizza home and opened the box I was astounded. It was literally over- cooked dry bread with some clams sprinkled on top, nothing else. The description for the pizza says it has clams, black pepper, oregano, basil, olive oil and Romano cheese baked on. Sounds delicious... but not what I got. I called to see what happened and was told 'sorry we were busy, we forgot'. You forgot to add the toppings?! The only solution I was given was to have some cheese delivered ...What arrived 30 minutes later was less than a tablespoon of something you'd get out of those little shaker containers. For a whole supposedly large pizza. Which is another thing, 6 small slices is a laughable 'large' pizza.Needless to say I will not be eating here again. Complete waste of 22 dollars.
2016-05-02,4,After realizing my go to restaurant was closed a friend and I came to Napolis for our Italian fix. Our server Allison was very attentive and had great recommendations. We started with a Caesar salad and garlic knots(YUM), then shared the penne vodka with chicken and the pesto pasta with chicken. The service was quick and as a BYOB our experience was very enjoyable. The food was good, no complaints on our end. Overall a nice dining experience.
2016-05-01,5,LOVE this place! Best pizza in Hoboken. Always delicious! Wonderful staff that know the regulars by name and their orders. It's packed on the weekends but well worth the wait. BYOB!!!
2016-04-30,2,Food was okay. Bread, which I had ordered was cold. Service was HORRIBLE. It is a seat yourself place, only table I seen open was by the door and it was pretty chilly due to the fact that people kept coming in and out. So I asked one of the waitresses if I could sit at a table in the back which had a bucket with forks and knifes on it for the waiters to put together I'm guessing? She picked up the bucket rolled her eyes, and walked away and had a stink attitude the whole time we were there. We also waited 15 minutes just to be acknowledged & to be asked what we wanted to drink. Was never asked how anything was, needed any refills, nothing. And I might add it was not busy at all & there was a lot of staff just standing around. Had the service been better I may have returned, but unfortunately I won't be.
2016-04-20,3,I heard & read great reviews about this place (outside of Yelp), so I decided to give this pizza joint a try with my boyfriend. Man this place is busting with business - mostly people ordering & picking up! The traffic they get here on a Monday night is wild. I'm glad their business seems to be doing well! It's located on Washington which I'm sure has some what of an impact to locals and probably visitors. I love places that are BYOD :) We brought over a bottle of wine, no corkage fee, provide you glasses and they open it up for you. It was so busy the night we went, and there were only 2 waitresses and one busser. I'm not sure if this is the norm here but they could definitely use staff given how busy they are. We had really great service, granted they were uber busy - I give them credit for all the hustling. I also love a really good margherita pizza and some calamari :) The app was mediocre - it almost tasted like it was over cooked. It's unfortunate because it had a nice crisp, but the squid was just chewy. I'm not sure why they served with it marina sauce AND sweet chili sauce you get at asian/chinese restaurants. I wasn't feeling that. The die breaker is really the pizza here, because obviously we're at a pizza restaurant. I felt that the pie felt short on my list - the dough was cooked too long, it almost tasted a big cardboard-y. There wasn't enough sauce either :/ I am hoping to come back to try another kind of pizza because they do have good reviews.
2016-04-17,2,I love their delivery. That being said my girlfriend and I went to eat at the restaurant and after being seated, we were completely forgotten about. We waited until another waitress came out to check in us, 45 minutes after initially  ordering our food. We asked for our food to go at that point. Disappointed to say the least because the food is always good!
2016-04-10,4,Napoli's was recommended to me by a friend. The food was very good, we had the calzone and the penne vodka. We enjoyed both. The service was slightly slow, but it was more so the kitchen than our waitress. Overall, I would definitely recommend it.
2016-04-10,5,Wanted to try a new Italian restaurant and read nothing but great reviews on this place. Came in for a late lunch/early dinner and was warmly greeted. I was unsure what to order and Livvy answered all my questions and gave a few recommendations. I went with the penne vodka with grilled chicken and a small margherita pizza. It was absolutely delicious I highly suggest it. Livvy was very helpful, attentive and gave exceptional customer service. Be sure you say hello to her if you stop by this gem. Buen provecho.
2016-04-09,4,They have great pizza and slice deals (check out the Yelp promo too). The slice deal is $5 for two.
2016-04-05,5,I'm visiting from the West Coast and ordered delivery through GrubHub.  I got the individual size spinach and artichoke white pizza...So delicious!  It's loaded with the spinach and artichokes, plus the cheese combined with white sauce is excellent, and the crust...why can't they make this crust on the West Coast???  I gobbled half of it down because I was very hungry, but also because it tasted so good.  I'm looking forward to the other half tomorrow for lunch.  I cannot get any pizza like this near me, suburb northwest of LA.
2016-04-05,5,This place is the ONLY place we go for pizza. I LOVE the freshness and varieties of pizza to choose from. My wife and I always order the same thing... spinach salad and a gluten pizza. Best pizza in Hoboken.
2016-04-03,4,This is your good around-the-neighborhood pizza / pasta joint. This also a byob-place with a friendly staff.
2016-03-30,5,One of the best and fair priced pizza joint in Hoboken. Friendly staff and good atmosphere. This is officially my go to pizza place in Hoboken. Cassandra was awesome!
2016-03-20,5,Napoli's is a classic Hoboken spot. They do free delivery if you're getting it delivered to a Hoboken address. On Friday night we ordered a large pie with vodka sauce -- my friend picked it up. It took about 20 minutes and the pizza was fantastic! There was a lot of character to it as well. I've only ever experienced their takeout/delivery. I'd like to come here someday and experience their actual restaurant. Tons of options for vegetarians.
2016-03-04,3,I like their food, but this Review is only for delivery. RIDICULOUSLY SLOW DELIVERY. 2 hours to get a pasta and pizza within the area. I can't understand why seamless says 45 min delivery when it really isn't.
2016-02-29,2,I hate to do this but here we are. I've been ordering from napolis for about 2 years. I was very satisfied for a long time with the quality of the food here. However, over the last 6 months it has been horrendous. I typically order delivery via an app and often times there are small parts of my order missing (ice cream missing, sides of sauce which I paid for). Also, the quality has gone way down. Today I ordered the arancini which used to contain ground beef and peas. Not anymore! To my surprise today it is only rice and peas now. For the same price. This place has become below average which is sad because it has always been popular because of the quality and value of their food. I'll be taking my business elsewhere moving forward.
2016-02-20,1,I have had far too many negative experiences with Napoli's to give them more than 1 star. Back in the summer, my girlfriend and I ate there at an outdoor table for lunch. Before we sat down, we went inside (where it was practically empty) and asked the server nicely if it was ok to sit outside (and of course she said that was fine and she'd be right out). She didn't come out for more than 15 minutes to even bring a menu, and that was just the beginning. After more than an hour of waiting, we got the wrong pizza, to which our server seemed to not really care and just shrugged. By the time we got the correct pizza and ate, we were there for more than an hour and a half, and the manager's explanation was essentially "this isn't how we normally operate" but really took no responsibility for any of the issues. Very comforting. But last night was frankly the last straw for me. I placed an order through Seamless for a small pizza with 1 topping at 7:00, and the estimated delivery time was 7:45 to 7:50. I was fine waiting, but at 8:00 I started to wonder. So I checked the status of my order, and now it said estimated delivery time 8:15 to 8:25. Ok, well I get that it's a Friday night. But then at 8:30, I still had no pizza and no sign of when I would have it. I called the restaurant (it took me nearly 15 tries because the phone line was busy over and over), and someone finally explained that the restaurant was very backed up and they were thinking about not taking any more delivery orders. But you know what? This is not a new restaurant; they know exactly what a Friday night is like in Hoboken, and the fact that they can't anticipate that shows me they just don't care that much or they can't figure out how to make enough pizzas. Either way, get your act together. My pizza ended up coming at 8:50 (an hour and 50 minutes for a small pizza that only had to travel 6 blocks). And despite my call to the restaurant, no one even offered to refund so much as the delivery fee. You may be wondering: how was the pizza after all that time? It was fine. Not the best and not the worst. Certainly not worth an hour and 50 minute wait. I'm done with Napoli's.
2016-02-15,1,Ordered three salads. Took two hours to be delivered. In what world does it take two hours to make salads and deliver less than a mile away? Very rude customer service when we called to question the status of food (multiple times). Wish I could say this was a one-time exception to their typical service, but it has become the norm from Napoli's. Definitely NEVER ordering from them again!!!! Avoid at all costs.
2016-02-15,3,I was craving garlic knots one night, and came across Nappoli's. The pepperoni pizza and garlic knots were both pretty good, but not great. Good delivery pizza option in Hoboken with reasonable prices
2016-02-08,1,I've ordered here dozens of times, and finally for the last time. I'm fed up.  They're always over their 1 hour delivery time despite having a narrow delivery area in a mile tall city.  I've had to call on a number of occasions to see where my order is, and am usually given a story about it just having left with the delivery person, if they answer the phone at all.  The wrong thing gets delivered, or the food is cold by the time it gets there 1hr30min to 2 hours later. And it's not like the prices are low to compensate for the bad service.  It's actually one of the most expensive places to get a pizza in Hoboken. Lastly, their service is just terrible.  They don't seem to care if the inconvenience customers.  They don't apologize when they get stuff wrong, and they get in your face if you ask any pointed questions about how they can continue to do business so poorly.  There's a pizza place about every block from 12th street to 1st Street in Hoboken. Try any of those instead of Napoli's.
2016-02-07,3,We've gotten food from here a bunch of times and always liked the place, but the last 2 visits have left us really disappointed. They've messed up both orders, sent the wrong food (and it was cold) when we ordered for pick up and when we called to correct it, they couldn't seem to find our our order at all. Eventually they did offer to bring the correct order, which was much appreciated, but the service level and quality of the food just seems to have dropped off in the most recent months. We're giving it a break before we come back here again.
2016-01-29,4,Napolis is one of the most delicious pizza I have had. We have come back several times just to eat the pizza and have enjoyed it everytime.  Their gluten free pizza crust is not made in house. With that said, I still order it everytime. It would be helpful if they could sell the gluten free pizza in smaller portions (ie, by the slice) because it doesn't taste as good warmed up the next day. The customer service here is incredible. I don't remember all of our waiters and waitresses but this last time we had Cassandra and she was great! The one thing that I was extremely disappointed about was we had ordered eggplant parmesan with vodka sauce to go. The next day when my brother ate it he said the eggplant was undercooked and it didn't taste like vodka sauce. I don't think I'll be ordering eggplant again.
2016-01-28,5,I've lived in Hoboken my entire life, not only have I seen many pizza places come and go, but I've also been to every pizza place that has been around for the past 20 years. Most Hoboken natives would direct people towards Benny's, but Napoli's has been my go-to place ever since they opened and had only one table. As someone who's worked in the restaurant business, I have this to say to the people complaining about delivery time: you have to understand that, in most cases, restaurants hire delivery services to take out orders and don't do the delivering themselves, so don't give Napoli's your poor reviews. If that's not the case for Napoli's and they do have their own delivery staff, then I guess it would be understandable. Either way I live around the corner so I never have to deal with wait times.
2016-01-24,1,Disgusting, cold, muggy food, pizza hard as a rock and cold, calamari were hard, 0 stars and it and takes 2 hours for delivery. YIKES!
2016-01-22,3,I ordered here on seamless a few days ago for delivery. It seemed like the small Vodka Pie was a popular choice so I ordered that with some buffalo wings as well. The food was on time, but I was called by a seamless rep shortly after I placed my order to let me know that Napoli was now going to charge me an additional delivery fee on top of why I already paid as a part of some new policy they implemented. I was a bit irritated but I gently let it ride hoping the food would be worth the extra cost. Unfortunately the notorious Vodka Pie was extremely disappointing. The cheese and sauce was all burnt on top and the pizza was way too rough and chewy. Didn't seem like a brick oven pizza at all. The saving grace to my meal were the wings which were cooked very well and tasted great! As a native from Naples who is also in the pizza business, I was sad to have this kind of experience with them. It seems that they do have other popular menu items that look really good. Perhaps I'll stop in one day and give it another shot.
2016-01-16,1,While I do like their food, I have ordered from them three times.  First two times my order arrived cold, and had to place it in the oven for 15 mins to heat it up.  My third time was my last straw.  I placed an order and was missing parts of my order while everything else arrived cold..as usual.  There food is good but that does not out weight the food delivery.  Horrible service.
2016-01-13,5,Best pizza in Hoboken!! Fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly. By far best I have had in Hoboken!
2016-01-12,5,Awesome pizza place. Always great service and good food. It's a perfect BYOB and is always busy, for a good reason!
2016-01-09,5,Big Napoli's fan!  Whether it's ordering delivery or heading in for a nice dinner in the small, friendly restaurant, they never disappoint!  Delivery/Takeout can take a VERY long time if they are busy, but it'll be well worth it!  Try the vodka pie if you have a chance!
2016-01-01,4,Brick oven slices on the go never disappointed.  I recommend the chicken parm slices and vodka insane.  Meatballs are also phenomenal here I've had calzones (usually do meatball and onion) and meatball parm both are crowd pleasers for sure.
2015-12-31,1,I ordered their pizza online at 7:00 pm. Right now is 9 pm. I called them and they said it needs to be another 20 minutes. In this planet, which restaurant needs two hours to cook a pizza?
2015-12-27,5,I haven't visited the restaurant yet but I had their delivery, and let me tell ya -  the brick oven pizza is phenomenal!  I am so happy they deliver to Jersey City heights!
2015-12-21,3,Napolis has great pizza and staff is usually friendly but an experience tonight left a bad taste in my mouth. I ordered for pickup on Seamless: a salad and spaghetti with parm cheese on the side. Simple enough. After picking up said order, I get home and realize that they forgot the toppings and dressing for the salad, leaving a bowl of (brown, wilted) spinach. So I call and they tell me they'll have the delivery guy bring a new salad in 15 mins. After an hour and another frustrated call to Napolis, the delivery guy finally shows up. Takes the bad salad back even though the girl on the phone told me that I could keep it "for the inconvenience." Fine because I didn't want rotten lettuce anyway. Another hour later, I get an email from Seamless letting me know that Napolis adjusted my order. I think "aw how nice, they probably gave me some kind of credit for the hassle."...Nope. Added an upcharge of 54 cents to my original order for the parm cheese on the spaghetti.
2015-12-20,3,Ordered here because of a friend's recommendation. We did a half buffalo chicken and a half ciao bello pizza. We also ordered a Hoboken salad and garlic knots because we were told they are not to  be missed. The wait time for delivery was an hour and it took less than that which was promising. The pizza was delicious. Really good crust and loaded with toppings. The salad was a nice addition as well-big enough to split between two people. Our garlic knots were nowhere to be found. I called at 8:21 and was told that driver was on his way back. I called back at 8:53 and no one had any idea what I was talking about and the driver was MIA. Was given a $3 credit towards my next order but I'm not sure I will be ordering again.
2015-12-20,4,Came here the other night for a make your own pizza and salad! We got the arugula salad which was pretty good, a little heavy on the dressing. For our main course we got a pizza which we created ourselves. Warning: the small is huge! Between the two of us we couldn't finish it.the table next to us got two large pies for 3 people which looked pretty ridiculous haha. The pizza is great here. Next time I come back I want to try one of their white pizzas which looked amazing. The restaurant is small and seating is limited so you may have to wait a little. It was packed when we went and we only had to wait around 20 minutes. Service was a little slow but overall good. Also note they are BYOB!
2015-12-12,4,Some of the best pizza in Hoboken!  Highly recommend the whole wheat margarita pizza.  Great selection of artisan style pizzas.  Delivery service is good as well.  If it looks crowded and you are contemplating going to the brick oven competitor next door don't as you'll be very disappointed.  This place is worth any wait!  Enjoy!
2015-12-11,1,I love waiting 2 hours for pizza, not! Not to mention we called to ask where the pizza was and they said on the way, but yet 40 minutes later we are still starved. I would understand MAYBE if there's was a traffic incident. But no understanding here pal, hoboken is a mile by a mile. I could crawl there faster.
2015-12-07,5,This place is awsome! I was craving pizza and I decided to check this place out.  I got the vodka pizza and the meatball sliders, both were amazing! I have tried other pizza places in Hoboken but this has to be my favorite so far. I had it for take out, and despite other yelp reviews, my food was delivered in less than an hour.  I will definitely order again!
2015-12-03,4,One of the best take out/delivery pizza spots in Hoboken. I have never been upset with my food here! However I had to give it 4 stars because lately their delivery has taken forever!! I really hope they can get back on a quicker delivery time so I don't have to order elsewhere!
2015-12-02,5,Italian food never gets old, but sometimes the pizzerias in my neighborhood do. Because of that, it's worth heading to Napoli's every now and again. Although the name makes it seem more like a pizza joint, Napoli's has got an extensive menu with lots of different pasta, entree and app options. The dining area is pretty small, but it's usually not hard to snag a table since a large portion of their business is take-out. The food here is absolutely incredible. Portions are large, so I'd suggest sharing. The personal sized pizza is more like a medium, the medium sized is more like a large, and the large...well, I haven't gotten that far yet. After seeing pics on Yelp, I was 100% positive that I'd order the garlic knot sliders during my next visit, and last week I did exactly that. The order came with four plump garlic knots, sliced in half with a large meatball, gooey mozzarella and fresh tomato sauce in between. Mic drop. Because the order of four was pretty large, that and a personal sized vodka pie split between two was the perfect amount of food. All of that for under 20 bucks with BYOB wine is absolutely a deal considering that most spots in the area will run you over 20 dollars for an entree alone. And everything here is way more fresh and delicious than most places that you'll find in Hoboken. I wish that Napolis was in Jersey City, but hey, it's still worth the trip over!
2015-11-29,2,Terrible salad but the pie was good. When I order a salad (arugula) I don't expect just a hand full of arugula for $8. I would have went to shoprite and purchased 4 bags. Don't forget the other ingredients!!! Disappointing side to a good pie.PS: The half of a mushroom that was on the salad was not washed. Yuck.
2015-11-19,5,I never had pizza as delicious as I had tonight. It brought me back to my childhood in Brooklyn and I haven't tasted anything as delicious as this since. My son moved to the area recently and we will be regulars. I thank Livvy for the amazing service and telling us about the Vodka pizza. Do yourself a favor and try Napoli's!!
2015-11-14,4,Definitely the best pizza in Hoboken. The first time I came here, I was in a rush so I ordered two slices to go. The buffalo chicken slice looked very good, so I ordered one of those and the grandma's slice, of which was on the thicker side. The buffalo chicken slice stood out, not only in appearance but also in taste. Amazing! The second time I came here my girlfriend and I ordered a small margharita pizza and some garlic knots. The garlic knots were some of the best I have ever had! The margharita pizza is conjured up with san marzano tomatoes, fresh mozz, basil, and romano cheese. The tomato sauce in particular had a rustic and authentic taste to it -- definitely freshly made. Service was great both times I came in here and when I ordered my two slices to go, I received a free fountain drink as part of the lunch special. Napolis is now my new "go-to" for pizza in Hoboken.
2015-11-13,2,By the time our food was delivered, 35 min late, I had to already go to plan B for dinner. I am sure their pizza would have been good hot but we didn't get to try it out. Next time I won't be ordering in from them rather visiting their restaurant.
2015-11-10,4,Service is great, the waitresses are nice and knowledgable of the menu. They recently added a bunch of new items which really punches up the selection. Will def be back. And BYOB. Always a pleasant dinner experience. Wanna try the vodka pizza plain next time, the chicken we got on it dried it out I think. The meatball sliders were awesome, so was the caprese, nice big slabs of mozz. The specialty pizzas got a little heavy but still good. Large size is def the way to go, best deal.
2015-11-06,1,Terrible delivery.The driver did not get out of the car, called my cell which I didn't hear, didn't leave a voicemail. When we called to inquire about our food they claimed he couldn't get in touch with us, he then came back with the cold food a half hour later. He then called again from outside to say he was on the corner, couldn't find parking!  He didn't initially get out of the car either time.  Somewhat luckily I heard my phone the second time.  At least after a hour and 15 minutes I go to eat cold food.
2015-11-02,4,While service is often slow the food itself is often really good.  Get the Buffalo chicken pizza or the eggplant parm lunch special.  Friday nights are really crowded but they are willing to move some tables together to fit a large group as needed.  Always seems open late, which is a good thing.  I have gotten the same waitress on different visits and she is always really sweet and is also alright with splitting bills so it is easier for a large party to pay, although it is definitely more difficult.  Way to go, best place to go if you have duckbills, although try to keep large groups to weekday nights so you dont stress the waitstaff as much.
2015-11-02,5,I ordered delivery yesterday afternoon I know it was Sunday football and all places where backed up on delivery I must say Madeline gave me great customer service and made sure I was a satisfy customer. Along with the great food definitely will order again thanks napolis for making my tummy happy! The buffalo wings were amazing!
2015-10-31,1,Its sad that the owner frank is soo unprofessional in front of the customer Frank the owner  he made us feel uncomfortable there yelling and screaming no wonder he is almost bold  with no hair  the food was very cold we had to wait 2 hours for this pizza not worth it go to the brick better they treat you better frank needs to go get some professionalism edicate I will never come there to eat again or suggest it to anyone to eat there Frank the owner yells to everyone curses at the police and treat the cooks like shit he needs to grow up and learn there is place and time to speak the way he does to his employees and they don't make the mozzarella there it is brought right next door so if you really want good mozzarella go to biancamanos trust me they make it and sell it go to them don't be fooled
2015-10-23,4,It was crazy busy butCassandra was wonderful!!!White pie could have used a littttleMore ricotta but food was delicious as always!
2015-10-22,4,This was the first place I chose to eat at when I moved to Hoboken. Their gluten free pizza is fantastic. Eating here makes me feel like my dietary restrictions aren't a problem, and that I can still enjoy one of my favorite foods just a couple blocks away. The pasta isn't that great but the pizza is delish. I've had the Margherita (a classic!) and their clam pies. Both are fantastic.
2015-10-18,1,I am sad to report that I had the worst experience ordering at Napoli's twice. I'm a loyal customer who frequents the shop on numerous occasions. Last week I placed and order and when it was delivered, I noticed that an item was missing. I immediately called back and they stated they were have the item delivered and apologized for the inconvenience. I was happy that they were so caring, however it took the driver over 45 minutes to deliver the item and by that point, everyone else who's food had arrived already ate. The most appalling incident happened yesterday when I placed and order for deliver. I called first and spoke to Christina who confirmed that they were able to make a sausage parmigiana sandwich. I thought it would be simple since I also ordered an eggplant parmigiana hero. She confirmed and I placed the order online. Once it was delivered, I opened the bag and saw that the sandwich had melted American cheese only. Not sure how this was lost in translation since it was clear in the notes section of the order. I called and Christina told me to text a picture to "ensure" the sandwich was incorrect. I was taken aback because in all my experience, I was NEVER told to prove the order was wrong. She said she would resend the item and after an hour wait and a follow up call, they redelivered the wrong item and this time is still had AMERICAN CHEESE and Marinara sauce. Of course I called back and refused to have them make a 3rd time. Christina took no accountability and told me the next time I place an order I should call. When I asked to speak to a manager, she said the manager was not available and said she would credit me for the item and to follow up in a day or two if it doesn't show up. The lack of accountability and the poor customer service will prohibit me from ever going there again!!!!! So, if you want to eat here, do NOT have them deliver!
2015-10-01,5,Excellent pizza! I'm from Chicago but enjoy New York style pizza. This is one of the best I've ever had. I travel to NY/NJ area often and look forward to eating here again. The service was also top notch.
2015-09-30,4,Really liked the food a lot.Ordered delivery after a night out, so it was late - after midnight. We had a margherita pizza (the medium sized one) two orders of garlic knots and a kid's pasta. The whole thing came to about $30 which I thought was kind of crazy because it wasn't even a full sized pizza, but like I said it was late and we were hungry. Delivery took over and hour which also was kind of crazy but I guess to be expected in such a busy area. Anyway, the food was awesome. Pizza was soooooo good and garlic knots were some of the best I've ever had. They were soft and doughy and so so so so good. Would definitely eat food from here again.
2015-09-30,3,I wanted to love this place. I really did. I was reading reviews for the gluten free pizza and I couldn't have been more excited to try it. It was honestly one of the worst gluten free pizzas I've ever had. Delivery service was exceptional (especially on a Friday night), I will give them that. My friends enjoyed their Margherita pizza & eggplant rollatini, but I would probably never order a GF pizza here again. Bummed. Still on the hunt for the best GF pizza in Hoboken.
2015-09-27,3,They messed up my order for delivery. I asked for a large margherita and a personal white but they brought me two personals. I didn't feel like waiting so we just ate what we had. Everything tasted fine, but I'm not sure I will be ordering delivery anytime soon.
2015-09-13,2,The most average food you can ask for. The only reason it's 2 stars instead of 3 is how much they charge for the portions they give. I prob won't order from here again, however wouldn't be against eating their food if I found an amazing deal (more than just 25% off).
2015-08-27,5,AMAZING pizza.  Had this 5+ times now and it's great every time.  The Margerita with peppers, olives, onions, pepperoni is our fav.  And if you love garlic you have to order the garlic knots..to die for!
2015-08-23,3,Not bad! But not the best. I just tried their GF pizza (Classic style with pep and pineapple) the cheese and sauce were delicious! But the crust, which i know is a difficult thing to master, wasn't my favorite. Edges were overcooked (which was probably the part I liked most) the middle was that strange dense but not... texture. I am new to having to eat GF so I am no pro, I wouldn't say I wouldn't order from here again, but I might try other places first. Great pricing compared to other places!
2015-08-15,3,The pizza is always great...however tonight the service sucked... The waiter was very neglectful....didn't ask how the food was and let us get through our whole meal without refilling our drinks...I was choking on pizza dough....don't get the mussels half of them were empty...or weren't open....and the table bread tastes like it was from 3 days ago...next time we'll take it to GO!!!!
2015-08-10,5,We love their pizza's here. I haven't tried much else here, maybe a salad here and there. Anytime we want good pizza we go to Napoli's. Its pretty consistent and the pizzas are always good.
2015-08-07,5,Best pizza in Hoboken, without a doubt.  My favorite is the vodka pizza- you have to try it, it's so incredibly.  I usually get it with extra cheese.
2015-08-05,5,Best Pizza I've ever had.Get the Vodka PizzaAnd its BYOB
2015-07-26,4,Really nice experience here and on a groupon deal as well. Came in relatively early on a Friday and had no issues getting a table with room for a stroller inside, since it was super hot out. The waiter sees we have out little guy, and says he has something for him and says he'll be right back. Guy comes back a minute later with a Napoli's onesie for the little dude!Anyways, probably should talk about the food. Caprese salad - nice fresh mozzarella with big tomato slice. Bruschetta - toasty, yet soft bread, just completely smothered in the chopped tomato salad, as it should be. Half sausage and ricotta pizza - the pizza here really is nicely done. Chewy crust, and the ricotta adds a nice creamy and smooth element to the pie. Half clam pizza -  this one was a touch more oceany than I might have liked, but it's a clam pizza so I really can't fault it for being oceany. Strangely enough, taking it home and letting it sit for the day took some of that edge off and I liked it better cold. The food here is on point, though I wouldn't get the clam pizza again, and I will be back again soon.
2015-07-18,5,The margarita piazza was a 9 out of 10, clam piazza was to dry for me and not a fan of the buffalo slice but the chicken parm, garlic knots and the eggplant rollatini are all great the eggplant was the best though
2015-07-11,4,I've been living in Hoboken for a couple of years now and from a full-blooded Italian's point of view, there are not a whole lot of great pizza places in the area. So far, my favorites are Basile's and Napoli's. Napoli's takes my number one spot with an excellent rendition of a brick oven pie. For the price, along with the generous 20% coupon for Yelp users, makes it more than reasonable. I've only had the pizza and garlic knots there so I can't comment on the rest of the menu but the pizza has my vote! Good crust, not too oily, perfect mix of cheese and sauce. The staff is pretty awesome too and they recognize the regulars and treat them like family. Go Naps!
2015-07-11,2,No zest in the pepperoni pizza. Skimpy on the sauce. Dough was gummy. Cheese was light and without taste. Meatball Parmesan sandwich was dry. Hardly any sauce. I will not return.
2015-07-04,4,Ordered a classic pie with pepperoni and onions (an homage to the terrific Joe Torre pie from my beloved-but-gone Filippo's on First) for delivery. The crust was thin and flavorful, and the toppings were ample but not overwhelming (i.e. the pie wasn't overly cheesy or greasy - a plus). Their large pie is larger than most, and there was a little bit of sogginess at the tip that I didn't fault (it was delivery). We also got a side of sautéed broccoli and even though it was frozen broccoli, they worked some kind of magic so that it got a little browned in the pan and had deep garlic flavor.I was impressed by the super-fast delivery (it was a holiday weekend), and the pie was tasty. I'll be adding Napoli's to my delivery roster.
2015-06-27,4,Delivery review: It was a rainy Saturday night, so many were taking out and ordering for delivery, it was a 45 min wait. They were true to their word as our delivery came 45 min on the nose. Ordered the chicken francese hero, small magherita pie and garlic knots for 3. All were amazing and we were stuffed. The franchese hero has a great taste and excellent lemon sauce. It can get very messy though so have your napkins handy. Garlic knots and pizza were great tasting as well but I recommend the franchese hero. Great deal for $10 and will fill you up.
2015-06-21,4,I've been to a few pizza places in Hoboken and they're all pretty good, though in my opinion this may be your best bet if you just want a basic slice such as cheese or pepperoni.
2015-06-11,1,Take out containers are smaller than 2 weeks ago yet they claim they are the same size. Some dishes are OK others are horrible,They don't get orders right and when ever they are delivered there is always what smells like rancid oil all over everything. Back to Margherita's at 8th and Wash I go.
2015-06-11,4,I'd be remiss if I didn't update my review, because I eat here now about 3-4 times a week. Now that I live 3 blocks away I don't order delivery so I no longer have those issues.For what you get and for the price you can't beat Napolis. All of the employees are incredibly friendly and helpful, from the pizza maker to the waitress. They are always smiling and really friendly. I don't know how they do it sometimes, especially at lunch time. But we love going here for dinner too, it is good and you can walk away from dinner for $30. BYOB is obviously a huge plus. I absolutely love the fettuccine pasta  in a cajun cream sauce. It takes a lot of self control not to eat the whole thing. Their lunch specials can't be beat, for $6.42 you can get a chicken parm hoagie, side salad and a drink (you can get other hoagies for the same deal). They also have great pizza deals at lunch. While I am still not a fan of their buffalo slice, I am absolutely in love with their chipotle chicken slice. That one is a winner! At lunch it is insane. The stroller mafia rolls in to this tiny space and takes it over. I never eat in the dining room at lunch, always to go. I can't take the kids screaming and yelling with no parental control and strollers literally everywhere like a stroller parking lot. The space is really tiny inside so there's never really anywhere to stand where you aren't in the poor waiters way or getting your toes run over. So grab you food and walk up to the water and eat, that's my suggestion.
2015-06-05,4,Just a solid place for a go to nice outdoor byob wish yelp allowed 1/2 ratings I would rate a 3.5
2015-06-02,5,Amazing pizza, even warmed up an hour later kind of amazing! The top of the crust might look burned and unappealing, but do not be fooled-the flavors are on point, and this is the kind of pizza to get-if you want a genuine NY/NJ style slice
2015-06-02,5,Pizza review only; this is the best slice/pie for your dollar in Hoboken. Each pizza is the perfect depth (not too thin;not too thick) and balances itself out with the most savory level of crispiness. It even maintains this crisp during delivery (and I live across town). When I dine inside, two slices come with a free fountain drink. Amazing. The speciality slices are always looking great; you can tell they are fresh and haven't been sitting in an refrigerator over the weekend. Staff is very nice and authentic.
2015-05-27,4,I've only had Napoli's via delivery when having a night in with friends. I would like to dine there when I get the chance and check the place out. The pizza is always good and arrives in a timely matter.Nothing over-the-top amazing, but just good quality pizza in Hoboken. Short and sweet.
2015-05-26,4,Hands down the best white pizza I ever had. I get it with extra basil & sausage but the melted globs of mutz are so fresh it melts in your mouth! Not a huge fan of their tomato pies but the white pizza is out of this world. I often got it delivered - it was actually the first pizza I had after moving to Hoboken. It holds up well in delivery. It's BYOB which is great & a few outdoor tables to sit when it's warm.
2015-05-20,4,Tried this place on my first trip to Hoboken, was very delighted. The pizza is delicious! You can get it by the slice or whole pie. I will definitely be coming back.
2015-05-12,5,Steve is the best. Great food fast service the way it should be. Place makes the best sandwiches cold or hot. Nothing like it anywhere on the east coast. I drive to Florida and California every other month and have yet to find a better place. The family night special is great you get enough food for 6 and maybe a little for a late night snack. Found this place about 7 years ago and it is now a first choice for a meal. You have to try it for yourself.
2015-05-04,5,Stopped in on Friday afternoon for some pizza. We ordered a large margherita with prosciutto. It didn't take very long for our pizza to come out of the oven and it was delicious. The sauce was tasty - the basil was fresh - the cheese was perfect. Great little spot!
2015-05-04,3,Came here on a Friday night with a groupon.  The pizza was delicious.  We ordered the vodka pie and the white pie, both were amazing.  We also ordered some apps.  The bruschetta was just OK, bread wasn't really crisp and kind of on the soggy side. The baked clams were sorry to say, just plain awful.  They were huge clams just covered in melted mozzarella and garlic. Wouldn't order apps again but definitely pizza!
2015-05-02,1,Ordered 3 pizzas and received 2, only 1 correct 1.  Received 1 more 2 hours later, still missing the other.  Will never order from there again.  Still waiting for 3rd pizza.
2015-04-28,5,Literally just left this place- My boyfriend and I were having a stroll around uptown Hoboken, just looking at menus and what not. (It's Valentines Day, duh!) I was craving a hearty burger, but as we glanced at Napoli's menu, they didn't offer it in their menu UNTIL a super-friendly waiter asked us to come in, and told us that the kitchen would totally cook up a good ol'e burger for me, hooray! As soon as we sat we were greeted by the staff, and we had this adorable waitress attend us. It was not to busy either, just perfect! My burger was divine, completely not what I was expecting from a pizza spot, ugh, so good, I couldn't even finish it! My boyfriend had chicken fingers and fries, he was so happy. We didn't have anything extravagant, but the food was great, and the price was unbeatable! The free soda refills were the bomb-diggity too. At the end of my check, the waitress gave me a rose, I fell in love. Would totally come back again!Thanks Napoli's, you have satisfied my V-day, and my tummy.
2015-04-25,5,This place is clearly a happening spot for families and groups. Though they wouldn't take a reservation for our group of 6 and thus we had to wait half an hour for a table which felt like a long time for a pizza place, it was definitely worth the wait. The pizza was delish, we were able to have our lovely book club discussion without feeling like we were the loud ones at the place, and our server Brian was super attentive and friendly. As we say for great quotes in the books we read, *snap, snap* Napolis! You were fab!
2015-04-25,3,The pizzas are great undoubtedly, but the service is definitely that needs improvement.
2015-04-24,1,Had some friends over and read the great reviews. Ordered two large pies with different toppings. I was told it would be to my home within the hour. Looking at the clock it was 8:30.Called back at 9:30 and was told delivery backed up to an hour and a half and pies would be there soon 10pm friends hungry and want to leave. I call to cancel my order and I'm told your the next stop. ALMOST 2 HOURS LATER??NO THANK YOU.
2015-04-24,5,Napoli's is a great place to eat for a casual meal. We visited from upstate NY with our daughter and her family from Jersey and our son from Hoboken. The pizzas are very large. Two fed our family of 5 adults and 2 children. We love the pizza Margarita with kalamata olives and onion. Choose your toppings or stick with the traditional Margarita; with the fresh basil it's delicious.  And we ended the meal with an Italian ice treat. It's a great place to bring your family but also good for couples to enjoy a date. Our waitress Livie was great and even cut up the pizza for the kids.
2015-04-19,2,The first time I ordered the Vodka pie from Napoli I was hooked. However, the last three times I have ordered it was delivered to me luke warm, dry and overcooked. I think it's finally time I give up the memory of that first pie and move on to the other great pizza options in Hoboken.
2015-04-16,5,Dough, sauce, cheese and toppings= PIZZA!! Something we all love to enjoy, yet so simple to make but hard to nail. This my friends is on my top 3 favorite pizza joints in New Jersey. It's perfectly thin, right amount of sauce and cheese. Toppings are incredibly fresh, pepperoni is small, nice and crispy, arugula is crisp yet delicate, and jalapenos is a monster in your mouth, holy moly will it burn your mouth. Definitely the spiciest jalapeno I have ever ate and I can handle spice. Regardless of the topping, you will truly enjoy this pizza spot. They are reasonably priced plus offer deals on Groupon and 20% off on Yelp check ins. For a small 14" pie with one topping costs $15.50, heck that's a bargain right there enough for two people. Service is very good and attentive, they care about pleasing their customers. They are very busy especially on the weekends, to the point where they have 7- 8 delivery personnel's delivering pies, which is insane considering there are so many other pizzerias in Hoboken. So that right there tells you they are doing something right. Next time you're craving pizza, make sure to check this spot out because it's truly worth it!!
2015-04-09,5,5 stars for the vodka pizza and rice balls! Add some pepperoni to the vodka pizza it will not disappoint! The wings are delicious also. If you are ordering out - recommend picking up vs delivery. Their deliveries can take awhile so the pizza has cooled down by the time it arrives. You might need to throw it in the oven before eating.Overall -  Love this place!
2015-03-31,1,Extremely annoyed with this place. I love the pizza but every time I go in my particular pizza is gone. The guy tells me it's very popular so if it freaking popular why can't you make more why do I have to always pay for a personal pie. When it's a big hit! Between that an finding a screw in my pasta I've had my fair share from this place. God forbid you call for delivery you won't get your food for well over an hour. Not to mention when it does come chances are that its not what your order or its undercooked. The main reason I decided only to eat pizza from there seeing as they are unable to do anything else right! An can someone explain why the Cesar dressing taste like Tuna fish!!! When ever I ask to speak with the owner he always wants to argue. They will not get another dime from me! They don't deserve a not one star but I can't post this without a star.
2015-03-30,5,The food is amazing! I refuse to eat Pizza that is not made by an Italian and Napoli's is  fantastic! This evening I started with the Arugula Salad; the balsamic dressing is one of a kind. The Vodka Sauce Pizza, words can't express how great it was! Italian Pizza at its perfection. I was upset to not take advantage of the BYOB (now I know for next time!). The service was phenomenal as I enjoy asking for recommendations and Livy was great! I love food so much, I  never know what to pick! So many options, I go off of recommendations.  Great service!Great food!Great environment!Great vibes =)
2015-03-30,5,My boyfriend and I came to Napoli's because we were craving pizza. We were seated fairly quickly and the staff was friendly and attentive. The food was great! We had the Ciao Belle pizza along with some wings. No complaints here. The restaurant also honors the Yelp 20% discount for checking in, so 5 stars for you Napoli!
2015-03-29,5,Great pizza! We like both the classic and margarita (fresh mozz).  Wraps are good too.  The eggplant rolatini app - What a surprise.  It's awesome.  Everyone who works there (especially the daytime weekday waitress) is crazy nice.  Probably best pizza overall in Hoboken (although Grimaldi's is neck and neck)
2015-03-29,5,I love this little place!We came here on Saturday thanks to a great deal on Groupon. We weren't really too sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised by the great service and delicious food. As many of the places in hoboken are, this little gem is a BYOB. When we walked in we had to wait a little but we were told that we could've called ahead which is huge plus. We tried a bunch of things on the menu: the wraps were really good as well as the apps. We got eggplant rollatini which was amazing, the bruschetta wasn't that great. And the arugula salad was on point. For the wraps: the boys got the grilled chicken and caesar both really enjoyed it. Pizza we got the vodka pizza: OMG- Get me another pie NOW! Perfectly cooked, a little crispy and full of flavor.  We also got the white pie- not really the best white pie I've had but I wouldn't get it again. Staff was extremely nice and hospitable. I'll be back!Oh- and if you check in on yelp you get a percentage off your bill.
2015-03-28,4,I have actually never been here... Only ordered in a bunch of times and so far it's really really good! Food is delivered hot, well packaged and really yum! I recently ordered garlic bread though and it seemed like it was just too much garlic .. I don't like biting into garlic so a ton of bits and pieces of garlic definitely not nice! You would need gum afterwords... If you know what I mean.. I would like to visit this place sometime!
2015-03-23,3,I moved from next to Grimaldis on 2nd and Clinton to across the street from Napoli's so I was excited that good brick-oven pizza would not be far away...I do have to say I prefer the crispy crust from Grimaldi's.  Napoli's crust was thin, but not as crispy. I like that they used fresh mushrooms (vs. Grimaldi's canned mushrooms), but in the end the crust is key. We ordered the hot wings as an appetizer which were actually very good.Also ordered the chicken francese sub, why was there cheese on it?  Defitely a first for me.  Also, the francese sauce wasn't that punchy.  Service, however, was amazing.  Waitress was on point. She also recommended the tiramisu which made me happy.
2015-03-20,3,I ordered a margarita pie with pepperoni and garlic knots. Was impressed by the looks of it however it was a Friday night around 730 when i placed the order and i didn't get the pie until 9:15. Pretty disappointed that it took that long but overall the pizza looks like it would've been great IF it was still hot. Granted it said on seamless est delivery time 110-130 min. I just feel like if your the owner or manager reading this you need to hire more delivery drivers if you know you're going to be busy on a Friday night.  I will most likely order again just not on a friday night
2015-03-20,1,Ordering delivery from Napolis was a disaster. The order took over an hour and a half and when calling to check on the orders they lied about delivery time. I would never order take out from here again.
2015-03-11,5,Was just about to go in to a different restaurant till we found out that Napoli's closes at 11! Just in time to get the best penne vodka and margarita pizza I ever had! So fresh and not greasy, which is normally the case for me when ever I have penne vodka. The food was amazing, server was kind and catered to us very well. Place is cute and comfy and smaller than the normal Italian restaurants I've been to but it's winded up being one of my favorite Italian spots in Hoboken!! Bonus for byob too
2015-03-08,5,The best pizza in hoboken hands down! Classic brick oven taste and always cooked to perfection.  Just be sure when ordering a pie to tell them either classic or margherita
2015-03-02,2,not the best pizza by a long shot. $9 pizza pie delivered slightly burnt.  where was the crust!? there was barely any crust on that pie, and the crust is the best part! way too much sodium and it didn't look appetizing by any means. I am definitely never ordering from here again.
2015-02-28,2,What a disappointment, took 2 hours to deliver (even though we were told 45-60 mins), and the girl who eventually answered the phone didn't really give a rip where our pizza was; when it came, the pizza tasted more like the box it arrived in, the wings were barely recognizable (and this on the weekend of Hoboken's wing fest!) And the garlic knots tasted as if fresh... 2 days before. In a city with great pizza, am surprised this one is still standing. Gets 2 stars because it sort of smelled like pizza!
2015-02-21,1,Not a place you should order from! Strangely enough, I had the exact same experience as another reviewer, Jessica N. We ordered our food and were given an estimate for delivery of 45-60min. 2 HOURS later still no food. It took 10 phone calls (not an exaggeration) to actually get a person to answer. They hurriedly claimed that our order 'Just went out the door'. Oh God. I'm in the industry, so I know this means they haven't made the food yet. I walked to the restaurant to pick up my Delivery order. At this point I'm just angry and hungry. No apology was given just 'Oh yeah, we're just really busy.' NOT a place you should submit a delivery order to. Just don't do it, Napoli's will mess up the order.Dining in may be a better experience but I'll never find out. There are so many other Italian restaurants in Hoboken. Take your money elsewhere!
2015-02-06,1,My review for Napoli's is poor, not because of the food, but because of the service.  I just ate here for the first time with 6 other people, and I was extremely disappointed.  Our waitress was very friendly and attentive at first, but then when our plates started coming out, things took a turn.  I was the only one (in a group of 7) whose lunch didn't come out with the others.  The waitress told me that they were finishing cooking mine in the kitchen so I said 'no problem.'  I had ordered an eggplant parm hero with salad on the side, so the waitress said she would bring my salad so I could start with that.  I told my friends to please start eating.  I waited 5-10 minutes for the salad, and when it came, it was very small, so I finished it quickly.  I then waited another 10-15 minutes for my sandwich, and not once did our waitress check in with us to check on us or give me an update on my food.  My friends were all finished eating by this point, so I actually had to ask one of the waiters to get our waitress for us.  When she came over, I promptly asked her to wrap my sandwich so I could take it with me (since my friends were all done eating).  She noticed I was very annoyed and did apologize and said she would not charge me for my sandwich.  However, when she brought the bill, I saw that she charged for the small side salad I ate (which came with the meal!).  The appalling part of this is that my sandwich was a lunch special, and was priced at $6 (with the salad included on the side).  So how much did she charge for my side salad?  $3.75!!  So she basically did not charge me $2.25 of the $6 meal.  Would it have been so hard to just deduct the whole $6 off of the bill for all of this hassle?  I think not.  I didn't even get to eat my sandwich with the rest of my group, yet she still charged me for the small side salad which should NOT have been priced as high as $3.75.  The whole experience was extremely frustrating and disappointing, and with so many great choices in Hoboken for food, I will certainly not be back to Napoli's!!
2015-01-30,2,All I can say is how can you deliver a $20 plain pie with the crust all burnt on the bottom. That just ain't right. I think most people would agree. And not artisanal slightly tinged bubbly doughy pockets here and there but flat over baked over dry burnt (and burnt tasting) crust. Boo.
2015-01-29,4,Napoli knows what they want to be.  They produce a consistent high quality product and they stand behind it completely.  Not happy?  They'll fix it with no drama or complaints.  I've eaten delivery, take-out and in the restaurant many times and this has remained a constant.  They've sent me free food to try just because I was curious about a menu item when placing my order.  They are also very family-friendly, unlike so many restaurants in Hoboken, and really try hard to accommodate their customers.  The food and service are solid across the board.  They also offer an excellent whole wheat crust for people who are on restricted diets.  If you want a good meal in a friendly and welcoming environment, Napoli is a great option.
2015-01-23,5,First and foremost, the staff is fantastic.  I absolutely love them all and they are very attentive.  The food is great too.  My favorites are the BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Honey Mustard Chicken Pizza.  They also make gluten free pizza and pasta.  During the Spring and Summer they sell Italian Ice which is also fantastic.   The cheer and cookies and cream are my favorite.  Don't hesitate to dine in or order from Napoli's by far the best pizza in Hoboken!
2015-01-17,5,Absolutely great! We always get the garlic knots and have tried a few pizzas. All have been great, but we love the bruschetta pizza. It's BYOB, but we always forget. Brought home leftovers and had it for lunch today - favors are great!
2015-01-12,4,By process of elimination, I have sorted through Hoboken's pizza joints and FINALLY found a spot that meets these simple criteria: 1) consistently tasty 2) can deliver quickly (under an hour during peak times, 30 minutes off peak) 3) accurately delivers the correct order every time. Hallelujah!Here's a few other things I've noticed about Napoli's. Their large pizzas are absolutely enormous so expect leftovers. I find pizza dries out in the fridge and therefore never eat the leftovers. Not this pizza. It holds up really well for a few days and is good cold or reheated. Their entrees are good and also delivered in portions large enough for two meals.Their white pizzas are awesome. I love red sauce, so the first time we ordered one of them, I requested a side of sauce to dip it in. Totally unnecessary. And the buffalo chicken is killer. They make their own buffalo sauce; it is some heavenly buffalo Alfredo hybrid. Resembles no buffalo chicken pizza you've ever had before in the best way. Good food, delivered accurately and on time seems easy, but they are the only ones I've found who get it right.
2015-01-10,4,UPDATE 2. They did deliver the Pizza to our building but to the wrong apartment. Much to our surprise one of neighbors took delivery of Pizza and signed my credit card receipt. Napoli's did end up giving us the Pizza for free and gave us a credit towards the purchase of another pizza. Kudos to them for doing so. IMO screw ups will happen the judge of a business is how they respond to make things better.
2015-01-03,5,Great experience, especially for a late pick-up on new years eve. They make a solid thin crust pizza... I recommend ordering their white pie with artichoke hearts as an extra topping.. Awesome! This is our new Hoboken up-town go to for brick oven style.
2015-01-02,4,Delicious food. Always on point. From the salads to the pizza!  Definitely a favorite for Hoboken
2014-12-27,4,I order out from here a lot. Delivery has never been an issue, once or twice it took an hour to get to my apartment, but I assumed they were slammed those nights. Dining in-It's not a huge place, but the service was very attentive. I've only dined in a couple of times compared to ordering delivery probably two dozen times, but dine in experience has been good. The reason why I'm giving Napoli's 4 stars and not 5 is because of food quality. The Pizza is very solid. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely above average brick oven pizza. Pasta dishes are huge portions, but quality wise they are just OK. However some of their other dishes-the cold antipasto (Got bad cheese in it once), stuffed mushrooms, Mussels Marinara, weren't good. It's just been fairly inconsistent across the board. Salads and Paninis are good, wraps meh. Napoli's has been my go to delivery Italian restaurant based on pretty fair price, reliability, and for some of it's dishes (Pizza, salads, and Paninis mainly). However they could definitely improve the quality on some of their other dishes. . I would recommend to others.
2014-12-18,5,Amazing pizza!!! Wow it's was so good. Pepperoni pizza is so easy to mess up but the taste of this pepperoni was on point. Hurry go on and try them out.Also it wasn't pricey nor uptight with the dress code. ATM in the store as well and TVs for you to catch the game. Hurry go on and check em out
2014-12-12,5,This is one of, if not the best pizza place in Hoboken! Besides it being BYOB, the service is amazing. Livvy was our server and she was the best! We will definitely be back!
2014-12-07,1,They forgot my soda. I called to let them know and they said, oh the driver left it in his car, he will be right up, 15 minutes passed and no soda. Called again and they said, oh he had to go make another delivery he will be back. I finished my dinner by the time he came back with my drink more than a half hour later.  The driver then told me that they lied, he didnt forget it in his car, they forgot to give it to him, blamed it on him and he didnt know he had to come back to me until I called the second time.  Wont order from here again.
2014-12-05,5,Excellent pizza. The buffalo chicken pie is to die for. Delivery is always fast and dining in is a cozy, pleasant experience. I've loved this place for months and now living 2 blocks away only solidified it!
2014-11-30,3,Some nights they are spot on and some nights not so much, tonight not so much.  Coal oven too high a flame and our in too long resulted in a dry crunchy pizza... Yuk.Penne was to aldante which was a shame as we usually get good well prepared food.  Attributing to weekend of the holiday.
2014-11-26,5,If you're looking for a good pizza- than this is the place for you!! Best uptown pizza by far- don't even think of going to that knockoff next door.
2014-11-26,3,As indicated by the other reviews the pizza is a bit above average if not spectacular, it's BYO and the price point is reasonable.  One thing I don't notice mentioned: their calzones are more than a big above average, though it should come with more sauce.
2014-11-21,2,We used to order from here but will NEVER order again for sure. (and it's NOT the best pizza in Hoboken BTW. We only ordered from here cause Grimaldi's don't deliver to us) We waited an hour for the pizza & called back to see the status. The girl told me it was on the way... NOTHING after 30 min. So I called back to cancel the order & another lady told me that the delivery guy was pulling up. NOT to mention she was implying we were being impatient since it was Friday night. SERIOUSLY? I told her I was canceling after 5min. GO FIGURE, he didn't show up at our door until 15 min later. I sent him back. SOMEONE else from Napoli calls us accusing that we were basically being impatient.. WTF?!?!?NEVER again.
2014-11-18,4,We stopped in a few weeks ago after a happy hour around the corner. The plain pie we shared was quickly, well prepared and service was fine. The pie was that great shade of neon orange alla northern NJ (looks better on pizza than people); with a great ratio of crust, cheese, and sauce. Overall great value.
2014-11-16,1,Bad service. Decent food but service is terrible for delivery. Always takes at least an hour for simple small orders. Constantly screws up orders and never care to make up for it. Been a customer for awhile but no more. Too many other places that value a customers business in the area.  Stay away.
2014-11-16,1,So I've been dying to try Napoli's and finally ordered delivery.  Ordered the margarita with 1 topping.   The pizza came cold, barely any sauce and minimal amount of fresh mozz.  Soooo disappointed.  Oh and it comes with a free soda which they soooo forgot to bring and do you think the topping I ordered came, nope!  I'm a NY'er and this is the reason why NJ still comes in a distant second.
2014-11-02,2,Had some tasty eggplant and chicken parmigiana and was excited to try their pizza specialties at a later date. Ordered the clam pizza for delivery but was sorely disappointed. It came overdone and burnt in many areas (beyond a rustic char) and the clams and dough were both so chewy that it made my jaw ache. When I added some tomato sauce to the pizza it was much improved but without that sauce the pizza was a dry nightmare.
2014-11-01,5,My boyfriend and I have come here three times. On all three visits the pizza and pasta were delicious not to mention the customer service is on point. Shout out to waiter Brian, who makes an awesome cappuccino !
2014-10-28,3,Came here after the gym with some buddies (i know the gym, pizza, weight loss.. its all one big understatement but it was my cheat meal for the week).  Its a BYOB spot like some of the other places in Hoboken and had a few beers and ordered the whole wheat margherita pizza and the white pie. Overall the pizzas were ok but not the bet and the tomatos sauce on the whole wheat pie was bland.
2014-10-24,5,Very nice atmosphere, great food and exceptional service. We ordered the garlic bread, cold antipasta and vodka pizza. Our server Alysson was energetic, friendly and helpful.
2014-10-17,4,Love this place, on a Wednesday or a bustling Friday night.  Their Hoboken salad with goat cheese and cranberries is my ultimate fav.  Oh and their margarita pizza and awesome service maybe the other reason I come back.
2014-10-16,5,Best pizza in NJ! Everything else we had was awesome: bruschetta, mussels, salads, and the large pie needed its own table it was so big! Pepperoni is from San Francisco company that is rarely seen this far East. Go there soon!
2014-10-11,5,Fast, friendly, service and super tasty pizza. Highly recommend the Vodka pizza and the garlic knots!
2014-10-03,1,Delivery is atrocious. I stopped ordering from them for about 6 months ago cause they always quote you 45-hour and in reality it takes hour and a half to get the pizza. Well just tried my luck again and what do you know a hour and a half goes by and I still have no pizza. It's not worth the aggravation.
2014-09-26,5,Came in on a Friday night with my wife and kids. The place was hopping but we were still seated quickly and attended to by a chipper waitress who cared about us having a great meal. Everyone around us had pizza, which looked great, but we went for salad and pasta. Everything was very tasty, especially the capellini with breaded shrimp, mozzarella and marinara. Yum!
2014-09-26,5,The food was amazing! The garlic knots, bruschetta, and vodka pizza are a must! Nice ambiance as well, and service was amazing for a big group of 10 people! Thanks, Napoli's!
2014-09-26,4,Love .. Love this place!! I can only speak about the pizza.. Because  we have not tried anything else. The pizza is amazing ! We tried both the Regular  and Marghaerita pizza -and totally prefer the Marghateta!! It's thin crust, fresh mozzarella an ANY topping you like!! We always get all the meats with onions and all I can say is ..DELISH!! The slices are huge so a medium is good for two!!  Hoboken parking sucks ..but honestly is so worth driving the extra five minutes!! Ask for Livvy.. Best waitress!!
