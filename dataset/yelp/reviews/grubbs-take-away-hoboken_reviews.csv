2021-10-27,4,I ordered from this place for a large lunch. I ordered for about 15 people for a 12pm delivery and everything was on time. When the delivery guy arrived he had trouble finding the spot but he found it. He set up everything but they were missing plates they were supposed to include, everything else was there. I got the vegetable hoagie and it wasn't bad. It was pretty filling. Everyone enjoyed their meal.
2021-10-23,1,We've always liked our orders from here but the fried chicken tonight was virtually inedible. Overcooked breading made it so disappointing and rock hard. Could've chipped a tooth on it. The tater tots were yummy, as always. Hoping they can do better next time.
2021-10-23,4,Very good food! I ordered late night and the food came very warm and packaged nicely. The toasted marshmallow milkshake is AMAZING! I received all condiments and utensils needed at no extra cost. Ordered off Ubereats. Two grilled cheeses with bacon and two milkshakes and fries along with delivery came up to $52. Hefty price tag for some grilled cheese sandwiches but that's the beauty of delivery apps and restaurants I also enjoyed the promo code they gave for $10 off my first delivery order through them!Overall 4/5
2021-10-16,3,This business is doing something that seems really shady, and people should know.  On the food apps, Grubbs shows up as itself, but ALSO as DIFFERENT names.  Henny Penny Chicken on Delivery, and Junior's Diner on Seamless.  Considering the business gets the orders when they go through, and the receipts show the business name, I find it extremely likely that the business knows full well that a different business name is showing up on the order.All 3 names list 418 Washington St as the address, but ONLY Grubbs is the location that registers on Google/Apple maps.  It could be "ghost kitchens", but I ordered the same thing from the 2 "different" names, and tasted the same each time.  All I know is, if I were Junior's (as in THE Junior's), I'd be pissed that another business is using a nearly similar name as leverage for itself.  Let me be clear, I'm not opposed to ghost kitchens, just the ghost kitchen should offer a unique experience entirely to the standard brick and mortar.  Otherwise, if it's the same menu (food) with a different name, that's just dishonest.  The food is ok, which is why I gave 3 stars.  But if I order from a place, I want my food to come from the place I expect, not the place I didn't want.  Ridiculous.   If Grubbs works on their transparency issues, I would consider removing this review.
2021-09-25,2,If im being very straightforward. The burgers arent tasty. Very bland in taste and the patty is crumbly like a coffee cake. The bacon jam is decently made and the chipotle ketchup needs more chipotle than ketchup. Lastly the fries are cooked to be used with malt vinegar which they dont offer. They need to be crispier if theyre going for a fries and ketchup kind of deal.
2021-09-10,1,Idiots. We ordered at 9 PM.....they delivered at 11:15 pm. You do the math. If you buy from here, you get what you deserve--nothing.
2021-09-04,5,The red headed woman with the bun... give her a raise immediately!!! She is the hardest worker and has to put up with so much. I order dessert here every weekend and she is always on point, there holding the place together! Didn't catch her name but kudos to her!
2021-07-22,3,Lowering my review after I used a delivery app to order from a restaurant called "Henny Penny" and it turned out to be a ghost kitchen for Grubbs. That means Grubb's has a fake restaurant called "Henny Penny" that they put on the apps to trick people into ordering from them. If I wanted Grubb's I would have ordered from there. Seems a bit dishonest. Of course the service was slow as usual. This made me lose trust with this place and I will likely not be back for a while if ever.
2021-06-13,2,Ordered at 1am and didn't arrive until 2:30am.  So if you're super hungry and want something fast, I'd look elsewhere.  I got a New York dog, Tater tots, and onion rings.  The dog was mediocre and the bun was soggy.  The onion rings were overcooked.  The tater tots were nice and crispy though so I'll give it 2 stars.  No condiments provided.  Doubt I'll be ordering again.
2021-06-03,5,Great food came quickly home style feel affordable prices. I recommend to anyone. We ordered the chicken strips they were delicious crispy and hardy .
2021-06-01,5,Awesome breakfast sandwich delivered hot and ready to eat, gonna order another right after this post. Thank
2021-05-26,1,NEVER GO HERE IN PERSON. The manager is a very rude woman who has called me and multiple other patrons a "f'ing asshole," "nasty ass person" and "f*ing b*tch" for no reason. I have been a patron for over a year via seamless and order pickup but have yet to be treated well in store and the wait times are absurd for a single sandwich.  Groups of 15 people have come and gone before I have received one order and I receive attitude when I check in on when it will be ready. I am all about supporting local businesses but cannot support such a rude, disrespectful manager or be treated so poorly. Best of luck to them and hopefully new management takes over soon or they will be out of business. Will never recommend Grubbs to anyone in Hoboken.
2021-05-15,1,Waited half an hour for one bacon cheeseburger. I asked for an update after half an hour and they couldn't find my order. I immediately asked for a refund and the guy in front, gave me an attitude telling me that only the manager is allowed to give me a refund. Nobody apologized and the manager proceeded to give me a refund. She told her team that they need to be more careful when taking orders so that orders don't get missed. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE AND WON'T BE BACK. An establishment that doesn't care to apologize or right a wrong doesn't deserve a second chance.
2021-02-26,1,I order food the first time and I receive someone else's order (it was worth $11 while I spent $30). Order food again the same day(dumb mistake on my part) and the food comes wrong again but the kicker is it comes with a sticker on top of the food to certify how rude this is.  They couldn't bother to check if there was something in their food. Will not order again, don't recommend at all
2021-02-13,2,I ordered two milkshakes, one banana and one vanilla. they called me and said they didn't have banana so i told them to change it to a rootbeer float instead. I got my order and it was a vanilla milkshake and a cup of ice cream with whipcream on top??? not a rootbeer float and if it was a banana milkshake it was barely a milkshake. it was literally just icecream and whipcream in a plastic cup. the vanilla milkshake tasted good but i was disappointed with the other "drink"
2021-01-18,5,This place has the best strawberry milkshake! I usually get my milkshake fix from Zinburger but this place is a great place to go to for late nights.
2021-01-12,5,It was 2am and I was served a solid BLT and tots. Can't ask much from a place open at that time, but it delivers from what I can tell.
2020-12-26,5,Midnight snacking for covid induced insomnia.  What can I say-these guys really just serve up great midnighty food.  Tots?  Yes onion rings?  Yes.  Fried Chicken fck yeah and it's still hot and crispy by the time I get it.  Plus - I haven't had an order from them packaged in styrofoam- which SO many of our restaurants still do.These folks know how to use a fryer and a grill and it's all good.
2020-10-18,3,More like 2.5 stars. Delivery time said 45-60 min but it got here in 40 min, so that's good. But the food was COLD. Jalapeño poppers were standard but cheese was not melty at all, just solid as it was cold. Easy enough to fix in the microwave. But the burger was a mess, which is disappointing since I'd been looking forward to it based on the description. I'd ordered the Jim Beam Bacon Jam burger--didn't see any sign of the cheddar or the bacon jam (though there was some sweetness to it so maybe that was it, mostly hidden by the ketchup) and the lettuce & tomato tasted OLD. Burger itself was not just cold but overcooked & chewy. Bun was soggy & falling apart. Sad that I could've gotten a better burger (and cheaper) from McDonald's even! The only redeeming factor was the brown butter toffee milkshake, which was delicious. I've ordered from here before once years ago I think one of their basic burgers & chicken sandwiches, and they were ok (but even those were better than the burger today).
2020-10-11,4,I love Grubbs when I'm in the mood for greasy, fast food. Their curly fries are actually my favorite. They are seasoned and have a slight crisp that is just right!
2020-09-10,1,The seasoned chicken wings were really bad. Salty, dry and very small portion. They also sent me a plain chocolate shake instead of the requested chocolate macadamia nut shake. Like WTF!?? I can make that at home using chocolate syrup and icecream. At least replace it with dark chocolate or oreo or hazelnut shake you. Worst lunch ever. I've ordered a burger from here like months ago and I remember it was pretty bad too.Edit: To clear things up, my phone was dead for briefly 5-6 minutes when you must have tried calling. Other thing is the chicken was dry FROM THE INSIDE. Seasoned chicken does not have to be dry from inside as if it was stale/old. And about the old burger order, I got it from other ordering apps. Imagine how terrible this meal must have been that I felt like creating my first Yelp account just to post my feedback. About me being civil, I've edited it out. But just go and check how bad other reviews on Seamless are too. Maybe there's a pattern of bad service/food here.
2020-08-03,5,This is a five star review not because any of the food is the best in its class (it's not--it's mostly frozen stuff reheated or fried), but because you know exactly what you're getting at a reasonable price, and delivery is easy online. This place fills a particular niche to me, which is cheap lunch with consistent quality, and I order often. The people that work there are great, too.I used to get the impossible burger, but it looks like that's off the menu now, which is a huge bummer. The mozzarella sticks and normal burgers are where it's at.
2020-06-29,3,I actually kind of like their cajun style fries. They were delicious. However, their burger is just ok. It's rather a thin patty so if you like a rather thick patty for your burger, you should pass. Chicken sandwich on the other hand was very very disappointing. Considering so many people are super into chicken sandwiches right now (comparing all the chicken sandwiches from popeyes, shake shack, burger king, etc) I don't think this chicken sandwich can compare close to the shake shack or popeye. I know shake shack chicken sandwich tends to be a little expensive so maybe not so fair but if you compare it with popeyes, it's no brainer I will order from popeyes.
2020-06-19,3,We've ordered from this place a few times recently and it's very inconsistent. Sometimes the service and delivery are really good and sometimes it's not. One time they forgot part of the order and had to bring it back for a second delivery. It was cold, as was most of the other food that we got in the first delivery. Last time we asked for no cheese on a hamburger and got cheese anyway... Lots of annoying things like that. Bottom line is, the food is really good so Decide if you want to deal with the drama!
2020-06-04,1,I have ordered multiple times from here and really loved the food. Giving it 1 star because the last time I ordered I had to call back 4 times  asking where the food was- she kept telling me it should be there soon. 2 hours after I originally ordered, HALF THE ORDER WAS MISSING. I had to call back a 5th time. She told me she would "rush the order" but at this point it was almost 10 pm and didn't want to be eating at midnight. Wanted a refund but was told I would have to call Seamless. She was not helpful at all and kept making different excuses. The whole experience put me off and don't see myself ordering from there in the future.
2020-06-04,1,We ordered our food, waited 2 hours and had to call four times for an update. When the food eventually arrived we were missing two items. And then we got the run around when we asked for a refund.
2020-06-02,4,We stopped in to get some food from here tonight. They are attentive when you walk in and quick to complete your order.We ordered the tater tots, Jim beam burger, 10pc wings with side of bbq sauce and jerk sauce, coleslaw, and jalapeño poppers. Total was $35.35. Definitely pricey for a fast food joint. But it's yummy.The tater tots were nice and crunchy. The jalapeño poppers were crunchy on the outside and melted goodness on the inside. Not very spicy.The Jim beam burger was yummy and cooked perfect. Little pink in the middle. The sauce is good and toppings. The wings could have been cooked a little more. The seasoning is salty and tasty on them ghat you don't even need sauce! The bbq was average and the jerk sauce is great! Spicy jerk sauce. I recommend that one! My boyfriend said the coleslaw was good too. I didn't eat it personally so no comment on it from me.
2020-05-13,4,Confused why there are so many bad reviews. I've ordered takeout from Grubbs 3x now and their burgers are pretty good! A lot of creative signature burgers and also customizable. Still can't get over their super crispy and flavorful fries! The chicken sandwich was just ok (reminded me of a McDonalds McChicken).
2020-02-28,5,I order from this place a lot and the food is consistent and delicious. But I am honestly writing this review to give a shout out to !!Phillip!! He's an employee who helped me with my online order issues, even though my food was really late. Phillip! I hope your managers see this
2020-02-15,1,Where do I start, I ordered food today at 10:15a.m., egg sandwiches l, tots, and burgers, NEVER AGAIN! Do not order delivery from this place, website says 25-30 minute wait time, WRONG , try an hour and a half! Who waits an hour and a half for egg sandwiches! I called several times, the manager said they had two drivers call out, ok I understand being short drivers, but it is their responsibility to let the customers know of the wait, don't let them pay $36 for breakfast and get it extremely late, warm, except for the tots they were cold, and thrown together, really my onions look like tape worms! Every time I called it was the driver is 10 minutes away, really don't lie to your customers give them the option to wait or order somewhere else!  I will be requesting my money back for the burger and the tots! What a waste of time and money! Danielle
2020-02-13,4,I loved eating here for dinner! Thursday to Sunday, they are open until 3am, and they deliver! We were quite hungry after the opera and, as it was after midnight, we were delighted that anything was open in Hoboken. We were warmly greeted by Chris. I ordered the vegetarian burger with cheddar cheese which was satisfying, balanced and fresh. My husband ordered the chilli, which is homemade, and he said it was delicious. I ordered the fries which were incredible (they had such a great exterior...they seemed triple fried without being hard, and soft in the middle) . . . and so I am daydreaming about them now. I almost ordered another. And the coleslaw was hands down one of the best coleslaws I had ever eaten anywhere. It had a touch of mayo but so subtle as to not be heavy nor overly creamy and it was so fresh and delicious. The service was very warm and friendly. We felt like we were hanging out in someone's home that happened to have a large grill. For 1230am, it had a lively energy with the sizzle from the grill and the laughter and comaradarie among the chefs. We will be back! I look forward to trying the sweet potato fries and the tater tots next time. I just wished they had a few more vegetarian sandwich items.
2020-01-06,1,I ordered chicken tenders and fries. When i got back to work i realized they gave me a chicken sandwich instead of tenders. Then i noticed the fries smelled like old burnt oil. I decided to eat the sandwich since i didnt have time to go back. It was alright but not what i paid for. When i got to the fries they were TERRIBLE. They tasted just as bad as they smelled if not worse. I couldnt bring myself to eat them, they were that bad. A waste if money in my opinion.
2019-11-15,1,I love Grubbs but tonight I ordered chili and let me say this is not made fresh everyday. If it was would I have found a large piece of plastic in it? I alerted seamless and they called the restaurant which offered me 20% off my next order. At a minimum they should have refunded my money on the chili. Needless to say because of bad service this will be the last time I order Grubbs
2019-10-07,5,I should have tried it earlier! The food is just amazing. I ordered California chicken sandwich. You can choose to have the crispy chicken or the grilled one. Come when you are hungry because the size of the sandwich is soooo big!
2019-09-29,4,Was looking for a breakfast place in the area ... seems very hard to find ... saw a sign on the window ... chicken sandwich 3.95... figured why not change it up and have it for breakfast ... it was great ... a nice piece of fried chicken on a fresh sesame bun with lettuce and mayo ... delish
2019-09-27,4,Over all the food was good a little pricey. Customer service at the register can be nicer :/ lady was really rude. The place is very clean and chefs are very hardworking in the back!
2019-09-13,1,I ordered  2 burgers and a milkshake today from this restaurant.  I ordered through ubereats which charges a service fee and a delivery fee.  My burger had raw onions, lettuce and some vinegar,  you can't pick vinegar out of your burger.  I ordered cooked onions, no lettuce ,garlic butter and tomato.  My son ordered  mayo, fries on his bacon burger.  He got ketchup,  raw onions, lettuce. I called the restaurant and they said it was my mistake because I didn't single out what I didn't want and that is why it was delivered as is. I told them that the add ons which cost extra where not added on . Basically it was too bad too sad. Never will I order from them they can keep thier 10 off for next order but I have to call it in. Too bad I can't give them zero stars that is what they deserve for thier service and customer service.
2019-08-18,4,Ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it was soooo gooood. Also tried the Mac and cheese bites and sweet potato fries. Def recommend for a late night bite.
2019-07-08,5,Best seasoned fries in Hoboken. I've come here a few times now and the experience and food have always remained top notch. There's a wide variety of subs, burgers, salads, and hot dog options for the whole family. If you ever have an issue with your order the owner is usually up front at the counter ready to make it right for his customer. You can truly tel he cares about both the experience you have and quality of product.
2019-07-05,4,I work in the area, and this is the place that my co-workers and I tend to order from when we're hungry, up against it financially, and are indecisive about whether we really want to order out or wait until we get home-- where I usually have fruit, cottage cheese and matzo waiting for me. Sometimes, my better nature prevails and I say to myself, "Ed, you're not a kid anymore; you can't continue to eat like you did when you were 17. Remember what you said to yourself after that day at Yankee Stadium? No? I do. You needed to go on a diet. Your doctor told you to go on a diet. I told you to go on a diet. Let your co-workers order that unhealthy food. You're better than that. You're stronger than that. Focus on the peach slices and the cottage cheese waiting for you at home; forget about that Reuben Sandwich and Seasoned Fries that Frances will be ordering, or that thick milkshake and Bacon Burger that Chris is ordering, or that Italian Hot Dog that Chuck wants..." And sometimes, I am strong.Sometimes, I'm not. Even when indulging, I'll still try to maintain at least a semblance of eating healthy--- I'll order the Turkeyburger (which is actually pretty good) instead of the Reuben, which is what I really would rather be ordering. Or I'll order the Turkey Sub, with Swiss Cheese, which is a substantial amount of food, but seems reasonably healthy. Other times, I  give up the pretense of healthy eating and order like I'm 17 again, remembering the old adage of the late Redd Foxx, "I eat the food I like. After all, you're going to feel like a damn fool laying up in the hospital dying from nothing." (Yeah, Redd, and look what happened to you...) Last night, I ordered a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Turkey, along with a side of Tater Tots (seems like they're healthier than the sinfully delicious Seasoned Fries, but...again...maybe I'm just fooling myself). They delivered a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Turkey, and Ham, and Bacon. Like a dose of shellac straight to the heart. My co-worker said, "Hey, they gave you the wrong order. I can call them back..." "Nah, don't bother." The food was delicious, health hazard or not.The prices are reasonable, and delivery is quick. Today, my co-worker Chris had a coupon, and asked if I wanted anything. I said no thanks. He mentioned they had a Chicken Sandwich on the Kid's Menu for $2. I changed my mind rapidly and said ok, figuring it couldn't be any more substantial than a Chicken Nugget. Turns out, it was a regular sized Chicken Sandwich with a substantial amount of Chicken on it. For value, you can't beat this.Not everything on the menu is a winner. Last time I ordered a Reuben, awhile back, it was a mess, falling apart in my hands and not as tasty as I was expecting. But usually the food is pretty consistent and consistently good. If you're looking for a decent, filling meal for not a lot of money, and that will be delivered quickly, this is a good place to call.
2019-07-05,1,It's like cafeteria food. Pretty sure the "smoothie" is just a slushy. Definitely not real fruit, tastes like syrup and ice. And here I was thinking I'd be safe with a "healthy" option. Disappointing.
2019-06-29,5,My favorite go to take out in Hoboken! Delicious and efficient! They have healthy options too!
2019-06-17,5,Some of the best delivery I've had in Hoboken, and the food travels well. Had the bacon cheeseburger, buffalo chicken wrap, and the fries. All were very tasty. Delivers later than most too. Would recommend if you are in the mood for some tasty food to be delivered.
2019-06-11,5,I ordered the seasoned bone-in wings. It's so hard for me to find decent, non-breaded wings in this area. To say these seasoned wings were the best wings I've ever anywhere in my life would be a disservice to what they're making at Grubbs. I'm convinced the seasoning has actual crack in it... wow!
2019-06-01,4,It's midnight, I'm hungry, I'm too lazy to go out and pick up anything, and most importantly... I just really want a milkshakeIf you've ever been in this scenario, you now how frustrating it is to be forced to settle on and whatever fast food chain is open late and an insane delivery fee with Uber Eats.Sure it may not be the best quality food, but you'll never understand how amazing a REAL spicy chicken sandwich is with seasoned fries and a chocolate oreo milkshake at 1 in the morning... until you order from Grubbs Take Away.
2019-05-19,1,Im done with this place. The food is fine, but the delivery is ridiculous. Each time the wait time has been 90 mins to two hours. I am currently on 90 minutes. I called them a half hour ago and they said it had left and was on it's way. I live 4 blocks away and it is nowhere to be found.
2019-04-28,1,First experience with Grubbs, I ordered through Uber Eats and they didn't bother putting the order in their system until an hour after I placed it. I'm still waiting after calling them and they're "waiting on their driver", no apology, they sounded annoyed we were calling.
2019-03-31,1,If I could give Grubbs a zero I would. Placed my order at 1:22 am (they are open on weekends until 3am). Ordered three burgers and a side of fries and had waited over 2 hours for the delivery!! We called four times and at first, after the first hour and our first phone call, they had no recollection of our order. Mistakes happen, so we expected our food within the next half hour. After waiting a second hour, we called again and they were clueless as to where our food was, what we had ordered, and our delivery address. Living only three blocks from this establishment it would have been much easier to pick up the food ourselves. Not to mention it is extremely overpriced for the quality of food. This place is the absolute worst and I warn everyone in the delivery radius not to order from here. "ngl best drunk food ever tho" -according to my boyfriend
2019-03-28,5,Delicious food, fast delivery, friendly staff! Love this place, wish I had found it sooner!!
2019-03-16,2,Update to my previous review....the reason for the downgrade is the delivery mostly. Like most Hoboken places, the food has slightly gone down in quality since this place became popular. Not dramatic, but still decreased. Even though this is late night junk food and not much was to be expected, It was good for that and that has decreased. The real issue I have found now is the delivery. Not all the drivers have been doing this, but more and more before the food arrives I am getting a call from the driver that night telling me where he is and that I need to come out and get it. For the $2 delivery fee and the tip I am giving you I am expecting delivery to my door, not come find you somewhere on my road/block. It's really turning me off to this place.
2019-03-07,4,This is a nice little operation in Hoboken. I was in the mood for a small snack so I just ordered the seasoned fries with a side of cheese, total with tax was $4.53. The downer was that I waited almost ten minutes for a side of fries... that's way too long for a takeout/delivery only joint. The fries were delish though, seasoned really well and a decent sized portion.  The staff was super nice, place was clean and reasonable prices. I wish they had more salad options but this isn't that type of place. Lots of variety on the menu including breakfast sandwiches, burgers, hotdogs, grilled cheese, subs, milkshakes, coffee, cake and more. There's a tiny sitting area inside with three high top chairs. A huge plus is that they're open late! This is a good late night pick-up /delivery spot ! I'm trying a milkshake next time!
2019-02-20,2,This is borderline cafeteria food. This reminds me of the good ole days back in middle school where you paid the $2 for lunch and got what they gave you. Problem was this meal wasn't $2 and the quality was similar. I ordered the reuben and it came drenched in oil or butter on the bread. I know it was delivered but the bread was soggy on both sides. It was pretty bad. The flavor didnt help either since the oiliness of the sandwich overtook everything.The burger was actually serviceable though. We got it with some jalapenos and cheese. It was a little overcooked but nothing too bad. Again this burger was not up to the standards of the many good burgers in the area. We also ordered the new york hot dog which had a good crunch to it.  The flavors worked decently. It was just a hot dog but they got it right.  The sweet potato fries were oily as well. You can tell from the pictures that there is too much grease. Unfortunately, I won't be ordering from here again. There is too much better food in town than to spend my $$ here. If the quality changed I would maybe try it but it would take some convincing.
2019-01-31,5,Food is always great not too far from where I work so they deliver quick
2019-01-05,2,This place could be decent if they got your order right and also included everything you ordered. They forgot my requested toppings on my sandwich and they didn't include the water bottle that I paid for.
2018-12-16,1,I live literally a half a mile from this place and whenever I order it takes them at least an hour and a half to deliver my food. It's absolutely ridiculous. currently I'm waiting for an order that I made an hour and 15 minutes ago and when I called to follow up they said it was just getting on the grill. must be something fundamentally wrong with their efficiencies if they cannot deliver food in a prompt manner to people that live literally in their neighborhood.....get It together
2018-12-07,3,Food is delicious!!!! Delivery takes FOREVER on high volume times which can be expected once waited over two hours which definitely felt excessive hence the missing stars. But the food is DELICIOUS so it makes the wait worth while
2018-11-29,2,Short version: it would be good at about half the price.I got a cheeseburger and some chicken tenders. Both were adequate but definitely not worth the almost $15 I paid. That's not a reasonable price for those items unless they're pretty special, and these were not.The wait was longer than expected, probably 10+ minutes. I've worked in kitchens that served food like this and it shouldn't take that long to make a burger and fry some tenders. I was the only customer waiting.Also, a couple who I suspect were the owners were managing their business in the ordering/waiting area. They had a laptop, printer, stacks of papers and were making lots of phone calls. Don't they have an office? Why are you doing this among your customers?And this is a small thing...but I asked for some ketchup to go. I was given two packets. I asked for more, and said that I tend to use a lot. I was given two more packets. $15 and I have to beg for ketchup. Next time I'll go to a diner, spend less money, and someone will serve my burger to me at a comfortable table with all the ketchup I need.Not going back.
2018-10-06,1,If i didn't call to ask I would have not know that they were actually closed.  I got $100 that these idiots go out of business by December.   And I know everyone knows you spit on your food.
2018-07-07,4,After work my co worker and I went to grab food. The place was quiet and the boss was there. He was such a sweetheart when we approached him and we had a good conversation. I ordered a turkey and cheese on a pretzel roll. My friend ordered a patty melt. We also ordered a Reese's cake and a Oreo mousse cake. Everything was delicious down to the T. Sandwiches were great. Cakes were better than any other place I've had. One thing that no one can argue about this spot is the food. Always good! Definitely a go to spot !!!!!!
2018-07-07,5,This place is simply awesome... I love this place, great food, great service and fast delivery. The delivery driver was very nice and called when they were at my door. I recommend them!!
2018-06-29,5,We love Grubbs. The owner is down to earth and just knows how to train his employees. We've always had superb customer service and delicious food. Our go-to is the chicken sandwich on a brioche bun! (pay the extra .60!) We also just got delivery and had the NICEST delivery guy (kid) ever. He even said, "thanks for grubbing with us" when he was leaving. We'll order just for him!
2018-06-28,5,My 1100th review goes to Grubbs!Grubbs is my go-to drunk food place, whether ordering delivery via Seamless, or for pick-up on the way home. It's definitely not good for you, but when you're craving late-night food, Grubbs always delivers (literally and figuratively). I usually get the fried chicken sammie ($3.99), which is like a better quality (and slightly bigger) version of McDonald's McChicken sammie. Everything is good here: the burgers, the chicken tenders, the fries. And I know what you're thinking: everything is good when you're drunk, but it's not like that. They always get the order to you in a timely fashion. I think I was once quoted a delivery of an hour, but it came in less than half an hour. So thanks, Grubbs - for lessening the blow of Saturday morning hangovers.
2018-06-27,1,Just ordered delivery here for the first and last time.. Took one bite and found TWO(2) hairs in my burger. One mushed into the top bun and one on the tomato. Called to get a refund and they only refunded me for a regular cheeseburger. Not the bacon cheeseburger with cheddar cheese which I paid more for. Always hear stories of hair in food and this is the first time experiencing it.
2018-06-24,3,I've been wary of ordering from here because of the very low/mixed reviews. But Hoboken doesn't have a ton of I need a burger, greasy food please cure my hangover takeaway spots (let alone what McDonalds and Johnny Rockets?). Grubbs is closer to my place and so I gave it a try.I ordered on Seamless and my food was ready for pickup 20 minutes later. I catered my burger toppings to my liking and everything came out correctly. The food did its job and was exactly what I wanted, but I thought it was a tad expensive for what it was (burger and two sides totaled $19) and I'm still very wary of this place due to its mixed reviews. I actually even went through my bag outside the store to make sure everything was in there bc the delivery reviews are so bad. Worth noting, there is no seating at this venue. It's truly only for carry out.If/when I become a regular I would consider updating my rating if this place became more consistent. For now truly I wish I could give this place a 3.5?
2018-06-21,3,This place has become hit or miss. It used to be amazing - not sure why such a decline. Ordered a chicken BLT wrap with sweet potato fries and asked for extra sauces and pickles on the side. I assumed my ranch and honey mustard would be in containers for dipping but instead both were sloppily smeared all over an already mess of a wrap. Fries were cold and they totally forgot my pickles. Had the nerve to credit me .65cents for the cost of the pickles upon complaining. Get it together, Grubbs.
2018-06-17,5,As a chef, a customer, and a person who truly appreciates food, Grubbs never disappoints. This is the take out spot you've always wanted. From other restaurant take-outs, its always quite memorable, and for the wrong reasons. With Grubbs, whatever you order is perfect. Burgers not greasy, and intact. Fries crispy, and sides are on point. As someone in the industry, all it takes is a place to do what they do WELL. Grubbs exceeds. You want a fast burger and fries, Grubbs is where you'll get the best in Hoboken!- Chris
2018-06-10,3,Great when it's Saturday night, and you and your crew have the 2am drunk munchies. Food is decent...just stick to the basics when late night - burgers, chili cheese fries, etc. Quick delivery.
2018-05-25,5,Matt was freaking awesome! He asked us where we were from and was just a great guy overall! Definitely a great place!! The food was awesome! Will be going back again!!
2018-05-16,3,Got burgers here for me and my son.  Average but unspectacular.  Staff was friendly, service was quick.
2018-05-16,4,It's really a take away spot. Not a lot of frills but I am happy with the food and the service. I have only ever had the burgers and fries to take away and the reviews are right the fries are awesome. I don't even need ketchup (and I love ketchup). I tried a cheese burger the first time around and it was good, then I tried the double cheese burger and that was also good but it was a lot bigger than I thought so you might need to be really hungry to get that. I will eat there again.
2018-04-23,5,Very good food. I'd definitely recommend the burgers, fries, and shakes. Also, it's only a block away from Stevens which is nice since they take duckbills.
2018-04-19,5,Cheeseburger with mushrooms was absolutely excellent. So we're the sweet potato fries - definitely worth it! I ordered Grubbs because it was the only thing open late night but I'll probably do takeout more often because so far so great!
2018-04-15,1,Did not receive order in specified time frame. Waited an hour then received a call that they hadn't even started to make my order yet and that it would take at least another half hour because they were short on drivers.. this would have been nice to know before I had already waited an hour..had to cancel since its already 9pm, won't be ordering from here again. Not reliable..
2018-04-12,5,I'm a student at Stevens Institute of Technology down the block, and this is my favorite spot in town. I'm sick of all the other places in town, flatbread, midtown steaks, bennys, etc. They all have no flavor and horrible service. Grubbs on the other hand has great food and employees. My favorite are the wings (best in hoboken by far (ask for them seasoned!)) And the workers taking my order like Karen and Matt are extremely nice. 5 stars for Grubbs!
2018-04-05,2,Stopped by for a late night burger. My order was taken incorrectly and I later realized I was overcharged. The staff was arguing in the background the entire time. The burger itself took longer than I would have thought given I was the only customer. The burger itself was fairly mediocre, though I wouldn't call it a bad burger. I appreciate the late night hours (hard to find in uptown Hoboken after midnight), but I'd likely never return unless it was my only option.
2018-04-02,5,Love this joint! We always order in. Fast and delicious. Great burgers and crunchy fries.
2018-03-10,5,Stumbled upon this place after we saw uber eats was charging a $16 booking fee for McDonalds (not proud of it). Grubbs was that good that I'm taking the time to write a review at 2am. Wasn't expecting much but we ordered a junior cheeseburger, a crispy chicken sandwich and a honey Dijon sandwich with fries- everything was awesome. Fantastic quality for the price and quick delivery for so late at night. This will absolutely be my late night go-to.
2018-03-07,5,My wife and I picked up a cheeseburger, grilled chicken sandwich, regular fries, and sweet potato fries as a Sunday Night "fun/cheat night"...everything was absolutely delicious, and the service was extremely courteous.Rivals Midtown Philly Steaks for best fries in town.
2018-03-06,5,Delivery was timely and food was exactly what we ordered and tasty and well prepared. It will certainly be one of go to places for home delivery
2018-03-03,1,I have been in the food industry all of my life. This place is an absolute mess. I gave it a few chances. Tonight they got my order completely wrong and told me they are going to remember my name and give me what I ordered next time around. If there was only going to be a next time. I will not be ordering from here anymore.
2018-02-27,5,Love this place! I got a Cheesburger, Fries, and a Strawberry Oreo milkshake. Seriously, to die for.
2018-02-08,5,The girlfriend and I have ordered from here a couple of times. Pretty quick delivery and the fries are on point. Definitely keeping this place in our late night rotation.
2018-01-27,5,Came in here drunk with my friends.  We said a lot of stupid stuff and the staff remained calm and dealt with our bs.  Had a chili burger that hit the spot.  Their fries are fried differently and its nice. It was something different to try. I really like this place.  Keep it up! My friends got the cheeseburgers and really liked them.
2018-01-20,1,Do not order cheese fries. Better off ordering fries and adding your own cheese when you get home. Legit only 8 fries were covered with cheese. Also ordered a root beer float and they give me a cup of ice cream filled to the top with no room to pour my root beer  well thanks for the cup of ice cream and a drink for later !!  Extremely expensive as well.  Where's 5 guys when you need them
2018-01-19,5,Ordered delivery from here last night off Grubhub. Really tasty snack bar type junk food when you're having a craving. I got an egg sandwich and my boyfriend got the crispy chicken sandwich and both were great. Also got mozz sticks that were good and an Oreo milkshake which was divine. They also came more than 20 min early of the delivery estimate which was a pleasant surprise. Would definitely order again.
2018-01-03,2,Came here the week after they opened and decided to give it some time before posting my review, but subsequent comments from friends who have encountered the same issues I had confirmed my initial impression. I went here expecting to find a well priced, high quality, and filling burger. Upon entry we found that a double cheese burger costs over $12 (with tax). I ordered it, thinking it must be a pretty great burger to charge that much more then any other burger place would, but I was certainly mistaken. When we tried to order, it took the employees close to 10 minutes to figure out how to work the POS system. When the order finally went through, we saw the cooks peeling our small burger patties off of a sheet and tossing them lazily onto the grill. More confusion occurred when they tried to construct and bag our burgers, and by the time we received our orders over 30 minutes had passed since we had ordered, even though our party of two were the only patrons. While we waited, there was no where to sit down, since the place was meant for "Take-Away" and since there was inadequate ventilation in the restaurant it felt like it was well over 80° the whole time. For the insane prices they charge, I'd expect these to be large, organic, hand made, tasty burgers, but I was very disappointed at the overall quality and taste of the final product. The patties were tiny and tasted completely plain. I left hungry having spent over $12 dollars, for which I could have bought two tremendous burgers at a Shake Shack. After this poor experience I certainly would not visit Grubbs again, and many of my friends have told me that their visits there have been equally unpleasant.
2017-12-28,5,Excellent comfort food and very friendly and attentive staff. The owner has been there a couple of times and he's extremely welcoming. Many Hoboken businesses could learn something from him. I love the cheese steak and my son loves the burgers, we both love the tater tots.  I hope these guys get lots of business and stick around.
2017-12-19,5,One of my new fav places! My faves include: Crispy chicken sandwich, quarter pounder with cheese, tater tots, mozz sticks.   It's all good!   and the staff there are so friendly
2017-12-10,3,I ordered Grubbs Take Away for the first time tonight off off of Seamless. I was really excited to have this for dinner because I saw a lot of great reviews on yelp. I was prepping to leave Jersey City and head back to Philadelphia and was not in the mood to make dinner. We ordered our dinner at 6-6:15 pm and the app said that we would get our food delivered between 7:10-7:20. We normally get a message from Seamless when the food is on its way. When 7:25 hit and we had not received that message, I checked the app and saw that it said our food had been delivered at 7:11 PM. I called Grubbs and the man who answered was very courteous and apologetic. He let me know that their app was messed up and whenever the food is leaving the restaurant it comes up as delivered on the recipient's phone. They told me that our food would be there within 10 minutes and it had been delayed because they received a rush of orders after ours. The food finally made it at 8 pm and while it was good food (fries were crispy-just how I like them!) it was disappointing because I was hoping to have left by then. The whole point of ordering from here was that it was supposed to be a simple and decently quick meal but that isn't what it turned out to be. While I appreciate the restaurant being nice when I called, I wish they had just been honest and told me the food was going to take longer than expected, not give me false hope that it was around the corner. Side note- if you order a sandwich, you do not get chips or fries with it like you would at most restaurants. You have to order fries on their own!
2017-12-02,1,Unbelievably terrible experience here! I Order delivery. They confirm it and accept it. An hour and half later we call to find out where our order is... first there is something wrong with their tablet (I call bs on that because we received the text saying they accepted our order) THEN oh wait sorry we are out of bagels do you want a Kaiser roll?!? Ok so were you going to call me to let me know or just wait until I starved?????? Meanwhile I'm running late for an out of town errand and I've waited close to TWO HOURS!!!!! And now it's too late to get something else somewhere else so imagine my level of frustration when all they had to do was call and let me know. Then at least I didn't spend my time waiting and waiting for an order that was never even going to be made and delivered. Won't give this place a second chance!
2017-11-25,5,Best late night delivery but also delicious over all. Never ate at restaurant but delivery is quick and delicious! I had the onion rings and tuna burger.
2017-11-19,5,I never write reviews but I felt compelled to write one.  This was the first time I had ordered from this place.  Myself and several nurses ordered the spicy chicken sandwich, french fries, sweet potato fries, breakfast sandwich, and the 1/4 pounder.  First off- I messed up the order and called them to rectify and they did it without any issue whatsoever.  When the food came, the owner came IN PERSON to introduce himself.  Clearly this place understands what good customer service means.Second- the food.  The spicy chicken sandwich reminded me of hot-fried chicken I've had in Nashville, and I heard my nurses saying "SO GOOD" as they were eating their burgers.  The fries were everything I needed and more.  This is definitely our new night-shift spot!
2017-11-10,5,Grubbs is great! Love the grubb melt. Excellent service from the team in Hoboken. My new go to for burgers in Hoboken. Yummmm
2017-10-26,4,last night, I went here with some friends. my one friend bought me mozzarella sticks, and I gotta say that they were really good! I also went here this morning for a bacon egg n cheese. additionally, I got some tater tots and they give you more than enough. the sandwich was pretty good, and the tots were expectional. I definitely wanna go back and try their chicken sandwich melt. the place is a little pricy but worth it! love it
