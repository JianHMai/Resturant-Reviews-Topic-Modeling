2021-11-06,1,I wish I could leave zero stars. Upon walking into the establishment; I was not greeted. I had to ask seated customer if they knew where the hostess was located? When the hostess finally decided to finally greet my friend and I. We were told to wait outside. Please keep in mind it was freezing outside. My friend asked for a manager. The rude hostess claimed to be the manager. If you want to be disrespected and not welcomed then go right on ahead and visit this place.
2021-11-06,1,The manager at this establishment was very rude and hostile , we weren't greeted or treated kindly ...he told us to stand outside and wait in the COLD, even tho there was seating available...I'm not one to jump toRacial conclusions but this was very much one of those moments that as a woman of color i prayed I'd never have to face ...thank you so much EAST LA for showing me the most uncomfortable night of my life :(
2021-10-29,5,Amazing service ! Amazing margs.  Amazing nachos.  Great music! Very quick service and everyone is extremely friendly and helpful ! 10/10 recommend especially for happy hour for drinks and apps.
2021-10-26,5,really cool place! good fajitas and churros. great place to watch games with friends!
2021-10-24,4,Great food it was. I liked the Quesadilla. It was soft with crunchy veggies. The enchiladas was good but didn't like the rojas sauce. Will try another sauce next time.
2021-10-05,4,Good food, strong drinks, terrific prices and no loud music! Thank God!Some snotty waitress who wasn't even serving us.
2021-09-21,1,I'll give this place only star cause the only thing that was good was the chips and salsa. Service absolutely sucks. There's this bald guy with a beard who kept telling customers to have a seat and was bringing them ice water. He got ice water for everyone that he had seated except me. I had to ask a waitress for ice water. That's so messed up. The food - not worth the price. The portions are extremely small. Now going back to the bald guy. He came up to me to ask me If I was okay while I was standing outside minding my own business but he couldn't bring me a glass of ice water. SMH !!  Like how do you bring water for everyone except for one person ???!! I would NOT recommend this place at all. Don't waste your time or money.
2021-09-20,1,So I finally went back with my friends and they didn't take our order for 30 minutes. We had to stand up and get someone, wasn't even busy... We asked for napkins and utensils they didn't bring them. The waitress was just ignoring us and when we asked her for something else she goes sorry I'm busy I'll be back and never comes back. Very bizarre. We called her again because it had been an hour and no food and she waved her hands in the air and walks away. My friend asked for the manager and the manager seemed annoyed we were saying something about the waitress. He said you know how it is because my friend told him she was a waitress. Then he comes back and asks where she works and how long she's been working there? So weird. He didn't even apologize for her behavior, they have a mandatory gratuity fee maybe that's why they give such trash service now.
2021-09-11,5,Really good food with indoor and outdoor seating. We got sangria and tacos and thought everything was very tasty. Also unlimited chips and salsa. Would definitely recommend!
2021-09-03,3,Was looking for a great Mexican restaurant in Hoboken, had great service and the margaritas were delicious but the foodwas okay. Will most likely come back just for the great happy hour prices.
2021-08-21,1,Horrible food. Very greasy. Everything tasted stale and like it was made days ago. Ships had black burned oil spots. That means they have been cooking with this oil for weeks. They add a 20% automatic gratuity to the bill. We were only two in the party, on a Saturday for lunch. Margaritas were decent. Would never return.
2021-08-13,3,5 stars for the margaritas (cheap, tasty, and strong) 1 star for the food (all their main courses are under par)This averages to 3 stars. Not a place I would recommend for anything other than drinks. The owner (young guy) was very nice, attentive, and rocked a positive mood. Appreciate that.
2021-08-08,3,Good food for the price. My friend got steak quesadilla and that was the best out of all our dishes among chicken chimichanga and chicken quesadillas. Frozen margs are yummy and v strong (lol). The service was decent too.
2021-08-05,1,So I'm changing my review cux I been here a few times, my friends like this sh*t hole n well it's near by, but today was my last time ever going there. 1. I asked for a regular menu n it wasn't even the same one they had online N that's annoying ! 2. The waiter was such a sarcastic a**hole n gave us away to another waiter Cuz I asked about my chili con queso that took 35 min! Like why does it take that long to pour cheese in a cup ? N we only got the queso ....Well I gave him a $2 tip . ‚Äç 3. The food was soooooo greasy Idk any one who would like that much oil in their burrito  like why?????? I been there so many times  their drinks n decor n overall place sucks but their food was good but not even that now . Sad I was so upset .. I had mentioned Iv been there so many times insinuating that I've had their meals multiple times and it never was like that before and the waiter was such a sarcastic dickhead that he said "oh I'm so sorry that I didn't recognize you"Like what?! I wasn't expecting u to recognize me. Mind u they where just standing around not doing much absolutely no reason why the place is so dirty why they took so long and  deff no reason why their service sucked!
2021-08-02,5,food was really good and ambience was great! the steak dishes were high quality and really yummy
2021-08-01,4,Nice little spot for a quick bite. The taco platter is probably the best option $15 for 4 tacos and a side of rice and beans. The frozen Margarita was pretty basic. I wouldn't mind dropping by to try the other items off the menu.
2021-07-31,1,I'll get into the minor details later. Biggest reason I'm giving one star: I just watched the lady bartender with shot hair eat chips and salsa behind the bar and then use her hand to wipe her nose and then immediately reach into the bucket up pre  cut  lemons/limes . Girl we are in COVID times that's just not acceptable. They also pre- pour water and leave it sitting on the bar for guests to arrive. That's weird . How long does it really take to pour a fresh water so there's no chance of bugs flying into it ?  Chips are stale .. probably has something to do with them all being pre plated with salsa in bulk until guest arrives . Ordered a margarita... it's basically a shot or cheap tequila with a margarita mix out of a slushee machine. My food took so long that the manager (or at least I think he was ) was yelling about it and even mentioned my specific food that I ordered right in front of me . He sent an employee back to check reader then taking initiative as a manger to deal with the problem. Good luck everyone !One pro: staff is nice But eating on the floor while waiting on people is a no go for me. I know it's Hoboken but have some class
2021-07-28,2,We went on a Saturday and got a table almost immediately.I felt that the whole experience was rushed. Different staff kept coming and asking the same questions. Did not even look at us while talking. They gave us Chips and Salsa as soon as we sat - Average. We place our order for drinks. Mango Margarita (Frozen) - Strong and could taste the mango flavor.Coronaria - Nothing bad, nothing great about it, just the presentation is fancy.We ordered:Veggie Quesadilla - Cheese, veggies, delicious.Fajitas - They gave us grilled veggies and tortillas. We never got sour cream and guacamole, which was very disappointing. Enchiladas - Served with beans, tasted okay.A person came to check in with us - "how is everything" and didn't even wait to hear our answer - lol. The menu said 20% gratuity for table of 4 or more. We were 3 and a gratuity of 20% was added by default. Overall - Nah. I am disappointed. And will not recommend even though I liked the Margarita.
2021-07-25,1,We went on Sunday. Got an outside table immediately. Food: it's just okay. Nothing special.Service: HORRIBLE! We were waiting long time. No one stopped by to take our order. I had to 'find' a server by keep waving my hands... The most RIDICULOUS thing is they charge 20% tips by DEFAULT for this horrible horrible service! Are you kidding me???I will never return to this place.
2021-07-24,2,People rave about the Rita's here... They are OK... They are cheap and strongThe service? Is so questionableBarely decent.For those who don't know, they seem decent.The food is nothing special at all.The prices won't kill you. I've had at vendor food that is way better....
2021-07-21,4,I've been to this place twice. The service is good and serves chips unlimited. Good spot to have a frozen drink and tasty tacos!
2021-07-11,3,East LA has been a margarita staple in Hoboken since before my time here. That being said, it's not a place I'd recommend for just dinner unless you're looking for a pregame to the night out.All in all the 3 stars is for the drinks and how two margaritas can take you from fine to zonked. The food is alright but nothing id seek out. Enjoy yourself, get lit, get some snacks but eat dinner elsewhere.
2021-06-22,3,Great drinks but their food is pretty mediocre. Their schoolyard nachos were pretty gross. The steak was perfectly cooked and delicious but the rest of the nachos were gross. Their taco salad is good but their steak burrito was really disappointing. Great atmosphere and good place to grab a margarita but don't expect a great meal.
2021-05-20,4,This place has a pretty decent happy hour and the appetizers are affordable and tasty. The fajitas aren't bad either. The ambience and food in general is decent...but what do I know, I have a small penis.
2021-05-19,5,Amazing atmosphere, delicious drinks and tasty food. I had the streak fajitas and I suffered a tummy boner and climaxed with pico de gio. Awesome service , great prices and an unforgettable experience
2021-05-11,5,Friendly host, pretty chill environment and good food if you're looking for something quick to eat. Recommend this place.
2021-05-10,5,Great service and quality food, reasonably priced, fun ambiance but not overwhelming, Covid cautious, delicious margaritas. Recommend a visit!
2021-04-24,5,Love their margaritas!!! Amazing! Perfect price, they're not watered down. Taste amazing. Highly recommend!!Ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was good. Would definitely get again. Fresh guac, sour cream and pico.Love this place!!!
2021-03-25,5,The tacos made my tuesday!! I went in craving tacos during the warm weather we were having around 6pm and it was already packed. We just missed happy hour (3-5pm), but were just as satisfied! We ordered a margarita, nachos, and tacos. I was so blown away at how juicy everything was! I feel like most taco places have everything ready and throw everything together. East LA keeps all their meats moist (I had pork and steak) and the steak was flavorful juicy deliciousness! I had shrimp and that was just okay in comparison to the steak in my opinion. The nachos were so flavorful and contained jalapenos, tomatoes, sour cream and each piece was covered! Most places just throw everything on top. I was blown away at the flavor. I don't think this place was 100% authentic but definitely hit all my flavor profiles. Def a must in this upcoming warmer days!
2021-03-25,3,My sisters and I dined here in March 2021. The staff here are so friendly and inviting! We were greeted by the person behind the bar and most of the staff when we walked in. They are super friendly! We were seated in an indoor booth. The booths are separated by plexiglass partitions so we felt somewhat comfortable eating indoors. To start off, we ordered frozen margaritas, chips, guacamole and chile queso dip. The frozen margaritas were great! Although we all ordered different flavors, they honestly all tasted the same to me. The guacamole was also great! The cheese dip however was awful! It had the texture of powdered cheese so we had to send that back to the kitchen. As our meal, we ordered enchiladas, quesadilla and tacos. The food was okay. Nothing to rave about. The drinks and the service were the highlights of our visit!
2021-03-23,1,Hands down the worst experience I've had in a restaurant. My wife and I just had our daughter and have been very hesitant to taking her out to restaurants due to covid. But today we decided to go out for drinks and enjoy the second day of spring and the gorgeous weather. We decided to check out East LA and just wanted to grab afew drinks, we sat down next to dirty dishes in the back and as soon as we sat down we let our waiter know that we were only drinking for the moment, since then we didn't see him until we got the bill. As we're drinking our margarita the host comes to our table to let us know that if there are waiting customers for our table we will be cut short and immediately be brought our bill. I asked him how long we were sitting for since I knew from the start that it was a limit of 1hr and 15 mins. I'm thinking we are 45-50 mins in since we were enjoying our first time out in a while. As he looked in his little monitor he informed us we've there for 23 mins. We were being kicked out because we weren't ordering food, mind you the back was empty and we saw a group of people who weren't being told they needed to be aware of their time. Our waiter never came back and a bus boy came in and checked up on us twice. If you can avoid the place please do. We've had better experience at a place called charritos just afew doors down.
2021-01-30,1,Love this place always great food and recommend the frozen margaritas! Just a bit weird that when I came tonight one of the waiters said they don't "call or text" people when there's a wait and they put their name down?He said "those who wait in the cold are rewarded"!! I totally respect that times are tough with covid but we just wanted to grab a drink nearby and patronize another place, which I thought they'd appreciate.Update that policy please!
2021-01-20,5,I recently moved to Hoboken and I was on the hunt for a good margarita ! This place did not disappoint and their tortilla soup is awesome.
2021-01-16,3,Service was fine. Did not have any drinks beyond beers, so perhaps they are good. The food however was so mediocre and un-tasty. From chunks of onion Salsa with chips to aged guacamole on a bland Taco salad. It does not compare to even Chipotle in flavor.
2021-01-07,5,5 stars for East LA. I am from New York where there are many various types of mexican bars and restaurants available at our reach and this is my first time trying out a mexican food place in New Jersey and it was amazing. Margaritas are strong and tasty. Food, was on point! 4 Tacos for $15 and you can mix whatever type of taco you want in the order. New York barely accommodates. My bf got the steak fajita to say savory and filling. Def will be coming back!
2020-12-23,5,First time here and definitely will not be our last! We ordered nachos and quesadillas, both of which were very cheesy and delicious. Came with complimentary chips & salsa. Also ordered margaritas which very surprisingly  and pleasantly strong - very hard to find at most places, especially when ordering a frozen drink! The staff is SO nice. Between our waitress and the manager, they are truly what made our dining experience.
2020-12-20,4,Great drinks. Ok tacos. Kinda upset they have a limited menu...I was really looking forward to eating a chimichanga  next time ! I'll def be back. Chill atmosphere. Bring your friends!
2020-12-20,5,great service and great food. drinks were strong. 10/10. i got the tacos and they are banging you can get four different flavors and my bff got the quesadillas, she was impressed by the steak.
2020-12-09,5,We ordered from this place for the first time in the middle of COVID. We got it for pick up and were not disappointed. I got the chicken fajitas and they were so good. I got four small corn tortillas with the chicken and vege stir fry plus a thing of beans and rice and corn. My partner got chicken, steak, and beef tacos and said they were great. It was a ton of food for two people at lunch so we had leftovers for another day. It was all packaged well and we can't wait to get food there again and maybe try the margs.
2020-12-07,4,Another great lunch, stopped by over the weekend and am glad we did! We ate inside and it was very nice, safe and quick. The moment we sat chips and salsa hit the table- it was much appreciated! We were hungry! We ordered chicken fajitas, cheese quesadilla, queso dip and fresh fries. The fries were delicious- you wouldn't think so but they are!! We enjoyed everything else and had leftovers. Service was great too, thank you!!!
2020-10-21,5,Overall great spot! East LA is kind of a Hoboken staple and has been around a long time-- one of the first Mexican places in this area. The frozen margaritas are good and super strong and they come in many eclectic flavors. I had the chicken quesadilla which is a basic dish but they it was spot on-- super cheesy, crusted tortillas, and very fresh tasting grilled chicken - came with guacamole and pico de gallo too.
2020-10-20,5,Good margs and good food! Plenty of options even kn their limited menu and all for a good price. I had the coconut margarita which was fantastic and the chicken fajitas which were delicious and a nice sized portion. Lots of outdoor seating and not too long of a wait.
2020-10-13,2,Incredibly disappointed in everything. I visited East LA with my cousins at the end of August in hopes for a solid mexican dinner, but everything started off on the wrong foot. First off, the wait was an hour. Not only do they not take your contact number down, they call your name when your table is ready. Which meant that we would have to stand near the restaurant for an hour until our name was called aka no social distancing because there are tons of people around us also waiting for their name to be called. Um there is a very easy fix to this... write our names and contact number down & call us when ready!!! To our luck, we were going to be seated at one of the larger tables and the group that was sitting before us were getting ready to leave so we only waited about 25 minutes. As soon as we sat down, the host or owner IDK came to our table to tell us there is a 60 minute limit on the table. Sooo....what you're trying to tell me is that the wait to be seated is extremely long and now we have to rush eat/drink and be out in under 60 minutes??? As soon as he told us this, I already knew what to expect. In my mind, I thought probably bulk frozen food put in a high capacity oven to make it look like it was "made fresh". We were excited when we saw the extensive list of flavored cocktails but those emotions went running down the drain as soon as I took my first sip. Gahhh so disgusting. It tasted like water, cheap tequila, cheap artificial flavoring, and sugar all mixed in one. What a waste of money. Will definitely not return.
2020-10-11,5,This is the place to go in you want strong margaritas for the low cost of $9. The small bar area used to get packed pre-covid times and guess what mostly everyone ordered? Margaritas. In terms of food, the food is okay. The portions are great for the price. It's not on the expensive side and it's decent. I love East LA!
2020-10-03,5,First time eating at East LA they serve the best frozen margaritas. Food was excellent. Definitely going back when I visit Hoboken again. Highly recommended.
2020-10-03,5,Don't want to say I had the best quesadilla of my life .... but I had the best quesadilla of my life. Food was great drinks were great and our server Chris was the best.
2020-09-30,5,My boyfriend and I found this place and YELP and decided to give it a try. We loved it the chips n salsa is yummy and so are the wings. He ordered the shrimp taco's and they were delicious as well.We did not sit outside just picked up but we have been back already a few times.
2020-08-25,5,Hear me out, I got something to say...Great experience all around! When we arrived there was limited seating available as everything is outside due to covid. There was a group of us and they got us seated quickly. The sun was too much so they got us drinks and then moved us to another table soon thereafter. The waitress was super knowledgeable and made great recommendations! She recommended a pineapple and coconut margarita! That alone will make me go back! The food was great. We got wings for the table and even though the wings had sauce they were still crispy! I got four tacos 2 steak, pork and shrimp! All were good but I really enjoyed the steak! Good food + great/timely service = overall great experience. Def will be back!
2020-08-23,2,Eh. Came here hoping that this restaurant would be better than some of the negative reviews but overall we were disappointed. I understand during times like these and especially outdoor dining, things must be crazy but this restaurant should definitely work on providing better service. We were seated after waiting about 10 minutes on a busy Saturday evening. Immediately after seating (I believe the owner) approached us and informed us there was a 60 minute limit on the table. Immediately I knew that this place was probably just not worth it. They rushed us to order and we were not satisfied. First off, the service was horrendous; we saw our waiter a total of two times, when we ordered and when we had to ask for the check. The food was not authentic Mexican cuisine, stick to Chipotle. A couple of us had ordered margaritas which was basically water and tequila. A lot of better restaurants in the area to visit!
2020-08-20,2,I wanted to love it here because I am from LA and grew up close to East LA and since I'm new to Hoboken I went in search of great tacos. The food was underwhelming and the service could be improved. There was great confusion about me needing a table when I first came alone and my friends joined me after. I was unimpressed.
2020-08-19,1,We were walking up and already had a table and the host purposely gave it to another couple who #1 did NOT have masks on and and #2 were both on their cell phones on speaker. When we asked the host he said we were too far away from the host stand so we weren't technically there. When I asked why they were sat without a mask I was told you only have to have one while waiting. NOT walking to your table. I have never encountered there's such a rude host and the fact they just let them go without a mask and it was for a specific reason, other wise the restaurant would have been called out for another reason.
2020-07-30,1,It's not what it use to be! I went on July 7th just to have some lunch. Service was bad. NEVER was greeted nor served "chips & salsa" like all customers are suppose to receive! Then the ignorant waiter kept forcing food & drinks on me which to me is AWFUL customer services! I ordered nachos & the first batch was BURNT, got a second batch & look at the cheese! So yea they're horrible and disgusting now & to the "manager" you can tell he doesn't know how to MANAGE.... they told me nachos come out burnt & the way they were.... also expected a non eaten meal to be paid for.
2020-07-26,4,I had a good experience the food was ok but not a large selection. I would definitely go back for the drinks. I had the mango margarita and it was the delicious. The customer service was on point the staff was polite, friendly and fast. Overall I was satisfied.
2020-07-18,2,So I was here two weeks ago and it was a very humid day. It was about to rain so they began cleaning up their outdoor seating area. I was parked close by so I went to my car to choose what I wanted to eat before calling in my order. Once I decided what I wanted I attempted to call but the line was busy... so I tried calling a couple more times with no luck. I decided to go walk up to the restaurant to see if I could order in person since I couldn't get through to them. I was told two different waiters that they would only take my order over the phone. I tried explaining that the line was so busy it wouldn't even ring and they continued to tell me they wouldn't take my order unless I called. May I add that they had no physical customers because it was about to rain and they were not busy but they continued to brush me off. Anyways, I went back to my car and starting looking for a way to order online which I eventually found. Once ordered, the food was made quickly. We also ordered drinks which we received in strange Tupperware containers that are not meant for drinks and they were so strong. The food was very good but the terrible service and drinks really turned me off from this place.
2020-07-15,1,I would not recommend this restaurant. From the start we had a weird sense of the service. Someone took our drink order, then five minutes later another waitress came up to us insisting that we didn't place an order yet. A few minutes later we placed our food order. VERY Shortly after our food came out. My boyfriends food had hair in it. It was very hard to get the waiters attention. Once we did he took the plate away with no apologies. My boyfriend and I then asked for the check without eating anything and left the premises. Charritos which is a couple doors down has better quality of food and service.
2020-06-20,4,This review is mostly for the margaritas! They have so many different flavors to choose from even nonconventional ones like blue curacao. I tried the strawberry frozen marg to go and my friends tried the passion fruit. The margs to go are in the small sized plastic containers. Everyone agreed they were delicious and boozy, but a little on the small side. It did take a long time for our order to come out and they don't really have any space outside to wait for your order.
2020-06-18,1,Expecting they would have stepped up their game during these crazy times, we decided to pop by for some drinks & food. We were told to order online, where we decided to get two orders of the 4 for $29 margaritas, a few tacos & buffalo wings. We were extremely disappointed to find out that the drinks weren't packaged in togo cups, they were poured into a small plastic Tupperware; without any labeling to identify. On top of that, the tacos were completely cold. At this point, we were all disappointed! Do not recommend! There's better Mexican restaurants around, actually there's one on the same block that I recommend, Charritos.
2020-04-05,3,East LA evokes a sense of nostalgia from warm spring days during my senior year at Stevens Institute of Technology. We were counting down the days towards graduation and entering the real world. A few of us had night classes (6-845pm if memory serves) a couple days a week, so we'd regularly hit up East LA for a pre class serving of chips, salsa, and their amazing frozen margaritas. Fun times.The food was never the best. In fact it used to be pretty bad, and Mexican food is pretty damn hard to mess up. Recently it's gotten better. The tacos during their weekly specials were actually pretty decent (especially the pork). The frozen margarita still packed a punch. But - in a sign of changing times, they've started already including an 18% tip to the bill - even for parties as small as 3.  The food (tacos aside) can be hit or miss. And the booths are not exactly roomy - you better hope you are close friends with the person sitting next to you, because you'll be pressed up against them for your entire meal (and if it's winter and you need a place to put your jackets - forget about it).Overall a decent option for drinks and light snacks, but double check the bill so you don't tip twice. Protip: blue frozen margarita.  get it.
2020-03-11,2,Their burger  Without any sauces or services like napkins and forks  It lacks salt  I ordered well done but the bacons are rare
2020-02-28,1,Out all the time I been here and never got limited of how many margaritas I could have until today that the old lady told me that they only have a limit of 3. Then ask for a corona and said can't do it but going do it for you , I been to that spot so many time over 10 year will never go back there .. bye East la and lastly your happy hours drinks are water down
2020-02-22,5,Great service and can't beat their HH during the week! Half off apps and $6 margs! Margs are strong and delicious! Wings are very good but too saucy.  Very fun environment, the bar is small and gets crowded.
2020-02-01,3,Came here for Happy hour and then ordered food to go. Great specials and nice little place which gets packed at night . As far as the food - it's good but nothing special. I had the chicken quesadilla which was a nice portion as well. I'd pass by here for a quick beer and apps again.
2019-12-14,3,Love the margaritas! Strong and delicious. We ordered the chili con queso and it tasted like nacho cheese you'd get at a baseball game... not a fan at all. But if you're just in the mood for some drinks, I def recommend it.
2019-12-12,5,Love this Place  my margarita  and school yard nacho platter my fat mexican as well so u will love it  extremely  friendly staff
2019-12-03,5,I was born and raised in Southern California and authentic Mexican food abounds, so I admit I can be picky about my Mexican food and when a friend suggested we go to East LA in Hoboken, I gave him major side eye. But damn. I was impressed. Their margaritas are the absolute best. I had a margarita on the rocks and was blown away. I learned later that are known for their mixed margaritas and those are absolutely delicious. They have over a dozen flavors and of the ones I've tried, none are too sweet, which can be a problem with fruit flavored margaritas. You can order by the glass or order a small or large pitcher. The pitchers are a steal at $24-$32 for the standard margaritas. A large pitcher serves roughly 4-5 tall glasses. The food was good and the portions generous. The wait staff are incredibly friendly and attentive. They kept on top of filling up our glasses and making sure we had everything we needed. I wish I traveled through Hoboken more often do I could eat here on the regular.
2019-10-29,4,This is a great affordable Mexican restaraunt in Hoboken. Love the chips and salsa but they cap you at 2 or 3 servings. Came once when it wasn't crowded and the service was great. Came on a Saturday night when it was pretty crowded, service was terrible, had to wait fifteen minutes for water refills. Food is pretty good and tasty though. Atmosphere is more for 20 year olds and drinking. Overall, 4/5 stars.
2019-10-23,5,Amazing atmosphere, amazing staff and most importantly amazing food and cocktails (the raspberry and coconut margarita is popular for good reason). Alone, with friends or even with family, you'll feel right at home. The waiter Ryan supplied the tunes tonight and it was mainstream accessible but not overplayed, you wont roll your eyes listening to his picks, i swear.Kickass first dinner on the east coast for this Australian boy.
2019-10-16,5,Top place in the area for margaritas and tacos. Good prices during Happy Hour. I went on a Thursday and it wasn't too crowded! The margaritas were strong and the flavors were interesting. I recommend the simple lime or strawberry though. The steak tacos were the best!
2019-10-11,3,The food is good and the staff is sweet but honestly they make the worst margarita I've ever had. Buzz kill
2019-09-22,2,Food: GoodDrinks:GoodHostess: Amazing 10/10Waitresses: HORRIBLE! Sarcastic is an understatement, with a dash of rude remarks. They were horrible. Management should do a double take on how the waitresses treat their customers.
2019-09-08,3,Mediocre at best. Food was okay, ordered a frozen marg and when the waiter brought it to the table half of it was pure liquid already. Not terrible, wasn't the best. Wouldn't go back
2019-08-30,4,If you know, you know. You can't go to East LA without ordering margaritas, that's blasphemy. However, do know that they have a 3 drink policy because well.. their margaritas are strong and 3 should be just fine before you move on to your other shenanigans. For the margaritas, they have single glasses and pitchers on their menu. Pitchers normally serve 5 tall glasses and they have a ton of flavors for you to choose from. I believe pitchers are $24-26 dollars which is a total steal.If you're not a fan of the super sweet flavors like me, the strawberry was subtle and didn't overwhelm my palate. Now the raspberry on the other hand, get it away from me-- way too sweet. The food here is actually pretty tasty. I've had their tacos and guacamole and ate every last bit of it.
2019-08-21,5,I LOVE this place! Their frozen margaritas are so tasty and i always get the steak nachos. mmm mmm gooddd
2019-08-21,1,I came here yest with my 4 friends 5 in total. They told us we couldn't sit in the patio it's only for 4 or less. We sat inside. Our server was inattentive, we had to wave him down for more chips 3 times due to the fact we had guacamole. We waved him down to oder our food, he never came to check on how we were doing. When we were ordering he was so quick to leave and we weren't even done ordering. This was our first time here, being that we are all servers that serve at a Mexican rest in Fairfield we were not satisfied and will not be returning to this establishment.
2019-08-07,3,My boyfriend and I came here for drinks. We were unable to sit outside as it was for only people who were dining. We thought that was a little odd as it was only 5 pm and no one was sitting outside.As we ordered a couple rounds and sat by the window we saw many of the clientele come inside because they were too hot to sit outside. Just our luck, people who actually want to sit outside get caged inside.The drinks were good. We ordered a couple different flavors of the frozen margaritas. I enjoyed the mango and sangria.
2019-07-21,3,Not the worst I've had, not the best I've had either. Listen to the 3 star reviews here. Servers were attentive and quick with the food. Drinks were mediocre at best.My partner and I got the combo to try a little bit of everything and both of us had plenty of food leftover at the end; not due to quantity but lack of desire to eat.Tacos/ tostado/ enchilada were over salted and dry.This restaurant will pass as standard American Mexican restaurant but let's be real... if you want real Hispanic or Mexican food .... go a little north to union city or west New York and get real Mexican food that's exponentially better and more bang for your buck.
2019-07-19,5,Very welcoming staff, food is always delicious, and the frozen margaritas never disappoint.  My family and I have been coming here for over 15 years and will continue to be loyal customers! Please check them out!
2019-07-15,5,I more than often come here for the drinks than the food so I can't say much about the menu other than it's satisfying. Margarita Mondays absolutely are my favourite, from the strength and the flavour (my favourite is the strawberry Marg!!!), and there's also Taco Tuesdays and Happy Hour and like, I seriously cannot be more in love with this place. Jeff, my usual bartender, is littttteralllyy amazing. Service is always great despite the place always being so packed.
2019-07-08,1,Sorry to say. The food was horrible. Everything tasted like it was bought prepared and frozen from Acme Market. It was far far from Mexican cooking. The drinks also horrible. I haven't had such bad food in well I can't recall. I was extremely disappointed. Have been to Mexico many times. Lived in California many years and Mexican food there was wonderful. So sorry for this review!
2019-07-07,5,i got the spicy garlic shrimp over grilled veggies. absolutely delicious. cleaned the whole plate and the server was happy because he said that's his favorite dish. and the rice and beans it also came with were bomb. their service is super chill so don't expect them to come quickly or bow to your every request (in a good way). it's homey and so when you want the check, ask, when you need more water or more tortillas, ask! they're all super nice people. it definitely offers a relaxed yet energetic vibe of that makes sense. i guess NOT uptight is what i'm trying to say. anyway SALUD!
2019-07-05,4,I love love love wings and if you want a different type of tasty buffalo wings this is the place. They have a unique zingy to them. They also have every flavor in margarita you can think of
2019-07-04,1,I been passing by this place for so long and finally my husband and I decided to try it. Well let me tell you what a disappointment. We got greeted walking in and got seated right away. That was great. We then got greeted by 3 different people back to back already showing you the lack of communication. One took our drink order, another took our appetizer order and the third had no clue those orders were taken already. We then order our entree from one of them. At this point we have no clue who our server was. Sure enough my husbands entree (tacos) arrived before our appetizer. Meanwhile I had been watching the kitchen window the whole time since we were sitting close to it. Those tacos that they served my husband were sitting at the window for about 10 minutes before they got brought to another table in the front of the restaurant. Another 5 minutes pass by before those tacos were returned to the kitchen window. Sat there for another little while and then they tried to serve them to my husband. I informed the server that brought the tacos that we were still waiting on our appetizer so he returned the tacos to the window. Our appetizer arrive finally ( didn't take too long). The presentation was terrible. We ordered a sampler of different things and honestly there was nothing special. The wings were barely covered in sauce. They were extra crispy and honesty looked like they just slapped a spoonful of sauce over some wings that had been sitting there for a while and refried multiple times to keep them warm. The entree again nothing special. My husband ordered a variety of fish tacos (hopefully they didn't serve him the same one from earlier) and there was nothing to them. Mine was a combo of a taco, burrito and enchilada and it was so bland. It was honestly what you expect from a TexMex Chinese spot, but worst. And the Margarita omg! Talk about a crappy margarita. They didn't even ask if we wanted frozen or on the rocks, automatically comes frozen, with some crappy artificial pureÃÅe, no salt or sugar rim or garnish to make it look exciting. Needless to say for a place that's called East LA, it was from from what you would expect at a East LA joint. Being the LA is closer to the border and got fresh produce super populated by Mexicans you would expect really good food. But this place was far from that. I do not recommend at all. Stay away. On a good note, the mob of servers that took care of us were really nice. But not enough to come back.
2019-07-02,5,Favorite place for Happy Hour. Good and basic frozen margaritas and I think it's half off appetizers.
2019-06-29,3,Unimpressed with the service. I ordered a margarita and asked to sit outside on the patio (mostly empty). They told me to sit there I had to order food to sit on the patio and instead gave me a solo seat facing the wall.The margarita doesn't taste as flavorful when the service is not up to par.
2019-06-12,4,Just looking for Mexican food options in the area and walking down the street when we noticed a giant neon sign "Mexican" on the window. The ambience is causal and relaxed, there's booth seating and two main TVs broadcasting basketball when we went. The menu isn't super extensive but the kitchen accommodates to special requests which is awesome!! My favorite thing about this place was the combination platter where you can mix and match 2, 3 or 4 of a given burrito, enchilada, taco or toastada combination! The food was good and filling! I got one enchilada and one taco (both vegetarian) and was full about the sides and taco, saved the enchilada for later! The vegetarian option comes with grilled veggies (squash and zucchini and onions) so if you're not a fan of any of those i wouldn't recommend that option or just ask for it with beans! The only minus were the stale chips and chunky/watery salsa in the beginning but can't really complain when it's free
2019-06-07,1,Poor customer service by the "hostess", very poor. Yelp wanted me to add more details but "very poor customer service" says it all
2019-05-26,1,This was the worst food I've ever had. The staff is terrible, all had attitudes and were extremely unorganized. Half of the food we ordered were missing items. I do not recommend to anyone. For being located in Hoboken, a place known for their food this is shocking. If I could give zero stars I would. I DO NOT RECOMMEND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
2019-05-18,1,HORRIBLE. The food wasn't even that good and just because we had five people at the table (that wasn't even 18 years old) and the server charged us $18 for tip. Without asking the owner of the card they automatically charged it to the card. I am very disappointed .
2019-05-13,5,One of my favorite places to visit in Hoboken. Whenever I am in the area I always make sure to stop in here. Specifically for their frozen margaritas. I normally get the Sangria Margarita and Blue Caracao Margarita and with two I am satisfied. My husband loves the wings from here and the food is delicious as well. I always look forward to coming here! Also, the chips and salsa are free *thumbs up*
2019-05-05,1,Today, a table of FIVE got seated way before us because "they have different size tables" meanwhile, I am not a table of two, I am a table of three. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR 30 minutes. Not fair when a whole group of white kids are selected way before us. Where is the customer service? I don't know if I will ever come back here. Kiersten has to be the reason why... she is awful. Like I never want to come back here because of her. She's probably the worst person I have ever crossed paths with. I was talking to her and she started walking away. Only reason I gave one star. Other than that, everyone else is great. She's so rude and frankly I don't even understand how she works in such a nice atmosphere. I'd love to come when she's not here. Send me the schedule when she's NOT there.
2019-05-04,1,Extremely discounted! If I can give zero stars I would, but unfortunately I have to give 1. My cousins from Massachusetts came down to visit and constantly hyped up Hoboken and how much fun it is. Filed with hope, our group was ready to let loose, and experience the side of New Jersey rarely offered to outsiders. Upon entering this bar, we were quickly turned away. Distraught, we wanted to press on, but were told with the repeated junction of "no".  It was sad for a security lad to quickly turn away 6 fellows, especially since they were all out to have fun. Of no understanding, we were told that " you guys can't come on." To our bewilderment, this place has just lost out unnecessarily on a few hundred dollars, all because they quickly judged our group. I wished we could have experienced a fun outing here, but If your group even looks slightly intimidating, you'll be denied service. I hope other groups don't succumbed to our fate.Unfortunately, our first location we decided to attend was "East La". Before we even had the chance to enter their restaurant we got rejected because we looked intoxicated? My cousins were literally about explode but I told them don't bother, held it together, and decided to move on to the next restaurant. I can't say I tried their food or share experience because we were not allowed to even offered the opportunity. I'm not sure if it was being discriminated or biased. Maybe we weren't dressed for the occasion but beside that, I am very disappointed that we were prejudged upon arrival. At the end of the day the lost to make a profit. Oh well.
2019-05-03,5,Assumption: mediocre Mexican food with a loud bar.This place actually exceeded my expectations because even though the restaurant was crowded, the staff was attentive and the food came out fast. The food is fine! Guac was actually really good, the margs are strong, and my friends enjoyed their meals as well. It definitely is loud and rambunctious on weekend nights, but overall a fine spot for Mexican food in Hoboken.
2019-04-16,4,Really nice staff, cool atmosphere. Happy Hour was Great $13 for a margarita and 3 tacos the flavor is there and bottomless chips and salsa!!
2019-04-14,4,I came in tonight with my boyfriend . We got the quesadilla and. A pitcher of Margaritas. As a Central American I can u... it was horrible!!!! All water with lime... thank god for the best waitress ever , Silvia .. she made our drinks her self and saved date night!!!! God bless her and her talent we need more ppl like her ...p.s work on new mixologists .. taqueria jersey city has so far winning authentic Mexican margaritas.. not this water down lemonade
2019-04-12,4,Solid chicken tacos & an excellent selection of margaritas. Try to sit out front on beautiful day.
2019-04-04,5,WAIT. I love this place.The chicken fajitas are the best I've ever had. I know I'm prone to excitement in my reviews but I'm reeeeeally passionate about East LA. At 545pm on a Wednesday this place was poppin. Amazing. Got a table lickity split, drinks and salsa and chips brought over fast. Great selection on the menu; not too overwhelming but still diverse options. But these fajitas! Lots of peppers and onions with a good ratio to chicken, none too spicy at all (no heartburn afterwards, yay), delicious tortillas and sour cream. GIMME MORE.
2019-03-31,3,Soon as we walk in we got a booth on a packed happy hour day in Hoboken...service was great, we were actually trying to be in and out because the meters are ridiculous, spent about 7$ for only a hour and some min....so we ordered our food, everything came, we ate, meal was good, i had the chimichanga ...perfect meal for my fat self....lol...my girl just went with the margarita...PS TOOOOO STRONG, we even checked other tables, it's like you guys pour liquor blind and over do it which kills the taste of the cocktail ordered...going right to the point though that has been weighting on me while writing this ...reason why I decreased stars is, they already take out the tip in the bill which hurt me because I'm an actual tipper, they would have had more gratuity if they didn't do what they did is all I'm saying!
2019-03-27,5,The pork tacos were AMAZINGG! Their taco Tuesday deals were also pretty awesome. 3 tacos & a margarita for $13?!  and they're not the typical watered down margaritas either, like Jesus it was so good! Def recommend if you're trying to ball on a budget or get lit for less.
2019-03-18,4,Came here after work with some coworkers for a quick dinner and drinks. Their steak tacos and guacamole were good but the highlight of East LA is their frozen margaritas! Well-known in the area to be STRONG (dangerously so!), they also come in great flavors!
2019-03-18,1,Went to East LA on a Saturday evening at 8 pm for dinner.  The music was extremely loud EDM Basshead music that isn't meant a restaurant.  The crowd that was there was also extremely loud and even yelling.  The tacos come with no sauce on them (only green salsa on the side) and still they are extremely dry no flavor.  We ordered frozen margaritas, mine had no alcohol in it but my friends was full of alcohol.  The chips and salsa are the best part, and we had to ask 3 times for more.  Would not go back or recommend.
2019-03-14,4,I was definitely pleased with my dinner. I came with some friends for happy hour. It was loud and packed as expected. I got 2 fish and 2 shrimp tacos. Wasn't the best seafood tacos I've had but I don't have any complaints either. They got the job done. Our server was very friendly and fun. He recommended the frozen margaritas which were strong and delicious. My favorite part was the salsa though. They definitely do a good job with that. I would definitely come back for the service and ambiance and to try something new.
2019-03-11,5,Delicious spot my girlfriend and I stumbled upon. Great food, strong drinks, FANTASTIC service and a family feel. Definitely a go to spot if you're visiting or living in Hoboken.
2019-03-10,2,Was my favorite spot to hang out at. Been going there for years. But new management feels they can single out certain people for talking loud even thought everyone in the restaurant is speaking loud. Needless to say we left without eating. The best thing that has not changed is the waiter George always great dealing with George. Won't be going back.
2019-03-04,1,Sunday night, quiet inside. Came for dinner with two people. Waited 15 minutes FIFTEEN MINUTES for someone to bring us water and longer to get our margaritas. My sister ordered a spicy margarita and it was literally jalapenÃÉo juice, canned JalapenÃÉos water and tequila. *the waitress said "sorry for the wait, I asked for jalapenÃÉo juice and the kitchen thought I said cheese". Loss for words. Allegedly service was horrid because they were "changing shifts" but the waitress just wasn't attentive.  I had tacos that were decent. Nothing terrible but nothing to rave about. The fajitas and chimichanga were all mediocre. When we got our check they up-charged my tequila, club soda slash of tequila. When I asked, she said "if you would've ordered a shot, we wouldn't have charged you extra". Stupid. I would come here for the yummy but sugary, frozen margaritas but not for food or table service.
2019-03-01,5,East LA has delicious margaritas and a wide selection of flavors. I can't comment too much on the food, but will say that the service was amazing, especially for Hoboken where bouncers and bartenders have a reputation for not being too nice. I came on March 1st and all staff here were great from the bouncer to the hostess and the bartenders. They all made the night that much better. We will definitely be back soon. Thank you!
2019-02-26,1,So here I am here on taco Tuesday and they have a special here where is 13 for margarita and tacos however we receive a bill for gratuity of 11 and the waiter states that because there's a special the include gratuity yet there's no signs or anything in writing that says that ! The place is some shit ! I'm going to make sure this place gets audited because I have time
2019-02-16,3,My boyfriend and I visited on a busy night. Despite how busy it was, we were immediately greeted and welcomed with a smile. We chose to sit by the window because otherwise it would have been an incredibly long wait. Not the best spot to sit and eat as space is limited, but we had our own little corner which I liked.Although all in all the service was good they made a few mistakes here and there like forgetting to bring my boyfriend's rice and beans with his order, which we didn't even get to ask for again because they didn't check up on us once they brought us our food, so we had NO sides for our tacos. We weren't totally mad because it was busy, however we still had to pay in full... Anyway, let's talk FOOD! I got fish tacos and they were great! We also gave the guacamole a try and it wasn't the best we had, but still pretty good.All in all I feel like I'd like to give this place a second chance. On a day that's less busy!
2019-02-14,4,So glad to have come back to this location after so many years. Not much has changed: same quick service, nice hospitality, awesome margaritas and decent prices. As we sat we were served fresh nachos and mild salsa. We ordered taco salads with steak. It's basically a tortilla shell/bowl filled with lettuce, corn, black beans, pico de Gallo and cheese. It comes with a side of guacamole. I recommend asking for the cilantro sauce on the side then pouring it all over the steak. The margaritas are well known here. They're made to perfection with just the right amount of alcohol where you won't taste it, yet it will creep up on you by the end of your first drink. There is a bar on site for those who want to come in and opt for just drinks. The bill for for two salads with steak and three drinks averaged about $60. This is definitely one of my top favorite Tex-Mex locations.
2019-02-02,3,Fun place. Pretty good Margaritas and ok food. Met a friend here for drinks.  He loves the place!  I got the shrimp quesadilla but didn't like the included corn inside. Queso kinda sucks. But totally enjoyed myself with the staff. They are so nice and welcoming.  Jorge was the best!
2019-01-30,3,The food was alright, I was expecting a little more based on the reviews. We took it to go and didn't have any napkins or utensils to eat, which was a bit annoying.
2019-01-20,5,Great place for hanging out after work. Great place period!!! Friendly atmosphere, excellent food, awesome margaritas. If u haven't been... Go!
2019-01-09,2,The guac was brown and tasted like the wholly guacamole brand you can buy at the grocery store. They have semi good happy hour deals but you get what you pay for. Store bought taquitos from Costco thrown on a play the type place. If you have enough energy to stay home and make Mexican yourself I suggest you do that instead.
2018-11-26,3,Ambiance: 6/10 Food: 8/10 Drinks: 6/10As a Texas transplant, I expect a lot from my Tex Mex. The fajitas at East LA put up a good fight and were surprisingly very good- extra spicy like I asked them to be and a big portion as well for $14! The margaritas,on the other hand, deeply disappointed. I don't know if this is because I went during Happy Hour or something,but they were not nearly as good or even strong as everyone hyped them up to be. I had a frozen marg as well as an on the rocks one and neither was too enjoyable. I'm willingly to try again when it's not happy hour because maybe then, the drinks might be better? The regular prices seem not that great though,so I would want to be pleasantly surprised at how good the margaritas are at full price of $9.
2018-11-19,1,No good not really Mexican food Place was cool but no to east Mexican maybe they need to change the food to American food wings burgers fries
2018-10-30,4,This is the second time I've been there, and it was even better than the first time. The food is honestly so delicious. I loved their flautas, their tacos, and their burritos. The free salsa and chips is so delicious. The salsa tastes so fresh and it's honestly addicting! They say that their specialty is the frozen margaritas, but the regular ones are tasty too!The service both times I've been there is great! They're super attentive, friendly, and helpful. The location is also super cute too! They have some televisions there near the bar if you want to watch any sporting events. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a great sit down Mexican food.
2018-10-27,1,These might be the worst tacos I've ever eaten. My BF was in the mood for Mexican, and we've been meaning to give this place a try so we decided to head on over one Saturday afternoon at around 2. The place was pretty empty.To start, they bring out some chips and salsa. The salsa was pretty good. For my main, I decided to go with the four tacos combo ($13). I ordered beef, steak, fish and pork. A minute after our waiter took our order, he doubled back and asked which ones I wanted (since he didn't write them down). When my tacos came out, it was chicken, steak, fish, and pork. Seriously dude, invest in a notepad or something. I didn't send it back since I was pretty hungry at that point but I wished I had after I had a bite of the chicken taco. It tasted really old like it had been microwaved over and over. But after tasting the rest, sending it back probably wouldn't have made a huge difference anyway. Everything was super bland. The steak was very chewy, the pork was dry, and the fish just tasted like a defrosted piece of fish. BF ordered some combo that came with a shrimp burrito and an enchilada. We were shocked when they tacked on a fee to our bill because he chose shrimp (it didn't say that it costed extra on the menu). If you like big portions but don't mind poor quality, then East LA is for you. But if you like good Mexican food, you can skip this place because you won't find it here.
2018-10-17,1,This place does not even deserve a star.  Upon arrival we sat down had great frozen margaritas. However after the food arrived we saw a cockroach on the wall and then on our table.  We were disturbed and grossed out and spoke with our waiter.  The waiter seemed unfazed and stated he would get the manager.  The manager came to our table and stated that this is an occurrence on Tuesday and Friday.  We were disturbed by the events and the response we received.  We will never be returning.
2018-10-06,4,The margaritas from this place are really good. My personal favorite is the sangria margarita. It only takes a couple to have you feeling nice. The food is mediocre nothing extravagant. I recommended  just getting appetizers, their entrees are ok. If you go on a weekend the service and wait is a little longer than usual with the big crowd.
2018-10-01,1,This place is under new management and they are cutting every corner they can. Couldn't tell the difference between chicken and steak quesadillas because neither contained meat. Even the salsa isn't what it used to be. Had an upset stomach after eating here. Too bad -- used to be a great place.
2018-09-07,1,Awful!  Under new management.  Not very clean, Manager was rude when we heard guest complain.  If you don't like the food or drinks you better forget about it and eat it because they won't let you return it!  Lamps are dusty and entire place needs a Bar Rescue .  Won't return.
2018-08-23,4,This is a Hoboken mainstay; my parents used to go here in the late 80s/early 90s when they were newly married young professionals, and in a Hoboken now filled with trendy restaurants and bars, this place has staying power, and for good reason.This was only the second time I had been to East LA -- had gone with former friends--so I didn't remember much about my experience other than that I enjoyed it, so I was determined to have a fun time. My mom and I snacked on chips and zesty salsa as we ordered margaritas "schoolyard" nachos with chicken, and shrimp fajitas.The margaritas are dangerously strong, and have them in nearly every flavor you could possibly think of. Additionally, they aren't all alcohol or all sugar, even in their frozen form (I'm usually a rocks and no salt girl). The Schoolyard Nachos appear to be no frills (individual chips and cheese); however, they are packed with flavor in the form of well seasoned chicken, refried beans, and of course, endless mountains of guac and sour cream. As for the shrimp fajitas, they were able to stand out on their own. Shrimp was well-cooked, tasty, and the onions and peppers balanced out the seafood.Needless to say, I remembered why I enjoyed this place the first time around; great food, strong drinks, and a fun atmosphere
2018-08-20,1,This is the worst meal I've had in Hoboken. With so many great places to eat in Hoboken, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. Canned corn, oily guacamole, bagged cheese that was barely melted...just really not good.
2018-08-19,1,The food was just mediocre. The cheeseburger quesadilla was the best part of the meal, the wings were cheap, but not that good and the tacos were very bland. The flavored margs had too much flavoring so that it was hard to drink. There were fruit flies everywhere. We also waited a long time for our server to check in on us, so long we thought they forgot one person's meal, and again at the end we waited forever to find someone to ask for the check. Also our order included two items on the specials menu so the bill came with 18% gratitude on the non-discounted price. There was no explanation of this prior to the check or when the check came, we had to ask what it was while paying.
2018-08-13,5,This place had attentive and professional staff. The food was delicious and the appetizers were large enough to order as entrees. They have a happy hour special where drinks and apps are half off and this deal allowed me to have sangria, grapefruit margarita and an appetizer in under $20, which is unheard of in many establishments. Margarita tasted great and sangria was perfect - not too sweet or artificial-tasting. They have a lot of good items to choose from and prices are reasonable. I will definitely be coming back for another happy hour special. Very excited about discovering this place!
2018-08-02,2,So our recent visit has prompted me to update this review, after 8 years (and more than 16 years of coming to East LA's). We hardly ever come during happy hour but we were in neighborhood. As we're seated we're told that during happy hour whatever we order will have 18% gratuity added to it, I say "Sure, no problem!". Maybe people like to get wasted on margs and leave bad tips, who knows. We always tip 20% as a baseline, more if we like the place (and we loved east LA's), so it's no big. Happy hour ends, we order food and more drinks. After getting the bill, we see that not only did they add the 18% gratuity to the ENTIRE bill but the waitress had the nerve to draw a smiley face, "thank you!", and arrow pointing to the blank tip area. Let me get this straight. I don't know if this is some scam where you hope people drunk from happy hour won't notice that you 1) added gratuity for a bill for 2 people past the amount you originally stated or 2) you expected me to tip, not only on the bill, but the bill + tip. Essentially, your waitress asked me to tip FORTYFIVE percent.  Like I said, we tip 20-25 usually, I had no problem with that and had the 18% not been added to the entire bill, you probably would have gotten a bigger tip, 18% on the HH drinks, 20-25% on the actual meal + drinks. But the fact that you thought I was idiot enough to tip on the tip left a horrible taste in my mouth that had me thinking about for days afterwards. tl;dr: bill was $75 for two people, gratuity was added to bring it to $90 and then I was asked to tip on the $90.
2018-08-01,2,This place is a mess. You're stuffed into a small table and the servers have to squeeze their way around to get to other guests. Only good on Tuesdays when they have a $2 taco deal and you could drink your sorrows away with their margaritas
2018-07-30,2,The only good thing here is the chips and salsa. Food here is really the worst!! I remember saying chipotle has better burrito. I do like their frozen margarita, i would give them 4 stars but they use the lowest quality alcohol and that made both my husband and i felt bad headache.  The out door seating is also so uncomfortable, they made you seat on a tiny chair with a tinny table on a little hill, just didn't enjoy the experience at all.
2018-07-25,5,Best thing about this place is the Margarita and the salsa. I cant get enough of their salsa. I've had several things from their menu and I enjoy the chicken quesadilla, the shrimp taco salad and the crunchy chicken wings.
2018-07-24,5,Food service and drinks were great. I can't complain. They even played good music. I was dancing in my seat.
2018-07-18,1,Food was decent within standard-but-not-amazing Tex-Mex parameters, but our waitress was evil. All I wanted was to order bean tacos--substituting beans in place of the various meat options--yet our waitress named Silvia wouldn't let me. She said absolutely no substitutes. So, I was able to order bean enchiladas, but not bean tacos. Absolutely absurd and made no sense whatsoever. Had I not been with someone new I was seeing, I would have escalated the situation and asked to speak to management, but I didn't want to make this poor girl I was with cringe any more than she already had been. Real disappointing experience that this waitress was such a See You Next Tuesday about things. I still tipped 20% because the rest of the waitstaff was very friendly, but I'll never go back solely because of Silvia, and I guarantee I'm not the first diner she has alienated. She also never came back to our table after our food arrived. Real poor performance, Silvia. In addition, the margaritas were all sugary mixer and hardly any alcohol; it was blatantly obvious. Insanely sweet with hardly any tequila. Also, the acoustics are atrocious, with the noise definitely at an annoying, distracting, and uncomfortable level, which is saying a lot from me, because I don't mind clubs or concerts. Awful ambiance and a super mean waitress ruined decent grub. Also, if you're vegetarian, the rice is cooked in chicken broth. Just an FYI slash PSA.
2018-07-17,3,East LA Is a fun place to go for a night out dinner on Washington Street in Hoboken in terms of atmosphere and vibes. There is a very large margarita selection of different flavors. Watch out, the margaritas are definitely very strong. They do put chips and salsa on the table which is always a nice snack before a meal. I usually order the fajita platter and the food quality in general has been okay. It is still a place I go for dinner from time to time.
2018-07-04,5,This was the best restaurant experience we ever had!   The food, drinks staff and the energy was awesome.  From the beginning with the security guard letting us in until we left we were treated like a king and queen. A must go restaurant and one of the best we've ever been to.
2018-07-02,5,I met my gf here 12 yrs ago and the frozen margaritas are still delicious! Only have 2 Bc by the third one, you're in deep doodoo. I always loved the chips and salsa! Keeps me filled up as I drink my frozen margaritas. Can't say much about the food...lil! I never get passed the bar stool.
2018-06-28,1,Would really like to give a good review but management is terrible. They consistently put staff in awkward positions with customers due to a bizarre seating policy which makes little or no sense outside of lunch or dinner rush, (even then we've had nights fighting with the inept manager and hostess seating people normally. To give an idea I once ordered Hot wings from the manager who was helping expedite tables and this guy brought me hot water.
2018-06-24,2,Prepare to be deceived, as frightening as it may be you might be better off eating at a Chevys. The two stars belong to our waiter for her terrific service, However be prepared to be disappointed. The presentation seemed as if a mere ounce of thought was applied, quality is several under Par, and frankly BLAND. Cocktails were not good. Spare yourself the ridiculous trek, to endless search for parking, and (mostly American) bad Mexican. Definitely not recommending it.
2018-06-16,1,Let me start off by saying the waitress was HORRIBLE! I was with a group of 3 people and we wanted a large booth to sit in. She argued with us saying it was for parties 5 or more mind you the place was EMPTY! This to me was unacceptable as I am coming to this restaurant to Spend my money. Very disappointing and disrespectful service. I even asked to speak to the manager and the women was not accommodating. Will not be returning!!
2018-06-09,1,Went here for a quick dinner, food started out great until my enchiladas had a GIANT centipede bug in them that was clearly cooked and drenched in enchilada sauce...needless to say my entire table of 6 lost their appetite, the manager was very apologetic and comped the entire meal but needless to say I will never be eating here again !
2018-06-08,2,Where do I start with this place. First this establishment could really use a good duster! There's dust on light fixtures and in counters of the booths. Me and my sister and cousins waited 45 minutes before anyone took our order and then another group sat next to us got served right away and their food came out while we were still waiting and we were there much longer! Once the drinks came they were pretty ok. We all had frozen Margaritas. Now the food....very underwhelming and we all had shrimp in our dishes and the shrimp were very salty!! I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or this is typically the food and service situation but I don't think I will be coming back to find out.
2018-06-01,1,One of the worst experiences I've ever had eating out. Our "waitress" Silvia was rude and even raised her voice after making a mistake with our order. She continued to fight with the table instead of acknowledging her mistake and doing her job. All other staff was completely unhelpful and barely visited our table. The food was completely unseasoned as well, will not be coming here ever again.
2018-05-27,3,The food was good the quesadilla was bomb until 2 cockroaches crawled all over it. My friends and I were beyond disgusted. They comped 2 plates which was nice of them.
2018-05-27,2,Ok so I love to try new places and i don't like to judge too much on ratings until I review them myself! My boyfriend wasn't to thrilled to comeHere but I was really craving Mexican food! This spot was the only place in walking distance that had a bar inside the restaurant in Hoboken! I was a party of 3 and the hostess and bouncer were extremely nice to us! Our waitress was super fast at coming to our table to greet us and take at least our drink order! So I was impressed! We were very impressed with the prices of the drinks here too. Very reasonable for Hoboken, like top shelf drinks for under $10! PERFECT! We ordered our food the waitress was attentive giving us information on our food! BUT once we ordered she never came back to see if we needed anything else, how was your meal, Can I refill your drinks or water, or even as simple as providing us with more napkins! My boyfriend and I shared a napkin and when I tried to ask no one would pay us mind! So we were like that's ok it's just napkins! I had the nachos which I thought were good! My friend ordered tacos which he did not like he said it tasted dry and no flavor! That's an important statement especially being a Mexican restaurant! When we received our utensils the knife my boyfriend had was dirty and when I asked for a new one the guy who set up our table had a nasty look on his face like I just annoyed him with my question! But I'm not finished! We are enjoying our drinks and the waiter or bus boy not sure who he was cleaned the table next to us stuff he did it in such a rush that the knife flew fromHis plate and hit my friend in the arm! They quickly apologized and ran off! That's when we started to realize why this place was 3 stars! Then waiting for our waitress to refill our drinks I'm looking around and this place was so DIRTY!!!! Like PILES OF DUST EVERYWHERE!! The lamp had clumps of dust growing, the table we were sitting next to had dust everywhere! I took a picture to show you all how gross this was so you guys don't think I'm just being picky! They had the all the fans on so imagine how much dust bunnies were in all of our food! I was immediately turned off for this place! Then the bartender brings Over the table next to us their drinks and spills it all over the gentleman! I was so annoyed for him but hey he seemed to not mind. After we finish and FINALLY get our check, our waitress doesn't even say thank you have a great day or is there anything else I can get you? NOTHING! I honestly feel like our waitress saw a bunch of younger looking people mind you I'm 26 my friend is 25 and my boyfriend is 30 so we aren't that young but anyways once she saw us she didn't really care to follow up! Maybe she thought we weren't going to tip well I'm not sure this is just me assuming! We get our check and she charged us $3.00 for ICE!!!! My boyfriend ordered 1800 on the rocks and Don Julio on the rocks! Surprised that the price like I stated earlier of these top shelf liquor was so cheap he ordered them the way he always does! SHE NEVER SPOKE TO US ABOUT THE UP CHARGE FOR ICE! Like a dollar per ice really! In total she charged us $6.00, $3.00 per drink. I said oh no this is the last straw! I spoke to the manager who apologized repeatedly and was so so so very kind and understanding! He apologized multiple times and quickly deducted the extra charge for the "ICE". I apologized as well because I don't like to be that person thatComplains but when I see you are over charging without your customers consent or knowledge of this before hand, I am going to make Sure someone knows about it! So others will not go Through the same situation! He then stated that he has been having multiple issues with that server and he apologizes for her actions! My question is why still have her around if you've had multiple complaints? But that is not my place to assume! In conclusion I woke up the next day feeling like complete crap! My stomach had been hurting all night! I've been in and out of the bathroom! I would not recommend going there for the food! Drinks are cheap just triple check your receipts for over charges! I hope This review informa everyone to be cautious of your receipts! ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS triple check what your server is charging you!
2018-05-26,5,Been here quite a few times and we keep on going back because We love this place. Best margaritas around and it's now margarita season !
2018-05-24,4,Food really isn't great, there are a few things that are ok that I usually get! The thing that I love about this place is the drinks! They have a great mango margarita! You can get just about any flavor too!
2018-05-19,3,It's a reasonable good place. It's nice of them giving tacos wit salsa for appetitizer. I ordered vegetarian tortillas which tasted good, but only little vegetables were in it.
2018-05-10,4,Great happy hour food and you can't beat the drink prices.  We are early but I great by night fall this spot is popping.
2018-05-08,2,Wasn't thrilled no one liked the food the tacos are terrible I will never come back margheritas suck never again terrible quality in food
2018-05-07,4,We came here for Cinco De Mayo. It was very busy but the service was very helpful and kept things moving at a reasonable pace in an organized fashion. We sat outside, which was nice, so I really don't know what it's like on the inside. Food was solid, pretty tasty but not spectacular. The star of the show was the jalapeno margarita, which was great. They had ice cold  Pacifico in bottles, which hit the spot. Plenty of salsa and chips to nibble on while you wait for your main course. I had a combo of taco, burrito and enchilada, with rice and beans, which was solid. Prices seemed reasonable. For three of us, with drinks and a shared appetizer, the bill came in at just under $100, including the tip.
2018-05-06,1,i went to East LA on cinco de mayo for lunch in search of 2 things...quesadilla and a virgin margarita.  The waiter questioned me on how to make a virgin margarita and they way he did it made me feel like I was crazy for even asking for such a thing.   I  would think that I am not the first pregnant woman to ask for one.  Maybe the bartender and waiter could use google to learn how to make one.  Needless to say, I left.
2018-04-27,4,I love it here for drinks and food. My boyfriend loves this place. I would say it's not the BEST, but I have it a 4/5 because it's really good spot to drink and get Mexican food. I recommend.
2018-04-22,3,Although the food is okay & I the drinks are strong. However, owners really need to evaluate who works when it's busy. The bus boy aggressively threw our chips & salsa on the table, didn't look at any of us & kind of seemed out of sorts. One of the bartenders (Jeff to be exact) spilled a whole cup of water on my friend & didn't even say sorry. Just seemed "too busy to bother."
2018-04-18,5,My husband and I have a newborn baby and we were looking for an evening out - appetizers and a drink! Drove around Hoboken and came across East LA! The second we walked in we knew we came to the right place! Music was great and it was pretty packed. Our waitress knew we had a newborn and sat us in the back - great space for us and the baby. She told us about the happy hour specials - which were awesome by the way. We ordered 2 flavored margaritas and some appetizers. Our waitress was awesome and the service was great. Everything came out quickly and tasted great. My husband and I - both said we have found a new spot! We will definitely be coming back!
2018-03-27,4,If you are coming here for really authentic Mexican or Tex mex food you will probably be sorely disappointed. This place really specializes in providing tasty non authentic food to soak up all of the alcohol you WILL drink here. That being said, this place gets 4 stars because it is a really fun place to go to happy hour or to get drinks with friends. The food is tasty and reasonably priced for just snacking with friends. Their happy hour special with half priced apps and margaritas makes this a really great place for hanging out. The margs are pretty strong and some flavors are better than others but you can tell by taste that the point of these drinks is for alcohol content not quality of ingredients
2018-03-20,4,I tried their famous margarita and tacos. Margarita is great but tacos are okay. Too much ice in frozen margarita and it became hard to drink. The restaurant itself is not very clean. Probably will only come for their happy hour for margarita next time.
2018-03-01,5,Glad we still have this place in town. AMAZING place to unwind and network. And their frozen drinks YUMMY!
2018-02-17,1,Just awful. Terrible service. Terrible food. Way overpriced. Place is dirty. A cockroach crawled across our table and there were fruit flies in the air. Ugh. We went for lunch and a crappy taco (single) with tiny sides of refried beans, rice, corn, and salad was $10. Crappy house marg was $9. Will not go back. Do not recommend.
2018-01-23,3,Their drinks and happy hour is great! I came here on a Friday right during the last hour of happy hour. The drinks are strong but also tasty. Prices were competitive and there's a lot of flavors to choose from if you're getting a Margarita. The place is quite small so it gets packed really quick. The food was just ok though. I ordered the enchiladas, queso, an appetizer platter, and cheese quesadillas. Queso was kind of gritty. Enchiladas ok. I liked the appetizer platter a lot due to it being half-pricd for happy hour. It was weird that an 18% tip was automatically included even though I only had a party of two. I think this is enforced during happy hour but I could be wrong. I like and dislike this. It's good as far as ensuring servers are being compensated but was also weird being forced to tip. My server was great so this wasn't really an issue. I'd definitely recommend this place.
2018-01-21,5,Love this place! Great food & drinks. Always receive the best service!
2018-01-19,4,Yummy food and margaritas! I came with my friend on a Friday. It wasn't as busy so we got seats asap. The service was a little slow, but we still had a great time. I got the Chambord Margarita and it was good good good! I also got seafood here, and it was also good. I love the interior, but it does feel a little too crowded. I could hear the conversation of the guests next to me. Overall, it was a nice casual dinner. Might not come back anytime soon for dinner, but definitely for the margaritas.
2018-01-04,5,We ordered to go with special requests.  Everything was just as we ordered.  We prepaid, so my son was able to run inside while I waited in car since parking is tough on Washington.  They clearly know how to pack to go orders.  We had everything we needed, including a few extras. I wish they delivered to Bayonne!
2017-12-24,3,(Smh, forgot to take pics)However, east LA is just ok. Not the worst mexican food I've had but it definitely isn't the best. Took me a minute to get here bc its always packed. I'd have to say the crowds are primarily because of the frozen margaritas that you get a 3 per person limit. They're pretty strong, gotta give it to them and if you're into alcohol infused slushies essentially... you'll like em too.Service was fine. Decent paced, our waiter was cool. One of the waitresses spilled food on one of my friends and acted like it didnt happen lol, no sorry, no offer to get napkins etc so idk, I'd probably come back if I was in the mood, but definitely not when there's a line out the door.
2017-11-19,4,I have one word. MARGARITAS! This is my go to spot for a drink out on a Friday night. Their frozen margaritas are truly the best. I loved the pomegranate flavor which was a recent discovery for me. I normally don't go for the pitchers because I like to order a different kind every time seeing as how they have a long list of flavors on the menu. To be honest, I'm all about the drinks when I come here, but I've tried the chimichangas and flauticas. The flauticas were good, skinny flautas cut in halves. It came with a side of three sauces that I could do without. The chimichanga was also flavorful, you can choose chicken or beef. It's basically a deep fried burrito. They also start you off with complimentary chips and salsa. The atmosphere here is super casual and it's a little on the smaller side even for hoboken, but service is friendly and fast. It's the perfect spot to come and unwind after a long work week.
2017-09-26,4,The food here is delicious, and the frozen margarita pitchers are well worth the money.
2017-09-01,1,I waited 45 minutes for my food because our waiter didn't hit send for our order. and the food wasn't even that good . Their drinks are good though.
2017-08-15,4,I have to recognize that food was yummy, but seriously service is slow. However we had a great lunch and prices are reasonable.
2017-08-12,2,I don't like to judge places based on reviews so I decided to give this place a chance. Moral of the story always listen to reviews ! They have nice out door seating which is a plus. But they made my dog stay on the other side of the fence. Poor pup.They bought him water which was nice The prices aren't terrible.I got the combo veggie taco and veggie burrito 13 dollars. The waiter asked if I was vegetarian and told me the rice was made with meat broth. that was nice he was aware of that! My boyfriend got some sort of meat tacos. The wait was long for the food. It about 30 minutes. Which is pretty crazy. It's tacos and burritos... For drinks I got the mango frozen margarita. I felt like it tasted odd. Different from usual margaritas I get. I consider myself a margarita expert... sort of..  Not like it was strong it just weird tasting. Was not a fan.The food was so average it's not even funny. For a 30 + minute wait you would think it would be spectacular or something.Mine was literally grilled veggies in a wrap with some cheese. Mind blown. My boyfriend did not enjoy his either.  I'll probably have to get different food after this because well... I'm still starving. Perhaps they need to fix this efficiency and food quality.  47 dollars for a long wait and food/drink we hated... oyyAlways listen to yelp reviews!!Spare yourselves.
2017-08-03,4,Omg the drinks here are amazing! My friends and I were super hot so we wondered into this place. We sat at the bar and ordered all types of different margaritas, there were only $9, which is a great price. They had flavors like sangria, lime, patron and more. The place is cute and I would definitely go on a date here. The food however took a long time, I figured it was because we sat at the bar. This is a hidden gem in Hoboken and I'm sure it probably gets super packed on Thursday- Saturday. If you want to relax more, I would come back on a sunny Sunday. Honestly after two of these drinks you will start to feel awesome. There is outdoor sitting but it's limited. This is a must try! I would go back for sure.
2017-07-26,5,I starting eating at East LA 25 years ago and it's still delicious! We stopped in after dropping our son at Stevens Tech and the chimichanga brought be back to 1992. Best authentic Mexican food!!! Try some sangria next time you're in Hoboken.
2017-07-24,3,My husband craves the chips and salsa here. Drinks are very good. Do try the enchiladas.
2017-07-19,3,I had the Carnitas tacos. They provided a side lime sauce if I'm not mistaken, which wasn't too bad. Comes with a side of rice, corn and beans. It was good just wasn't delivered as quickly as the first visit I had. I think maybe they were short staffed when I went the second time. This time I tried a shrimp taco which was just a bunch of tiny frozen shrimp in a hard taco shell with cheese. The shrimp may have been tossed in a garlic butter. Still eh. It's an average Mexican place. If you want something better I'd go to the Charritos up or downtown. Cuban - I'd recommend La Isla.
2017-07-17,3,This is a pretty decent spot for happy hour either after work or before heading out to some other bars in the area. Happy hour specials are really good - $6 margaritas, half off apps, and some beer specials. Margs are pretty tasty and super strong, you can definitely taste the liquor so you are getting your money's worth. The food is eh - nothing spectacular and wouldn't come here just for food but it gets the job done while drinking. The bar itself is kind of small and while waiting at the bar it can seem like it's taking a while for a drink. I'd recommend sitting at a table - waiters are all really friendly and attentive!
2017-07-16,2,I wish this place would get rid of their no hats policy. It's so dumb. Makes me never want to go back. It's not even a 5 star restaurant, so why u telling people what to wear. So ridiculous. Oh yeah the food is just ok and I was ok with the drinks. But they set the mood off wrong with me when they told me that my outfit (hat) had to come off. CHANGE THAT STUPID NO HAT POLICY. Don't tell people what to wear that's rude. And could be seen as a form of prejudice. Just saying.
2017-07-16,1,If I could give it a zero rating I would. Went here with my family.  There is no organization and huge lack of communication between servers and the host. Might I add she was the only pleasant one. (Kristen I think her name was) We sat to eat and waited 15 minutes to even have our server come over. She took our drink orders and they were mediocre at best. One drink was sent back due to no alcohol in it and she tried to tell us they don't exchange drinks. Ordered our food and waited close to an hour. Not mention I had 2 children who ordered a CHEESE QUESADILLA. how long does it take to put two tortillas together with cheese?! Our order was wrong and sent back once. Came back wrong again. At this point we were starving and just ate.  The manager didn't seem to care. Claimed his hands were tied. Needless to say we won't be back.
2017-07-06,2,Wasn't expecting much after reading the reviews, so we knew what to expect.   Ordered chicken flautas, which were almost inedible.  The chicken was overcooked and tough, and to add insult to injury, the flautas were served cold with congealed cheese smeared on them.  An order of guacamole yielded the same result.  It's hard to mess up guacamole unless you dump heaps of jalapenÃÉo on it, making it inedible.   Had a couple of beers so I can't speak for their drinks.  Not coming back.
2017-07-01,5,I would like to thank MARGARETT for a great experience !!! Great service is HIGHLY appreciated!!!!!
2017-06-18,2,The food here was not so great the drinks, not so great the servers were very nice but I'm not sure I'll be running back the next time I'm in the area I wouldn't say don't go but it's a great place to hang out maybe have some nachos and a beer but I didn't love my sangria and a friend of mine got another mixed drink that wasn't so wonderful
2017-05-27,2,Been here twice before and I always seem to give it another try to see if they were "just having a bad day" Last night didn't seem to be any different than pervious visits, probably worse. I had a burger and it was super salty, and I'm one who is not light on salt per say. The hostess was the rudest person and would not work with the party of about 8 I was attending with. She had an attitude and was questioning if we were going to eat. The only reason I'm giving it a two stars is because of their margaritas, other than that there are a ton of other good places in Hoboken, will not be going back.
2017-05-18,5,Load, Hip place in Hoboken. Love this place. Could come back every day. Great Margaritas, great happy hour, great tacos.
2017-05-09,4,This place is pretty good there if you come try there margaritas very good and strong problably drink just a few beacuse it will it you hard at some point i order some supreme nachos from gere which were amazing and they serve me sooo much was so good only problem i have is that they rush you on sundays becuase is so packed. Other then that is amazing try it you will enjoy
2017-05-07,5,Great food and great MargaritasI have been coming here for over 10 years. I mean what can I say that the other reviews don't say already. I would like to say to some people who do give this place 1 star because of thier "loud music" and "over crowdedness" (idk if thats even a word but Eff it)1. If you walk in and the place is too loud for your taste why not just turn around and go else where? I mean it's common sense isn't it. 2. If the place is too crowded and u hate crowded places. Why torture yourself and ask for a seat. Once again common sense. 3. If the place is "not fancy" not "anything special" why not turn around and go to The W if you want fancy. Once again common sense 4. If you are complaining about 9 dollar margaritas why not stay home buy a blender and have your self a good night. Like I stated before I have been coming here for over 10. I have no affiliation with east la what so ever. The food is great thier service is ok, but what can u expect when a place is as busy as it is. Through out the years they have made minor improvements here and there. Which is always a good thingI guess thier motto is if ain't broken don't fix it. Keep up the good work guys.
2017-04-29,1,I just came from there and it was good at first until I saw a HUGE WATERBUG crawl from behind my friends back. The manager came over very rude and didn't even offer us a discount or nothing he just rushed and got us the bill and made sure we got out of there. DISGUSTING!
2017-04-29,1,I was seated outside on a tiny table that couldn't fit all 3 plates that came with my chicken fajita. The table was on a slant and water spilled twice. Place was crowded and food felt like it was rushed. Server was doing his best conditions permitting.
2017-04-23,1,. The drinks are great. Customer service on the other hand, terrible. I waited over an hour for food, it never came out. We had to wave our waiters down 4 times just to place an order. Didn't know who our waiter was, 4 people came up to take different orders, left and never came back. We asked to get our glasses changed and they made it a huge deal. Never coming back again.
2017-04-19,2,2.5 stars for what I would consider a landmark in Hoboken.  If you grew up here like I did everyone has gone to East LA for food but mostly for their drinks.  I've never been a fan of their food but drinks I was ok with for some time.  Frozen margaritas is what they're known for and probably will always be known for.When walking in don't expect anything nice to jump out at you.  It's usually chaos with servers running around collecting empty glasses and a tight space of people standing or waiting for a table.  $9 for a frozen margarita.  They offer different flavors (apple, strawberry, sangria, pineapple, etc.) and are all served in tall glasses.  I'll be honest and say once upon a time I used to love these drinks.  I guess it was the feeling of being newly legal and having a drink in Hoboken.  After my first sip all I was thinking was $9 for this?  The tequila tasted cheap and it was extremely sugary.  When you drink 1 or 2 of these you're setting yourself up for a major headache.The next time I return to East LA will be if I'm invited for a special occasion (which was the case).  Other then that on a personal level I'm leaving East LA in the past.
2017-04-18,1,Never EVER again. My friend advised the manager of a roach she saw crawling up the margarita machine. He grabbed it with his hand and walked away as if it were nothing. When my friends tried to pay their check they found out everyone was put on their bill. He made a face as if to state he couldn't split it and walked over to close the check. I said excuse me and called him five times. He pretended to not hear me then turned around asking why I was yelling at him. He said he couldn't split it, or void it, but we could circle our items and pay with different payments. Completely rude and unprofessional. Dirty and disgusting. Never again.  If I could give zero stars I would.
2017-04-15,1,If you enjoy tasteless, canned food and ridiculously loud dining area, this is your place. With how dirty the menus and tables are, one can only assume how dirty the kitchen is. Avoid this place like the plague, or you just might get the plague....I feel like I'm going to get food poisoning.
2017-04-15,1,Extremely loud place to eat what I can only describe as edible garbage. Food was tasteless and low quality.  Sticky gross menus, I dread to think how unclean the kitchen is.  We could barely hear one another over people yelling and screaming on a mid Saturday afternoon
2017-04-12,2,So my friends rave about this places and heir amazing margaritas so yesterday they decided to take me. We got there at 6pm got a table right away even though it was a bit busy. We ordered a large pitcher of coconut margarita, appetizers and 3 dinners. We waited for the pitcher for over 30 minutes which is ridiculous. The margarita was great however no taste of coconut at all. After we got the pitcher took another 20 min for the appetizer. The appetizer that we ordered was missing one dish which they didn't mention  when arrived which we had to advise we missing a dish.  they didn't have anymore therefore have an additional dish. Again the dinner came about 20 min after the appetizers. I have to say the food wasn't as good as I would hoped seemed they lack of salt and pepper. The table next to us who had a baby waiting for their food longer then we had and they were really upset. However other tables seemed to get their food pretty quick. I believe it was just the waiter as he seemed to be all over the place. But no one should wait over 30 min for drinks and appetizers.
2017-04-09,2,I have been here several times ... mostly for their broccoli and cheese poppers and their margaritas but their service is HORRIBLE!! Every time i come here there is a problem with the service and/or the customers around me have a problem. They either need better servers or more servers working on busy days. I came here today with my friend and they sat us in a very tight space and about 20 minutes after ordering our food, the waitress lets me know that they don't have poppers so I told her we would order another appetizer so we would need a few more minutes. Our food came about 15-20 minutes with another waiter but our waitress never came back for our appetizer. The chicken flautas were bland and dry. I couldn't finish it. The people next to us sent back the lot chicken tortilla salads because by the time they got them they were so cold. My advice is to come here just for the margaritas because the service and the food quality is below average.
2017-03-28,4,East LA definitely has a fun and loud atmosphere if you want to meet up with friends over drinks, however, this is NOT the place to visit for a low key quiet dinner. On a Sunday evening, the place was not busy, yet the service was not great, we had to wait an hour for our entrees with no explanation. When the food did arrive, it was delicious.
2017-03-19,1,Food was very bland.  Not tasty at all.  Service was horrible!  Place was not busy and it took forever to get our food.  Waitress never even bothered to ask if we wanted refills!  Big disappointment!!!!
2017-02-19,4,My girlfriend and I were strolling on Washington Street looking for a good spot to have lunch and decided to stop in here. We read some reviews on Yelp while waiting for a table and saw it was hot and cold. We decided to stay and enjoy delicious  (strong) coconut margaritas and enchiladas with complimentary chips and salsa for the table. We would definitely come back when we are in town.
2017-01-15,1,When you walk in with a $25 gift certificate meant to redeem your last 0 star experience you're not expecting much. My girlfriend and I have worked in the industry many years. We appreciate good food and respect the hell out of good service. These are two things that are lacking here. In a dangerously unsanitary  situation like we had experienced; (layers of dust everywhere, water and ice pitchers lying in the middle of the room for various people to scoop with their bare hands) .. It falls on the manager to instruct staff to provide at the least utencils. When we hand in our gift certificate after wasting our full bellies on chewy chunks of avocados and half a bottle of salt necessary to wash down our tacos, we wondered how will the waitress be able to discount our meal with no manager to assist her...  Much to our surprise there was a manager conveniently sitting at the bar watching the game as if he's home in his basement with his Bros. This place is not only eligible for the next episode of Bar Rescue... But needs to be shut down before someone gets sick. PS.. PLEASE fix that screaming margarita machine that must be broken for months.   Literally louder than the game on TV.
2017-01-01,1,This place is an absolute joke. My group of three came in at 6:30 for dinner and drink on Friday night. The music was insanely loud, as if the 10 o'clock party crowd was ready to rage. If I have to scream to my friends just to talk this early at night, your music is too loud. Nevertheless, we ordered three patron margaritas, one lime margarita, two apps, and three entrees. My meal came out ten minutes later then my companions, due to the waiter rushing past my table without so much as a glance. It was busy, but not so busy where we should have been overlooked. When the bill came, we submitted $75 in gift certificates. When we got the bill, our total was $20 more then it should have been, due to a "service charge" added at the end. When we asked the waiter what it was for, he said the appetizers we had ordered, "guacamole and wings", were part of the happy hour special so there was an automatic service fee added... When we asked again why that was added since it was not stated on the menu, he had no answer. Additionally, when I reviewed the bill, it said there were four of us instead of three.I'm not sure why this service charge was automatically added to our bill, especially since this was not expressed to us. On their website, it states on their menu 18% gratuity is added to parties of 6 or more.. We were a party of three. I would have tipped 20%, despite the awful service, had I been given the choice. Completely unacceptable!
2016-12-29,4,A group of 4 and I went on a Tuesday evening and we're very happy with our meals and service. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Tuesday's special was two for one entrees and it included anything on the menu. We even got appetizers two for one. The bill was still pricey because we were drinking margaritas and beer, but it was nice that our entrees were discounted. The meal portions were huge we ended up all taking stuff home with us for lunch the next day. Looking forward to going back.
2016-12-14,4,My go-to mexican restaurant in Hobokenn (and I'm used to authentic mexican since living on the west coast). Great food and drinks (consistently), nice large menu. This is a simple place, not fancy but fun. I always get the burritos atrevidos--it's huge and delicious! Their nachos are great too although I recommend you eat them at the restaurant, not for take out. Most people love the margaritas here but as someone that doesn't get them--this place is still worth a stop!
2016-11-27,2,As a huge fan of Mexican food this place was a definite miss! I can't even vouch for the "good margaritas" everyone else seems to have enjoyed because I've had way better margaritas. The drinks actually tasted as if they were regular margaritas and whatever flavor you wanted was just poured on top rather than mixed in making the drink an overall mess after one sip. Now, the food? VERY MEDIOCRE in my opinion. Again, as a big fan of anything Mexican related this place was a real let down.
2016-11-15,1,First off they wouldn't allow me to wear my hat (why)? This isn't a cute place or Manhattan. Second. They literally serve friskys food was so gross. Third. Our "server" was so rude . No greeting or anything just a "you ready to order". No interaction whatsoever. When it came time for the check she was no where to be found, I eventually got up and found her texting in a booth in the front of the restaurant. Honestly thank god it was Tuesday and meals were buy one get one free. Oh and forgot to mention she charged  us 18% gratuity for two people?! Save your money Churritos is so much better.
2016-10-30,1,Only people that have never tasted a real margarita or real guacamole can like this place. When a Mexican place serves store bough guac and your margarita (on the rocks) has the same color of soda water you know you have been scammed. Horrific experience. Never again.
2016-10-26,4,I plan on coming back here to try some of the food. The margaritas are crazy good, very strong! Definitely worth trying out, they close pretty early but there are enough spots in the area to go to after. It was really packed when I went on a Saturday night. Cool and laid back atmosphere. Cant wait to go back!
2016-10-05,2,It's exciting that this place has like a huge selection of frozen margarita flavors,  but the food here leaves a little something to be desired. Came in here with a few friends for lunch after a long night of drinking and we were excited to get some filling mexican food! We were a little disappointed. The quesadillas were a little bit burnt and not filled properly so they fell apart. The meat in the burrito had bones in it. The nachos were underwhelming. The decor is a little cheesy, but the place is spacious with booths and a big bar. We had to wait a little bit to be served, and it wasn't busy, so that's a few points off too. Not great, but I would be willing to give this place another shot.
2016-09-28,2,I stopped in for lunch with a co-worker since we were in the area.  The place was empty except for one table outside which was surprising because it's Hoboken during prime lunch time.  Definitely more of a bar feel than a restaurant.  They place chips and salsa down at the table while you review the menu.  That's always a nice touch.  The chips were bland and the salsa was ok.  I love salt on my chips but I couldn't taste any.  I had the chicken burrito which came with refried beans and rice.  My co-worker had the chicken tostado.  The burrito was fat but small.  I've definitely had bigger ones at the chains.  The rice and bean portion was on the small side as well.   Overall, disappointed.  The burrito didn't have much taste.  Decent amount of chicken.The service was not friendly and barely ok.  Although the place was empty, we felt like we were an inconvenience to the waitress.  She sat down a few booths away talking to a woman.  We never got the obligatory "how is everything."  If we had, I might have wanted another soft drink.  The waitress was distracted and didn't really care for her only table.  The prices were respectable considering it's Hoboken.  I must add the bathroom was a bit dirty and could use a remodeling job.   I wish I had gone to the chain Mexican restaurant a couple blocks away.
2016-08-26,5,The sweet potato fries were out of this world! My friend and I went there for dinner last week and we enjoyed every minute of it! Another thing that I loved is the staff. They're very welcoming and so helpful. The margaritas were DELICIOUS!
2016-08-21,3,The margarita was really strong. They didn't really added the flavor for the juice part . the waitress was not really paying attention. It was an okay place, food was a bit cold rice & beans the only good thing was the steak was well well done just like I ask. that's probably it
2016-07-29,1,Beware to all who order from this place, they don't even deserve one star. I am not big at writing reviews, but I feel I need to warm everyone of this place. I wish I read some seamless reviews before I ordered. EAST LA Should be ashamed of themselves. The worst service I have experienced in awhile. My order never arrived, so I called to inquire, when I finally got a hold of the manager he had no idea what was going on and was extremely rude. he provided no assistance or solution. He would not even cancel my order, which I then had to get seamless involved. The Seamless Rep, not only agreed but began to laugh after her call with the manager at how much of a joke he was.  Shame on East LA, all I wanted was a taco for dinner, had to settle for a burger!
2016-07-18,3,I'm giving this place 3 stars solely based on the fact that the drinks are amazing and the food is good. However, there is so much to be desired as far as customer service goes. Wait staff is so inattentive and super slow getting around to you. There are no smiling faces, no making sure you're needs are met and honestly no real effort overall.
2016-07-05,4,Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Ordered cheese enchiladas and it was delicious. My friends had order a pitcher of the frozen margarita and you def get what you paid for.  Enough for 4 people. Only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it was extremely crowded and the two tables next to us were extremely close to our table and loud. But guess that will just depend on your luck on who sits next to you during your dinner.
2016-06-27,1,Worst service I have ever had in Hoboken. First they wouldn't let me wear my hat.  Then they forgot our order. Then the waitress was extremely rude when we explained that. Then the "happy hour" discount was not applied. We got terrible service from every single touchpoint in the customer experience. I cannot recommend this place at all. There are so many fantastic restaurants in Hoboken right next to it and I will never ever go to this crap againPs apparently people who are stabbers like to eat here and that's why I couldn't wear my hat
2016-06-23,4,Little hole in the wall sensation! If you like authentic Mexican food, then this place has your name written all over it!!! Incredible! Definitely recommended and a future stop spot for me!
2016-06-20,1,Myself and My Husband Just Moved Here From Az, to Jersey. We Was Craving Mexican Food. We Came here Because the sign said Mexican food. Far From Real Mexican Food. My Taco Fell apart and the shell came out of a box from A Taco Bell Starter Kit From Walmart!! This is Not Mexican Food. And the service Sucked, our Server Was Slow and not Helpful. Don't waist your money on the Food. The Food Prices is to much considering the way it looked and tasted. Maybe A Margarita and Chips and Salsa You May Be Safe. Yuck
2016-06-19,2,I give two stars strictly because the frozen mango margarita was on point. Aside from the drink everything else was less than average. To start, this place would be perfect for a college town bar. It's loud and reeks of booze and cigarettes. Secondly, the service is horrible. We were seated relatively promptly, however, it took 20 minutes before a server came over and that was after I raised my hand like a grammar school student to get someone's attention. When the server came over he didn't apologize for our wait or introduce himself. He was actually quite rude and abrupt. It was almost like we were inconveniencing him by wanting to place our order. Lastly, the food. Ugh...so disappointed! Chilli's is better if you are looking for tex-mex food. It's saturated with cheese and there is nothing fresh about it. Our server never once came to check to see if everything came out okay and they never brought my sons food. The only time I saw the server after placing our order was when he came back to drop off the check.  All in all, I will not be visiting this establishment again.
2016-06-17,1,This place is the absolute worst. The food was canned, jarred, bottled, soggy, and bland. The clientele are all loud children, puking, screaming, fighting, and all around obnoxious.  I just moved to the area and now I finally understand all of the Bro references. All I wanted was a margarita. I get a frozen children's drink. I ask for a REAL margarita (on the rocks) and I get store bought mix. Atrocious. If you're under 21 and think Chipotle is good food, this place is for you.
2016-06-15,1,I would normally give them 5 stars, but after yesterday's experience with the supposed owner's son, David. I would consider not going back. He was rude & arrogant. I stood there for a table for about 5mins & he then grabs the guests waiting behind us. I asked him why they were sat before us when we have been standing here & he stated , " hi. I'm David I'm the manager here & there's nothing I can do about that!" I was shocked by his response. What happen to customer service? I'm a regular here. I have never seen him before. I took the small dingy table in the back that barely fit 5ppl. Then we waited another 10mins for menus chips n salsa n water. Finally Jeff came by (he's awesome) he took care of us from there. But this David guy should find another calling because the food & beverage industry isn't his place.
2016-06-10,5,Recommended this place from my kickboxing instructed, specifically for the Margarita's . And boy were they spot on! For 9$ price each they are so strong, you will only need 2 to have a pretty heavy buzz.As for the food and service, I still would give 5 star. It was a crowded bar, but our bartender had our drinks in less then a minute. Our server somehow noticed us once we walked in, took down our name and said it was a 15 minute wait for a table. On point, finished our first drink and then we were escorted to our table, with EXCELLENT chips and salsa waiting for us. Me and my girlfriend ordered the steak quesodilla and another drink, the drinks arrived in 2 minutes and the food in about 7. Can not go wrong for about a 60$ bill, 4 GREAT drinks, great service, very good appetizer. Why would you go anywhere else and pay the same?
2016-05-23,2,I've came here probably 3 times since my friends do frequent the place often for their frozen margaritas. Frankly, that's all you should come here for as I do not recommend the food. The food is just not good at all and I love Mexican Food. The salsa tastes like the ones from the tostitos jar you'd buy at a supermarket. The guacamole is a a little slimy and just not fresh. I ordered the quesadillas and it was just a little below average. I would not come back for the food at all. I've never had an issue with service or the staff so I guess that's the only good thing. They also have outdoor seatings during the summer which is also a plus but that's about it.
2016-05-17,2,Visited East LA with some friends. We walked in and were not even noticed by the hostess. A server finally realized we wanted a table. We sat and once again were ignored for a good while. When we got the attention of the server who sat us we asked for some waters while waiting for our server to make his way to our table take our orders. Once our server got to our table he quickly took our orders and left he didn't allow us to give a drink order as he rushed off. The food was alright. Unfortunately I have stopped coming to East LA due to their lack of service and upon returning I see that it has not changed. Management should consider retraining their staff to provide a more pleasant experience.
2016-05-11,3,The Short: Great frozen margaritas. Sub-Par service. Let's start off by saying I never go to a place to with intentions of bashing it in Yelp. I love to give 5 stars and rave about places. I've also been a waiter/ bartender for seven years. This was a date with my lady on Tuesday night around 9:30pmI went in asking for a Hennessy Marg- Sir we need you to take your hat off. Ok cool. Why? It deters families from coming in.... ... Ok cool. Ill take my hat off. Bartender Jeffrey says that they no longer make the Hennessy Margarita. He lets me sample an alternative.  Dope.  He then later shakes hands with a guy wearing a backwards snapback. I guess it's ok for other people to wear hats. It's not even like I was wearing a lame typical "bro" hat. Still kinda salty about it. Lol. He then sat down to eat as he neglected two guys at the end of the bar. The only reason I would ever go back is strictly for frozen margaritas. As an adult straight male I never go out for frozen margaritas.
2016-05-06,2,The frozen margarita's get me every. time. They are so strong. Don't get four in one night. Other than a good happy hour spot, or a place to get a cheap tequila hangover, stopping here isn't probably worth it. The rest of their drinks are watered down, and the food is mediocre. There are better Mexican restaurants in Hoboken.It can get crowded and noisy there, so be prepared for that too.
2016-04-27,3,Great chips and salsa. The restaurant needs to be updated but I love sitting outside. I had the chicken quesadilla which I thought were pretty good.
2016-04-13,3,Food: C+We were walking down the street looking for a place to eat when we stumbled across East LA and smelled something good. After we sat down, we received chips and salsa for the table and put in our orders: the steak fajita and the chicken burrito/beef enchilada combo plate. My steak fajita was great - they weren't stingy with the beef, which I thought they might be, and the food was prepared and seasoned well. I really enjoyed it, and still had half of my plate to spare for lunch the next day. The burrito was alright - sort of small, not sure if that's because it's part of the combo plate. It was better with guac and sour cream, which actually came with the fajita, so if they gave that with the burrito too, that'd have been ideal. The enchilada portion of the combo was pretty disappointing though. It seemed like they used some sort of canned beef, or at least that's what it tasted like. It was crumbly and the texture was...bleck. Neither of us enjoyed that one.Service: B-The waiter who served us was super friendly and chatted with us a bit, which was nice, but we were left waiting sometimes, which was strange because there weren't many diners there the night we went (it was mostly people at the bar). He brought out our waters and chips and salsa pretty quickly, but when it came to our check, we were waiting around for a bit. Not sure if it felt like longer because we were outside and it was cold (we chose to sit outside). Other than that, the food came relatively quickly and the service was alright.Ambiance: CNothing fancy. We sat outside by ourselves at one of the simple wooden table with metal chairs - it was cold out, but we chose to do this since we came from the gym and were enjoying the breeze (in the beginning). This place is right on the main street in Hoboken, so there's lots of foot traffic and passersby - a couple of somewhat obnoxious ones that will interrupt your meal with comments, nothing really rude but depends on whether the interruption bothers you - *shrug.* The inside was a little more lively with more people at the bar, drinking their margaritas and having a good time.
2016-04-12,5,Awesome!!! Great!! There is a reason for their 3 drink limit!! Very strong, Very good! Pricing is really decent. Had a great time with my sister there
2016-03-19,4,This place is meant for margaritas! Must try !!Service : the hostesses are very courteous and service was very friendly and attentive , on a crowded Friday night ! Impressed :) Food : fresh and delicious gauc and salsa . We ordered fajitas and quesadillas and both were great ! Overall a nice hangout place for a Friday - Saturday night with your friends!
2016-03-06,3,I'd give thumbs up for great Margaritas! The food is ok I've had better. The service I'd give two stars but that'll also depend upon the time or day. Great if you want to munch on something and have margaritas with friends.
2016-02-27,5,Best margaritas ever! I definitely would come back for more! The servers are awesome and very polite.
2016-02-22,4,I came here last night, although it was packed we waited at the bar and had some amazing Sangria Margaritas. I have never in my life thought about that combination but it was DELICIOUS. When we were seated they brought out chips and salsa (best salsa i've ever tried)We ordered the Flautas which was a small portion but they were bomb! I'm only giving them 4 stars because the beer we ordered was not cold. But Overall it was a great place.
2016-02-16,5,Awesome time here! Julio helped us out, for a few hours lol and he was so friendly. went above and beyond to cater to us  will definitely be back again!
2016-01-23,4,This place is great! Yeah... Yeah.. It's not authentic, but the food is very good and reasonably priced. There weren't many vegetarian options but they were very happy to accommodate my request when I asked to substitute a bean burrito for a chicken burrito.  I really enjoyed my meal but my fianceÃÅ wasn't overwhelmed by his chicken nachos. They were pretty busy at 6pm on a Friday night but we were greeted and seated right away by a very friendly hostess. Overall, it was a good experience and we'll definitely be back!
2016-01-09,5,This place rocks. Awesome margs and chips and salsa. I could go on but I wont. Just come here but not when I'm here so it's not super packed. #acknowledge is a bonus.
2016-01-07,1,Went here for dinner with my girlfriends, and will never be back. I signed for one amount on the check and realized once I checked my bank account that they charged me double!!! Numerous calls to the "manager" and he tells me to "dispute the charge with your bank." I noticed that this is something other reviewers have complained about, SUPER SHADY!!! STAY AWAY!
2015-12-18,5,Sangria margaritas are a must, and don't pass up a chance to try the beef! Nachos with skirt steak? Um, yes!I take my family here all of the time. A great place for lunch, dinner, or drinks. Awesome service, and of course amazing margaritas.
2015-12-02,1,Worst. Service. Ever. Plus we were auto gratted for just my boyfriend and I. Keep a look out for that, it's super shady.
2015-11-20,4,I have not eaten in the restaurant but I was really impressed by the quality of my takeout order. They also give you a generous serving of chips and salsa with the to-go orders. A good deal for the amount of food!
2015-10-17,5,Amazing food, amazing service. The food wasn't too spicy and the service was attentive and professional. The portions were a perfect size; I felt like the food really hit the spot after we were done, but it didn't make me feel overstuffed.
2015-10-14,4,East L.A Mexican restaurant scored well by me for many reasons. First and foremost was the exceptional teamwork this staff had. It was a Tuesday night at 6:30 and though not packed, seemed to be a sence of urgency and rushing around. I don't know if they just finished a rush, but everyone was helping everyone. I stepped in never having been here before. Last Mexican restaurant I tried was Charritto's on the far side of town.Here the hostess was a little distracted applying her make up, so the bartender/maybe manager/maybe owner rushed around the bar to quickly seat me. This gentleman alone was hands on with everything and everybody. Talking to the bar patrons, running to the outside dining area, back to me. I was wiped out from watching him run everywhere.I ordered and suggest anyone that comes here to try their two burritos atrevid dish. It's a dish with one burrito with shredded chicken and one with bean and cheese. It comes with a "dollop" of sour cream. It was easily a large ice cream scoop size, and believe me I'm not complaining. They brought out the traditional chip and salsa and this is what can make our break it for me. If it's house made or Pace. It definitely seemed to be house made with fresh chopped cilantro and house baked chips. Not spicy so it's a perfect table salsa and comes in a large enough ramekin to actually get the whole chip in.I enjoyed a Dos Equis which at $6 is a little pricey, but not outrageous. They have frozen Margaritas which are in yogurt dispensing machines, a disappointment to me usually but I understand if it's due to volume of sales. I'll post a copy of the check date 10/13/15The burritos arrived via the hostess and were of fairly good size, so much that I couldn't eat the bean and cheese burrito (which was today's lunch and was fine reheated). Standard side of rice and beans that comes with corn and melted cheese and a simple salad with fresh chopped jalapenos. The Verde sauce was good, not too much that you couldn't taste the burrito. The chicken was shredded, fresh and house prepared. I only know that because I had a small bone that was in it but I associate it with the freshness of ingredients. The decor it's a little weak and worn. The bathroom clean, but due to it facing an alley way it overwhelmingly stunk of cat urine. Again, cannot blame that on the restaurant.They also kept an eye on my table but not harassing me with the standard " How is everything/ everything taste good?" Generic question you get at every restaurant. The vibe was relaxed, the food was good and prepared to an excellent taste, they have a small bar and serve a few taps, unlike Charritto's. The only thing, lucky for me as this is a late onset allergy for me, is I forgot to mention I'm allergic to everyone's former favorite super food before kale, the forgotten avocado. They never asked if there were any food allergies, and again, it was my fault in forgetting to mention.Reading other reviews, I dined by myself and saved the receipt. I didn't see any gratuity added on. Like I stated, beer was $6, burritos Atrevid $14 and tax $1.40. Maybe gratuity is included on larger parties, as is common practice for groups of six or more, but that should be clearly stated on the menu and circled on the check. Again, good vibe, good food. But what really, really hit it out of the park for me was the teamwork. That alone could make this establishment prosper.
2015-09-29,5,The drinks, the food and the staff = AMAZINGNESS. SOOO much fun!
2015-09-27,5,HOLY MARGARITAS!!!! Delicious, came here with a friend and had a great time. Large pitcher of sangria margarita & steak nachos!
2015-09-25,2,Would not come here again. Husband suggested it...which he afterward regretted.  We had to request our table to be cleaned (we had just seated ourselves at an outdoor table that was not cleaned; after asking if we may sit there and being told we could, they didn't notice to clean our dirty table). Well, one star goes to one kind server and the other star to the stiffness of the frozen margarita which otherwise was ok (get the sangria margherita if you insist to get one; don't get the watermelon one which tastes like cotton candy: ie, ineatable).  And this is being generous. The tacos were just eatable: not greasy but not much flavor with unripe avocado and not very fresh corn tortilla. The guac was ok, not terrible, not great: mine is much better and mine is not the best I've had. Nothing about the food except for the flour tortillas is particularly fresh. Mexican food is so much better than this: if I were Mexican, I would be pissed if this restaurant claimed itself to be Mexican.  This is nothing at all like authentic delicious slowly cooked homemade comforting flavorful and fresh Mexican food! What the Hell is this?? Tex Mex?! ....well I bet there is even better Tex Mex!! Finally, to make things worse, they added a large tip and snuck it into the tip for our party of two which is NOT cool unless it's clearly written on the menu! Dude, they don't write on the menu how many tacos to a taco entree either...what's up with that?!  Yet another disappointing 'Mexican' resto in Hoboken.  Dude, Im going to Union City next time for my Mexican. And please, don't call yourself East LA which I am sure has better Mexican food....even Beverly Hills which surely ain't Mexican (but IS in LA) has better Mexican food than this!
2015-09-25,5,Love East LA!!! Great afterwork spot.
2015-09-19,3,Saturday afternoon in Hoboken and we stopped in East LA for a late lunch. Im gonna say it was okay, just okay...Firstly, the menu is sort of sparse, half of the two page menu are egg dishes with the remainder being some basic Mexican. some additions would help round it out, maybe a few salads & apps would help.I was very happy to get my Negro Modelo from the tap ! Thats gotta be a first for me.East LA is a pretty basic place, a small bar is right at the entrance with seating outside and further into the building. At first it had a feel of a corner bar, what is most confounding is a "No Hat" policy... ... Im not even sure what to say, if it were of a more refined ambience i could go along with it, but i don't get for this place.As i said the food was okay, nothing special or exemplary, just okay. They get three stars, one of which is for the Negro Modelo.Service was... Serviceable
2015-09-18,1,Well, let's start with the fact, that in final bill was included tips (that was written with lower case somewhere but it's frustrating to find it only next morning), 20 bucks service fee (what for????? ridiculous!) and.... finally... amount charged from account was 100 bucks more that was signed on the check... So tasty kitchen and margaritas and so awful service... Unfortunately NO!NO!NO! in my list
2015-09-18,3,I highly recommend the sangria margarita. It was simply delicious. I also had the chicken tacos, not bad but it was a bit dry. The service was good and I'll come back to try other drinks and maybe another dish.
2015-08-15,4,Great place to hang with friends good drinks and food at a cheap price especially during happy hr
2015-08-07,3,Frozen margaritas are good but very crowded inside so conversations with friends are difficult
2015-08-01,3,Went to dinner with one of my girlfriends. The food was yummy. We shared steak nachos which were delicious and flavorful.  The margaritas were on point. They allow a 3 drink maximum Bc they are that strong. I will be back for some more nachos and margaritas.
2015-07-21,1,Terrible food, pretty sure only reason people go to East LA is for the super strong margaritas.
2015-07-20,4,I have not had the food here yet, however I have come in for margaritas on more than one occasion. The frozen margaritas are delicious! You can choose from 8+ different flavors and you can even mix and match. Please be mindful that the happy hour and drink specials only take place at the bar area even though it doesn't state anywhere that that's the case. The bar area isn't very large but the personality of the wait staff and the margaritas really make this place what it is.The bartenders and servers are all extremely well trained, highly attentive, and helpful. I would recommend giving it a try.
2015-07-09,1,Not what it used to be. Disgusting unclean place, terrible filthy tiny bathrooms (one at a time for a 100+ capacity restaurant?), bland food, dated interior.  Place fell off a cliff in the last 6 months -- wish Hoboken had better Mexican options. The only thing keeping this place afloat is its frozen margaritas, which you can pretty much find at many places around the area nowadays.
2015-07-08,1,Very disappointed!!! I have been there before years ago and it was ok. But this time it put the seal on it. We all sitting on a booth when all of a sudden we saw a roach. We called a coworker and told home about it and he came over and killed it. We asked for the Manger and he goes on to apologize be offering us drinks. We expressed to him on how gross it was and then offered to pay the bill but then he wanted us to leave as if it was our fault. It was very disappointing that a manger would down talk is as it was our fault. He had every excuse of how dirty the restaurant could get. But U.S. As better people we still paid out bill with out option of NEVER going back there again. He was never sincere with coming to us to saying he was wrong. This all happen Monday night July 6, 2015 right before closing. We didn't write his name.
2015-07-07,1,I have been coming to this restaurant for many years and I must say last night was my last night at this dump!! There are roaches on the walls!! So disgusting and to top it all off, the manager was so rude and nasty!! I have no words to express how dirty and disgusting this place is.  The service sucks and the manager is so unprofessional and nasty that I will never return here again.Please don't give them your money! Go to charritos!!
2015-07-05,1,I was there on the 4th of July with a friend. We ordered drinks and food. While we were eating a MID-SIZE ROACH, yes you read right, a ROACH, decided to crawl on our table! My friend and I got up and told the waiter. And this is why I'm writing this review, when I told the waiter he basically shrub it as it is NOT news to him! He could have played it off and act surprise but he didn't. Sooooo, this is the last time I'll eat there. Good luck!!
2015-06-22,4,Margarita are delicious.  The food is chea and fast. I had the mole burrito and it was amazing. Not to spicey not to chocolatey.  The enchiladas are also amazing. Me and my wife try to go here as much as we can. If the service was better it would be 5 stars but definitely a place to go with friends.
2015-06-20,4,Awesome drinks and food!!!  Great place to hang out with friends.. Def coming back to try the other flavored margaritas
2015-06-17,2,Mediocre Mexican food at a price point that doesn't seem to correlate. Frozen margaritas are decent. Service is solidly subpar.
2015-06-07,1,We wandered in here for brunch on the patio and had a thoroughly disappointing experience. We started with Bloody Mary's -- they were flavorless and stung of cheap vodka. We switched to the other drink special, figuring a mimosa was always a safe bet. Not so. Finally the food came. We tried the breakfast burrito and the breakfast sampler plate. Both were extremely salty, bland, and greasy. The sausage was almost as flat as the pancakes, and the bacon was so fried it was almost burnt. Needless to say, we will not be back. I'd steer clear of here -- there are tons of amazing gems in Hoboken. Don't waste a good brunch on a bad spot.
2015-06-07,4,Great drinks. Check out the frozen margaritas as they're absolutely delicious (and are surprisingly quite strong). The good is also delicious, my only resistance in visiting is the fact that the prices are a bit high ($10 for one frozen margarita, $9 for guacamole- it adds up quick!). The service is also great as bar tenders and wait staff go out of their way for customers while being very responsive.
2015-05-26,5,Best margaritas ever!!! Free chips and delicious salsa when your seated. Food was ok. I had fish tacos which was made with grilled tilapia strips not fried and the tortilla was a grilled corn tortilla. Hubby had steak entree comes with rice, refried beans, and steak with toppings in a fried tortilla. I took my husband their for his 30th bday at 12 am on a thurs. when everything was pretty much closed but here it was Live. Everyone was having a gd time and we enjoyed it very much.
2015-05-19,1,Absolutely horrible. The staff is a complete mess. Had to wait about 15-20 to get seated after they gave away our table the first time. Then we waited another 25 mins to see if a server would even remember us... we just ended up walking out.
2015-05-13,4,Went here during the maywhether pacquia fight.  Food was great! Very friendly staff and great drinks!  Not the greatest Mexican food but you will not be displeased.
2015-05-10,1,Reasonably priced good and drink, but not my favorite.I might be spoiled by other Mexican places in Hoboken that I found to be much better! Not awful just not my fav.
2015-05-07,1,This is by far the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I went around 1PM and they were blaring club music. I should've turned around then, but was hungry and decided to continue. What a mistake. After an apathetic waiter greeted us and dropped off the chips (which were the best part of the meal), he turned and loudly yelled to the other staff about his previous evening. My girlfriends chicken quesadilla was akin to plastic and was tasteless. The chicken was fatty and disgusting and the cheese was semi-melted into a coagulated disk of nastiness. I had steak tacos, which were literally pieces of overcooked, shoe leather quasi-meat with some kind of wilted cilantro haphazardly strewn about on top. We both got about 3 bites in (3 too many) before leaving enough cash to cover the tab and sprinting for the door. Calling this place a restaurant is a far fetched exaggeration. Steer clear at all costs. I will never return. I would give 0 stars if possible.
2015-05-03,4,Perfectly cooked good food , me n my friend both loved our entrees n the chip n salsa was also very good.
2015-05-03,3,I don't get why they limit you to just 3 margaritas, they were so weak, I had mine on the rocks so maybe the frozen ones are stronger but anyway I had the coconut margarita on the rocks, it was good but again, WEAK, and I'm not one of those idiots that wants to taste nothing but alcohol in their drink, I bartend, I know that's not how a drink should taste, but whatever now i know to ask for a shot on the side because I hate frozen drinks...The food isn't anything to write home about, I've eaten here like maybe 3 or 4 times now, and honestly it was a while ago so I don't really remember it much, which kinda proves my point.... But I just had to write a review after My friend and I sat at the bar like 2 days ago and ordered the chili con queso app, and I swear to bob it looked like that cheese dip tostitos has lol, except the tostitos dip tastes better, which is pathetic, the regular salsa however was decent, and the service is great, the bartender is so cool, very nice and attentive, I'll return for him cause good service now a days seems hard to find, this place is cool, not great but not terrible, I'll be back for that coconut margarita on the rocks (shot on the side) ;]
2015-05-02,3,Way too loud..burnt a simple cheese enchilada...slow service that seemed like they were just taken off the street
2015-04-05,5,Food is so-so, salsa and margaritas are top notch!! Plus they have some awesome food specials! Be careful to note that they add gratuity to your bill if you go on a night where they have a food special. Great spot to start the night!! My favorite Marg concoction is Chambord Coconut, but they're all amazing!
2015-03-30,4,We came to East LA in search for some good Mexican food. There was confusion straight off the bat on where we would be seated and who would be waiting on us. We waited 10-15 minutes before the owner/manager came over to check on us. By then we already knew what we wanted and we were a little impatient. But I understand. It was busy and he was apologetic, and he was nice enough to give us a half off discount on our bill. (So I'll give 4 stars instead of 3.)The atmosphere was very lively. It definitely wants to be a bar scene. The frozen margaritas were spot on. No complaints there. The food was not bad. It wasn't good but it wasn't bad. Nothing spectacular. So we're still on the prowl for some good authentic Mexican food. Maybe we'll be back for some drinks.
2015-03-28,1,The food is pretty standard. However, both times I've been here now they BLARE club music. It makes for an awful dining experience. I couldn't even hear the people across the table! I will be going elsewhere next time.
2015-03-04,4,best margaritas in town! My girlfriends and I love coming here for a drink or two before we go out. Bartender is super nice. Always crowded so most likely will have to stand while getting a drink at the bar.
2015-03-04,2,Went in for a drink on a Friday before grabbing dinner elsewhere. It was packed and the bouncer kept the door open longer than necessary. Getting chips and salsa for the group while we were drinking was impossible. The tables by the bar were dirty and no one ever came around to clean them off. The drinks were good though, hence the two stars.
2015-02-28,3,Well. Coming in from the cold outdoors, we were sat pretty immediately. Though when we were seated asked to take my winter cap off because hats arent allowed to be worn indoors. I had barely sat down when i was asked "can you take your hat off please" verrrrrrryyy weird. Even so that it may be more polite, in no way is this a five star restaurant let alone a four star. The way i was asked was pretty abrupt, though the lady said it was company policy, so she was just doing her job but it definitely put me off. So weird. Pricing was fair for the food. Mexican tacos are mediocre but affordably priced. Beer was a decent selection though theyre all priced the same. Id not be found dead paying 6 bucks for some labels that sell 6.99 to a 6 pack. All in all the food wasn't anything to celebrate. Ive had visited a few nearby mexican restaurants in the hoboken area with better food, though were more in the $$ - $$$ price range.The wait staff didnt really have it together, i had oner person take our drink order, another deliver, another who took out dinner order, and another who delivered the check. They also seemed confused because the hostess had asked if someone had been by. Music was much louder tha normal i had to shout at the waiter and also had to ask "whatt?" A few times.Food is good for its price, alcohol isnt badly priced, just need to make the cheaper beers not 6 bucks a pop. Turn down the music a tad and dump the hat policy. Also need to coordinate the wait staff. Needs a bit of work to get 4 stars.
2015-02-16,4,If you are looking for great mexican food this is the place, however during the winter this establishment fails in providing a warm environment and you are forced to leave you're coat on sometimes due to the cold, one of the male servers lacks on his customer service skills, the margaritas are a must in this place they offer a lot of different varieties In flavor. The food will not disappoint!
2015-02-14,3,Mediocre Mexican food, but great salsa and chips! LolThey got some good Modelo and other mexican beers on tap too.Overall, really good service though, so maybe its a place to come for a quick drink and a bite.I just came here cuz I am from LA, and saw a place called East LA in Hoboken, NJ!
2015-01-30,3,Everyone's right about the margs over here...they really are great with a lot of liq in them! The fajitas are decent. Portion size is big so its worth sharing a meal. The free chips and salsa is a plus!
2014-12-26,4,Im here every Thursday and Friday after work. This place is turn up heaven! I always get the classic tequila slurpy. The bartender is a ninja. She is fast, and efficient. The nacho and dip is excellent. I've never had their food just liquor, and nachos. Good place to mingle with an ice cold tequila slurpy after a hard days work.
2014-12-13,2,Avoid the margaritas!!!The food is mediocre, no more than that.I would have given 3 stars for an average food.They lost a star for charging us 20% service for a 28$ pitcher of margarita that we've retuned. It's a good thing I didn't return a 100$ steak, as they would have charged me 20$ for the effort of bringing it and returning it.I'm not expecting compensation for a bad drink, but the minimum is to not charge me service for that.
2014-11-13,3,The food's ok, the drinks are the draw.  Definitely a place to stop by in Hoboken if you are out this way for drinks.  Nice spot to meet new friends.
2014-11-12,3,I've been to East LA more times than I can even remember. My favorite food items are the chimichangas, or I'll pick a few items from their combination option. The restaurant itself is kinda dingy. The bathrooms are pretty dirty too. But the food is alright.They do make my favorite frozen margarita in Hoboken though. I'm partial to the strawberry margarita, but the mango one is pretty good too.
2014-11-09,2,The server provided us with good service and was very nice. However, when we got our drinks, there was paper inside at the bottom of one of my friend's water, and there was some brown stuff on my other friend's cup of water. Seems like there needs to be proper sanitation!Other than that the guacamole was EXTRA delicious today. I've had it multiple times (outside seating area) and it has always tasted sort of bitter. But today, I had it inside for the first time and it was absolutely delicious.
2014-11-03,3,East LA used to be so much better! (2 years or so ago)I went last night for dinner. Started with the chicken nachos (nothing special). The best dish in my opinion, if you are a seafood lover, is the spicy garlic shrimp. It's so good!But it doesn't make up for the slow service. And I hate how dirty their bathroom is. I hope the kitchen doesn't look like that!
2014-11-02,3,This place is not where you go if you want great, authentic Mexican food, but if you want really good margarita, East LA is it.  Love their slushy style margarita, especially on a hot summer day or any day you want a delicious margarita to quench your thirst.  Inside could get loud, especially by the bar.  Fun to sit outside on a warm, sunny day, people watching, sipping on a cold drink.  Not great service and staff are not always friendly, but after a few tall glass of margarita, you forget all that, hehehe.  Munch on their tortilla chips and enjoy a drink or two or three.  Decor is not much to speak of and definitely not family friendly.  Did I mention their margarita? hehe...   Yummy.  It's 44 degrees outside, but now I want their slushy margarita.
2014-10-19,3,I love East LA,really I do. It was where I had my first Hennessy Margarita,and that's an important experience for a 23 year old,but as of lately I am not happy. So for starters, last summer (2013) I would go frequently, food was great, drinks amazing , the staff pleasant. This summer, WTF? The staff is great, there's no changing that, but I don't know why the bouncer turned me and my cousin away twice. At first he said it was closed, so I look inside and there was about twenty people in there (sus?). Second time we go back and it was only 949 pm ON A THURSDAY and he turned us away again. At this point I had to ask why I couldn't go in and enjoy a margarita, I got no response just a shrug. My cousin went back to Puerto Rico having only been to East LA once,and she liked it,but they turned us away twice ! Now the following month my then pregnant Amiga wanted Mexican food and I wanted a cold drink, so we went (& they let us in!) We ordered dinner, showed up about 40 minutes later,and she was given the wrong meal. I had one margarita,she had mango juice and another person had two margaritas. They had a special for the food which was buy one entree get one free, and still our bill for three people came out to $100 and gratuity was included... For three people you include a 15% tip? And the food wasn't as good as it use to be. Idk, I'm hoping it was just an off summer for me and East LA,because I really do like them.
2014-10-07,3,This is a good place for lunch, it gets very loud around dinner time that it's hard to hear who you're with. The food is good, but their frozen margaritas are the reason to come!! Delicious.
2014-10-04,2,The setting was nice and staff was very friendly and attentive but all in all the food was not as good as I hoped it would be. I ordered beef enchiladas and the meat tasted so dry and plain. It was like I was about to choke on it. The rice and corn tasted like it came out of a frozen bag. I honestly wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. :/
2014-09-21,2,Their chips & salsa here are great. The drinks are reasonably priced. I like their taco salad but everything else that I have tried from the food menu is mediocre. The issue here is how disorganized the hostesses are. On several occasions, I have been given a 5 min wait and then they forget about my party about 20 mins later. I also once called and made a reservation and when I arrived I was told that they don't take reservations and that they don't know how long the wait will be. I stormed out, of course, because who says "I don't know how long the wait will be"? That's unheard of in the restaurant industry. Not ok.
2014-09-02,1,Horrible bartender. Came here for my bday and it was so ghetto fabulous . Bartender (Gizzelle) sucks! The bar back Leo was actually really good better than the bartender. I use to come here all the time. Never again especially on a Tuesday! Place needs to hire better bartenders . Thursday /Friday/ and Saturday are the best nights when she isn't the bartender. I recommend going on other nights .
2014-09-01,4,I've never eaten here but their margaritas are amazing! Usually come here for drinks. I was sad the other night (Friday) when I came in at 11:45 got my drink and found out they closed at 12. Wish they had longer hours!
2014-07-29,1,This place was awful. We stopped by for some lunch. The hostess was apathetic and inattentive; the off-duty employees were rude; the server whose section we were in left us, which meant we sat for an hour before our order was taken. The entire thing was a joke. We were about to leave when our order came out. Generally, the staff was pretty unconcerned about having customers. I saw three different employees go out to run errands -- either phone calls, cigarettes, or goods from the convenience store -- all while we sat without complimentary chips and salsa, waters, or silverware. I had to get my own menu -- I should have taken it as a hint.The only thing edible was the chips and salsa -- both of which were pre-made. The side dishes were undercooked, but the tacos were mediocre. Do not get soup here. Just don't. My soup featured very overcooked chicken and a flavorless broth. It was sad. Stopping here was a mistake and a waste of money for me. They might have decent drink options for happy hour, but I don't know about them. Don't come here for the food, though.
2014-07-12,3,The margaritas are really good and worth it! Considering the fact that we went on a Friday night around 8pm the hostess was able to get us a table almost right away. The server was pretty nice, the bathroom was ehh, the garbage was overflowing, I think someone should def keep and eye on that. The place is pretty small, and the bar too. We were planning on sitting at the bar not knowing how small it is which is why we ended up getting a table because it was so packed. Which I understand like I said we went on a busy hour. The food was great, def recommend the guacamole and quesadillas. Great place to go and have a few drinks and a meal.
2014-07-09,3,Have never had much of the food options, that is why I am giving it 3 stars. Had the quesadilla there once while sitting at the bar, it was really tasty, but it was a quesadilla (pretty hard to mess up). LOVE LOVE LOVE their frozen and on the rocks margaritas in the classic flavor. Overall will def go back for a night of drinking and food to pick on. I have heard from other patrons that they have a rodent problem which sort of freaks me out a little . . . I really hope it's not true.
2014-07-08,2,Let me start off by saying that the only reason why I gave this establishment 2 stars is because the manager was kind after 2 entrees were returned for looking like slop served from a frozen box, and the happy hour of margaritas with cheap tequila will get you drunk enough not to care that your food SUCKS!  I would recommend this place only to someone that I would enjoy watching suffer about 2 hours of restaurant torture. Between the hour it took half of our table to get their food, to the weird techno music they blasted (I was waiting for someone to ask me if I wanted glow sticks and a hit of ecstasy), I would soon rather eat refried beans out of a can from 1985 before I went back. Cheers to the manager and Matt, they were great. Other than that... NO WAY!
2014-07-05,2,I can't say I would recommend this place to a friend. The staff was downright rude. On multiple occasions, they yelled towards friends in the street. Our waitress was also slightly too intrusive. The food was only decent and certainly not good enough to compensate for the ambience. Save some time, go to Qdoba.
2014-07-05,5,Love this place. Great food  and great drinks.  Nice people who work here. Love to sit outside in the  nice weather. Iconic Mexican in Hoboken. My favorite Mexican hands down!
2014-06-30,5,Amazing Salsa!  (which is never ending might I add)  As well as the hot fresh tortilla chips!  The food is good and reasonably priced.  The margaritas are delicious, they come in every flavor there!  I am a purist and like the classic margarita on the rocks, with salt but all of the margaritas I've tried have been pretty tasty.
2014-06-20,5,Great happy hour!! Sangria Margaritas are amaze balls! If Silvia is your waitress you're in for a treat! She's funny, great with quick service, and will happily chat with your party. All in all one of the best spots on Washington!
2014-06-09,2,Came here with a couple of girlfriends a few weeks ago and our experience was disappointing. Food was just OK and tasted greasy, none of us wanted the leftovers. My out of town friends described it as "cheap Mexican" If I wanted cheap Mexican in Hoboken I would go to the Taco Truck but there a few much better Mexican places in Hoboken to go to. The place also had a bit of a sketchy crowd and could definitely use a good scrub down (especially in the bathroom)! I live around the corner and would not return here unless it was for a drink special and  I could sit outside.
2014-05-21,2,Should have gone to the 4 star Mexican place down the block. The food was pretty meh. How is it that the burrito contains nothing but meat and refried bean slime? Where is the rice, the cheese, the other assorted foodstuffs that usually live in a burrito? Such a weird meal.
2014-05-19,1,This place is awful. 1- sunday evening blasting house music in a small area = headache2- everyone in the restaurant at the time was SO loud and screaming and being rude, basically. people were walking around and not staying at their tables. 3- our server barely ever came to our table after taking our order - we were helped twice by the hostess and she forgot our guac order. 4- the food had no flavor5- the only good thing is the salsa they bring when you sit down.
2014-05-08,4,The 4 stars is for all my past experiences there but it's not 5 because  of my recent experience.We made the mistake of going the day before on cinco de mayo. The hostess was super nice and actually got us seated right awaywhen the bar area itself was jam packed with people trying to get the best margaritas in town! (Even though the last time I went, the margaritas were better. I'm looking past that because of how packed it was).We got seated and it took our waiter 5 minutes to bring us a menu and another 20 to ask what we wanted. We barely were able to give him our drink order. I think he forgot about us a couple times. I don't think it was intentionally, the guy was just swamped with tables. Ironically, they were playing Edm/house music , which I'm a huge fan of, but not what I was expecting when I walk into a place with Mexican flare. The food was good, as usual. Although, quesadillas  does not take a rocket scientist to make. Also, you can sit outside when it's warm out, which I like and always do in the summer.  I'll definitely go back on a night during the week but stay away from this place the before  & the day of Cinco de mayo, plus Friday & Saturdays. The place is uber small and the bar has no more then 10 seats, although there are tables but the place is too small... You'll end up smelling the woman whose sitting behind you her perfume, that's how close they sit people together!
2014-04-25,1,Good drinks and fair prices... However, to not be able to "guarantee" a table because it's a Friday night and the booths are occupied is ridiculous. A smarter way of doing business would be to ask the people not eating and only drinking in the booths to get up. The reason being that more revenue would be generated if they sold more food, hence having the booths in the first place. Guess more business and paying customers are not needed in this establishment. So I will never go again.
2014-04-10,5,Call me insane (and don't judge me) but I love this place! Granted, I always get quesadillas, chicken wings, and sangria margaritas. If I had one word for it, I'd say consistent. I know that I can go there anytime and hear the same soundtrack, get mediocre chips/salsa, excellent quesadilla & a to-die-for drink.. There is a drink limit for a reason.  With every penny and minute. Ohhh, it's always jam packed with regulars... And, it's small...but, like I said I love this place.
2014-04-03,3,Food and service were excellent ! Except for the super loud music which resulted in my friends and I shouting to get heard, we had a good meal.
2014-03-21,3,When I was in Hoboken, this was my favorite spot away from all the college filled bars down on Washington next to the path. It was possible the first time I had heard of frozen margaritas!!! And they particularly mix all flavors in, including my favorite Sangria flavor!What can be wrong about mixing Sangria and Tequila.... nothing!!! It's my favorite two drinks in the world!I met the owner once, he was friendly with a friend that introduced me to this place. Haven't seen him again, but nothing about this place has changed. It is still pretty packed on weekends. I can't say I have had their food... but I always found it cool to get a frozen margie with a good friend and we usually get the windows in the front. I like crazy quirky places and this one hits the spot. I have had their chips and salsa... the salsa is not homemade... This is the type of place you come and unwind form a cray cray weekend.missing the margies and company.... I wouldn't say this is the place to hang out all day. In my book.. this is the type of place you wait to have a cemented relationship before you bring your loved one here for a date hahaha! :) still I love it here!
2014-03-20,4,This place has a special place in my life. Its where I reunited with the love of my life. Now to what matters the food its OK,,, I would play it safe and order quesadillas, but I'm a picky eater so maybe you shouldn't take my word for it. Their pinÃÉa coladas are very very good although I get them without alcohol, and pretty much everyone goes crazy for the margaritas. The servers are nice, I feel different about the bartenders. I had birthday dinner here once, and because I'm not a drinker I did a birthday shot, and threw up so embarrassing!!! But we all laughed it up. Hahaha!
2014-03-17,3,I honestly don't know what to think of this place. The food was pretty good, though I did have way better Mexican food. All the margarita flavors taste the same though. The service was pretty bad and it's really crowded and cramped in there. The guy that comes out with the food you can hardly understand, and confuses orders. I'm really not sure if I would come back here or not.
2014-03-16,4,*sangria margarita (strong frozen margarita)*industrial quesadilla (chorizo, mushrooms & onions; this was super amazing!! The flavors were popping and the amount of salt in it was perfect; tortilla was crisp and thin; the guamole was something else, I could not believe how creamy it was!!! this entire dish was done right and I would totally go back for it)*peach margarita (really strong; not as much peach flavor as I would like, maybe even some canned peaches would have helped, regardless though it was still good)
2014-02-26,4,Taco salad is a must and the dressing is amazing. Place is awesome but looses some points due to the service. First time was great. The second when it was not even that busy, the server didn't seem to care much and came around a few times and when he finally came around he took our plates and dropped a check without asking if we were even done or wanted anything else meanwhile he left us there to take care of some drunk girl sitting in the stairs smoking a cigarette. Food was great ... Service not so much.
2014-02-20,2,Margaritas on a warm day is the only reason to step foot in here. They are perfect: strong, tasty and plenty of flavors. You'll be feeling good after 2.The food and decor is sub par. Not flavorful and pretty generic. The seats in booths are ripped up and the floor is generally dirty. Oh...and there on occasion can be a questionable crowd.
2014-02-10,1,place was horrible. i don't know how people are giving this a good review. the food gross, the margaritas were pre made and poured out of a machine and then they throw in some flavor, i feel bad for people who think its good i wish you would try a real margarita.and ben the place its self was bad broken tables and patio chairs inside.
2014-02-02,2,If it wasn't for the kick ass margaritas this place would have closed down a long time ago. The food tastes like microwaved food, my guacamole was sour meaning it had sat in the refrigerator for a few decades long. Gross
2014-01-08,3,Food is decent. If you are looking for excellent mexican food or a dressy place there are definitely better places in hoboken but East LA does give you ok food at good value.. I would recommend the combo, where you pick three mexican staples that come with rice and beans for $15. Margaritas are decent, and not weak either. I would go back for a casual dinner or drinks.
2014-01-05,2,East LA should just cancel out their restaurant portion and just keep it as a bar. Seriously, their food is just awful...the drinks are okay the best thing they've got going is their margaritas but even those leave you with a stomach ache after a few hours..
2013-12-18,2,I used to really like East La for two reasons: they made pretty decent food and they were cheap (especially compared to so many other Hoboken places). However, I went back tonight and it seems since the last time I went, they changed their menu and raised their prices. Sorry East La, you were good before because we didn't expect perfect Mexican food because the price was right and our bellies were full. Now you shortened your menu, raised your prices and sadly, I now see that ya ain't nothin' too special. I'll be moving on-- it's time you reevaluate.
2013-12-12,2,I've been coming to East LA since its inception and it used to be a favorite place, especially for Margaritas and breakfasts. No more. After living out of state for more than a decade, I returned to find a place where the food isn't as good, the prices are higher, and most of all THE SERVICE SUCKS. You want to talk about SLOW. There was no reason for that, either, as the couple times I've come there have been almost no customers. East LA, you have competition in town, I don't see why you aren't stepping it up, not slacking off.
2013-11-22,2,Hoboken has many Mexican restaurants and I finally decided to give this one a try. I went during happy hour and had 2 frozen margaritas which they make with a mixture of any flavor you want. I had the peach mango margarita and the sangria-pomegranate. Both were great, surprisingly strong, and only $6. The food on the other hand was not. I had the Financial steak quesadillas..which don't even come with rice,beans, like other restaurants that offer the platter at the same prize. They were tiny and just not worth ordering. I should have gone to the place solely for the drinks.
2013-11-15,2,Over the years, this restaurant has slowly gone downhill.  I actually used to really like this restaurant (roasted vege burritos are the bomb) and have been here many times, but my last visit there prompted me to write this review.  THE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE.  Our waitress was a young woman, who had poor manners, rude, unprofessional conduct, and just overall was not service-oriented.  We had to constantly flag her down for water refills, chip and salsa refills, more silverware.  She seemed more interested in her friends that came in (family with a baby) than providing service to the customers.  She didn't even wash her hands after handling the infant mulitple times before handling our food and beverage. The prices have gone up too.  I like the food and drinks, but the service has left a bad taste in my mouth.
2013-11-06,3,I had a late lunch here over the summer. It was an ok experience. My friend and I tried the frozen margarita pitcher. It wasnt the best margarita. The food was different. I didnt like how messy my plate looked. The plate presentation sucked. Lol! The price was good. But its definitely not a place to go crazy about. Overall not a bad place for a quick bite.
2013-10-17,3,Food is alright. It's a bit pricey for what it is. Their frozen drinks are strong though, so that's a plus. They can definitely spruce up the menu and clean up the joint a bit and it would generate more revenue. Until then the food is mehh and the place is usually crowded at night.
2013-09-25,1,NOT MEXICAN, it's tex-mex. the service was shit, would've been nice to know that the sour cream that my table never used was an extra $3 each, food came late, it was cold and we waited literally for 45 mins and 4 rounds of chips and dip. I ordered a torta (Mexican burger) and literally, it came in an american bun.. Google what a torta is if you don't know... If you want authentic, go to charrito's down the street.
2013-09-19,3,Decent mexican restaurant in Hoboken...not the best food I've had, but not the worst.  Pricing wasn't bad and service was good.  This is a decent spot, but not GREAT/anything to rave about...lolI thought East LA was a funny name though...lol...I wonder if the owner is from there...
2013-09-09,2,I've come here many times. I don't think it's great by any means but it's just convenient & I like to drink margaritas outside! (Who doesn't?)Yesterday my friends & I arrived around 7pm to grab some drinks & apps outside. I had my 12 pound dog with me, he goes to dinner with me all over Hoboken, so nothing new. The hostess sat us, she gushed over my dog, the waiter greeted him...Everything was fine. My dog stayed under my seat the entire meal. Over an hour after we were there, some waiter from inside randomly came running out to tell me my dog had to be OUTSIDE the fence. I had been there for over an hour at that point, I was seated not around anyone else, and my dog was just laying down on the pavement not doing anything. I found this announcement, which was very loud, to be completely uncalled for and rude. Even if my dog had to be outside the fence, there is a way to say it...and that was not to run at my, yell at me, and walk away so that everyone around me heard.Got my check & left. Will not be coming back anytime soon. I refuse to be a patron to a place that staffs rude ignorant people. Business pays your salary dude! Be nice.
2013-09-03,3,The Fajitas are really good, as are the chips/salsa.  The service is usually pretty inattentive though.  Never anything specifically bad, they just don't pay you much attention.
2013-08-11,2,Disappointing. While the sangria was good, the rest of the food and service were mediocre. The $9 guacamole was tasteless and came in a small plate. The waitress seemed bothered in the few times we reached out but maybe it was just the lack of smile in kindness. One final note: The restroom is a disaster. Dirty. Window is broken. Not a pleasant site. Anyway, first and last for me.
2013-07-23,1,I hate to do this because I used to really like East LA but it's pretty clear that cleanliness has taken a back seat. inside is filthy! Saw a little MOUSE in the DINING  room halfway through my meal. If they're in the dining room, I can not imagine what the kitchen or food storage areas are lol. The manager (nice guy) definitely knew all about the mice and told me they've been having exterminators come every week or so and comped our entire bill .I will never go back.
2013-07-08,3,Tried East LA for the first time this past Friday night, haven't been there before this evening but heard a lot about it. I've heard a lot about the frozen Margaritas, so of course I had to try one. I got the Strawberry Margarita for $9 and my boyfriend got the Hennessy Margarita for $13. The drinks aren't bad at all, but very strong. You get your money's worth, and for me personally one will get me through the night, two will get me drunk. ;)We mainly went for the drinks, just to give it a try but in order to sit outside, you have to order food as well. So, we ordered an appetizer - some flauticas, which weren't bad. They were small but I guess that's why their an appetizer, but loved the chips and salsa. Will deff give it another shot sometime and try an actual meal.
2013-07-03,4,Margaritas Margaritas Margaritas. East LA is a nice spot to get a good drink and hang with some friends. I've had the food a few times and there is nothing too exciting about it. The prices are ok and the crowd is usually cool and attractive. This is a great pregame spot to get a nice buzz before you go out and have a good time. Did I mention the Margarita's?As far as size, its decent. there are a couple booths that seat 5-6 ppl and a few that seat 2-4. Then they have tables in the back for extra seating. The bar area is kinda small and at the front, which could contribute to the amount of ppl in that area. Overall, this is a nice place and definitely recommend it.PS... Please try the sangria margarita.
2013-07-03,4,Fits the mold!  Definitely felt like I was in dive bar around the LA area while I was here.  This casual bar scene and grub spot had some good food, and pretty strong drinks!   For a first or second visit, 'd definitely suggest the sampler because everything's pretty good here!Did I mention we happened to go on Tuesday, which ended up being 2-for-1 entrees!  **For Entertainment Purposes Only**The bouncer was a bit of a jerk.  East LA has curbside seating, but you need to go into the bar to see the hostess.  When he asked for my ID, I told him I just needed to see the hostess so we could eat outside, so I inquired why that required me to show an ID.   He responded with, "because we serve alcohol".  Wow...enlightening... No sh*t Sherlock.
2013-07-01,3,I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and have gone to East LA a bunch of times;. They have the best salsa I've ever had and their margheritas are strong. The food really is delicious which makes it hard to over eat.The chipotle chicken wings are a must, I get them everytime. They have a little different taste than the standard hot wing. I have gotten the tacos with pulled beef and tostadas with beef. Both and delicious and served with beans and rice. Again, I love the food but I always leave here been over stuffed and sick, but that's not their fault it's mine!Great spot for Mexican food and a laid back atmosphere.
2013-06-24,2,East LA is one of those staples in Hoboken; people eat, people drink, and people linger there.  It is also one of those places I always want to go to eat, but I am never quite satisfied with the food. But something always leads me back.It was a pretty hot afternoon and I ran into my friend and we instantly thought, frozen margaritas. East LA is known for their frozen alcoholic beverages so we stopped there. Yes, it took us a little while to decide what frozen drink we wanted out of the many many margarita flavors, like peach, mango, blue curacao. But somehow, that little stutter slowed our whole experience down. In order to sit outside, you need to order food. We were not very hungry, mostly just in the mood for our frozen beverages, but we ordered a large guac appetizer to secure our outdoor table. Our drinks took the longest to come out. We were girl chatting and noticed everyone was getting their cool and colorful drinks before we were, and so we asked. We were informed that the bartender was moving slow, but how does that equate the uneven service. On top of waiting forever for our drinks, our chips and guacamole took a long time too. Again we saw food coming out all around us, but not ours. It was a bummer, but the drinks were strong (only needed one) and the guacamole was creamy and authentic.The staff, though initially was kind of stiff, ended up being super nice. I got salsa on my sleeve and our waitress brought out her concoction to get stains out, without being asked.  I am glad we warmed up to them and they warmed up to us.
2013-06-13,2,We came here for a Sunday brunch and the food was just okay. Everything seemed WAYYYY over cooked with tons of oil. The sangria was really watered down in my opinion.
2013-05-28,4,If you want a place that serves good mexican food, strong sangria, and has a bar like atmospher than East LA is the place for you Additionally, the prices are very good for the amount of food you get. Girlfriend and I went and shared a pitcher of sangria and had two entrees all under 40 dollars. It is definitely not an upscale restaurant, but great place to get some mexican food, a few drinks, and hang out. The outside seating area is also definitely a plus in nice weather.
2013-05-11,1,I only go there for the margaritas. The bar tenders are rude at times and mix orders up and then blame you in the end. There is one bartender that is always doped up or drunk. The food is horriable. The waitstaff can sometimes be testy and unfriendly. There is not many things I really can say about this place but I am sure it has seen better days. Everytime I am there I am always throwed out for some reason on another and that got really old really fast. Your doing youself a big favor of not going there period. Enjoy the drinks forget the food.
2013-05-01,2,I'd say a solid 2.5 stars. There really isn't too much to say that hasn't already been said by literally almost every review here. The margarita's are awesome, strong and on Tuesday's they are $5, watch out! The sangria flavor is my favorite and packs quite a punch. Service here is spotty and inconsistent. One time we went we got our drinks in red solo cups. Now I'm a fraternity guy, but that was a long time ago, when I pay for drinks now I don't expect solo cups.The food is definitely an afterthought, if you are coming here just for food, walk another 20 feet to Sabores great authentic Mexican food. If you want a bite while consuming intense margarita's stay here. I don't think I need to go into great detail about the food as everyone else has.The crowd at night is interesting.
2013-04-17,3,I wish I could give this 3.5 stars. Everything was good-- nothing was spectacular. Do you know what I mean? Service was good, food was decent (I had the shrimp fajitas. Shrimp were large and fresh but the rest was a little too oily for my liking). We went on Tuesdays and they do buy one get one entrees. If it weren't for that, I would probably say this place was a little too expensive for what it was but, uh.... yeah.
2013-03-22,3,The margaritas will always have me coming back.  The only thing i have to say is the staff is odd.  Theres a guy who looks like the owner and he pretty much is running around like a crazy person every time I'm there.  The wait staff mess up alot.  There have been times my food would take forever.  I would say, go for drinks only and for brunch.  When it gets busy, it'll take a while to get your food. You may even be standing awhile for anyone to notice your waiting for a table too.
2013-03-11,1,This place was the WORST! The music was so loud it felt like a club! Our table was crooked, the food was awful, it looked like the place hadn't been properly cleaned in YEARS! The hostess looked like she lost her stripper pole. I won't EVER return here. The food was barely considered MEXICAN.
2013-02-09,4,I'm a big fan of Mexican food and am typically a tough critic of the cuisine, so I'm just gonna tell it how it is--even though this wasn't the best Mexican food I've had in the area, it was acceptable. That is, the food was seasoned well and was tasty enough... and the portions were plentiful and just right... typical but satisfying. On this visit, I had the Matamoros Enchiladas, which consisted of 3 chicken enchiladas with different sauces--one with suprema sauce (like a cream sauce), one with mole sauce, one with salsa verde. The enchiladas were delicious (but could have been a little hotter, temperature-wise), and the rice and beans were just typical (but tasty enough). If we had half stars on Yelp!, I'd rate the food 3.5 stars.Drinkwise, East LA is spot on-- in fact, the margaritas were just right!! My friend and I ordered a pitcher of frozen swirled margaritas (that's where they swirl two flavors together), and these were extremely tasty. Also, we were both walking a little silly when we left the restaurant--which is always a good sign, right? :) All in all, I had a great experience at this divey little Tex-Mex joint in Hoboken! I'm not in Hobo often, but I'd definitely return to this place if were in the area-- especially for drinks! My 2 cents = try a pitcher of the frozen swirl margaritas... or, better yet, try 2 pitchers :)
2013-02-04,5,Never been disappointed by their chicken flautas! The chips and salsa, best around!
2013-01-25,2,Food here is OK at best, they do have a great $5 Margarita Monday special, they have pre-made frozen margaritas, dont let the pre-made fool you, they are very strong. I would not recomend going here for the food but a great place for drinks.
2013-01-11,5,All I has was the margarita pitchers. 1 more and I would have had to be carried out. The pinÃÉa colada one was really good. Watermelon was ok
2013-01-03,3,I have mixed feelings about this place. I am very picky with my chicken and have ordered chicken dishes here in which I thought the chicken tasted like reheated chicken. I also saw a roach once on my table. Good thing it was after i finished my meal. It crawled on my table and I felt pretty bad telling the waiter as it is not his fault so I put a cup over the insect and told him on my way out. I havent been back since.Drinks are really strong here. Margaritas will have you feeling nice. This place gets really crowded, however the crowd is not really my style.
2012-12-26,5,Been here a bunch of times. Amazing margaritas- sangria margarita is the best. Delicious and very strong. Food is also very good. Guacamole and shrimp quesadillas are delicious. Good atmosphere, nice staff. Gets pretty crowded on the weekends, best to call ahead.
2012-12-03,4,Food was tasty and margarita was great. Not the best Mexican food ever but it was pretty delicious.  I recommend it. The staff was nice.
2012-12-02,4,Have been here a few times now and actually enjoy the food. Surprised by some of the reviews. Nothing fancy but great Mexican food. Margaritas are very strong but great. Great local spot in Hoboken!!
2012-11-12,3,4-star margarita + 2-star food = solid but not amazing 3-star.The reason to come here are the margaritas... the food is basically an afterthought.  It is below average Mexican almost across the board.Don't come for the food, come for the drinks.. if you so happen to need to eat, go for it, it's not terrible but don't expect fine dining!
2012-09-10,3,Good frozen margaritas - the sangria margarita is simply marvelous in terms of hitting you. We could smell the tequila when it was being poured in our glasses.Food is not great.Verdict - Good place to have drinks in group before heading out to club in Hoboken.
2012-09-06,3,This is a great place for drinks.  The frozen Margaritas are great and has become a favorite place of mine on Cinco de Mayo.  The food is not the best but the fat mexican goes great with a pitcher of the frozen strawberry margarita.
2012-08-22,4,Went on a busy Thursday night( So it was VERY loud). Food was good (I had a chimmi) and the margarita was really tasty as well. Beware, they charge $4 for extra guacamole and neglected to tell me that before or after I asked for some extra. Also, if it's busy, expect to wait in line for the restroom. One person at a time :/I'll try again on a less busy  night, but worth taking the trip.
2012-07-23,3,Great Margaritas. Average mexican food. This place tends to draw a more mature crowd...in comparison to the type of kids that hang at Bahamama's and get pissed-drunk in this beloved city. This place is perfect to grab a few drinks in a group...definitely not a place for a first date (far from romantic). East LA keep up the good drinks and improve your dirt-looking refried beans, thank you.
2012-07-23,2,Drinks were good, very strong, and therefore good. I wasn't a fan of the food at all or just the look of the place really. The staff tried their best but on a weekend the place is packed up front by the door by a type of zombie I can't yet categorize. Maybe I'd be back for happy hour only for drinks.
2012-07-22,3,Went to East LA for lunch the other day and it was okay. I'd say the margaritas were 5-star, the food was 4-star (with the exception of the guac, which was 1-star) and the service was a 2-star. Overall a solid meal, but nothing amazing.The chips and salsa that they give you when you sit down are really, really good. But the food kind of went downhill from there. The guac was awful. Very little flavor and the avocado wasn't ripe. Avoid at all costs.The rest of the food was okay Mexican food, but I think I would go back at some point. Definitely going to get more margaritas next time.
2012-06-28,4,I give this place four stars because of the delicious margaritas, especially the frozen sangria margarita. The ambiance inside leaves a little to be desired, but I could sit outside all day sipping margaritas on a nice day.
2012-06-14,1,Margarita's are great but the place is filthy.  There was a roach swimming in my brother's food.  It was pretty distrubing.  I won't even go there to drink anymore.  They need to clean this place up.
2012-06-10,3,Having had my share of kick-ass Mexican food in California, this place will hold me over until my next trip home.  Tasty happy hour margaritas will always win me over.
2012-05-29,1,POOR SERVICE!  We WAITED an HOUR for our food that never arrived.  But not before listening to our elusive waitress blame the cooks and walk away like she could care less.  When I brought our wait time to the attention of the restaurant manager he actually  tried to convince me that we had really  been waiting only 15 minutes and not the hour I had claimed...YES!...this MORON was actually arguing with me and defending their poor service instead of apologizing and fixing the problem!!We cancelled the order rather than wait another half an hour on top of the hour that we had already waited.  I say this because the nice couple next to us had been waiting a half an hour longer than us.  If you want to experience what it's like to be on the receiving end of a completely MISMANAGED and UNPROFESSIONAL restaurant operation please go here.
2012-05-17,4,Frozen Margaritas are on point here especially during this warm days. The best part is when the outside of the cup start frosting from the coolness of the drink. So i kind of put this place to the test because I spent some time living on the west coast and had some pretty good mexican food during my time out there.I tried the burritos here before and wasn't too impressed, it was ok.I did like the chicken quesadilla. I asked the waiter add some jalapenos inside the chicken quesadilla which he kindly had the chef make to my requests.Crowd is mixed and fun. I like this place compared to the rest of hoboken, its not too "FOO HOO" or too "ghetto" as some ppl would say. A decent mixed crowd of after workers, locals, groups of girlfriends etc.The guys and I head over there to watch the playoffs or just grab a drink on thirsty thursdays. For me, its different from the other places in hoboken. Doest look like you walked into a frat party... Actually represents north jersey and the diff cultures that this county is known for.I would of gave this place 5- stars but the food wasn't too impressive.Absolutely a nice place to hang out n grab a drink n some appetizers.Outside seating is cool.
2012-05-04,4,We go here most Fridays for our date night.  The food is good and reasonably priced, but the frozen margaritas are ridiculous.  The raspberry one tastes like there is no alcohol in it, but it must be pretty strong because one small pitcher is all we need for the night.  Now that the weather is getting better this is also a good place to sit outside.
2012-05-03,3,Great Drinks. Poor Poor Food.Crowd is a little odd on the weekends.
2012-04-28,4,We went there last night for Jason's bday after I had read reviews on yelp. This place is great!! Everyone was super nice, the food was yummy- they give you big portions of chips and salsa & the margarita's were AMAZING!! AND they had banana flavor!! They were a little higher than I thought they should be for Hoboken, but well worth it. The table next to us started talking to us and bought Jason a drink for his bday- so sweet. Then right as we were leaving, Daphne Oz from The Chew on ABC walked in with her family & was seated right behind us. She was so nice and gracious enough to pose for a picture! We will definitely be going back!!
2012-04-22,1,This place is awesome if you love eating Mexican food while observing roaches crawl around. If roaches aren't your thing you should go for the fruit flies which will accompany you while you eat and drink your food. I will never be eating here again. The little bit of food I did eat before losing my appetite was sub-par. The margaritas were good but not enough to make up for everything else...I can't believe people have given this place more than 2 stars...
2012-04-20,3,This deserves a 3.5 stars.  Margaritas were AWESOME!!!  I had the Mango and the Sangria margaritas.  Definitely try the Sangria margarita.  I had two and I had a wonderful little buzz.  Went to Hoboken Pet afterwards and spent too much money on things that my cats don't need.I thought the food was good, but wasn't anything too memorable.  My boyfriend wasn't crazy about his dish (I can't remember what it was, but it had beef in it).  I had the shrimp fajitas.  Tons of shrimp and the peppers and onions were pretty tasty.  I didn't really like the interior of the restaurant, but the margaritas made me feel good, so I'll let that slide.  I sort of want to give it 4 stars, but read a review about a pest problem, and that grosses me out.
2012-03-28,4,This review is for the strawberry margaritas and excellent window seating.Have gone several times, and have realized the below.Don't....1. Eat the food2. Be afraid of asking for extra strawberries3. Stand in the bathroom line for longer than 5 minutes without throwing your shoulder against the door... it sticks.Do...1. Forgo the usually-coveted booths for the barstools in the front windows2. Make nice with the rather large and intimidating doorman, but don't be annoying3. Be wary of drunken... uh... silly people here, because one marg will knock you on your booty, and people seem to have bottomless stomachsI will generally make this place just one short stop on a night out, but that one margarita is well worth any of the more disappointing aspects of East LA.
2012-03-21,2,I've been here several times for brunch and would have to say it's very hit or miss. Great service and food the first time. Lousy, inattentive service with less than satisfying food the next. Don't think I'd return or recommend it to anyone.
2012-03-01,2,I have been here before and liked it, but I was having Margaritas with my meal!  I had a dinner with out Margaritas last night and the food was horrible.  I would only come back for the Margaritas and some nachos or something.  The food was really bad.  The service on the other hand was friendly and attentive, hence the two stars.
2012-02-24,2,I normally like going there the food is good and the Margaritas are kick ass.. How ever when I called they aren't so friendly. I called to see if they had a Mariachi Band for Cinco de Mayo and the lady Rudely said it was to early to know. It was just a simple question a Maybe would have been sufficient. Thumbs Down for that .....
2012-02-16,3,The food at this place is pretty decent. Not amazing, and certainly hard to compare to Mexican food from the west coast but for Hoboken its pretty good. If you're looking for Mexican food, I would go to this place over Charrito's which is probably an unlikely suggestion but I think this place is better.One aspect that I didn't particularly enjoy is that place is over the top loud. I enjoy a fun, bar atmosphere as much as the next person, but this place takes it to the next level. Get ready to have to yell if you want to have a conversation and if you're going with a group choose your seat wisely since you'll only be able to hear the people sitting directly next to you.
2012-02-02,4,The rating is for margaritas only, definitely best around. They use real fruit, lots of tequila and big portions.  As for the food, its nothing to rave about. This is not the place for authentic mexican.  If you just want an app to go with your margarita then the steak nachos are decent.  As for the place, its pretty small, crowded, and you will probably have to wait a bit to get seated.  Once again though, the margaritas kick ass.
2012-01-13,4,The Breakfast is surprisingly goodGet the shrimp salad !Make sure you specify you want the lunch menu if it's still before 2:00
2011-12-26,4,Went there on Tuesday the 20th, with 3 other friends, for an annual pre-xmas dinner out.  The main reason why we choose this place is the 2 - 1 night specials on entrees and drinks.  Service was quick and responsive, food was good, drinks flowed easily, all in all a great time.  The only thing that would have made it a 5 star review as opposed to the 4 star I am giving it, the cleanliness of the place.  Let's face it, the place is a dive.
2011-12-24,1,The charm of the storefront disappears as soon as you enter the door. Staff is yelling over the unnecessary bass jams and televisions playing in the background. Bar patrons are screaming at imaginary plays happening on Monday Night Football because it hasn't started yet. Did I mention the screaming and yelling of the owner/manager? I think he was trying to impress the patrons...some how. My enchilada lacked any real flavor. I ate it all but nothing to write home about. The food is better at one of the fast food style mexican chains in town. But if you've come to get loaded on margaritas and lose self control you have found the place.
2011-12-10,2,At one time I recall thinking I liked East L.A.  Irrespective of whether my recollection is correct, I'm not digging it now.If you have mediocre food, have cheap drinks.  If you don't have cheap drinks, have good food.  East L.A. you're breaking these rules.Please don't let me come back.  I've eaten here far too often.
2011-12-07,3,Go, get wasted and that's really it. their drinks are good. the service poor and the food subpar. the next time i go here it won't be to eat. it'll be to get my pitcher of margarita and relax with my babe
2011-11-22,3,First time there on Sat.... It's a very small place. We waited for about 10 mins for a table. We sat towards the back in middle of two other tables, was a bit tight, but ok! They have TV's all over so that you can watch sports. The waiter was very nice. Wasn't sure what margarita to order, since I'm not much of a drinker , he gave me a pineapple with coconut margarita. My hubby ordered the Sangria Margarita which was ohh myyy... (GOOD!!). I didn't taste the liquor in my drink so the waiter took it back and said, he'll hook it up , and WOW!!  that is what he did.. I had a buzz.. LOL!! The salsa and chips are good, they will refill your chips if you ask. The food was ok!! I've had better Mexican food, but their drinks are what they are known for. Overall, its a nice place to hang out. The people are nice, the music, oh yea, was the BOMB on the night I went. It was loud, and they turned it up even louder. My hubby and I were dancing in our seats, felt like we were in a club... they needed to move the table so people can get busy and dance the night away. I didn't want to leave because the music and drinks were soooo GOOD!!!We'll be going back!! For the drinks & music of course!!!!
2011-11-11,2,The food here is just your average Tex-Mex, nothing special.  However the margaritas are pretty decent (especially for the $5 happy hour price).  The wait staff was friendly and helpful.I would come here again for drinks , but not for dinner.  I think if you're better off at Charrittos if you want good Mexican in Hoboken.
2011-10-08,1,Tuesday buy one entree get one free!, theres a catch, theres a one time service fee which is more than some of the entrees. i love this place but this scam got me once and left the worse flavor in my mouth.. im one unhappy customer
2011-09-10,5,Awesomest cheapest Mexican place to get drunk! Another great homstyle meal and an amazing drinking time!  One margarita = good. two = great. Three = gone. A great standby place for good food, a great time, and a small bill. Perfect! Outdoor seating is a must I hope you luck out!
2011-08-21,1,I tried several times to like East L.A. but I just can't. The food is mediocre and a glimpse into the kitchen only confirms suspicions that this place is more interested in being a bar rather than a restaurant. Every time I've eaten there it's felt like I overpaid for remarkably bland food and barely there service. There is no shortage of mexican restaurants in Hoboken that can serve fairly priced delicious food - don't bother with East LA.
2011-08-07,4,I've been here 5+ times and cannot get over the great margaritas! They have great flavors and are pretty darn strong. The location is awesome, I love sitting in the cramped outdoor section to people-watch on Washington Street. The interior is just so-so. I've had all sorts of stuff from the menu, and prefer the appetizers to any of the entrees. The nachos are especially great. I love the fresh chips and salsa as well. It probably is not the most authentic Mexican in the area, but if you like good margaritas it is definitely worth a shot!
2011-07-30,1,I have to give a star? I have been to this place before but my experience this time was awful. The service was slow and we had to wait forever for someone to tend to our table. Let's not talk about the roach that crawled across our table either. Maybe this place makes some good margaritas but that's where it stops. If you want better,cheaper Mexican food go down the block to Qdoba. You'll be better off.
2011-07-22,2,First time there tonight!  Margaritas were awesome.  Out of a machine but I understand why you can only have 3!  On to the food... My usual Mexican spots are in Union City and North Bergen; Puerto Vallarta, El Rey del Taco and Taqueria Veracruz.  I ventured outside my comfort zone.  If you are looking for authentic Mexican food, this isnt the place.  The food isn't terrible but you can find better and cheaper if you go up the hill.
2011-07-06,3,3 of us ate here on a tuesday eveing as we were craving Mexican food.  My wife was looking forward to a seafood enchilada and was disappointed that none were on the menu.  She opted for the shrimp fajitas and was again disappointed when told they were out of guacamole.  This was later in the evening so I guess it "could" happen.  I had spicy shrimp and vegetables and it was great!  My son had two enchiladas with mole` sauce and he enjoyed it as well.  Half way through the meal, our waiter came and told us they had just made fresh guac and that saved the day!  It was outstanding and he even shared how they made it, which is not normal.  The service was very fast and very friendly and helpful.  We were very pleasantly surprised when we got our bill and found out that dinners were two for one on tuesdays, which we did not know going in.  The place is a little "dive-y" but not enough to keep us from returning next time we're "out east".
2011-07-03,2,I have been here two times now. You know the saying, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me! This would be an accurate statement when talking about this place.You get two stars because your margaritas are incredibly intoxicating...literally! However, I had such poor service at this place, I don't know if I can stomach to go back. They ran out of chips and salsa during brunch! How does that happen at a Mexican restaurant?
2011-06-25,3,This is my second time here. I had the fried tiger shrimp stuffed with cheese. It was too cheesy and $8 for 4 pieces was a lil more than i expected. The nachos and salsa they serve in the beginning for free is pretty good.
2011-06-17,5,My jersery friends are always ranting about this place so when I took a trip up there last month we went for happy hour/dinner and OMG they have the best frozen margarita's ever!!!! I am not a fan of flavored margarita's but I had their strawberry frozen one and OMG delish I loved it! The food was very good too! Def recommned this place to anyone in the area. Its a little small but great place to drink and catch up with friends. :) Oh and did I mention they have great happy hour specials if your on a budget!
2011-06-09,4,This place is always PACKED!  The margaritas really do pack a serious punch.  On Tuesday's they offer buy an entree and get one free.  Starting out with their chips and salsa (A+).  Sometimes I just stop by and buy their chips and salsa to take back to my apartment because they are so addicting and good.  The taco salads and quesadillas are great.  That's the only thing I've had in there and I've been there over 30 times.  When I find something good, I feel no need to change it up.  I will eventually try other food on their menu, but until then, see you Tuesday East La!  Or Monday, $5 Margaritas ;)This place is never hurting for business.  They get so busy and sometimes you have to be patient and wait, but when you have a pitcher of margaritas and chips and salsa at your table...what's the rush?!  This place sells itself.  I recommend!
2011-05-23,1,Put our name in for a table.  Waited patiently.  When asked how much longer, was told we were next.  Then watched an older couple seated.  When I politely asked the hostess what happened, she told me they were regulars and allowed to skip the wait.  This was after an almost hour wait!  Needless to say, I won't be a regular.  The attitude on the hostess was awful.
2011-05-14,2,ONLY PLACE TO SEE PAY PER VIEW FIGHTS IN HOBOKEN!!!!Drinks....idkFood.....idkWent there to see Mosley get pounded by Pacman it was awsome. $10 cover fee.
2011-04-18,1,The food was over cooked...vegtables were fr a frozen package...fajita {steak} was over cooked...gordam ramsey would have had a feild day..my daughter was celebrating her 12th bday and they brought a bad bad flan..which she doesn't even like..then charged us for it.  Magaritias were good...
2011-03-31,4,Great food,friendly waiters,good beer and margarita selection. The bar area could use some security.
2011-03-30,3,Being a native Texan, I'm seriously on a mission to find the best mexican food joint in the tri-state area. Slowly, but surely, it will be done.Okay, my review. Well, we (my native new yorker boyfriend and me) started with chips with salsa and guac. Chips were stale (waa-waa-waa), but guac and salsa were fine (yay). I bought the 'mexican tacos' - half chicken, half steak. They weren't bad actually. I'm pretty picky about beans and rice (only like my grandma's and my dad's), but the corn on the rice was a cool twist. The margaritas were yummy, as the reviews stated. I was a little apprehensive before tasting mine because I saw a margarita machine. Usually the margaritas from those things never seem strong enough. But they were definitely strong. It was quite a cold day, so my frozen marg. took awhile to drink (brain freeze). Our ticket for my taco plate, his fajitas, and 4 margaritas was $60. Not the cheap i thought i heard about, but I would consider going again, maybe just for the drinks though.
2011-03-23,3,Two words: lots of margaritas.The margaritas are probably the best thing here and they come in a wide variety of flavors.  There's also a modest beer selection that focuses on styles south of the border.The food here is standard Mexican fare and they do it pretty well.  I've never been disappointed by their quesadillas.  The best night is Tuesday when Yuenglings and entreÃÅes are buy one get one free.The bar is small, so I wouldn't recommend it for a night out one the town.  However East LA is definitely a good dinner spot.
2011-03-15,2,Great drinks, lousy food, have a few frozen margeritas and the lousy food tastes ok.
2011-03-12,2,East LA ... you've been here for so long, and yet I rarely visit.  And when I do, I learn why I don't come here (sans the first time where you were decent).Hmm ... the high points of my time here.  Hanging out with my friends ... hanging out with my friends ... can I come back to this later?Everything else: Service went from good to meh to really meh.  He dropped off food, and almost ceased to exist until check time.  Food was not very good at all or at least my meal wasn't.  Steak was extremely grizzly, tasted like shoe leather, missing whatever sauce that was supposed to be with it, mediocre rice, and the plate contained an abundance of beans, which I asked not to include at all.  It must have been opposite day.Back to the high points: The chips were decent.  My friend's meals looked decent.Tonight, I was not impressed at all.  I hope it's not always like this, because if it is, I wonder how they're still here, and a place like Flacoz Tacoz (which tasted really good in my opinion), goes out of business.
2011-03-09,1,First time I went here the waitress forgot to give our order to the kitchen. We had to wait 2 hours for food but got two free pitchers of sangria. Frustrating, but I'll forgive mistakes especially when there are free drinks involved.This time, we got our food right away only mine had pieces of broken glass in it. We got a free meal and drinks, but no amount of free anything will make me return to a place where I nearly cracked a molar and swallowed pieces of glass. Sorry, East LA, but that's unforgivable.
2011-03-08,3,The margaritas here will knock you on your behind! Even flavored, they are still super strong! They have a wide variety of flavors, though, which is cool. The taquitos are my fave. I have also tried the shrimp tacos which were ok. I'd usually just stick with the apps, chips and salsa. The noise level can get insane in here. It's a little hard to hold a convo inside. it's rather small so the wait can be severely long on a weekend. I wouldn't say it's worth waiting an hour for, but it's cool if your having a night out and can get in with no problem. There's also outdoor seating in the summer.
2011-02-24,4,I've been here many times over the years and I'm always happy to come back.The margaritas taste great and as far as potency goes... well,  "One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, floor" definitely holds up here.I always enjoy my Suburban Quesadilla or the Camerones Sotovento and the service is always great.
2011-02-02,2,Been here many times. Go here for the drinks only. Their margaritas will put you on your a$$. The frozen ones are my favorite. The food is not worth it unless you are really hungry or need to compose yourself after drinking the limit of three margaritas. Yes, there is a limit and good reason for it. Packed during happy hour.
2011-01-16,5,The steak quesadillas were banging also the lemon drop shots get you fucked up they are the best lol i would definately go back to this place
2010-12-23,3,Decent price for decent food with large portions.On Mondays they've got half-price appetizers and $5 margaritas. This makes for a pretty cheap meal. As for margaritas, you can make some fun and exciting (or terrifying) flavors by mixing their options, just ask Julia!Not the best Mexican food in Hoboken, but it's not too bad. Stay away from the buffalo wings, these aren't their specialty. I made that mistake once. Never again...never again!
2010-12-21,4,Better late than never, but they have $5 margarita specials for Monday Night Football!
2010-11-01,4,I have been here 3 times.  The first time was the absolute best.  The server was excellent!  The food amazing.  The other two times, the food is always very very good.  The service needs some help though.  I had a few different servers the last time I was there, with that many servers you would think we would have had great service, but we didn't.  I will go back for the food.
2010-10-07,2,Good food, lousy service. Our server never brought us our margaritas, so cant even rate them.
2010-10-04,1,HOR-REN-DOUS! You would think I would learn my lesson after the 1st go around. Maybe I thought "it can't be any worse than last time". I was mistaken. It was indeed worse! I cannot understand how this place survives. The food is God awful! I nearly threw up when I had the chicken. The guac was terrible. The service is non existent. Avoid at all costs...
