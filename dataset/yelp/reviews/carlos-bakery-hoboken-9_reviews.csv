2021-11-05,1,Carlos gets one star only because the counter attendant was very polite and helpful.  Place should get zero stars actually.  This place has to go though.  I've tried their pastry multiple times and it is never great and sometimes isn't that good.  Lack of flavor, stale, poorly made are a few ways of describing the product.  Recently, I was in a rush and had to use them for a cheesecake to bring to a party.  I was mortified when I was told that it flavorless cheesecake filling on a very stale crust.  What really irks me is the marketing and branding of the business.  They position themselves as a pastry authority with the credibility of the food network and other celebrity ploys.  They also certainly invest heavily in marketing and promotion to basically pass the lie to a potential consumer that you are going to get a remarkably good product.  Don't be deceived; this place is trash.  They just want your money
2021-11-04,1,I am turning 50 this year and one of my requests was to have a special cake made. It was of the first comic book I ever read, with two of the characters rising out of it in three-dimensions. I tried to get this type of cake done for my 40th at another cake place and they dropped the ball too (You can see the review I left for them if you search through my reviews). This time we decided to go with what we thought was the best--Carlo's Bakery from CAKE BOSS.We started the process in June. My wife contacted them and left a message saying that she wanted a cake to be delivered for my party in NYC in November, and the parameters we needed. The endless cycle of phone/email tag begins. We didn't get in contact with them until August. AUGUST! They tell us they can't do the design we wanted due to licensing issues. Fine. I draw up an alternate design based on the original concept without licensed characters. We sent it in on late September. Once more, the phone/e-mail tag began. It wasn't until early October until they confirmed they received new design. Then it was weeks more of playing tag to confirm that they would be able to do the cake (Turned out way back in June, the person my wife talked to wrote down our phone number wrong). Late October, a couple weeks before the event, we finally got more details. The body of the cake would look like a stack of comics and cost $450. On the top main cake, the only thing they would do is screenprint my rough design. Each figure would cost $250-300. The entire cake would be over $1000. And they couldn't deliver it. We had to pick it up. Now, that one is on us. Their website says pick-up options only, but we never noticed because  we have seen them deliver on their show. We began to discuss options about how to pick up the cake, which would be a chore, when they sent us another e-mail, a week and a half before the event. They said the baker who does figures might not be available  and told us they didn't think they could do the sculptures for the cake. The sculptures were the main reason why we went to Carlo's and the most important part of the cake. If we just wanted a cake with just an image screeenprinted on it, we could go to Wegman's and get one  or two there for far less money. Finding this out this close to the event was a major bombshell and threw us into a panic. Carlo's made us feel that they didn't care about making our cake at all. The customer service was beyond poor--we shouldn't have to chase down a vendor to pay them $1,000. It seems to me that they don't have to try anymore because they are so famous. Find another a place for your cake, like we have to do now.
2021-11-01,3,I'm not really sure what the hype is here - I saw tons of people taking photos in front of the bakery and was just confused. My sister said it was famous and looking here on Yelp, it looks like the owner was on Cake Boss? Anyways, I had a Rainbow Fudge Cake slice and it was just ok. The cake was pretty moist, but I didn't think it was anything special. The fudge frosting was good, but it really did not need the sprinkles on the side. Service was fine and efficient.
2021-10-31,5,Fun to see the original location. Little on the pricey side, good baked items. Street parking only. Nice staff
2021-10-30,5,Love their pastry the reservation process was nice and smoothly!!!! Anthony who helped my cake reservation very nice and professional!
2021-10-19,1,I am very disappointed with my order. I cannot believe for $50.00 the small amount of cookies I received.  Someone is making a lot of profit off of customers.  And I mean a lot.  Shameful that a bakery could charge so much.  There are photos attach with the my hand to show how small the packages are that I received ...and again for $50.00. Most were cookies with sprinkles that probably cost 20 cents each to make. Live and learn
2021-10-08,5,Delish. Service is good and prompt. They sell prepared packs of cupcakes and cookies for gifts. Can't wait to make more friends by sharing Carlos' Cake Boss goodies back in SoCal. A real treat for them.Carlos' also sells their own recycled bags that may make a modest gift for somebody.
2021-10-03,5,Rainbow surprise cake was a huge hit for my daughters birthday party. Still talking about it months later. We shipped with Goldbelly from NJ to CA and it was
2021-09-27,3,Like so many others, we came here just because of the show. We're traveling in our RV around the US, and we plan on visiting iconic places, and places that mean something important to each member of our family of 5. Someone really wanted to visit this bakery, and I'm glad she got it, but honestly, we wouldn't come back. Next time we're in NJ, we'll visit other bakeries. It's extremely overpriced, overrated, we try local bakeries everywhere we go, and I can assure you, these baked goods aren't better than at any other bakery. We tried the cannolis, they didn't taste fresh made, and I understand, they're hard to keep fresh whenever you get there, but for being an expensive, fancy, tv featured cannoli, I was expecting more. Same with the almost $8 tiny lemon tart, chocolate cheesecake (my daughter liked it but for the price, I can make something similar at home or get a bigger one somewhere else). We tried the M&Ms cookies, I should have gotten a couple of those, and a couple cupcakes and nothing else. We bought a couple cupcakes that looked pretty, but they were not outstanding. For the price, I would recommend to go to a different bakery and just get your picture taken outside this shop. By the way, it's really easy to get here from NYC by subway.
2021-09-19,2,Very overrated spot. The lobster tails were amazing, the three cakes I tried were so bland and lacking. The cannoli wasn't great. Overall wouldn't go again.
2021-09-12,5,You want the one of the best Italian Deserts ever, this is the spot in Jersey or New York . Can't go to New York and not stop here. It's a must.
2021-09-10,3,Normally, I'd give Carlos a 4 star but unfortunately not today. I ordered a slice of rainbow cake for my kid and I received this chocolate cake with no frosting and a piece missing. Now either the driver licked off all the icing and took a piece of cake for himself or Carlos has got to do a Better job of cutting their cakes and packing their desserts.
2021-09-08,1,We spent $100 ordering a cake (by mail) for my son's birthday party. Carlo's couldn't ship it because of severe weather (understandable) but then they refused to refund the order even though they hadn't made the cake and wouldn't be able to make it in time for the agreed date. They literally made the cake four days after my kid's birthday and mailed it to us then. Thanks for the $100 extra birthday cake -- never ordering from here again.
2021-09-08,1,Early ordered birthday cake with promised delivery date arrives 5 days late. Cancellation email has been ignored by staff and cake was going to be shipped. They sent explanation email that cake has been shipped already even if shipping label has just been created. Greediness, lack of customer care and understanding ! Who needs birthday cake five days after birthday celebration???
2021-09-07,3,Overpriced bakery. I had their cannolis and lobster tail. Both were edible, but nothing special. There are tons of good bakery in Hoboken, like the German Bakery I will recommend people go there instead.
2021-08-25,1,Today, I went in to pick up a birthday cake a friend had given me a gift card purchased online and I went in to get my cake. I was told that the gift card cannot be used for in-store pick ups and I could not get my cake for the party that I'm having tonight. I'm pretty upset about it he purchased it for me overseas and nowhere does it say the gift card is only for orders but online can you check his receipt out I need up having to order the cake which is more expensive than picking it up in the store and have it delivered two days after my birthday on Friday. The manager said there was nothing she could do even though they had already written my name on the cake. I am not sure what can be done but it seems like a total miss use of the gift cards
2021-08-18,1,i was so sorry, I had traveled a lot to try the most famous hoboken candy and we were very disappointed. terrible, its taste was saved, hard
2021-08-18,5,Amazing!!! We are from Pittsburgh, PA and I been watching buddy's shows for YEARS! the cake stands up to his name. I am so glad I was able to try it
2021-08-18,5,I unfortunately do not live in New Jersey but I did order some of their food for my birthday. The cake was very exquisite and the cannolis were very sweet. To top it all off all of the food was very well decorated!
2021-08-12,5,It was my best friend's birthday, I went to Hoboken and pick up a cake for him. The lady in the shop was super nice and asked me whether I need to write happy birthday on the cake, I said yes!
2021-08-08,5,AMERICANA CAKECarlos Bakery is very famous for their lobster tails and cannolis but their cakes are just as good or even better!!!!Known as their patriotic cake, with alternating red, white, and blue layers filled with sweet vanilla buttercream icing and covered with Red, White, and Blue sprinkles, this "Americana" cake was just perfect and extremely delicious!!!!!The cake itself was pretty moist and the frosting was perfectly sweetened which made the perfect pair altogether. And not to mention how colorful and perfect this cake is for any summer event, whether it be bbqs, parties, Memorial Day, etc. So if you haven't checked out Carlos Bakery you may just want to get yourself a slice of their cakes or even an entire cake just to treat yourself!!!!
2021-08-03,1,It's sad because it's such a good show and we love buddy and were so excited to go but as good as the show is good the desserts are bad.  Buddy needs to up his game. Desserts at any Corner market are better. It's literally the first time my kids didn't finish a dessert. Seems just like a big TV marketing machine selling crap to make money.  Why not sell great desserts?? Makes no sense.
2021-08-02,5,I was there this morning for a delicious lobster roll I highly recommend it! I am such a big fan of the show and I was not disappointed the people were very nice and helpful. You will love it there! I even bought a shirt LOL
2021-07-31,5,Went to the original Hoboken store and wanted to try everything. My 2 personal favorites were the lobster tail which was nice and flakey with the right amount of stuffing and rainbow cake which was not too sweet and had perfect balance with frosting and cake. The cake balls were very doughy for me but were worth a try and of course have to try the cannoli, which tend to be too sweet for me generally but a bite here and there is not bad.
2021-07-18,1,Absolutely Overrated I was at the Hoboken Location on July 18..at 11:30am,how can  you not have any salted caramel Lobster tails???,just having plain..So I bought a box of four,filling was good,the shell was very soft no crunch,tasted old....Never Again....
2021-07-17,3,Got delivery from heee for dessert the other night . The cannoli was absolutely delicious! Also tried the red velvet cake and it was ok . I would definitely recommend the cannolis!
2021-07-11,1,Horrible poor excuse for Italian pastries. Carlos not all that.  He couldn't make it in Red Bank NJ.  His excuse was people there just dont get it.  A great bakery opened in the same location and the deserts are amazing.  Big deal if you can build any cake shape if it tastes horrible.
2021-06-28,4,Who wants to eat some cake?I haven't been watching Cake Boss like I should due to momma hood.  When we were heading back to Newark to fly out, we had time to pop in for a sweet snack before going to the airport.  There wasn't a line when we got there at 10:30 a.m., but there was a group of 20 people that came in shortly after us.  The bakery offers anything you can imagine.  I went for a rainbow cake for us to share and our kids split a M&M cookie.  The prices are a little on the high side and it's understandable since it's paying for the company itself.  There is even nationwide shipping if you want to send some sweet love in a package.We were able to get ahead in the line since the staff saw we were there before the crowd arrive since we weren't ready with our order.  They got our items to us and thanked us for coming in.  While we were outside on a bench eating our treats, I saw Mauro and Grace (two family members on Cake Boss) walk in to start their daily routine.  You'll notice them in a picture I took and it was so nice to see them off the television being normal people.
2021-06-26,5,From the moment we booked the trip to NYC, my daughter begged us to go to the Cake Boss's Bakery. Since we stayed in Jersey City it was a no brainer. So glad we did.  Everything was AMAZING. My wife is a Cannoli connoisseur and she was thoroughly impressed. The filling was firm with a light sweetness. The carrot cake had the perfect blend of flavors. The cookies and cream was chocolate heaven.  The m and m cookie, just like the cakes was moist and delicious. If you're in Hoboken...GOOOOOO!!!
2021-06-24,5,I enjoyed my cannoli! It was filled all the way through unlike some other places. The staff was also friendly.
2021-06-18,3,My son and I are big fans of the show and I've always wanted to visit the original bakery. I had a hunch the family no longer works in the bakery given their success, but was still disappointed nonetheless. I'm only rating this 3 stars because of the food quality. I was pretty disappointed when biting into my cannoli and tasting "old" filling. I'm Italian, I've had many cannolis. This should have been fresh but it tasted like the cream was on the verge of going bad. We also got cheesecake which tasted a bit soured as well. My son got a lobster tail. The cream was good but the pastry itself was very dry (dryer than what this flakey pastry should have been). I haven't tried the cupcake yet. While watching the success of a small business grow into a multimillion dollar empire has been fun, and I still enjoy the show, I don't think I'll ever come back or order from any of the bakeries in the future. The quality of food isn't what it should be for a bakery of this stature, in my opinion.
2021-06-14,1,June 13, 2021 around 7:30pm, I asked the staff if they had any sugar free products which I have seen in PLENTY of bakeries and the staff on duty started to laugh me! I expected so much more from such a famous bakery. I will not be returning.
2021-06-06,4,I've tried Carlo's at other places but haven't been to their own location. There is a great selection of baked goods all on display with a menu board with all the pricing listed out. Ideally I'd like the price signs next to the actual items so there's less looking back and forth, but it's nice when things are listed.I only got the chocolate covered cannoli since it seems like a unique item. It had a nice crunchy chocolate shell and filled with a sweet cream. It was delicious, but at $5.25 it's a little expensive for a treat. I like the selection of baked items,  but yes it's on a more pricey side vs. other places. It's near the park with a view of NYC and near the Hoboken train station. A nice stop in the area and can take the goods to a scenic view. The staff was helpful and prompt. Nice for a splurge.
2021-05-31,5,Perfect cake for our small 30TH birthday celebration. I have been wanting to try their rainbow cake and I couldn't think of a better reason than my 30TH birthday.  It was shipped frozen and on dry ice, packed in a box and a cooler. It arrived on time and intact. It was very moist and had great flavor. And who wouldn't love the fun bright colors?! It was enough to feed our family of 6 with enough left for breakfast the next day too.
2021-05-11,1,If this place can get a negative 1 review.. I'd give it a negative 1 review.  Overrated is also the word that comes to mind.  Pre Corona I have always wanted to try this place but never did because it was always packed with a long line of tourists.  Today no line because of Corona and because no tourists.    Bought 1 strawberry classic cheesecake, oreo chocolate cake and a lobster tail.  I could not believe it.. $27 bucks down the drain.  All 3 desserts were the worst desserts we have ever eaten. The chocolate oreo cake had frosting that was very salty.. like the frosting was not mixed all the way. I got a huge taste of salt. The cheesecake tasted more like a cheese mousse..and tasted very cheap.. u know like a gas station off brand cheap. Or soup kitchen food cheap.  The lobster tail shell was so hard and crunchy like it was made 3 days ago. It probably was made 3 days ago!!!! How the heck did this place get so well known?? Probably people from a fly over state who sees it on television and have not many dessert choices back home come here and think this place is good just because it's on television. I'm still in disbelief as I type this review.  Would rather eat no dessert at all!!!!!
2021-05-08,4,They have a good amount of things to choose from. Today,I came in specifically for their salted caramel came, but it was discontinued. However,I must say thag the staff was nice and tried to offer suggestions but nothing spoke to me. The shop was nice and clean and the staff was friendly.
2021-05-07,1,Very Disappointed! I ordered the Strawberry rainbow cake, through Goldbelly, as a gift for my mother. The cake came thawed with no sign of dry ice. It tasted old and stale, as if it were week old cake. It crumbled when we cut it. I was embarrassed. We each ate one slice and threw the inedible cake in the trash. Horrible experience!
2021-05-04,1,I ordered a red velvet cake for my daughter's birthday from Carlo's bakery through Goldbelly.com.  The cake was scheduled for delivery on Friday 4/30/2021.  The cake arrived on that date at 7:15 pm and was promptly brought inside within 10 minutes.  The cake was packed in a cardboard box, and inside the box was a styrofoam cooler.  Inside the cooler was a bag that should have contained dry ice, and my cake.  The cake was completely melted, and there was minimal water left in the dry ice bag.  My daughter's birthday celebration was Saturday. There was obviously no time to have a replacement shipped.  That left me running around like a mad person late Friday night and early Saturday morning trying to find a replacement. I'm not sure if the bakery just forgot to add the dry ice to the bag or what, but the cake was a waste, and with goldbelly.com, all sales are final, and I'm out $70.  They issued me a credit, of which I'm scared to use at this point based on my initial experience.
2021-04-27,1,Absolutely overrated. Majority of the products aren't even made on site. One of the worst cannolis  I've ever had. Don't waste your time on the hype
2021-04-25,5,Ordered the rainbow cake and a variety of cupcakes. Delivery was on time and everything was exceptional
2021-04-14,5,I bought a cake that looked really good on Goldbelly's website.  It came from Carlo's Bakery.  I had NO IDEA that is the bakery of Buddy Valastro -Cake Boss. Anyway, the cake arrived timely and well packaged.  I bought the black and white cake and a fudge cake.  I love sweets and buy cakes/pies/cookies online often, hoping to find something dependable I can use as my go to for special ocassions and holidays.  This black and white cake was FABULOUS.  The actual cake itself was really really good - choc and vanilla alternating layers with chocolate filling...really excellent. Icing was not overly sweet and it was just really a pretty cake.  Haven't opened the fudge one yet. Hope it's just as good.  Having baked a gazillion cakes in my lifetime I know what it costs using good ingredients.  It's NOWHERE near 70 which is what this cake cost.  But Lord it was good.  If you buy a cake, buy two, that actually brings the cost down to 50 each.  But my family thinks I'm nuts to spend 50 on a regular cake.
2021-04-05,5,I had this cake delivered for my beloved brother's birthday. Everyone LOVED it + said it was delicious! An Italian family from NJ who recognizes quality! I saw so many concerning reviews that turned out to be inaccurate. Everyone reported the cake was unbelievably moist and fresh, it arrived on a Friday, on time & served yesterday on Wednesday. A work of art! Several people are already planning to purchase it for family and friends. Obviously it's a sweet cake as there is icing on every side with sprinkles and in between each layer. If you are a person who prefers only a little frosting this cake is not for you. If you love frosting, this is your cake. It was a true hit! Grateful I trusted my gut. It all worked out PERFECTLY! Thank you Buddy @ Carlos' Bakery + Goldbelly for their phenomenal service! Mange!
2021-04-03,4,Coming here was a childhood dream, as I'm sure it was/is for everyone else. The workers were very nice and we lucked out with our timing (we were able to just walk in and order). I'll be honest the cake was about a 2/5 ... the cannoli and lobster tail was 4/5. Those three came out to a total of $19. It was great to see this place in person. I would recommend coming here if you are staying in NY or NJ.
2021-03-30,1,I lived in Hoboken and grew up in New Jersey. When I first visited the bakery in 2011, I was impressed by the Italian pastries and cookies. Very authentic. Fast forward to yesterday. We took the kids to the famous spot to get a treat. The old school look is updated and one counter, which contained all the Italian cookies sold by pound is gone. Now they sell cake by the slice, cupcakes and limited cookie option. Another Italian bakery bites the dust.
2021-03-28,5,Super yummy cake, cannoli and lobster tails! We had to be in New Jersey for medical reasons (we're from Idaho) so we HAD to visit Carlo's Bakery and get pictures. They did NOT disappoint. Delicious!!
2021-03-23,3,We picked up a 6" inch rainbow cake after seeing it on Goldbelly. I was honestly very disappointed, I suppose I was expecting so much more. The cake is dry and flavorless, there is so much heavy buttercream frosting that even a frosting lover like myself was overwhelmed. If you're going for the rainbow cake, turn around and go somewhere else, this is not worth it.
2021-03-19,5,The lobster tails were amazing. The cannoli was okay.
2021-03-17,3,Couldn't leave Jersey without visiting the famous Carlo's Bakery! We went during the week later in the day, so there was no line (thank goodness!). I was surprised that the also served regular food, pizza of course. But we were definitely there for the sweets! I was anticipating there being much more of a selection of goodies, but maybe I was just being greedy....I guess it was sufficient. You had your option of a couple of cookie options, three or four cakes, cannolis, about three different cupcakes, a few cheesecakes, and a couple more items.We decided to grab some red velvet cake and chocolate mousse cheesecake. They were both on point. Not sure if I'd be rushing to go back, but can say we made it there. Didn't see Buddy, but got the sweet tooth satisfaction we needed.
2021-03-13,5,Ordered a rainbow cake through Goldbelly. The cakes arrived on time, beautifully packed and was still frozen when it arrived. It defrosted in 3 hours, per instructions, though probably another 30 minutes or so would have been better since the icing and middle layers were still cold. The cake was delicious -- basically the platonic ideal of a birthday cake. Generous buttercream frosting. Beautiful to look at and fun to eat. Also, definitely not something I'd make at home, as the rainbow layers are such a pain. I combined a BOGO offer with a Chase credit card discount to purchase 2 cakes for $60, which included the cost of shipping. I think it was a pretty good price for two cakes, but would probably consider that price pretty steep for just one cake. A nice way to celebrate a special occasion.
2021-03-12,4,Standard, Goldbelly can ship it and honestly it's a solid 4 because it's always consistent and festive! Is it my fav? Hell no (I don't love eating food coloring) but I've had this cake both fresh from the shop and shipped and it's good. The most well known rainbow cake is super heavy and thick so it's great to share. Haven't tried any other desserts in a while but they can be pricey. Ps. I believe the offer still stands when the line is long, if you live in Hoboken you can cut the line! Win!
2021-03-12,1,Updating my reviewing can I give negative stars? $16 for two slices of cake and BLEGH! dried out, totally inedible! This place is such a scam it's really such a shame they used to be good but my god what a sell out. $8 for a piece of crappy cake? You can get actually GOOD cake in the city for half the price. That guy is such a loser
2021-03-11,5,Goldbelly review, we purchased a vanilla sprinkle cake, strawberry cake, lobster tails, rainbow cookies,and Italian butter cookies for a birthday.  Paid extra for shipping to ship on one of the non ship days, it arrived on time, with instructions.  It was frozen and in great shape, two bags of dry ice were still frozen.  Unpacked everything and it shipped perfectly. The next day we finally got to bite into everything. It was all so good, my husband said he will crave the rainbow cookies.  My favorite was the cake the vanilla cake is perfect I'm plain so the taste was great and the cake was beautiful.  The strawberry cake was equally delicious I know it's not fresh strawberries but it tasted like fresh strawberries plus it was nice to look at.  Everything we received exceeded our expectations.  A million times yes we will purchase from here again.  We had a great experience!
2021-03-07,3,This is my third trip to Carlo's bakery. Typically I only come to bring friends that are visiting who want to see the cake boss shop. There always appears to be people inside (roughly 5 on average) and the wait is short (5 minutes max).Even though it is never too crowded I always feel rushed here. I would recommend knowing what you want to order before walking in. I've ordered the cupcakes a few times and really they are nothing special. There is a lot of buttercream icing on top, so if you like icing these cupcake are for you!Overall, just ok. There are better bakeries in Hoboken.
2021-02-25,5,Original bake shop. Super clean. I picked up lobster tails and cannoli's along with some chocolate cake.  I've had better cake before, it was my first time trying cannoli's so I didn't have anything to compare, but the lobster tails were definitely my fave over everything. Puff crips pastry filled with a vanilla cream.
2021-02-15,1,So disappointed. Ordered the Rainbow Cake and Chocolate Fudge Cake they were selling on Goldbelly. They had a funny taste to them like they were frozen too long. Very sad. My grandkids were really looking forward to those cakes.
2021-02-12,4,This place is BOSS!  On a visit to NYC, we just had to stop into this iconic bakery!  The line to get in was LLLOOONNNGGG! Literally, blocks away... did we wait? You bet!  Did this sweet shop live up to the hype? Yep!  The sugary aroma once we entered was intoxicating.  Even though the place was packed, we got our turn to order and we stocked up!  My favorite confection was the gloriously divine lobster tail pastry!  The flaky, buttery dough, the creamy, delicious custard, the light powdered sugar... all amazing!! Worth the trip!If you have the patience of Job, and the appetite of Cookie Monster, you'll be happy you stopped by this busy, exciting and delectable bakery! It takes the cake!
2021-02-02,2,I found it a bit overrated. I really love bakeries, and having a slice of cake is such a rare looked forward to treat in my house! As we just moved to JC from NYC, we decided to give Carlo's a try. I wouldn't say it was bad...but it wasn't really very good either. We had a slice of the rainbow cake and a slice of vanilla and it just was meh. The slices were way too big. I much rather see a normal sized piece of cake done really well with great flavour etc, than have a giant piece that doesn't taste very nice. Quite frankly, it tastes "store made". The frosting is too sweet, and the cake doesn't taste like anything really. Pretty disappointed, as I know it's a "world famous bakery" but it doesn't taste homemade or what I would expect from a bakery with that status.
2021-01-19,1,I live in LA and I was trying to order a cake through Postmates for my friend who lives in New Jersey. I called and spoke to Gianni/Giani(?) on 1/19 at around 11AM (2PM EST) - not sure if I was given a real name. I wanted to get some clarity about the cake-writing process, especially because there was a lack of instructions through Postmates. Additionally, if I was going to pay $70+ for a cake, I wanted to have my questions answered before I commit to it.Gianni sounded very upset and annoyed with my questions, and in a hurry to get off the phone with me. I felt unsettled with the phone call and decided to order from another bakery nearby. Please be kind to your potential customers.
2021-01-18,3,Purchased cake from gold belly and shipping and arrival was excellent.  The cake was very moist but the butter cream was too thick and too sweet.
2021-01-13,5,First time ever trying treats from Carlos Bakery. I was impressed! The lobster tail was divine- it was crispy and buttery and the filling was luscious! The cannoli cream was thick and had great cheese flavor. We also got a few slices of cake- rainbow, carrot, chocolate and piecaken. The chocolate  cake was rich and I'd say one of the best I've ever had! The piecaken was really cool and not overly sweet!
2021-01-07,1,I ordered two slices of the rainbow fudge yesterday from the bakery in Hoboken and it was a horror. I ate half a slice and later began vomiting and having diarrhea for the next 3 hours. Please be careful as it seems like they are not doing a good job with food safety as clearly my food was contaminated . I have never been this sick from any food before this incident.I will never recommend or order from Carlo's  bakery again !
2020-12-31,4,We'd gone to NYC for the holidays and had just made a stop for a delicious brunch in Hoboken, when I told my daughters we needed to stop at a bakery for some breakfast treats. And my husband's birthday was in two days. What did they find by Yelping? None other than the place of the Cake Boss! I was so excited. We choose several chocolate chip cookies, light and dark (chocolate covered) cannolis, a hefty slice of rainbow cake, and another hefty slice of red velvet cake. And of course, near the register they conveniently sold some candles. Our purchase even qualified for a free mug--how about that? Everything was wonderfully fresh and delicious. My only con observation was that I didn't really see anything yummy for breakfast treats, which is what lead us into the bakery, so instead, we adhered to Marie Antoinette's famous line of "let them eat cake." After all, this was the Cake Boss, right?
2020-12-22,2,So disappointed. I had ordered the 8 best seller slices on gold belly and seeing the reviews there plus having watched his show I was super excited to try it. Sure, it was pricey, but this was the cake boss, it would totally be worth it. I will say it arrived fast and on time and seeing it come in a Carlos bakery box was actually really exciting. The first flavor I tried was the cookies n cream and oh my god that was amazing, probably one of the best I've ever had. But that's where it ends. Over the next few days me and my dad tried the other flavors (chocolate fudge, chocolate rainbow, funfetti, strawberry rainbow, carrot cake, red velvet, and regular rainbow). The slices weren't that big to start off with but what was worse was the fact that the vanilla cake not only tasted like I could go to my local grocery store and get a slice there and it would taste the same but it left a coating in your mouth. The chocolate cake and the chocolate rainbow were okay, nothing special. I don't like carrot cake so I gave that to my dad and he said he loved it. I'm also not a fan of red velvet so I wasn't entirely impressed by it plus the frosting tasted really sweet. Now to the worst two. The regular rainbow has vanilla frosting but something about it left a nasty aftertaste and I wasn't sure where it came from. The one that was the worst, and made me the saddest because I love this flavor, was the strawberry rainbow. I was literally so excited to try this so I got my dad to try it with me. Not only was it super sweet but it was also sour? My dad said it tasted like cheese which I don't get but I thought I'd add it here. It was one of the worst things I've ever eaten. I'm so sad and upset that I spent money on something that I thought would be amazing only to find out I could go to my local grocery store and get the same experience
2020-12-20,3,Someone got a birthday cake from here and sent to my place! The cake looked very pretty however the butter cream was way too sweet. The sponge cake was very nice and fluffy but also sweet. I was having a sugar high after having a slice. It was a shame that I had to leave the butter cream behind.
2020-12-19,4,I've been lucky to always get into this shop when it's quiet. The food isn't cheap so I save it for special occasions, and visitors. However, I'm not normally a cannoli fan and I really like there's. I also really like their Italian rainbow cookies. I look forward to try more things once we can have visitors again.
2020-12-06,3,Finally spoke to someone with a brain. Thanks to Traci I am picking up 8 crumb cakes tomorrow. She is so pleasant and accommodating I've changed my review to 3 stars and may up to 5 stars when they are in my car lol. Please tell the staff to never say "we didn't get in the ingredients " dumber than dumb statement. Once again thank you Traci for putting a smile back on my face.
2020-12-03,1,Ordered a dozen cannolis and lobster tails,half arrived smashed. We submitted photo of the package and you could see the cannolis were damaged, they wanted more photos. We never received a replacement and we will never order again.
2020-11-27,5,Been a huge fan of this bakery since the TV show. I'm a regular at their Orlando bakery, but it's nice to come to the original when possible. Pasteries and cakes are amazing. This is a must stop for me whenever I'm in the area.
2020-11-13,5,If you are in NY make sure and grab the PATH train to Hoboken NJ and stop by Carlo's famous bakery! We took the Path from the WTC station and it only took about 12 minutes to reach the destination.The Bakery is a short walk from the station on Washington St. They are open during the pandemic and offer a variety of treats however some are not available yet and a mask is required. We ordered a plain and chocolate covered cannoli, a strawberry rainbow cake and cookies with some coffee and hot chocolate. They were all amazing and we were welcomed with warmth while visiting and placing  our order. There is a park called Pier A Park by the pier a short walk down First St from here where you can take in beautiful skyline views of NY while you enjoy your desserts from the bakery.
2020-11-03,5,Ordered Vanilla Rainbow cookies through Goldbelly.  They arrived on time and were packed in a sturdy cardboard box, containing a sturdier styrofoam box, containing *another* cardboard box with individually wrapped cookies.  The inside of the styrofoam box was packed with dry ice.  Wow.  The cookies are absolutely delicious--perhaps a little on the overly sweet side for some tastes, but I appreciate the strong flavor of vanilla!  Like the "black and white" cookies after which they are modeled, the frosting is on the flat side.  Anyone counting calories beware though; the calorie count given in the nutrition info is for half a cookie--can't imagine anyone stopping at half of one of these (or caring about calories if you've decided to eat one!)
2020-10-26,5,Heard about this famous cake on cake boss. Bought the biggest size and I'm glad I did. The cake was moist and the buttercream was delicious. Fun for celebrations but it may be too sweet for some people out there. It's important to let it sit out for 30 minutes before digging in!!!! Cake was very crumbly at first when I took it out the fridge but after 30 minutes it defrosted a bit and was perfect :) $99 well spent and thats pretty cheap for a cake of that size
2020-09-26,4,Carlo's is a treasure. They make my favorite cannoli in the county and they are consistent. There is a lot of hype when it comes to this spot but I promise that you won't be disappointed. We have tried most of their pastries and sweets and fell in love with certain ones, like: the cannoli, they use a different filling than most places. AND the lobster tail... a layered pastry filled with baileys flavored whipped cream and pastry cream. Oh man is it good. I would have given them 5 stars based on the food but objectively I have to mention that parking isn't great right there, (or really anywhere in Jersey) but it isn't the nicest area or ambiance. Carlo's is a little pricey for a bakery. I would venture to say it has something to do with their fame and growing success on food network and the like.All in all, go visit and enjoy. It is solid and definitely worth your time and a financial splurge every once in a while!
2020-09-06,4,Solid cakes and desserts from here. The cakes can get overwhelming because there is just so much frosting but their other items are really good too, like the tiramisu. Loved my birthday cake from here, it was a chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and chocolate chips.
2020-09-05,3,I spent most of my day at Liberty Science Center but since I was close to Hoboken, I decided to drive over to Carlo's Bakery. The bakery dates back to 1910 , when Carlo Guastaffano established it. Buddy Valastro's aka "The Cake Boss" father Bartolo bought the business in 1964. Since then the Valastro family have owned and operated the bakery.As a Realty TV Star, Buddy has specialized in wedding cakes, intricate sugar art and special occasion cakes. The rest of the family and employees run the affairs of the bakery.I bought the carrot cake which was moist but in my opinion overshadowed by the icing. I have had better carrot cakes but to some extent that is a matter of taste. If you like real sweet cakes you probably will like Carlo's carrot cake. The lobster tail at $5 was pricey but good. The French cream was spot on. The cappuccino was roasted perfectly. In summary, the items I had were good but i have to add that local bakeries in my area are just as good and on some items better.Carlo's Bakery is located on Washington Street just across the street from City Hall. The bars are great and there are many restaurants to choose from. If you are in the neighborhood , it is worth a stop by but I would not travel a great distance to come to Carlo's exclusively for baked goods like pastries, doughnuts, non-specialty cakes, danish or bread.
2020-08-23,2,The lobster tail was good! (5$ for one) On the other than, the assorted cookies box ($30) were made incorrectly. They used so much of one ingredient (which I can't quite place) that all the very different types of cookies - taste exactly the same! And not good! Wouldn't go again, unfortunately. Wish they cared about the quality of the shop more.
2020-08-23,1,Horrible service! I custom ordered a cake for an engagement/birthday surprise.  Went to pick up the cake for the day it was scheduled only to be told the cake is not there and it's scheduled for the next day!  Keep in mind I called the day before to make sure everything is in order and they confirmed to me that everything is good and the cake will be ready for pick up but that was a lie!They ruined the whole event! The whole theme was based around the cake!!Something that was supposed to be special was ruined because they simply didn't care enough to make sure they put down the right date! I wish I can give them zero stars!
2020-08-21,4,Omahgah RAINBOW CAKE!! With all the catastrophes and bad energy in the world right now, what I really wanted was a colorful dazzling sprinkle loaded cake for my birthday. Sprinkles Cupcakes came out with their rainbow layer cake last year for Pride month and again this past June, but it's only available one month of the year. What's a girl to do? Somehow, FB or IG heard my prayers and I saw an ad for Goldbelly featuring Carlo's Bakery! I remember watching Buddy Valastro on Cake Boss many years ago and enjoyed their imaginative and functional cake designs come to life from the hands of their cool and talented staff. Seems like a fun business team to be a part of. Anyone remember the Hot Wheels race car track made of cake??Carlo's Bakery has three kinds of rainbow cakes: original white vanilla frosted, chocolate fudge, and pink strawberry (which I sent to one of my besties for her bday last month). Each one comes fully rolled in multi color sprinkles! Check out the demo video on their IG to see 3 cakes constructed in 8 min. I heard vanilla frosting is the sweetest. I love chocolate so fudge for me! The cake is very dense as well but each colorful layer is pretty to look at! Bright and vibrant. I opted to get assorted individually packed slices to bring for work lunch because of virus restrictions. No sharing food at work, they say. The assorted 8 is extremely convenient and you can try multiple flavors! Add on an additional 8 slices for only $25 more! What a steal. I received 2 slices each of: vanilla rainbow, chocolate fudge rainbow, strawberry rainbow, carrot, red velvet, confetti, chocolate fudge, and cookies n cream. I had a slice of the latter, which I fondly call Oreo; that was amazing! Not as sweet as I expected. Dark chocolate cake layers with a crushed dark cookie buttercream. This was my favorite.I have to mention the small box of rainbow cookies I devoured. Swedish Princess cake is one of my favorites treats of all time and these Italian rainbow cookies composed of 7 precise layers of tricolored almond cake, raspberry & apricot jams, plus thin coatings of melted dark chocolate remind me of the yellow cake and light marzipan. It's all about the almond. Being from the West Coast, I had no idea rainbow cookies are a staple on the other end of the country. I've been to NY twice but didn't get to visit any local bakeries which I'm sure carry rainbow cookies and those round frosted black and white cookies. These are fairly small and you can eat a couple without feeling too bad. The 3"x5" box itself had 24 cute little cookies nestled inside its shrink wrap.Here in CA we have Sprinkles Cupcakes ATMs (mainly SoCal) but on the East Coast and parts of Canada they have Carlo's Bakery ATMs with rainbow slices available 24/7. Lucky ducks. Then again, I'd gain a whole lot of weight if we had those so never mind.Forgot to mention the cakes were packaged with dry ice and despite the almost 100 degree weather last week, the ice held up pretty well. The cake slices were still frozen. All I had to do was open up the 6" cake bag and remove the paper carton around the cake before placing it in the fridge.Order from Goldbelly and save $15-20 with coupon codes B3lly15 & Goldb3lly. Free shipping from Carlo's! Right now there's a sale for 2 cakes of your choice for $100. Check out the add ons and find yourself a new favorite. Lobster tails are NOT seafood but rather pastry horns filled with cream haha. Delivery was on time and the cakes shipped the night before from New Jersey! So cool to look at the interactive tracking map. My cakes travelled to Newark, NJ, stopped at Kentucky, then finally touched down at SFO before UPS drove it to my house.Rainbow cakes for smiles!
2020-08-18,4,A little pricey, but that's probably because of who they are. Cannolis are great, especially the chocolate ones. Also the mini cheesecakes were good as well.
2020-08-15,5,Damn you COVID! Because of you I had to cancel my lifelong dream of going to New York for an entire week and eating at every bakery I saved on Instagram! Well jokes on you because thanks to Goldbelly and these awesome eateries that partner with them I can enjoy delicous, amazing food from New York at the comfort and safety of my own home.The day I had to cancel my trip I was a disaster - go ahead roll your eyes, laugh, so what you gotta. I freaking LOVE New York but I wasn't about to risk myself or put others at risk just to go eat some cake. My adoring husband secretly overnights me cake from the number one spot on my list - Carlo's Bakery. He ordered me not one, but TWO 6-layer rainbow cakes. Now before you think this post is just me bitching about my failed trip and bragging about my one-of-a-kind hubby, I'll began raving about my cakes.It was everything I ever dreamed of. One look at the beauty that was the cake and I truly believed there was nothing better on this planet. So. many. SPRINKLES. On every inch of the cake there were rainbow sprinkles. It was painful having to wait 4 hours for the damn thing to thaw. I had to watch 2 entire movies to keep me entertained. Then the time came. I used the best knife I had, making sure to run warm water over it each time to get that perfect slice, and cut myself a piece of the cake I've been dreaming of trying since the first episode of Cake Boss. Ahhh it was so pretty! Every color of the rainbow in perfect order in edible fashion. I'm not going to like it was a lot more frosting then I selected - like a lot of freaking frosting. I almost hoped for more cake to even out the bites. Regardless, every bite I had of this damn thing was like being in New York. The best part? I have another whole entire cake in the freezer that I'm going dig into for my birthday! Call me dumb, call me stupid for raving about a "mediocre" cake that tastes nothing special but I'm just a small town girl with big city dreams so this was everything to me. Thanks Carlo's Bakery for exceeding all expectations even from 3000 miles away!
2020-08-08,1,Customer service is disappointing . I ordered something and they did not even explain me my question . Gave me the wrong thing and don't own up to their mistake .  Disappointing .
2020-08-02,1,Not the Carlos bakery that I know! Ordered a carrot cake for pickup for my moms birthday for this weekend. Cake was decorated very sloppy, not as shown on website. Worst yet when my mom went to slice into the cake, the carrot cake part crumbled everywhere. We were unable to serve slices to anyone. Rather we served spoons of carrot cake crumbles. Very embarrassing. I am highly disappointed as we have been getting birthday cakes here for all our special occasions but I am compelled to bo longer do so.
2020-07-31,2,Can't complain at all about Goldbelly.com. They fulfilled the order well. Had never used them before and they did deliver.My issue was with the cakes. I was sucked in by the BOGO offer for the rainbow cakes...sadly, the icing tastes terribly like cheap shortening and imitation butter flavoring. The sprinkles on the cake looked like ones you'd find on a discount rack, not large, extravagant jimmies I'd expect at this price point. Really disappointed. It wasn't horrible, just tasted very cheap, leaves a greasy coating on the palate after eating -  on par with a discount box store cake icing - and I would have preferred that to what was on this cake.  I should have known better as they do not list their ingredients anywhere online when I looked to see what the heck was in this cake.Not what I expected and sadly not worth the price at ALL. Doing my best to give slices away to anyone who will take it off my hands or the rest will end up in the trash. The 2nd one is in the freezer and will be taken to a friend's house whenever we see them next. Bummed about this purchase. Huge waste of money to not even enjoy it. Pretty cake when cut, but nothing to brag about, taste wise. My own cakes taste better than this and are decorated prettier!
2020-07-30,1,The cake came smashed and the ice around the cake had completely melted. Oh it also came a week after the date for the birthday. Reached out for a replacement and have gotten no response. Very overpriced for what we received. Shop local!!!
2020-07-26,5,I've always been a fan of cake boss and let me tell you it is just as good in person as it is on TV. The cannoli is my favorite. I've visited Carlos bakery in LA, Texas, and the original one in Hoboken New Jersey!
2020-07-25,2,Ok so I'm out and about and went to Paterson, NJ to see the historic water falls created by lava.  The falls were beautiful and I took many pictures.  Afterwards I knew I was close to Hoboken, NJ and always wanted to go to Carlo's Bake shop because I love the show.  The town is awesome and you could be there for a month and not hit all the restaraunts.  So i find the bake shop amd expected a long line to get in.  There was nothing so I called to see if they were open, which they were so I went in.  The shop is cute amd very clean.  However they only had one display case and the pastries were very very limited.  I was disappointed I wanted to see all the creations I wanted to feel the vibe of crowds.  I purchased because I felt I had to I literally was the only person in the store.  I bought 3 pieces of cake, 4 pack of cannoli's and some cookies.  Ready for this, $62.  The carrot cake was delicious but then again i have not ever had a bad piece of carrot cake.  All the pastries I purchased were good but so are other bakeries.  Sorry Buddy, not going to come back.  The hype from the show and the prices are not worth it.  I would not recommend due to lack of product and high prices.
2020-07-19,4,Well worth the trip from Detroit, MI. The canoli's were to die for and I can't wait to share with my family when I get home. Amazing and wish you shipped to Michigan. I wish their were labels on items and prices or a menu that would speed up the line.
2020-07-17,2,Every time I come to New Jersey I come here just to have the experience. When I came this time for my daughters first experience they were extremely rude. They did not offer me the free apron, were rushing me to order (I was the only customer in there). I feel like I have wasted $130 to a place that did not appreciate their customers. It made me feel really sad that my daughter experience the rudeness and attitude about helping customers. Probably won't recommend it to anyone coming to Jersey there are other small business own that will treat their customers with respect.
2020-07-13,3,I visited the Hoboken location while traveling to Jersey for work. Parking is sparse to non existent, so expect a walk. Staff very friendly. I ordered a Buddy's favorite box ($25)with cannoli's and two small lobster tails. Also ordered a chocolate chip cookie. The prices are high. Cannoli's delicious, shells crispy. Lobster tail french cream good but sweet and the dough was hard and chewier than I anticipated, but that was my first lobster tail pastry so maybe it's supposed to be that way? Cookie was good but not spectacular. Merchandise ridiculously expensive. $5 for a pen and $10 for a single subject notebook...
2020-07-05,1,I ordered their "Americana" cake for the 4th of a July, on July 3rd this is what was delivered. One could see on our Ring doorbell that I answered the door immediately, so it's not as if it was sitting out there. Since I was bringing dessert it put me in a bind to try and find something else last minute. Looked nothing like what I ordered.
2020-06-20,3,Loved the cake and cannolis. The taste is amazing. But Be careful to those who order from Carlos Bakery. We ordered a cake and 6 cannolis but only got 5 and like a quarter or a cannoli all broken up just thrown there. Thought it was just me but luckily someone I know ordered the same thing I did and she got 5 cannolis and a quarter if that of the 6th cannoli. They throw it in there all broken up and shit like whatever a 6th one doesn't fit so let's give them crumbs.
2020-06-07,5,We were there in December and loved it!  Have had treats before from the Vegas location but it was so fun to go to the main store, and there wasn't a line when we were there. Grace was working which was awesome and she was very nice.  The chocolate dipped cannoli is my favorite but everything we tried was good!  Quick bus ride to the shop, then spent the rest of the day walking around Hoboken - nice side trip when we were in NYC.
2020-05-22,5,Ordered their Chocolate Rainbow Cake slices on Goldbelly and what a treat! Came right on time. They were nicely packaged and each slice neatly cut and coated in sprinkles. I would recommend defrosting a little longer than the suggested 1 hour for the slices if ordering this way, they were a little too hard to eat still at that point. It doesn't have thick layers of frosting which was nice, so it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet like some frosting can be. The cake itself had a slight fruitiness to it, couldn't place the taste but it's layered vanilla cake. It's a very striking cake so if you want an easy showstopper for a birthday or celebration this is a good choice.
2020-05-22,5,If you want some Great tasting Cannolis this is the place, I live in California and usually buy from the one in Vegas but with this Virus going around nothing's open so i saw that you could order online and I did it got here within 2 days fresh and came with instructions on how to fill them yourself, one day I hope to come to the jersey store and see buddy but for now I'll continue to Vegas and get some every time I go as it is a must.
2020-05-22,5,On the website Goldbelly, I ordered the 8 piece sampler cake! Wow! It was awesome!! Would definitely recommend! Delivery was prompt and package was great!
2020-05-21,4,Received some goodies from here for Mother's Day.Hubs ordered through Goldbelly.com. Thank you B! Tried the Strawberry Pastel Rainbow Cake and Rainbow Cookies. Everything is neatly wrapped and your order comes with defrosting instructions. These baked goodies were delicious and a real treat. The frosting is on the sweeter side, but very flavorful. The cake is fluffy and all the pretty colors inside, makes it quite magical. What a sweet surprise. I'm so glad I got to try some baked goods from Carlo's Bakery. I enjoy watching the show Cake Boss.
2020-04-24,5,Ordered a strawberry rainbow cake for my sister's birthday via Goldbelly. Ordered on a Tuesday and received on a Friday - no delay even during COVID. Overall, very happy with the quality, taste and delivery to California. Will use again.
2020-04-18,2,I placed an order for their Cuban meat pies on Goldbelly. They came safely and neatly packed in dry ice and Styrofoam box. It was very tasty but I think somebody messed up and the meat pies were not sealed. If you look on the site, they're cooked meat pies have scalloped edges and are sealed tightly. However the first one I cooked completely exploded. Then I pinched, closed, and folded the edges over on the second one hoping to seal it but it still leaked a lot of oil. I think a step was forgotten when they were making the pies. It was disappointing and very messy.
2020-04-09,2,Are you kidding me? Everything looks good but it comes down to the taste. There are 3 better bakeries in Port Chester NY. They just are ok pastries. Maybe if there wasn't all the Buddy hype there wouldn't be any disappointment. We didn't have to wait on any line so I was ok with the lack of excitement in taste.My daughter lived in Hoboken within walking distance on the Hudson. Try the other bakeries first, then judge for yourself!
2020-03-20,3,Cannolis were definitely not what I had expected..(not my favorite) however the strawberry eclairs I could eat 10 of them I went back for more every time! A little pricey but I mean I get it it's very well known.
2020-02-27,5,This was our first visit to Carlo's bakery as I am a big fan of cake boss and buddy. The staff was really friendly and so were his sisters who were taking orders and cashing out. I asked if i can take a picture and they were so nice and sweet. The place has any kind of pastry you can imagine. It tends to get crowded so be prepared to stand in line for a bit but well worth the wait. I highly recommend this bakery.
2020-02-25,3,I recently visited on a Saturday morning, shortly after it opened for business. Parking was easy, avoided the Hoboken weekend crowd that likes to stroll the neighborhood, and I enjoyed eating my slice of Ricotta Cheesecake with their cup of joe in my car with a nice morning breeze. I'd visit again, but I wouldn't struggle looking for parking in Hoboken to have it.
2020-02-18,3,Though I'm not familiar with "Cake Boss" or the baker famous for Carlo's Bakery, we stopped in on our Saturday morning stroll down Washington Street to see what the Hoboken establishment had to offer. My interest in the rainbow cake waned when I learned it was made up of vanilla cake & vanilla frosting; a disappointment even when you know you're ridiculous for expecting mermaids & unicorns in each colorful layer. I've been on a strawberry shortcake kick lately. The one from Carlo's Bakery is chintzy on the strawberries & the cake in comparison to the portion of whipped cream. They've got quality control down to a science, as my slice seemed fresh, & I appreciate that no part of the cake was overwhelmingly sweet. I'd order this again if I were in the neighborhood & had a very specific craving. However, I'd skip their cookies if I were to come back, as the one I took to-go -- double chocolate -- had little flavor despite the copious amounts of visible white chocolate chips. An a-ok first visit.
2020-02-02,4,Carlos bakery although famous because of the show cake boss which attracts so many people to come there can be a total hit or a miss. Their Hoboken location is good but I've had a few up and down experiences there as well. However their locations/kiosks at malls have always been disappointing.There have been days everything was really fresh and then there were days stuff was questionable. I love their Italian cookies as they remind me of my childhood. I love marzipan and they're somewhat similar to marzipan I used to have over 20 years ago.Their cheesecake and lobster tails have been fresh on some days and stale on the other. Their chocolate cupcakes have been really good on one visit and average on the other. So over all not consistent. Friendly staff, cute bakery, too much going on though.I ordered my hubby's 29th birthday cake from them with a Pink Floyd theme and they did an outstanding job. The delivery was on time and it was a really good surprise for my hubby. The cake looked exactly as I had envisioned it and tasted fresh and just the way it should  -  AMAZING!
2020-01-21,4,I thought the food was delicious, prices are reasonable. Beautiful cake and pastry displays... fun, nostalgic, definitely check it out.
2020-01-19,3,This place was pretty good but there wasn't anything special about it. I came to see the OG store and ordered a few things. All were good but probably nothing extraordinary.
2020-01-16,4,Good place. This bakery would always be fulll! Long lines but the staff is very friendly. Prices are moderate. However, I was expecting a little bit more on the desserts, more tasty. Overall is good, not impressive.
2020-01-11,3,I'm really dreading to write such a terrible review for the person I grew up watching! Buddy is literally my idol, I looked up to him from day one & always wanted to become a pastry artist because of him and his team! It took me forever to get to this place!! I for some reason was picturing it to be how it used to be! But I guess because of all the game, he has renovated and looks so commercialized and chain-style. I was really hoping that it would've been traditional. There were 3 people behind the counter, we were helped very quickly and very efficiently. Upon looking at what they had to offer, there was nothing super special that caught my eye. I personally know that they are known for their cakes, their cannolis, and their lobster tails!! Can I say how devestated I was when I saw that the cannolis were already pre filled?!? ALL OF THEM!! That's literally a sin. I was so upset when I saw that!! We ended up getting a slice of rainbow chocolate cake, birthday cake, lobster tail, and a box of mini cookies. My total was $45!!!!!! What in the gods name?!?! The cookies alone were $20something, there is only 10 pieces for mini cookies. Everything tastes like a regular cookie or cake that you can get at stop & shop or any grocery...lots of sugar no flavor. The cookies were okay, simple. The lobster tail was very very hard and dry! Like I literally cried because I was so so excited to finally try Carlos bakery sweets, huge let down.
2020-01-08,2,Tourist Trap! These pastries lack both in quality and taste. There is nothing Italian or family owned here anymore. If you want good quality pastries and cakes for a decent price - go to any other place in Brooklyn or Staten Island! This place is for fans of the show and not true foodies.
2020-01-08,3,While I agree with many of these reviews, I have driven to NJ several times for his cannoli's! There is nothing like these, the best! But the cakes were terribly dry, so were the cookies. Seeing I can't afford to keep traveling to NJ, I decided I would order online! Are yiu freezing kissing me! The cost is higher and the shipping is ridiculous! Best of luck to you Carlos! I'll stay put here in CT.
2020-01-06,2,Truly not satisfied, the price is just not right and the bakeries are over rated. We had a chocolate chip cookie, lobster tail with hazelnut filling, and a chocolate covered cheesecake with a strawberry on top. The cheesecake was the best out of all 3, only if you take every bite with a piece of strawberry. I'd have to say subway subs has better cookies than this.
2020-01-02,5,Stopped here for a treat on our way into the city and were very happy! Parking was a little tricky but definitely worth the hassle! Cupcake icing was phenomenal! Also enjoyed the eclair! My personal favorite was the Cannoli! A little on the pricier side but I didn't mind as I enjoy experiencing local food when traveling.
2019-12-30,5,My sister and I used to watch Cake Boss allllll the time so when I finally went to Jersey for leisure I had to make this a stop. The bakery is busy but the line moves pretty quickly. The baked goods are AMAZING. We tried the red velvet cupcake, chocolate mousse cake, Oreo cake and chocolate chip cookies. All of it was delicious and worth the hype. Prices are so decent. They also have shirts and coffee mugs, I got a mug. People there are friendly too. Parking is not the greatest you have to get lucky to find street parking so I would recommend Uber or Lyft if you can.
2019-12-23,1,Horrible...I went to the class and it started with a talk about the business. Then after about 40 minutes we could start and they gave us pre made cakes, Fondant and cookie cutters. They gave us the fondant and were no help. Painting classes treat u with more respect. They rushed everyone out before people were done with their cakes. Their was one five minute warning and then they told us to get our cake steamed or the machine was going off...  the cake is mediocre at best! Very disappointed at the overall experience and food
2019-12-21,4,My Mom watches Cake Boss so I thought it would be a good idea to pick up a cake from Carlo's for her birthday. I ordered online to be picked up in the morning and when I got there, it was ready as promised. I have seen a lot of complaints on Yelp that it is way overpriced & that Buddy is cashing in on his TV show by charging high prices. Now I haven't bought a cake in Hoboken or JC yet so I was unsure of area prices...I did my due diligence online and found that Carlo's is right in line with what other bakeries charge. Anyways I decided to choose the Cannoli cake as my mom is Italian and loves Cannolis. The presentation of the cake was excellent...the decoration was on point. The flavor of the cake was great too....tasted like a cannoli but not too sweet; the only downside to the cake was that it was a little too dense for my liking. I like light & fluffy cakes typically but other than that, I was happy with my purchase. In my review, I have factored out the fact that this is bakery is on TV...it was a solid cake. However, if I did factor in that this was on TV, it would probably get a 2.5. The cake didn't blow me away and was not the best cake I have ever had which you would expect since the bakery has its own TV show. All-in-all, I got a great cake for my mom and didn't have to brave a long lines so at the end of the day I'm a happy camper.
2019-12-07,1,I just ordered a stawberry cheesecake through Uber Eats for my friend's birthday. It was advertised as having glazed strawberries and a graham cracker crust. When I received the order, I got a tiny cup of cheesecake filling- no strawberries and no crust. I tasted a little bit and after realizing there was nothing else inside, I just threw it away. I then called customer service expecting they would try to rectify the situation. Instead they told me to send them a picture so they could send it to the "higher ups". Since I had already thrown the cake away I told them all I could do was send a picture of my trash. They said they wouldn't do anything without a picture and that was that. I find it ridiculous for a restaurant to place the onus of this on the customer when they are the ones who messed up. I essentially paid 9 dollars for a cup of lies and the whole situation put a damper on my friend's birthday. I suggest you stay away from this place unless you are okay with getting whatever they feel like giving you- correct order or not. Do yourself a favor and go to the Cheesecake Factory instead, at least they know how to treat their customers.
2019-11-21,4,I have never watched cake boss, but even I felt enamored with celebrity walking into this bakery. Cake BOSS my dudes, this guy is in charge of so many cakes, what a payroll! Aha I kid of course, cakes are not sentient beings working for a paycheck. They're already rich-with flavor! But seriously the cupcake I tried was way too sweet, the frosting had a nice whipped consistency though, and the employees were nice.
2019-11-19,2,I've ordered cakes slices from here on few occassions and I think I am done after last night's order. The salted caramel cake (which usually is amazing) was dry and the frosting too too sweet. I've had same consistency issues the other times where the same slice I ordered before was good and dry the next time or vice versa. Regardless I always thought it was a good place to get dessert when you really really want it. Not anymore as they ruined my favorite cake from their store
2019-11-13,1,I visited this bakery with family and we ordered cupcakes, cake and cannoli. The cannoli was ok but the cake and cupcakes were VERY dry. It seems like they were baked Several days ago and left them sitting out. I would not go to this bakery again nor would I recommend eating from here.. I would have much rather spend my $46.27 at a local mom and pop restaurant that doesn't get the hype they actually need.
2019-11-10,5,This place is an amazing Bakery! Sweets 4 The Sweet! 1st Time I have been here! Excited & Delish Spot 4 Dessert!
2019-11-08,5,We went on a monday morning here, mainly because of the show. It was not crowded at all, just parking took some time since it's a downtown area + east coast. I mainly wanted to get a picture and there was no crowd so it was very easy. Ended up taking a cannoli and crumble cake to validate the reviews on here. They both were delicious! I wish I had bought more. I wanted to see the family there but they weren't in when we had come. I would love try out more pastries there if I come to hoboken again!
2019-11-04,5,I ordered the chocolate lobster tale, tradicional cannoli, strawberry with chocolate and an oreo cupcake. I admit I was low on expectations due to the low ratings ... but everything was delicious and the service was great! A must see visit for those who are a cake boss fan or just want a great experience.
2019-10-29,5,Well finally made it to Carlo's bakery and I was happy to arrive.  Was greeted by all that worked there and I got to meet Mary.  She was very friendly and was nice to talk to.  The store wasn't as busy as I thought it was going to be and really surprised on Saturday morning after they opened that we were basically the only ones in there besides three other women.  I got to look around and enjoy my visit.  Friday we had the regular lobster tail and the regular and a chocolate cannoli.  They were delicious but the lobster tail was out of this world.  Yum!!!!! Not sure if the lady name that helped us then but was very polite and sweet to talk too.  She gave us a few places to eat at.  The pizza place beside there was good.  Saturday morning Christian helped us and he was great!  Thank you for taking the time with me on my order and not rushing me.  We had the regular lobster tail, pumpkin lobster, salted caramel and one other.  Cupcakes, apple puff and a crossiant and coffee.  Then I watched them decorate my birthday cake.  Let me tell you everything was delicious!  The cake was awesome and not overly sweet and the cupcakes were great also.  My friends enjoyed them and mentioned how they weren't overly sweet like most cakes and icing are.  The crossiant was flaky and delicious!!I will be back one day for sure.  But will order on line.  Thank you for making my birthday trip memorable.
2019-10-20,3,Thai rating comes with the variety of baked goods offered and the small twists to them as well such as the cheesecake made and available in different varieties (blueberry, etc). Several other items outside of cheesecake you can choose form. You're greeted when you walk-in, your order is taken by someone with an iPad, which helps speed up the service. Once you make it to the cashier, you provide your name and wha-laa...you pay for your order and receive your order. Now, inside is pretty tiny with limited space to sit-in. However, it's located in a very busy area with lots to do as long ax the weather is agreeable that day. If you choose to sit in- you have very few if two tables with chairs and an area to stand or a high top with chairs you can use as well.I am not crazy about this lcoatin as well but I can appreciate what others have shared regarding this location. Last, the specific cashier this day was dazed out, off and unable to grab a receipt and confirm a name at the same time. Due to the system they have her actions didn't cause a backup or delay in service.
2019-10-20,5,I stopped in with my family on the way back to Buffalo. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Service was absolutely top of the line.
2019-10-17,2,Terribly overpriced. The baked goods are good but $7 for an M&M cookie is crazy.  The cakes they sell are above average but I do not think they are worth it for what they charge
2019-10-17,3,I was in Hoboken visiting friends and we came here for some to-go desserts.  This place has gotten famous due to reality TV and I think that has gone to their heads.  The prices were outrageous.  We took a regular cannoli and two tiny cheesecakes home and it was like $25.  My friend also got a box of basic cookies for her son and they were $21.  Definitely not worth the price.I was too full from dinner so I did not eat my cannoli the same day we bought it.  I did have it the next day for breakfast and it was very tasty. though the crust got a bit soggy sitting overnight.  Good flavor though.
2019-10-15,5,So I first came here just because I love the show but was very impressed with all there sweet treats. Of course everything was fresh and great the pastry puffs where me favorite. They were light and flaky. The decor is totally adorable and classic bakery look. I just loved the whole place. The service was all too notch.
2019-10-15,4,On a recent trip to NYC, we decided to stop in Hoboken to visit the famous Carlo's Bakery. I've always been a fan, so I definitely wanted to stop. There was a huge case full of amazing looking treats, as well as some small cakes. Everything looked great, but we decided on some cannolis, cookies, and a cookies and cream cupcake. The cost was a little high but I expected as much. The cannolis were to die for! Absolutely fantastic! There is minimal seating, so you're definitely better off planning to take everything home with you.
2019-10-12,2,My friend and I were on our way back to Indianapolis from New York. We wanted to stop at the original Carlo's and were super excited to visit. The staff treated us very well. I wanted to get a t-shirt for my sister, as well as one for myself. The employee showed me the size of the shirt, as the shirts were wrapped in plastic. The size worked for me, so she grabbed two shirts for my order. I spent almost $70 on the shirts and a few pieces of cake/cookies. After I'd gotten home, I decided to try the shirt on. It was extremely comfy and I wore it to bed that night. I woke up and realized the stitching had come undone on the rib seam, and the t-shirt had a hole in it. Knowing Carlo's reputation, I really did not think it would be an issue. I emailed the company and explained discovering the hole, and offered to ship the shirt back for them to view, if they could do some sort of exchange. Much to my surprise and disappointment, they replied with a very generic "thanks for coming to the shop", and a very simple "sorry, we don't do shipping right now." Then, after basically telling me they couldn't help me, they ended the email saying "please come back and visit us!".They DO ship, though. They ship their cakes and pastries all throughout the United States. I am extremely disappointed to learn that the customer service is very sub-par, especially coming from a place with the reputation such as Carlo's Bakery. The only option I have now is to sew up a brand new shirt and hope that it doesn't look terrible. I purchased a defective item from them, and they have refused to offer a solution, other than sticking me with the shirt. $70 might not seem like a lot to them, but that is what I spent at their shop and have nothing to show for it but a bad taste in my mouth. I did respond to their email, basically asking to be educated on why they can ship food goods, but could not send a tshirt through the mail, even if it was to address a customer service issue. Alas, no response from them.I truly hope this is a one-off, and that they normally have better reaction to unsatisfied customers. I probably took it a bit personally, but I expected much more from a shop that I have dreamt about visiting and have watched on tv for many, many years.Shame on them.UPDATE: raised the stars to two because they did end up "making an exception" and sending me a new shirt.
2019-10-02,5,Had a Red Velvet cake shipped 1,000 miles away via Goldbelly. I don't think I've ever had a better one than this. It was a perfect birthday cake. Thanks, Carlo's!
2019-10-01,4,Good desserts, good coffee, nice variety.  Friendly staff.  we went, we ate, we drank.
2019-09-14,1,Went to purchase some pastries, cookies, and cupcakes and wow they were absolutely horrible!!! I spent almost $60, and my brother here on vacation spent about $85. What a complete waste of money. By far the worst tasting tiramisu I've ever had, the cupcakes were horrible, and the cookies were stale. Will never ever go back or recommend this place to anyone. Save your money!
2019-09-06,1,1st went to Carlo's years ago when the show first hit the airwaves, it was small but busy and the cookies and cannolis tasted like EVERY other bakery I have tried them before and the price was normal for them. Went a couple weeks back and they completely renovated the place(which is fine) but all they showcased were cakes, and pastries. Cookies were prepackaged and the butter cookies had some sugary sparkles on all of them. Since the selection was "Meh" we just ordered a cannoli, chocolate covered cannoli and a brownie. My son took a couple of bites of the brownie before throwing it away and the cannolis were like any other bakeries. My wife joked that the ONLY ththing with purchasing there are the Carlo's red linen shopping bags for $2.50 a piece. Go there if you're a fan of the show but don't except your tastebuds to be overwhelmed with great tasting products. The other reason I gave 1 star is because of their online ordering, let me say "Buyer Beware". If you are not available to pick up a cake in person, you will be charged 100% more. Dont believe me, go to the page and click on cakes, I believe they're around $35 for a cake(not too bad). But if you want it shipped they double the price to $70. And before you knock me for "its probably for shipping". WRONG! They offer FREE SHIPPING! So again be wary before placing an online order to be shipped.
2019-09-01,3,Meh...is how I felt being here. I visited during 4th of July weekend. I went when they 1st opened. No line/wait. It was surprisingly empty. Found street parking right near the store. I cant imagine where people park during a busy time.I LOVED the show cake boss and totally drank the buddy kool-aid. So I expected to be blown away by the desserts. Sadly, I wasnt. The staff was super friendly and helpful for me. I bought $65 worth of cupcakes/ sugar cookies/ and a couple slices of cake. You know for "research". I took the majority of it to work for my colleagues. Free work food never goes uneaten. The funfetti cake is delicious moist not overly sweet. I would get it again.The red velvet was a no go. The icing was weird. The cupcakes are beautifully decorated with sugar art and travel very well. Everything made the 4 hour ride home. My team devoured the cookies. They were all different flavors. Each one was better than the next. I love the packaging. The sugar cookies were pretty and buttery. I ate the oatmeal raisin cookie immediately. It was delicious.I bought a reusable bag to take my treats home in. It double as my souvenir..what as great purchase. Very durable. I took a pic with Buddy on the wall. I can check this off my bucket list.
2019-08-28,3,Needed something sweet and happened to be on Washington St. Unfortunately I remember the OriginalCity Hall bakery there and this doesn't even come close !Had an eclair-best go to Venierio's / Rocco's in Villageor Fortunato Bros in Williamsburg Pastries passable. Cakes better
2019-08-16,3,Of all the years living in New Jersey, I never went inside Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken. When i was in middle school, I once went to one of the NYC locations, but didn't buy anything because I'm not much of a sweets person.When my friend from the UK cane to visit, she really wanted to go to this location because of the TV show. So we went in, and we helped immediately. I ended up getting a cookie and two cupcakes. The cookie was good, but nothing crazy, but the cupcakes were a bit on the dry side. I think for the price you pay, there are much better bakeries in the area. Just know that when you go here you're paying for the name, and not for the flavor.
2019-08-14,5,We enjoyed visiting this original location.  We ordered cannolis, lobster tail, chocolate cake, black and whites to go and espresso.  With each bite and sip we were not disappointed.  Fresh and delicious.  Enjoyed seeing photos of the family, the founder making a wedding cake and tucked away, a late photo of Mama.  Very special.  Took many photos, talked with the staff who were very friendly and helpful and enjoyed the time there.  Bucket list check off for me.  Very happy to say "Been there, done that and you bet I bought the t-shirt!"  I'll wear it with fond memories.
2019-08-14,1,Bought 80 dollars worth of pastries and charged 25 cents for a plastic bag, was told it was a Hoboken "law" , I'm sure they can absorb the "25 cents" if they wanted, what a miserable'
2019-08-12,3,I was super excited to try the connolis and to be honest...not worth the hype..at all. I would go to Paneantico bakery in brooklyn...those are amazing!!
2019-08-11,2,It's a good job that their specialty stuff got all the good notice it got on TV because if they relied on the taste of their baked goods they'd be out of business.I had been informed that their stuff didn't taste great from a client, but with my niece visiting from the UK, and it being on her trip's bucket list I thought I'd be a good uncle.So we went and ordered, cakes for 5 and a shirt cost $85 so I figured it was going to be the best I'd ever tried. That is when it all fell apart in a sad tasteless waste of excitement and time chewing.When your 'dad's recipe' rainbow cookies taste the same as your red velvet cake you know you are in trouble. Now I am sure Carlo's dad made some banging rainbow cookies, unfortunately Carlo can't make rainbow cookies to save his life (or rather his bakery can't).Never has a bakery been more reputation over substance than this place. Still my niece is happy with her t-shirt (even if it did cost $35)... just hope it doesn't disappoint as much as the baked goods did.
2019-08-07,3,It was my first time visiting this area, so cute neighborhood it's in. Cannoli was ok, I've had better. Red velvet cake was moist, lobster tail pastry cream was good. Overall everything was overpriced. I don't know what this bakery was like before the tv show; the taste is good, but commercialized like the other reviews mentioned. I've had better homemade tasting desserts from smaller shops
2019-08-06,5,I've never seen an episode of Cake Boss, but I'm familiar with the show. Went to the bake shop as recommended by one of my daughter's teacher. So glad we went! Everything we ordered was delish! I especially loved the lobster tail (we got them in original and cookies n' cream) - they were crunchy and flaky and the filling was not overly sweet.  We also got the cannolis and those were so good too! I wanted to buy more for the road, but I know it won't survive the flight to California . I did get a few more items for the airport
2019-08-06,2,Meh. Pre-filled, not fresh cannolis & packaged cookies. These folks are now a tourist stop and have lost the touch that made them a good bakery. They are now a retail distributor for a celebrity.
2019-08-04,3,We came in with a group of 6 because 2 of the young ladies wanted to see the cake boss bakery. We bought coffee and a variety of pastries. The cannoli was pretty good. Everything else was ok. There wasn't enough seating - we had to go outside and down the street to eat sitting on a retaining wall. The coffee was pretty bad, I had to throw it out after just half the cup.
2019-08-04,2,Pretty decent cookie I guess. Probably wouldn't come back tho for $3.50 a pastry. I'd rather spend $3.50 on bandaids from cvs.
2019-08-02,1,I ordered a birthday cake for my daughter a few weeks ago through their website. She lives in Brooklyn so I thought it could be delivered locally.   I even put her address in and it took me to the ordering page. On the day it was to be delivered (yesterday) I received a call from someone from Postmates to verify the address. I did and she (very rudely) responded she doesn't go to Brooklyn. I explained that I didn't even know they were delivering it via Postmates, it never said that on the website.  She said it'll take 40 minutes to be delivered.  Well, an hour AFTER the cake was to be delivered,  someone else called from Postmates starting the delivery was canceled. Apparently they don't go to Brooklyn.  I then got an email that said to call the bakery regarding this issue. I called the bakery oh, they said they can't do anything because Postmates was the delivery service. I stated that I never knew Postmates was going to be delivering it or else I would have checked to see if they can deliver it there. They said I would have to get a refund from Postmates. I called Postmates, they said I needed to get all the bakery for a refund. After phone tag with both places all day long, I am still out my $71. And very disappointed my daughter never did get her cake! Horrible horrible horrible customer service! Do not order from there!
2019-07-31,4,I give it 4 stars because the girl behind the counter didn't ever acknowledge us until she saw us about to walk out lol. We were the only ones in the store so it's not like she couldn't of at least said "Hi". Anyways, 4 stars because the cake was some of the best cake I have ever had. Very fluffy cake and the icing melts in your mouth. Cookies are a bit dry though. I had to try this place since I grew up watching Cake Boss as a teenager! Did not disappoint in terms of food. Customer service is lacking though.
2019-07-25,2,It was busy but not crazy. We waited aprx 10 min in line.I just tried my red velvet cupcake. I have to say , I'm disappointed  It wasn't a buttermilk cake & it wasn't cream cheese icing. It was standard dense cake with lots of red food coloring. It was butter cream icing. Just a standard cupcake I could have bought at the grocery store. The cannoli's , I had bought an original & chocolate. They we're both soft. No crispness at all. I also bout 2 lobster tails, 1 original & 1 salted caramel. Both were chewy. I specifically asked the girl behind the counter if the cannolis were fresh & I even asked again if the lobster tails were fresh. Since I had read several reviews here about stale products. I asked so many times the counter girl told me " everything in the case was baked this morning ". I was there at 11 am & my cannolis & lobster tails were both stale. The cheese cake, was dry & flavor was very eggy. Everything I purchased was such a let down. I spent $72 & more than 1/2 my products went in the garbage. I won't be returning & won't be suggest this bakery to anyone.
2019-07-23,3,Came for cheesecake. Got the individual chocolate strawberry cheesecake to split with another cheesecake fiend. It's a great portion to get your fix and not feel guilty about it. But it felt like it lacked tender love and care. It tasted mainstream and standard, like something you'd get at a supermarket. It was good, but nothing above average. Their seating is so limited, so be prepared to stand awkwardly with plate in hand and wait for a table to open up. There's a bench outside, too. They should put some more options, as there's some room they could work with. No bathroom, too, FYI.
2019-07-23,3,I mean you cant goto hoboken and not at least give this famous bakery a try especially when you have seen a few cake boss episodes on tv. We were thrilled when we arrived and there is a wide array of treats to try and they all look amazing. However I felt like it was more of a touristy thing to me as the flavor was equal to almost every other bakery we tried on our trip nothing spectacular.
2019-07-22,1,STALE and tasted like detergent(Mrs.Meyers perhaps) Never would I imagine I would give a one star especially to the original Carlos Bakery. I've been to the South Jersey shop and it was decent - however this was my first time at the Hoboken store. I had bought the Nutella lobster tail and an original cannoli. The Cannoli was Chewy and somewhat soft instead of being crunchy. So that's stale. Disappointing but moved on to the lobster tail. It was also very STALE but what prompted me to write this was the fact that this particular lobster tail tasted like DETERGENT. I took 3 bites for the benefit of the doubt and only got stronger and now I have this disgusting after taste. Do you use Mrs.Meyers there? It sure tasted like it was mixed in the lobster tail. I really hope this was a bad batch and not the new standard. I am utterly disgusted. Picture of the other lobster tail attached to review (that I'm happy to send back for your taste test) Customer service was also lacking at this lovatio
2019-07-20,2,Recently on vacation in New Jersey and being fans of the show Cake Boss of course our family had to give it a try! We went to two different locations. The shop located in the Willowbrook Mall only had about 5 things to choose from. The pastries were stale, really didn't have much flavor and the employee really wasn't that pleasant but hey everyone can have a bad day.We had family asking for us to bring some back home with us for them to try because they are fans of the show also. The next day we went to the Hoboken location. They had a lot more to choose from and let's just say we got a couple of everything they had to offer. The staff at this location was very friendly but most of the pastries were actually less than average in my opinion. (We all know the saying about opinions)Regular Cookies 2 flavors: 2/10Cake/cupcake, cheesecake, 2 out of 3 flavors of lobster tail: 3/10Cannoli chocolate and regular: 4/10Cream puffs, Eclairs: 5/10Honestly the best thing they had were the rainbow cookies: 9/10Was it a fun experience? Yes Would I recommend going if you're in the area so you can say you have been to Carlos Bake Shop?YesIs it something I would do again? No If you go just try one or two things and save the rest of your money! We spent a small fortune an only 1 out of 6 people liked more than one item.
2019-07-16,2,Loved the tv show, so since we were in the area we decided to stop in.Was not really impressed. For a bakery I thought there would be more pastries, but it seemed like more cakes and cupcakes. I've tried many cupcakes in my lifetime and their chocolate chocolate frosting cupcake wouldn't even make my top 5... sadly. I've tasted cupcakes that are cheaper and better!Service was quick, but unfriendly and rushed! The younger and older lady were very impatient with customers. After every item we picked they kept asking "are you done, anything  else?" Sadly you can believe the negative reviews..Sliced cake seriously over priced for the quality. I'm guessing it was dry due to sitting in the plastic container on the counter and unrefrigerated. At least we got to say we tried it.Coffee and cappuccino was the highlight there.
2019-07-15,3,My sister has always been a big fan of the show cake boss and when we were in New Jersey visiting my brother we decided to stop by the legendary Carlo's Bakery to try some of their goods. Lucky for us we came on a late Friday afternoon and there was little to no line at the store. Unlucky for us we had a horrible server that gave little to no curtsey for us. I felt like we were treated like trash and were rushed to order which made no sense since there was no line behind us. There we did order a couple of things like brownies, cannolis, cream puffs, and cakes. The baked goods were not bad but some things like the cannolis were too sweet for my taste. Also, a heads up for those tourists that are driving is that parking is rough in the area. I recommending parking in a nearby structure but remember that it is not cheap.
2019-07-14,2,I have been wanting to try this for the last 2 years that I have been traveling to NJ for work.   This show is what made me start cake decorating for fun.  Finally got my chance and was disappointed.    Everything I bought to try was super dry.   The cupcake, cake and cookies I brought home to the kids.   Even the cannolis were soft.   Wish I would have not spent the $35 I did.
2019-07-13,3,Great place to visit to see where CakeBoss  originated- but, frankly, the cupcakes and such are average and everything is overpriced because it can be - it's CakeBoss! It's great to o there for the experience, but not for the pastries etc.
2019-07-07,4,It was kind of disappointing.. I'll admit... had it not been for Cake Boss my expectations would not have been as high. I expected perfection... fireworks even... all I got was pretty good and a little bit higher priced than I expected. But then again... this west coaster now can say she went to Buddy's place.
2019-07-06,2,Honestly, I've wanted to visit for years...being a native NYer and transplanted to DC. So, today I did. Line wasn't terrible, to the door, well expected for the hype and popularity. So, here is where Buddy fails...his staff is rude. Interaction of asking what a few things were, she had attitude and basically told us to hurry it along. Then when we asked how much certain things were because they had no stickers and weren't on the menu board, it was like we were asking for the world. Buddy, YOU can do better. Your pastries speak for themselves, but to get a complete package, you need to retrain or fire some of your help. Or maybe, this was a once in a lifetime visit.
2019-07-05,5,Visited all the way from SoCal and let me tell ya, this place is the BUSINESS!!! I've NEVER had carrot cake that tasted so good!!! That cake was just pure goodness!!! My son had the cannoli and I also got the oatmeal raisin cookie which was THEE BEST! I'm trying to make my way back before I go back home!
2019-07-01,2,I unfortunately spent 54$ on dessert come on  I got ripped out off everything wasn't that good besides the cannoli
2019-06-30,2,Tourist trap. Not actually a good bakery. Expensive. Long lines. Just keep walking. Really such a disappointment
2019-06-28,5,I don't know. I love this place! I found out about Carlo's bakery many years ago when I was watching TLC back in Ukraine. I really think they have one of the best cakes in this area. Also I love their creativity!
2019-06-27,5,Tried the lobster tails, tiramisu, and Oreo chocolate cake.  Everything was fantastic.  The employees were extremely friendly .
2019-06-26,4,Carlo's Bakery is a must do while in the area. The pastries are fantastic. However I am a little concerned about Buddy's thought process on his success. I don't think he thinks he needs to be there very often now, and he isn't. That's what the employees said. I just hope he doesn't lose touch with his real fans. The patrons of the original location. But, that being said, everything was awesome!  I was here on my birthday, and had a chance to try a lot!  And everything was spot on.
2019-06-23,4,I bought a few pastries from here and they were all delicious. I would go there again even though it is quite far from where I live.
2019-06-21,3,I personally feel like Carlos is overhyped for its television popularity but I've still given it a few tries. Their tiramisu isn't the best, i tried the cake and pastries on two different occasions and wasn't impressed. I did recently get a chocolate cake from here which was as perfect as a chocolate cake can be- i mean from the flavor to the satisfaction of eating chocolate, it had it all. I would recommend it to all chocolate lovers and they even have smaller pastry versions of it available! All in all, few treaties are nice but wouldn't recommend waiting on the line for over 10 mins to snag a treat!
2019-06-17,3,Coming from SoCal, had to see what the hype was about. Have the CakeBoss experience. Came in monday afternoon & was surprisingly empty, so there was seating, though it is limited. Large variety of pastries, etc. A tad pricey. Chocolate cupcake was good. Sprinkle cookie was average. Neapolitan was light & flakey, but super sweet. Small cup of coffee was $3 something. Another one off the bucket list.
2019-06-16,5,Ordered strawberry cheesecake and tiramisu. Both the desserts were heavenly! Loved every bit of it. If it weren't for all the calories, I would be devouring the desserts here everyday...:p. Highly recommend it!
2019-06-12,1,Stopped by while in Hoboken one afternoon. I was definitely excited to visit the original Carlo's bakery location and to see that there was no line at the time!The inside was quite big but only had ~2 tiny tables to sit.The display was pretty full for the most part with a lot of different options of full size cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pastries, etc.We ordered a lobster tail ($4.95) and a sprinkle sugar cookie ($3). I had high hopes for the lobster tail especially since it's what they're known for! Both items were unfortunately stale. Very stale. Like so stale that you would've thought they had been sitting out for days. The lobster tail was incredibly chewy, but the cream filling was good. The cookie was hard and crumbly.SO DISAPPOINTING.
2019-06-11,2,We've had the cupcakes on Carlo's location on NCL cruises and found that this home location in Hoboken also has dry cupcakes. The red velvet was really dry and we were so glad we got bottles of water to wash them down. Going here is more for the tourist and reality tv fan.
2019-06-09,5,The staff was very friendly and attentive. There was a fully stocked selection of desserts. It is a little expensive, but the desserts are good quality. The red velvet cake slice is very good.
2019-06-03,2,Tasty but old pastry.   "Lobster tail" was not crunchy or fresh.  It felt like plastic.  Same with an eclair the other day.  Not fresh, days old.
2019-06-01,4,staff was amazingly helpful, very sweet like their treats. We had the chocolate covered cannoli & regular cannoli. Definitely recommend the chocolate covered. We also had a chocolate chip cookie & it reminded me of a bigger version of the entenmanns' mini cookies (a compliment, because those are my favorite cookies). Texture, flavor & love were all part of their recipe. Overall, I had an exceptional experience with their food & would recommend to a friend any time of the week.
2019-05-24,2,Used to go here before was famous. Quality has gone down.  Cannolis awful like paste and a rip off cupcakes and brownies not very fresh or tasty. The cheesecake was good. Priced 3x higher than my local Italian bakery  used to live walking in to a family owned place. Carlos is now a cold chain store
2019-05-24,5,We are a family who LOVES pastries.  We buy them everywhere we travel, world wide.   Yes, we're tourists in Hoboken.  Yes, we have been fans of the show, but we still have tastebuds, standards, and honestly, I expected to be a bit disappointed bc how could it all live up to the hype? But we were not disappointed; in fact, we were impressed that everything we tried over 4 days were delicious: brownie with icing, m&m cookie, Black and white cookie, lobster tail, chocolate cupcake, carrot cake slice, red velvet slice, Italian cheesecake, caramel cake slice, chocolate filled croissant, chocolate cookie with white chips, cheese danish--all moist, fresh, and just dang delicious (The only thing that disappointed me was the crumb cake.  It seemed a bit stale).  I thought the sweet level was just right--not cloying, not overpowering.  The icings were the best ever!--Just sweet enough, creamy, but not too thick or heavy.  I thought the prices were on par with what I pay normally back home at our regular bakery.  We waited a couple of minutes each day tops--we went morning, afternoon, and evening.  The ladies working the counter were quick and friendly too.  It seems to me to be a lot of sour grapes in the reviews...too bad because it appears that this bakery lives up to the hype.Addendum: prior to continuing our trip, my son bought another crumb cake.  We waited two days to eat it bc we had so many other goodies to eat first.  We heated it this time, and we found it to be quite tasty that way--moist, generous crumb topping, not too sweet--perfect w a cup of coffee.  Maybe my first one wasn't stale, but should've been served warm?We enjoyed our treats so much that upon our return to NJ, before our flight out at the end of our trip, we popped in and bought more slices and cupcakes to take home.  Saturday line was a bit longer, but went very fast.  Tickled to see Lisa and Mauro working.  Purchased cake slices and two cupcakes to go.  Great packaging! Our goodies made it home and we enjoyed them all.
2019-05-21,5,Had to stop by Carlo`s while visiting NJ this weekend, I have watched the Cake Boss show on food network  so had to visit the original shop. There was a line all the way to the door but it moves very fast, staff is very helpful and friendly. We ordered a lobster tail which was flaky and filling was perfect, also ordered an eclair and a slice of rainbow cake everything was so delicious. We took are order to go because the seating is very limited inside, we had ours at the hotel room after we had went to dinner that night. The shop is in historical Hoboken there is street parking and also parking garages in the area. The prices are same as any high end bakery you get what you pay for, very good quality items. I loved everything we tried and would stop again if in the area.
2019-05-18,2,I definitely think they are way overrated, I've tried all the bakeries and there are a lot of other bakeries better than them, obviously they have their name they have their TV show, but to me it's way overrated the products are not fresh, Frank
2019-05-03,4,I'd like to first start off that I am being very generous with this review.   I did not have a bad experience at Carlo's Bake Shop, however for the price of what you are paying for each item, it's not the greatest.  Everyone (people and television) always hype up this place,  and yes the pastries did taste good, but they were just overpriced.   I feel like over the past 10 years, since all the TV show exposure,  they focus now on more mass produced pastries vs home made quality product.  The cannoli cream is good, but it's not as good as some other bakeries I had.  Same with the lobster tails.  Good cream inside, just small in size.   For example I can get a bigger, more cream filled, and cheaper lobster tail, by my girlfriends house in Brooklyn.   Probably 20 years ago, this bake shop was top notch.  But with fame, the product quality declined.  There is so many items of each in the shop, and always so crowded with people, they want to sell as much as they can, due to the demand of the crowds coming in from all over.  I understand business is business,  but mom and pop bakeries to me are better.  That being said, I still loved the taste of all the pastries I tried, so I still give this place 4 stars, as it's not bad.  Just expensive and overhyped.   I think we all tend to go here because of Cake Boss , to secretly hope we get to see him inside the shop that day, although we prob never will lol.
2019-05-02,3,Just received my box of Cuban meat pies ... new for Carlos Bakery.   Shipped great .. u get 8 big meat pies frozen... I have never ordered from Carols yes shipping is expensive but after watching the show I was excited to try them.  Just had one for lunch easy to do the heating instructions... very flaky ... very buttery... and the filling is a bit salty to me but I wish the gentleman and Carlos Bakery much success.  Did I tell you they are BIG....enjoy
2019-04-26,2,The cake and pastries are just average. The one positive thing is the selection is wide. Customer service is disappointing. I lined up and when I got to the cashier I was told I need to line up. I guess they were supposed to help me order while I was in the line? Someone should have helped me order if that's the case. I didn't see any staff behind the counter while I was in the line. The cashier was rude and confrontational. And the person who was supposed to help people order was missing/inattentive. The staff at Carlo's is not well trained and provides bad service.
2019-04-26,1,Amiens Macarons- from the TV show  'Bake You Rich".I ordered these online right after watching the TV show. When I got them I immediately opened the box and I bit into one and spit it right out. They are sickly sweet, mushy and frankly disgusting. I hope I can save someone else the expense of buying these gross cookies. I would return them if I could.
2019-04-23,5,Yummy yummy yummy this was great especially because I always wanted to go there the staff was amazing the desserts melt in your mouth.  You gotta go !!
2019-04-19,3,Just a comment on The new frenagles which I ordered on line after watching the new show. First the positives: once proofed and baked they were tasty- more of a croissant in the shape of a bagel than a true mash-up. Now the negatives: 1. they arrived poorly packaged, were much smaller than I had anticipated and had thawed ( to give credit possible thaw was mentioned when ordering- we are east coast folks currently in the SW and order from legal seafoods and other purveyors frequently and have never had a problem). 2. There were no directions included... not a problem for me as I had easy access to the website, but could be an issue had I wanted to send as a gift. Overall, my suggestions would be to increase the size, package better and provide instructions. I want to order one of,their,cake kits for my granddaughter but am worried  at this point- do not want to spend $75 on something that doesn't arrive in good shape
2019-04-18,1,I spent hundreds of dollars ordering cakes from Carlo's in the last 3 years...My Granddaughter came to town for her birthday and she wanted a beach themed cake that they NORMALLY carry in a 6 inch size in their case for under $50...I was told because it was during Easter Season that I could not order the cake that they normally carry in 6inch and keep stocked in their case unless I ordered it in a 10 inch cake for over $130 ( there is just 2 adults and 2 children under 5)...I am not paying 3 times the price for a larger cake I do not need...especially one that you normally make in a 6inch and carry multitudes in your case...Last time I call them for a cake...Do not claim to be a CUSTOM BAKERY when you refuse to sell what you normally carry standard in your case!!! Rip Off!!!
2019-04-16,5,My daughter and I had some time to kill before we went to the Statue of Liberty and I wanted to go to a bakery so.....here we are!  We drove 45 minutes through some heavy traffic and it was worth every mile traveled!  We got so much stuff...what to try first?  A cheese danish but not just any cheese danish...hands down the most amazing CHEESE DANISH I have EVER had!  My daughter tried a chocolate covered strawberry and it was so PERFECT!  When you bit into the chocolate and strawberry you got some of both without the chocolate crumbling everywhere!  I will definitely be back especially before heading back to Maine.  Oh and the staff were so nice and helpful telling us what each thing was.  I have to say I think Hoboken,  NJ is my favorite new town!
2019-04-07,5,Veronica was amazing! Insanely helpful we wound getting like one of almost everything, absolutely love it. A little pricey but super yummy.
2019-04-07,5,Nice and clean shop, lots of variety. Not sure why the review is so low, I couldn't find anything wrong with the place, only it is a bit pricy if you want to have it on a frequent basis. But nothing out rigorous compared to the usual desert place in JC or nyc. Everything is fresh and so tasty, definitely worth trying!
2019-04-05,2,Not surprised this place isn't rated highly. I used to work at a bakery and so I've had fresh! This place cupcakes are horrible! They taste like shit. Haha. I will not be coming back here. The best cupcake I've had in Hoboken so far is from Sweet. And even they don't always have soft and fresh! The coffee here was also sub par. Much better coffees elsewhere. Plus this place is expensive! You're only paying for the name. It's so not worth it. Sorry! Tried it once just because of the popularity of the name. Don't believe they hype!
2019-04-03,1,Carlos really needs check his staff! Paid 80 bucks for a 10 inch cake and you can't close the lid of the box? Tape it ,string ,glue it or I something I don't care! A women's actually handed me a tape because she didn't wanna look for the end of it and was very nasty. Thanks for giving me the cake in the box... ? Glad the manager was the to help since I had a baby in the stroller and the box didn't fit in the stroller and I had to hold the cake in my hand,,, ps they also don't have paper bags to fit their boxes ..
2019-03-26,1,Over priced and quality was awful! Honestly, not worth it. All the hype came from the show and I'm disappointed. You would expect a way better quality for all the hype!
2019-03-22,5,This is the best bakery of all time. I have been watching their show Cake Boss for years and I finally tasted their treats for myself. We went to the original bakery. I tried the original lobster tail and the rainbow cake. I have such a sweet tooth, so I went for the best seller and the most appealing dessert. The rainbow cake was so moist and so delicious and just overall as fun as can be!! The lobster tail was so good with the perfect level of sweetness. Buddy's sister Lisa was there, and she was as sweet as can be. She made great suggestions and was so friendly and helpful!! The employees knowledge and overall friendliness is unbeatable. My family and I will definitely be coming back to this bakery soon.
2019-03-20,1,I have gone to Carlo's Bakery many times!But this weekend was my last trip!They are overpriced!My crumb cake was stale !I got a lobster tail because Buddy beat Duff on their first episode of their new show making them and I had a lot better elsewhere. How do u screw up chocolate mousse??See ya Buddy!I hope Duff kicks your butt!!
2019-03-20,1,Who would want a cake from temper tantrum man!  Awful so-called italian food!! Steer clear of here!!
2019-03-19,1,Anyone Italian or a fan of real Italian food should steer clear of here.  It's St.Joseph's Day, and typically a day for a beautiful zeppole filled with custard and cherries, called a St. Joseph cake.  Not one to be found here anymore.  There are pre-filled cannoli. Awful. And who pre-fills cannoli? The shells get soggy. But you would not want these anyway. And then there are "lobster tails"...but not really. They are sfogliatelle.Lobster tails, anywhere else in Jersey or in Brooklyn, are twice the size.The standard is so low here that rainbow cookies are like the texture of tile caulking and have no flavor, and cost somewhere around $12.00 a box. Are you kidding? They are gross. To anyone who thinks this place is a staple of Hoboken must be confused. This is the Entemann's of Hoboken. Homogenized and without any Italian flair. Its all about the hype which adds up to bad food and a narcissistic guy with an overly puffed up ego. Truly a joke.
2019-03-19,2,This bakery is not worth the stop and money. I am 100% Italian originally from New York. When Cake Boss first aired my daughters and I went to the New Jersey location. We weren't impressed with the quality and taste of the cookies and pastries. It didn't top our favorite Fleetwood Bakery in Mt. Vernon, NY.
2019-03-17,3,It's one of the staples of Hoboken - always packed, always filled with tourists taking pictures of the storefront, and  overpriced for decent pastries. The one thing that I do recommend because it's worth the hype - the lobster tails! My favorites are the Cookies and Cream and Salted Caramel. The Traditional and Chocolate Hazelnut flavor are okay too! They have the crispiness and creaminess of the lobster tails down pat so definitely get a box of those!
2019-03-13,4,Took a quick father daughter trip to New York and New Jersey and decided we had to come to Carlos! The parties we got were very good! The cannoli was the right amount of crunch and the filling was a perfect! While it was a good cannoli, I did have higher expectations because it is Carlos after all. The store was much smaller than expected but it made it better because it was quaint. The area it was in was very cute and charming.
2019-03-09,1,I recently bought $147.00 worth of pastries from Carlo's in Hoboken. Usually they are pretty good pastries. This time however, the eclairs that I got were sour. I called them 4 times and am still waiting for them to call me back. I expected more from them. (8 eclairs @ 5.95 each were only part of the order so I don't understand the issue)
2019-03-08,4,Trip to NJ is not complete without making a stop at Carlo's bakery. Full of visitors just as excited as we were to see a glimpse of buddy and his crew. They do have a buddy cut out :)Small store, wish they had more tables or perhaps add counter top. The store is stocked with lots of delicious looking desserts. Had to try the cannoli, lobster tail, strawberry pasty and cookies. My fave was the lobster tail. It was flaky and the filling was just perfect. Purchased a souvenir shirt. Cookies to go are over priced but it's definitely something you have to check off the bucket list.
2019-03-04,1,Literally any other bakery in Hoboken is a good decision if you have a sweet tooth. This place doesn't even have decent coffee. It's a popular destination because of the TV show but if this is their flagship location, I would never try any of the chain locations throughout the country. Below mediocre, total ripoff, Sam's club has better desserts.
2019-03-03,1,After watching the show for years I was excited to have the opportunity to visit the bakery in person. Sad to say, I was very disappointed. The guy behind the counter was unfriendly, rolled his eyes at me and rushed me out. There was no one else in line behind me, why the hurry?  I didn't feel comfortable and relaxed to pick out what I wanted. I got a cannoli and it was not near what I expected. So disappointed with my whole experience.
2019-03-03,1,Came in on vacation after hearing great things. The family purchased a bunch of what looked like should be delicious and soft pastries, lobster tails, crumb cake etc. After sharing and tasting the pastries we got, we noticed the pastries were cold and hard, almost like they were left out over night and served. I don't think Buddy would endorse this kind of quality. I doubt this was the impression he wanted to leave on the customers he served. At one point one of our cousins asked the server for a cup of water. The server asked another employee if it was ok to give him a cup of water. The man said yeah of course and that's when she responded with well he's already buying the bottle so I'll just let him continue. After reading other reviews it seems like this quality is the trend lately at this location. The family needs to come in and rethink their strategy. If I could leave no stars I would. STAY AWAY
2019-03-03,1,I have to begin this review by saying that I have gone to Carlos's bakery twice. I went once about six to seven years ago at the peak of popularity. When I came here it was very delicious, and you were able to see the family and staff interacting with guests. It was such a good experience especially because I had the chance to come to the show which I looked up to often. Now today, coming here my family and I were very disappointed. The cannolis were very hard and cold. The lobster tails, practically frozen. And to top it off the staff were rude and not helpful. They insisted that they couldn't give us water because "it wasn't recommended from the tap" so they made us buy a $4.00 water bottle. The purpose of this place was to have an experience that you belonged to their "family". You would feel special and enjoy delicious food. Now, it's terrible. I won't be coming back here again, nor bringing family and friends.
2019-03-03,1,Wow what a disappointment ,I came around 4 years ago and cake boss was super big thing and everything was delicious I even made a two hour line for the famous cannoli and lobster tails . But I have to say this was horrible and not the cake boss it was before . Maybe the family should come back and put some working hours instead of this commercialized pastries . The pastries where rock hard not soft of how a puff pastry should be . Cannolis where super crumbly and the crumb cake was harder than a rock . Had to return a lobster tail after one of my tooth almost broke in half . Staff told me that it was supposed to be rock hard which is ridiculous . Even when asking for a glass of tap water they told us we couldn't even have it . For families driving down save your gas and go to ur local bakery . Buddy should come back to visit and retrain
2019-03-02,1,Walnut brownie only had that one on top! Cappuccino was ok, truly small, maybe 5 sips! It was pricey! Nothing to come back to.I would check out any other place in the neighborhood!!
2019-03-02,1,Bought the cheesecake it was mediocre at best definitely not worth what I paid for along with it bought traditional canoli's gritty not alot of taste and that's all in all honesty my local bakery has better tasting items. Not worth the money .
2019-02-24,5,Have to stop you're if you're in the area. Kids love the TV show we love the crumb cake the cannolis and the cookies. It's just one of those places.
2019-02-22,5,beautiful place, wonderful pastries and confections, pricey, but overall a great spot in Hoboken that is historic. My family can likely blame a few of our current pounds to this location.
2019-02-12,1,I watch the show so much and love them so much I drove 3 hours to get some goodys  and was so disappointed when I got back home the cakes was not great it was dry the cup cakes I asked the guy if the red velvet was vanilla cream he said yes when I got home it was coffee cream cookies was hard and dry I'm really sad about this
2019-02-12,3,I visit the Carlos bakery at Hoboken. Its a nice cute shop with a little seating and very conveniently located. Gets quite crowded so don't forget to get a token as soon as you enter.I really recommend the chocolate mousse pastry here. Its a must!! It just melts in your mouth. My second favorite is the red velvet, however the pastry is much better than the actual cake or cake slice.
2019-02-11,5,My go to for a sweet treat or deserts for the office. Staff is amazing and it's always an experience when visiting. Cupcakes are great but the cake slices are to die for.
2019-02-07,5,The best Cannoli's I've ever had! I've tried so many places (East & West Coast) & nothing seems to beat Carlo's Cannoli's. Their filling is so creamy & so good. Unlike other places, they do not fill the cannoli shell until ordered, so the outer shell is always nice & crispy. I loved it so much, I brought some home to CA! I also tried some of their cookies & lobster tail. Super easy to get here from the city too!
2019-01-28,2,I can see what this place used to be but it seems like reality tv has taken this place downhill. I remember seeing the lobster tails and cannolis on tv so definitely wanted to try it while I was out in Hoboken. The bakery just looks so commercialized focusing on the show and no longer the baked goods. We bought the assortment of cannolis and lobster tails as well as a mini cheesecake, and Carlo's bake shop mug. The cheesecake was grossly over baked. There was no reason it should have been that grainy. The shell of the cannolis was quite good and crisp but I found the filling to be rather thick and overmixed with powdered sugar. The only thing we liked were the lobster tails but even those were just okay for the price that we paid. I was also really disappointed in the Carlo's Bake Shop Mug that I bought. The counter lady gave me one that was wrapped in bubble wrap but when I took it out at home I found the mug to be poorly made. The glaze on the outside was uneven and dimpled and there were holes in the base of the mug. I'm a bit worried that I might get lead poisoning if I drink out of it. Debating between throwing it away or leaving it to collect dust in a kitchen cabinet.All in all this is just a check off a bucket list. Will not be coming back to go through that painfully overpriced experience again.
2019-01-28,4,Was visiting Hoboken and I happened to see the famous Carlos bakery which I first got introduced through the show as a kid, so of course, I had to try a little something(not just one thing, but four LOL). Surprisingly it was not that packed the first time we went but I had to go before I left back to Florida again lol. The only complaint I have is the pricing :( it is a tad pricey for sweets but IT IS worth it! The cannolis omg I can have 10 at a time lol, the strawberries covered with dark chocolate were amazing, huge strawberries. The lobster tail- first time trying on- was yummy! I liked it a lot. The cheesecake was just something extra I wanted to try, it was extremely creamy. I hope to go back and see buddy himself lol.
2019-01-28,1,My fiance and I drove hours to Carlo's Bakery for a birthday cake, after being fans of the show for a while. All of the bakery items looked incredible but honestly, that was all I could say positive about the whole experience. It was a Sunday around lunch time, parking wasn't great so we circled the busy neighborhood a few times and eventually settled on parking in a pay by half hour parking lot down the street a few blocks. Walked in the bakery and there was 1 other customer and 2 employees working the counter. Neither employee greeted us nor did they offer any help. We walked over to look at the deserts and the employee stood there and didn't offer any sort of assistance. She seemed bothered to have to help and was not friendly. (Surprising because you would think that they expect out of towners.) We went with a chocolate cannoli and a whole buttercream confetti cake. The cannoli tasted like warm ice cream in a cone but the texture was VERY offputting. The filing was lumpy and I couldn't finish the cannoli. The cake was the biggest disappointment, however. It was vanilla cake with sprinkles and a buttercream frosting with sprinkles. The cake itself was so heavy and almost flavorless and the frosting was AWFUL. It was thick, chewy, and tasted worse than your typical grocery store frosting. One bite was enough sugar to give me a headache and it did not taste like a typical buttercream. I decided to get rid of the rest of the cake out and will not be returning again.
2019-01-26,4,To be able to get some baked goods from here after watching the show for so long is fantastic. The lobster tails are definitely so yum! Crispy and Creamy! I didn't get to try anything else since it was a quick stop but happy to get to try something from Carlos. I hope I can get a chance to try something else when I'm in Jersey again.
2019-01-23,3,You can count on there being a long line during peak hours. It's a pretty big place for a bakery but not a lot of seating. With people always coming in and out, it never seems that clean. The staff moves quickly and keeps the line moving. The deserts are good (my favorite is the cookies and cream lobster tail) but very very overpriced. You're definitely paying for the name. If you must go, just get 1 thing.
2019-01-20,3,"Sugar ah honey honey", after growing up watching Cake Boss in high school, I've always fantasized about walking into the original Carlo's Bakery and ordering all the sugary confections I could eat. 10 years later, I was able to make that dream come true. I got the lobster tail, the cannoli, a cream puff, a chocolate chip cookie, a slice of the rainbow cake, and an order of the Italian cookies. I did not eat it all in one setting, it was two. There is a lot of sugar, I would advise spreading your treats out and saving it when you need it most! The rainbow cake was way too sugary, frosting was worse. I would recommend the lobster tail or the cannoli. Everything else may give you diabetes.
2019-01-08,5,When I visited New Jersey a few years ago, I knew I had to go to Carlos bakery. I loved the show cake boss and wanted to see the bakery in person. I was excited to get to try the delicious pastries that this place makes. It was not too busy at the time that I went which was nice because I did not have to wait in any long lines. It's been a while since I've been to New Jersey but definitely want to go back to get some more pastries from Carlos bakery.
2019-01-05,1,TERRIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES!!!I know the Morristown location is closing for good today, so I went by yesterday and picked up a few last treats.  I got (paying full price) a cupcake, mini cheesecake, tiramisu, and slice of strawberry shortcake. I was looking forward to presenting my treats to my family.  My daughter decided to have the cupcake after dinner. It was so dried out and hard that it was inedible!!! We even tried to revive it in the microwave, to no avail. It ended up in the trash. I have yet to try the other items. I live close by so as I passed by Carlos' this morning I stopped in to tell them about my experience and warn them about the condition of their product so another customer wouldn't have my experience. As I was talking to the "manager" she literally said "well we aren't selling anything today so..." as she just walked away from me. If they are not selling any product, why are they open (according to the sign on the door) and why do they still have product sitting in the cases? I got no apology or offer for a refund, NOTHING! If this is the way The Cake Boss operates when he is closing one store, I cannot fathom why anyone would visit any of his other locations.
2018-12-31,3,As much as I love the show I have to admit the cake I bought was horrible in taste which was the cookies and cream cake! I also got variety pack of cupcakes and they weren't something to rave about! I bought a box of cookies and they were pretty good! The cannoli with chocolate chip wasn't great but the lobster tail was delicious that I can honestly say was the only desert I liked out of everything!! Buddy's sister Grace helped us with our order and she had ok customer service I know she was busy so kinda felt a little rushed in ordering! As much as I dislike to give this a 3 star review I'm not going to lie about how everything tasted it's only due to what we bought and weren't happy with!!!
2018-12-25,3,The mousse is delicious. But the cakes are very sweet. So I might as well make my birthday cake instead of buying it. They are good looking though.
2018-12-24,2,I'm giving this place a 2 because I'm big in customer service. Only because of the customer service I received from one of the workers...which later I found out was in fact the owners aunt. She was taking our order my family speaks Spanish and I speak perfect English. Another worker passes by and she starts bickering to that employee to take someone else in like because it looks crazy. Mind you there's only one couple in line and next to them always a group of people who already ordered and we're just looking at the desserts at the end and they were on the other side of the red rope. Then because I asked my family something in Spanish she quickly called upon a Hispanic worker and said in front of us "here take them they might understand you better because they speak Spanish".... very disappointed. But every other worker there was exceptional and the cannolis were great! I loved the food and the other employees were so nice to us.
2018-12-24,4,I don't know why there are so many meh reviews. I really enjoy the food/pastries. Sometimes there is a wait, but just be prepped and deal with it. I don't want to go to an empty shoppe- that means no one else does either.
2018-12-24,4,Yes this is a tourist trap and a shameless sellout to the reality TV show, but it holds a little secret. Those lobster tails are delicious and the high turnover means they're nearly always fresh.
2018-12-17,5,We love this bakery! I've always loved the show, but eating the pastries is an experience itself. Although on the pricey side, I would say it is worth the cost for fresh and delicious pastries. We tried the peanut butter cookie (amazing), the cannolis (the best), and the lobster tail (so good!). The service was great and we did not have to wait, although this may vary by time or day. Seriously- check this place out!
2018-12-11,2,A friend and I were in the neighborhood to do some shopping and decided to stop here as both of us are long time fans of Cake Boss and have always wanted to go. With so much hype and history I expected a positive experience but was let down tremendously by the mediocre quality of the desserts and depressing atmosphere of the bakery. All of the employees looked miserable. The cannoli - which is supposed to be the signature item - was inedible and thrown away after one bite. Needless to say I was very disappointed and will never ever try Carlo's again
2018-12-11,3,I have heard of this place from a lot of my friends and I was walking by so wanted to try something from here. After seeing their food on display, I was disappointed as it wasnt appealing and most of them were not even looking fresh. It may be because I went their at night around 8pm. I got one american napolean and one chocolate fudge cupcake. Napolean - it had a thick layer of white chocolate icing on the top which I dint like it at all. I had to remove that before eating the actual pastry. Even though inside filling was good and pastry was crisp, I felt it was not fresh. Cupcake - It was actually better than the pastry. The buttercream was good and cupcake was thick and dense. I would have enjoyed it more if it was fresh.
2018-12-10,2,I was really disappointed in the cheesecake I got it was really lumpy inside and didn't taste like it was mixed all the way it still had clumps of sugar in it to the point I didnt finish it my boyfriend loved the chocolate cake he got though so that made me happy the employees also seemed really annoyed they were fighting among themselves almost the whole time we were there so it made it uncomfortable was really not what I was expecting for my first visit and probably my last was hoping to do my wedding cake here but changed my mind after this experience
2018-12-04,4,I'm really surprised by the low stars here. We ordered a slice of rainbow cake, cannoli, and the cupcake. Everything was so good! I'm a cupcake snob, so I'm usually a harsh critic with the cupcakes, and the Oreo cupcake was delicious! The staff was so friendly and helpful. I do wish they had more seating for guests wanting to eat at the restaurant. I'm sure it's because there's usually long lines. We went on a Tuesday at 11:00am and there wasn't a line at all!
2018-11-26,3,Got there as they opened to get the rainbow layered cake & as beautiful as the cake was, I was underwhelmed by the cake. I paid about $18 for a slice of cake, a cannoli & a lobster tail which seems on the high end for bakery goods considering that other than the cake, the other items aren't too big. I did appreciate all the goodies though because I have a huge sweet tooth that loves anything with sugar. I think they're more hyped for their crazy huge creations on TV rather than everyday desserts which a regular person would want to stop by or have.
2018-11-19,5,They were so nice! Maddalena and Mauro were there and Maddalena was amazing and willing to take pictures with my family and I. The staff made the trip down to Hoboken worth it! The pastries are as yummy as they look like on the show. I opted for a strawberry shortcake and a crumb cake to go. I would definitely recommend this place and am planning on returning back for a cute cake boss mug. I can check this off my bucket list now! :)
2018-11-19,5,Absolutely loved Carlo's Bakery! I had been wanting to go here for years, and I have to say it did not disappoint! We had the lobster tail and a chocolate covered cannoli, both of which were absolutely amazing. To top it off, the service was amazing as well - everyone behind the counter was very welcoming and friendly. I will definitely be coming back to Carlo's when I make it back to the East Coast.
2018-11-17,5,5 star and here is why:My 10 yr. old daughter is obsessed with Cake Boss and her dream is to become a pastry chef. So when we had a day layover in Newark we decided to take her to Carlo's to see one of her favorite shows in person. She was so excited to not only see the bakery but eat one of their famous desserts- and yes they were delicious. But what made this a 5 star experience was that Joe,Mary and Lisa were actually there working. Watching her smile so big to actually see them made this mother's heart full with so much love. Then with shaking hands she braved to ask them if they would take a photo- and without any hesitation they obliged. When your child tells you that this made their trip- all a parent can do is be happy and thankful!!! Thank you for all!!
2018-11-16,4,Sooo I can't eat most of everything here...But, they did offer some suggestions when we asked for gluten free.They had two different cheesecakes, so that's something!I thought the crustless cheesecake was actually really quite good.  I ate it very fast!  It was small, good portion, and not too sweet at all.  Great consistency and texture.We also had to order a cannoli, though we opened it up and just ate the inside.  It was good, though without the fried outside it was obviously only half as good.The service was quick and the ladies behind the counter were polite and helpful.There are only three two tops inside, which were full, so we had to stand and eat inside which was a bummer.  But it IS a small place, so I get it...
2018-11-13,5,Okay, their original shop in Hoboken is great! I was so excited to come here! I wanted to try everything! Was hoping to get the rainbow layered cake, but they were already sold out! It was 1pm! But still got other great products. We got the M&M cookie, strawberry cheesecake, and variety of cannolis. All were amazing! The cookie was chewy and soft, just how a cookie should be. The strawberry cheesecake was perfectly made. Fluffy but dense, sweet, but not overwhelmingly sweet. The strawberry was dipped in a sweet red coating. Finally the cannolis were filled with different creams, all were fluffy, sweet. Perfect for the outer shell would definitely recommend this place.
2018-11-05,3,Of course I came here because of Cake Boss. Love the show not so much their pastries. I got a cream puff and a lobster claw. I will say both were very dry and not tasty at all. I definitely had better pastries at a small/ unknown Italian bakeries in Brooklyn than here. Every time I'm in Hoboken I tried to make it to Carlo's Bakery hoping to get a delicious pastries but somehow always get disappointed.
2018-10-29,3,I stopped by today for a coffee and a pastry. I asked for a cappuccino and instead got a cup full of steamed milk. I will def go back for a pastry only.
2018-10-23,3,I came here for Buddy! This was one of my top places I wanted to visit after watching Cake Boss. I am a huge fan! Thank goodness this original Carlo's was walking distance to where we were staying!I have always admired Buddy's cakes and pastries on the show, and now I can finally say I've tried their cannoli! I know of others who have visited and have met Buddy! I wish that was the case when we arrived. We ended up ordering 2 cannolis and a lobster tail. You are definitely paying for the name here, because it was my first time trying a cannoli and I didn't like it (I am a sweet tooth!). The pastries didn't taste fresh. Not to disrespect Buddy's products, but it tastes like something you'd get at an Albertson's market. I paid ~$20 for all three items. You can see how expensive these pastries are.
2018-10-20,5,We thoroughly enjoyed our cannolis regular and chocolate:) we also met Mauro and the sisters! Very nice folks. Thank you all the way from Alaska!
2018-10-14,4,Good coffee and pastries. A little bit pricey!
2018-10-11,5,I have a guilty pleasure. Carlo's has this ridiculous looking rainbow cake that reminds me of childhood birthday cake from the 70s -- insanely sugary and pretty amazing. I love it -- even though I feel a little light headed after eating it.
2018-10-08,2,They do not do justice to their popularity! Their cakes and other stuff is pretty average. There are better bakeries in Hoboken. Don't waste ur money and time waiting in line here.
2018-10-05,5,love the show and love the shop even more. lines are long but thats what you have to do to bite into and taste the most delicious cakes and pastries. yum! im a satisfied customer !
2018-09-23,5,The store that started it all. Had to stop in once I saw that there was no crazy waiting line. Got my usual cannoli and lobster tail. They were very delicious. Definitely worth picking up something here if you get the chance and there's no crazy waiting line.
2018-09-10,2,Went there to get a cupcake for my cousin who  is Vegan I asked for Vegan options(anything) but they have none! I understand I am not a cupcake snob but this company has the best location and in the worst part of town (in terms of parking).I can only comment on what I tried which was Red Velvet  cupcake..that  really disappointed me!The Vanilla, Orange frosting cupcakes did only taste good because of the frosting.My only advice is: Spending more time and money upfront perfecting a product before it hits the market will minimize customer complaints and returns.Note: what should we eat next time we are there what is your most recommended bakery item?
2018-09-03,5,Today I did CrossFit. So I felt less guilty walking into this bakery for the very first time because there was a crowd going in. Then I found out this place is an effing institution here. And everything looked delicious. And the air was wafting with the faint and delicate scent of sugar and flour mixed in intoxicating combos. I succumbed to the simplest of them all: vanilla lobster tail. Mmm. Heavenly.
2018-09-02,4,A tourist must-see in Hoboken. It's famous as you can tell from some tv show. My friend took me here when I was a tourist, and she got me a lobster tail. Don't ask questions just do it. You will not regret it. Amazing quality, fresh, decadent cream, flaky crispy airy pastry...just yes. It's a kitschy thing but just go. Then walk to the park down the way and take in amazing views of Manhattan. Then take a ferry back. It's fun.
2018-08-30,1,Quoted me over $1400 for a 70 person naked cake. Outrageous! Kicker was that it took them over two weeks to get back to me on the quote. Had another bakery make it for less then half that & it was perfect.
2018-08-26,1,This place is a tourist trap! About ten years ago, I bought a cake. The cake was dry and stale. I complained to the bakery and were rude. This place can scam people who do not know any better. For instance, why does a cannoli have no cream in the middle? This place is only surviving because of a show and tourists who do not know better. No local or yuppie would not step foot in.
2018-08-24,2,Im very disappointed with the customer service from Carlos Bake Shop went here as a little girl and was such a simple place now it looks nothing like before. The man who was taking our order was very impatient and we took some time to look at the food. Then when I asked him what the most popular  ones were he was rude and snappy. We payed 7.95  for the smallest cheesecake ever tho it was very good. Very disappointed with Carlos Bakery.
2018-08-24,2,So I've been here a few times. I have giving it a few chances because hey it Carlos bakery right? Everything I've gotten from cupcakes,slices of cakes,a coffee cakes were just ok and not very fresh. I will not be going bake again.
2018-08-23,1,Please please please do yourself a favor! I found a bug baked into my cake!!!! I don't know what kind cause it was pretty mangled but I could distinguish the body and the legs!!! Uccckk!! So gross!! I had to throw my birthday cake out in front of everyone!!!! T
2018-08-20,5,I am one of those lucky souls who has a Carlo's Bakery less than 30 minutes away.... or should I say unlucky. Whatever it is, the original Carlo's Bakery has no comparison to their crappy incarnations around the country. This place has the goods. Everything that we got was amazingly good, so good that I had no time to snap a pic. But trust me, this place is a good Italian bakery.
2018-08-15,3,I don't believe it would be worth traveling far to eat here. Since I was already in Hoboken and just walking down Washington, I decided to try it. The interior was highly commercialized with large flat screen menus and apparel everywhere. Although the staff members were friendly, he could not answer my question about the filling of the original lobster tail. I have to say I enjoyed it but the flavor of Baileys was too overpowering. The items were presented nicely in the display shelf but I didn't bother to try anything else. There was no one inside on a rainy week day evening. If you really want a taste of NY/NJ italian baked goods, go to a small neighborhood place that probably has not yet been reviewed on yelp!
2018-08-14,2,Lots of butter and sugar. Nothing more. Just fameous of the tv show. I have eaten better cakes before.Tereyağı ve mısır şurubundan şeker deryası. İstanbul'da çok daha iyi pastaneler var.
2018-08-13,5,Sweet counter help... Red Velvet for me since they were sold out of the cannolis!  Such a fun walking scene!
2018-08-10,3,It was just okay. The prices are eye popping high for sweets. The red velvet slice of cake was the only thing that was actually good. The double chocolate cookie was a fail. The cheesecake was ehhh. The cannoli wasn't that good either. I really wanted to like this place because I liked the show. It's a hype thing.
2018-08-09,3,Little upset how they close the door right at 9pm without a five minute courtesy. I've lived in hoboken for two years, and the bakery feels very commercialized. Very sad. :(
2018-08-09,3,Definitely overhyped. The pastries etc were quite wonderful (we got an assortment), but so overpriced - and I am from the Bay Area where everything is expensive. So, as long as you are ready to pay and wait in line, you will truly enjoy the pastries.
2018-08-07,5,Oh man, the dessert were amazing. I only tired the cannoli, cheesecake, carrot cake and they were amazing. But I'm sure everything else will taste just as good.
2018-08-06,3,Been a fan of Carlo's Bakery and I had visited the store before and after the renovation.  I noticed now that for being the flagship store, they don't carry the delicious desserts and pastries we remembered they once had.  Yes they had the cannoli's and lobster tails but the cupcakes were never completely stocked.  We were in Hoboken for the about 7 days and we went everyday to the bakery and everyday there was something missing. One day, the rainbow cake was out.  The next day the vanilla with chocolate cupcake were out and neither of them were re-stocked.  You would ask them and they would say I don't know.  So much for the great Carlo's Bakery, left disappointed and feeling that the fame has gotten to them and they are just becoming another "Meh" bakery.
2018-08-04,5,Huge variety of pastries and cakes. We all found something we loved. The shop is great. I wouldn't go anywhere else!
2018-08-03,5,Okay this place has a lot of crappy reviews that I anxiously read as my Uber pulled up to the bakery.  I was really hoping they weren't true, as I'm such a huge Cake Boss fan, and the show always led me to believe that this stuff is amazing.  Thankfully, I can say it really was amazing-- Buddy really knows what he's doing!While I know most people come here for the pastries and cannolis, I had to order a slice of cake as he is the CAKE boss.  I ordered the rainbow cake (basically just vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream), and per my Uber driver's recommendation, the peanut butter cookie.  I have to say I'm not usually a huge fan of cake-- so many things could be wrong with it: too dry, not enough flavor, too sweet, too much frosting, too little frosting, etc.  While this cake was SUPER sweet, it was a stellar cake in my book!  Extremely fresh, soft, and moist without being too wet.  The cake to frosting ratio in each layer was absolutely perfect.  If I lived closer, I'd order this cake for every celebration I ever have form here on out.  The peanut butter cookie, while I wasn't expecting much, was actually a fabulous cookie.  It was thin, but super soft and chewy.  Extremely oily and buttery and had that perfect peanut butter flavor and a few nice chunks of peanut butter chips for added texture.  This is probably the best peanut butter cookie I've ever had.  I may actually rank this above the cake!If you're a fan of the show, or even if you're not-- stop by this bakery!  I came around 4 pm on a Thursday and there was no line, but still plenty of options to choose from (which is surprising given that that's pretty late in the day for a bakery).  Fabulous treats, thanks Buddy!
2018-07-30,4,Canoli was fantastic! Cookies were good too and not that much of a line when I came in on a Monday. Just a little sad that its become such of a tourist trap. I was hoping to see some of the cast members. Not even sure if they still make the stuff anymore. Tasted great though.
2018-07-26,1,So sad. I love in queens ny my son was shooting a comercial 5 min away from this beakery znd tommorow hisc6th birthday I decided to stop and by him a birthday cake at carlos as I know its famuse. He choose the strawberry cake infront of the window and some 4 beach cupcakes. We are really in a rush so I run to pay and the guy put the cake inside the box and on top thecupcakes. I got home 2 houres ago (just one houre after I proches the cake) and I took it out omg the strawberry so old u can see it's not fresh and probobly stand there for few days its not the first nice fresh cake we see in the window. I can say the cupcakes not fresh as well. Very sad such a famuse place shoud know better. I spend 45$ for nothing and I need to run buy new cake.  So look good what u buying! But better just go to diffrent beakery where evrything is fresh.
2018-07-23,5,My friend surprised me with a rainbow layer birthday cake. The outside of the cake was fondant unicorn and the inside was layered with cake and buttercream. It was such a delicious and beautiful cake. It accommodates more than 8 people with a decent size cut. I look forward to visiting the bake shop myself one day and trying other creations.
2018-07-23,5,Best cannoli ever, super cute shop and so many amazing options to choose from, will definitely be returning! Maybe next time Buddy will be around!
2018-07-20,3,Meh.  That is literally the best word I can come up with for this place.  It's over hyped, to be honest, but worth the visit if nothing else than for $1 cannoli day.There's usually a long line on weekends because of all of the tourists that come to visit.  Your best bet in terms of timing is mid week, and during the day where possible.Their prices aren't the issue, I think it's just that there are so many other really good Italian places where you can get desserts that it's not worth the fuss.I will say, their cannoli filling is great, and if you're into cheesecake, they make a great ricotta cheesecake (if you have an Italian grandmother, you know what I'm talking about).  For those that haven't tried, it's a lighter, whipped, more rustic version of a traditional cheesecake.  Get a piece for sure!
2018-07-19,3,I never had any of his desserts or seen his show but I have seen the commercials. I live in Manhattan and I seen his store in Midtown and I did not go in because the line was too long. Once I seen this store, I was happy because I heard this is the original store. I brought 3 different desserts, all of it was a Waste of Money except the Lobster Claw! The red velvet cake was a 2 on a scale from 1-5 and the cannoli gets a 3.The Lobster claw was very good and I will definitely get that again! I should have brought three of those instead of the other BLAHHH items I picked out.
2018-07-18,5,I had the strawberry shortcake, red velvet cake and the cheesecake. All of them were tasty, rich and not too sweet.
2018-07-16,4,Mostly GreatWe were here around Christmas and the line was out the door but it went quickly. We had hot chocolate, got a free mug due to our purchase amount and left feeling quite satisfied with the experience. We ordered the lobster tails, canolli, crumb cake and cupcakes. Everything was wonderful, especially the cannoli.  My husband wished I had ordered more. The cupcakes, however, weren't great. Some were fine but one tasted so bad we couldn't eat it. It was the icing was awful. So I would go back, but I wouldn't order cupcakes.
2018-07-15,5,Everything from cookies to cakes and cannolis were amazing will be back again soon!  People say it's more of a tourist trap but I say it's authentically good!
2018-07-14,4,I was expecting a large line, but fortunately there were no customers. Unfortunately, no one from the tv show was their and I should've known not to expect anyone to be there  but I still hoped. Anyway, the cannolis weren't my favorite (too much filling) but the lobster tails were to die for!!
2018-07-13,1,Imma go their again during Halloween, this place is a nightmare! Haha no I would rather throw my money down the toilet before making an effort of going there again! I love the TV show, don't ruin it for yourself by going their! remember, is a TV show!
2018-07-12,1,Though this is a very famous bakery shop, I hate their cakes. They add pounds of sugar and you don't taste any flavor but only sugar. Waste of money!!
2018-07-07,2,I moved to Hoboken from Dallas 10 months ago. My family is coming to visit and I wanted a special dessert to share so I made my first cake purchase at the famous Carlo's Bakery. I didn't see the cake before they boxed it for me. If I had I would have asked for a different cake before I left the shop. When I got home what a disappointment there were two cracks in the icing, one in each side of the cake. It looks like the buttercream frosting was too thin in places. It just got left in the icebox too long so it dried up and cracked. I really expected more from Carlo's.
2018-07-04,3,Had the lobster tail, cannoli, cupcake and chocolate cake. The lobster tail was my favorite. A bit over priced, but came for the experience.
2018-07-01,3,A lot of hype and excitement to try this place and it was about the same quality as the grocery store bakery. Service was good, food was good, but perhaps our expectations were too high.
2018-07-01,4,The history of the bakery and town is truly one of a kind. The baked good were average but I still enjoyed the whole experience. The black and white cookies were the best I will admit! The staff were polite and informative. They had nothing but good things to say about Carlo and his family.
2018-06-26,3,So disappointed this morning. No sesame cookies. What Italian bakery doesn't have sesame cookies. They were my favorite item at the bakery.   No crumb buns either. But I have to say the cheese danish was delicious.
2018-06-26,5,Nice little shop. Friendly staff- with great lobster claws!Went in the afternoon, no wait at all. Enjoyed this bakery and the other shops on the street.Not a bad train ride from the WTC Path station either, about 5 minutes.
2018-06-25,5,it was make me confused about review, but i stopped by with my family anyway, cause my child is a big fan of him..ease to find parking on Saturday afternoon, not much crowded and line flows with smiley helper to take my order...all pastry and cake just simply delicious, cake not dry, light and has good balance from frosting. lobster tail is A must try, and cannoli is very smooth rich with full flavor crunch shell..i'd stop by for something so simple and excellent taste...
2018-06-22,3,Attended a wedding and the cake was from this bakery.  It was just ok .... the edges were burnt on the actual cake under the 2 inches of sugar frosting.  It was hard and tasted burnt. I don't drink and so there was no doubt about what I tasted. I hope the bride and groom didn't pay much for it.
2018-06-20,5,This was something my family and I just had to do while in NYC. We expected to be standing in a huge line, but when we got there it was almost empty. Someone took your order on the outside of the counter which made it a lot easier than having to talk over the counters. After watching the tv-show for years we had really high hopes, but we're scared that the goods wouldn't taste as good as they look on tv, but we were not disappointed, in fact we were surprised at how amazing the baked goods tasted! 10/10 would recommend!
2018-06-19,1,Not sure what all the hype is about. Came in when they opened for the day. Not the most warmest welcoming despite me being the only customer. Got an assortment of pastries and spend close to $20. The quality wasn't great and everything was overpriced. Not going back.
2018-06-17,3,Gabby! That's who made this tourist destination worth the visit. We brought our two Italian exchange students in to visit and enjoy what they've enjoyed on tv. We loved the Italian cheese cake, chocolate mouse, and cannoli. But Gaby's hospitality made the trip.
2018-06-13,4,The food is to die for. It's clean and the people are wonderful. I'd been dreaming of coming here since I was 10. Its definitely something I can mark off my bucket list. The only issues were how commercialized its become. The cakes are made in a factory and you'll be lucky to see anyone from the family. I get it, but it's still disappointing. Overall it's great, but not quite what I was expecting.
2018-05-31,4,I work right around the from this bakery. I saw mixed reviews on yelp- but I don't like to make a statement until I try them it. So I walked over one morning and got a few pastries for my coworkers and I. The service was pretty fast despite what I read on yelp. I was worried that I would be there for over 30 min, but I was in and out in about five. Everyone seemed to like the selection and I was also happy that we were all liked the change in Food. There are a few more things on the menu that I would like to try out. I do feel like the reason why the rush isn't as bad as it used to be is because they move to a much bigger location. I walked past the old one and saw a sign saying that they moved. I will try them a few more times to taste fast different items!
2018-05-28,5,We traveled all the way from Florida to this bakery and it was worth every penny. The French vanilla and Nutella lobster pastry was to die for.
2018-05-27,4,Was in NYC for the weekend and had to stop by the original Carlo's. I tried the cannoli and the lobster tail. The cannoli was average I thought the shell was not as crisp as it should be. The lobster tail was amazing!!! It didn't disappoint. If you're a fan of the show, I think it's worth a visit.
2018-05-25,4,Unlike most of the people doing these reviews, I'm actually not the biggest fan of Cake Boss. Having said that, I just started a job in Hoboken so I figured I'd give Carlo's a shot.I tried the original Lobster Tail since that's their speciality and I regret to say it's actually quite good. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and not as messy as I thought it would be. A little pricier than I would've liked, though.You win this round, Buddy Valastro.
2018-05-16,5,Always been a fan, still a fan. I was first introduced to Carlo's Bakery through the show. Then there was a shop in Vegas and I had the opportunity to taste the lobster tails. Dallas opened up two shops. Lobster tails were still fantastic! I was in the area and was so excited to check out this place considering that it's the original. Lobster tail was amazing still!
2018-05-14,5,Of course I came because of the show. It can't be that good right?!? Welp it is. The Cannolis are amazing. That strawberry cheesecake cake OMGOODNESS!!! I took that sucka back to my hotel room and had a great time all by myself. I didn't even get a picture cause I ate it too fast. I can't wait to go back (I went 2 days in a row btw) again. I wish I could have those Cannolis shipped to me out here in California. They are really delicious. Julie helped me both times I went in and she's the best.
2018-05-13,4,Of course the pastries were delicious !! however there was only 1 person taking orders and at 11 pm last night it was super busy. lines went quicker than I thought but still longer than i'd like. overall it was worth the wait, chocolate dipped cheesecake and cannolis were amazing.
2018-05-08,5,My review is exclusively for the lobster tail. It was sooo sooo good and fresh would definitely recommend. Would recommend visiting, if anything for the experience, if you're a cake boss fan.
2018-05-06,4,Something you just have to do and you won't be disappointed. Whenever I go in there is always cake decorating going on behind the Perspex to admire will your standing in line next to all the yummy cakes and desserts of all flavours and toppings. Cakes, pastries, cupcakes there is everything. I generally get one to eat there and one for later!Time it right and there won't be much of a line. Red velvet is my favourite.. the cheesecakes not bad either! Whole cakes are also available as well as customised cupcakes etc online.
2018-05-05,1,People in town who have been long time fans of the bakery prior to its fame have always said the place was great before even so I've given them a try multiple times hoping to be wowed by something but there isn't anything incredible about pretty generic pastries that are over priced bot going back not recommending it
2018-04-28,4,Two words. CAKE BOSS! If you've ever seen an episode of the show then trying one of their tasty deserts is a must for you, just as it was for me! The environment as soon as you walk through the door is full of energy, the staff is eager to greet you, and the aroma is just wonderful! While there I ordered a strawberry cheesecake and a chocolate mouse cake to go. Both desserts were great, but the mousse was definitely the winner! The cheesecake was slightly too sweet for my taste, and the texture not quite as smooth as I had anticipated. The mousse however was amazing! The texture was just what you would have hoped for, and the chocolate was not too rich or too sweet. There was also a thin layer of cake at the bottom which brought all the textures together.Whether you're a fan of the Cake Boss or have never heard of it. I would definitely recommend giving it a try! Especially the chocolate mousse!
2018-04-26,2,Four stars for the delicious pastry, zero stars for the fact that they were late with an incomplete delivery, and to a memorial service for a friend's deceased family member no less, something they were made aware of at time of order. The service was in Westfield and the order was originally placed through the Carlo's Bakery in Westfield, which abruptly closed just days before the memorial service. They assured my friend nothing would change and that they would deliver from the Hoboken location. Part of the order included coffee, which was not delivered. The driver said they didn't have any more coffee delivery containers when he dropped off the pastries. WTH? This was a memorial service at a church. You would think that Carlo's would have made other arrangements to get a coffee delivery to the service, but, they didn't. Sometimes people need to make business decisions on principle, as in "doing the honorable thing". My principles tell me to never order from or recommend Carlo's again based on inconsiderate and poor service, no matter the quality of their baked goods.
2018-04-25,2,This is my first time at Carlo Bakery...I was so excited to see this rainbow sprinkle cake on Carlo Bakery Instagram. I told myself I had to have it for my birthday.. it is so pretty. Once I picked up the cake from Hoboken, N.J.  It was what I expected. The issue was when I taste the cake. It taste like I was eating butter out of the bucket.. it had more butter cream than cake.. No one at my gathering really enjoyed it.. I was not happy... I'm sorry I had so much high hopes.....
2018-04-21,3,Can here with friends was expecting better. The deserts were okay I didn't find them to have any wow factor.  Front counter low on staff and slow service. Personally with the big tv show I would expect better.
2018-04-17,5,To be honest I had my expectations low coming in. With popularity of the series I expected high prices, crowds, and tons of self-promotional merchandise. Instead, there was a quiet pastry shop with reasonable prices, friendly service, and delicious sweets. Too bad Buddy wasn't there for a photo with our daughter, a young fan who dragged our entire large group of three families all the way from NYC to Hoboken just to visit the bakery ;) Well maybe the next time...
2018-04-15,3,Was so excited about this bakery after years of watching Cake Boss on TLC. Ordered two cookies and a hazelnut lobster tail, very delicious!! However, customer service was pretty disappointing and sort of ruined the whole experience. Cashier looked like he'd rather be anywhere else and was not very welcoming once finally fulfilling our order. Great tasting but eh on the experience.
2018-04-14,5,My first bite off of their cream puff was such a heavenly experience that I totally forgot about how pricey I thought they were! As soon as I got home, I'm already thinking about when I could get more of those perfect cream puffs! It was the right amount of cream and the right amount of dough, light and fluffy and not too sweet!
2018-04-12,2,Glad I got to stop and experience the original Carlos's Bakery but words can express my disappointment when I sunk my teeth into what I thought was going to be a delicious cupcake.  First, when I ordered my chocolate and red velvet cupcakes they looked far different in the pretty case than they did when I received them in my to go pack.  The ones on display had about double the icing as the ones I received.  Secondly, after seeing all the faces and reactions taking bites of delicious cakes on the Cake Boss, I had at a minimum, a medium to high level of expectation.  When I got back to my hotel room and sat on my bed, excitedly opening my box of goodies, took a big bite and........the buttercream icing was literally the worst I've ever eaten..:and I consider myself a buttercream connoisseur, and the cake, very dry.  Both the chocolate and red velvet were equally dry and lackluster in taste.  I guess they don't really have to make good desserts because people are going to buy from them anyway since it's a tourist attraction but I feel like my family let me down since I've watched them on tv so long.  I still love your family,  but man, i would have rather eaten a Walmart cupcake  :-/
2018-04-05,3,Growing up I have watched the show cake boss and every episode I had grown more and more eager to visit the holy land Carlos Bakery. Pulling up in our uber i was ecstatic! My childhood dreams were being fulfilled. We got in and immediately I notice there is only three tables that were all occupied. We get in line and start to order I see there is not meany options but I would argue it adds to the old Italian theme. However when we eat our cake I notice it tastes worse than my local Kroger red velvet cake, I go on to try the rest and I just keep getting more and more disappointed. However the whipped cream on one of the cakes we got was the bomb.com. Overall I can't really say if the food was good or not it may had just been my high expectations, the store was very clean and organized however.
2018-04-05,3,Went late one evening ; very small line which was nice. Server was somewhat rude. Cannoli and other pastries were good but not wonderful.
2018-04-04,1,It was on our NYC area bucket list and we were so disappointed. It was like a ghost town in there and the employees weren't very friendly. The cases were scarce only offering 10-12 treat options. Upon biting into the cupcake it was dry and we couldn't even finish it. My daughter hated the frosting..which kid hates the frosting?! Four a quick test for 4 at $20 it was a "never go back" kinda place.
2018-04-02,5,The best Lobster Tails!   I have been eating Italian pastries since I was a little girl and these are sooooooo good!   I was in little Italy recently and had one from Ferrara's,  While it was good,  Carlos is hands down the best! The one from Ferrara's was very custard like, while Carlo's are so lightly sweet and 'fluffy',  with a very subtle hint of liquor.  Now I need another one ASAP.!
2018-03-31,5,So much to choose from you don't know what to order first. Lines can be long but worth the wait. If your in the area and want a desert it's a great place to stop and get a cup of coffee and a nice desert while you walk around the area and site see. ChrisNYCrealestate.com
2018-03-23,5,So delicious and the staff were extremely friendly!  The Napoleon was the best I've ever had, almost had to turn around and grab another. Really fun stop.
2018-03-21,5,Sincerely, the people that work here are amazing, everyone is really nice and friendly! This location it's really unique it's the original location of a really popular bakery! The pastries were really good, I think it was an excellent experience going there, it also makes special a small town like Hoboken in New Jersey
2018-03-15,4,loved the Linzer Tart-- they held up very well, even after being banged around on a plane and rental car and lasting in the fridge after 3 days, still a pretty darn good tart.cannolis were good but I also come from the land of cannolis (been getting them from Mikes in Boston and Florentina in W Mass) so there is a high bar when it comes to the cannoli.good, clean shop and overall, management seemed to moderately care about the customer experience
2018-03-12,1,Worst cakes and service. I had ordered 4 birthday cakes in last one month. The first time I complained about the cake, the customer service said we will get back to you. I asked for full refund but they said we will give you 20% on your next purchase. When i walked in the Store next time to order another cake, I addressed the issue to an employee working at the Hoboken Store. She said my manager will get back to you. Even after all this I went in to get a couple more birthday cakes for my roommate. First thing nobody is interested in addressing that we are disappointed with the cakes till now. Even the new cake I ordered was not good. They never have the chocolate mousse cake in stock, whichever is the only good cake they have. Rest of the cakes are bad. We had to garbage the cake as nobody ate even 50% of it.
2018-03-10,2,After moving to NJ I just HAD to try Carlo's Bakery. Their cakes on TV always leave me salivating and their cake designs are so artistically extravagant. Of course I didn't expect an extravagant cake when I walked in on a random afternoon. Luckily, there was no line and the folks working the counter were super helpful and pleasant. I couldn't decided between the cannoli's, red velvet cake, or a cookie... so I bought them all. I was so excited to try their cannoli's due to the show. The cake and cookie were just going to top it off. This is where I was disappointed... the cannoli was stale and I just couldn't figure out why they love them so much. The cream filling just taste like sugar, no flavor -- bland. Is that normal for a cannoli? I was thinking maybe the red velvet cake would make up for it so I tried that next. Nope. The cake and icing taste like the 6-pack factory-made grocery store cake. The cake was dry and the icing was just the overly sweet sugar filling that you get on generic cupcakes. The cookie was good but by then I was over it. Pricing wasn't crazy for a famous bakery but this place is not one that I'd recommend unless for a tourist. Just watch the show and enjoy it that way.
2018-03-01,1,Overrated & Overpriced. Just buying the name. Very sad. Loved it so much before they became famous.
2018-02-23,3,Colorful, famous, and a fun stop-in while in Hoboken, but definitely not the best cupcake I ever had. I got the peanut butter topped chocolate cupcake and the cake was a little dry. My girlfriend got a slice of colorful rainbow cake with sprinkles which was perfect for Instagram, but average-tasting.
2018-02-21,2,Keeping it short and simple, Carlo's Bakery is "alright" to be able to say you've been there.  However, just know that there's hundreds more bakeries in the NY/NJ areas that are much better!  I've been 2-3 times, after my first to take other first timers, and each time the line has been down the block and across the street.  When it's like this, you'll stand in line and be given a time to enter for which there's a mob of people inside.  It's impossible to make it to the counter and soon you're just over it all!  Don't misunderstand me though, everything is really good, but almost every bakery in NY/NJ will blow your mind!  Kudos to what he was able to do with his bakery, but for me it's simply a one time visit!
2018-02-20,5,It was my son's wish to come here. We traveled 4 hours to get here and worth it. The place was clean, not too crowded and the staff was very friendly. With so many choices it was very difficult to decide. The staff were very patient, and understanding. Everything we purchased was amazing!!! The best cannolis ever. The cakes were moist and delicious and loved the cookies. I'm glad I don't live there because I'd be there everyday. My son was hoping that Buddy was there. Maybe next time. Thank you
2018-02-19,1,The staff were friendly however the wait time is unnecessarily prolonged.  Each customer must wait THREE different times. First customers must wait on the order line to have the staff write the order on a piece of paper which takes  a really long time.  I waited 15 minutes to have the staff record my order.  Second, you then wait on the cashier line to pay the bill (which takes another 5 minutes) and Third, customers have to wait for someone to pack the pastry into a box or bag since the staff places the pastry on a tray instead of placing the pastry directly into a bag or box. The rating was lowered an extra start since the gentleman in a suit at the cashier told me that I'm lucky I didn't wait 30 minutes instead of 15 minutes to order which was unprofessional in my opinion.  This bakery is packed but now I know it's due to process inefficiencies as opposed to the quality of their products (evident by the average 3 start rating from other customers).
2018-02-13,1,I recently tried a cannoli to see if the place had improved and the cream was spoiled. It's unfortunate that the products can't be better.
2018-02-12,2,There are much better bakeries in NJ, their TV show made them famous and a tourist visit but for real baked good go to another bakery! No crumb cake is ridiculous for a NJ bakery, they seem to market high quantity pastries but not quality and their prices are ridiculously high, I guess your paying for their stardom.
2018-02-11,2,I love everything about Hoboken and I had my heart set that I would love this bakery. The people there were very kind and gave me recommendations on what to get. It was pretty busy on a Sunday night. The salted caramel cream horn was chewy and stale. The sprinkle cookie was hard and pasty (bleh). I would probably try another bakery on Washington street.
2018-02-06,1,Finally after years of watching the show I went. I love Italian food so deserts are always my fav. Had the cannoli and I was severely disappointed! The crust was hard and tasted like it was made a month back! The filling was alright but as a place that says they have authentic Italian taste, they leave much to be desired. Had a cupcake and I wasn't much better, the butter cream tasted buttery but old and kinda had a freezer taste to it. The only good thing was this small dark chocolate circle cake that was worth the money. Other then that nothing was worth the money, most definitely not the service either. I  expected more from them as a whole, but it wasn't worth a single penny.
2018-02-05,3,Very clean store with a variety of pastries. I ordered 2 red velvet cupcakes, a cannoli and some cookies. Overall the staff seems friendly. But the rating should be towards the food not the place. This show was on TV and rated as the best so the bar is set super high but its like a normal bakery to me. The prices should be lower but because its in the Hoboken neighborhood I understand it. I would come back to show people of this place cause it was on TV.
2018-02-05,5,I am a huge fan of cake boss, so of course I just had to stop in here! Went on a Saturday morning around 11:30-12 and there was barely a line. Was able to get in and out very easily (and even sneak tons of pictures outside the place).I am cannoli obsessed so I had to get a ton of them, both the chocolate dipped and the original (and they both were amazing). After that I just started ordering things that looked good to me. The white chocolate mousse and strawberry cheesecake were what else caught my eye and they were both to die for.I hope to one day try everything that they sell because it is all just so delicious! Definitely recommend stopping here!
2018-02-03,4,This place is so cute. Walked by but attracted by the colorful cakes in the case. I thought the dessert only looks good, but superingly.. it tastes so good! not super sweet but tasty. Chocolate cronoli was a good option.
2018-01-29,5,Everithing was delicius, fresh and tasty... we are from chile ... we love the show ...was sunday  when we visit the bakery... cristina was so nice to take pictures with us ... congratulations... we love the bakery Todo un 7 muy lindo y barato, todo se ve muy fresco y rico, somos de chile y viajamos especialmente a conocer la pastelería... pasamos un ratito y nos pudimos sacar fotos con cristina... espero volver muy linda pastelería...
2018-01-28,1,This place is not worth any amount of time or money. Their staff has no idea how to handle even a small crowd. I have been here twice and both times spent well over 30 minutes waiting to even be served. The most recent trip, two friends and I went in and were behind two people in line. You would think a bakery as popular as this one would have some clue as to how to get customers in and out in a timely fashion, but no. We were in line for about 15 minutes while the ONE employee helping customers in line was still with the same customer. There were three female employees behind the counter not doing anything staring at their phones. As the line behind us got longer and longer no other employees helped out and we were waiting in the line for 35 minutes before we decided to just walk out without making a purchase. I will never be returning to this bakery due their lack of customer service. You would think by the way it is ran that this bakery opened yesterday.
2018-01-20,4,Went to NYC for Christmas and I had to go try Carlo's cannolis and lobster tails. The lobster tail was magnificent, super crispy with delicious vanilla filling. It was my favorite pastry for sure. The cannoli was good too. The line wasn't long at all. It was a good experience. Wish I could've gotten the chance to meet any of the sisters as I think they are funny.
2018-01-20,3,Stopped by for a plain cannoli and small coffee, $5. Most of the local reviewers are right. Nothing really special. Similar to other NJ bakeries. But the location is clean, and efficient, runs well and wait wasn't too long. The cannoli was ok. Not too sweet, the crust not overly soggy. Coffee was also well made. Just about $5 worth. Saw a couple items I'd like to try in the future.Recommended for a quick sweet treat. Lines will be long on popular days.
2018-01-19,2,I've been here a few times now, the pastries aren't very nice and the cakes aren't either.We have ordered a few things from Lobster tails to Cannolis to Apple Turnovers and Cupcakes.I think the fame of the brand has taken over the food quality and it is just awful. I can pick up better pastries at 7/11. Save your money and shop elsewhere.
2018-01-17,4,No wonder why this bakery is always full of people ... one of the best tiramisu cake and red velvet cake we had ... went there on my husbands birthday ... we both really enjoyed both the cakes ... would definitely go back again ... totally worth the visit .
2018-01-08,4,Loved being here and seeing where they film. The desserts are amazing as expected but the prices are outrageous. You make enough on your tv and licensing deals that you don't have to jack up the prices to your fans who visits Glad to see I came and saw but won't be back.
2018-01-05,5,I bought an oreo cookies and cream cake and it was delicious!  The crab claws and cheesecake is awesome too!
2017-12-29,5,This was my second visit and we arrive like fifteen minutes till closing and weren't rushed. The pastries and sweets were awesome and gone before they hit the bag good. There wasn't a line this trip so maybe the late night visit was the way to go in the future!
2017-12-20,4,All the cakes here are very good, delicious and fresh- specially chocolate hazelnut. Chocolate mousse was decadent.They are so fresh, never stored, baked on location- unlike the PABT location where sometimes I have found cakes cold and the icing hard. In Hoboken you can actually see the cakes made, being iced and such.Best thing about this location you can pickup regular/birthday cakes without ordering in advance. They take $3 for the fondant message tag. It is delicious though. Their staff is very efficient.
2017-12-20,1,Tasteless, Overpriced ($$$$) cakes and desserts... Initially began purchasing from Carlo's 20+ years ago when they were a local bakery with quality products.  This week I ordered a Christmas Cake for a special luncheon, the guests left most of the cake on their plates.  Carlo's became commercialized their cakes/pies are made with low-grade, imitation ingredients, and mass produced in a factory.    This is definitely my last purchase from Carlo's Bakery.    Do not spend your money on Carlo's Tasteless, overpriced products.  Staff is rude, as a previous reviewer mentioned the staff acts like they are selling you diamonds not a horrible tasting cake.
2017-12-17,4,If you are a first time visitor to NYC I highly recommend taking the short PATH ride over to Hoboken to visit Carlo's. It's about two blocks away from the station passing several really cute shops to stop at along the way. My sister and I spend many days watching the Cake Boss so we had to go. Wednesday is typically a slow day so we walked right in. The staff is super friendly and helpful. We purchased an Oreo lobster tail, pumpkin cheese cake and cannoli. Everything we tried was totally worth it. I didn't check the prices online prior to going and was pleasantly surprise to find it them in a decent range. They also offer hot and cold beverages and places to sit and enjoy your treats. You can watch other items being made in the open kitchen while you enjoy. We took home a cupcake, four lobster tails and two chocolate covered strawberries. If you have a chance - go! Hoboken is a super cute neighborhood. Take a picture of the store front and see if you see Buddy on your trip!
2017-12-15,2,Very disappointed in this bakery. As a tourist I was so excited and it was a must do experience. If I knew someone going I'd tell them to go to see the bakery but not buy anything. We got a cannoli, lobster tail, and cupcake. The lobster tail was the best but still sub par. The cupcake was stiff and tasted days old, buttercream was good on top. Cannoli was extremely crunchy, and not the good time. Save some time and money and head to a dessert food cart or Hershey store.
2017-12-15,3,My 12 years old daughter is the biggest fan of Cake Boss. After all the years of waiting we finally made it from Honolulu, Hawaii to Hoboken, New Jersey. She was so excited about the trip and chance to visiting the original Carol's Bakery store. We bought 4 cannolis, 4 lobster tails, 3 cupcakes, 2 gingerbread man cookies, 1 cannolis cake, 1 chocolate mousse cake and etc. to share with our families. The desserts was excellent just like we thought it would be and I would give the 5 starts anytime for the desserts. But the staffs who worked on the day and time we were there might just gave us the worstest services possible. There was no smile on any of their face, there is no warm welcome feeling when you walk in and it feel like they don't want to be there help customers. I don't think that is how Buddy wants his customers to feel. First, they got my order wrong then 3 people (2 cashiers and 1 person with chef's coat) are arguing how many free glass they should gave me. One per customer or one per transaction??? Who cares??? After we bought all the desserts and a t-shirt (they gave us the wrong one first) with 2 hot chocolate and close to $150 later, I don't think 2 glasses were too much to ask or at lease the cashiers can be nice about it and instead they argue in front of customers.The desserts were great and delicious but the service was big disappointment. My suggestion to all the visitors, you should still visit the shop and enjoy the desserts, check it off from your bucket list but don't expect too much on the customer services. I really hope Buddy can make it back to old family, warm welcoming place again.
2017-12-04,4,I got a small strawberry shortcake and a regular cannoli. I was super excited about the cannoli because it's supposed to be the best. Fortunately, I only bought one cannoli and I'm glad I did. The filling was horrible, it was sandy/gritty and tasted like it's been in the fridge for too long. However, the strawberry shortcake was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!! I wish the sponge cake in between the layers was a little thicker, but overall it was really good.
2017-12-03,2,This was my first trip to Carlo's bakery. Took me about 2 hours round trip. I was able to get parking right out front on a Sunday which was nice. Walked in, no line. Ordered with the lady at the counter, paid, and my name was called within 5 mins. Drove All the way home to find my lobster tails were MISSING. I was so annoyed I called right away, I was told to email and write what happened. Basically the guy didn't care at all about what happened. The cannoli was good though. I don't know how they will fix this, hopefully a refund because I am not driving back to Hoboken. Upset because I reallllly wanted to try a reg and cookies and cream lobster tail. I was so disappointed when I opened the box. So ridiculous, I could understand if they were busy but they were dead.
2017-12-02,1,I was excited to go to Carlos Bakery in Santa Monica which was just opened. We order the regular,salted Carmel and Nutella lobster tail they were very hard it seemed like they were just old . The Nutella one was very nasty . We also order their famous cannolis and they were not all that . We were very very disappointed in the quality of the lobster tail,cannolis and cupcakes. Another thing is that is it over priced because a lobster tail is 5.50 and not worth it at all. So we will never return to buy nothing . I think it's just the hype of cake boss but their products are very low quality and pastries are not worth it at all. So think about going in and spending your money on this
2017-12-02,4,We had to make a stop at the Cake Boss place!! They said the lobster tail was their top seller so of course I had to try one. It was like a slightly crunchier than normal croissant filled with different cream. I tried the chocolate hazelnut. It was pretty good. Also tried the apple cake with a crumble top & that was fantastic. In retrospect I should have also gotten a cupcake so I could try the cake...guess that means I will have to get back sometime! I would highly recommend the apple pie! One of the best I have had (not made by my parents :) ).
2017-11-23,1,Awful!  Go somewhere else!! Things looked good in the case but... Tasted terrible.  Bought apple crumb pie and cannoli's which were both awful! Soggy cannoli's and the apple crumb pie was among the worst we've ever had!   Will never buy anything here again!
2017-11-21,3,The pastries are ok, nothing extraordinary.  I wish they would work on their cake decorating, do it with finesse and precise.  Carlos Bakery is no Freeds bakery from Las Vegas.  Have tou seen the way Freeds decorate their cakes?  Carlos Bakery should do better.  Otherwise, store is good, clean.
2017-11-21,2,I love the pastries ... delicious!! Store is cute. Decorated well. Friendly staff. However, having trouble with getting money credited back after being charged double for one transaction. Called on Saturday -- they said we had to wait until Monday. It's Tuesday and the $81.07 still hasn't been credited back. No responses to my emails. Frustrating and disappointing. Traveled from Seattle Wa to NJ. Carlo's Bakery was our first and last stops during this quick trip. On the first visit, they didn't charge me for a cream puff. After enjoying the delicious little puff of cream, I realized we weren't charged and they had also left off the apparel item. Went to the cashier and asked to be charged for the puff, needed to purchase the apparel item -- it was missed the first time through the line -- and we wanted to buy one more pie to go. They were thankful I was honest about the cream puff .... and quickly charged me for it. When I checked my account online later that day, and noticed the double charge I called.  The first phone rep was really nice. However, the second rep, Tamanea (sp) has yet to follow up with me or respond to my 3 emails. I get automated responses, but nothing more. Quick to get my money; slow to credit my money. Buddy would be disappointed for sure!
2017-11-19,2,I had a piece of their cake from my nephew bday and it did not taste good. The filling in the cake taste like your eating pure butter, disgusting and it was hard not creamy.
2017-11-15,5,Growing up, I've watched Cake Boss and dreamed of tasting the pastries by Buddy! I'm not disappointed, but had a strange expectation of heaps of people out the door. Thankfully because of the bigger location, this store didn't have such a long queue. I ended up ordering:1. Eclair2. Cannoli3. Chocolate Cannoli4. Lobster Tail
2017-11-06,2,I have been here 4 times. I keep hoping that the next pastry I order will be great but every time the food is average at best and very expensive. Maybe the cakes are boss but the cannoli, cheesecake, apple tart, and tiramisu were all just okay.
2017-11-06,5,Napoleon and lobster tail we're excellent. Shop was clean and staff was helpful. Missed Buddy
2017-11-05,2,Pastry's good but they are so slow. This is odd especially since everything is already made and in a case. It's like a high end Dunkin' Donuts that takes 40 minutes to pull a pastry from a case and charge you for it.
2017-11-04,1,not sure why this place is so hyped just based off a tv show, but the desserts suck big time.unless you're into dense, overly sweet cakes, rude AF staff, total chaos and waiting around forever for someone to serve youthe flavors are just very bad, i got a birthday cake and the center was actually still part frozenwhen we cut into it, making me think that it was made days ago and just taken out of the freezer, yuck. the feel and flavor of the fondant was very waxy and eggy, if that makes sense, i would just never ever go in there to spend my money on this...
2017-11-04,4,Have enjoyed watching Cake Boss for years with the family so this was a must while we were here. There is parking around the blocks on the street so may need to walk but not far. There is a line typically out the door but its good for photo ops and selfies. The line continues through the store but gives yiu time to take it all in and look around. Once at the counter the staff was very friendly and got you anything you desire. We picked about 8 items and took it to go as there is limites seating. We split and shared all our treats and it was all very delicious. If your in the area stop in. If youre in a hurry id plan another stop.
2017-11-03,5,Worth the trip to Hoboken and worth every penny, this was an absolute home run. We braved the rain, the wind, and the drive from Manhattan to sink our teeth in the cannolis, the lobster tails, mousse, pumpkin pie, and an eclair. Came out close to $100 and we should have had more, it was THAT good. The lobster tail was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, with the smooth filling just deliciously oozing out. The cannolis are a must-have and we tried both the vanilla & chocolate varieties. The rest of the spread was the perfect compilation of backup desserts, it was just awesome.
2017-11-01,3,Ehhh it was ok . Not the greatest best but not the worst. Order the lobster tail and chocolate canoli
2017-10-30,3,After I told my friend I was staying in Hoboken for part of my trip, she immediately said I needed to check out Cake Boss' bakery.  I've never seen an episode, but figured I should check it out while in the area so did on my last morning for breakfast.  My friend and I stopped by on a Monday and the place wasn't too busy.  I had heard of lines before at this place, but fortunately, we were able to order as soon as we walked in.  We just didn't have a place to sit inside since the small bakery only holds a few tables for dining in.  Some people were even standing around, waiting for a table to open up.  So, I recommend checking this place out early if you can.  We ended up taking our pastries to go and eating across the street on a bench. The cashier told us that the most popular items were the Lobster Tail and the Canolis,  Intrigued by what a Lobster Tail was, I ordered the Cookies & Cream version with a small coffee.  It looked better than it tasted, as the pastry really is shaped into a lobster tail, with sprinkles of Oreo crumbs on top.  However, I wasn't a fan of the pastry itself since parts of it were hard from the ridges, but the Oreo flavored cream inside was yummy!  I didn't even know there was a custard inside the lobster tail, so it was a nice surprise.  I also liked how cold the custard was, as if it had been refrigerated; it had a nice coolness to it.  Overall, if you're in the area and are a fan Cake Boss - stop on by.  I wasn't too fond of the lobster tail, but would try a different item for next time.
2017-10-29,4,The original lobster tail and strawberry shortcake were both amazing. We weren't impressed with the cannolis. They were just ok. The staff was very helpful and friendly. My biggest complaint is the lack of seating. We weren't able to enjoy our desserts there. We went over to Starbucks instead just to find a seat. We went on a Thursday night around 7:30. Although there weren't that many customers, all of the approximately 6 chairs were full. Very frustrating to not be able to enjoy your sweets there.
2017-10-16,1,Your only going here for the name and nothing else. Pastry is nothing Special.  Go to stop @ shop instead. Just as good
2017-10-15,1,This is our fourth visit to Carlo's-the first three visits were great and we even got to see Buddy once but today was a major disappointment-the shop was very clean but there is one third the product that there once was. It used to be each side and the back was full of everyone's favorite products now it's only partially the back and the right side of the store. The staff used to be engaging and fun-now they are indifferent and you could tell they just wanted out of there. And to top it off Washington Street is a mess-there are better roads in third world countries. Don't waste your time.
2017-10-12,2,Came here to indulge my craving for something sweet. Ordered a Reese's cupcake and wanted a decaf coffee but they had none. What a shame! The cupcake was ok, nothing really that floored me with a wow reaction though. Pretty pricey, and too bad the anticipation of having something from here was honestly such a let down. Sorry not sorry I won't be back. There's many other bakeries around to which I would enjoy going and prefer  to give my business.
2017-10-11,4,What a wonderful treat to my stomach.  Had the Lobster Tail croissant filling with delicious treats.And I Ate the whole thing. All 2 in one sitting.
2017-10-04,1,Carlos used to be the best Bakery in town!  Once they started filming the Cake Boss the bakery went down hill.  Most of the cakes and pastries are just ok or tasteless and they are very over priced.  If you must go as many do good luck the line is always long and the staff is rude and impatient.  Stay away from the dry tasteless cupcakes and over priced stale cannoli's.  Talk about letting it go to your head.  It seams they are more interested in the show and selling merchandise than running a business.
2017-10-03,1,Omg this place is so overhyped and underwhelming. The cupcakes are dry, the cakes are overpriced, and the line is always long. I only went there to take my niece who was obsessed with cake boss but even a 10 year old was disappointed by these sweets.
2017-10-03,5,This was a dream come true for me. I can't believe I got to see the original Carlos bakery in Hoboken. We have one in Vegas but it cant beat the first shop of the family's name.When I walked into the restaurant it was very nice, clean, and well kept. I was greeted by a very sweet girl and she took my order on a paper pad. She was very knowledgeable and knew about the desserts and what was inside the pastries. That's super important to me! You gotta know what your selling because nothing is more annoying than asking someone about the product and they have no clue what the product is. On top of that I asked her some questions about the show and she kindly answered them. I got cannolis, lobster tails, an apple turnover, and a Napoleon cake and I am so pleased with my order. I've never had a cannoli in my life and it was so good! The only regret I have is, I wish I bought more! The trip to the bakery was such a blessing! Thanks Buddy for making me one happy customer. You doing a great job! Keep it up boss!
2017-10-01,4,Love their cannolis and their cheesecake with chocolate mouse is amazing. Wish they had a bigger sitting area but everything else was great !
2017-09-29,4,I've wanted to see this place ever since I used to watch Cake Boss. The inside is impeccably clean & the staff is very friendly. I got the mini strawberry cheesecake and it was BY FAR the best cheesecake I've ever had. It was as light as air. The only downside is that parking is hard to come by.
2017-09-23,2,Not even close to the best bakery in Hoboken much less the country, never has been. The place is an "institution" because it is across from city hall and the PATH train and has always been very visible. This place became famous for Buddy's cake decorating skills and he is amazing at that. The actual cake is a no. I've had it on several occasions and never got past 1 bite of dry cake, fondant and horrible filling. The cannoli cream was good but I've never seen more cake thrown out. When they made a cake for a celebration at work a few years ago it looked awesome but I've never seen more garbage cans of cake with 1 or 2 bites taken in my life. Same deal every other time I've had their cake except the cannoli where people ate the filling. Cakes have a lot of parts that are not edible purposely and you are still paying for it.  When we looked for a venue for an occasion a couple of venues offered Carlo"s as an option with another place. Each time we were told they offered because people ask, but the alternate bakery was available if you wanted to actually eat the cake. If you really need to go get an expensive lobster claw. Please know going in that you are paying for TV hype.
2017-09-22,5,Who doesn't love the Cake Boss? The desserts at this place are out of this world. I think we just about sampled everything and you really can't go wrong. The cannolis and tiramisu are a must!
2017-09-17,5,When other bakeries needed at least a week's notice, Carlos made us a custom cake in 3 days.  It was soooooo delish and beautiful.  We did vanilla cake w/ chocolate mousse filling, whipped cream icing and fondant flowers...everyone loved how light it was!!
2017-09-16,1,Buddy should be ashamed of the condition of this restaurant.  Filthy. No place to sit.  Why don't the deserts in the case have little tags/signs to show what the deserts are.  Floor is filthy. Tons of people standing behind counter but no one cleaning??
2017-09-16,3,Our Dark Chocolate Mousse was all over the box once we got ready to eat it :-(But as other reviewers have stated the Lobster Tails are delicious. I am thinking they must be great first thing in the morning when the shop opens. It was a bucket list item to do while in New Jersey. Check!
2017-09-13,3,Aww cool location I wish I saw Carlos. I have been here several times for desserts. Each time has been different. Not in a bad way just that the crowds have totally died down. The desserts here are good and reasonably priced. The staff here has been great super friendly. If you're looking for the folks from tv good luck. But if you're looking for a good snack when in Hoboken definitely stop over. They're pretty solid.
2017-09-11,5,I called four days before the event date to order a customized fondant cake with a picture I found online. I wasn't sure they would be able to accommodate that cuz they are always so busy, but surprisingly they said yes!!! And the price is just the average market price for this type of customized cake. Cake consultant Sarah was awesome and it was an enjoyable process to order the cake. Yesterday when I got the cake, it was even better than the picture- absolutely stunning!!! I loved how it looks so much and it also tasted awesome!!! All my friends loved it!!! I couldn't be happier with the results. Thank you Carlo's Bakery!!!
2017-09-10,5,Took it off my bucket list.. it was a great visit and the food was very good..Awesome customer service, the line is long but they move those people through very quickly
2017-09-10,1,Holy cannoli! My Hobobro warned me against stepping into Carlow's (misspelling intentional), but I chose to learn the hard way and grabbed an eclair. It was definitely not love at first sight, as this abomination looked like a shrinky dink version of the legit pastry it shares a name with.  And, it certainly wasn't love at first (and last) bite. The dough was stale and had the mouth appeal of cardboard. The chocolate coating was flavorless. Sadly, that was the good news. The filling tasted like soap. This place is a disgrace to the proud tradition of Italian-American bakers who have risen earlier than their dough to create sweets from the heart for generations.  This soulless establishment--which charged $4.95 for this nastiness--is a stain on my beloved North Jersey dessertscape. Shame on Carlow's for stealing money and masquerading as a purveyor of authentic baked goods. Stick to your tv schtick, Buddy, 'cause you got no chops in the kitchen.
2017-09-10,5,Softest donut I've ever had. Presentation is A+ but service is very slow. The staff is super knowledgable about every single dessert.
2017-09-08,4,One of the best rolls which I have eaten, but still to expensive for just a great cream.One more star for design, nice decoration and old school building. My girlfriend recommended it to me, cause exactly in this bakery was filmed TV show. If you stay in NJ you must to try it.
2017-09-04,5,I was pleasantly surprised by how good the cupcakes were.  Dense and moist was the cakey portion and the icings were creamy and well-flavored be it chocolate, vanilla of hazelnut.  Loved them. A few months back we tried the location by Port Authority in NYC across the river and strongly disliked it.  I concluded that the lines were simply due to the hype.  I was so glad we tried this location.  I used to live in the area and remember this simple bakery before the fame and tourists.  Can't wait to go back.
2017-09-02,5,I am a fan of the show, and let me tell you, coming here I was not disappointed. The pastries were SO DELICIOUS! The customer service was excellent as well. The employees were fast when taking orders and were very kind. I even brought back a whole cake with me on a flight to California. The cake arrived perfectly and looked exactly like when I ordered it. Every pastry I tried at the bakery was exceptionally tasty. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Hoboken.
2017-08-30,1,1. Waiting almost 20 mins, not because too many people, is because the ordering method is not efficient, and the staff lacks of energy. Too Slow!!!2. lobster tail is small and hard to bite. The worst lobster tallies I've ever tried!!!
2017-08-26,2,Ive been getting pastries from here from before it became famous. Everything was so fresh and tasted amazing. Ever since Carlos has became mass produced the quantity went up but the quality went down. I was very disappointed and not as excited to buy pastries the way I use to. When i went after Carlos became popular the pastries tasted stale and not appetizing. Another downside is the prices are way to high; they measure by the pound. That makes no sense, except for cookies-but people keep going just because of the name and popularity. He geared towards being famous but failed those who were loyal before he became so big. The only good thing they have is the cake decorating which in my opinion is still pricey. So disappointed. Alot of my friends and family feel the same when ever the discussion comes up.
2017-08-20,4,I really enjoyed my stop into Carlo's Bakery! The staff was attentive and, although it was busy, the wait wasn't too long. Some delicious pastries I tried included the lobster tail, tiramasu, and moose! My favorite was the lobster tail, it was flaky, crunchy, and sweet.They do have limited seating though so plan for that. :)
2017-08-16,4,I was so excited to finally get to see this bakery! The line wasn't too long and it moved quickly. I ordered the hazelnut cupcake! It was heavenly! I also tried the chocolate cannoli, but I didn't like it as much as the cupcake. The cashier was friendly even though I bombarded her with questions about Cake Boss. I'm sure they get it all the time. They wrap the pastries in adorable tied up boxes.
2017-08-14,5,Totally worth the long line. I was in NJ and couldn't leave without stopping at the Cake Boss' bakery and I was not disappointed. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it.
2017-08-11,5,This place has the best cannoli's, and i've tried many cannoli's! :)I went around 1pm on a Tuesday and there were just a couple people there. You can watch the employees make the cakes and pastries; it's pretty cool. A little pricy though, but I guarantee you it's worth it.
2017-08-07,2,I've been here a few times for their lobster tails, which are delicious. But every time I go, the service is always at a snail's pace. The lines are usually long-ish due to the tourists who come to take photos of the bakery because of the show. BUT there's always 6+ people working so I don't understand why the service is so horrible. Let me tell you about the service today. I walked in the pouring rain to the shop to pick up some oreo lobster tails. Surprisingly, there weren't too many people in line. I ordered and happily walked back to enjoy some dessert. When I opened the box, they were NOT lobster tails but three containers holding I don't know what!! I called the shop. No answer. I started walking back reluctantly. Called the shop a few more times. NO ANSWER. Seriously??By the time I got to the shop, I was fuming but politely asked to speak to the supervisor. I asked why no one was answering the phone, but I don't remember what excuse she gave me. She looked at the order form, and said, "Oh, the person who put your order together must've thought "oreo tails" said "oreo towers"....ummm, OK.Also, they overcharged me $9, which the supervisor refunded at the shop. I understand, it was a mistake, but I'm surprised she didn't offer some type of compensation. I wouldn't be this annoyed usually, but the fact that they didn't answer the phone the multiple times I called was ridiculous. So the next time you guys want to Carlos, ask yourself first, "Is it really worth it?" Probably not.
2017-08-07,3,Went there yesterday placed order and went to register to pay. Quite expensive and as I was paying my name was called and a bag with boxed items handed to me. When I got home was missing cupcake that I ordered so I was very disappointed.  It is a very busy area and the way you are processed through is so impersonal, cannot even see items as you order. You give your order while in line so display case is only partially viewable. Your order is packed in area not visible and handed to you wrapped. Place can be organized better so your order is filled as you are in front of display. Felt like, we got your money now leave and when I got home missing an item it sure did not help. Items I did receive were good but expensive.
2017-08-01,2,Visiting family and thought we'd stop by and try the famous bakery. It was just OK! Nothing special. I've had better and I've had worse. I was disappointed that I had to purchase my favorite cookies in 1/2 pound boxes and not fresh in the cases. Again those were just ok too, nothing great. The cannoli filling was creamy but the shell wasn't crispy because it's in the case. Cupcakes weren't very tasty at all. Those were the most disappointing, I mean it is a cake store. So overall I went and had the experience but I'd never go back.
2017-08-01,3,The service was fast and friendly but I would pass on the over priced cheesecake ($7.00) the texture was lumpy and the flavor was bland......
2017-08-01,2,Not worth it. Overly sweet desserts. The chocolate covered strawberry was fresh. Could have missed it.
2017-08-01,3,I had a lot of expectations for this place and they say it was soooo good but I was quite disappointed. The cupcakes were good but not the best. The cannolis were very hard, almost chip a tooth. Be careful eating them. Maybe it was just my luck but I don't think I'd spend another $100+ there.
2017-07-27,2,Went there yesterday because my mom wanted to see the famous bakery she saw on TV, and so we decided to try some of their pastries. The bakery was busy around 4 pm but there were employees placing orders while people was standing on queue. Everything looked very very nice, so we were very excited to taste them. We took 3 lobster tail, 1 with hazelnut 2 with custard, 1 napoleon, 1 eclair with chocolate and 1 with strawberry and cream, and 1 cannoloVery very very very disappointed. Everything was extremely sweet, way too sweet. The traditional cannolo must be made using fresh ricotta adding sugar and sometimes chocolate chips. That cannolo tasted like a milky sugary cream, def not like a lightly sweet ricotta. Even my mom wondered how they can make pastries like that considering they have a strong italian background. We were very disappointed. Pretty pricey and not worth it. Basic creams, not balanced flavors, and I think lots of them are prepared using pre made and large commercial ingredients. Maybe we have high standards when it comes to food because we were born and raised in Italy, but we would have happily saved 40$.
2017-07-24,5,Visiting from Utah. This was on the top of our list as a must see. We took the bus from NYC to Hoboken just to see this bakery. It didn't disappoint. Didn't see Buddy or his family....but still excited to buy some sweets.
2017-07-23,4,Employees were extremely nice. They had an order taking process that seemed to help the line move along quickly, while also giving customers a one on one experience with an employee to explain what each item was. Everything that I tried was delicious!!!! My complaint is that the building is tiny. There were 3 small tables inside with 3 chairs to a table. There was no restroom. No tables or trash cans outside. Also, it's not stroller/wheelchair friendly. I would definitely go back despite the challenges though. It was really good! You can watch some of the staff making different products. Oh, and parking was a nightmare.
2017-07-23,1,Overpriced pastries for their fans and tourists that look better than they taste. Liked (but not loved) their original Hoboken location years back but with their success judging by this location, the quality of their products have gone downhill.
2017-07-22,4,Bought eclairs, lobster tails, chocolate mouse & a canoli. The lobster tails were the only impressive thing.
2017-07-17,5,I am giving it 5 stars, because they have awesome baked good.Just need to express that I am a little disappointed that after 2 years of not having their famous crumb cake due to a cake change. I was in NJ last week and my sister went to the Bakery in Red Bank, bought the crumb cake, I was very disappointed in the way it tasted and looked, would not buy it again.Buddy, please bring back the original it was awesome. Why mess with perfection.
