2021-11-07,5,Loved this place so much! All the appetizers looks so great we decided to start with the appetizer sampler to get a little taste of everything. You could tell everything was freshly made and not just pulled out of the freezer and deep fried. The mozzarella sticks had fresh mozzarella cheese inside, the wings were crispy and full of flavor, the fries were crunchy and perfectly salted. My favorite part of the appetizer sampler was the fried goat cheese balls - we should've gotten a full order of them. We also tried the hummus platter which was delicious, and the chicken cutlet sandwich (we split it in half so the photo is only half of the sandwich). Overall this place was amazing and I will definitely be back soon. We even got to talk to the owner, Mario, who was super friendly and loved helping out customers. He also owns the pizza place diagonally across the street from 10th & Willow which I have tried in the past and is also out of this world good!!
2021-11-01,1,Terrible wings. Was recommended to go here and get wings. I got them and they are watery and mushy  I called to ask why they were like this and the girl says oh that's how they are. I should have orders them extra crispy because most people complain about that.  Soooo why not reccomend that when I ordered.  Girl didn't even let me finish talking before saying that's how we do it and hangs up. Spent 52 on 3 orders of watery wings   What a waste of money
2021-07-07,4,Standard looking American bar on the inside with tv's for sports viewing. High top tables with a bar and some outdoor seating outside from Covid times. Didn't order any food so can't speak to that. Heard the night life gets crazy on the weekends but never been aside from evening dinner time.
2021-06-14,5,How this place doesn't get a 5 star rating from every patron who walks through the door is a mystery to me! I come here a lot....we're talking dates, friends, watching the game, post marathon, girls night, family visits, randomly by myself when low on groceries...never had a bad meal- like ever. It is hands down the best bar food in hoboken. Awesome wings, sandwiches, and if you want to be good- tasty salads!
2021-05-02,3,Nothing special - would really give 2.5 stars if I could. We asked to be seated outside which is honestly the only thing I really enjoyed. The outdoor space/ambiance is really nice (despite that the view was of a bunch of trash cans outside the restaurant). I ordered the Mexicali burger. The service was very slow. It took quite a while to get our food. I asked for a side upon ordering that wasn't brought out with the dish - totally fine it happens - but I had to ask twice for it after getting the meal. Our waiter only came to check on the table once and we really weren't enjoying our time so we just decided to eat quick so we can leave. It also took a long time for someone to come around so we can get the check. This is not in anyone's control but the people we were surrounded by wait it really hard to have a peaceful lunch on a nice day out. Parents had iPads with the sound on very loud, kids screaming and running around - it was hectic. Also, they allowed a table for 2 to be turned into a table for 4 and it wasn't social distanced properly which was very irritating. Definitely not impressed.
2021-03-18,4,Great drinks, better than average bar food, pretty lackluster service.Came here on st. Patrick's day, and they looked pretty understaffed so I understood why they were so slow. But it took them like 20 minutes to even get our drink order so that was a little annoying, we had to walk inside and get somebody. But they definitely were more attentive the remainder of the night and even noticed our table was unbalanced and stuffed cardboard underneath to keep it balanced.We pretty much ordered the most basic bar food you could think of. The wings, we had all four of their flavors which I thought were some of the better wings I had in hoboken so far. The artichoke dip was a surprise, one of the better I have tasted, they added a bunch of cheese and had lotta fresh artichoke bits in it. The chicken cheesesteak was better than average, the bread quality was really good too!All in all I think this place is good, and definitely would come back here again for its consistency, and the food was better quality than I expected. My only complaint was the service and the prices were pretty steep for bar food.
2021-03-07,1,The worst place in terms of service.. I swear the waiters and bartenders think they own the place, like chill ... Calm the eff down... selective service, attitude, priority to 'certain' people w a tinge of racism !!  Some of the bouncers aren't too bad but folks inside seriously need an attitude and reality check in terms of what their profession is and probably wouldn't hurt their personal life either but hey that's none of my business!!!
2021-02-27,1,If you wish to get harassed by the bouncer this is the place to be. The bouncers definitely has an authority complex at this place. My girlfriend and I came here before, we didn't have a goodtime due to impersonal staff so my friend and I decided to come here with a friend. The bouncer had a problem with us standing up and talking without our masks and kept on curisng at me. If you wish to get harassed by the bouncer this is the place to go.
2021-02-27,2,Not really worth the price here. Mediocre food that is more expensive than expected for what it is.
2021-02-14,1,Decided to give this place one more shot, Bc I guess in hindsight the thanksgiving wrap wasn't the best choice.. so I decided to go with old faithful - the bacon cheeseburger. Tough to mess that up.. somehow they did. Asked for a Bacon cheeseburger. Got a bacon burger no cheese.. I never send things back but a bacon burger with no cheese is just not enjoyable. So I had no choice but to send it back. So at this point, I was reminded why I hated ordering food here, but decided to push those negative thoughts away, and give it a solid shot. And low and behold, it was the worst bacon cheeseburger I've had in a while, easily the worst in Hoboken. I guess I should've taken my own advice in my first post; don't eat here, just get drinks here. TLDR; good music, good beers, atrocious food. Don't come here to eat
2019-11-04,5,My Hoboken go to. Staff is attentive and make you feel like you're at home. Food is always hot and delicious.
2019-10-30,5,A burger with goat cheese on an English muffin keeps me coming back.And they serve the tequila I like.And they treat me like a person; which unfortunately, is rare.
2019-10-18,1,I rarely write negative reviews, but last night's visit warrants one.I arrived around 8:30pm with a good friend of mine. I got a martini from the main bar and walked to the center of the bar to watch the the baseball game on TV.  At this time, my friend had already noted that a "rude employee" walked by him and forcibly pushed him to get through. Because my martini glass was cold, I approached two people sitting down at the table behind us. They were seated at a 4-top table (2 tables pushed together). I politely asked them if they would mind if I rested my martini glass on the edge of their table not being used. They said that it would not be a problem at all. I thanked them.Not more than a few minutes later, the "rude employee", whose name we later found out to be URBANO (waiter with pony tail) told me that I must take the glass off the table. I asked why and he said because the two seated customers asked me to do so. When Urbano walked away, I politely approached the 2 people and asked them what had happened. They firmly denied what Urbano had suggested. Minutes later, Urbano came back, picked up the martini glass, and physically forced me to hold the glass, which had now also spilled on my shirt and jacket.  He then called the bouncer over. I calmly explained what had happened and said that the people seated at the table had no problem at all with my glass on the empty table. Urbano replied, "I don't care what they said, I'm telling you to hold the glass because I said so". My friend and I were absolutely shocked at this inexcusable behavior and told them that this is no way to treat a paying customer. We were very polite during this whole episode. About 5 minutes after that, a different patron approached us and said, "I saw what happened over there... this has happened to me too... don't f**k with that guy as he's the owner's brother".  I thanked him for the information that was both meaningless and and threatening, and said that being related to the owner is even more of a reason to treat customers with respect and decency. I have been living in Hoboken for 15 years and never experienced anything quite like this. Shame on 10th and Willow and their bullying employees!!
2019-10-05,5,5/5 still my favorite burger in Hoboken.  Do not sleep on this folks. The quality of the meat is always phenomenal and it's still fresh and hot even when I get take out! Highly recommend Willow Ave, cooked MR.
2019-09-29,5,Great place! The outside area is perfect for dining alfresco. Food is consistently good, Urbano makes you feel welcome and like family. Wings are worth the trip.
2019-09-16,1,Want great customer service and to be treated with respect? Then look somewhere else.
2019-09-07,1,Just want to preface this review; I am a regular at 10th & Willow (live 30 second walk away) and have always enjoyed it, but I will NEVER be returning. Also, this is the first time I've ever felt the need to write a Yelp.My girlfriend and I showed up around 6:15 and ordered a medium rare burger and chicken cheesesteak... as simple and quick of an order as you can get. After 25-30 minutes (and zero communication from the waiter- URBANO), I walked inside to ask the waiter how much longer, to which he responded that he'd follow up and that they were busy (they were not busy, over half the tables were empty). I've always been friendly with this waiter (literally talked to him that morning outside), so I didn't get frustrated and let it go. Fortunately the food came out five minutes later, but unfortunately her burger was super raw. I sent it back and again didn't get frustrated. Obviously one would assume that you'd prioritize that order and have it out within 10 minutes, which was not the case.15-20 minutes later (again zero communication from the waiter), I go inside to ask him to cancel it because my girlfriend needs to head to the hospital for work. AGAIN I was relatively patient and let it go, even though my girlfriend was about to work a 12 hour overnight shift with nothing to eat prior. No patient deserves the hangry hurricane about to storm into that ICU.Because this waiter has always been a friend of mine, I still gave him a 20+% tip, but made sure to let him know it was unacceptable service. He responds with, "what do you want me to do!?". I say, "I need you to follow up with me- I'm frustrated I had to go inside multiple times to ask the status of my order.". If he had responded that he was honestly sorry and took full responsibility (instead of blaming the cooks), I would have 100% let it go.INSTEAD, he responds by condescendingly throwing the money I paid at me and saying, "here's your follow up!". He then barges off into the restaurant. And to make this situation even more ridiculous, this happened IN FRONT OF THE OWNER, who responds, "what do you want me to do?" and "it's not his fault; its the cooks". Its not the cook's job to communicate with the table. I've worked at a number of restaurants when I was younger and would have been FIRED ON THE SPOT for talking to a customer like that. Ridiculous; they lost a regular customer.
2019-09-04,5,This is my fav place to have a drink and eat! Food is amazing but most importantly so is the staff! Love Urbano and all the other friendly employees. HIGHLY recommend coming here any night of the week
2019-08-30,4,Just wondering around for a nightcap. Bartender was super cool and knew such fun random stuff... Clientele was great company.I didnt feel like I was a bother to stop in so late - perfect thank you!
2019-08-23,5,This place is amazing, the staff the owner, the food! Amazing neighborhood hangout and place to grab dinner, the weekly specials are the best if you have kids (half off appetizers, Monday and Wednesday half off entrees! There are more I just can't remember them right now), so you can have dinner and drinks without breaking the bank!
2019-06-01,1,I have eaten here several times over several years. The food is fine pub fare. Nothing special but not bad either. Their selection of beers is mediocre and never rotated  - so if you like interesting beers you're out of luck. Also, wash up before going, as the bathroom (men's anyway) is filthy, and on more than one occassion the sink was clogged. Ordinarily, a place like this wouldn't register as review-worthy, but my wife and I just had an experience that makes it necessary. We went in looking for an early dinner (before 7:00) at an outdoor table - the interior is extremely loud and hard to talk in. The owner/manager said there were no tables available, though there were two unoccupied four-top tables, and two people dining at another four-top. When asked if we could sit at one of those, and pointed the twosome at the other four top, he suddenly and inexplicably became enraged and literally chased us out of the restaurant. As we exchanged words outside, he told us to 'never come back here.' Dont worry, sir, we won't.
2019-05-25,1,Awful experience for Leprechaun, won't be going back. Staff was so incredibly rude. Will not  be going back, wouldn't recommend for any occasion.
2019-05-23,4,Great Mexicali burger with fries and beers on tap.  Grab a spot outside and enjoy the sunlight while lunching.
2019-04-28,1,Avoid this bar at all costs.  I was bulldozed out of the bar because I was accused of throwing napkins! Instead of asking me to leave I was bear hugged and pushed through a packed bar.  I was not even asked to leave!  What a joke. Unprofessional is an understatement.  Your bouncer's actions could've have injured one of your customers/myself by physically pushing me through a crowd of people.
2019-04-27,1,This place is atrocious. I couldn't believe the way the employees acted to a group in front of us in line. A guy who seemed to not be causing any issues was lifted off the ground by a bouncer and in this act the bouncer knocked over 2 women (including my mother). The bouncer didn't apologize at all and is clearly just a power hungry young kid who feels important because he checks IDs. Hope this place saw his actions and got rid of him, nonetheless I have been telling all my friends and colleagues to avoid this place at all costs.
2019-04-06,1,This bar/restaurant is awful. Their employees don't respect their customers and they they think they own the world because they work at this bar. I'll never return and I encourage anyone thinking of going to this bar to reconsider because they treat their patrons like second class citizens
2019-03-31,5,10th and Willow has the best wings in Hoboken. So crispy! Also service is always great. One of my favorite spots.
2019-03-17,1,Just watched a bouncer spear tackle Phil Murphy's nephew. Terrible look for the business and also for the state of New Jersey. It's a shame a couple people can't get a couple cocktails and a Shepard's Pie around Hoboken these days.
2019-03-17,1,Was just in line there and the guy in front of me wasn't being let in. I watched the bouncer charge at him and in the process my friend and I were pushed to the ground. My girl has a twisted ankle. I've never seen anything like it. Can't really rate the bar, but considering we were injured waiting to get in, I'll never go back and will urge all my friends to avoid at all costs.
2019-03-03,1,My friends and I went to 10th & Willow at around 3pm on 3/2 (and are regular customers there.) I had been upset about some personal things going on in my life that I wanted to open up to my friends about, so we went inside, grabbed a table, and planned to order food. An incredibly rude worker came over to our table and said that I shouldn't be in the establishment if I was upset. Confused, and shocked, my friend went over to speak to an employee and explain to him that I was crying because I was speaking to my friends about personal matters, but that it was not at all  one of those "drunk girl at the bar being hysterical" situations. To our dismay, his response was "who cares, my mom passed away and you don't see me crying, she shouldn't be here if she's not in a good mood"... etc.After we paid for our overpriced $19 salads, I left feeling extremely baffled and shocked. I've never heard of a place attempting to kick out someone because they're sad. Even more so, I can't believe a staff member would be so insensitive, judgmental, and a flat out horrible human being. Safe to say we will absolutely never attend 10th and Willow ever again, and I hope they fire the disgusting humans that don't know what it means to be decent.
2019-02-16,1,Not clear why anyone would eat here. May be good for drinks and late night romps but the food is below edible standards. The dishes are filthy. The place smells. The service is courteous but slow. Threw away the leftovers. Won't be back.
2019-02-13,4,Walked up to the establishment around 630 on a Friday night was greeted by three large bouncers who very cordially he asked us if we are here for dinner. We said yes they showed us in and we were seated right away. The place was pretty busy there were a lot of TVs Yankee playoff game was on.Our waiter came over and gave us some suggestions on beer and food ,food was excellent service was excellent about 8 o'clock they moved all the tables to the wall because the crowd got very young and we got very oldGreat place
2019-01-31,1,Had been here multiple times and it had been fine, but will not be going back. Upon entering on a Thursday night for dinner, my girlfriend and I were asked for IDs. Having been here a few times, this was no big deal. But while pulling our IDs out, we were immediately accosted by a worker there for standing in the doorway. We tried to explain to this person we were just trying to get our IDs out, but he escalated it and was extremely rude to us. While trying to reason with him, we were told to leave, and the man said he was the owner. I have never, ever been treated like this when just trying to grab dinner anywhere, and also can't believe someone who is apparently an owner of a place would act like this. The food is just OK. We had only been here because it was convenient, but definitely won't be coming back after such horrible treatment while just trying to get a bite to eat early on a weeknight.
2019-01-23,1,When we first moved to Hoboken two years ago from Manhattan, we thought 10th and Willow would be a go to spot.  However, after several visits we realized the food was typically blah and much more expensive compared to better casual bar food in the area.  The last time we went was definitely the last straw.  It was only 8:15 and a waiter with a ponytail, who has waited on us almost every time I've ever been here, was extremely rude and degrading yelling and raising his voice to several girls in my party.  I'll never visit this restaurant again not only for the rude, disrespectful employees but mediocre at best food.
2019-01-12,1,Just watched the most disgusting group of bouncers & waiters accost a table of women in this bar. Embarrassing group of staff, there's no room for men to yell at women in 2019. Advise patrons to stay away.
2019-01-12,1,The way the male employees talk to women at this establishment is utterly disgusting. I would never advise another woman to go here.
2019-01-08,5,4 words. Fried goat cheese balls - they were so delicious and come with a great dipping sauce. I love this places night scene, they have specials every night and a great dj. There is always a reason to go to 10th and willows
2018-12-18,3,I came here with some friends who live local and were promptly stopped by the bouncer at 7:30 PM who yelled "ID'S LADIES" . I guess it's a Hoboken thing to require an ID even just walking into a restaurant but we obliged. Just not a super warm welcome.We got sat in the back corner and promptly ordered drinks. Our waiter was pretty good at recommending certain things so we went with an Aeperol Spritz, a moscow mule, and a cucumber martini. The cucumber martini was pretty tiny, maybe about 2 big sips. Foodwise, we started with the baked brie which is BOMB literally would come here daily just for this. For our mains we got the buffalo chicken wrap and two of the chicken cutlet sandwiches. I liked my chicken cutlet sandwich but wouldn't say it was anything completely out of this world. The buffalo chicken wrap was supposedly really hot.Service wise, while our server was really personable, after we got our food he disappeared for 30 minutes. We saw our bus boys more than we saw him so we were at dinner for close to 2 hours.
2018-12-16,2,I get that not every spot you go to, is going to be THE spot. That's the perfect world. But every once in awhile, you walk into a place and you just wonder how the hell this place is still in business. If you go on Vibe alone, then this is a fine spot; young crowd, fun music, but if you care about drink value, quality and location, this place is horrible. $13 drinks that were extremely watered down. Any casual drinker can tell you what two or three drinks feels like in their system. I had top shelf liquor, Kettle and soda, and it did nothing for me which is very unusual. So it was either a light pour or water down drinks. I was a bartender for 20 years,  it def happens. I was there with a party and EVERY person had the same complaint, which is rare so we switched to beer. Thank God for beer because you can't water that down. Parking is horrible and could delay your night by at least 30 minutes. the bathrooms are very tiny and you get bump with the door whenever you wash your hands. Overall not worth the hassle, e g parking, price of drinks and service, however bartender was nice. But you can always interpret that as, smile to your face while I rob you.  The DJ was good though
2018-11-12,5,Great food, great wings, great drinks. Sometimes the service is on the slower side however it is worth the wait. Great bar to go to at night as well, gets crowded and is always a fun time.
2018-01-04,5,Our server Urbano has been consistently amazing, friendly and upbeat. Every time he suggests any food, it is delicious! We have been here 4 times and will be coming back for sure!
2017-12-15,1,I was here for my friends engagement. Anytime we put our drinks down - we were reprimanded for putting our drinks on a 'reserved' table. As the night went on - no one showed up. The second I sit down at the table .. the bouncer moves the tables. Really? What a classy place. I won't be returning.
2017-11-28,4,I have been here twice and both times we had the same server whose name I believe to be Urbano S.  He is great.  Nothing is ever a problem for him.  Both times large parties (6, and maybe 12 or more).The food is just Ok though.  I have had salads and burgers and nothing great to say about either. Nothing bad, just pretty neutral.  Food's a 3.  Urbano S. is a 5.  The place is an overall 4.  Especially good for large groups as they are very accommodating.
2017-11-15,5,I LOVE 10TH & WILLOW. My friends and I actually look forward to Mondays now that we come here... Monday is wing night - unlimited wings for $12. We also love Thursday martinis! This place has such a fun and inviting atmosphere - the staff is amazing and truly treats you like family (special shout out to Hector for being the man lol)! The service, food, & drinks are all fantastic. The perfect local bar - I will continue coming here until the end of time.
2017-10-07,2,Came here to watch a game with friends. We get yelled at like 3rd graders for no reason. They wonder why there are 5 customers in what used to be a happening bar 5 years ago? If you hired nice people maybe people would come back.
2017-10-07,2,Probably the worst brunch Ive had in awhile. I don't mind paying for quality food but this place is way too over priced. Not worth it
2017-10-04,1,Used to love this place but over the past year or two in steady decline. We own a condo around the corner so it used to be a common stop.Last night went in with four of us asked for an apple martini not sweet and another asked for a regular. They were made together came up sweet and almost warm. Complaint was met with indifference and not adjusted. Left the drink and this place left me.
2017-09-10,5,Perfect outdoor seating. Great food selection. Our waiter was an absolute riot- we loved him!! Good food and drinks. A+
2017-07-26,5,Thursday nights are made for Martinis! Ray's Hot & Dirty Martini with Blue Cheese Olives is the absolute best. This is a true neighborhood bar with quality drinks and inviting staff. A great place, crowd and always a good time.
2017-06-06,4,I just love this place. I can only attest to coming here on Monday nights for their famous wing nights. You pay 10 dollars at the door (you must be 21 years old) and you have access to unlimited wings (buffalo, BBQ, teriyaki) with an additional purchase of any two beverages. I've been coming here with my significant other for years now and they treat us like family. Whenever we get the chance we always try to invite friends , so they can discover and try out this gem. The only downside is it's Hoboken and parking is an absolute nightmare. Other than that I recommend and would definitely go check them out.
2017-04-28,5,Love this restaurant! Always amazing food and service. Really good atmosphere for groups.
2017-04-17,3,Finally checked this out on half priced entree night as had issue with trying out a bar where entrees cost 32.  I have been to Michelin star places that charged less.The bar is like every other though bigger than it looks as has two rooms that go down 10th st. No one was in those rooms on that night. The bar was consistently full.  The bartender was very nice and actually talks to customers so he gets 5 stars.Got the salmon which was good and well worth 16 paid but would question paying 32 for it.  This is not a bar with 20 beers but they have a beer in every category.A solid neighborhood bar and if take advantage of nightly specials a good value. Just know that on half priced app night need to eat all the app as they will not pack any to go.
2017-04-12,4,This place leaves a lot to be desired, but in comparison to other Hoboken haunts, it does a fine job. Saving grace: Monday nights.*Inflation, right? Unfortunately, for those of us who remember the good ol' pre-2016 years, the all-you-can-eat wing deal on Mondays has been bumped up from $5 to $10; however, they've included a new flavor: Thai Chili (I think), but it doesn't matter, as the sole reason these wings are worth it is due to this bar's shining star--teriyaki! Also, this place offers $2 Coors Lights which is amazing. Coors Light is one of the best beers in the country, and that I can drink inexpensive pints of it so near my home is a godsend. When I am old, decrepit, and in the throes of hospice, I want this beer to be dripped into my bloodstream via IV. In fact, I wouldn't mind if those teriyaki wings were mashed into a liquid pulp and also dripped into my bloodstream.Servers and bartenders are friendly. Urbano is COOL and nice. Bouncers are chill, too. They always recognize me and we exchange fist bumps in passing--even if I am not going into the restaurant, but merely passing through the neighborhood. Their commitment to recognizing me is what some would call "going above and beyond," but I consider it mere congeniality, a palpable warmth.Weekends nights between September and April, this place turns up. The music isn't that interesting, but neither are the clientele who frequent this place, so what can you expect? That said, everybody is very handsome and beautiful, and by proximity to such beautiful people, I feel beautiful as well. And that makes up for the lack of musical variety.
2017-03-25,1,We spent 2 hours buying food and drinking only to be forcibly kicked out by neanderthal bouncers. Literally took the beer out of my hand and forced me to leave. Food sucks. The staff are only worried about making space for the party crowd. Never been more put off by a business. Go to Jersey City instead.
2017-03-20,5,So many TVs and back rooms that you can reserve for private events! Their spinach dip is also one of my favorites in Hoboken!
2017-02-02,5,My favorite bar in Hoboken and food is great!!!  All thru the week different specials and Thursday's always a nice crowd.  Definitely a place to drink and eat any time of the week!
2017-01-26,4,I do owe this place an update after my past few visits.  I've gone on weeknights for dinner and had much better experiences.  My boyfriend claims that the buffalo chicken wrap is the best in Hoboken (which I can't argue minus the fact that it has blue cheese in it).  The Thanksgiving turkey wrap is another go-to of mine.  I still try to avoid coming here on weekends as it gets too jam packed but definitely enjoyable when its less crowded during the week for dinner.
2017-01-25,5,I came here last Saturday night and it was a great experience! We made a reservation for 8:15 but probably was unnecessary because here were tables available. The place is super cute with great ambiance and the hosts/ bouncers were very friendly and accommodating. They let us pick where we wanted to sit with options for the back or the front. Our waiter was great and very attentive. We ordered old fashioneds and martinis they were delicious and delivered fast. I got the bistro salad, it was very good and my friend got one of the burgers and it was huge - very good as well. The crowd was causal and young people. I recommend it and will definitely be back here!
2017-01-02,1,I've been to 10th and willow quite a few times and each time the experience is weird/uncomfortable and I tell myself every time that I'll never be back. The only reason I've gone back a few times is the fact that it's close to home and convenient. The food is OK, standard bar food/burgers and breakfast is served till 4PM. However, they have a full bar yet still give you soda cans instead of fountain soda - weird. Also, I've received my fair share of skunked beers over the years. Despite all this, the real problem is the horrible service and my last experience was the final straw.Right when we walked in to eat lunch, we were badgered by a waiter AND the owner to provide our ID's (mind you, I'm in my later twenties) including my senior citizen parents and rest of family that are well over 21....at 2 PM in the afternoon on a Monday. What restaurant does this?! It was very inappropriate, shady and frankly a turn off. Once we sat down, we ordered soft drinks and beer and they came back with the wrong drinks quite a few times (even the owner!) I also ordered an orange juice and after waiting more than 20 minutes, the waiter said they ran out. How do you run out of orange juice? There have been other times in the past where they have also ran out of food. After 45 minutes, the waiter finally took our order (after finding him in the restaurant) and rarely came back to ask if we needed refills on our drinks/water or to update us on the status of our meal. They also put someone else's appetizers on our table which only made us even hungrier. Just rude. After waiting an HOUR, a BUS BOY updated us that the food would be right out. After waiting an additional 25 minutes for our food (thinking it would be out any minute), we had to ask another waiter for an update and he said it should be right out. Of course 30 seconds later, our food came out except it was not hot at all and appeared to have been sitting there. The food wasn't even that good - overly burnt toast, warm fruit, soggy and cold fries, subpar burger and burrito that was sloppily wrapped. My dad literally eats anything in front of him and he ate half of his meal. Our ACTUAL waiter finally made an appearance 20 minutes later asking if we needed anything and insincerely apologized for the delay. It was awkward and even more frustrating since they didn't bother to apologize BEFORE we got our food. The restaurant wasn't even crowded. The least they could have done was apologize earlier on or give us an appetizer on the house due to the long wait. The icing on the cake was the food being cold and that we had a total of 4 homefries on our plate and a pic to prove it. Not only this, every time we needed something (refills, update on food, salt and pepper, ketchup, THE CHECK), we had to go up and find the waiter because they were so unattentive. Whats also strange is how we had at least 3-4 waiters this entire time including the owner - it appeared super disorganized and unprofessional. Also, we didn't even know they were waiters since a couple of them were in sweatpants. Bottom line is that we were all super disappointed and in disbelief that service could be that terrible. Honestly we are not the type of family to care much but it's hard to let this one go. The amusing part is the OWNER provided equally bad service so obviously the staff does not have good training. The only thing the restaurant has going for them is the great location in uptown Hoboken. The restaurant atmosphere is nice but definitely not enough to make up for the horrible service and shady AF business. It's safe to say that I will NEVER be back to 10th and Willow.
2016-12-14,2,We came in at 4:30 on a Wednesday. It was "half off entrees" and I hadn't eaten lunch, so I asked to see a menu. Two stars because the "specials" deal appears to be some kind of trap, or else the management is trying to destroy their bar/restaurant with totally unreasonable pricing. There are no "entrees" on the menu, so the waitress told me about 4 entrees that were the special. I ordered the stuffed rigatoni with sausage tomato sauce. As you can see in the photo, it was nice looking, but definitely not an entree size. The flavor was good, but the portions and price didn't match. I asked when the bill came: $14 for such a small pasta dish?! This would have been $28 not on special? The bartender shrugged and said he didn't know, he wasn't the manager.Definitely put me off. This place has gone downhill. Better to walk a few more blocks and go to any of the other fine bar/restaurants in the area.
2016-12-03,1,First Yelp post ever.  I have been supporting this place for years (since 1998 to be exact).  Just took my friend and our kids there at 4pm today to watch some football and let the kids eat some apps.  There were 6 people in the entire place and the bouncer asked us to leave at 5pm b/c the kids (4 of them 2-6 yrs old) were too rowdy.  Ushered out by a bouncer.  Pathetic. RIP 10th and Willow.
2016-11-19,2,Has gone way down hill.  Used to be our favorite but the quality is down.  Creepy guys who work there and stand at the door all night and stare at the women customers.  They don't participate in any online ordering they make you use their delivery which is always at least hour and 15 mins.  The food quality is a 3.5 the service is a 1.  SUBSCRIBE TO SEAMLESS!
2016-11-13,1,My visit to 10th and Willow can be summed up in two words: EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA
2016-10-26,1,I've been to 10th and Willow at least 50 times and each time, I hope it's going to get better, but it seems to be getting worse! I work and used to live around the corner so I had gone there for convenience purposes. I arrived with a group of 5 for happy hour and the place was absolutely empty! We were told that we couldn't sit near the window where there was more room so all 5 of us had to sit at a smaller table. We were told that happy hour drink specials were only available at the bar. Normally, that would have been understandable, but again, there was absolutely no one there. We ended up moving to the bar because we planned to have several rounds of drinks. I ordered a Mediterranean salad with chicken and received a Caesar salad. I was starving and annoyed so I ate it. When the bill came, I saw that it was $17.00!!!! It was just okay, but no salad should cost that much. I looked back at the menu to verify the price and the base price of the salad was written in like .6 font while the other words were at 12. Granted I should have read it more carefully but who would think some lettuce and 4 small tomatoes would cost more than a cheeseburger and fries?! My friend ordered guacamole and chips, and they were out of avocados, really? My other friend tried to order a veggie burger, but received a hamburger instead. The moral of the story is with 500 other places to eat in Hoboken, 10th and Willow should be the last place to go!
2016-10-04,1,This is the worst managed bar with terrible customer service and shady business practices. Left my card at the bar and the waiter combined tabs once we got to table just to steal tips from the bartenders. Because of the confusion I was overcharged on the tab.  When I tried to explain to the owner what had happened, he was incredibly rude and accused me of walking out even though they had already swiped my card. Moral of the story: bring cash, go over your bill in detail, and never trust this establishment with a credit card. Wings were meh.
2016-10-03,1,Trying to give this place a second chance, first mistake: when I ask for a Coors Lite and you have bottles and draft, give me a choice, Second: it's 5pm and you're asking a 50 year old for his card and DRIVERS  licence and credit card; bar staff too busy chatting about their ever so exciting personal lives to worry about serving; Owner should spend less time in the gym and some time in the charm school!
2016-09-14,5,Amazing always go after work drinks be popping and food there wings are soooo goodddddd
2016-08-20,3,Used to go here all the time and always had a positive experience but lately I feel it's gone down hill. They have good specials nights: Wing night on Mondays is good and Tuesday has half priced apps. The last 3 times I've been here the food was terrible and the portions actually shrunk, especially on apps night. I got a burger and it was completely tasteless and the bun was so dry. Wish I could give this a better rating but the quality has suffered lately.
2016-08-08,1,This is actually a 0 star review. Went in for their promoted AYCE on Monday and after I was IDed at the door by 2 African American men they asked me if I was there for wings. When I notified them I was, they happened to at that instant no longer allow people in with sweat pants. I asked if I was to have dinner and not wings if that would change the situation and they said that was "the loophole". However, sports teams that come in sweaty in their gear are welcome. I was blatantly discriminated, will never return and will definitely spread this word.
2016-07-31,1,I give only one star for the outside seating other then that the food was terrible and the waitress was no where to be found .  The burger dry the bun was like a cracker French fries tasted like they found them at the bottom of the McDonald bag. I guess you get what you get at a bar grille more bar then grill
2016-07-21,4,Went to 10th and Willow last night for dinner because they had a 1/2 off entrees happy hour special on Wednesday nights. I highly recommend the pretzel encrusted chicken here. It is so good. My girlfriend got the buffalo chicken wrap and enjoyed it a lot. Service was very good too. My only complaint about this place is the price. My entree would have cost $32 if I came on any other night, however I only spent $16 because is was 1/2 off Wednesday. If you are coming here for an entree be prepared to spend. I hear they have happy hour wing night on Mondays. I plan on checking that out in the near future.
2016-07-07,4,Only came in for a drink late night, would need to go again to give a proper review.  But it had a good vibe, friendly bartenders, tvs, usual stuff.  Good to get a drink, nice crowd.
2016-07-01,5,Love this place - started going for happy hour during my last yr of residency and wish I had gone more often. The bartenders are sweethearts, as is the owner. The food is always delicious (both in house and for pick up). And the place has a fun, chill vibe - perfect for those random nights when you just want to have a couple drinks and relax
2016-05-26,4,10th and Willow is a cute spot if you're looking for cool cocktails without going to a noisy bar. I spent a couple hours here conversing with friends over wine and some the best sweet potatoes fries I've ever had. The server, Urbano, was super attentive and made me feel welcome on my first visit. I'd definitely come back if I was in the area!
2016-05-25,5,Whether I'm looking to have an intimate dinner or just drinks and conversation, this is one of my favorite stops in Hoboken. More then likely you'll be greeted at the door by Mario, the owner himself, always friendly and always welcoming. If you're lucky, you'll get Urbano as your waiter. Warm, witty, and attentive, he'll make sure you get the full "10th and Willow" experience. Now on to the good stuff... Some of my favorites are their Sweet Potato Fries, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, Sliders, and all their Salads especially the Cobb Salad. BUT one of the absolute best thing on their menu isn't even on the menu. The Mario Special-- breaded chicken cutlet fried and topped with prosciutto and melted mozzarella over pasta sautéed in olive oil and tons of fresh garlic. It tastes even more amazing than it sounds.  I really love the ambiance. The indoor setting is intimate, dimly lit. The outdoor seating is a must on warmer days. More low key on week nights and a great crowd and good music on weekends. The service and food never ceases to amaze me. A great option if youre looking to get away from the chaos of Washington.
2016-04-18,1,The service was extremely poor especially the rude waitress. It took over 10 minutes for someone to even come by our table and get us water which then had residue. We had all ordered burgers medium rare which came out completely well done. The bun was completely stale to the point where it crumbled. Our appetizer, thai chili calamari was the only appetizing part of our meal. Our drinks were either diluted or complete alcohol. It may have been an off day but I'm not willing to give this place another try with all of the other options in the area. Our bill was over $100 and I don't believe the service or meal was worth half of it. It's unfortunate because I live near by and definitely thought this place had potential from afar.
2016-04-04,4,If you're looking for a night of cheap wings and drinks, go to 10th and Willow on a Monday evening. Pay $5 at the door and buy two drinks minimum and you got yourself some unlimited wings. The teryaki wings are a personal favorite.In addition to wing night, they offer some delicious food. Some personal favorites are the Mediterranean Salad and the BBQ Burger. Prices are average for a bar in Hoboken.I also suggest ordering take-out for pick up. You will be notified by phone when your order is ready which makes things super convenient.
2016-03-19,5,We were very well served, great service, very nice environment. AMAZING food! I had the philly cheese steak sandwich and I can say it was the best Philly cheese I have ever had. Drinks were strong, delicious and I definitely recommend to anyone in the area.
2016-02-16,1,Horrible customer service, the waitress was extremely rude and the manager or should I say the bus boy they brought out was even worse. If you want to go to a place and be treated with respect this is not the place. We ordered the skirt stake and it had  such an awful smell, you couldn't even swallow it. And their drinks let me tell you they fill your glass halfway. I liked this place 4 years ago, idk what happened
2016-02-03,1,Went with my husband for a bite at so called happy hour on a Wed, greeted by hyper older guido man in a t-shirt with him saying ID's, place was completely empty, waitress greets us at our table with menus and says they have 1/2 price appetizers tonight, i asked if she was sure because the website says 1/2 entrees, she confirms its appetizers, we then order 3 appetizers, the guido man at the door turns out to be a fugazi manager/owner and proceeds to constantly berate the staff telling them where to stand and pretty much overzealously criticize everything they did, he also loudly kept practicing karate moves, just weird, we finish and ask for the bill, all of out appetizers were full price, I ask the waitress why, she said that it was entrees that were half price, I said did we not have convo at the beginning of the meal, she said no I said entrees, just horrible service, my husband was like let's pay and never come back.
2015-06-29,3,I stopped by on a Friday night ready to eat. If you want to eat outside, you must be seated early, as they clear the tables out at 10:55. We started with the calamari which left a lot to be desired. It was rubbery and over cooked. We both had a burger which we enjoyed. However -- the servers and bus boys came over to the table nearly every 5 minutes while we were trying to enjoy our meal asking if we were done and trying to remove plates. It was unsettling.
2015-06-17,4,Solid bar food and a decent brunch. The late night crowd is usually good -- nice mix of people and a balanced male/female ratio. Can feel slightly overpriced for what it is but still worth it, especially on specials nights.
2015-05-31,1,Diners beware!!!!  My gf and I who are long-time hoboken residents decided to go to this place for the first time since it was the only place on a Friday night without a wait for dinner.  The food was average at best but that's not the reason for this review.  I'd like to warn off any potential victims that may be subjected to what happened to me.  After paying for dinner with my pnc debit card, the waiter failed to give it back to me, but no big deal.  I realized while walking back home, went back and the server reached in his shirt pocket and handed me my card....or so i thought.  That night, I bought wine at A&P and went home with my gf.  The next day, I visited my parents after deciding we'd save some money by going on a family plan on Sprint.  I used my debit card to open up 3 cell phone contracts.  Finally, I took them both to lunch at zinburger in clifton (which was awesome by the way).Upon trying to pay the debit card was declined.  Having plenty of money, I handed them another credit card and examined the pnc card carefully.  It belonged to some poor girl!.  I spent the rest of that beautiful Saturday on the phone with PNC and back at Sprint undoing all the credit card fraud I committed unwittingly.  All in all, I spent over 6 hours fixing this mess. Plus, I felt compelled to cancel my card and get a new one.  After several attempts to call a manager and stopping in only to have the staff obviously lie to me telling me there was no manager on duty, I was surrounded by the employees and they were trying to get the debit card from me which I had already destroyed.  Why would they want the card?  Also, they wouldn't give me mine back.  Extremely suspicious.  Finally, after phone tag and repeated calls, I finally spoke to Mario, who claims to be a manager there.  He told me he cut up my card, declined to explain how two people's cards could get so screwed up, refused to explain why they wouldn't give me back MY card, and definitely didn't apologize, or try to rectify the problem in any way.  He was nasty and hung up on me.  At the very least, he could given me the 6 bucks to replace my card.  At the very least, the entire staff is incompetent, nasty, and rude.  I suspect that there was something more fishy going on, however.  I think they knew exactly what they were doing. Obviously I'll never go there again.
2015-05-31,5,Stopped in to try it out, just got drinks - good bourbon selection. Will definitely go back and stay longer. Fun atmosphere, bartenders were attentive and fun to watch.
2015-05-26,1,This restaurant is a joke. The General manager is a really huge B*tch. She has a horrible attitude and very unprofessional. I would suggest not wasting your time to go there. Food sucks it's dirty and gross
2015-05-12,3,10th and Willow is fine. I never leave saying WOW I need to get back there ASAP. But I do find myself going from time to time because they have a decent food/drink selection, are in a convenient location and have spacious dine-in area.   Do go there if:-You want to go out and get yo' drank on. The bar scene is really vibrant here and there are a ton of drink options to choose from. I'm partial to the mojito (shocking).-You are looking to satisfy a bar food craving. Wings, fries, pizza, dillas, mozz sticks- you name it. The bar food here is really good, and fairly inexpensive. Watch out for nightly specials like half off apps on Tuesdays and 5 dollar all you can eat wings on Mondays. The pizza deserves a special shout. Normally at bars the pizza is enough for one or two, but this is like a full sized pizzeria quality pie. You can easily split it amongst four- last time my friend and I shared we had a full half leftover. Don't go there if:-You are looking for a quiet meal. Yes, there is a back dining section behind the sports bar area but every time I come its always really dark and loud. Last time I was eating in the back area they sat down a table of obnoxious drunk people who would not stop yelling. It put a huge damper on the meal and none of the waitstaff said anything. -You are looking for a quality entree and want to go out for a nice dinner. They have some delicious options like pretzel coated chicken and shrimp scampi, but in my eyes, the prices are unreasonably high for a restaurant with a sports bar vibe. There is no reason that an entree should be in the 30-40 dollar range. If you are going to spend that kind of money on a seafood or Italian dish then you are way better off going to something with a more quality dine-in atmosphere like Zack Oak's, Anthony David's or Onieals. All and all I would still come here to grab some wings and beers with friends, but I will not come back here on a dinner date.
2015-05-09,5,The staff was very friendly and the mini muffins they serve on the table were sooooo fresh and good. My friends and I had a great time here for brunch. Its a good size if you have a larger group and family friendly as well.
2015-05-07,5,The Buffalo calamari is out of this world! The best I've ever had - it keeps me coming back all the time. I've been here about 30 times for dinner and never once was disappointed with a dish. I also love the Thanksgiving Turkey Wrap, quesadilla and wings are fantastic!
2015-04-25,5,They serve the best wings and burgers in Hoboken. We went in for drinks and food on a lazy Sunday - service and food were both great. We ordered delivery for a Saturday night, and the food came quickly and was also very good. Would highly recommend.
2015-04-10,3,Nothing more annoying then going to meet a friend or my fiance for dinner and being greeted by a rude " bouncer' asking to check your id. Happens whether it is 12pm on a Sunday or 5pm on a Wednesday. Puts off such a cheap and cheesy vibe as soon as you enter. Food is good but staff and atmosphere could use some work.
2015-03-30,2,I've lived in Hoboken for over 5 years and had been coming to 10th and Willow long before that. I have always been satisfied with the okay service and sub-par quality until yesterday at brunch. My husband asked the server if it would be possible to order the french onion soup, as it was not on the brunch menu. We ordered the soup and an omelet with two ingredients. It took over 30 minutes. Then, when we finally get the check at the end of the meal, the soup is $12!!!! We couldn't believe our eyes and even asked the sever if there was a mistake. Nope. Just another Hoboken dive thinking they're some swanky NYC restaurant.
2015-03-20,2,This place has gone very far downhill from when I first started going here in 2006. My friends and I used to be regulars but now can barely stomach the food. The service is really inconsistent at best. We recently had a server forget our appetizer order without an apology or any attempt to make it right. The two stars are for decent cocktails and specials. Don't bother coming here on a Friday or Saturday night. It's wall to wall 22 year old bridge and tunnel crowd and expect broken glasses and vomit.
2015-03-12,5,OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE!!  We had a reservation for another place in the area but after 10 minutes of being ignored at our table we left and walked over to 10th and Willow.  I am so glad we did.  The ambiance, service and foood were exceptional.  It turned what would have been a miserable experience into a fantastic evening.  Thanks 10th and Willow we will be back often!!
2015-03-06,1,I've been to 10th & Willow several times, as its very close to my apartment. Cant believe I haven't  reviewed it yet but my most recent experience really egged me on to share my opinion. Overrated. Overpriced. Underwhelming. Uninviting. Disappointing. This sums up my thoughts in a nut shell. As soon as you walk in the door, no matter what time it is, you're greeted by a not so friendly bouncer who demands your ID. Ok, whatever, not a huge deal...but at least let me walk through the door first before grilling me. Seating is tight and this place always seems to be crowded. Their menu in my opinion is limited. On this particular occasion, I wasn't really feeling any of their entrees, so I thought I made a safe choice by ordering their buffalo chicken tenders. Boy was I wrong. Talk about bad chicken...I barely could cut it with a steak knife it was so tough. Also, I ordered my tenders with ranch instead of blue cheese and surprise, surprise, it came out with blue cheese. Not usually a big deal, as this is an easy fix...but it was impossible to track down the waitress to switch it for ranch. By the time she came over, I already realized the chicken was lousy and wasn't even interested in eating it anymore. On a different occasion I had come here for breakfast. I ordered an egg dish, which according to my recollection, wasn't good. The eggs were overcooked. And a similar situation, I had asked for ketchup and never got it. By the time I was able to track down someone to ask for it, my eggs were cold and my company was almost done with their meal. I keep coming back to 10th & Willow simply because its close and because I want to believe I could have a better experience....but its not happening. I get that you cant expect perfection when dining out and obviously mistakes happen but this place has never lived up to any type of expectation I have for a restaurant. Its expensive, the quality of food is very poor and the service really doesn't make up for the other departments that are lacking. With that being said, I will not return to 10th and Willow to give it another try. I've tried one too many times and there's plenty of other places in Hoboken that can live up to at least some of my expectations of what dining out should be like.
2015-03-03,4,There's nothing extra special about this bar, but I'm a fan.  I've only been here for food one, on a Monday night for their $5 all-you-can-eat wings (w/ 2 drink minimum purchase).  The wings were good and I'd go back again for that deal.  IOn the weekend, this bar can get pretty crowded, but the best part is it's generally more of a local bar, full of people who live in or around Hoboken.  Unlike many of the bars on Washington St, especially close to the PATH, it's not filled with people who live all over Northern NJ.   It does tend to be less crowded during the summer though, as does Hoboken in general.  So if you are looking for people, you may have to suck it up and head down to the bars by the PATH train.The drinks are typical Hoboken prices $4+ for a beer.  For a good crowd and a chance to get away from the visitors, definitely give this place a try.
2015-02-27,4,Happy to have found a new wing spot! Great service and great flavors. Took my kids for the first time this week and the waitress even learned their names for next Monday. Awesome time and great atmosphere.
2015-02-24,2,Only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the food is actually good. It would have been a 5 if it wasn't for them not letting me have dinner after the gym with my friends because I was wearing sweats. I've been there multiple times and never had a problem with the clothes I wear, and no where does it specify a dress code. I was even willing to go home and change but the host and the guard were being so rude and standoff ish that I felt I shouldn't spend my money there no recommend them to friends in the area. When a customer gives you repeat business and wasn't aware of a new rule that wasn't listed anywhere, you don't disrespect them and say "even if you were eating a filet mingion we wouldn't let you in"-host...Hope this reaches management because the food is amazing but if your staff is rude like that you're not going to get repeat business.Thanks.
2015-02-14,4,It's a little pricy but good service and good deals during happy hour. Liked the DJ and food was pretty good too. Good spot
2015-02-04,3,The name threw me. I kept asking my friend what bar we would be going to and she kept giving me the address or so I thought.  It was good for a Saturday night. Solid DJ and two bars that were quick to serve patrons. Tip theres a bit more room to move around in the back part of the bar. Definitely a place to go scout Hobokens talent if you're on the prowl. Also have a coat check which helps with the crowd control.
2015-01-17,1,I can't believe how crappy the food is here. Absolutely disgusting.  I think they water down the drinks too. What a joke. How has the health department passed them. I had an eggs Benedict and the eggs were still raw
2015-01-01,4,Loved everything but the parking! The crab cake was amazing!  The Caribbean wave martini was to die for.
2014-12-21,1,I've lived in Hoboken for a year now, and wanted to try somewhere new for Sat brunch. Upon entering my husband and I were barely greeted before the hostess asked for our ID's. I was certainly taken aback since I had come there, first and foremost, to EAT! My husband presented his ID, but I told the hostess I did not have mine on me - as I left my handbag at home. She shifted focus and seated the couple in front of us with a baby. After returning she asked for my ID again, which I again explained I did not have on me. I told her I wasn't going to drink. She said "it doesn't matter, this is a BAR, and I can't let you in without an ID".  Let me put this into perspective for you - my husband and I are both in our early 40's, and do not look under 21!  Also, if this is a BAR like she said, then why didn't she card the baby that was with the couple...why is she letting a baby into a bar?!  Also if you are a BAR, why do you have a full FOOD menu?! Let's be honest...you can call EVERY food establishment a BAR in Hoboken because of its young demographic. However, this was not 11pm on a Friday night...this was Noon on a Saturday afternoon!  My suggestion: they need to change their policy and have the servers card people at the tables during dining hours. By the looks upon entering the place, it was empty - they looked like they were hurting for brunch business...and it was later clear to me that this place has most likely been busted in the past for serving minors! I will NOT be back!!!!
2014-12-14,5,I was in here the other night lookin FRESH in my Patagonia... chugged maybe 8 coors lights at $2 a pop (jackpot) 3 fireball shots later and the "restaurant" had turned into a sea of short guys and jersey babes.  Easiest 5 stars I ever doled out!Positives:Great bartenderThe food looked edibleJersey hottiesNegatives:The disco ball wasn't spinning... FAILThe bouncer outside is always butthurt Recommendations:Topless party??
2014-12-09,1,One word to describe this place: PRETENTIOUSFor a place that runs a Monday night $5 all you can eat wing night they act like they're some high end establishment in the meat packing district. Monday night wing night is going to attract football fans and that's exactly why 3 of us wanted to go here. Eat a lot of wings and drinks a lot of beers. Upon walking in I was greeted by a bouncer (this alone on a Monday is weird) looking me up and down and telling me "no sweatpants". It was 20 degrees out and I was wearing black nike sweats on a Monday night going to a place for " $5 wing night".  Not even talking a Buffalo Wild Wings here. A FIVE DOLLAR ayce wing night.I ask if he's serious and then the hostess says "yea sorry no sweatpants". Best part of it all was the hostess was in raggity jeans and an ugly grey sweatshirt! Hahaha. WHAT A JOKE! The guy looked like he was in the local union coming from his daytime construction job. Not to mention a dozen people at the jam packed bar were also wearing hoodies.  Get a grip and know where you are. You're in the residential area of Hoboken. In NEW JERSEY. P.S. I've been here before and the wings aren't even good.
2014-11-25,5,I used to live around the corner from Tenth so naturally this was our go-to spot. Monday night $5 wings are unbeatable. The bartenders are friendly and fast even with a packed bar. Definitely miss being so close to it!  PS. this bar is also good for maintaining a solid rotation...
2014-10-17,4,This used to be one of my favorite bars when I lived in hoboken, i can rate it in so many ways, as it's a restaurant/bar/club like on the weekends but overall I'm giving it 4/5 because the $5 martinis on Thursday night are awesome! Furthermore, they have an extensive selection of martinis which makes it even better. They do specials every night of the week & they're all pretty legit. I loved Monday nights here for football too...free wings! The food in general is about a 3/5, but I just liked the ambiance here for some reason. In general, it gets pretty crowded on football nights & Thursday-Saturday evenings. In comparison to some of the downtown hoboken places like the Shannon & McSwiggins, there's a much better crowd, older & more upscale.
2014-10-06,1,About 6 or 7 months ago I wrote a pretty good review on this place, but my opinions have since changed. I was here with coworkers for lunch a few weeks ago. It was right after they opened and there was nobody else in the place- just the 8 of us. We placed our order and 45 mins later we still didn't have the food. We asked the waiter what was up and he replied "this isn't McDonalds." Rude but whatever. The hour mark rolls by; 2 people in our party have now left because they don't have the whole afternoon to eat lunch. I approach the blonde manager Peggy (???), who, by the way, is dressed in gym attire, and she tells me with an attitude that they make their food from scratch, so that's why it was taking so long. Oh I'm sorry. You and every other restaurant in Hoboken use fresh ingredients. Do you farm your own chickens too? Even though it takes forever to make it, the chicken cheese steak is awesome, so the BF and I gave it another swing last week. We called in for take out and they never gave us a time frame for pick-up; they said "we'll call you when it's ready." So what does that mean? You'll call me in 3 hours? Ain't nobody got time for that.
2014-10-03,1,Tonight's bill over $300 for mediocre bar food! Never going again ! Over priced mediocre restaurant In Hoboken .
2014-09-10,3,I can't hate a place who's first question upon walking up to the door was "you getting wings?"  Why yes.. yes I am.  Monday's are a solid wing deal. $5 for all you can eat, now they aren't the best wings but they do the job and the staff does a good job at keeping them stocked.  They also say "2 drink minimum" however their is no way they can or try to enforce this.   They are covered in three sauces (bbq, asian, and hot sauce) however napkins were scarce.  Also they limit where the "all-you-can-eaters" are allowed to sit.  Any table that has water glasses on it is off limits and this includes some tables in the front bar area.  Some gruff, unpleasant, and stressed manager man wasn't pleased when he asked us to move.  Sorry brah.The wait staff seemed annoyed and innattentive.  It was incredibly crowded because the giants were playing and in leu of "excuse me" the waitors opted to just barrel through you, perhaps channeling a bit of what was on the television.  I glanced at the real menu and while the options sounded nice, the price did seem a bit high.  Bar tenders were quick and effcient, just how I like it.  Wing night is not date night, don't come expecting that.
2014-08-24,2,For the price the food was mediocre.   Had the cucumber martini which tasted watered down.  We never received the appetizers we ordered.  Staff forgot to put the order in.  Will not be back!!
2014-05-10,5,Absolutely awesome food! This place is much bigger inside than it looks. There's a bar in the front when you first walk in, and they have outdoor seating. It's not right on Washington, so it wasn't super crowded even though it was a nice night. We sat inside all the way in the back and so the only complaint I have is that the seating was very tight (like, barely enough room to get to your chair without hitting into the people around you) but that's pretty much to be expected in Hoboken. Waitress was very, very attentive and the food was amazing!!! The cornbread encrusted chicken was absolutely fantastic. I will be going back for sure!
2014-05-04,1,If you're looking for a night out of neglect and disappointment, come here. Tonight was the first night I really believed in zombie existence. Not sure if the staff was on drugs or what, but maybe if I brought my fog horn I could've gotten attention - or at least a glass of wine I ordered 30 min prior. I come here on weekends often and the last two times I came for dinner, I wanted to slam my skull against the table to get someone to come over and take my drink order. After endless attempts at getting a glass of wine and a salad, I got both, I couldn't eat my meal because a loss of appetite from watching my server dig his fingers to claim an itch in the rear of his pants.
2014-04-24,1,You need two photo IDs with birth dates on them to get into this establishment.  Not going to jump through hurdles to eat dinner in a bar.  Staff was rude and my group felt unwelcome.
2014-04-23,3,10th and Willow is home to the best wing special in all of Hoboken.Monday night features all you can eat wings for $5, with a two drink minimum.Wings come in buffalo, bbq, and teriyaki, and they're probably the best teriyaki wings I've had. The specials the rest of the week are pretty good too, and happy hour isn't bad. They also have outdoor seating, which is nice for lunch in the spring and summer.I'd throw em four stars, but I've had a few bad experiences with the staff here.
2014-04-21,4,This place is great. Brunch was satisfying and good. I will definitely hit this place for brunch again!
2014-04-12,3,Had lunch with family today. Good food. Terribly slow service. Too pricey for portion size. Owner seemed distressed. Dropped the F bomb within earshot of diners. Nice!!. One waiter covering all the tables, it seemed. Anyway come back for dimmer and drinks. Has to be better and a whole lot less screaming kids around. Lots of tvs.
2014-04-07,5,Tenth and willow is easily my favorite restaurant/bar in Hoboken! The food is phenomenal and the service is even better. I highly recommend the spinach artichoke dip  for an appetizer and for an entree I'd go with the philly cheesesteak, but you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Tenth and willow also has some great drink specials including $2 coors lights! Highly recommend going to tenth and willow for any occasion dinner, brunch, or drinks on a friday or saturday night!
2014-04-05,4,I came here for Monday night all you can eat wings night. Honestly I didn't expect much. I thought for $5 and people (mostly guys) gorging themselves on them, why would 10th and Willow make much of an effort to keep the quality up? I was pleasantly surprised. These were not puny wings that you might find at your average wings place. They were a nice size and they offered three different flavors, all of which were really tasty. They require a 2 drink minimum if you do all you can eat wings, which isn't that big of a deal since I'd be having at least 2 drinks anyways.I haven't been here for dinner or brunch but I live across the street and it always seems to be busy. It's great to have a place like this so I don't have to walk all the way over to Washington St.
2014-02-21,5,Came here to catch one of the last regular season football games and boy was I not disappointed. The interior (and crowd) is exactly like you would expect. Dark wood and slightly/very fratty-bro type. I was probably one of the few women in there but hey, a football game was on so I suppose this could be expected. Not that I minded the atmosphere. It was quite homey. Food. GREAT. I am a HUGE wings fan and I  am VERY picky. Their buffalo and BBQ wings were out of this world. Definitely hands down the best that Hoboken has to offer. They were large, real meat (not like that slimy hairy crap you usually get) and were cooked perfectly. I crave them daily. We also had a burger (split it with the hub). Definitely a great burger as well. Will absolutely be back. I live uptown so this is my new go to.
2014-02-08,3,10th and Willow is not just a restaurant or a bar or a dance club, it's actually all 3 on a Friday night. While the economist in me applauds them for attempting to satisfy all three categories, the foodie purist in me was not appeased. If you're looking to have a nice dinner at a restaurant, the dance club atmosphere- super dim and loud music, will make you and your dinner feel out of place. The food is good but a bit pricey at $20+ an entree. We had apps of calamari, crab cake and wings.  Entrees featured half rack of baby back ribs, pizza topped w sausages.
2014-01-22,4,This place is definitely quality over quantity. Wednesday night has half priced menu, got the skirt steak over meshed, it was delicious, but only five slices of steak cooked to perfection. buffalo shrimp appetizer was awesome, strongly recommended. Wife had the angel hair with mussel it was flavorful and enjoyed it as well. Normally If your not ordering sandwiches or burgers the entrees here are pricey, not what you expect from a bar restaurant. But it's worth it, the food and services here are top notch.
2014-01-20,1,The service at this place is horrible!!!  This is the third time that I try going to this place and ask myself why!  The food is not great, the service is horrible!!!!! and unless you are in the main bar room, the other rooms do not have great access to TVs.  The Managers and hostess at this place is just insanely RUDE!
2014-01-08,4,10th & Willow is a sports bar that doesn't know its a sports bar (which is conveniently how I like my sports bars). Part old school hoboken class, part hip hoboken panache, 10th & Willow offers a surprisingly large space (disclaimer large for hoboken) that will satisfy sports enthusiasts, fine diners, and bar hopping beer lovers alike. Tip: Come on Monday's for "Wing's Night" (arguably Hoboken's best deals). $5 for a variety of all you can eat buffet style wings. Don't let the 2 drink minimum dissuade you, you may come for the wings but guaranteed you stay for the atmosphere.
2014-01-02,5,The best, local restaurant/bar in the back corner of Hoboken!I've spent many Thursday evenings here: Half price martinis and extended happy hour til midnight! Can't pass that up! They're martinis are so good and there are so many fun flavors to choose from!Yes, the prices can be a little ridiculous. Stick to the first two pages of the dinner menu for more reasonable prices.Favorite Apps: spinach and artichoke dip, calamari, baked brie, hummus platterFavorite Food: bistro salad, mexicali burger with chicken, thanksgiving turkey wrapI had my going away dinner here when I moved out of Hoboken, one of my best friends had her graduation party here in one of the back rooms with her whole family, and I have attended countless other celebratory and casual gatherings here. It's always a people-pleaser!
2013-12-31,4,Been here couple of times. Nice bar with good music. Have heard a lot about its food from my friends but haven't tried food yet. Drinks are reasonably priced. Will go back here again.
2013-12-16,4,I can't really comment on the "bar scene" here, but 10th & Willow is a great place to grab a bite and a drink.  I used to live across the street and ordered dinner from here once a week (the Cobb salad and Philly burger were personal favorites; they also do a great weekend brunch).  I've been back for dinner/drinks occasionally since then, and have never been disappointed.  My wife and I were here last week with some friends for dinner.  We each ordered the skirt steak salad.   I was happy to see that 10th & Willow hadn't slipped in quality since my last visit. The steak was flavorful, tender, and cooked well.  The greens were fresh.  Our server was attentive and very cheerful. My only complaint is that the dishes are on the expensive side, but not particularly generous.  (That's been my observation from the first time I came here, but the food is good, and it was convenient to my apartment.)  The menu is diverse, with some pretty interesting selections, including a good selection of standard American bistro food.  I'm also a big fan of the flavored butters that come with the complimentary bread (last week was buffalo-ranch).  They also have a decent beer selection, and a list of some pretty interesting looking cocktails.
2013-10-25,4,Really great spot with quality food. It is a little on the more expensive side, especially for the pizza, salad, apps, but their entrees are well worth the price. The corn bread coated chicken and buffalo chicken empanadas are my favorites. Their wings are awesome and on Mondays they do a $5 all you can eat wing special. On Thursdays they have half prices martinis...although girly the gummy bear martini is delicious!!The only downside I can think about for 10th and Willow is their delivery service. I have all together stopped ordering for delivery from there because I have always waited over an hour for the food and on multiple times, it's arrived cold. I called and complained and they quickly corrected the problem and issued a partial refund - good management right there.love this place, go check it out
2013-10-24,4,10th & Willow was the perfect spot to get our grub on and stay late to let it turn into a real bar. Granted, most people were already boozing by the time we ordered our food, so lots of people were hovering in that way you hover at bar as we were casually seated munching on our burgers. The food was decent, nothing exceptional, but definitely filling. Our waitress was nice, but maybe a bit new, and couldn't offer any insight on the menu or suggestions. We all chose well and were able to have a fun evening out. I'd recommend 10th and Willow as a casual bar if you're in the area
2013-10-20,5,Food is very good as is the cool atmosphere.  The owner was very friendly and made sure we had a good seat.  Drinks are a bit over priced but one of my favorite Hoboken haunts
2013-09-16,5,We had 10th and Willow cater a recent party and everything was great. The person that handled the catering order was very thorough and helpful. They suggested we get the food delivered right before the guest arrived so the sandwiches were hot and the wings were crispy.  We also ordered some salads which were awesome.  I highly recommend if you are considering having an event catered. I will absolutely use them again!
2013-09-10,2,The food is decent, but the staff is sub par. Rude/slow waiters, and I've seen that the bouncers think they are policeman. I've seen them be very rough on patrons that aren't deserving of it. Power trip to the max. Overpriced and meh food.The only redeeming quality is their buffalo shrimp app. YUM!
2013-09-10,3,When Peter K had told me about $5 all you can eat wings (Tagalog translation: eat all you can) on Mondays, I thought I had found my haven just in time for football season.Wings are served buffet style. Half-sized hotel trays filled with buffalo, BBQ and honey teriyaki wings. All the bleu cheese you will ever need in small plastic containers. And even all the wet naps you need.The problem starts with the fact that seating is free-for-all. Grab a seat and hope no one takes your seat when you come up to get your wings. I wasn't even able to sit with people I arrived with. Other people were reserving 4 seats with their friends who didn't come until 30 minutes later.Another problem is the wings just aren't good whatsoever. Buffalo and honey teriyaki are tasteless. BBQ have WAY too much breading. I swear I had a few that were just chicken bone and breading. Beer selection is just about respectable. The normal selections plus Dogfish Head, Brooklyn Brewery and maybe another 1 or 2 craft beers.Staff here is really nice. They definitely take care of their customers, especially their regulars. They'll be sure to take away your plates, fully explain the wings situation and socialize with you. They definitely make this place a 3 star where I would have easily given this place a 2.
2013-09-05,3,God, if you don't come here on Mondays, you're getting screwed over at KFC. What you do is, you come in, sit down, and ask for the unlimited wings. Forgive me, but you either pay $5 or $10 (I can't remember!) and you put this snazzy nightclub wristband on (pretty sure it says drink responsibly) and you get to binge eat wings the whole night. But, that is the only good thing about this place. It's overpriced, and the portion sizes aren't good (some are HUGE but then some are really small.)But yeah, Mondays are the day to come.
2013-09-02,5,I am so glad that I moved right across the street.  I was immediately welcomed with a shot from the manager.  The bartender is a doll.  They have a huge selection of liquor and a great line of drafts.  Know what is awesome?  They have brunch everyday.  I was long past breakfast and moved to lunch and wow, the cheese (chicken) steak is friggn awesome.  I do not know what cheese they use, but it is delicious.  Make sure you get the peppers and onions.  That is a must for more greatness.  Daily specials include:$5 ayce wings, 1/2 off apps and entrees 1/2 off martinis, etc...I will prolly be living here.
2013-08-21,4,Really nice little neighborhood spot.  Not crowded for lunch during the week.Nice classic, but slightly classy bar atmosphere with large windows to watch the Hoboken world go by on Willow street.  Quick seat at the bar, and dropped my order for a Buffalo Chicken wrap ($10) and also had an iced tea.Since I wasn't having wings, I was glad I had a chance to try this, because the chicken is really tasty and plump. (see pic)  I didn't realize it also comes with Blue Cheese sauce, so if you don't like that, a little heads up.The waitress was friendly and personable. Overall, a good spot, with special daily deals, as noted on their blackboard.
2013-08-15,4,This place is around the corner from my boyfriend's apartment, so this is one of our go-to places when we're lazy and want to go out. The atmosphere is very nice - since we were having dinner, we were seated all the way in the back room, away from the noise and commotion of the bar. There was plenty of outdoor seating as well. I enjoy that they leave a pitcher of water on your table so you're not constantly waiting for refills. Since we were the only customers in the back dining room, the service was a little slower, but the waitress still did a good job.They serve bread and flavored butter - they are always changing the flavors and it is always delicious. Definitely something I look forward to coming here.The food is great, as well. Check their weekly specials: Tuesdays are 1/2 price apps, and Wednesdays are 1/2 price entrees. I had a delicious skirt steak and my boyfriend got a burger. The portions were the perfect amount, not overly enormous, and the flavors were all delicious. The prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and atmosphere of the restaurant.Overall, great place. I still have other restaurants I prefer in Hoboken which is why I'm only giving 4/5 stars, but it's definitely worth trying and I will be coming back here for sure.
2013-08-14,4,Went here for a friend of mines birthday and had a fantastic time. The package included an open bar for $40 which you were given a wristband as soon as you walked in the door. The front room is quite small and crowded but the manager quickly moved us to a more spacious and comfortable back area with its own bar.
2013-08-08,1,I've come to the conclusion that this place is run by a jerk, staffed by idiots, and patronized by brats. It is a few steps from home for me but I will take a few more to the Turtle Club.Last 3 visits to 10th & Willow...1. Early evening, 6ish, Saturday in July...relatively empty front room, a few seated tables in back rooms."2 for dinner, please.""Do yo have a reservation?""No we don't. Is there a wait?""It might be 10-15 minutes""Sure, ok, can we check out a menu?""I can't give you a menu unless you're seated.""Um, sure, there are 50 other places around town so we'll just go there.""Fine."2. Sunday, July 28...CONCACAF  Gold Cup game, US v. Panama...a full bar of soccer fans, all in full patriotic regalia. Hoping for TV with sound since we're the only ones there instead we get a TV and Tupac (f. K-Ci & Jojo) "How Do U Want It?" Now I see why this bartender works the Sunday afternoon shift during the summer.3. A Friday night, 830ish, a quick beer, go to bathroom, bros sharing stall snorting furiously. Awesome. Get zooted up to stand around, grind your teeth, and stare at people.
2013-08-05,2,This review is about their Sunday brunch. We didn't want to wait for tables at Elysian Cafe, so my friend and I decided to try this place out as an alternative. Turns out we would have been better off waiting.It's very hard to mess up eggs, but 10th and Willow managed to do just that. The Skillet Breakfast I ordered was a healthy portion size, but it had no taste. It's as if they cooked the dish without any type of seasoning. Even the ham used was severely lacking in the sodium department. The side fruit was not sweet, and my toast was burnt around the edges. The only reason I gave the meal two stars instead of one is because the Spinach & Artichoke Dip we had as an appetizer was one of the best I've had in Hoboken.For $13, I was really expecting a top notch breakfast, but what I got was pretty much the opposite. It feels like I paid Hoboken premium pricing for something I could easily get a better serving of at IHOP. This is the least bang for my buck that I've gotten in a long time.We sat at the bar, so I wasn't expecting a full waiter experience, but there were still many things I feel they feel short on. My drink glass was empty halfway through my meal and was never refilled. My screwdriver had very little alcohol and had way too much ice. During our entire meal, we were not asked how everything was and even had to ask for my own utensils. I know a bartender is not a waiter, but when entire place is mostly empty, I think he could have done a better job of making sure we had a good experience. The only reason I gave the service two stars instead of one is because the Hostess was very personable and made some engaging small talk while I waited for my friend to arrive.This is one of those places that may look better under dim lighting than during the day. On a Sunday morning, I felt like the interior was lacking personality. Most of the furniture looks like someone just picked them out of a vintage sears catalog. Everything is very clean though, which I did appreciate. There are a few outdoor tables, but they looked a little cramped. It's located directly on a corner and the street parking situation is definitely better than places along Washington Avenue.Food: 2/5Price: 2/5Service: 2/5Environment: 3/5All in all, I do not see myself coming back here for brunch ever again. However, I have heard they have a decent nightime bar scene so maybe I'll try that out one of these days.
2013-07-31,5,I can honestly say I have never been disappointed when I go here. In fact, I have been both a customer and have also planned events here for years. You can't go wrong with the service, food, and the staff. I would highly recommend this establishment. Two of my favorites include the Thanksgiving Turkey Wrap and the Teryaki Wings. Their nightly specials range from MON $5 wing night, Tues 1/2 price appetizer night and Wed as 1/2 price entree night. The staff is fantastic and always take care of the guests and their regular customers. It's a definitely neighborhood hit! The owner always manages to know the regulars and treat them well. I will definitely be returning and would recommend it.
2012-12-16,3,2.5 stars, rounded up to 3 on account of the good atmosphere (the restaurant is big, comfortable, and really well appointed)  and solid burger.  However, this spot easily has the potential to hit four stars in the future.  What's the problem?  The service was bad.Our waitress was friendly, but she clearly wasn't on her A-game (or her "C" game, for that matter).  She took our order, appetizer first. It took her an inordinate amount of time to write the word "wings" on the kitchen ticket.  Weird.  She took our burger order and that was it. Unlike other tables seated around us (helped by another server), she never told us about the specials or gave us bread.   Thirty minutes later, our burgers came out.  I told the food bringer-outer that we never got the wings we ordered.  Waitress came back and apologized, stating that she "never put in for the wings."  Strange explanation considering she painstakingly wrote "wings" on the same ticket as our burgers...Anyway, the burgers were excellent.  Cooked to order, juicy and delicious.  Although we're not in a rush to come back, I would recommend the burgers here.  We'll try it again in the summer.
2012-12-12,3,Frat out bro.Place is full of ex-fraternity kids, now working in finance. You know the type I am talking about./End thread.
2012-12-09,4,standard bar, with a slightly older and sexy crowd, it's definitely on the top of my list of places to hit up when i go out in Hoboken
2012-11-30,3,Hard to believe that I had never eaten here until tonight, but we made the trip on a Friday night for dinner. We were seated right away, and I was pleasantly surprised at how large the back dining area was - the best part was that the tables weren't close together at all and we were seated comfortably, which can be an issue at some other spots. The menu is pretty diverse - good mix of apps, salads, burgers, sandwiches, entrees and even pizzas. They do a different flavored butter every night - I've heard of everything from Kit Kats to buffalo chicken. Tonight's was bruschetta and goat cheese. The pizzas are reasonably priced and are actually a large size. We tried the bruschetta pizza, cornbread crusted chicken and a steak and shrimp special. The pizza was good, thin crust and a little overcooked, but just crispy enough. The cornbread chicken was good. I was expecting a little bit more, but the sweetness of the BBQ sauce added a pleasant kick. My boyfriend got the steak and shrimp special, which was average. The steak was cooked as he ordered, but it had no season and it was drowning in a sauce that wasn't really needed. It's not the best food out there, but it's a comfortable spot with a menu big enough to cover everyone's appetites.
2012-11-16,2,Looks nice during day and food is OK, but they turn it into an awful awful club at night.  Not really a big fan of it.
2012-10-21,1,I do not recommend 10th & Willow to anyone who wants to drink.  We went there last night for my husband's 30th birthday to enjoy a few drinks and eat dinner at 6pm.  When we were seated at the table, an employee walked over and asked if my husband was "too drunk" to be there, while he was just watching a college football game.  We explained it was his 30th birthday and he was just hanging out.  5 minutes later, the owner/manager asked he if needed to leave, I explained that if in fact, my husband was "too drunk" to be there we would have left.  After the next few minutes of being watched like hawks, we decided to leave.  The owner than stated, "Oh! So he is too drunk to be here???", in which I explained that we were at a BAR at 6pm on a Saturday for dinner and he basically ruined the birthday dinner by interrogating the way he did.  Really?  We're at a bar, I get that you don't want wasted assholes coming in and causing problems, but seriously?  We were SITTING at a table, EATING dinner.  I will never go there again and I suggest that if you go, you probably shouldn't have any drinks, since you might be asked to leave.
2012-10-16,5,10th & Willow one of those places where I have had one of those "the best thing I have ever eaten" type experiences. Great food, friendly staff and great service. Just about everything I have eaten here has been really really really good. The staff is accommodating, especially the owner who can often be found on site greeting the customers and making sure things run smooth. This is the kind of place you never get tired of and the food keeps you coming back. My favorite dishes are the Buffalo Shrimp, Teriyaki Wings and the French Burger.
2012-10-02,1,Quite possibly the worst brunch I have ever experienced. Ever. Not worth the money.The bloody marys are excellent-but beware expensive $10. And they WILL add up, especially when you are forced to wait an hour (or more) for your food. The Mimosas were also about $9. Not worth it. Weak and not made with fresh OJ. Our meals took an hour and when they finally arrived the food was cold (but the plates were scorching hot). We were a party of 6 so I don't mind waiting, but it was clear our server had screwed up the order. My omelet was particularly disappointing. Overcooked with almost no fillings and the toast was cold. Our server conveniently disappeared around this time - most likely aware of our disappointment. When she finally decided to appear - I sent my meal back. I am a very polite person and never do this, but it was that bad.
2012-09-18,4,10th and willow, you have a good atmosphere, pretty solid menu but.....WHERE IS MY FOOD. Brunch means you haven't breakfast or lunch and waiting for 35+ minutes becomes dangerous
2012-08-07,3,Snotty staff.Apart from that, the food is good. I particularly enjoy their monday wings night. A couple of years ago it used to be free wings, with a minimum of two drinks. Nowadays it's $5 per person, with limited sitting, and still, a minimum of two drinks.Despite that I still find myself going there once in a while for some yummy wings (They offer three flavors: Teriyaki, which is very popular it seems, buffalo, and BBQ)
2012-03-28,2,Have come here with friends a few times for drinks (usually a pregaming spot before moving on to more fun places.)  The one time I actually ate here, I had the crab cakes.  Not a fan, and soooo overpriced.  They need to get their quality up and their prices in check.  The service is pretty good, though.  Overall, not a fan of this place.
2012-03-27,5,man..i dont know about yall but for $5 all you can eat wings on mondays. you cant beat THAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!and they give you blue cheese.
2012-03-18,2,Decent happy hour specials and good bar food specials during the week. It turns into woo-girl central on the weekends, with white people trying to dance to boring music. On the plus side, I don't think it's been crowded since 2009.
2012-02-26,2,not impressed.very overpriced.food is so-so. pretty standard bar food with some pasta and steaks thrown on the menu...i have a strange suspicion they think they are doing something different and try to portray themselves as more upscale than they really are. it has that sort of pretentious vibe when it shouldn't!go for drinks, not worth spending the money on dinner.
2012-02-23,3,I find 10th and willow to be really hit or miss. I used to live really close to here in Hoboken so it was definitely convenient. I like the burgers... those are good! Once I got some sort of steak sandwich and I think I got an upset stomach from it so I wouldn't recommend that! One of their signature things is that they have flavored butters served with the bread that are different every day. It is a nice touch but nothing really too fancy or difficult. It's ridiculously easy to make a flavored butter and they definitely do not make the butter in house, they just throw some herbs and store bought butter in a hobart mixer for 2min and whoaaaaaaa flavored butter! They have nice specials during the week... all you can eat wings, half price appetizers, martini specials etc etc. The staff can be really nice or really terrible. I have definitely had some great service, but I have also had some awful service served with a sneer. I think some of the ladies employed here have a little bit of a "I think I'm really hot (but I'm actually not)" complex. It gets really crowded of Fri/Sat nights and I have definitely had some fun times dancing. They move the tables from the front bar area which really opens it up. They also have a coat check in the winter which is great.
2012-02-22,5,This is my favorite bar in Hoboken.  I may be a little biased because it is the first place I went to after moving into my apartment and it's on my block but the place is awesome.  I was welcomed as a neighbor since the first day I stepped in.  I enjoy the selection of food they offer from brunch through dinner, it's all pretty much really good stuff. The atmosphere is pretty cool.  There is a nice bar with some high top tables, room to maneuver and 6 big flat screens to catch the games and big windows to people watch.  There is always decent music playing.  Through the first bar there is a second smaller bar and dining room then even another dining room back even further.  When the weather is nice there are a dozen or so tables outside as well. A nice touch for when the weather is cold they have hot chocolate outside so when you leave to walk home at the end of the night.They have a decent selection of rotating beers on tap.  If you know what to ask for they usually have some decent bottled beers as well if you know what to ask for. The wines are nothing to write home about, but a decent selection for (Mark West Pinot, Cloudy Bay Sav Blanc) if that's what you are looking for.  Fully stocked bar and well made drinks are always to be had as well. Willow has a great happy hour 4-7 every day, half priced domestic beers and martini's which means $2.50 pints and $5 martinis.The food is usually really good.  If you go for brunch make sure you ask for the muffins and butter of the day.  The mini muffins are usually warm and the kitchen is usually whipping up some sort of tasty flavored butter like cinnamon sugar to slather on the muffins. The lunch/dinner menu is really yummy too.  My favorite appetizers include the spinach/artichoke dip, the wings and one of my favorites is the buffalo calamari.  The sweet/spicy buffalo sauce covered with blue cheese is awesome.  The salads really good, the beet and cobb salads are standouts. I tend to not order the main entrees but the chicken cheese steak sandwich is good and the burgers are all pretty good.  But my favorite sandwich by far is chicken cutlet which features prosciutto, mozzarella and broccoli rabe served with marinara sauce for dipping.  No matter what sandwich you order, I would ask for the garlic mashed potatoes which are awesome.The weekly specials are really good.  Monday from 11am-11pm they offer all you can eat wings for $5.  There are buffalo and BBQ wings which are good but the best by far are the teriyaki!  Pair that up with a few HH beers and I call that a good night.   1/2 price select apps on Tuesday and  1/2 price select entrees on Wednesdays (the farfalle pasta is really good).  Thursday nights are  1/2 price beers and Martini's till midnight can make Friday's rough.All in all these are just a few reasons why I love 10th and Willow.
2012-02-18,3,I've been here a total of three times - 2 were for dinner with my girlfriend and 1 was a late night stop for drinks to cap the night.The atmosphere is very much like a bar trying to double as a restaurant with random tables scattered about, which I usually don't mind except for the fact that dinner is extremely pricey and you would expect less of a sports bar atmosphere for dinner.  They do have a dining room in the back, which is totally fine, but you still hear all of the noise coming from their bar area.  That being said, the food has never disappointed.  Both times I had dinner with my girlfriend the food was delicious.  We usually go halfsies because we're foodies and can never just have 1 thing on the menu.  I've had the crab cakes, the filet mignon, the baby back ribs, and a stuffed NY strip steak special - all of which were well above what I had expected.  I've also had two salads that were specials at the time and both were excellent.  The food is along the quality I would expect at a classier restaurant and it is quite surprising to be served these high quality dishes at what seems like (and smells like) a frat bar.The place is actually pretty good for drinks too - they get a pretty good crowd going late at night.  I guess that would explain the beer soaked wooden floors which give off the aroma of a frat house attic.Overall 3 stars - great food (better than what the atmosphere would suggest, but certainly on par with what the price would suggest) but the noise and the smell can get to you if you're planning on having a nice quiet dinner.  I'd give it 4 stars if I were just going to watch a game and have some wings and beer.
2012-02-18,1,I'm reviewing this strictly on brunch, which was terrible.  The restaurant smelled like Friday night's beer.  The hostess never attempted to smile.The food was disappointing.  I had the cinnamon raisin french toast.  For 10 dollars, you get 2 dollar worth of toast.  The slices are very thin and far from filling.  My girlfriend had the breakfast skillet.  It was dry and tasteless.  Denny's has better breakfast skillets, and that's no joke.Both items had a side of fruit...fruit from CVS.Our total was $65 for a two sub-par meals and two lackluster drinks a piece.  Stay away from this place for brunch.
2012-02-16,4,I would love to come here often! Living in Hoboken, I used to eat here every other day. I love love love the flavored butters!
2012-02-12,3,best wings in Hoboken. if you have an opportunity must stop by on a Monday for $5 all you can eat.also surprisingly one of the best places to go out at night. good crowd.
2012-02-09,3,Good for happy hour during the week - they have different specials each day of the week - decent food - and convenient location to people living in hobo
2012-02-04,2,Fantastic burgers and sandwiches. Favorites are Buffalo Calamari and the Mexicali Burger.  Other dishes are a bit pricey considering it's more of a bar atmosphere. Great service and great happy hour specials. PS.  They deliver too.
2012-02-04,2,The only reason to go here is for drinks or watching a game.  The food and service leave a lot to be desired.  Despite trying to give this place several chances, it continually disappoints.  After ordering our meals, it took over 20 minutes to bring one mini muffin and over 40 minutes for our meals to come out.  When the food arrived, it was a rare hamburger with onions, instead of a well-done turkey burger as ordered.  I left starving because I couldn't eat it and didn't feel like waiting longer for the proper order.  To compensate us, they took the burger which I didn't order off the bill....Gee, thanks.  I think we should have gotten the entire meal for free.  I'm sorry, but i don't feel like giving this establishment any of my money for below average service.  Save yourself similar aggravation and go somewhere else.
2011-12-10,2,This review is for the bar only - I have not had the food here.  I came here for the first time the other night and nothing really wowed me, but it definitely isn't a bad place, either.  The place wasn't incredibly packed (at least the night I was there) so you definitely had some room to operate.  This review is definitely a little more vague than my other reviews but there isn't much else to say.  It is just a pretty ordinary bar in Hoboken.
2011-12-07,5,picture this, Monday night and me and my girlfriend are craving for wings. all we wanted were wings from 10th and willow --but we live 25 minutes away and it's already 10:30 and finding parking in hoboken is like trying to find a needle in a haystack! we felt adventurous, so we took the trip. got there at 10:55 and double parked our car right next to the spot. went in, but the wings they were gone. never to fear my girlfriend is a social butterfly and we had been here before so she's cool with the bouncer. next thing i know we have wings at our table an assortment of teriyaki, bbq, and hot enough for about 3 people. and we had beer!! they took care of us and it felt good. it's a cool spot, the wings are banging! i especially love the teriyaki wings. the first time we went it was really packed, who's trying to miss out on $5 all you can eat wings and $2 draft beer? the 2nd time it was almost empty because the deal was over. they treated us really well and i have a good time each time we come here! when packed it'll be hard to find seating but if your girl is as good as mine you'll have seating in no time.
2011-12-05,5,Love this place!!!  10th & Willow is definitely my favorite night spot on the weekends (best DJ in my opinion), but I also love their food!  Great happy hour specials.  Went on a Friday evening recently for dinner and had a veggie burger.  I wasn't sure how this would come out, because lots of restaurants don't do a good veggie burger, but this burger was awesome (probably had a lot to do with the cheese, onions, ketchup and mustard).  We also got the thai calamari which was soo yummy.  Buffalo calamari is also delish here.Can't wait to go back for another veggie burger!
2011-11-30,4,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken for a number of reasons: ambience is fab, music is always great and I've never had a meal there I didn't LOVE. Most incredible appetizers: buffalo shrimp and the baked brie. Delicious entrees: cornbread encrusted chicken, pepper encrusted filet mignon, willow ave burger, crab cakes....I dream about everything on the menu. The wings are PHHHEENNOMENAL. They're huge, meaty, juicy monsters. Drool.
2011-11-29,5,5 star on the wings, absolutely the best in town. Place is lively and energetic on Mondays. I guess that's the price you pay when it's an all you can eat wings for $5. Drinks are also respectful, not watered down. Def recommended.
2011-11-19,1,I stood packed in like a sardine with Jersey douchebags, under a disco ball, and had a drink dropped and shatter all over my foot.  I will not be coming back here.
2011-11-11,4,Please note this review is for their wing night, I have never actually had a *real dinner* here.You have to come here on Mondays, $5 All you can eat wings.  Oh, and these aren't those little one bite and done wings, these are big meaty breaded wings drenched in hot sauce, teriyaki glaze, or BBQ sauce!  It is a seat and help yourself kinda thing, so get here early if you want a stool for MNF.  They also have pretty good beer specials all night.
2011-09-20,2,I've eaten here several times since I live around the corner and have yet to be impressed. I don't know why I keep giving it a chance when I'm continually disappointed. The food is way over priced based on the quality. In fact I'm pretty sure they microwaved the burger I order the other night. The only time I would recommend going here is for Monday night football, Wing Night. Other than that, don't bother.
2011-09-13,3,I really like this place.  Good vibe, friendly staff, and specials every day.  (Wednesday I believe is half-off the food menu, and Friday I know is a special on margaritas).  Also, for Monday Night Football they have free wings all night!
2011-08-24,3,Food was very good. The two people I was with got breakfast, I got a burger which was delicious and filling (good topping options too like avocado, sauteed onions, etc). Also got the nachos which had real chili, served nice and hot. Would have liked if our waiter was a little more attentive to us, but that's probably nit picking. And free-unlimited wings for Monday Night Football - WOW.
2011-06-05,1,Poor food. Very over priced. The chef who made this place great-about 3 years ago, is long gone. So are all the cool waiters & bartenders. The owner is really moody & unfriendly. He only has a few locals he is friendly with. Go to the Turtle Club around the corner, they have good pub fare, the owners know how to treat their customers, and the environment and music are much better. There are much better options in Hoboken.
2011-05-20,4,Went here for a few drinks on a Thursday night.  Nice open bar area with a little dining in the main room, and a small bar and more dining in back.  Cool place.  Good selection of beer and booze, interesting yet unpretentious young crowd.  The music was a little loud, but I think they were trying to initiate some dancing in the main room.  Nice Hoboken neighborhood bar.
2011-05-16,3,Ordered the spinach dip for an app. Nothing great or stood out. For the main, my girlfriend had a salad with goat cheese and shrimp. Salad was fresh and on the small size. I had a fish entree, very good, but over priced.  Overall good food, good service, slightly over priced.
2011-04-07,4,Unlimited wings?!?!?$10 1-hour open bar?!?!!I like this place.I've been here a couple of times and always walked away satisfied.  My first visit was a dinner experience.  The food was ok but what really got my attention was the butters they make. Apparently the guys in the kitchen like to experiment and mix all sorts of different flavors into butter.I've also had some great drinking experiences here.  I'm a big fan of the aforementioned 1-hour open bar.  Let's face it, anything over 2 hours is dangerous.  Having a cheap, one hour extravaganza let's cut loose but still hang around for the rest of the night.  The back room becomes standing only and dance music gets pumped out.  Luckily there are also a few TVs so I could occupy myself with sports!And don't worry, the drinks here are strong ;)
2011-03-31,3,Have come w my bf on a variety of occasions. If it's not summertime, we always prefer to sit int the back room. It's more romantic back there plus given the time of night the front room can get very noisy, ESP if there's a game on. 10th and willow can make a mean dirty martini and their crab cakes are some of the best I have ever choices I have always thought that their menu was a little too narrow. I'm only in Hoboken on weekends but I am told that 10th and willow has a great wing night and good martini specials on thurs.rGood classy neighborhood restaurant and a great choice for a local romantic dinner.
2011-02-28,3,Came here for brunch this past Sunday to cap off a fun girl's night with some college friends. My friend who lives in hoboken is right down the street, so this was super convenient, as most Sunday mornings after a night out the less planning the better. There was no wait at noon on Sunday, so that was nice. The ambiance is very nice- exposed brick, high top tables, a big bar. There are several flat screen tvs. The only thing I didn't like was the dim lighting- there weren't any interior lights on, and the sun only came in from the top of the They serve brunch every day; my two friends got the willow breakfast which consisted of eggs, breakfast meat of your choice, toast, fruit, home fries, and french toast. I decided to get the huevos rancheros; their take included two poached eggs on top of a black bean purree and crisp corn tortilla, salsa fresca, and guacamole. This was also served with a side of home fries. The food was good- my meal was nicely portioned, though I think $12.00 is a bit much to charge for what I got, but they gave me a huge scoop of guacamole. My friend's french toast was the size of regular bread (nothing thick and hearty which I automatically think of when I hear french toast), but it was coated with lots of cinnamon and sugar and it had a nice crisp to it. Their breakfasts were pretty big, but I don't know if it was $16.00 Our server was friendly and came around with coffee and water frequently. Our total bill came to a little under 60.00, which was kind of pricey (split 20.00 before tip) but I feel like that's hoboken for you.
2011-02-26,1,My husband and I have been going to 10th and Willow for about 2 years now.  It used to be a great neighborhood spot for us and we could always count on it for a tasty burger (esp. the sliders) and good service.  Lately it's been 'meeh' and for some reason our bill keeps getting higher and higher.  Tonight, I ordered a special mahi mahi taco dish which cost $28.00.  It was edible but nothing worth that much.  The app was okay too. In the end we spent around $95.00 with tip which was such a waste of money. So overpriced for not great food. Needless to say, we wont be coming back.
2011-02-20,4,Great spot off the beaten path in Hoboken. My boyfriend and I came here for Valentine's day; the food was delicious and the ambiance was romantic.
2011-01-28,1,Let me start by saying i HATE this place. I live in the neighborhood so checked it out a few times: nothing to write home about. I ordered the shrimp and pasta dish- $29 for 5 of the smallest shrimp I've ever eaten AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN CLEANED. I'd rather go up the street to Anthony David's where I can actually get a nice set of prawns that are de-vained, cleaned properly, and are the size of my head. When I spoke to the waiter at 10th & willow about this ridiculously priced dish that was extremely small- he totally agreed with me. the bill came to $80 something for 2 entrees and 2 beers. which if you ask me is RIDICULOUS for a restaurant; that isn't Michelin rated, that doesn't have a celebrity or even outstanding chef. I foolishly gave it another chance. one night i ordered a salad and some wings for takeout. as I'm eating it I find a hair in it. OK, i work in the restaurant biz- i know these things happen. fine. i pick it out and move on, trying to forget about it. midway though my salad I start choking on a hair that was literally half way down my throat. I am not kidding when i say my friend had to pat me on the back several times so as not to swallow it. I somehow managed to pull it out to find a long black hair. Being a blond i knew it wasn't mine and was so disgusted at this point I put everything in the trash. Called the next day to speak to a manager and was finally called back the next day by the owner. WHO IS A COMPLETE A$$HOLE. he hurried me off the phone, hardly apologized and was like if you want another salad call me. We were on the phone for about 40 seconds and i get that there isn't much to say, but this d bag was not sorry and didn't really care about the hair in the salad situation. I will never ever EVER eat here again. I'd rather starve than go back to this loser's restaurant.
2010-12-27,4,Went here on 4th of July right after the fireworks - was empty but soon filled up very quickly.  The owner introduced himself and we all enjoyed a shot on the house!  Atmosphere and drinks were great - love my flavored vodka! Want to def. come back to try their food
2010-12-24,5,This is our neighborhood dining establishment and we totally love it.  I have to agree that the ambiance does catch you off guard.  We were told to go there because they have great food and it felt a bit "sportsbar-ish," so we were thrown off the first time.  However, as explained, there are three rooms and the further you go back, the more it looks like a "real" restaurant.  The food is actually quite good.  I've tasted about 6 dishes on the menu and I've been satisfied with everything I've chosen. The staff is really sweet and the owner does a great job of taking care of his guests (especially his regular guests). Just one point of clarification, I have had "better" food, but my point is that this food is excellent for the price and the atmosphere.  If you're looking for a fancy, high-priced, status symbol dinner, go into NYC.  If you just want a fantastic meal with a great staff, this is your place. You'll feel at home at 10th and Willow and you'll definitely want to go back.
2010-12-23,3,Has a lot of potential, but has room for improvement too. Pretty good food (salads, sandwiches, bruscetta) and decent wine list, though some seems overpriced. The back room  is nice for dining, I just wish the front room/bar and outside dining area would have some music on beyond weekend club nights!
2010-10-11,4,10th and Willow is an enigma. I heard rumors of these amazing wing deals and decided to check it out with a friend when other dinner plans fell through. Sure enough, on Mondays $5 gets you unlimited wings (teriyaki, bbq, and hot), but there's also a 2 drink minimum. Unfortunately, I am not crazy about wings, but my compadre really enjoyed 'em. Instead, I opted for the skirt steak salad, which was awesome! The set up of this place was just a little bit curious. I was expecting sports bar with that kind of wing special, but there was a fair amount of romantic ambiance in there. Candle lit tables at 7pm made us question the whole thing since we weren't sure what we were in for. The establishment is much larger than it appears from the outside, too. The further you go back (3 rooms in total) the more romantic it gets. When we arrived there were a fair number of seating options when we walked in, but they soon went away. By the time we left, the place was packed to the gills! Men were standing around shoulder to shoulder sucking every ounce of meat off their precious wings. How they dealt with the 2 drink minimum without a place to set their beverages, I have no idea. Service was good. Ambiance was unexpected, but good. I'll be back.
2010-09-15,4,I'm a fan of 10th & Willow, mainly for their happy hour.  I work in the neighborhood and you can't beat 1/2 price drinks that start at 4:00.  I will be here quite often...good food menu too.
2010-07-06,3,This place probably deserves more than a 3 but I am not a fan of expensive bar food, granted though some of the food is better than most bars and grilles.  And yes I am not making sense but that is because I was confused walking in.  My brother recommended it because I asked him for a bar and grill near his place as we were going to his apt on the 4th of July for fireworks.  When me, the bf and the rents walked in, it had a bar and TVs for sports but then had white table clothes.  Restaurants with white table clothes is not a place my family usually goes.  Then I looked at the menu and it had some bar and grille apps like wings and tenders but then had fancy ones too.  Then I saw the prices for entrees and almost choked 12-14 bucks for a burger...oof.  I am cheap and I hate paying that much for a burger.  We ordered the buffalo tenders and cheese and bean quesadilla...the food was good, if not small portions for the money - i.e. 3 tenders only.  When my brother finally arrived he looked at the menu and exclaimed, wow more expensive than I remember.  I think they may have changed their scene a bit, especially from reading some of the below posts.  But here is where it deserves more stars.  The waitress was super nice and attentive but not in our face (granted the place was empty so niceness and attentiveness could be shot to hell if there were other people in the place) and the Turkey burger I ordered was huge and extremely yummy.  Usually the bigger the turkey burger, the drier it becomes.  This burger was moist and it had sauteed mushrooms and onions on them but the rye toast was not soggy at all.  And did I mention the thing was huge, I could not finish it.    So I am knocking it down a star because I think it has a confused identity but the burgers are really good so if you are looking for a nicer place than the bar and grilles near the Path then I would recommend this place...just remember it is a bit pricier.
2010-06-24,4,Stopped here for dinner on whim (cute outdoor patio!) visiting my sister in Hoboken. The menu was pretty pricey for dinner but it was half priced entrees so they were only $10-16, much more reasonable. I had the tilapia with rice for $14, I believe. It was a great portion of fish on rice with green beans. My sister had the fried chicken, my mom had the shrimp penne, and my lucky brother had the pizza. All of the food was enjoyed but the pizza was really good. We were all stealing it from him. Nothing looked as good coming out but I'm a pizza addict.The bread was one of the best parts of the meal, mainly because the butter was with cheese and jalepeno. It was sooo yummy and a great way to start the meal while waiting for our food. They also gave you plenty of water (and our waitress was very attentive). I didn't know what to expect from the atmosphere from the outside but it was really cute inside. There was a front bar area and then two separate sections. We were all the way in the back and it was cool and quiet. There were tons of "yuppie" business professionals in their twenties and thirties but I also saw people with little kids and older couples.
2010-06-14,4,delicious sunday brunch w mom and dad. i had never been there and my roomies said nothing but good things... and now i understand why! the wait staff is friendly and attentive, the meals are portioned appropriately (the extensive brunch menu is super clutch, too), and the mimosas are deeeeee-lish. i would have preferred some sort of unlimited breakfast beverage option, but since i was with my parents i didn't stress about not getting sloppy on a sunday... can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner, and i absolutely recommend for a great brunch.
2009-06-09,3,I have to agree with almost every review on here; the food is very good and the drinks are fairly priced with an extended martini list. The staff itself is great and pleasant, BUT the owner is an obnoxious egomaniac who does walk throughs in a Batman shirt and skinny jeans. He is rude to his staff in front of patrons and pretty much hits on anything that moves. That being said, It's still a place to try because of the menu and the bar staff.  Note to those who go there, if you do happen to meet the owner, never give any critiques, positive or negative. If you do you'll probably be asked to leave...Specials:Monday night - Free wings and $2 Miller and Coors Lite Tues - Half Price AppsThurs - Half price Martini's and a $10 open bar from 10-11pm
2009-05-25,4,I've passed this place hundreds of times on the bus, in a taxi or driving home at all hours of the day and know that it is clearly a very popular spot for the bar crowd. That unto itself tends to make me wary of the food in Hoboken. We finally ventured over during the holiday weekend for dinner and avoided the crowds completely (did EVERYONE go to the beach except us?) and made a meal out of some apps and salad. The buffalo-style calamari with hot wing sauce and blue cheese were a unique twist on an often pedestrian appetizer. I think they should serve them with carrots and celery though to complete the experience. The spinach artichoke dip came out in a bubbling hot crock with pita bread. It took a lot of strength not to pour it down my gullet like a Coney Island flame eater. The Mediterranean chopped salad was just okay. I didn't care for the pita croutons, which were basically just cubed pita bread sprinkled on top of the salad. It needed the crunch of real croutons. Speaking of bread, the warm rolls with herb butter were yummy. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, she even brought out our salad split on two plates without asking! Though we didn't try them, it's cool that all of their burgers can be made with sirloin, turkey, veggie or grilled chicken. My only complaints were that it was so dark I could barely read the menu and the 4 seat bar tables are a bit cramped for two, let alone 4, if you are dining instead of drinking.
2009-05-17,5,I find when you get a bit off Washington or don't have the prime river view real estate, you simply have to try harder (Witness Anthony David's). 10th & Willow proves that point smartly. The best meal I've had in Hoboken. A tuna encrusted with toasted sesame seeds posessed all the nuanced flavors of a storied Manhattan bistro. A cobbler that leaves your mouth in disbelief. As for the scene inside? No clue. We ate outside. Something I reccomend after reading the somewhat disparaging remarks about the obnoxious crew indoors. We had a nice, quiet dinner. Separated from the groping, gulping interior crowd by a thick pane of insulating glass.
2009-05-06,3,Place is a little dark.  As my friend Liz would say.. great first day atmosphere if he is questionable.  I like how they had three different rooms.  First one has a bar, high top tables and tvs for games.  The other two are nicer tables very railroad style.I was told that this place is known for its different type of butters that come in your bread basket.They have tons of diffferent type of sandwichs and burgers which were yummy.  Beware it is a ton of food.
2009-04-29,3,A-OK. I'd give it 5 stars for Wing Night on Mondays (but shhh! don't tell anyone about it!!) and 2 stars for the rest of the nights. It's an average bar.  It's super-crowded on the weekends, which is usually fine with me... but for some reason, I've never really met the nicest people there. Maybe I'm there on the wrong nights - who knows.  Wing Night, however, is amazing. Minimum of 2 drinks per person and there is a complimentary.... did you hear me? I said complimentary... full wing buffet.   You have 3 options - BBQ, Teriyaki or Hot wings.  I am a huge fan of the teriyaki.  You also have choices of carrots and celery and blue cheese.    They ran out of wings? Don't worry hundreds more are on their way.   Great marketing strategy and it seems to be working for them!   I'll most likely go back on the weekends, but it's not my favorite going-out bar.   Definitely one of my favorite Monday night spots.
2009-04-15,2,I've never been to the wing night on Mondays, and I heard that's pretty cool, so I'm not going to give this place 1 star.  I have been here on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, however, and it's not pretty.  It's incredibly packed, the line to the bathroom is long, and the music is a nightmare-ish mix of crappy 80's songs, top 40 songs for uncoordinated white guys to dance to, and Bon Jovi.  I have to admit that watching guys strike out with girls they've been feeling up for 20 minutes is hilarious, so ladies, be prepared to hear some of the worst game of your lives.  That being said, getting smushed at the bar and having to yell over the third playing of "Don't Stop Believing" doesn't entice me to go back.
2009-04-02,5,10th and Willow is a fantastic place for different types of nights. I have held events there, taken my parents for dinner there, and spent a lot of time at the bar, or eating brunch or dinner with friends there. Many people don't know about the delicious menu that 10th and Willow offers. Some don't think of it as a restaurant b/c it didn't always have such a varietal menu. Before I dragged my husband there, who is now a fan, he always thought it was just a club. The drinks are fantastic and their menu offers so many different options. They have terrific specials throughout the week as well. Nice ambiance since they redid the place a few years ago. Check out free wing night on Mondays and try their chicken cheesesteak!
2009-03-17,4,I only went in for a few drinks but I was impressed with what I saw. Our beer was reasonably priced and our food (we ordered an appetizer) hit the spot. I'll be going back.
2009-03-17,2,This place is terrible. Overpriced, tiny portions, always crowded (and I have no idea why). The food is awful, the service sucks, the people who work there are incompetent and rude and their prices are as if they are in the city. This is a mediocre place in Jersey, people!
2009-02-27,5,So far one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken -- When I moved into the neighborhood, our landlord told us about 10th and Willow and said we needed to check it out.  She was not wrong.  The food is great, the servings are huge, and ambience (especially if you sit in the back dining room area) is really nice.  I haven't been here for the bar, but for dinner, it's spot on. My husband and I brought his whole family and his family friends here the day after Christmas.  We were catered to so well with the owner (manager?) coming up to us and asking us how everything was, and even offerring us free drinks.  Once he found out my husband and I lived nearby, he even offerred to hold an extra copy of our key at the bar in case we ever lock ourselves out!  haha.  So, all in all, a great place.  Definately try their burger with the onion rings on it -- the onion rings might be the best onion rings i ever had in my life -- too bad they don't serve them just as sides!
2009-02-07,3,10th & Willow is much like a bipolar girlfriend. Sometimes she treats you right, comforts your hunger, and quenches your thirst after a long work week. Other times she ignores your existence, chooses her more well-to-do friends over you, and rolls her eyes when you walk through the door.Given that I live right around the corner, I've seen both personalities. Let's start positive. My parents love coming here for dinner. Their burgers really are something to rave about, especially when ordered with their oversized English muffins. Their beer specials during dining hours are noteworthy as well - can't beat a Sierra Nevada draft for $2.50! The owner approached my parents at the end of our meal, hoped they liked their order, which they had, and offered them drinks at the bar on the house. Unfortunately, they were headed home and respectfully declined, but had very nice things to say about the offer on the ride back.When night rolls in, so do 10th & Willow's clientele. One example of this should give you a good picture of what to expect past 10:00p. I've seen two young women, maybe mid-20s, dressed to the nines, sit at the bar, order nothing at all, and spend twenty minutes looking over their shoulders with not a word exchanged between them. After their allotted time expired, that was their signal to move on to the next meat market seeing as no one gave them the time of day and bought either of them a drink. If this is how these women wanted to spend their night, wasted effort (or lack there of) that promises to never live up to their expectations, so be it. To the bar's defense, this isn't entirely under their control. They are a business like any other establishment and everyone is welcome. It's just a shame that those that choose to fill this particular establishment are often pretentious and, hate to break the news, better than you.I've read nightmares of how the staff has treated patrons, though I've never experienced it. I've gotten nothing but great service and nice gestures from the owner, the bartenders, and the bouncers alike. The drinks can be a bit costly, but nothing to complain about in Hoboken, and their entrees are a little overpriced.The beautiful wood decor should not go overlooked. 10th & Willow looks damn sexy and really puts on a great first impression - much like your bipolar girlfriend on the night you two kids met. By last call, the stiff crowd loosens up a bit. Do yourself a favor and save this bar for a nightcap.
2009-02-05,3,I have to break this review up into two parts, one is a review of the bar at night, the other is a review of the brunch. Let us begin.....The bar is right around the corner from where I live, so moving in I thought I would be here a lot. Unfortunately for me this bar is full of pretentious people so I have not been here too much. Drinks are priced accordingly but the atmosphere is very stiff. I would advise coming to this bar drunk already if you want to have a good time.The brunch is a bit expensive as average meals are over $14. But, I will say they give you enough food to be full until dinner. There is also a different butter offered every weekend. The time I went it was an apple toffee butter and it was delicious. I wish that brunch came with a complimentary alcoholic drink like most other brunches offered in the area.
2009-01-28,3,Worth it to go early on a Monday night for the free wings and half priced beer. I've heard and read a few awful reviews about service from management, however have never experienced this first hand. All in all the burgers are wayy too big but I guess you get what you are paying for. Nice date atmosphere, Its conveniently located but if you don't live within walking distance parking will be an issue for you. If you go for the wings, try the teriyaki!
2009-01-17,2,Not a bad location, although hard to find parking around, and certainly a bit chillier due to the open space than expected. Seated on higher bar chairs around the tables on the edge of the space for brunch, there's a nice selection for brunch.Unfortunately, the food took a while to come out, and was no longer hot by the time it reached my table other than the inside of my eggs for the eggs benedict, and the hollandaise sauce was incredibly salty, too. Ham was okay, but it tasted and felt like round spam, as opposed to real ham...Probably a better bar than restaurant in the winter, I susepct.
2008-11-20,4,I have been to 10th and Willow a few times for dinner. I think Ihave had the hummus, a salad a burgers. Everything was pretty good. They also have really cheap martinins on Thursday nights for ladies. Oh and there is a really hot bartender!I went two weeks ago on a Saturday night which I was not looking forward to. I heard some scary things from my friends about how is was liek a club and filled with stereotypical Jersey guidos. Not the case at all! The place was a little on the young side (I am 28), but I thought it was a good bar crowd. Not sure about the cost of drinks (it was one of those nights where things got cloudy). Only warning I will give is there were tons of guys. I am not complaining, but just thought I would warn the boys :)
2008-11-14,2,I have heard terrific things about 10th & Willow, especially in regards to their food.  Though the beer and wings are the main draw here, the rustic pub also serves some fancier entrees as well.My lowly review is based on a quick trip to the bar on a Saturday evening.  My friend and I luckily avoided a line by going early, however, once we entered the bar, we could not move.  The place was packed, but not in a good way...We managed to snag two seats at the bar, but were constantly being pushed from behind by those submitting drink orders.  Also, the music was way too loud.  This might be a great place to watch a game or enjoy some bar snacks, but it is definitely not conducive to a chill night out.
2008-10-06,4,The food here is consistently good. They always infuse something in their butter (e.g. orange peel, strawberry, etc.) that comes with the bread basket, which is quite neat. They have really good wings. They have 3 flavors, and I like the teriyaki one best. During the summer, they have a tasty and refreshing lobster roll.
2008-07-04,4,This place is great for lunch, brunch or dinner.  I've yet to have the wings, but I hear good things.  They do have kick ass burgers and seasoned fries.  Another plus is that they make a killer bloody mary.  This bar also has a very chill scene, whether you're there for a casual meal or to catch a game on one of their many flat screens all over the bar.  I have a feeling this is going to be a spot I catch the Giants games when football season kicks into gear.  The staff is also very attentive, from the moment you arrive until your check comes.
2006-08-23,4,You absolutely must try their martini's (their food is pretty good too).  The Bar, outside seating area, and inside restaurant are all quite nice.  They have specials almost every day - my favorite of course is the Thursday 1/2 price martini's!
