2021-10-16,5,Came here for an early breakfast with a friend. Really friendly service. The rose latte did not disappoint
2021-08-05,1,BARISTA REFUSED SERVICE!!!  Came here on a Thursday early morning to try their rose latte. The inside was sparse at most, with only 5 customers inside. The barista was totally ignorant of me when I was waiting at the front of the line. No eye exchange, no greeting, nothing . When I asked her what kind of pastry it was in the bakery at the counter in front of me, she rolled her eyes and said it's everything croissant. I still wanted to try the rose latte, so I proceeded with order it. Then she rolled her eyes again, saying "sorry, I can't do it." I was very puzzled and asked why. She said "too busy, can't do it." and then looked away. WTF? This is a cafe that is (1) famous for its rose latte, (2) not busy at all at the time I was there, and (3) I asked for sitting in the cafe instead of grabbing it to go, which should give the barista enough time to make the latte. You are not making rose petals in house!! Most of the ingredients are ready to go!! People in cafe started to look at my direction. I feel embarrassed, and then decided to leave. This is an EXTREMELY unpleasant experience. A cafe shop at a non-busy time refused to serve a signature drink to a customer, WTF???? I don't want to bring the fact that I'm a minority onto the table, even though I was the only non-white people at the cafe at that time. But at minimum baseline this is an extremely unpleasant & unprofessional experience!!!DO NOT recommend and WOULD NOT come back!!! Yikes!
2021-07-14,5,Coffee and pastries so good here! We stopped in and they were so friendly and wonderful service. Such a great spot in Hoboken!
2021-07-01,4,Another overpriced but omg,cute and shall I say, victorian, so not cute exactly, decor. Thankfully, not another hipster place. Indoor and outdoor seating. Very cozy. No loud crazy music. Just you and your thoughts, books there too and free wifi .
2021-06-17,5,Went here for the first time yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered an iced matcha latte with oat milk and a pump of vanilla, it was perfectly sweetened to my liking but still contained the strong matcha taste. My boyfriend got a flat white with whole milk that he loved so much we got an iced latte with almond milk to go! Quality coffee beans, friendly barista and quiet location with cute aesthetic. Will be my new go to place! Can't wait to return
2021-06-08,3,Went to this cafe really wanting to find another 'regular' spot in my neighborhood but unfortunately it missed the mark for me. I ordered the Rose Latte and the Avocado toast with Roasted Red Peppers and my friend ordered a coffee with the Spinach Kale Pie. My Rose Latte, while it looked absolutely gorgeous, was really just a mug of steamed milk with a rose flavor. Not sure what I was expecting, but it didn't hit the spot at all. The Avocado toast was just ok and the Spinach pie which I shared with my friend was soggy as if it had been warmed up in a microwave and had lost all its crispness and texture. Loved the beautiful presentation and the decor of the place, but don't know if I'm tempted to give it another try based on the cost versus the disappointing taste.Spinach Pies
2021-05-29,5,I love this coffee shop! The people who work here are always friendly and the drink sizes are substantial!
2021-05-23,3,This place was good but nothing amazing. Got the rose latte assuming it had espresso in it and was surprised that it didn't. $8 for just rose syrup and milk was a bit confusing. avocado toast was okay but also very overpriced. Ended up ordering a regular latte after that which was good. Best part about this place was the aesthetic. The entire place was very pretty and decorated wellgood for instagram pictures if that's what you're looking for. If you're going to come here I would definitely suggest just getting a regular coffee or latte. Food and other drinks arent worth it just for the aesthetic.
2021-04-09,5,My boyfriend and I stopped in here the other day to try their rose latte. We thought it looked beautiful.We each got one and tried the spinach and cheese croissant and the chocolate bread.Everything was delicious!!! The rose latte it $8, which is pricey so we won't get it often. It's very pleasing to look at. Smells delicious like roses. Comes with a cute little macaron.Regular latte is okay.They have almond milk which is always a plus!!The chocolate bread was soft and fresh. Not overly sweet. We would order it again.We wouldn't get the spinach and cheese one again since it was mushy. Flavor was nice however.We will definitely return!
2021-04-05,4,Cute little cafe tucked in the back corner of Hoboken. It has a classic coffee shop menu, and a sun drenched area to sit and sip. Lovely atmosphere and good vibes. It has quirky and classic cafe feels. A little pricey (think Starbucks prices- my hot chocolate was 5.50). It's a standard classic cafe in a residential part of the neighborhood.
2021-03-01,5,Very cute cafe. They are a family owned business and the owners were very nice. I had their famous rose latte and it was beautiful. It came with a French macaron.The inside of this cafe is very aesthetically pleasing.They have small bakery items and pastries.
2021-01-24,5,Found this gem after one of my photoshoots in Hoboken. The owner, Balsayat was the sweetest! So kind, friendly & welcoming. The overall aesthetic is sooo charming. I love the old record player and the artwork on the walls. I loved the choice of China and use of Mackenzie Child items as well! The Turks know their coffee and the latte I ordered was so bold and smooth I'd drive here for it any time! For more coffee shop reviews follow me on instagram at @caffeconamore_
2020-12-14,4,This spot is very aesthetically pleasing! Definitely is a great place to go for Instagram worthy shots. The prices are not too bad for their normal coffee and food! We got a chia tea latte, the Rose latte, macaroons, and cinnamon rolls. Everything we had was great!
2020-11-09,5,The aesthetics in here is unbelievable! You forget you are in a city when you're here. I came here and sat down for coffee with avocado toast for breakfast. I felt so relaxed and welcomed by the friendly staff. The Turkish coffee was so good and I love that they have dairy free options for milk. I also tried a small piece of baklava which was sweet and nutty. The avocado toast was just amazing- I loved every last bite! It had chickpeas on it which made it more filling. Definitely coming back!
2020-11-08,5,What a nice little place to have a lovely vintage like brunch.  The second we walked in, this place put us in a wonderful mood.  The vintage design is so nice, feels peaceful and makes you feel fancy.  The ladies who took our order were great, so welcoming and they were very nice to explain the menu to us.  We ordered a rose latte, Turkish coffee, avocado hummus toast and avocado pepper toast with a side of baklava and blueberry muffin.  My hummus avocado toast was delicious, so tasty, the rose latte omg AMAZING! The presentation was so beautiful I felt bad drinking the latte.  The blueberry muffin was soft and tasted like pound cake, I couldn't get enough of it.  My latte came with a piece of macaroon, perfect combination to be honest.  It's nice to find a place that is not crowded, staff make you feel at home and the food is just exactly as you expect it.  Definitely returning here!!
2020-10-05,5,This is a small cafe in Hoboken that's woman owned, minority owned and one that started in the middle of an ongoing pandemic so kudos to Balsayat (the owner) for making it work!The décor is charming, the cups beautiful and take you back to a Parisian café in a heartbeat. Café Vista is now my go-to for my daily dose of cappuccino and the delicious avocado toast. They also have a very beautiful rose latte that's a pink treat in a cup!  Everything is beautiful and thoughtfully done with a touch of grace.I enjoyed my Turkish coffee and piece of Baklava this week and also tried the banana bread which was delicious!Go try it, you won't be disappointed!Instagram: @MrsHoboken
2020-10-03,5,As soon as I walked in, this place put a huge smile on my face! The decor is gorgeous and airy ...and the women behind the counter greeted me with smiles. Ordered a cold brew with oat milk which was around $4. The coffee is pretty strong - which is great - and I ordered the baklava. So yummy! When I come back I might try the Turkish coffee. Overall a very solid coffee place... I will be back!
2020-10-02,5,The place is quaint and quiet on a quiet street: The inside is very neat and well kept and clean.The staff is very friendly and hospitable I got a coffee which was good. The baklava was absolutely delicious. I believe it had pistachio in it? Very tasty and the texture was perfect.I will definitely he going back and I do recommend trying their baklava.
2020-09-18,5,Everything yesssss! I live right around the corner and have been hoping for a good coffee shop that I can walk to without going into town. The inside is so cute and all the drinks and food are so fun and different!! I always get their latte with oat milk (the best I've ever had), and I also get their avocado hummus toast which is to DIE for! They also have some other unique food and baked goods. I got their coffee crumb cake once- yum! I definetly recommend you give this place a try!
2020-09-07,3,Attracted by their Instagram photos. It was indeed very pretty, nice decor, food is also good, very instagramable. But there were flies inside... should put more effort to keep the place clean...
2020-09-05,5,Excellent addition to west side Hoboken neighborhood! Great coffee, pastries, cookies and spinach pies. Two thumbs up, support new Hoboken small businesses
2020-08-29,5,Beautiful aesthetic, super friendly service, delicious food (their avo toast was very impressive). Had a great experience and will be back!
2020-08-27,5,Amazing spot. Great vibe, their Dalgona coffees, and almond croissants are a must try.
2020-08-25,5,Cafe Vista is one of the best coffee shops I've ever been to they have really good pastry's and the options on the menu such as the very berry tea are spectacular. Overall this place is amazing and look forward to getting drinks and pastries here in the future.
2020-08-21,5,So cute wit the decor and the pastries hit the spot just right! Go try them out and order the dalgona coffee
2020-07-30,5,FANTASTIC!!!!! Finally good coffee in Hoboken. You ask for Macchiato and you get a macchiato not a latte. Coffee is art and Vista cafe is the artist! So happy they opened by my house.
2020-07-30,5,What a great addition to Hoboken's west side!A delightful coffee shop with wonderful drink options and snacks and pastries. The owner and staff are so nice and provide a really welcoming atmosphere. The food and drinks are served in a beautiful  Mediterranean manner. LOVE it!!!
2020-07-13,5,the cutest coffee shop with beautiful aesthetics !  Great place to catch up with friends. Highly recommend the very berry iced tea :) best iced tea I've had!
2020-07-09,5,Tucked away in Hoboken, and it's awesome. Stumbled upon it coming back to town from quarantine and everyone is friendly, dedicated, and the menu/espresso is A+.
2020-07-03,5,So happy to have such a cute and delicious coffee shop in the neighborhood! The aesthetics are adorable and will make this the perfect spot to spend time catching up with friends, or studying while sipping some fantastic coffee! (When indoor seating opens up again that is) until then hey have great coffee to go and two outdoor tables for service!
2020-06-27,5,We're moving into the neighborhood and have been scouting out local shops in the area. When I read about Cafž Vista on Hobokengirl, I made a note to check it out on our next walk... only to find out it wasn't quite open yet! They were super sweet to offer us complimentary cold brews for making the trek. Can't wait to try out their menu - but until then, 5 stars for their service! Welcome neighbor!
