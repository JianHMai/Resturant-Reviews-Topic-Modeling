2021-10-28,1,Amanda's is not what it was years ago when it was on the "best restaurants in New Jersey " list.  The food was innovative, well prepared, served professionally and we felt like dining there was an experience and well worth it. The brunch was fantastic. We understand the constraints caused by Covid, but we won't be back. I'll keep my fond memories of the old Amanda's.
2021-10-27,5,Came here for brunch very home style their soups are delicious I had the carrot ginger soup amazing and Caesar salad. Can't go wrong here for brunch. They often have a live band playing. Inside of the restaurant is very homely almost feels like you are visiting friends or family while eating. You can also choose to be seated outside (weather permitting) ,... Bon appetite!Tip- very busy on the weekends may be a long wait for food so caution if you are hangry !! Lol
2021-10-17,5,Had a small party for daughter's baptism in a private room. They treated us like royalty despite only being a party of 8 for brunch. The food has never disappointed, nor has the service. Amanda's is an every and any occasion stop for an excellent dining experience!
2021-09-19,5,Food was delicious, I recommend the chicken ravioli, the sauce is well balanced and cooked to perfection. The mussels is another recommended choice under appetizers and goes well with wine, perfect balance that compliment each other. Friendly staff and owners!
2021-08-10,4,This review is only on ambiance and desserts. We stopped in here and was pleasantly surprised by how pleasant it is. The dessert was delicious and I look forward to coming in for dinner. It's a large beautiful restaurant and on Saturday they had live music.
2021-07-25,3,Unfortunately after recently returning to the restaurant I was disappointed. We ordered the muscles and empanadas to start off with. The empanadas were dry and didn't really stand out to me. The muscles and red sauce were good. For entrees I ordered a medium rare sirloin which was served mostly well done. It was dry and flavorless. I did not complain about it to the waitress because we had a late reservation for 9 and the restaurant was closing at 10. My mom ordered the salmon which was also over cooked. I will say that the service here is still good but the quality of the has gotten significantly worse. This is experience was off putting after the last time I came here and don't think I want to return.
2021-07-14,1,I actually wanted to like this place since it was really nice inside, they have an outdoor patio which was really cool. The drinks were okay and I ordered a Focaccia that came with prosciutto. And I just have to say I was extremely disappointed at $16 we were served dry bread and prosciutto. I'm not even Italian and I was offended that they even called that Focaccia. The spaghetti Bolognese was horrible. It had no flavor and tasted like I was given canned meat sauce on top of ramen noodles.
2021-06-26,5,We came here for brunch and had a wonderful time. The staff was attentive, the food was delicious and they had live music. A must visit.
2021-06-25,4,See 2 below under Mike B. It's my review and they put it under my husbands name who doesn't have a Yelp account! We had a most lovely time with great service and attitudes. Potato croquettes and short ribs were fantastic. Thanks again!
2021-06-25,4,Had a wonderful 30th Birthday celebration for our daughter Molly last night. Very neat indoor/outdoor feeling almost like being in someone's home in New Orleans. Friends called ahead to order champagne as a surprise. Julie was most accommodating. Juan the owner was charming and has a long history at the restaurant. I loved my short ribs as previous diners had recommended. Capped off our evening with a quick dance with their trio on the outside patio. Thanks for a special evening! By Susan B
2021-06-14,3,We not really enjoy our meals at Amanda's but as of recent the quality has been a bit off. My husband will no longer have the chicken parm as they seemed to have switched to a low quality chicken. Instead try the eggplant parm and get an order of Kenna and it's really good. Cocktails from the bar are always good especially the manhattans up.
2021-05-29,4,Came here on a Friday night: our first indoor dining experience since COVID. The restaurant is still beautiful like somebody's home. There was live music which was lovely. Drinks were excellent: the mango margarita and pomplemouse old fashion were expertly made. The wines by the glass are also good. We had appetizers of empanadas and mussels. The mussels are amazing, the sauce should be bottled. For mains we had the spaghetti bolognese, chicken thighs and Argentinian sausage. All very good. We ended the meal with the dolce de leche pie which was yummy. Will be back again.
2021-05-15,5,Came here for a celebratory dinner on a Wednesday night. I made a reservation for 7:30 but arrived at 7:15 and was able to be seated in a pretty empty restaurant. I believe there were only 2 other tables filled. The hostess (who was also our waiter) was extremely nice and let us pick our table. We chose this really cute 2 person table that was on a little balcony at the back of the restaurant. It was a little cold so we ended up moving tables to one inside and the waiter even offered to turn the heat of for us which was really nice. One of the highlights of the evening was the live music! There was a keyboard player and a tenor saxophonist. The music was soft enough so that even though we were sitting nearby, we could still hear each other talk. It made for a really romantic evening!What to order- we ordered the mussels for an app and were not disappointed!!! These are a must get. Comes with two crusty pieces of bread but a Bonus tip is to order their focaccia to dip into the the delicious broth!My boyfriend ordered the special of the day which was a filet mignon which he enjoyed (was about $34). I ordered the Caesar salad which is more like an appetizer portion and was nothing spectacular. You can add shrimp or chicken for 9$. I also got the soup of the day which was a cream of tomato which sort of tasted from a can and was not hot enough. This is not our first time to Amanda's and while I didn't love the taste all of the items I ordered this trip I am giving 5 stars because I have had many great meals here in the past, the service is friendly, the live music was a great plus, the ambiance is classy and the prices are extremely reasonable.
2021-05-12,5,what a unique and delicious place! Quality wine at a unreal price, with a delicious menu. The foccacia bread is a MUST and the pasta is cooked very well. A bunch of different dining rooms with an antique vibe (live jazz music on the weekend), this is great for a date night! will be back to try more!
2021-05-10,5,The new menu that they started during Covid is AMAZING! The empanadas are always a favorite, I have to have them every time I go! Also the chicken cutlet napolitana is so delicious, the sauce it just like your grandma made! Everything is reasonably priced and amazing quality! Would highly recommend to anyone!
2021-05-05,5,Had our engagement dinner here and the food was top notch and the service was impeccable! We were in a private room but I really appreciated how all the tables were well separated (covid protocol) for all the other guests in the restaurants. Would highly recommend this place!
2021-04-14,5,Oh my God this place was absolutely amazing. 5/5 stars!!!!! I'm amazed and would come back 372617 more times! If you haven't been here, what are you waiting for? Delish!
2021-03-14,5,We went for brunch. Amazing pancakes! The sausage side was great! The manager seated us quickly and there was great service from there on out. This place is underrated!!
2021-02-17,5,We were supposed to go Friday. I appreciate the notification and support the decision in shutting down and keeping everyone safe.
2021-02-15,5,Amanda's was EXCELLENT. We went last night on Valentine's Day and the experience couldn't be better. Our waitress Mel was attentive and fast, the entire wait and bus staff were quick to get us anything we need and were overall so friendly. The food was amazing, we started out with the special which was salmon tatare and it was amazing, it came with three crispy rice chips and had an amazing chipotle mayo sauce. We also ordered Brussels sprouts that came with pancetta or bacon or some sort they were good. The main courses are the real crowd pleasers. I got the filet mignon special sitting on mashed sweet potatoes and string beans with crispy onion on top. It was cooked to PERFECTION (medium rare) my boyfriend got the short rib that iS on the menu and the meat was so perfect it fell as soon as you put your fork down it was soooo good. The short rib sat on mashed potatoes with mushrooms and an amazing sauce as well. We accompanied our dinner with a bottle of wine. Overall the wine list was more than decent in terms of pricing our  bottle was 28 dollars which is definitely one of the lowest prices we've seen  in Hoboken. Wish we had room for dessert. We also sat right in front of the lovely live music that they have every day, whether it's vday or a week dinner or even the pickup options they give you you do not want to miss out on this place!!
2021-02-13,1,If I could have given 0 stars I would have. I was supposed to have a nice dinner tonight with my husband. I called two weeks ago to make the reservation and they never put it in the books. Now we can't get in anywhere because it is Valentine's weekend and our evening is ruined. This is the second time this has happened at this restaurant. I spoke with two people on the phone and neither of them tried to make good on the mistake. It was very oh well, sorry, goodbye. Make sure you confirm your reservation here more than once if you care to eat at the establishment.
2021-02-04,5,I came here on an anniversary date with my boyfriend we had such an amazing time. This place was beautiful and the ambiance was great. We were greeted by awesome staff from the entrance and walked to our table. Our waitress was so sweet you could tell she was doing a lot and running around but always checked on us and asked us if we were celebrating anything the food was honestly so amazing. They have a full bar my boyfriend got a cocktail and I got a local beer on draft. The beer was awesome and I love that they support local breweries. They had live music and everyone as very covid safe. The band was wearing masks and so was all the staff. The tables were distant and I felt very safe being there. The food was amazing and when they brought us out the dessert it was sweet that it said happy anniversary I would definitely recommend for a get dressed up girls night out or a date night. Thanks for the amazing experience guys I will definitely be coming again.
2020-12-21,4,Stumbled upon this place that accommodated a large table for me last minute. First impressions very cozy old building with a lot of charm. The menu was small just like it should be. I ordered the pork chop and it was amazing accompanied by whit beans and a side of Brussels sprouts. The rest of the table ordered a variety of different dishes from the menu they all loved it.The service is outstanding from the server to the manager all very friendly and accommodating
2020-12-01,5,Outstanding experience with the taste and flavors of the food and very nice and kind and caring service. Totally wasn't expecting it to be so good but was very pleasantly surprised.
2020-11-20,1,Ordered chicken cutlet napolitano and the meat felt very stale and just reheated.  It was 25$ and they dint do anything to compensate for the meal which was uneaten
2020-11-17,3,Four of us came here last Saturday night to sit outside for a nice early dinner with some drinks and music. Unfortunately, the music was all inside this night and apparently so was the service. We came here once before the pandemic and now this time, what a difference. Both my water glass and wine glass had considerable amounts of lipstick on them. My server and possibly a busboy were very timid and hardly filled up water or had any suggestions. The food was nothing more than we would have at home. The desserts were delicious and the chimichurri was very freshly made. But my chicken turned out to be a chicken parm with a paper thin slice of prosciutto on it and not very flavorful at all. If you look this restaurant up on any listings in Hoboken it will be among  your very top choices. My night and company tends to disagree. Our dessert utensils were thrown on top of the menu after finishing our entrees. Our entree plates also still remained on the table until we actually left. Not sure what's up with this service. Pretty disappointing all in all. Front of the house was very young in age and seemingly non-existent.Three stars on here is an absolute blessing.
2020-11-06,2,Let me start off by saying we are huge fans of Amanda's. We have been here perhaps 15 times over the last 10 years, maybe more. We've been to a half dozen wine dinners, two Bastille Day celebrations and many just wonderful regular dinners. I even held a surprise 50th birthday celebration for my partner at Amanda's, and the ~40-50 attendees all loved it. We had dinner at Amanda's this past weekend and it is the worst meal we have had in the last 5 years (and we eat out often). Between the two of us, we had one entree, two or three appetizers, a couple of sides and the focaccia. One appetizer was decent and all the rest ranged from subpar to bad. My partner had the chicken, and she felt it was much worse than what you would get in an average pizzeria. Our basic test in a restaurant is that the food should taste better than what we cook at home (or else why are we going out?). By that standard, most of the dishes failed. The foccacia (three modest size pieces) was particularly mediocre and certainly not worth $7.We drink a lot of wine and enjoy it, but are not snobby about it. We chose one of the French wines off the menu, and that was also pretty bad. My partner did the initial tasting and thought it was off, basically tasting like raisins. I should have listened to her but thought it would be OK. We made it half way through and then gave up. We each got a separate glass of wine and each of those was fair (but not particularly good).The service was equally lackluster. When we needed the waiter, he was nowhere to be seen. When we sent the wine back, he had the bartender taste and said that they said it was fine. When the bill came, my partner noticed that the wine was on the check and asked about it. The waiter got very defensive and said that we drank half the bottle (which is true) and that he did not charge us for one of the other glasses of wine. We would have been completely fine with that solution had he come to us and offered it as a suggestion, as we are always willing to try to work out something fair. Then he came back two minutes later and with even more attitude, told us he had taken the bottle of wine off. For someone in the "service industry", this was a great example of how not to act. It would have been so easy for him to end the night on a good note, and instead he sealed in the opposite.The meal bothered us so much that I was going to call the manager the next day to voice my concerns. The Amanda's we know and love is capable of so much better, in all areas. Reading some of the other reviews, I saw that we are not the only one who has had a bad to mediocre experience, and I figured that my phone call would fall on deaf ears. Amanda's, come back please. We want to be fans again. We will give it one more try after a few months and if bad, that will be it. There are too many good restaurants in Hoboken and elsewhere.
2020-10-25,3,Amanda! What happened during quarantine? Girl we have ALL been stressed, but keep doing what you do best! I say this because this is my second time visiting Amanda's, which is somewhat of an iconic establishment in Hoboken. Search "best restaurants in Hoboken" upon your arrival, and yer girl made the list every time. Our first visit here (pre-COVID with friends) was absolutely delicious. Service was great, and we definitely did not remember such small portion sizes. That was then and this is now it seems.Firstly, Amanda's is now open with indoor dining but the staff has created an open flow situation where all windows and doors are down and you're basically dining outside even when inside, so bring two jackets. We were pretty cold the entire time. Not Waitress though, she wore a tee, zipping through the brisk Fall night and forgetting to bring me my second beverage, waters for the table for the majority of our meal (a different waitress actually realized we were still water-less 1/3 of the way through our entrees, aka we would be done within 60 seconds because of their small size), and the Brussel sprouts that I forgot to order. But TO BE FAIR, Waitress, recommend that we order a side since you KNOW these portions are smaller. We ended up needing the coconut flan and chocolate ice cream for dessert, plus espressos to warm us up. The drinks/food itself were lacking that signature spark that Amanda was known for. I give her her third star solely because of her iconicism. We all agreed that Future Husband's pasta "tasted homemade," but that shouldn't be anyone's reaction to homemade pasta in NJ. My salmon? Good, but both the spinach rice it came on and my tequila soda were pretty bland. The empanadas were the best part of the meal - and the coconut flan - so it's good that Amanda advertises her empanadas so high up on the menu. James's pork chop was the only dish of substantial size. This is not to say that our meal wasn't satisfactory, because it totally was. The red Cab ordered was yummy and the price wasn't hiked up too high and the Sambuca came with all three beans, but I just am missing the 4th star that I know Amanda is capable of earning.When the bill came, we did acknowledge the fact that the total felt overpriced in comparison to what you are getting / how much you are getting for that same price at other restaurants in Hoboken. I do have faith Amanda will find her mojo, and would still come back to see her when she regains her fourth star.
2020-10-21,3,The venue has a really cute atmosphere. There were only 2 other tables on a Sunday evening which surprised me as the reviews here seem pretty solid. Ordered their most expensive white wine which was only $48 for a Sancerre. Ordered the mussels appetizer which was good. The server said we needed to order bread for $7 to dip in the mussel's white wine sauce so I said sure. When the mussels came out, it already had its own bread so the girl server was totally leading us on. since we already told her our entrees first she knew we ordered more than enough food and didn't need the bread. It was 3 pieces of Focaccia that was obviously old as the middle was stale and hard. The menu was an odd mix of Argentinian, Italian, and steak and potatoes. It was REALLY difficult to decide what would go well together. We ordered the steak, chimichurri grilled chicken, mashed potatoes, garlic spinach, and mushrooms. All of the food was good but average; definitely nothing to rave about. The dulce de leche cake for desert was awesome. The bill came to $156 and some change. I ALWAYS tip the standard 20% which would have been about $31. It took 15 minutes to get the server's attention and I placed 2 $100 bills in the bill folio. When she came back I said were ready and I'd like a little change. She opened the sleeve saw what was there then scoffed at me that do I really need change then mumbled something under her breath while walking away. 10 minutes later she return with 2 $20s and a few singles then says that all of my change is there counting even the pennies in a very condescending tone. Then stormed off. Now I'm stuck with 2 $20s and I just wanted to give her the $31 and leave at that point. Another 10 minutes pass and I tell her I need change of one of the $20s. She seemed extremely aggravated and inconvenienced and even stated that she didn't know if she could even get me change. When she returned she literally threw the money on the table and stormed off again.I also asked her for a "to go" bag a few times which she never brought. After waiting another 7-8 minutes I was finally able to get one from another staff member.... mind you there are only 3 tables of people in the entire restaurant and several staff.Aggravated to the max at this point I  returned to take back my tip to her. I actually left $33 then took $30 of it back. I shouldn't have even left the $3! This is the first time in my life I've been driven to do such a thing! She should look for a job in another field because her customer service is in the basement. Don't work in the service industry if someone pleasantly asking for change is an inconvenience!
2020-10-04,4,Location and environment were excellent, both inside and outside. Great service. The food was also great. The roasted chicken breast was our favorite and we look forward to trying the beef next. Mussels and empanadas were also very good.
2020-10-01,5,New owners and menu = fantastic! Came here for dinner and sat outside, on a beautiful balcony. The service was outstanding, speedy and attentive. The food felt like it was homemade - fresh, delicious and the portions are on the bigger side for tapas. Can't wait to come back!
2020-09-12,4,Amanda's has a very nice outdoor dining setup with a live jazz band! The atmosphere was very nice and the service was great. The food was good- we got multiple appetizers and entrees to share between two people and everything was very tasty.
2020-08-29,5,Amanda's made our impromptu wedding anniversary celebration a most memorable one! We stopped to look at the menu when we saw that they had a guitarist playing. He was quite good, and the music created a vibe that is only reserved for summer nights. The current outdoor dining menu had an Argentinian slant to it, and we wanted to give it a try. We were seated right away, and the service was impeccable. The empanadas were terrific as was the eggplant parm, the sausage and various other items we tried. These were considered small plates but in my opinion the portions were quite generous. The wine was also great and you could purchase a wide assortment of bottles to bring home from their own wine store for less. Upon learning it was our anniversary we were brought a most delicious coconut flan at the end of the night. Even if that had not happened, it was truly a lovely culinary experience and a welcomed escape from reality for a few hours. Looking forward to coming back.
2020-08-29,4,Had a very pleasant impromptu meal at Amanda's last weekend. I was walking around downtown with my friend and her dog and we wanted to sit down somewhere where the pups and us could quench our thirst. It was a very hot day. Amanda's looked cute and wasn't crowded and I remembered reading that it's a place to go in Hoboken girl so I figured we'd give it a try. I didn't realize that they weren't open yet (it was about 440 and I think they open at 5). They were so kind and ready to get started so they seated us and the live piano player started playing as well. The waitress recommended the empanadas so we tried them and they were good! So we ordered the gnocchi and salmon to share as well. It was all tasty and well made. The spritzes were a little sweet for my taste (I should have known). And they refilled our waters several times and brought out two bowls for the dogs. I always appreciate the little touches that actually makes you feel like that care. I'll be back to try brunch. The waitress was good about keeping her mask on and the outdoor seating is nice and spread out which is definitely appreciated. The fake grass is nice for the dogs to lie down on. Overall great experience.
2020-08-08,5,My first trip to Amanda's most definitely will not be my last!! What an incredible night from service to sweets. We started with two beautiful, perfectly executed, slightly dry martinis. The beef empanadas with the chimichurri was a delicious start and the favorite (we should have ordered all beef but we tried pork, spinach and beef empanadas). For dinner also ordered the incredible pork shoulder (tender, rich, moist) and steak (cooked perfectly and accompanied by MORE chimichurri). Our server, the talented Ms. Mo, was delightful. She anticipated our needs, checked in often enough without interrupting our conversation. Just a completely lovely experience.
2020-06-26,4,We liked it here a lot. We had a few different dishes with fish, pasta, & meat. We liked them all. Wicked cute environment too!
2020-03-10,1,Disappointing and overpriced. We followed yelp reviews and thought this would be decent choice for my wife's birthday dinner out with the family. Big mistake. Waaaaayyyyy overpriced ....whole lobster, oven roasted - this was about a 8 oz lobster (entire thing not just tail) with barely three bites of lobster meat inside tail and the claws were empty for $41, both my wife and daughter ordered. The appetizer lobster dumplings, $21 for a set of 5 and they were about 1-inch long each - my wife gets these from Costco for about $15 for 20 in a bag. NY strip steak bone-in, cooked perfectly but this was not a restaurant grade cut - more like a supermarket steak, very tough. No salads ....and oh, they don't serve soda...but rather juice in a 4 oz glass for $4 each.  So for 6 people with 2 appetizers for table, 6 entres, 1 glass wine and 2 beers, 4 juices...the bill was over $300. Not to speak of the fact our waiter was a sour-puss who didn't even know what to recommend. My suggestion, go somewhere else. We would never return to this place. I have no problem paying for good food, good service . . . we didn't get either.
2020-03-04,5,Came here for my birthday dinner with my parents a few weeks back and it did not disappoint. The beef tartare, prawns, and lobster dumplings were all delicious and flavorful. My mom loved her pork chop, and my dad and I also enjoyed our short ribs and steak. The restaurant's ambiance is super cozy and is really great for a special occasion or even date night. Service was excellent and the owner came over and spoke to us for quite some time; he was lovely and a pleasure to speak to. We will definitely be back!
2020-02-29,5,I was looking for a good place to have brunch for my birthday with my friends and Amanda's Restaurant did not disappoint. From the service to the food everything was perfect! Our server Amanda was nothing short of personable. She constantly checked on us and made sure everything was enjoyable. She made us feel like we were at home!
2020-02-25,1,sat us in a windowless basement next to the bathroom while place was empty...service was awful...food was worse...drinks were slow...priced like your getting a good meal, your not
2020-02-22,5,We moved to the area from Manhattan last year and have been reasonably impressed with some of the recommendations our friends gave us but this place was great. Excellent flavor profiles with very well executed dishes and great service.Will definitely be back.
2020-02-18,2,My wife and I have lived in Hoboken for 6 years and have tried almost every restaurant in town but not Amanda's so we decided to go there this past Saturday to celebrate Valentine's day as I was traveling for work on Friday.The ambiance was great. It's dimly lit, warm and cozy. But our overall experience would not entice me to recommend Amanda's to anyone or go back a second time. It's more on the expensive side and I didn't feel as if it was money well spent...espcially for an important event. Maybe I had higher expectations...When we were sat, the restaurant was busy and our server was clearly very busy. Running around like crazy from table to table and seemed very overwhelmed. This interfered with his ability to provide us with a personal experience and he was very short and unfriendly with us.Our whole process felt rushed, almost like I was at a Friday's where they are more concerned with table quantity than quality. Our appetizer came out before our drinks and the appetizer was lukewarm. Before we can even enjoy our drinks and have some conversation our entrees were delivered. It felt as if we were sitting for only 15 minutes and already had our entrees in front of us. As mentioned, a very rushed experience. It made me wonder...does the server want to go home or are we getting someone else's order that they sent back? How could they have our entrees out when we only ordered 5 minutes ago?My chicken was dry (as if were sitting under a heat lamp) the mashed potatoes were cold and neither mine or my wife's entrees were piping hot as they should be.I'd be careful going here for a special event or if you want to have a special experience. There are plenty of other restaurants in Hoboken at this price point that will do a much better job.
2020-02-16,5,The menu is incredible! The specials are always tempting as well. Atmosphere is terrific, nice bar but very small. Service is always solid and super friendly. One of the best restaurants in Hoboken.
2020-01-07,2,Christmas Eve looking for a special dinner. My 85-year-old dad booked this place for his six kids and other family members including five or six grandchildren. We have a square of tables in the basement. Food was plus/minus. Some of it good some of it not so good. Service was lacking. Ambience quite nice. Unfortunately the bill presented was incorrect. They charged adult prices ie $65 a plate for children's meals (buttered pasta ) this led my 85-year-old dad to create a scene in a restaurant for the first time in his entire life. Very disappointing. I believe my father and the manager came to some sort of agreement but feel compelled to let people know: if you are arranging a group dinner make sure you make the agreement before hand and get it in writing.  Please note: this was not about the money it was about being honest and reasonable about charging for potential lifetime customers in the New York New Jersey area.
2020-01-03,3,I loved Amanda's for the last 8 years and enjoyed everything there from decors, service, and especially food every time we were there. From romantic dinners with my wife to a few large parties we hosted there over the years. Today, whoever, while the atmosphere and service were as always five stars, the food were less then one star. I can't even find a word to compare it to. I felt as the chef took a day off and a dishwasher was stuck putting out the dishes. Starting with stale buns, and what should have been whipped butter, but felt like crystalized fat. For appetizer, the Salomon Tartare was the worst I ever tasted. I newer thought you can screw up Salomon Tartare, until today, as it was drenched in Tabasco sauce. And for main course the Fish Ragu, was like something out of a nightmare. Potatoes undercooked, muscles overcooked, sauce stale flavor, and a peace of bread on top with some  fatty mayo/butter spread made me nauseated just after a few bites. For desert I took sherbet. And while lemon and berry was good, the coconut flavor still makes my stomach turn an hour later. My wife's meal has not been much better... I will let her leave her own review if she has a stomach for that. Hoboken is all about food. Amanda's was one of the best restaurants in this iconic town. So what happened?
2019-12-09,3,Beautiful restaurant! Great service. We got a lovely table in the corner. The short rib over gnocchi was out of this world with a delish creamy sauce topped with crunchy potato chip garnish. I had to stop myself from finishing the gnocchi to reduce my carb intake. My friend ordered the soup of the day to start which was also yummy and rich, just the way it like it. The steak with chimichurri sauce was good too. Hoboken is worse than nyc for parking so do not visit unless you live here. There is no street parking without resident permit. Validated garage parking is $8 for 3 hrs. Since we stayed longer we paid another $20. So parking = price of my entree. Say what?
2019-12-08,5,Had a Delicious Dinner tonight with my family . Juan and Julie the owners are amazing they really take pride in there business . There atmosphere is so quaint and decorated beautifully for Christmas . My husband had short ribs they were amazing and I had the lamb chops perfect. The server was so great and friendly . Thanks Juan and Julie had a great night
2019-11-29,1,So few restaurants open for Thanksgiving Day in Hudson County, decided to give Amanda's a try. Unique Victorian theme venue housed within two brownstones with eclectic table dinnerware and that's where the accolades end.  Realized it was a holiday and restaurants that are open for holidays tend not to put their best foot forward as they do during normal schedule but this establishment is nothing more than the typical "Hoboken Hype" place to be seen.  Quality of food is merely an after thought. Introduction to the meal - dinner rolls that were stale and rancid tasting.  Salad that was featured had no dressing, limp, and tasted like it came from a ready made bag that you might buy in a supermarket. Needless to say, going beyond this the rest of the meal followed suit.  Three person tab, fixed menu and two inadequate filled house wines was not anywhere worth the $250.00.  In summary, my suggestion - take a cab or the path and arrive in NYC and seek out numerous restaurants for the same amount and enjoy fresh prepared quality food. Never, Never, Never - AGAIN!
2019-11-04,3,Though the food and service are pretty good at Amanda's, their TOTAL lack of any changing stations (in men's or women's) is striking in 2019.I have held events and large dinner parties there and I've had to balance my baby on my lap or put her on the floor to change her.It's 2019, this shouldn't be the case. ESPECIALLY in a family-friendly neighborhood and restaurant that is always packed with kids.Come on, Amanda's, get it together.
2019-10-12,5,Good food l, good atmosphere, I feel reasonable prices. I really had a lot of fun because I was able to drink like crazy. They have the ability to have some good wines. But the food is truly cook and artists  3.5 star and 4 star atmosphere by higher standards but a 5 star for yelp.
2019-09-26,4,This is a great place for a special night out, an event, or just because. Its got a great atmosphere and the decor is super cozy, bigger than it looks from the outside. Its fancy, but as long as you are dressed decently it doesn't matter.The service here is excellent, and my personal favorite is going for the early dinner. You get a lot of food for not too much money, almost better than cooking for yourself! They're always willing to suggest a wine to go with your meal too.
2019-09-15,5,We ate at Amanda's tonight and celebrated three birthdays and our 35th anniversary. The dinner and service was truly first class. There were five of us and we all give rave reviews. Beautiful roasted endive salad. We each got different dishes. Branzino, pasta, short rib, and duck breast were all excellent. The hickory smoked pork chop was probably the best pork chop I ever had in my life. Desserts were awesome too. The owner Juan could not have been nicer, and our servers were all very accommodating. Great evening. Can't wait to go back.Dr. Mark and Maggie Docktor
2019-08-25,5,Very good; service and food was exceptional!  Nice old fashioned and classy decor. Will definitely revisit! Great brunch spot.
2019-08-17,5,Hands down the best Benedicts I've tried in a while. It feels a bit like a fancy place but they don't have a strict dress code, which is great.
2019-08-11,4,Food is great, service is great, my only criticism is the portions are just a little small, i am a big eater though. My date was full and loves it there, will def go back.
2019-08-04,5,Amazing Brunch and beautiful ambiance! Such a unique place old school taste to it. The food is amazing to boot! The steak and eggs is just simply divine!
2019-07-29,5,My daughter had her bridal shower at Amanda's yesterday! The food and service were both fantastic! The manager and server were so attentive and nothing was too much trouble. All three brunch menu items were delicious! Just a note. . . with a bit of assistance, it is possible to bring a wheelchair into Amanda's.
2019-07-28,4,This is a really great place and really welcoming place. The owner is all over his staff the make sure they are taking care of the customers. They sure do. They served decisions (i really mean it) bread basket and offer variety of options for brunch. The price very reasonable and the setting is really gorgeous. Old traditional setting with modern menu and perfect service. Worth the price.I will be back!!!IT IS 4.5 STARS.
2019-07-28,5,Amanda's has been on my to do list for a while. I decided to try it during restaurant week. First of all, I had no clue that the place was that big inside. There's a cute little seating area by the bar (which is small and quaint) where you can wait for your table and have a drink. The decor was very nice, classic and classy style. The greeting staff was very friendly and sat us promptly. The food was amazing. The portions were just enough to feel satisfied without our being overly stuffed. I had the lamb as my meal which was flavorful and tender. Do yourself a favor and have the duck fat potatoes... so good! The regular menu was very intriguing. Everything on the menu looked amazing and at a reasonable price for a place with such classy decor. I appreciate that they had wine bottles discounted for restaurant week. I've never seen a place do that. Overall, I was very pleased with the staff, the ambiance, the food, and the decor. I would definitely come back to try some of the other items on the menu. This place is definitely a good date night spot to impress your love.
2019-07-13,5,Had a delightful dinner with the help of the perfect waiter Jose.  Ordering from the Early Dinner Menu.  Started my meal with the Creamy Polenta with a luscious smoked cheddar fondue.  The entree I chose was the Pan Seared Hake over sautéed kale and fennel.  Then to finish I chose the Flourless Chocolate Cake which was served warm with a rich vanilla ice cream on top.  Will definitely return.
2019-07-11,5,Took my mother here for her birthday with a few family members and we were very impressed! The decor, vibe, and window side view were beautiful. The Early Dinner Special at $22 per person included a first course, entrée, and dessert, AMAZING! Perfect opportunity to impress you dinner guests and try new foods that are visually appealing as well as tasty! I will definitely be back again and again...and again.
2019-07-02,5,Outstanding restaurant. Cozy, relaxed, so many great food choices. Went here on a dinner date and was so impressed by our waitress who was absolutely amazing and kind. Our food was phenomenal. The architecture and decor so beautiful and welcoming. Deserts were delicious and the had my favorite Italian after dinner digestivo, Averna
2019-07-01,4,We went here for Sunday dinner. The ambience is good for special occasions. We had flat bread and lemon truffle potato chips for appetizer. For the main course, we had heritage chicken and chestnut agnolotti pasta.The portions are small, but the food was tasty overall.
2019-06-24,4,Enjoyed a delicious brunch at Amanda's in Hoboken. The mimosas had a good ratio of champagne to orange juice (too many places give mostly juice!) For my meal I got the bratwurst sandwich which came with home fries and a side salad. I was a little nervous about the Korean chili aioli, but I decided to trust that the chefs knew what they were doing and that the flavors would work well together, and I'm glad I did! The aioli had only a slight spice and wasn't overpowering. My friends got the Lumberjack Omelette, Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict, and Jonah Crab Cake, and everyone enjoyed their food. The salmon is smoked in-house, and the crab cake had a good crab meat to filler ratio. The only complaint was that one of the two eggs on the eggs benedict was over cooked and came out hard boiled rather than poached. We alerted our server who quickly brought over a new poached egg with fresh hollandaise sauce, so all was well!
2019-06-06,5,My family and I celebrate all special occasions here. A delightful vegan menu, lovely wait-staff, incredible ambience, rich and flavorful food, and wonderful multi-course meal deals. If you ever have a problem, the manager addresses it with supreme professionalism, talent, and knowledge. I can not recommend this restaurant enough.
2019-05-22,2,We went to Amanda's recently for a celebratory dinner.  Our server was extremely busy and forgot a requested item for almost 1 hour despite that he was amazing. The hostess was incredible and the other staff we encountered.I ordered lobster which was baked with topping on the tail. I had a portion of the crusted tail. However, when I cracked the claws they smelled like ammonia and were dry. I brought this fact to my server's attention and he advised the dining room manager. The manager approached the table very defensive without actually listening to my observation. He was in complete denial as he stated that the lobsters came in earlier that morning. This really made my experience a negative one. I am a trained chef and have worked at seafood restaurants from fast pace kitchens to Michelin Star restaurants. I mentioned that I do NOT want another lobster so please just take the bad one away. After insulting me for eating a portion of the tail, he left. After about 20 minutes he came back to the table with a fresh uncooked lobster to show that their lobsters are fresh and the one I got which smelled like ammonia wasn't bad. Even though I mentioned I didn't want the lobster anymore. He still insisted and had the kitchen prepare another. After organizing this lovely evening with a group of professionals I didn't think we would be insulted at the table for being served bad food and acknowledging this fact.Another guest sent back a mussel dish and yet another, an undercooked pasta. Based on the reviews of 4 stars at this restaurant I never imagined this experience.The manager needs training on how to approach and handle situations in a way that is respectful and professional. Without being condescending and pushy!
2019-05-01,5,Superb atmosphere, exceptional service and simply amazing food! We could not think of a single thing that we didn't love. We took the light rail to 9th so we wouldn't have to drive. It was a nice walk and a perfect place.
2019-04-04,5,I just had a amazing dinner here at Amanda's with a few coworkers. The service was phenomenal, Eric was our server omg the lobster dumplings MUST TRY!!!! Please dont leave with out trying the La Vie en Rouge Cocktail. This place is great for groups, datenight or just a nice cocktail. I Love this place.
2019-03-15,4,Went to Amanda's years ago and I must say it's still pretty amazing .. the service and ambience is on point .. great for a date night ... I really enjoyed the food .. and hopefully will visit when I'm in Hoboken again .
2019-03-15,3,I would give this place 2 1/2 stars, but not an option.  We moved to Hoboken last year and we live close to Amanda's and had wanted to give it a try.  We went for a celebratory dinner last weekend and were frankly disappointed.  We walked in and let the gentleman know we had a reservation and he barked back, "name?" and in an annoyed tone.  They showed us to one table and then moved us to another.  Someone came over and handed us menus and water and then left - we were surprised he was actually our waiter as there was no hello or welcome or anything - he came back and asked if were ready.  We order octopus appetizer - pricey and not great.  We ordered sea bass and steak - both mediocre at best.  Bread a little tough too. Good points:  drinks were really good and it is a nice atmosphere; unfortunately, for the money spent, it was not worth it and the food was again, mediocre.  A lot of people there, so not sure if it was a really off night, but probably won't try it again.
2019-03-03,1,bad customer service. they dont care about every client just larger group of clients. not recommend for busy hour meals.
2019-02-16,4,My husband and I just celebrated our belated Valentines Day at Amanda's.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and we plan to come back again soon.Now on to the specifics - Amanda's interior is very nice, built in an old brownstone with a quaint and charming vibe.  They have a few different sectioned off dining rooms, the front ones with bay window seating, and the back one facing a garden patio.  The food was spectacular.  Everything we ordered was delicious - the octopus appetizer, pumpkin ravioli, NJ scallops, and the lamp chops.  Prices were fairly decent given the quality.  Note that the portions here are on the smaller end.  They also have a $25 corkage fee which we took advantage of since it was a special evening and nothing on the wine list looked interesting.The only real complaint we had about our experience was regarding the service.  It was on the slower side (which normally I could deal with), but our server also kept forgetting things that we had asked for (seltzer, bread, an extra side that we ordered).  It got a bit annoying towards the end of the meal because we sat their wondering if we needed to keep reminding her of things since as I said the service was on the slower side. Despite the poor service we do plan to come back.
2019-02-12,5,Amanda's restaurant in Hoboken is everything! I had dinner with a few people here last night and it was a top-notch experience. My entrée was a beef short rib and gnocchi dish with a truffle sauce. The short rib was cooked to perfection! The flavors of this dish meshed together so well, I would eat this again tonight if I could. Everyone loved their entree and they have excellent cocktails here too from prior experience. I have been to Amanda's in the past and is always great food, great service, great ambience. They do have an early bird special that I would also recommend if you can get there at that time. It is walking distance from public transportation in town. I highly recommend Amanda as restaurant, excellent overall experience here!
2019-02-04,4,Made a reservation for a party of 10 and we ended up sitting in a private room. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, a mix between a formal dining room and a bar. We all noticed how beautiful the plates they had displayed on the table were. We split the sausage, foccacia, and charcuterie board for the table and everything was delicious. The charcuterie board came with some home made pickles that were awesome. The foccacia bread came with homemade ricotta that was amazing. Everything was gone within minutes because everything was so good!The restaurant was very flexible and patient with our group. We had a couple of people that arrived late and put in their entree orders late. However, the restaurant had all of the entrees come out at the same time and still hot. I got the Seafood Paella and it was delicious. It came with half a lobster! Super filling but really great tasting with lots of seafood. I know that everyone else fully enjoyed their entrees (Vegetable risotto, sea bass, and short rib). We also ordered a bottle of their house pinot noir and it was a great tasting wine for a house wine.I understand now why this was a top recommendation from several people and I hope to come again. Would definitely recommend making a reservation ahead of time because it was very busy even for a Wednesday night.
2019-02-03,5,I recently ate at Amanda's for the first time to celebrate my birthday and it was an great experience!  The ambiance is lovely, it feels elegant and cozy.  Service was fantastic, our water and wine glasses were never empty and everyone was polite and helpful.As for the food- we started with the creamy polenta and the spinach side dish.  For entrees we got risotto and sea bass.  And for dessert we had the panna cotta and chocolate mousse.  Everything was delicious!  Of note for vegetarians - they have quite a few options, which was very much appreciated.Overall, I highly recommend Amanda's for a nice meal!
2019-01-26,5,I went for the early dinner menu. Every single bite was delicious. I had mushroom soup with truffle oil to start. Next I had duck confit and loved every bite. It was salty but duck is a dark meat and it was great. The serving size was perfect. The waiter gave us plenty of attention and left a good 20 min pause before bringing dessert. Chocolate panna cotta with cherries was rich and thick. It was generous and delightful. The early menu price of $19 per person is astonishing. It took me 6 years to finally make a reservation but it will be much sooner that I return. Love it. Restroom is in the basement which is a nice walk before dessert. Oh I also had a pear margarita and it was just balanced and tasty.
2019-01-21,4,Fantastic food but seemed like an off-night for the service as it took too long pretty much every step of the way. But, easy to overlook as the food makes this place really worth it. Had the grilled octopus to start and at the recommendation of our server ordered the beef short rib. Both were the best of these I've ever had. Highly recommend.
2019-01-20,5,My mother and I are restaurant connoisseurs and decided to try out Amanda's. We could  not have been any more pleased with the respectable and welcoming staff, the cozy environment, and the delicious meal. An all around pleasurable experience. We will definitely be back to try their brunch. Certainly worth keeping Amanda's bookmarked in your restaurant book.
2019-01-01,1,I've never been so underwhelmed. Granted, our group went for New Year's Eve dinner but the food was borderline awful (over-cooked, lukewarm) and the service felt chaotic. Needless to say, none of us will be returning to give this place another shot. Perhaps brunch is their only good meal? Not willing to take my chances...
2018-12-29,5,Such a great meal with my mother. We arrived just in time for the early 5:30 pm seating and enjoyed a splendid 3 course meal for a great price ($20 each). The duck was cooked to perfection and the key lime pie was to die for. We will definitely return for the service, if not for another round of desserts.
2018-12-20,5,I have gone twice now for the early dinner fixed price menu. It is an amazing value for top-quality food and service. I highly recommend the moules frites (if you enjoy mussels) and the sea bass with spring risotto. My husband loved the duck leg confit, and my son thought the polenta was a delicious first course. We will be back next time we are delivering my son to school at Stevens!
2018-12-16,3,I really liked Amanda's. Food was fantastic, people were great, service was good. Just ticked off by couple of things - OJ supposedly to be freshly squeezed was packaged OJ and side of bread for $3 was one slice of bread.
2018-12-01,4,Went here yesterday for my birthday celebrations, had made reservations in advance which I believe would be required as the place got completely full. Our server was knowledgeable, thoughtful and efficient. I had a glass of their chianti red, very good! My husband had an old fashioned which was good enough for him to ask for a repeat order. Their charcuterie plate was delicious with a nice assortment of sweet, salty and fruity flavours which we completely devoured. We ordered the soup out of the specials, it was a sweet potato soup with coconut flavour but it was way too sweet for me and I couldn't take more than a bite. For mains I had the sea bass, again very good in-spite of being reasonably full by now me and my daughter shared and finished most of it. My husband ordered the chicken but couldn't do justice and we boxed it for later. When we made the reservation we had mentioned it was for my birthday and they ended our meal with a bowl of ice cream , very sweet gesture and added a lovely touch to my celebration. I would definitely recommend it for a special occasion.
2018-11-25,5,It's a charming little restaurant. It's literally a house, partitions and all. The food is amazing! The clams for starters were really good. The scallops for the main dish were done perfect with the perfect sauce!
2018-11-21,5,Personally, I find Amanda's a bit intimidating from the outside because it looks super fancy and I feel like if I am not dressed really nicely, I'll stick out like a sore thumb - BUT I honestly think you should definitely eat at Amanda's for dinner. My fiance and I ended up doing the pre-fix menu because he loves Duck. I had checked their menu online prior to leaving our apartment and saw they served Duck (we figured why not!). It's $39 per person and you get to choose an appetizer, entree, and a desert all for $39. He had the Duck Liver spread, the Long island Duck Breast, and Churros. I had the Maryland Crab Cake, Pork Chop, and Churros as well.We were both happily impressed with the quality of food. Each bite was incredible, tasty, juicy, amazing, you name it! We truly enjoyed each and every meal. For a moment sitting in the restaurant, I honestly wanted to thank the Chef for serving us, such great food (I figured why not just share how satisfied I was on here).As for drinks, he ordered an ice tea and I ordered a strawberry lime mojito. I love when restaurants give a stronger cocktail (because I feel like I'm getting my money's worth) and they did! It was a tasty, classy (not super sweet) cocktail. All in all, I'd say this restaurant exceeds expectations (for us) when it comes to food. If you're looking for a good date night spot that serves high quality food, this is the spot for you. Also, if you have a habit of drinking tons of water with your meal, the service here doesn't let your water glass go empty! They always come by to fill my glass (I love that!). The decor gives you a chance to dress up if you want to make the night feel special and on top of that - you get incredible food. The only area of improvement I could see is maybe the fact that the food does take some time to come out, but honestly it's worth the wait - especially when you leave so satisfied.
2018-11-05,1,EDIT: Amandas responded and gave us a very nice refund and apology.Do not book your event here. First of all, there were like four or five events going on - service was slow. I got served cold tea and wasnt even given the options of other tea options besides black tea. The waitress said they had regular tea - which doesnt mean anything. There is white, yellow, black, green, and oolong tea. I also saw her give my mom a green tea bag when she told me they only had "regular." This particular waitress had a lot of attitude which was noticed by many members of the party. The food was not very warm either.  I booked a baby shower here and they did not choose the proper menu after I had written back the options I wanted. Even if they were confused, they should have clarified with me. I chose "salad" and they gave us fruit salad. If i had wanted fruit salad, i would have said FRUIT salad. I picked two desserts as well as opting to bring our own cake - nobody told us that dessert wouldnt be included if we brought our own cake. If i had known this, i might have chosen not to bring our own cake because they wanted to charge us the same price. They wanted to charge us two dollars for icecream and two berries on each plate - we didnt even get the icecream which i didnt even know we had as an option. My sister wrote them an upsetting email because she did not want to cause a scene at her own baby shower - they have not even responded out of courtesy. Amandas used to be a restaurant i frequented and I no longer will due to the unprofessionalism of the staff. They clearly do not care about customers wishes and just want to sneakily charge people money. I will no longer recommend people this restaurant in hoboken.
2018-11-04,2,I was really disappointed in their brunch.  The food was fine but the service was horrible.  We were never offered bread when we sat down.  The waiter rushed us through brunch...,if we didn't keep asking for drinks we would have been in and out in 30 minutes.  In fact he kept bringing us the bill, we would order more drinks and he would sigh because he constantly had to rerun the check.  I'll add....the restaurant was empty so it's not like folks were waiting for a table.  I've had great dinners there,but expected much more for brunch.  I'll add I asked for my omelette to be well done, it was cold.  My husbands sandwich had no taste.  I had about 4 small potatoes on my plate.  Considering we spent $160 or so,I expect much more.
2018-10-20,5,We had dinner there and it was fabulous. Some of us had the chef's choice menu and others ordered off the regular menu. Everything was wonderful and the service was excellent!
2018-10-05,5,Stunning! One of the best reataurants I have ever been. Extremely good service and stunning food. Ordered two appetizer and one entree. Love everything about this place. Definitely going to return soon.
2018-10-02,5,This place is a gem.  The food is amazing, and the service is attentive, polite, and personal.  Enrique the sommelier is a wizard, so HIGHLY recommend that you get his opinions before ordering wine.  Dinner at Amanda's was the highlight of my birthday.  Thank you!!!!
2018-09-30,5,This place is excellent all around!  The good is outstanding, wonderful elegant ambiance and superb service!  We will be back again.
2018-09-26,5,Extraordinary.It was restaurant week in Hoboken and Sweetie wanted to explore. We invited our oenophile friends (he totes his wines in an alligator wine carry case) for dinner and ate splendidly off the regular menu. All the offerings were shockingly good, as was the service and ambiance. There is a reason why this restaurant has stood the test of time for more than 25 years.I'm a PIA when it comes to eating out so I pick nits often, just because perfection is unattainable. But I could find no flaws on this visit and while not everything we experienced was perfect -- it was darn near.This restored brownstone is the perfect foil for the refined bistro eating you will find here. Perfectly attentive but non intrusive service was as good as it gets. Not stuffy and we wanted for nothing. They even let us close the place long after closing time, while the manager and his staff tried new dishes and wines at the bar. For a modest corking charge you can BYO here and we did. After a couple bottles of my friends vintage Cabs and Pinot noirs -- the next few hours were a blur.We ate lobster paella, NJ scallops, braised short ribs over gnocchi, tagliatelle, and a variety of starters like burrata with fruit, polenta, oysters, pulpo, flatbreads and a charcuterie board. The nuanced flavors in every dish were astonishing!Candied hazelnuts and grapefruit flanked the burrata perfectly with sweetness, acid and texture. The paella was more like a perfectly al dente Milanese risotto with an entire lobster on top. The tagliatelle was hand cut and the veal ragout clung to it like a baby to her mother's breast. The short rib over gnocchi evoked my mother's Sunday pot roast in gravy over mashed potatoes -- but pumped up on steroids with truffle cream.  The scallops were perfectly delicate and sweet on their own but then you get that woodsy trumpet mushroom behind with the slightly bitter broccolini, and a potato leek emulsion for a smooth texture and just a hint of surprisingly rich and unexpected prosciutto-miso sauce on the end.  This was umami to the nth degree.We finished with passion fruit custard -- decadent and fruity, tart and sweet. Perfect spoonful to end the meal. Our entire meal was like this -- yin and yang, sweet and savory, tart and spicy, crunchy and silky -- evoking all the sensory pleasures.Ok. Ok. So lots of good wine and pleasant company can alter your senses some. But I'm thinking that it's more like Amanda's food, service and ambiance made our wine taste better and our company more pleasant. Yeah. More like that.The price point here is reasonable for what you get and far more reasonable than some overpriced mediocre food I've eaten in Bergen County and NYC. Top Tip:  Bring the best wine you can afford and pay the corking charge.  Food this well executed and thought through deserves the best accompaniment.  It will save you a few bucks in the end.
2018-09-18,4,The 19.00 price fixe dinner at Amanda's isn't too shabby! Here's the deal. Two seatings - one at 5 and one at 5:30. Three courses -- appetizer, entree, dessert. They are pretty strict about the seating time, so just be aware. The interior is cozy and beautifully decorated. It's got an old school Victorian feel, and it sort of felt like we were dining inside of a dollhouse which I loved. At 5:30 on a weekday we were legitatemly the only people there. But by the time we left at around 7 the room had definitely started to fill up. The first course on price-fixe is either a green salad, soup of the day, mussels or polenta. I had a corn bisque and it was flavorful, delicious and paired perfectly with the crispy bread that was brought out. Oh, and speaking of crispy bread... it's served with the most delicious herbed butter. My sister ordered the polenta, and this was an absolutely massive portion. The polenta was topped with chorizo and a cheesy sauce. Oh so rich, and oh so delicious.Entree choices included a fish, a filet, duck and pasta. So there's a nice little mix of everything. The filet was cooked perfectly rare and came with four generous slices. There was also a side of very buttery and creamy mashed potatoes. My sister really enjoyed her duck which was served with wild rice and cherries.  Dessert was my only order regret. I'd stick to either the apple strudel or the key lime pie and avoid the chocolate cake. We were joking that it literally looked and tasted like a giant tootsie roll. Super weird consistency and an even stranger flavor. For 19.00 this is a really solid deal - food is high quality and portions are fair. You'll also be here during happy hour which means that you can enjoy everything with an 8 dollar glass of vino.
2018-09-08,1,Food is almost ok. We ordered New York Strip Steak and Sea Bass, both needed some seasoning. The ginger ale we ordered was 90% ice and 10% the drink.The waiter was disrespectful and unprofessional. There was a girl who picked up the dishes and brought the bill, she was very professional and nice.So definitely I wouldn't recommend the place.
2018-08-28,1,Order on a Wednesday to eat on a Thursday. Slow and very expensive for adequate food that isn't difficult to get right.
2018-08-14,5,Quaint cute place. Perfect for bridal shower events, tea party, warm Ambiance.service was excellent.food was terrific..all A+
2018-08-12,5,Delightful spot! Great for breakfast/brunch! We came here on Sunday afternoon and had a great time. Very sweet atmosphere in an old Brownstone type house. Enjoyed the food, the atmosphere, and the staff very much. Thank you!!
2018-08-05,5,With so many options to eat out, Amanda's is still our favorite restaurant in the tri-state area. Outstanding quality, always consistent, and great service. We come here for all of our anniversaries and special occasions, and even did engagement pictures here. Earlier dining options with 3 courses and wine are fantastic and I hope Amanda's continues to do them. Can't wait to go back!
2018-07-27,3,Came here last night with a reservation and was promptly seated. Food was okay-- had the octopus and vegan mushroom ravioli so it was in a coconut sauce. The wine we ordered, a red Zinfandel, was way too cold it took 15 minutes to return to room temperature. Manager told us they keep it at 55 degrees which is way too cold. Red wine is usually stored at like 65 degrees and room temperature is even warmer than that. Dessert and service were great but I think next time I'll try a different restaurant since I wasn't overly impressed for the price point.
2018-07-22,4,Made a reservation a few hours before on Open Table and we were able to get a table for four on a Saturday night without a problem. The braised short rib gnocchi was amazing. It was crowded, but didn't feel like.
2018-07-21,5,I walked by this place for so many times and wanted to have brunch at some point, but the time was just not right. Finally I got a chance to try this place tonight and I'm saying this restaurant is worth 5 stars.They had two menus, one was normal and the other was early dinner special. I ordered soup of the day, crispy duck leg confit and key lime pie. The soup had a mix flavor of creamy and apple. The duck meat was soft and separated from the bones, as it's confit so it's not greasy at all. The lime pie was the best ever I've tried. The lime flavor was strong, with whipped cream on the top.
2018-07-20,1,What happened?  Food was excellent a year ago but dinner last night was awful. Bread was stale. Octopus salad was tasteless & lobster pasta dish didn't have a single piece of lobster & the pasta was over cooked. Could not say a single good thing about this dinner. What a shame!
2018-07-19,1,I believe I stated that I was turn away on more than one occasion because I did not fit the profile of who they wanted to dine in their restaurant  due to capacity and not having a reservation. When I called they said I didn't need reservation . When the reservation was made and I arrived I was given a excuse about capacity . My last name is Irish, so they had to make an excuse that they were full.  I'm a business woman I owned my own business and a home owner on Hoboken . I was dressed well for fine dining , but again I was a victim of racialProfiling .
2018-07-09,5,I had the ​Polenta with chorizo​, tomato sauce, pesto, chervil to start and Pan Seared Sea Bass with spring vegetable risotto; both from the early dinner menu.  Both were delicious. I finished to off with Chocolate Panna Cotta which​ was very good. the atmosphere​ was pleasant​ and the service was very good.  I was visiting my Son and his Fiancee and it was one of their favourites​.
2018-07-01,5,The best all-around culinary experience I've had thus far in the Tri-State area. No exaggeration. There is an inviting ambiance that is immediately felt when you walk into Amanda's that was backed up by the warm greeting I received and continued by the excellent service from the wait staff. The food was delicious from the appetizer to the entree to dessert. Definitely on my favorites list.
2018-06-22,4,So many visits to Amanda's, and never a brunch. We did one on Father's Day and had a nice one. Service was slightly slower than normal but nothing that ruined the meal. There is a nice selection of appetizers and main dishes that don't just include eggs. Their Bellini's are the real deal.Appetizers:Egg over prosciutto/asparagus toastPolenta with bacon & onion relishEntrees:French ToastCrab Cake Eggs BenedictSteak and eggsShort Rib burgerDessert:Their key lime pie still shinesAmanda's is a solid spot in Hoboken and one of my favorites
2018-06-09,3,Simply stated: I was disappointed. Amanda's was nothing special to me. This may be because I went here for dinner and not for brunch. It has a B&B type feel. There was nothing inherently wrong with it, and I loved the design of the restaurant. I just haven't been in a rush to go back. I would try it for a special occasion brunch.
2018-06-08,5,A lovely restaurant with wonderful food. The regular menu is expensive; but if you can get there for their early bird, you're in for a treat. You get an appetizer, an entree and dessert for $19. You can also order a bottle of wine for $25. Try the key lime pie for dessert. It comes with berries and a dollop of real whipped cream. The service is outstanding. Be sure to make a reservation. Parking is a problem but they have an arrangement with a nearby garage.
2018-05-27,5,Delectable food.loved the place. such warm ambience and service..Location works out well too.
2018-05-16,4,A Hoboken staple that never disappoints.  Romantic vibe, wonderful staff and delicious food.
2018-05-13,4,We celebrated Mother's Day at Amanda's. The food and wait staff was great. Only one complaint.  My son and I had the pappardelle and the portion size was subpar. As an appetizer it would have been ok but for the price charged as a dinner it was a shame.  This really needs to be addressed.
2018-05-13,1,We came for brunch on Mother's Day without a reservation, fully prepared to go somewhere else.  We were told we were in luck & there was one table open!  (With no caveat of any time constraint).  However we were rushed out, given "a few minutes" to eat desserts that weren't even served yet.  It was extremely unprofessional of the restaurant & a rather shocking ending to our meal.The coffee was extremely cheap over roasted robusta; service was slow; food was okay. Needless to say, we won't be returning
2018-05-05,4,Amanda's is a very nice restaurant with fantastic service and good food. To be honest, the food is a bit overpriced for what it was, but I guess you're paying for the prime location!For the appetizer, we got the cauliflower steak and then the mushroom ravioli for entree (both vegan!). They were both really tasty. I preferred the appetizer, while my boyfriend preferred the ravioli! Since I went for my anniversary, my boyfriend and I each received a complementary glass, which was extremely thoughtful and added a nice touch to the end of the meal. Keep in mind parking around Hoboken is atrocious, but Amanda's cross honors parking tickets from one of the parking garages so you only have to pay $5 for a parking ticket.
2018-05-04,3,i've been here a handful of times with my friend who really loves this place. I think the food is acceptable, but debatable if it's worth the price. I've been for both brunch and dinner - same outcome = meh.
2018-05-01,4,Came here to celebrate my Birthday. We started with the Octopus and the creamy polenta which were both good portions and had good flavors. Entrees we enjoyed the Rack of Lamb and the NY Steak, both really good and perfect temperature.Dessert was really delicious and not overly sweet, it was a passion fruit pana cotta. My only minus was that the waiter didn't seem knowledgeable about the menu. I asked him whether the mussels on the appetizers were in a sweet sauce, he hesitated and answered me with "I wouldn't necessarily say they are sweet" mmmmm okay, that's why I got the octopus lol. Overall a good experience, we will be back.
2018-04-28,4,I can only comment on the early dinner seating which is a seating at 5 or 5:30 PM Monday through Saturday.  Went tonight, Saturday, and really enjoyed the meal, service and price.  For $19 a person, you can choose from a limited menu of an appetizer, entree and dessert.  Plus, they have reduced pricing on certain cocktails, wine and beer.  You can order off the main menu which includes other selections but the ones on the early dinner are the same or similar to those on the main menu.  The main menu was pricey.The choices for the appetizers include soup or salad or polenta or a potato dish.  We were a party of 4; : 3 ordered the salad which was very good.  One ordered the polenta which was exceptional.  For the entrees, 2 ordered sea bass, 1 ordered steak and the last was duck leg. All very good.  The other choice was a pasta dish.  The desserts that we ate were key lime pie, apple strudel and chocolate Panna Cotta.  No problems there.  All this for $19 a person.Service was outstanding. Water glasses were filled quickly and someone was always close by but not intrusive. Staff was efficient and friendly. Portion size was adequate.The only negatives about the meal.  We had called and made a reservation for the later seating, 5:30.  We were told it was not unavailable so we requested 5 PM.  Eating our meal at 5:45, we could see there were plenty of empty tables of all sizes.  Maybe people didn't show or canceled but it didn't feel that way.  The second negative related to parking. It is really hard to find street parking in Hoboken.  The restaurant, to its credit, has a deal with a parking lot (about 6 blocks away).  When we called to make the reservation, we were told the charge was $5 to park for up to 3 hours.  At the parking lot, the attendant told us to get the parking ticket validated for $5.  At the restaurant when we validated the ticket, they wanted to charge $10.  We complained to the manager and he quickly reduced the charge to $5.  Something was off.  All in all, a great meal for a great price with good choices as long as you don't mind eating early,
2018-04-28,5,The food was amazing and the ambiance was cool. I got a goat cheese and beet salad type app which was delicious and the spring rissoto for my main and we got a bottle of their Rose for the table. My friend had the prime rib and she loved it and my sister had the vegan ravioli and she also loved it. We also tried their polenta app which was nice. For dessert we had their flower free chocolate cake and cappuccino (yum). Great food. Temperature of the room was a little cold and the server could have been a smidge more attentive. We made a reservation and had a nice table, which I thought was nice. Overall lovely experience.
2018-04-18,3,I had been looking forward to trying this place, so my husband and I finally made it in on date night. The food was good. Definitely good, but not amazing. The service was average. We sat down at 7 and were seated promptly without a reservation, which was great. But our server didn't take our order until nearly 730, despite coming by with our drinks. We were there for 1.5 hrs with just one course. And while we loved the time together sans kid, there were definite pauses of "why are we waiting so long for ______". I went in with high expectations, and maybe that was the problem. Good but not great.
2018-04-17,5,I love this restaurant!! I eat here all the time for dinner and brunch and it's amazing!!! I totally recommend it to ANYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The food is DELICIOUS and there are so many options! Service is great- everyone is friendly  and helpful! If you're looking for a place to book a party or just looking to have a fun night with friends, definitely try Amanda's first. They offer multiple party rooms. My personal favorite is the "ball room" because of it's privacy. Making a reservation is helpful, but not completely necessary. They dress code is pretty casual, and jeans are definitely allowed.  Go to Amanda's and you won't be disappointed!!
2018-04-15,3,My family had an event here a few months ago. We liked the food -- I think the most memorable thing our guests kept talking about was the polenta (they actually talked about it again just yesterday at another function) -- and the service was good for the most part, but we aren't very happy with our experience. We chose the weekend brunch menu. There are two options (one that was $32 per person and one that was $35). We went with the more expensive one, which comes with a cocktail. When the servers were coming around to take our drink orders, I asked what the choices were and he gave them. I asked for a mimosa. My sister had told the servers to make sure they tell our guests about the cocktails, but as I was mingling, I saw that very few people had one. While talking to some of them towards the end of the party, they asked about my mimosa and, when I told them that a cocktail comes with the meal, they said it was never mentioned to them. We asked others after the event and they said the same thing. My siblings and I (we arranged and paid for the party) were very annoyed that we paid for the higher priced meals, but the servers told only a few people. It was not on the printed menus that were left on the tables either.If you choose to hold an event here and choose this option, YOU make sure your guests are aware of it because the waitstaff will make damn sure not to. They made a lot of money on not offering the cocktails, but being paid for it. On top of that, the tax and gratuity was calculated based on the more expensive meals.
2018-04-14,5,This is a very special place. Whenever I have visitors, this is where I take them to ensure an unforgettable evening. My wife and I have celebrated our anniversary at Amanda's for the past three years and they have always made us feel very special. The food is outstanding, the atmosphere old school elegant and the staff is unmatched.
2018-04-08,5,Came here yesterday on a Saturday morning for a bridal shower. Upon arrival, I was greeted in seconds to have my coat checked and get me a drink. The service was great from start to end. The room was tasteful and curtained off from the main dining room. The menu for the event contained two-three choices for each course and all sounded phenomenal! The food tasted fresh and was delicious. I have been wanting to try this place for months and I'm so happy I got the chance to. I will definitely be back!
2018-04-07,3,Nice and cozy restaurant in Hoboken. We are a danish family from Europe. We had book a table for early birdie dinner, we had a very good dinner, good service nice food and good surrounding. We where missing a "junior" dinner for our son at 13 years old, but he liked most of the courses.
2018-04-02,2,I guess every decent restaurant has its off days. On a recent Sunday, our waiter didn't want to be there and the kitchen couldn't keep our meals warm, our white wine cool or our sorbet unmelted. My chicken was fine, though - though not my dining companions' trout or ravioli.
2018-03-30,5,I have been going to Amandas for years for special occasions (anny, birthdays). EVERY time the food and service are absolutely amazing. I can't fathom how anyone would ever give this place a bad review. It's one of those places where as soon as you take a bite of their food you are thrown into some sort of euphoric food heaven where your taste buds just had a cigarette after food sex (and I am not a smoker). And it's like no matter what we order the food is good. The place is a bit pricey which is why we only come for special occasions but it is worth every penny. I hope this place never changes and always stays right where it is. Do yourself a favor, book a reservation, take good company with you, order up, get a bottle of wine and your soul will be going to a happy place.
2018-03-28,3,I loved the private rooms for couples. Romantic  ellagance and the food is to die for
2018-03-25,5,Love this place. Delicious brunch! Crab cake is delicious as is the polenta. Good cocktails too.
2018-03-08,5,Just superb food, service and ambiance.
2018-03-04,4,I've been here for both dinner and brunch'. They have a very polite and friendly staff we've always gotten excellent service! The food is delicious and they have great options. My favorite part is the space, it has such a lovely ambience and vibe. I think it's a great place for a date!
2018-03-04,5,wowzers!  the idaho taters are INSANE.  Be warned.. the spicy stew IS spicy, and amazing.  This place is expensive, and you will get the stink eye if you happen to have oh... say blue hair.....  The service was fantastic, no way could I afford to eat here if I was footing the bill.I was not, so I had a great time.   The pork chops looked really good.So many times the place has no way to live up to the hype, not this trip back in time to my aunts cool and semi creepy old house.  very crowded, must be that people like really great food and service.
2018-02-17,2,I've come here a couple of times in the past three years, and maybe decent ambience? That's about it. I will also say this, that the ingredients are fresh. But I just don't get why it's gotta have eggs in everything. It's brunch, not breakfast, and some people don't eat eggs even for breakfast. If I wanted eggs, I'd fry 'em up at home. The last time I came here, I had some hash and cold yolk all over it, and it was disgusting. I couldn't finish it. And so darn overpriced for some eggs. Don't care what famous organic farm it came from, it's eggs. Can't help but feel that you're paying for not the food, but for the rent.
2018-02-16,5,By far the best restaurant in Hoboken and probably in the area, and our absolute favorite. We rarely dine at the same place more than twice, but we lost track of how many times we dined here.Perfect for a date night, special occassion or just occasional dinner with the family. We tried most dishes in the menu and not a single one disappointed. Also, the service is really world class.
2018-02-10,4,I was at Amanda's for a Sunday brunch a few weeks back with a friend. Although the interiors were a little antiquated do not let that fool you. The brunch was solid. I got a salmon and spinach eggs Benedict which was on point. We shared a bread basket which was amazing - super fresh the only complain I might have is that we had too many of the corn muffins. I got a Hennessy based specialty coffee which was a bummer. Maybe that was just not my drink.All in all it was a solid brunch and I would rate it a 4.5 but since a girl named Amanda cancelled our first date last minute I'd take half a star off that rating.
2018-02-08,5,We went for restaurant week, the three course menu (42$) for diner was delicious and they are not feeding you with the cheapest items on their original menu, no no a real good menu (lobster was delicious).we were in a small private room in the back, at the end of our meal, the owner came to talk to us, really nicely and offered us proseco as it was my birthday, nice touch.service and waiters are delicate, careful and polite. highly recommended
2018-01-28,5,We went for the first time for Hudson Restaurant week, everything was outstanding. The service was impeccable, and the environment is adorable. We ordered off the restaurant week menu and enjoyed a bottle of wine. We were not rushed and thoroughly enjoyed each course. Beet salad, gnocchi, pork chop, steak, poached pear, and Italian donut were excellent. We were really worried about parking but were able to find street parking a block away. We will definitely return!
2018-01-28,5,We recently held an intimate 12-person dinner at Amanda's to celebrate our wedding ceremony at City Hall the day prior. In sum: everything was absolutely perfect, from planning through execution. The Reserve room downstairs, where we held our dinner, was just beautiful and so special. Our guests loved the paintings of Hoboken and its history on the walls, I think many of these were painted by Juan, the owner. How cool! It was a very private setting and perfect for a few emotional speeches and toasts, away from other guests. The food was absolutely delicious, every single person around the table had a clean plate after each course. The service was impeccable. Dishes were well timed, glasses were always kept full. I can't say enough about how wonderful the evening turned out, but I would be remiss to not applaud the planning process leading up to the event as well. Each step of the planning process and every single communication I had with the Amanda's team was incredibly helpful, productive and positive. They were willing to accommodate our crazy dietary restrictions (2 vegans! 1 gluten free! 1 allergic to dairy!), last minute changes in attendees and overall made it so easy (and so fun!) to plan the dinner. They even worked with us to provide a personalized menu, with our names and the wedding date. A fun memento from the evening! We will never forget this very special evening shared with our family and best friends. A HUGE thank you to Juan, Julie, Olivia, Enrique, Jonathan and the rest of the incredible staff at Amanda's from the bottom of our hearts for helping us make our "dream dinner" a reality.
2018-01-22,5,Never judge a restaurant by its exterior! I've passed Amanda's many times, but never looked beyond the simple exterior. Shame on me! From the moment you open the door, you are transported to an elegantly appointed interior that is reminiscent of a 19th Century parlor. The warm tones and stately decor really set the tone for what was a delightfully elegant meal. We were seated in a quiet table by the window, where I spent the evening jealous of my friend's seat, facing the restaurant. When the dining room is that pretty, passers-by just don't measure up.       I started with an Apricot-Sage Bumbler - a cocktail of theirs made with Bacardi Silver, apricots, honey, lemon, and sage. Served in a delicate cocktail glass and garnished with a fresh sage leaf, the bright yellow libation made me feel I was in a prohibition era speakeasy. I don't usually prefer rum, but the apricot and honey drew me in and made for a delicious cocktail combination.     Ordering from their three course, Hudson Restaurant Week prix fixe menu, I started with the steak tartare. Served with a quail egg, chili tempura, and shoestring potatoes, the meat was perfectly seasoned, and almost creamy in texture. The quail egg enhanced the creaminess, and the chili tempura added a welcomed bit of heat. Excellent idea adding the shoestring potatoes, as they provided wonderful crispness.     My meal continued with a Flintstones sized pork chop that could not have been cooked more perfectly. A lightly charred crust on the outside, and the juiciest, barely pink inside. The sweet potatoes and arugula lent a delightful sweetness and hardiness to the dish, as did the maple pearl onions. Ask for extra bread because you will want to sop up the veal jus the chop is floating on.      As I always say, food goes to your stomach, but dessert goes to your heart. The bombolini (donuts) were TO LIVE FOR!!! Freshly fried and rolled in cinnamon sugar, these sweet orbs of dough are a sweet tooth's fantasy. As light and airy as a cloud, but with enough flavor to make you eat 5 orders. The huckleberry sauce was superfluous for me, but only because the bombolini were so good on their own. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the salted caramel ice cream wasn't the best salted caramel ice cream I'd had. You could actually taste the salt AND the caramel. Had I been in the privacy of my own home, I'd have liked the bowl.      The service is wonderfully attentive but not remotely intrusive. In a word, Amanda's is elegant, through and through.
2018-01-20,2,Food was fine (probably 3.5 stars), but I would like to write about the service.  Our waiter asked my husband three times how his food was, and managed to never asked me about my food, as if I didn't exist.  To this restaurant, their female customers do not matter.  We will not come back.
2018-01-01,1,In my opinion I would not suggest dining here if you want honest and polite service from management. Called tonight, Monday 1/1 to make a reservation at 4 pm. Asked if they were still honoring the early dinner special given the holiday. The female hostess that we spoke to said yes and asked if we would like to sit for the 5 or 5:30 seating. When we arrived for our 5:30 seating to a completely empty restaurant we sat, got menus and asked our waiter if we could see he prefix menu. He told us that they were not honoring the prix fixed food and wine specials for Monday. We asked to speak to a manager and when the manager came over he offered no apologies for the confusion. We chose to leave as the lack of service and overall lack of care of the customer was dismissed. This is incredibly unfortunate as we made a reservation, made our way to this location, sat and then were offered such terrible service by management for their miscommunications. Regardless if the first employee who took our reservation and answered our questions was mistaken, we should have been honored with what we were promised or at least given some sort of reason other than "whoever you spoke to was wrong", especially considering the place was completely empty. Amanda's, we expect more in you and your staff and management and deserve more. Hoping the rest of 2018 will bring it out of you.
2018-01-01,5,Seriously, the best restaurant in Hoboken. I usually come here for the early bird pre-fixe dinner and it never disappoints. For the deal, you have to make a reservation for either 5pm or 530pm on Mondays to Saturdays. You have to place your order in by 545pm and be done with your meal by 7pm. For this deal, you get a 3 course dinner for the ridiculously amazing price of $19 per person. They also offer an early bird bottle special to go with your meal for $25. They have a really good pinot noir that you can get for the $25 special. I always get the creamy polenta as my appetizer. It's so decadent and rich and I think I can eat an entree size of it easily and call it a day. For the entree selection, I've had the steak, which can be a little dry and mundane in comparison to the other choices. The pan roasted sea bass with cannelini bean salad is out of this world. They recently added a chicken pot pie to the menu and it is rosemary laden hearty goodness. The desserts are also top notch. I'm a huge fan of their silky chocolate panna cota,  topped with drunken cherries.The wait service here is fabulous. They don't treat you any differently, whether you're getting the $19 prix fixe or the usual menu, which is pretty pricey. I can not recommend this restaurant any more!
2017-12-25,2,Was at Amanda's last night for their Christmas Eve prix fix holiday dinner and it was by no means up to their previous quality or standard. Service was   abismal and we should have been clued by the fact that we waited almost 30 min for a martini at the table. After that, the wait between courses was far longer than should have been as by this time earlier diners were leaving and the Resturant was beginning to empty out. Food was good but not great and at desert a knife was required to cut a pastry for dessert. At the end, when the check arrived, the waitress had the nerve to ask me to hurry up because she wanted to go home. We will not be back.
2017-12-16,5,Hoboken's best kept secret is the early bird special at Amanda's. You must be seated before 5:30 (Monday to Saturday). For $19, a three course meal--appetizer, main course and dessert. Very pleasant atmosphere. Good service. Tonight, we are having polenta for appetizer. A rich, creamy polenta with mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes on top. The salad is fine--nothing spectacular. For dinner, sea bass and chicken pot pie. Our server, Valentina, highly recommended the pot pie and she was spot on. The pot pie was amazing. The crust was flaky and delicate. Inside was a succulent blend of well seasoned chicken, carrots, peas and potatoes. The sea bass was very good--crispy skin, perfectly cooked. Now for dessert. Apple strudel and chocolate panacotta. The apple strudel had a delicate crust, lots of apples and tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream. The panacotta was rich and creamy and perfect for dark chocolate lovers. Drunken cherries on top and some berries on the side. With one glass of wine (shared), the total came to less than $50 plus tip.
2017-12-10,3,My rating is 3.5.  Good food nothing special.  Mixed drinks from the bar mediocre perhaps safer to stay with bottled drinks. Cozy setting with small rooms feels like being in somebody's home. Staff is attentive yet impersonal and almost robotic. Expected more for the money and failed my expectations from previous recommendations. May return but not dying to do so.
2017-12-09,5,What an amazing restaurant !!! Made a reservation on open table and for special occasion all I wrote was girlfriends birthday. Walked in was met by the manager Enrique who sat us at our table. Before we can even order drinks Enrique walked over 2 glasses of champagne on the house for the occasion. The place was beautiful, food was great, but the whole experience was the best part. Will definitely be going back soon.
2017-12-08,3,I came to Amanda's Restaurant for brunch on a Saturday afternoon with my friends. It was definitely a nice restaurant, but I honestly didn't think it was anything special. The decor was a little weird - it's definitely unique but the pictures around the restaurant were just a bit strange for me. I felt like I was in someone's house, which was... interesting. The restaurant is also much larger than I expected - there's a few small rooms, so you can never quite get a sense of how big it is. However, we sat down right away, despite it being packed when we first walked in, which was nice.The food was definitely good - we all got the Tomato, Basil and Ricotta Omelette. We also got one side of Sausage for $8, which I thought was a little steep. Overall, everything was tasty.
2017-12-03,4,We had such a great experience @brunch today. The decor was charming and reminiscent of Virginia Wolfe. We ordered the steaks and eggs, Croissant French toast, soft scrambled w truffle creme fresh. Everything was spectacular for the exception of our actual server, maybe he was having an off day. Even the hosts were super attentive. We def will be returning.
2017-11-27,4,Enjoyed the Lovely ambience on our dinner date and the food tastes amazing as wellThough the options on the dinner menu is limited, the food was great! The presentation was equally good the staff was so kind and attentive. The Classic meatballs appetizer is a must try!Don't miss the desserts too.
2017-11-26,5,Always such a wonderful meal and hospitality! It's a huge plus that they give a parking validation for 5$ even on a Saturday night!
2017-11-26,5,Best restaurant in Hoboken, hands down. The service is impeccable. Food is tasty and they have a massive wine selection. I go here when I want to be spoiled. The service in most all Hoboken eateries is horrific (snotty, lazy, arrogant students) but at Amanda's, they are clearly well trained. There are however, three things I wish Amanda's had (1) Wifi (my kid wants to watch videos while waiting for his food) (2) Whole wheat bread/rolls (yes, their white rolls are tasty but Hoboken is packed with health concious people; please update and offer healthy rolls) (3) More veggie options (seriously lacking vegetarian options as well as veggie sides). But as you can see, I still love the place, hence the 5 star rating.
2017-11-18,2,Insanely overrated and overpriced. Went for brunch today and menu was overindexed on eggs w limited options otherwise. Ordered the crab cake app and spinach salad.  Mediocre at best for the price. Even the cappuccino was bland. Will not go back. Don't waste your time.
2017-11-10,1,Jonathan the manager is not pleasant to work with.  He does not believe in treating his customers with a pleasant attitude. He's immature and snarky and should not be running any type of establishment of that caliber. Truly I've heard multiple stories about him and he's Fed over every single customer.
2017-11-10,1,I have tried to go here twice both times I have been told that there are no tables available, on both occasions the restaurant has been empty, coincidentally both times I have had a short sleeved shirt on and have tattoos, I can only conclude that I am not welcome as I would upset the old lady's who frequently the place.
2017-11-04,5,I came here as a guest at a baby shower for a Sunday brunch. They had a perfect sized room for the shower and provided some extra tables for gifts and other items during the shower. The service could not have been any friendlier. The staff offered to help carry in gifts to the room, and also offered help carrying some bags when we were leaving the establishment. They were very on top of taking everyone's order for meal choice, and the food was great. It was such a lovely little spot, perfect for a baby shower, and the people were so pleasant there too.
2017-10-22,5,We went to Amanda's for a birthday brunch and this place didn't disappoint at all. I believe that the bread a place serves, says a lot about it. The moment I tried the complementary bread I knew that the food is not going to disappoint at all. Not to mention, their bread basket is a must-try. We tried their Crispy eggs, and Eggs in Purgatory. Both entrees were absolute deliciousness!!
2017-10-22,1,Food is terrible. If this restaurant were in NYC it wouldn't last a year. I couldn't actually even finish my meal. My husband pushed his around and tried to make it look like he had consumed some of the food. How do we spend $50+ and end up feeling this disappointed?Service is amazing though. That's the only redeeming quality of the restaurant.
2017-10-21,4,Small, noisy, and crowded but lovely. It feels like an old-time restaurant with wonderful staff who will fill your water glass without even asking. A little on the expensive side. Try the early bird for $19. You get three courses, and a bottle of house wine is only $25. Try the key lime pie for dessert. It comes with berries and a dollop of real whipped cream. Yummy. Be sure to make a reservation. Parking is a real problem here. There's plenty of street parking, but almost impossible to find an empty spot.

2017-10-02,5,Fantastic restaurant and delicious food with great service. The ambiance is very cute and intimate. It also serves as a fantastic establishment for events as well. My husband and I hosted our rehearsal dinner here and the food and service was excellent. It is always a treat to visit here.
2017-10-01,5,I went to Amanda's in April for my birthday with friends. I really enjoyed it. I had a rather large group so I made a reservation and they placed us in a pretty private room with a long table which was nice. The inside is cozy but not too small and had a nice ambiance. The service was absolutely fantastic. It is often hard for a server to deal with large groups but he swiftly took our drink and meal orders and they came out promptly. For my entree I had the Truffle Fusilli Pasta which was very flavorful. At the end of the meal, the staff sang happy birthday to me and presented me with a small dessert which was very kind. Loved this place and will definitely return next time I'm in Hoboken.
2017-09-18,4,I was really impressed by this place. The food, service, ambiance, decor, all very good.From the outside you would think the space is really small but man was I surprised when I walked in. I think they merged two building's into one, which isn't very visible from the outside. Once you make it through those two akwardly placed doors and make your way future to the back then you'll be gloriously excited.The ambiance is warm and welcoming, nicely lit, white tablecloth sophistication without the stuffiness. The servers were friendly and helpful and service relatively quick.The food was good, nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either (but definitely Yelp worth). There portion size was average which was fine with me but meant my bf was still hungry. I think I'll definitely be back.
2017-09-01,5,Tried the 3 course early dinner with my family. The desserts are excellent! Great atmosphere and professional service! If my family visit Hoboken again, they would love to come to Amanda again. One of the best restaurants in Hoboken.
2017-08-11,4,Had always walked past the place and was wondering how great they were since I've heard so much about them. We had the prefix meals and I thought it was fantastic. If I remember correctly it was an appetizer an entree and dessert for $40. I had a steak dish that was cooked perfectly. My mother and father had the chicken dish and the Angus sirloin dish. I loved the welcome we received and the staff was extremely friendly and it definitely had a family vibe to it. Our waiter was very acquainted with the selections and was extremely helpful. Would definitely recommend!
2017-08-05,4,For Saturday afternoon brunch, my boyfriend and I shared a fresh fruit plate, crispy eggs, and salmon and spinach eggs benedict. The salmon spinach benedict was delicious, but standard. Potatoes were cold but the serving of eggs was so big I wasn't even hungry enough to eat them! The star of the meal was the crispy egg dish - poached eggs lightly breaded and flash pan fried. OH. MY. GOD. Served with mushrooms, cheese, asparagus and prosciutto, this dish is mouth watering at every bite. Our server was sweet and we loved the seat at the window! We here it's even better for dinner and will be back to find out.
2017-07-25,3,So I finally tried Amanda's for brunch, and I think I'll be sticking to the Truffle Fusilli that I mentioned in my last review.My boyfriend and I came in on a Saturday with a 12:30 reservation. The place was pretty empty except for about two tables, and two separate parties going on in the back. We happened to be seated in the dining room that was right smack in the middle of the two parties, which made no sense - especially since the front dining room was empty. Naturally, it was very noisy but not the worst. We could have asked to move but we didn't. Luckily, the two parties didn't take away from their service because we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering, so we were in and out within 45 minutes.For drinks, he had the bloody mary (not good, very bitter) and I had the bellini (basic). Both were pretty expensive for brunch drinks ($8), for no reason but I get it - you're paying for the ambiance. It's not like we wanted to spend our brunch hour with a bunch of frat guys at a bar, pounding $3 Miller Lites anyway.For food, I had the Crispy Eggs (with asparagus, shiitake mushrooms, prosciutto and parmesan fonduta). The crispy eggs were interesting. It was like a scotch egg but without the sausage. It wasn't bad but it is a bit heavy for brunch, especially with the cheese fonduta. The side salad it was served with helped that out a little. I also wish there was more prosciutto. He had the Grilled Hangar Steak with Eggs. This came with some fruit and home fries. The steak was pretty good but you should order it one level rarer than how you would normally order it.Overall, I don't think brunch was anything amazing. But like I said, that truffle pasta will always have a place in my heart.
2017-07-24,4,My Husband and I go to Amanda's on a regular basis.  We love the atmosphere and the service is consistently good.  They are also happy to alter dishes based upon my dietary restrictions including giving me a mixed salad each time which is not even on the menu.  I would rate them a 5 if they would offer specials and change the menu more often.  The menu changes are minor, mostly preparation alterations of the same protein.  Ultimately, there are limited choices but all are good!
2017-07-23,5,Can I love Amanda's more? No! I live their bread basket. Being here like eating with family without the family.  The service is amazing. Food is very well prepared. They have an early prefix dinner option that is very affordable.  They also have free parking option. Please go to Amanda's. Don't miss out!
2017-07-11,5,PHENOMENAL! I recently went here with my parents and we are all still thinking about our meal days later.Atmosphere: They play a relaxing playlist with a variety of music from samba to country to jazz. The decor makes you feel like you are in someone's home, and each room is unique. Our server was very upbeat and charming.Appetizers: The polenta held its shaped opposed to being a mushy bowl. It was covered in cream and a bit of pesto. Delicious. The fresh spinach salad had just enough vinaigrette which was tasty and light, without being soggy or dry. The almonds were slivered and lightly toasted and it also had fresh strawberries. The perfect summer appetizer. Everything seemed so fresh.Meals: We had the sirloin steak. We asked for medium rare and it came out as medium. We didn't send it back because it was still delicious. On the side were potatoes au gratin wth bleu cheese and grilled veggies.Then came the duck confit, which my mother described as the best lamb she has ever had! It just fell off the bone and came with mashed potatoes and an excellent gravy.Dessert: I have never liked key lime pie until I tried this one! It was unbelievably creamy. We also had he apple tart which was so-so.Overall just a phenomenal restaurant to take your parents or older relatives, or a date night. Not a good place for children.Also, we went on a Sunday night. It was not crowded at all, but on Sundays, they do not offer the early bird prefix menu which was a bummer. My first time there (an equally wonderful experience) was a Saturday night and it was very very busy. We were seated in the basement which still has a charming room, and you can pass their wine cellar on the way. Make a reservation and try to get there by 5:30 for the $19 prefix!
2017-07-09,1,Absolutely horrid. I went here for dinner yesterday and I went here last year. They must have changed management or chefs because the food was horrendous. I feel sick to my stomach writing this cause it did not taste good or sit well with me. The beet salad was NOT like last years it was completely disgusting, I ordered a seafood dish that was UNDERCOOKED & my husband ordered a salty steak. We are not picky people and I was raving about this place to my husband all to be let down. Wasted a pretty penny for a meal I could have gotten somewhere else if I knew the food was going to be like this.
2017-06-26,5,Summary:A no-bro zone in Hoboken?  Shiver me timbers!  I made the Hajj out to Hoboken (shiver, eww New Jersey, ugh path) to see a friend for Saturday brunch. I was pleasantly surprised to find no chavvy Jersey bros here, thankfully.  It was just a nice overall experience that was cheaper than I expected.The Food:The eggs benedict over crabmeat was a fantastic idea.  50 points for Gryffindor!  The crabmeat was perfection.  Totally not the overly chewy crabcake you get at some places.  The bellini was not as sweet as what you get at some places and it hit just the right spot.The Atmosphere:This place had a Victorian feel to it which may be what's deterring the fist-pumping chavs (yes, I know I'm using Britspeak but I want to be all encompassing when speaking about trash).  The atmosphere was what made this place quite enjoyable.  It was quiet enough so that I could comfortably catch up with my friend.The Service:Lightning fast.  The drinks and food came out without much of a wait.  The waiter was very polite and left us alone to chit chat whilst I did not see the bottom of my water glass.  Gotta love the places where you get service without even noticing.Also, my friend drove me back into Manhattan so I didn't have to deal with that godforsaken path train.  Not really a service of the restaurant but made the experience much more enjoyable.  Til next year!
2017-06-25,4,Cute resto with perfect polenta, hangar steak, panna cotta and wine!  Walk to the pier or see a movie at Bow Tie after.
2017-06-23,5,Amazing food at the early bird $19 pre fix. Will definitely come back again and I want to try their brunch! I had the hanger steak which was amazing and my mom had the pork medallions and she loved it! I would highly recommend the polenta as an appetizer ,but the mixed green salad was also very good! Please come here not only is the food and chef amazing it is also a great atmosphere and wonderful service.
2017-06-22,3,Oooooooold fashioned food, old fashioned restaurant. Is this bad per se? Nop. Just boring. Nothing surprises you. If you're looking for an average wannabe meal from the 80s, this is your place. Don't look further!
2017-06-11,3,Interesting venue.  Lots of different rooms within the building.  Great for our party of six   Food was good, though nothing terribly exciting.
2017-06-07,5,Early dinner is so good for the price of 19.50 that I'm wondering if the owners are doing this restaurant as a gift to the community. Pork medallions were tender. Service was exceptional.
2017-06-02,5,We came here for my sister's wedding party with some friends and it was the most wonderful experience. The food was amazing but the service was absolutely incredible! They up graded our smaller private group room to the larger one because it wasn't being used and didn't charge us anything extra. They were professional and seemed to take care of everything seamlessly without hovering or being obtrusive to our event. I'd go back here in a heartbeat!
2017-05-28,5,While honeymooning in Hoboken, we came upon this gem. While it's been there for 25 years, you might overlook it...it's subtle, gorgeously appointed and classy. We enjoyed their early dinner special which was superb. The service was fantastic and the entire waitstaff made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant, though it was packed with locals who know a great place, when they have literally hundreds of others from which to choose. I have nothing but rave reviews for this Hoboken landmark. Can't wait to return soon again!
2017-05-27,3,We never venture out to NJ (as we live in Manhattan)...Decided to explore Hoboken....Heard good things about Amanda's... Um, mistaaaake. Cute inside but the food was bland, service was horrible. We didn't even try dessert bc dinner was enough disappointment for one night.
2017-05-26,1,Really cute decor. Really fun menu. However the food itself is bland and not cooked properly. Mussels were eh with undercooked potatoes. Short rib dish tasted like a college experiment gone wrong and octopus was ok. All in all not sure what the hype is about. Save your money and go somewhere else
2017-05-26,3,Very pricey for food that isn't that exciting. Classical/ vintage  American interior feels like fine dining in an upscale traditional style home. Good presentation but the flavor depth and quality of dishes are not quite up to par with other NYC restaurants.
2017-05-22,5,This is my favorite brunch in Hoboken! The restaurant has a great ambiance and great food. I would recommended having a reservation because this place is always packed. The wait staff always has 5 star service. I highly recommend the crispy eggs which are delicious!
2017-05-20,3,While the atmosphere is warm and inviting the food is across the board mediocre at best. No specials on a Saturday night? To me this is a restaurant soon to be deceased i the Hoboken area.  Service is good. Wine list seems to self serve a high percentage of profit rather than quality and diversified selection.
2017-05-19,5,If you are looking for a top notch dining experience, Amanda's is the place! I have lived in Hoboken for 3 years and finally got my chance to dine here with my family. I was celebrating a special occasion and Amanda's staff did not disappoint. The food was exquisite from the cocktails to dessert and they went over the top in adding their congratulations to my celebration. I'd recommend this place to anyone, whether you are looking for a classic dining experience or a palace to celebrate your special occasion!
2017-05-14,2,A disappointment: expensive price fixed menu  food was not good, service was marginal.  A glass of wine was not included in expensive price fixed dinner.
2017-05-12,4,Delicious but pricey.  Always have had a good meal and good service here, but prepare your wallet for a shock!
2017-05-08,4,Decided to do dinner at Amanda's, was a little skeptical at first (coz I expect their brunch menu to be the better option) but absolutely loved the place.Loved the ambiance of the place and most definitely enjoyed the food. We get the grilled octopus and the Beef short ribs. The ribs were delectable and went perfectly with the wine we got. For mains we shared the Rack of lamb, which was cooked perfectly and the zucchini with potato side complimented it perfectly. On the whole i am a fanOn a side note: If you have never had the NJ Beer Co Stout at the place its definitely worth it. Thanks to the bartender for the suggestion
2017-05-07,5,If there's such a thing as casual elegance, Amanda's has it. This beloved Hoboken eatery is located in an old brownstone on Washington Street, and it retains the feel of being in someone's beautifully decorated home. It's cozy and classy at the same time. Then, of course, there's the food. Amanda's is a winner for either dinner or brunch. The dinner menu seems to get changed up from time to time (probably seasonally), but there's always an array of sophisticated but unpretentious entree options, with something that will please most palates. I had the pan roasted salmon and thought it was absolutely delicious. They serve very good rolls with dinner as well and have a solid wine list. I recommend saving room for one of their delicious desserts. As for brunch, you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but I can tell you from experience that the croissant French toast and the crispy eggs are standouts that you won't find at too many other restaurants. Be sure to get a mimosa too - they're pretty strong here! Whatever meal you're coming for, reservations are a must; I've been here a few times and it has always been very busy. The one thing I'd caution about here is that brunch can feel a little bit rushed depending on when you arrive. If your reservation is at peak brunch time, they will probably bring your food quickly and want to turn your table over pretty fast, so it's not necessarily the most relaxing experience. If you're looking for something more leisurely, I recommend coming at the later end of brunch time. We didn't find this to be much of an issue when we came here for dinner. Overall, though, Amanda's is a wonderful choice for brunch with friends, a family celebration, or date night. It's not hard to see why it's become such a mainstay on the Hoboken restaurant scene.
2017-04-21,3,Excellent ambiance and service. Very mediocre food. Mussels were average, chicken and gnocchi were dry. Probably not worth the hype or the price tag
2017-04-20,4,Went there last night with my love. The ambiance is very romantic for couples, however, I did notice the restaurant's patrons were mainly age 55 years+. We were seated near the window. The staff is very inviting and accommodating. The food:lobster bisque contains no lobster. Instead, croutons that were soaked in lobster stock was put into the bowl and then the bisque poured on. My chef husband did not appreciate that. The scallop dish I had was very good and the right portion so that I did not need a to-go container. My husband said his steak and the au gratin were "ok". He is a chef, so his palate is more refined than the regular layman. I would revisit the establishment.
2017-04-16,5,Amanda's is great. Food is delicious, service is very good and they accommodate to your every need. Desserts are to die for and prices are fine. It's not a diner so expect higher prices but worthwhile.Love Amanda's I should go there more often.
2017-04-09,4,Yeh eggs Benedict with crab! Yum yum but start with the fresh bread and the experience just gets better!
2017-04-06,5,Love this place for brunch! It's awesome that you truly feel like you are sitting in someone's home. The french toast was amazing, and the staff was so friendly. What I liked most is that most of the people that walked in seemed to be repeat customers that most of the staff knew. Makes it feel homey. Will definitely be going back!
2017-03-26,4,Free bread and butter, awesome service, bread basket, crab cake benedict, salmon spinach benedict and the chicken croissant sandwich, what more could you ask for. Honestly. So good.
2017-03-12,5,Believe the hype.Amanda's lived up to every expectation I had and more. I came here for the weekend early-bird prefix special for $19, everything was delicious! My girlfriend and I journeyed over a mile in the blistering cold only to be greeted by a nice cozy fireplace to warm us up at the entrance of this fine dining establishment. There was a coat check room as well.Amanda's takes service to another level! Yes,they will collect your crumbs off the table in between courses. Yes, they will be experts on the American cuisine  they serve and are more than happy to recommend their favorite dishes on the menu. Yes, they will be kind and gracious to ensure your experience is unmatched.Furthermore, I imagine people are coming here to celebrate events in their lives (i.e. graduations, anniversaries, birthdays, etc), but honestly this is a pleasant choice regardless. Come here with family, come here with friends, it doesn't matter! Groups of varying sizes will be greeted here with open arms. I assure you that this is one of the best dining experiences you will have in Hoboken, period.
2017-03-07,4,I came here for brunch, everything was okay, clean and frienddly place, the food was good, but.. I was  surprised how small portions are. I don't eat a lot, and in other restaurants portions are some times too big for me. But after brunch in Amanda's Ieft almost hungry (I had a crab cake and smoked salmon carpaccio).
2017-03-05,5,Excellent food and ambience. Feels like you're in someone's home. Staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Scallops and pork chop were amazing.  I will definitely come back here.
2017-02-15,3,We have been waiting quite a awhile to go to Amanda's.  The restaurant has a wonderful reputation in Hoboken.  However, we were quite disappointed for a meal that cost $160 for 2 people.  Overall, the meal overall took quite a long time to come to table even though we were there quite early and it was mostly empty at the time that we arrived.  The branzino did not taste fresh.  I am not sure if it was because it was overcooked, but overall it tasted quite fishy.  My husband had the lobster bolognese, which he said had almost no lobster.  The saving grace was the desserts- while they took forever to come to the table they were quite impressive.  Kudos to the pastry chef and the only reason why Amanda;s receive 3 stars vs. 2.
2017-01-27,5,Amanda's was such a pleasant surprise. Whether it's a special date night or a spur of the moment night out, this is the perfect place. The food was outstanding and the service even better. I look forward to the next time I make it back to Hoboken because I will most definitely be paying Amanda's a visit. A very special place to dine.
2017-01-20,4,A friend and I went for dinner. I ordered the scallops and they were amazing. I forget the name of the cocktail I ordered but it was pretty tasty. I wasn't crazy about the flourless cake on the dessert menu. Service was decent.
2017-01-05,1,Overall food is solid though the desserts were very dry. Unfortunately the management needs to work on their customer service. When there is  a discrepancy between your advertisement on your website (confirmed via reservation btw) and the check, the customer should be right unfortunately my party was apparently "wrong". No price adjustment after the fact was pointed out, no comp, no apologies for the discrepancy...nothing.Disappointed in the management since the food alone can't entice me to come back.
2017-01-02,5,Second time visiting and great experience. Service was outstanding and perfect. The food was outstanding, starting with the carrot soup and my girlfriend had the beef tartar. For mains I had the honey ginger glazed pork chop with potato purée and broccoli rabe. Was really the most delicious pork I've had, as tender as a piece of chicken. My girlfriend had the sirloin steak which was cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.
2016-12-29,5,We went here for an anniversary prefixed dinner .Portions were what would be expected on a prefixed menu. It had a very "homey" feel to it. We had an enjoyable time.
2016-12-17,4,I had been hearing about Amanda's for a long time now , mostly about its spectacular brunch and since I rarely do brunch,I kept putting off dining here. Well,finally, a friend of mine, a fellow yelper made it happen.The early dinner menu seemed like an excellent option both for the variety and for its affordability.The drinks were strong and  incredibly well made,my first sip of their Glenfiddich proving to me that this was one of my better decisions.The curried carrot soup starter blew me away.How is it possible that carrots can taste this good?I slurped down every bit of goodness and swore to myself to look up a decent recipe and make this at home.For the second course,I chose roasted chicken and switched out the sides and sauce which had pork in them for some mashed potatoes and veal sauce(it tasted like bordelaise). The chicken was incredibly good though a tad tougher than I would have liked it to be. I tasted my friend's orecchiette pasta with roasted red peppers which was again, a really well composed dish. It was not overly creamy like the usual run-of-the-mill pasta dishes. We finished our meal with the chocolate panna cotta and the vanilla whipped ricotta dessert.Both of these were excellent,especially the panna cotta,the tart cherries adding another dimension to the sweet chocolate.The ricotta dessert was way less sweeter than we expected it to be which was a pleasant surprise.The service throughout was quite attentive and the whole atmosphere was classy.I loved the fact that they were accommodating enough to switch out sides from their prix fixe menu and cater according to our preference.It definitely seems to be a nice quiet dinner type of place and I am looking forward to come back with my SO. Its also a great place to bring out of towners to showcase a more elegant side of Hoboken.
2016-12-16,4,I went here for the first time with my friends. We loved their brunch options.  I liked their eggs Benedict a lot. Definitely will be back again
2016-12-08,5,I would go all the way back to Hoboken just to eat here. My best friend just had her rehearsal dinner here and wow, was it amazing! The service was exceptional (and they were dealing with about 40 people in the back room). The bread was delicious and I had the truffle pasta for my main course -- I ate the entire plate. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. I had the flourless chocolate cake for dessert, which was also amazing. I hope to come back soon!
2016-12-01,3,Decent brunch spot in the area.We stopped by with a reservation for a weekend brunch for four, and the place was moderately busy and is actually far larger than it seems. We split a bread basket to start, which was just alright; the bread is a bit on the dryer side and the pastries pretty average, and I wouldn't order it again. For my entree, I had the crispy eggs, which was actually fairly well done and had nice texture to go with the rest of the dish, while the short rib hash wasn't bad either.Overall, the meal was decent, nothing too memorable but a solid spot for Hoboken for smaller groups.
2016-11-18,5,Another fantastic experience at Amanda's. Service just as professional an impeccable as the last visit and the food was again completely delicious.Ordered the crab cake benedict which I've had at other places and it's always pretty heavy. Amanda's does it without the English muffin which makes the dish a lot lighter and you can actually really taste the freshness of the crab in each bite. Perfect amount of food on the plate, and their awesome mimosa was a great accompaniment.Also got the roasted potatoes this time instead of shoestring potatoes which, in my opinion, was a much better choice. Thanks for another great brunch! See ya soon.
2016-10-28,5,My husband and I came here for a special occasion for dinner and we do not regret it!The atmosphere is beautiful and romantic. We were greeting with a warm welcome by the hostess and we were taken to our seat where our waiter quickly introduced himself. He was very attentive and very kind. My husband ordered the Branzino fish and I ordered the duck. I was very impressed by the texture, taste, and flavor of both dishes. I also loved the sides that both came with, it was very favorable and made you want to lick your fingers at the end! For dessert we shared the Keylime pie and the flourless chocolate cake with coconut ice cream. It definitely completed our meal. We were both very satisfied with everything.I will return here again to try other items on the menu. You could tell the chef knows what he's doing and I personally want to say "thank you!"
2016-10-19,5,My wife and I celebrated our 27th anniversary at Amanda's.  We had a wonderful time. The service was excellent. Attentive yet unpretentious. From the manager who greeted us, to the servers who served us, to the bartender who validated our parking, everyone was warm and friendly treating us like friends.The food was, in a single word magnificent!  Our meal was elegant and delicious.  Again, I have to use the word unpretentious.  It was a meal made to be eaten. Have you ever gone to a fine restaurant and the food was presented like a sculpture? The chicken was reassembled and garnished to look like a live chicken with feathers?  This isn't that place. Preparation and presentation was like what my mother does when company is coming.  It looks delightful, but the way it looks makes you want to dig in. Again, absolutely delicious! We had a wonderful time and we will be regulars.
2016-10-08,5,Pretty restaurant perfect for a special occasion....Started off with a meat/cheese plater which was devine and I got the special "SHE CRAB" Soup which was better than when I got this soup in the South (which is their specialty down there....)I got the truffle pasta which was delicious (I am drooling thinking about eating it again.)My husband got the duck which he fell in love with as well...It was my birthday so they surprised us with key lime pie =)Great Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand... my fav...This is a winner for a nice night out =)
2016-09-24,4,Fancy ambiance with a nice feel. Close tables. The salmon and pork chop are best. Skip the duck
2016-09-22,5,Excellent service and food. High quality food and even better when you go for the early dinner special at a reduced price, including wine.
2016-09-05,5,Amazing Brunch! It has been three days and I am still thinking about the incredible invention crispy eggs are. While everything else about brunch was great, I can not stop raving about this dish. Perfectly cooked eggs fried in a panko type bread crumb coating, served with sauteed mushrooms, grilled asparagus and mixed greens. Every item on the plate perfectly complimented each other, elevating what one comes to expect at brunch!Other dishes including the benedictine, salads, fresh bread, and home fries were also superb. We can not wait to come back and try this place for dinner!
2016-08-28,4,Came here Thursday night, and I enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The vintage feel is perfect for those searching for the ideal date spot or business dinner. The lack of TVs is a huge pro for me, especially as a person who enjoys conversing over dinner. I would not have imagined downtown Hoboken to offer such a cute little place.Wine--you can pass. Entrees and appetizers seem pretty solid though. I'd return to try to seared foie gras!
2016-08-17,3,I've attended a number of brunches and have always been more than satisfied.Decided to go for dinner and was disappointed.   Our server was rushed, but great, so this not about her.The place was super crowded and just as noisy.  This includes disturbing sounds of flatware and dishes in the kitchen.   Very rushed, so much so, there occurred a major crash in the kitchen.Food was mediocre at best.  I had very expensive Bronzini fish over rice and shrimp.  I couldn't believe how small a portion they served.My wife ordered a pasta dish and she didn't finish even a third of it.If you go, Sunday brunch is good.  Forget Saturday night, it's a disaster.
2016-08-01,5,This place is absolutely amazing! The hostess was incredibly accommodating and sat our party of 8 in a back room without a reservation and no wait time. Most of us went with the prefix option (myself included) and each course was better than the last. The service was impeccable, timely, and very accommodating of our special requests (allergies and side options). Needless to say, I will definitely be returning to Amanda's for my next special occasion. 5 Stars all the way!
2016-07-31,4,First time here.  My friend found the restaurant via Yelp!  The place is a lot larger than the outside would lead you to believe. The staff was courteous, welcoming and professional. Really paid attention to the details like advising you to watch your step when navigating the step down into the dining room. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. We came for brunch. The wait for the food was reasonable and the meal was very good. I selected the skirt steak with eggs and potatoes. Simple but very tasty.  The decor was classy without being stuffy.  The restrooms are clean and seemed to be well attended to. The place was busy and I went twice (drank too much water).  Check their website as the validate parking at a specific location.
2016-07-25,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5.  Their restaurant week menu had items that are unique to it compared to their regular menu but they were so good they should be a daily item! The beef tartar was delicious making a great combination with the tart pickled shallots and crispy crostini. The Curry Braised Short Ribs were absolutely amazing. The meat is so tender you do not need a knife at all and the curry adds a hint of smokey flavor to the rich beef braise jus that is so delicious it'll even make the microgreen garnish taste good with the sauce. The carrots have a nice roasted flavor and the fingerlings have great crispy crusts. The Warm Chocolate Cake is moist with the salted caramel adding that hint of saltiness to enhance the entire flavor of the dessert.Service - 5/5. Amanda's truly takes classic French service seriously. There are show plates which are removed upon menu order, the bread is served individually by the waitstaff onto the bread plates, silverware is replaced after a single use, water refills are always done without asking, tables are wiped of food scraps every course and the meals are served and cleared at the same time. I was pleasantly surprised at the last part, as most restaurants tend to clear plates as they are finished but Amanda's staff waited till all diners were done before clearing. The restaurant is very high end so I'm glad their service level is up there as well.Value - 4/5. The Hudson Restaurant Week prices are fairly high compared to the competitions in the area, but I would give high marks to Amanda's as the food and service quality fit the prices they charge. Comparatively, the restaurant week prices are a great bargain to try many items when compared to their regular menu and the portion sizes aren't any smaller for the prix-fixe compared to their regular menu items. Great time to try Amanda's amazing food!Parking - Street (Metered)
2016-07-20,5,Went here for our 6 year wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. The restaurant has such an amazing charm to it that I feel like I am transported to a different era. Cozy and romantic but also good for dinner or drinks with friends. Our server ( can't recall her name) was wonderful in making suggestions for our entire night. We started with the tomato and mozzarella and octopus as an appetizer. Both were excellent, the octopus was a little tougher than I prefer but still wonderful. For dinner I got the lamb chops and my husband got the Bronzino. They both were delicious. For dessert we got the key lime pie and apple strudel. Overall we were impressed with the service and food and would return! THank you for making our anniversary special !!
2016-07-19,5,Love this place! If you want go somewhere for a romantic dinner with great service....this place is great. Beet salad, bronzino, scallops, lamb are some of the items I've had and they were all great.
2016-07-09,2,After reading the great reviews my husband and I with our baby in a stroller decided to give it a try.  I can say it was the worst experience I've had in a while.  I had to wait for sugar for my tea, by this time my tea had gotten luke warm.  Eggs were served, no salt and pepper...then no ketchup for potatoes.  I mean The amount of time I waited, I couldn't have just gone to the kitchen and gotten it myself.  Then we asked our waitress for hot water to warm up baby's bottle, she never game back and 10 minutes had passed. Now we have a crying baby...finally I went to the bar yet again to get something- this time hot water.  What a mess!  The inside dining room was packed but simple setting up of a table with the basic necessities is first step in being a waitress.  Oh! and our omelette didn't have cheese....i mean come on get something right!  I hate writing such reviews.....Not going back to this place...but you can give it a try - didn't find the food to be all that special.  And there is no baby changing table.  There is a bench in the women's bathroom- manager said this is what we call a changing table ( i wanted say in America we call that a bench and it's used for sitting not changing diapers)
2016-07-03,1,I'm giving it 1 star for the brunch. Very disappointed that a "gourmet" restaurant only has low quality ingredients and subpar table setting/ presentation. The only good thing I can say is the service is excellent. My latte was served in a regular coffee cup with the spoon in the cup, no saucer. He latte was very average, not what you would expect in a good restaurant. The price for the coffee is same as NYC excellent coffee $4.28 before service. The deception came when I asked if they had real maple syrup and insisted on what real means, they only have high fructose corn syrup with artificial maple flavor. This is a disgrace to any respectable restaurant. Ingredients are the basic of good food. The pancake factory and the Turning Point both offer the real maple syrup - made with maple water. One would expect a higher end restaurant to at least match the quality of the ingredients available at dinners...His place like like a decent restaurant but fails to deliver for brunch.
2016-06-17,4,Came here on a Saturday evening for my SO's birthday. First off, the restaurant is absolutely adorable, I love the decor and the vibe. Very homey but also classy. Very cute for date night. We were seated promptly. We were quickly greeted by our server and served bread and our menus. The rolls were basic but the butter that accompanied with it was amazing. I'm pretty sure it was homemade as the texture was different than what you would normally expect. He ordered the pan roasted salmon and I got the truffle fusilli pasta. His salmon was cooked to perfection, so light and tasty. My pasta was absolutely to die for. The pasta was perfectly cooked al dente, and the mushrooms with the sauce was the perfect combo. We finished off with the cheesecake, which again I'm not surprise was amazing. Super light and fluffy. 100% will be returning for more deliciousness!
2016-06-05,3,Came here with some friends for dinner. Made a reservation beforehand, however, part of the party was running late. The small bar in the foyer is perfect for the situation. Good selection of whiskey and other spirits. The bartender seemed knowledgeable and provided a decent standard pour on my whiskey. For the price point and locale, I honestly expected a bit more...Once the party arrived, we got seated promptly. The menu was focused and concise. Service was a bit delayed at times as it was difficult to locate our server when we needed some attention. A small star lost here...Food was well above average once they arrived both in taste and presentation. The fish mousse appetizer was delightful. I couldn't recall the type of fish used, but it was not fishy at all. Texture and taste were on point. On the entree, the chicken that I got was perhaps a bit on the tough/dry side. The fish entree (sole?), however, was cooked to perfection. The dessert had a nice presentation. However, the taste/texture was honestly just average. Not sure if it was made in house or sourced, but wish this area was a bit better. Solid 3 for me. There are so many other choices in this area. For Amanda's to be priced as it is, I would have expected better.
2016-05-22,5,Great place for brunch. Come early and make reservations for larger parties more than 2. Try the crispy eggs, eggs Benedict w salmon, and the French toast. Bellini and mimosa is a must
2016-05-12,3,We have been to here many times before, but last night dinner service is the first time I am writing a review on this place.   First of all the place has always been high quality and service in the past visits.  We had dinner reservations for 7:30pm for a party of four.  We did arrive on time and was seated by the host, whom we assumed was the manager.  The busboys did their stuff with the water and breads and then after a few minutes our waiter appeared .  We already had the menus from the host when we sat and were advised of their anniversary special dinner.    Our waiter came by and introduced himself and then we proceeded to order our Apps.  We had a question on one of the apps and the waiter did not know the answer and took off to find out.  Upon his return he did have the answer and we continued to order the apps and our main meal at this time. (Both together) Then we ordered the wine, two bottles, one white and one red.  Upon arrival of the red wine, it was the wrong selection we had told the waiter and that had to be returned.  The correct wine appeared.  We received our apps around 7:50pm and there were perfect .   We noticed the back room was full of guests and it seemed like a good part of the staff was working that area.   We ate the apps and continued to drink our wine.  As time passed we noted we had not received our food nor has our waiter come by to check on us for anything or advise us of a delay.  I attempted to make eye contact with our waiter in his passing, but he did not look our way.  Finally it was 8:50pm and our main meal has not arrived, I saw the Host (manager) and called him over to let him know our food has not arrived and he said he would check on it.   A few minutes later the waiter appeared and advised us it seemed the kitchen was backed up.  We assumed this due to the Large back dinner going and the rest of the place was generally busy. Or our main meal ticket was misplaced in the kitchen. The host (manager) did not come back to us to let us know the reason as I had asked him, he had send over the waiter to advise us.Our main meal finally came to us at 9pm, (came very fast once we advised the manager) with no apology for delay or any other words as to the foods being so late.  The meal was good, so we have no complaints on the foods, but only the service last night..  We also felt the Host (manager) should of offered us a glass of wine for a dessert on the house due to the long wait.  We did order dessert and were charged for it. I hope last night was  not what is normal for this place.
2016-05-10,5,By far one of the best restaurants in all of Hoboken... This place has been here since the beginning and the food has only gotten better. While their menu isn't serving up any wild and crazy new things they do the classics with a unique flair that just feels right.The service is always top notch as is the overall experience... Over years of coming here I've had the opportunity to meet the owner and he's a great man. He's very active in the community but more importantly in his restaurant. He actively goes around and talks to patrons to make sure everything is up to par, not because he has to but because he honestly cares that much.Go here and thank me later....
2016-05-08,5,The best restaurant in the area. Elegant, service is perfect and all of the dishes the four of us ordered were prepared wonderfully. We were there the Saturday night before Mother's Day and it was filled to capacity, yet we sat down immediately for our 730 reservation. The only negative is parking, and we decided that since we live in edgewater, best will be to uber to the restaurant and back.
2016-05-04,5,I took my wife here for brunch, and the food was delicious! I really enjoyed the atmosphere of Amanda's. I felt as if we were in an upscale restaurant during the Victorian era. We will definitely be going back!
2016-04-16,5,Beautiful restaurant from which you would never guess from the outside.  Great service, definitely more upscale, great food.  I had the short rib hash and poached eggs and my daughter had the steak and eggs..delectable.  Try it you won't be disappointed
2016-03-21,4,Lovely place to have brunch!Such a pretty Victorian style setup, loved being there! There is ample sitting and the restaurant is big! Still since its pretty busy, always a good idea to reserve a table. We were a bunch of 5 friends, and I think we ordered pretty much every thing on the brunch menu! Glad everyone enjoyed their meal. We ordered eggs Benedict, crispy egg , omelette, smoked salmon , chicken salad. Also, they serve mimosa! So basically wide variety to choose from!And the woman who served us had such a warm smile, it was a pleasure
2016-03-19,5,Everything was amazing from start to finish. The beet salad, butternut squash soup, salmon and oh my gosh the truffle pasta. One of the best meals my entire group had in a long time! Definitely worth it if you get a chance to go!! And the atmosphere is quaint and full of charm as it's an old Victorian house the restaurant is set in.
2016-03-19,1,The food was okay, but is it just a coincident that they segregated seating by race...? It was very questionable and was not pleasant. I observed that all colored skin people seat in the back and all whites in the front.
2016-03-12,5,Really nice brunch place in Hoboken. We sat downstairs and it felt like a private dining experienceWhatever we ordered was nice.French toast was delicious
2016-03-09,4,Terrific! We went to Amandas for our second anniversary and instantly liked the place. The service was amazing and the chef was able to create a custom menu avoiding my wife's allergies. We ordered arugula salad, chicken breast and vegetarian pasta with select vegetables and a mixture of marinara and garlic sauce. Along with the server's recommended wine pairings, we had a wonderful dinner.
2016-02-24,2,It was Valentine's Day and we wanted to do something different, go somewhere different. And to be honest Valentine's Day can be tricky...you want to do something unique but most importantly you don't want to "repeat" restaurants that you've been to - especially with other romantic partners. Touted as a romantic restaurant Jack and I ended up at Amanda's in Hoboken, NJ for Valentine's Day dinner. The one thing about Hoboken is the parking situation so we had a little bit of angst about being able to find nearby parking especially since we were in the middle of a Polar Vortex walking 2 or even 3 blocks seemed unfathomable and daunting. Lucky for me my boyfriend is a gem of a gentleman and he dropped me off in the front of restaurant and found parking a few blocks away.As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a warm "hug." The atmosphere is inviting and romantic. I made my way to the host/hostess stand and checked in. The host was jovial. He escorted me through the main dining room which was packed. I really liked the color palette and the décor was an interesting a combination of Hoboken maps and baseball. We were seated in the lower level which was small room of about 10 tables. Cozy. I checked my coat, sat down and perused the prix fix menu while I waited for Jack to walk back from parking the car.As starters Jack ordered the mushroom soup and I ordered the lobster risotto. Jack loved to mushroom soup. The menu did not articulate which type of mushroom but he said "whatever it is it's good."  As for the lobster risotto, let's say, I was disappointed. Was there plenty of lobster yes. There was just a rough taste to the risotto. Not as creamy as I had hoped. But it was ok. Not good, not great, just ok.For an entrée Jack ordered the halibut and I ordered the rack of lamb. Jack did not rave about his fish. It looked good but he was not in love with the dish. For the rack of lamb I can tell you that it was abysmal. No seasoning at all. It was if they just threw the meat on an open flame for 4 minutes and then served it. No salt, no nothing. Now what makes matters worse is that my rack of lamb is out of this world so I was also comparing how I make my dish to this one that was served to me on Valentine's Day. Disappointing. The plate looked pretty and was a nice sized portion but the food had no flavor.One would think that we would had our enough with the entrée experience to forgo dessert. But we didn't. We had paid for it as it was included in the price fix. We both ordered the cherry cheesecake which was actually good. Not the best cheesecake that I've had in the world but it was pretty good.So, would I recommend Amanda's? That's a good question. I am going to hold off on recommending people to go until I give it another try. I think there was a lot of pressure on Amanda's to perform on Valentine's Day and unfortunately it wasn't their best showing. What I can tell you is that it's a romantic restaurant and Jack and I will come back for another try.
2016-02-22,5,Amanda's, by far, is my most favorite restaurant in Hoboken. I have been here twice with my fiancé and both times have been absolutely amazing. The minute you walk in you're greeted by the friendly bartender who makes incredible cocktails, then a lovely hostess who asks for your name and coat, then you are greeted by, who I believe is Amanda herself (but I could be wrong - she seems like an owner). The service is perfect. Both of the servers we had were knowledgeable about the food and wine menu (which is very reasonably priced) and were able to give us great recommendations. They service is perfectly slow, if you know what I mean, you don't feel rushed whatsoever and you have time to enjoy and actually digest your courses. Compliments to the chef - the food is amazing. I recommend trying the "Duck Two Ways"...my mouth is watering just thinking about it. This establishment should be extremely proud of their staff and reputation...it really is a lovely place worth the visit!
2016-02-14,5,This is the second year in a row that I've gone to Amandas as an early Valentines dinner.  Both times the food, drinks, and service were incredible.Everyone from the bus boys to Amanda herself greets you as you walk in, and wishes you a good night and plenty of "hope you enjoyed your dinner" as you leave.The waiters are very very friendly, attentive, and professional.  The cocktails were delicious, appetizers portioned & timed perfectly, wine was affordable, and the dinner was outstanding.  Instead of desert we got desert cocktails which was perfect.Can't wait to go back and would highly recommend Amandas to anyone.
2016-02-05,3,Went to check out this spot for brunch and had high expectations of it based on the reviews I've read, but my anticipation of the place wasn't what I expected.  The food was pretty good yet not as wonderful as I'd hope for. The setting is homey and quaint but for the price of brunch I would have hope to get more for my money.
2016-02-01,5,This is my FAVORITE brunch spot in Hoboken, hands down! Everything on the menu is good. My go-to is the Fried Eggs with Asparagus. The egg is battered and deep fried to perfection, keeping the yolk liquid. It comes with a side of salad, shiitake mushrooms, and prosciutto. My second go-to (when I'm craving some sugar) is the Croissant French Toast. The fruit they use is seasonal, and comes with a side of fruit salad.The interior decor is very beautiful and charming- I'm talking fine china plates et all. You can host private events here as well with a fixed menu.
2016-01-31,3,I have to give my first time here a simple and basic three star review. There were several unfortunate moments that overshadowed the spectacular food offered here. In celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary we took the advise of a few friends and made reservations at Amanda's. Upon entry after a brisk 4 1/2 block walk from the parking lot we walked in and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited some more for the host who without bothering to look up once and at the very least acknowledge our presence in the room had taken the time to converse with other patrons, and make three trips behind the main entry way a curtain to bring out three separate cocktails. When he was done serving all if this tables cocktails he finally looks up and offers his service. We are seated and our experience officially begins. It's a Sunday night in February at 6:45. Their first thing I order is the very first cocktail on the menu and I am told it is not available  fine so I order something else, the I ask if I could have the salad on their special restaurant week menu in a full size and I'd be happy to pay a full price and I'm told that it cannot be done. Fine so I doer something else. Then I order my main meal l and guess what - not available, ok how about .... And again I am told no not available. At this point I would prefer to just go home but for my spouses sake and the face that we did drive in and the car was almost five blocks away I kept my smile on and adjusted. To the chefs benefit, the food did end up being DELISH and the cheesecake was WOW (pineapple upside down - not so much) but the overall service - except for the guy who kept filling our water, was mediocre at best. I wouldn't return, there are  plenty of places to find divine food and better service at the same price.
2016-01-26,5,Had such an amazing dinner tonight I need to review ASAP. We participated in the restaurant week menu and it was excellent. The decor was beautiful. Sexy and romantic. Restaurant is bigger than it looks from the outside. Had great service! I only have rave reviews and am so glad I tried Amanda's. I will definitely return!
2016-01-26,4,I've been to Amanda's three times for brunch and have enjoyed it every time. I got the turkey club twice - and it's very tasty. I got poached eggs a couple of weeks ago, and they were fine, but the dish was very small, especially compared to everyone else's. But I would go again to try something new. The service is good and the place is very nice - looks like an old house that's been converted. You really need to make a reservation on the weekends, but one time they even squeezed us in when our original restaurant turned out to be a dud and we left.
2016-01-23,5,We had our engagement party in the private room downstairs and it was absolutely perfect!  We had about 25 guests and everyone LOVED the food.  The service was top notch too. Amanda's even made the planning of the party so easy. All our guests had a wonderful time and we would highly recommend!
2016-01-16,3,Best way to describe this place is deliciously average.  Came here with 3 friends last week for dinner so I cannot speak on the brunch menu.Ordered the sirloin and it tasted like something you get at a bad wedding hall.Wine was good, service was good, and ambiance was good so that is why they get 3 stars.  The polenta also tasted like it was reheated in the microwave.
2016-01-12,5,I have always wanted to try Amanda's as I pass it a lot and got to try it for the first time the other week. Before heading to a Christmas play I took my girlfriend for the early seated pre fix menu. It was a great meal and the wine deal made it that much better. The reason I will go back over and over is because of one main reason, the service. It is the best service I've experienced by far in Hoboken. They are very attentive and well trained.   The staff really wanted to make sure we had a very pleasurable meal and that made the whole experience for us. I can't stress how great our meal was because of it. Can't wait to go back!
2016-01-11,5,My husband and I have made it a tradition (2 years in a row so far) of dining here on New Year's Eve.  The 5 pm seating is only $35 per person for a 3 course dinner.  That's an amazing value for the holiday and for the amount and quality of food you receive.  Upon arrival, we were seated promptly.  The New Year's Eve menu offers some featured alcoholic drinks, but the full bar is also available.  I started with a glass of the Charles & Charles Riesling and my husband ordered a craft beer.  We both chose to start with the Lobster Bisque as our First Course.  This was also offered the previous year, and we both loved it both years.  It's rich and creamy and perfection.  For entrees, my husband ordered the Coriander and Sesame Crusted Salmon with Moroccan Lentils and Preserved Lemon Creme Fraiche.  He said it reminded him of Indian food and really enjoyed it.  I opted for the Grill Skirt Steak with Truffle Mashed Potatoes, Haricots Verts and Red Wine Demi Glace.  Those truffle potatoes were mmm, mmm, good!  And the steak wasn't too bad either.  I really enjoyed my meal, and finished everything on my plate.  For dessert, I ordered the Black Forest Cake with Tart Cherries and Whipped Cream.  It was decent, maybe even a bit too rich for my liking.  The cherries were a nice touch though.  My husband had the Toffee Steamed Pudding with Caramel Sauce.  He raved about that.  On both of our visits here, we had a wonderful New Year's Eve.  The service was impeccable and the food was delightful.  And for the price of $35 plus tax, gratuity, and beverages, it can't be beat.  We're definitely looking forward to returning next New Year's Eve (and maybe sometime during the year too)!  Thank you for making our New Year's Eves a night to remember!
2016-01-03,4,What a lovely posh place! We thought it was small upon entering with a tiny bar and back room, but when I used the restroom I realized it was quite large. It was decorated with library decor and a really nice atmosphere. The menu was pricy for brunch, but worth it. Their rolls to start were fluffy, moist and almost potato flavor. We LOVED THEM. Hubby had a bloody Maria by accident and liked it (he meant to order a Bloody Mary haha ah well!). My sister in law had a Bellini and deemed it amazing. My mother in law had fresh juice and I had the perfect cappuccino. For brunch my husband had the croissant French toast which was the best meal! It was amazing, delicious, fattening and just wonderful. We split bacon (thick, delicious) and sausage for a side. Spot on. My SIL had the crispy egg and devoured it. My mother in law didn't like hers. She had the chicken salad and said the chicken was quite dry. Mine was just okay as well, chorizo and goat cheese omelet. Something was missing (maybe pepper!? Salt? Can't tell) and it had way too much goat cheese. Dessert was more epic cappuccinos and a molten lava cake which was gone in seconds. Their restroom was clean and coat check was quick and easy. Totally recommend this place, but order the French toast for a safe bet on entree.
2016-01-01,4,We kicked off the New Year by trying a new restaurant ( for us ) for Brunch and we were not disappointed.  We appreciated a very warm greeting by the Host who seems to have perfected the exact amount of time to spend and tone to bring to a short welcoming conversation as you settled into your table.  The environment is very warm and cozy and romantic in the section we were seated in beyond the bar.  I learned while looking around the restaurant that there is a much larger and still charming area within other sections of this restaurant.  There is also a small private area on the first floor and a private room downstairs.  The brunch menu was strong and we both enjoyed our meals ( eggs in purgatory & eggs with short ribs hash). The service was very attentive while it remained a private dining experience.  Thank you Amanda's for a good first meal of 2016.   We drove from Central NJ - felt it was worth it & we will return.
2015-12-29,5,Food, service & ambiance at Amanda's is excels! A wonderful dinner & experience! thank you!
2015-12-26,5,Amanda's is an amazing place for brunch or for any special occasion. The environment makes you feel at home with its warm ambiance and portraits displayed on the wall. The employees are friendly and are always on top of things. I came here on Christmas Eve for the pre-fixe and everything was to die for. For appetizers, I ordered the steamed mussels. They were embedded in vegetables and drowned in a creamy red wine curry. For my entree, I had the grilled angus sirloin with blue cheese potatoes and vegetables.The steak was perfectly juicy and the potatoes had just the right amount of  cheesy goodness to them. And for dessert...  chocolate cake with a peppermint chocolate filling. Extraordinary! (I also took some bites of my sister's bananas foster, which had a wonderful combination of caramel and chocolate)Overall, I had an amazing experience here. The service was keen on making sure my family and I received everything we ordered. This place puts a little modern twist on American food by adding rich ingredients.
2015-12-22,5,Absolutely love it here! The food is amazing, the atmosphere is beautiful, and the service is impeccable. The servers and bartenders are very knowledgeable about wine. The early seating dinner menu cannot be beat - $17/pp for a three course meal and $20 bottles of wine. Highly recommend!
2015-12-10,5,Such a great spot for lunch wonderful location. The service was amazing the waiters/waitresses were very attentive! The food was great defiantly will come back
2015-12-07,4,Great food, great ambiance, and perfect for a romantic dinner.A bit pricy, but worth it!
2015-12-02,5,Went here the first time for a baby shower and it was top notch! Ive also gone in for drinks and the bar area is a great space.
2015-11-22,5,This is THE brunch destination in Hoboken for a reason. Their brunch menu has so many amazing options, it's unbelievable. The croissant french toast is a really delicious and unique take on the usual french toast, and the whipped cream it's served with is also great. The bacon is super crisp. The mimosas were made perfectly.I happened to visit only a few hours after a major water main break knocked out running water to virtually all of Hoboken. While many restaurants unfortunately had to close, and lots of people on the streets were carrying take-out pizza home for an improvised lunch, Amanda's not only stayed open, they didn't miss a beat at all. The entire menu was still available, and they still served glasses of water to every table as usual. Since they couldn't wash any dishes, they were able to quickly improvise and use plastic utensils and plates (that were made to look like real silverware and plates!). The restaurant was still packed, the service was still excellent, and food was still delicious. Our waiter apologized to us after brunch for needing to use plastic silverware - not that he had any need to apologize - and said that they weren't going to let a water main break get in the way of their usual business.Kudos to the owners and staff at Amanda's for not missing a beat despite not having any running water, when so many other restaurants shut their doors for the day.
2015-11-14,5,Yeah...it was as good as all the reviews said it would be. Stopped in for brunch this morning and we (party of 2 without reservations) were sat immediately. The steak and eggs with crispy home fries were delish.
2015-11-05,5,I fell in love with this place. The customer service/wait staff was amazing. They were so attentive and polite! The decor is so cute and the it had a lovely atmosphere. Not to mention their food and dessert! The salmon and chocolate lava cake won me over. Definitely will want to come back soon.
2015-11-01,3,It was very easy to get a reservation for brunch on a Saturday morning (I called about an hour before and arrived around noon). When we arrived, the place was not busy as I have seen it in other occasions however, for some reason our party of 5 felt very rushed and had to ask 3x for more coffee and water. When the manager approached us about whether or not we needed something, we let him know we'd ask a few times for a coffee and water refills with not luck and his response was "yes, we've been here... Will bring it right over" in a sort of condescending way. There were a few incidents of dishes breaking in the background...Overall poor experience... Fortunately our food tasted great! I will go back and recommend to friends. I just wanted like to bring this experience up to make the staff aware.
2015-10-25,4,Homey restaurant. Great for brunch. I tried the poached eggs over tomato and basil sauce for breakfast. It came with crunchy bread and small salad. Very tasty but I wish there were more. I'd come again to try crispy eggs!
2015-10-24,1,Jonathan is a total ass.  I was there for a baby shower brunch and he started hassling  the mother to be to move her gifts and could not wait 10 min for the car to pull up for use to u load them ourselves.  He had a terrible attitude and apparently was also a pain in the ass scheduling the venue with the hosts.
2015-10-24,4,I can always count on Amanda's to take my out of town guests. The ambiance, service and food are consistently good and the cocktails are fun. Great little bar at the entrance.
2015-10-10,5,My parents brought me here one time after work. They had been coming here once a week for the past month after moving into the area and I can now completely understand why. The food here is amazing and the ambiance is calm and quiet which is very much our style. I had the duck which was absolutely delicious. The waitress was also very informative and accommodating with drinks when speaking with me and my dad. I would say this place is definitely great for dinner, especially if it's one to have with a relative out of town or a more fancy date.
2015-10-08,5,Had wonderful experience! Service, foods and atmosphere are all great! One of the finest restaurant in Hoboken!
2015-10-02,3,I have heard such rave reviews for this place; honestly, I was pretty underwhelmed considering the price for brunch. I ordered the crispy eggs, and they were good - definitely unique - but they didn't blow me away. My partner got an omelette and he was also happy, but not extremely impressed. In addition, service was mixed; they were very attentive through the beginning of our meal, but I had to flag someone down twice for a coffee refill. Maybe they were just having an off day... It's a great space, and I really wanted to like it. I could imagine coming back for dinner. PS - The Sunday morning we were there, there were at least 4 large parties (two bridal showers, one birthday, and one event that was perhaps for business) - this place seems really equipped to deal with large parties.
2015-10-01,3,As newly Jersey people used to NYC brunch, Amanda's was a breath of fresh air. The food was on point - the Benedict was delicious and the bread basket - oh my. So good! My husband and I ventured out with our then 4 month old daughter on a perfect July Saturday and to our delight this restaurant was very accommodating with our stroller and car seat. We enjoyed the ambiance, the people, the service and of course the food. NYC brunch will always be near and dear to our hearts but a place like Amanda's promises a good experience every time - and there's something to say about that!
2015-09-27,3,I have been to Amanda's numerous times for brunch before, but this past Saturday I had a very mediocore experience due to the service. They really had no one there and it was pretty quiet for a Saturday afternoon. But the waiter we had, was really not pleased to be there and did not care to ask if we needed anything. The food is good but if the service is mediocore, it just ruins the brunch experience. Very disappointed and uncertain whether I will be coming back.
2015-09-23,5,I visit Amanda's a lot! Excellent food with top-notch service. I recommend the mushroom pasta.
2015-09-13,4,Magnificent atmosphere, nice staff, ok food, and you must make a reservation. I ordered an omelet and my wife had the vegi Spanish potato dish. The serving of orange juice was too small.
2015-09-12,5,Took my wife out on a date, visited Amanda's for the first time and WOW amazing.. Loved everything and so did she. We will definitely return back. Awesome chef at this place. Food, customer service, A+++
2015-09-07,5,Have been visiting Amandas for years - even got married there!Best restaurant in Hoboken. They make you feel like family. Food and service are always excellent. It's a really special place with a wonderful atmosphere.
2015-08-29,2,I have been here for brunch which was always great. I went here for dinner last night and was extremely disappointed. The menu is very limited and the portion size for an entree was tiny. I wanted to order a side of which there were only three options. I had the blue cheese potatoe dish which tasted of nothing else except blue cheese. For dinner I cannot recommend Amanda's with so many other great options around.
2015-08-25,4,I came here for brunch on Saturday. You walk into a house-setting like someone's quaint dining room. SO relaxing. Staff are calm and professional looking & speaking. It's a "proper" place, BUT casually-dressed patrons are welcome.We order the Spinach Salad under Appetizer. The dressing on the salad was AMAZINGGG. It tasted like shallots or onions. The dressing looks creamy & white. A VERY lightly dressed spinach salad accompanied with sliced almonds and diced green apple. I also ordered the Short Rib Hash and my friend ordered the Croissant French Toast. short rib hash - included some shredded short rib meat, small-diced potatoes, two poached eggs and small green lightly-dressed salad. Everything in this dish is delicious. I just wished for more short rib.croissant French toast - included two croissants, a few chunks of watermelon and mixed berry maple syrup. I don't know how the cooks/chef infused mixed berries into the maple syrup, but it tasted slightly sweeter than regular maple syrup. I felt like I was eating a plain croissant. Where is the egg-y flavor of a French toast batter. I supposed it was tossed in a light egg, French toast batter. I ordered a Watermelon Mimosa (name?). It had a light watermelon taste and refreshing taste. My friend who ordered coffee said the coffee is excellent.Bathrooms located downstairs. More seating/tables downstairs too.
2015-08-09,5,This place quickly caught my heart the minute I stepped inside. Inside decor was simply so adorable, with portraits and shades on the wall. I am not really an old-fashion type of person, nevertheless I can never say no to the acquaintance feeling it generated.We ordered egg Benedict with salmon, as well as the crispy egg. Especially recommend the crispy egg, with melting yolk hiding in the center and covered by the crispy crust. Benedict was not special, but it was accompanied by fruits and fries, so a full combo. The room was quickly filled when we finished our brunch.Attentive service so will definitely come back.
2015-08-05,5,Amanda's is wonderful.  The food is exceptional, the staff is professional and the ambiance is beautiful and makes you feel like you are having a meal in your own dining room.  My family and I have enjoyed many meals here.  We often come here for special occasions such as Christmas or Easter.  On one occasion my family got a private room to itself for brunch. I strongly recommend Amanda's.
2015-08-03,4,Amanda's isn't cheap, but it's pretty damn good for the price. Around $30 for a duck dish. Skin was crispy, a nice balance in seasoning. The salad was tasty as was the cous cous. Our server was such a pro. Someone at our table ordered a bottle of wine but wasn't aware he had to taste-test it. Our poor server stood waiting patiently, professionally, handling it very well. Would go again for a classy place in Hoboken.
2015-08-03,5,Amanda's is a gem of a place. The food was delicious, not a weak link during our meal! Our server was spot on and very attentive. I would highly recommend Amanda's...cannot beat Friday 1/2 price bottles of wine! Seriously! As for the Hudson Restaurant Menu, Slow Braised Lamb Crepe, Pork Loin & Key Lime Pie are the way to go, all were amazing! Get your azz in there, what are you waiting for??!!!
2015-07-26,4,What can I tell you about Amanda's that you don't already know or haven't read?  Just this - if you're looking for an upscale dinner experience in Hoboken with excellent service to boot - go here! For a special GNO, my friend and I went here for dinner last Friday and had a fantastic time.Yes, can't say enough about the courteous and efficient staff. Everyone was warm, friendly and quietly doing their job without being too rushed or slow - a perfect art. Water glasses were never empty and food was paced just right.We started off with two apps - the crab cake and the beet salad. Both were delicious. The crab cake was creamy, had a rich texture and was melt in the mouth flavorful. The beet salad was sweet and savory and had a sprinkling of goat cheese. Love at every bite.For the mains we both opted for the only pasta dish on the menu - Truffle Tagliolini with a mushroom reduction. Now this was a HUGE mountain of pasta - enough for three people at least.Taken aback with the portion size, we both dug in and did our best to make a dent! The pasta was a mix of a rich cream sauce and a generous helping of the roasted woodland mushrooms - a bit too rich for my taste, and I enjoyed the apps more. For desert we got the pineapple upside down cake with vanilla ice cream which was simply outstanding. Get it. Our waitress warned us it was too small to share, but IMHO it was just right to be shared between two people after a heavy dinner. Why did I dock one star? Because they have only one vegetarian dish on the menu! Even the soup of the day (spring vegetable) was cooked in a chicken broth. Come on Amanda's, how about adding at least one more to give some variety to the vegetarians who want to enjoy your cuisine?!
2015-07-12,5,Loved this place! We were late for our resersations, but they were still so friendly and attentive.  There wasn't anything to not like.  Nothing too inventive though in terms of culinary skills, but what they served was all spot on! Perfect for a nice date night out.
2015-07-05,4,Amanda's is your standard weekend brunch spot--the menu is limited but the essentials are all there (omelets, Eggs Benedict, club sandwich, and mimosas :-p mmm)My only tip would be to skip on the fresh fruit plate. It's nothing special, just cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapples and strawberries. For 7$ it's not worth it, especially since the same fruit is served along side your entree.
2015-06-21,5,Took my husband here for a Father's Day date night and we were really pleased with our experience. The staff was super professional. The restaurant was clean and a very relaxing atmosphere. It's very romantic in the back! I highly recommend it for a date night. The food was stunningly delicious. We will definitely be back! I recommend the duck or roasted chicken. They were both superb. As well as the molten chocolate cake. Enjoy!
2015-06-21,2,After seeing such great Yelp reviews about brunch at Amanda's we decided to try it and were very disappointed.We went for brunch and I ordered a "fresh squeezed orange juice." With 100% certainty I can say that Amanda's served me Tropicana. Next, we had "spring pea soup with lobster garnish." There was ZERO lobster in the soup. I have never been to a restaurant that is so cheap with their ingredients.I had the fried eggs, which were bland. We also had the omelet with tomato, ricotta and basil. However, there was three of the tiniest slivers of basil in the omelet and only three cherry tomatoes. The ricotta tasted like cream cheese. Again, this place is ridiculously cheap with their ingredients. I would definitely advise skipping Amanda's.
2015-06-05,5,We decided to try this place out after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp. We arrived without a reservation. Although you can make a reservation, we were told they accept walkins without one. We waited no more than 5 min before being seated. The hostess was very good and attentive. We ordered the polenta, which was REALLY good, perfect for a fall morning. The croissant French toast was rich and very good. I had the mushroom and vegetable omelet which was good--the hash browns as a side were crisp and seasoning just right. The fried egg dish--it wasn't horrible, but it was what one would expect. Perhaps the seasoning on the fried bread crumb topping could be seasoned better? Either way, I enjoyed the ambience of the place, drinks were good and I can't wait to come back for dinner.
2015-05-17,4,I came here recently for a friends birthday and was surprised when I walked in the door that he picked Amanda's. It had a bit of an old fashion feel to it, but once we dug in to our appetizers I understood why. We had the polenta and grilled octupus to start, both of which were delicious. I got the seared monkfish as my entree, which was very good as well. The group of four I was with all enjoyed their meals as well. The food was slow to come out, but we appreciated the time to catch up with one another and make a night of it rather than being rushed in and out in an hour. Overall, the food was great, the portion size was perfect, and the people working at the restaurant seemed to really care about those dining there.
2015-05-10,5,Oh, this place. To describe it in a few words: Not too pricey in my opinion (~$60 for two working college students) that got us Mimosas, an entree, and a desert to share. It seemed like a perfect place for a group of friends, families, or people who are dating to get brunch to.First, the decor made me think I was dining in someone's fancy house. But, let me get to the actual food experience.My friend and I ended up getting Mimosas and it all started going downhill (in an awesome way) from there.  I ended up getting the "Eggs in Purgatory." This dish really lived up to its expectations. I was amazed at how they kept the egg intact as I cut into my knife with it. In addition, the bread was a perfect addition as I literally turned the dish into a flatbread to be eaten with the sauce.For desert, we got the berry and brown butter tart: amazing. The warmth of the tart and the coldness of the ice cream mixed so well together. To be honest, I must be a sucker for ice cream, because if a restaurant serves good ice cream, I am a happy man.Overall, this place is amazing. It also has free parking (if you park at 12th and Hudson Streets at the Little Man Parking Deck).Food: 5/5Interior: 5/5Overall: 5/5
2015-05-09,5,Goodness, nothing makes me more excited than a good weekend brunch! I had the pleasure of going to Amanda's Restaurant with a friend and what a great experience. As soon as we sat down, we were given menus and a nice warm piece of bread for starters. I ordered the brunch classic staple: eggs Benedict with cured salmon and spinach because I truly believe that eggs Benedict can decide if the restaurant has good brunch and for me to explore other options later.  Boy did they do well on the dish! At Amanda's, they really know how to poach an egg perfectly; a yolk that is still runny but not to the point where you cut it and it bleeds all over your plate but one that moves but still stays near the egg. It even made my friend jealous that I ordered the Benedict while he ordered a separate simpler egg dish (called "Eggs in Purgatory"). We split the berry and brown butter tart for dessert and I knew this place had brunch down perfectly. I appreciate that you don't have to head over to the city for a great weekend brunch and Amanda's is one of the biggest reasons why. What's more, they offer free parking in crowded ol' Hoboken. Just make sure you park in the correct lot because my friend and I made the mistake of parking in a separate lot that they don't fulfill. Looking forward to returning soon!
2015-05-07,3,I'm giving this a 3 only because of the pricing and hype surrounding the restaurant. We went for Hudson restaurant week last fall. The food was delicious; however, when compared to similar priced restaurants in the area, I was hoping for a bit more innovative menu and "wow" factor. Overall a great meal.
2015-04-26,5,Had the eggs in purgatory (poached w/ tomato basil sauce) and my wife had the eggs Benedict. Both fantastic. Servers showed up just when you needed and did not "hover"Previously we've had 2 appies and shared the spicy seafood stew for dinner (on multiple occasions). Previous experiences were similarly fantastic. This is one of the few fine dining experiences that don't disappoint. The only time we've ever been disappointed was on Mother's Day. Which is why we don't go out on holidays.
2015-04-25,3,Its unfortunate but I have to give one of Hoboken's "gems" 3 stars. I have been there a few times and each time its always been just okay. Tonight, was one of my more disappointing experiences. Our service was average, though the water refills were off the charts. Unfortunately the food was not. Our appetizers were delicious so I thought we were on to something. Then my food arrived. I was in between the Monkfish and the Truffle Tagliolini. Waiter was very emphatic about the Truffle Tagliolini so I ordered it. Unfortunately when it arrived it was comparable to a Knorr pasta side. There were zero pieces of mushrooms and all I could explain as 1 or 2 mushrooms that had been pulverized to a dust and mixed with butter and a piece of greenery to top it off was all that accompanied the pasta, mind you this was $24. I gave it my all but was immediately disappointed. The waiter came over to ask about it since I was not eating and I shared my disappointment. He did offer to get me something else but at that point it was late and I had checked out. Instead of taking my plate, he left it to my side where it sat until everyone else's meals had been cleaned off. I think what made me most upset was when I saw the same dish being delivered after we had wrapped up to another table next to us piled with delicious mushrooms. Serious food envy. So yes, my dining experience tonight was just ok, hence the 3 stars. My last dining experience was for brunch and was the same, just ok. Not sure Ill be back or that Ill be able to recommend this establishment to others.
2015-04-23,5,By far my favorite brunch spot in Hoboken. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Food is always delicious!! I have never had a bad experience here. I would suggest making a reservation as it gets busy, but it's worth the wait if you just pop in! I always recommend Amanda's when friends ask for a restaurant recommendation.
2015-04-22,4,The dinner special at 5:30 is a great value.  The selections are limited but are all great.  The night I was there I had the cod fish.  You can order from the regular menu but it will cost more.  They also have a great selection of wine.
2015-04-14,5,Amanda's continues to impress and should be considered one of the best date spots in Hoboken. Everything from the service, to the atmosphere to the technical execution in the kitchen is great. Our meal: beet/goat cheese salad & grilled octopus followed by seared duck breast served with couscous & pan fried monkfish with cannellini beans in a buerre blanc finished with an apple strudel and a caramel popcorn topped "panna cotta" (I dont remember what they called it)I'm not going to bore anyone with insane details. All the dishes were great and presented well, our server Mike (I think) was awesome and the setting is great. The front dining rooms are intimate and cozy and make for a great setting. Cons: the warm apple strudel came out cold and the meal isn't free! Hah. Pros: everything else.
2015-04-10,4,amazing brunch! I had the cirspy egg with shiitake mushroom and it was nothing like I ever tasted. the egg is fried with batter and super crispty but it wasn't greasy or nauseating. it gets quite crowded but their food and service is great. can't speak for the lunch/dinner food but the brunch was quite delicious. the interior is a little tight but very cute and has a french feel.
2015-04-06,4,Amanda's is a really cozy, intimate restaurant. The décor is warm, and there's a fireplace in the main room which is really inviting. I ordered the Salmon, which was good, but maybe a little under seasoned. The desert was very good and overall I enjoyed everything.  I would go back.
2015-03-29,3,I really wanted to love it here. I've been dying to eat at Amanda's and finally got the chance this weekend with some friends. I loved the atmosphere. You feel like you're in someone's brownstone home. The decor has a 1920s feel. It's also deceivingly big. The staff are very nice and accommodating which goes a long way with me. As for our meal, I came in with big expectations based on reviews and recommendations but I was underwhelmed. The grilled octopus was over charred and rubbery. My striped bass over sautéed spinach was ok but was pretty bland. My friend barely finished her chicken she had the same complaint. Not opposed to giving it another shot but not rushing back anytime soon.
2015-03-29,3,Came for Sunday brunch. Didn't live up to the hype. It was just mediocre. Our waitress wasn't good and they  brought out burned food that was had to send back. They tried to make excuses instead of apologizing too, which just shows poor management.
2015-03-29,4,My fiance and I were looking for somewhere to go on a cold Saturday evening when we decided on a whim to stop by Amanda's. A friend of ours has been there quite often for brunch so we decided to give it a try. Even though it was a busy Saturday night, they took us right in and seated us at a table in a separate room downstairs. At first, I was like "oh no, they're sticking us in the basement," but it was nice. The room was quaint and smelled pleasant and looked newly remodeled. There was a faux fireplace with some beautiful stained glass.The waitstaff was also very pleasant. The service was prompt and the prices were reasonable. We had the special for the evening - rib eye steak with au gratin potatos and vegetables - and a separate order of steak (a sirloin). I think the waiter was a bit surprised to see us house a ton of meat, but the food was AMAZING. Coupled with a bottle of wine (Malbec) and topped off with molten lava cake, the night was incredible.We definitely recommend eating at Amanda's and we are going to go back fairly soon - probably for brunch! ^_^
2015-03-27,5,Great food, great service. Appreciative that the restaurant seeks to serve an adult clientele as opposed to bringing in young children.  Great adult atmosphere where you can enjoy a quality meal from quality staff.
2015-03-23,5,We love this restaurant for the early dinner special.  What a great deal on fine dining, excellent food and romantic ambiance.
2015-03-22,4,What a great surprise! You walk into a cozy bar with fireplace. You then enter into a beautiful Victorian style space. Not stuffy at all and views into the outdoors. Attentive wait staff and owner. Tables are spread out and you can actually have a conversation, a rarity in Hoboken. All 6 of us had positive food experiences! Free parking!!
2015-03-18,5,Really enjoyed the mix match hipster vibe, ordered the crispy eggs and they were so good with the prosciutto and mushrooms. This is brunch more on the lunch side, my husband had the steak and eggs and it was very good and a lot (he is a big guy). Pleasant service. Didn't love the bread basket, but everything else was good. No refills on drinks.
2015-03-15,5,It is one of my favorite brunch spots in Hoboken. Have had at least 3 of their brunch items and have loved every single one. Their croissant French Toast is so good, it's sinful. Today, I tried their crispy fried eggs with asparagus and prosciutto. It was the perfect combination of flavors. Brunch is a MUST! And enjoy their sun-dried tomato & pepper infused vodka Bloody Mary. It's so yummy!
2015-03-15,5,We hosted a lunch for 10 girls celebrating the upcoming birth of our daughter's first child.  Jonathan was extremely helpful with the planning, was very flexible with the menu, even with last minute changes, and provided a perfect private spot for the party on a busy Saturday afternoon.  They printed a special menu which included a choice of two appetizers, three entrees and several desserts.  We chose the grilled salmon, seared skirt steak and quiche/salad.  All were ordered, all were excellent.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The atmosphere was cozy.  A wonderful experience at Amanda's.
2015-03-06,5,My boyfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day and this place exceeded our expectations.The ambiance of the restaurant was great, it was very busy but not too noisy and there was a fireplace right when you walk in, which automatically sets the tone. We were immediately greeted by Amanda herself, who was extremely humble, friendly and professional. The meals were a little pricey and there was a pre-fixe menu for the holiday but everything we had was great. The chocolate toffee bar for dessert is incredible. The service was perfect and Amanda came by at the end of the meal to ask how everything was and to thank us for coming.Overall, we absolutely loved the food, service, and intimate ambiance. This is definitely our new "special occasion" restaurant.
2015-03-03,4,Very nice brunch.  Has an old-fashioned, highfalutin' decor, (i.e., seems like a nice place for "high tea", meal served on nice china), but the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable for someone who is acclimated to NYC pricing.  Service was great. No complaints here! Felt like you were eating brunch in a Victorian living room, but nonetheless was very comfortable.
2015-03-02,4,Not ecstatic that my first time here was for a price-fix menu however, that doesn't undermine the quality of the food and service we received. The dim lighting might have been a bit excessive but I understand trying to set the mood for Valentine's Day. All the food was great, and I especially loved when they poured the broth to my clam chowder table side - classy. All the fishes were cooked perfectly and the sauces were on point. The shortcake in my dessert however, didn't seem fresh; it was rather hard to cut into. Overall it was delicious but I feel, it was also a little over priced. I think we could have had the same quality menu for $20/15 a person cheaper. Still a Hoboken top-5 and must-try if you're only around for a couple of days. I definitely will be going back for brunch and to choose from the full range of the dinner menu.
2015-02-24,4,friendly staff, great food.  the only issue I had was some of my greens in my salad were wilted.  But the food nonetheless is phenomenal!
2015-02-19,5,Amanda's is a great place to go for brunch! Beatiful warm decor but can get crazy busy so definitely get there early! Omeletes are delicous and the mimosas are even better!
2015-02-18,5,Came for saturday brunch and was very pleasantly surprised! The food was yummy, the service was so polite and so accomodating and the restaurant itself was so cute and pretty inside. will definitely be coming back!
2015-02-14,2,Traveled here all the way from Central Jersey for a 5 star Valentine's Day meal tonight and was deeply disappointed.  Don't get me wrong the place had a nice decor, great customer service, and had a complimentary parking deck which was a nice walk away from the restaurant BUT if my belly ain't happy everything else doesn't matter. As an appetizer I ordered the strawberry crispy goat cheese salad with almonds, it was a small portion but definitely satisfying.  My husband ordered the octopus, potatoes, and arugala and loved it.  The meal started off very good. We both were thinking the meal can only get better from here... For my main course I ordered the sea bass and my husband ordered the petite filet. The sea bass had no flavor.  I could have made it better at my house.  My husband ordered the petite filet medium rare and it came out medium to medium well - and tasted like a plain steak. If I wanted a plain steak I could have ordered one at Outback Steakhouse that would have been seasoned with at least salt and pepper.The toffee chocolate dessert was delicious. BUT when I go out to spend big bucks...you expect to be FULL and love every bite, especially the bulk of the meal (AKA the main course).I am tiny girl with a big appetite. I would probably only come back here for dessert if I happen to be walking past the restaurant or I would try it again but not on Valentine's Day.
2015-02-14,3,Follow the laws of Boojie to have a good meal here.the place has an immediate boojie vibe, so if thats your thing you will be happy. My girlfriend and I had our valentine's day brunch here because, well, that's what you do on valentine's day (boojie things). To properly follow boojie law one must order boojie items, you will be rewarded for doing so. Drinks: I got a bloody mary, it was a small glass and not very good. My girl got a boojie bellini, it was good.Food: the brunch menu was nice and succinct. My girl ordered the boojie croissant french toast, it was delicious.  I ordered a ham and swiss omelet,  it was not bad but entirely flavorless. To be fair the non boojie bacon side was very good...  but it was boojiely priced!I think the takeaway is if you follow the principles of being boojie, you will enjoy your meal!
2015-02-14,5,I really liked Sunday Brunch here. The prices are fair and the quality is GREAT. I had Eggs Benedict and it was perfect. The servers are very attentive and the atmosphere is very clean. I hope to return soon. This place is very family friendly! Perfect place for after church! Enjoy!
2015-02-13,4,Their brunch is perfect. Menu is reasonably priced and the staff is amazing! It is a very quaint little place. Perfect for date night or brunch with friends.
2015-02-11,5,Had a work dinner here. Got to try the chicken and biscuit appetizer, mixed green salad, and glazed salmon over lobster mashed potatoes. All were delicious! The ambiance is warm and cozy. It was a lovely experience.
2015-02-08,4,This place is super cozy and really cool inside. Went for dinner, haven't tried brunch yet. The food was very good.. We had the lamb meatballs to start, then the pork chop and sirloin. The pork chop was better than the sirloin, which I didn't love. The highlight was dessert... The banana cake and chocolate cake were ammmmazing. Service does make you feel a little rushed but I still highly recommend this place.
2015-02-04,3,I had the Steak Tartar to start. It was good with great flavor. For my entrée I had Smoked Duck Pastrami Carbonara. I wasn't really impressed with this dish. For dessert I had the Chocolate Toffee Bar. This dessert was great and the Raspberry Sorbet went perfect with the toffee bar. My husband had the Baby Spinach Salad to start which he enjoyed. For his entrée he had the Provençal Braised Chicken. The chicken was cooked perfect but the flavors were a little bland. For dessert he had the Almond Pound Cake which was delicious. The ambiance is a little dated and the tables are quite small but the service was great.
2015-02-03,4,Dined her on a Saturday night and I was extremely impressed, mostly with the ambiance and décor. Loved walking in on a cold night to a room with a small bar and a wood fire burning. It was extremely cozy and welcoming. This place must be a home, converted into restaurant. There are about 4 rooms that make up the entire restaurant, and the basement level which is where the coat check is and where private parties are held. I heard that in the warm weather months, there is a back patio, not sure if seating is available there or not. When you are in Amanda's, it is hard to believe you are Hoboken. This is by far the best service I have received in Hoboken and the best crowd (older, sophisticated). For an appetizer, my boyfriend ordered the polenta and loved it. Fresh bread was served as well, which was very good. For dinner I ordered the grilled sirloin, I must say it was a little tough, but the red wine sauce gave it some much needed flavor. The presentation of my meal was great as well. There were a lot of little details that wowed me with this place, for example, each place setting has a different (decorated) plate. You can tell this restaurant pays close attention to detail. Everyone we interacted with, especially the hostess, were extremely friendly, accommodating, and polite. The only flaw I found about this restaurant is that there is 1 bartender for the entire restaurant. Yes 1. We came in first to have a drink and waited about 20 minutes before being served. Another side note that the menu is very small, but that isn't always a bad thing! So if you are looking for a classy dinner in Hoboken, this is your place to go!
2015-02-01,2,In between here, the food was better than average, our waiter was brilliant, but it was Super bowl night so quiet... We were informed it was Restaurant Week which was cool, I assume that since 2 of the 3 sides were unavailable, as were half the appetizers, and the best entrees they'd be flexible.. But  "no".. Order from one side or other! Disappointing to be honest...but the food we were "allowed" to choose was very  tasty.
2015-02-01,2,Just finished breakfast here. We ordered the salmon eggs Benedict and the steak and eggs. The salmon eggs Benedict was not good - way overly salted, the eggs were overcooked and were not runny, and the English muffin was burnt. The steak and eggs was ok. We ordered the steak medium and it came out well done. The over medium eggs came out correctly and were as expected. The atmosphere? Uncomfortably pretentious and fake. The host wouldn't even greet us at the door, but talked to us across the dining room amidst other customers. It's a shame the food did not live up to other reviews or its own pretentious attitude. The service is what saved this place from getting a 1 star review. Our waitress was solid - attentive, courteous, but not overwhelming. Also the other help kept our drinks filled whenever they were half empty. Unfortunately, the best part of breakfast was the cappuccino. We will not be coming back when we would rather have breakfast at iHop for half the price while food quality and taste are what you can expect.
2015-01-31,3,Amanda's used to be a great date night spot. Always great food and a formal, but not stuffy atmosphere. The atmosphere has stayed the same, but the food is just okay now. The mixed salad had nothing special to make it stand out. The blue cheese mashed potatos didn't taste of blue cheese and were bland because of that fact. It was all just okay, nothing special. Considering the decline in the quality of food coupled with the high prices, I would find some place else to go.
2015-01-28,2,Extremely overrated. Went there for brunch. Very disappointed with very limited menu. They told us they ran out of bread. How do you run out of bread on a Sunday for brunch? Food was fine but overhyped and overpriced for bacon and eggs.
2015-01-25,4,After a partner (with great taste) at my firm raved about Amanda's, I knew I had to try it. The atmosphere was adorable! I didn't feel like I was in Hoboken at all. We didn't have a reservation, but were seated without an issue later on a Friday evening. I ordered the salmon and my husband had the chicken. Both were delicious. He raved about how great his chicken was. We shared the dessert pudding, which was also great. The only downside of the night was the service. We felt very rushed, even though there was not a wait for tables. It felt like our waiter was hovering over the table to take things away, and it made us uncomfortable. I can't wait to come back for brunch, or the early bird wine pairing!
2015-01-22,5,I came to eat the early bird dinner special with my boyfriend for our 2nd anniversary. The cozy decor and excellent service really made our day special! For starters, I had the polenta with the arugula pesto sauce and my boyfriend had the soup of the day. Both were excellent. For our entrees, I had the grilled salmon and he had the BBQ skirt steak, both were very delicious. As for dessert we had the chocolate mousse. I definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a romantic date and the early bird special is really a great deal.
2015-01-21,3,Came here for a weekend brunch and the food was actually very good. The service was also descent. They were prompt and somewhat attentive. I had the Crispy Eggs with Asparagus, Shiitake Mushrooms, Prosciutto and Parmesan Fonduta which was very tasty. Never had "crispy" eggs before but was good. The decor is very warm and somewhat romantic. Now...why am I NOT giving this venue 5 stars...at no point did any of the staff "smile"...I mean at all. While they acted professionally, they looked miserable. Hopefully, this review will help the staff or management to smile more!
2015-01-11,5,Quite possibly the best restaurant in Hoboken! Everything is delicious. I have been twice in the past few months and have not been disappointed. Would highly recommend this place for entertaining friends and family...that you like!
2015-01-03,5,We were looking for a brunch spot, walking down the street, stumbled upon this amazing place. They have done a fabulous job by creating this restaurant.  Everything is just perfect and right! Service is wonderful, food is delicious although we've only tried brunch dishes, but no doubts everything else would be as good. Definitely coming back.
2015-01-03,5,Perfect Saturday brunch! Very cozy and warm place with nice decor. Food was great, steak was just as I loved it. The only downside is that it seems to be always very crowded. Only few tables for two, most tables for large groups and that's why it get very very loud in there. Despite all that, we will come back for sure!
2014-12-28,4,Came for brunch with friends and I had the creamy polenta with fruit and the crispy eggs. Totally delicious!! Mimosas were great too. That bread is amazing!! I'm still thinking about it. Will def come again :)
2014-12-24,5,We come here ever Mother's Day, and the food is on point. The atmosphere is is welcoming. Highly recommend this for the next dinner outing.
2014-12-21,3,Food was delicious but serves on the other hand stunk. I had three serves and felt rushed a soon as I sat down and was handed a menu. Waiter number two came after a ten minute wait and no one taking a drink order, which I than order drink and food. I guess here you are only allowed one mimosas with your meal because I didn't see another server until I was done with my brunch. Mid way thru the meal I finished both my coffee and mimosa with barely no water left. Have to say with all the staff at hand that Amanda's need to tell them that they need to be more attentive to their customers.
2014-12-15,4,We went for a Christmas dinner with colleagues. I like the place. Lot of space, classy atmosphere, good food, great service. The 4 stars is a bit of a stretch based on the food (average salad and desert) but the ambience and service made it up.
2014-12-14,5,One of my favorite brunch spots in Hoboken. Fried eggs with asparagus is my favorite dish. It comes with salad and prosciutto and shataki mushrooms. This dish is very well prepared as all the components complements one another. I always lick the plate clean every time I get this dish.For those with sweet tooth, I recommend croissant French toast which is very delicious.We were sitting next to another couple who ordered the croissant French toast to share and each got an order of fried eggs with asparagus -for those who have a bigger appetite, this is the way to go! (We are totally ordering 3 plates next time we go!)
2014-12-11,1,I went for brunch last Sunday and put my coat in the coat check with my leather cashmere gloves in the pockets.  When my coat was returned, my gloves were mysteriously gone.  I immediately told someone and I got yelled at and blamed for it, and that they're not responsible for any lost or stolen items.  As the owner Eugene was yelling at me - he called me racist for blaming them.Also - my table was right behind the host stand and I heard a lady who had returned in and said that the coat check gave her the wrong scarf and was returning it.  Bottom line. DO NOT CHECK YOUR COAT - YOU WILL REGRET IT.
2014-12-08,5,Went to Amanda's for dinner for two this past weekend - as soon as I walked in the atmosphere had me floored. Amanda's look's like someones gorgeous, well-to-do built-in-the-1920s home, complete with roaring fireplace, family portraits and china cabinets, but not overdone. I also went at Christmastime and the place was decked out for the holiday while playing classic Christmas music over the sound system. I loved every second of it and couldn't stop looking around! On to the food - for apps we had the lamb meatballs which were great and had an amazing sauce. As an entree I had the duck with butternut squash, mustard greens and pancetta as a side which was wonderful, I also had a bite of the seared tuna entree and it was super flavorful. For dessert we shared a salted caramel pudding which is everything I want in a dessert - smooth and not too sweet, and I also loved the chocolate on the bottom which wasn't too overwhelming. I will definitely be back! Hopefully for brunch next time.
2014-12-04,5,My boyfriend and I came here for a quiet Wednesday night birthday dinner. The restaurant is in a charming and welcoming old home. Service was very good. I had the beet salad to start which was delicious. I don't usually like fennel but the way this was prepared really added to the salad and I ate it all! He had the arugula salad which he also enjoyed. For mains I had the duck breast and he had the bass. The duck break was perfectly cooked. Very flavorful and juicy with some nice crispy skin. Mustard greens were also very prepared. He also really liked his bass. I didn't taste it because I was so happy with my food :-)  They were also kind enough to bring us a side of the lobster mashed potatoes.  They were so creamy with just the right amount of lobster! The key lime pie for dessert for very rich and probably the best key lime pie I have ever had. We will definitely be coming back! I also noticed some nice private rooms which could be reserved for family style seating with large groups.
2014-11-17,4,Made a reservation on Yelp 30 minutes before going, perfect! When we arrived, there was a line and once we checked in the hostess called our name next. I ordered the sweet pepper and cream cheese omelet. It was very good. My friend had the eggs benedict, also very good. Bloody Mary was delicious! The atmosphere is very nice and classy, can't wait to come back!
2014-11-10,4,My girlfriend and I were wandering about Hoboken Saturday (11/8) evening when we saw Amandas. We decided to give it a try. Well, sometimes, randomness pays off. Not only did they have a table, but the food was outstanding - especially the truffle pasta. Love the atmosphere, too. It was quite busy but felt comfortable, warm, and cozy.
2014-11-09,4,We had been to Amanda's many times before, but this time something felt a little different. There had been a small shift, though not in the service or the quality of ingredients. But it was the menu. Amanda's does a few things very well, each dish may shift with the seasons, but these items are to be anticipated on the menu. But this time, some of these were indeed listed, but with a twist. As always, a polenta starter is featured on the menu, though this time it was tipped with spicy sausage ragu, mache and parmesan. The polenta was creamy and warm, as expected, but the ragu was multifaceted and unfortunately, way cold.The entrees too, were in typical form (starch, veggie, protein), but a little different. The grilled salmon was served with lobster mashed potatoes, flanked by buttery green beans. A slight adjustment to the potatoes resulted in creamy luxury.Similarly, the seabass perched on garlicky sautéed spinach and a quinoa risotto, added creativity. Instead of the classic risotto or even a grain, Amanda's new vision offered an inventive twist.The duck dish, complete with maple-roasted butternut squash, bacon lardons and wilted mustard greens, had sweet, earthy, and salty notes that made everything sparkle.Even dessert brought something uncharacteristic. A banana cake with caramel ice cream felt like bananas fosters on the tongue, a butterscotch pudding layered with cookies and creams in a jar, and the chocolate molten cake, were classic and simple and in some ways, recreated.  Sometimes the key to consistency is a kind of monotony and paucity of innovation. The new turns have created a more exciting experience, while replicating the high standards and quality.
2014-11-08,5,Came with the family for brunch; A+. The place is clean and has a nice warm leaving room decor. Service on point.I had Eggs Norwegian,  french toast (with croissant!).... My wife had some poach eggs  with crab. Everything was good. If u dont feel like cooking brunch, well thats the spot.
2014-11-05,5,Food and service were great!  Very helpful staff.  Made a reservation and got there early and was able to sit for a while.  Love the decor.  Food was so good, wish I could've fit it all in my stomach!
2014-11-04,5,I came here for a nursing conference and it was so good. Everything was great even the bread and butter. The appetizers were interesting but still delicious. The bread was soft and warm. I had the filet mignon and it was amazing. So good, but I was too full to finish it. I also had the chocolate lava cake which was great with the ice cream. It's a great place and a little hidden in Hoboken. Pricey but worth it.
2014-10-10,4,(Reviewing regular dinner)We came here for dinner with friends and had an enjoyable meal. I do not think that it is AS GOOD as their brunch (which is still the best in Hoboken) but it is enjoyable. We had a pretty good assortment of food, ranging from fish to chicken to steak, and everything was very good. In fact, there really is not anything that I can think of that was wrong with the meal (other than my beer being warm, due to a "new keg").However, I don't think the food justifies the prices. This place is definitely more upscale, and the food is good, but the prices are just a bit too high for what is served. The prices, in and of themselves, will make me think twice when I consider another meal (that isn't brunch).
2014-10-07,4,Amanda's is great for a romantic dinner. It's a restaurant set In a historic style house, it's great.  They have delicious food and a pretty decent 3 course promotion during restaurant week.Perfect spot for breakfast or a brunch with the girls. I gave it four stars only because it's a bit costly. However, it is in Hoboken and it comes with the price of being there. It's located in Washington street, not far from many cool shops or the water front for a stroll along the NYC skyline.
2014-10-05,5,I really love Amanda's. This past saturday i came here to try their brunch menu. Ive been here before but only for the early dinner special. Im so sad i havent been brunching here sooner!!Everything is priced between $11-14 per brunch entree. I chose the crispy eggs with proscuitto since it sounded so unique and the waitress recommended it as well. It was two crispy fried eggs (no idea how they batter them) with sliced proscuitto and a side salad with a light vinagrette. The egg was very rich and heavy so the salad was the perfect refreshing balance on the plate. They had a nice tea selection which was great because i wasnt in the mood for coffee. My boyfriend got one of the omelettes that came with home fried potatoes and fresh fruit. Definitely worth the price!! Probably the classiest brunch atmosphere in Hoboken.
2014-10-04,5,Lovely place, great food and the waiters are well trained. Pleasant place, great music. We were there for the early dinner and we ate well, deliciously, abundantly and for a good price. My meat was tender and juicy and that creamy polenta is a great asset. Liked the way they serve the soup on the plate at the moment it arrives and my lemon tarte at the end was superb. Will definitely go back as it's difficult to find such good places nowadays.
2014-10-03,5,My partner and I went out for a nice Saturday dinner at Amanda's, and found the food very tasty and we had a great meal.I will say that Amanda's has validated parking about three blocks away. That's a great benefit, since the flat fee is $25. Basically, that's an entrée.Amanda's is a somewhat intimate restaurant, but you'd still be able to hear everyone's conversations. It was about 9 o'clock on a Saturday, and it wasn't that busy. Not sure if that's an indication of its popularity, or just that it was late. I will say that the main street of Hoboken basically closes down at 11 o'clock, so all these places were pretty empty.The food is definitely the standout here. The butternut squash soup had some heat and (probably) mole somewhere in it. Very delicious. The sea bass I ordered was nice and crispy, but the pickled scallions on top cut down on its crispiness. The pork shank that my partner ordered was delicious. A great portion, and perfectly cooked. It's so easy to overdo pork, but the center was a soft pink. Very good.The drinks were also very original and delicious here. Rye with molasses was a great drink.Service was fine, but our particular server wasn't as knowledgeable as I would have hoped. Couldn't really recommend any wine.Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Amanda's. The food was very good. It's a bit pricey, that's for sure, but our experienced matched the value.
2014-09-29,4,Everyone raves about this place for brunch, literally you can't talk to anyone who has lived in Hoboken and not hear them mention this place.  They also state that if you want to get in for brunch then you better make a reservation.  We decided to buck the trend and try this spot for dinner.  Walking in I was immediately excited because the place was clean, busy, old school decorated, and not that noisy based on the amount of people that were dining.  We were seated immediately and our server took our drink order while we looked over the menu.  They have a full bar and pretty decent wine list, but we opted for cocktails which were mixed well.  They had some sort of large party going on so it seemed like servers were constantly running around.  No dinner specials, which I thought was bizzare but hey if your menu is that good then who needs specials.  We started with the muscles which the low point of the meal.  The broth was bland and lacked any distinct flavor.  The mussels themselves were a bit over done.  I'd skip them and try something else.  The entree's on the other hand were excellent.  My chicken was cooked perfectly and was very juicy.  My date loved the duck and just kept telling me how "this is how duck is supposed to be done."  The little presentation table side where they pour the sauce for you dish onto the plate was a nice touch.  The banana cake was a great finish.  The true test of service is if the water glass ever gets empty and this place passed with flying colors.
2014-09-16,4,Great date place.  A little on the expensive and fancy side but excellent food and service.
2014-08-28,5,Ahhh Amanda's! I wish you were close to me. This is my favorite American restaurant in Hoboken. Everything is good in here. Their brunch menu is just delicious. Had the egg Benedict over crab cakes. Sooo good! I cannot wait to go back. For dessert we had the NUTELLA CHEESECAKE! Too die for! Terrific dessert! Can't wait to go back. Our waitress was so kind and very helpful. I Really admire how she works. I'm in the same business and she definitely owned that tip!
2014-08-19,3,Pretty good. Service was above average and the food was above average as well relative to the prices. We were somewhat limited since we went with the dinner special choice. Would go back again to try something different.
2014-08-16,4,Love love love this place! This is the #1 brunch place around here. Such a classy vibe + great food. I always order the poached eggs-amazing. Also try the creamy polenta when getting brunch! So good. I highly recommend this place.
2014-08-06,2,Foreword: I don't eat red meat or pork, and I've never been to Amanda's for brunch. From my experiences here, I have come to the conclusion that this is not a restaurant to go to for dinner if you do not eat meat. That being said, for the amount of money you spend, they should be able to cook any kind of seafood on the menu FLAWLESSLY and the QUALITY of it better be top notch.I came here last night for Hudson Restaurant week to treat my grandfather to dinner for his birthday (he's a big foodie). He ordered the Sausage Ragu Polenta, which he enjoyed so much that he practically licked the plate clean! For his entree he ordered the skirt steak with bacon braised kale and again, thoroughly enjoyed it even as someone who HATES kale. For dessert he ordered the Ginger Panna Cotta, which we both shared and it was creamy, light and flavorful. And not too sweet!I did not order from the Restaurant Week menu. I ordered the Mixed Greens Salad ($8) and I was thoroughly surprised at how much I enjoyed the dressing, as well as how large it was. For my entree I ordered the Spicy Seafood Stew with mussels, clam, shrimp and fish in a tomato broth. I have NEVER in my life been served shrimp that were so overcooked. They were tough to chew and swallow. I've gotten better cooked shrimp from a neighboring chinese/japanese food restaurant when I order Shrimp Noodle Soup. The mussels were definitely not P.E.I.'s and the clams were the size of DIMES. All overcooked and served in a tasteless tomato water (no, I will not even call it a broth).I would have sent the whole dish back if I wasn't enjoying the conversation with my grandfather so much to not want to interrupt the mood and the evening.Needless to say, I will never be going back to Amanda's unless it's to treat a meat-eating friend/relative to a tasty meal during Restaurant Week.  And when I do, I will stick with their bread and $8 mixed greens salad for my meal.
2014-08-04,5,Definitely one of the classiest restaurants in Hoboken. For what you get, it is actually probably one of the better bargains too.
2014-08-04,4,boyfriend and I came here for dinner.  the atmosphere- felt like you were in a house- very homey. even the dishes that were on the table when we sat down were mismatched. food was good...i would say like 7/10- nothing mind blowing but we enjoyed it.  it was a really relaxing dinner and we had a nice time :)
2014-07-31,1,This was one of the worst meals I have ever eaten. It was restaurant week in NY this week and we tried their set menu for $36 aprox. I ordered Polenta to begin with and it was rubbery and then the roast chicken entree arrived cold and tasted very strange. I didn't eat it, leaving it deliberately on one side of my plate, hoping one of the waiters would notice my disgust. It finally happened and once my concerns had been related to management, a nice gentleman arrived with an offer to half my bill, not comp it, but half it! I was in no mood to argue and agreed. Desert, Key Lime Pie, then arrived and it was bland and gooey. I would rate this as one of the worst meals ever, and would never entertain going back to this place again. It was also very noisy and very over priced for the quality of food on offer.
2014-07-29,4,We had a great meal last night here for Hudson restaurant week. I got the shrimp appetizer, skirt steak entree, and blueberry lemon tart for dessert. I thought everything was fantastic. The steak entree was huge and came pre-sliced and served with kale and mashed potatoes. I ate every bite. The service was great too. The hostess, bartender, and waitress were all very sweet. We also each ordered one glass of wine. The average glass was $13 so our meal came to $109 before tax and tip. It is definitely very pricey for Hoboken but I would recommend checking it out at least once!
2014-07-06,4,I went for breakfast this morning and at the beginning they were a little disorganized with the order but the food is very good. The bread is soft and the cheesecake is amazing.
2014-06-07,3,First time visit. Wonderful ambience! Tremendous service! Had pork Eggs Benedict and Lobster Bisque. Bisque was delicious! Eggs were cold so that sort of ruined the mood. :(    Otherwise all was great!
2014-05-24,5,I went here with my parents for my college graduation dinner. This place is classy, with nice decor, but the tables are somewhat cramped as far as legroom goes. Everyone in my party got a different dish and everything was absolutely outstanding. We also had no difficulties making substitutions from the "default" sides that were listed with our meals. Our waiter was attentive, and for dessert there was even I even had congratulations spelled out on my plate in chocolate sauce! This place is rather pricey, but it's the best food and service I've ever had in Hoboken.
2014-05-19,5,great tapas, atmosphere is perfect for groups and or a couple to talk and be able to see one another :) good location in the upper west side of NYC. highly recommended.
2014-05-19,5,We had not eaten there for awhile so the place was fresh in ou r minds. After a drink at the bar,a well made martini and Cosmo, we seated  seated, hande menus and the server explained the specials. I ordered the pork belly special appetizerwhich was wonderful and  then the roasted monkfish in a carrot purée with endive and onions that was decisions.  My  wife had  had  the creamy polenta and then the filet mignon  which she loved. For dessert we had  the berry crisp with vanilla ice cream.  Everything was very good and portion size was excellent.We also ordered a bottle of wine, even with that the price of the meal was well worth it. Lastly the service was superb
2014-05-17,4,I came here for my cousin's baby shower brunch and the food was delish. There were a lot of us that went and N0T one person in our group had any complaints. Everyone was satisfied about what they ordered. I would go  again when I'm in the area.
2014-05-17,2,Our nephew made reservations here for a family dinner to celebrate hubby's birthday.  The restaurant was homey (it is a converted brownstone, after all) and seemed to attract multi-generational families which is always nice to see.  Music from the 70's and 80's.  Food was ok.  Three of us ordered cod but our servicer came back and said they only had two orders left (this on a Sunday at 7:30pm; I thought cod was their most popular dish so was surprised that they were out).  The cod, not a huge piece of fish, was plated on top of a huge pile of mashed potatoes.  All in all, food and service were only ok.  If you want to be time-warped backed to the 80's, then this may be your kind of place.  It wasn't for me.
2014-05-13,3,Came for brunch. They were busy and seemed a little disorganized. The food was okay...Not great for the price.My husband's coffee cup sat empty most of the meal - which is unacceptable for a $3 cup of coffee.I had a large piece of an avocado peel with the sticker still on it in my salad.I'm interested in trying it for lunch or dinner, but for brunch, I won't be back. A little pricey.
2014-05-12,1,This place came as a suggestion to try from our realtor when we were looking for a new home.. Figured its got to be good if its fromour realtor.. you know they are trying to sell us on the area right?! Well no.. this place was just super generic and nothing special at all. I had the eggs benedict and the gf had the omelette. Both were very plain and lacked the slightest hint of salt. The star of my meal was the bloody mary which was still only generic. For the pirce (which is wasnt high at all) id expect a bit better food... On to the next..
2014-05-11,2,Took my boyfriend here for dinner on a friday night for his birthday.  Have been waiting to come here since moving to hoboken in December as the restaurant is supposed to be one of the best here in Hoboken.  In my opinion, the food is very mediocre and overpriced.  I do not mind spending money on a good meal at all but this meal was just eh. We started with two small salads- nothing special.  As an entree, my boyfriend had the sirloin ($34 dollars - would have been acceptable if it was more like $25) which had a monster vein running through it with a crunchy burnt crust on it.  The meat itself unfortunately was no better than something you may find at a friends BBQ.  His potatoes au gratin were delicious though. I had the cod ($28 dollars - would have been acceptable at $20), which was somewhat crunchy and rubbery at the same time.  Flavors on both meals were just okay. As for the service, there was atleast 10 people working in the dining room, however none of which were attentive enough to refill our wine glasses/water or take our plates once our meals were finished.  We literally sat there and saw our waiter and multiple bus boys walk by us 10 times for a good twenty minutes doing nothing with our plates that were waiting to be picked up. Mind you, this place was not that busy and I am very patient as I have worked in many restaurants in my life and also I had no reason to rush on this particular night.  My boyfriend who always needs a dessert, was indifferent about ordering one because the meal had already taken so long and we were just over it.  I forced him to get the molten cake (not worth getting at all) because about an hour before i called to ask them to either put a candle in his dessert or write happy birthday or anything they could do.  Very nicely, the host on the phone took his name down and said, "absolutely, we will do something, see you soon".  So of course the cake comes with nothing on it and I just laughed and told my boyfriend what had happened.  No big deal, we finished up, asked for the check and instead of the check, minutes later a bowl of ice cream comes with a candle.  Whattt??? We had dessert, we want to go home now.  So strange, we laughed a little harder and finally got the check.  Unfortunately, this was our first and last time at Amanda's.  Our mediocre dinner totaled $133.00 before tip.  For the equal price or less, just jump on the Path and head into NYC for an entirely better experience.
2014-05-04,5,Great place for a nice dinner. It's roomy, has a nice home-style feeling to it. Great for special occasions
2014-05-03,4,A great Hoboken bistro with reliably good food and a comfortable, upscale but not pretentious feel. Good for a date night.
2014-04-27,5,People are very nice. The bread you get on the side is delicious. Their smoked salmon is always fresh, and cheese cake is the best.
2014-04-19,5,5 of 5 for the price point. Felt like The Great Gatsby would have eaten here. 1920s feel, dark wood, chandeliers. Sensational food. One of my two favorite places in Hoboken.
2014-04-19,4,Met some friends for a birthday dinner at Amanda's - we had such a good meal. Great wine list, great atmosphere and the Grilled Double Cut Pork Chop was fantastic.
2014-04-14,5,Took my mom here for her birthday and it was incredible. The polenta was delicious. I've had better pork chops though. I think because these were so thick the flavor couldn't be as abundant, but it was still very good. I can't wait to come back and try more of their foodThe ambience is really nice, very homey and romantic.Cheers!
2014-04-10,5,Had my daughter's baby shower here recently. Everything was wonderful from soup to nuts. The management and the service was impeccable. The food and drinks amazing. We had the Sunday brunch for 30 people and I could not have asked for more.
2014-04-08,5,This place is adorable. My boyfriend took me here for a romantic date night and I was oh-so pleased. They first serve yummy warm bread rolls, and cute little butter balls.I ordered the salmon over lentils which was cooked to perfection - cleaned my plate!We ended the meal with their chocolate molten lava cake you gottta try it! So gooey and delicious.Love this place.
2014-04-01,5,This is more of 4 1/2 star rating, and not quite 5 stars, but since I can't give half stars I'm rounding up. Amanda's is a really awesome spot in Hoboken. Probably the most upscale dining in Hoboken besides Chucharamama and Fig Tree. It's very hard to give a full five stars because Hoboken only has a handful of places like this so I'm really just comparing them to each other. We came here on a Thurs night, and had an awesome private table. Our waiter was really nice and was very open with his suggestions on what to eat and drink. My fiance and I started with a few salads (beet and frizze). For entrees I had the pan roasted cod. It was a good portion size and had a ton of flavor. The fish was cooked to perfection and the accompaniments accented the dish well. My fiance had the short rib, which were braised in red wine and some other things I can't remember off the top of my head. It was excellent. For dessert they brought us a complimentary chocolate lava cake. I mean you can't go wrong with that, right?Amanda's def has their act together. Excellent atmosphere, not too expensive, great dinner and drink options and a staff that seams to enjoy working there. I'm def going back, and can't believe I've never been before.
2014-03-29,5,Came with here with a group of 6 ladies and had a blast. Drinks were good and food was great. Nice atmosphere and excellent service. Fun for an active night out or intimate dinner.
2014-03-29,4,We had the special prefix early seating 5 and 530 pm. I liked that they also gave us the regular menu. The prefix early special was indeed special....two meals 32.00. Includes appetizer, entree, and desert. Everything was exceptional including the service and atmosphere. We added a bottle wine, espresso and tea. We will be back to order from the regular menu.
2014-03-29,4,First time dining at Amanda's...Delightful and delectable, beautifully decorated. The service was top notch and the food was fabulous. Highly recommend making a trip to Hoboken for a wonderful dining experience.
2014-03-22,4,Awesomely cute space that would be adorable for a bridal or baby shower. The rooms can be partitioned off and there's a separate dining room downstairs. Food is pretty good, came here for brunch. Make a reservation to avoid wait time. Salads are delicious, food is filling and we'll seasoned. The goat cheese and mushroom salad was delicious, slightly warm with a great mild but creamy goat cheese. Frittata was well salted, light, and tasty. Grilled chicken salad had incredible grilled chicken with a green goddess-y sauce. Eggs Benedict were "perfect" according to the hubby- the eggs were perfectly poached and popped with a fork. I didn't get to try the croissant French toast but that is next on my list since our neighbors had one and I was very tempted to lean over and snag a bite when she wasn't looking. Service is great, everyone is friendly and efficient and no one looks like they hate their job. Only con is, of course, parking. But it's doable with a little bit of patience. Yummilicious factor - A-
2014-03-20,5,I was here for dinner and I must say I was impressed. Very classy, charming and intimate.Ambiance, food, service - five stars for all.They had ample vegetarian appetizers, I tried the truffle polenta and it was divine. They had just one entree pasta option for me but it was really good so no complains.This place is always packed so I recommend making a reservation.
2014-03-16,4,This is a brunch spot I would definitely come back to when in Hoboken! It's tucked away on Washington street and a reservation is needed on a busy Saturday afternoon. My friend and I decided to split a little bit of sweet and savory by ordering the croissant French toast with berries and crispy eggs. It was a perfect mix of both with a side of fresh squeezed orange juice. The croissant was flaky and light and not heavy- but you're definitely filled after one croissant in a plate of two. The crispy eggs balanced out the sweet even though I had to add a bit more salt on top because we ordered veggie style - without prosciutto which was probably the salt needed. This was a great start to our day of shopping and not too harsh on the wallet either.
2014-03-15,4,A classy, hotel like restaurant. Superb decor and service. Brunch was good but not extraordinary. We came for the a nice quiet Sunday experience.
2014-03-15,4,Went here for brunch today with my gf. She got a Bloody Mary which I wasn't a big fan of because there was a lot of horseradish in it. I just got coffee, which I thought was great because it wasn't so hot that you need to let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking it.We got the polenta as an app, I wasn't that crazy about it but my gf loved it. We got the classic eggs Benedict and the pork tenderloin eggs Benedict. Both were great, definitely coming back to try more.
2014-03-08,5,We go to Amanda's once a week when we are home. They owners, staff, and food is A+!I am a pescetarian so just can vouch on the non she'll fish dishes. I have tried them all and all delicious!This is a neighborhood gem!
2014-02-21,2,Last minute decision to celebrate 3rd year anniversary here before the "real" thing at Eleven Madison Park on Saturday.  I really want to like this place but was a bit disappointed because I was expecting so much more because of yelp reviews. The service is subpar: everyone makes mistakes but the place was empty and the server brought a wine to the table that we didn't order,  she keeps on reaching her arms across the table instead of going to the other side (but I guess I'm watching too much Downton Abbey), she asked for orders and I stated the appetizers we wanted and she CUT ME OFF and said that's she's asking for the drink orders, who does that?! Oh I also mentioned that we're celebrating and they didn't put cute stuff greeting on our Domino's looking molten lava cake dessert (little details people!) So the food: I had better canned soup, scallops were a bit overcooked. Husband loved his steak and the only star for the night is the creamy polenta.
2014-02-17,4,New American executed well with some innovative dishes.  The creamy polenta with wild mushrooms was an excellent appetizer, but the real stand out was the incredible key lime pie for dessert.   Atmosphere is classy and quaint.  Service was decent, but wait was a bit excessive.  It shouldn't take 50 minutes to get an entree.  All in all, this place is a needed entity in the hoboken world of sports bars and pub food.
2014-02-17,5,Pleasantly surprised.  The food was very good.  I can't quite give it 5 stars but I think 4 is very fair.Several meals were on the table.  The mussel appetizer is one I highly recommend.  It's a very generous portion of mussels.  The other appetizers weren't as memorable.  For the mains the pork chop and the chicken both got a lot of love from those who tried it while the short ribs were good but not blow your mind.The service was outstanding which pushes this place to 5 star level.  Glasses were kept constantly full.  They came back to ask us if we wanted more bread.  Just excellent.
2014-02-16,3,I sort of have a hard time liking Amanda's. I've been there twice, both times for brunch - most recently this morning. Here's the main thing to know: this is DEFINITELY a brunch menu, bordering more on breakfast. If you tend to be more of a lunchy-brunch person, you're not going to love it. I think my problem is that I'm more of a lunch person... Pancakes and French toast are not appealing to me. I like eggs, but I always feel stupid paying more than diner prices for eggs.... Seriously: Why would eggs, bacon and potatoes ever cost more than like $8 tops?! For that reason, I'm always disappointed with my meals at Amanda's. It's not because the food isn't tasty... It's just... So breakfasty. That all being said...My fiancé ordered the poached eggs with crab hash and loved it. I ordered the crispy eggs (poached egg, coated in panko and deep fried) with shiitake mushrooms, asparagus and green salad, which was good, but incredibly rich (read: too much). My fiancé's father ordered the croissant French toast which he said was ridiculously decadent (read: delicious). I will give them a thumbs up for their Bloody Mary - that was super tasty. But my coffee was served cold, and we had to ask 3 times for more butter for the table. Like I said, I'm really torn - from a service standpoint it was great, but from a food standpoint, I just haven't been able to walk away happy or satisfied...
2014-02-07,4,Went for Brunch on a Sunday afternoon. It got pretty crowded but it was worth the wait. I had mimosas and the Salmon Eggs Benedict-SO GOOD! Prices were a little higher than average but the place is classy and cozy, and service was great.
2014-02-02,4,Been here for brunch and dinner. I love both experiences.  The restaurant is very quaint like people have described. For brunch, I've had the eggs Benedict and they are pretty tasty.  For dinner I've had the lamb and omg it was soft, tasty. I probably order lamb in any restaurant that offers it and I must say:  Probably top 5 plates of lamb I have had in my life. Accompanied with polenta. Delicious, creamy. Can't eat here everyday though since it was pretty expensive and I'm just a measly nurse practitioner. Thank god for cousin engineers who take you out for dinner!?!!!!
2014-01-31,4,One of the few spots in hobo worth frequenting regularly!! Take advantage of their pre fixe, but if not... Some of the best dishes in town.  Classic ambiance, above avg flavors, reasonable prices... Nice spot for a date or small gathering!! Lobster bisque is silky smooth but robust with flavor!! Lamb dish, can't get enough, short ribs beyond amazing...
2014-01-30,4,One of my favorite places in Hoboken. Great atmosphere and nice, quality food, which unfortunately is hard to find in Hoboken. Good wine list and great service. They do change their menu frequently, though so sometimes you may feel limited in what to order, but overall very good. Nice rooms for private events w/ no room fee, but you do need a guaranteed min or people.
2014-01-24,5,Went to Amanda's for the third time last night.  Everything was so amazing that I had to write a review this time around.The first two visits to Amanda's were both very good.  Food, service, etc. - everything was on point.  Went there again last night for my girlfriend's birthday and couldn't be happier.  The food was absolutely outstanding.It's also good to note that we went during Hudson Restaurant Week.  $38 for an appetizer, entree and dessert.  In the back of my mind I figured the portions would be a little bit smaller than normal, boy was I wrong.  If you can go during HRW which happens twice a year, I highly suggest it.  It's truly a steal to get a meal for that price at this place.  Get a bottle of wine from their vast selection and you are good to go!Amanda's has now become a go-to place for me if I am looking for a more upscale type meal.  There are plenty of places in Hoboken to go to, but this is where you want to be.Looking forward to the next meal I have there.
2014-01-19,4,Came here for my birthday last year. We had a reservation but I don't think it was necessary since the place was practically empty (my birthday was on a Monday). We shared a bottle of wine, mushroom gnocchi for our appetizer (I think this was a special for the day), we both got the lobster bisque which was delicious. He got a steak and I got the scallops, which were slightly over-cooked but still good.  They surprised me with birthday dessert, creme brûlée  :)
2014-01-14,5,We went there for Sunday brunch with another couple and our two 5 month olds.  The staff was extremely accommodating even though it was very busy.  The well dressed staff continued to be attentive throughout the entire brunch.  The atmosphere in Amanda's is unlike any other place in Hoboken because of its elegant fine dining mixed with that boutique feel of an old Hoboken brunch. The food was absolutely delicious and all four dishes came out flawless. Amanda's has nailed it.
2014-01-02,4,Well executed food, warm service, pleasant dining experience.I had the smoked trout salad to start--the dressing complemented the endives and trout, and the whole dish was seasoned perfectly.I wasn't particularly hungry, so I had the mussel appetizer for my main.  The mussels were very tender and the broth was tasty.  It came with grilled foccacia, which was good, but sort of fell apart when dipped in the broth.  I think it would've been improved had it been toasted more--or a harder bread might have gone better with this dish.My boyfriend had the mushroom farfalle, which was excellent.  It came with a cream sauce, which I often find to be too heavy, but this was perfect, and the mushrooms and scallions added some freshness and lightness to the dish.I actually wasn't too enticed by many of the other dishes on the menu (it seems like they overcomplicate some items), but I would come back here based on the quality of the food we had.  I've been here once before for their early dinner, and enjoyed that as well.I loved the ambiance of the restaurant--very intimate and cozy.
2013-12-31,4,Had a nice brunch at Amanda's last Sunday...again very nice service...crispy eggs were delicious...others enjoyed the turkey club and the hanger steak and eggs (although some of the steak was pretty chewy) all in all dining at Amanda's is always enjoyable!
2013-12-29,4,We had a party of four and everybody was pleased. The place  our table felt a bit claustrophobic and the waiter kept bumping in to me. I had the salmon and it was good, not great. If I could give it 3 and 1/2 stars I would. My friends love it but I don't know why.
2013-12-28,5,I don't know how I have not added a review for this before now. My wife and I make it a point to come here every time we are in the NYC area. In my opinion, this is not only the best restaurant in Hoboken, but in the entire NYC area. The food is fresh, amazingly balanced and always innovative. It is also extremely good value. The steak, blue potatoes and green beans are just amazing!Also, the inside of Amanda's is stunning.
2013-12-22,5,Decor:  This restaurant is for a very fancy occasion.  I would host and participate in etiquette dinners here.  Very well lit and classy. Employees:  Very kind and helpful.  They have great knowledge of alcohol pairing, wine pairing and cuisines.  Food:  The food was hands down delicious! Sometimes for early bird specials they have a three course meal.  Everything is always fresh and exquisitely prepared.  Prices: I have only been here for the early bird special and the price for 1 with a good bottle of wine is around $50.  This is a great place to bring a date and for a wow factor!
2013-12-18,5,I LOVE Amanda's!!!  Been here for breakfast, brunch (many times) and dinner(also many times). Every experience has been great. Staff if very profesional (despite how busy they are) and very friendly. Sure the bill can get a bit pricey but honestly, you get what you pay for; Excellent quality! Don't be afraid to choose something that sounds a bit "off" from the menu, trust me, they know what they're doing. And if you don't end up liking a certain part or which to replace an ingredient, they make no fuss. Go! Go! Go! Eat! Eat! Eat! ( good luck finding parking!)
2013-12-14,5,Brunch was awesome went on a Sunday. Love the decor and the food was amazing! Mimosa had fresh squeeze orange juice. I had the waitress give me her recommendation on what to order. I have the crispy egg with asparagus and shiitake mushrooms and greens and procuitto. I'm not a fan of a runny egg so the they made it we'll done. It was perfect for me. Will definitely be back very soon!
