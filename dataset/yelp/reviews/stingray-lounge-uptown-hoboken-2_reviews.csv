2021-11-03,4,Stingray lounge is a good spot for date night, it's cute and romantic and I heard the drinks are great but when I ordered take out it was just okay. I ordered the jackpot for pick up which was about $165. Most of the oysters were delicious since there was a variety but I didn't like the shrimp, the crab meat was good too.I would say I would go again in person but when I ordered take out I was still hungry since I shared it with someone.
2021-10-09,5,Had the pleasure of going here tonight last min but what a great last min choice. This is a nice place,on one side it's just a bar and the other side you can dine. Very cozy and I love the art work on the wall. I had the lobster Mac & cheese that did not disappoint, the spicy garlic shrimp very good and my boyfriend had the little neck clams and scallops which he said was very good. I saw quite a few cocktails that came out which looked yummy. I however had the sparkling Rose in which was very good I actually would have purchased a bottle of that was an option. The staff was good as well. Loved everything and will definitely be back very soon.
2021-09-22,4,This place is definitely alright. Cocktail menu is rather extensive, Amazed the bartenders can remember 30 craft cocktail recipes. Had two of these drinks and they were just marvelous. Oyster variety is excellent and super fresh. Crab cakes arrived deep fried so had to send those back (I did ask how the were prepared and was told pan seared) Scallops tasted as if they were cooked on wood planks and just very tasty. Service was  attentive, warm and professional.
2021-09-21,5,We had a pleasant dinner at Stingray Lounge on a Saturday evening. The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice - perfect for a small group.The seafood platter was really fresh, and the calamari and key lime pie were delicious. I would definitely recommend stopping by for drinks and the raw bar or appetizers!
2021-09-20,4,Was finally able to check this place out. Went around 6:30 PM on a Thursday with my friend and sat at the table that faced the street inside. The Pimms cup was a phenomenal drink, my friend ended up ordering one and doesn't even like gin. We got the tuna tartare, oysters Rockefeller, shrimp cocktail and all were amazing!Great vibes and music, I am looking forward to returning.A bit pricey, but nothing out of the norm.
2021-09-13,5,The best cocktails in Hoboken! The spicy shrimp are incredible but very spicy! The blue crab salad is also amazing. Great music playlist as well
2021-09-03,5,The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable and help navigate the robust cocktail menu.  They give great recommendations once you let them know what kind of drink you are after!  They have a great variety of classic cocktails as well as tiki inspired drinks and a wide array of old fashion variations!  The food and ambience is great for date night!  I've been a handful of times and I've not had a less than great experience.  Highly recommend!
2021-07-29,5,Best seafood and drinks in Hoboken. I've been here several times and I am never disappointed.
2021-07-25,5,Delicious oysters! Great happy hour specials. Husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon during $9 house cocktails. I had the wild child. Definitely recommend if you love pisco!
2021-07-25,5,Really awesome lounge, great bartenders too. I like the vibes and it's at a great location.
2021-07-25,5,Great cocktails and no excuses for a west coast oysters selection. Delicious octopus cooked to perfection
2021-07-03,5,Old Bay Fries, spicy garlic shrimp and crab cake Great food and drinks! Will definitely come back!
2021-07-03,4,Great food, cocktails, and service. Decent selection of fresh oysters. The crab cocktail is a must. Ordered a variety of appetizers such as the mussels that were cooked in a a thai curry sauce and accompanied by flaky bread for dipping, the lobster Mac and cheese was delicious and had tons of lobster, the best was the spicy shrimp.
2021-07-01,4,The food and drinks were amazing. I know it's still Covid times, so I'm sure this was more a staffing issue than how it normally is, but the service wasn't great. But I could tell with only two guys running around to take care of everything they are probably just understaffed and rightly stressed out. The reservation/host situation is weird, you just awkwardly stand at the front until they finally call you over, so we weren't seated until 20 min after our reservation. Then it took ages to get any service, and when we asked for silverware it was literally dropped on the table with a loud clatter and not wrapped in napkins, we had to request the napkins separately. But the workers were kind and I could tell they were just overworked, so I wouldn't say not to go to this place because of that,  it was still worth it. But this is more to just warn you to give yourself two hours here even if it's just for a drink and some oysters, at least until there is more staff. The zucchini fries are some of the best I've ever had, the oysters delicious, and the fresh ground horseradish was perfection. The octopus was crispy on the outside and not too chewy on the inside. The cocktails were also really good. The old fashioned was one of the best I've ever had, the simple syrup they used was not too sweet but complemented the drink nicely. The green tea whiskey drink was very unique, however with the orange blossom water in it I think it would be better paired with orange bitters or an orange garnish instead of lemon bitters and a lemon garnish, so I'd be curious to see if it could be any better with the orange accents instead. However, it was still quite delicious nonetheless. Overall we really enjoyed our time other than the weird service quirks that I will sum up to Covid bounce back. I will definitely visit again and highly recommend.
2021-06-29,4,This place is small bar/restaurant nestled on Washington. It's easy to miss and one of those places where either you know about it or you don't. Came here for an early dinner and drinks and had a great experience. The establishment is very small. There's a pretty decent sized bar inside but otherwise small dining space. We sat outside and had a server who was helpful and friendly. They have a really dope cocktail menu. I was particularly interested in the fact that they had a whole page dedicated to different types of Old Fashioned drinks. My kind of place ! My friend and I both loved the cocktails we got. For the food we ordered oysters which seemed to be a staple there. They had a good amount of oysters to choose from and the server was helpful with choosing. We also had zucchini fries which were thick cut zucchini's breaded . They were very good. We also had crab cakes, crab salad, the risotto, and a lobster roll. (The lobster roll was on special) overall we were very pleased with how tasty our food was. They have nightly happy hour specials so it's good to get there early. It's hardTo find places that sell good seafood and this place had great seafood and drinks.
2021-06-27,5,Great neighborhood spot - owner is always around and pleasant. Love the cocktails - staff is awesome. Well done !!
2021-06-22,5,Stingray lounge is a lovely light snack and dinner option if you want to treat yourself to lavish. The service was quick and helpful. The afternoon was quiet for 4pm and we chose indoor seating since the hit heat outdoors was distracting at the patio. We had a dozen of oysters at oyster happy hour and the most memorable were light and creamy like the sugar shack and the beau soleil. They were out of Kumamoto unfortunately.  We also went with brinier wellfleets! For main meal we ordered a crab Cobb that was a good portion with chunks of crab and bacon which made a stunning combo with the crisp vegetables. The lobster Mac was deceptive. It looked small in a bowl but as you are, you realized that it was dense and rich and buttery. We went home with leftovers! Overall a great and yes, an expensive experience. The restaurant was clean and followed covid protocols but the hand sanitizer was super scented like perfume, that's my only gripe! A lovely hip date in Hoboken with outdoor options. Definitely recommend.
2021-06-20,1,We booked outdoor seating for our Father's Day dinner. When we showed up the staff kept insisting we booked indoor. There were no apologies, and they rudely kept saying we made a mistake. For the record, we have a two year old who is not vaccinated, and we never ever book indoor seating for that reason. Give this place a miss. There are many restaurants trying very hard in times of covid and the polite, accommodative ones are more deserving of business.
2021-06-13,5,The food here is phenomenal great happy hour menu. We loved the lobster rolls most especially the fresh blue point oysters. Great ambiance great service and good food
2021-05-26,5,If I could give them 10 stars, I would! This was my first time in Hoboken and let me tell you, I immediately wanted to move to the area! I wanted to find a good seafood place while visiting and Stingray lounge popped up as a suggestion. It's nice and small, super intimate with the best seafood I've had in a while. We set outside and it was a lovely, cool evening. I ordered a dozen assorted oysters, crab meat and crab cakes and let me tell you, everything was delicious!!! The oysters were outstanding! For drinks I ordered a classic Cosmo and when I tell you this is one of the best cosmos ive had in a while, I'm not lying! If you're ever in the area, you must give this place a go! Amazing food, lovely ambiance, awesome drinks and super great staff!
2021-05-23,5,The Stingray lounge is a bourbon lovers paradise!! Over 40 bourbons and great Old Fashioned options. The food was delicious. The lobster rolls was one of the best I ever had. Tons of buttery lobster and a nicely toasted bun! The clam chowder was delicious, creamy lots of tender clams with a nice addition of bacon!! You can never go wrong with bacon. The Old Bay fries and zucchini fries and delicious and the dipping sauces are very tasty. My gf had the bacon cheeseburger (no bun) and loved it!! Definitely need to check out the Stingray for cocktails and food!!
2021-05-10,4,One of our favorite seafood place in town, great cocktail options.  Raw oysters and clams are fresh and reasonable.  Small plate appetizer options are good.  We ordered scallop ceviche with chips and it was a bit underwhelming, it could use a little bit of salt and a hint of heat to kick it up a notch.  We also ordered a halibut over pasta.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and the pasta sauce was a tomatoes base.  Service is always friendly and attentive.  Definitely recommend Stingray Lounge.
2021-04-25,5,4.5, What's not to love? Amazing seafood...and it was my brother's treatYes, prices are on the higher end but they reflect the quality & vibrant atmosphere at the restaurant. We were only moderately hungry when we came, so ordering this 'large' seafood platter was sufficient for us. Don't come on an empty stomach- fill your tummy a little bit!--seafood & oysters were freshSERVICE: Good, food brought out promptly
2021-04-18,4,I get very excited when I find a spot outside of NYC. I came here on a Sunday night and it was pretty empty indoors. If you're here for the oysters, make sure you double check their happy hour times. Our table shared oysters, calamari, fries, and a cheese board (ugh, I am salivating just thinking about this again). I didn't order any entree because the mix of appetizers was enough to fill me up, but the shrimp pasta looked really good. I think they could do a little better with the banana mousse cake, but again it was very filling so I still enjoyed it. Would highly recommend adding this to your list of seafood spots while you're around NYC/NJ.
2021-04-12,1,Right off the bat our waiter had a bad attitude. We ordered the Full House and it was extremely underwhelming not to mention Half of our lobster was the part with No Meat in it.  The clams and oysters TINY. Will not be returning here.  Oh and tell your cook to wear gloves when plating SALAD and to not touch his cell phone right before doing so and not washing his hands after. Thanks.
2021-04-08,1,Wtf??? We came by and asked for a table outside. The guy said the table was reserved for 5 pm and it was 4:55. And I said no problem. He was going to look at a different time and I said that unfortunately we are time limited so we would have to find something else. I said that VERY nicely. And the conversation should have ended there. Politely. And then the waiter kept me there another 10 minutes arguing with me and telling me I didn't understand. And he kept explaining that it is 4:55 and the table was reserved at 5. And  I kept saying I understand, don't worry, we are leaving. And then he would get all frustrated and explain it all to me again. Let me clarify- he did seem to speak english fluently. He did not appear to have a learning disability. My conclusion? He was on drugs. Get some new waiters.
2021-03-21,4,Stingray had delicious food, great service, and really tasty cocktails. The star off is for the price. After having a $200 meal, my wife and I were both still hungry enough to want a few slices of pizza down the street. I'd most recommend the tuna tartar and the clam chowder. They were fantastic.
2021-03-08,5,Such a gem of a place! Amazing cocktails and raw bar. Every drink and food item we've had here on more than one occasion has been great. Service can be hit or miss.
2021-02-22,5,Hidden gem in Hoboken! Delicious oysters and cocktails with a great atmosphere and service. I've been back twice this month and would love to go again soon.
2021-02-22,5,Great dinner and atmosphere! The Spicy garlic shrimp and little neck clams were amazing! Their cocktail list is huge and all that we tried were great! So glad we stumbled upon this hidden gem - we will be back!
2021-02-21,5,Came in for oysters on a Sunday to just chill and read my book. I was met with great service and a tasty variety of oysters. I'll be coming back. Great spot.
2021-01-24,5,This is my go too local oyster and seafood spot.Try the mussels they are one of my favorites.Great staff and service always.Great drinks too
2021-01-09,4,Great choice of oysters when we visited. Really nice to be able to go somewhere for something more than blue points. They also have a great oyster shooter, I'm usually not a fan of them but they have one that's super smooth and easy to drink. We decided to buy a bottle of their hot sauce to take home, needless to say it will NOT last long since we use it for everything. Going to have to go back for another bottle soon and a few oysters from the west coast.Prices are bit high if you are outside of the happy hour pricing but I still feel it's worth it considering the selection. I'd say service is also a 4/5. The sidewalk seating extends pretty far and it makes it hard for one or two servers to cover.
2021-01-09,4,More than just awesome oysters. And they were awesome and the reason for the visit. Amazing cocktails and food. It defies the casual appearance. Totally worth the stop. Big complaint however is some of the portion sizes are definitely not commensurate with expectations. Too small. Don't get the ceviche or seafood mix plate or the tuna tartare. Or the crab cake. They were good, Just too small and not terribly shareable. Stick with the oysters.  Or the other tuna app wrapped in cucumber. Also I wouldn't get the calamari; unless you have that one person in your group that wants nothing else. It's passable... but not great. Not the typical breaded with marinara so warn that one person.  I didn't care for the cilantro  "aioli". The house made horseradish, sauces and mignonettes were outstanding. Add a dozen to your order.
2021-01-05,4,Great cocktails. Can't go wrong trying something new on the menu.Great service/staff. Have been here many times and everyone is consistently friendly and accommodating.Oysters are great.  Zucchini fries and regular fries are great. Haven't tried much else.
2021-01-03,5,Stingray is one of my favorite places to go. Between the ambiance and great specials, it is such a fun time. The oysters are always delicious and with the special, it allows you to try new types. We tried various oysters and the cheese plate. The service was attentive and kind.
2020-12-21,5,My boyfriend and I stopped by to grab a drink before dinner and had a great experience! They have a good selection of both classic and house cocktails, including a whole page of Old Fashioned drinks, for any whiskey fans. We appreciated the helpful staff, well curated rock playlist, and pop art decor. I'd definitely visit again!
2020-12-05,5,This place is amazing, it has one of the best cocktail lists I have ever seen. The oyster selection is also very unique, it is very difficult to find briny oysters from the northeast.
2020-11-28,5,Excellent and fresh oysters! Could use better sauces but the quality of the seafood was very good!
2020-11-12,5,Great service and atmosphere! The lobster rolls (both kinds) are absolutely fabulous and the calamari was so tender and tasty!
2020-11-11,3,Food and drinks were both excellent, covid precautions were taken. The servers were very nice but unfortunately the service was very slow.
2020-11-01,5,Yum! Had the scallops, octopus and lobster roll. Will definitely come again!Have no complaints on service.
2020-10-27,1,Just ordered the Sugar Shack dozen of oysters (to-go) & they didn't put the oysters on ice but got this floppy ass to-go container; Let's talk about presentation. Let me hear your thoughts as to who what restaurant does this?? See images below. I recommend don't order any oysters to-go or anything cold whereas you are going to get a floppy ass container. This restaurant gets no stars from me
2020-10-24,1,Will preface by saying it takes a lot for me to rate poorly in pandemic times but this host earned it for them. Two tables in front were open but host said they were taken and insisted we sit at the only (wobbly) table away from the storefront behind parked cars. A family behind us and another couple walked in without reservations and were seated right in front. Guess we're second rate customers, felt very discriminatory. Kumamotos the size of a quarter for $4.40/ea, save your money. We had a dozen tiny oysters and watched 4 tables sit empty for 30 mins before leaving.PS take out is equally disappointing. Tuna tartare had about 2 flecks of tuna in it.
2020-10-23,5,Wow. What can I say. The food and service is amazing. Great staff. The fish was so fresh. I'm surprised I was able to walk in on Friday night and get a table. Great time
2020-09-20,5,We had a phenomenal birthday dinner here right before COVID. We sat at the bar and had a great conversation with the bartender. Oysters and martinis were amazing. We got a seafood tower and almost finished the entire thing! Clams were delicious, shrimp, crab, lobster, all delicious! Looking forward to going back!
2020-09-14,4,Billy the bartender makes amazing drinks!!! He created custom cocktails based on what I love and everyone he made was awesome and different from the last. Food was also great! Only thing lacking was a few other employees hanging around not doing anything and talking to each other in front of guests. Employee drinks were also left all over the place which I found weird, but overall would definitely recommend!
2020-09-09,5,We love this place, although space is limited outside we always seem to get a table. We've always gone in the evening around 7-8pm, nice ambiance. We enjoyed the oysters, soft shell crab sandwich and the ceviche.
2020-09-06,5,Was in Hoboken for the day with initial plans to go to pier 13 but it was too crowded so we left to explore another place to eat. Looked up some outdoor dining options and found this place and have no regrets! While we waited for our table we got drinks and they were delicious! Great Moscow mule made very well. We then had east coast oysters for an appetizer and they were very fresh. We then ordered mussels- made in a delicious broth, slightly spicy with bread to dip. We also split the boil and requested a piece of lobster in it and it was delicious- filled with shrimp, crab legs, corn and potatoes in a butter sauce. Recommend this place if you are in the Hoboken area
2020-08-09,2,Definitely overrated. I tried their scallop plate, it had 4 tiny scallops on it (for $22) that weren't cooked particularly well. Mussels were also a small portion and completely over-seasoned. Nice place for cocktails, but if you're looking for quality seafood or a good meal then I would probably look elsewhere.
2020-07-17,5,Delicious oysters. Seriously, try all of them. My fave were the blue point and the jersey devils. They have a pretty good outdoor set up, which is ideal for pandemic dining. Service was quick and the waitress was pleasant and helpful. My partner had the steak and it was delicious. Make sure you call ahead for reservations, so you can really enjoy an evening out in Hoboken.
2020-06-13,5,It's been 3 months since I've had a seriously shaken, well done, delicious drink. So happy you reopened. The best to-go drinks in Hob!! Can't wait for dining alfresco!
2020-02-19,4,Can't beat Stingray for their oysters! 2 dozens of blue points were fresh and huge! I missed happy hour but it was definitely worth it for full price. I noticed they put scallions in most of their dishes which I'm not a huge fan of, but I can easily remove them. No biggie. Buns were juicy, cauliflowers were crispy, and crab cakes were fresh. Service is great! Thumbs up!
2020-02-15,5,Tonight my boyfriend and I had a belated Valentine's Day dinner. We started with the raw bar appetizer - the full house - which was delicious! I definitely recommend getting an appetizer because our entree dishes were smaller than typical- however I will say we were full afterwards. Had we not gotten an appetizer, we would have still been hungry. That being said- the raw bar dish was amazing, the pan seared scallops entree was delicious, and the red snapper my bf got was excellent! I loved the vibe and they had Casablanca playing on one of their TV (love!). They don't accept reservations, and the place is kind of small, but on a Saturday night around 8pm we didn't have to wait for a table which was awesome. We will definitely return!
2020-02-09,5,Just had the best happy hour experience with Myranda  what an amazing barista and super friendly personality!! Looking forward to coming back for those fresh oysters!!!!
2020-01-24,5,Go Sunday through tuesday for 50% oysters and sparkling wines.. must go between 4-8. My boyfriend and I came for just that... and we had an amazing time. A few people around us came alone because who doesn't want to slurp down half priced oysters and champagne!!! It's a nice way to just enjoy yourself. Highly recommend!
2020-01-19,5,Went for oysters and old fashions. We were not disappointed. Good oysters, amazing drinks, and better service. Great experience. We will definitely be returning.
2019-12-21,5,Came to this hidden gem and boy was I in heaven! Great service by Elizabeth and their oysters are fantastic!!! Between 10-11PM Friday and Saturday they're only one dollar! Definitely will be returning for more soon!!
2019-12-16,5,I had just arrived from Boston to my Airbnb, with a huge craving of oysters and this spot had everything I was looking for, from different selection of oysters to amazing expresso martinis. Also there entrees all sound delicious but the steamed clams caught my attention and I don't regret it one bit they were full of flavors and the broth was ridiculous good !
2019-10-23,2,It was a Sunday not that busy. Only 4 other patrons in pairs. The bartenders were nice. One was only interested in flirting with the girls so he was useless. Not the best service. The food was ok. The tuna tartare was day old at least guacamole because it was brown. Not the best. Surprised they would serve that. The oysters were good for themost part at least two tasted like bad oysters. So maybe don't order oysters. The best thing was the fried zucchini which was crispy and good but only got 6 sticks. Also the Bloody Mary was tasty and well balanced. I guess the best things there were not the seafood. Stick with the vegetables
2019-10-23,3,We went on a Sunday afternoon and were pleased with the staff. The zucchini fries were awesome the red snapper crudo was slightly fishy. Ordered 2 of each oyster and about 4 of the oysters didn't taste fresh. I have eaten plenty of oysters from east to west and these didn't taste fresh. The tuna tartare came on a bed of brown avacados and was disturbing. Bloody Mary's were one of the best I have had. Ps. Only had one I was driving. But food left a little to be desired. Also one bartender/ server seemed too into flirting than service. My partner was mistaken by one of the girls as Nate when we walked in so you know the two guys reviewing you. Really the avacados were actually brown under the tuna that really wasn't sushi grade.
2019-10-04,5,This place is a hidden gem in Hoboken no joking!Highly recommend the Bao buns, cobbler, octopus and so much more to explore. I can't wait to come back again!
2019-09-22,5,Stopped in here yesterday and sat at the bar. Very cool atmosphere. Our bartender, Lou, was awesome. Very knowledgeable and his drinks were so tasty. We even let him customize them a bit and we were glad we did. We had oysters and tuna tartare which were very good. Can't wait to come back!
2019-09-14,2,We had a disappointing meal at this restaurant. I was really looking forward to have a good time at this place. Based on its reviews, I was expecting great service and food and I didn't get either. I ordered a cocktail at the bar and the coconut chili mussels and the cocktail was unbalanced and very strong like straight liquor, glass of cava was also low quality. The mussels order wasn't put in and it took nearly an hour to get them. I ordered the lobster roll and it had no taste. The service was not good, we were never offered water or anything. Needless to say, I won't be going back.
2019-08-23,5,We found this place after getting a little bored at pier 13 and I'm so glad we did! It is a cute little bar with delicious cocktails and delicious seafood. We had the first three cocktails on the menu and they were all good! I loved by gin cocktail and the third cocktail (I'm forgetting the names) had Brenevin and sake in it... if you've been to Iceland you know this is Iceland's vodka and they call it Black Death... however the bartender managed to make it taste refreshing so it was a nice reminder of travels (literally have never seen it in an American bar before) but was still yummy. The food... so happy to actually have a good food experience in Hoboken. We got the jersey oysters and they were fresh and perfect and we got the tuna tartare... also delicious. The happy hour goes till 8 I wanna say which is also another plus. We will definitely be back :)
2019-08-05,4,Stumbled upon this hidden gem in Hoboken while looking for some delicious seafood. We got to celebrate national oyster day by ordering a platter full of oysters at half off each on Sunday's happy hour! Score. My favorite oysters will always be from Washington. Next we had the tuna tartare which was fresh and light which was served with crunchy chips. The green curry mussels was my next favorite as they were simmered in a savory light broth. I kept dipping my baguette into the broth until there was no more. Next I had the scallops in cauliflower purée and I must say the cauliflower purée tasted like buttered mashed potatoes. It was fluffy and creamy. The scallops were a decent size and nicely grilled. And now let's talk about grilled octopus which was sitting on a tossed spicy arugula salad. The octopus was soft and tender with a nice little kick. Lastly, we had the fries but they way were just fine. Nothing special. I would skip these. This is definitely a great spot for a date night with some fresh seafood!
2019-08-01,5,Three letters O.M.G. !!! I finally tried it out and it didn't disappoint ! I loved the NYC trendy low-key vibe , our waiter was super accomodating , and the jackpot seafood platter was to die for .The seafood was so fresh and the oyster selection was great my favorites being kumomoto  ,we also had oyster shooters and a wonderful Sauvignon blanc pairing .Stringray will definitely be my go to spot for seafood and yummy and creative drinks try it out , you won't regret it
2019-06-18,3,Great food, sketchy service. Had lovely cocktails and the large seafood tower. The service was rude. Waiters busy flirting with young ladies outside. We spent close to $300 but not sure I would recommend due to poor service.
2019-05-24,5,Delicious, creative cocktails! Order the Zombie to be teleported directly to The Caribbean! Highly recommend Anchovie Bruschetta & Colossal Crab Cocktail!
2019-05-21,5,We always have a nice time when we go sitting in the dining room. Small, so call ahead. Fish is always very fresh
2019-05-18,5,I was here for my 30th birthday yesterday and was amazed and in awe by the excellent service provided to us by Guido our server. He was very patient and super attentive. The food was excellent and the drinks were great. Their raw bar is a MUST try. Really enjoyed it here would love to come again.
2019-05-13,5,Best place in this entire universeHappy waitresses and waitersLovely atmosphere Wonderful food!One of the happiest day in my entire life.
2019-04-17,5,Truly a great place. The bartenders are on point and very responsive. Drinks are great, the standard old fashioned is the way to go. Did not try the food. The atmosphere was nice and very trendy. I need to go back. Two thumbs up!
2019-04-13,5,This is my second time coming here and they do not disappoint. From the oysters and tuna tartare to the crab cakes (which were a pleasant surprise) and lobster rolls; my boyfriend and I were very happy with the food. The atmosphere is vibrant - you can come here on a Saturday night for great food and drinks. Don't pass up the opportunity to stop in if you're in uptown Hoboken!
2019-04-06,1,This was the second time we visited and the last time! The service was horrible and the food was flavorless. It wasn't busy and they were not engaged at all. Drinks were empty and they didn't even ask if we needed another. I work in sales and hospitality and that is not how you treat people. I'm super disappointed and will not return.
2019-03-03,5,Great atmosphere to enjoy a cocktail and small plates. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
2019-02-15,5,If I could give more stars to the stingray rating I would. From the moment my wife and I walked in we were greeted with a smile. Service superb, food superb. A little pricey but well worth it. Can't forget to mention made Bakula 1942 Don Julio also superb. We will go back. The stingray lounge should be called Heaven on Earth.
2019-02-05,2,I normally have been lucky with going along with the ratings people have on Yelp. However, this was my bubble-buster: Average taste, over-priced.  My poutine was served like warm---gravy was in chunks as if it was just thrown on top.  I questioned the waitress and she was trying to convince me it was supposed to be that way. Unfortunately, I've had the real deal before so had a standard of expectation for this dish. She wasn't going to take it back to the kitchen until I stuck my finger in there and showed her it wasn't even hot enough to melt the gravy nor cheese curd a little. Lobster roll was too salty, and of course small. Mussels were the only thing worth praising as it had a nice spicy kick. Waitress did not know pairing of wine with the menu. She was serving one whole section alone and could not keep up with water refills or checking in with everyone. Cute spot, but won't be coming back as there are way better options in the 'hood worth paying higher for
2019-01-26,5,Literally my favorite establishment in all of Hoboken. The oysters are outstanding, in fact the entire menu is. The cocktails are great. Loving sitting at the bar or getting a table. They also have great happy hour specials.
2019-01-18,5,The food in this place is simply excellent.. a friend actually referred the place so me and my boyfriend decided to try it out last night , was great !!
2018-12-21,5,This place was great! We ordered the meat/cheese board and were very impressed with the selection. The atmosphere was very nice too. Will definitely be back soon to try some seafood!
2018-12-07,5,Will makes the best cocktails, truly incredible and I bartended for 10 years. The food is really good and my friends and I always have a good time when we go.
2018-11-18,5,Best oysters around with great selection to choose from & moderately priced. First time we went, didnt know which to choose & so our bartender/waiter chose for us & it was perfect. The lobster loaded fries are worth it too! Lots of lobster on top. As for drinks, they're great & totally upscale kind of vibe. Perfect for after work drinks/eats or date night
2018-11-09,5,Went with a friend who says this is her favorite spot in the neighborhood. Excellent offerings and service. I had the chicken sandwich which was quite good.
2018-10-31,4,We sat at the bar in the corner on a Friday night and I will be honest I did not know much about this place. I thought it was just an oyster and cocktail bar. They don't have a huge menu but they do have other different items. We had some wine which was good. We had 3 different reds and they all were solid. For food we ordered a few small plates. Heres a run-down:The shrimp in the shrimp tacos had a charred taste. The crispy tuna entree was not good. Tuna was overcooked. The edamame that comes with it had more flavor. The buttermilk chicken sandwich was one of the better items we tried. The chicken had good flavor and it had the right amount of crunch. We also tried the pork bao buns. This isnt the baohaus in nyc but the pork had a good smokey flavor and the buns held it all together well.We also had the oysters which it looked like they were known for. It was the first oyster I had and it was pretty good. It did not have any fishy-ness to it and tasted like the ocean. I don't think I am dying to order more but I can see the appeal.There isn't a huge menu here so don't come for a full dinner. It is a perfect place for a drink and some small plates. Stingray had a good vibe to it as well. Win win all around.
2018-10-24,5,Simple bar and seafood spot!  Guilhem (dry side)rose French wine complimenting the seafood here!  Beach plum tasted like it's been sitting. Beach point was my sea flavor favorite and Great Guns meaty were sized.  Mookie blues had sea flavor too.  I love seafood and oysters are aphrodisiac!  Island creek was of very fresh water like.  Blue point was the in between of meat and sea flavor. Slurpalicious! Crab cakes were lovely as well as the clams oregenata.  One can't go wrong with the seafood here!  They have their signature hot sauce, but it was hard to pour out!  It wasn't spicy to me, but I only had a few drops out, if that was the case. Service was attentive and it was warm and cozy here (probably because it was non peak hours).
2018-10-19,4,Cool spot- mostly come for cocktails, which are good (although the bartenders tend to give you a feel that you're an imposition if you're not a regular). The food is pretty good too if you want some small plates with your drinks!
2018-08-23,5,Another favorite for seafood! We had an assortment of oysters and lobster. Everything was delicious! Love the presentation and flavors. Seafood tasted fresh. A little pricey but worth it. Romantic atmosphere and the service was great. Will return again.
2018-08-13,4,This is an awesome little lounge spot that frequently gets overlooked by lists for best raw bars in the area. I have been here on numerous occasions and rarely have I been disappointed.They typically have a very large selection of oysters available (think 10 minimum) as well as clams, shrimp, crab, etc. on top of this they have very tasty small plates as well to help fill you up.This place is a bit on the pricey side but they have happy hours and specials through out the week than can cut a good portion of the price off.My only qualm with this restaurant is that most recently during their 50% off special, they pretty much ran out of every oyster they had and my party relied on one type of oyster for the remainder of our visit. I understand that half off can lead to depleting stock but at 7-8 on a weekend only having one or two types of oyster left is a bit difficult. Other than that this is a great place to go
2018-08-09,2,I don't know why so many people give nice rating here, I can't figure out any word to describe the food here except horrible, food is either overcooked or too salty, the raw claim we ordered was not fresh at all, the service was so slow, we had an every unpleasant experience here.
2018-08-05,5,The oysters at the Stingray lounge were so fresh and served to perfection. They were shucked perfectly and all served with cocktail sauce, vinegar and lemons. We sat at the bar and ordered some specialty cocktails. They were strong and delicious, the mixes were all very unique.Our server was also very helpful in helping us pick what oysters we would like best based in our preferences.  There is also seating in the other side of the restaurant for larger groups or more intimate dining. I would highly recommend the lobster roll as well. For the price the roll was packed with a ton of meat. Served with old bay fries at $20 it was such a great deal in my opinion. Would highly recommend and come again.
2018-07-24,4,This was a great find for a Sunday Happy Hour. Good speciality cocktails. We had the Grilled Octopus, the Lobster Hand Cut Fries w/  Poutine, Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Pancetta, Crushed Peas, Tarragon CreamChilled Seafood Platter, Lobster,Mussels,Shrimp, Oyster. Most of the items were outstanding with the exception of the Scallops dish. the Peas weren't crushed and the Scallops had a taste of Ammonia. Drink were fantastic, and food on the most excellent taste and flavor. I definitely will be back but skip the Scallops. Service was good sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the mixologist.
2018-07-20,4,Stopped here for cocktails last weekend after dinner at Dino and Harry's.   We scored a table outside for the 5 of us and Lincoln (my dog).  We each had a cocktail and we split a dozen oysters.   The drinks were surprisingly large and the oysters fresh and delicious.   Add in the excellent service and I'm going to make it a point to go back for dinner this summer.
2018-07-14,2,We were very disappointed with our experience.  There was some good, the waiting staff was very kind and helpful, the cocktails were delicous and they had a very good variety, and the food was pretty good but wasn't anything special.Now for the bad.  We ordered 12 cherry stones on the half shell.   We tried one and it seemed pretty okay.  Then I tried another one, and it tasted absolutely rotten.  Figured maybe I just got unlucky and got a bad one, it happens and things slip through the cracks.  So I tried another one, and it also tasted completely rotten.  Our server sent them back, and the owner came out to apologize.  He pretty much said that they were the last ones they had left, and he thought they would still be okay but they clearly weren't so he was very sorry.  That is a HUGE no-no when serving raw food to customers.  Never serve something raw unless you are 100% certain it is fresh.  These things smelled lile low tide in the bay, and were very clearly passed the point of being edible.  We also figured they'd comp more off our bill than just the clams for servering my girlfriend and I something that could easily put us in the hospital, but I guess not.  Maybe this was a one time slip up, but who knows.... definitely not going to come back to find out.  Food poisoning from raw shellfish is no joke.
2018-06-18,5,Came here for happy hour and I was pleasantly surprised. The oysters during happy hour are half off. We chose the Welfleets & they were super fresh. This place has an intimate feel & reminds me of many cute NYC spots. I'll deff be back for more!
2018-06-12,4,Cool spot but dismal ambiance (I came on a Tuesday though). Ordered the wicked garden cocktail and it's underwhelming, disinteresting and almost like grape juice. To be fair, I didn't try any of the food, which their raw bar seems phenomenal so I refuse to rate below 4 stars just because of one cocktail and a mediocre ambiance for a Tuesday night. Would give this place a second chance with the right company and if I were in the mood for a raw bar. Stingray has the potential to be a happening place.
2018-06-11,5,Wow....what to expect from fresh oysters....superb customer service and chiq place to hang around....
2018-05-24,5,Pleasantly surprised! It's a really low-key bar but the cocktails are super crafty and delicious. We ordered the pulled pork buns and they were incredible (and I'm picky about my pork!). The bartender suggested we get the Old Bay French fries as well, and we literally ate them all in 5 seconds!! Quite possibly the best fries and sauce I've ever had in my life!
2018-05-19,4,Secretly the best spot for cocktails and wine. Super chic and quaint, this spot offers the best place to go for cocktails and delicious bites. Fresh shucked Oysters and seafood are the main offerings here but they also happen to have the best hand cut potato wedge fries with ole bay seasoning as well as other non-seafood snacks. In the fall and winter I love being warmed up by their pumpkin spice old fashions, classic Manhattans, and perfect sazerac. In the spring and summer their tea Infused gin cocktails and fantastic wine selection keep me feelin' fine. This is a hidden gem.
2018-04-24,5,Absolutely loved this spot and honestly cant believe I haven't been here prior to last Friday.Came here for a classy girl's night out and Stingray definitely delivered with it's city like feel.  We sat by the bar and our bartender Billy was great at recommending drinks.  He was able to suggest and serve us drinks based on our preference which I thought was pretty cool.We ended up getting the Full House which came with 1/2 Lobster, 6 Oysters, 6 Clams and 2 Shrimp.  I can't even begin to describe to you how incredibly fresh the seafood platter was!!  I was instantly taken to food heaven and felt myself closing my eyes with every bite. We also got fries to pick at which were also pretty good.I thought it was pretty cool how the owner came out to bring us our food which we didn't know he was at the time.  But when our Bartender left he filled in and the Bartender even told him what we were having since we didn't order from their drink Menu. I can't wait to go back and check out their Happy Hour Specials!
2018-04-15,4,Finally made it to Stingray Lounge. I would agree that it's a bit pricey but well worth it when you can treat yo-self. Came here on a late afternoon Saturday and my friends had oysters and I had the tune tartare. I cannot say better things about the tartare- what a combination of flavors! Also loved the rosè, it's a perfect combination if you like it more dry but still a little sweet. Also complete nod to our waiter. We sat in the window seats and he was totally willing to come to us when we could've just ordered from the bar. Nice and attentive!
2018-02-01,4,Awesome date spot! It's pricey but well worth it. My man and I love oysters from Canada so we were ecstatic to see beau soleils from Brunswick and Irish points from PEI. Don't forget to dab some homemade habanero hot sauce and slurp away. The spinach crab dip was also quite delicious.Lou took care of us during a quiet late night Sat visit. He had some off the menu cocktail recipes that he was working on and we were ever so willing to try them out. My Wild Child was tasty and refreshing!This is on the quieter side of Hoboken so we will continue to return as long as we can find parking.
2018-01-20,2,Highly disappointed. I live in Hoboken with my boyfriend and this place has good reviews so we thought we'd check it out. I love going to local restaurants versus chain restaurants so I generally don't like leaving bad reviews on local places. As soon as we walked in, there was no host/hostess to seat us, so we were left wandering around aimlessly trying to figure out how to sit down at a table. Finally, we approached someone at the bar who ignored us for a minute and then looked up and sat us at the table. We ordered 2 glasses of wine, oysters, and spinach artichoke crab dip. It took forever for the waiter to come over. He was very friendly but clearly rushing around (not his fault) so when I needed some advice on what oysters to order he just suggested we get one of each- not great advice but that's what we did. The oysters were delicious but the dip was lukewarm on top, chips weren't fresh, and barely tasted like spinach, artichoke, or crab. Was very weak which was disappointing because we already weren't super happy with the place. The wine came after the dip and the oysters and the place has terrible acoustics so you get a headache trying to have a conversation because it's so loud. Will not be back any time soon.
2018-01-20,2,I sat at the bar so I can't speak for the wait staff. Bartender never made eye contact despite it being pretty quiet. Slammed every bottle down and it was distracting to me and my fiance. He clearly didn't want to be there and didn't care for us or anyone else at the bar. Honestly the other staff seemed nice. I only saw all white male staff which is discouraging in a diverse town but again, only sat at the bar. Drinks were mediocre. Prices are pretty good given Hoboken prices. Will try again in case it was just a one time thing.
2018-01-06,3,Came here on a Saturday night and was pretty full. We ordered the dozen oysters with lobster and lobster rolls. The oysters didn't seem too fresh and the lobster roll was  just eh. They have specials on Sundays and some weekdays for oysters.
2017-12-28,4,Stingray Lounge is a hidden gem in Hoboken. We only came for happy hour but the deals are great for both food and drink. A good, quiet place in Hoboken to grab a quick drink and lobster roll with a friend AND actually be able to talk!
2017-11-21,3,This place was really disappointing. It sounded like a cool concept, so I was excited to take my boyfriend and his parents here for a drink and app before dinner. We sat by the door, which wouldn't fully close for some reason so I got a nice constant draft. No one was paying attention to us, which the manager recognized and came over. Except, ha, he asked what he could do for us, any we ordered an appetizer, fast forward to us paying the bill to realize "hey, we never got that appetizer ..."
2017-11-09,4,They have quite the seafood selection and great cocktail menu.  This is good spot for happy hour, as well as great place for any social event
2017-11-08,5,Love love love this place. The decor is cute, the only drawback here is the service. I feel like we always get his under enthused waiter, he's pretty terrible but despite this... I still comeBack all the time. This is a great date place. Double date , first date orJust a friends date! They have a ton of different oysters... which I love.I think the last time I came here my date (haha) and I ordered two of all the different options. Which was about 12 oysters each... btw Sunday's are half priced what!!!! Yes it's true We each tried some cocktails out, they can also make you something fun if yo  don't see anything on the menu you like. It can be a little pricier if you go during the week but it's totally worth it. I'llBe back soon!
2017-10-20,5,This place is amazing! Great drink specials, terrific and tasty seafood, entertaining and friendly staff. Stingray is currently winning the slot as my favorite Hoboken venue. I went for my birthday and had a fabulous time. I ordered $1 osyters, Old Bay fries and some yummy scallops coupled with a little bubbly.The decor gives off an upscale and classy vibe though I would not consider it stuffy. There is not a ton of seating so get there earlier than later (not sure if they take reservations). There are only 2 tables available for outdoor seating when the weather is decent.Street parking is metered/not always the easiest to procure. NJ Transit bus #126 stops right nearby so very easy commute from PABT. I recommend going Sun-Tues for half priced oysters!
2017-10-13,4,Stopped in on a Tuesday evening and enjoyed their happy hour special of half priced oysters and prosecco.  Will be back!
2017-09-29,5,I have been lucky enough, or blessed enough to have eaten seafood at the top places in the world, travelling to top seafood spots in HK, San Francisco,  New York, and the Caribbean to eat at the best seafood restaurant in the world "Le Bernardin" 3 Michelin Street seafood temple . I just recently moved to Hoboken, and I have found this place to be my  top place in New Jersey when I need an seafood fix . I have eaten here 4 times in 2 weeks and I have tried almost all their menu,. From their great old fashioned drinks, I would suggest try the dorsia which has become my favorite drink as of today, try their oyster shooter especially #2, they have a nice beer selection as well,  top picks make sure to try their kumamoto oysters which I have found to be of the best quality as well as their pemaquids. Then go with their colloidal jump shrimp cocktail and sashimi tuna oyster, follow up with crispy Wasabi tuna and finish with their amazing Lobster roll. If you like dessert  get their chocolate cappuccino mousse cake. Also they are kind enough to have half price Sunday's and Tuesdays in all oysters and wines, no reason to not eat well
2017-09-17,4,Happy drinks and oysters were a great deal. Also had some eats from the bar menu/ The bartender/server was attentive and informative.
2017-09-04,4,Quiet spot to enjoy oysters and bubbly (or a cocktail). Not quite downtown Hoboken, which makes if a good option for people who want a chill vibe that's walking distance from the buzz of downtown.
2017-09-02,5,This is truly one of Hoboken's hidden gems.They make fantastic cocktails and have the freshest possible oysters. I cannot recommend this place highly enough!
2017-08-30,5,If you LOVE oysters but are also on a budget this is the place for you. I come here at least once a month for the Sunday-Tuesday special when oysters and bubbly are half off. Stingray has an amazing selection of oysters from both east and west coasts and their menu changes frequently so you are always having the chance to try something new. The bartenders are great and attentive and the space is super cute. Def recommend for date nights as well as catching up with a friend.
2017-08-29,5,I love this place, not only because of good food and nice atmosphere, great choice of oysters and friendly staff. My heart melted when I was craving a hot wine drink, and they didn't have it in their menu and the bartender made GLÜHWINE special for me and it was just perfect! Like original german glühwine. It was much better than in places that actual serve it! I'll never forget that!
2017-08-21,4,*Update*Discovered about 5 more bar seats when I ventured further back and a few larger tables on the other side. It's a lot bigger than it looks. I was back for some more Thursday 50 cent clams and will continue to do so!
2017-08-13,4,One of my favorite spots in town.  Just enjoyed date night there with my hubby!  We went for 5 pm, so it was a little early, and as a result we were a little forgotten for the first few minutes of our visit, but this was quickly corrected and we had a good time.  They were also out (on this one occasion) of my favorite anchovies dish, but that's ok.  We had the tuna tartare oysters, grilled octopus, meat and cheese plate, and mussels.  Great wine list and wines by the glass too! Excellent date spot.
2017-08-11,3,Not really sure how this is a 4  1/2 star establishment. I would think Yelpers would expect more on their plate for the price. I went yesterday for their 50 cent clams happy hour which is a great deal (and worthy of the 3 stars) but the $15 octopus and $15 skirt steak was a serious slap in the face and wallet to any customer. I am no stranger to small plates, but this was minuscule. Small plates are meant for sharing but when something is literally a few bites, how on earth do you accomplish that?! Honestly, as someone who orders octopus appetizers often I don't know how they feel it's ok to serve what they did - I've never experienced that before. $70 later we were still starving, but ate at home because we felt we would be foolish to keep ordering more small bites.
2017-07-26,5,Been here 4 or 5 times just for evening drinks. Classy, local spot with an older (28 - 40) crowd. Hoboken is a young town - if you go downtown by the PATH it's all 21 - 28 year olds running around. It's harder to find a wine bar without a drunk Penn State young alumn girl spilling her vodka-cran on your leg, but this is one of a few of those spots. Nice bar that loops around one side of the space with couches on the other side. Doesn't get all that loud inside but still has a decent crowd.A couple blocks from my apt so makes it easy to frequent.
2017-07-19,3,5 stars for food. 1 star for service. I hate to leave a mediocre review because the raw bar is excellent and Hoboken needs more places like this...so I want stingray to survive. However I have been here several times with consistently lousy service. The bartenders let you sit there for 20 minutes without acknowledging you and then totally mess up simple orders. It wasn't even crowded. This has happened multiple times. It is so bad that I am hesitant to ever go back and would never bring a date there.
2017-07-16,2,Stingray lounge had a decent reputation according to all you foodies on yelp, but clearly half of you are mesmerized and hoodwinked by ice on a plate and random oysters from around the corner. These guys must have plucked the dozen I nearly consumed from the Hudson, they were rotten and hairy. I think they get overtly excited on over serving the customer and then passing these awful oysters off onto them. Hard pressed to show my face in here after the last dozen I was served. Barely got past one before I felt a little queasy... pawn this shit on business men and tourists, not you're regular customers
2017-07-12,1,Don't even stop in if you see seats available which it is never full. Service does not exist and they never clean the bar. The two bartenders like to talk to each other. When they talk to a customer they are very rude and disrespectful. The bartenders like to throw the menu at you and don't even clean the bar when they're walking back to the kitchen. My wife and I live around the corner and have gone to the place once every year and have experienced the same situation every time so this is not a one time thing. The owner should fire the bartenders and or manger or close the place. Will never be back.
2017-07-09,3,We keep coming back because the raw bar is amazing.  But the service could use some fine tuning...
2017-07-03,5,Go Sun-Tues for half priced oysters! I've been wanting to go to this place for a while and finally went today. Had one of each oyster on the menu, then ordered 3 of my top 2 favorites. Our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. I definitely would return again.
2017-06-16,4,Great to have a great raw bar in Hoboken (near Edgewater) fresh oysters, clam, shrimp cocktail, great mix drinks/cocktails, drink menu etc. staffs are very friendly. Overall, a great place!! will definitely come back. Quality of oyster is somewhat inconsistent but recommended.
2017-05-29,4,I visited stingray on a Sunday evening...very nice place. The decor looks like it should be in nyc.  The food is pretty good, quality of the seafood is great... everything tasted super fresh. The lobster roll and the old bay fries are delicious. The four of kind platter was pretty good for $65, however, The Chart house has a seafood tower (small) for $53 dollars and has king crab legs and the presentation of the tower is just fantastic. The dark and stormy cocktail was yummy. Definitely is a place to go for seafood, but next time I will ordered either oysters or clams alone and not the platter. The server said that they have specials Monday thru Thursday so next time I'll visit it during the week. Most of the servers are very nice. Definitely visit if you are in the area.
2017-05-19,5,love it! oysters are always fresh, and ambience is terrific!this is exactly what uptown Hoboken needed!
2017-05-16,5,Excellent service with classic and creative cocktails,  raw bar and delicious small plates for sharing. The place is bigger than it appears from the window and has a friendly vibe. Oysters are excellent and come from varying areas around the country. All staff are super friendly and warm, not snobby as can happen in higher end cocktail bars sometimes. I even ordered a cocktail I didn't like (totally my fault for not knowing the flavor of a key ingredient listed). They happily made me a different drink .
2017-05-05,5,Great place to hang out and have glass of wine with oysters or seafood. Definitely the coolest vibe in Hoboken. Accommodation is either at tables with sofa chairs or, a cool bar, and as an added bonus a few tables outside.
2017-04-26,3,The vibe is confusing. Rock music with sports on big TV. Artful deco and good food. Not sure if I will go back. Suggestion : drop the rock and TVs and I can see myself paying $4/oyster. Otherwise it's just another sports bar.
2017-04-24,5,This is our favorite date night spot. Amazing atmosphere where you can actually hear who you are with! Great drinks. There is a young , baldish, handsome waiter there who is FABULOUS. So sweet and attentive. It's a bit on the pricier side.. wish they had a couple more specials for weeknights... but if you like seafood and a fabulous cheese plate, this is your place.
2017-04-10,4,Stringray Lounge's 1/2 Priced Oysters and Wine specials have been starring me in the face for awhile, and boy am i glad i finally hit this place up. It was a Sunday early evening, and what better way to treat myself than to some seafood, snacks and wine. The place itself, is very modern, swank, and has a small area of lounge chairs to relax in. The bathroom is spotless, and even has white cloths to clean yourself with rather than papertowels. The service is quick and friendly. They have about 15 styles of oysters that change on the reg, and the ones i had were a decent size, cleaned perfectly, and very fresh. presentation is great here too, simple, and served with the right tools and sauces to dress your oysters. i even snagged an order of their house fries, which were perfect. i asked for a second sauce because that southern dipping sauce was tasty. the sparkling wine itself was okay, nothing to rave about. however, the music was great here. they were blasting some 90s rock and grunge, some sublime and nirvana-just to give you a taste. overall, i enjoyed the visit and would love to come back. well worth the $20 i spent.
2017-03-31,5,Amazing cocktails! Either from the cocktail menu or just tell them what you like and you won't be disappointed--- the bartenders here are true mixologists. The oyster are also delicious - my husband and I are very picky about oysters because people don't know how to shuck them correctly and it's not an easy task but let me tell you this place knows how to shuck as well as some of the best places in the city. The food menu isn't huge but everything we've had is delicious and they give you enough to be satisfied but not overly stuffed. The absolute perfect place for drinks, cocktails and light fare. If I had to give list an opportunity for improvement I'd say they could improve their red wine by the bottle list but it really is hard to find any criticism with this place. O and the service is superb which is always appreciated.
2017-02-16,5,Wonderful.  I love raw bar, I cannot wait to go back again. The seating is unique and cozy.  It is a bit pricey, but I suppose that will help them stay in business with the high rents in Hoboken.  The staff is outstanding. Can't wait to go back.
2017-02-10,5,Best cocktail bar in hoboken, super good cocktails and super nice bartender, we like a lot
2017-01-15,5,The quality and freshness of the raw bar are really top-notch. Got the $60 "4 of the kind" deal for 2, which includes a dozen of 4 types of oysters (3 east and 1 west), 2 types of clams, crab meat, and chilled shrimp. Ordered seconds a la carte because it was so good. Mussels were tasty but on the small side, both in terms of shell size and portion. Fries with bay seasoning were great; they're served with spicy mayo, which actually paired well with the horseradish served with oysters. Drinks were delicious too. One of the best old-fashioneds I've had - strong yet tasty. Sauvignon Blanc was also great.Service was professional, prompt and super friendly. I feel the combination of all those 3 qualities is hard to come by. The decor is trendy with leather lounge couches and bar type tables and stools.  I'll be back.
2016-12-28,5,Came in for cocktails and late night bites. Sat down with only 5 minutes to order food (kitchen closes at 10pm, which we didn't realize), but the bartender was nice about it and got our order in quickly. His oyster recommendations were fantastic and everything else tasted fresh and light, definitely a nice break from the bar food that lines Washington Ave. Great cocktail menu too. Would be a nice spot for casual date night or catching up with girlfriends.
2016-12-15,2,Hoboken is not known for any grownup/"upscale" lounges and that is why I suspect this place has gotten such a high rating. It definitely feels like a place that would be located in NYC but the aside from the ambiance, the similarities come to an abrupt halt. We came here for cocktails and the raw bar. The raw bar was nothing out of the ordinary but the drinks were notably horrible, with prices comparable to the city. Conclusion: If you want a change in neighborhood scenery, crave some edible seafood, enjoy sobriety and are not willing to take that short 15 minute uber to the best city in the world - then it may be worth one's while.
2016-11-18,1,Brutal.  How can you charge 14+ for a drink and not know how to make it properly.  This place has spent a good amount on decor and inventory, but the actual product is a disaster.  Zero Stars!
2016-10-30,5,Most excellent fresh oysters! The cocktails were great as well.
2016-10-27,5,I came here on a Wednesday evening with my fiance to satisfy our seafood craving. We loved everything about this place. Very cozy; intimate spot for a date. We started off with the crab cakes and scallops. Delicious. Followed up with a dozen Westcoast and Eastcoast mix of oysters. Everything was fresh. The cocktails were made to perfection. Wyett and Andres were very knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks were a little on the pricey side but I wouldn't expect anything less from a place like this. We will definitely be coming back here again.
2016-10-23,5,Best, most fresh seafood ever! This place is seriously amazing. I had the crab cakes, a dozen different oysters, and colossal shrimp cocktail - all of which I wish I had seconds. The cocktails are delicious, not too sweet. All the juice is fresh squeezed. The staff was super friendly and accommodating. I'll definitely be back.
2016-10-22,4,This was my first time here and I enjoyed it.  From the parking lot, I couldn't tell if we would be able to sit down.  As we walked through the door, the bar is the first thing that you the venue look crowde, but there was seating in the rear. We're able to sit at two lounge chairs and a couch. The environment was very comfortable. We ordered the mussels and clams. They were very small but very tasty I would definitely come back to this place again.
2016-10-22,1,Andres was so fucking rude.  Unprofessional and things he's better than his customers.  Everyone is so pretentious here.  Don't come here!
2016-10-22,2,Service here is slow and uppity mixologist bartenders are rude, unfriendly and out of place in such a great town. Andre (i think that's his name) is the worst.Oysters were fine, but nothing special. Drinks were pricey but tasted decent. Really just the bartenders left a bad taste.
2016-10-16,3,Great ambiance, good food.  A bit pricey, but given the area, I'm not surprised.  Service isn't very friendly.
2016-10-06,5,I'm reluctant to rave about this place on Yelp because I don't want more people to crowd the place up, but this is EXACTLY what I've been saying Hoboken has needed for YEARS. Fresh, amazing raw bar and great cocktails. This is not necessarily the place where you stay all night, but it's the perfect place for a pre-dinner app and cocktail. The oyster selection is always great - 5 or 6 options from both the west coast and the east coast and it seems like the cocktail menu rotates based on the season.
2016-09-19,4,Raw bar review only. Came here for the Monday happy hour for some oysters and some bubbly. My friend and I ordered the 4 of a kind plate (not part of of the happy hour deal) and two glasses of rose. The rose went from $32 to $16 during happy hour. The oysters were all delicious especially the stingrays, blue points, and two west coasts from Washington state but the names are escaping me. The shrimp were definitely jumbo an juicy. Thank you stingray for feeding my oyster craving!!!!
2016-09-02,4,Delicious oysters and uniquely crafted cocktails. Service away from the bar could have been better and things are a little on the pricey side, but there's no question I'll be coming here regularly to get my oyster fix in Hoboken.
2016-08-15,5,The best Oysters in the area, especially Blue Point! The decor is beautiful and staff is very friendly! Came here a few times with my hubby and once for girls night and each time I was not disappointed!
2016-08-08,5,One of the best raw bars I've ever been to. I was impressed by the variety and freshness of their selection. I had one and half dozen by myself, because it was just so good that I couldn't stop! The bartender is very patient and explained the different types of oysters for each round and asked about my preference for taste. These raw goodies were so fresh that I only added a hint of lemon so I could taste the amazing original freshness. Personally I liked the west coast ones better as they are sweeter and creamier. Cocktails are very good too! Also they have happy hour for half price oysters and sparkling wines - this deal just can't be beaten, honestly. So glad I went to this place!
2016-08-03,5,This place is fantastic.  It's a small, chic seafood bar with great drinks.  The move here is to come during happy hour (which I think is every Sunday through Thursday from 4-6 or 7pm, but make sure you double check the timing).  Happy hour specials include raw seafood (and I think some hot seafood apps), but the best part is the discount on drinks-o think its applicable to sparkling and still wines (not sure about cocktails), but they have specials by the glass, and it's half off any bottle (yes, I said half off any bottle-including the $70 bottle of sparkling wine we got for $35)!  The service was nice/quick, and we never had issues with the food, drinks, or the bill.  A great addition to the neighborhood-I just wish they had more on the menu!
2016-07-27,5,My boyfriend and I always come here for the OYSTERS!! The raw bar here is amazing and the service is impeccable.  The waiter recommended "The Oyster" wine to pair with our Oysters.. we thought- why not?! (It was just too perfect to eat oysters with a wine called "The Oyster").  We were blown away! Not only does this wine pair perfectly with seafood, but the proceeds go to restoring wild oyster reefs!! So glad our waiter recommended this wine.  We can't seem to find it in many locations, so we will definitely be retuning to get another glass! PLUS the bottles each have an oyster shell hanging from the neck! what a unique company.  Will DEFINITELY be back soon for this great atmosphere, awesome food, and great staff.
2016-07-24,5,Great happy hour specials on 1/2 price oysters on Sunday and Monday's with discounted beer and wine.  They also have awesome cherry stone clams that are reasonably priced while not on the happy hour discount.  Staff is friendly and welcoming!  They also allowed our stroller to come into the restaurant
2016-07-24,4,Normally, I would give 3 stars, but the staff and management are so nice - which is not as common as one would think in Hoboken - I give them an extra star for accommodation. Plus, not to mention, they seem to be the only raw bar in town, so I hope for us raw fish lovers, they stick around for a while.So, my comments aren't really criticism, rather a few points of suggestion:Blue point oysters are my fave - if you love the taste of the sea, you know what I'm talking about. The blue points at Stingray, while good, were a bit mild for my taste. I was expecting a bit more of a briney vibe. The horseradish seems to be home made, which they get brownie points for, but it was literally the most mild horseradish I've ever tasted. Literally, no heat. My friend thought I was just being picky until she tried it, and agreed. The flank steak could use some help in the flavor dept. Not that it has none, just not crazy bout the ponzu thing. The string beans were awesome, thought.Crab cakes although small, rock. Perfectly cooked. Could be a bit larger. The shrimp are very good and colossal size. I would suggest working on their cocktail sauce as Kelcher's store brand has them beat. Perhaps adding Worcestershire and/or some Old Bay, etc.Happy hour on Sun and Mon is great thus if you love oysters/clams etc. I would definitely recommend it.Outdoor seating is a bonus.Overall, very glad we found this place. Will definitely be back.
2016-07-24,4,Nice spot for drinks and small plates. Informal setting but it's pretty trendy and zen. Great date spot. Oysters were disappointing but the steak app and eggplant sandwich were off the chainnnn. Would definitely go back!
2016-07-21,5,Hands down my top favorite bar in Hoboken! I'm so surprised when my friends say they never have been. This bar has quality top notch cocktails and the best raw bar around! Not really a place to go for a big dinner entree but great for before/after dinner. Aside from a raw bar they have great small plates as well. The bartenders know what they are doing and I love trying out a new cocktail each time I go....always great to pair with some oysters from all different regions. This place is the real deal!
2016-07-19,5,Everything was perfect here: we started with Mediterranean salad... kind of Greek salad but with  more peppers and less cheese. This was followed by east side oysters (full selection) which is my favourite. Then I had a  chicken sandwich which was very tasty. service was great and although the place was cold they turned down the air conditioning. My wife had crab cakes which she claimed to be the best she ever had!
2016-07-14,4,I usually find myself here either for happy hour or late-night after dinner somewhere else. That being said, I've never tried anything from the actual menu but the oysters are always very fresh and the cocktails are great. I love a good Pimms Cup and the one at Stingray is dangerous- so fruity and delicious without being too sweet or gingery.It's always a good crowd here as well. Everyone is just hanging out and trying to have a good time. It's not at all stuffy even though it could seem that way from the outside. Minus one star because you'll have to wait an obnoxiously long time for a drink when it's busy. Bartenders really take their time.
2016-07-08,4,Nice lowkey place to meet up for a drink before a date. Friendly staff. Drinks a little on the sweet side but tasty and well made.We went here specifically for the oysters, and we weren't disappointed. This would only be my second time trying oysters, but I enjoyed them much more than my first. We asked for a recommendation from the bartender/host and he suggested we get a selection to try. So we got 10 oysters, two of each of the following: stingray .After trying them all, we definitely determined that we enjoyed the stingray oysters the most. They were slightly smaller and more delicate, and they had a good texture - not overly jelly-like. My boyfriend made a comment saying that there wasn't much grit in these oysters like there normally would be elsewhere- and right then, I chewed on a big piece of sand. Ouch. But that was the only one, not sure how common that is as an oyster newbie.As for that atmosphere, it was pretty quiet. It was Sunday of July 4th weekend, and they were open but not busy. The place was quite small- I don't know why I expected it to be large (what was I thinking? This is Hoboken). It pretty much was a narrow room that extended to the back, just consisting of the bar, and a small 2-person lounge-y seating area by the front window. The bar had white tabletop granite, giving a very clean look. Actually, the whole place gave off the clean, white, chic vibe. I expected this place to have an NYC "lounge" feel, but it was more cute and clean cut. All in all, a pretty good, quiet date spot. Kind of pricey ($30something for 10 oysters and $13ish per drink), but they have some happy hour specials you should check out. We definitely want to come back for the 1/2 price oysters (on certain days). Also, the place is pretty out of the way, uptown Hoboken. A bit of a walk if you're downtown. But if you're checking out other places uptown (pier 13, biergarten, etc), it's worth it to stop by.
2016-06-29,4,An excellent first date spot ! No booths, however some cozy couches to get snuggly on. The food was delicious and drinks were on point. not the kind of place to wait to be seated. Just walk in, and find a spot. Great music and atmosphere.
2016-06-15,3,On the plus side, the food is very good, we normally go for oysters plus some stuff and they normally have a very good selection and very fresh  (although we returned one last night, no free oyster or refund for that one bad smelling one?!). The drink selection is better for spirits than wines but good enough. Despite the restaurant being quite empty as we were early, there was not a huge amount of "friendliness" from the barman or someone who appeared to be the owner and it took a while to get some service. Also they seem to have suspended the Tuesday happy hour(s), not sure why because it was not busy. I like the showing of classic movies though. We'll return (as we have done many times) but it's not a "go-to" it once was.
2016-06-15,4,if your menu has anything Goodfellas-related, I'm an instant fan.they've got a drink here called the Jimmy Conway. for those who aren't obsessed with Goodfellas, that's De Niro's character, and Stingray continues the theme by using the vodka brand he endorses (who knew?). vodka, cherry liqueur, vanilla syrup, and lime; sounds like an odd mixture, but I really like it. I appreciate the fact that they've got their own house cocktails in addition to classics such as the Negroni, Manhattan, and Old Fashioned. but I tend to stick to the Jimmy Conway.the drinks aren't cheap, but they're delicious and potent. the bartenders are great.I've never eaten here - while the vast majority of the menu is seafood, there are some other options: plates of cured meats and cheeses, a few salads and sandwiches, and desserts. now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get the papers, get the papers, before I stop by Morrie's Wigs.
2016-06-12,5,What a great time! The sampling of 12 oysters from Maine, New York, Washington & Canada was very good! The creaminess of the New York cupcake oysters were my favorite. The cauliflower & sunchoke plate was very tasty and the anchovies & garlic roasted red peppers plate was another creamy favorite. Thanks to the friendliness of staff, I got to know exactly where the oysters came from, how they are named and if they were wild or farm raised. Definitely looking forward to my next visit!
2016-05-28,5,This place is fantastic!!!  If you like few seafood this place is a hidden gem.   Fresh oysters to die for and 50 cent clams on Thursdays.   My girlfriends and I did a happy hour here and we had a a blast.   I highly recommend this place!   You won't be disappointed.
2016-05-27,5,Awesome spot!!  Oysters were great.  Cherrystone clams were great.  Anchovies were extremely salty (like they should be), hanger steak was verrrrrry good.  Drinks were good.  Decent craft beer. Service was top notch.  Can't wait to come back.  Many specials during the week
2016-05-27,5,Amazing oyster bar, the best I've found in New Jersey! They have an amazing selection of oysters from all over the states. They even serve a Sauvignon Blanc called "The Oyster" that funds the restoration of 100 oysters per bottle. Pretty amazing stuff happening here.
2016-05-19,4,Last night after epically failing to get a sandwich at the warehouse cafe in JC (yes they run out) we decided to try some place new. Stingray lounge saved us from starvation. Thanks to fellow yelpers I was pretty sure disappointment was not an option. As I entered I noticed the trendy decor and set up. You also notice the dim lighting which helps you feel at ease before you order. I sat at the bar and noticed the happy hour chalk board. $3 off sandwiches and $3 off house cocktails (not to be confused with signature cocktails, not happy hour) Well I was sold. They run out of the first sandwich I ordered but fortunately they had two more options. I ended up getting the balsamic chicken sandwich. It really sparked my taste buds. Maybe it's the perfectly crispy bacon in the sandwich. It was so good I ordered a second one.  It comes with a side of potato salad. The crab cakes were fresh and were shaped as spheres, not your typically patties you might find in Baltimore.  Drink: Dutch courage. Gin base.Feels like a martini. The verdict is guilty of coming back for more. I mean I have to try the oysters right? even though their happy hour is hard to reject.
2016-05-14,4,On a Saturday night, Hubby and I seat ourselves (first come first serve, no reservations) at a table by the oyster bar. We were promptly served and found the overall experience pleasing. My complete lack of knowledge of oysters resort to chef's choice of both east coast and west coast oysters and several jumbo shrimp cocktails neatly arranged on a giant platter. Since there was no indication of which oyster was which, I asked the chef afterwards what some of them were based on the left over shell. Now I know I am a east coast girl through and through. :) Surprisingly, the potato leek soup stole the show with all of its creamy and super refined silky texture. I needed something chocolaty to counter-balance all that seafood so their flourless chocolate cake was the perfect chapter to end a delicious meal. The fruit tart that it came with was pretty bad though, like it came straight out of a supermarket container.
2016-05-08,5,Love this place!! Nice vibe with tons of seafood options and specials. So many varieties of oysters and half priced on certain days. Must order- oysters, mini crab cakes, clam bake, desert and tuna crudo. You need to try a cocktail or two- very strong and delicious
2016-05-08,5,Fun place, great vibe. Love the oyster bar and crafty cocktails. Hit the ATM on the way because the place ain't cheap.
2016-05-01,5,If you strictly want to have oysters and a couple of drinks, then this is the place you're looking for! Great atmosphere and service.  This is a real raw bar.
2016-04-29,5,Best oysters ever this place worth it please go and try it you will love it.. Great drinks too all top shelves liquor great bartenders
2016-04-22,4,Oysters and sparkling wines half price at happy hour.  What could be better?  Oh yea, and you get to sit at super cute couches or chairs in the lounge area while enjoying some of the best things in life.  Seriously, can't get better than this.  There is generally a selection of 4 east coast oysters and 4 west coast oysters on a daily basis.  There is an extensive cocktail menu, but for my latest visit, I opted for a bottle of the Sommariva Prosecco which paired with the oysters nicely.  I liked that random guests were asking the shucker questions about the different oyster options, and he disseminated oyster knowledge with confidence. I was a bit hungry, so I opted to for the flank steak and greenbeans cooked in ponzu sauce as well.  The meat was so tender and juicy.  It was a great snack before dinner time.   I've also had their crudos before and both were really yummy too. Four instead of Five stars, because even during happy hour, the oysters go anywhere from about $1.50-$2 each.  I know I can go elsewhere during happy hour for $1 an oyster, however there obviously is a larger selection at Stingray than other places which mainly serve Blue Points only.  Also, there are no substantial entrees here, so it's not a dinner spot.  Makes sense because the place is so small and there aren't many tables here suitable for having an entire meal.
2016-04-15,3,Overall decent place to get some raw bar and cocktails/beer. I went on a few ocassions, place is a bit narrow but well decorated with a loungier hangout space on the other side. Has one of those ice displays where they label all their oysters. Unfortunately the last time I visited was their happy hour littleneck special on Thursdays and a few of the clams were dead/spoiled and the entire platter smelled like low tide. I might be back but regardless I would say this is a good neighborhood place to try out.
2016-03-26,5,My husband and I absolutely love this place! A raw bar with the best oysters I've ever had, amazing small plates and cocktails, right in Hoboken. Try the sunchokes/cauliflower dish as well as the crab cakes! And of course, order mega oysters :)
2016-03-24,5,This place is great! such a chill classy vibe, with only the best of everything from the liquor to the seafood. The crab cakes are amazing and the shrimp is gigantic. Everything is super fresh and the service is very knowledgeable and accommodating! They have happy hour specials, unique cocktails, and the bar tender will even create something just for you. The music was also on point.
2016-03-09,5,Awesome drinks, fresh seafood, knowledgeable staff, cool pop art, but a tad small so not good for big groups. Good, intimate date spot. If ur looking for a cranberry vodka go elsewhere down Washington, the craft cocktails here are way too good to waste the bartenders time.
2016-03-06,5,Love this place!  The cocktail menu is fantastic and has a large variety, the staff is friendly and quick to refill your drink.  The seafood is absolutely fantastic and so are the other small plates on the menu.  The space is clean and well kept and my wife and I love coming here at least once a month for a cocktail and some seafood.  It is never too crowded either.. I would highly recommend this place!
2016-02-20,5,Best cocktail spot in Hoboken - the bartenders are friendly and seriously know what they're doing. They will make you something unique and off menu to drink if you ask. I'm not a big fan of clams/oysters but their other options are excellent. I've had the eggplant sandwich, crab meat cocktail and cheese plate and all have been very good. Good atmosphere as well get this place 5 stars.
2016-02-15,4,This place is fantastic for some drinks and oysters with a coworker! Spent a lot of time discussing business and devouring some amazing oysters during happy hour! I will lost definitely be coming back in the near future
2016-02-07,4,East Coast Girl, for sure!In the mood for oysters but my girlfriend wasn't.She loved her jumbo shrimp cocktail. I don't do shrimp cocktail.I enjoyed the 10 different oysters- very much.7 east coast and 3 west coast.Must say the Blue point and Stingray were my top fave.Kumamoto and Kusshi were a bit too long in the aftertaste.Cape may was huge and delicious.Had to order sauvingon blanc - we loved it.Would I come back again?- For sure!One last thing- do not order Roasted Cauliflower with Sunchoke if you do not like saltiness like myself. No bueno.And For the singles out there - this is definitely a date spot. Cozy up at the bar or in the back with nice white lounge chairs. Have fun!
2016-02-01,4,Stopped in on Saturday night before heading to Dinner. This place is small but super cute and reminds me of a speak easy type of place. We started with cocktails, mine being champagne and shared oysters and a delightful little cheese plate. Will definitely be visiting again soon!
2016-01-30,5,Went last night for the first time and loved it! Got there around 8:30 and we grabbed a seat at the bar. You pick where you sit, and on a Friday night it was crowded but not too bad. The two bartenders were super nice and even gave us free shots. Drinks on the menu were really good, there was one that was essentially an old fashioned but had vanilla syrup and chocolate in it and it was great!We ordered Clams Oreganata, Cauliflower, Crab Cakes, Mussels and a dozen assorted Oysters. All that plus 6 drinks brought us to $157. Everything was DELICIOUS. Will be back soon for happy hour!
2016-01-22,5,Now I've been going to Stingray lounge since it opened and have had the opportunity to patrons this establishment 6 or 7 times in that time span. Most recently my experience was stellar and I couldn't help but think it was just like every previous visit. And that is the gift that Stingray offers...consistency. Every single visit has been a true treat.On this last visit my wife and I asked the bartender to surprise us and I was treated to a Mint Julep that would do any Kentuckian pround and a Bloody Mary that my wife has actually been craving since as she put it " Anyone can make a Bloody Mary but...a good one is another story." As always the raw bar was fresh and the selection second to none. The Stinray doesn't have an huge menu but every item on it is excellent. That you can count on. At the end of the day Stingray is a small oasis on Washington that offers a consistently excellent experience in an intimate setting. Belly up to the bar or in the lounge area you can expect a friendly and informative staff and top of line drink and seafood options. Thanks again Stingray Ray Lounge staff and owners for a great evening.
2016-01-13,5,Great oysters, incredible drinks. I would definitely back for happy hour. Wait staff was attentive and helpful in our drink selections
2016-01-13,5,bartenders are great - cocktails are fantastic, seafood is super fresh. Just a great dining experience - would go back there any time for oysters/clams and great booze.
2016-01-10,5,The freshest oysters in the east! Go Sun - Wed 4-7pm for 1/2 price oysters.
2016-01-03,4,I keep a running list of establishments I want to visit for happy hours I usually can't attend due to work and Stingray has been on my list since it opened last year.  Overall my impression of this place was positive. Great service, beautiful decor in both rooms, solid cocktails, very tasty small plates. Unfortunately, the oysters were only okay. Perhaps a fluke, or maybe it was just one west coast oyster that's wasn't good and damped my enjoyment of the other oysters, idk. On menu bourbon cocktail was very good, but I think I enjoyed my fella's off menu Moscow mule more. Since it was happy hour we got a bottle of prosecco which was great and half price. For food aside from oysters we had the crab cakes and clams oreganata. Both small plates were phenomenal; the crab cakes were delicate and full of flavor and the clams were not overly breaded and let the flavor of the clam come through. Both small plates were a small portion and left us wanting more. Overall I was impressed with Stingray and would comeback again for cocktails and small plates. Happy Hour  (sun-wed 4-7) is a great value for half off oysters and sparkling wine.  Great spot to indulge your tastebuds but you may want to grab dinner somewhere else.
2016-01-02,4,Excellent Hoboken eatery. Amazing fresh shellfish, delicious appetizers, fantastic craft cocktails and a smart and helpful staff. We had a great experience.
2015-12-12,5,Thank you for being in Hoboken!  The Hoboken/JC area was really lacking a good Oyster/Raw Bar place forever until this place opened up a year ago or so.  I find myself here nearly every weekend now.  Excellent vibe, service, mixed drinks and Raw Bar.  I've been to Boston and Baltimore many times which are cities that seem to really excel at seafood and oysters.  This small intimate oyster bar lounge place can compete with the best of them and yet it's in Hoboken.  Really good new clam chowder too!  Keep up the great work and hopefully we see a second location in the future as there seems to be a demand for more places like yours. c
2015-12-03,4,Really love this spot- I feel like this is a hidden place most people don't know about!!! I wish they had abigger menu but otherwise everything else on the menu is delicious! Amazing quality. They also make awesome cocktails. Good vibe and cool decor. I had to take away one star only because it's a bit expensive but that is expected with raw bar/seafood. Happy something like this came to Hoboken-- Will definitely recommend to friends and family!
2015-12-01,5,Honestly cannot say a bad thing about this place. The staff is great - very friendly and attentive including the owner who has always taken time to greet me and chat. The raw bar is unbelievable, the oysters are always fresh and schuked perfectly. I love that I can try them from all over the world some of my favorites have been Northern Lights and Pink Moon. I have also tried the tuna cruda and what I recommend the most is the crab cakes which I get everytime. My favorite cocktails is the Cobbler but all the others are also delicious, well crafter and blended. This place is great just for cocktails but if your a seafood fan like me this is a MUST ! Keep up the good work guys!
2015-11-30,5,Stingray is an uptown Hoboken gem. I've been meaning to try for a while but every time I find myself in 'boken I'm usually much further downtown. I ventured uptown for a show at Maxwells, and because we had some time to kill before it was the perfect opportunity to check it out. On a Saturday night at around 9:00 it was date night central. I don't think there was any party in the space that was larger then two. But, for good reason. This is a perfect spot to bring a date. The lighting is dim and sultry and there are plenty of couches and two top tables to cozy up at. We had already eaten elsewhere, but to my surprise they had a pretty full menu. I knew that there were raw bar options but the menu had some salad, sandwich and entree picks as well. I don't really like raw bar food but know that I know they offer more I'll most certainly come back for food. I went with the cocktail special of the day which had rosemary, gin, blueberries and something that gave it a pinkish hue. It was light and refreshing and because it was on special, was priced at 9.50 which is definitely a bargain for a Hoboken cocktail lounge. Hoboken is mainly sports bars and less cocktail lounges, and this was a really nice change of pace in the neighborhood. I'll definitely be back at this trendy spot next time that I have a date night around here!
2015-11-18,5,Amazingly fresh. You have to start there when writing about a raw bar. Started with the oysters...East Coast and Canadian...they were so briny and so yummy, that I felt like Andrew Zimmern bobbing and dipping on the back of a fishing vessel somewhere in the north Atlantic. Followed with the crab cakes, tuna and red snapper crudo and the clams oreganato, the last two being the most underwhelming of the evening. I am guessing that mostly everything on the menu will guarantee that you become a repeat customer. Great wine list and cocktail menu, too. Another yummy gem in Hoboken.
2015-10-22,5,if i lived in hoboken, i would be here all day everyday! fresh selection of east & west coast oysters, the best shrimp cocktail i have ever had, and the service was perfect. everyone that works at stingray is really friendly and more than willing to talk to you about the food they have. i only had wine, but i'd like to try the cocktails and the happy hour when i come back. five stars!!
2015-10-19,4,I've come here a handful of times since they've opened last October...Food & Drinks: Always consistently great! Seafood is incredibly fresh. Oysters are always well shucked. Space & Ambience: Airy, modem and clean! Service: Great!  The staff are very knowledgable about their menu (both food and drinks). However, some of the servers can stand to be a little more personable and enthused. Overall, I enjoy this place each and every time that I visit and will always come back to satisfy my oysters craving!
2015-10-16,5,Well lit and cozy little space. Very welcoming energy here. I had the crab cake and the little neck clams... Petite and tasty especially for late night dining. ( make sure to order before 11pm) Also tried a drink called  "Aviation". Gin, creme de violette and lemon with a dark cherry... Crisp and yummy. Lovely energy from the staff. I would definitely come back here
2015-10-14,5,I'm an oyster fanatic, so I was pleasantly surprised when this gem opened up. Cute space that I admire from the bar, but I've never been to Stingray for their couches. The food is on point. Definitely not the place for a hearty meal but who cares? Oysters, oysters, and more oysters are all I care about. Sometimes you'll miss out on a couple raw bar menu items, but generally they have a nice selection. Definitely go during happy hour. We make our way up to Stingray early Sunday evenings and never leave disappointed. Half price on my prized prosecco, and of course, the oysters. The service tends to be slow on Sunday's. I can't really comment on any other time of the week, but it's not a deal breaker. It's nice to go and chat and enjoy company, but don't go if you're in a rush. My advice: put in your next round when you get the first one. Great vibes from this place. Five stars all the way.
2015-10-10,2,Service was great but I defiantly have been to better places for oysters (I.e., morimoto in NYC). I had the 4 of a kind and for $60, it's defiantly not worth it. Also, the Bombay and lemonade I swear had only a shot of Bombay. To be ranked the number one place in Hoboken is confusing to me.
2015-09-27,4,Stingray is exactly the kind of placed that I love. Creative cocktails, good spirit selections and a cool atmosphere make this place a great choice when looking for an enjoyable experience in Hoboken.I had a my usual rum drinks and even had the bartender put something unique together for me made with rum. To compliment this, I also got an order of clams casino. Though the taste itself was good, it was way too breaded, causing it to taste slightly lumpy and doughy. If they fix that, they've got themselves a perfect little dish.The atmosphere is loungy and cool. Sort of a trendy vibe but not overly so. It's not a big place, so I can see it getting packed on weekends rather quickly. Either way, the best seat in the house is at the bar as the bartenders are pretty creative and will hook up some good drinks if you ask then to. Definitely a place I'll come back to when I'm in town. The drinks and atmosphere alone are well worth it.
2015-09-23,4,I liked the blue point oysters. Beware that each oyster during happy hour is $2.50 approx. and after 7pm that doubles to $5. The ambiance is nice and so are their $12 cocktails . Not an entree place but is a yuppy cocktail oyster bar which I think was what they wanted.
2015-09-23,4,A true classic, mixology gem located in Hoboken. I came here last weekend as a recommendation from a fellow Elite member looking for some solid, pre-Prohibition cocktails. Stingray was spot on. This place is a galley-like layout: narrow, seats right up at the bar. The entire bar behind is lit, and showcasing bottles for the true cocktail connoisseur: Strega, aperitifs, and hard to find bottles. I loved it. I ordered the Aviation, and a Gimlet, and the guys at Stingray did it right. All fresh citrus', cut daily, and covered by napkins. Proper techniques and new twists on classic drinks make this place a cocktail-finders haven.
2015-09-14,5,Came here on a Friday (early, around 5pm) and sat at the bar for oysters. Bartender was very friendly. Ordered a huge tower of raw bar, and the oyster selection was varied (some west coast, some east coast). They were ALL delicious. They were fresh, cleaned well and just the right temperature. After eating, I walked over to where they have the oysters on ice and got into a conversation with the chef that was shucking them. Very educational! I will come back here definitely. This place exceeds the Lobster Place in Chelsea Market.
2015-09-03,5,Amazing raw seafood!!!!! Love, love this place. Hands down 1 of my favorite places to enjoy fresh oysters & clams. Ambiance is different as they play music out of the 1950's which I appreciate. The bartender we had unfortunately had no personality and wasn't that friendly (we always sit at bar). But, we went a little earlier during the day and I was pleased to see they had a different bartender who was polite & friendly. My BF enjoyed chatting w/ him about the different beers available. Great place! Def must try if your in the Hoboken area.
2015-09-02,5,Came in on a Sunday night with hubby we wanted to grab something light small to eat and decided on some oysters and drinks... Perfect way to end the weekend... So we decided to take a drive to Hoboken and came across this place ... Is tiny and cozy and modern at the same time....Service was great but being that we walked in at 930 we were alerted the kitchen was closing in 30 minutes...OK thnx for the info but everything is raw I was taken a little bit by the comment but I guess is no big deal being that once your shift is ending all u want to do is clean up and finally go home ...Anyway other than that service was great our waitress/ bartender was very friendly and smiled all thru the night even though she was in a rush which is completely understandable...I ordered the sidecar as a drink and hubby ordered a ginger drink I forgot the name sorry, both with plenty of alcohol and worth every penny of it....Now the oysters were fresh and delicious we also ordered the tuna cruda ...delicious can't wait to come back ... Really good quality food and drinks for more than reasonable prices.
2015-09-01,4,Came here last night for dinner and had a great experience. It was a Monday night so luckily it was pretty dead. We sat near the window. I ordered the red snapper drink- sort of like a bloody mary with a twist... not as tomatoey- I liked it!We also got oyster shooters which were perfect!!We got the four of a kind which included 12 oysters - 3 different types, clams, shrimp, and crap meat... everything was soooooo fresh and tasty... loved how the shrimp was so meaty. The oysters were all very different. All good in their own way. The crab meat was probably the best I've had..We then also ordered the clams oreganato which were good, and the crab cake balls- they looked like 3 meatballs but they were amazeballs!!!! definitely recommend.This place is a bit pricey but I thoroughly enjoyed the fresh seafood.Service was also on  top of their game.Wine was also good.Great spot just pricey!
2015-08-26,5,This is exactly what Hoboken needed.  Some place that adults can drink and interact without the usual overage frat boy BS.Food while I thought may be a little pricey, was very well worth it when you factor in the environment you get to enjoy.  Really nice chairs - Gissel and I were able to snag two "boss" chairs in the lounge-type area.  Waitstaff were friendly and knowledgeable.  Must haves:italian sandwich with really good potato saladTuna TartareBlood and Sand cocktailLittle neck clamsI ate a slice at Benny's afterwards though...
2015-08-18,5,Great Cocktails!  We had 5 Huge Shrimp...Chic place with Fresh Seafood and a Great Atmosphere :)
2015-08-17,5,I love Stingray! The food is fresh and drinks are awesome. I've been on a Saturday night and a Sunday during happy hour. Half off champagne and sparkling wines- bottles and wines! And half off oysters. Great deal. Will be going back again.
2015-08-13,4,Oysters are supposed to be sexy, at least that's what people say. The new-in-town seafood bar and eatery does in fact make oysters sexy. It was half priced happy hour so I tried all 12 offered oyster varieties. Even though oysters may not necessarily be my thing, the ones I ate were fresh and almost intoxicating. It is not just about the oysters themselves -- it's about the ambiance as well. There is a captivating silence and refreshing refinement that oozes mature sexiness. The details too, help to make the experience sensual.Despite the trendy vibe, Stingray still maintains a warmth and friendliness. The staff is very knowledgeable, patient, and ready and willing to explain anything. Plus, the 4 to 7 pm happy hour offering half-off oysters and bubbly makes it easy to come, sample and linger.
2015-07-10,5,Hoboken has been waiting a long for an experience like Stingray Lounge. Do you like oysters?  Amazing service? Perfect date spot?  This is your place. Whether you are coming for a cocktail or seafood you won't be disappointed. Thanks to whomever had the vision to give Hoboken a well appointed lounge and raw bar. Thank you.
2015-07-07,4,They had phenomenal oysters. Probably the best I've had in the area thus far! Great service, very friendly bartenders. Though I do have to say they have a small menu and the drinks are very pricey. The place can get very crowded but overall, I had great experience. I will definitely be back!
2015-06-16,4,Drinks are good but a little small/weak for the price.  Have gone two or three times and each time came away with the impression."Very good but not much for the money"Still, delicious so I'll give it 4 stars for now.  Oysters were good, hemingway daquicari worth a shot as well.
2015-06-15,4,I came here only for drinks so I can only rate based sans foodGreat drinks with a posh atmosphere and unique style to Hoboken. Certainly a nice change to the "common" places on Wash.  Service was "ok" hence my 4 out of 5. In sum - cool place to hang out and have a nice cocktail in a smooth style.
2015-06-13,2,Disappointed based on what I read and saw online. Below are several examples  of basic raw bar functions that were missed.We started with what had to be the worst Moscow mule I've ever had, couldn't drink more than a few sips. The hot app's came out first which I would not have expected, but the crab cakes and baked clams were pretty good. I will say i haven't seen littleneck clams that tiny, some were smaller than cockles. The service was OK, not available enough to support us as all the food we ordered flew out. It took 3 people and multiple attempts to get the several varieties of oysters we ordered identified. The mignonette came with no spoon, good luck pouring that into each shell, though there was room given that many oysters had lost their liquor.  The tuna crudo app tasted of flaky sea salt and nothing else and was poorly sliced. The decor was nice, fitting of what they're trying to do here.Did we catch them on a bad night, I'd say no, this strikes me as a place with more style than substance that takes advantage of the built in customer base that comes with a town like Hoboken.
2015-05-28,2,I recently tried this place with my girlfriend on my day off.  The only highlight....The Oysters are PHENOMENAL.  I know because I am a chef.  However the service was among the worse I've ever encountered. It took 20 min for water and 25 min for a beer and Hendricks Martini.  A half dozen oysters and a crab cake was a 40 min commitment.  Sad thing was it wasn't busy. Over promised. Under delivered.
2015-05-13,4,Great raw bar! They are still new, so they need to beef up on the cocktail selection. However, my Dirty Hendrick's Martini was still very, very good. The oysters were fresh, and the clams were amazingly sweet and flavorful! Good appetizers. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the fact that there is now a great raw bar in Hoboken! A definite must see and must experience! Will be going back there again!
2015-05-10,5,Just went back again for more of their goodies and brought my seafood hating husband to test just how good this place was, and boy did they pass with flying colors. We dined on the outdoor sidewalk patio that just opened and had the most pleasant and delicious experience one could hope for. Stingray, you have won a permanent spot my heart as perhaps my favorite place in Hoboken. The best part is that I can come here with my husband and know that we will both be as equally happy. Thank you for that. Our server was extremely delightful and offered the perfect suggestions. When we weren't sure about which beer we wanted, she recommended one and stood behind her suggestion by bringing us both a tasting - how thoughtful! She was right on the money and we ordered that beer. The raw bar entries, for me only of course, were as delicious as I remember from my trip a few weeks ago. The most surprising high note of the night was the food that my husband ordered, the balsamic chicken sandwich. Holy moly that was good! So good that it made me a little envious that I hadnt ordered it. It also comes with a perfect compliment of homemade potato salad, which round its out nicely. Seriously, its that good. Thank you for having a seriously good raw bar with delicious options for those who do not indulge, making it accessible to anyone.
2015-05-09,4,My husband and I have visited Stringray Lounge twice now. The first time we just stopped for drinks while on a walk, the second time we came for dinner. We spilt the crab cakes to start. The were obviously homemade and fresh. My husband had what he described as "amazing" eggplant sandwich. We will definitely be back for the seafood tower.
2015-04-20,4,likely my new fave place for oysters and champagne happy hour. phenomenal selection of oysters, great service. love at first sight!
2015-04-19,4,I'm tired of going to bars in Hoboken with drunk 21 year olds running around so I headed uptown to Stingray's, glad I did! This place is relaxing but still popping.  The layout of the place has really 2 different areas, I was at the bar area but i'll have to check out the lounge side sometime. I didn't try the food but it looked really good. They have fancy drinks but they also have beers so your whole group can find whatever they want. And if your a Yankee fan, the one bartender looks like Brett Gardner.
2015-04-14,4,I'm glad Hoboken finally has a raw bar. Maybe it once did, but for as long as I've been going there, this is the first I've known about. I only learned about the existence of this place and the happy hour because of my fellow Yelpers. No Web site? I understand if the owner Jeff wants to keep this place on the down low to secure seats for his local regulars as Yo Steph points out, but c'mon man. It's 2015!Anyway, the happy hour runs from 4-7 Sunday-Wednesday (maybe Thursday too but I can't check to confirm because there is no Web site). This is the time to go. Half price raw bar and half price bottles of champagne and sparkling wine. They have some good ciders by the bottle too, but overall, the wine selection is pretty scant.All that said, the place is really, really nice and there's a whole dining room on the other side of the bar, which is separated by a wall. I kind of like this feature.The service was decent on a Sunday afternoon, but I had to point out one snafu, which was that I ordered a bottle of 2002 sauvingnon blanc (based on how it was written in the menu), but it came out as 2012. I should have known the price was too good to be true.
2015-04-12,5,Obsessed...that is the word that comes to mind when I think of Stingray Lounge, Hoboken's classy new raw seafood and cocktail bar.  In fact, both of my first two visits were less than a week apart, and I am counting down until my next visit.  The atmosphere was relaxed and fun, yet classy, making it a great spot for a date or as a starting destination for a night out on the town with friends.  The manager, bartenders, and servers were all dedicated to making us feel like we were their #1 priority.  They were friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  Over my two visits, I enjoyed one of their custom cocktails that had a sweet almond flavor; their most reasonable champagne, which was fruity and similar to a sparkling cider; and their Sidecar, which was phenomenal and worth a trip on its own.  The prices were certainly high, but essentially similar to those at Manhattan's top lounges.I recommend going to check it out ASAP!
2015-04-08,4,We stopped in for drinks, and to just check this place out since it is relatively new, and really enjoyed ourselves.Decor: It's a nice place, that has a unique footprint in it's building; it's "quaint." The bar is decent-sized and wraps around the back of the place, the other side is more of a lounge area with chairs and couches. It's hard to choose which side is better! The whole look and feel of the place is really cool, lots of tile and rustic bar, I'm a big fan.Bathroom: I did not use it during this visit.Staff: Our bartender, Matt, was super cool and very helpful with the menu, both drinks and food. If it weren't for him I would have been lost on the oysters. Next time I plan to come in I'm going to have to check and make sure he is working again. Thanks, Matt!Food/Drinks: We started with some drinks: Blanton's on the rocks (delicious, of course!) and one of their house cocktails (very good). We then moved on to some small bites: Crab Cakes (very good), Colossal Shrimp cocktail (great-sized shrimp! YUM!), and assorted oysters: Irish Point, Kumamoto, Blue Point (all good, but the Kumamoto was definitely the best!)Value: The prices are a bit high, but then again it's FRESH seafood so what do you expect? When the final bill came I was a bit surprised, then I remembered all the delicious bourbon and seafood I ate and it started to add up.This is a cool little place that I really would not mind making frequent visits to for drinks or snacks. I'm a big fan and can't wait to come back.
2015-03-29,5,This place is great! Hoboken needed a raw bar and this place seriously delivers fresh raw seafood and great service. I didn't realize how small the location was but once you get past that and focus on the food & service the size of the place doesn't matter at all. It's not inexpensive but you're getting great quality. My friends and I got the platter with a dozen assorted oysters, clams, jumbo shrimp, lump crab meat and lobster. Holy cow. So fresh tons of flavor. The lump crab was incredible. We ended up ordering another round of crab and 1/2 dozen more oysters. I can't wait to go back. This isn't a place you go to if you're looking for sit down entrees but if you're looking to pick at great seafood and interesting cocktails this is the place. The bartenders are super knowledgable & helpful. I wanted to try something a bit different than my usual vodka soda. After letting the bartender know what I like and didn't like she recommended a gin cocktail. I told her I absolutely hated gin but she assured me that she could change my mind. I'm always up for a challenge so she mixed me up a cocktail and I have to say she really did change my mind. It was not the gin I've tasted in the pat that mirrors pine needle taste. She totally impressed me and that's tough. The gin was Plymouth Gin if you're looking to try something new.
2015-03-20,4,If you like fresh seafood, knowledgeable staff and AMAZING drinks, look no further! The oyster selection is great but if you're not an oyster fan (acquired taste, I know), there's a variety of light bites... including the most colossal shrimp I've seen outside of NOLA. Prices are not cheap but I heard they have a good happy hour deal so that's an excuse to go back. Plus, a cute date spot. Thumbs up!
2015-03-20,4,Nice little spot in Uptown, perfect for a date or after-work drink. The bartenders here definitely know what they're doing, and they make one helluva Moscow Mule. Very low-key place though - few of my friends came through here on a bar crawl on the way from The Madison and felt extremely out of place. If you're sloppy, you'll stick out like a sore thumb at Stingray, which automatically separates this from every other Hoboken bar. They have a good lookin' raw bar, so come hungry if you're into that type of stuff.
2015-02-21,5,I've only been there for oysters so far and they were great! Get there for happy hour oysters 4-7.  Still waiting to get a stone crab claw as they were out the two times I went.
2015-02-16,3,Pricy pricy pricy! Manhattan prices in Jersey? The place is upscale but be prepared to dish out some mad cash. $20.00 for a glass of wine? I could be on the rooftop somewhere in the city. Overpriced.  The Oysters are great though. Could've been a weekly hangout if the drinks were cheaper or had better drink specials. Good one time date night.
2015-02-15,4,Excellent sea food, very fresh and served instantly after being shucked. Great vibe. No TVs! No Steakheads! The maitre dude was slightly aloof but the chef came over and excitedly answered our questions and told us which were his favorite oysters and why. Great tunes. Elaborate drink menu. What Hoboken needed ten years late but when sipping a Don Julio 1942 tequila at the bar it feels right on time...
2015-02-09,2,$19.00 FOR  A GLASS OF WINE?!?! Seriously?? Am I the only one who thinks this is totally crazy?? Had the Japanese scotch instead, which wasn't anything to rave about...the cold lobster was okay; the baked clams so salty I couldn't eat them. Sadly overrated, like everything else in this once cool town...
2015-01-25,5,My friend suggested we check out this raw seafood bar in Hoboken and I was massively confused as I had never heard of this place before, but super excited to check out a new spot. Anyway, I loved it! I really hope this place makes it and stays in Hoboken, it's awesome! We walk in and all I see is this beautiful massive marble bar with about 20 seats, tons of unique liquors, and a gorgeous display of raw seafood. Very upscale & classy looking. The cocktail menu had about 10 drinks on it, I was the pain in the butt that had to order something off of the menu, but they made it well (I had a Pisco Sour). My two friends ordered Bloody Mary's. They only offer fresh seafood appetizers, nothing else, so it's excellent for a date or a quick bite, but I wouldn't go starving. We ordered a seafood platter to hold us off before dinner which included 3 Blue Point oysters, 3 clams, and 3 oysters (I can't remember which ones as I'm not a huge oyster fan), 3 pieces of shrimp cocktail and raw crab meat. Delicious. After my Pisco Sour, I asked the bartender to mix me up something sweet, it was exceptional. Awesome mixologist! I believe their cocktails are about $15 each, I forgot how much the seafood was, but I think it was reasonably priced considering it's all super fresh. I will definitely be back. I walked to the bathroom at one point and checked out the other room where they have one high top table that seats about 6 and a couple lounge chairs towards the windows at the front of the restaurant. Super cute, cozy, date like atmosphere. When we walked in the place wasn't too crowded, but by the time we left it started to get really crowded. They have 1 tv above the entrance door that had sports on (about 36 inch flatscreen). I will definitely be telling others about this place, and hope that more spots like this open up in Hoboken! Classy, trendy, friendly, upscale, ever so pretentious but in a good way, absolutely perfect.
2015-01-23,5,One visit and I'm in love, an absolute rarity.No wall to wall tvsNo DJ douchymic spinning the hottest no request songs.No "fraternity party" vibeThis is a place that has some outstanding cocktails in a great bar setting. They had one TV that I could see and you had to really search to find it, which is great. It seems every new place in town has to have wall-to-wall TVs. Call me old fashioned but I enjoy talking to people and this is the place to do it. They had a mix of 90s alt. rock and some old motown. It wasn't at a ridiculous level and it was just relaxing. This is definitely a place where a bro or woo girl would walk in and walk back out, and that's why I love it. It's low key. I didn't even know if i wanted to write a review because I want to take my Stingray Lounge football home and keep it for myself.The bartenders were incredibly friendly and just outstanding. They chatted up when they could and were very personable. The drinks were fantastic, albeit yes, a bit pricey but worth what you are getting. Beers were very reasonably priced if you aren't into designer prohibition era cocktails.They have some small bites, mostly oysters, I don't eat sea food so I can't comment on that. But who cares, this is a great place to chill, have a drink and enjoy the company of the ones you are with. I love it, my bank account may not.
2015-01-21,5,Great new local spot.. Delicious drinks, cool bar scene.. and the tuna app I had was delish.. Would def come back and wish this place lots of luck and long stay in business!
2015-01-18,3,Unimpressed and expensive. Nothing special at Stingray.  Not impressed with the crab cakes and shrimp- both frozen. The tuna was decent. The raw bar - oysters were average. The specialty drinks were good.
2015-01-17,4,This is exactly what Hoboken needed. Drink menu is strong. Oyster selection is the best in town. The tuna crudo is sensational. With a big group? Get the Royal Flush.If you love oysters, this place is for you.
2015-01-09,5,Stingray is a fantastic and relatively low-key lounge/bar uptown in Hoboken. It's got a very laid back vibe, fantastic service, and an excellent cocktail menu that's constantly rotating. I haven't had the food there yet, but last time my boyfriend and I were there, the crab cakes came very highly recommended, so that will have to happen next time. The space is U shaped, with one side being a huge bar and the other side with awesome oversize couches and chairs. The spot itself is made for conversation - the music is on, but absolutely not overpowering (or even close to it), there isn't sound on the one TV that I saw while there, and the cocktails are pricier (though on par for the NYC area) than other Hoboken bars. The bartenders know their shit and it's a lot of fun to watch them mix up the cocktails. My most recent visit here, I had a take on a Negroni (the actual name I can't remember), with gin, Vermouth, and an orange peel, which was delicious. Cocktail prices range from $13-$15, beers are ~ $6-$7, and they have a few small plate options as well, though not an extensive menu. My boyfriend and I have come here a handful of times and enjoy it every time. It's a fun, laid back place to either start or end the night with a drink or two, though I don't think this is really the place you'd go to spend all night. More upscale, so like other reviewers have said, don't go expecting after hours drink specials or blaring music - and make sure you like the person/people you're going with, because there are no distractions to keep you from wanting to die inside if you go here with bad company (but that's your fault, not Stingray's).
2015-01-07,4,So I love a good craft cocktail.  Something with a fancy name, takes a bit of work to make, and tastes just as good as it looks.  Stingray certainly delivers on this front.  I cannot say anything about the food because we didn't sample anything while we were there but I can say that it's mostly a raw bar.  They have a few other offerings on the menu, but it is quite small as they are really letting the fresh seafood stand on its own.  Drinks were interesting and delicious.  Our bartender seemed a bit stiff, but just could have been an off night.  We got there around 6 and the bar was very empty and the lounge even still had some seats but by the time we left at 7:30, patrons were circling our seats ready to pounce.  Prices are expensive but you certainly get what you pay for.  If you are looking for fireball shots and cheap beer go somewhere else, this is not the place for you.  Great for a drink and a snack before or after dinner.  Welcome to the neighborhood Stingray!
2015-01-02,5,You don't have the travel far to get the same quality and atmosphere as this posh new lounge. I love the color scheme and atmosphere of this place- warm grey with fresh white. Came here with my bf for date night and it was everything we wanted- sophisticated, fresh oysters and slammin drinks. The prices unfortunately are steep but the quality is amazing.We ordered our drinks first, the Dutch courage $12 and the classic Manhattan $13. Drink quantity is skimpy so don't except much. The taste though was amazing. The Dutch courage is an interesting drink that composes rose and almond together. Very nice. To eat we had half dozen of honeysuckle oysters and half dozen of clams on the half shell. Ice cold and bursting with ocean flavor. Very fresh.For hot food, we tried the crab cakes which were beyond delish ($10). Three baby crab cakes that were ALL crab. We also tried the eggplant sandwhich was good but not amazing. I wish the bread was toasted and there was more pesto so it wasn't so dry. We also had the fluke Crudo which was one of my favs of the night. Asian influence and very tasty.We came on a Monday night and the bad was packed but the back/lounge area was free. I'm sure if you come on a weekend night you can't even get in. Parking in Hoboken is also a struggle but it shouldn't deter you from coming here.
2014-12-04,4,I was strolling on Washington hoping for some Italian for dinner and passed by this little gem. I noticed the oyster sign outside on the right and the sexy looking set up inside and was most intrigued. We decided to take a look inside and have a drink. The drink turned into two and some oysters and I am officially a fan of this place. It's sexy and mature and has a West Village vibe. It has an environment and style that Hoboken is sorely lacking. The drinks were great, decor excellent, and oysters delicious. I gave it 4 stars vs 5 just because the bartender didn't seem as knowledgable as I'd expect in a small, intimate place like this but he made great drinks and was very nice. I'm definitely going to return here.
2014-11-30,5,Finally! A beautiful place in Hoboken for great drinks and oysters. Beautiful decor and well educated bartenders
2014-11-29,5,Upon entering the Stingray Lounge I immediately realized it was offering up something different than your typical Hoboken bar. A very relaxed vibe with an extremely welcoming feel and charm makes you feel like you've been coming to this establishment with your friends for years as soon as you walk in. They offer a wide array of well made cocktails on top of an extensive menu of choices to choose from. I very much enjoyed trying new whiskey's and bourbons at an affordable price. The wait staff was extremely friendly, attentive and knowledgable about their product. All of the food we ordered was exquisite. I've never tried oysters before and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked them. Offering many kinds from around the world it was interesting to see how they all differed from each other. Also all of the wait staff, especially the general manager had faces like beautiful earth angels. After a night of laughs and tom foolery with my good friends I'm giving the Stingray Lounge 5 stars... in short, it rocked my butt off.
2014-11-23,5,We've been eagerly awaiting the Stingray Lounge's opening for quite some time, and it didn't disappoint. They remodeled and swankified the old India on the Hudson into something that is unique in Hoboken- a cocktail and raw seafood driven bar and lounge. We went as a group of 4 on a Saturday night and were lucky to snag two seats at the bar- otherwise the place was packed!  The crowd was a bit more mature than the usual suspects downtown. If you like dollar oysters or Coors light, you might wanna skip this one. We just wanted a light snack before dinner elsewhere so we had a few kushi and kumamotos each. They were expertly shucked, mellow, and flavorful. Served with horseradish, vinegar, and lemon- they left us wanting more! We washed them down with sparkling wine, craft beer, and a cocktail from the very appealing list. We will definitely return to try more of the menu! Perfect date spot or cocktails and light bites before you move on elsewhere.
2014-11-22,5,I went to the Stingray Lounge last night and had a great time. The food and atmosphere are great; along with the full line of custom cocktails that speakeasy type bartenders carefully prepare for you. I personally enjoyed the raw bar and liked the fact that they had both east coast and west coast oysters. I thought the price point was on par with similar style restaurants in Hoboken; so no sticker shock at all.I will certainly be headed back here.
2014-11-20,5,Shhhhhhh. The owner Jeff mentioned he wants to keep his spot low key and chill and fall slightly under the radar so his local regulars will always have a spot to come to. Too bad Jeff, I'm letting the cat outta the bag.I love this spot and wish it 'twas in Jersey City, but my bank account may prefer that it stays in Hoboken. This is more lounge/bar than restaurant, so those coming expecting to order dinner, although you can, you may be a bit disappointed since the food menu is more snacks and oysters/raw bar. The venue itself is divided into two sections - as you enter a long bar with about 20 bar stools and then up around the bend you see a long communal table and two "loungey" sections with little leather couches and chairs with tables. So intimate, so sexy.I'd honestly suggest coming for a few cocktails and a round of oysters before dinner, then returning for a post dessert night cap in this sultry, upscale spot. If you happen to not like oysters or seafood for that matter, there is the most amazing little eggplant sandwich ($10), but other than that you are S.O.L (shit out of luck). The oyster menu is divided into east vs west and very accurately priced. There is no gouging here - and that was a) a shocker and b) made me love this place even more. You will not see $1 oysters, lets just get that on the table. i nibbled on a few oysters and really enjoyed the previously mentioned eggplant sandwich. Fried eggplant sandwiched between crunchy Choc Au Pain bread with a nice smear of aioli. LOVE. The accompanied side potato salad was surprisingly delicious and hearty. So simple, yet so so so good. The price tag again, fair.They literally have every type of booze possible. I stuck with Buffalo Trace cocktails as I was with my homegirl from BT and the bartender hooked me up with an ever so simple, but delicious BT, real ginger, lemon and simple syrup concoction. They also have a diverse speciality cocktail list that I will definitely explore upon my return. I didn't see any tap handles or wine for that matter - so I'd double check on that if it happens to be a deal breaker.There are a tv or two, but don't expect sports, but rather old back & white movies. Music was an eclectic mix of sounds, but no top 40 hits or EDM and for that Stingray, you are a Hoboken pioneer (ahem, since the old Maxwell's has departed) and I love you for it. The brief conversation I had with the owner Jeff was really impressive. He's very passionate about his venue, so much so that a lot of refinishing and decor was built with his own two hands (i.e. the most beautiful farm table that he repurposed himself from the old wood that came from the building). He comes across as both kind and authentic and clearly you see that in his business.Who knew one could go so lengthy with a cocktail and oyster bar? I hope you'll be as impressed as I was.
2014-11-19,5,Friendly bartenders, nice design of space, extremely reasonable pricing for fresh oysters (compared to Biggies at $3.50/oyster) they come in between $2-$3/oyster.  Also, they make their own horseradish- big plus. They have 3 different flavors of bitters- nice to have options beyond the typical orange bitters. I was excited to try their tuna crudo but the bartender came back to tell us they sent their tuna shipment back because the freshness wasn't up to par- okay by me! Any spot that upholds quality over quantity is great in my book.Their pickled vegetable small plate was outstanding! So simple but crunchy and flavorful, not soggy like at other restaurants. Great experience here and will definitely be coming back!
2014-11-14,5,As Hoboken continues to go more upmarket this type of place was inevitable - a nice cocktail bar on Washington with oysters to boot.It's a small place so get here at a reasonable  time or wait a couple of minutes as the patrons are quite transient, stopping only for a drink or two.Nice raw bar (shrimp were amazing), great selection of oysters (homemade horseradish!!!), good strong cocktails.Girlfriend had the tuna crudo and loved it so much I didn't have any. We will be coming back.Oh, staff are great as well. Given that tends to be a general annoyance of mine it's worth praising people when they do well.
2014-11-08,4,Friendly staff, great seafood, nice new addition to the neighborhood.  Uptown Hoboken is the perfect place for this business as the clientele for good seafood and pricey drinks is definitely here.  This bar is definitely upscale and will be a great place to escape the loud/rowdy crowds downtown.  Stopping in after work, the oysters and wine were a real treat.  The employees here are knowledgable and friendly with suggestions.  I was impressed with the service.  The narrow formation of the bar is a bit of an obstacle as there is no real place to stand around once the seats are full.  However, once you turn the corner and get to the "lounge" area, standing room is plentiful.   I'm looking forward to spending more time at Stingray Lounge as it becomes a part of the neighborhood!
2014-11-06,4,Great spot for some refreshing shellfish and cocktails. Stopped in last night for a few rounds of west coast oysters, shrimp cocktail, and clams. Each round of shellfish came on one big plate for our group to share with cocktail sauce and a mignonette. We also had some half lobsters and from the piece of claw I had; 3 thumbs up. In addition we tried the tuna crudo which was presented beautifully. The vivid green sauce was heavy on the citrus, garlic, and wasabi and outshone the tuna itself which was just okay. The bartenders are very attentative and the cocktail list has some winners packed with quality ingredients. My only knock might be that the menu is pretty limited, and filling up on shellfish can be tough especially if you're looking to soak up some of that alcohol. There were free sandwiches, shrimp, and salad by the bar but I'm not sure if that's an every day/all the time thing. Either way looking to come back soon!
2014-11-02,5,Stingray Lounge is a great addition to the neighborhood. The delicious oysters are perfectly complimented by the beautiful cocktails crafted by badass bar manager Chris Miller. Looking forward to a return visit.
2014-10-28,4,I stopped in here this past Saturday because I love oysters and remembered hearing about it opening up soon. I was borderline shocked at maybe 5:30 on a Saturday the bar seating was basically full and the many of the other seats were filling up as well. The inside was a nice/classy vibe. We ended up getting a dozen oysters from the 6 locations they had (4 east coast; 2 west coast) and I was very happy. They also have other light seafood options but the oysters were excellent. One of the staff was telling me they plan to rotate at least some of the locations, which really hope they do. Overall I thought it was excellent and will definitely be returning at some point in the near future.
2014-10-24,5,FINALLY, STINGRAY IS OPEN. My friends and I have been waiting months for SRL to open and it did not disappoint. The decor is a mix of cool blues and whites with rustic wood accents. The bar is chic and spacious enough for you to eat at. The personal touches and accents really elevate this lounge from others in Hoboken. There is no branded glassware or barware, and all the garnishes are stored in adorable mason jars. The menu is limited but high quality.  There are a few vegetarian options but the bulk of the menu is seafood based (rightly so).  I ordered the jumbo lump crabmeat cocktail and the tuna crudo. Both were amazing. My friends ordered a variety of oysters, clams, and jumbo shrimp, all of which received rave reviews.  We especially loved that the raw bar selections came with both cocktail sauce and a mignonette.  It was a great alternative. The drink selection is a combination of classics (Moscow mule, Manhattan, Old fashioned) and their house speciality cocktails. Everything tasted fresh and delicious.With a definite lack of seafood restaurants and upscale cocktail lounges in Hoboken, I have no doubt that SRL has found its niche and will be a big hit uptown.
2014-10-23,5,I've been walking past the Stingray Lounge sign for months now, just waiting for this little spot to open its doors. Last week, the upscale oyster bar had a soft opening - that's right, they're officially ready for business! At first glance, the interior is sleek and pristine. When you take a good look around, you see the rustic and adorable "old Hollywood" touches. Plus, it smells great! We were a group of five and chose a spot around the corner from the bar near the window. The couches and oversized chairs are very comfortable and it was a great spot to hang out. Everyone at our table ordered a drink and the Moscow Mule and Martini got rave reviews!We came for dinner, so we ordered quite a bit. Between my boyfriend and I, we got two eggplant and pesto aioli sandwiches (we started with one and liked it so much we ordered another), two jumbo shrimp, four clams and four oysters. Everything was excellent! I especially liked the dipping sauce that came with the shellfish.This is a great spot for pre-dinner drinks and apps or to hang out for the night like we did. Can't wait to go back!
2014-10-16,4,The restaurant recently had a soft opening on October 12th. Even with it just opening the staff was excited and trained up! Thank you Christy (spelling?), Jeff and Winston for making it feel like local place. This could become a neighborhood gem by focusing on what they know best with quality oysters, cocktails, and classic black and white film. To get to the food, the oysters were great! They should be receiving a daily delivery which will ensure they continue to stay fresh. Wine selection was great in order to pair with oysters. Next time we want to try the baccala salad!
