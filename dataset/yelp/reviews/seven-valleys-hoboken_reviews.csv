2021-10-17,4,Great great kebabs! Ordered takeouts of Bakhtiari Kabab (beef and chicken) - very flavorful and just yummy yummy. Good portion which I got half rice and half shirazi salad. Also got the lamb shank, though it was a good portion, I wasn't too huge fan of its sauce which to me was a little too light. I liked the seasonings on the kebabs much better.
2021-10-15,2,For a persian restaurant, they got the kababs wrong. If you're not persian, you won't notice and will enjoy. We had Soltani Kabab and beef Gheymeh. The Koobideh looks and tastes like Kabab digi to me (a pan boiled and fried ground beef). It was not close to the Persian Koobideh that I have had in the 28 years of my life in Iran. I had soltani here last year in 2020, and thought there might have been a mistake, so I gave it another shot this year. However, it was the same!  The beef and fat ratio seemed off both times. The "barg" was tender and delicious, but it was filet cubes (Kabab Chenjeh) not an unrolled one piece filet. The beef Gheymeh was delicious as expected :)
2021-09-18,5,Embarrassed that this was my first time dining at this wonderful establishment. Sat outside on a lovely evening and was so impressed by the excellent and warm service. Then by the food. For starters we had especially delicious hummus and the most addictive tahdig with pomegranate and walnut sauce. Both of our entreeÃÅs were equally delicious - the lamb shank fell off the bone and was marinated in the most subtle but deeply herbed sauce; and my steak kabob was perfect.  Can't say enough about how satisfying a meal this was. I will be back for sure to sample more Persian delights.
2021-09-16,5,This place is a hidden gem in Hoboken. I had the vegetarian Kabab. It was tasty. Some grilled veggies with iranian rice and hummus on the side. Recommended for all vegans and vegetarians!!
2021-09-14,5,Incredible!!!! Ordered 2 days in a row food is so good fresh and you can tell good quality meat. Really happy this place opened and its nearby in hoboken. An absolute gem if you are looking for middle eastern food. I get the chicken soltani! Its so addicting. Thank you!!!! We needed this in hoboken.
2021-09-01,4,Finally got to try this place for takeout (which I would recommend because there isn't that much seating). I ordered the Chicken Soltani (one skewer of chicken kebab, one skewer of koobideh kebab, served with rice or Shirazi salad and grilled tomato). I'm trying to cut back on carbs so I opted for the salad only, but I liked that they give you the option of doing half rice and half salad. The salad was only okay - it was a bit oily. It's pretty much like a Shepherd's salad. I'm not sure what the difference is between the two, if any. Both of the kebabs were amazing. The meat was tender and flavorful - especially the chicken. Don't let the looks fool you because it looks like it could be dry but it's actually the complete opposite. Can't wait to go all out next time and try some of their specialty rices!
2021-08-27,2,The food was ok. The waitress never came to any of the tables unless we flagged her down. It was overpriced, we waited an hour for it to come, and it was really hot in there. Would not recommend.
2021-08-07,5,We stopped by very accidentally at Seven Valleys a week ago and were very surprised. We ordered Medley for two and appetizer with eggplant. An appetizer was delicious, fresh and light. The plate for two had chicken kabob, beef kabob and two ground beef kabobs which came with rice and salad. Rice was insanely tasty and salad was super fresh! We had a cup of tea which just blew me away, there were some spices in it and I really enjoyed another cup with baklava for dessert. Baklava was fresh, not too sweet and very well balanced. Loved every bite of it! We came back the next day and I ordered vegetables kabob and it was delicious as well. Today I stopped by to get it to go. Besides that, service is very polite, not too much pressure with a very good timing for every dish. Highly recommend this place!
2021-07-27,1,This restaurant does not honor reservations. We made a reservation for four at 7:15 and arrived promptly at 7:15. The table was given away with the comment "sorry, we didn't think so many people would show up". Which doesn't even make sense, as they had to seat the people in our table. Hence this review.
2021-07-11,4,1st visit last week. Small space, few tables out front were cute. Had one of the stews. Good stuff. I waitress friendly. Not big portions, a little pricy. But, would go back again.
2021-06-29,5,Always fresh. Always yummy. Love this place!  I've gotten their salads, chicken, shrimp, ground beef kabob, and baklava and all are delicious
2021-06-13,5,Now that everything has finally opened up it's time to feast as much as possible  time to get back out and support all the little spots again and so we decided to take a trip to Hoboken with the family and go to this little gem of a restaurant. This Iranian cuisine is a cute little restaurant located on 10th street and is just the cutest place. The decor is a mix of boho chic with Mediterranean vibes. We were greeted by a lovely young lady and sat outside. The seating is super pretty with lovely flowers surrounding you and the lovely sight of people walking in the neighborhood. You might think that's funny or absurd but the fact that we are able to go out again makes you want to see people as much as you can  Now let's get to the good part. The FOOD Appetizers: we ordered the masto khiar which is yogurt with dill and cucumber and garlic. It's super refreshing and light. We also ordered the tahdig with a side stew (gheimeh)Tahdig is hands down one of the best dishes in the Persian cuisine. It's friend crispy rice and then you can pour the stew on top. We all were fighting for the last bite. MUST HAVE. For dinner we ordered the mix medley grill, a mixture of ground beef kabob, a beef kabab skewer and chicken kabab skewer which came with two sides of Persian rice. (PERSIAN RICE IS FANTASTIC)The kababs were super juicy and delicious. Very flavorful.For drinks we had sodas, a salty yogurt drink (very refreshing and minty) and tokhmeh sharbati which is a sweet drink mainly of rose water, honey and chia seeds. And for dessert we couldn't resist ordering the Persian saffron ice cream and Persian black tea. If you are in the area you must stop here. It is tasty and delicious. Can't wait to be back. Also have to note that we were served by a lovely server, he was super attentive and friendly. A side note, the place was spotless, everyone was wearing masks and gloves and practicing the regulations. Amazing spot
2021-06-11,2,The food is really good here, but giving just two stars for the service because the two female servers I've encountered recently are only nice to white people. They act as if everyone else who comes in here is UberEats or some other food pick up courier if they're waiting to be seated.There used be a white male server who was tall and thin who treated everyone the same and was pleasant. The two women who are there for lunch service need to be nicer to other people, not just white patrons they already know or other patrons they approve of.
2021-05-23,5,Been here a number of times now and it's been great each and every time!  Service and food are five stars.  The meats is always perfectly cooked, very tender and juicy.  Seasoning are perfect, delicious.  I ordered the beef and chicken kabobs combo a few times now and it's been consistent every time.  It's BYOB, bonus.  They have outdoor seatings set up in front of the restaurant, nothing fancy.  Great place for great food with great service.
2021-05-15,5,Very good food and excellent service. I had the lunch special chicken kabab and crispy rice. The waiter and the owner where attentive and charming. BYOW (bring your won wine) was the perfect detail to this charming restaurant. A must go for a casual relaxing time. Food was delicious and well prepared. Waiter was attentive. A great choice for an afternoon or evening dinning in Hoboken. Better than NYC for sure. Will come back for sure.
2021-05-11,5,Before coming here I'd never tried Persian food, and let me tell you, I've been missing out! We started with the bread basket and this sweet yogurt dip at the table and this only continued to get better as the meal went on! Next, we tried the Dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves) and they were the best I've ever had! To the point where I almost ordered some to go! For our main courses we got the Vegetarian Kabobs and the Beef Kabob which came with rice and both of us didn't leave anything on our plates! Finally, for dessert we split the Baklava and Persian Hot Tea and I think I just about died and went to heaven! The Baklava was so sweet and crispy but then just melted in your mouth! We ate outdoors because it was a really nice night but the inside looked adorable. It's very small (maybe 6 tables) so I highly recommend making a reservation if you know you want to sit inside on a weekend. The wait staff was super friendly and we will definitely be going back. Also, it's BYOB!!  It's rare to find a restaurant in Hoboken that's BYOB and not Italian or sushi so this is a big plus! Also, their lunch specials look great so I'll be checking that out in the near future!
2021-04-24,5,We picked up the chicken lunch special to go and it was perfect. The portion was perfect for lunch and the chicken was really flavorful. The lunch special came with rice, salad and a choice for dessert to satisfy your sweet tooth and end on a happy note. Overall, the order and pickup was seamless and the food super tasty. Can't wait to go back!
2021-04-16,5,Seven Valley's has been a frequent take out option for us during the pandemic. I know absolutely nothing about Persian food, but have a sincere interest in knowing absolutely everything about Persian food. What I really like about the menu at Seven Valleys is that they make several of the dishes with meat or vegetarian. As a non-meat eater I really appreciate getting to eat the traditional dishes everyone else can order but that have been tweaked to suite vegetarians. Which brings me to my favorite dish here, not a vegetarian friendly dish but rather a pescatarian friendly dish, the salmon (cooked in a lemon saffron sauce and served with Baghali (PERSIAN DILL, LIMA BEAN & SAFFRON) rice. This is without question my favorite take/delivery salmon dish from any local restaurant. The price point is right in the middle, the rice side is delicious, and the salmon is always nicely cooked and never fishy.
2021-03-27,2,I really wanted to like this place because it is so close to us and had such great reviews, but after making a rare dining trip to eat Persian food for Nowruz (the new year celebrated in much of western and central Asia), I was sorely disappointed. The suggestions here come from 1) having grown up with the cuisine and culture, and 2) growing up with a parent who worked in Persian restaurants (and fine dining in general) for many years. I write this in the earnest hope that management takes the criticisms to improve. As of now, I would take the longer drive to practically any Persian restaurant in North Jersey before returning here. If there is any clientele that they are catering towards, it is not those who are intimately familiar with the food or culture. I guess that works for Hoboken.First of all, I had seen several Nowruz specials advertised on the restaurant's instagram stories. When we arrived, however, all but one of the specials had run out. Not even the traditional sabzi khordan (a very traditional herb and cheese platter that practically all Persian restaurants have year-round), which they had advertised as a "special." How any restaurant lacks the oversight to maintain its holiday dinner specials past 8pm is curious to me. We have gone out extremely rarely during the pandemic, so given the luxury of the evening, this was a big disappointment.What we did order was overall average, especially for the price. I could see how this would be exciting for someone who might not know the food at all. However, if you are Iranian, you know damn well that the beef kabob (labeled on any other Persian menu as "barg kabob") should be done with filet mignon, and therefore should be lean and tender. This was not that. It also most certainly was not "char grilled" as advertised. Instead, the kabob seemed like it had been broiled, with none of the dark crisp color around the edges--on either the chicken or beef skewers--that one would expect. I also did not expect the beef kabob to be so fatty. I will say that the marinade was very good, but the cut was not at all right.The rice was fine. The shirazi salad and the gheimeh were alright, if not a little oversalted. I would recommend anyone who come here maybe stick to those options, they give you a decent intro to the cuisine.Service was very slow. I do not fault the server so much as management for not realizing that this would be such a busy day for to-go orders in addition to dine-in orders. It took over 10 minutes in a restaurant of 4 tables (none with more than two people) to even get the menu card, or a glass of water. The waiter was very occupied helping manage take-out orders. They clearly could have used another hand on deck, at least just for the holiday.Finally, this is the only Persian restaurant I have ever seen in my life where there was not even a traditional Nowruz spread to be seen anywhere. While I understand this may seem a little thing to some, but it is honestly what makes a Persian restaurant feel familiar and welcoming for the new year. I know that it's a pandemic year, but for those of us who are part of the culture--it's like coming to a Christmas dinner with no Christmas decor to be found. It really did feel spiritless, and I was surprised (as was my non-Iranian partner) when walking in. Honestly, it just made me feel more homesick.Seven Valleys, I would love to see you do better. Persian cuisine must reflect care and hospitality. I get that times are tough, and I see overall others have enjoyed your food, but personally, I was expecting more.
2021-03-17,4,The cherry rice (or any of their specialty rices really) are an absolute must! Also, the chicken kebabs had the perfect moist texture. I'd definitely go back.
2021-02-06,5,Awesome food! We had Soltani kobab and Fesenjoon! Great quality! The kobabs were very tender and the side salad shirazi was very flavourful :)
2021-02-06,5,Best fesenjoon. I loved it so much. Sour cherry rice was also delicious. Love love love this place and can't wait to come back
2021-01-17,5,Such an amazing spot for some persian cuisine. Have ate at the restaurant and ordered takeout so many times and everything has been absolutely incredible. One of the best persian restaurants in the area for sure.
2020-12-20,5,The best food!! And a BIG YaY..Oh MY!! This place offers a party of flavors.. I accidentally ended up at this restaurant and haven't stopped going ever since..They offer food that's mainly Persian style of cooking. You have simple ingredients with the most flavorful taste.I have tried most of the veggie menu options but always end up ordering vegetarian kabob with basmati Rice as the grilled veggies are a delight. Perfectly balanced meal.
2020-12-11,5,So good! The stuffed grape leaves are a can't miss! Beautiful restaurant and great food!
2020-11-08,4,Not an expert on Persian food but enjoyed my experience dining in on a Sunday. Came around 2:30 pm and the restaurant was not nearly as busy as the other brunch places in Hoboken where they either already stopped seating more people for the day or had a 40+ min wait. We were able to grab a seat indoor (outdoor seating available as well) right away which I appreciate on a busy Sunday in Hoboken. Food was great. We had the 1) Fried Egg Sandwich on Naan Barbari with beef and 2) Kale, Feta and Walnuts Salad on their brunch menu and both were delicious. They took their time prepping for the food which I didn't mind and honestly think is better than brunch places that bring your food out in 10 minutes. The food was much better prepped and you could tell it was made with care. Service was nice too. Only complaint with COVID safety measure is that I did notice the server spreading what looked like disinfectant spray on the menu but then just quickly wiped it with his hand. Someone from the kitchen also brought out glass that they must had just washed but was using his fingers to pinch the glass from the top where your lips would touch - not the cleanest way to handle things especially with what's going on.
2020-11-07,2,We ordered the vegetarian grill and got uncooked veggies with no seasoning or flavor. Very disappointed. I wouldn't order from here again or recommend for vegetarian food.
2020-10-27,5,Great lunch special. Delicious chicken Kabob. One of my go to spots on Hoboken. Great ambience and the people who work there are nice.
2020-10-11,5,Pandemic got me exploring way more spots in Hoboken because I am getting tired of cooking for myself and eating the same meal 5 days in a row. Hahaha! So glad I stumbled upon this super yummy Persian spot. Delivery came quickly and the food was hot. Ordered the combo plate and both meats (chicken and ground beef kabob) were super flavorful and moist! Rice is also buttery and yummy. Hummus was great too- tasted super freshly made. Can't wait to try more things!
2020-09-15,5,The food is delicious, order the barg kabob! The rice and bread are also always fresh and delicious. The stews are good to order too, Seven Valleys do a good job of making it taste similar to homemade Persian food which is always #1!! As a Persian, I approve of their food. Also, recently went to eat here last month and their outdoor seating was nicely spaced out (6 ft). I felt safe eating there during COVID times.
2020-09-07,4,Had dinner here over Labor Day weekend for the first time. Figured it wouldn't be too crowded but every table but one was taken when we Arrived around 7 pm and they had a steady flow of customers the rest of the night.  There seemed to be only two individuals handling all the tables but our server was very patient and accommodating (we just had to be patient ourselves.)  Since we both had never ate there before, he was very helpful explaining the menu and portion sizes. Right when you sit down, they bring out this complimentary purple yogurt dip with bread for the table. Very tasty. To start, we shared the eggplant dip which was very good.  For our mains, I got the Bakhtiari kabob platter and upgraded for the albaloo polo rice (extra charge). The platter comes with a chicken and beef kabob - I decided on the hanger steak (over the filet) since the waiter said it had more flavor.  The steak was delicious and cooked perfect. The chicken was also very flavorful. The rice was really good and had cherries in it. Loved everything.    My friend got the shrimp kabob dish and added a chicken kabob a la carte. The shrimp didn't have much flavor and would not recommend since the meat was better.  The shrimp platter comes with the baghali polo which was dill rice - we didn't care for it very much. Too much dill. My rice was better. Overall we had a very nice meal. The Restaurant is byo which is also a plus!  I worry what will happen when the weather gets cold since the inside is super tiny and at 25% capacity, they can't fit many.  I hope to come back soon and try their lunch box special they have during the week.
2020-09-05,5,Love this place, is my go to when hungry and don't want to cook. Their chicken breast is my fave, Aldo the Persian drink and the zafron cake. They have a special place in my heart
2020-08-30,5,Absolutely love this place!  Everything is always on point.  The hummus is amazing and you can't beat the lunch special.
2020-08-09,4,Ordered takeout from here once. The food here is really good. I ordered the kashke badmajan dip and chicken breast kabob entree. The dip was delicious. It tastes slightly similar to an Indian eggplant dish but not as spicy. The chicken kabobs were cooked perfectly and seasoned the right amount. I'm also a big fan of the rice that's served with the entrees. It's a very thin grain so it isn't as filling as most rice/carbs.
2020-08-09,4,Got takeout here during covid. I ordered the chicken kabob breast pieces with a side salad and basmati rice and it was delicious! It comes with a tomato and lime wedge. The chicken pieces were very tender and juicy. The side salad was simple with cucumbers but the flavors were tangy. Can't wait to dine in!
2020-07-29,4,I have been wanting to try this for a while now and finally had the chance go.  We sat outside in the outdoor seating they have. I liked what they are doing considering the difficult circumstances we are all in. First off, it is a byob which are becoming few and far between in Hoboken. If you forget a bottle of wine there is a liquor store with a decent selection down the block.  Now lets get to the food, the vegetarian kebab had all sorts of vegetables on there and they were cooked nicely. The eggplant was not mushy which is always a fear when cooking with it. The Hummus that is served with the veggie kebob is the game changer. We ordered a 2nd helping because it was so good!  I usually stay away from ordering hummus at places because it always tastes average to me but this one was a step above. The spiced meat kebab and beef kebab were both solid. We had a couple chewy pieces of beef but thats normal since there was fat on there. Shirazi salad is good and refreshing. It is a perfect compliment to the fatty meat.  They also have a bunch of different stews if you like those. It was hot outside so I wasn't in the mood for a stew but if you are they look authentic.  I think some of them are spicy so make sure you get a toilet paper in the freezer just in case.Come check this place out. It is a blend of persian/mediterean food and it was all pretty good.  The staff were very kind as well and did all they can to make the experience fun.  Good job Seven Valleys!
2020-07-23,5,Stopped by for lunch and it was delightful! Staff was so kind and attentive. Had the lunch chicken kebab special and the Persian lemonade. The chicken wasn't dry at all and everything had great flavor. And the aesthetics of the restaurant and presentation of food was so cute! I cant wait to come back for dinner!
2020-07-22,5,Always love Seven Valleys. Aside from the outstanding food, the service is top notch. The Manager Tomoko treats you like family and it us just such a special gem in Hoboken. The different rices, the homeade hummus, beet yogurt dip with bread, all so yummy. Kebabs so flavorful. Highly recommend you visit. Will never dissapoint.
2020-07-22,4,I have never had Persian food before and this was a great first experience. I highly reccomend starting with the eggplant appetizer, it was lighter than hummus and so delicious. Upon sitting down, the waitress will bring you complimentary yogurt dip and fresh bread- if you are like me you will be full off of just that. I went for the salad with shrimp, however my friend got the veggie kabobs and said the rice was do die for. The colors that are in the food was amazing. The salad did not come with enough dressing, and the outdoor tables arent the best quality- have wide slots in them for design, so I dropped my fork and had to request a new one.
2020-07-21,4,Really enjoyed the dinner here last night. The Veggie kabob (a dish that risks being bland and overcooked) was scrumptious. Well seasoned and grilled perfectly. Since we didn't have apps, we had room for the rice pudding with saffron, cardamom and rose water, topped with crushed pistachios. What a delight for the taste buds!  Will definitely go back!
2020-07-21,5,WOW!! GREAT FOOD AND FLAVORS! We were blown away with the great flavors. In a town with many great place to eat this is one we will be on we return to over and over again and again. I plan to eat my way through their menu. Service was very good also.
2020-07-19,5,Being Persian myself, expectations are high anytime I have to compare food to my mother's cooking. I'll say that I'm completely satisfied with the quality of food here. I've been going since they first opened and I've some gentle tweets and additions to the menu that make this a special place. The food has an authentic flavor and the staff has always been courteous. I've dined inside/ outside and even had delivery from them. I recommend to always add something new each time to your typical order because you'll never know if you love something without trying it first. My brother and I love recommending here to our friends in the neighborhood.
2020-07-11,4,Admittedly: I'd never had Persian before ordering Seven Valleys for delivery on a Saturday night. And I'm very glad that I gave this Uptown Hoboken spot a go.The menu focuses on kebabs and stews, with pilaf dishes far from an after thought. I went with an order of fesenjan (a walnut and pomegranate stew with chicken), a side of sour cherry pilaf, and bread with a spicy beet yogurt.Delivery was on the slow side but the food was worth the wait: the bread was nicely chewy with the yogurt providing a pleasant zing. The rice was perfectly fluffed and faintly sweet owing to the cherries, while the fesenjan was bracingly tart with the chicken tender enough to cut with a spoon.This is worth a repeat order
2020-07-01,5,I've been wanting to try Seven Valleys for so long and am so glad I finally did! I got the chicken kabob lunch special to-go and it was delicious. Can't wait to come back for a sit-down dinner.
2020-06-25,5,We've now eaten in on two occasions and ordered twice. The food is hands down awesome. Today we ordered pickup. I got home and realized we didn't have our full order. After a quick phone call and bike ride back to the restaurant they gave me my missing items (fresh!) along with an order of baklava. Totally unexpected! I'm not a huge fan of baklava, but it was so good!Every time we've had food here we have stuck to the same things -- lamb shank, medley for two, hummus. Nothing disappoints. The medley is the perfect amount of food. Today we added a shrimp kabob. Wow! So good. Even my 11 and 13 yr old kids love it!And when we can dine-in again (well outdoor seating is now avail) it's a BYO too. Bonus. Thanks for providing a wonderful alternative to the Hoboken dining scene.
2020-06-20,5,Had an early dinner here and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The chicken kebab and salad were delicious... will definitely return. The service was good as well.
2020-05-12,5,My go to during quarantine!! Chicken soltani kebab, lunch specials are amazing. Chicken is super juicy and not dry at all! Has a nice tangy flavour to it that goes so well with buttery rice. Lemonade and Persian drink with chia seeds is awesome too. Refreshing and hint of sweetness/roseDefinitely check it out!
2020-03-06,4,Cozy and cute decor.  Love that Hoboken has a true Persian restaurant. Very good service. The flavors were spot on! I am living for the Tahdig with the Sabzi stew. We also had the hummus which was typical. For our main we had chicken and beef kabobs and cherry rice. So flavorful and delicious. The reason I did not give Seven Valley 5 stars is because the Baklava was dry and I love a soaked in honey " wet" version of the dessert. Also the prices. The portions are small for the price.
2020-02-26,3,So thrilled to find a persian restaurant in the area. Though the restaurant is located on the ever-bustling Washington street,  it's easy to miss it owing to its location right behind a bus stop. Some more advertising should really help. Ordered the chicken fesenjan and koobideh.The kababs were mediocre. And though the chicken in the fesenjan was tenderly cooked and delicious, the stew itself was more on the tart side than usually expected. Persian food is known for its subtle yet impactful flavor. So let's assume that the flavor of the stew is modified  in order to accommodate broader taste ranges. Staff is courteous, decor is charming. Highly recommend the sholeh zard.
2020-02-24,5,We are completely obsessed with Seven Valleys. From the crispy rice and hummus apps and ALL the kabobs and seasoned rice, we gobbled everything up. Bonus points for being BYOB! Highly recommend the beef tenderloin, chicken breast, shrimp and salmon kabobs. We have yet to have the stews or the lamb shanks because every time we go, we're craving the kabobs but I was eyeing the table next to ours and the smells were heavenly. I'll need to get back before the weather turns warm.
2020-02-15,5,Omg SO GOOD. it's a very cute small place with a very well priced menu. Went for valentines dinner and they had flowers and candles. Very romantic. The yogurt dip and bread was amazing. I had the filet beef, shrimp, and chicken. All were delicious. I loved the tomato cucumber salad. Food was not greasy at all, so after you don't have that "I feel like cr*p" feeling after eating out. Had the love cake and rose water ice cream for dessert. It was very different, but still amazing. Only downside is that the tables were so close together so it was uncomfortable to get up to use the bathroom. But the food and service was so good didn't even mind!
2020-02-12,5,excellent all around.  the chicken kebob is the best I have ever tasted - juicy and tender, very well marinated and char grilled. absolutely will go back again !
2020-01-28,5,We were looking for restaurants Sunday morning on a whim and found that this one didn't have a wait. There wasnt much of a rush so they got us seated relatively quickly. The waiter was alarmingly tall but very polite and ready to help. We heard the beet yogurt was fantastic and when we asked for it he made sure to accommodate us. Will definitely come again
2020-01-28,2,Seven Valleys? More like 7 hours. We were there with 4 guests and 4 stews took about an hour - not to mention they served us 3 and took another 20 minutes to bring the 4th. During our wait, many guests that arrived got their food before us and also left before us. Not one word from the wait staff. Horrible service and a long wait for mediocre food. Won't be back Jack.
2020-01-20,4,Nice little surprise on a Monday night   Wanted something different and we all enjoyed our meals.   The shrimp kabob was delicious and 2 stews.  Tiny,  but we fortunately got seated right away.
2020-01-18,4,I ducked in here as a spur of the moment visit and I just had the chicken kebab and the cherry rice dish. It was fantastic, seriously the chicken was probably the best tasting chicken that I have ever had. It was freaky perfect, moist and well seasoned with what I don't know but it was great. The decor and ambiance are lovely too.
2020-01-16,1,I'm glad Hobokens diversity of restaurants is improving. But the quantity provided for the price is unreasonable, especially for the mundane quality and ingredients. I hope they make improvements.
2020-01-10,1,As a Persian,I was very ready to make this place my favorite and visit it every month,but oh my God !! I went there with one of my friends,the server was rude &she had an attitude like she was controlling us When the main meal was ready she picked the appetizer away without asking us if it was finished(we were still eating) ,she put out forks on the table like who does that?! So about the food .... I am Persian and I can tell if the food is good or notLemme be clear,the food is lower much lower than average,it seems like it's old and it's oily and tasteless
2020-01-01,4,We visited this place on Christmas eve. The food was amazing but we found the potion size to be small.We ordered the belowAppetizer Masto Khiar and hummus served along with breadDessert SholezardPersian icecreamThe desserts were absolutely delicious Main courseGhormeh Sabzi Stew with MushroomsKabob platterThe platter had beef and chicken kabobs. Both the kabobs were juicy and cooked to perfection.Must place to visit if you like Persian food
2019-12-30,5,Food is good. However I'm giving them 3 stars because of the packaging. I've tried this restaurant only for delivery. I have requested no napkins and no plastic cutlery and they insist on sending them; the last time they even packed more than for the 3 dishes I ordered. I am aware that if I ask for take out or delivery, I will end up with some plastics, it's obvious to me and I'm trying to avoid it as much as I can, but sometimes you're too tired and want to order food. But the amount of plastics they give you, they're not even trying. So I will not order any more from this place and if I do want to eat from them I will go there. I've tried other Persian restaurants in Manhattan. Seven Valleys is good but not the ultimate Persian. It's a pity that restaurants in general are not taking care of the environment as they s.I've updated my review due to great flavor and better service than before. It's a delicious meal every time
2019-12-02,5,Seven Valleys is an excellent addition to the restaurant choices in Uptown Hoboken. I've been there at least five times over the past year and have never had a bad meal! Their dishes are perfect for sharing. Even though are about 20 seats, I've eaten there with groups of 4 and 5 and never had to wait. Though, we probably arrived at the right time.
2019-11-22,3,Decent Persian food but way overpriced for the size, service, and quality. Ambiance: only done delivery which has been 10-15 minutes later then expected. The order: Tadik with stew (always tiny portions), Persian ice cream (really small portion), Shirazi Salad, Chicken Breast Kebob, SoltaniThe taste: Better then average but not amazing. The tadik was dried out, the ice cream is good, Shirazi has way too much vinegar, and the chicken was good but didn't come with sauce or sumac. Service: Very late and the food was cold. Overall: Very overpriced for the size portions. It looked like someone ate half of the portion and put it back. Would not recommend ordering delivery based on my experiences. Food is good but much better out there.
2019-11-18,5,My wife and I came to town for a concert. We really had craving for persian food and this little jem was close to our hotel. What a surprise. Beautiful place, very good food, and great service. The fesenjoon was the best I've had (I'm half persian so I grew up on persian food). We really felt like we were eating at a family members home with the impeccable service and kindness of the staff. Thanks for a memorable dinner!
2019-11-14,5,Fantastic food. First time I ordered take out from here. Food came fresh and hot. I went with the beef stew w yellow peas. Beautiful food. Beef was very tender and their basmati rice was very flavorful. This place knows food. Stupid Americans only know hamburgers and hot dogs.
2019-11-08,5,Wow, I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was here! Not that I had low expectations, but because mailing Persian food down is not easy and this place nailed it. Our waitress was great and sweet! It's a small place so come prepared to wait a bit. Wednesday night was packed and weekends are too. The kabob medley is fantastic, the Persian ice cream and cake was so good. We also had tahdig and gormeh sabzi. All great! I'm going back again next week with family. Khalee mamnoon, aali bood!
2019-11-02,5,We went to this place rather randomly - couldn't find a place that could sit 5 adults and one kid without reservation and saw someone walking out from this place who said - "this place is amazing". So we just decided to give it a shot. Fast forward hour and a half - great food (especially meat) and service! Note: they are byob but there's a wine store 30 seconds away.
2019-10-26,5,They serve actual Persian food, with high quality and fresh material. We tried kashkebademjan, tahdig, and bakhtiari. They were better than all Persian restaurants I had tried in NY/NJ area.
2019-10-08,4,I highly recommend this restaurant, you'll love it.  My friends took me here for my birthday and I could not be happier.  I ordered salmon with saffron rice and O-M-G it was so delicious!  I devoured that dish in less than 5min.  Also, if you're into grape leaves, you must try theirs too!  The place is located in Hoboken, it's a small and very cozy place.  The atmosphere I really nice and I love the decor, makes you feel at home.  There's this one big table by the window which you will get to share with other people if you're ok, I'm ok with that, it was 5 of us sharing the table with a couple, wasn't weird at all lol.  We were all focused on the food and how good it was.  Definitely you should try it if you like Persian Food, you won't regret it.
2019-10-06,5,Have been here multiple times so far - great food options Always start with the crispy rice with stew followed by the kebab entreeCheck out the desserts as well and the tea and sharbat are amazingHot sauce if you ask for it is freshly made and amazing We come back at least once every few weeks!
2019-10-04,5,Did pickup and was delicious, definitely going to return. Ordered grape leaves, two different kabobs, and the hummus was some of the best I've had.
2019-09-12,4,4*s for food...3* max for serviceOn my second, and most recent, visit to Seven Valleys, I was completely appalled by their service - not in the sense that they weren't friendly, but rather due to their slowiness and ineptitude.  My friend and I had both enjoyed the food there in the past and thought it would be a good spot for a late dinner.  When we arrived, the staff let us know that the kitchen would be closing in about 35 minutes, but that they could still accommodate us.  We were thrilled and promptly greeted by an over-eager man jumping at the chance to take our order.  My friend was not starving, so she asked if she could add chicken to one of the salads.  The server told her that they were unable to do that, as the salad portion was simply too small for that.  Discouraged, she decided to select 2 appetizers, rather than 1 complete entree.  I, on the other hand, was as hungry as usual, so I asked for my dual Kabob platter to include one chicken and one vegetable skewer.  I also selected a salad over rice for my included side dish.  The waiter recorded our requests and went off to assist other tables.  He stopped back a few moments later, asking if we wanted all of the food to arrive at the same time.  We confirmed that we did, as the appetizers were acting as my companion's main course.  Well, after about 40 minutes, which was now way past the time when the kitchen was supposed to be closing, my friend's two dishes arrived.  I gave her my blessing to start eating without me, but after another 10 minutes, I still had not received my meal.  I asked another server if my food was on its way, and she confirmed that it was.  Meanwhile, I snacked on a few forkfuls from my friend's plate.  Another 10 minutes went by, taking the total waiting time to a hour.  I again asked about the status of my food and mentioned that my friend was almost done with her meal.  I clarified that those small plates were her dinner; we were not sharing them.  The server seemed shocked and quickly dashed off to get my entree.At that point, my food arrived almost instantaneously and was absolutely delicious.  The Marinated Chicken Kabob was well-seasoned and tender.  The Vegetarian Kabob included chargrilled eggplant, green peppers, mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes, all similarly herbed and perfectly cooked.  My side Shirazi was a fresh blend of chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onion in a house dressing of olive oil, lime juice, and parsley.What really disappointed us was that the food at Seven Valleys was so spectacular, but no meal was worth that amount of confusion and frustration.
2019-09-01,4,The restaurant is very small, thankfully my order was to go. The food was good. I ordered kofta kebab, which comes with 2 skewers, but they were small and thin. When I opened my order I thought they left one out but it was actually hidden underneath that's how small it was. I don't think it's worth $17 that's for sure. Rice, meat & tomato in a take out container, it's not even packed, just not worth $17 to me. It's not enough to share that meal will satisfy 1. I know Hoboken is known to be pricey but I would expect more for that price. Hope something gives because I would like to come back...
2019-08-11,5,Delicious foods! Fensenjoon and gheymeh with tah dig are my favorites! Very cozy with a nice and comfortable decoration and lovely plants.Friendly people and high quality foods. It's my first persian place to go in NJ :)
2019-08-11,4,Highly recommend this restaurant!  First of all the atmosphere is cute and cozy. I love the decor and all the plants.Second, the food is fantastic. First, they serve you some warm bread and a yogurt dip. The bread here is amazing! So soft and warm. The appetizers were great too. We ordered Kashke Bademjan, which is an eggplant dip, which was tasty. We also got the Tahdig which was good, but I didn't expect the lentils to be a bit bland. I thought the dish lacked flavor, but maybe that's how it's made?I especially love the pulao - we had the veggie kebab which was really good. I highly recommend trying the pulao. The Albaloo polo was so good - sweet cherry flavored rice. I also liked Baghali polo, very soft and fragrant.Finally, the service was so nice. They seated us at the huge 8 person table since it was the only one open and they packed up our food so nicely for us. Highly recommend!
2019-08-05,4,My husband and I went here for dinner within the first few months (definitely the first year) of them opening up in town.  It was a welcomed addition to uptown-what a nice change of pace from all of the Italian restaurants! The ambience is so cute-simple, clean, touches of culture in the Knick knacks on the front right wall, and a bit of greenery to help lighten the space.  It's not large-it probably at max capacity seats 20 maybe a few more in the whole restaurant, so if you're coming with a group, I'd go early (or maybe call?).  We started with a few of the dips/mezzes, and had the kabobs for dinner with a side of cherry rice (per the waiters suggestion).  I forget what we had to drink, but it was some sort of traditional tea or drink that we loved... and the food was all amazing.  So flavorful, HUGE portions (you could likely share an entree with someone unless you're really hungry).Such a nice addition to the neighborhood-looking forward to going back!
2019-07-28,5,Authentic Persian food; freshly prepared. Excellent hospitality and service Gift to Hoboken!
2019-07-10,5,Love this restaurant.  Service was terrific. From the bread and yogurt appetizer to the last bite everything was delicious. I ordered the Koobedeh and and bit the $3+ up charge to up-grade my rice to the  Zereshk Polo rice with barberries,currents and saffron. It was a well spent $3 the rice was the best I've had. My wife ordered the chicken breast skewers. The chicken was well seasoned, full of flavor and very tender. Her saffron rice was cooked to perfection.  Going to be coming back for sure!
2019-07-06,5,Great service and amazing food!  Loved the chicken.  I don't know how they make the marinade but it is delicious.  I had a great and healthy meal.  Will come back!
2019-06-19,4,The food here is amazing.  Get every rice dish they have and the chicken kebabs are to die for... the issue I have is the portion sizes.  The price is high given the small portions... Easily 5 stars if they increase portions.
2019-06-18,5,Unbelievable! One of my favorite new restaurants in Hoboken and so nice to have a new offering besides brick over pizza, Italian and more pizza in the uptown corridor.The food is delicious, flavorful and seemingly decadent while still being good for you. The vegetarian kabob is my go-to dish with the most perfectly cooked and seasoned vegetables you will ever encounter. Baghali polo is always cooked to perfection with dill and fava beans and so tasty and I'd also recommend the dolmeh (stuffed grape leaves) and hummus which are top notch. My husband is a huge fan of the chicken breast kabob (and he's a tough one to please). Everything is a winner!Highly recommend!
2019-06-18,3,Probably the most unique middle Easter place we've eaten in a while based on menu.  However, the food was just OK.  We started with an eggplant appetizer and hummus.  The hummus was good, eggplant was lacking flavor.  We also ordered beef and chicken Kebobs.  The rice was interesting - saffron with cherries and was very sweet, which was a bit of a surprise.  Also there was an up fee for this rice which was not communicated by the server.  Meat was good, but I've had better beef kebab elsewhere.  The worst part was the cucumber tomato salad which came in a tiny cup.  The cucumber used was super soggy and the flavoring was off. Not sure how you screw up a salad, but it happened.
2019-06-16,5,Just amazing! Had the Veggie Gormeh Sabzi, tasted almost just like my mamani's! The baklava is no joke as well, it was wonderful.
2019-06-10,4,Very cute place. Loved the design of it. Only concern was that there weren't many entree options. Other than that, I would def recommend if you want to go to a BYOB.
2019-06-02,5,I've had dinner here and we were blown away by quality of the kebab that we came back to order catering for a family party. The eggplant appetizer was delicious and the beef, koobideh and chicken kebabs were tender and flavorful. Lamb shank and rice were also delicious. Beet-flavored yogurt with fresh baked bread was a really nice way to start the meal. The owner and staff were courteous and went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed the experience. We are thrilled to finally have a Persian restaurant in Hoboken and highly recommend.The food was so delicious that my parents even compared it to the kebabs they had decades ago in Kabul.This is a great restaurant and we hope it sticks around for years to come!
2019-05-14,5,Great food and atmosphere for eat in. We've picked up and ordered delivery, and it was really well done!
2019-05-12,5,Everything about this place is amazing. The atmosphere is fabulous and the food is all so delicious. I've dined in and had takeout, both were great. Can't recommend enough to try this place!
2019-05-05,5,We had a delicious dinner here, and I will definitely return. The vegetarian options were excellent-- fessenjan with tofu was amazing, especially with the sour cherry rice. Everyone who worked there was gracious and welcoming, and told us all about what we were eating. And beautiful decor, too!
2019-05-04,4,Highly recommend! We did the kabob medley for two and it was fabulous. It's a great way to try a few of their kabobs. The seasoning was perfect and each cut of meat was excellently cooked- tender! It's a cozy setting but even surrounded by others we had no problem hearing or conversing. Service was great- we never had to ask for water or for wine refills. It's BYOB, and they kept our white chilled. We saw Seven Valleys featured in the NJ monthly magazine and we wanted to try something new. It did not disappoint!
2019-03-30,1,Had a guest from out of the country and suggested this restaurant. We went there at 7:30 and put our name there. The hostess said she would give us a call. However, I did not get any calls so went back and asked again around 8 pm. The hostess showed me a table and said that the table will be ours when people sitting there leave in 15 minutes. When people on the table left she sat another group there. It was cold outside so we went back to the car and waited till 9 pm. No calls after all and we left ... That was my Saturday night ...
2019-03-27,5,This place is amazing. I love Persian cuisine and have had a ton of it. I have to say this is the real deal. The food was delicious. All the stews were great, the kabobs were super tender and flavorful, the desserts were fabulous. The owner is nice as can be. I can't wait to come back. It was really THAT good.
2019-03-24,5,Had a great meal tonight. We had a party of 6 , 3 had kebobs, 3 had different entrees, all 6 of us were happy campers. We had Dolmeh and Ashe for appetizers , both were tasty, I ordered Shirin Polo, which is a dish typically served at celebrations, it is really tedious to prepare and often shortcuts are taken which compromise the dish, not here. It was a symphony of flavor, every component was carefully prepped and in the perfect proportion so the dish just sings. The kebabs were flavorful and tender, we had chicken, ground beef and the hanger steak all were flavorful And juicy. Desert was another great experience. Saffron and rosewater ice cream, Persian rice pudding, and a cake I was not familiar with but very good. I stopped going out for Persian food ( except kebobs) as it is always a disappointment, Seven Valleys changed that,   We are 90 mins away but we will be back soon. Go you won't be disappointed
2019-02-22,5,I ordered delivery from here and ordered a few items - Everything was delivered promptly and with food still piping hot! I have quite a few Iranian friends ranging different generations and have had home cooked food - all of the dishes here was fresh and resembled home cooked food I have had. I loved all the rice dishes! The Tahdig was not as crunchy as I would've liked but that may have been due to it being delivered. I tried the gormeh sabze and steak/koobideh kabob both excellent! Will def dine in!!
2019-02-20,2,Pro: good service and pleasant staff. Very attentive Con: 1-the food as others put the pictures up, has no color, the persian food are known for color, spice and taste. Most dishes here had shortcoming on all. 2- kabob particular served like grandma house rather than restuarant 3- this place fits the non Iranians or at best second generation of Iranians who in some sense wouldn't differentiate between authentic vs. non authentic.4- a bit expensive sideI won't go back.
2019-02-19,5,I can't say enough good things about this place. Service from our waiter Johnny was amazing, since it was our first time he gave us some great recommendations. We got a veggie kabob (which was amazing, even though it's just roasted veggies) shrimp kabob and the meat/chicken kabob. We also had the grape leaves and eggplant apps. The rose ice cream was very unique and such a treat! Very exciting to have a different type of cuisine in Hoboken. Also loved the cute trendy decor. We couldn't stop raving the whole time. The menu is small and can read as simple, but don't be fooled, everything is done so well and the flavors are great. Also note, they don't take a reservation but you can put your name in and they'll call you when a table is ready. It's very small in there, so it fills up quite fast. I never yelp, but since so many places close so fast in Hoboken I want this place to do well so I can keep going!
2019-02-16,5,I stopped here on a random day and decided to give this cozy small and relatively new restaurant a try and I'm glad I did that. I've ordered the chicken breast kabob with a side of basmati rice and it was so yummy. The smell, the presentation were perfect as well. The chicken was juicy and so tasty. It opens up around 5 pm but I'll dine in next time.
2019-02-15,5,Amazing food! Very authentic and full of flavour! Best Persian food I have had in a long time! very friendly staff, gave great recommendations! Cute date vibe, small place but cozy!
2019-02-14,4,Tried to go to seven valleys when it first opened, it was packed (it's a small space, but good for them) and they werent (still don't ?) take reservations.So I returned a couple months later and very much enjoyed my meal. It was very good, pretty traditional Persian food. Persian food is very under represented in North Jersey, specifically Hoboken and Jersey City. I feel comfortable saying that having lived in both. It was a little pricey for the size of the portions, at least compared to other Persian restaurants I've been to, like Ravagh in nyc. I can't say anything else negative about it. Every dish was delicious, in particular the lamb shank. The meat so easily pulling off the bone and the broth was delicious and great to poor over the rice.
2019-02-11,5,We went here on a Saturday night. The place was packed, they're probably about 10 tables or so in the dining room. They do not take reservations so we went and put our name on the list and then stepped out for a cup of coffee at Bwe. They called us when our table is ready we walked a few storefronts down back to the restaurant. The waitress came over and took orders. The food was absolutely to die for the rice, the chicken, in the meat everything was cooked wonderfully. Appetizers, entreÃÅes, And dessert we're all done perfectly. You can see there is a tension to detail on the quality of the food. The kebab a beef was season so wonderfully. The chicken was moist and flavorful, the steak it was so tender and juicy every little bit of it was eaten. Honestly, if this was closer to home I would you take out from here often. If you're in the mood for something different outside of the normal Friday night dinners stop here grab some takeout and try it out I guarantee you it will not disappoint. I highly recommend giving this place a shot next time you're in Hoboken.
2019-02-09,4,Let me start off by saying it was worth the 35min wait Saturday night at 5:45pm for a table for 2. It was packed- I wish they had more than 7/8 tables, since it's very small space but food was delicious. They give you complimentary bread and this beet yogurt dip- great to start and very refreshing. I then tried the vegetable kabob and my friend ordered the salmon- he loved the fish but not the rice. The vegetables were delicious and the dish came with a side of hummus and either salad or rice- I chose the salad. (Cucumbers, tomato's, onions) I asked if they could do a kabob 1/2 chicken and 1/2 vegetables but they could not accommodate. That would have been perfect! We then ordered 2 desserts the Lazeez love cake (with saffron ice cream) and the Sholezard - pursian rice pudding. Both were delicious and unique- the Lazeez is paleo/gf which was delicious. Both had a rose flavor, so if you like that I would recommend! I would return to try the lamb and maybe go a bit earlier so I didn't have to wait. Otherwise solid 4/5!
2019-02-09,5,New option in town that you should check out. Small restaurant no reservations w delicious food, byob, authentic. Good service, we met the sisters who developed the restaurant experience. They mentioned they plan to open for lunch but for now just dinner. Kebabs were amazing and my friends had stew w beef and pomegranates. Can't wait to return.
2019-02-09,4,I thought the food and service was absolutely fantastic. This delicious, bring your own, Persian restaurant is a bright spot in uptown Hoboken. The ONLY downside which is why I gave it 4 stars is that there is VERY FEW seats. It's extremely cramped in the tiny space they have and so you're basically sitting on top of the neighboring table. It's almost impossible to get a table on a weekend because there's only like 5 in the whole place. BUT totally worth it if you can get in. The food is absolutely yummy!
2019-02-07,5,They do not take reservations so it's first come first serve. We had a short wait but it's a Friday night and the space is small. They have a great vibe and delicious Persian food. We ordered a couple of the stews which were amazing and the specialty rices were cooked to perfection! I'm especially happy with the vegetarian options! Yummy!! Beautiful deÃÅcor too! Perfect date night!
2019-01-26,5,Beautiful warm atmosphere. Delicious fesanjoon (pomegranate and walnut dish). I loooooved the love cake dessert. I will definitely be back !!
2019-01-26,1,Went there on a date last night. Tables where extremely close together so we could barely hear each other. Basically the whole restaurant was yelling because it's such a small space. First we got bread and a really good pink dip. The bread was amazing. Our favorite part of the meal was the bread. Then we got the grape leaf appetizer. It was completely flavorless. We both got the stew with button mushrooms. The meal was basically just beans mushrooms and rice. The whole thing had no flavor. It was so bland I couldn't eat it anymore. For an all vegetarian meal we paid 50 dollars for two people to get beans rice and mushrooms that had no flavor. We were really disappointed in thus place. I was hoping it would be good but no success.
2019-01-18,1,Had a very bad experience at this restaurant. Called and made a booking for 6 people. When we arrived the waiter and the manager told me they don't take bookings. Basically had given our table to someone else cause they wanted to make money. Expected us to wait outside in the cold for 20 minutes. They should decide on their reservation policy, either take reservations or don't. Pretty simple! Will not be going back.
2019-01-15,1,Went there this past Saturday and the food was Absolutely terrible. I was missing Persian food so bad that I ordered 6-7 dishes to try everything I can and even take left-overs home, but I was extremely disappointed!Great people. But terrible food. The ghorme sabzi felt like it was straight out of a can, tasteless, cold and over beaned. Tahdig instead of crispy it was completely soggy rice. Gheyme was tasted like it was canned left-overs from 2 weeks ago. Got the soltani kabob, the steak portion which normall is filet mignon at every other Persian restaurant, was hanger steak here (and it was at the same price as everywhere else). So it was very chewey and not the same at all. The koobideh tasted looked like it was an after thought. Very disappointed especially since I brought my Non-Persian girlfriend to show her how good Persian food is!
2019-01-13,5,Excellent food - nice owners and great restaurant name. Highly recommend going if you are in the NY/NJ area
2019-01-13,1,My boyfriend is Persian and he and I were so excited to go to this 4.5 star rated restaurant in Hoboken. Sadly we were very disappointed in the food quality. It was mediocre at best. The salmon was extremely fishy tasting and obviously not fresh. The rice that came with it was flavorless. The Soltani Kebab had no filet. The meat was tough and gamey. We asked where the filet was and the waiter told us it was all hanger steak.The Ghormeh Sabzi (with mushrooms) came out barely luke warm. We asked them to please heat it up and 10 minutes later it came out slightly more luke warm. The stews were all overbeaned. The mushrooms had that slimey canned texture (don't think they were fresh either). It tasted like they poured canned beans and mushrooms into a pot and added salt. The tahdig (although browned) did not have a crunch to it and was mostly soggy. The only thing we enjoyed was the eggplant appetizer. Their prices are quite high for the food quality. We would gladly pay over $20 per dish for outstanding food, but this food was 2.5 star quality and the prices should be adjusted accordingly. Sadly, this is one of the only Persian places around. Too bad because we had high hopes for this place.
2019-01-07,5,I found this lovely Persian restaurant recently and can't wait to return! Beautiful, intimate setting and although I only sampled a few appetizers, I was immediately sold on the quality of the food and the ingredients.The hummus and the kashke bademjan are extraordinary!Get there early since seating is limited. You won't be disappointed!
2018-12-27,5,My first experience of Persian food, and I really enjoyed it. I'm vegetarian and gluten free, so restaurant eating can be tricky--but this was a breeze.  The veggie kabob was delicious; we also tried two of the specialty rices. Highly recommended.
2018-12-22,4,First time trying Persian food. The staff was very friendly and the food was very good. Generous portions. Only thing I'd advise against is eating the "edible flowers"...not for everyone I guess.
2018-12-22,5,I'm Persian and grew up with Persian food and enjoyed my dinner while repeatedly saying that it tasted like home. My favorite part was that the different khoreschts (stews) could be modified for vegetarians. While my family has always modified the stews for me at home (I'm a vegetarian), I've never experienced this at a Persian restaurant.With so few Persian restaurants in the NYC area, I'm very grateful for Seven Valleys. Persian culture and cuisine deserves to be shared with the world and how lucky people are if this restaurant is their first taste of it.
2018-12-20,4,Quaint and cozy - perfect when you're in the mood for middle eastern food. We ordered the kabob medley for two and it was more than enough. It came with 4 kabobs, rice and salad. The meats were good but wish it had a little more flavor. I was hoping for that chargrilled, packed with spices taste. The salad was delicious - my boyfriend liked it and he hates salads. Service was great and loved the decor! It's a bit small so I don't recommend coming with a large group. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes.
2018-12-18,4,Very good food. Fair service. Fair price. Very small restaurant. This place is new and I gave it a try recently. The food itself was very good so that's the most important part. Only negative is that the restaurant is very small and most likely will require you to wait for walk ins. So just call ahead, not sure if they do take reservations however. Definitely worth a try!
2018-12-16,4,Great local Persian estaurant with some innovative ways in persian food. The Koobideh was not the best Koobideh I have had but still tasty. Basmati rice is delicious with a great portion. Chicken is tender as it should be. I hope they will add chicken with bones too. Food was served on time and they provide some items that might not be available on the menu. Seating area is small but they can improve with small adjustment. Room was too bright for me.
2018-12-13,5,Delicious! The place is warm and welcoming, staff is attentive and knowledgeable and the dishes are delicious. I went on a date and we split the combo beef and chicken kebab and the shrimp kebab. Green rice is different and yummy. We each got the Israeli like salad - we could have split one. I want to try more!! Will definitely be back.
2018-12-07,4,So glad Hoboken has a Persian restaurant! I don't need to go to Manhattan anymore  we tried the tahdig with gheimeh appetizer and it was amazing. We also got fesenjoon and koobideh. Both dishes we really good. The meat was nice and tasty. The fesenjoon was just like my dads cooking so it was nostalgic for me. Really loved the drinks - lemonades and a tapioca sharbat. The love cake was good too. Pretty restaurant. Nice and friendly staff. I'll be back
2018-12-05,5,Had dinner at Seven valleys last night and everything was delicious. Ordered the tahdig with fesenjan to start, the veggie kebab, and the veggie ghormeh sabzi. All were really good but the ghormeh was the standout. Amazing! We finished off the dinner with their baklava and rose petal ice cream. Literally would come back  just for this ice cream every day. Highly recommend if you're in the mood for food that tastes like amazing home cooking without any of the clean up.
2018-12-01,5,This place is easy to miss, in fact I walked by it while they were working on opening it and completely missed it as I mistook it for a nail salon (which it could have been previously). It is also located in an area that, aside from a few actual restaurants, is mostly filled with casual dining establishments. It wasn't until a Yelp search, looking for new businesses in the area, led me to something that seemed very promising.The restaurant's ambiance is bright, earthy and welcoming; resembling an apartment it is filled with greenery, wooden tables and charming decorations which allude to its Persian roots. It is also astoundingly small, with a little over 20 seats it will most likely feel cramped regardless of whether you are sitting by the counter, at the tables meant for two or at the larger table that overlooks the street. The first time we arrived here, there was a bit of a wait but we were willing to wait for some time and as the couple in line before us gave up we were seated with in 15 mins. We started with the Kashke Bademjan  (sauteed eggplant prepared with a special blend of herbs & spices topped with sauteed onions & homemade yogurt). It came pretty quickly, accompanied by bread, and was absolutely delicious. I find eggplant dishes to often be lacking in flavor but this really wasn't the case here. For a main dish I got the Fesenjan with Tofu (ground walnuts with beef or tofu cooked in pomegranate paste, served with basmati rice) and I can't compliment this dish enough. The flavor of the stew was like nothing I've ever had before and I kept thinking about it for days after. The husband got the beef kabob (one skewer of beef, lightly marinated, char grilled) also with basmati rice and was raving about it. He also ordered a yogurt drink (mint flavored, non carbonated) and we both agreed it was delicious. As they were only open for two weeks when we first stopped by, I was expecting less than stellar service and some potential mishaps. Although they were definitely running around a lot, and we did not get the beet based dish that they brought to each table ( accompanied with bread, which we did get), I felt like it was pretty good. Our food came pretty quickly and everyone working there seemed to be doing their best and truly care about this place. Our more recent visit was on a Friday but about an hour before they closed so we were lucky to get a table right away. This time we received the beet based appetizer, which I found to be absolutely delicious especially with the bread they provide with it. We ordered the Masto Khiar as an appetizer (homemade yogurt with cucumber & dried mint) and it was refreshing and flavorful, definitely recommended. This time I went with the vegetarian kabob (one skewer charrboiled eggplant, green peppers, mushrooms, onions & tomato, served with hummus) and basmati rice. I found the vegetables to be fresh and grilled just the right amount but found the dish to be somewhat dry otherwise. I was telling my husband how it would be great with yogurt or hummus but I just now realize that it does come with hummus, yet they simply forgot to serve it! The husband ordered the Gheimeh stew (cubed beef, yellow peas & sun-dried lemons, simmered in a Persian tomato sauce) and said he liked it even more than the pomegranate stew. The food once again came out in a really timely manner and those serving on us were extremely nice, even though one of them was new and seemed to be completely unaware of the menu. This place is something Hoboken desperately needed so I have no doubt that we will be back here, but hopefully the service would reach its potential and they won't skimp on any more dips in the future.
2018-11-27,5,Staff was attentive, knowledgeable and so friendly! Their music selection created a perfect modern relaxed vibe, perfect for date night. Food was remarkable and flavorful. Highly recommend the special cherry rice and the eggplant appetizer! Price was very reasonable and it was BYOB with no corking fees. Thanks for the great time Seven Valleys!
2018-11-19,3,I must preface this review by saying that this was my first time eating Persian food. I came in on a weeknight right at 5 with my husband and toddler for dinner. Located in uptown Hoboken right on Washington street its easy to find and I was able to lock my stroller up outside. The restaurant is tight but seeing as we were the first customers, we were able to get a table with space to accommodate a high chair. The scenery and decor is very light, bright and modern. A casual ambiance but nice enough for date night. Our server was very friendly and I have to say my water glass was never empty. She did a great job of explaining the menu and portions. We decided to start with the mediterranean salad, followed by the medley for two so we could have a variety. The kabobs come with two sides, we got one specialty rice Baghali Polo and one plain basmati. While we waited for our salad our server brought over some bread with a sweet garlic yogurt dip. Interesting combo and nice to have something to munch on while we waited. The mediterranean salad is a large portion and definitely enough for two to share. Unfortunately, I found the dressing extremely acidic, combined with the salt of the olives it was a little much. I was glad I shared it with my husband because theres no way I could've finished it on my own. We both agreed on the acidity and I was glad the server was good about refilling our water. When our Kabobs came I was ready to dive in. The medley comes with a chicken, beef and a seasoned ground beef kabob. Now time to reference my preface. Previous to this experience, I'd never had Persian food so I'm not sure what flavor I'm looking for but my husband and I agreed that this food had none. The meats were cooked perfectly, my chicken was juicy and tender, the ground beef wasn't dried out and I made sure to use the lime that came with the dish but there was just such a lack of flavor. Our specialty rice at the end of the day was just rice. It was just dry LIGHTLY seasoned rice with kabobs topped with lime juice. We packed some our food to go but not because of the satisfying full feeling but because we were just tired of eating the dish. Checking yelp before I dined I really wanted to try the Lazeez Love Cake. This cake is GF, Paleo, contains edible rose petals, cardamom and comes with a side of saffron ice cream. If you're into a delicate rose flavor with an almond flour cake you NEED this dessert in your life. If this place opened for lunch during the week I would 100% stop in for a slice of that cake and a cup of coffee. I guess Persian food isn't my cup of tea but Persian baked goods are definitely up my alley. Based on my overall experience I don't think I'll be back for dinner but I will definitely be grabbing that cake to go.
2018-11-14,5,Delicious, delicious dinner! Came in on a Wednesday night around 7pm for a meal with my boyfriend. We live right around the corner from this place and have been wanting to try it. The restaurant is super tiny, best for couples or very small groups. The waiter was attentive and made recommendations on menu items. We ordered the eggplant appetizer and loved it. I had a chicken breast kabob for my main course and my boyfriend had a shrimp kabob. Both came with a huge pile of rice and a cucumber tomato salad. My only, minor complaint was that the chicken was a little dry (but I still ate every bite)Will absolutely be back and next time with a bottle of wine as they are BYOB!
2018-11-09,5,Must eat: all the specialty rices (but the one with the cherries was my favorite), all the apps (the sauteed eggplant was my favorite). Great addition to the neighborhood, which does not have a wide variety of food genres. The food was very tasty and flavorful. The apps and salads are smaller potions, but the size of the entrees was pretty large. Really really tiny yet pretty space, but expect to wait because there are not a lot of tables.  I think they will probably change the layout aftwr a few months of being open but as of now the tables are cramped and a little awkward.And its BYO!
2018-11-05,5,FINALLY! A real Persian restaurant in the 'hood! Walking in, oh, it smells like my childhood. Ordered all my favorites, including the tadig with sabze, koobideh and joojeh kabobs, and fesenjoon. Yes, it's a new restaurant, so there will be some growing pains, such as received wrong rice with one entree but wasn't end of the world. Everything was so tasty! The fesenjoon was a little more tangy than what I'm used to and the Joojeh (chicken) kabobs could have used a little more lemon, but, omg, the Ghormeh Sabze was perfection! As other reviews stated, the portions are much smaller than what you would find in a typical persian restaurant, but, again, I've been so desperate for an authentic persian restaurant, I'll take it! Service was very nice and polite and can't wait to see how bangin' this new place will be in a few months (and for delivery!)
2018-10-31,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. The cuisine is not traditional Mediterranean. The twist is just right. All dishes are both healthy and delicious! Their speciality rice is a must try!
2018-10-29,3,Was happy to have a Persian restaurant on this side of the Hudson. Went for dinner with two others. We had the beef, the koobideh and chicken kabobs. While the flavors of the meats were on par for what we've experienced at other Persian restaurants, the meat size portions were disappointing. For the same price range you get much larger meat portions at the NYC restaurants. The koobideh was extremely thin, the beef kabob was literally half the size of what I've had at other restaurants.  The rice also lacked flavor and the service was a bit chaotic as it seemed one person was handling all the tables. The tahdig (crunchy rice) appetizer was not crunchy at all, but the stew on top was delicious. There were large lags of time between the waitress checking on the table in between courses and a long wait for the check and for the payment to be processed. Really hoping these are just some initial grand opening pains that will get resolved soon. Really hoping to have a Persian restaurant we can count on in the neighborhood.
2018-10-24,5,Beautiful and intimate space serving delicious Persian food! I went on a Sunday night and it was a full house, waited about 15 minutes for a table for 2. The staff was very friendly and the service was pretty quick.We ordered the hummus, Mediterranean salad, chicken fesenjan (stew) with abaloo polo rice and sholezard (sweet rice pudding) - everything we had was really good. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Hoboken!
2018-10-23,5,Beautiful ambiance. Good home cooked Persian meal. And best of all ... Delicious baklava!!!Insider tip... get the tofu stew!! It's to die for !
2018-10-23,2,We were drawn in by the ambiance and had high hopes for this place, but were sad to see that it didn't live up to any of them. I ordered the lamb shank, which was literally just one very small "shank" (the size of a chicken leg) in a fairly flavorless broth. Half of the shank was inedible because it was fat. My husband ordered the Ghormeh Sabzi, which was advertised as a beef dish. It had perhaps 3 bite-size cubes of beef, so I suppose the description was technically correct, however for $20, this is a total ripoff. His dish was Both of our dishes came with giant mounds of rice, which I suppose was intended to be the most substantial part of the meal. We have nothing against small portions if they're incredibly tasty and well executed, but these were just incredibly disappointing. We left hungry and cooked at home. It looks like others have had better experiences, so maybe we just ordered the wrong things. Will give it at least 6 months to work the kinks out and perhaps try again.
2018-10-22,5,Fantastic addition to Hoboken! I'm from LA where there are some of the finest middle eastern restaurants, this is up there with the best! Very chill vibe, great for a date. If you're tired of the same pizza, pasta and sports bars, this is worth checking out.
2018-10-20,5,Ordered there for pick-up. Had two kebab platters and the hummus. Everything was fantastic. Order was ready in time and the people who worked there were super nice. Been waiting so long for a place like this to open near us - will definitely be a repeat customer.
2018-10-16,5,Perfection! I came in to the restaurant with high hopes tonight, being persian myself and somewhat of a kabob-connoisseur I didn't know what to expect, but WOW. Hands down the best kubideh and Chicken kabob I have ever had! Seriously... moist, juicy, seasoned well..everything you dream of when you crave Kabob. Persian restaurants in NYC can't compare. I'm looking forward to trying their stews on my next visit.. The menu has all of your Persian favorites, tadig, ghormeh sabzi, kashk-bademjoon. So excited to have an amazing Persian restaurant here in Hoboken. I no longer have to wait to go back to northern VA for good Persian food anymore, it's here! The ambiance was fresh and clean, warm and inviting, the service was excellent, this place will definitely be in our family rotation for a long time to come.
2018-10-15,5,So good . I shall return . This city needed a place like this . Shout out to the owners for bringing a vibe like this to the neighborhood .
