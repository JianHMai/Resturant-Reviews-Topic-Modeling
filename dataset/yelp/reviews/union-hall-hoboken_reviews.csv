2021-11-08,3,Went here for brunch on a bachelorette party and had a fun experience! They have mimosas and sangria in extra large mason jars!!I had a Bloody Mary and it was one of the best that I have ever had! For an appetizer, we had the kale Caesar and the disco fries - both were amazing!! Probably the highlight of the meal. As for entrees, I had the fried chicken BLT with fries and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately, we had two people in our group who's eggs came out extremely cold. Along with that, one of our group members didn't receive her meal at first - we had to flag down the server and she realized that the kitchen forgot to make it. Our server wasn't very attentive and got a little upset when we asked to split the check three ways. Outside of a few hiccups, I really enjoyed my meal and brunch experience!
2021-11-06,1,Do not come here for brunch. My eggs were undercooked and the salad had rotten pieces in it. Coffee was also 1/10. Avoid avoid avoid.
2021-10-27,5,Amazing view on the water. We got lucky and parked in the front on street but there is a garage around the corner. The views of the water overlooking Hudson are spectacular. It's kinda like brewery but casual upscale brewery. Low light. Music. Delicious good and hearty portions. Great for Date nightGirlfriends gathering Business /colleagues meeting
2021-10-17,3,Stopped in for drinks on Saturday afternoon. They have a good variety of beers on tap / bottles / cans, but I was disappointed with the slow service at the bar and the high-top table area near the bar. We moved to a table outside to grab some small bites, and service was much better out there.
2021-08-15,3,We were a party of 8, we didnt have to wait long for sitting. There is outside dining but it was too hot that day so we sat inside. The restaurant is very spacious. They do recommend reservations.We were very hungry, we ordered drinks and food right away. The drinks came out, everyone liked their drinks minus two friends. They ordered Johnny Walker on the rocks, why did their drinks come out yellowish. We asked the waitress & she said it was made correctly but it tasted weird. The finished it & ordered another round but straight & it came out brown like the color the whiskey was suppose to be. Very strange. We ordered appetizers and entree. The entree came out but the appetizers never did. I was looking forward to trying there Mac & cheese balls. The waitress forgot to put in the order but we were full by than so it wasn't meant to be. My friend and i spilt the Chicken BLT sandwich and the Hall burger. Both were good but needed more seasoning. The chicken sandwich was huge! And fries were really good too. Before we left we went to the ladies room, all the faucet handles were broken except for one sink. Very strange.
2021-07-13,3,I've been here a few times already and normally my experience here is good. Unfortunately I was there on Saturday and my experience was not so great. Ordered the salmon platter to share with my husband and two kids. When we were almost done with it we found a piece of plastic in the cream cheese. I didn't take a picture which I should've, but we immediately called our server over and let him know. He looked like he was in shock, he apologized and went to get the hostess that was there that day, not sure if she's the manager. Hostess took our plate to the kitchen and a couple minutes later she brought the same plate back, with the plastic removed. All she said was "I just wanted to show the chef. It's obviously plastic from the cream cheese container but I just wanted to show him" then offered to give us more bread. She could've had a completely different approach to the situation and tried to be more accommodating.
2021-07-03,1,Literally the worst martini and old fashion I have ever had, my friend and I literally just left our drinks untouched. It was so bad I called restaurant to flag this to them but no one ever called back. Save your money and avoid going here.
2021-06-12,2,Food was OK, but the service was awful. Hostess seemed like she was bothered by having to find us a table. Her head just seemed to be somewhere else definitely not at work. The waiter was very to the point. Basically very poor customer service. He forgot our drinks and when he dropped off the bill he basically tossed it at our table. Cute restaurant and nice location but customer service was very poor.
2021-06-08,3,Having a night out with friends and beer here was a nice idea. A desent beer list. The waiter recommended beer based on my preferences and straight to the point. The burger was fine, i was suprised. In the overall picture, the place was quite plesant, not very noisy. A good and somewhat original menu with different options, which moreover, were prepared relatevely quickly. I am not an expert and a lover of beer, and mayby without my friends this place would seem less interesting.
2021-06-05,3,I really enjoyed our meals at Union Hall. For mine, I had the Beets and Berries which was super fresh, flavorful, and refreshing and the Taylor Ham Egg and Cheese Flatbread which had a killer hollandaise sauce and was so nicely savory overall. We sprung for the giant mason jar drinks ($20 each for what we were promised was five drinks worth in one jar). I was a little put off to see that my mimosa jar was only half full. Why not add ice to the space, or use a different jar? I felt like it was light on the alcohol as well. Not sure I really agree with the assessment that there were five drinks inside, which is probably for the best, but still. Our waiter Francis was a bit short with us. He said nothing at all when he dropped the check off at the table and when he picked it up. I also wasn't a fan of their 90-minute time limit per table. We were there closer to two hours during brunch on a Saturday so it didn't seem like they were enforcing it too strictly. The result was that it made us feel needlessly rushed, especially since our huge drinks took twenty minutes to come out. Overall it was a good experience but not great.
2021-05-01,1,So every single time I come here I request the tater tots (because they are on the menu) and every single time, they tell me they are out of them. This is honestly frustrating because this is listed as a menu item and it seems like they no longer have this item. I've gone at various times, including early in the day, and I have been told the same thing every single time
2021-04-16,4,Came here with some friends on a recent weekend afternoon. We were able to sit outside and have a nice view of the waterfront and city. It seems like a popular brunch place but luckily we came later in the day and didn't have to wait at all.Our waitress was very friendly and gave good recommendations. We tried a few different shareable starters and some drinks.Mt friend and I both had the Hoboken spritz. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and kind of watery. I wouldn't recommend that one. They also have a nice list of wines to choose from though.To eat we had the Brussels sprouts which were amazing! I highly suggest getting those. They were juicy and cheesy. We also had the black eyed pea hummus which came with nice cruditeÃÅs. We then had the nachos which were quite large. It would have been nice to have more sauce for them as they were a bit dry. The toppings were nice and presentation well done.Overall I enjoyed coming here and would try it again sometime.
2021-04-06,5,Loved the food, service and atmosphere here ! We had a great server and the Mac and cheese balls were literally the best thing I have ever had ! The drinks were just as big as they look, strong and not expensive at all ! I will definitely be visiting again !
2021-03-27,1,Leaving one star solely because of the blonde hostest who is extremely rude. I should have stayed home but sadly I made the mistake of bringing my out of town friends here for a drink and some apps before a dinner reservation. One requirement to be a host is literally to be friendly/welcoming to people who come eat in your restuarant. I think that's pretty easy? Or, if you're not friendly you don't apply for a hostest position..... perhaps something in the back so you don't showcase your negative attitude. I asked her how she was and with an attitude she responded "good." and proceeded on with an attitude. My friend arrived late and said "hi! I'm here to meet my friends who are sitting in the back" to which she responded "interesting." My friend asked "oh, why?" She goes "we don't have a back." What?I'm sorry but the whole experience was ruined because of her. There are multiple reviews about her too, which goes to show it is time to find a new hostest.
2021-03-25,2,Came here for drinks the location is great and in front of the water. Beer selection is pretty decent and service was good. Now the reason for the two stars is the burger, I don't know how one can mess up a plain cheese burger but this place managed to. The patty was coated with a layer of salt making it largely in edible. Again not sure how or why anyone would cook a burger this way. Never again.
2021-03-21,1,We arrived at the restaurant to enjoy some apps and a drink. However our whole experience was horrible. The staff was unfortunately rude. When we arrived the host didn't ask us to follow her and started walking to our table. During our time seated, we felt rushed by our waitress. I believe that instead of seating a table and rushing them, it's best that the restaurant doesn't seat the customers. We left a good tip, however we will not be returning. As a restaurant on Sinatra Drive in Hoboken, the customer service should be a lot better.
2021-03-14,1,My first Yelp review ever. Terrible experience. My group was so excited to have a fun Sunday brunch and it fell so, so short. The staff was truly awful. Offensive and rude. Staff also tried to submit a 'no show' status to Open Table. Will never be back and will never recommend.
2021-03-14,1,Was seated at 12:30 and ordered drinks/apps. Waitress seemed disinterested but not here for her entertainment anyway. Never once was a time limit mentioned. Ordered more drinks while we had apps and the waitress came back an hour into our reservation to get our meal orders. When someone in our party asked for a different cheese selection than the meal provided, the waitress seemed annoyed and went to ask management if the change was possible. After a couple of minutes the waitress came back and proceeded to enthusiastically tell us we have 15 minutes left in the reservation and actually would not be able to stay and eat the food we had ordered. Apparently the cheese switch was too much for this establishment to handle so they promptly kicked us out and blamed it on the "time limit".  Would not recommend ;)
2021-03-07,3,Came here for a late lunch on a Sunday because they had outdoor seating with heaters. Most people were sitting inside and my friend and I were the only ones outside so it was quiet. Great view of the water and city skyline. Really enjoyed the winter drink menu (I ordered the winter colada) which was delicious. The bacon egg and truffle appetizer was tasty and so were our fried chicken blts. Now for the strange part. The wait staff almost seemed confused that they were working at a restaurant? We tried to order food twice and the waiter kept walking away from the table as we started to speak. Finally when we caught him a third time and said what we wanted for an app, he started to walk away again? This was confusing. Then he disappeared all together. We actually saw him leave the restaurant and go home. Eventually another waitress took his place but we really felt neglected still. After waiting 20 minutes after finishing our meals I had to go inside to ask for the check to be brought out because we were so cold.  All together. Food and ambiance are good. Service is poor. Might come back for the cocktails though!
2021-03-07,4,Pretty good food, service could be better -The giant mason jar drinks really made me want to try this place. I made a reservation for 12:30 on Saturday for boyfriend's birthday. We started with a mason jar of the mimosas and another of the white sangria, the French onion Mac balls and sunrise fries.Both drinks were good and we could taste the alcohol. The mac balls were tasty but as another reviewer mentioned, they could have use a little bit more seasoning. The sunrise fries were really good. To eat i had the fried chicken blt and my boyfriend had the sliced steak sandwich. Both sandwiches were pretty good. I thought the chicken could of used a little more seasoning but overall not bad. We shared the churro sundae for desert which was ok.  The service and friendliness could have been better. The people who brought our plates/ cleared them and a male manager were friendly. However the hostess wasn't super friendly and our server was ok. She checked on us but was a little dry throughout our whole meal. After ordering the sundae I went up to her and asked if she had candles since it was my boyfriend's bday. She dryly said they could do that, but the sundae came out without a candle. A little annoying since I just asked 5 minute earlier about candles. I even noted in the reservation it was his birthday hoping our server/someone would go the extra step. Overall ok dining experience but I was looking for something more special. I wouldn't recommend this place for special occasions but for regular brunch it's fine.
2021-02-14,1,We didn't even get to try the food at this place, our bad experience began at the door. I made a reservation for valentines day for me and my girlfriend days in advance. I called twice, once to ask for the hours and a second time to make the reservation (still have the log). When we got there and gave our names they told us we weren't on the system. The person who was there went to get his manager but the manager didn't even come to us to address the situation. They just asked if we had a confirmation which we didnt because they only asked for my first and last name, not my phone number. I even spelled it out for them. We asked to see if they could sit us at a later time or something but they didnt bother to help us or to make it up in some way. They just told us they cant sit us without being in the system. I understand its Valentines Day but they didnt even make an attempt to try and accommodate us.
2021-01-17,5,Delicious food and very kind service. The arugula salad is amazing, the drinks are tasty and just strong enough.
2021-01-02,1,My friends and I walked into the restaurant and we were greeted by an older lady with blonde hair. Actually, she didn't even greet us we had to get her attention as she was looking down. She made a snarky comment to us because we were 18 minutes late for our reservation and said "ya know you should call because we give the tables away after 15 minutes" The lady walked away shaking her head and cleaned and sanitized the table for us as we waited outside in the cold. She called our name and ran to table while we were pretty much outside still. Throughout our whole meal she continued to glance at us with a nasty look as well as the other servers/bar tenders. I will never come back to this place that made me feel so un welcomed and uncomfortable! I have to also note that our server we had was sweet and this has nothing to do with her!
2021-01-02,2,Greeted by a older blonde woman who I assume is the host. We were late to our reservation and informed her that it was okay if the table was given away. She responded in a scolding way with a very bitchy attitude. She shook our head at us as she had to clean an empty table. She rudely pointed to our table. The server was very kind. As we ate the blonde lady would routinely give us glaring looks. Horrible person and very unwelcoming.
2020-12-31,1,I came here last night for New Year's Eve. The only place that allowed us to seat without a reservation. We where greeted but this blonde lady which gave us a snarky attitude when asked for a seat without a reservation. I got the lobster gnocchi which was pretty salty and I couldn't find the lobster. My husband got the ny steak grill medium rear and it looked like really cheap steak. They also didn't want to accommodate the plate to his liking. And to top off I ordered a spicy margarita which came super late and it taste disgusting. Save your money and go somewhere else!!!
2020-11-25,4,I've always had my eye on Union Hall and in September 2020 I was finally able to come here. My friends and I were seated outside, which was perfect on the gorgeous day we came here. To start, we all ordered these HUGE mason jars of brunch beverages. We could choose from mimosas, white or red sangria. The red sangria was very good, but I'm not sure if it was good "bang for my buck" (I realized I would be willing to spend more on a bottomless deal). The mason jars were $20 each. The food was good, I ordered the salmonwich, which tasted very fresh and satisfying. The main star of the dish was definitely the fries that came with it. They were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Best part of this place was the view of NYC from the restaurant!
2020-11-09,3,In theory, this is a perfect spot for a sunny Saturday brunch. It's right by the Hudson, you see the Manhattan skyline and there's outdoor seating (COVID). Ambience is there. DRINKSOur table ordered mason jar sized mimosas and sangria- huge! I didn't get properly drunk after my mimosa, it was 1L by our guesstimate & cost $20. My boyfriend got the Irish coffee and it was delicious- I wish I got that instead. Decently priced with a good mix of whiskey and coffee.FRENCH ONION MAC & CHEESE BALLSCrispy, covered in cheese & filled with mac and cheese. The dish's cheese ratio left strings of cheese following the spoon with every bite. Cooked very well and good level of crunch but the Mac & cheese inside the balls could have used some seasoning. CHICKEN & WAFFLES DOG BRUNCHBeautiful plating and presentation. The sauce bed and syrup drizzle as a bed for the chicken dogs was cute and very well thought of. The waffle exterior of my skewered dish was warm, golden and sweet. I swirled it around in the sauce and appreciated the added sweetness. I'm not a fan of chicken sausage but HUGE kudos to this place for providing a modern, out of the box take on the classic chicken & waffles. Brava.The food was good but the service was not. It's still a pandemic and times are rough, it's tiring. However, our waiter mumbled the entire time and we could barely hear him. He came out with dirty ish water glasses and soon as I started looking at them, he apologized and went back inside to switch them out. He came back out like 10 minutes after taking our order to confirm our order again. He did not bring us silverware or napkins with our drinks or appetizer- these came after our main entrees were delivered.  We asked multiple times for silverware & napkins beforehand. I asked for water at least 3 times and never got a refill until after the entrees were delivered. Someone at our table witnessed him being pulled aside later so maybe he was having a rough day? Worst service I've had since restaurants started opening again this summer.
2020-09-24,5,Came by tonight with my wife, and had an incredible time.  Sat at the bar with Flynn and what a relief it is to sit with a professional bartender in Jersey.  Makes a great Old Fashioned and my wife loved her Hemingway Daiquiri.   Tacos and burger were flavored to perfection.  Cauliflower Fried Rice was AMAZING.   Great music and chill interior, I've been before , but tonight at the bar sold me !!   Can't wait to come back.
2020-08-31,5,Sat outside at the bar, can't complain because we did not have reservations and we could not get a table.  Place was active on a sunny Saturday around 3.  I had a grilled octopus salad and it was really good.  Friend had some side salad (small and definately not an entree) and cold beer.  I was very happy, would definately return.
2020-08-30,5,I have been wanting to go to Union Hall for a long time. Today my friends and i went for brunch. Of course we sat outside, but that was nothing to complain about. The view of NYC from Frank Sinatra Dr is astounding. Looking into the restaurant, it seemed nice as well.My friends got big drinks that were 1L mimosas for $20. Not bad at all.  We then all shared the Sunrise Fries, which hit the spot. The truffled bacon and cheddar cheese tasted delicious!For my main course, I had the Chicken & Waffle Dogs, which were chicken sausage corn dogs with a waffle batter breading. It came with maple syrup and a delicious dip. I fully recommend! This was a wonderful take on the classic Chicken & Waffles!Union Hall is a Hoboken Brunch must!
2020-08-30,4,Always a good time at Union Hall - they're always busy so service isn't as fast as it can be but with the quality of their food and drinks, it's a small discretion. Recommend their crispy brussel sprouts, truffle fries and tater tots, and their flatbread. Before COVID, their bar area has a lot of seating - long benches and seating around the bar. We've had large parties here that were accommodated. Similarly, they have a lot of outdoor seating available! Definitely always a staple spot in Hoboken to go!
2020-08-08,4,Went here for dinner with a friend for my first outdoor dining experience and it went great! We scanned QR code's for the menu to do contactless ordering, and the food/drinks came quickly. We ordered a bunch of small plates to split and everything was tasty. I especially liked the BEC flatbread!
2020-06-29,5,Yesterday was my dads birthday, so we went out but then came severe thunderstorms and downpours. While it sucked we couldn't go inside to wait it out in times of covid, just hid under umbrellas (they gave us another to use) and awnings they tried to make our experience as enjoyable as possible and helped us celebrate  loved the honey sriracha wings, truffle tots, chipotle pulled pork tacos, and cacio de Pepe street corn!
2020-06-28,2,I made reservations here one afternoon. Food looked great from the menu and all the pictures. Food wasn't good at all, tasted like it has been sitting there for a month. Nothing seemed fresh sadly. Pretty overpriced for what I got. Was unorganized. I won't be coming back.
2020-06-28,2,If you like the taste of charcoal then you will love this place. Okay drinks & COMPLETELY burnt food. Union Hall is a fitting name since it taste like a university dining hall food. Two stars because the staff was very friendly & good outdoor dining area.
2020-06-20,2,The food is good. Don't try to move to another table. They won't help you. I understand we are at a new normal, seating just outside. We did a reservation, but we had to seat on a defective table and under an air conditioner drops. Even we asked to switch the table, they did not help us. There were a lot of drops of water in our food and drinks.
2020-06-18,3,Blonde, elderly hostess was so off putting for literally no reason. Just nasty about everything. I know corona has everyone up in arms and is making things more difficult than usual. But as someone who works in the hospitality industry at a restaurant doing probably 10x the volume of union hall... a bad attitude can never be excused. Oh.. and $28 for 2 "to-go" drinks? That's not Hoboken prices, that's a gouge.
2020-05-17,5,One of the things I miss most right now is going to Union Hall for bottomless brunch! However, it's so nice that they are still open for delivery and takeout. The Brussel Caesar salad hit the spot, and my fianceÃÅ said the wings were delicious too. Also, it's great that they are doing wine and beer delivery as well. Really enjoying the house Pinot Grigio! Delivery was super quick today - got our order before the estimated delivery time! Thanks, Union Hall team!
2020-02-24,2,Was greeted by host who approached us saying "do you have a reservation" with a snarky look, we responded no. He said all he had available was high top tables by the bar, we said we were fine with that. Then our waitress comes over and we go to order drinks. She says "the Bloody Mary doesn't taste right today, I will let you try it". We all tried it and it was honestly the worst Bloody Mary I have ever tasted, I don't understand how someone could make or SELL a drink that tasted that way. Anyways, the food was subpar and expensive for small plates. I had the deviled eggs which were good, and the Brussels salad which was also sub par. The overall atmosphere of this place has potential but the service and the quality of food are not worth the money. Will not be returning.
2020-02-11,3,I've been here a few times over the past year and some experiences were ok and some really weren't. This last visit was for a late breakfast, and might have been one of my least favorites.. I always forget that this place specializes in small dishes meant for sharing (which I love). I ordered the avocado toast with brussels sprouts and the broccoli rabe and goat cheese frittata. I really didn't like either of them. I never need to add salt to food that I order, but both of these had zero flavor and salt and pepper was the only thing I could think to make it better. (I added a lot of salt). They were just very very bland. And the avocado had a little bit of that taste that avocado can have when it's going bad. I did love the bread it came on though. My boyfriend got the brunch special which seems pretty great. You get a bottomless drink which is either a mimosa, bloody mary or brunch punch in a giant mason jar with a crazy straw. The mimosa was really good! You could definitely taste the champagne. Then you get to choose 4 small plates, some sweet some savory, all sounded delicious. I tried a bit of each of his plates and loved the s'mores puff and the chicken corn dog. The apple pie french toast and the salmon toast really didn't have any flavor either. I don't know what it was! Our waiters were friendly and the space is really beautiful. It also is in an amazing location and right on the water. But food has never stood out, especially not this last time. I don't think I'd come back or recommend this place for anything over than drinks.
2020-01-28,5,I had an amazing time last night at Union Hall in Hoboken. Located on the waterfront overlooking the breathtaking New York City skyline, I was very impressed that this establishment had so much more to offer than just a gorgeous view. The ambiance alone made for a very personal experience, great for any occasion. My bartender Payton, greeted me with a smile as I arrived. This is something that is often overlooked and not practiced enough in this industry...the importance of being welcomed and appreciated upon walking into an establishment. Payton gave me fantastic service and recommended the whisky smash. I loved the cocktail, and appreciated the quality of ingredients and accuracy she applied to craft their signature libation. I ordered the delectable Truffled Deviled Eggs off the snack menu to start and they were delivered almost immediately. The snack menu is a great idea. It allowed me to look over the menu to decide what I really wanted, and not rush to order solely based on fulfilling my appetite as soon as possible. My next order was the French Onion Mac Balls and they were delicious. David graciously came to check in on how my food was, and I reiterated to him how much I enjoyed my experience. Outstanding service, staff, food, cocktails and environment! I will absolutely be back with friends and family to enjoy one of the best spots in Hoboken!
2020-01-19,4,Fun spot to hit up in Hoboken!  Good food and drinks, reasonable prices.  They have a cool brunch special that is $25 for 4 small plates and a giant mason jar of mimosas, sangria, or their punch.  They also have $2 beers which is nice, cheap option when you're looking to watch multiple sports games.They used to make a DELICIOUS hot Irish coffee, but last time I ordered it I was disappointed to find they changed it to a cold espresso-type drink :( not as good as the previous recipe.
2020-01-09,3,Been thinking about visiting this place for a while now , finally made it today ... well it was ok but certainly not the best bar I've been to in Hoboken but was ok : my feee issues with the place is the fact that my food was served cold :( . The food itself tasted good but it was cold . And even tho I was greeted with a smile at the door , the bartenders are not so warming . We'll go back at some point but nothing I can't live without .
2019-12-07,2,Nice location by the water. We did the pre-fix brunch. Would not recommend it. Small portions of forgettable food. The bottomless Bloody Mary is large but sans vodka. Avoid unless you're doing drinks on the patio on a nice day
2019-11-26,4,Delicious small plates. Their happy hour is really great and applies to the whole restaurant, not just the bar. I've never been here for brunch but I heard it so worth it !
2019-11-24,5,Literally can't understand why this place isn't packed for brunch every weekend! We grab a seat at the bar on Saturday or Sunday and do the "big drinks, small bites" menu. You pick an enormous, bottomless cocktail (either a mimosa, bloody, or punch) and four tapas style small plates for $29 per person. They aren't kidding about the drinks - they come in HUGE mason glasses and will refill them if you manage to finish. My bloody was nice and spicy too! Definitely recommend the salmon toast & the chicken and waffles on a stick - super delish. We also got the breakfast bao, truffle tots and buratta flatbread, which were all really good as well. It's a reasonable deal, nice atmosphere, and you get SO. MUCH.
2019-10-28,5,Great brunch deal with so many options! Their brunch offers truly the largest mimosas I've ever had and they're SO great
2019-10-27,3,The location of this restaurant is really nice, it's by the water. It was lively on a Saturday for a birthday brunch from 1-3pm. They offer unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and a sangria in personal mason jars that are about 32 fl oz. I had the chance to try the mimosa and sangria, be sure to ask for no ice in the sangria if that is your preference as they do load it up. The food was very good, they had given us the family style brunch option with 3 courses for a party of 18. There is a lot of food so we packed most of it. I would give the food 4.5 stars and the service a 5 however, the drinks were not what you would expect for a "boozy brunch". I had 2 sangria jars and felt completely bloated from liquid and had a light buzz. Each drink must have been about 5% abv per ~32 fl oz. This is a nice place and I would recommend it but if you are looking to get a buzz going, I would suggest ordering something other than their brunch options!
2019-10-26,5,Made our first visit today and we were very happy with our visit. We sat outside and had the cheese and meat board and truffle devil eggs to start. Than we moved onto the Kobe burgers with garlic fries. Everything was delicious.  Our server Nick was great. He's very friendly, knew the menu very well and was very prompt in serving us. Will visit again and will recommend to family and friends
2019-10-26,2,I wanted to like it but all the other reviews are correct, the service is terrible. It took at least 30 minutes to get our drinks from the bar. We finally got the drinks and we're rushed to order. I ordered the scallops and cauliflower fried rice.  There were 2 scallops for $14. And they were not U10, they were less than the diameter of a quarter and about 1/3 inch high, the fried rice was so salty it was not edible. The place was empty at 8pm on a Saturday night.  The others in our group were equally unimpressed. Won't be coming back, there are too many other options with better food and service nearby.
2019-10-25,1,My wife and I ate here once before earlier in the summer had a great overall experience. We went back recently to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had the opposite experience unfortunately. Not sure if restaurant was having an off night but everything went wrong with our meal. Oysters were gross, we did not finish as they looked and tasted odd. Lobster risotto came out cold, didn't taste right, and looked like it had been sitting out. 38oz porter came out lukewarm, the plate wasn't even hot. Our cocktails, old fashioned/whiskey sour/gin and jam were all late and not mixed well. We couldn't even get halfway through the meal, asked for check and to not pack anything. We didn't want to make a scene on our special night so we didn't escalate to manager. Went instead went to another restaurant with much better service and food.I would not recommend this restaurant at all if the quality of food/drinks does not change. We spent $166 after tip for a meal we couldn't finish.
2019-10-19,3,Very very average.  Avoid the Meatball Bao that would have been better off as a meatball slider.
2019-10-14,2,Their menu is just not good, even after the late summer/fall 2019 revision.  Small plates are annoying.  The "blue cheese tater tots" are tater tots dusted in salty blue cheese "powder".  This is a great space, but it goes to waste with their bad menu.
2019-10-09,4,Came for a coworker dinner - we selected a bunch of tapas to taste. All were tasty and we cleared each and every plate. The drinks were great as well, I enjoyed my tequila creation and everyone had a great time. Lots of space, wonderful service.
2019-10-06,5,I just had A large birthday celebration here. Everything from the food to the service was spectacular. Our waiter was very friendly and the managers kept coming over to make sure everything was running smoothly. Everybody had a great time and enjoyed themselves. I will definitely be back!
2019-10-04,3,Food was decent. The food menu is fairly limited, since it's more of a bar / gastropub so i expect the place focuses more on drinks. Portion sizes are on the smaller side.
2019-09-28,2,I called to make a reservation over a week in advance for brunch. When I showed up, the extremely rude hostess, told me my group would have to wait until the last two members arrived. Five minutes later, when the whole group was present, she told me it would take them some time to get a table ready for our party. After 10 minutes, she came back over to the front door and said it will be another five minutes until she can get menus for our table. The restaurant was less than half full, so not sure why she had to wait for menus. We were finally seated about 25 minutes after our original reservation time. Apparently reservations mean nothing? Food and drinks were fine, nothing special but hostess was very rude.
2019-09-28,2,I went to Union Hall last night. The food was good (just got the gnocchi and mutz). However, I sat at the bar with a friend and the bartender was one of the rudest bartenders I have ever had. I am a big foodie, and very familiar with tapas. My friend and I were just asking about portion sizes, wine menu, etc. and she was talking down to us in such a rude manner I couldn't believe it. It even continued when she asked if we wanted to open a tab. I couldn't hear her in the loud bar, so I asked what she said. In a very nasty manner she replied, "You either start a tab or pay at the end." Again, speaking to us like we were annoying her. I have never, in my life, been to a restaurant where the wait staff was so rude.
2019-09-23,5,We found Union Hall because we were staying at the W Hotel while visiting from Miami. Great place with tasty food and an amazing view of New York City's skyline. The owner even came out and talked with us for a while which made us feel even more welcomed. All of the staff was great. One of the best places I've visited in a while!
2019-09-23,2,Pros: On the waterfrontDecent foodEasy to get a reservationCons:Awful serviceNo unlimited mimosa special, other than 1 giant "un-finishable" glass of your brunch beverage preference, which is a pre-made mix.
2019-09-21,3,Came for brunch on a Saturday and it was surprisingly empty! The interior is very cute with industrial deÃÅcor. Their brunch deal was one "unfinishable" drink (large mason jar with either mimosa, Bloody Mary, or brunch punch) and your choice of 4 small plates for $25. That is a great deal and I'd definitely recommend that! I didn't want any alcohol so I ordered 2 things off the regular menu thinking the portions would be bigger, but they were still quite small. I got the small pita eggplant bite which was very tiny, but very flavorful!! I wish it was larger! And then I got the burrata flatbread which was also delicious. Again, just wish portions were larger.If you come here, get the brunch deal because that's the best bang for your buck.
2019-09-19,5,Came here for restaurant week and it was so good! The service was really nice too! I got the deviled eggs, the salmon, and the cauliflower fried rice. There was blueberry ice cream and it was so good. Overall a great experience!
2019-09-09,1,My friend came here by accident and loved it so we came together. I got food poisoning from this place, I left and spent the rest of my night in the bathroom. I got the Kobe Burger and meatballs with a side of truffle fries, I ate some of it and my stomach started to hurt so I didn't finish my meal. I should have known it wasn't meant to be when the hostess told us it would be a 20mins wait when the couple ahead of us where sat immediately. ( I'm not making it up, literally the couple in front of us went to the anisworth and they were closed so we turned around and so did they and they got seated immediately and we waited for 20mins to sit at a table that was empty the entire time). She told us they were reserved but literally no one came nor was seated there. The place wasn't packed. It should have been a sign to turn around and leave. Honestly after becoming violently ill, once I walked out I wouldn't come back here.
2019-09-08,4,Stopped by on a Sunday with a friend for drinks and apps- service was good and I like that the bar and tables are separate. We could still have a conversation but also be in a crowded bar watching football if we wanted. The food exceeded expectations! I remember loving the dinner I had a year ago but sadly had not come back for food in quite some time. I'm so glad we stopped by- everything was really delicious and perfect to share! We tried the fig prosciutto toast, truffled bacon egg and cheese flatbread and the crispy Brussels. Each dish was flavorful and came out hot and fresh. We both ordered a mimosa, mine had a fly floating towards the end? So I didn't finish it but everything was really good! Would recommend for a group of people since everything is meant to be shared or a date!
2019-09-07,1,Nothing like horrible service, abusive staff & torturous acoustics to assault the senses and ruin your evening. Skip it.
2019-09-07,5,Tried the burrata flatbread today and it was amazing. My new favorite item on the menu!
2019-09-07,1,Was very disappointed that the food was completely inconsistent from one week to the next and when I complained, the hostess added humiliation to the experience by whipping my semi-eaten plates off table in a really hostile manner saying the meal was "on her"--essentially  throwing me out and not allowing me to finish my food. When I arrived, I asked to be seated outside due to the extremely loud noise level inside, which she discouraged by telling me it's a half hour wait because I was dining alone. So I was seated inside and after about 10 minutes when no one had come to offer water or take my order, the hostess brought the waiter over herself. My drink order (a glass of water) was deferred another 10 minutes in favor of settling checks for three surrounding tables. I had to strain my voice to order and my request to substitute a side dish was refused. But the food came quickly and in the interim another staff member found me a table outside. However, the portion of salmon I received was only a very thin, tiny 2" x 3" tip of a filet, and not the same 4 oz filet I had received the previous week--it was literally small enough to fit 1/2 the palm of my small glove-size 6 hand--but the vegetable portion (that I didn't even want) had doubled in size. But because I didn't show it to anyone, two staff members insisted, without even seeing it, that I was wrong and had gotten the right portion. I was astonished to encounter such inconsistency and hostile service--especially after making a special effort to return here so soon. When I came here for the first time the previous week, I was genuinely impressed with the menu, quality and prices--despite having to sit outside because the noise inside was not conducive to conversation or appropriate for dining with a toddler or the elderly. But unfortunately after this experience I will now be retracting my recommendations and discouraging anyone else from coming here. Hoboken has enough raucous sports bars with bad service so it's a shame to waste what could otherwise be a decent dining experience and sophisticated menu with hostile staff, incongruously stark decor, TV screens, uncomfortable seating and stadium level noise.
2019-08-30,4,yup - my go to with my bestie for a happy hour bev that turns into dinner.Staff is excellent SUPER accommodating and I love feeling like I'm never rushed out.So far never disappointed with the service or food !See you there
2019-08-16,1,I went on a Tuesday, with my friends . It was one of the worst experiences, our server might of been drunk on the job  but he kept getting lost when we wanted to order something. He kept looking around us when we were ordering our food and drinks, after he got the chance to look at us to order he would hold on to the table, and slam down the things on the table. I'll definitely won't recommend this place for happy hour or food to my friends, coming to Hoboken.
2019-08-10,1,Terrible everything from waitress nasty to let me interrupt you so you can hand me everything bus boy....Food was horrid ambience was horrid attitudes were horrid DO NOT Bother
2019-08-04,4,I've been here for brunch a few times and it's pretty decent. Went for dinner last night and had a nice time. It took a while to get a server as they seemed confused as to who had our section, but once we had a waitress the service was great and attentive. Frose - delicious, but very expensive for the size. $13 just seems way too steep. Seafood sampler - a good deal for $30, but not sure I would order it again. 4 oysters, 3 large shrimp, smoked salmon, and crab salad. I don't like oysters, but my sister said they were OK. The shrimp were not good. They did not taste fresh at all, and were very rubbery. Tasted like frozen shrimp someone ran under the faucet to defrost. The salmon was the best in my opinion. Pork belly bao - probably my favorite of the mealBurrata flatbread - nice size for splitting, and would order again Previously, I've had the cheese board (awesome), lobster sliders (fantastic), and a few of the other flatbreads (all great). Their beer list is also extensive.If you're in the mood to split some meals and try a bit of everything, I recommend Union Hall. Just be aware some of the prices are a little steep.
2019-07-22,4,Union Hall is a huge restaurant space on the water close to downtown Hoboken. Excellent location and big space makes it easy to get a table. We sat outside on a weekday summer night and shared a bunch of plates. For the most part, the menu here is great for sharing, sort of a tapas style menu with American-style food options. We started with some toasts which were awesome. We got the burrata & lobster toasts, the crispy brussels, the cauliflower "fried rice", and off the mains - the meatballs and salmon. All of the food was delicious, and was really great to share to try everything. Service was great, even outside, which sometimes tends to lack in my experience because it's further away. The prices here are reasonable too! Would definitely return!
2019-07-19,2,Visited this place during lunch time this week1. Flies and more flies . Asked waitress if they could do something about it and she said they might shut down place for an extermination . I have never seen so many flies indoors of a restaurant 2. Wine selection extremely poor3. Food was decent but my gnocchi actually had six or seven floating in a pool of tomato sauce .Definitely won't visit again
2019-07-15,1,Been here three times and would give 0 stars if I could. Management could not be ruder and show less respect for paying customers every time. Food is way too mediocre for the host/waiter to be that outright rude. Extremely unpleasant and never coming back.
2019-07-14,4,I sat outside with some friends at Union Hall. The drinks were great, but the service was a little slow. We waited for a while for our check after requesting it. Union Hall was very trendy and a great place for dinks with friends or dinner with family. I did not eat there, but the tapas menu looked delicious.The bar is located on the Hudson, so there is a great view as well!
2019-07-13,3,I have to start by saying I'm sorry for the three stars because the vibe outside is nice and the lights with the view is almost worth it. Unfortunately the food was just not good. Also if you read my other reviews I really appreciate water. They served water right away... great!... but it was warm water??? Why??? Why would you serve warm water on a hot day. First red flag. We ordered the raw bar sampler and the disco fries. I got a sparkling rose and my fianceÃÅ got a cold Irish coffee. My rose was great (out of a bottle) his coffee was decent (looked good tho). The raw bar sampler was actually awful. We both love seafood and I don't need the best quality but it actually was not good. We didn't even finish it. And the disco fries they were okay just okay :(. I would say stick to wines and views here. The server also didn't care at all not that we need attention but we weren't even asked if the food was good (which I'm glad cause I have a hard time lying). I have been here once before inside when I was a little tispy with my cousins and it was fun inside. So overall just come for drinks.
2019-07-06,3,The food was actually pretty mediocre to so-so, but I'm bumping up the rating to 3 stars since the service was very kind. CONTEXT: It was a party of 11 (8 adults and 3 babies), and so they were kind and accommodating to us and for that I appreciate it.Charred octopus~ bland and underwhelming. I dunno what it was but the whole dish was so bland, that aside from the mouth texture I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the octopus from everything else in the dish.Burger~ came with "potato sticks"; even though the potato sticks were a departure from the usual fries of other places, the sticks were so tiny and thin it was almost like eating the bottom of a bag of potato chips: frustrating to grab and unsatisfying to eat due to its small size. The burger was fine, but the potato sticks were weird and annoying.Brussels Caesar~ i was intrigued by the idea; caesar salad but using brussels sprouts. That was my mistake; it totally doesn't work.Pickle Jar~ I love pickles, I even pickle some of my own foods, and this was not a good pickle jar. UH's pickle jar was probably something an amateur home pickler could pull off; kind of basic and overly vinegary with not a whole lot else to the taste.All that said, the service at UH was superb and kind, so while the food was lacking, the service was great.
2019-06-29,2,I came here for brunch with two girlfriends and had a very blah experience. The servings were small, overpriced and icky.  The French fry plate was the size of my coin purse. The sharp avocado toast cut my mouth! OUCH!! It was a quiet day but our waitress was nowhere to be found when we needed her. The people of Hoboken should leave Hoboken and experience better food.
2019-06-19,4,One of my favorite brunch spots in Hoboken! Been here about five/six timesOne star gets deducted because the food is small so I usually end up leaving a little hungry. The taste of the food is phenomenal though! Never been disappointed with my choices. The brunch mimosas and brunch punch are both delicious. They are bottomless so make sure to ask your server to refill you once your done.
2019-06-16,3,Food was not bad. But I saw receptionist brought foods out of kitchen and sneeze on the plates served to next our table. She needed to know basic hygiene.
2019-06-12,1,Amazing place & great customer service. Just one thing that made me give them a 1 star. I attended this place on Saturday for a private event, & to my surprise, I noticed the manager disgustingly pointing his finger at one of the servers, IN HER FACE. Not to mention it was in front of all of us. I also saw when he smacked the phone in her hand. If you're going to run a place, learn how to take care of your servers as well. They do a lot. Thanks for the food though!
2019-06-03,1,I would give this place zero stars if I could. The service was awful. After about 30 minutes a waiting to order we final ordered, another 45 minutes for the orders to come out. They only brought out half the orders. 20 minutes later they brought out 2 more plates. Still 2 orders shy of everyone's food. The manager came and asked if everything was good and when he was told we were still missing 2 plates he said he would check on them. Another 20 minutes goes by with nothing. I can not review the food because I never got mine. The group paid and just left. They did take a round of beers off our tab for the inconvenience of not bringing out 2 orders of food.
2019-06-02,3,First time here on a Sunday limited menu assuming that's because it's a Sunday brunch lunch menu prices are reasonable staff is friendly and helpful. Food is okay nothing special to speak of. The food service was very slow waited a long time they were not that crowded maybe 50% full. Not sure I will go out of my way to return if in the area
2019-06-02,4,It was our first time eating there. The atmosphere was really good. The food was also. We had the Tuna Tartar melt. And the octopus. The only thing lacking was the service. We wanted a window seat to view the Hudson and once seated it took over 10 minutes to just get someone attention to get our drink order. It seemed we had a different waiter every time we wanted somethingI would recommend the food. But service is lacking
2019-05-28,4,FOOD WAS TASTEFUL! Came here with my girlfriend.  I enjoyed every single meal besides one. The menu  are filled with  small tapas which I loved because you can try different types of food on the menu. With outdoor seating and Frose you just can't go wrong. The only thing I didn't like as much was the meatballs. As a New York City gal, every time I have the chance to try something new in Jersey I am very skeptical because I'm very picky with where I go. However this place is amazing, the Doritos shrimp were my fav! HUGE  shrimp but for 4.5 and I only get one shrimp is kind of sucky.
2019-05-27,4,We did a private event here for work. I really liked the vibe of the place, was casual and the staff was real nice. I am looking forward to coming back here on summer night and just hanging by the boardwalk.
2019-05-26,5,This is my to go brunch spot! They serve small plates that are perfect if you just want to try a bunch of different things or if you're with a group and like to share. A 25$ brunch special is also available and allows you to pick 4 different small plates and comes with a choice of one unfinish-able mimosa, Bloody Mary or their special brunch punch. Pretty good deal if you ask me! Every brunch dish will be something you've never tried before and has some unexpected twist. Big shoutout the person creating these! Must try the chicken waffle dog! They have a nice outdoor patio if you like to sit outdoors with a Manhattan skyline view and plenty of seating indoors as well. I will have to come for a dinner soon as I've heard some amazing things about this as well. See you soon!
2019-05-26,4,While in, Hoboken New Jersey, the Grubbing Crew and I decided to visit some suggested eateries around town. First stop, Union Hall. A Gastropub with an assortment of meals you all would love, especially the starters. we were glade we stopped by.
2019-05-25,2,This review is not about the food. The food was good but service was awful. The two stars are to the food only. That being said, when we asked for items such as mayo (that came with the food anyways) on the side, our waiter told us it couldn't come as a side.While our group had a lot of questions due to dietary restrictions, we were soon greeted with an abrasive attitude. Our waiter only game to check on our group a handful of times during the 2 1/2 hours we were there. When the time came to pay, our group calculated the bill to split everything g equally. Instead we ended up with one person from our group being charged almost $200, another person being charged close to $100 and the rest of us around $35. Our waiter was not only not apologetic for his mistake but was rude when we raised concerns about the charges on our card. He dismissed our concerns and responded rudely.While I like Union Hall very much tho experience was enough to never come back.

2019-05-19,3,Came for happy hour on a Friday night. It was our first time. The aesthetic is very enticing with the outdoor lights. The vibe looked good so we decided to try. The food options were minimal. I took a few photos of the food we ordered. The duck tacos, lobster toast and chipotle sweet potato fries. The meat in the duck tacos were very dry as if it was a day old. The lobster toast was ok and the "chipotle" fries are just sweet potato fries. The food def looks better in the photos than it tasted. But also keep in mind that I am a photographer. So it's my job to make things look good.
2019-05-19,1,Came in on a Sunday afternoon at about 1:30pm and sat at the bar for a drink. It was a pretty empty bar (today is the arts festival so most people are out wandering around on Washington). We sat for a few minutes and nobody came over. Then a group came in and sat to our left. The bartender went over and chatted them up. They had drinks in a couple of minutes.He finally came our direction, made no eye contact, threw two napkins in our direction, said nothing and walked away. We discussed it for a couple of more minutes and decided to leave. What happened?  Discuss amongst yourselves.
2019-05-06,2,The hostess was extremely rude to my party when she wouldn't sit the 4 of us because the 5th person of our party was running late. I completely understand if you are A) a 5-star restaurant or B) extremely busy. It was 1:30 pm for brunch and the place was half empty, so there was so reason we couldn't sit down. God forbid we want to spend money at your establishment by ordering drinks while we wait for our 5th. When asked why, all we got was, with attitude, "it's the rule" with zero explanation.Probably won't go again, plenty of other options in Hoboken without dumb rules and hostesses with attitude.
2019-04-07,3,Stopped in here for a bite to eat. Our experience was a little bizarre. The menu is set up strangely. Our bartender didn't recommend anything and she seemed irritated. Paul the bartender was great though. He made excellent recommendations. We started with four oysters. They were a great size and had a great flavor. There were a couple shells in them though. and I thought it was odd that they weren't served on ice. We also ordered the seared salmon and the truffle deviled eggs. Ordered a beer and an Irish mule. The mule was very good. The deviled eggs were creamy and had great flavor. Didn't taste much truffle though. There was one and a half eggs total on a small bed of arugula. The salmon was good but small. Cooked perfect. The yucca chips were perfect and salty. The Swiss chard was cooked perfect. Def recommend that dish.
2019-04-03,1,If we could give zero stars we would. Terrible service, managers are not professional. On their phones and don't care about the patrons. Very sad because the location is great!  Food is only ordinary, we will definitely not be back!
2019-03-19,5,A gastropub with a great view of the water.  I wasn't super hungry when we went since I'd had a big lunch but I got a salad with brussel sprouts that I wasn't sure how it would taste since I'd had cooked brussel sprouts that came out good but wasn't sure about raw ones.Turns out I couldn't even taste anything that was odd to my taste buds and it was very good along with being an innovative dish.  It was a little quieter than some places in the area.  Service was really good and the s'mores dessert alone was worth the visit.  If I were in the area, I'd go back.
2019-03-12,4,Great idea to have "unfinishable" drinks with 4 small plates- keeps it light and casual. Food was decent- I had the avocado toast, breakfast taco, burratta flatbread & truffle fries. I will say the burratta flatbread was one of the best things I've ever had but the other items were okay. However, I didn't go there for the promise of good food, I went for the experience of getting the unfinishable mimosa which was great! They also offer 1 free refill and were very generous. The service was okay. My friends and I were fine with it because we were enjoying eachother's company & our drink/food & it was also Leprecon in Hoboken that day so it was a little crowded, but I could see other guests potentially being bothered by it. I would definitely come back!
2019-03-02,5,Love this place! Plenty of space, never too crowded and offers American-style tapas which are delicious, reasonably priced and good portion sizes! In general has a wide variety of options for vegetarians and those looking for healthier fare. Also has a great unique specialty cocktail menu as well as a house brewed beer for just $2. The octopus was one of the best octopus dishes I've ever had, perfectly cooked and flavored. We came here Saturday during the day on "LepreCon" which was a bit loud and busy, but normally has a more casual setting. Also has plenty of TVs and bar space if you're watching a game. Also the service was attentive and helpful. No complaints!
2019-02-24,3,This place has a beautiful decor and definitely an expansive menu with great vegetarian options. I came here for a birthday dinner and the place was able to seat our group of 20 in a middle area which worked out well since it was near the bar also. Initially when i looked at the menu i was surprised at a reasonable prices and the vast vegetarian variety, however i came to find that the plates were extremely small. For 5 of us, we ordered 7 plates amongst ourselves to feel a bit full. The best things on the menu were definitely the Mac and cheese balls, the burrata (DO NOT eat the raisins. They're extremely sweet), and the cheese board. Would come back again, but i have it a 3 Star because even though the place had good food, i had to go to chipotle after to fill myself up.
2019-02-24,3,Great location, trendy indoor atmosphere, pricey tapas, average food! Restaurant is located on river road with a view of the skyline and piers. They have a large bar area, counters along the windows, and a bunch of tables. The menu had options for everyone, vegetarian, vegan, gluten free etc. Many options for drinks as well. We ordered the Brussel sprouts with pork and cauliflower riced with pork. The pork was extra to add to the dish and we didn't feel it was worth it. They barely added any pork. We also ordered the cheese board $14 and three glasses of red wine. They recommend ordering 2-3 tapas per person but the two of us were filled with what we ordered. I wouldn't go running back but it may be fun with a large group where you share a bunch of dishes. It was pricey tho!
2019-02-24,2,I feel like I wanted to like Union Hall- I think the decor is nice and it looks like a cute place. In theory, having the small plates and trying different food option is cool and I usually really like that. But honestly the food was not good. We got the brunch special with mason jar drink. The jars were extremely dirty. All around I just didn't feel like it was a very clean place. And on top of that the service was awful. It took them 20 minutes to greet us (it wasn't that busy).  I felt like we were the forgotten table because everything just took soo long. I've been twice and this happened to me both times. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend.
2019-02-10,4,My girlfriend and I went to Union Hall for Hudson Restaurant Week. It's located right on Sinatra Drive, ten minutes walking from Hoboken Path. It has a nice setting and casual, date night or good drinks with friends vibe. We got the three course pairing. The food was really good and the Brussel Sprout Cesar Salad was incredible! The wait staff was friendly and the service was fast. Great happy hour too ...$5 glasses of wine Highly recommend the Brussel Sprout salad! $$$
2019-02-05,5,Went into Union Hall for happy hour on Monday afternoon. Delicious Mac and cheese bites and $1 oysters. Half off on wine and beer for happy hour. The Mac and Cheese balls were delicious. Service was quick and accurate. Will definitely return to see what else they have to offer
2019-02-05,4,Great spot to catch up with friends or coworkers for lunch on weekdays or for happy hour after work! The post-work happy hour crowd is honestly the biggest draw for Union Hall. Union Hall has a wide selection of beer, wine, and cocktails. Their food options are all delicious as well. The space is huge and can fit large groups easily, but they also have smaller tables if you're just going to catch up with someone one on one or on a date. I'm giving Union Hall four stars mainly for the food. There are very few healthy options on the menu, so be prepared to break your diet if you are on one. Moreover, the portions are smaller than I expected for the price. The food portions are kind of like large tapas. I will say though, despite the small size and the unhealthy-ness, all the food that we ate did taste great!
2019-01-31,4,A very beautiful decor inside although a little chilly because we sat by the door. Took us a drink or so to warm up then we were good to go ! all the apps i ordered were fantastic from the wings to the truffle fries yumm also the philly hanger steak sandwich was delicious and the cesar salad was just alright but the shrimp were huge on top!but you MUST try the s'mores dessert totally original and delicious the churro sundae was pretty awesome as well !
2019-01-07,2,On Friday night I met my girlfriend for a drink after work at Union Hall since they are the featured Hoboken Secret Happy Hour spot through Hoboken Happy Hours for the month of January.   I typically tend to go out uptown however the special for the first week of Secret Happy Hour is  1/2 price house wines and we figured why not have some cheap drinks.   We got to the bar around 6:45 pm and it was pretty empty so we easily got seats at the bar.   When we ordered our first round of wines, the bartender told us their normal happy hour special is  1/2 price houses  (house wines are $7) through 7 pm and she didn't seem to understand what we were talking about when we tried to show her the Hoboken Happy Hour Instagram Post.   When we went to order our second round of drinks, it was after 7 pm so I again brought up the Secret Happy Hour special - she was very confused and had no idea what I was talking about.  She studied the Instagram post on my phone for a while until she finally said OK.  Apparently the bar-tending staff was not aware of the monthly promotion they are doing.  We shared their cauliflower fried rice (w/o pork belly) which was tasty and a good portion to snack on.   By the time we were getting ready to close out around 9 pm, the place had filled up and there was a private 30th birthday party taking place.  We each had 3 wines in total.  When we got the bill,  two of the wines rang up at 4 dollars each and the other wines rang up $3.50 each.  If the regular happy hour special is  1/2 price house wines and the secret happy hour special is  1/2 price house wines all day/night for the 1st week, then why weren't all the wines the same price?  All of the wines should've rang up at $3.50.   When I asked our bartender about this, she said she wasn't sure and said she just keys into the computer and that's what it comes up.  She also didn't automatically take the bill away to  correct it; she instead made me feel uncomfortable for bringing up a $1 difference.   Bottom line, if you are running a monthly promotion, you should make sure your staff is aware of it and also make sure your POS system bills the right price.
2019-01-02,5,What a fantastic evening! The food was creative and delicious. We all thoroughly enjoyed our experience.
2018-12-22,3,Small plates are not so small plates, which was good. Decent food, steak I ordered was tasty but a little chewy. Beet salad and truffle flatbread was good too. Don't expect a very large menu. Decent place to check out during weekends.
2018-12-15,1,My friend and I came here for some casual drinks. As we were standing in the bar area - contemplating also ordering food - we noticed that the executive chef was standing right by us, taking a look at the dining area. Clearly he wasn't very busy and was checking out how many people were eating, etc. Thinking we would be nice and start up a convo, we went over to him and very simply asked "what kind of food do you have tonight", hoping he would recommend a certain dish or tell us some of his favorite things on the menu. We had never been here before and were excited to get some good info from the executive chef himself. To our surprise, he laughed in our face and told us "are you serious? Go look at a menu in the front", and turned and walked away into the kitchen. He was incredibly rude. I have no desire to eat at a restaurant whose executive chef treats customers like that. Very rude and disappointing. Wish I could give this place zero stars. Don't come here!
2018-12-14,3,BRUNCH....food was great. Not for the hungry. Brunch special was a taste of most of there items. KOBE burger  don't think they meant Kobe beef maybe how Kobe Bryant likes his burger, UNFINISHABLE not because you'll be wasted but you'll have a stomach ache maybe next time I'll try the punch  and not the mimosa. Overall it's fun with friends and I guess it's instagram worthy( being the gram is fraudulent) you can act tipsy with your giant mason jar. Not too pricey for a few likes!
2018-12-09,5,I cannot say enough good things about this place! I've come for brunch, for dinner for New Years Eve, but most recently I hosted a party here and the entire event was seamless. From food to drinks to service and the amount of bartenders they had on to accommodate our group. A very pleasant experience! So if you're looking for a place to host your next event, definitely consider Union Hall. Speak with David, the owner. He is super accommodating and personable and will do all he can to make your event a memorable one.
2018-11-24,2,Great location, I've been in here three times now. Out of the three times I've been in here it was pretty slow each time, however I was only able to get a cocktail one time. Why? The bartenders and barbacks look at you and walk away. Is it a language barrier? Is it a Hoboken thing? Not I'll be right back, not a hello or even a nod. Sorry, was I supposed to greet YOU bartender? The food menu looked intriguing. But ill never know.
2018-11-10,1,Service is absolutely awful and the brunch "drinks" are a scam. To start, the hostess didn't open the door for me and my friend when both our hands were full. She literally just stood there watched us struggling to open the door. It was an omen of what was to come. The server (there was never any one dedicated server; there were just employees wandering to our table) then didn't get menus for everyone and didn't take orders for about 15 minutes. After orders were placed, the server never brought over the drinks from the bar. They were just sitting on the bar for 5-10 minutes! My friend just went to the bar to get them. Let's get to those "unfinishable" drinks. Those things have ZERO alcohol in them. I drank an entire Bloody Mary and it was as if I drank a gallon of Bloody Mary mix. I felt awful and wasn't buzzed whatsoever. The most energetic our roaming servers were was when they wanted to take our food away. We were still eating and they came back 3+ times trying to take our food!This place created a very poor experience. The food was average at best but the poor service made this an all around bad experience.
2018-10-24,4,After an intense look at the menu, I had my doubts about this place. Well, let's just say, "never judge a book by its menu" LOL. My food here on a Saturday night was great! To start, there were no appetizers ordered because we knew we would be saving room for dessert. Skipping an appetizer, we put in an order for two drinks - one beer and a Malibu bay breeze both standard, but I have to admit I wasn't a fan of my drink. As for the food, there were no complaints AT ALL. If you have the pleasure of visiting, order the cauliflower rice. It's very different than what I would normally order, but to my surprise, not only was it fulfilling, but tasty too. The burger and steak were also a hit! MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE MINI CHURRO - SO DARN DELICIOUS. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my food while dining here.
2018-09-30,3,I came here with my boyfriend around 3:30pm on Sunday. We were hoping to have brunch and sit outside since the day was great. The place looked perfect for what we were looking for. To start we found out that they didn't serve brunch after 3pm which was ok for us. Later, we asked about the size of the plates because it seemed to be kinda inexpensive, they happened to be appetizer size and to be honest neither fulfilling nor tasty. Be aware that this place is to go out for drinks and apps, not for eating. The service was good and the environment was nice as well, but the food in general is not good at all
2018-09-30,3,This is my second time visiting this establishment. First time I had some apps and a couple mains to share and it was just OK. I came here a second time and ordered the Kobe burger. It didn't taste phenomenal and it comes with string potato strips which is just deep fried and not appetizing to eat. It's almost like a garnish as opposed to a side. I would have ordered fries instead which is better suited for a burger. It only comes with cheese and some sauteÃÅed onions and wish there a bit more texture, maybe a slice of tomato or something (vs just putting on ketchup). Our server was nice but it seems a bit understaffed (came around 4pm).
2018-09-15,1,Would love to review the food and drinks here however we never got served. Sat there for a solid 10-15 minutes and had several waiters including the manager walk by, look at us, and walk away. So we left. Worst service of all time.
2018-09-08,5,Great place for a bunch of small plates. Would recommend sitting outside or by the window. They have a DJ on Friday/Saturday night and drink specials. Wait staff is very friendly and will give reccos on dishes to order. The Brussels salad is delicious!
2018-09-06,5,Executive Chef Matt Arlington is now only a winner of Chopped, but an incredibly friendly guy and astute business owner! I've had the pleasure of being a customer many times at this restaurant and also enjoying their beers and bar atmosphere which is one of my favorites in all of Hoboken.  They have a lovely Terrace set up as well as large open windows with outward facing seating so you can enjoy the beautiful Manhattan views alongside your food or beverage. Additionally they have a comfortable clean and modern interior to enjoy your favorite sports event. I've also had the fortune of working with them for several special events featuring oysters and shot pairings. During these some large parties have been present at their long community tables, but they are set up in a way that allows everyone to move freely without feeling congested. Highly recommend for both high quality food and drinks at an incredible value!!
2018-08-25,2,First brought out the wrong drink, no big deal. Took a long time to bring the right drink, still not a big deal. Told manager, as he stopped by table and he got us my drink. Food is all gimmicky and flavorless. Lobster roll tasted off, we told the manager and he had the server offer us free shots.... at 12PM. We ate about 60% of the food as it was all we could stomach. Good brunch deal for the drink I suppose. My guess is they are only in business because The W is booked and people try this place next store instead.
2018-08-13,5,We ordered a variety of items and we loved each and every one of them! The service was great, restrooms were clean, atmosphere was perfect! The truffle bacon, egg, and cheese flatbread was by far my favorite and my husband loved the crispy salmon slider but the dorito fried shrimp, French onion Mac and cheese bites, and meatballs....my mouth is drooling just thinking about it all!! Finish it off with a mini milkshake of the day. Union Hall did not disappoint!
2018-08-12,4,Came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 730. There were plenty of seats and most people were having drinks. There are less TVs than your typical Hoboken spot but the crowd seems familiar as does the atmosphere. In the summer the place is open and pretty airy and loud. Small plates are served with some larger entrees as well. We ordered the following:- Dorito Shrimp - very good- Truffle Fries - excellent - Big Mac Attack Beer Tartar - average - Philly Hangar Steak - average - Cauliflower Fried Rice - one of the best dishes - Mexican Street Corn Risotto - one of the best dishes - S'mores Cookie Skillet - very good- Drinks - Glass of chenin blanc, El Presidente, french Malbec - cocktail was ok but the french Malbec was terrific and for 10 dollars a stealI started this review thinking Union Hall should get 3 stars but the food was actually pretty well done and creative. Our waiter was pretty slow and had very little knowledge about the menu. We asked about filleting the branzino and he was confused which is normally a pretty standard request. That said everything we had was mostly really good, the prices were reasonable and it was easy to get a table. I'd go again especially because there are a lot of other interesting things on the menu!
2018-08-02,5,Go for their bottomless brunch. It's amazing!! You get four small plates that's super filling and an unfinishable drink. Me and my boyfriend both got mimosas and we really couldn't finish them!!! They give you a giant mason jar with a crazy straw and fill it half way twice for you which ends up being a liter. They definitely don't cheat you on the champagne either!!! Going back next weekend with my mom and sister. Decent price it was $24 for all the food and drink which isn't bad for brunch prices in Hoboken! Great place with a great vibe and if you can get a seat outside or their outward facing bar you get a view of the New York City water line!
2018-07-17,3,I came here for brunch last weekend to celebrate a friends birthday. They have a $24 brunch special where you can pick four small plates and get a giant mason jar filled with you cocktail of choice. I wasn't drinking that day because I had to drive back home later but I still felt the deal was with the price and my brunchmates were more than happy to enjoy my drink for me. For my first I ordered the salmon toast, second churro puff, third sliders (they chose two for you), and French toast. The salmon toast and churro puff where good but very small portion. I actually wanted the chicken and waffle dogs but they were out (bummer). The two sliders were the lobster roll and a veggie pita. I felt these were he perfect size. The last was the French toast with chocolate chip cookies to which they gave me a very generous three pieces that I enjoyed. I just wish the portions had been more even. My other critique would be that the wait staff was very inattentive. The waiter just seemed to not care, rarely checked in, mixed up our plates, and wasn't very friendly. Other than that the food was good and I think it's worth the deal for a good cheap brunch.
2018-07-10,4,Sat outside over the weekend and the service was better than some other places that provide outdoor seating in Hoboken. We ordered a few small plates to split and The cauliflower fried rice was great! Liked the atmosphere a lot and would return if I was meeting up for small apps and drinks with friends
2018-07-06,3,Came in one Saturday afternoon for brunch with a reservation at 12:45 for a party of four. The place was pretty empty for prime brunch time (and didn't really fill up as we were eating either).We all decided to do the prix fixe menu, where you get 4 small plates, 1 large drink (with a refill) for $24 per person. For the drink, they come in a HUGE mason jar, and you get a choice of mimosas, bloody marys, or the UH brunch punch. I had asked our waiter if we would be able to try a bit of the brunch punch before we committed to it. He said we couldn't because they make a batch directly into the large mason jar. Ok fine. So I get the bloody mary, which is not bad but there's very little alcohol in it. Plus, bloody mary's are pretty filling for me and I can only drink so much of it, so I wanted to switch to a mimosa. When I asked if I could switch, our waiter said we couldn't because they make the drinks in huge batches and just refill it into your cup. So which is it? Because it sounds to me like the liar was just too lazy to accommodate the customers. Bad drinks aside, some of the food is pretty good.1st plate (choose from a selection of toasts) - I had the smoked salmon toast. This was good but the the edges of my toast were a little bit burnt.2nd plate (choose from breakfast tacos, chicken waffle dogs, and a few other items I can't remember) - I really liked the chicken waffle dog. The chicken was a nice change. It's also the perfect size because I think if it was any bigger, I probably would have gotten sick of it.3rd plate (choose from a selection of salads or a slider duo) - I went with the slide duo, which was some gyro sammie, and a mini lobster roll. The gyro was great, while the lobster was just okay. It came topped with these fried onion straws, which didn't seem to go with it.4th plate (choose from two flatbreads, or chilaquiles skillet) - I picked the chilaquiles but I wish I hadn't. It was soggy and cold.It seems that their menu is a mix of meh items and pretty good items. If you are coming for brunch, I would recommend just ordering a la carte, and getting a beer instead of one of their brunch cocktails.
2018-07-05,3,Four of us came into Union Hall around 12:45pm for our brunch reservations. My cousin, who lives in Hoboken, made reservations and could not get anything earlier. This seemed odd, because the entire time we were there, it wasn't even half full. Perhaps they were expecting more walk-ins? We all opted to do their brunch special, where you get a giant mason jar cocktail and 4 tapas. The menu was actually kind of confusing, but we worked it out. You pick your choice of a cocktail and then pick one item from each part of the menu - there are 4 parts. You get a small, 1 person serving of the item. I thought their chicken waffle corn dog was phenomenal. The lox toast was also really good. I thought the lobster roll was kind of forgettable, as was the vegetable pita. I'd come back for a full order of corn dogs though! The staff seemed to be confused about what was in the cocktails. One person told us one thing, while another person told us something else about the ingredients in the cocktails. One of my cousins cannot have any kind of hard liquor and she wanted to know the ingredients before ordering. One person told her their house brunch punch had champagne while the other told her it had vodka. Which one is it? Also, they lied to my other cousin when she asked about trying the cocktails. She first asked if she could try the cocktail first before committing to a giant mason jar. They told her it wasn't possible because they make it the moment you order it. Later on, she asked if she could swap cocktails, since we each get one refill. They told her that they have it made to order in a jug and they just pour it into our cups when we want a refill. WHICH ONE IS IT? I'm conflicted about what kind of rating to give Union Hall. On the one hand, it was a nice brunch and we sat for a very long time catching up. On the other hand, they're kind of lying liars...
2018-07-05,5,Great location, service and food. We were there for dinner and enjoyed the "tapa style" dishes. There was four of us and we so we had a great variety of dishes. Our favorite dishes included: tomato flatbread, roasted beets, over the top grilled octopus, grilled tuna, seared salmon, tasty kobe burger, hanger steak and kale brussels caesar. For dessert we enjoyed warm strawberry & rhubarb tart and pineapple upside down.Worth a visit and go family-style so you can try everything.
2018-06-21,4,Ever since moving to Hoboken, Union Hall was strongly recommended to me for a brunch option.I've been here twice so far, and the food has been solid. First time here I got the Brunch Special for $24 (you get to order 4 tapas along with bottomless mimosa/Bloody Mary/special brunch punch.I (as with my fellow 3 guy friends) were unable to get refills of the mimosa as one jar each was too much for us haha. We marveled at others downing 3+ mason jars.Brunch Tapas Review:-Corn dogs are good (wish they gave bigger portion!)-Smoked Salmon Toast was the winner (second time here  instead of the brunch special I only ordered the salmon toast entree--worth it)-Brussel Sprout Salad was mediocre, all the salad tapas aren't that appetizing.-Challah Chocolate French Toast portion is HUGE and will fill you up. Though, ours was a bit soggy.
2018-06-20,1,I haven't yelped in a while but dinner at this place last night was one of my worst dining experiences ever. On the positive side, the outdoor seating area and location were excellent. The food was barely average. On the negative side, the service was awful. It was a solid 40 minutes between ordering and getting our first drink. After that, 20 minutes between the follow up drink orders and delivery. And of course they were wrong every time.   The waiter spilled a bowl full of ketchup on a sport coat at the table and struggled to take accountability.  Food to forever to come out. When we asked the waiter why the long delays, he blamed the kitchen and bar staffs. Said they were too busy. Had to laugh. Place was half full on a Tuesday night. We asked twice to see the manager, but they never came out. So many options on this street, will never go back.
2018-06-18,5,We always go there for brunch and the food never fails to impress us. If you like a tapas-style restaurant with a variety of deliciously tasty and original dishes, then Union Hall is the place to go! Plus, it's right on the river. We'll keep coming back!
2018-06-16,3,My Brussels Cesar's salad was reallly good but my bf burger came missing bun and Potatoes took a while t get that along with utensils ice for our beverages and forever to get the check. Service was horrible and r was NOT busy.
2018-06-07,4,This place was okay. Service was a little off,  but Stephen didunderstand how our experience was and made it up to us. The food was decent; nothing really stood out. It was a nice spot for drinks with friends and had a nice atmosphere. I would skip the food and come for drinks at the bar.
2018-05-31,5,Let me just say, their brunch was amazing. Super good deal for bottomless mimosas in a super cool Instagram worthy mason jar. Their small plates were delicious. Went with some friends and we had a great time. Awesome place if you love alcohol! Definitely will be returning
2018-05-26,4,spent my Saturday afternoon here over MDW on a nice sunny day. Got a great table with a large open window, which was perfect to be able to get air conditioning whilst also enjoying a hot day. Our server was very attentive to our needs and consistently made sure we were topped up on drinks. We ordered a few of the small plates to eat. The chilaquiles and the crispy Brussels were our choices. Both were very tasty. My one critique was that they were very small. I know they do a "small plate" brunch special deal where you are meant to order 4, but seeing as we ordered them as individual items and paid $9-10 for them I expected a little more food. The chilaquiles were very tasty in my opinion. The Brussels were good but nothing special. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and would recommend it as a fun bar, perhaps not to have a full meal, but definitely a great hangout spot
2018-05-24,3,We had high hopes as the hostess was very nice about getting us seated outside. We waited a little longer and was told people weren't showing so we shouldn't be long. Meanwhile we saw an empty table for four (we were two couples) open for at least 20minutes. First sign. Once we were seated we ordered three or four shared plates. The food was good flavoring and diversity of dishes was great. Main issues we felt- one our waiter didn't check in on us and forgot to tell us they were changing the keg for 20 minutes which is why the beer took too long. Then the waiter kindly told us the kitchen was closing soon and we needed to put in any other orders- so we quickly ordered two more entrees. Only one ended up coming out... we waited to eat thinking the other would be out shortly ... it never came and when the waiter came over we asked about it and he just said he thought they already brought it and we ate it- nope and nothing could be done because the kitchen was closed. He just removed the item from our bill. We were quickly cleaned up as we were picking at fries because the outside closed at 1045/11. It was only 1020 and the hostess was taking away forks and knifes while we grazing at the fries and never asked if we were actually done. By the end we just wanted to pay the bill and leave- one of us is a server and understands how it works, but was unhappy with how the situations were all handled.
2018-05-23,4,Like the new feel, vibrant crowd (happy hour on a beautiful spring day). Haven't tried the food. View is spectacular. Really just wanted to lament the fate of good beer in Hoboken. A few years ago, craft brewers had a foothold in most taps in town. Now that the large companies have purchased a few (Goose island, Ommegang, I'm missing quite a few), the taps are once again dominated by big brewing, with very little in the way of exciting beers. I'm sure the bars are happy, but I am always left disappointed in my selection, and the beer tastes just a bit less exciting for that
2018-05-16,3,Came here for a private happy hour event with my team. There was about 60+ of us and they accommodated us very well. They had a section by the bar blocked off for us. There was plenty of appetizers and food to eat and the bartenders were really attentive with the drinks.Their food options were good. I'm giving them a 3-Star only because I didn't get the opportunity to dine in and try it out. It's a decent place for drinks and food after work
2018-05-11,4,Overall, this is a really cute restaurant. Right by the water. Met some girlfriends for brunch, and we made a reservation for a Sunday. The drinks that come with the brunch prix fixe menu (and who doesn't love that) are absolutely huge! Apparently it's bottomless drinks, but I'd be surprised if anyone can drink more than two of these. The prix fixe menu is simple, for $24 you get a large cocktail (bloody mary, brunch punch, etc.) and choice of 4 plates from their menu, one from each category. I went rogue and ordered the kobe burger with a fried egg, because let's get real, who would pass up a kobe burger with a fried egg. It was delicious, reasonably priced, service was good. Solid 4 stars. Don't expect to be overly wowed, but for what it is, it's good.
2018-05-10,5,We went here on a whim one Wednesday night while walking and looking for a restaurant by the water. Union Hall totally delivered! We (two of us) got 4 small plates, figuring we could always order more. Not needed! We got tons of food. Our orders were: the slider trio, the BLT lettuce wraps, brussels caesar salad, and cauliflower fried rice. The only thing that was a little not to taste was the pork belly in the BLT wraps- wasn't too crispy, just super fatty (I know pork belly is such an acquired taste though). However, we got so much food that we hardly needed to touch the BLT wraps, anyway! The atmosphere on the water, the 1/2 price Wednesday drinks, our meal, and the price all made for a great time! We can't wait to go back for Happy Hour to try the $1 oysters and even more drink specials.
2018-05-05,4,We had wings which were great and tuna poke which was also great Entree kobe beef burger which was in top 10And flank steak also top 10Great service great view of the water Cool place
2018-04-24,4,Had a pretty good meal, Charceuterie/Slider Trio/Fries.  Good service, nice selection of beer.  Good place for a meal in Hobes
2018-04-15,5,This is an amazing bunch option in Hoboken. For $24 you get a huge drink (mimosa, Bloody Mary or brunch punch) that they continuously refill and four small plates. It truly is a great value. For the small plates, you get to choose between a bunch and they give you a nice variety. I'm a vegetarian and had no problem finding four plates, whereas my friends are not, and also had no issue. I'd personally recommend the tomato flatbread and DEFINITELY the brunch punch. It is kind of like a white sangria, and is absolutely amazing.
2018-04-14,1,I'll never know if their food is good. I was sat on the patio and waited 20 minutes to be served. Another table who was seated 15 mins after us was quickly waited on. That's when we decided to just leave. The waitress didn't even look in our direction. They should hire more waitresses.
2018-04-13,5,Really enjoyed this place for lunch.  Awesome small plates and good drink selection.  Got to try a bunch of different things for a reasonable price.  Service was good as well.Highly recommend the slider trio and the poutine.
2018-04-06,5,This was an awesome brunch deal! The gigantic drink was delicious and fun to try so many menu options on the tapa style small plates. I went with a very large group and they were able to comfortably seat us all and manage the large orders well. The food was delicious, including a chicken and waffle dog that was something I have never seen before, a good variety of breakfast toast options, and some savory skillet or attic options too. Definitely a good spot with friends for a long brunch. I have been here for dinner and as a bar at night as well and enjoyed union hall all around. Great waterfront location and easy to get to from transit such as the path.
2018-03-31,5,The Union Hall Brunch is AMAZING. I was very pleasantly surprised!The restaurant is right on the water, and it is quite spacious inside. It's a nice ambiance with a very trendy feel. On a Saturday afternoon, it was very crowded and everyone had their signature BIG drink in a mason jar. I highly recommend the U.H. Brunch Punch - it was an amazing mix of alcohols and juices, and it definitely did the job. We were all feeling it!The $24 brunch prix-fixe is a STEAL - you get your choice of 4 small dishes with the BIG drink, and the food was good portioned and high quality. I love the tastings idea - the whole table shared all of the dishes and thought every single one was fantastic. I will absolutely be back here - highly recommend for brunch!
2018-03-27,1,Was actually told by there wait staff to try other restaurants on the street... wait times were inaccurate; pretty much a free for all on a Saturday night. Actual quotes from management when attempting to communicate our poor experience:-  "Have you ever worked in the restaurant or hospitality industry before?"-  "There are many other people enjoying their meals this evening" -  " There are plenty of other restaurants on this street for you to try"Was pretty shocked any restaurant, especially in a competitive area would speak to their customers that way...Food was not worth the price & hassle
2018-03-22,5,Meal here was excellent. We had the Big Mac tartar, cauliflower fried rice, French onion Mac and cheese and s'mores dessert. Everything was excellent as was service.
2018-03-20,3,As a follow-up to my previous review, I decided to hold my birthday festivities at Union Hall and was easily able to secure a reservation for 8 people at 7:30 pm on a Saturday evening through OpenTable.  I arrived first and was able to grab our spacious table, while I waited for my friends.  Once everyone had arrived, we split up into groups, each ordering several plates to share.  My side troop of 4 went crazy and ordered a bunch of dishes.  The restaurant's signature Cauliflower "Fried Rice" included scallions, egg, sesame, and soy sauce - all flavor-enhancers that should have had more of an impact on this bland dish.  The crust of the Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese Flatbread tasted like processed dough you would find in a school cafeteria.  The toppings of mixed mushrooms, caramelized onions, goat cheese, and arugula were dried out, as if the whole pie had been previously frozen and re-baked.  The Crispy Calamari were so heavily fried that we could not taste the squid itself.  On a more positive note, we tried both brussels dishes on the menu as well.  The Crispy Brussels Sprouts had been fried with shallots and topped with almonds and capers.  They were salty, crunchy, and delicious.  The Brussels "Caesar" salad also included kale for a unique take on this traditional dish.  We enjoyed its cheesy, garlicky dressing, but, if we had to choose, we preferred the crispy sprout preparation.  Lastly, we all loved the gooey Parisian Disco Fries, which were decadently slathered with brown gravy, foie gras, and a trio of cheddar, jack, and mozzarella cheeses.  One of the other members of our larger party had bravely chosen the Cheese Plate, which included 3 unknown varieties, served with sliced apple, a fruit compote that we believed was fig, truffled honey nuts, and baguette slices.  As if I had not already tried enough items, I may have also cut myself a slice of one of the harder cheeses...which was fresh and flavorful.  Since it was my birthday, my friends surprised me with a candle inside of a chocolatey S'mores Cookie Skillet, which we all dug our spoons into, once I had made my wish.  I should also mention that the food took a very long time to arrive; so much so, in fact, that we were still eating two hours later when the second wave of my attendees started to arrive.  The restaurant was very laidback about these later guests pulling chairs up to the table, even though they were just planning to order drinks.  After we settled the bill, we were able to use one of their large tables in the lounge-area as a home base for our jackets, purses, etc.  The DJ had started by that point and was playing plenty of danceable tunes from the 90's and 2000's.  We had a great time jamming through the remaining hours, making sure we had drinks in our hands.  The beer, wine, liquor, and custom cocktail options were vast and all of stellar quality.  While the food was mediocre, the drinks, atmosphere, and large group accommodations made Union Hall the perfect spot for my celebration.  I wish they would start validating parking at the lot around the corner, which would likely boost their number of large party reservations even higher.  My review remains at 3.5 stars.
2018-03-11,5,Went with a group of 20 people for a birthday brunch. It was perfect! Everyone was happy with the menu variety and the option to get bottomless drinks with 4 small plates for only $24. The mimosas were huge and delicious. Fast service for our large table and a fun atmosphere.
2018-03-10,4,Came here yesterday for lunch and was pleasantly surprised all-around.We ordered wine and sangria, all of which we liked. Then, we decided to order a bunch of small plates for the table. We realized afterwards that we had ordered too much for three of us but I'm glad we got to try a bunch of different plates. We had the French onion soup Mac and cheese bites (absolutely delicious, especially with the dipping sauce), the cauliflower fried rice (loved this!), two of the sliders (both good), the calamari, French fries, and the oven roasted tomato flatbread. The only thing we didn't like was the flatbread, which tasted like a frozen pizza at best. However, everything else was amazing! Francis was our server and he was very attentive. The view is also great, as you are on the waterfront on Sinatra Drive. I would love to come back for their happy hour or for dinner to try some more of their dishes!
2018-02-25,3,We went without reservations and were seated promptly.   The view of NYC is awesome an added plus but the acoustics in dining room makes you feel like you are at a sporting event.   You can barely hear the person next to you.    Service was  great when we got our order in but then as meal went on we had to seek out our waiter. There is a Sunday brunch special: $24 for 4course and unfinishable mega "ball jar" of normal brunch alcohol niceties which looked awesome at other tables but we chose to go a la carte with salmon toast, avocado toast, burgers, flatbread and lobster rolls.    Toasts were great, burgers were messy but very good.    Over all food was above average but noise and service takes the marks down.Food: 7 Decor: 5 (stadium noise hurts) Service: 5 Would I return again: 63pct.
2018-02-24,2,They have OK food but it's all very greasy and very fried. Prepare to feel awful after for a while :/
2018-02-13,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5. Beef tartare was refreshing with the special sauce adding a nice hint of sweetness and creamy texture. Cauliflower "fried rice" was very interesting in that the texture really did mimic fried rice. However, being all vegetable there was a lot of excess liquid; a little too wet for a proper stir fry. The chimichurri hanger steak was also a treat for texture lovers as the crispy onions, seared steak and soft roasted vegetables made for a great combination. Steak was cooked to the desired medium rare. A nice sauce would have been nicer than the compound butter and the brioche at the bottom seemed unnecessary. Churro sundae was sweet and soft.Service - 4/5. Friendly and courteous. The dishes came out in good sequential order.Value - 5/5. A delicious and unique four course dining experience for only $29? One of the best restaurant week deals by far.Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-02-03,4,Brunch deal is absolutely fantastic! Definitely got my money's worth! Service was good and bartenders are super friendly! Definitely recommend! $2 house draft beer! It's pretty tasty too!
2018-02-02,5,Definitely my go-to place in Hoboken. The wine selection is incredible and the knowledge the servers have is amazing. They're able to pair foods to wines so well. Lea was such a great and personable server. Kept checking up on us to make sure we were okay. The food like the tartare and the bone marrow are beyond amazing. Their entire menu is perfect! The shrimp cocktail could use more for the price however but everything else was perfect!
2018-02-01,5,Have eaten dinner here with a large group twice, had drinks here many times and now ordered delivery a few times and have nothing but great things to say. I've lived in Hoboken for over 10 years and have always had trouble finding good spots for delivery that are solid food and quick turn around and this is it. Food is great, delivery time was speedy and everything came hot. The actual space is beautiful as well and a good place for early to mid 30s to get a drink in a non crowded bar. Staff is all super friendly as well!
2018-01-30,3,My wife and I came for Hudson restaraunt week.  First off all, the service was great.  Our waitress was attentive.  She filled waters and cleaned off the table several times.  She was great.  She was not too intrusive, but was very attentive.So the food was overall good.  We started out with deviled eggs and beef tar tar.  I really enjoyed the deviled eggs.  The beef tar tar was good as well.  Second was cauliflower fried rice with pork belly and the brussel ceaser salad.  I was a little confused as to why the brussel caeser was a ceaser at all.  There was a lemon type vinegarrette and some cheese, but nothing to say ceaser.  I actually really enjoyed it, but my wife wanted a ceaser type salad.  The cauliflower fried rice with pork belly was also enjoyable.  I know everyone is getting creative with cauliflower, but it was just an ok dish.  It was probably a good substitute cauliflower dish, but I'm not too experienced in that area of food.Lastly was a chimichurri hanger steak on a bun and seared salmon dish.  Sadly, I would say I was pretty positive about the meal until now, but the entrees were just the definition of average to below average.  For the hander steak, it was good, but a little over salted.  I think the saltiness of the steak was fine, but then eaten all together with the other parts was just too much salt.  Lastly, I totally forgot it was chimichurri until I looked back at this review.  Where was the sauce?  The seared salmon dish was just incredibly confusing.  The salmon was rare, but it was cold on the inside.  I would describe it more as a seared tar tar, not a rare temp.  Lastly, whatever bed of mashed thing it was laying was not good.  Together everything about that dish was a confusing taste.  It really brought the dish down even more.  The salmon alone was ok, but I imagine it was all suppose to go together.Lastly, were the desserts.  The churro sunday and the donuts were good.  Pretty standard quality of a dessert.The decor and feel of the place was great.  It would seem like a cool place to hang out late at night.Restaraunt week is suppose to showcase their food.  Usually, Union Hall is small plates.  Maybe they would excel better at that, but if you are going to do RW, then you should really be good at it.
2018-01-26,5,Love this place. Says a lot because I'm in weehawken and have ordered delivery 4 times. Not your typical hoboken food. Creative, thoughtful, fresh and delicious. Delivery comes with a smile. Food is carefully prepared. Highly recommend poke tuna, truffle egg flatbread and lobster roll slider. Union hall, please stay.  You're a welcome and much needed presence for the better hudson county palate!
2018-01-26,3,Had never been and tried for Restaurant Week. Was on the more crowded side for a Thursday but to be expected. Everyone was nice but it felt like they were missing some key processes. We ordered the complementary wine pairings (4 glasses - one for each course) plus a drink, initially, to have while waiting for food. The order came as follows (party of 4): 3 of us received pairings #1, 1 of us received initial drink #1, 1 of us received pairing #2, all of us received apps, 3 of us received pairing #2 and poor person receives initial drink and pairing #1, first course came out for all and one order was off, we started ordering drinks ad hoc because pairings were so unreliable and some of us had three in front of us while others were finishing off a single 3oz pour. One entre was wrong, one entre ordered medium well came rare, one dessert came out wrong, 3 meals they took our silverware while clearing so we couldn't eat next course. I came for the company, which was great, and it was such a sweet location with a view that I'd consider going again, but probably not for a while. Not the typical Restaurant Week experience you expect as I've been going for 6+ years to new spots and always feel like restaurants use the time to promote signature dishes and great service and this fell a bit flat. Regarding food, was OK. Not bad (once orders were straightened out), but definitely not so great its worth having botched orders show up out of order.
2018-01-20,5,Brandon was our bartender server and he is really awesome! He has a great personality, he recommended some great drinks and grub for us to try out and made sure we had everything we needed! He's helped us out twice now on separate occasions and it's really nice when someone remembers you.
2018-01-13,5,First time here and I can't wait to come back again! The food is super innovative and I was beyond impressed. I came here on a Saturday for the dinner menu and the options were endless. I ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts,  truffle deviled egg, and the Cauliflower rice.  The  flavors were absolutely incredible. My boyfriend got the bone marrow, bloody Mary shrimp, and dorito fried shrimp and he said it was out of this world amazing. The service was amazing and the servers were knowledgeable of the menu and were able to answer all of our questions since it was our first time.The brunch menu looks bomb and I cannot wait to come back and check it out. Thank you Hoboken for adding this gem!!!
2018-01-11,4,This place is alright. The bartenders are nice and they're super funny. Crysta is my favorite. She always makes it an enjoyable experience.
2017-12-29,4,I definitely recommend this place. Good food, nice views, nice ambiance. Bacon, egg and cheese flat bread is a must. I think they could lose the doughnuts from the dessert menu, but the churro Sunday was great. Will definitely go back.
2017-12-08,4,I came here with a group for brunch on a Saturday. They were very accommodating, the $2 or$3 mimosas were really good ;-) The decor is pretty cool. My kind of style. I ordered the UH Benny Skillet and the chicken and waffle dogs which I enjoyed. I give them 4 stars because two people in our party ordered the burger and it was way undercooked. Other than that, I recommend it!
2017-12-06,4,Cute place right on the water and not too expensive! Most of the menu is small plates which you order several of and share with the table but I just got my own. I ordered the mushroom and goat cheese flat bread which was amazing. I also had a piece of the tomato and cheese flatbread which was good but a lot crispier than mine. I also ordered the mini churro sundae for dessert which was one of the best desserts that I ever had! It was vanilla ice cream in a small churro cup with chocolate drizzle SO GOOD I could definitely see myself returning
2017-12-05,4,With a name like Union Hall, I was expecting something slightly divey like most "Hall" type bars.  I was pleasantly surprised to be wrong when I arrived here for a colleague's farewell happy hour. It was appropriately dimly lit with simple accents. The bartender set us up at a long table and was extremely attentive as the crowd trickled in. We ordered a spread of appetizers and while I didn't taste them all, I highly recommend the meat/cheese board, French friends and hummus. The mini pizzas also looked really good but I can't vouch for them...yet I'll definitely be back to check out lunch and hope it's as goof as the appetizers!
2017-12-03,4,Came here for their brunch as it was very empty but seemed like a nice place. They offer $2 mimosa/ $3 bloody Mary. I couldn't pass that up. Our waiter was very nice and attentive. One thing to note about this place is that they offer a lot of small plates, not regular sized entrees as most other places. Think of it as a lot of appetizers that can be shared. I went with my partner and ordered the 4 breakfast tacos, chicken & waffles, and benny skillet. All of it was very good and I'd recommend them all. We left full and happy. It is a little pricey but worth the splurge imo. With their cheap drinks, great view of NYC, delicious food this is a place that I'll be returning to in the Hoboken area.
2017-11-20,5,Great place with an amazing menu and a very fun atmosphere. I have tried 50% of the menu and nothing disappointed me and their beef tartar I can eat every time I'm there. Staff is friendly and helpful. Prices are lower than in most of the places in Hoboken. Totally recommend.
2017-11-08,5,Went here on Monday night for dinner and loved it! They have an awesome happy hour special on Oysters and their "Union Brew" is only $2 all day everyday. As mentioned the menu is mainly comprised of small plates. There were 2 of us and we ordered 5 plates which was more than enough! The only piece of advice that I would offer is to use less salt in the calamari batter. Other than that, everything including the service was wonderful and the prices are great considering the quality!  We will definitely be back!
2017-11-06,4,Awesome location and love how the windows open to allow the nice breeze to come in. Great on a nice summer/fall evening.Didn't get to try the food but seems like the drinks were a little pricey for hoboken. It is a classy place though. I look forward to try the food.
2017-11-05,4,Randomly found myself here on a Saturday for some college football, beer, and brunch. Let's start off my saying this place has some of the best deals for drinks in Hoboken for brunch. $1 beer mugs, $2 mimosa / Bloody Mary's. Most dishes around +/- $10, which is also excellent for Hoboken, and eve more so on the waterfront. What surprised me here was how good and interesting the food was, while still being really cheap as well. The chicken and waffle are basically chicken in a waffle made in the shape of a corn dog with a maple dipping sauce. I loved this. The bacon and egg flatbread with truffle was equally awesome, with thick diced bacon and a nice truffle flavor. Even the salad was excellent. Considering the amount of food we ordered and drinks we had, the bill for 4 adults and 2 children with a lot of food and a lot of drink came well under $100, including tax and tip. This place is one of the best deals in Hoboken, and actually has quality, interesting food. I'm adding this to the regular rotation.
2017-10-30,5,This is my favorite spot for brunch - $2 Mimosas and $3 Bloody Mary's.  I've run through most of their menu and the only thing I am not crazy about are their flat breads (too heavy and not soft enough).  I always receive great service while I'm there and fulfills my brunch needs!
2017-10-28,3,This is a huge place that serves small plates and never seems all that crowded.  Which is why the indifferent service seems odd as there was 2 bartenders and 4-6 customers and they would rather chat with each other than the customers.They have a good beer selection and food was okay  and space is nice.  If service were better could see this being 4 stars.  My house blood Mary was okay though weak.
2017-10-22,2,I've visited Union Hall once before my dining experience tonight. My time spent previously at the bar was mediocre although the bartender was pleasant and friendly. My evening was spent with my brother and parents. We all ordered a variation of items from the menu including some of the waiter's suggestions, which frankly should have been kept to himself. The waiter may have been new and the service was terrible. We only received one refill of the water vase before having to track him down and ask for more. All of the waitstaff that night we're very cold and there was no greeting upon entry nor exit of our meal.While the menu read appetizing (I'm biased because it's very pork belly based) food was not worth the trip. Very overpriced for the quality of our meal. I would not return for food but the atmosphere is pleasant enough to return for drinks for a nice cool evening by the water.
2017-10-22,5,This place was really great for Sunday brunch. The plates were delicious and well-priced. (We came in starving and shared 4 small plates and left happy and full). The $2 mimosas and $3 bloody Mary's are well-poured and tasty. To top it off, the staff--from the hostess to the manager to the servers--were attentive and friendly. Really happy we stumbled on this place instead of Halifax or the Ainstead (really grumpy hostesses).
2017-10-08,4,Food and service was great! The chicken and waffle small plate was delish and can't go wrong with $2 mimosas and $3 bloody Mary's.
2017-10-08,5,My girlfriend and I were looking to grab a bite to eat, and since I am pregnant I saw a picture of their deserts online and was sold on giving it a try. We were pleasantly surprise in the quality of the dishes and the great service and staff. The prices match perfect with the quantity and quality of food! I love the fact that I can go get a personal (true sized) portion desert for only 3 dollars and be 100% satisfied. I took my family their the next night:)
2017-10-08,3,Newish spot on hoboken waterfront. Stopped in for Friday happy hour. They have specials on wine and beer. The space is large with a cool indoor bar and then ample patio seating. We must've gotten there right when they were opening, no hostess around to seat us. Stood a bit awkwardly for a few and some that looked like a manager told us to sit wherever. We grabbed a spot out front. Our server was friendly, but was soft spoken and mumbled his words. So was hard to understand some of the specials he told us about. He also explained the concept of the place, essentially tapas style and everything Is suggested to share. We ordered drinks and apps. For food we had the cauliflower fried rice, the hot chicken, and French onion mac n cheese bites. Chicken was disappointing. More like some type of chicken nugget with no heat served in a waffle cone bowl. Definitely recommend the cauliflower fried rice. But, also felt like it was something I could replicate at home. I'd come back here for the beautiful waterfront view.
2017-10-07,1,We went on a Saturday night and we were seated and served right away. Staff was very nice. Food was not good, huge disappointment. The gnocchi tasted like it had chef boy ar dee sauce on it, the French onion mac and cheese balls had zero flavor (I don't even know how that's possible). The scallops also had no flavor and the toast it was served on was not good either.  The octopus was okay. Overall we were literally in and out in about 20 mins and it cost us $75. We would never go back.
2017-10-07,4,This place was amazing! GIA is the best waitress. She is prepared and knows her stuff. She's full of the best recommendations and she's quick. Everything you look for in a waitress.. she's got it! The food was great as well. Small plates so you can share :)
2017-10-02,2,Pretty mediocre experience at Union Hall. Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday - we were seated right away and the place is very aesthetically pleasing. They open the front windows, you get a view of the water, and they had Sunday football on. We were drawn in by the $2 mimosa and $3 Bloody Mary. Drinks were okay, worth the $2 and $3 bucks. Food was meh. Small plates and prices were what you'd expect. Lobster bun was dry and didn't taste fresh, bread was a little stale. Breakfast taco was decent. Eggs Benedict were actually over seasoned for such a small plate. Worst of all was the avocado toast - didn't even finish it. Bread was so stale and soggy it couldn't be cut with the knife on the table. Not only was the toast stale but the avocado was bland and topped with like 6 tomatoes minimal salt and pepper. Seemingly easy dishes they failed miserably at getting right. Our service was okay in the beginning - waiter actually did a very good job of explaining the menu, prices and sizes. After that he was scarce. Maybe this would be more of a place to stop in for a drink but deff would not come here for food again.
2017-09-23,5,Great food, great service, great prices, great view - what more could you want? My two friends and I ordered the chicken meetballs, cauliflower rice, the kale Brussels Caesar salad, and a tomato flatbread . Everything was delicious and came out really quickly. It's tapas style so the portions were small and meant to be shared. We got all of that plus 3 cocktails for only $75. Our waiter was so friendly and helpful too, he could tell my friend didn't like her drink and immediately fetched another- no questions asked. Great place for girls and guys and the menu is atypical without being pretentious. Definitely give it a go!
2017-09-21,1,I can only comment regarding the service because I unfortunately wasn't given an opportunity to try any of their cocktails or food. I recently came here durning a beautiful day to grab lunch with my 4yr old daughter after biking around the city. I told the hostess I would like to sit outside if possible, there was an empty 4 top and a dirty two top table out there, she looked at me with hesitation, as if she couldn't, aka she didn't want to sit 1 adult and 1 small child at a table that could potentially hold 4 adults, and a much higher bill, which I understand, I told her I would wait for the 2 top to get cleaned. She said it was fine and sat us. I sat and read the menu for a good ten minutes, no one greeted us, no one even looked at us. Mind you, the tables on either side of me were both being served intently by a female server clearly in charge of the patio. She literally walked past us about 5 times, checking on her tables. It wasn't until I saw this numerous times that I was sure she was my server as well so gestured to her with a look of, "can you help me?". She finally came over and asked if anyone has helped me...what?! Obviously not, I've been here over 10 min, which you know I'm sure, and don't even have water!! But I kindly said, "not yet" and her response was, "ok I'll be right back with you". You're joking right? Right back with me? I was ready to give my drink order and food order right then and there. She strolled past me, and I mean STROLLED, aka in ZERO hurry, at least 3 more times checking her tables around me. That's when I realized she wanted me to leave, she clearly didn't want myself and my young daughter at her table. I got up and left and brought my business next door to the Ainsworth, where I got exceptional food and SERVICE. We waited 20 minutes. 20 full minutes. I was blatantly ignored. It's not that I was mad, I was more hurt and disappointed that someone would treat someone so poorly and disrespectful just bc they assumed. I'm a server myself and little did she know I would've tipped her handsomely. Don't ever look at people and assume. I would never treat my guests in this manner. The owner needs to reevaluate his staff and/or his training procedures. Very bad for business, embarrassing actually.
2017-09-21,3,Came in for small plates a few weeks ago. Nice makeover from the old Trinity spot.  Food and drinks were good to average. Service was a somewhat slow for such a quiet hour(seemed like an after dinner lull at least on the floor, bartenders/servers chatting with a specific group or customer for a good chunk of time, etc). I heard the owner/manager fools around w some of the female staff so maybe that's part of it but I figured that sort of thing happens in the food/bar industry all the time.  There's a good draft and wine list. Food wise we split octopus(mostly fine, a couple killed and rubbery pieces), French onion soup Mac and cheese bites(good, would be even better in the winter!), and a flatbread breakfast sort of pizza(decent).
2017-09-20,2,Was trying to have lunch at the W Hotel but they were fully booked until 3:35pm o.ODecided to roam around the waterfront looking for better options. Went into 2 restaurants, looked at their menus, and decided to try out Union Hall! Outside seats are first come, first serve. Luckily a group just left so we didn't have to wait too long for a table.Everything here is served tapas style so it's good to come with a group so you can try a bunch of different stuff. We had a group of 4 people and the waitress suggested we order 5 dishes to share. We ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes, avocado toast, smoked salmon toast, pigs & peach flatbread, and 2 orders of chicken & waffle dogs (as recommended by the waitress).Cinnamon roll pancakes - they were..okay...Avocado Toast - only came with 1 toast so was kind of hard to share with 4 peopleSmoked Salmon Toast - same as avocado toast (also the bread they used was kind of hard and made it difficult to cut and share)Pigs & Peach flatbread - the flatbread was REALLY hardChicken & Waffle dogs - the waffle was AMAZING (smelled good, tasted good) but the "chicken" part of it... not so much... it didn't even look or taste like chicken... odd..I also ordered the fresh pressed juice - small glass but tasted extra healthy!
2017-09-17,3,The server was very friendly and attentive, but the food was underwhelming. First, We ordered a beer that took almost 30 minutes to come out and was warm when it did come out. The "hot chicken" was the biggest disappointment. It should not be called that. It tastes nothing like hot chicken. It tastes more like a hush puppy. I liked the ambiance and location, but the menu could still use some work. For the price I expected more.
2017-09-14,3,Get your drink and dance onA group of us stopped by this place on a Friday night around 10 pm, so I guess Union Hall has two faces - a restaurant that converts to a lounge/club. If I were still in my 20's, then this place would be perfect for getting your buzz on before hopping onto the Path Train and heading into the Manhattan. I will say that the club/lounge vibe was kind of cool. The music was a loud mix of today's tunes and late 90s/early 00s hits. The drinks were pretty standard. Maybe Union Hall has are fun cocktails, but I am more of a gin and soda type of guy when I'm out and about. The bar clientele looks very similar to the types that hang out in the Meatpacking District.
2017-09-12,4,This is a great addition to the waterfront options in Hoboken. Two of us shared a half a dozen oysters (fresh from Maine), the truffled scallop toast, the pig and peach flatbread, and french onion mac and cheese balls, all of which were incredibly delicious!We had half priced house wine and beer which were great, and nice size pours.The only thing we didn't love was the oreo cheesecake pop. I love the fact that they have bite size desserts though, for only a couple of bucks each, so we'll try a different one next time!
2017-09-11,5,Incredible ambiance and great food and great service! Happy to add this to the rotation of Hoboken bars.
2017-09-10,4,2nd Time here, first time for dinner. Did learn that their chef has won a TV Chef competition for what that is worth. Lover Roll last time was exquisite; this time bread was a bit dry. Also had oysters, then Gnocchi and Muttz pasta. Both excellent. No Internet !!  What pricey restaurant doesn't offer internet ???Gnocchi is made in house and is scrumptious. 4 points; Would be 5 if Lovster Roll Bread was better; it is pricey for what you get. And no Internet for what you are paying.Follow-Up:Recommend you don't come after kitchen closes. Late night Bartender spent time flirting with young guys; despite yelling from where I sat had to walk over to get service and later to get the bill. Also when in bathroom kitchen staff ran in to use and ran out without washing hands. NOT COOL.
2017-09-10,5,Great view. Outdoor seating is perfect (dog friendly).  Cocktails are great. Service is great. Very happy overall.... Also, I don't think this place should have three dollar signs $$$... more like 2. Very affordable- especially for the location and quality
2017-09-10,3,A new addition to the revolving door of restaurants on this block.  Good concept - small plates - and nice open feel inside.  Service was very slow.  Food was mostly good.  Some great, some average.  Not particularly kid friendly.  Has potential, will give it another go.
2017-09-03,5,The KOBE BEEF BURGER will rock your world. Christa, the bar tender, is really nice.
2017-08-23,3,The menu has a nice variety and they have really great drink specials. The service was pretty slow, especially for a Wednesday night. We also had to remind our waitress for food items and drinks several times. Even though we had a reservation for 7pm, we were still told that we would have to wait because there were people on the list ahead of us. It wasn't a problem since we were sitting at some bar stools, but I'd be hesitant to come on the weekend. Overall it's worth a try but I'm not sure how often I'd come back.
2017-08-20,5,Went for dinner the other night and enjoyed everything. You can not beat the location with views of NYC from the outdoor tables. Food was great and a welcomed change from the typical hoboken sports bar. They specialize in small plates which makes it the perfect spot to bring a date. You can spend hours going through several courses all while enjoying a good selection of seasonal drinks.
2017-08-20,4,I came here with some friends for dinner and drinks.  We ate outside.   The view was great.  Outdoor seating is open until 11:30PM.Fancy food, fancy drinks, fancy atmosphere, great view, and friendly service make this a great evening.  There are lots of small tapas plates on the menu to share with everyone at the table if that's your style.  Share share, it's only fair!The French onion mac and cheese bites come with the French onion reduction on the side.  Its your choice to dump it over the mac and cheese or dip them in.  There are plenty of flatbreads to satisfy everyone at the table and certainly create a nice discussion about what to order. Overall a great experience.  I will come back to try more items from the menu.
2017-08-18,1,I genuinely do not understand how anyone can taste this food and like it. I feel bad since the staff was nice, but this meal was literally dog food.
2017-08-17,5,Came here after work for some drinks and small appetizers with a friend - amazing food, and service!! Elijah, our server, was super attentive and gave great recommendations. Highly recommend the cauliflower fried rice and the black eye pea hummus!!
2017-08-15,2,Super disappointed. Waited for this place to open after seeing owner on Chopped. We had the Peaches and Pork flatbread which came recommended-pretty awful not a cohesive dish at all. Hot chicken was like a bad nugget from mcdonalds. French fries were good tho. Also took 20 minutes for a beer. Staff was very nice, probably wont return
2017-08-03,4,They must have the best Happy Hour in Hoboken!  They have an interesting selection of draft beer for only $3! If you go for the house beer, it's only $2!!! Also, $1 Oysters!I haven't tried the food yet, but I'm told they're owned by the same people as The Stewed Cow. If that's the case, they probably have a great menu and delicious food. There's no doubt that I will be venturing in there again!
2017-07-30,3,Love the location. Sitting outside looking at the water on a summer day is lovely. The food was average and over priced. It's "small plates". $80+ for 3 glasses of rose, a small jar of hummus, a salad, 3 sliders, a cheese platter (3 tiny pieces of cheese, 6 pieces of bread w Apple slices) and a half a piece of toast w 1 scallop. There were three of us eating and I left hungry.
2017-07-28,3,We came here opening week and the place looks a little different from the old Trinity, but I feel like it's still pretty similar. The food was good, I Loved the mixed slider trio appetizer. But I have to say, the service was SLOW. So slow that it took 2 1/2 hours for our whole meal (apps, dinner & dessert). I think that's a bit too long, but I think it's because it was their opening week. Hope they work out the kinks by my next visit! This restaurant definitely has potential.
2017-07-27,2,Note: I am a professional in the hospitality industry working with renown chefs and restaurants. I also primarily handle PR for restaurant openings in the city. I finally made it into Union Hall, excited to check out the newest spot on the waterfront. My initial thought was disappointment. The restaurant was empty for a Wednesday, but they were so short-staffed it was still a 15-20 minute way for one of the many seats available. I understand that they can't sit you 'just anywhere' because you need to be waited on and lack of staff will make that difficult -- so we sat at the bar for quicker service.Ordered a 902, excited to see a local beer on tap, but it took another 15 minutes to get a pint that wasn't mostly foam. The bartender was kind enough to offer me the drink for free, knowing the long wait, but when I finally received the beer it was flat. We ordered the below and my notes are next to each:- Veggie Gyro Sliders - lacked flavor and the patty was so small it was only in the last bite. - Lobster slider - where was the lobster? It was mostly celery with a hint of lobster, and actually tasted more like a tuna sandwich than lobster. Also the bun wasn't seasoned at all... maybe a quick brush of butter would have helped? - Grilled Octopus - the only good thing we ate, but not enough octopus for the price. It came with two pieces on a bed of cucumber salad. The dish itself needed more acid - maybe some lemon? But the two pieces were uneven so if sharing this with someone, one would get a nice large piece and another would get a toothpick sized piece. - Cauliflower Fried Rice - my guests enjoyed this dish, but all i tasted was soy sauce. It was one-note without any other flavors... just soy sauce. All soy sauce. I'd rather make something better at home.- French fries - for $6 you'd think you would get a nice big pile of french fries. What we received was a tiny basket filled with stick fries, similar to McDonald's small size fry. It was a bit upsetting to see such a tiny little serving of that style fry for so much money.Overall the staff was VERY kind and efficient, but the food itself was severely lacking flavor. I won't be returning.
2017-07-20,5,So impressed considering they are new! Fantastic food. Great taste, fun combinations, good portion size (for small plates). Lots of food options for all different palates. Service was fantastic too! As far as Hoboken restaurants go, it's a keeper!! We had the Brussels sprout salad, truffle bacon egg and cheese flat bread, hot chicken and waffles and the onion soup mac and cheese bites. For desert we had the churro sundae and milk shake of the day :) Everything was hot, fresh and great quality! I was skeptical about another bar type place in Hobo (b/c let's be honest that's the last thing that hoboken needs) but this was totally different! Great price too! Often with small plate type places you leave hungry and feel like you spent a ton. Will def go back!
2017-07-20,4,Warm summer night on the patio w nice server, owner, bartenders and good food. Favorite of the night was the shaved Brussels sprouts salad that had some baby kale and delicious dressing. Grilled octopus perfectly cooked. Lobster bun tasty but skimpy. Amazing happy hour specials. Really enjoyed our $5 Moscow mules.
2017-07-19,5,Eeeeek! New favorite spot. If I didn't think it would be weird if I went back again tonight after just being here last night I would be there in a second . They have a great happy hour and each day of the week they have different specials after the happy hour ends which is awesome. I'm a wine snob. I always like to try a restaurants house wine because it says a lot about them. It's easy to find a good expensive wine. It's hard to find a good wine with a good price--and their house Pinot Grigio was SO good! (Also try their wine punches mmmm). And I digress...onto ambience and food. First: our waiter Chris was awesome. Super friendly and sociable. Willing to take the time to explain the idea of the restaurant and give us some suggestions. We too pretty much all his suggestions and they were soooo good! This restaurant is a small plate/sharing type spot which I love so if you aren't into that this isn't your place. I highly recommended the cheese board, Olives, oysters ($1 during happy hour), Brussels sprout Caesar salad, French onion mac and cheese bites (but you need to drizzle the French onion reduction on top/dip them in it- delish and a big part of the dish), the gnocchi and mutz (not up to par with a good Italian restaurant gnocchi but still good), and last but not least (and my personal FAV) the peach and pig flatbread...drooling just thinking about it . Was too full to try and dessert but I will most definitely be back and i will be trying plenty of them!! Honestly they just opened 2 weeks ago and I can't believe how great everything last night was. My only suggestion: let dogs find outside! I mean they kind of do. The dogs have to be on the outside of the fence which is fine. But they said it was because they served food but hey the ainsworth and house of que both let the dogs inside the outdoor eating area so not sure if that's an actual rule! But regardless will definitely be back!
2017-07-17,4,Delicious food creative and incredibly fairly priced. Vanessa was attentive and knowledgeable about the restaurant. Friendly service. Would be 5 starts but crostino were soft in the center.
2017-07-17,2,I will be honest, I saw the chef on chopped and was excited for this place to open. We yelped the place prior to settling but I thought regardless I wanted to try it.The place is really cute inside. The staff was very nice. I know the place is really new so I am hoping they get it together after a little while and I hoping this yelp review is used as constructive criticism. I sat at the table and it took 25 minutes for the waiter to ask if we wanted a water or a drink. When we asked for water and drinks, it took another 20 minutes to come to us. After 45 minutes we were asked to order. Our waiter was very nice but you could tell extremely inexperienced. Our overall time being at that restaurant was 2 1/2 hours. The menu is VERY limited and they say it is meant to share however, the portions are small. What I Ordered:House Cabernet: I am a wine snob and the house cab was not too bad. Olives: no complaints. Good amount of olives for two maybe even three people. Tomato Flatbread: It was forgotten about but at the end I asked for it because I was hoping to have something else I really enjoyed. Underwhelming. Not bad but not great. Tomatoes on the top were not really cooked. They could've been a little more cooked and  could've used salt.Shrimp and Grits: Good. Enjoyed this. The shrimp was cold but I think it is supposed to be I just wasn't expecting it. Grits were really good.French Onion Soup Mac and Cheese bites: Again, not bad, not great. Needed a little more salt.Gnocchi w/Tomato Sauce: Not bad. The best meal I had there. I would recommend it.Hot Tamale Dumplings: They were not dumplings. I am not really sure what they were. I had to send it back and I NEVER send my food back however, this was inedible. Recommend either taking it off the menu or re-evaluating the taste.Scallop Toast w/mushrooms: Does not look like the pictures that were taken. I presume they were probably professional pictures. It's only one per order so if you have two people order two (one each). It was good however, it is mushroom paste, I would recommend chunks of mushroom like a bruschetta instead. I had to send one back because one was extremely undercooked and cold in the middle. I was so turned off that I didn't even want them to take it back and cook it more. Dessert:Berry Crumble: Not bad, not good. There was not enough  crumble and it was more like a berry soup. The crumble that was there was more like oatmeal. Jelly Doughnuts: I would NOT recommend. It was dough and not even fried. It felt like eating a sponge. There was no jelly in it. The jelly is drizzled on it. Overall experience: Extremely disappointed in the food. Hopefully changes are made and the food on the menu is re-vamped and service improves.
2017-07-17,2,This place will not make it a year if they don't work things out. Stopped by for their "Tapas" style brunch this past Sunday. Strike 1: Walked in, the hostess was nowhere to be found. Strike 2: They were "out" of a number of things and the waitress didn't know what was stocked behind the bar. Had to check twice for what kind of bottled ciders they carried. Then, she forgot a drink. Strike 3: The food was cold, lackluster and inconstant. They brought out our "pancakes" first and the rest of the food didn't show up until 20 minutes later. Really quite bizarre. Also, we were informed that the kitchen "had to close" for 30 minutes so we wouldn't be able to order anything else. That doesn't really help their "tapas" concept considering you don't always order all of your food at once. Overall, seems like they really weren't ready to open. Giving 2 stars for a good concept and decor. But definitely won't be back.
2017-07-15,4,Joe was our server. Very attentive and helped to explain the menu to us as we were not expecting this to be a tapas restaurant. The food was great, atmosphere was very lively, and would definitely recommend this place to others. Also, can never complain about $2 all day beers.
2017-07-14,4,All the kinks have been worked out. Sat at the bar for lunch and had Vanessa as my bartender.  I appreciated her food and drink recommendations.  Very helpful. I love smaller portion sizes like they have so I can try different things.  The cauliflower "fried" rice is so good.  And the burger was cooked to our liking.  I'll be back with friends.
2017-07-11,3,We went this past Sunday and I have to say food was very bland. From the brussel sprouts salad, to the flat bread to the ice water without ice cubes I was let down by the quality of the food. The waiter was nice but things took a long while to show up. We also had to change tables because the AC air through the vents was so strong it was very uncomfortable to eat in those conditions. All and all not impressed.
2017-07-11,2,Food is mediocre but what's worse is the service. If you're ok waiting 45 minutes in between tiny beers then this is your spot.
2017-07-10,4,Good food. Service is slow but friendly. Oh, btw, here's the menu that isn't anywhere else on the web.
2017-07-10,5,We had a team outing at Union Hall tonight for dinner & drinks and everyone loved it. Great environment, delicious food, good cocktail list and phenomenal service! We first had a team meeting outside on the comfy lounge chairs with drinks and shifted inside for the dinner. Hoboken needed this addition! Interesting menu with shared plates. Perfect for a date night, after work happy hour or night out with friends. It was over a great experience and can't wait to go back!
2017-07-10,3,This place is kind of a mess but you can tell they're trying.  Will give 3-stars for now and try it again after giving them some time to work out the kinks.Everybody was very nice and apologized over and over when the credit card machines went down... and then the reservation system went down.  Now you would think there would be a backup but apparently not.  So the good - nice beer and liquor list.  They brought in some bartenders from around town that you'll recognize and be happy to see. Good views of the city.Not so good - the food was generally pretty meh.  Gnocchi consistency was off, pork belly was dry.  Wings were pretty solid but only got 2 for like 12 bucks... Speaking of prices, 8 dollar beers generally.. not epically high but they need to get their shit together if they want to charge that.So kind of a mixed bag the first time out.  I'll try it again but no need for a special trip.
2017-07-10,3,I understand it's new but definitely not ready to open and service customers. Took 45 minutes to get hummus, unacceptable. We saw our drinks ready at the bar but our waitress didn't pick them up for 15 minutes. The food was okay, nothing to rave home about. The hummus was the best part, which I would hope if it took 45 minutes ....They need to figure out the issues with their service and then I might consider going back for food. Otherwise I'll go back for drinks because they were the reason I would give 3 stars. Get the Italian punch.
2017-07-09,5,Loved it! They have an innovative food and cocktail menu and their staff is very welcoming. Amazing atmosphere and a beautiful industrial interior design! It is definitely the nicest restaurant on the waterfront because of their delivery with their food and atmosphere alone...It's  authentic atmosphere, great service and limitless wine, beer and  spirt list is hard to find in hoboken but the union hall nailed it! They have themselves a regular.
2017-07-09,1,Was excited to check this place out but to our surprise was rudely treated for just grabbing a menu and reviewing it.    Yelp said it opened at 11 am.  We walked in and they were still setting up by 11:05 am.  No one greeted us so we thought we would review their menu as we waited to be greeted.    We sat down at one of their outside tables and a not so gentleman came out and with an angry tone asked if we just grabbed a menu as if  we took his son's candy or something.   He then continues to lecture us on how we cannot sit there because they are not open and we cannot just grab a menu.    We just left church, truly enjoying our Sunday and looking forward to this new establishment.    This guy clearly was not having a great morning to talk to potentially new customers as he did.     I hope he treats others better if he wants his business to be successful.  Why can't people just be nice?
2017-07-07,1,I was super excited to try this place out but after being completely ignored by multiple staff members myself & the 3 other people I was with brought our business to the Ainsworth next door. There was 3 open tables outside (where we wanted to sit) around 6pm on a Monday night- we stood at the host desk for legit 60 seconds before the guy who had his head down the ENTIRE time on the iPad even looked up to greet us (hello this is a brand new place do they not care about first impressions?) I asked if we could sit outside he said "uh, idk those are reserved for the evening" so I said ok so can we sit at the communal tables & be served there if we wanted some apps & cocktails. He said 'yea I guess so' ? So we went to the communal tables, sat there for another 5 minutes- continued to be ignored, went to the bar, but the bartenders conversations with each other were more important than the $ they could have made off 4 people. My advice check out the Ainsworth next door, they're way more accommodating
2017-07-05,5,Outstanding!  The menu is creative and the food is great.  With small plates you can try more than one thing and share too.  Cocktails are awesome.  Jay and Brendan are great!
2017-07-05,5,My favorite new spot in Hoboken. The bar is huge and has a great selection - especially the $2 Union brews! The food is also awesome. My favorite dish so far was definitely the meatballs. I'll be coming back soon to try out the rest of the menu!
2017-07-04,5,My new favorite burger in Hoboken!  Super laid back outdoor dining in a beer hall setting facing the Hudson River and Manhattan skyline.  I had a wonderful experience here on the 4th of July.  My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to grab dinner before the fireworks and came over to Union Hall.  Dave, one of the owners immediately came over to greet us and personally seat us along with the hostess outside at the table of our choice.  Dave also returned when we were ordering to personally see if we were looking for any recommendations. We were immediately served by a very friendly waiter named Elijah who took great care of us.  The shrimp cocktail was superb with an incredibly delicious and uniquely flavored, chili salt served around the rim of the glass.  The tomatoe flatbread was very fresh and very tasty.  The French Punch was a very very good, served in a generous portion and had a great fruity taste with a clean finish (great on a hot night).  The 902 Hell or Hoboken IPA is a classic IPA with a strong flavor profile which was part of an incredible beer list.  The big highlight for me, however, was the burger.  The Kobe beef burger was  Off. The. Charts.  Good.  A very simply prepared, classic burger with an incredible special sauce that was cooked to a PERFECT medium rare.  I have had burgers all over Hoboken and Manhattan and this burger is my favorite by Far.  My hat is off to this new restaurant and I cannot wait till I come back and would absolutely recommend this to anyone. Great outdoor date spot or lounging with friends under the lights on Sinatra, you cannot miss with the restaurant.  Great work and good luck with the opening!
2017-07-04,3,I really wanted to love this place.... but it needs a lot of improvement. I don't think they were quite ready to open yet.1) could use more experienced waitstaff - waiter did not understand the beer we were trying to order2) had to wait 15 minutes for a table even though the inside was empty and there were open tables on the patio3) food could be improved. It wasn't bad but I'm not craving anything enough to come back On the positive though, the space looks amazing and the waitstaff was very friendly. If they want to survive in a trendy, fast paced city like Hoboken though, a lot of improvements need to be made.
2017-07-03,5,Literally one of the best burgers  I've ever had! There is a great selection of small plates to share. The cocktails are also strong and delicious! I was thrilled to go during their soft opening to try various items from the menu and am looking forward to returning frequently.
2017-07-03,2,Outdoor waterfront dining is the best part.  The staff was pleasant.  The food had issues... The cheese board was good but came with 4 tiny paper thin bread slices, very unbalanced. The lobster sliders tasted like canned lobster meat, not fresh.  Our salad had a plastic wrapper mixed in - they forgot to remove this from our bill and we had to address it.  Ordered coffee but they had no sugar(!?!).  The best dish we had was the grilled octopus.  I get this place is new so I hope they get it together.
2017-07-03,5,This place is a great addition to the waterfront. Amazing food and a wider selection of drinks than you usually see around Hoboken. Definitely try the French onion mac and cheese balls, shrimp and grits, or burger! See you again soon!
2017-07-03,1,Very disappointed was looking forward to trying out the new spot in town but was greeting with poor service.
2017-07-03,1,This place is the worst. I've been waiting half my life for my food. I may die here. Goodbye cruel world.
2017-06-26,5,Fantastic, airy space that breaks the Hoboken "beers and wings" mode. Drinks are strong and tasty. The small plates are delightful. Not to be missed!
