2021-08-13,1,Never coming here again simply because the staff is so rude. The owner should look into hiring an entirely new staff as I have seen many people complain about the staff on google and yelp. Plus..there are much better pizza places in Hoboken with very friendly staff. DO NOT GO HERE. DO NOT SUPPORT PLACES WHO CONTINUOUSLY HIRE RUDE STAFF.
2021-07-12,2,Best pizza I've had but I don't understand one thing. I read the reviews on here and I'm gonna say the same thing, EVERYTIME I go here the dude behind the counter got the craziest attitude. You own great pizza business, I mean the pizza is phenomenal but yet you keep this guy that has no people skills whatsoever to talk to customers. You also have another young kid who got the craziest attitude ever. I mean come on man, how many reviews do you need about this employee? How many talks have you had? I go outside to get a slice but I gotta deal with somebody who wakes up mad? How do you wake up mad? Stay home.
2021-07-09,1,Major shout out to this establishment! Not only is their pizza sub-par...they have the audacity to have a "donation box" at the register taped up claiming "feed the homeless" when their own employees admit that the owner uses those funds to go on vacation. When I saw this box all I had to do was look to my right to see a homeless person directly outside NOT benefiting from this so-called donation. Completely disgusting for a business to use the less fortunate for their personal gain! Tax free at that!! Attached are photo snapshots from the utterly upsetting video taken proving everything discussed in this review which they will try to dispute and remove. It's sickening
2021-07-01,1,This place used to be good. Now it seems they're "mistakenly" overcharging and hoping you don't notice. The final straw was yesterday when I ordered and paid for 4 slices. They gave me the box and when I opened the box in front of them, there were only 3. I did get my 4th slice. Shady and the quality has gone way down. Go elsewhere.
2021-06-26,4,Great sidewalk pizza. New York Style at its finest. You can purchase by the slice (the size of your head) or a GIANT pie.If you're in a hurry, they have pre-made slices they pop in the oven to reheat so you're in and out in less than 5 mins. They have a few tables to sit at or take it in your walk and eat on the go.If you have a sweet tooth, it's also right next door to Carlo's Bakery.
2021-06-23,1,They over charged me for average pizza at best. 3 slices for $15? Never again. Our total should have been $12.50 and when I brought it up to the cashier, he ignored me.
2021-05-14,1,Couldn't hear the worker so he refused to serve us. Absolutely terrible customer service. You could find 1000000 places with the same quality food who are actually kind and know how to  treat customers. One of the most disgusting encounters I've had recently
2021-03-31,5,Great cheese slice! Went at noon very quick! My go to pizza parlor to be included in my favorites!!! The crust is soo crunchy!! A++++ crust!!
2021-03-17,2,I went in I go frequently one of the workers helped me but handled money from previous customers and I asked him to wash his hands. He refused to and handles my food. So I leave and call and ask them to wash their hands next time and they hung up on me. Disgusting.
2021-03-07,1,Rude owner!!! Bad service .. Average pizza.Didn't allow to sit and eat just because I was carrying food from other place which I was not gonna eat there. He didn't allow to even enter and was very RUDE in front of other customers.
2020-09-12,3,I've been here a few times and it seems the service is going downhill or has been over the last few years.   I used to love the service here which made up for the inconsistency of the food.  This isn't my first choice or even on my top ten because I love real NY pizza but if you're in the area this is an easy place to stop.   It's a corner location and it's pretty quick to get in and out.  Depending on the time of day, you could get really fresh pizza or you could get a slice that has been sitting out a while.   It's your standard "fast food" pizza and that means sometimes the food has been sitting out longer than it should.  I do you like the pinwheels and even the pizza is ok when the crust is done right.  It's usually crispy yet soft in the middle and stays together when you fold it.  Otherwise it's nothing to write home about but if you're in a hurry or even need a place to grab a bite after stopping at Carlo's or checking out the local bars then this is a decent place to stop.
2020-07-22,5,The best spot for late night pizza in Hoboken!!Grab a couple slices and hang out after the bars!!
2020-07-09,2,If you're drunk or in a big hurry, it'll kinda do. If you aren't, keep moving. Just nothing special about it and too greasy.
2020-06-15,1,This establishment's pizza and customer service is horrible The employees are changing prices‚Äçand repeating prices in a rude manner.  It's a shame how much they don't take pride in the atmosphere they set. I hope the owner is reading this because your night shift workers displayed unprofessionalism ten minutes ago from the post. I feel guilty for being hungry and being at their mercy. Owner save your business and potential customers proceed at your own risk.Do not enter ! Do not enter !
2020-04-28,2,Good pizza - nice crispy crust with a flavorful sauce. Closest you can get to city slices w/o taking the PATH.HOWEVER... two things that make this place awful:(1) They charge whatever they want, whenever they want. St. Paddy's Day pub crawl? $5 for a pepperoni slice. Global pandemic? $4 a slice. The menu price? $3.50 on a good day.(2) Employees need to get some serious sanitation training. Watched the cashier handle cash, credit cards, boxes, & pizzas fresh out of the oven - all without washing his hands or changing his gloves between tasks. I'm pretty sure now is the most important time to pay attention to these things... Then he disappeared down the block for a few minutes with the same gloves on (to do who knows what...); came back and STILL didn't change gloves or wash his hands.TL;DR: If you don't care how much you'll pay for pizza and have an oven handy to decontaminate/nuke your pizza box/pie in, this is the place to go!
2020-04-04,1,I usually hate when people give a place 1-star based primarily on customer service, however in this case it is well deserved.I ordered delivery from this place a few months ago and was given a 45-minute wait time.  1 hour and 15 minutes later I call to check up on the order, they tell me the deliver driver is on the way and will be there in 10 minutes or less.  30 minuets later, no pizza so I call again and ask for my money back.  The guy on the other end of the phone immediately started yelling and saying he was refusing to refund my order and hangs up on me.  10 minutes later I get a call from the driver saying he's about to leave the store but doesn't have my address? LOL.A solid 2.5 hours after putting in the original order a driver finally shows up with 2 ICE COLD cold pizzas.Long story short:  I'd rather starve to death than ever give these scumbag morons another dime of my money.
2020-03-06,1,My husband ordered a pie. After finding out how gross this pizza is, he's now officially banned from ordering our takeout. I had a few bites and have the strangest most unappetizing taste in my mouth as I write this. It was actually cold when it got here, which, honestly, I was willing to look past and turned on the oven to heat it up. But now it's somehow worse? As if the heat brought out the bad flavors more? Like it was made this morning, left on the sidewalk for 10 hours, then the Hoboken sewer system overflowed and sent it down the street to our place. This is just a place where drunk college kids go to after the bars close. Definitely avoid.
2020-03-04,4,I always complain to people that there's no great pizza in Hoboken or Jersey City. I like Razza but that's something completely different. I mean pizza after a night out or for a football game. After trying a bunch of different places, Basile's is probably the closest to what I'm looking for in the area. The crust is really crispy, toppings are generous, and the pizza holds together when you pick it up and fold.I usually order for delivery (via Slice app) and it arrives quick and hot. A lot of people will say their pizza is expensive, and yes it's more than you'll spend in most other places in the area. Nobody's forcing you to spend the money; if you want something cheaper, there are plenty of other options.
2020-02-16,1,Never in my life have I been treated so disrespectfully by management at a restaurant. The manager/owner (guy in a red sweatshirt) first yelled at his hardworking employees in front of dozens of customers for something as trivial as what was on the tv, which stunned me. As I was watching him whine to his employees, he then looked at me and said "what are you looking at?", as if I weren't a customer or that there were many fellow customers in the establishment. I don't know where this guy gets his sense of entitlement, but I feel for the guys who make the pizza. They work hard and deliver a great product, only to be verbally accosted by their boss. Used to be a regular customer, but I am doubting if I'll ever return.
2020-02-01,1,Waited on a long  line, the guy on the register was texting the whole entire time, paid for my pizza --- ignored me when my pizza was ready -- like how unprofessional are these workers .   Get the hell off the dam phone and focus on clients -- clients/customers come first , Jesus Christ
2020-01-18,1,There was a set of cups sitting next to the soda fountain and when I went to take one (assuming they were little water cups) one of the associates said "What the fuck are you doing with the cups?" instead of explaining to me that they weren't there for grabs. I was a paying customer and was quite upset that I was treated this way...wouldn't recommend going here based on the way customers are treated...
2020-01-08,5,My favorite pizza in Hoboken! Always crowded for a good reason! Not too much room to sit and eat but they have such good pizza. Seriously awesome!
2020-01-04,5,Best pizza in jersey city. Period. Crispy crust is amazing , and plain pie is the best. A bit expensive but those things are massive!!!
2019-12-20,1,This place is pretty much trash. I went late when were the only spot open and they charged me $19 for 2 slices and told me it's cash only. Essentially pizza extortion.The slices were ok, like 3.5/5 but definitely not worth the money. They also gave me terrible heartburn which is unusual for me. And the cashier was extremely rude. Next time I'm hungry at midnight I'll find a domino's.
2019-11-30,4,Got 4 slices for around $15.  The regular cheese slice was lacking in the tomato sauce department and the crust/underside was a little past crispy for my liking.  The cheese sicilian slice was much more my style with a plethora of delicious tomato sauce.  This place also has a $10 minimum if paying with a card.
2019-10-28,4,We stopped by the shop after talking to the lady in Carlo's Bakery.  She said that they eat there a lot.  The pizza slices were big and the cheese pizza was delicious.  We had another with mushrooms and tomatoes.  I would eat there again if I'm in the area again.  The guy behind the counter was very helpful and answered my questions
2019-09-28,4,Cheese slice pizza here is my comfort and 2am drunk food. Although $3.5 for a thin slice of pizza is too much but since lack of pizza options in downtown Hoboken makes it worth it.
2019-09-14,5,10/10 best pizza place in new jersey with them BIIIG pizzas, me & my grandfathers favorite place to go when we just need a GOOD slice of pizza. Truly a great spot, & the owners & workers are always so nice, love this place!!
2019-09-13,1,Ordered a pizza, garlic knots and chicken roll from these guys on the Slice app. An hour later they delivered the pizza and refunded me $9 for the garlic knots and chicken roll because they ran out. They ran out of garlic knots and chicken roll at 7pm on a Friday night!  They didn't call me to let me know. I found out at the time of delivery (8pm) that I couldn't get half of my order. Thankfully they refunded me the money, but why not let me know prior to delivery?  When I called to complain, these guys could care less. Fortunately I was able to get the rest of my dinner from a reputable pizza joint 45 minutes later. Will NEVER order from these guys again.  They could care less about customer service.
2019-09-08,1,Real trash like their team!!! Also be careful if you order for delivery they will overcharge you and not deliver your full order. They also never refunded me.
2019-08-30,4,Good slice of pizza. Definitely recommend. $3 for a slice is overpriced in my opinion but it's good.
2019-08-12,4,This place makes excellent pizza. Very thin and with a unique quality to their crust. For the quality of their pizza they warrant a five star review. The reason I gave them only 4 stars, however, is for two reasons. One, I have been there many times at this point, and the staff there is consistently unpleasant for no reason I can think of. My opinion is on that issue is corroborated by other reviews on this site. Two, their prices are quite high.
2019-08-07,1,The absolute rudest, nastiest workers in Hoboken. Why anyone would tolerate them for mediocre pizza is beyond me. I'd rather eat Elios frozen pizza than spend one penny here.
2019-07-31,2,If you like leftover pizza, go here! It appears like the pizza sits for long periods time, causing it to taste like it's straight out of the fridge. Maybe some like this! Thoughts and prayers.
2019-07-27,4,Pizza is good ! It's tasty and crunchy. Usually open till late. On weekends it usually gets packed so sometimes you need to wait to get your slice. There's tables outside to sit. Pretty convenient spot!
2019-07-19,4,This place is a must-try in Hoboken. The open doors are very inviting, allowing the aroma of freshly cooked pizza to waft down the street and lure in customers at all hours of the day. They have a great selection of slices, and they're open late for bar-goers. What more could you ask for?
2019-07-16,4,Surprisingly decent pizza for a place that kind of channels a 99c slice shop.There is no decor to speak of so I never eat there, it's a little depressing with the fluorescent lighting and crumb-covered formica tables. There's a little al fresco area if you insist. I stop in on the reg on my way home from the Path and get a slice to go. Crust is crispy, cheese and sauce are in good balance, and toppings are fresh. Consistently solid all around even if it's not taking home any awards.Service is pretty quick and ranges from Chinese-takeout-efficient to friendly depending on whom you speak with. Bring cash if you just want a slice, there is a credit card minimum.
2019-07-16,4,This a great spot in town for pizza since it's so close to the PATH, light rail and ferry so most people come home and grab it to go since it's fast. The buffalo chicken is the best pizza slice to get, they take credit card  but there is a minimum, the crust is crispy and usually no burnt. The service is quick not a place to bring a crowd even though Thur-Sun night it gets packed after the pubs are closed, the pizza  app guy @stoolpresidente gave them a 8.1/10 which I would say is pretty spot on.
2019-06-25,3,This place has tasty pizza which is great, especially, after a night out and a few drinks. However, the restaurant is usually pretty crowded and not the cleanest. It's not the most pleasant place to sit and eat, but does the job when you're hungry! A slice is $3.75 which is not bad.
2019-06-08,2,Nice corner spot, all tables dirty with pizza crumbs. Big place no bathrooms. Pizza quality is okay I like how crunchy it is. Overall nice place but with workers like dat it wont do well. The tables are very clear to see how dirty they are. 2.95 a slice that's over price for the amount of pizza u get.
2019-06-03,1,I called him it was raining and he said he s gonna close at midnight and I showed up . He said he has mozerellaPizza but he is out of it. All other pizzas was not  fresh. He doesn't make any fresh one so left me just there with cold slices. Low business mentality. Bad service. Room was dirty as well
2019-05-18,1,Garbage service. Ordered a large plain pie. Waited 30 minutes. Never gave us the food and told us to leave essentially. Will never go back. AVOID.
2019-05-11,5,Excellent plain pie!  Crunchy and thin :) Their service was fantastic.  The order ran late on delivery ONLY because they had a large order ahead of us to fill and because of the traffic. Completely understandable and they called us twice with these updates to the time in which our order will arrive.  Absolutely, professional!!! Well done, Basile's! :)))
2019-05-05,1,Pizza is good, unfortunately the service stinks and they literally will act like they didn't receive your order after accepting it on Grubhub.
2019-04-02,5,This is the GREATEST pizza place of all time. I honestly think this might be the best pizza I have ever eaten. Maybe it's because it's after a few drinks on a night out, or maybe its just amazing pizza.  Either way, whenever I am in Hoboken, I always hit up this place for at least one slice before I leave.  It gets pretty packed during the early morning hours, there is usually a line.  But the wait is definitely worth it.  I highly recommend.
2019-02-15,5,Technically I haven't tasted their pizza yet but my boyfriend says it's really good. He works around the corner from them and had to work the night of Valentine's Day. I put in a special request at Basile's to have a pizza delivered. I meant to order a pizza with "pepperonis [placed] in the shape of a heart." I wasn't even sure they were going to do it. They did one better and made the whole pizza in the shape of a heart! Turned out great and he was very happy.
2019-01-25,2,Not the worst pizza in Hoboken but probably second place. Don't come here unless you are drunk and can't tell the difference or just need pizza the exact second you walk pass.
2019-01-18,5,When it's fresh - it's BOMB.com I love the crust, sauce & cheese. I've gotta day one of my fav slices in town.Lunch specials daily 2 slices and a soda for $6 -- Sooooo good. They put cornmeal on the bottom of their slices which give it a really nice texture and they're a corner shop so they're always turning fresh pies. You can't go wrong with a plain slice or margherita. Nice pizza guys who will get you in and out quickly.
2019-01-17,1,This Place Use To Be My Go To Favorite Jersey Pizza....I Found It From Always Waiting In Line At Carlos Bakery! I Recently Visited When I Was Home For The Weekend And It's Completely Changed Must Be A New Owner Or Something Cuz It's Completely RANK!!!!! The Pizza Was Burnt No Cheese And Barely Any Sauce!!! Absolutely Disgusting! And To Top It Off My Mom And I Ordered 2 $5.95 Specials And An Extra Drink Which Cost An Addition $2.00 But The Guy Charged Me $17.00 And Then When I Asked For My Refund The Worker Argued Me??? What Type Of Business Does That COMPLETE DUMP This Will Be My Final Time EVER At Basile's Pizza
2018-12-30,1,Ordered two pies (two large, one plain, one chicken) and waiting on line for over 50 minutes... but in the mean time I see 7+ plain pies made and handed out in front of me
2018-07-22,5,This pizza was better than I thought it was going to be! My mother and I went as soon as the place opened and the food was so hot and fresh we couldn't have asked for it any better. The quality of the pizza was superb and it tasted phenomenal! A must try if you're ever in Hobken.
2018-07-17,3,I've had this pizza a few times whenever I'm out in Hoboken. It's very convenient to order pizza from this establishment due to the fact that it is wide open right on the sidewalk & you can walk right up to the counter & order. Wait time is not usually long & they usually have plenty of different pies out for you to choose from. They have some seating inside & during the spring/summer/early fall they have some outside seating as well. The pizza itself is so-so. It definitely gets the job done after a long night out in Hoboken but there are definitely some better options around. If I'm nearby this place & in desperate need of food I'll usually make a stop but I'm not gonna go out of my way to get a slice from here if I'm not close by.
2018-06-25,3,Basile's is definitely your best option for late night pizza or a quick slice in the neighborhood.  They have tons of choices and they're pretty speedy about getting you what you want.  I do think the pizza is a bit overpriced though.  It's good pizza, but not $3 a slice good.  If you want a slice or two, this is the place to go, but would not recommend for ordering a whole pie.
2018-05-05,3,Love this place best pizza in town great pricey fast and friendly service worth traveling to for a goid slice I've tried other local pizzerias not a fan
2018-03-12,5,I was desperate for some pizza when we were at Carlo's Bakery a few years ago. We found Basile's very close to Carlo's, and I have to say that I was blown away by their Chicken/Ricotta/Broccoli pizza, as well as their sausage and green pepper. Living in LA, it's a challenge to find good pizza. Basile's, for me, was worth the subway under the river to Hoboken. (To say nothing of the great view they have of lower Manhattan)
2018-03-02,5,Thin and crispy and so fucking good.  Grab a slice you will not regret it!  Literally everything is delicioussss
2018-02-20,3,Good Pizza, really enjoyed it. My son and wife thought it was amazing. I've had better, but I like it. The fountain drinks tasted funny however. I'd bet money that wasn't Diet Coke coming out of the dispenser.
2018-01-27,5,I always stumble here after the bar and their pizza is some of the best I've had. Their crust is fantastic so crispy and crunchy.  The slices are always hot and the guys working are always friendly for it being so late at night. Keep up the good work!
2017-12-27,5,This has to be my favorite pizza spot and I don't even live in Hoboken.  I came across this pizza place after ordering some pies for my son's Halloween party at Tiger Schulmann.  First of all the delivery was very punctual ( we had an agreed upon delivery time) and the pies were so fresh and pizza was hot! We had a variety of pies including plain, pepperoni, margarita, white and veggie, all were simply put... delicious!! My favorite has to be the margarita slices, you can just taste how fresh the ingredients are and the crust is by far the best!!
2017-12-26,5,BEST PIZZA in HOBOKEN period!   Place is packed and they offer a variety of different slices...  the buffalo chicken is amazing!   They are open late and even on Christmas.  A must visit when in Hoboken.   No gimmicks like the other Hoboken spots.. just good Pizza that is made fresh daily!   They also had televisions to watch the games!!!
2017-12-11,5,This is my favorite pizza in all New Jersey. Always fresh and cooked to perfection. The service is awesome they are always happy and cordial. I must try
2017-11-30,3,I love how the pizza be is always crispy and the service is fast. The only thing that holds me back is that the guys at the counter always touch my pizza without gloves on (every time) while also handling money at the register. I'm always scared to eat where because I don't want to end up getting sick. Other than that, they're always rushing you out and the pizza is super over priced as well. Overall, the pizza is really good, the service is not.
2017-11-27,5,The pizza is delcious all day and night. It's made using recipes passed through the years to the owner Basile, a resteraunteur and Entrepreneur who knows how to mix both customer service, food service and good business ethics. Couple that with a good quality product available 24 hours a day and a sense of humor and youve got a pizza joint that has staying power. Good job Basile.
2017-11-26,1,Thought i stolefrom the place but  I didn't. Gave them a really good tip but they still thought I wasn't a worthy customer. Not worth coming here, plenty of places to go
2017-11-13,1,I went there recently and will not be returning for a reason that has nothing to do with the food. I came in around 9pm on a Saturday night and was charged .50 more for my slice of pizza. When I asked why I wasn't being charged the price on the menu, I was told by the cashier that the guys working late needed to be paid extra. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I'm not sure if the owner knows this is going on but they just lost a loyal customer.
2017-11-08,5,This place has great pizza (tangy and cheesy; had it with pepperoni) - make sure to ask for it well done on the top (trust me on this!).  A special shout out to the crust  - really chewy and flavorful.
2017-11-05,5,They can be slow and inattentive, but their pizza is top notch in my opinion. Always crispy (due to the corn starch on the bottom), which makes for a delicious experience. I prefer the mushroom and classic plain slices the best, but several of the other slices are good. If you are going to call in a pickup order, it's hit or miss. I've had to walk over and wait in person on several occasions which prevents me from ordering on a more regular basis. If you are walking home from the Path after a late night at work, this is your best bet for a quick, satisfying dinner!
2017-11-03,5,Best pizza in Hoboken. On par with Manhattan pizzerias. Buffalo chicken is on point. I tried all the other Pizza in Hoboken in this is the best by far.
2017-10-29,2,Didn't have a selection of pizza. Only had multiple mushroom and cheese pies. Pizza was very tough, cardboard-like.
2017-10-28,1,Absolute worst place ever. Charged me per slice for pies for no reason. Tried to reason with them but they're all crooks and so unbelievably rude.Absolute thiefs for mediocre at best pizza. Would give 0 stars if possible.
2017-05-24,2,Service sucks. The guys at the counter are rude. Pizza is ok. I wont be coming back because they are such jerks at the counter.
2017-05-16,1,These guys continually go from handling cash to touching your pizza with their bare hands. No hand washing, no gloves. Cash, pizza, cash, pizza. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. I had to do a double take, and then they did it over, and over, and over. I thought maybe it was just 1 guy that didn't get trained or something, so when I was walking by the place another time, I watched a different guy do the same thing. He takes a customer's cash, and then grabs pizza slices with his bare hands to throw them in the oven. This is food service 101. If they can't even get "you don't handle cash and then touch food" right, I can only wonder what other health code violations are going on in this place. I don't generally ever leave 1 star reviews, but this is truly disgusting. And semi-unfortunate, because they make a decent drunk slice.
2017-05-05,5,This place has real OG pizza. Old school pizza a the staff is super cool. Thanks Basiles pizza for making Hoboken great.
2017-04-24,5,My Wife and 2 daughters and myself visited Basile's on 4-19-2017 .We were on Spring Break Vacation in Douglas, Ga.  We took the subway from New York, to Hoboken New Jersey. Just to say we've been  to New Jersey,  we were looking for Carlo's Bakery, when we found this wonderful Pizza Heaven, we all tried a different slice of pizza, and I've got to say, it was the best Pizza that I have ever had!Hats off and thumbs up to the owner, and staff of Basile's!!!
2017-04-24,4,My favorite, by the slice, pizza shop. The pies have breadcrumb undersides which make them crunchy. Great selection of specialty pizzas.
2017-04-23,5,The fact that Basiles has 3 Stars on Yelp is suspect. Been living in town for years and while each pizza spot has it's own high lights Basiles stands ahead of most of them.Best buffalo chicken pizza in the game for the record.
2017-04-17,4,Great pizza and variety, but they don't have ranch, which is a huge problem.It's really hard to choose what kind of pizza to purchase. Their buffalo chicken pizza is great but only offers blue cheese .
2017-04-01,3,They got the semolina crust which is never a good sign however the flavors really mesh together well.Service is also spot on. I like the people there bc they always make you feel welcome.I do not like that some of the pizza just sits out and gets cold. In the summer time it gets kind of funky but otherwise this is a solid place.
2017-03-29,4,Quick, fast, and easy. Ordered the Buffalo Chicken pizza - a tad expensive for my liking but overall a really solid piece of pie. Crispy just the way I like it.
2017-03-24,2,Thought the pizza was just okay. On the bright side, they have options galore!Atmosphere is really fun and makes for a good time. Fairly clean considering the total traffic they get on a daily basis must be a lot more than other pizza joints on the strip.They are open late, which makes it a prime destination for people leaving the surrounding bars.To summarize, nothing special.
2016-10-05,3,This place is just fine for a quick slice on a corner!
2016-09-18,5,Their pizzas always have a nice, crispy, thin crust.They're open till late, which is quite rare in the area.
2016-09-13,1,Really bad pizza and overpriced.  $3.75 for a slice of margarita which had nothing on it.  The chicken on their pizza was deep fried and salty.  It's not fresh chicken.   Overall, pizza was disgusting and price was high.  The only reason they are still in business is because of their prime location.
2016-09-08,4,Ordered the large pizza box with Pepperoni and Mushrooms!This was definitely not a disappointment! We highly recommend this pizza!
2016-09-05,3,One of the only places open late after a night of drinking in Hobo. Long line of drunken messes falling over but the pizza was good. At the point when you're that hungry, anything will taste good.  $20 minimum for using a card. I'd much rather go to Benny's but they were closed.
2016-08-29,3,Bottom line- $5 for two cheese slices and a 20 oz. soda...great price! The pizza...eh, it's ok. I've had much better, I've had much worse. Right next to Carlo's Bakery. It's close to work for me and open air seating when it's nice enough out to walk around. It's cheap, it's convenient, I'll probably come back. No high expectations though.
2016-08-08,1,The restaurant quoted an estimated delivery of 20-30 minutes from the time of order. I had to call to follow up twice. The pizza arrive an hour and half after I originally ordered. The food arrived cold. Disappointing.
2016-07-13,1,I went here because Rome Pizza was closed for renovations. I think I would've been better off eating my shoe. I should've known the minute I walked up to the counter and the staff or more interested in shoving each other then helping the customers. When they finally egg knowledge that there were people willing to pay money for their swill, the staff were unintelligible in both English and Spanish. I ordered a plane slice. I thought this is Hoboken, how bad could it be? It was pretty bad. The crust had the consistency of thick cardboard. It was likely heated and reheated six times during the day. In addition, it was burnt, the sauce had zero taste, and there was too much cheese for my liking. I'm guessing the only reason this place survives is due to drunken bar goers who don't have the cognitive skills to know the difference between this and real food. Suffice it to say, I will not be going back!
2016-06-06,2,Did I Miss Something?Event:  First Saturday and Hoboken and I needed a slice while running errands.  Saw a lot of great reviews an wanted to give it a tryFood:  Its pizza.  Kind of like a band at a wedding, really hard to be bad.  Not a fan of the panko on the bottom, thought could have used more sauce.  Didn't really stand out. Crust was perfect crispiness thoughService: No hassles, no problems.  Thought $5 deal worked on Saturdays,but nopeBottom line: I imagine if it was 2AM and I stumbled out of the Shannon this would be great.  But probably wont be the place I'll go to during the week. I imagine there are too many better spots for that
2016-05-18,4,I've been here several times, and this place hasn't disappointed yet! I (strangely) tend to like just plain cheese pizza (with lots of hot pepper flakes), and they get it just right! The cheese is just melty enough, the pizza is just oily enough but not too much that it's gross, and the bottom is nice and crispy. It might have cornmeal or something crunchy and grainy on the bottom of the crust, which I like as a good contrast to the softness on top with the cheese and sauce.Their service is good, pretty fast. The staff can sometimes be a bit curt, especially when it's busy or you're coming at peak times (i.e. Leaving the bars rush hour), but they're generally pretty friendly and very efficient with their work. I once dropped a whole box full of pizza on the floor of their establishment right upon getting it, and they were very nice about it, cleaning it all up and re-doing our order at no extra cost. Very very nice of them :)
2015-10-31,4,The pepperoni pizza was crunchy and tasty at 3.50$. I will always prefer NYC 1$ slices but this is an easy place to get a slice from. They are also very fast and courteous. My kind of place :)
2015-10-19,4,Nice slice for an ok price. Great stop if your coming or going,to the Path.
2015-10-17,4,Stopped by after a visit to Carlo's Bakery with my family. My eggplant parm slice was GREAT. My daughter had the chicken parm and enjoyed it but my friend had a spinach slice and the spinach tasted old. Garlic knots were an awesome addition to our food. I loved the crispness of the slice.
2015-10-15,3,There are about 26 pizza places in one square mile of Hoboken. Basile's is the only place to go for a slice at 3 pm or 3 am. They have the best slice in town, hands down. The crust is very crispy and rivals some of NYC's best. However, having said that, the owner's couldn't give a you-know-what about giving their customers FRESH slices and thus, they are guilty of making pies at 11am and serving them at 11pm. Point being, if you don't catch them on the rare moment a fresh pie comes out, you will be stuck eating one of the pies on display that's completely dry and suffering from rigor mortis.If they put out some fresh pies once in a while, they'd be the best place in town. But because they have no problem serving up stuff that looks like it was peeled off a wall, they lose 2 stars.Bottom line, if you want a thin crust slice, Basile's is still the best option. If it's a whole pie definitely try Grimaldi or Johnny Pepperoni during regular hours.
2015-10-14,4,4 stars for being my go-to place when im drunk. I wouldn't come here just for the pizza, but it does deserve a 4 star for being convenient. Not the best pizza, but everything tastes good when you're drunk anyways. Service is good, because the lines go very fast, and normally I don't have to wait a long time for my pizza ( even if i'm ordering a huge pie!)
2015-10-03,4,Honestly was not expecting to like this place but the cheese slices have me addicted. Something about their thin crust I just love. Put a little parm and red pepper flakes and you are golden. I think it's a little over priced for what it is and only take cash which is annoying/sketchy but that won't stop me from returning. Pleasantly surprised.
2015-10-02,3,Had a regular cheese slice. The crust was thin and the cheese gooey like you would want. That said there wasn't anything outstanding - but it was none the less a solid. I'd go again.
2015-09-26,5,This is an AWESOME PIZZERIA! I came here while going TRAVELING FOR WORK and found this place. It reminded me of the old style pizzerias that I usually went to, in the past.  I was hoping that the pizza was also good as it was when I used to go to these PIZZA places.   And it was EVEN BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!     I also LIKED THE WAY THE TABLES WERE ORGANIZED and what was available to you to use while dining there.   OVERALL I REALLY LIKE THIS PLACE, in good old HOBOKEN, NJ!!!!!
2015-09-12,4,Solid place for a slice. I came here sober late evening and pizza tasted really good. Crispy but slightly chewy crust, with near perfect cheese to sauce ratio. I think they have better margarita slices than tourist filled Grimaldi's.
2015-09-08,5,Pizza was delicious! Crispy, flavorful and to the point! Nothing fancy. And this place actually has great seating. Several other pizza shops only had maybe two seats. The customer service was also good! Everywhere in NYC it seemed like people were a- holes. I don't understand what's it with people there. Anyways, next time I'm back in the area I'll definitely be back!
2015-08-29,4,Not bad at all. Busy all the time and that means fresh pizza all the time. I always go with plain slice really nice crust and good pizza sauce. Great location too u will be walking on newark street and find yourself inside the pizzeria how I don't know .
2015-08-26,5,Late night pizza with the best thin crust!!! Great selection of pizzas!! The classic Plain is amazing but I also love the buffalo chicken pizza!
2015-08-16,2,Was downtown so i decided to finally try this place. Was around 1pm and ordered individual slices. The pizza was ok at best. Kind of tasted like it was made a day earlier and had been in my refrigerator all night. So basically tasted like leftovers. Seating area was dirty, they accept only cash, and place was a bit chaotic. I think i'll have to be drunk to ever venture here again.
2015-08-14,1,I just want to preface by admitting that I've only come here after long nights of steady drinking. Otherwise, I would never be so venturesome to try out an open-aired pizza shop that seems like it's only in business because of its late hours and favorable location on Washington near bars and the PATH.My main gripe stems from the customer service. Last time I was here, I joined the standard line of drunk overprivileged white people and tried to assess which pizza variety appeared to be the least stale. As I was internally resolving this very insubstantial dilemma, my thought process was disturbed when one of the workers started to forcefully refer to us patrons as "f***ers." He was howling something along the lines of, "slide down and pay, f***ers!"I want to pause for a moment and point out that I'm not sure whether or not Yelp allows cursing. I've self-censored the narrative here, and will unnecessarily apologize for the worker's rather poor form and word choice.It was becoming increasingly apparent that it was soon going to be my turn to order and that I would need to quickly determine a plan of action if this worker were to directly call me a "f***er." Sure enough, his eyes met mine, pointed at me with a spatula-type pizza implement and asked me "what do you want, f***er?" I politely responded by confirming with him that he just called me a f***er, which he ardently admitted and subsequently shrugged off.At this point, despite the night's alcohol and its clever boost in self-assurance, I decided to be the bigger man and walk away. I wasn't going to get in a struggle with a migrant worker over his improper and rather uncomplimentary word choice, nor was I going to respond with an actual order that I'd have to shamefully eat along with any last bit of self-respect.Instead, I decided I'd be an internet hero for all those verbally abused at Basile's after-hours and write a thorough critique of what is a truly terrible pizzeria.
2015-08-03,4,I bought different kinds of pizza for the family.  For the most part the pizzas were good, I personally didn't like mine, which was the sausage pizza, but the family love theirs, which was cheese pizza and mozzarella basil.
2015-07-25,4,Cute little pizzeria!! The were quick and friendly. Their Tomato Basil pizza and  Spicy Chicken pizza was great! Spicy chicken is made with buffalo sauce but not too much!
2015-07-23,5,I stumbled upon this pizza place after a night out in hoboken and it was the best discovery ever.  Huge pizza fan and this is in my top five.  Admittedly everything tastes a lot better after a night out, but my friend and I like to go to pizza places and try them out, so I can honestly say that it's just as good sober. Love Basile's
2015-07-20,4,I went early this week and the food was amazing! They have this special where you can get 2 slices of cheese pizza and a soft drink for $5, and it was worth it. The cheese pizza slices are HUGE and so good! Besides the cheese pizza, they offer all kinds of really good pizza and vegetarian friendly! They are really tasty. Definitely check this place out if you get time!
2015-07-17,5,We were "fortunate" enough to get stuck with a 1.5 hour delay between our PATH train and our NJT connection, so we wandered out of the Hoboken station to find grub.  Luckily, my wife was persistent enough to do her homework along the way and find a family-friendly New York-style pie place for us roaming Texans to enjoy.  Our daughter wanted some authentic NYC Pizza and we hadn't found it yet.  By great fortune, we stumbled upon a proprietor who is passionate about his product and his customers: Russel Basile.  We are not NYC pizza experts (we do it much differently in Texas), but this pizza was absolutely amazing for my 4 kids, wife, and I.  We all bought second slices!  Then Russel took the unexpected extra step to come out and bring us sampler garlic bread and engage us all in conversation.  This extra customer service was something we had not expected from the "big city", but we are used to back home.  Having been business owners ourselves, we were so happy to see an owner being so personable and passionate as Mr. Basile was that night.  He helped turn a sour "big city" train layover into a quintessential vacation memory for our family!  We would TOTALLY go back again and recommend this place to anyone!  I think some of the reviewers on this page are spoiled because they have too many choices every day.  IMO, it's a rare gem to find an owner who tries so hard to build those personal bonds with customers, not only in this day of high-tech "nocializing" (eg. pretending to socialize, but really just keeping your face in a damn device), but right in the heart of hip and busy Hoboken?  We were visiting from foodie and friendly Austin, TX, and didn't expect to find anything close to what we found at Basile's.  You can be assured that I've got no ulterior motive in writing this review except to give credit where credit is due.  From a former business owner to a successful one.  Good job, Mr. Basile!
2015-07-06,4,There is a pizza shop on every corner in Hoboken, but most of them, honestly, suck.  My hubby, frenchie and I spent an afternoon doing a pizza crawl around town determined to find the best pizza and, hands down, the honor went to Basile's.  BUT... not just any pizza here.  Specifically, you have to order a fresh pie and it needs to be the MARGHERITA pizza.  Even better with extra cheese.
2014-08-31,2,Perfect location, great choice, everything looks yummy and then the taste... Very disappointing. I think it does the job when it's late and you need a quick bite after many drinks. Other than that forget about it. There are other places in Hoboken with way better Pizzas.
2014-08-13,3,After waiting in line for Carlo's Bakery, this place has a prime-time corner location.  You can see it from the line in front of CVS so it builds up expectations.  Turns out that it is pretty delicious.  Friendly staff is a plus which this spot has and they warmed up the pizza perfectly, not too hot to burn the roof of you mouth like some places.  I ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza (and drink) which is my favorite and the slices were definitely generous portions. The crust is light and crispy where the toppings are located however I was a little disappointed with the outer crust.  I don't like it so dry and crunchy, I like it a little softer.  That's my only complaint.  If you're in the neighborhood, definitely worth a try.  They have lunch specials, but we were told no specials on the weekend.
2014-08-07,5,I'm visiting from Florida going to Cake Boss and i decided to have a slice of pizza with my family. This place is UNBELIEVABLE and I came to the conclusion that I like this place better than Cake Boss cupcakes!!!!!
2014-08-01,4,I stopped in here late one night with the drunk munchies.  Pizza was exactly what I wanted.  I got a tomato slice.  Not to be confused with a margarita slice, this pie had actual slices of tomato on it.  It held together well and tasted very fresh.This pizzeria is very easy to spot as it is right on the corner.  In fact, you can walk right through it as the walls retract up.  During the summer the whole place is opened up which is a great feature.  There are also a few tables to sit down if you are not in a rush.All in all, very convenient.
2014-08-01,2,This place is all about location and variety.  They always seem to be in the right place at the right time.  How do they do that??They are in possibly the best location in Hoboken, right on that busy corner where you are just bound to walk past.  The place is brightly lit, and they have a huge display case packed with all kinds of different pizzas.  So you're walking down the street, you just got out of a bar or off the path or whatever, and your hungry.   And you see Basile's.  And you hear angels singing.  And that's when they've got you.You order a slice....no, make it two.  You don't care about the price.  They slap it in the oven.  Your excitement mounts.  It comes out of the oven.  You take a bite.  And.........it's kind of "meh".  It's kind of bland.  It's kind of thin.  It's a little well-done.  Maybe it was sitting out for a while.  And what's with all the cornmeal crumbs on the bottom of the pizza??But whatever.  It served it's purpose.  You were hungry.  And they were there.
2014-07-27,4,I'm from CA and pizza here isn't that good.  My family and I really liked the pizza at this place. We each got a slice. They had a lot of different konds. Staff was friendly. Not many places to sit done. They were also out of ice that day. This is a couple doors down from Carlos Bakery which is where we were headed.
2014-07-23,3,I love the pizza here and constantly get it cause I live right around the corner it's normally the best the reason for my 3star rating is the people who work here ESPECIALLY the woman are the most rotten people ever never nice she always acts like she couldn't be more annoyed that you ordered something
2014-07-21,5,This pizza place it amazing, it is my favorite pizza around. The pizza itself is thin, but has a great dough, sauce, and cheese to it.I have a hard time finding pizza that actually tastes decent, and not some mediocre pie. And this pizza always surpased my expectations. The first time I came to hoboken I went for carlos bakery in the winter, but refused to stand in that awful line. Walking the other way I noticed this pizza place, and decided to give it a try to possibly warm me up. I am so happy that I stopped to ate here, It was a great choice. I would highly recommend this pizza.
2014-07-21,1,Ok, The best thing about this place is the crust on their pizza.  I will give them that.  it's very  good. I, and my friends, have lived in Hoboken for about 14 years and like to goto my neighborhood places and show support.....The problem here is that everyone here (maybe there is one) is soooooooooo Incredibly rude,  it's ridiculous. I have been here about 10 times not, and it's getting worse.  They act like you are doing them a favor by ordering here.  You order and ask for it hot and they put it in the oven for 1 minute.  I asked for it extra hot and guess what. .... Still a minute.  I ask for hot sauce or buffalo wing sauce that they already put on their pizza ,and I have gotten here before, and they tell me they don't have any, which I find funny since they also make a pizza out of it.  Then they rush you to the case register to pay.  No politeness, no thank yous, no customer service whatsoever.  I would LOVE to talk to the owner and let him/her know about what goes on here.  I am not a college-age or post college kid.  I am a professional working person who would like to be treated like they want my business.  With 1000's of other restaurants  people can go to, I wonder when workers and owners will get it.   Hey Owner, tell your staff to grow up and learn how to smile and say please and thank you, and "what can I do for you" or "what can I get you".  A little of that goes a long way.  We will  do our best not to come here unless it is a last resort.  I will also encourage another place to open near by so I don't have to come here again.  GROW UP BASILE's STAFF.
2014-06-23,2,The pizza here is good, but overpriced because they can get away with it.The staff is also really rude.  I asked for a cup of water (usually places give those out for free) and instead they gave me a small Styrofoam dixie cup size. It was really insulting. I used to frequent this place for a quick slice but will no longer.
2014-05-25,5,I don't understand how this place can have anything but a 5 star review. The pizza is inexpensive, fantastic, and they're open all hours of the day and night. Not to mention the guys are always helpful and nice, even when it's crazy.
2014-05-16,1,Not often do I work in Hoboken, but when I do, I enjoy coming to this place. The service is never particularly great, but today was horrible. I go in at at 10:50 AM, and wanted two slices of Sicilian off two different types of pies. I don't like corner slices, so naturally I asked not to be given corners, the person responds by saying "you can only get corner slices because the pies aren't ready to be cut". What kind of nonsense is that? I thought businesses were supposed to give the customer what they're paying for, and not what they want to give you. I guess the customer isn't always right at Basile's pizza. Not to mention the lame excuse given to not have to cut the pies to give me the slices in the center. I mean, when you order a whole Sicilian pie, no sooner that it comes out of the oven, they slice the pie and box it for you to take right away. So how could they "not be ready to cut". The pizza is awesome, but the service sucks. I'm sure there's other places with a good slice of pizza in Hoboken, with better service, that you'd be better off giving your business to...
2014-05-02,3,Location. Location. Location. "Ok" pizza and hits the spot after a happy hour. 3 stars may be a little generous but you can't beat the convenience. Assuming they have very cheap management because I asked for a bag to carry home 2 slices and you would have thought I asked for a "free slice."
2014-04-27,5,If you're looking for a great slice of thin crust pizza with lots of variety, this is your place! The pizza has a panko crunch that adds a great crunchy texture! The staff is friendly and the service is quick!
2014-04-17,1,Awful service. Out of plain pizza slices would not allow me to buy another slice at price. Ignored customers as they arrived.
2014-04-02,4,After a late night of drinking, this is a great place to grab a slice! I can see how during the day hours people might not be as interested, but after 10 the pizza is fresh, tasty, and totally hits the spot.
2014-03-17,4,After a heavy night of drinking this is the place to go for pizza. Its quick and pretty good quality.  Just be mindful of what you ordered, on more than one occasion I had to tell them repeatedly what I ordered. They kept trying to give me someone else's pizza.
2014-02-23,3,Pizza on display looks fabulous but unfortunately did not taste as good it looks... The sausage topping looked and tasted the best. Got a pepperoni and a chocked parm Stromboli but were pretty plain and was cold when served even though it came out if the oven. Good spot considering it is right next to Carlos Bakery... Service was just ok
2014-02-06,4,My opinion, I think its one of the top pizzerias in hoboken.  I'm down there once a week for work and always grab a slice, uses to live out there for years before they opened and this tops all the other places.  Good tasting crust.  Service is ok, not really a line its just a free for all.  Don't go when all the tourist clowns are lining up for the bake shop next door.
2014-02-03,3,There are so many pizza choices in Hoboken...the only reason I came into Basile's is because of the location. I was starving after sitting in class for 4 hours that I ran into the closest pizza spot from the terminal. It's also open until 11. I have had their regular cheese slice and it's nothing special. I had the broccoli/ricotta pizza slice this time and it was better. But it was also $3.50 ...and the first thing I did was compare it to  a Benny's slice which is 10x bigger and it's $3. Basile's is only good on weekends when you're out drinking.
2014-02-03,3,I come here because the location is convenient, they're open late, have a good variety of slices, and the pizza's a-ight. Nothing really to write home about, but when you're hungry it hits the spot. The special slices ring in at a hefty three-fitty ($3.50) so if you want anything beyond the basics it can get a little pricey.
2014-02-02,5,Best place in hoboken for a quick slice of Za
2014-01-21,2,This probably deserves more than 2 stars, but not a full 3.  The pizza here isn't bad... if you can catch it fresh out of the oven.  But they make a LOT of different kinds of pies here, and if the place isn't packed, then the pies have been sitting out for a while.  You can tell just by looking at them. They usually look old and dry.  Yes, they re-heat them, but pizza is just not as good when it's re-heated.  I only consider going here if it's when they first open, or when it's packed and they're cranking out fresh pizzas.It's also not cheap for a single slice of pizza.  I'd rather go across the street and get a slice of buffalo chicken pizza.  It's about the same price, but its' delicious, and 1 slice will leave me feeling very full.  Although, they do the same thing with letting their pies sit out all day.... it's best to get it fresh, but the buffalo chicken tends to go fairly quickly so that one is generally pretty fresh.
2013-12-31,4,Quality pizza. Especially after a late night of drinking- Basile's hit the spot. The margarita pizza was great and the pepperoni and sausage was even better.*Note- Basile's did NOT have gluten free options or take credit cards.
2013-12-26,5,Basile's Pizza makes Hoboken's best Pizza!!! If you like a thin crusted crunchy Pizza with the perfect amount of sauce then I suggest you try Basile's Pizzeria. Basile's  margarita pizza, buffalo pizza, and pepperoni pizza are personal favorites. Oh almost forgot, the 18" - 20" pies is bigger than most pies which are usually 16". The service is incredible and the sliding glass store front is awesome for dining during the summer months. The owner is a really great person and truly wants to insure customers are satisfied... Stop by with the family and/or friends... you won't be disappointed!!!
2013-12-22,1,Just tried ordering a large pie with one topping for delivery and the guy says $26.  I said a large pizza is $15 and one topping is $2 which should be $17.  He said there was a delivery fee of $2, which is fine, but that doesn't still doesn't add up.  I said it didn't and the guy said he doesn't have time for this.  I guess he didn't have time for math class either.  Always ask what the total is because these guys are scumbags.
2013-12-09,2,I have stopped at Basile's many times to grab a slice going to / from the PATH and always thought their pizza was pretty good.  I recently ordered deliver from them twice.  The first time everything was good - ordered a half cheese / half pepperoni, arrived hot & fresh and cost $20.  I ordered again last night - a half margarita / half pepperoni which cost $27 and arrived completely cold - it looked like they took the pizza that sits in the window cold that they normally heat when you order a slice and threw it in a box and set it to us cold.  I called Basile's and the woman who answered was very confused, put me on hold without telling me, and then a man came on (possibly the manager).  He was very nice and apologized but did not offer to do anything to remedy the situation. Instead he explained that they don't have their own delivery driver - they contract with a company that does the deliveries for them.  So he saw it as not his fault since the pizza was fresh out of the oven when they gave it to them.  We had already waited almost an hour for the pizza so I did not push to get a hot one instead we turned on the oven and heated it up ourselves.  But lesson learned will not order delivery from them since they can't control the service of the delivery.  Whoever they used must have drove around Hoboken for 20 minutes with the windows down or something.
2013-11-10,1,Had the worse experience EVER!!! Went to Basile's pizza for the first time last night. I bought a pie and paid $30.00 for it. I then asked one of the gentlemen working there if I can have som parm cheese. The guy began fight with me out of no where tell me that he wants the cheese back when I'm done using is and I better not steal it. I then replied that I just bought a $30.00 pie and am eating it in the restaurant and I can assure you I am not going to steal cheese. He finally left me use the cheese and when I was done using it I gave it back and said, "here see I did not steal it " the man them began to flip out on me for no apparent reason . The other workers had to calm him down. In my opinion I truly think he was drink !!! Horrible horrible horrible service !!! Do yourself a favor and never go there!!!
2013-11-07,5,AMAZING PIZZA! AMAZING STAFF!Their pizza is one of a kind.  The crust is absolutely delicious, which is big coming from an avid crust hater like myself.  I've never had a problem at Basile's, even at 3am on a weekend when it's super packed, I still get my pizza hot and in a timely fashion.  Basile's beats out all the many pizzerias in Hoboken.
2013-10-27,3,Decent place, not great.   Convenient location, fast, and 3.50 a slice.   Pizza is just....so so.    If anyone is listening I would spice it up a bit and adding a bit more cheese.I hope this place improves given its great location.
2013-10-23,5,The Pizza is Amazing and this is coming from a Real Italian Brooklyn boy.  Today I tried the Margarita and it was so Yummy, I love what they do to the crust! The Grandma is my favorite and if you want to treat yourself to the best slice in hoboken, I would try that one. It is in the perfect location only a few blocks from the PATH!
2013-10-03,5,Thin Crust / Fresh / Delivery / Nice People...this place is great!
2013-09-03,1,My friend bought pizza and asked for tap water, which he was denied. The representatives soon called the police and made a big brouhaha off the event. I'm not quite sure why this was necessary. I do not recommend. Boycott for free tap water!
2013-08-30,3,Got food here for lunch, lights are crazy bright, not much else to say.
2013-08-29,1,Aside from the fact that this place is brighter than the sun for literally no reason, they are terrible people. I will never give them a dollar again and you shouldn't either.
2013-08-29,2,Sometimes when I go out in the city, I drink.Sometimes when I drink, I get hungry.Sometimes when I get hungry, it is late.When there have been drinks, when I am hungry, and when it is late...the bright lights of Basile's carry me in.In what can only be described as a smoÃàrgaÃäsbord of nonsense, the all-for-one push your way to the front cut people from the side order from the street scream at the beverage cooler all-things-go attitude of this place keeps it pretty busy.  That, plus Balbo's is closed (boo) and Roma Pizza blends in with the bricks (and is overshadowed by Teak)...makes a post-PATH pizza stop here an almost certainty.The pizza is okayfinedecent; I find the crust a bit too crunchy and the cheese a bit too baked, but the sauce is decent and my obsession with getting cornmeal crumbs all over whatever I am wearing is taken care of with much gusto.Oh, and if you are waiting in line for 1324 hours to get Cake Boss...this is your closest food.Their ability to pump out pies and their geographical position in the bermuda triangle of pedestrians keeps the doors open, but in the land of seemingly infinite pizza choices, there is a better slice to be had.
2013-08-28,2,Pizza is just whatever... What a shame because it's in a great spot on Washington.It's usually pretty busy and it serves well for drunken slices but that's about it.  If you're looking for authentic, really good pizza this probably isn't your place... More of a grab a slice cause you're in a hurry and run type of jernt.
2013-08-16,5,Delicious pizza and really nice staff.  It's so close to the path and the only place I will go for pizza in Hoboken.
2013-08-15,2,Average pizza.  Below average service. It's an acceptable drunk food spot. Prices are at least fair, though, which is probably what did in their neighbor, Hoboken Pizza.Staff could be trained better.  In addition to handling money with their gloves on (and then serving food), they almost all seem to have attitudes. Probably won't visit again...sober.
2013-08-07,1,Worst pizza I ever had!!!!!! Tasted and looked like plastic. People work there are very nasty, plus they need a bath. Only people who go there are drunk and they do not know better. The lady behind the counter was no lady, let's just leave it at that. Worker mopped the floor than serve a man with the same gloves on. That's all I got folks because I ran out and prayed I didn't get sick!!!
2013-04-04,3,Decent slices but certainly not the best pizza you'll find in Hoboken. I like the crispy baked dough which is what they have here for their slices.
2013-03-10,4,Hand tossed. Good. Crispy. Not a fan of the sauce. Doesn't taste cooked prior to putting on pizza. Margarita no basil at request. Fresh tomatoes. Fresh mozz. Overall good.
2013-02-24,1,This place has a great location since it's down the street from the PATH train & local bars. That has to be the ONLY reason it's always packed. Only drunks & those shuffling home from a long commute would venture into this shame of a pizzeria. The cold bland dough they call pizza isn't worth the $2 prices. Take your two dollars & visit ANY of the other 15+ pizzerias on Washington & save your pallet from this abomination.
2013-01-26,1,In a town famous for many things, not least of which is its pizzerias, Basile's is a travesty of a pizzeria. Worse - it's a charade of an establishment pretending to be a pizzeria. The bright lights? Strategically placed to confuse your senses into thinking that you're consuming an actual pizza slice, and not cardboard with every semblance of taste stripped off. Just about the only saving grace is that this place is open when the bars close; drunk bros rushing home to post a review are the only reason this place has as many 5 star ratings as it does.1.5 stars, rounded down because places like Bennys, Gios, Grimaldis all lost a half a star just by being in the same town as this "pizzeria".
2013-01-04,1,I think the pizza is ok but the service is crap.  I have gone with my son and they have charged me $2.50 for a slice then after a mom's night out they charged me $3.00 for a plain slice my opinion of the workers here quickly changed.  My brother recently went in to ask for a plain slice with a little extra sauce and was willing to pay extra but the man behind the counter quickly yelled at him and told him they didn't want his business.  Who does that!!!!???/ Especially in an economy where businesses are failying and going out of business.  Their service is crap and their pizza is mediocre.
2013-01-01,1,Normally I write reviews when services is great...but on this one occasion I have to write this review....honestly If I could give it -5 stars I would.  I've gone to Basile's a million times since it's nearby and decent pizza.  While I enjoy the pizza for quite some time...the following issue happened.So basically the story goes like thisI walked into basile's and saw a plain slice.  I asked the guy if he could put extra sauce on it...Him - no extra sauceMe - give me any sauce even cold sauce.....Him - NoMe - Really?...Him - Get the F*** out if you have a problem with that.Me- are you kidding me?Him - get out we don't want you here, get the f*** out now.Me - Words I care not to say upon walking out.The problem with all of this is all managers or supervisors sat there and saw it all happen and yelled at me when I insulted the guy walking out...all cause he doesn't have extra sauce and told me to F*** off in front of all the customers....No offense but no customer deserves this kind of treatment.  I understand he may be upset he's working new years day, but to take it out on a customer and to have all the management(if any there) be ok with it...is just ridiculous.  I walked across the street and had a slice of plain without any issues...even asking for extra toppings...never have I ever been so demeaned in my life.
2012-10-28,5,Awesome Pizza, Awesome Location, Awesome people!  This story is kind of ridiculous but it's true: 2 months after getting married, my husband lost his ring in a hole in the sidewalk right next to the store.  The owner and a bunch of the guys at his store spent 1.5 hours helping him.  Hoboken's batman even stopped by to help.   Eventually, with Basile's vaccuum and batman's help, they were able to pull out my husband's platinum wedding band.
2012-10-20,2,Steady decline...Upon opening, Basile's offered a tasty, thin crusted slice that hit the spot both during regular dinner hours and for a late night snack. Now, you're lucky to get a lukewarm slice that won't break your teeth. The pizza clearly sits out for hours collecting dust on the corner of Washington...good thing there are ample alternatives for pizza in Hoboken.
2012-10-11,3,Eh, I'm not impressed but I'm not disapointed.  Its  a great spot for late night or a snack.  I am just sick of sub par pizza places in hoboken.  Can't we get a place that actually serves up a good slice
2012-10-05,5,Basile's has the BEST pizza in Hoboken, NJ !! I came out here from the West Coast and was in search of some really good pizza.....Basile's is the place! There was so much pepperoni on one slice of pizza, it was like heaven. The crust is unlike anything I've ever had.....it's crispy and delicious! The corner location is great because you can sit inside or outside and see everything that is going on all around you. I would recommend coming here if you're in town!
2012-10-01,5,I love pizza and there are a lot of options in Hoboken alone, let alone Jersey City & of course NYC. In Hoboken, there are only two places that make the perfect thin NY style pizza slice, and Basile's is one of them. The crust is amazing, tastes great and holds up. The cheese isn't oily and the toppings are very good. This place is excellent. Service is quick and to the point. A great place for a slice on the go!
2012-07-20,3,This is a hit or miss. Usually if you go here by mid afternoon you can get a really crispy slice. I noticed though that as the day progresses the pizza just sits and congeals into an unappetizing looking mess. At night my bf has brought home burnt slices that we ended up tossing in the trash. Also, at times the staff can be rude barking "Can I help you!!" They should put that energy into cleaning off the tables, dumping the garbage and putting more condiment shakers out. 1 red pepper shaker?
2012-07-10,2,It's great when you're desperate for something to eat -- particularly useful on those late nights out. Pretty cheap. It's on a corner right next to some of the best spots in Hoboken, and of course, near the train station. The pies have a tendency to sit around a rather long time. Unless it's a plain pie. Then chances are you might be getting something fresh.Some of the people that work there are okay, but a couple others drive me nuts.All in all, if you're in Hobs at a normal time during the week, there's way better places you can grab your slice at.
2012-07-09,4,Pick a slice from amongst the numerous on display a hard to miss corner near hoboken station. Your thin crust meal is reheated for you in 2 mins. Not a place with great ambience or seating, does not even accept cards! Whatever just grab ur slice and head to carlos fo a cannoli......
2012-07-03,2,Always packed because of it's corner location, you may think this is the best pizza in Hoboken. Unless you SEE them take the pie out of the oven, it probably won't be fresh. Sometimes the pies sit there all day. The bright lights are enough to give you a sun burn. I have never seen such bright lighting in all of my life. WTF??The tables are dirty as hell when you sit down to eat so clearly they are not concerned about customers opinions or cleanliness. Each TV hanging from the wall is blasting a different channel and if they have music playing at the same like (like they usually do) you can not hear a fucking thing. Plus, this place is BOILING HOT. Try to go naked or you will sweat to death. In this case, it is ALL about location and nothing more. Pffft
2012-06-02,3,Second review- I'll still go more positive than negative but there are noteworthy faults.The biggest fault is that if the pizza has been sitting around for longer than twenty minutes it starts to lose deliciousness and fast. This is NOT pizza you want leftovers of; if it is not fresh it turns to cardboard right quick.Service can be hit or miss. Some of the people that work at Basile's put a smile on my face when I see them; others, a scowl. Your best bet here is a plain slice. It probably hasn't been sitting around for long. Anything else, give a long hard look at. If you see the edges of any slices starting to curl up you are better off leaving it alone.
2012-06-01,4,Legit crispy thin delicious pizza. It's a quick place to stop on the way to the path. No walls, open air, but three tvs, so no ambiance. You are basically on the street. But for really good pizza on the go, this is the place. The crust is amazingly bubbly and thin and crispy. That is the best part. The cheese is definitely a bit greasy. But they do a great tomato basil.
2012-05-21,2,Meh, I've experienced better, about sums this place up. With soooo many great places to chose from for good Pizza in town, this place isn't one of them. Their location is awesome and they are probably making a killing of Suzy &  Chad Minivan and the soccer team visiting Carlo's. But the pizza quality isn't that great. I've tried it twice now and  only because the pizza actually looks really good it was tempting. But each time the flavor wasn't there. It was bland and like someone said before too "grainy". I shouldn't have to add salt to pizza for flavor.  They have a variety of different pies to choose from but I've tried a couple and they were all just kinda "meh" at best. I think this place is really our version of TGI Fridays for the tourists. They'll come in get a slice while on line and feel like  a local. I've heard a rumor, now just a rumor that it's owned by Carlo's Bakery...so who knows. The people inside of course are incredibly nice, but it's just not worth stopping in or ordering delivery, I'll stick with Napolis, Balbos and Bennys.
2012-05-21,5,Hands DOWN one of the BEST pizzas  I've had in a LONG time!!!  (I tried both the Marguerita and the Plain Cheese) The crust is thin and crispy and the slices are huge.   The owner, Russell Basile, was kind enough to donate pizza for about 30 people at the Relay For Life event in Hoboken this past weekend....  Not only are we extremely grateful for his generosity; we were blown away with the quality of his pizza.     MY NEW FAVORITE PIZZA SPOT IN HOBOKEN!!   Much success to Basile's!!!!!!!!!!!!
2012-05-17,2,Keeping it two stars.Stopped in early evening for a slice, which was a reheated slice that was blah. All the outdoor tables had breadcrumbs from previous customers  (and it was not busy at this time). The garbage can in the pizzeria was packed about 6 inches above the rim. There was paper plates underneath tables. With a dozen other pizzerias within walking distance, you have to do better than this for me to be a customer.
2012-05-12,3,Solid pizza. Love the crust. They have some good topping choices, and it always smells/looks amazing when I walk by. They don't take credit cards, at all. I understand that they want the bar crowd at night to pay cash, but when I'm ordering  $40 of pizza for dinner on a weeknight, it'd be very nice to use a credit card. Pizza is also pretty pricey for a standard Hoboken/NY area pizza place.
2012-04-23,5,Wow this pizza is the best around!  and haven't found anything that even comes close to this pizza! If your in the mood for pizza, this is the place to go! Yummy!
2012-04-23,5,Basiles in Hoboken has amazing pizza!!!! My favorite is the white slice. Its always fresh and the staff is always friendly. I love it there and would highly reccomend it!! Also when its warm out they offer outside seating! :)
2012-04-20,2,When they first opened I thought wow this is the best pizza in Hoboken. But after 3 months it seems that they have gone down hill. The suce has gotten skimpier as well as the cheese. In fact the last couple of times I tried them it seems like the toppings ended 2 thirds up the slice. I gave them 3 tries and three times they disappointed.
2012-04-09,2,Tried this place a few times now.  Good location with a lot of different toppings to choose from.  Unfortunately, the pizza just isn't very good.  It's grainy because of too much corn meal (I think its corn meal, whatever it is, its grainy).  The crust isn't really chewy or crispy.  The various toppings I've tried have lacked flavor.It's unfortunate, because so many out-of-towners waiting online for Carlos will think this is what pizza in Hoboken really tastes like.  It does not, or at least it should not.Pass on this one.  Cash only, ATM inside.
2012-04-05,5,Love it love it love it. Best thin crust with tasty toppings and cheap! Go to place for pizza in hoboken
2012-04-04,5,So glad my friends and I decided to stop at Basile's Pizza.  We had no idea there was a difference in the taste of New York Pizza and New Jersey Pizza.  We soon found out that there is and that we liked it.  The owner happened to be there and he was really friendly and explained to us the difference in NY pizza and NJ pizza.  We had the peperoni and the buffalo pizza.  They were both so good.  My friends had the grandma margarita's pizza and they loved it.  We were visiting from Houston and we definitely plan on going back to Basile's on our next trip to New York.  Worth the trip to Hoboken.
2012-03-27,4,So when me and my besty went to New York we checked out the infamous CAKE BOSS! and as we were waiting in line i grabbed a slice from this spot. For sure mom and pop run (includes children of all ages working lol) and the pizza was absolutely delicious!!!!! i would say, if your in the area, check er out!
2012-03-16,3,I've been here a few times.  It's nice when the weather is warm, but in the winter you're pretty much SOL on seating, so take it to go.  It's right on the corner near the Cake Boss bakery so it sees a ton of foot traffic--always busy, but always quick service.As for the pizza, it's very conditional--if you get a piece right out of the oven (and I mean you see them take it out, cut it, plate it, and hand it to you, then it can be delicious.  But more often than not, you're going to get a piece that's been sitting around.  No doors and all open space means one of two things: (1) in the winter the piece will be dried out from the cold and won't taste very good when they heat it up or (2) if it's hot out then you can bet your dollars to donuts that some fly or insect has given your slice a little extra sauce.  Either way, it's cheap eats and quick service.  Just wish the stars didn't have to align for that perfect slice :/
2012-03-12,3,nice little spot in hoboken for tasty pizzaon an unseasonably warm day for february, basile's had thrown open their window/drs and let the sunshine ini tried the nonna/grandmom - a square-cut, crisply thin-crusted slice of really good and garlicky tomato sauce and cheese pizza...definitely needed to blot some of that tasty oil off with some napkins, but it was really yummyi can see how this place gets busy by default b/c of its proximity to carlo's bakery (cake boss), but really, i think the pizza does stand on it's own3.5 stelle
2012-02-28,4,And the winner ... for best location in Hoboken goes to ... Basile's Pizza!!!Really .. could these guys have stepped in a bigger pile of it?? They have a corner location (restaurant gold) and the ever present tourist trap Carlo's Bakery next door ... so yeah, I know, they have to back it up ... and so far, they do.Take your pick - you want avocados on your pizza, I'm fairly positive that they can put it on ya ...Not a fan of their fountain soda ... quite syrupy ... and they need to be more careful this year about the flys taking a bite out of my pizza when they open up all those doors ...All in all ... it works
2012-02-22,4,yummy crust! They use panko bread crumbs underneath the crust which makes it so special.  good place for after the bars or coming back from the city for a quick slice on your walk home.  the white pizza is fantastic. I wish they delivered.  *Enjoy*
2012-01-25,4,Every day I pass Basile's coming off of the Path and must suppress the allure of their colorful pizza display and sizable strombolis.  I finally gave into temptation and purchased a slice of mushroom pizza.  Basile's, you make a damn good slice.The Crust:  Super thin and crispy, and does not flop under the weight of the toppings.  A nice touch - they sprinkle some cornmeal on the bottom of the crust to add an additional crunch (similarly to Pizza Hut, but better).The Sauce:  Pleasantly sweet, but not overbearingly so, a very nice compliment to the crust.The Cheese:  This is where a star was lost.  All of the pizzas that were sitting in the window were cold and despite having my slice reheated, it still maintained that cold-cheese texture.  That being said, I feel the need to order a fresh pie from Basile's to judge their cheese in a different light.  I expect good things.
2012-01-24,3,Try the square grandma slice.  Tasty marinara sauce shines through!  Wish the crust was crunchier.
2012-01-24,5,FINALLY good pizza in my part of Hoboken. The owner is an amazingly nice man that has sat and talked with us on multiple occasions. The pizza is great - try the fresh mozz/tomato one. MMMmmmm.
2012-01-19,1,I do not want to say much, but when they first opened, it was really really good. The crust was crusty, cheese was yummy and the pizza tasted fresh. After 3 months, I got two slices today; margarita and a sausage, it was the worst pizza I have ever had. Crust was soggy, pizza smelled like bad old oil, cheese tasted like the cheese from taco bell taco except melted. A plain bread with some regular cheese would taste better than this. When I think about it now, it's not just the worst pizza I have ever had, it might be the worst food I have ever had.
2011-12-26,3,Great crispy crust pizza, solid assortment of toppings. It's nice to have a place that's open air and open late right near the path. I'd say it's better than any other late night pizza options in Hoboken but I need a another camera angle to confirm the the call on the field.
2011-12-22,5,What a great slice. thin and crispy.  Grandma slices are amazing.  FYI they are supposed to have a nice amount of garlic on it.Great place, keep it up.  $6 for a sausage roll is a lot but hey they gotta pay the rent in that primo location.For the lady who gave 1 star..... Go breastfeed at home.  You didnt even order there, just walked in to do your thing.  Its a place of business.
2011-12-20,5,Oh Basile's, you had me at first bite... I dream of your thin crispy crust and delicious toppings. Your warm gooey cheese and salty pepperoni... mmm... until we reunite, I can only dream, and dream I will.Basile's pizza shop serves pizzas by the slices and also serves whole pies. You step inside their small shop and see big slices of NY style pizza being displayed in front of a glass window. Point and choose what slices you want and they'll throw it in the oven and heat it up for you for about 5 minute. Everything looked amazing! It was really hard making a decision but I ended up picking the chicken and pepperoni. Being a chicken-topping newbie, I never knew the magic of it. And now, wow, I don't know if I can even eat pizza without chicken on it. Basile's you made a chicken-topping lover out of me! Their crust was perfectly crisp and toppings were absolutely delicious. So much so that in my 3 day stay in Hoboken, I went there twice!I don't know even know of I can eat pizza from Cali again.
2011-12-03,4,My first NJ slice - not bad! In fact pretty good compared to my usual Brooklyn hangout. It was completely open to the street on one side due to nice weather, and a pidgin wandered in....
2011-10-17,5,This place is for crispy pizza lovers. Now I actually enjoy eating the crust! The tomato sauce is fresh and sweet tasting. I've had the sicilian, sausage and plain slices, which were all delicious. Basile's is cheap, fast and tasty.Russell is the owner who is always there overlooking his staff. He makes sure that all customers are satisfied and very often gives away free slices. Plans are in the works to expand into that god awful burrito place next door. Hopefully we can have inside seating for the upcoming cold weather!Check basiles out, you wont be disappointed.
2011-10-17,1,Pizza was mediocre at best and the woman behind the counter was beyond rude! I wont ever go back!
2011-10-10,3,Decent pizza, decent prices, great location, open late.  Can't really go wrong.This isn't the kind of meal one really needs to dissect--like I said, it's decent pizza for those who want something cheap and quick.But if it's analysis you seek, here goes:-- Love the crust.  Has that awesome seeded/crispy feel that really adds something special.  It's also a big step up from a lot of the late night/mass-quantity pizza places that tend to have doughier-crust.-- What's on top, however, is fairly mediocre.  The red sauce, in particular, has virtually no flavor.  It's slightly sweet, but it lacks the "zest" you really expect from a great slice of pizza.
2011-10-01,2,This place looks nice and that is about it.  I stopped in to try the new pizza place and was disappointed as usual with Hobokens pizza offerings.  The only reason people like this place is because they have been gorging themselves on crappy pizza from Hoboken Pizza and Impostos.  Basile's is only one step up.  Its just a generic rip off of a low grade NYC pizzeria.  The crust is way to crispy and dry for me.  I feel it sucking all the moisture out of mouth as I eat it.  Then its almost like they have a vat of oil that they just throw on top of it when it comes out.  I don't even want to know how much sodium is in a slice of their pizza.  I was sucking down water for 2 hours after I got eating here.  Greasy Salty pizza to hide the low quality pizza they make.  Hooboken really needs to wake up and figure what good pizza is.  The only reason places like Impostos and Basile's will stay open is because of their location and drunks passing by at night that don't have the palette for a quality slice.
2011-10-01,3,This is good pizza.  Would not say the best.  The crust is thin and very crispy.  Too crispy.  You better make sure you have something to drink while you are eating two slices.  The pizza also could use more cheese that is also less greasy.
2011-09-22,5,Excellent pizza with the most amazing crispy crust- I can't stop thinking about it...we split 4 slices just to try things out...one better than the next! The Nona, delicious sicilian square, really liked their sauce, then tried eggplant pizza...thinly sliced pieces, just the way I like it...then had fresh buffalo mozzarella and tomato pizza with basile...amazing, you will have to go and try them all! Best pizza I've had in a while.The setting is also pretty cool...fun spot in lively part of Hoboken, and one more thing...the service is great and the place is well kept; clean and all...I am going to bring the kids next time for sure!!
2011-09-17,2,Their red sauce tastes like it's made with the cheapest can of tomato. Pie tastes okay but it's overcooked.
2011-09-14,5,Decided to check this place out after class with my roommate tonight because we were excited to see a new pizza place open up right around the corner from us - all the surrounding pizza places are just downright awful.  Anyway, I got a slice of the red pie and my roommate got a slice of the white pie.  The sauce on mine was great and the crust was perfectly crispy.  My roommate loved her slice as well - she was digging the ricotta.  The best part about our experience?  We got to sit down with the owner and some of his staff.  This guy knows what he's doing and he's also super friendly and enthusiastic about opening up here in town.  Everyone was so nice!  The service was great.  We're both super psyched to have this place around the corner - it'll be our new go-to place when we want a delicious, cheap slice of pizza within walking distance.
