2021-10-22,5,First time visiting and would definitely recommend and return next time we are in Jersey. Staff was very accommodating. We had our infant son with us and staff welcomed us right in and got us a spot where we could park our stroller next to our seats. Food was great. Ambiance was great and staff were amazing. Not one bad thing to mention here!
2021-10-13,5,Can't go wrong with this spot! Pizza definitely is up to par with most other hoboken spots. I was especially surprised with the pasta, and would come back for just that. The prices are kinda high but they meet the general prices of other places in the area as well as the quality of ingredient !
2021-10-09,4,Great Hoboken pizza. On a pizza and casual Italian food tour or Hoboken, and this pizza and chicken parm was great. Would definitely give this place a shot if you haven't already.
2021-10-02,3,Stumbled upon this place on a Saturday night when everywhere else was packed / fully booked.Overall OK experience - OK food, nice ambiance, good service.Tried their weekly specials:Drunken Mussels - With butter, garlic, dijon mustard, lemon juice and red pepper flakes, in a white wine sauce,served with two toast points - pretty fresh mussels, very buttery and garlicky sauce - way too salty though.The Half Moon - Homemade ciabatta bread stuffed withbuffalo chicken parm, red onions, tomatoes and lettuce, served with french fries and a side of buffalo aioli - bit disappointed with this one, the bread is too tough and you need a saw to cut it.Pumpkin Ravioli - With grilled chicken in sage brownbutter sauce and parmigiana reggiano - WOW! Loved the raviolis! The pumpkin flavor really shines through and it almost tasted like a dessert with the hint of sweetness which complimented the cheese and sauce very well. The chicken unfortunately was bit too tough/dry though.The ambiance is good - the indoor space is actually open all around, so it's just like outdoor with roof over your head - great for COVID cautiousness.
2021-09-08,2,We live in the area and the food is very good. However the service was horrible and they charged us 2.50 for a side of ranch dressing which I've never seen a restaurant do in my entire life. What a rip off. That is just scamming people. We would've went back but after that I doubt it.
2021-07-03,4,4.5 stars if I could!! Really enjoyed my experience at Johnny Pepperoni's. Came here on a Thursday night for dinner while it was pouring so we had to sit inside (the outdoor area looks really cute though)! We were seated right away with only two other tables of people. The atmosphere is really cute, it's not a fancy place but is cute for a more casual date night or out with family/friends. The neon pizza sign is a great photo op if you're out with people you haven't seen in a while! Started with the Burrata special and it was delicious - very fresh ingredients. I suggest ordering one per every 2 guests as it was just enough to split. I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs. The spaghetti was cooked al dente very well. The meatballs were very large but had a little too much breadcrumbs for my liking. Sauce was very good. My friend ordered the Bolognese which I loved. Pasta was also cooked very well (penne). The meat was chopped finely, some veggies (carrots), sauce and fresh basil to top it off. BYOB!! They are thinking of investing in wine glasses but currently do not have any. They do have smaller water glasses they will provide for alcohol! The portions are just enough to be full but not overstuffed which I like. The waitstaff was very friendly but it seemed to take a little long to receive our meal and check despite being empty. Other then that, I am looking forward to returning!
2021-06-20,3,The ambience and restaurant and service was great! The pizza was okay, cheese was awesome but sauce and crust were average.
2021-06-09,5,Loved the burrata plate & calamari. The pizza was great, the only thing that I wish they had was alcohol!
2021-05-30,4,A great spot uptown for residents who love pizza, I highly recommend their square pie which you can have 10+ toppings half and half even, they will accommodate, it's a nice family run business and always enjoy it when I'm in the mood for a different style of pizza and most other places provide a thin crust which they also have but once in a while you want to change it up, there is plenty of dining space and family friendly indoors and outdoors, there is parking but no garage nearby, they accept cash or  and they do not sell individual slices.
2021-04-26,2,For the price, it's not worth it. I got the eggplant parm that was okay and a way over priced salad that had soggy veggies for $35. There's plenty of other spots with higher quality food.
2021-04-24,5,Love the square pizza.  Has the right thickness and texture.  Delivery has always been quick.  The pasta dishes are very good also.
2021-03-20,5,This place is a gem. Best wings I've ever had. Get the wings, rigatoni vodka, and ricotta bruschetta. Everything is delicious and very reasonably priced. Service is always excellent and they are always accommodating with any requests. Owner is also great too and owns City Bistro which is a nearby if you want to grab a drink before or after. Highly recommend.
2021-03-01,4,Solid pizza and knowledgeable staff. Answered allergen questions with confidence. Cheese pizza comes in 14' for round and 16' for square. Round includes some fresh mozzarella, basil and you can taste garlic. It's good. Buffalo wings and meaty and well made. Will order again. The dough doesn't have egg, soy, sesame or nuts if anyone concerned.
2021-02-11,3,Went because of positive Yelp reviews.Food is just okay. We had a pizza and the chicken parm. The pizza was kind of dry. BYOB and very cute outdoor patio. Friendly service.
2021-01-30,5,I absolutely love this place! We love 2 blocks away, and I never ordered from it for years because I thought the name was so silly. However, so neighbors told us they had the best pizza in Hoboken, so we tried it one time and were totally hooked. I love the pepperoni pizza with roasted mushrooms the best, but their pastas are wonderful too! We alternate between the pizza, and the shrimp pasta, with the sausage and rigatoni thrown in every now and then for variety, and it never fail to deliver a GREAT dinner.
2021-01-25,5,I was craving for good pizza on Sunday night and then found this place. Very cool Italian decor inside, food is amazing. White Pizza with mushrooms I would say one of the best I've tried. Very thin crust, right amount of cheese. Our server was welcoming and friendly. The only downside is BYOB restaurant, so expect to see only soda on the menu.
2021-01-10,2,Expensive for mediocre food. Got a pepperoni square pie and arancini balls. Pizza was superrr salty.
2021-01-05,5,During this pandemic, I have ordered from Johnny Pepperoni more often than any other restaurant in Hoboken. By far their service has exceeded my expectations, and I must say I always look forward to getting my personalized shopping bag with my items every time! They are terrific and the food is amazing! I would highly recommend the radicchio salad with grilled chicken! I don't know what they put in their dressing, but I want that secret recipe!
2020-12-01,5,They messed up my address so it took me a lot longer to get the order but Lauren did her best to rectify and for that they deserve the 5 stars and for the great pizza!
2020-11-03,5,Johnny Pepperonis has been one of my mainstays during the covid era.  While I have yet to personally dine there during this time, I have done multiple order pick-ups and deliveries, and each has been on point, accurate, warm, and just as good as if you were eating in the restaurant.   Can't get Johnny Peps without ordering their wings - IMO the best wings in Hoboken.  They are a little breadier than I generally like, but it really works for these wings.  The breading isn't too thick, and it's the perfect level of crispy - and the buffalo sauce is really tasty!  An order of wings comes with blue cheese or ranch (i opt for blue cheese here, but it's $1 for extra sauce) and also come with some celery.   My go to pizza option is the Mushroom fontina;  If you ask my husband, he'd pick the square pie.  If I'm in the mood for pasta, I know I can't really go wrong - the pasta is always cooked perfectly al dente also.
2020-10-04,4,Stopped by last night since the wait at Otto Strada was an hour & 45 minutes and we wanted to dine somewhere nearby that was also BYO.  Johnny pep's menu isn't as interesting as Otto Strada or Napolis but we were able to get seated without a wait and the service was good and friendly.  We shared the baked shrimp scampi to start which comes with 6 shrimp and two garlic toasts which were great for dipping In the scampi sauce.  Since we couldn't decide on a pizza to share, we each got pasta dishes.  I had the fusilli vodka which had a lot of sausage and chunks of mozz. My friend had the grilled ratatouille without olives. She said the sauce had a little kick.  We both enjoyed our dishes and had leftovers to take home since the bowls were huge.
2020-09-25,2,I usually love this place. But we ordered delivery for the first time and they dropped off the pizza and didn't let us know so it was sitting downstairs for long enough that it was luke warm at best when I finally just went down to check on it. At that point the app, Slice, still said it wasn't going to be delivered for another 15 minutes! When I called to complain, I tried asking whether this was a Johnny Pepperoni problem or a Slice problem- so I would be complaining to the wrong people.  They met my question with utter confusion. When I finally explained that I was not notified and got cold pizza,  I wasn't offered any reconciliation. I'd say this manager didn't seem to care that I was a dissatisfied customer at all. She said she'd speak to their delivery drivers. But no offering of how to make the situation right for the current customer who waited 2 hours for pizza that was just sitting downstairs getting cold. There are a lot of pizza places in Hoboken...if you're looking for delivery, you'd do better to order from any other.
2020-09-09,5,Favorite pizza in Hoboken! Tons of cheese and fresh toppings. The kind of pizza you have to eat with a fork and knife.
2020-08-16,5,Absolutely love this place.  Its BYOB, so bring your own bottles of vino, just dont go to Yash wine store - its a rip off.  I ordered a create your own meat-a-tarian pizza which was amazing.  Our service was top notch.  You must ask for Richie - he was super nice, and attentive and went out of his way to provide the most excellent customer service.  I will go back again.
2020-07-26,5,Stopped off for a late lunch whilst on a bike ride. Superb and friendly service. Excellent pizza with fresh toppings. Definitely recommend.
2020-07-11,5,I've lived in Hoboken for over five years and this is hands down my favorite spot. Great food, great service and love that it's BYOB. The bolognese and Caesar salad are my favorite. Absolute Hoboken gem!
2020-06-08,4,I've always passed this place, but never walked inside... not idea why. However now it has become our new pizza spot!! The prosciutto arugula pizza was so good. Just how I like it. My boyfriend and I also ordered two sandwiches because we love leftovers. The sandwiches were delicious but they were a little on the smaller side. Take a look at the pic for reference. I guess we were thinking it would be more of a sub or hero... so we were happy we ordered pizza too. The sandwiches came with salad that always actually pretty good for a side salad. Had like onion-y dressing which was tasty. Overall, great experience! Looking forward to ordering from there again.
2020-04-12,4,Been to Johnny Pepperoni's only twice but enjoyed both experiences.The two experiences I had at Johnny pepperoni's were very different. The first we ordered one or two apps (the burrata with prosciutto was *chefs kiss*) and a bunch of pies to split. That's the way to go in my opinion. I'd recommend the Mushroom & Fontina pie, and the Sausage & Broccoli Rabe.When I returned for my second visit, my group had a different approach. Many wanted their own entrees, so splitting pies was regrettably off the table. A few ordered chicken and fish dishes and seemed satisfied but not overly thrilled. I sampled the chicken parm which I surprisingly did not love. Mussels appetizer was fine. Arancini was good. Tip: go with a group and order a bunch of pizzas. Bring wine (BYOB!!) and enjoy yourself. Solid Hoboken spot, great little environment as well.
2020-03-30,5,Pizza craving during self quarantine ??? Johnny Pepperoni hit the spot! Sicilian- absolutely delicious crust- crunchy and tasty- they must add extra oil to that  crust. So darn good. The  sauce is super flavorful and fresh and the CHEESE! Yum- I love my pizza slightly well done cheese slightly burnt ..... Well this exceeded my expectations - oh yeah my husband also got wings which were very good. It was a nice treat to help us a Ben just for a moment forget what we are all dealing with. I also purchased come cold beer from  the liquor store - perfect compliment  - support local businesses if you can and enjoy a few moments of normalcy.
2020-02-17,4,My friends and I are on a mission to go to every pizza place in Hoboken and rate their cheese pie out of 10. Overall experience was good. Vibes inside the restaurant was great and pizza overall was crispy and tasted well. Not the most mind blowing pizza I ever had but it was above average. Our average score was 7/10.Will return again after we try the other 33 spots!
2020-02-06,1,There was a STINK BUG in our food! I went to Johnny Peps 1/31/20 with a group of 8 people for a 9:30 reservation. I want to start off by saying I love their food and always took out of towners here. Reasonable prices, good food, BYOB, nice staff. I even feel bad giving it 1 star. BUT apps came out, there was a stink bug in the baratta, crawling on its back covered in cheese. The waitress was calm and non-chalant and asked us if we still wanted to continue eating there, which seemed odd. We ultimately chose to leave for obvious reason. Yes i'm upset about the bug and that I'll never go to one of my spots again, but i'm more upset at how it was handled. I didnt even have a manager or a chef come over and apologize, no one offered a free meal,it was like it wasn't a big deal. As a local, I'm sure as hell telling everyone I know not to go here.
2020-01-31,5,My wife and I just moved to Hoboken and we were looking for some new places to enjoy. We found Johnny pepperoni because who doesn't need to have their designated pizza place a quick call away? Turns out it was way more than just that. We started off with some shrimp scampi and calamari and for our entrees we split a perfect square pizza with pepperoni and a penne bolognese. Absolutely amazing!!! We are so excited to make this restaurant a staple in our routine. On a side note- when my wife and I moved here from Massachusetts, we had plenty of warnings on watching out for New Jersey people being blunt and mean. Well... I don't know where those people are but they are NOT employed at this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised by the overwhelming kindness and patience coming from the hosts seating us and taking our info. From there, our server was funny and happy and she made us feel right at home. All the servers were extremely helpful and had great team work to keep the wheels turning. IF the food was horrible, we would still give it  a second chance because of the atmosphere and the staff. Thanks again Johnny pepperoni! Be back soon!
2020-01-24,5,I had been wanting to try Johnny Pepperoni for a long time, despite hearing mixed reviews, ranging from "eh, it's ok" to "best salmon ever".  So, when I found a local friend that also had been meaning to visit the restaurant, we decided to go there for dinner.  The space resembled a casual pizzeria with red and white checkered tablecloths, but the menu and something about the overall atmosphere made it seem more upscale than you standard "by-the-slice" kind of place.  The service was attentive and friendly, though they could have been more helpful with the wine my friend had brought with her.  (The restaurant was BYOB.)  As much as the provided, doughy bread basket taunted me, I was able to refrain from having a slice.  Instead, I focused my sights on my Chicken al Diavolo entreé, which was unreal!  The portion was a half of a small chicken, which was marinated and cooked until it was extremely tender.  The poultry was served over a warm salad of roasted onions and vinegar peppers, and all of this was seasoned with chili flakes and paprika.  It was spicy, tangy, sweet, and acidic.  Though I typically do not like onions, the caramelized vegetables were so flavorful and the portion so generous, that I did not miss having a heavier, starchier side dish.  Johnny Pepperoni surpassed my expectations, and I look forward to going back to try their large pizza pies.
2019-12-17,1,First time in New York and wanted to try some decent NY pizza so I look this place up, and walked 5 blocks just to find they are close at 8pm when they are supposed to be open until 10pm. I'm from the south, walking in 30 degree weather for no reason isn't my thing. Communication when prospective customers is the least you can provide . A simple post would do.
2019-12-16,1,I love the pizza from Johnny Pepperoni but I was extremely disappointed with them last night. We ordered 2 pizzas (and 2 salads) for delivery at 6:20pm and were given a 40 minute estimate. After waiting for an hour I called the restaurant and was told that our order was out for delivery ands should be there any minute. After another 30 minutes still no food. I called back and was told that it was still out for delivery and would be there soon. We finally got our food a little after 8pm, a full hour later than the delivery estimate we were originally given and the pizza was cold and had clearly been sitting in the car for a long time. Really disappointed by the experience and I will definitely think twice before ordering again.
2019-12-12,4,Nice place with outdoor seating option- perfect for spring / summer.   Food was good and enjoyable time with a group for brunch.  Recommend if you're in the area
2019-11-16,5,I love the pizza at Johnny Pepperoni.Moved to Hoboken about a year and a half ago and  there are only two places that I would go for pizza and they are both tied for first! Absolutely delicious! Mike Hartman
2019-11-08,5,Updated review: moved from 4-5 stars. Why you ask? Well thank you, I'll tell you: Chicken Parmesan Pizza with Vodka sauce, side of meatballs and BYOB. NOT HATING IT. In fact, arguably the best pizza I've ever had.
2019-11-05,5,Loved it! Family friends BYOB. Great food and wonderful for families. Simply great food!
2019-09-06,2,Very mediocre pizza and pasta. Agree with other reviews that this place is kid-city and very loud. Great that it is BYOB and friendly staff. However, food is sub-par. Barstool prez gave the pizza 7.something and I would highly disagree.
2019-08-11,5,Johnny Peps is the best pizza in Hoboken! Their service is always superb as it relates to us crazy families with toddlers. They are always super accommodating, happy and just an overall pleasure to go to every time. It's hard to feel welcomed at restaurants when you have a toddler but they time and time again are the best! Besides the pizza the Bolognese sauce and graham cracker ice cream are to die for!
2019-08-08,3,I have to say I think this place has gone downhill. Tonight's dinner just solidified that I will not return to this place. The pizza lacks flavor, just topped with too many pepperonis that make it extremely salty and some of the greasiest pizza I've ever had. One of the people I. My party had the meatballs. They tasted like saw dust - absolutely not flavor and a very strange consistency. This used to be a decent place to eat, but I feel like it's gone downhill. Very disappointing.
2019-07-02,4,Pretty pretty good.  The outdoor seating is solid, but on Friday and Saturday nights till about 630 it's kid-city.  Parents letting kids run aroud.  I've witnessed several kids cracking their head on the pavement while parents enjoy the BYOB.  Very loud when sitting inside.Food is good.  I enjoy the white pizza with mushrooms with some red sauce on the side for dipping, as well as the square pie.  I've had the chicken parmesan before and wasn't impressed, so stick with the pizza.Delivery is good, but the pie always seems smaller when delivered...may just be my imagination.
2019-06-02,5,The staff was very welcoming to me coming in very sweaty after riding my bike. They sat me down by the tv since I was all alone and gave me the choice of what to put on. Hospitality, five stars.The food I noticed while riding by because of the overload of pepperoni on some guests pies I saw sitting in the outside dining area. The pepperoni curled with pools of grease in the cup shape that the good kind of pepperoni makes mmmmm. The sauce was thick and flavorful too. So heavy that I could only finish half of a small pie. To me, that's a good thing. Very good thing. Food, five stars.
2019-05-19,2,The saltiest pizza ever. Hypertension style salty. Not a fan of the semi hard crust edges. Will not be able to tolerate eating this pizza ever again. Review is strictly on the food & nothing else. Also, absolutely very difficult to get parking
2019-04-03,1,Had a very unfortunate experience tonight while trying to place an order for delivery.A man named Dominick had answered the phone, where I then placed an order for my favorite square pie that I order quite often. I then asked if they had french fries, and placed an order of French fries with cheese on the side. When I asked for cheese, he laughed in disgust, and said what?? Cheese on the side??? Not sure how that's going to work out for you... When I repeated the order under the assumption he just didn't hear me correctly, he then proceeded to say "we aren't a diner, we are an Italian restaurant, we don't do that here." A simple no, we don't have that would have sufficed. The belittling and rude tone of voice and response was enough to have me never return back here again. Unfortunate, because this was one of my favorite spots in town.
2019-03-23,5,Very good, seems to be underrated among Hoboken pizza places. Have never had a bad pie here and the ambiance of the place is great. Waiters are really nice and attentive too.
2019-03-17,2,Ordered a large pie (half plain/half sausage). This is not a large pizza (only 6 slices), and most of the sausage is on 1 slice. Awful experience
2019-03-16,1,Its unbelievably rude that as a neighbor of the restaurant I call for a table and when I show up literally two minutes later the table has been given away. Zero courtesy given. Clearly not a neighborhood restaurant.
2019-03-10,4,Pizza was excellent! Make sure to ask for extra toppings. Only a little amount is put on
2019-02-24,4,Tried it last week after reading the great reviews. The pizza lived up to the hype and we'll definitely be back (from a total pizza is everything person). I'm now curious to try there pasta and rest of the menu.
2019-02-09,4,Consistent quality, popular spot with the locals and I can see why...sauce was a little heavy on the pizza but overall a solid pie!
2019-01-19,5,We did our sons first birthday there !! It was fantastic from start to finish , highly recommend. Everyone was amazing ! Thanks Mr. Pepperoni !
2019-01-06,5,My husband and I visited on a Friday night and we got sat immediately. We ordered the shrimp scampi app, a pepperoni pizza and the spaghetti with clams. The shrimp app was literally the best shrimp scampi ever and the sauce they made with it was so good that we couldn't stop dipping our bread in it. My husband was joking that it was so good he wanted to drink it. The pizza was great and the pasta was amazing. Fresh clams and it was light and delicious. The restaurant is BYOB which we weren't aware of but that didn't stop us from having a great time. Wish there was a CA location!
2019-01-04,5,Best pizza I have had in a while. I ordered the Square pizza with half pepperoni. Out of this world. The fresh cheese and sauce along with the pepperoni, fantastic. This is only makes me want to dine in there one night. I got this delivered and it was still a top pizza. Big fan and would certainly go back
2018-12-22,3,Me and three friends came here for dinner last night- being a Friday night we knew it was going to be busy. We got there and put our name down they told us it was going to be about 30-45 minutes, which we were fine with!  My friend lives a block away so we went back to her apt to wait since they said they would call us. Once they called us we headed straight back. When we got there they told us our table had paid already and they were getting up shortly. After 15/20 min of waiting we asked when our table was going to be ready. One of the hosts gave us a dirty look and rudely said "when the people get up." We waited another ten minutes and they told us again that our table was paying. They clearly gave our first table to other customers, as it doesn't take a half hour to pay a bill.  Once we sat down the service was pretty slow, but fine. Everyone seemed to enjoy there meal.We ended up speaking to a manager about the rude host. And he was very nice and understanding. It seems this host had been complained about before. They ended up taking off one of our apps which was nice of them.
2018-12-14,5,Let me start by saying that my wife and I are pizza connoisseurs. We know a good pizza when we SEE it. Yes, I said "SEE". After recently moving to the area, we spent a few weeks scrolling Yelp for various local pizza shops. We'd vigorously look through photos, assessing whether or not a spot was doing it right, before finally committing to anything. When I saw the photos for the square pie at Johnny's, I knew it had to be good. We placed the order and the pizza arrived in no time. We went with pepperoni, hot peppers, onions and basil as our toppings. Almost immediately we began comparing this place to some of our favorites in the city (ex: Prince Street Pizza, Adrienne's). The pizza was well sauced ("juicy" in my wife's words), generously topped and perfectly cooked. We were very satisfied after only 2 slices and had leftovers to last us a few days. We're happy to know we now have a go-to spot that we can order-in and enjoy to the same degree we enjoy places that require the good ole' New York City effort to get to.
2018-12-09,2,Went here once and have not returned since. Ordered pasta and for the price I paid, the quality was not there. It was too seasoned, not hot, and just didn't feel high quality. I've heard the pizza is better, though.On top of that, the service was pretty bad. Busy night sitting outside but the servers were not polite at all - rushing to get people in and out and barely taking a second to look you in the eye.
2018-12-02,5,My husband and I LOVE it here. Not only is the food delicious, but the service is impeccable. Tonight we came in close to closing and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Dominic was incredible. We really wanted a caprese salad which wasn't on the menu, but he made it happen! Despite the late hour on a Sunday he was so sweet and attentive, which has been our experience with all staff at Johnny's. It so wonderful to have such a gem so close in our neighborhood.
2018-10-30,3,Pizza was veryy good. But their pesto pasta and chicken parm spaghetti was simply edible. It seems like they dont cook their sauces enough (pesto tasted like very fresh basil, tomato sauce tasted like tomato soup). Baked clams was burnt a bit.... but 3 stars cuz i will def go back for their pizza
2018-10-04,4,The pizza is great! They don't serve alcohol there and coincidentally every time we've been there, there are a ton of kids inside. You can sit outside to avoid the noise if its nice out.
2018-09-28,4,I came here with a group of friend on a Saturday night. Six of us split 2 pies and two dessert pies as well. Really good place and the price was great. The decor inside and red checkered table cloths remind me of the old school pizzerias from the 1960's. Really cool spot, i would definitely come back in the summer and sit outside and have my meal in their outdoor seating area.
2018-09-27,5,Hands down my favorite pizza in Hoboken, Napoli's and tenth street are close 2nds.I always order the round pie with pepperoni and I always joke that there is a ton of pepperoni because of the name of the restaurant.There's something about the dough, you'll definitely want to eat the crust on this pie. Also there's two types of cheeses on the pies. Just amazing all around.
2018-09-07,5,This place never disappoints. Best pepperoni pizza hands down. Pastas good too. Delivery is on point. BYO
2018-09-04,5,This is our favorite go to! The food is consistently great and so is the service. Cozy Byob. We've had many birthdays and celebrations here and we are always very pleased with our experience.
2018-08-18,5,The food is amazing - we got calamari (best we've ever had), spaghetti and meatballs and chicken piccata - grand slam. The service is also great.
2018-08-18,5,Great great place to eat for brunch or dinner. Service is excellent and the food is even better !  You won't be disappointed!  These people care about giving you the best possible restaurant experience!!
2018-08-15,5,This was the best Sicilian pizza I've had in a long time! The regular circle pizza was also delicious, with fresh mozzarella melted to perfection! It's not a huge place but the ambiance is homey, classic Italian family style. They do have a bar and TVs for those interested. Service was very fast, which was perfect for our hungry diners. Our waiter was always attentive, checking on us and filling our waters as needed. Five adults shared two salads (green and radicchio) and two pizzas, with a bunch of leftover slices! (visited 8/11/18)
2018-07-24,5,Too notch pizza makes me want to come here every day,  different style but works and is juicy and crunchy on the bite
2018-07-23,1,The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Where to begin. Show up with a party of 12, the service was very slow and they brought out the food at different times. One person in my party was given the wrong food three times and by the third time just decided to eat it because everyone else was done with their food. There was only one other table in there so it shouldn't have been as chaotic as it was. As if that isn't frustrating enough, the three people who paid with their card were overcharged. Two out of the 3 people were charged $141.73 extra!!!!! The third person was charged 35 dollars extra. Called my credit card company who then called Johnny pepperoni and all I was told was that I had to wait because that transaction for the extra 141.73 wasn't showing. My credit card company thought this was a less than satisfactory response and then told me that they were going to cancel my card and investigate for fraud. If you want to get charged almost 150 dollars additionally while paying with your card and don't mind slow service and incompetence then this place is for you. It's truly a shame because the food is good. But it is definitely not worth this headache!!!!! I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE!
2018-07-22,2,Food is good, but if you have a party over 4 don't come. Also don't come for Brunch, they're clueless and my friend had to send back his meal 3 times. In addition they brought out the meals one by one, some people were left waiting 15-20 mins before other person got their meal. Waiter was nice and knocked some items off which was cool of him but I wouldn't come back for items listed earlier.
2018-07-13,5,Living in Hoboken, there are more than your normal selection of Italian restaurants and pizza places to go to. Johnny Pepperoni quickly became our go-to place and is now the only place we go for this type of food. The food is excellent (both in restaurant and delivery). Delivery especially is always faster than estimated and the food always comes hot! Highly recommend trying this place out!
2018-07-13,1,I'm writing this about one negative experience I had recently, and very much hope it was an outlier. But I felt it was important to post this so that the restaurant may handle the situation differently if it happens again. (I've actually never written a bad yelp review, but I felt pretty strongly that they should be called out for this).A friend was having their birthday at Johnny P's, a group of about 20 people were invited for a 7pm reservation. Inside, there are a bunch of open tables to the left, and one couple is still dining at a four-top to the right. At 7:20PM or so, we start asking why we haven't been seated yet, and are told that it's because they need to set up the long table for 20 on the righthand side, and that couple is still finishing up. But, they've asked for the check so it shouldn't be much longer.7:30, the couple is still sitting there and 20 people are still waiting outside. There were two hostesses and a bunch of servers. There's still plenty of space on the left, but we're told that they can't set up the long table there for some reason. Okay, whatever. 7:45, the couple is at the table, having paid the check, with a takeout bag, just sitting and finishing their drinks. Me: "Are they aware that they're the reason we can't sit down? Like has anyone told them that? Because if it were me and I found that out, I'd be like, oh my god I had no idea, I'm so sorry!" H1 "Yeah, it's just that they're regulars so I don't know if anyone wanted to tell them that".Me "I mean, I don't care, I'LL go over there and say, 'hey I'm sorry to bother you, I'm with a group and we're just waiting on your table to turn over to get seated, is there any chance you can finish your drinks at the bar?' Like that way none of you get in trouble, you could even ream me out after if you want"H2 "NO. NO DO NOT DO THAT, ABSOLUTELY NOT."H1 smiles apologetically and whispers to me, "Sorry...it's just that they're related to the owner."I'm not sure if you're as infuriated reading that as I was hearing it but, to recap, it's now an hour past our 7pm reservation and TWENTY HUNGRY PEOPLE have been waiting to be seated, while TWO PEOPLE who are related to the owner literally just sit at the table checking their phones, most likely because no one even told them they were the reason for holding us up. At 8:10 they finally get up to leave, and then it takes time to clean up their table and set up the long table for our party so we didn't sit down until like 8:20.As we are being led to our seats, one of the servers says "Sorry about that, I know it probably seemed straightforward to you but sometimes things are more complicated than they seem."Me: "You mean because they were relatives of the owner, so they deserve special treatment at the expense of twenty people?"Server: "Look honey, I'm the one that's going to have to deal with them the next time they come in."Me "Right, but the problem is that if you think that way, you won't have to deal with US the next time we come in, because we won't come back after getting such shitty service. And those people probably want the owner to be doing good business. Instead, you guys weren't able to seat people in that whole section of the restaurant because you were holding the tables for our group, and lost money on that too!"They were like "I know, yes, sorry" but whatever. I sincerely hope this was a one-time thing but I just can't grasp it at all. No one wins in that situation. Like, what if we had plans after? It's absurd.Perhaps the owner and his relatives are unaware the extent to which the staff were screwing everyone else over at their expense. At the very least if they read this maybe they can have a conversation about how to deal with the extent of preferential treatment to give to family.
2018-07-11,5,I went rogue and I liked it. How many people go to a great pizza place not for the pizza. Well this girl did and it turned out to be awesome. I went to Johnny Pepperoni's with friends on a blissfully cool summer night and sat outside with a few bottles of wine. As tempted as I was to order pizza or pasta I opted for their fish special...mahi mahi.I won't be able to do this dish justice except to say each bite was followed by my friend and I saying "oh my god" it was that good. Gorgeous fresh mahi perfectly cooked with the most fantastic combination of sautéed peppers, options, and perfectly briny olives. All this was layered atop and thinly cut and perfectly grilled cauliflower steak. It was magical. Johnny Pepperoni has had huge shoes to fill for me personally, as Ted and Joe's (it's former bar/restaurant) was my favorite forever.  They have managed, strollers and all, to fill them quite nicely. The staff is friendly and hard working. The food speaks for itself. It's good, very. And so I recommend you step outside the pizza box and order a special. I have a feeling you won't be disappointed!
2018-07-06,5,Square pie is consistently delicious. We love the broccoli rabe crostini, arugula/garlic square pie and spaghetti marinara. A favorite for any night for our whole family. Friendly staff.
2018-07-04,5,Here's some pics from dinner last night. Great service and meal! Pictured is Square Pie with pepperoni, Shrimp Scampi and side of asparagus with lemon and capers.
2018-06-12,4,Went there for dinner service was great thanks danny and good luck and food excellent we will definitely will be back see you soon danny!!!!!
2018-06-03,1,I think we are done with Johnny Pepperoni for now. I have ordered last weekend pizzas and a few pieces tiramisu. Pizza was good but tiramisu were all the dry corners and really not tasty at all. So I would never again order tiramisu there. Today I ordered square pizza from them and we waited for a bit over an hour for the delivery (few blocks away) and once pizza arrived it was cold, old, and burnt (I guess reheated to death). It smelled bad too. No apologies when I called to ask about the delayed delivery. I am a parent so I cannot give something like this to my kids and have clean conscience.
2018-05-25,5,Highly recommend  the square pie. It's deep dish but not doughy and the crust is well done but not burnt or hard. Very flavorful as is without overwhelming amount of cheese.  Also recommend the pasta pomodoro if looking for a vegetarian option. The service here is pretty consistent across servers and one of the best we have experienced in Hoboken. Very much a team effort, and they are an attentive staff. They are also kid friendly with a kids menu and kid cups. It is our preferred destination for family dinners out especially if we want to sit outdoors.
2018-05-13,5,We just had a private party for my son's first communion and I must say it was incredible! The staff was amazing and the food was delicious. The service was above and beyond. We loved everything about it! We have been in Hoboken for 14 years and this is by far the best place we have been for a private party.
2018-05-12,4,Best square pie in Hoboken. Their namesake does not disappoint - bug and flavorful pepperoni. In nice weather you can enjoy it on the lovely terrace.
2018-05-06,5,Great go-to pizza. We order regularly. Usually go with the plain pizza and radicchio salad which are both great. The chicken parm dinner is also very good. They are also good at hosting events, as we had my birthday here a couple years ago.
2018-05-03,3,I love pizza. My boyfriend loves pizza. So we decided to slowly hit up all the pizza spots in Hoboken (not all at once). Johnny Pepperoni had been on our list for a while because we always passed by it on the way to/from Trader Joe's. One snowstormy day, we found ourselves with no dinner, and had a small case of cabin fever. So we decided to place an order and trek on over to pick up some pizza.To start, we ordered a side of the arancini (Sicilian-style rice fritters, prosciutto, fontina and tomato sauce), which I didn't like. Somethaing didn't taste right with the cheese - like they might have mixed some cheddar cheese, or kraft singles in it.For the pizza, we had the Mushroom and Fontina pie (white pizza, roasted mushrooms, fontina, fresh mozzarella, pecorino, garlic and thyme). Now I don't know if maybe I just don't like white pizza, or if it was just too much going on, but I didn't like it as much as I was expecting it to. It was pretty heavy. On the plus side, there were a decent amount of mushrooms on the pie; I just wish they had spread it out more evenly.Perhaps their pies would taste better if you dine in, so I wouldn't mind going back to try a different pizza, preferably one with sauce. Plus, I believe it's BYOB!
2018-04-22,2,The food is good but the hostess at the entrance (black long hair with glasses) was extremely rude!. She called the kids cup some other name and I didn't understand, and she laughed at my face and showed me what she meant. I was so shocked by the way she laughed at me I couldn't react!. I also told her we were 3 people and she removed one plate. I said: "Excuse me, we're 3 people and she smacked the plate on the table". I've never been in situation like that in a restaurant so I didn't tell the owner. I hope he reads this!. I'm not from San Francisco, CA. I'm from Hoboken.
2018-04-22,5,This place is fantastic! It's seriously some of the best pizza I've ever had. The ingredients are super fresh, and the pie sizes are perfect. Dominic too is wonderful, comes out and asks you how it's going. Service was great.The ambience is really great too -- a bit of rustic NYC/Jersey but where you can also watch the Yankees game. I cannot recommend this place enough. It's the best!!!
2018-04-16,4,Live in Hoboken and enjoy takeout  and dine in from Johnny Pepperoni. Food always consistent and delicious. Great pasta dishes and  the thin sliced pizza is one of my favorites. Sometimes Sat night wait is longer then expected but that is what happens when it is a good restaurant. One of my favorite places to eat in Hoboken.
2018-04-08,4,Great BYOB spot. Polite service, loved the eggplant parmigiana. If there is a wait, you can leave your phone number and they will call when ready while you grab a drink at a nearby bar.
2018-03-31,5,JOHNNY PEPPERONI. I am absolutely obsessed. This restaurant is a wonderful dine in spot for pizza & Italian food. It's authentic & absolutely fantastic. I feel like I'm in Italy with every bite. The bruschetta is so good - the toast is crispy & soft (you'll understand what I'm talking about when you try it) and the ricotta and tomatoes are amazing and fresh. The square pizza pie is to die for - we always have so much to take home, and I am satisfied for days. The pricing is reasonable and the service is great. It's BYOB which is another huge plus in Hoboken. Highly recommend!
2018-03-25,5,Our favorite pizza place in the neighborhood! Have tried all the pizza places in the North End, Johnny Pepperoni's is by far the best.
2018-03-18,2,I really was not impressed with Johnny Pepperoni. I felt like I had to try it at least once because it seems to be a staple in Hoboken. The caesar salad was fresh, but the dressing had a fishy taste. I know it's obviously made with anchovies, but I've never tasted that in a caesar dressing before.We ordered a plain pie. Although it was not bad, it was certainly nothing to write home about, especially for the cost.The staff was friendly and the owner (or manager?) came to check in with us at one point during the meal to see how everything was.All in all, if Johnny Pepperoni was a bit cheaper I might return, but there are too many other Italian restaurants in Hoboken that I could go to with better quality food for the prices.
2018-03-07,3,Ordered during a snow storm so I understand it may have been an off night. Very expensive for the quality of the food. The chicken parm was a little chewy and the prosciutto arugula pizza was not the best... the meat was a little too thick
2018-02-28,5,It was my husband and I first time coming here tonight since living in Hoboken since last year. The food is amazing authentic. I felt like I was in Italy. The atmosphere is amazing. The people that work here are amazing I mean everyone. I would like to give a shoutout to Richie. Please if you come here ask for Richie because he is the best!!!!!!! Oh yeah and BYOB which is amazing. The entire staff is amazing. You will definitely see my husband and I here more than once. See you next time Richie!!!!!!!!Hospitality here was amazing and outstanding from when  we enter the restaurant and until we left!!!
2018-02-26,5,My husband and I go to Johnny Pepperoni's almost every weekend, we love it! We bring my parents too and they love it, and my parents bring their friends! When I decided to throw a surprise party for my husband completing the CPA, I knew I would go to Johnny Pepperoni's and they did not disappoint. I hosted about 30 people this past Sunday. The food was amazing, pizza, pasta, chicken parm, wings, YUM. Dominic and Richie were our servers and they were amazing. I wish I had more parties to throw! As always, Johnny Pepperoni's does not disappoint and we will continue to come back for years to come.
2018-02-16,1,Bummed - I ordered pizza at 7 pm - I repeated the order several times.  The pizza showed up at 8 and it was wrong. - I called to let them know and they asked me what I wanted them to do... I told them  I'd like what I ordered, so they said they would replace it.  Now it's 9 pm and still no pizza - I would have hoped since it was their mistake they would have tried to make it right but I guess they don't really care.  We used to go for dine in all the time so I'm upset to have to stop ordering from there but for $30 for a pizza and a salad it should be correct and more timely than 2 hrs.
2018-02-07,5,Square pie w/ sausage and pepperoni is the best.  Just make sure you get it while it's still hot.
2018-01-28,5,Very solid BYOB Italian joint. Service is consistently friendly and efficient. Menu includes classic Italian American staples plus daily specials. Something for everyone with a daily catch and salads, too.
2018-01-20,4,Has been a family staple ever since Baron was born.  Staff is always great.  Cozy friendly vibe.  We love to bring some beer and wine and nestle in for quality pizza.  Every once and awhile I diverge to a pasta dish and am never disappointed.
2018-01-20,2,People have been raving about this place to me for a couple of years. Mostly around the amazing square pie they serve. So, we decided to make a trip here last weekend for a homecoming party. They do not take reservations, but we were told that we would be seated pretty quickly. When we arrived, we immediately found ourselves having to wait out in the rain because there is a real lack of an area to wait inside, but that was not all that bad since we only had to wait about 10 minutes. We got seated around 8:50 PM and we were immediately surrounded by about 3 servers, who surrounded us to fill our water and open our bottles of wine (score BYOB). As a large group, we took about 5 minutes to figure out what we would start off with. After another 5 minutes our waiter came over, gave us some suggestions and took our first order of appetizers. The appetizers were pretty good, we started with; the Antipasti Platter, wings, rice balls and a square pizza. The Antipasti Platter was a huge let down for the price we paid, it kind of looked like they just threw some leftovers on a plate and served it. The rice balls were okay, not something I enjoy, but everybody else seemed to like them. The wings, nothing special, just wings, but the square pie was pretty great! It really had us looking forward to try out some of the other pies. The restaurant was pretty busy and we kept waiving over to our waiter, who seemed overwhelmed with other tables. We asked the bus-boy if we could place our dinner order when he came over to fill-up our water, but he said our waiter had to do that, but he would tell him to come over. Finally, after about 10 minutes he came over, apologized and took our order for 4 pizzas. Then tragedy...he came back about 3 minutes later and told us that the kitchen was closed. Apparently the kitchen has a hard close time of 10pm, which nobody thought to share with us when we sat down or ordered. I quickly looked at my watch which read 10:01. I told him that we actually ordered a couple of minutes ago, but he again apologized. When I asked why he did not share that the kitchen would not serve after 10:00, he just shrugged and said he was sorry. I know that places have to close, but this seemed a little excessive considering that we did order before the kitchen closed and nobody mentioned this closing time to us. So, we did not have a chance to try out all the other pizzas that were on the menu. So we left hungry and made a walk down to Mario's, which was still open and more then happy to take our money. I guess we will never know what their pizza taste like since we will not be heading back.
2018-01-01,1,I was very shocked and disappointed by my most recent experience here. We ordered takeout for our family of four and asked for a pint of gelato for dessert. When I picked up the order they had a childs cup in the bag. Thinking there might have been a miscommunication, I told the hostess that we asked for a pint and the serving in the bag wasn't the right amount, she was clearly annoyed. She came back with another child's cup and I again pointed out that we asked for a pint in order to accomodate four people and that we have ordered this in the past without issue. Her annoyance escalated to anger. She said she had to charge me extra, which I happily agreed to. She then went to the kitchen staff to ask for a larger container. One of the waiters (who I think was also manager) asked why and when she angrily told him he very loudly (and within six feet of me) exclaimed "who the f--k orders a pint of ice cream!" And "why don't they just go and buy it at the f--king store!". The hostess answered with "I have no idea". Needless to say, extremely embarrassing and rude. When she returned with a larger container I told her I would happily pay whatever I had to. She said it wasn't necessary. It was such a shocking way to be treated that sadly we will not be going back there, despite being loyal customers since it opened.
2017-12-18,4,Great BYOB Italian place in town. I have passed this place plenty of times and finally went in tonight for dinner and was very pleased!  Food was good, staff was friendly. I wish they had more variety in their menu. I had eggplant parm for dinner which was delicious. Would definitely return!
2017-12-16,5,Great food and service! And BYOB! Jeremy was a great waiter and we really had a great night out. Keep I.T in mind for a nice Friday evening evening :)
2017-12-13,4,great pizza place in Hoboken!its BYOB if you want to drink come prepared!i loved the mushroom pizza, so many options we have to come back for more!
2017-12-03,1,I don't really understand how this place was given 5, let alone, 4 stars. We ordered a Caesar salad, chicken parm and two cokes. Easy enough? Let's just start by saying the coca colas were the only thing this place has going for it.We sent the salad back. It tasted fishy. I know Caesar salad dressings include anchovies, but this tasted like the anchovies went bad - sour! Ick! We had the chicken parm and it was mediocre. Not terrible but also not good either. When the bill came, the waiter was nice enough to remove the horrible salad without us asking but the bill still came out to $26 bucks. Hoboken Italian/pizza places are a dime a dozen. They should know their level of food (this is low to medium end and charge accordingly.) We won't be back. Sorry Johnny Pepperoni, not worth the mONI.
2017-11-02,4,Pros : outdoor seating is ample and comfortable! The burrata  special was out of this word amazing. So much so, that I packed my entree to go, and ate the burrata as my meal.Cons: servers looked unkempt, arancini (rice balls) tasted like A mixture of cheddar cheese and plastic.Major pro: the owner, (John) was kind, generous and easy to work with during an event I hosted this weekend.
2017-10-18,5,Friends highly recommended the pizzas at Johnny pepperoni, but we are nonconformists... and tried their nana's chicken and eggplant parm! Wow, we were blown away! Especially with nana's chicken, didn't know what it was, the chicken was cooked perfectly and so flavorful (even the rice). Our serve was great,  the location is awesome, can't wait to come back and try what they are known for, PIZZA!
2017-10-07,5,The best pepperoni pizza in Hoboken! I just wish their blue cheese dressing was not so watery. Pizza is delicious every time. Hard to find such consistency at other pizza places in Hoboken. Highly recommend.
2017-09-30,4,The food was great, but more of a family restaurant than I was expecting- which is fine! BYOB which is always nice with pizza
2017-09-23,5,This is our favorite place in Hoboken. The decor is cheerful. The food is consistently good. One of us loves the chicken fra diavolo. I have gotten chicken piccata, salad specials, chicken marsala, and other entrees...all great. We have taken many out of towners here for a visit and it rates well among them. We love that it is a BYO. Also has a small kids' menu. Have seen many families dine here. We will keep coming back.
2017-09-09,1,It's a shame I have to write a review like this as their food is pretty decent.  I just called to try to make a reservation for 12 for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they don't take reservations even before I was able to finish my sentence.  I then told them that I had my daughter's birthday there last year and they were at least able to tell me that there would be a table ready...the manager then just repeated his sentence obnoxiously.  I moved on and was going to ask if I would be able to pick a selected menu and prepay to avoid the tackiness of paying for everyone at the table...but once again, he didn't even let me finish my sentence and just said "our menu is our menu" once he heard the word "menu".  Seriously?  Who does the manager think he is speaking so rudely to customers like that?  Last time I'm even considering them.
2017-08-19,3,Four adults and one baby sat outside of Johnny Pepperoni on a mild summer evening. I didn't see much of the inside, but the outdoor seating was really nice, especially since the pizzeria is located in a calmer residential part of Hoboken. We shared the burrata cheese appetizer ($18) off the specials menu. It was a heaping ball o' cheese accompanied by prosciutto and a little balsamic reduction and olive oil. The appetizer was quickly destroyed. For some greenery, we ordered two marinated mushroom salads ($9) to share. There was nothing negative to say about the salads, only positive things like "Yum." In addition to the mushrooms, there were artichokes, onions, and basil, topped off with a balsamic vinaigrette. Eventually we decided on the prosciutto and arugula ($20) and chicken parmigiana ($19) pizzas. I was willing to try the clam pie since it sounded like the most out there option, but no one else was game. Both pizzas were popular at our table. I thought the chicken parm one was a little heavy since there was fried chicken atop a pizza, but that was just me. I probably gravitated more towards the prosciutto pie but it was a slightly salty due to the prosciutto. Unfortunately we found a long blondish hair baked into one of the pizzas. We didn't say anything just to prevent a fuss, but it wasn't exactly the highlight of the meal.I think our server was named Danny, and he was ultra-polite, and he and some other staffers kept an eye on us.
2017-08-11,3,We arrived late Sunday evening.Restaurant was quiet.Sat outside.  Nice evening. Service just seemed a bit off.  He was nice. Checking on us and but forgetting to return.Our friends come often. They had a pasta dish and a lamb dish. My wife and I shared a pizza and a salad.  I would say they were both good.Probably enjoyed it because we were so hungry.  The bread served was also good.Paying the bill, we had to go find the waiter.
2017-07-25,5,I was always hesitant in trying them thinking they were a pizzeria with other food... far from the truth great Italian food with great great pizza! I love their staff (so friendly) and I love that on a nice day it can open up with their window
2017-07-23,4,Great atmosphere and friendly staff. The kids meals are a great value. My kids loved the spaghetti and meatballs. My husband and I shared a margarita pizza. Crust was perfect. My only complaint is they sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella. I hate Parmesan cheese on pizza. It makes it too salty. There is a bottle of it at each table so I wish they had left it up to the customer and not added it before serving. The sauce was good but wish there was more sauce and less cheese on the margarita.
2017-07-16,4,Delicious pizza!! We loved our custom square pie. Also one of the best caesar salads I've had! Just a good classic caesar. Only complaint is how the noise echoes throughout the place. But will as be back and can't wait to try more pizza!
2017-07-08,1,Note to staff: don't  post you are open until 10pm and then tell a line of customers you aren't serving anymore Bc there are no tables at 9:20 when there are clearly available tables. First rule of service: the customer is always right and lying directly to their faces only makes you look incompetent.Another helpful hint- don't stalk and rush seated customers in an effort to end the meal. It is obnoxious, extremely obvious and results in loss of future business. If you want to close the restaurant early- change your hours and make it known before people come into the restaurant. A simple sign would suffice.
2017-06-22,3,It's average. It's not good, it's not bad - think average.It's priced for more than you'll get.If you set your expectations to average food - you won't be disappointed.If you want to get better food for the same amount of money in Hoboken - plenty of better options close by.
2017-06-14,2,The pizza is delicious and my 2 year old enjoys the pies.  If i rated this place solely on the pizza, it would be a 4.  I am highly disappointed however in the clams oreganata from the perspective of price, taste, and execution.First- The clams are tiny; I took a picture next to a quarter to give you an idea. Sadness!Second- An order costs you $14 for six of these sorry little molluscs. Third- The bread crumbs were bland. The lemon helps give them some flavor other than cardboard.Fourth - The clam itself is non-existent buried within all the breadcrumbs.Do yourself a favor and stick to the pizza. Don't order the clams oreganata.
2017-06-11,4,The pizza here is some of the best I've had.  Really good, crispy and thin with solid flavor. They do "specials" but they never really change. The burrata is really good.  The wings are huge - just make sure you ask for it well done because they're so big sometimes they don't get cooked all the way through.  We have ventured to non pizza items and some are good, some are so-so. This is a pizzeria - get the pizza, any one, you won't be disappointed. The clam pizza is very rich but one of the best I've had and I am not a big clam person.  The eggplant and caper pizza is my go-to.He graham cracker ice cream they have for dessert is also to die for so save room.
2017-06-07,1,Where do I start? Pizza took over an hour. Shows up ice cold. Ordered sausage, peppers and onion pizza, came with two little crumbs of sausage. Ordered the pie well done, came doughy. Blue cheese on the side? Nope ranch. Pie was 14" and $25... would have rather ate Taco Bell. Let's say this place was more than a disappointment.
2017-06-05,5,This is a great place to go with a family or with friends! The asparagus pizza is fantastic as is the Caprese salad. It's a group favorite, inexpensive and BYOB.
2017-05-23,5,Hosted my son's 1st Birthday at Johnny Pepperoni a few weeks ago. It was absolutely terrific. We had about 40-50 ppl. The staff is extremely friendly and easy to work with. The food was delicious and plentiful. We got a ton of compliments on the food and the laid back atmosphere. Everything went so well and it was reasonable given the amount of food and the quality. We loved it and will continue to be huge fans of such a great place!
2017-04-06,2,Let me start off by saying Johnny's has been one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken.  I live around the corner and have recommended it to many.  However I was very disappointed with my recent situation with them.  I called a month ago asking if they would take a reservation for my 30th bday for 14 people (I'm a local and eat here often).  The man I spoke to said they usually don't but if I called the Wednesday before my birthday with the exact amount, he would do it and section off part of the restaurant.  This sounded great and I had planned to go there until I called the Wednesday before and found out they no longer will do that.  I was annoyed because I didn't make reservations anywhere else and if they weren't going to do it they should have said that from the beginning ! I had to speak to two different people before someone called the manager.  I will be going somewhere else for my birthday now (luckily another hoboken pizza place was able to accommodate me) and I'll be choosing other places to take my friends in the future after this experience.  Not a good idea to mislead a local on her 30th!
2017-03-26,5,Love their white mushroom pie.  Pizza always arrives hot and never too long of a wait.  Definitely one of the better pizzas and delivery services in Hoboken.
2017-03-10,5,Definitely the best pizza in town! There are tons of Italian/pizza places in Hoboken but this one is definitely my favorite. The food is amazing, it's BYOB, the staff is always friendly & it's on the cheaper side. Overall great place to come hang out for just a dinner date or with a group of friends. Highly recommend!
2017-02-26,5,Came in on a rainy Saturday and got our wet butts seated immediately. 2 bottles and wine and two hungry bellys, we were ready to plow! The server told us about the specials and we were quite impressed by his theatrics as he recited them. We ended up going with the antipasti  or "antipast" is how you're supposed to say it for a starter. It kicked ass! Careful with the pepper though, it'll sneak up ya. Then we did the mushroom fontina pizza with black olives. Now Hoboken has tons of pizza joints and they all claim to be the best. This is one of the best ive gotta say. To polish it off and soak up all the wine, we did the tiramisu. Also kicked ass! Only regret we had was not trying the chicken wings. The folks next to us had them and I almost took one when they weren't looking. Overall laid back atmosphere and a great cheap meal out!
2017-02-06,4,Cute pizza joint, with fresh ingredients, great pepperoni indeed! :) Yum!
2017-01-31,5,Love this place! Great food. Fantastic meatballs. Laid back and unpretentious atmosphere. Overall a very solid place to go.They don't serve alcohol so you should plan ahead and bring your own vino or other adult beverage of choice. But you can always just swing by Sasso's just around the corner to pick something up on your way. So it's a non-issue.
2017-01-15,5,This is the best pizza in Hoboken.. although the pies are small it's well worth it ..
2017-01-13,4,Love the square prosciutto and arugula pie!! We often order a square pie to go and eat it for a few days. I have dined in the restaurant a few times and it was good service, but a bit noisy. I enjoy the nice walk uptown and back to pick up the pizza.  The square pies are delicious and quite large.
2017-01-13,1,Very disappointed. 40 bucks for pizza and spaghetti with clams. Over priced mediocre food. Pasta is al dente but too much pepper flakes and very few clams. Pizza was ok. Next morning --Morning after pizza was horrible. Love left over pizza for breakfast but this thin crust pizza was saggy to start and still saggy in the morning. Seems like Hoboken restaurants are disappointing but will keep trying until I find a good one.
2017-01-01,5,From Dominic the waiter, to the pizza and the entire service, 5 stars throughout. Plus it's BYOB with no corkage fee. Thanks for being homey and unpretentious.
2017-01-01,3,Great vibe inside and a friendly staff.  With the many pizza options in Hoboken you can do a lot worse!The salads are all incredible, some of the best I've had.  The pizza options are creative and delicious.  The one time I had the pasta it was a little too rich and greasy but I'd be willing to give it another chance.  The BYOB is a bit of a hassle but there are liquor stores close enough.Overall a reliable neighborhood spot I plan to frequent!DAN APPROVED!
2016-11-15,5,Loved this place. Went there during the summer and was able to get a little table outside. Sausage pizza was amazing (ordered garlic slices on it as well) wings were too! They also have a very good menu for actual entrees. They don't have a big selection on drinks (nonalcoholic) but the BYOB makes up for it. Service was great as well
2016-11-13,5,Really nice family friendly Italian restaurant. There food tastes great and is good value. You can sit outside in the summer and it is being your own wine and beer. Reason I gave 5 stars was for the service, the waiters are very nice and very helpful to families of young children. Overall a great Hoboken spot!
2016-11-05,5,Best pizza possible. The succulent pepperoni is outmatched only by the creamy mozzy cheese and freshly cut tomatoes
2016-11-02,5,Johnny Pepperoni is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken!  I've been over 10 times and it never disappoints.  There are plenty of pizzerias in Hoboken but they have hands down the best - cannot get enough of the square pie with pepperoni!  The sauce.  The dough.  The fresh mozz. YUM!  Another go-to dish is the fritto misto, which is a huge platter of crispy goodness.  Also, their service is always pleasant and on point.  Don't forget they are BYOB!
2016-10-18,5,This restaurant is top notch for a laid back dinner, casual date and delivery was good also. BYOB and pizza is great.I had dinner here alone at a corner table and had a nice Malbec. I had chicken parm and the wings that were on special. Yo. The wings were amazing. I was playing Luciano Pavarotti on my iPhone 7 the entire time at a very moderate volume. I enjoyed myself very much.
2016-10-18,4,This is a great causal dinner spot. BYOB. The salads and pizza are very delicious. I would suggest not ordering the calamari, barely no fish and a little overpriced. Great accommodations for large parties!!
2016-10-15,3,This place is pretty good.   They need real wine glasses though. My husband ordered the chicken parm pizza and I ordered the linguini with clams.   The chicken parm pizza was amazing however the linguine was so hot with red pepper flakes it was almost inedible! Who puts all that on a perfect dish?!?   It was a shame :/
2016-10-11,4,Ate here a couple days ago with a large group. This place knocks it out if the park with a quality Italian neighborhood feel. Great service too. I had the blackened salmon salad. Fish was cooked ON POINT. Have had their burrata too which I recommend!
2016-10-06,3,I came to Johnny Pepperoni after having a wine tasting class in Hoboken.  I was in the company of six girls.  That alone is already exciting.  But alas the universe was even kinder.  Because we needed some serious sobering up, it was time to find some good ol' pizza to fill our stomach and fix our inebriated selves.  One of the girls suggested we should check out Johnny Pepperoni and so we did.  I am glad that we listened to her suggestion because we were treated to some delicious pizza here.  I don't ever judge a book by its cover and no statement is truer than in this case.  Between the seven of us (mind you six were girls) we downed three whole pizzas.  Yes, you read that right, seven people were able to consume three large pizzas!  Needless to say I was in paradise!  Women that are beautiful, smart, and can eat steals my heart any day.  But something else stole my heart that night.  It was of course the pizza.  We had decided to order a prosciutto and arugula pizza, mushroom and fontina pizza, and chicken parm pizza.  All three came out piping hot from the oven and served right in the middle of the table for all of us to devour.  The prosciutto and arugula pizza was slightly salty from the prosciutto but the slight bitterness of the arugula cut into it well.  The mushroom and fontina was a combination of an earthy and milky flavor that just nourished the stomach and soul.  Lastly the chicken parmesan was worth every calorie and fat coming from such delicious concoction.  There was no hesitation on any of our part to dig in and after it all, my party and I felt like we needed to be wheeled out because of the amount of food that we had consumed.  Thankfully the finite amount of food the stomach can take is actually pliable enough that it allows for some stretching.  Without that ability the girls and I would have died halfway through our feast.  One thing is certain though, Johnny Pepperoni is one place that I know I can visit to have a great slice of pie if I'm in Hoboken and that should not be taken lightly.
2016-09-28,4,I am definitely a fan of this pizza shop.  It is one of the better Italian places in Hoboken.  There are A LOT of Italian places.  I had the chicken Parmesan pizza and it was really good.  The sauce was great and it had a lot of meat.  My wife had the ravioli special.  She really enjoyed our meal.  We also shares a kids meal meatball, because we want to try it out.  All the food was great and cooked well.The place itself is really nice.  It looks like an old school pizza place, but the quality of food is much better.  The service was awesome.  The waiter always checked on us and would fill up waters and give us napkins.  The service was really good.  It is also BYOB.This was, overall, a really solid place to get a pizza and pasta.  It is definitely one of the best Italian places in Hoboken.  I really enjoyed myself.
2016-09-10,3,Saturday early evening.  Plenty of seating available (we chose to sit outside).  The staff and server we had were very, so very, kind.  Ordered a coke and square pie, that is pan fried in olive oil.  The Coke is a $3 8 oz. glass bottle that got warm within minutes.   Would have been nice if they were served in the large Pizza Hut red tinted cups they serve ice water in.Pizza here - big mistake - I admit I'm critical of pizza, since I was born and raised in North Jersey.  But the crust was so tough, I felt the cheese and red sauce were served on three plates - the table, the plate and the concrete crust.  My wife opted to just eat everything on top of the crust.  Crust was black but primarily because of the cheese burning (not considered unusual), but definitely overcooked and ruined all of the flavor.  Should have went with the original thin crust pie.  My mistake... or theirs?
2016-08-28,5,Me and my Honey went to Johnny Pepperoni's this week and of course we had to have a pepperoni pizza. Well done! While we waited the gentleman offered us a glass of wine (they don't serve liqueur) on the house that was so nice. As we were relaxing in the very warm setting I was saying that I hope the pepperonis came out well done and curl up. Well they did exactly that and they  came out perfect the pizza was outstanding, we loved it.
2016-08-21,4,The food at Johnny Pepperoni is consistently excellent. My family and friends regularly get together at this restaurant and we are always pleased. The servers are uniformly friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong with Johnny Peps!
2016-08-21,1,I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled after ordering here last night. I got a square pie with sausage and an order of rice balls. TERRIBLE , it was $35 and the biggest waste. Pizza tastes so weird and was so hard. There was way too much marinara sauce on it. The rice balls also had a really weird taste to them almost fishy like in the center. I had a piece threw the whole thing away and just ate cereal. I don't think I've ever had pizza I didn't like even frozen kind I'm usually not picky but this sucked.
2016-08-21,5,Love Johnny Pepperonis!! I came here with my sister, her husband, my niece and nephew when they visited Hoboken. Excellent place for kids! We split the Caesar salad, Sicilian pasta, and a mushroom and pepperoni pizza. The Caesar was a bit too lemony for my taste but it was fresh and a good size. The pasta and pizza were great! Fresh mushrooms and the smaller pepperonis are my favorite toppings! BYOB is always a huge plus as well! A great place that I will definitely be returning to!
2016-08-14,1,Ordered a pizza tonight, after waiting for over an hour, they called me back saying they're going to cancel the order because the driver didn't want to deliver it.  Wtf?  Not to mention we've had pizza delivered to our address before.  Ridiculous
2016-08-03,5,Sorry but Johnny Pepperoni's beats out all the other pizza places in Hoboken. It has a beautiful location & wonderful atmosphere. Get away from those tourist traps and make your way to 11th st. The pizza is top notch, one of the best! Please take my word, you wont be disappointed. Now that I've moved out of NJ, every time I eat a slice of pizza: "Not better than Johnny Pepperoni's"
2016-07-22,5,The best food in Hoboken!  Fantastic service and great atmosphere.  Great option for take out or dining in.   A once a week option, at least!!
2016-07-15,5,Update: this has since become my favorite restaurant in Hoboken and possibly the entire world. Every single dish I've ever ordered has been great, staff is friendly, specials are always new and exciting, and it's just a great place to bring a bottle of wine and hang out. My boyfriend and I come here for casual weeknight dinners, family outings, birthdays, anniversaries, you name it. Pretty much every milestone of our lives is celebrated at Johnny Peps. No shame. I love this place!
2016-07-09,4,My family loves to enjoy birthday dinners in Hoboken. They have a lot of variety in their restaurants and also a big similarity that everyone loves. BYOB. Came here on a Saturday night to celebrate a couple of birthdays. We ordered a few appetizers for the table but one of my favorites was the arancini balls. The breading wasn't too much and the filling was filled with rice, cheese, and prosciutto. A great way to start. Most people I think go with the pizza at JP's. A few people at the table got pastas and chicken dishes but I stuck with the pizza. For the table, we got the pepperoni pie, chicken parm pie, and the clam pie. All three were honestly great in their own way. I would favor the clam pie though. It is pretty spicy with red peppers, but the flavors were all there. What makes this place great was the service. Not sure what her name was, but she was excellent. She made the dinner that much better with her attentiveness and put up with a big group of ten people who make up my family. Always fun to visit Hoboken for dinner, and this place never lets us down.
2016-07-07,5,We got the clam pizza and sausage pizza.  Both pizzas were great.  My only complaint was the large amount of onions on the sausage pizza. Second time ordering from here I got a pepperoni pizza.  Very good.  They don't skip on pepperoni.  This is definitely my go to pizza spot in Hoboken.
2016-07-05,4,A cool atmosphere that has some high quality pizza. This could stand up to any of the brick over places in hoboken except for maybe napolis. Service is always good and if you can grab a table outside do it.
2016-06-26,3,The pizza is good. I liked the sausage and broccoli rabe. Only drawback was a delivery driver that was beyond rude who didn't carry change and wanted a $11 tip because of not having change.
2016-06-26,4,We ordered takeout over the phone from our hotel. Firstly, the order taker was very polite. Even when she informed me I was too far for a delivery, I thought it was handled well. And it was ready even before promised (20 mins)The pizza itself was delicious. It was still hot when we got back. In fact, it was too hot to hold when I first got it so placed it on the seat. Big mistake! They tipped over when I broke hard in the car. The mushroom pizza was fine but the pepperoni was a mess!So overall a good experience and would consider eating here if we are close by again.
2016-06-24,3,Pizza was really good (took forever to get and was not busy) but the baked clams should be taken completely off the menu. The waiter did refund us for the baked clams as usually I just roll with it but he asked how the food was so I told him. Really respected the fact they gave us 100% refund on them. Oh well, no reason to be ordering baked clams at a pizza place. Love the fact they load up the pepperoni pizza with plenty of peps. Not sure how there dishes are but always see a good crowd.
2016-06-21,5,This place is the bee's knees. This aptly named has one of the best pepperoni pizzas out there. The pies are slightly thicker than your typical NY slice, but not so thick that they get soggy. But of course, the pepperoni is the bell of the ball. These little slices get crispy edges that turn up and create tiny little pools of pepperoni oil that make this pizza so goddamn rich and delectable. The pro-tip move at this joint though, is to get the chicken parm pizza and add pepperoni to it. You'll forget about any other pizza you've ever eaten, if only for that moment.Other than the food though, this is a great BYOB joint to bring friends and family. Very friendly wait staff, and good outdoor seating during the summer.
2016-06-20,5,The worked here are so nice and I love love love the buffalo chicken wings! Pizza here is also great.
2016-06-07,4,What a treat!  Great location, great food and great time dining.  BYOB!  The chairs are uncomfortable low cut and are not pleasing to sit in for an extended meal.  I really love how quickly the food arrived after ordering.  The server was very well prepared with the specials of the night having memorized them.  I was impressed because at first I got the impression this place was a Pizza Hut with a suit on.  I'm glad I was wrong.  They allowed us to dine with a large group without hesitation.  It is hard to find a place to dine where large groups are welcomed and not simply tucked away in a remote corner that has no view or service.   You guys did an awesome job!!  One small piece of feedback, I would probably do something different with those hideously cheap table coverings.  There are many more options that wouldn't give the impression that it is some cheap diner at a trucks top on a highway in the middle of no where.  Haha. Personal taste, I believe the look could be refreshed.  I don't have one single negative thing to say about the food.  Awesome awesome awesome.  Best pasta I've eaten in Jersey!!
2016-06-04,5,AMAZING food and friendly staff. We ordered the chicken parm pizza which was to die for. We brought our own wine and enjoyed the night sitting outside. Our waitress was extremely friendly and personable. The restaurant sits on a quiet corner of Hoboken. Highly recommend. We will be back.
2016-06-02,5,Food is always amazing, they have great specials. I love their prosciutto pizza it's really different and tastes amazing. I find it a little overpriced, but for the quality of food it's worth it.
2016-05-12,4,This is my favorite BYOB spot in Hoboken.  I live close by so frequently dine in and order take out.  They have 3 or 4 different Bruscetta choices.  Love the Broccoli Rabe and the Tomato Ricotta selections.  Their pastas are good and a nice portion.  If they have the Burrata special as an appetizer do yourself a favor and get it!  AMAZING!  They always accommodate changing things up.  I frequently get the Radicchio Salad and add grilled chicken.  If you dine in prepare to wait for a table at prime time and the place gets very loud inside.  Definitely not the place for a quiet dinner.
2016-04-27,4,This place is set back in the Hackensack NJ neighborhood. The atmosphere is nice and laid back. There's plenty of outside seating. The staff is very friendly. The Big Square pizza was awesome!
2016-04-26,4,Great food (both the pastas and pizzas). Friendly service. BYOB and kid friendly all at the same time.
2016-04-16,5,Our favorite place in Hoboken! We usually do the pizza when we are here but this time we tried the pasta and loved it! What makes this place even better is the service. Our waiter, Richie, was the best! Despite his busy evening, he was attentive and wonderful. When we come back, we will definitely ask for Richie! Enjoy! You won't be disappointed!
2016-04-13,3,The pizza is really good I've ordered delivery from here like four times it's delicious. Only thing that's a shame is the attitude of the delivery guy. So nasty to the point that I stopped ordering delivery. Customer service plays a role in a business- the pizza is absolutely delicious but the customer service deters me away which is a shame. If I'm paying for food I shouldn't feel an ounce of an attitude or anything of that nature. My roommate and I will have to go into the restaurant to eat there. The pizza gets 5 stars, delivery boy gets 0 which brings this review to 3 stars.
2016-03-27,4,After getting so tipsy after the WineO 101 class at Park+Garden, half of the Yelpers in that class decided that we were in desperate need of food. And don't ask me why, but pizza sounded so delicious to us after gulping so much wine in so little time. So I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and find the closest, walking distance pizza joint that is 3-star or above. Lo and behold, Johnny Pepperoni was on the top of the list and off we walked for 3 Hoboken-blocks away.We came as a group of 7 and were seated right away at a round table in the corner. Dom "Cent'Anni" was our server and he took a really good care of us. We ordered chicken wings as well as mushroom & fontina, prosciutto& arugula, and eggplant pies. All the pies were cut into 6. I have to say this was one of the better pizzas I have had in Jersey. And I'm pretty sure it's BYOB since I saw people bringing in their own bottles.
2016-03-24,5,So i cant have gluten womp for me but my friends could not stop raving about the delicious pizza i jealously saw them eating, they all really enjoyed it and it looked delicious. As for me, I tried their wing special and despite my mouth being on fire most of the night they were worth it! Juicy, crunchy cooked to perfection and not soggy which usually happens with buffalo or saucy wings. Considering making occasional trips from NYC when I want a chill spot in a lovely neighborhood away from the city jungle.
2016-03-18,1,Very confused why are the worst restaurant in Hoboken?* 3x occasions you took the order wrong!* You contact me to apologize and offer to correct the situation.* You asked for my contact info.* You said John the owner will make it right.* After no word, I follow up twice without an answer.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * REALLY?!?! You decided to take 3x bad situations and made it worse.FOR SHAME
2016-03-11,5,There is a lot of great pizza to be had in Hoboken, but there is something about the delicious slightly salty crust at Johnny Pepperoni's that keeps me coming back for more! I have had pretty much every pizza on the menu, and my favorite is the Mushroom & Fontina. So. Good. But again, they are all good so go with a group and order a bunch of different ones so you can try for yourself. Also, added bonus that it's BYO.
2016-02-22,5,We go to Johnny Pepperoni either for a date night or with a group of friends.... never disappoints. The wait staff is amazing (we love Jay) and the food is just as good :)
2016-02-06,4,Excellent red sauce joint. 4.5 stars. The chicken parm plate I got was delicious, the girl got a chicken piccata plate and it was just as good. A level up from your average pizza joint fare, even reminded me of my family's home cooked style, and can you really get any higher praise than that? A bit busy and hectic on a Friday night, but that's what happens when you serve good food at good prices. Everything came out fast, and we even split some desserts. The graham cracker gelato was out of this world, and the zeppoli were tasty too, although a little underdone in the middle. I dig the classic red checkered tablecloths and you gotta love any place that's BYOB. Definitely on the short list for a return visit sooner than later, gotta try the pizza next!
2016-02-06,5,Get the deep dish pepperoni pizza--you will not be disappointed. I've never had a better pizza in my life. Better yet, it's BYOB! Perfect place for a group of friends!
2016-02-04,4,Pizza is very good. Good crust. Good sauce and cheese ratio and the pepperoni and sausage toppings at first rate! Unfortunately they don't deliver to our town. But we always pick up. Definitely recommend. One of the best in Hoboken.
2016-02-01,3,Everybody loves this place and I can't  figure out why. It's just ok thus my choice of 3 stars.. Pizza was ok. Calamari wasn't bad. Only saving grace was that it's a BYOB
2016-01-31,5,Totally fantastic food and warm, friendly authentic Italian atmosphere. We walked in and the place was super full, but they kindly offered to let us sit at the bar and have a glass of the wine we had brought (it's BYOB). The table was ready quickly and the food was absolutely delicious. I had the pesto with nuts and the spaghetti was cooked to al-dente perfection. The sauce was simply spectacular! The portions are huge soI was able to take home half for the next day's lunch too. Such a great place, highly recommend!!
2016-01-28,5,This awesome family style italian spot has become our neighborhood favorite. Staff is excellent - primarily the two mainstay waiters - and the food is consistently great. The pizza, veal marsala, meatballs, mushroom salad, arugula salad, fried calamari - all terrific. The atmosphere is really laid back and its byob. We eat here at least once a week, bring a bottle of red and sample the menu, everything is great, and the specials usually rock.
2016-01-03,5,Excellent pizza and the staff is always attentive and friendly. Best pizza in Hoboken.
2016-01-01,4,As a chicken parm snob it's hard to impress me.  But this is by far top 5 I've ever had.   Amazing pizzas very creative also Prob the best is hoboken.  It Can take a little long sometimes but that's the only flaw.
2015-12-30,5,The BEST pizza in Hoboken hands down. We always go for the Square pie with Pepperoni, the crust is crispy and delicious as it is basically fried in olive oil. Their sauce is also better than most in Hoboken. Comes fast, usually 20 minutes. Can't go wrong with Johnny Pepperonis!
2015-12-30,5,Have been here multiple times, with just my boyfriend and with large parties of 8-10, and have loved each visit!BYOB is always fun with a group, especially with no corking fee. Their pizza is also AMAZING and reasonably priced. We love both the regular and square pies, and always make sure to get a chicken parm or pepperoni pie!Their wait staff is very friendly and attentive. They do get busy by 6, and do not take reservations, but will accept call-aheads. Once we were waiting for 30-40 minutes, and they brought us bread and opened our wine bottles while we were waiting outside. This is one of our "go-to" restaurants in Hoboken, whether with our families (with young kids) or our 25 year old friends.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an authentic family pizzeria!
2015-12-22,5,The large pizza with spinach and garlic was absolutely decadent! It arrived at the door, hot and delicious, in just 20 minutes. My mom and I devoured the whole pizza and loved how generous they were with the whole cloves of garlic and fresh spinach. We are harsh critics of thin crust pizza, but this crust was simply perfect. We were left wanting another slice and we eagerly await our next pizza!!
2015-12-18,3,First off, let me say that we love Johnny Pep's. When you eat there, it's an awesome BYOB & get great service. We recently moved right outside of Hoboken where they don't deliver anymore.. not a problem, we pick it up now. Take out is completely opposite of dining there. The first time, fine, no big deal. The second time, this is annoying. Third time, we called. Tonight.. we made sure to check the salads before we left, (& got them fixed) but I forgot to check the pizza.. But should I really have to? Not only do you get hung up on mid-order, but the simple order process is terrible. Why are you asking me if I need chicken on a chicken Cesar salad? And yet, they forgot to put it on the salad anyway! I checked that there so they added it. But the dressing wasn't Cesar! The pizza, half chicken parm and half sausage.. well they put them together on the whole pie.. yes chicken parm/sausage on the pizza. We gave it a try, it's not a good combo. We called and spoke to the manager RICH, stated first off we love the place and the food, but EVERY time we order there's some issue with our food never being correct. No matter how many times we tried to diffuse this guy, he kept arguing with us, so we wished him a good night and hung up. The manager and take out staff definitely needs to wake up and start paying attention because there is nothing wrong with the food. We love the place, but we might have to start finding a new pizza place because we couldn't eat anything of the $47 order (two salads and a pizza).Posting these pics because apparently we're wrong (said the manager). Do yourself a favor, either go there or double check your ENTIRE order. Good luck Johnny Pep's, you lost a frequent customer.
2015-12-12,3,A neighborhood Italian restaurant gem.  BYOB casual attire place, but there are two wine stores within a few blocks.  Perfect place for a laid back date, couples and families.  Nicer place then a typical pizzeria and this place does not try to hold itself out as a pizzeria.  More of a casual Italian restaurant.  For the guys there are a few tvs inside where you can eyeball games occasionally.  The pasta, eggplant parm and meatballs are very good!  Recommend ordering a side of meatballs as an appetizer!  The pizza is ok but if you want to order out there are other options in town and thus the 3 star ranking otherwise I would rank it higher.    The pasta, eggplant parm and meatballs are far better then most places in Hoboken.  Enjoy!
2015-12-08,1,Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. For some dumb reason I went back to this well and got even worse results. I decided to cater my office lunch and learn from this joint.  Now my keys to a good catering job is punctuality, communication and good food. While JP has great pizza they are terribly managed. The food was over 45 min late and what's worst is I kept being told that it was 5 min away. I'll never ever cater or eat here again.
2015-12-02,1,It was late one night and me and my boyfriend just wanted to get a pizza for take out since we didn't want to cook anything, we got home opened the box and the whole pizza was turned upside down with the cheese and pepperonis tossed everywhere, like they dropped it and thought no one would notice and sent it back out anyways. thankfully I live close by and was able to go back in there to tell them, no manager came over to apologize or anything. Got another pizza and it was half grease and majorly salty. I've had past good experiences but I'll take my buisness elsewhere after that experience. Go to grimaldis instead.
2015-11-14,4,Chicken Fra Diavlo is amazing! Still attached to the bone, crispy outside and moist tender inside. Plenty of peppers and onions. The service here is always great too. Want to try the pizza next time
2015-11-04,4,Spacious outdoor seating, solid pizza. The square pie is my favorite: mozzarella, tomato sauce, fresh basil, garlic, olive oil. Our server asked me if I wanted extra garlic and as a garlic lover I obviously said yes. Server was friendly and attentive.
2015-10-27,5,I DREAM OF THEIR PEPPERONI PIZZA. My favorite pizza is from Harry's Italian in the city, and I recently moved to Hoboken and was afraid life would never be the same without Harry's nearby.  Fear not! Johnny Pepperoni's is equally as good as Harry's, with crisp, crunchy pepperoni and incredible sauce and crust. I could eat you everyday, Johnny Pepperoni.
2015-10-22,4,Place was super yummy!Great and friendly staffOriginally called for takeout which was a 45 minute wait. Ended up walking over with wine and asking to eat it in restaurant, very accommodating.Pizza was a good size for two, great sauce, amazing crust and BYOB is always a plus!Got spinach, sausage, onion thin crust pizza.Would definitely come back!!
2015-10-12,2,Pizza was decent, we shared a sausage and broccoli rabe pie. But nothing out of the ordinary frankly.But now comes the interesting part. We stepped in the restaurant at around 6. The place was quiet at the time, good weather caused couple of tables outside to be full. Same with inside, only two tables occupied. We were taken by the host to a table for two, that was perhaps slightly bigger than our 14" pizza pie. I knew that it was a small table, plus it was shaky, plus the big family who took the table next to ours had loud kids. Just fine. So, after we placed our order we asked our server if we could take the other table. Ha! The answer came right on- NO! He didn't care why we wanted to move, he said we expect it to be a busy night, so sorry you can't take table for 4. Fair enough, but dude, there were empty tables for two as well. We left at 7, still only 2 more tables occupied. The guy just didn't care. Poor service, in short. I would take out not dine in here, if I was you. I am not going again anyways, plenty of other pizza places to try.
2015-10-07,3,"Artisanal" pies in a super casual setting. Hard to get a seat at prime time though. BYO! So that's a plus, but considering the amount of Italian food options in Hoboken and the general area, don't wait an hour to eat here.
2015-09-27,5,Great pizza, delicious fish specials, and BYOB make Johnny Pepperoni my favorite restaurant in Hoboken! There is outdoor seating when the weather permits. Most importantly, the food and service is consistently great.
2015-09-20,1,I was walking around the area and saw Johnny Pepperoni. It looked like a good restaurant; there were families outside eating pizza, and I wanted to experience that. I walk in and ask for a menu, then I find what I want and ask to be seated. Instead, the hostess refused to seat me and took my order. I thought maybe after I gave her my order she'd sit me down, but when I asked where I can be seated she told me the bar. I told the hostess that I wanted to dine in and be seated, and she looked at me and said "Oh, I thought it was a to-go order" and STILL didn't seat me, even though the restaurant was full of empty seats. I just stood there waiting and the girl just looked at me. How else can I word "I want to dine in"?I'm appalled I was refused service, offended on how the hostess treated me, and confused because I would have given Johnny Pepperoni more money. I don't even know why I paid for my pizza. Like hell I'd stay there and eat at the bar with my pizza in a box. Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else.
2015-09-13,5,The pizza is awesome.  The pasta is great.  The mushroom salad is one of the best salads I have ever tasted.  Highly recommend the tiramisu as a shared dessert as it is addictive!
2015-08-21,5,I can't say enough good things about this place.  The service is great- very attentive and professional.  People think of this as "just a pizza place", but it's not.  The entrees are authentic Italian and always great.  The one bonus is that it's BYOB, which is huge.Highly recommend JP to everyone- John and has staff do an incredible job.
2015-08-16,5,OMG!  I'm sitting here with a full belly and a huge smile on my face!  I have lots of food allergies, so I'm skeptical about trying new places.  My allergies and dietary restrictions also make it difficult for my husband to take me on a surprise dinner date.  Well, tonight he surprised me with Johnny Pepperoni, (after much research), and he, (nor Johnny P.), disappointed.  The service, atmosphere, and food were amazing!  I had the chicken piccata, which is my favorite, and it was so good!  I wanted to eat it all and lick the plate!  My husband had the shrimp and tortellini special, and he was chewing so loudly that I couldn't hear the music.  The portions are big, and the complimentary bread is very yummy. In the south, the mark of a good meal is how sleepy everyone is after.  Well, it feels like it should be lights out for the both of us!  This place is great!  I recommend it to anyone that wants great food and great service.  You will not be disappointed! They have indoor and outdoor seating.  On-street parking.  They also make delicious looking pizzas!
2015-08-11,5,The classic Margherita pie is to die for! I stumbled upon this place walking around my new neighborhood. Love the outside sitting area and the staff was very nice and accommodating. Will definitely be coming back!
2015-08-11,5,There aren't enough stars above for me to give this place. My girlfriend and I went here last night and loved it. I don't usually write reviews, but It would be a disservice to JP for me not to. We were greeted by a gracious host, who showed us to our table outside. The waiters were exemplary - prompt with drink orders, attentive to our requests, intermittently checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying our dinner - all the time not intrusive at all. I had the sausage and broccoli rabe pizza, she had the chicken parm. Our conversation was muted by the delicious food in front of us. It was a wonderful experience, and definitely one for the list of Hoboken to-do's if you haven't already.
2015-08-10,4,Went to lunch with my father on Saturday.The restaurant itself is on a beautiful street in Hoboken,and the interior has an old school charm to it.My father had eggplant parm which was a very large portion.I had rigatoni with broccoli rabe and fennel sausage in a wine sauce.My only problem is that most Italians eat this dish with garlic and olive oil not wine.But it was still pretty good.Waitstaff was very professional.
2015-07-26,5,I've only had takeout at Johnny Pepperoni's, and the exact same thing each time. The eggplant pizza deserves all the heart eye emojis in the world. Thank goodness I live just a block away and am too embarrassed to order delivery (yet also, very lazy) because I would probably order this pizza once a week.
2015-07-17,2,Let me first start off with - this place USED TO BE one of my favorites. The food is excellent and totally affordable AND it's BYOB. I mean who could ask for more?!However the last time I went there with a group of girlfriends, we had a horrible experience. On the day of one of the women's world cup final games this year, we went to Johnny Pepperoni immediately following their win - of course with the game being late-ish in the day, we sent our friend up to the restaurant before closing so she could get us a table for when we arrived - which she did. She arrived at 9:40 - and the place officially closes at 10 - so we figured - OK we're safe. Seated WELL before closing. We were WRONG.When our friend arrived and asked for a table, the place was in full swing - full tables outside and a handful of tables inside. She was greeted by the host who told her "if you want to eat, you need to order by 9:45 - also we shut the doors at 10:30 so you have to be done by then." WOW - great customer service right?When she sat down, they forced her to order for all of us since we were still trying to get there - so she scrambled to get answers while the waiter hovered impatiently. It was one of her first times there, so she had to guess. And finally when we arrived moments later, we realized she hadn't put in the full order. No big deal right? They give you bread at the table to nosh on, we'll survive. NOPE. We sat for 20mins, no offer of bread or even water from the wait staff. We actually had to flag a waiter down to ask if we could have some!The experience at that point was so bad, that we ate our meal and got the hell out of dodge well before their 10:30 mandatory heave-ho. Moral of the story - if you're going here, go early, because apparently this restaurant doesn't give a crap about its customers when it's close to closing time.As for us - there are enough places in Hoboken that we can go to that this place won't see us for quite awhile.
2015-07-11,4,Been here multiple times and love the pies. Big fan of the chicken parm pie.  Took my family there tonight for the first time and we're NYC pizza snobs so it's hard to impress us and they all liked it. The Sicilian pies is good as well and my mom and wife liked the mushroom pie. Had the clams oreganata for an app and wasn't that impressed though.  They were kind of small and too much reading, not enough clam.  Overall great place to eat and BYOB, is never a bad thing.
2015-07-09,5,great local spot for pizza, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken on bone is great too.  BYO.  nice outside area too.
2015-06-15,4,Definitely the best chicken wings in town according to those who tried them in our lunch party! Very kid friendly, local spot with a great ambience and BYOB. Plus point is that it has a kids menu when most local pizza joints in hoboken do not have them. We ordered the eggplant and chicken parm round pies, both very nice. The pizza is different - not quite your thin crust Italian style you get at grimaldis, but thin and tasty nevertheless. Looking forward to trying out their square pies too!
2015-06-12,5,Yum yum yum yum yum! I wish I  could take this restaurant back to Houston! The best pizza I've ever had! We have Grimaldi's in Houston which I like, but this is my favorite! ! Loved the chicken parm pizza, so original!
2015-06-06,5,If you're looking for a GREAT New York pizza joint, with a very local feel, and great service, come here! Better than Grimaldi's, and just we will definitely be coming back many times! The chicken parm pizza was awesome, and so was the classic pepperoni! Don't miss this place!!!!
2015-05-26,3,It's BYOB and the menu is mainly pies & salad so it's very affordable! A group of girlfriends met here and we split the bill for a whopping $12 each! Very tasty - a little scrunched for space inside but not bad. It's nice to sit outside. Fast eats & good for small groups & sharing!
2015-05-02,4,A great spot in Hoboken- nice location and outdoor seating when the weather is nice.  I've been here a bunch of times and the food and service is consistently good.  Whenever I go, I always seem to have Dominic as a server who is very knowledgable about the menu and also very personable, which makes the experience at JP even more enjoyable.I've had almost all of the pizzas and they are all phenomenal.  Another favorite dish of mine is the linguine with pesto, shrimp, and walnuts pasta..so good!! My friend's boyfriend had the chicken parm and said it was awesome- perfect amount of ingredients. On my most recent visit, we ordered the barbecue wings and burrata appetizers which were specials for the night.  Both were delicious, however slightly overpriced.  13 dollars for 10 barbecue wings? A little steep..but I'll let it slide for the deliciousness of the food.  Also, there always seems to be a lot of screaming children at this place.  Tip: Come later when it's past the kids' bedtimes. :)
2015-03-24,4,I love their pizza. No matter what the toppings you cheese the freshness of the pizza base and mozzarella cheese creates the base for the wonderful flavor. Just be careful when you ask them to add olives or capers. Sometimes those can add slightly uncomfortable salt levels to the pizza.
2015-03-17,5,I love this place! Came in on a Friday around 7, and we were seated right away. The place was a little loud because just about every table had 2+ kids seated but it was early on a Friday so it's to be expected.They are BYO and do not charge a corking fee (awesome) and I LOVED their wine glasses. They're just small juice glasses which  are so old school in my opinion. Our server Anwar was busy but over to our table immediately to greet us and to tell is he would be over in a minute. We had a caprese salad app which was a special and great. And then for dinner the prosciutto and arugula pie which was so delicious. This is definitely my new go to spot for pizza and I can't wait to try the other items. Our check was $35 which is such a deal for such good food and fabulous service.
2015-03-11,3,We've ordered from here a few times before and it has always been decent. Nothing exceptional, but good enough pizza to go back. Called in for a single Clam pizza delivery at 7:15 on a Weds, was told it would be 40-45 mins. We live in Southwest Hoboken, so that's understandable. Still nothing an hour later so I called to confirm. Was told delivery guy had left. Shows up 15 mins later with under seasoned, soggy in the middle, disappointing pizza. If it weren't for the leftover Spicy Basil Classico sauce we doused the pizza in, I'd still be hungry right now.Moral of the story? Don't wait til you're really hungry to order. And don't even THINK about comparing Johnny's clam pie to Stamford's Frank Pepe. Whole other league.
2015-03-02,5,Love love love this place! Great service, great food. Only thing I wish they had was gluten free pizza and pasta options for some of my friends that can't enjoy some of the delish meals.
2015-02-24,3,This place is as pretty average. I had high hopes when I first walked in. The smell of the place was unbelievable. I couldn't wait to get my food after smelling the restaurant.Service was great. Waiter was very attentive and friendly. The bus boy was very friendly too. We ordered the prosciutto pizza as an appetizer. It was delicious. I would definitely come back here to try some more of their pizza. I had the chicken parmigiana for dinner. It wasn't anything special. I actually just ended up eating mostly the cheese and sauce off of the chicken. I recommend this place if you want a nice BYOB to keep things cheap and a good gourmet pizza. If I went back I would probably just stick to pizza and not order an entree.
2015-01-26,5,This has been my #1 fav spot in Hoboken for a few years now. Always consistent and delicious. I have tried nearly everything on their regular menu over the years (which they don't change up much) but they always have amazing specials that are worth trying. I've never had a thing I did not like from there...and I consider myself pretty picky; particularly in regards to Italian food, cleanliness and consistency.Everyone I bring here loves it... Too bad there's only one location. The owner is a really nice guy. He also owns City Bistro. His mom is a super nice lady too. You can tell that each of their places are well-run; it really shows in the happiness and friendliness of the staff and overall vibes of each establishment.The atmosphere here is cute and casual but they never make you feel rushed. Nice touch that JP's is BYOB. Also nice that both JP's and City Bistro are very dog friendly and they don't mind seating you outside with your dog at all, weather permitting. Some of my favorite menu items are their eggplant parm dish, eggplant/capers pizza, the broccoli rabe pie they do, and the green salad dressing is really delish.
2015-01-26,5,My husband and I are big fans of this place. The food is really good, but the servers are excellent. Everyone that has waited on us has been accomodating, polite, efficient and just genuinely really kind. That's a rarity!!Food-wise, he usually gets a pizza and the spaghetti and meatballs, I get the escarole and the pomodoro (I know, we are disgusting pigs), and usually take home approximately 6 to go containers with leftovers. I do wish they had more seafood or healthier options on the menu so I didn't have to carbo-load every time I came for dinner, but who am I kidding, pass the pasta.
2015-01-20,5,I've ordered and picked up from Johnny's and I've eaten there as well.  The service is good, especially the one time me and some pals from work were eating outside and a rain shower decided to come out of nowhere at 7pm causing us to move inside.  Needless to say, the staff did their best and got us in and gave us new pies to make up for the soggy ones.  I def recommend the square pie.  Its got fresh basil and garlic with a good amount of olive oil. I've gotten the square pie with half mushrooms and pepperoni (its only right).  Both toppings taste great and a square pie can give for 8 people maybe more  - its super filling!
2015-01-06,4,Great byob place. I had the buffalo chicken wigs appetizer special to start and they were delicious, completely exceeded my expectations with just the right amount of heat and flavor. I had the thin crust pizza with pepperoni, onions and olives. Now, the pizza is delicious, but the amount of toppings is RIDICULOUS, they had 5 pepperoni slices piled on too of each other all over the pizza and the olives were Greek olives instead of black olives like the menu stated, which was curveball. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was yummy, but they need to calm down on the toppings and black olives are way better than Greek on pizza, hands down.
2015-01-05,4,This is my neighborhood pizza place.  Whenever we want something close that won't disappoint, it's usually Johnny Pepperoni (despite the cheesy name).  One thing I don't see mentioned in the other reviews I looked through: their salads are also quite good.  The ingredients are consistently fresh and portions generous.  The pizza is very good (I'd recommend their pizza over pasta) and I love that it's BYO.  The service is attentive eight out ten times which is good enough for me.  It does get rather noisy when it's crowded and the weather is such that they can't open their doors; I'm not sure that there's much they can do about that.
2015-01-04,4,Really liked the food here, just beware of the "specials" prices. Penne vodka with chicken and garlic over linguine was $24. Although it was very good, it hardly felt special when we got the bill for: one appetizer, two entrees + 20% tip which came to $80.  So, great food, but fairly pricey for Hoboken.
2014-12-31,1,It's New Years tonight and I call them to place a delivery order. The girl who picks up the phone tells me that the last delivery order is 9:20pm. I call at 9:00 pm and says sorry we have closed the deliveries. She conveniently forgets that she mislead me and then when I ask her for her name . She lies and says some random name  "crystal"The owner Rich  gets on the phone and starts yelling in my ear about his delivery guys have gone home and there is nothing he can do . He doesn't have a clue why the front desk girl would lie( apparently she works for him.. What great training)  He uses offensive language and raises his voice and keeps repeating why I am not ok with them closing early and going home ..... What a nightmare !!!!! Is this customer service ??? The worst place ever . At least standup to your word you liars !!! Never again !!!!Worst experience ever !!!
2014-12-27,3,Service is ok. Selection is limited. Not a true fan of this place. Don't see a good reason to recommend the place.
2014-12-27,4,Casual pizza place that makes my head spin because I think their main Italian dishes (Especially their chicken piccata) are phenomenal while their pizza is just average. I like going here for Italian dishes and Napoli's for pizza. The chicken piccata tastes like if you made it at home, it's so good. The waiters at the place are an interesting bunch-they will go above and beyond for you. A friend of mine left something behind after a meal and server kept it safe until we went back for it. We also brought our own wine, finished it up, and jokingly asked them for more wine. The waiter then said that people sometimes don't finish their BYO wine and the restaurant holds onto them so they don't go to waste...we each got an extra glass of free wine. That was pretty awesome. It's a casual place, ambiance is nothing special (feels like an old school pizzeria), and some tables/chairs are uncomfortable, but food (minus pizza) and service is phenomenal. Pizza isn't bad, just nothing special and there is better in the area. I would recommend.
2014-12-19,5,Anytime guests come in town we eat here. Good casual, BYOB family restaurant. The service is great and the food is even better. I love all the pastas, but probably my favorite is the Rigatoni.
2014-12-09,5,Going to try this place tonight probably.  Anyone else feel really, really bad for "Donna F"'s boyfriend (see below)? She basically wrote a 10 page article for "fake wine glasses, portions too big (who complains about that?!)"
2014-12-05,5,Nothing beats pizza from Johnny Pepperoni - fresh ingredients (as in REAL mushrooms not from a can) and great sauce. Screaming kids and wait times on the weekends are a downer but it's worth the sacrifice for the best pizza in town.
2014-11-23,1,Just adequate and if you settle than fine.  I'm tired of settling or saying not my last meal. Meatballs just okay, not enough sauce and pasta too andante. The veal, though. Okay meal but nothing to brag about.  Service I'd brag about.
2014-11-19,5,Not only is the pizza fantastic so are their apps and entrees. Don't miss out on the arincini, the best ever. Salads are awesome too. All around great place. Wish they took reservations, at least for large parties. Keeps me from coming with a large group.
2014-11-16,5,My fiance and I love this place.  I've eaten here several times and have always had a good experience.  The wait staff is friendly.  Love that it's BYOB.  Exposed brick and open kitchen.  You can sit at the bar if it's too crowded to get a table.  Red and white checkered table cloths and old time Italian photographs on the walls.  Your BYOB wine is poured into water glasses for you but I don't mind it.We've ordered several things on the menu but always come back to the fried eggplant pizza.  It is delicious.  Great flavor.  I usually order without the capers which can be a bit too salty.  I prefer the thin crust but if you ask they can make it on the square pie for you.  It has never disappointed.  The chicken parm is pretty good.  Decent sized portion.Overall a great place to relax over decent food with an unpretentious energetic atmosphere.
2014-11-10,5,Enjoyed Johnny Pepperoni's more than I had anticipated! We dined around 8pm on a Friday night and were lucky enough to get seated right away at a table for four. The service was very good and fast. It's BYOB so that's a plus. Was a little unimpressed by the "wine glasses" which are actually just small juice glasses but that's not worthy of losing a star! For an appetizer we had the Cherry Tomato and Ricotta Bruschetta which was really good. It's basically a cherry tomato sliced a couple times with ricotta cheese and bread. Different than the traditional bruschetta but I really liked it. For an entree I had the Eggplant Parmigiana which came in an individual skillet and was layers of thinly sliced (not too thin) eggplant with great sauce and a good amount of mozzarella cheese. Great Eggplant Parm!Definitely hope to try the pizzas next time around!
2014-11-09,5,This is one of our favorite spots to celebrate. We've worked our way through the list of specialty pizzas, and I have to say that the clam pizza was my favorite, but they are all very good. I'd recommend starting with the meat and cheese platter, but only if you are feeling very hungry because the servings of food are very generous.
2014-10-29,3,The pizza here is very good; my boyfriend and I have ordered take-out from here a few times in the past and we've always been pleased with the quality of the ingredients and the consistency of the pizza crusts (not gummy or rock-hard). That being said, though...I wouldn't necessarily want to eat inside on a Saturday night again. Let me explain.We stopped at a nearby liquor store to pick up a bottle of red wine to have with dinner on Saturday (10/25). The "wine glasses" were actually juice glasses, but I was willing to overlook that. The noise level indoors was insane; maybe it was because it must have been Take Your Shrieking Hellbeast Spawn To Johnny Pepperoni Day (I swear, people, two words: birth control. Look into it, won't you? Thank you.) But thanks to the delicious wine, we were able to block out most of the distracting sounds, although I couldn't understand 80% of what our waiter said when he mentioned the specials to us (sorry Edwin).We ordered the fried calamari with mushrooms as an appetizer, and it was huge. We both knew there was no way we could finish it. Most of it was pretty good, although I think some of the calamari pieces were chewier than they should have been, and one of the dipping sauces had an odd lemony aftertaste. For our main courses, I ordered the Spaghetti al Pomodoro, and my boyfriend had the rigatoni with sausage in a white wine sauce. Both dishes were cooked well, but again, the portions were simply too large for us to handle, and we ended up having to take some home. I liked the tomato sauce with my dish; it was a rustic-style sauce with pieces of tomato skin and seeds scattered throughout, but it wasn't overly heavy or rich. I sampled some of my boyfriend's rigatoni and liked the white wine sauce, as well.Our service overall was spotty; I think Edwin may have forgotten about us from time to time because he was busy manning the register as well as cleaning off tables and maneuvering his way around screaming children. But he maintained a pleasant attitude the entire time he waited on us, and he did check on us to see how we liked our meals, so that was good, at least.If we ever were to come back to Johnny Pepperoni, I think a random weeknight would be best for us (like, say Tuesday night). Weekends may be off-limits for us.
2014-10-20,5,I am a huge fan of this establishment and go regularly with my friends. I highly recommending the pizza (especially pepperoni), but their entrees are delicious as well. They are BYOB, so they are great for a large party. The best part is price. If you split pizza, appetizers, and dessert, you can still spend under $20-$25 per person.
2014-10-01,3,great service, very good food...excellent pjzza..
2014-09-28,5,Ignore the malcontents. Best pizza in Hoboken if you like thin crust. Everything tastes fresh and the toppings such as the sausage are especially juicy. I would recommend this place
2014-09-14,5,Still on the heels of my daughter's 2nd birthday party today, I would like to say the party was executed with perfection by Moira and the staff at Johnny Pepperoni's. I'd love to also highlight Julius the head server of the day who was a complete pleasure and always ready to help and answer any questions. The food was superb, and the atmosphere and decor was perfect for a party with the front doors/windows open lending themselves for guests to enjoy the end of summer. The staff is more than willing to accommodate with any request including asking the preferred music. It was a party that catered to mainly adults, and everyone left pleased and full. We will definitely consider the restaurant for any future celebrations.
2014-09-07,5,We tried Johnny's again and DEFINITELY have returned to their pepperoni ways! Thank you!
2014-09-05,5,One of my favorites in Hoboken.  Great pizza, pasta and BYOB is icing on the cake.  The rice balls/fritters are a great appetizer nice a crispy exterior with the a warm cheesy interior.  Can't go wrong with any entree, I am a big fan of the Sicilian Baked Cavatappi & Cheese.  On the pizza side of things they have plenty of unique topping combinations or you can build your own in either original thin crust or a square pie.  A Chicken Parm square pie is my favorite loaded with plenty of chicken.
2014-08-30,1,I used to love this place until they decided that patrons with children in strollers were not allowed.  Tonight was an awful experience.  The hostess sat us with a stroller but the waiter made a point to come over and say no strollers.  My baby was falling alseep so I asked that it be allowed and he said no and that he specifically spoke with the owner and he said no.  I asked him to not be a jerk about it and let us stay and he told me I should have left my child at home like he would have done with his 4 children.  A kid that was going to sleep should not have been out.  We were regular patrons and actually thinking of having a party there but this is the second time that we felt that we were second class citizens for having a child.  In a town that survives on servicing families, I am shocked that a waiter felt like he could take this attitude and told us off and that we should leave and I had no class.  So sad....
2014-08-25,5,Quite possibly the best pizza in Hoboken. Service always courteous and attentive. It is very crowded at night. But always a table for lunch.
2014-08-24,4,I've lived in Hoboken for ten years (uptown) yet didn't know this place existed.Read the Yelp reviews and decided to give it a try.  Ordered a pizza today and picked it up.  Staff on the phone and at the restaurant were friendly and helpful with double parking tips :)The sausage and broccoli rabe specialty pizza was good sized and delicious (not too salty, not too greasy, like the red pepper flakes for a little kick).  Only suggestion is to specify on the menu that it is a white pizza.  I missed that detail.Definitely will be back!
2014-08-22,5,Great food, cute ambiance!  Pizza is always fresh and delicious.  I'm also a huge fan of their salads..the radicchio is delish!  Out with family, friends, or a date..Johnny Pepperoni caters to all.
2014-08-14,4,Great byob pizza spot in Hobokes. While different in appeal and menu, I think this tastes better than San Giuseppe just up the street.  Boyfriend and I came to this spot Thursday at 8pm- it was empty but people started slowly trickling in. They have plenty of seating both in and outdoors. The service is also really great; waters always refilled, made recommendations and was knowledgable about the food. We started off with a special caprese salad which was heirloom tomato, balsamic, mozzarella (very good) and basil- was there was more basil. We then had half of the sausage and broccoli Rabe specialty pie (loved the biting red onions on there- its a white pizza) and half of the fried eggplant with capers - I really loved this one.  The crust was especially soft and gooey despite thin crust- a lot of thin crusts tend to be really dry. I would definitely recommend this spot for overall food, service and ambiance. It's a good value too- our totally meal came to some $35.
2014-07-29,3,I'm all about the local joints, and in the last year there have been more than a few new Hoboken artisan type pizzas. This particular one really excels in super friendly service, and portions. As far as pizza quality goes, I'm still giving the crown to Dozzinos, but this is about on par with San Giuseppe, and better than Grimaldi's. We started with an antipasto plate, and there was a ton of meat there. We followed that up with a pizza with ricotta and prosciutto, which again, was totally loaded with meat. A solid pizza for sure, and a solid 3.5 star joint. Bonus points for the Italian wine glasses.
2014-07-28,4,My dad still can't stop talking about the food and when I come home, the first thing he always asks is if I brought Johnny Pepperoni's with me. Great atmosphere, BYOB (liquor store right up the street on Washington). Haven't had a bad meal yet.
2014-07-11,1,I lived across the street from this restaurant's location for nearly 20 years. Here's some of what the manager, Richard Falco, told me when I politely (really) asked if he would close the doors that open into 11th St so the noise from a birthday celebration wouldn't carry: "shut up and go home" "my uncle's a cop" "I've lived here for 35 years" "the problem with this town is people like you who move in and make it difficult for everyone" "my family runs this town". Needless to say I'll never eat there again...
2014-06-25,5,Really one of my favorite places to eat.  Pizza is great, atmosphere is cozy, and the service is outstanding.  Believe it or not this is one of the best places to get wings ive been to.  Its not on the regular menu but they have it almost every night as a special.  Usually get it with raw mushrooms, also not on regular menu, but they are happy to accommodate.  Also not too pricey since its BYO
2014-06-15,4,The family and I have been here twice now and we love it. The pizzas are a bit unique -- more artisan pizza than conventional NY or Italian pizza. A good place to go when you want pizza but something with a bit more creativity.The last time we went, we also got a pasta and was quite pleased with that too. The service here has always been excellent. They have nice quality kids cups with spill-proof lids which is always useful. We actually take the cups home with us because we can get a few uses out of them -- might as well since I assume they discard them anyways.
2014-06-12,5,While their pizza is very good, the dish you need to try here is the Chicken Diablo. A simple dish of grilled chicken w/ spices over a bed of sauteed peppers and onions, yet it is one of the best dishes I've had in recent memory. Easily the best entree Hoboken has to offer. The chicken is sliced, tender and bursting with flavor and the peppers rock it out. Don't miss it.
2014-06-07,1,I just feel like these guys need to be put on blast. First let me say that all of my friends love this place and I was going from their reviews. My husband, baby daughter and I just got turned away because we have a stroller. Let me explain. My daughter is 6 months old and was sleeping in a stroller that we wanted to have inside the outdoor area which was very spacious and not busy. Seriously? There is no reason for that. Every single place in this town allows it. Another badly run restaurant in Hoboken we will not be going to. I will also to make sure my friends with babies on Hoboken mommies know as well.
2014-06-07,5,I love Johnny Pepperoni with all my heart. It's amazing from start to finish. Last night we got the eggplant bruschetta and ricotta bruschetta and both were delicious. The ricotta cheese is insanely good. It's so fresh. Then we got the green salad. It's plain but the dressing on it is addictive. We also got a half plain/half mushroom pizza that was great. We were planning on taking some home but two of us finished the whole thing because we couldn't stop eating it. I also love that it's a byob with lots of outdoor seating. I can't say a single bad thing about this place. Can't wait to go back!!
2014-05-27,5,Super fabulous pizza! I lived in California for 10 years and to come back and find this gem! Just lucky! They are service oriented and really deliver top service to customers! Cheers!
2014-05-22,4,Our food came out pretty slowly, but I still liked Johnny Pepperoni a lot.There were 3 of us at our table and 2 pizzas was just the right amount of food for us.  We ordered a sausage and broccoli rabe pie and an arugula and proscuitto pie.  The sausage pizza was a bit spicy in a good way.  The arugula pizza had a LOT of arugula.  If you are trying to prevent making a mess (but why would you?) you iwll have to take some of the arugula off.  Everything tasted great; the pizza had a nice thin crust.Each pizza was about $17 which I felt was a fair price.  Parking is a challenge, but if you are able to walk to Johnny Pepperoni it is worth trying.
2014-05-15,1,If you like to be told-that there is a  35 minute wait, while there are tables empty; then this place is for you. BYOB, is a must... considering that you have to be drunk to tolerate the rude and insensitive behavior of the staff. "buon appetito"
2014-05-06,3,Pretty fast delivery. The pizza was good... It was a plain round but with very very little basil- I think it was two thin strips which was pretty surprising. It doesn't have a traditional margherita style as they use reg shredded mozz cheese and not fresh (or so it seems) but it was good.I also asked for extra marinara sauce which I didn't get.The mushroom salad was delicious though. The dressing was divine and definitely would recommend that.Their white pizzas looked good! May order that next time.
2014-05-02,4,The service was ok. The waiter forgot the day's special. But that's ok, neither of us wanted the special anyways. The environment is great. The food smells delicious. Meatballs and spaghetti is very good. The antipasti platter is indeed very good. BYOB
2014-04-16,2,Ordered a pepperoni pizza delivered to my home. The pizza was too oily for my taste. Not a fan.
2014-04-11,5,Absolutely love Johhny Pepps!!  You can't go wrong with anything here!  We've been a bunch of times - probably 7 or 8, and have had everything from the shrimp scampi entree special, chicken diavolo (unique take on it, but delicious nonetheless!), chicken parm, marinated mushroom salad, to our all-time favorites and go-to's: proscuitto & arugula pie and sicilian cavatappi.  Although the sicilian cavatappi is on the entree list, we order it as an appetizer to share.  And the name is somewhat deceiving since it doesn't let you know exactly how amazing it is - it's a creamy mac & cheese with spicy sausage.  Omg!!  Everyone we take here raves about this dish.  The decor is also really fun evoking an old-school Italian trattoria.  There are black & white photos of Hoboken, NYC and Frank Sinatra throughout the restaurant, which gives it a nice and warm feel.  And the waiters couldn't be friendlier.  There's also an outdoor section that's really nice to enjoy during warmer weather.  Go!  You won't regret it :)
2014-03-23,5,Came here last night for my birthday and would definitely return! The staff is extremely attentive, accommodating, and thoughtful - Rich, our waiter, brought out the most delicious tiramisu after he overheard it was my birthday - so sweet! The tiramisu was amazing too!It's a bit loud inside, but the food, staff, and fun atmosphere make that nothing more than a minute detail. Give it a shot - you won't be disappointed.
2014-03-20,5,Love all the food here! Tonight I had the radicchio salad and eggplant parm. They were even awesome enough to make it dairy free for me bc I'm lactose intolerant. The waiter heard that it was my birthday and was so sweet to surprise me with a b day dessert. Great service and food as always!
2014-03-14,5,All I can say is NUTELLA PIZZA!  Not only is the regular pizza and other food amazing, but this dessert pizza is unreal.
2014-03-06,5,Best pizza in town, sit down or delivery. Don't even waste your time or appetite on Grimaldi's. J Pep's is always packed. Good for adult or for families.
2014-02-18,4,My wife and I really enjoyed this place. Great service, really good food. I started with the anti pasti and the wife had the aracini, both very good.  The bread was awesome.  The pizza was very good.  I wish I could have eaten more because the specials sounded great.  Next time this Philly family visits Hoboken, it will def be a food stop.
2014-02-16,4,Great service and the food was very good. The meatballs are delicious as are their crab stuffed mushroom special. The veal Marsala was good as well but the best is at Leo's for that. The Caesar salad was okay. I'll be back to try their pizza.
2014-01-31,4,Great place for a casual date night out. Or bring the whole family because kids are clearly welcome. Either way be sure to try the pan pizza and the Nutella pie for dessert. It's very obvious and refreshing that everyone from the hostess to the busboy are concerned about your happiness. Good food and good service would be enough to give this place a try, but then throw in the fact that the BYOB helps keep the bill low and what you have is a recipe for success.
2014-01-31,4,Overall great food and atmosphere. Casual pizzeria that is very kid friendly. Beware if you have a stroller as it is a tight space so you may be asked to sit in the back. The pizza is great although the round pizzas are one size and a little smaller than a traditional large (only 6 slices). They also have square pizzas that are larger (8 slices) which have a bit thicker crust.  The service is fantastic! The waitstaff and hostesses are wonderful and super friendly. They have a great selection of non pizza dinners as well and the Nutella pizza and gelato are delicious dessert options.
2014-01-25,5,My FAVORITE pizza place. I love white pizza with mushrooms and I always add some ruccola...its DELICIOUS!!!!!
2013-12-31,5,We love this place.  We actually live above it and frequent at least once a week.  The atmosphere is friendly, cozy and very enjoyable. There are great pie options and it's BYOB so for a few bucks you can split some pizzas and a bottle of wine and have a great time. The owner is there often (if not always) and always makes sure everything is good. Definitely recommend trying it out!
2013-12-03,5,My boyfriend and I LOVE this place. It is a great place to go for a date or even with a larger group of friends. The atmosphere is more relaxed but still nice. Nice outdoor seating when the weather is warm enough. Note that they don't take reservations, but our group of 12 called ahead of time to give them a heads up, and came in and didnt have to wait long at all. It is BYOB so you can choose to bring whatever beverage you'd like to enjoy.
2013-11-14,2,Went twice, once for entrees and once for pizza. Two times too many. Not the worst thing I ever had but not worth a repeat visit, especially in Hoboken. Great for those looking for a Chuck E. Cheese experience where kids are welcome to run wild. There should be cages for the kids and the parents who don't know how to eat out with children. Not Johnny's fault but just the icing on the bad cake.
2013-11-06,5,I went here on a Saturday night at 7 pm and it was packed. They told us a 40 minute wait but it turned into an hour which was the only downfall of the night. However, the owner (Johnny himself) saw us waiting outside and gave us a complimentary plate of meats and cheese along w/ bread and eggplant!The food was delicious here, we ordered grandma's pizza (the square pie) and absolutely loved it! The mushroom pizza was a bit dry for me but other's enjoyed it. They also gave us these long peppers that were super spicy but so fresh and good.. For dessert we ordered Nutella Pizza and loved it! It was the perfect way to have nutella.  I would definitely recommend this place to others.
2013-10-26,4,We decided last night that we wanted to finally try this place out.  Being Hoboken residents, we realize that restaurants around here that don't take reservations can be hit or miss as far as wait times, we called around 7:20 to find that they had no wait.  However the guy on the phone did stress that while they had open tables right now, there was a chance it could be packed by the time we got there.  Well we ended up finishing some drinks and heading over, and he couldn't have been more right.  When we walked in they were quoting a wait time of 80 min.  Since we didn't want to wait around for over an hour, we ordered some food to go and brought it home.  The food was ready to go in about 15 min and we were on way back home.We ordered the proscuitto and arugula pizza, which was my husbands favorite.  Great thin crispy crust and great taste!  We also go the mushroom pie, which was good, but just based on the ingredients used is a bit dry (no pizza sauce or liquidy replacement).  We also shared the marinated mushroom pizza, which was good, but misleading, because the mushrooms were not marinated, they were just your run of the mill garden mushroom.  I realize my food review makes it sound like the food was just eh, but honestly the flavors are great, and we will definitely be going back, but at an earlier time to avoid the wait!
2013-10-25,4,This place is a perfect example of the greatness of BYO.  Kicked things off with an Eggplant pizza; the capers were kind of polarizing.  I thought they were a great addition, but some don't like the taste.  Tip:  if you don't like capers, ask for it without capers.  Ditto anything else you don't like.  This is some high level intelligence i'm giving you here...The square pizza is a monster and really good, but it's a normal crust so don't expect Sicilian.  The cavatappi was creamy and unexpectedly spicy (in a good way).  I was the lucky winner and got to take the leftovers home; both heated up great in the oven for lunch the next day!Also worth noting, it was quite hot inside so we ate outside (since October in NJ is now a warm weather month), and while the hostess( or maybe manager) came off a bit gruff, the waitress (who said she had just started) and bus boy (who should probably consider a career in hospitality he was so friendly) both left lasting impressions of great neighborhood service.Would def recommend and will be back.
2013-10-08,5,What kind of a momo orders chicken at a restaurant?  I mean its so easy to make at home!  I do.  Because it's the bomb.com.  You are missing out if you haven't has their chicken a la diavolo.  For all you ISA and paleo freaks this dish is sanctioned.  And it's delicious.  Stepping away from the delicious healthy part if our meal, comes the Sicilian baked cavatappi. It's like Mac n cheese on speedball.  Sausage, oven dried cherry tomatoes, homemade bread crumbs in a Parmesan cream sauce.  Count me in.  This is very rich so don't order and your main, either share it as a pasta course or split as a side for the table, but don't miss it.
2013-09-18,5,My other favorite pizza place in town (along with Grimaldi's).  They have delicious specialty pies, my favorites being the spinach and broccoli rabe, the prosciutto and arugula, and the fried eggplant.  The pies definitely have a "gourmet" feel to them and are a little on the small side with thin crusts compared with other places.  The square pies are good too, but a little heavy for my liking.But it's not just about pizza!  The foods they serve are also generally a few steps above your standard pizzeria fare.They make an excellent chicken parm which comes in a piping hot dish and is smothered with cheese and cooked to perfection.  The rice balls are incredible and they are so rich and creamy they taste almost like they are filled with risotto instead of rice.The calamari is pretty standard what you'd expect.  The clams weren't the greatest....get something else.  The wings are actually pretty good (buffalo and barbecue flavors).The pizzas are actually a little pricey for the size, so this is not the place to order pizza from on football Sunday....rather it is the place to order from (or visit) when you you're looking to class-up your pizza game a bit with something a bit fancier than the standard pizza parlor.I went here with a large group once and I think we overwhelmed them....food was good but service was slow, which is not the norm when we've gone with just a few people.Great little BYO for date night.  Don't forget the chianti...
2013-08-24,5,Love Johnny Pepperoni!  This place is great-  the atmosphere is fun and casual.  BYOB!  A good place for a casual date or to go with a bunch of girlfriends.  I always see a ton of families here with small kids.  The pizza is so good...I'm a big fan of the white pizza with mushrooms or the eggplant pizza.  Highly recommend!
2013-08-08,2,The staff really downgrades this place. Their lack of professionalism and overall rudeness makes me never want To return to this place. Also, I couldn't figure out what the deal was with the AC. It was so hot that the staff was sweating everywhere and grossing me out. The hostesses were inept and instead of helping out the servers were smoking outside with the manager--during dinner rush. I was shocked. The food was good and the ambience may be better if you sit outside. Inside is so noisy and the servers compounded it by slamming dishes and yelling.
2013-07-31,5,I have a special loyalty to this place. During Sandy they were one of the very few places that were open, warm and served good food. I just remember the feeling of going there and feeling better. It's a neighborhood spot that is pretty far from Path, so you mainly see locals or people who specifically come to Johnny Pepperoni. There is usually a bit of a wait time (~20min), but that's because they're so good and busy. JP is a BYOB, which is awesome and budget-friendly. The staff is great and if you go there a lot, you can tell they remember you. I have three favorites at JP: prosciutto and arugula pizza, mushroom pizza and the Nutella desert pizza. You need to try all three, but especially the first one: it seems crazy, but it's like eating a fresh salad on top of a great slice of pizza. The salads are great too, but they're huge! I'm a pretty small person, so one serving is big enough to be a full meal. I always get one to share. Johnny Pepperoni is good for kids and an amazing spot for warm summer evenings. Definitely recommend checking it out!
2013-07-22,4,Great spot. Definitely a good, inexpensive option in Hoboken. we split a thin crust peperoni pizza and it was very good - nice and crispy. I've had pizza at ton of other Hoboken spots, including Grimaldi, and this is the best hands down. We also each had  the green salad which is a meal in itself and our total tab before tax/tip was $28. Service is great. They have outdoor seating which is key in the summer. We've also have had the chicken which is very tasty. For the price, its hard to beat
2013-07-19,5,Love me some Johnny's! The square pie and radicchio salad are my favorites. Great service, lots of space and BYOB. Oh and where else can you get a nutella pizza!
2013-07-19,4,The servers are always very nice. I had some bad take out once. They were very apologetic and concerned with making us happy the next time we came in. Mistakes happen and they were very classy about it .A hair on the pricey side, but Ira a good meal and they are very family friendly. Always a plus in our book.
2013-07-10,5,Their pizza was absolutely delicious.  A bunch of us went for our dinner of the month and we got the chicken parm pizza and grandma pie. The grandma pie was the best!! Service was really good. They were very friendly and BYOB is always the best!  Seating outside was really nice.
2013-07-01,4,Love the pizza here and the service is very good.  Huge portions and good prices. It is also very kid friendly.  May be the best pizza in Hoboken.
2013-06-16,4,Thank you Johnny whoever you are...BYOB.Great service.Nice selection for a pizza place (apps, salads, dessert, PIZZA)I had the caesar salad and three of the pizzas (Square Pie, Mushroom Fontina, Chicken Parm).  Outdoor seating available.  Overall I am giving four stars for the taste and price point.  When all was said and done the bill came to $15 per person.  I would definitely recommend this place for large groups of people getting together to couples catching a meal.
2013-06-09,5,ok so I went there last night for dinner and I woke up dreaming about- i'm serious... It would be so great if someone actually brought me a pie right about now...So AMAZING service. They were constantly checking up on us, making sure everything was good, refilling our waters, and anything else we neededBYOB- always a great thing!ok, so for appetizers we got the ricotta bruschetta- that was soo sooo good-- a lit tip for them I wish it had some balsamic drizzle, but still great. The calamari- really good, and came with two dipping sauces. The green salad and the Caesar salad- both good and the dressing was good and not too much..Now for the best part- the pizza- we ordered 3 pies- the grandma, the mushroom and fontina, and the chicken parm. ALL THREE WERE GREAT. We asked them to cut the slices smaller so everyone at the table could sample them, and they did. My favorite was the grandma slice, then the chicken parm, then the mushroom. Everyone at the table enjoyed the pizzas... I really wanna go back and get some more..We sat outside on the outdoor patio and it was a gorgeous night out. We sat there awhile finishing our drinks and we were not rushed at all to leave. Great experience, definitely wanna come back!!
2013-05-10,3,This place is dangerous - I ate twice as much as I needed! Seriously - thin crust pizza with hot pickled peppers, onions and mushrooms = amazing!  I'm giving it only 3 stars because I still prefer Patsy's and a few other spots but this place is pretty solid, esp. if you live in the area. Crispy (i.e., non soggy NY style) pizza with plenty of toppings on offer is hard to dislike!
2013-05-10,1,they do not offer gluten free pizza as they claim to introduce.
2013-04-21,4,On the first Sunny warm evening I knew this was just to the place to finally try. I called ahead to make sure their patio was open and it was. Not too crowded around 7 pm so we swung by Sasso's on the corner to get a bottle of wine, since Johnny's is BYOB. Our waiter was attentive. The menu is pretty decently sized. I got the chicken parm dinner because it's a good option to try to judge the quality of the food and it was delish!  Perfectly cooked, and tasty sauce. My date got the seafood special, which was also yummy. We sat until the place was closing down since the evening was so nice and ordered the zeppolis dessert, at only $5 bucks we wanted to give it a whirl - it was also so delish, a little doughier on the inside than the kind you get at a typical fair or carnival, but overall still delightful. Hidden back on a quiet St. Johnny's is definitely worth a repeat visit!
2013-04-15,5,It took me 2 years to finally get to Johnny Pepperonis!  Because if you live in Hoboken you are always wary of new pizza places because why try to fix something that isnt broke ie Grimaldis & Napolis.  I was extremely impressed not only with the fantastic food but the wait staff were top notch.  We were a party of 9 (including children) and they were very accommodating and didn't scoff when we walked in, like many places do with that amount of people.The radicchio salad was outstanding!  I will be tasked to bring one to my sister every time I go to visit her.  The fritto misto was good, not heavy or oiley.  And I could have eaten a plate of the rice balls all by myself! Finally to the pizza, we ordered the chicken parm pizza on thing crust.  The crust was crispy but not doughy.  The sauce wasn't sweet.  My stomach is growling thinking of it now!  We also ordered the square pizza, that was a denser crust with a sweeter sauce.  Both very good but I will definitely go back just for the chicken parm pizza!!We ended the lunch with zeppolis, one word for them delicious. Hopefully they will introduce a gluten free pizza, this way it can be a go-to with friends!
2013-04-13,4,One of my favorite pizza places in town, right up there with Grimaldi's and Napoli's.  I've only tried the thin-crust pizza so far, but it's good:  just the right amounts of sauce and cheese, and really great, high-quality toppings.  The sausage is probably the best in town, and the roasted mushrooms and peppers are good too.  The crust is more crispy than chewy - I like Napoli's better - but still good.  The antipasta is also good, and pretty filling, as it leans towards meats & cheeses as opposed to vegetables.  Plan on splitting it with a few other people if you still want to have room for the pizza.  When the weather is nice, the tree-lined patio is a great place to eat, and when it isn't, takeout is usually quick (30 mins or so).
2013-03-11,4,I enjoyed this place; best expressed in pros and cons:Pros:-cute & cozy atmosphere-BYOB - when is that not a plus? -Service was pretty good in that our water was always full and the table was always cleared in a timely manner, however, I noticed that our particular server didn't let us know the specials (I heard from another table)-food was pretty good; fresh ingredients.  We had:Chicken parm pizza - a tad bit small for my liking considering the price, but tasteyRadicchio Salad - tastey, but the "grilled pancetta" was NOT good and kind of ruined the salad for me.  All of the other components were good, but the pancetta was the consistency of really fatty, undercooked bacon.  When I've had pancetta in salads before, it's been little chunks that are to the point of crispy.  So this aspect was disappointingMarinated Mushroom Salad - very tastey and freshCons:-anything pertaining to the food, I listed above-VERY NOISEY!  I know this can only be controlled to a certain extent, but my goodness; a table of 6 sat down when we were mid-way through our meal, and they were so loud, I wanted to pack up and leave.-the glasses they give you for wine are totally impractical; they definitely should invest in some legit wine glasses, because I hate drinking wine from a 4oz glassOverall, I'd definitely go back, but they can use some fine-tuning.
2013-03-05,5,I absolutely LIVE for this pepperoni pizza! It's extremely well-seasoned and fresh (if more than a tad greasy).I've never eaten in the restaurant, but I've ordered delivery, and the pizza almost always arrives really hot. Sadly, it's definitely overpriced for the size, so I'm trying not to order as frequently...but it's really hard because it's so good!Also try the prosciutto and arugula!
2013-01-12,3,We had kind of a weird experience here. Table configuration wasn't working out so a huge party was taking up the bar waiting for a table while a smaller table sat empty for a long time, presumably waiting for another table nearby to empty for the large party. But there was nowhere for us to go. Once we got seated, the food was amazing as always (radicchio salad, rice balls, and a pizza are perfect for two with leftovers too). However, this wasn't the first time something was "off" about dining in so I would consider takeout in the future.
2012-12-31,4,Johnny Pepperoni has great food and the kids love this place ( pizza and cartoons).  Only issue here is the limited menu options. They should really expand the menu and add more meat options / specials.  The highlights for me are the bruschetta's, the pasta with broccoli rabe/sausage and the wife loves the ratatouille.
2012-12-29,5,Love this place! Have been at least 10 times since it opened. Food is great. Especially love the square pie (we get it with sausage and mushrooms - YUM). Their food is consistently good, and it's BYO which is nice.  They are very family friendly, and also have a nice outdoor area in the warm months. All of their food is great - and atmosphere is really nice too. Love it here!
2012-12-06,3,this was a solid 4-star experience (tasty food, great value, BYO, decent service etc) until the staff committed 2 of my most hated crimes in restaurant-working.For the record, i've been here twice:1. While drinking coffee and just after eating dinner and just receiving1 meal to-go, we (table of 3) were asked TO LEAVE.  if we're here 2.5 hours or something, not eating or drinking, i get it.  but we were here 1:20 and still had coffee in our cups.  the waitress came by and said they had a "wait time issue" and we had to leave.  deplorable.  additionally, the hostess was pacing back and forth all huffy and puffy giving us the "get the f out" look.  2. ordered pizza for pick up.  on the phone they said 25 minutes, i showed up in 20 and the pizza was completely cold.  had to put it in the oven.  i've ordered many pizzas in my day and have never had that happen from pick-up.  3.  (this is a just a misdemeanor) after our salad was served we noticed all the surrounding tables had heaping baskets of delicious looking fresh bread.  people forget, nbd, however when we did get the bread, it was one-slice and 1 butter packet per person.  what kind of an italian restaurant are you?!?!?!? is it because i'm not italian?!?! as someone who waitressed as a teenager, knowing your timing is a basic task in your job description.  management, your staff obviously needs better training.  Otherwise, the food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Mushroom and fontina pizza and the pasta bolognese were my favorites.one more thing- lots of screaming kids.
2012-11-20,4,Had dinner here with 3 people last night. Service was great. We chose this place because it was BYOB.I had the rigatoni in white wine with broccoli rabe and sausage. It was amazing.We also had the bruschetta; it was interesting. It is $3 each so we tried each. They weren't bad, just not traditional bruschetta.We were there for 2 hours until closing and we weren't rushed. I will definitely be going back!
2012-11-19,4,Ate dinner here tonight with two friends.  Service was very good.  Not sure if our server was the owner but he very well could have been. We shared a caesar salad, a square pie with mushrooms on half, and tried one bruschetta slice.  I loved the caesar salad!  After finishing her third, one of my friends was like, "ew.. does this have anchovy in it?" as she noticed some specks of it on her plate.  I was like yeah! that's the way caesar dressing is supposed to be, what gives it its flavor!!The bruschetta was interesting.. They're $3 each and you get one big slice of bread with toppings. We tried the one with ricotta and tomato. I liked the bread and ricotta and basil, but the huge bite of cherry tomato didn't seem to blend well. Would be better diced I think. The pizza was good.  You could tell it was fresh, especially the basil.  I don't eat mushrooms but my two friends thought the mushrooms they used were unusual.  I really liked the crust.  The sauce was ok.  It had a little bit too much sauce for my taste.  The disappointment was the cheese.  As Rebecca stated below me somewhere, you couldn't at all tell if that it was "fresh" mozzerella, which it supposedly was.   Anyway, I'd come back.
2012-11-04,4,When I feel like splurging on pizza this is where I go. Definitely a little pricy for such a small pie, but you can absolutely taste that they use quality ingredients. The app portions seem to be a little bigger if you eat in rather than get delivery, but the place is adorable and the staff is super friendly plus it's BYOB- so pop in. I'm kinda hard to please so its impressive for me to say that everything I've ever ordered has been fresh and delicious... tho personally, I like the round pie better than the square.
2012-09-13,5,What is better than a nice Italian/pizza BYOB restaurant with outdoor seating? On top of that, the food is great and there are lots of interesting dishes. I cannot help but get the eggplant pizza every time I go! So satisfying with a bottle of red wine!! JP is a great date night spot in Hoboken!
2012-09-10,4,Great place for pizza.  I haven't tried their regular stuff, and I admit, I am not a fan of the whole cutesy pizza revolution or Top Chef inspired culinary creations.  I'd like pizza, regular, deep dish, Sicilian.  throw on some pepperoni.  I don't know what deconstructing a dish means, nor do I have the inclination to find out.That said, the pizza is kind of like a solid workhorse running back.  You may not be totally amazed (although it is up there), but it's going to be dependable and get the job done.  You aren't going to take it in the first couple rounds of your fantasy draft, but a mid round pick up for a flex player is a great play.I always eat it and I rank it as very good to excellent.So it's not quite Grimaldis, but given the fact that most pizza in Hoboken is rather disappointing (excluding: Grimaldis, Giovanni's, Uptown for Sicilian, which has actually gone downhill since its glory of 2004-2005, Rosalia's, Bennys-ehh, many times it's too doughy, Napolis-delivery is very hit or miss with them, but it can be excellent) it's a fun place to go and sit either inside or outside. Also, it's very cheap which always brightens my day.  The only negative:  While I am by no means a grumpy old man (OK, that can probably be disputed), there can be tons of children here.  Which, in and of itself, is not a big deal.  But for some reason I haven't quite figured out yet, children run rampantly here - though the restaurant, the outdoors area, hanging out the windows...Maybe it's something in the pizza here, or too much sugar in the soda perhaps?  I guess when there are alot of children, parents that are self absorbed do not feel the obligation to ensure the behavior of their respective offspring, and the place takes on an atmosphere much like Gymboree, chuck e cheese, nursery school etc.So factoring in the children,  and the fact that its a pizzeria, it's not a place to try and impress that special someone you are courting, but an awesome place to bring some wine and have some pizza.
2012-09-05,3,Have only had the pizza here, but loved it because it was BYOB and had outdoor seating.Staff was friendly and attentive.  Got the sausage and broccoli rabe pizza to share, as well as bruschetta.  Both were average.  Not impressed at all with bruschetta and the pizza had WAY too many red pepper flakes on it which made it almost unpleasant to eat.  If I went back I'd def skip the bruschetta, and try a different kind of pizza.... or maybe skip the pizza all together and go for a pasta dish or something.Prices are great though.
2012-08-16,1,Underwhelmed.  Ok, so we all discount the highs and lows when we read reviews; I know I do.  I live in Hoboken and heard great things about the new spot in the old Ted & Joe's.  App was clams oregonsto - nothing special with clams the size of somewhere between dimes and nickels, for $12.  Had to search for the clam.  Dinner was the clam pizza, which had have muzz on top.  While the place was pretty empty, pie came to the table cold with crust watery/ wet - not crusty.  Table next to us waited so long for staff they had to go inside to pay.Simply not worth it.  If you want clam pie, go to Frannies on Flatbush in Brooklyn.  Otherwise, other great spots in Hoboken, even w BYOB the Dining Room w David Piña, on 10th street in Hoboken.
2012-08-12,3,Would definitely ranked it four stars if it weren't for the manager and chef. Wait staff and hostess are always exceptional. Food is great but the chef's unwillingness to make accommodations is a little annoying. Chef acts like its fine dining and he can't make simple accommodations like leaving one slice plain for a child. The manager also supports this attitude from the chef and he walks around giving attitude to anyone who ask for a little favor. If it wasn't for the exceptional wait staff the place could really turn people off. They are so attentive to the customer and always so friendly. The manager needs to know a good portion of its clientele is families with young children, and sometimes a little help goes a long way. He should look at the rest of his staff to learn how to act. I make sure the keep my children in line not to disturb other customers, maybe they could bend a little to make the experience better.
2012-08-09,4,Nice take on the clam pie - not a ton of clams, but a spicy, flavorful sauce.
2012-08-05,1,OMG what has happened to this place?  Was so excited when it first opened...kid friendly.. BYOB...good food...right around the corner from my house.  But something has gone terribly wrong.  Went on a Sunday evening, service couldn't have been more awful, seems they are specializing in take-out now  and don't have a liquor license so the waiters have no interest in serving the seated customers.  There were more servers than customers yet we couldn't get water, bread, drinks, nothing.  And to top it all off, our waiter, who was perhaps the worst waiter ever, put a piping hot pizza on a skimpy frame on our table which immediately slid off the frame onto the floor, burning my fingers as I tried to catch it before it hit the ground.  Seriously?  No "I'm sorry" or "are you ok."  Nothing.  Have a big blister on my right index finger to prove it!  Thankfully they brought us another pizza which we ate quickly and left, leaving the waiter a 10% tip which, I think, I've never done in my life.  I give this place 6 months.
2012-08-02,4,This place is great, not only is it BYOB but the food is great also...Had the pizza here before, the square pie is big and it's quite thick (not entirely to my taste) but it was good none the less. The real star of this place IMO is the spaghetti meatballs.....
2012-06-27,5,Just checked this place out for the first time and it was so delicious! Most definitely one of the best pizzas I've had in Hoboken and could probably say the best in Hoboken. Great service and atmosphere. Ladies room was one of the most cleanest and nicest restaurant bathrooms I've seen. Absolutely going back again. Great job Johnny Pepperoni!!
2012-06-12,3,This is almost four stars for me.I feel like any place that has BYOB should get an extra star.  The clam pizza was excellent (had a little kick to it), the sausage and broccoli rabe was good (sausage was plentiful, the brocolli didn't add much), and the anti-pasta was OK (not presented in a way that I'm used to, with less vegetables).  The place is a little too kid-friendly for my tastes (I just want to get my pizza and drink on) and the waitress tried to hurry us out of there at the end (9:45p on a Friday night...).  But I'll be back.
2012-06-11,5,We love this place. We've been a few times to the actual restaurant and ordered pizza for delivery a few times as well. Yes, it's kid friendly as some reviewers have noted, but the food is so good it is a non-factor for us. Each time we've been in the restaurant the pasta we have ordered has come out steaming hot and perfectly cooked. While I would like to see homemade pasta instead of boxed, the meats and veggies they use are excellent and the dishes have been delicious. The sauces are flavorful and the vegetables are still crisp. Each time we've gone The food has been outstanding.Service - It can be a bit spotty. We've had some good some fair, but never horrible service. Pizza - I love the pizza. It has always come to the house hot and the ingredients they use are top notch. The roasted mushrooms are amazing. For a BYO it is kind of pricy but I have to say that given the quality of the food I will happily pay the premium.
2012-06-09,3,Just don't get the hype- my boyfriend and his friends love the pizza - I found it ok.  I came here twice.  Once for the opening and another for a Friday night with my girlfriends.  I don't love dining with kids so if you go before 8 - except to find a lot since very kid friendly.  I like Margheritas and Cafe Michelana much better.
2012-05-19,4,Excellent pizza and phenomenal service! Thin crust is yum. Also impressed with the Caesar salad, which tastes like it has homemade dressing as opposed to many places that use bland bottled dressing.
2012-05-11,4,We've been here twice now and each time has been great. It is BYOB which is always fantastic and it's a nice small place. The service has always been fantastic. The first time we went we had to wait for a table, so the hostess offered to open our wine for us, gave us some bread and sat us at a little bar in the back to wait. I think that was going above and beyond so we didn't have to stand and wait around.The food is great, the first time I went I got the spaghetti and meatballs which was fantastic the meatballs weren't dry and had plenty of flavor like my Nonna used to make, the sauce was equally as good. This second time we went back I got this Mac and Cheese type dish which was phenomenal!!! My fiance got the pesto shrimp, she liked it but the texture of it bothered her so she didn't eat a whole lot of it. I don't advise going around 6:30-7 because this is when the soccer moms come out with all their kids. We were sat next to a family of 6 the kids were all over the place, running into me and the table and the parents did or said nothing, but that's bad parenting not bad service on part of the restaurant. But there seemed to be a ton of kids in there at that time. But, if you are a parent and your kid is running into tables, my advice would be tell your kid to stop, at that point they aren't cute, they're annoying...ok off soapbox.My only wish is that they had picked a better name. It just sounds so much like an Italian Chucky Cheese. But that aside this place is excellent.
2012-05-08,4,Johnny Pepperoni is located in what used to be Ted & Joe's in uptown Hoboken.  The bar remains (converted to a counter for food/coffee) but there is no alcohol, so bring your own beer/wine.  I consider this more of a pizza restaurant. When I think pepperoni, I think pizza, everyone at tables near us had pizza so, of course, we tried the pizza.They make excellent pizza here. We ordered ours topped with ($2-3 per topping) arugula, sausage, cherry peppers, and olives. Crust was delicious. Topping was delicious.  Only thing was we expected black olives and really couldn't see any, waiter said they use kalamata? instead.  Think I'll pass on the olives next time. Anyway, a delicious pizza, cooked perfect, my compliments. Nice waiter, nice hostess, and I appreciate that. We didn't order dessert, too full.They have some Italian dishes on the menu that you'd typically find in an Italian restaurant. They have a few inexpensive options for kids. There are outdoor tables for the good weather days.  So if you're just in it for the pizza, I'd say this is a better pie than Grimaldi's.  Will try some entrees/aps in the future.
2012-05-02,3,This was my second trip to Johnny's after stoppinng by in the first few weeks they were open, I felt like I needed to give them a second try. I wish I could give 3.5 stars.We sat at the bar because the rest of the dining area was packed with loud families and kids.  One of my issues is that the kids are always running around in here (which isn't something I can contribute to the restaurant).  The floors are tiled and there isn't much of the walls to deaden the sound so the room can get very loud at times.  I'm going to have to try sitting outside when it gets consitantly warmer out.I've sat at the bar both times when I've been here so I can't speak for the rest of the dining room but the service has been good. Water glass is always full and the guy behind the "bar" was chatty enough to seem welcoming.Started by splitting the fritto misto.  It was decent enough, I love calamari and fennel so I couldn't help myself.  The portion size was a little small for the price.  Wanting to try things from all over the menu we also split a ceasar salad which was good.  Ordered the mushroom & fontina pizza as the main to split.  In my opinion there weren't enough mushrooms on the pizza but the taste was there with the fontina, garlic and thyme. The crust was cooked well.Like others have said, BYOB helps keep the cost down at Johnny Pepperoni's which helps. The next time I go I'll try to go later so the families are tucked in at home for the evening and get a table outside. Trying one of their pasta's is also on the to-do list.
2012-04-22,4,Went here on a Saturday night for dinner and it was pretty good! Showed up and were seated right away. We sat outside at first, but then decided it was too cold. The hostess moved us without any problems and was very nice and friendly about it. Much appreciated!The food was good! We started with the ricotta, tomato and basil bruschetta, which was okay. The tomatoes were not only sliced in half, not diced as expected, but the garlic bread was nice and crunchy and the ricotta was fresh.We ordered the prosciutto and arugula pizza, along with the rigatoni (with sausage and broccoli rabe) to split. The crust on the pizza was thin and crispy. They were generous with the prosciutto and arugula, which is always nice. Pizza was a bit greasy, but still very good.The rigatoni was very good. Nicely cooked and the chili flakes added a good touch of heat.I would definitely go back to this place. It was pretty good and the staff was very friendly and accommodating. I didn't know it was BYOB at the time, but now I know and will definitely take advantage of this next time!
2012-04-20,4,Service was excellent & the food was fantastic. It's BYOB so that brings the cost down a lot. Will definitely eat there again.
2012-04-17,5,I just LOVE this new place, I can't believe I just discovered it.  The first time my boyfriend and I tried it we both had pasta dishes that were amazing.  I raved about how nice the staff was and how good my dinner was the entire walk.  I'll definitely be back for casual date nights.
2012-04-10,3,I've actually never tried the pizza here, but I've been a few times for the pasta, and have always had a really good meal. For starters, they have a variety of bruschetta, all of which are good, but if you're only going to order one kind, go with the eggplant. I love to cook at home, and have been trying to figure out how to make it myself... with no luck. It's a really unique dish, and one that I always order. I love shrimp with my pasta, but the only option that they have is served with pesto. So, I like to order that dish, but have them add marinara sauce...they've always been really good about making the switch. Their meatballs are also pretty decent. I do have to agree with some of the commenters about the kids... I love them, but sometimes they can get a little crazy here!
2012-04-06,4,I'm a big thin crust fan, so I tend to eat my pizza at Fillipo's on First and Grimaldi's. However, the square pie at Johnny Pepperoni is outstanding.  Very fresh ingredients and the prices are more than reasonable. Also, the hostesses are very nice and accommodating.  They always go out of their way to make us feel welcome.  The service is well above average.
2012-03-18,3,I have a feeling most people think of this as a pizza place, but the pastas are better in my opinion. The spaghetti and meatballs are my favorite. And the penne (?) with white wine and sausage is a close second.  The "gourmet" pizzas aren't great. They're heavy handed with the truffle oil, and it makes the too rich. The regular pizzas are good though. All in all great food. Plus it's byob. A few minor criticisms though. One, they've apparently developed a niche as a family friendly place, which is fine, but there's always little brats screaming their heads off. We come as late as we can for dinner and almost never for lunch anymore. Which leads me to two, they used to have a lunch/brunch menu, and it was very good. They had hot subs and a great egg and Italian sausage dish. But they no longer use that menu at lunch and now just use the dinner menu with dinner prices. Fine if you're just getting pizza but it's a little pricey if you want something else (around $20 for the pastas). One other little quirk - notice the big sign painted on the side of the building says "since 2010." We live a few blocks away and walk past a couple times a week. That sign was painted in 2011, months before before they actually opened. WTF?
2012-03-14,4,One of the best in Hoboken. Pies are a little small but very taste.
2012-03-06,3,Disclaimer: My review is for pizza and pizza alone (I've had three different kinds from  here on two different occasions). Further, I've only taken the takeout route (so service cannot be properly assessed).It took me a few months to finally get around to trying this place (which is pretty pathetic because I probably live about 50 walking paces away and am no stranger to takeout/delivery establishments), but all in all not bad. However, I don't think I agree with the 4/5 ratings here (seem awfully inflated). For one, the "fresh" mozzarella on the pies is shredded and isn't at all reflective of the globs of yummy mutz found elsewhere in Hoboken. Doesn't taste especially great either. The crust is thin, which is a plus, but the tomato sauce doesn't seem that remarkable.The pepperoni definitely isn't as good as that at Napoli or Grimaldi's. The sausage seems to be about on par. Overall execution, however, definitely ranks below both.Props for the idea for the arugula and prosciutto pizza...they do not skimp on either of these ingredients. However, one weird thing to note about the prosciutto: it seemed almost fatty, which was weird. I've never been served fatty prosciutto...I never thought salted meat could be made unappetizing to me. All in all probably more like 3.5 stars...sorry kids...rounding down to be like that professor who is anti-grade inflation.
2012-03-06,4,You would think that a town like Hoboken would be overflowing with great pizzerias, right? Unfortunately, most I've experienced here are disappointing. Johnny Pep's stands out as one of the best in town. And as of recently, they're delivering! Downside - no slices, a bit pricey, and they're not very flexible about altering the toppings from how they're listed on the menu. That being said, they definitely put some TLC into their pies. The sauce is excellent, cheese is always fresh, and they have some great pie options to choose from. White pizza w/ brocolli rabe is outstanding.Bonus - It's BYOB. I also love the decor in the restaurant, it really gives the place a classic and homey feel. Great for a casual night out.
2012-03-05,5,One of the best and most unique BYO's in Hoboken. Delicious brick oven style pizza and pasta dishes that get better with every glass of wine! I definitely recommend this restaurant, but be ready to wait up to an hour for a table Friday-Sunday.
2012-03-05,3,A mixed bag, if you order right, you'll be happy.Have only been once, so I tried to order a few different things.Cesar salad was bland and borderline terrible.spaghetti and meatballs (a difficult order to be sure) was serviceable, pasta was cooked right, meatballs weren't bad... sauce was little runny.... not bad though.The pizza was quite good, not the best in town but a must try!  I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but if you find yourself in the neighborhood, not bad at all.  I'll give it another try down the line and update this review.byob, prices are a little on the expensive side, but in the normal range.
2012-02-29,2,I'm sorry, but is there somehing I'm not seeing? I can usually agree with the majority, but not here. The pizza sauce tasted like crushed up sweettarts. Way too tangy. Not the worst I've ever had, but definitely overrated. Plus the hours suck. What kind of pizzeria is closed during lunch?!
2012-02-29,5,Simply AMAZING!!! By far one of the best places to eat in Hoboken. From the quick, friendly service, fantastic food, to the fun-filled atmosphere and decor, this place has us coming back weekly. Especially can't wait for the outdoor patio to open!!! A great family, date night, or girls night out spot. Everyone needs to check it out... Absolutely love it!
2012-02-10,4,Been here a few times and the pizza is definitely some of the best in Hoboken.  They've done a great job with the whole place.
2012-02-03,4,What's in a name?  Not much, I guess.  Because I was expecting something much less when I first heard of this new joint with the stupid name, but was pleasantly surprised.There's certainly no lack of Italian places in the mile square, but most are mediocre at best.  JP's does a good job at standing out, however:  well prepared, fresh food, a few unique items on the menu, a great open space, a bustling atmosphere and an open kitchen, together makes this a great new addition.I haven't tried the pizza yet, but the pasta is very well done.  The traditional spaghetti and meatballs was excellent, as we their Sicilian Baked pasta and cheese (sort of an interesting take on mac+cheese).  The baked clams oreganato were tasty and even their simple radicchio salad was spruced up just enough to make it interesting (enough for two to share, btw).To top it off, it's BYOB and Sasso's liquors is right on the opposite block.  What more could you ask for.  Once the weather gets nice, the outside seating space will liven this quiet block up.
2012-02-02,1,SHENANIGANS!!!! Are you all crazy?? I've never written a review... But I just finished eating and couldn't get on here fast enough. My girlfriend and I read the reviews and ordered the prosciutto arrugala pizza delivery. It came to $24 with tip and was only 6 small slices. That's $4 a slice! I didn't care for the mound of arugula on top but when I took it off, the plain slice underneath was good....not worth it.  I'm sticking with BASILES!!
2012-01-29,4,This place is fantastic. When you walk in you see the hostess table to your right and the open kitchen right in front of you. I love open kitchens in restaurants. Its a very inviting way to tell the customer "Hey, our food is fresh. Watch us make it!" it also puts me at ease because I know the kitchen is spotless. The restaurant was definitely tiny (I wish it weren't so small). The downside is that it was definitely noisy. But that really is the ONLY downside to this place.    My wife and I ate there last night. We shared a Caesar saiad and a thin crust pizza with spicy sausage and arugula. There were no seats but we had the option of eating at the bar so we took it right away. Our experience from start to finish was authentic Italian. Even our server was from Italy. Despite it being so busy, he was attentive and knowledgeable. He poured us each a glass of wine (BYOB) and brought bread right away.    Now for the food. The Caesar dressing was homemade. You could tell right away because you could see and taste flecks of anchovy. The lettuce was super crisp and it was not drenched in dressing. The pizza was out of this world. Not over-sauced, or over-cheesed (although its hard to even imagine such a thing could be negative), this pizza had the perfect balance of topping to crust ratio. The crust was chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.   For dessert, we ordered the zeppole's to go . They were super airy and flavorful. It did not need to be drenched in powdered sugar to taste good. Even the cappucinos were great. Our server made them more delicate care than I have seen in a long time. Now for my favorite part. The owner, John was amazing. Despite it being busy, he took time out to check in with his customers. He offered to buy me and my wife dessert. Even though we declined, he asked us questions about what we thought. I definitely appreciated that he not only wanted feedback but that he took the time to get to know the people who give him business. I am very excited to see this place grow in all sorts of ways. Good job, John!
2012-01-08,5,I have been living in Hoboken for over 7 years and my wife and I love to dine out. This is definitely one of our favorite restaurants in town now and will be back often. Food is excellent and has that "homemade" feel to it. Some of the best meatballs I have had. John, the owner, is around all the time and is very friendly, something that seems to be more of a rarity these days in the restaurant business but I appreciate as a patron.
2012-01-05,5,This is right around the corner from me.  My girlfriend and I tried it out one night, and have been going back since.It's BYOB, which is great, since we can bring a good bottle of whine, or some beers.  Everything is incredibly fresh, and the pizza is beyond what you would normally consider good pizza.In the spring summer, it's really nice because you can sit outside.  Get there early because there has been a line since it's opened...
2011-12-24,5,This was by far the best pizza and Italian food that I've had in the 'boken.A great test for any Italian joint is to try the simple foods- We had delivery:  spaghetti/meatballs and a pizza.  Both of these foods were top notch- best pizza I've had out here bar none (this pizza was better than Grimaldi's and Napoli's)PS The pizza was still great heating it up 2 days later- that's commendable!We now live in Chicago and my god, I miss the food there!
2011-12-22,5,I thought it was awesome that they let you choose the tops for the pizza! The waiters are nice, the nutella pizza dessert is incredible, and the service is awesome!
2011-12-13,4,I feel very lucky that Johnny Pepperoni is my neighborhood pizza/Italian place. After living in Denver forever I just can't get over how great most pizza and Italian food is in Hoboken, and Johnny Pepperoni is my favorite so far. I had never experienced the BYOB thing before but it is so cool. I don't drink so I always feel bad when I go to a restaurant and know I am going to be spending and tipping less than most other people since I don't drink. But at a BYO place who cares! Not only do they not serve booze, but they have the special old-school Cokes in bottles which my boyfriend loves. So he was happy too.The setting is super cute and I found it warm and inviting in a fairly upscale way. They have a great bar where we sat, which I liked because we were kind of up and away from all the other tables so we could have a nice quiet chat. I had a radicchio salad which was phenomenal. And huge. It cost like $9 which is a lot for a salad but it really was a decent value considering its enormous size. I had to stop myself from finishing it because I wanted to save room for pizza. But it was great. Now the pizza, holy crap. It was delicious. We had a square pie with cheese so it was very simple but it was awesome The crust was so good. I have found crust is definitely what separates New York/New Jersey pizza from other pizza that just can't measure up. It is like a good bagel I suppose - crispy on the outside and perfectly chewy on the inside. It makes me feel sad that I wasted my time and calories eating pizza in Denver for all those years.The only reason I'm not giving Johnny Pepperoni five stars is that the service was on the spacey side. I would just have liked her to check in a little more often. But everyone was super friendly so it was really just a timing thing. I will be back soon to hopefully update to five stars!!
2011-11-28,2,I am not one to write reviews but my experiences with Johnny Pepperoni's have been so outstanding I had to get the word out. The minute the restaurant opened I was intrigued and pleasantly surprised that Hoboken has finally been blessed with a really good pizza place. I had worked in a pizzeria/Italian restaurant for 10 years and being Italian myself, I really have high standards. Johnny Pepperoni's food is definitely worth the visit. I've tried just about everything on the menu and it is all excellent. The pizza is perfection and I never thought I'd actually like a meatball outside my family's recipe until I tried theirs. However, it's not just the food that makes this place amazing, but the service as well. Being one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in Hoboken, I decided to get a few friends together there for my birthday back in September. There were 12 of us and despite my boyfriends many attempts to hold a table (they don't take reservations) we had to wait about an hour for a table to open up and didn't wind up sitting down until about 10PM. The owner graciously provided us with 2 plates of the antipasta platter while we waited. Once seated, they accommodated us completely, even waiving the plate fee for my cake. They made my birthday dinner exactly how I wanted it: easy and yummy. Then, this past holiday weekend, I decided to order from them on Wednesday evening, Thanksgiving eve. The girl on the phone took my order for "Baked Ziti" and said about 30-40 minutes for delivery. Over an hour later I had no Baked Ziti so I called and she placed me on the phone with the owner. He informed me he was calling the driver and to call him back if I didn't receive my order in 10 minutes. About 5 minutes later, the delivery guy was there but with something other than baked ziti. Hungry and a bit cranky, I called back, and the girl again placed me on the phone with the owner. He explained that they replaced the "baked ziti" on their older menu with whatever it is that arrived at my door. He must have heard the disappointment in my voice and told me he would make me whatever else I'd like and personally deliver it. So, I opted for the Eggplant Parm and within 15 minutes the delivery guy was at my door. A few moments later, the owner called me, asking if I received my order, how I liked it, and thanked ME for being patient and understanding. This by FAR is the BEST customer service I have received in all my dining experiences in Hoboken. For other restaurant owners out there, take a lesson from this guy. He exemplified what is it to be a truly successful restaurant by making sure the experience as a whole was enjoyable. 2 Thumbs up, 5 stars, simply amazing!
2011-11-22,4,The pizza here is delicious. We tried the prosciutto and arugula one. Unlike most "arugula" pizzas that bake the arugula, this was baked without it and then topped with a lightly dressed bunch of baby arugula, adding a nice fresh crunch to the warm pizza. It's BYOB, which is great. The little glasses they bring out for your wine are adorable. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the prices are pretty steep. Appetizers looked great, but $14 for fritto misto is a lot when the pies are nearing $20/piece. Place was pretty packed on a Monday night so I can imagine it's tough to get a table on the weekends.
2011-11-11,3,I have had the thin crust and the thick, both are good but i prefer their thin.  They have plenty of outdoor seating and it is a  BYOB.  My only complaint would be that the waiter pushed our cork into the bottle, oh well, nothing bad on the food though.  Try the clam and basil pie it was delish.  Also, if you are into sweet, and I mean sugar coma sweetness, the Nutella pie is interesting.
2011-11-04,5,Love this place.   We always get salad and pizza.  I would like to try some other entrees, but the pizza's so yummy I haven't yet.  The roasted mushrooms are really delicious.  It has a cozy atmosphere, and even though I'm not a fan of TVs in restaurants, they're up high enough and without volume that they don't bother me.  They play good music and the staff is very sweet and helpful.  Also, it's very family friendly- which we appreciate having a 2 year old.
2011-10-05,4,I felt like I was cheating on the chillest resto/bar in Hoboken (RIP, Ted & Jo's) when I came in here for a couple of slices.I have to give it to the owners, the set up is dope and the pizza (regular slices) was deelish.I will never forget Ted & Jo's (best brunch + sunday fundays) but at least the new tenants are doing it correctly with the quality of their product.
2011-09-24,5,This place is GREAT!!  Try the meatballs, pasta with clam sauce (honestly - better than any I have had in Florence, Rome, or Venice), stuffed clams, eggplant, and pizza - all great!  Have been there at least a dozen times with the family. Very kid friendly.  Reasonably priced.  Gina is terrific - she makes everyone feel at home; kids love her; she is a sweetheart!  What a great addition to the neighborhood and Hoboken.
2011-09-08,4,I watched this place slowly take form over the span of a few months during my visits to Hoboken, so I was intrigued to try it when it first opened.  There are quite a few Italian places in the area, but this one is definitely worth talking about.The atmosphere is really cool - its on the corner of Park and 11th so you have a lot of windows to look out and a lot of people watching to do.  Indoors or out, seating has a view.Food - one word.  MEATBALLS.  Whatever they are made of...make them rival my mom's homemade meatballs.  And that is saying a lot.Other highlights:-Radicchio Salad - A+-Thing Crust Pizza - We killed all but 2 slices while we were there - and the remaining two warmed up quite nicely the following day.-BYOB [as im sure many of the other reviews indicate]I'm fairly new to the area - and its nice to know I don't have to walk up to Washington St. to get a good meal.
2011-09-03,5,This place is fantastic!!!!!!  I love the ambiance, service, and the pizza.  I'm so happy that we finally have a top-notch pizzeria in Hoboken.  The thin pie with arugula and prosciutto is to die for.  The square pie is superb as well.  But the icing on the cake is by far the Nutella pizza.  I've tried several Nutella pizzas in the city, but J.Pepperoni spanks them all.  I just hope these folks don't let the great reviews get to their head and suddenly compromise their standards for service and quality as several places in Hoboken tend to do.  Please keep doing what you're doing and we will keep coming here.  BYOB is a plus too.  Love this place.
2011-09-01,4,I'm a pizza freak so I like most variations. I go to Benny's when I want great Hoboken pizza and I love Johnny Pepperoni when I want something different. The pizza is fresh, ingredients hit you the way they should in every bitr and the service is outstanding. I wanted to hate the place because I really liked Ted and Joe's, but this is a really cool place.  The only thing I would change is that I would like to see the menu expanded a bit on the appy side. Otherwise, I'm hooked!
2011-08-24,3,I also have to disagree with most of the reviews.  I must admit I had high expectations after reading the reviews and walking by an always packed restaurant, but everything we had turned out to be average or below average.  Would like to give 2.5 STARS, so I rounded up.We started with the fritto misto, which was so so.  Not enough calamari and way too much onion.  For my entree I had the eggplant parm, which did not have nearly enough cheese and was extremely oily--very disappointing.  My boyfriend's entree, the bucatini and meatballs, was the best thing we had--but even that was average.  Their sodas are those tiny little coke bottles, which are cute and go with the old school theme, but are not nearly enough and so you end up needing more than one each.  Our waitress was not great but she was clearly new so I don't fault them for that since I've been a new waitress before too.On our way out, the hostess handed us a take out menu.  We immediately threw it out. (cue dramatic music)In summary, Johnny Pepperoni is basically attempting but falling short at doing what a place like Leo's already does well and more authentically. And JP's is more expensive.  Go to Leo's for a much better simple Italian meal.
2011-08-19,4,Like many others, was a big fan Ted & Joe's ( even worked there in the summer of... uff long ago) . We arrived full of expectations since the majority of all reviews are positive,...and Johnny did not disappoint us.  Cutting to the chase; With Greetings from the hosts we were quickly seated. Staff is really nice and friendly, within 15 minutes we were already having appetizer ( thursday night, the place was packed!!! )with our wine ( BYOB , we ordered the bruschetta)  which btw tasted really good. As we saw the app vanish, our pizza landed on us.( order a thin crust spicy sausage, broccoli, garlic, onion and half plain) . So , to my taste , this is for now the best pizza in town, its crispy with fresh ingredients and very thin, not to mention that this place has a great vibe - try to go while it is still hot out and sit outside (dont forget to bring your wine/beer). the reason for only for stars.... The food is good, however, i felt that the menu could provide us a little more options,at least 2 or 3 more varieties of specialty pizzas -  but thats just me being picky..Def. coming back for more, and so should you .. Great place.. great ambiance
2011-07-24,4,First time checking this place out and I'm a huge fan. I love thin crust pizza coupled with BYO - can't beat it. The broccoli and sausage thin crust pizza was perfect. Also the clams oreganato were full of flavor - not too big, but just enough. The staff was also very accomodating. I will certainly be back and continue to bring friends with me.
2011-07-23,5,Service and food was very good.  Very kid friendly.  Was a very hot day and we would  have enjoyed our dinner more if restaurant were cooler.The opportunity was there to show first time visitors that  this was a fine place on a hot summer day.  Plenty of very attractive room outside. We will be back soon and had a good time.
2011-07-19,5,This place is excellent.  I was a big fan of Ted & Joes so I had my reservations about this place coming into my favorite neighborhood spot.  Boy was I wrong!  Food is excellent as is the service.  This is the best Pizza in Hoboken.  I have not had the square pie but the round pie is great!  The ingredients taste fresh.  Servers are constantly filling your water glass.  The interior and exterior of the restaurant are extremely inviting and compliment the neighborhood.The name had me scared but I'm glad we tried it out.  I've eaten there 5 times already!  Also, the prices are beyond reasonable!  Do not miss out on this place!
2011-07-11,4,Johnny Peperoni is in the space formerly occupied by Ted & Jo's, a very popular neighborhood Irish bar/restaurant the locals have missed for over 3 years now. I've already eaten here 3 times(outside on the well designed and comfortable patio) and I have to tell you the food is exceptional and the service is really good.  I haven't had the deep dish yet, but the thin crust is fantastic. I've also had the meatball sandwich and 2 apps that were very tasty. The prices are very reasonablefor the quality of the food. The ingredients are fresh and the pies and dishes are well prepared. You can get out of there with a tab of $46 bucks(for two people) feeling like you had a meal fit for a king(or queen).This place is a welcome addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene, and a fine replacement for a beloved yet departed old haunt of mine.
2011-07-10,3,visited JP for the first time last night.  I agree that the service is almost overattentive.  within seconds of finishing anything.... the plate, glass or cutlery was whisked off of the table....so fast that it was disconcerting.  The food was good but it ws rather expensive!!  For one pasta, one plain pizza, one small salad and a few desserts it was $80.00 (no drinks!).  was actually looking on line for their menu to see if I was overcharged!!  food was good though.....just not an affordable neighborhood place to bring kids more frequently....with $24 entrees it is more of an occassional splurge.
2011-07-08,2,Went here last night and have to disagree with most of the other reviewers. The calamari was over fried and had barely any calamari in it--ours had so much fried red onion it totally overpowered everything else. The baked ziti didn't have enough sauce and was very bland. For a place like this I really think they should serve better quality pasta, maybe even homemade. Not boxed pasta. The mushroom and fontina pizza was good although we asked for it to be well done and it was far from that and very salty. When our food came out I asked for fresh grated parmesan and they pointed at the fake stuff that is served at every other pizza place in Hoboken. I told our waitress I would really like fresh like the kind that comes on the salad. He said "sure" and came back with the fake stuff again, but this time in a bowl. As for the restaurant decor, it's cute but soft of weird with all the TVs. Two of the TVs had sponge bob on--sort of made us feel out of place. They also had WAY to many people working there. It was 2 servers to every table--in my opinion that's somewhat annoying bc they are constantly standing by your table. I really wanted to like this place bc the menu looked so good, but unfortunately we will not be returning until they make some changes. This place is definitely more of a family place, not a date place.  And lastly I do think they are a bit over-priced for a pizza place.  We will be sticking with Grimaldi's or Napoli's.
2011-07-05,5,Great food! The thin crust is my fav. They serve nutella pizza! The staff is great and is kid friendly!
2011-06-30,4,I live right down the street from this new Italian restaurant, and all and all, it was a pretty enjoyable experience. The food was great, but like with a lot of new restaurants, kinks still need to be worked out. I was served my appetizer right when the food came (I think the waitress forgot about us) and when the doors are closed, the main dining room can get relatively loud to the point where you can't hold a conversation with someone across from you without other people listening in.The staff is very accommodating and friendly - food extremely tasty and well-priced for the area.I will definitely go back and try other items on their menu - and soon, take out will be available too (major plus!).
2011-06-22,4,Hoboken resident, always willing to try a new restaurant because the other 20 places get repetitive after a while.  Saw that it opened on a blog and figured my girlfriend and I would go there on a weeknight to check it out.  We walked in, a little commotion because of a 10 year old girl softball party, but a nice ambience.  We started with the rice balls which were delicious, only came with 2 but pretty filling.  BYO is really nice too so you don't have to pay 8 dollars for a glass of wine or 5 for a beer.  We finally got to the pizza and it was delicious.  Very crunchy, awsome sauce and cheese was portioned perfectly.  I got the square pizza that was way too much for us 2, but good for 3 or 4 people.  8 slices, almost sicilian like.  Definitely looking forward to going back and trying the other things on the menu.  The owner was very friendly, came up to us and was very attentive, along with the rest of the wait staff.  Recommended the eggplant parm entree, unfortunately it was after we ordered.Will be back and recommend to anyone.
2011-06-19,5,Very friendly staff. Food is excellent and authentic without breaking the bank. The Bucatini and Veal Meatballs are a must and save room for the Nutella pizza pie for dessert. Will definitely have to make another visit.
2011-06-11,5,Wow - we just walked in on the soft open of Johnny Pepperoni in Hoboken.  It's located at the corner of Park & 11th - former local of a decent restaurant who's name is lost in the back of my mind. Well on the surface you would think that Hoboken doesn't really need an other Italian eatery????  Johnny Pepperoni actually fills a gap in the Hoboken scene - a place where you can get a awesome pizza but not be at a pizzeria - it's a bit more modern and comfortable than any pizzeria or Italian restaurant in town  and more homey and friendly than Grimaldis ( and actually a better more crisp and generous pizza). Johnny Pepperoni is sort of Lombardi's on Spring St NYC meets Mario Bataldi.  We had the eggplant parm - excellent!! And the spaghetti and meatballs (veal) totally OFF THE HOOK - the sauce was perfect with lots of real tomato and taste and the meatballs the best I ever had.  It's byob and Sasso Deli is steps away.  The staff was super eager and the kitchen staff seemed totally in high gear - if they can keep their enthusiasm and warm attitude they will always be crowded. I sort of wish they had wine and beer - but byob can be a positive thing if you know in advance.  Think I'll stop in next week for a square pizza - looked great!!   Best of luck!!!!!
2011-06-11,4,A great addition to the neighborhood, and BYO nonetheless. I can see having many nice nights here munching on some apps and pies over a bottle of wine.For apps, the onions and fennel in the frito mistro were perfectly salty and hit the spot. The plain thin crust and the prosciutto and arugula pies were both really tasty, and as long as you really like garlic you'll like the pasta (rigatoni maybe, i forget) with sausage and broccoli rabe.
