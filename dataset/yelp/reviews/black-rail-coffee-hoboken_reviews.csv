2021-11-07,5,Really enjoyed this spot for breakfast. We got avocado toast (huge portion and lots of avo), a Turkey sandwich, a bag of Joe's jalapeño chips, a cold brew, and an Ube cookie. Everything was great! Service was wonderful, too. I really enjoyed the vibe inside - all about Biggie and just quaint and cozy. I was full for hours after I finished my toast.
2021-10-30,1,Too many fees for delivery, than you have to add a tip. This owner needs to revamp his service fees. Such a non-sense direction of service.
2021-10-01,5,Black Rail coffee is Hoboken's hidden gem for breakfast or lunch!I work across the street and eat at Black rail 3-4 times a week.  They have an extensive menu and the food is incredible.  Weather you are looking for a healthy salad or a simple snack the Black Rail coffee has it all!  First time recommendation - Maui Wowi, Healthiest Salad, or The Big Tuna with a large Chai Tea!Jim and his staff are extremely personable and the space itself is very cute. -Bob
2021-08-16,5,Great coffee and breakfast sandwiches. The aesthetic inside is great and feels like a place you could spend hours. The staff/owners are always very attentive kind and friendly. Conveniently located next to light rail for an easy stop on a commute. Delivery orders always come very quickly as well
2021-07-28,3,I have been a fan of this coffee shop for a while and loved their food and coffee, however I recently had such a bad experience I  do not know if I will ever be back. I went as usual to get my coffee and some breakfast and was standing in line with my three month old puppy in my arms, by the time I got to the person taking my order I was told dogs were not allowed inside the place to which I responded I was only keeping him with me to order my food and was going to take him out as soon as I ordered and he was too little for me to leave him alone. The person taking my order would not take that as a decent answer so I just told her I was going somewhere else and thanked her. I am still trying to understand that closed mentality and lack of understanding, it is really disappointing.
2021-07-12,5,Healthier sandwich (sooooo delicious, really one of the best sandwiches of my life), comes with popcorners. Love that there's indoor with outlets, and outdoor seating under an awning Very very nice staff.
2021-07-04,5,I had an hour to kill with my pup in the area, and received some of the best service I've ever had! My pup was pretty hyper and anxious and the person working the counter went out of her way to give my pup some bacon AND a huge treat. I know this wasn't a one off for me because of how friendly they they were to others at the cafe. I had an iced latte and avocado toast (cut into corners, so great for sharing) that hit the spot for me.  They had a lot of snack, sandwich, chip options, too.Pro tip: try to eat the avocado toast ASAP/on site, there is a great salsa that might your bread soggy otherwise.
2021-06-25,5,If great selection of sandwiches, coffees and snacks are not enough just the fact that the crew remembered my name after the second visit and no matter how stressed due to the crowd they smile and have few kind words to us deserve a 5 star. Prices are friendly too even after the pandemic hike...
2021-06-13,5,They have been outstanding! I recommend everyone go to Black Rail! It's the best place in Hoboken. No questions asked. Amazing food and the best tasting coffee around.
2021-05-25,1,The hot coffee was Luke warm and waaaay too sweet. I drove to buy a coffee from McDonald's to replace this awful taste in my mouth!  Their avocado toast was burnt and drained in lemon juice. Terrible! Terrible! Do not go there!
2021-05-18,5,Everything I've had from Black Rail has been incredibly good. Amazing sandwiches, coffee, and super friendly owner/employees too.If you're looking for a bomb sandwich and want something different than your run of the mill Hoboken Italian deli for once, look no further. My go to is the Turkey Meets Ham on focaccia.
2021-05-07,5,Really great local coffee shop with great house coffee (I drink it black) and lattes. Staff is simply the best - friendly, cheerful and I feel very lucky they were not a COVID casualty. A real treat for all of us in Hoboken and I always look forward to my daily drop-in.
2021-04-21,1,I like this place but I was served cold/lukewarm cappuccino instead of a flat white I ordered. What makes it worse is that I took a break from work, walked in the rain and waited relatively longer than usual serving time to get this drink.  :( :( I think you owe me a flat white! :|
2021-04-20,5,What a gem in the back of Hoboken. It is almost hidden right next to the train station. It is a funky little place that you can tell does it right. I ordered a tea and some food while doing work.  The sandwich of the month was pretty good. It came with grilled ham and chicken, spinach, pickles with some sort of aoili mayo.  It was pressed and it was beautifully done. It was a little salty but it was a 5 star sandwich. Well done!  I also tried the peanut butter bar that comes packaged by the counter and I loved it. This is a quiet place too with only a few tables so come early to mark your spot! The food here is good and the coffee/tea is done right. What more could you want? 5 star place all the way.
2021-03-17,5,I love this place! The coffee and sandwiches are delicious. Friendly staff as well. I wish I discovered it earlier.
2021-03-03,5,Have been loving the avo toast and lemonade. And then they surprise me with a note in my native language! little things that make difference:)
2021-01-31,5,Awesome little local breakfast and coffee shop. Whenever I need a quick breakfast and an awesome iced mocha coffee, I hit this spot. The biggie wrap is absolutely amazing, reminds me of a Crunchwrap supreme from Taco Bell, but better quality and for breakfast . This place is a must, favorite coffee spot in the area.
2021-01-21,5,Trying to find a delicious and healthy place, I came across on yelp with Black Rail Coffee, I recommend it 100%, the food is super fresh, delicious and for the first time I have a frothy almond cappuccino  (not many places do it right ).I ordered "Fitness Wrap" and my husband ordered "My Turkish Homie" (the latter has a stronger flavor than the former) both had fresh and healthy ingredients.super efficient attention, cozy place. Good atmosphere.I will definitely be back for more. :)
2021-01-16,5,Very impressed with the coffee and food! Avocado toast was amazing and their coffee was really good. Pictured is the avo toast and the mocha coffee. Very clean inside too!
2021-01-08,5,Great spot. Love the ambiance and everyone that helped me were super friendly. I will be coming back. Thanks guys!
2020-12-12,5,Coffee is soooo tasty! Really great source! Food is just right, and these baking mama cookies are sooooo yummy.  I didn't expect such a nice texture and softness to them. The stuff taste great, and it's super convenient on my way to work.  I can't wait to check out the rest of their offerings!
2020-12-10,5,Came into Black Rail Coffee on an extremely cold day and because it was right next to the 9th st lightrail! So convenient! The staff were welcoming once I got inside and it is very nice to see smiling faces before work. I decided to get the hot chocolate with skim milk. I had never tried skim before this and I must say it is delicious. The hot chocolate was not bitter and strong like ones I've had previously. This one was light and chocolatey. The decor is fabulous! There is something to view on every corner and it draws you to stay longer because it's so cozy and cute. I was recommended the chai latte and their sandwiches by a friend so I will definitely be returning for more!
2020-11-11,3,It's very crowded even during COVID so I had high hopes for the sandwiches. Caprese sandwich was good. The bread is crispy and fresh and cheese and tomato are ok. Cheese and tomato looked just not enough. It had balsamic sauce inside, which was appropriate. Just disappointing part was the amount of inner ingredients. Wasa beef was more filling, more veggies, more meat overall. The bread was very flavorful with spices and olive oil.
2020-10-29,5,This place is absolutely Fabulous. I want their coffee served at my wedding. Absolutely delicious  iced coffee. Great food. Great place.
2020-10-20,5,Best sandwiches, coffee, and people! Never fails. Yum. They are awesome people with even better food.  Shop local for your coffee!
2020-09-23,5,I ordered food to be delivered. It arrived on time and was so delicious. I was mostly impressed by how fresh it all tasted
2020-08-22,4,I was impressed with Black Rail. My family and I are used to third wave coffee shops in Southern California, and this would measure up to any of them. I got a cold brew, with some French vanilla and cream and was very happy. The ratio was great. We also ordered a lavender lemonade for my son and ended up tasting that and were impressed with how fresh it all was.The food they were cooking in there was amazing.All of that, paired with its great location nestled in a nicer neighborhood in Jersey, made for a fantastic experience. Kiddos to this place, next time we're out in Jersey we will be visiting again!
2020-08-09,5,Tried Black Rail out for the first time today. Cold brew & bacon egg and cheese sandwich were both great. Staff was awesome. Will be stopping back soon
2020-07-02,5,Wonderful staff, relaxed vibes, reasonable pricing, amazing coffee, stellar sandwich (that rosemary focaccia is as good as it looks!) They have COVID-friendly outdoor seating (4 or 5 tables), which is under the cover of the building's roof so it's also ideal for shade and protection against the rain.  I will definitely be coming back!
2020-06-19,4,I got iced matchas and a cold brew. They all tasted great! I also got the Turkey and Jam sandwich and I really liked the combo. Perfect combination of sweet and savory--would definitely order it again! I like that they have a great selection of different sandwiches because not many coffee places do that. Looking forward to coming back!
2020-06-11,5,Nice place, nice service, good coffee.  Intelligentsia coffee used is really good, my kids like the pastries, especially the muffins.  I did not know this coffee shop existed until I moved into the area a few weeks ago, but am now a regular.
2020-05-23,1,Ordered from here and after waiting for 1 hour and being bounced between the restaurant, Chownow and Doordash, never got the order. Owners of this restaurant need to get their process and vendor choice figured out so they're able to actually retain customers. Terrible experience. Never going back or ordering. Maybe they do deserve to go out of business.
2020-02-27,4,My wife and I came here for coffee and a quick breakfast. I'll start out by saying the coffee is delicious! I had the s'mores latte, which was a special at the time. It had marshmallow and bits of Graham crackers in it. I wasn't a huge fan of my sandwich though. I ordered the Pretentious piggy- a ham sandwich with green apple, swiss, brie, and honey dijon. There was hardly any dijon on the sandwich, which I think really would've rounded out its flavor, and far too much brie with not enough swiss. My wife's sandwich, Turkey meets jam, was AWESOME. It is a turkey sandwich with fig jam and pickled onions on a baguette. I'll be coming back for this sandwich for sure and am looking forward to trying the others!
2020-02-22,4,Probably one of my new go-to quick sandwich/coffee joint. I got the Turkey Meets Jam and it was so. damn. good. The fig jam and bread made it. Loved everything about the sandwich.However, my husband got the Pretentious Piggy (I think was the name) and it was really poorly made. Barely any meat or apple slices, there was supposed to be dijon mustard but he *maybe* gone one bite that he could taste it.It's like they used up all their energy making my sandwich bomb af and when they got to his just said whatever. He tasted mine though, and knowing mine was on point, he's willing to try them out again.
2020-02-08,3,Not the establishment's fault but just a warning...don't come here if you want to relax, read a book, or do work, you know, common activities people do at a coffee place. Was here recently and the place was packed, I mean packed!!!! with little, screaming, crying kids and their entitled parents. I should have gone to McDonald's. It probably would have been more quiet and relaxing.
2020-02-01,5,All I can say is WOW! Went here with low expectations but was definitely impressed. Some of the best coffee in Hoboken. We got the Iced Chai Latte & Iced Hazelnut Latte. Highly recommend!!!
2020-01-21,5,I really love this cafe! The coffee is good! I love how the staff is very nice and makes small conversations! But for me, their Ube cookie is AMAZING!!!! Every time I go I make sure I get it!! The view is so nice too and there is plenty of space to sit and do your work. There is a small section where little children can sit with children books. I only wish the hours were longer. They close at 5pm from tues- fri.. that's only the bummer..
2019-11-10,5,I love love love this coffee shop.  I just moved to this side of town this summer and was originally bummed in the way that coffee shop loyalists are when they move away from their favorite spot.  Not. Bummed. Now. The staff are super friendly, they definitely know and greet their regulars in the mornings even when it's busy. There is a nice selection of coffees (which once I'm not pregnant I'll be trying them all!) but I usually get a small cold brew. The pastries and sandwiches are tasty with particular shout out to the avocado  toast and the peanut butter banana toast (forget the name). It's also super family friendly with plenty of space-read you can get your stroller in here or leave it in the little patio area-and a kids reading area. I also like the local happenings notice board. Fun gluten free options as well and local baked goods if that's your thing. So that's that. This place is great. Give them your money and tell your friends.
2019-09-28,5,this place is a total delight and is now my goto breakfast spot near the Heights since congress station (RIP) is closed. The food is always fresh and i love how simple everything is here. The english muffin breakfast sammys are so cute and convenient, especially when you arent in the mood for a huge bagel sandwich. The avo toast with feta is the best breakfast/lunch item IMO. All the coffee drinks here are wonderful and my personal fav is their fresh lemonade! Sometimes i pop in just to grab a lemonade. They have a decent amount of seating both indoor and outdoor and its set back from the road so you dont feel like ur sitting on a busy sidewalk like many of the other places in hoboken! The service may get a little slow when they are busy but it is totally worth the wait. This place is very popular for families with young children too
2019-08-28,5,This little cafe tucked away in front of the lightrail station is truly a gem. Their baristas are very knowledgeable and craft wonderful beverages that are guaranteed to be delicious everytime. Their selection of locally produced snacks is also quite wonderful! Their food is also very delicious, although I wish they had more vegan options (I'm just a huge fan of tofu, I want some tofu on that menu haha). They do have some lovely snacks that are vegan and great for on the go! For those interested in lowering their waste, they have a seperate bin for their plates to be composted. I truly love this place and plan to frequent as much as feasibly possible!
2019-08-17,5,Love their coffees, lattes. Especially almond latte and the regular morning hot coffee refill, so much better than Starbucks. I wish they have an app to order in advance so during morning rush I can just pick up, would certainly switch my daily Starbucks runs to them if they had this option. Great breakfast options as well.
2019-07-26,5,Nice little spot on the most western part of Hoboken (it's nestled underneath a residential building that buys up against the light rail between 8th and 9th Street).  This was oddly my first time here (we passed it on the was back from the heights/union city after getting off of the elevator), and we were surprised by how expansive the menu was from breakfast to lunch, snacks and specials-they don't just do coffee and now we know! Also, I've seen they do special events here (I saw someone playing music there on Instagram the other day), and i believe it was geared towards kids, so that's used friendly, especially for Hoboken residents.  Swing by for a drink, a bite, and if you times it right some small local entertainment!
2019-07-24,5,Finally got a chance to go here for lunch today and I'm pleased I did! It's definitely off the beaten path for Hoboken locals but easily accessible for those who use the light rail. I had the lunch special which was a grilled chicken pressed on ciabatta with spinach, roasted red pep, mozz and a mango yogurt sauce. I was very impressed with how fresh and tasty it was! The vibe of the place is very laid back and very open. I have been to most cafes in town and this is probably one of the best places to bring a laptop and do work, hands down. It is quiet but has a cozy feel to it. I didn't get to try the coffee but I plan to come back. It's nice knowing there are good west side options so I don't always have to go to Washington St! Thank you for a great experience
2019-06-28,5,It's always a pleasure visiting Black Rail. The excellent customer service, delicious coffee... My favorite is the almond milk latte with a triple shot of espresso...and the delicious breakfast sandwiches make it a personal favorite of mine.  It's the perfect way to start your morning or just simply enjoy a leisurely lunch on their outdoor patio. A must try in Hoboken
2019-05-18,5,omg best  chocolate almond croissant EVER! Heaven. Worth every calories. Lol Also had wasa beef and cold brew. Loved both of them! Way to go.
2019-04-28,4,Stopped here while in the neighborhood based on the high reviews. Clean establishment with corner street location. Ordered a latte with whole milk and came out great. The cup was a standard no frills cup that was flimsy.
2019-04-27,5,My boyfriend and I took a walk here to try their lattes. Heard they were good. We ordered two medium iced lattes with almond milk. They really are very good! Perfect flavor of beans. James is amazing! The mocha here is incredible! So glad we stopped in. The cold brew is also VERY good. We highly recommend Black Rail. Inside is small and cute. Great view of the trees and rail road. They have Baking Mama cookies here too that we tried. Also very good. I love the lavender they use; it's from a nearby farm. And they have honey from NY too. I love that they have milk alternatives and the prices here are decent. Great place!! We will be back to try more!
2019-03-18,5,Wonderful staff and excellent food. The ambiance of this place was perfect for reading and studying.
2019-02-06,4,Great little place. Nice coffee and food is surprisingly tasty. I had the beef stew which was great.
2019-02-05,5,Great staff and serving really tasty coffee. They make alot in house and have a good selection of healthy fare. In a bit of a dead spot so great if you are at the train station
2018-11-09,5,A transit hub café that just works. It has survived and prospered on the west side of town, and it has become a reliable stop for commuters using the 9th Street Light Rail, as well as residents just passing through. The options are simple and the coffee is excellent. Live long and prosper, Black Rail!
2018-10-07,4,Right by the light rail station, serving good coffees and various toasts and sandwiches. Enjoyed avocado toast, taste quite good and enjoyed it, but as other reviewers commented, it's pricey despite the fact they use a paper plate and thin slices.
2018-07-16,5,Excellent coffee and a coffee shop menu that goes beyond your standard pastries and avocado toast selection. The menu offers a variety of sweet and savory sandwich offerings like roast beef, turkey and fig and even pulled pork. I went with a cold brew and a toasted peanut butter, banana and honey sandwich. The sandwich was also supposed to have bacon and rosemary, but I was feeling more sweet than savory and left it out. Perla N. ordered a turkey and fig sandwich and really enjoyed it. For around 8 or 9 dollars the sandwich came with two very large halves.There is an outdoor patio with a decent amount of seating if you find yourself here on a nice day. Overall, it's a solid neighborhood coffee shop and cafe. There are similar spots in my neck of the woods, so I might not go out of my way to return. But if I found myself in the neighborhood I would absolutely go back for a caffeine / wifi / lunch fix.
2018-05-11,5,Cute place! Super nice staff, good coffee, great prices. If you work in the area this place is perfect to grab a quick breakfast. I got one of the breakfast sandwiches which was delicious and super cheap.
2018-05-09,5,Went here on a Saturday at 3pm. Great place, friendly staff and delicious food.They were kind to accomodate customizations and also offered recommendations. A solid 5-stars!
2018-03-28,3,The Place is ok, but the Asian lady was rude to me... She didnt even say you're welcome after my Thank You... A bit pricey too... I usually  don't care about money but as long as people who work at these places act professional and courteous, ...because i'm paying customer and i shouldn't care about if someone is having a bad day or a shitty attitude ....
2018-03-26,4,Excellent place tucked in next to the Hoboken Light Rail stop.  My son remembers it for tasty croissants and good kombucha.  Tried the Peach for the first time and it was excellent.  The croissants were buttery and flaky.  I haven't eaten lunch there yet but looks to be an interesting array of sandwich options.  Maybe next time!
2017-12-28,4,Ya know, I like this place. They have quality food and decent coffee. Service is good too. Just a tip for first-time customers: Do NOT, under any circumstances, look their custodian in the eyes. He may look friendly, but he will attack you and it will hurt. I learned this the hard way! Bathrooms are clean though.
2017-11-22,5,Love these guys. This western part of Hoboken doesn't get much love but this gem, which is right next to the Light Rail is hard to resist. Tucked into a residential building this coffee place is easily accessed from the northern entrance/exit of the NJ Light Rail. Coffee is always fresh and the food options are pretty great too. Top notch service and always friendly. Great array of flavors and milks for the latte connoisseur and a great spot for brunch. Avocado Toast and great breakfast sandwiches. Also a great place to bring your laptop to get some work done or meet with a friend or colleague.
2017-11-08,5,I really love this place. They have the best avocado toast in the neighborhood and they also have intelligentsia coffee. It's really great!
2017-10-25,5,My favorite cafè in Hoboken! Good for a quick grab and go breakfast sandwich before jumping on the light rail, which is next to the shop. Besides fantastic coffee, the food menu is an all-star, all the time. I've never eaten anything other than delicious, fresh ingredients. This is my boyfriends favorite spot to sit with his laptop to work for a few hours. The late day bargains on the pastries and baked goods are my favorite!! Wonderful family business that we're happy to support.
2017-08-26,5,What a family friendly cafe!!This small place has everything that you want for hot summer days.I came here with my hubby and he ordered black iced coffee and I ordered Nitro Kombucha and it was perfect iced drinks.I tried Kombucha for the first time and I loved it. It was sweet and sour and sparkling taste. Perfect balance!!!I also like the mini ice cubes.
2017-08-09,5,This place is awesome. Erica is by far my favorite person there, she remembers my drink always and greets me with a smile always! The location is super convenient, prices are so reasonable for the product you get! My only complaint is they aren't open on Sundays, so I amForced to look elsewhere and suffer. Definitely check this place out before hopping on the light rail to work!! Or on a Saturday AM grab a coffee and outside reading the paper.
2017-08-02,2,While the staff is very nice, so far in one week they have messed up two simple orders. They walk around with their heads in the clouds and i don't think they pay attention to what customers ask for. The food is overpriced for what you are getting. No such thing as popping in to grab something---takes them 15 min to make the smallest turkey sandwich ever. Tried again. They are still very nice but if you want a quick anything, go pretty much anywhere else in hoboken. They spend more time talking to people than making the damn sandwiches.
2017-07-29,5,Sandwiches of the month are so good - I dream about them.  The only bad part is that it's very sad when they go away since they change monthly.
2017-07-22,3,Came here as wanted to get some breakfast food and coffee before heading over to Shoprite as try not to go shopping when hungry as end up buying lots of junk food.Place looks like your stereotypical Indy coffee shop with mix matched chairs, chalkboard menu and intelligentsia coffee.  My iced mocha coffee was good though a small for 450 seems pricey and large is 650.   Got the egg and sausage on an English muffin which they oddly pre make, wrap in foil and put in a warming tray like it was McDonald's or a gas station.  Even if they were making it constantly a few minutes in one of those Cools down the meat and makes bun soggy. The avocado toasts looked better.  Based on food alone gets a 1 star and almost gave place 2.  Likely will not be Back here.
2017-06-10,5,I work around the corner from this place and pass by it every day. Today I decided to stop in to this neat little coffee shop cuz it was a hot day, and it was right next to the light rail.I ordered a small cold-brew ice coffee, had a seat, and was pleasantly surprised. The ice coffee was fantastic, and there's a small "fixin's" bar off to side where you can add sugar & extra milk to your drinks.This place is really hipster, nice beats playing on the speakers, tons of outlets for you to plug in your devices and just chill for a while.I haven't tried the food, but they have a decent menu to choose from. I'll definitely come back to this place and eat, maybe even bring some friends.
2017-05-08,4,Great coffee, friendly staff and nice atmosphere. They serve intelligentsia coffee which tastes great.I usually order biggie small sized iced latte (20 oz) and a pastry or sandwich. They have wide variety of  pastries and sandwiches available for breakfast and lunch.
2017-04-01,5,My boyfriend and I came here after having some tacos and we both had a biggie smalls sized ice latte with almond milk. No sugar. BEST latte we've ever had and he isn't even an almond milk drinker. Also, guys are super friendly and down to earth.
2017-03-18,4,Solid neighborhood coffee spot.  Egg sandwiches are good early, and I like the avocado toast with smoked salmon for lunch.
2016-12-10,5,Good sandwiches that are made to order, pastries from Choc O Pain, & my fave...... their cold brew coffee, Biggie sized.  Owners are always pleasant & love that they are kid-friendly.
2016-12-09,5,If you love warm holiday drinks, you must try the Gingerbread Latte here! It's only available for a limited time and it tastes exactly like a Gingerbread cookie. You will be amazed! This is also a very friendly place for children - cute kid books, high chairs and children's meals. The owners and the staff are fantastic. Enjoy!
2016-10-30,5,Love everything and this place! The avacodo toast is absolutely delicious and their bagels are amazing. I'm excited to explore the menu and coffee options further! Staff are always so nice and the owner is so kind. I would go here everyday if I could! Highly recommend.
2016-10-27,4,Really good coffee- and they helped me in a pinch by delivering a box of joe and cookies.
2016-10-26,5,Awesome people and food. Their specials are always amazing. Lavender latte and hot chocolate are addictive.
2016-09-08,5,This is probably my favorite place in Hoboken to get coffee and sandwiches. I suggest getting the healthier sandwich on sourdough & and a cold brew. The bread is always fresh & the cold brew is never too earthy or bitter. It's also conveniently located next to the 9th street light rail station which is great because trying to find parking in Hoboken is never fun.
2016-08-13,5,Every coffee and food item I've tried here was a hit. The folks are also super friendly.
2016-07-27,5,This quiet little place probably has one of the best iced coffees I've had in Hudson county if not the best. The iced latte(w/ a shot of caramel) was also amazing. Great find and definitely will be back. You can't beat their prices either.
2016-07-19,5,James at Black Rail Coffee is the kind of person who restores your faith in humanity. I fell on the light rail track today and sprained my ankle -- so embarrassing!  Two guys got me up off the track and helped me over to the chairs at Black Rail.  I was walking back from Starbucks, so had that cup in my hand -- nothing like drinking the competitor's coffee while sitting in an establishment's chairs, having purchased nothing.  James came out to ask if he could help, and when he heard what happened immediately offered a bag of ice for my ankle, which was a big help.  Noticing that I was drinking ice coffee, he offered a cup of their's on the house -- it was so amazing!  I have had cold brew coffee before and never found it to be special -- this was entirely different -- no bitterness at all.  My daughter and I stayed for a good twenty minutes with the bag of ice on my ankle -- we were treated with nothing but kindness, even though we hadn't been customers.  We certainly will be in the future!
2016-06-09,4,The coffee was good. Not the best I've ever had, but definitely a good latte. We also had avocado toast which was incredible, but $8.50 for two pieces of toast with some sliced avocado on it is a bit steep... There's a lot of outdoor seating which is great!
2016-06-08,5,We went in for their lunch food and were amazed. We got their sandwich of the month (strawberries, almonds, Brie, spinach, onions, honey) and they kindly replaced the turkey with avocado. It was outstanding.We also got their avocado toast (they serve breakfast all day!). It had avocado, red pepper flakes, lemon, and feta (an extra 50 cents). Also delicious.We ordered two black iced teas which were really strong and tasty. Free wifi (with a password) and nice outdoor seating right by the light rail. Would definitely recommend.
2016-05-07,5,We went here after our gym session today. We like sandwiches and it's hard to get a sandwich that is big on quality and not quantity!!! I got the ham and Turkey panini and my husband got the healthy one. Was delicious! Quick service, clean, quiet& polite staff. Fresh ingredients & a proper portion! Not stuffed with processed meat! Reasonably priced - large green tea, water & two sandwiches 18 dollars. We will be back!
2016-03-29,5,I often work from coffee shops so I was very happy to find this place!They have a great coffee and specialty drinks selection.  In addition, their sandwiches are all delish.  They are a hot panini type of sandwich shop, I've had the ham sandwich and turkey sandwich.  Sometimes during lunch if I'm not feeling up for a whole sandwich, they have a great half & half deal where they'll serve you a half sandwich and their soup of the day.  So far I've had their cream of broccoli soup and it has been flavorful, pipping hot and perfect for a windy Spring or cold winter day.Will definitely be back time and time again!!!
2016-02-27,5,A regular Cafe with all the kicks. Good atmosphere.Good Coffee. Good people right next to the light rail.Recommend for people who are looking for quiet family oriented place with good food and good coffee.
2016-01-29,5,Love this place , great family restaurant with amazing coffee. I've been coming here since my three year old was one and he has grown to love the establishment from there kid corner to there kids choices its amazing
2016-01-25,4,This is a pretty great little stop along my commute, I've been coming here pretty regularly since shortly after they opened and have been happy every time. Their pre-made breakfast sandwiches are cheap and a good morning snack, they seem like they don't sit around for very long before getting snatched up so I don't feel gross grabbing one out of a warming tray. Their made to order food is very good as well - tasty avocado toast and the peanut butter &  banana sandwich is a fun addition to the menu as well. Coffee is solid, the Chai lattes have been a favorite of mine lately but the regular coffee won't do you wrong either. It's right at the 9th Street light rail station as well, so it's great to pop in and grab a quick sandwich and coffee while waiting for your train.
2015-12-28,5,****actually on 9th and Jackson*** it took me a little while to find this place since the location was misleading. as a native Hobokener I followed the street address but turned up in the back of the Monroe center lost. When I put in my gps it out me in no mans land until I finally saw a sign for it and followed it to the cafe I had been searching for. When I finally arrived they stated they were closing early and only could make food to go which was understandable. There was one cool fellow manning the register/coffee and another making the food. Seriously awesome vibes and menu choices. From the photos I knew I had to try the avocado toast! It was a must- and I absolutely loved the it! After walking home It was finally time to taste this epic treat!! First bite- uhhhhMazing!!!!!!!!! The hint of lemon and then the spice of the red peppers really wake you up!! I had 2 slices and already was completely full! next time I am definitely trying the avocado toast with feta and the lavender hot chocolate! Fun place and the coffee was great too!
2015-12-14,5,It's rare to find any type of establishment in life which upon finding it makes you wonder just how you lived without it. Black Rail is the type of shop that will make you do just that. Located adjacent to the 9th street HBLR stop, Black Rail is in a perfect spot to grab coffee and breakfast before the morning commute. Since I began taking the train from this stop, Black Rail has been a regular part of my routine. The coffee is not bitter nor burnt. The lattes rival any in town (including my favorite downtown shop Bean Vault) but what sets this cafe apart is the food. The breakfast sandwiches strike a rare combination of being pre made yet really really good. The sausage, egg and cheese on a croissant makes me smile and turkey, egg and Swiss is a perfect change of pace. Last week I got the avocado toast as I woke up early and actually got there more then 5 minutes prior to my train. It was in a word...ridiculous. The multi grain bread is toasted perfectly, there is a generous amount of sliced avocado and the red pepper flakes add a kick. Oh and James (one of the co owners) is an awesome human being, creating a welcoming atmosphere that is a great way to kick off your morning!
2015-12-10,4,Great people, coffee and tea along with any pastry that you can think of! Excellent atmosphere with the perks that you would not find in a Starbucks. As a matter of fact the pastries and drinks are better than a Starbucks! One regret is that it closes way to early!
2015-12-05,5,One of the best hidden gems in Hoboken. Living in Hoboken west, I love that there's finally a great coffee shop in the back of town. Black Rail has a chill vibe, delicious beverages and is a great spot to set up shop and bang out some work.
2015-11-13,5,This place is great! Offers the best coffee and it is right next to the light rail for the morning commute.
2015-11-09,5,I've heard so many great things about this coffee place, and am so happy that it lives up to the hype! I'm very confident that this will become one of my new regular coffee spots:1) Conveniently located on Jackson and 9th in Hoboken, right next to the light rail station. Easy place to run to if you commute via the light rail, or using the elevator to/from Hoboken/Jersey City. But despite its proximity to this major transit stop, I still found it to be pretty chill because it's on a quiet corner. (But to be fair, I haven't been there for morning rush hour lol)2) I got an Americano and my boyfriend got a French vanilla latte. Mine was pretty good, but my boyfriend LOVED his order which says a lot because he's much more particular about his coffee than me. We also got a raspberry kouign and almond croissant (by chocopain), which was very exciting because they're one of my favorite bakeries. They also have sandwiches, salads, breakfast, and even a kids menu in addition to pastries.3) I also appreciate their stock of healthier chip options, granola, etc. They even had bowls for you to sample the granolas they carry. I mean, who doesn't love a free sample? 4) The environment of the cafe is very nice. I like all the natural lighting, amount of seating indoors and outdoors, outlet availability, and decor. I wish the seats were a little more comfortable, but they weren't bad either.This combo of great coffee, favorite pastries, and easy access is right up my alley! Can't wait to head back again soon.
2015-10-02,5,Lovely cafe, never too crowded. They use Intelligentsia coffee and the espresso drinks are good, but the sandwiches are the best! Love "The Healthier" sandwich that's both delicious and good for you :)
2015-08-31,5,The drip coffee served here is seriously smooth and delicious! I will walk a few extra blocks to this shop instead of the laughable competition nearby. They're always quick and friendly unlike Maroon, which sucks.
2015-08-23,5,This was my first time going to this coffee shopp..Great staff great sandwiches great cold brew coffee cool space n great location
2015-07-18,5,Good coffee. Nice service. Ready-to-go breakfast sandwiches  in a hot tray are super tasty and convenient. Definitely will go back to try more stuff.
2015-07-14,4,The baked goods are good, croissants are great. The coffee is always fresh. Only downside is that it is a little expensive for coffee and a Danish. Staff is always very nice.
2015-06-10,4,space is great. location is kinda' weird unless you take the light rail a lot. but overall, really enjoyed coming to this joint to get some work in. everytime ive gone there's space with free wi-fi. service is solid and i enjoy their cold brew. not too strong, good solid flavor.would definitely recommend this place. its worth checking out. just wish they stayed open a little later. but still, a great place to go.
2015-06-03,5,This place is still rockin with their great sandwiches, sweets and of course coffee . Comfortable hang and friendly owners who will serve with a smile .
2015-05-26,5,Definitely the best coffee shop in Hoboken.  The intelligentsia coffee is better than anything else served in Hoboken and there is also a great assortment of quality pastries as well as breakfast and lunch sandwiches.  Try the lunch sandwiches.  They are legit.The owners are really awesome people and they take the time to get to know their customers and neighbors.  They put a lot of love into everything that they do and they have done an awesome job of creating a great vibe in their unique shop.
2015-05-17,5,My husband and I just moved to the Metro Stop which is above the Black Rail. We come here every weekend and my husband will grab lunch during the week when working from home.  When I first came in, they suggested I try the slow brewed ice coffee. I took their word for it and it was amazing. Very strong and tastes almost like a tea. The bagels are pretty good (coming from people who grew up on New York bagels). My husband raves about their sandwiches and on their 1 year anniversary they gave out homemade Notorious BIG cookies. They have such a friendly warm vibe there and wish them continued success!
2015-05-13,3,I might have to go back there and make another assessment. It was a good sign that they serve Intelligensia coffee. However, the house blend was not up to par with the other blends that Intelligensia coffee makes. This is not a critique of the establishment itself. However, my friend who was with me, ordered a latte and it was too milky. A lot of these places skimp on the coffee and they make it with so much milk, it's like having a steamer with a little bit of coffee. The place itself was nice, it's below a condominium, around the bend of the building. It's very cute and they have good pastries. I will go back and make another assessment.
2015-04-13,5,I have dreams about this cold brew. So, so, so good. And they have simple syrup! Why places that serve iced coffee don't all offer this as a sweetener option I will never understand. The owners are super friendly, service is great, breakfast sandwiches are A+ too.
2015-04-08,5,Anyone complaining about prices clearly:A: Hasn't tasted the quality of their food and drink.B: Doesn't live in or around Hoboken... I mean seriously, this town (the entire NY METRO) is expensive.C: Needs to go to Dunkin' Donuts... Remember people, you get what you pay for. This local coffee shop is full of unique flair and special touches that only the discerning eye will catch, but all will appreciate.  James (one of the two owners, they're a brother sister team) loves going to estate sales and finding unique pieces, including their huge mirror which has their lunch menu on it. Trust me, there is a reason this place is so highly rated. Ignore the couple detractors, they're just bitter over the prices, but I guarantee there is nothing bitter about their coffee. Great care and love goes into their food, drink and service. It's a place where everyone really does know your name. Go, and go often. Support local business, this one deserves it.
2015-03-20,3,They need to lower their prices. All I got was an iced coffee and a cupcake and it was almost $10. For that price I was expecting miracle coffee, instead it was just ok. The cupcake was good..... I would go back if the price goes down.
2015-03-08,4,Excellent coffee and pastries. Very nice place to read a book or just sit while waiting for the light rail. You can customize what type of milk you want (soy, almond, etc). Only con is that it's a little pricey.
2015-03-01,5,For JCHeights residents and Hoboken residents, this is a great place to hang out. I'm a sucker for good quality coffee, but I'm an even bigger "city girl" when it comes to finding that  good "coffee shop vibe" and this place has it. Not only do they have great cold brew, a decent cup of hot coffee, plenty of snacks and treats to nosh on as well as sandwiches, the staff truly cares about their customers. They listen and really understand their clientele. This place is kid friendly with children's books, welcoming to meet up with friends, and perfect to those of us that just want that place to be on our laptops or read a good book alone. I came here and frequented when they first opened as it is just an elevator ride away from where I live in JCHeights. Even though I can't go as often, Daisy and James still remember my name, are friendly and always accommodating no matter how busy they get! That makes me want to come back for more. What a great addition to the community. I look forward to being a part of their continued growth.
2015-02-28,5,I'm a big fan of Black Rail Coffee. The west side of Hoboken has long needed a great coffee place, and Black Rail is a welcome addition! The staff is friendly, the facility is bright, the wifi is strong, and the coffee and food/snack options are delicious. Things you MUST try: cold brew coffee and the "Healthier" sandwich. Both are outstanding. It is a great place to get some work done during the week (never crowded) or grab coffee with a friend.
2015-02-28,5,Love this place! Great service, food and decent prices. Coffee is great. My kids love the oatmeal and it's comfortable to take them for lunch, read a few of their kids books and watch trains go by. Our new favorite in Hoboken!
2015-02-28,5,Love!!! You guys rock! Best tea and hot chocolate in town! Thank-you for taking care of my boss while she's in there. I know she's in safe hands when she's zoned out in work lol.
2015-02-27,4,Awesome owners and atmosphere. The coffee is as distinct as it is delicious. My go to is the cold brew iced coffee. It tastes better without milk or sugar. Food is good and the WIFI seems to be the best in any Hoboken coffee shop I visited. The seating area is spacious, modern and comfortable. Great place to get fueled up, while getting things done.
2015-02-27,5,A wonderful addition to the neighborhood! The cold brew is amazing and its great that they have it all year long. The food is really good as well. Its awesome that you can sit down and enjoy your coffee in a comfortable setting. We go all the time!
2015-02-25,5,I love this place. It's cozy and the staff is so friendly. The iced coffee is outstanding, but just a warning that stuff is like ROCKET FUEL.
2015-02-20,5,Great ambience, relaxing, great food, great coffee.
2015-02-18,5,It may not be the season for it, but their cold brew is awesome! Owners James and Daisy are so nice and caring, it makes visiting black rail a really great experience.
2015-02-17,5,I don't drink coffee often but when I do I prefer it from Black Rail! Best coffee in Hoboken!!!!
2015-02-09,4,Important Note: 800 Jackson St. is NOT between 4th and 5th St as the Yelp map indicates; it is actually located right outside the 9th St Light Rail stop in Hoboken.A convenient pit stop right off the Light Rail. It's a big enough size to have a few tables to sit down and enjoy your coffee, have a snack, and either wait for or relax after riding the train. I stopped in to get a cold brew even though it was 20 degrees outside but it was so good and so worth it. I think I have fully transitioned from iced coffee to cold brews from now on, too. They have a breakfast and lunch menu, as well, but I didn't have anything to eat when I visited. They also have cookies, biscotti's and goodies to choose from, all of which looked tasty. Very friendly staff, too. In an area where lots of new shops and restaurants are popping up this is no doubt a great addition. Well worth stopping in for some great coffee.
2015-01-08,4,Top notch coffee (love the cold brew), and excellent sandwiches and soups. My favorite is the healthier sandwich. I'm glad this place is so convenient to the light rail. Highly recommended!
2014-11-03,5,Forget Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts, try this place. The owners here, James and Daisy Jung, are super nice and very outgoing. Coffee is good here, so try one. I had the Pumpkin Pie Latte, which was good and even better than Dunkin Donuts'. Good muffins here. I've never had sandwiches before but hope to try them. I usually stop here on my way to the ferry at Port Imperial on the light rail. Highly recommended.
2014-11-01,5,My daily Black Rail large iced coffee sustained me for 2 weeks of paternity leave this summer. Lattes and espresso are top knotch. Very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Indoor seating is very spacious and comfortable, with a large patio area out front. The owners are experienced and it shows in how consistent they are in their service, drinks and food. An awesome and desperately needed addition to the neighborhood.Highlights:Best iced coffee in Hoboken - on par with Mod Cup in JCBreakfast sausage egg & cheese sandwichesPretentious Piggy sandwich (ham, brie, apple, dijon & spinach on grilled sourdough bread)
2014-10-21,5,Came here with a sorta big order. Black rail was so friendly and attentive. Everyone enjoyed their coffee and sandwiches! :) Thanks, Black Rail!
2014-10-13,5,This spot is a great hidden gem in Boken. Try the Pretentious Pig sandwich (not on the menu). Ham, brie, spinach, apple and dijon is my pick for lunch.
2014-10-02,5,LOVE Black Rail! Completely addicted to their cappuccino and their iced green tea! Daisy & James are fantastic. A super welcome addition to the neighborhood!
2014-09-30,5,This is seriously an amazing place! So delicous. I stop by as many time before work as I can. The latte with the organic milk, the cold brew and the healthier sandwich are what I tried so far and they are AMAZING. the place is really chill . Can't wait for my next shift at work so I can pass by again!
2014-09-29,4,Love this place. Their pastries are the best around. I always get the same sandwich -the caprese- and it's always exquisite. Perfect blend of flavors, amazing mozzarella and real basil and a delightful balsamic vinegar. Their promotions are good and change every week or so. The staff are all spectacular! Just the friendliest people. Love Daisy and James. They always make my time at BR happy. If they had salads I would give them five stars.
2014-09-28,5,This is my favorite coffee spot in town- I call it my oasis. The staff is friendly and welcoming, their coffee is delicious, and they serve a tasty variety of pastries, sandwiches and snacks. I also love the ambience, whether sitting in their spacious indoor area, or taking in some fresh air at one of their outdoor tables. I recommend this place to everyone I know in the area!
2014-09-13,5,Great addition, great coffee, and lovely customer service. It's like a Coffee shop mixed with Cheers. Everyone knows your name. Well Daisy and her brother do anyway :)
2014-09-10,5,A great family-owned shop. Daisy and James really make you feel at home, the coffee is wonderful and so are the sandwich offerings.
2014-08-20,5,Great little spot right in my building :) they're always friendly, give a discount to building residents, and make a mean cappuccino. I wish they were opened earlier, but that's my only real complaint. The cold brew is crack worthy and now that they've partnered with chocopain for croissants, they've become my go-to for breakfast.
2014-08-01,5,Great coffee (both cold and warm brew), delicious sandwiches and friendly service. The atmosphere inside makes for a great place to catch up with a friend or have an informal business meeting.  the free wifi offered also makes this joint an ideal location to get some work done. Highly recommend.
2014-07-26,5,Great little coffee shop! Im a Duncan Donut girl through & through, but had some time to kill so stopped in & grabbed a cafe americano. Reasonable prices, very friendly staff, good hot cup of coffee & a nice little sitting area outside. Will be back next time I'm in the area.
2014-07-25,4,Black Rail is a new and unique coffee shop located steps away from the 9th Street Light Rail Station.  Fresh, quality coffee is always welcome in my neighborhood, as well as a comfortable space to relax and enjoy your purchases. The decor is modern in a 70s kind of way, and the furniture is spaced well, not cramped.  Black Rail has the lattes and such that many coffee fans demand, as well as a modest selection of fresh pastries and made-to-order 'healthy' sandwiches.  Although the sandwiches are a tad pricey, they now include chips so that's good.Other things to mention include a selection of cold drinks including ice-brewed coffee, some outdoor seating in the shade,  and a suggestion box that I actually plan to use to be helpful. Most important, the business is run by really nice people that like to converse and make your experience a pleasant one. Check it out.
2014-07-14,4,No complaints here.  Baristas were perfectly pleasant.  Ordered a rather large iced coffee - affectionately referred to as size: biggie smalls - and a tasty muffin and retreated to an outdoor table where I popped a laptop and proceeded to work for a few hours.  Fast Wi-Fi.  Located steps off the light rail, people watching became an ancillary perk - the massive construction project next door, not so much.No slow bar, no five star.
2014-07-14,5,I love the vibe that this place has. It feels like I'm at a friend's house having coffee because of the set  up and the friendly staff. Coffee is GREAT! The iced coffee is DEF. worth the $4. I will say I was shocked at the price at first, but I understand, after the staff explained it to me. It is SO smooth and sweeter. I usually take my coffee with milk and sugar but I can just drink this black. If you do not want to spend the $4 on the iced coffee then that's on you. I've seen the staff get yelled at over the price, but any other quality coffee shop has about the same price for a cold brew iced coffee.The sandwiches are amazing. My favorite is either the Turkey meets Ham or the Healthier Sandwich (cute names). They take a little under 4 minutes to prepare. They do recycle. You just need to hand it to them and ask them to recycle whatever. They don't leave out bins because they're concerned that some people will throw trash in. This has it's pros and cons. They also have a suggestion jar which shows that they really value the customers opinions. I love it and am so glad that they're here in the neighborhood.
2014-07-05,4,A great addition to this neighborhood.  Also right next to the lightrail so you can enjoy a cup while waiting for the train or take one for your ride.  Friendly staff and good tasty coffee.  I will be frequenting this quite often
2014-07-03,3,My usual spot is Maroon, but this place just opened and it's 2 blocks from my building so I thought it would be nice to switch it up. 5 stars for convenience, especially proximity to light rail. But wow the coffee taste was not worth it to me. $14 later, I wasn't over joyed with coffee; however I thought the chocolate chip scones were great.
2014-06-28,5,I think I found a new favorite coffee shop! Not just because of the free muffin with a large latte but because their stuff is actually good! And yes I don't wonder why that cranberry orange muffin is the fave. Very friendly staff too! Yeay! Conveniently located right in front of the 9th st Congress Lightrail in Hoboken so anyone who are on the go this place is also very quick and prompt.
2014-06-26,1,Are you kidding me with $4.25 for an iced coffee ?? The large is a medium 16oz by anyone's standard. A 20 oz coffee at STARBUCKS is less than here. What a rip off, wont go back.
2014-06-09,4,Finally!! I have been longing for good coffee near my apartment within walking distance! I live right by Black Rail and always either had to take a light rail to Washington or walk  15 minutes or so. The coffee is smooth, fragrant and delicious. Food wise, I can see they're still working out the menu and the sandwiches are in test mood, so to speak. Either way, the sandwiches are tasty and they take time to prepare them. I only wish there were breakfast sandwiches available readily. And I have a feeling they will be soon. Great service too! Almost feels like I'm at a friends place for coffee- very casual and comfortable vibe.
2014-06-09,5,Seriously loving this place. I think I might have to make it my default latte spot. I passed by and decided I had to try it out. The place itself has this modern feel to it - open, bright, and spacious. There's plenty of seating available and from what I see, people aren't flocking to it--yet.  Because of the hot weather,  I went for the iced latte- (vanilla) with soy milk. Let me tell you - it doesn't water down after 5 minutes and the taste is just delicious. I had one of their pastries and it was worth cheating on my diet. After 3 PM - all the pastries are 50% off. I have yet to try their sandwiches but I will update when I do. They also have an area where you can leave suggestions on the service/coffee, which is neat. Shows they value the opinion of  the customer!
2014-05-10,5,I've said it before and I'll say it again -- what a welcome addition to the neighborhood!! Our little corner of Hoboken was in desperate need of a quality coffee shop and now we have one! I'm a pretty classic coffee drinker - just hand me a cup of strong, drip coffee and I'm a happy camper. The beans that The Black Rail is using are wonderfully flavorful and have a great complexity to it. Pastries are also incredibly delicious. I'm looking forward to the next time I'm around at lunch time to give one of their sandwiches a try. They always sound so good!Service is friendly. I think these guys have a great thing going and wish them lots of success!
2014-05-09,5,Great coffee, sandwich, and pastry!  Friendly staff and lovely ambiance!
