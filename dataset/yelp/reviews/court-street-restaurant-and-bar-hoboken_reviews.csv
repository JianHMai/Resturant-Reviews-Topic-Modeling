2021-10-24,5,I LOVE THIS PLACE!! First time here I couldn't wait to come back the food was great and the staff was amazing!! Kind, quick, knew what they were doing and just awesome!! Just got back in town and couldn't wait to get back!! Having an amazing Sunday brunch! Ya feel like family and forever friends!! Thank you !!My fav Hoboken spot for a beer and amazing food!!
2021-10-03,1,Went there tonight after Hoboken Festival with co workers and it was horrendous! One of my co worker ordered a burger that came out to the table raw!, rediculous!. How can you provide service like this. I used to go to this place awhile back and it was great. It went down hill. It's ashame. I was listening to others that were dinning there as well and also complaining. With all that being said our waitress gave us an attitude plus charged us twice for a take out order. Ovoid this place, there are such great restaurants in Hoboken to go to.
2021-08-09,5,Best burgers in Hoboken!Small, quiet, chill bar with great food. This place is more upscale then you would think from a side street bar. The dining room menu you has a lot of great options and often has a ton of specials. I went again last week and they had about 20 specials on the menu- swordfish, lamb shank, venison, ossobuco- things you don't see at a normal bar.
2021-08-02,2,I came here for dinner for my boyfriend and I's anniversary and really regret not going somewhere else. It was nice and had nice music and the waitress was great but the food was pretty disappointing and overpriced. We started with drinks and  calamari but my drink didn't come until after our appetizer. The calamari was chewy but the marinara sauce was good. They also served a bread basket but the bread was cold, not fresh and kind of hard. We asked if they could warm up the bread but the kitchen refused. Nicely another waitress we asked stuck it in the microwave for a few seconds. I ordered their filet mignon which was cooked very well but the steak tasted so cheap and bland and was barely seasoned.. definitely not worth $45. The mashed potatoes also tasted so plain and not seasoned at all. The broccoli was also pretty plain. My boyfriend got chicken parm which wasn't all that exciting either. The marinara sauce was bland and overall the dish lacked flavor.
2021-08-01,2,3 of us Came here for Sunday brunch. None of us really liked our food. Most of it came out cold. Very over priced for breakfast.Go to BluestoneLane or O'Bagel, you'll be much happier.
2021-06-07,5,I came across a picture of a dinner dish from this place on Instagram a few weeks ago and have been dying to go ever since - definitely lived up to the high expectations I had!They start you off with complimentary bread that comes with butter and tapenade. We ordered the cream of mushroom soup (loved) and the shrimp & chorizo app (very good as well). For our entrees, we both ordered the lobster & shrimp pasta that had this delicious basil lemon garlic sauce. Unfortunately we had no room for desert, as we were already rolling out of there. IF we were to get desert, the profiteroles that we kept seeing go by, looked incredible.
2021-05-23,5,Had only been for brunch in the past but finally made it here for a quick dinner! They have a nice bar room but we sat in the main dining room and were spaced nicely from other diners. The waitress was super attentive and friendly and gave great recommendations. Solid choice of wine and cocktails!The French onion soup was the right amount of salty and covered in cheese and came out piping hot!We weren't too hungry after the soups so we split the beef burgundy after a recommendation from our waitress and boy were we glad! The beef literally fell apart when you bit into it. So much flavor and over perfectly cooked egg noodles! We considered getting a second one to go for the next day! Cannot wait to come back and try other things on the menu. I suggest if you're going on a weekend for dinner, make a reservation or call ahead!
2021-05-22,5,Loved it here-- it's a lot bigger than it seems from the outside & the menu is extensive. Also our waiter Kris went out of his way to check on us & take my allergies into account. He was super fun & knowledgeable and I'll definitely be back!!!
2021-04-13,1,Omg gross! I am feeling better today but this was the worst decision i made to have my boyfriend go and pick up dinner from this place. We ordered salmon with veggies , steak and lobster and stuffed crab mushrooms. Everything was disgusting BUT the lobster and bread. The stuffed mushrooms were okay. Now for the salmon it smelled so bad and had the worse taste! I'm still nauseas from thinking about this salmon. Please beware! The steak was OVERCOOKED and completely cheap steak. Will not be coming back here as the price they charge is ridiculous to receive this type of food.
2021-03-12,5,Another great evening! Took a friend here for her birthday and really enjoyed everything! She really liked her potato crusted tilapia and of course my burger was delicious!! We also tried the baked Brie appetizer- perfect to share! I love this place, highly recommend! Don't forget to try a slice of pie and say hi to Jeff behind the bar!
2021-03-08,4,I had brunch at Court Street for the first time this weekend! Prior to this, I've only really gone to Court street for dinners and drinks at the bar (pre covid).  We made a reservation for two at 1:30 pm (you have to call for reservations) and had a high top table in the bar area right by the front door.  At first I was concerned we'd be cold right by the door, but there was a heater right under our table that worked very well.  The restaurant was completely full/booked for brunch and many walk-ins were turned away while we were there. For brunch drinks, I tried their espresso martini.  I had recently saw a photo of their espresso martini in a HobokenGirl post and I was skeptical it would be good since it had a much lighter color.  It was pretty good- they use a lot of baileys in their's which is why it has the light color.  It was very dessert like.  My friend had a bloody mary.   For meals, I tried the Jersey sandwich which had egg, taylor ham and cheddar cheese on a Kaiser roll.  It was delicious and huge!  It came with choice of fries/salad/home fries and I went with their waffle fries since they are always really good.  My friend had the avocado chicken sandwich with fries.  The nice thing about their brunch is that it includes a basket of their Irish Soda bread - very tasty & fresh.  Our server was very friendly and it was a nice leisurely brunch!
2021-02-15,5,Always had a terrific meal and great service at Court Street. Their lamb chops are fabulous!
2021-01-25,2,Ate here one night with my boyfriend. We ordered the special. Some things we wanted they were out of. Disappointed.We wanted to sit at the bar but it was reserved. An older gentleman came in and sat there by himself. So many seating options. So we were a little turned off by that from the start.Service was okay. Food was not great. Overpriced. We likely will not return. Maybe for lobster. But it's probably overpriced too.
2021-01-13,5,By far the best lobster deal around. Wednesdays are their lobster fest nights and they feature 1-1/4 lobster with soup/salad, vegetables and a potato. Can't beat it! The food there is always top-notch and it's a place I like to bring family from out of town and my significant other for date nights. Court Street is a Hoboken staple!
2020-10-08,5,Went there for the first time. We made a reservation since we weren't sure how busy it would be for a Saturday night. But the person on the phone was super nice! The food was amazing and their safety precautions were great! As soon as we sat down, the host informed us that the menus were just sanitized and there was sanitizer on the table for us if needed. The waitress kinda kept her distance a little bit when taking our order which is safe as well. She also wore gloves. Food/drinks came out pretty fast. Highly recommend.
2020-09-28,5,This is one of my favorite spots in Hoboken. The food is amazing and the service is great. The back room of the restaurant has a more formal vibe than the front but overall it flows. What's nice is that there is a full bar in the front so almost no drink/shot is out of the question. Great date spot, great for all occasions. Will be back many times!
2020-09-19,5,We live in the neighborhood.  Great food, huge menu - LOVE this place.  Have gotten takeout and dined (outside) during Covid and are very impressed with how they are handling things.  Go try them out!  You won't be disappointed!!
2020-09-01,2,The service was good. But I'm a vegetarian - they have some good options but all are made with eggplant. When I went they were out of eggplant even though I was there basically when they opened. So there were no options for me. Pretty terrible experience...
2020-08-30,5,I always love everything at court street!!  The service is always wonderful and the bartenders don't disappoint.  The Georgia Peach is definitely my favorite cocktail in Hoboken
2020-08-17,5,Definitely recommend for a fancy outdoor dinner! Safely distanced, great cocktails & incredible food.
2020-08-11,5,We have been coming here for at least four years now and it's our favorite. Everyone at Court Street is super nice and the food is excellent. You can pick any dish at random and it will be really good. The cocktails are my favorite in Hoboken. And even with the outdoor seating situation because of the pandemic, the service is flawless and every precaution is taken.
2020-08-10,5,This is the first time I've felt compelled enough to write a review after a dining experience. The food there was exceptional, hands down the best meal I've had in a restaurant so far and worth every penny. Great service, and very welcoming environment. Will be coming back again and bringing everyone I know!
2020-08-10,5,Neighborhood favorite. If you're looking for quality food Court street has everything from Lobster specials to a great Ruben sandwich. Great staff, quality food, good prices make this an easy place to keep going back to
2020-08-08,5,the best homemade corned beef hash in nj!!!great service!great cocktails!kid friendly! our family will def be coming back.
2020-07-05,5,I don't review very often but my wife and I love court street. I generally think Hoboken food is very mediocre, but this place always delivers. Their seafood is great and sandwiches are too.
2020-06-26,5,Court Street offers by far and away the best food, cocktails and dessert in Hoboken. A great menu along with rotating daily specials. I've never ordered anything here that was less than perfect. During the pandemic, Artie allowed me to order full pies and desserts to my home, along with bottles of wine and champagne at great prices. We can't wait to get back to the bar on a Friday and have have dinner with the Bartender, Jeff. Big bonus for me is they have a seven page wine list with many awards from Wine Spectator magazine at maybe a 20% markup from the liquor store - AMAZING VALUE!!
2020-05-23,5,Love this Hoboken gem that consistently delivers delicious food with a cool neighborhood vibe. The staff is always welcoming and friendly. I look forward to the restaurant re-opening for dine in, but in the meantime I will continue to pick up dinner to go! Keep up the great work.
2020-05-11,5,Haven't ordered takeout aside from court street during the pandemic. Service is excellent and the food is as always, amazing. Plus how can you beat the friendly faces that greet you each time you walk in. Highly recommend!
2020-04-25,5,Delicious!  I love Court Street!  We got delivery during the pandemic.  The person that answered the phone was very nice.  We ordered the pork chop with spicy peppers and it came with a potato and vegetable, and angel hair, tomatoes, basil and cream with shrimp.  It was delicious I just wish there were some tomatoes.  They also sent their classic bread with olive tapenade.  We will order again!
2020-02-21,4,My wife and I have eaten here several times, and it never disappoints. The food is always consistent, the service is good, and the ambiance is enjoyable. There are specials every evening, and so there is always an abundance of choice for every palate. The prices are very reasonable. My only critique is that I wish they would vary the sides that come with the specials.
2020-02-17,5,I was walking to another restaurant when this small bar caught my husbands attention. We were immediately greeted by Arthur. Since it was Sunday, I had to have my bubbly. My husband wanted an IPA, he said to Arthur  can we talk IPA?  We learned so much from him about IPA and wine. That's what makes a good bartender.  We were brought a bread basket with a twist. It had a side of tapenade that they also sell.  I ordered the salmon appetizer. 5 large pieces of smoked salmon, capers, onions, tomatoes, dill dipping sauce on a dinner size plate. I was happy!! My husband ordered the chorizo and shrimp appetizer also enough for two people.  We had such great time meeting new people and laughing with my new favorite bartender. 6 hours goes by quickly when mix good food, beverage, and people.
2020-01-25,4,This place is hidden on 6th and Washington. A very cozy place with homey food. The first time I came I got the pasta ragu, which was okay. But my friends got fish and chicken and they really liked it.I decided to try this place out again because my friends' dishes were so good and I ended up getting one of the specials for the night. First, we started off with bread and it comes with this really tasty olive spread (I forgot the name). If you are not into olives then you won't like it.So I got the pork chop with a light tomato garlic sauce with vegetables and it was so good. The pork was so filling and the sauce was the perfect amount of tomatoey and garlicy. It came with some sort of beet or sweet potato side and I wasn't really about it, but that's also because I'm not that into sweet potato. The dessert menu looked good but I was so stuffed from my meal I only stuck with the entree. The service was really nice and would come here again to try something different. Their lamb shank looks so good, can't wait to try that next!
2019-10-16,5,Court Street is a hidden gem in Hoboken. Located on 6th and Court off Washington Street, you walk right into a homey bar bar with a formal dining room in the back. The dinner menu has daily specials and is always delicious. A favorite of mine is the bar menu sandwich- The Belmar. Court Street has great weeknight specials including lobster night and prime rib nights.
2019-10-14,5,Delicious, consistent food and amazing, efficient service with a cozy/buzzing atmosphere!
2019-09-30,5,Potato crusted fish is so good and goes well with their wine pairing. This is a hidden gem on the corner Washington which is nice to have something like this in Hoboken. Decor is amazing too.
2019-07-29,3,Came here as part of restaurant week. Understood that we had a big group, but it was still an average experience. For the food, I went with the beef carpaccio (a bit bland, skimped on the beef), short ribs (well seasoned, but a bit dry), and chocolate peanut butter pie (good....but how can you mess up pb and chocolate?) Service was ok...we had to flag down the waiter every time we needed anything. It was exactly what you expected from a restaurant in downtown Hoboken. Not great, not terrible, but still overpriced.
2019-07-07,5,This is my absolute favorite dinner and happy hour spot in Hoboken, especially on Mondays for their Prime Rib Special.Great location, fast and friendly service, great wine and beer list, diverse menu (and everything is fresh, plentiful and delicious), and a cozy ambiance. Keep up the good work!
2019-05-18,4,Finally getting around to trying every restaurant in hoboken and this was next up on the list! The location is good, tucked just off Washington. We didn't have to wait which was a pleasant surprise on a Saturday night, but definitely busy! The service was good and the decor/ambiance pleasant. A bit noisy as the tables are situated very close together. The food was very tasty despite an over cooked piece of fish. Prices are also very reasonable for what were generous portion sizes and good quality food. Overall we were very satisfied!
2019-05-13,5,For Mother's Day my daughter took my wife and I to this restaurant I could say that this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to food service the people can't be that the prices were reasonable overall and meals were on the money I recommend everybody go to this place and try it taste a great chef cooking
2019-03-15,4,My husband and I have been twice and both times were solid. Food is always tasty and the people nice.  I haven't been able to explore too much in Hoboken as we have only been here a year, but this is one of our places we keep returning to when we have a chance to get out for dinner.
2019-03-03,5,This is my favorite restaurant.. they only serve brunch on sundays but it is an amazing experience... if you have not tried this restaurant I definitely recommend you come here at least once and experience it for yourself..
2019-02-27,5,Took us over 2 years to try this place but now that we have it'll be a go to.  We came for lobsterfest and it did not disappoint.  Can't wait for my next meal at Court St.
2019-02-24,5,The staff was so nice, the food was so delicious and the portions were great for the price. For about 8 people and 2 pitchers of the poinsettia (which was delish) the bill was only 120$ with complementary Irish soda bread and fruit. Such great food, amazing portions, and amazing prices.
2019-02-23,5,I've been eating here for 20 years and I've never had a bad meal. The service is as great as the food. If your just sitting at the bar, say hello to Jeff, he's the best bartender in town.
2019-02-18,5,Wowow! I've eaten at so many restaurants in hobo I don't know why it took so long to try court street. Definitely underrated in town! We popped in for dinner last week. Extensive menu- there's plenty to choose from between chicken, seafood, meat, and pastas. The chicken marsala was so tender and delicious. Steak frites was amazing. I saw a lot of tables order the surf and turf, must be a popular choice? I came with my boyfriend but I'd definitely recommend for a date or large group!
2019-02-15,4,Came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend. They had a fixed menu but it had plenty of options! The lobster ravioli was to die for. My boyfriend enjoyed his surf and turf; however, he received a small piece of turf compared to the tables around us. I enjoyed my rack of lamb. The sides on the plate were nothing to rave about. The desserts were great too! We got the red velvet crepe and chocolate gooey lava cake. Overall, great food and will definitely be back.
2019-01-29,5,Excellent food, setting, service, and drink!. Yes, I like the place!I don't live close, but have eaten here 4 times over the last 6 months. Each time I was impressed and wished I lived closer so I could come more often. Last night we had the Monday night Prime Rib special. It challenges the best steak houses and at a price you can live with.Great neighborhood place, with standards above the norm.
2019-01-27,3,Stopped by Court Street around 2:30 this afternoon for the delicious chili and a beer, but was told the kitchen only serves brunch items until 3. So I ordered what sounded like a gourmet egg sandwich on a croissant, but received what seemed like a Dunkin' Donuts' microwaved omelet on a roll (they were out of croissants). I like the place and wouldn't typically write a bad review, but the experience really ruined my day.
2018-12-21,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5. Bread was scrumptious with the tapenade adding a neat salty yet savory spread. Crab legs were phenomenally well seasoned as the rich brine of the crab really came out while none of the aroma was present. By itself the crab was great but the homemade mustard sauce made it even better! The creamy yet piquant sauce was a great addition to the crab. Wild boar sausage was true to its name combining the rich flavors of a pork and the gaminess of boar. Red pepper fettuccine had a perfect al dente bite and meshed well with the sauce. Warm brownie was moist with the vanilla ice cream adding a creamy coolness. The grand marnier sauce really made the finishing touch to this dessert with its subtle sweetness and fragrance of orange being a perfect complement to the chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely wonderful food!Service - 4/5. Professional and courteous.Value - 5/5. Court Street had one of the best restaurant week menus I have ever seen. Usually it is a few items that stick out for me in terms of desirability, uniqueness and value but Court Street's menu had me perplexed to pick which one of the great choices I'll have to settle for. All the wonderful choices and delicious food for $35 is an amazing deal. Great place to dine!Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-12-12,5,The bar has a feeling of old Hoboken, regulars that come.  A diverse group of people where it's still like family, literally feels like the show "Cheers."  (For you old people...)The dining room is very sophisticated and the food is extremely delicious and presented with a flair!  My favorite time to go is Lobster Night which is Wednesday nights!  It's such a great deal and the food stupendous!  You have to check out the place bc I can't describe how the bar and the dining area is so different from each other in a good way but the same menu is offered at the bar.  They did a great job with having two different but pleasant environments between the dining room and the bar area. The staff is also very professional and they can explain their food very well, how it's prepared, the source of ingredients, etc.  Definitely go check them out!  I'm almost scared to post this bc it's my little secret.  LOL
2018-11-08,5,Enjoyed a great Sunday brunch with the 3 egg omelet and Red Snappers(gin bloody marys), all at very reasonable prices.
2018-10-23,5,The quintessential great neighborhood restaurant, Court Street has been producing consistently terrific food each time I've been, and that's at least a dozen times over the last 5 years.  Everything on the menu is great, and they've got a good selection of very affordable wines by the glass and bottle to accompany your meal.  If you live in the area and have not been, make a point to do so asap - you will not be disappointed!
2018-10-14,2,My wife, daughter and son took me out for dinner for my birthday. The baked brie was delicious as well as the fried calamari. Was pretty excited to try the 20 oz rib eye since the apps were so good. I ordered the steak medium rare. We waited for our food a long time but didn't care because we were in no rush. The waitress was very nice and thanked us for being so patient. The food came out and after cutting into my steak saw it was well done. Sent it back the waitress was very apologetic and assured me that my steak would be top priority in the kitchen. When she brought out my second steak not only was it now rare to raw but my side changed from mashed to potatoes au gratin (probably got someone else's dish). Didn't want to make a fuss because I knew my kids were so amped up on this place but this steak also had A LOT of fat and gristle on it. I understand this is not a steakhouse but this place is not cheap and should have a cook who knows how to cook a steak medium rare. Everybody else at the table liked their meal but not anything over the top. There are lots of awesome restaurants in Hoboken but sorry to say I didn't enjoy this one.
2018-10-05,5,Came here the other night with my boyfriend.  We both ordered the burger and fries which were to die for.  Plus the waitress was so nice.Though the crowd isn't always that great.But good food drinks and service.  Would totally be back.
2018-09-30,5,Love this place! I came here for brunch with my bf. I ordered traditional benedict and it tasted so good with broccoli on side. They offer fresh fruit cup and soda bread, which I didnt expect. I think this gonna be my first option for breakfast/ brunch in the future.
2018-09-26,3,Came here during Hoboken's restaurant week. our reservations were for 7:30 but didn't get seated till about an hour later. We did the 3 course meal for 35$ per person. While I was looking through the menu the food is surprisingly affordable for such a nice place. There's a variety of entrees, appetizers and drinks and they even have specials throughout the week.My only thing with this place is that I wish the portions for the meal were bigger and that they scheduled the reservations a little better because having to wait over an hour for a table is too much. Side note: half the place is a casual bar and the other half has a table-clothes seating (where we sat for dinner) overlooking the cobblestone street. Parking can also be tricky!
2018-09-24,3,My party of five and I had dinner here during Hoboken's 2018 restaurant week. While our reservation was at 7:30 we weren't seated till 8:45. We all ordered off their 3 course present menu for $35 per person. My meal included the Beef Carpaccio appetizer, Shrimp and Lobster over Linguine and warm sundae brownie. For the price, it was just ok. The portions were small and entree left much to be desired. I would consider coming back when the restaurant isn't as overpacked.
2018-09-14,4,Well established in Hoboken, Court Street restaurant is a pleasure to eat at.  The front area has a dark wooden bar and bar table seating where I have had brunch numerous times.  Brunch includes complimentary soda bread and fruit which is nice, and the eggs Benedict is nicely done. It comes with a healthy side of broccoli as well as home fries.  Service is friendly and courteous.  The back has table-clothed seating and can be a space either for brunch, romantic dinners or a group gathering.  I've come two years now for the lobster specials they run Saturday nights in the summer, where you get a 1 1/4 lb lobster with your choice of sides for around $23.  The menu is generally a good value for the money and I plan to come back to try other entrees and steak.
2018-07-31,4,We made reservations for 730 but didn't get seated for an hour but once we sat down they were quick to get our drink orders. The food was good I always have trouble eating out because I have a dairy allergy but they were very accommodating. All in all it was a good experience. The restaurant was cozy and had a good ambiance. I would go back but maybe for just appetizers and drinks since it took a while to get seated and to get our orders in.
2018-07-15,5,One of our favorites places to eat in Hoboken. Friendly service great menu. We go for brunch and dinner . Oysters Rockefeller is absolutely delicious . Dinner specials are always a good choice and variety. Lots of flavor and best veggies sides!
2018-07-05,3,This is a place I wouldnt normally think of going to but decided to try. They have a bar area in the front with a couple tvs and a dining room in the back. The dining room is nothing fancy and maybe needs to be spruced up a little bit since it looks a touch outdated. The menu is insanely big with so many options. That always scares me so I kept it simple and went for the burger. It was not very juicy and cooked a little too much for my order (medium).  The highlight of the burger was the french fries. They tasted homemade and were very good. I couldnt stop eating them. For drinks, the dirty martini was made pretty well but if I was nitpicking I would say they needed a little more vermouth to round out the kick of the vodka. We also tried the brie stuffed puff pastry that I would probably skip if I can do it over again. Court street is exactly what you would expect walking in. It is a solid 3 star place. Nothing is going to wow you but you will have a decent experience. Im not dying to come back but maybe in a year or so I will come back.
2018-06-26,5,I love love LOVE Court Street!! I wish I could give it more stars. Food it really good but sometimes portions can be kinda big. I'm personally a really big fan of their beet purée that comes as a side in a number of dishes. The olive spread that comes with bread (lol that rhymes) is exceptional. Service is really good too.
2018-06-19,5,A number of people had recommended court street restaurant to me. I'm very pleased with my visit there. Very cute spot. The food was on point. The wait staff was very attentive. It was Father's Day and they were very good to my dad. The highlights of the meal were the lamb, the crab cakes , the pork with risotto and the Cheesecake.  Would most certainly go back.
2018-06-13,5,This is my favorite restaurant in Hoboken. I have been several times, had a different plate each time and always been super happy with it. Seafood, steak, pasta etc, all delicious. They have some pretty good weekday specials too.
2018-06-10,5,Five stars every time. The food is amazing, the prices are great, and the service is exceptional! I love how you get a view looking onto the cobble stone street. Such a good spot for a date night
2018-04-20,5,Excellent food, service, and ambience. My favorite restaurant ever!
2018-03-31,5,I am always happily surprised when I eat at Court Street. It is unassuming.  When you walk in, you feel transported back in time with the beautiful window view looking onto the cobble stone street.  The atmosphere is very homey and enjoyable.  The service is great.Their Sunday brunch is fantastic.  They give you Irish Soda Bread and fresh fruit to start.  They have delicious brunch drink specials, I recommend the Peach Bellini. The burgers are cooked perfectly, they impressed my parents which is  hard to do.  Love their chicken sandwich as well and the bread makes the sandwich.Their dinners are delicious as well.  Great comfort food, cannot go wrong with anything.  I especially like the shrimp and pasta in a white wine cream sauce.The price is great and the service is always impeccable.
2018-03-27,4,One of the best and classy restaurants in Hoboken, which is not Italian. A business partner recommended to try the Monday night prime rib which we did besides some soup, chicken parmigiana and seafood pasta. All good and accompanied by 2 good bottles or red wine. Their wine list is not expensive and was awarded by wine spectator! We'll be back soon for some other specials and good times
2018-03-24,1,The food was okay, the service was so disappointing. I understand the waiters and waitress are usually busy on Friday night, but at least be patient. They kept walking around but never stoped to service you. It was my mom's birthday, we asked for one waiter's favor to take family photos for us. He showed impatience, and took blurred photos! They don't respect their job, or I guess they hate their boss. I paid 17.5% tips out of courtesy.
2018-03-02,5,The "hidden gem" of Hoboken!  My fiancee and I only go to Court Street on a routine basis compared to all other restaurants in Hoboken. Lot of other good spots in the Boke, but Court Street is such a comfortable setting, fantastic food, and great service.
2018-01-27,4,Oldie but a goodie.  French onion soup? Check.  Calamari? Check.  Swordfish? Check.  Linguini with garlic? Check check and double check.  Service was great (Joanna) and the menu isn't over priced.  I'm going back more often.
2018-01-20,3,The small Dining area is reached by walking through an Irish pub style bar. Service was friendly ( servers host and bar ) however the food is mediocre at best. Bland and def nothing for the new age foodies. The vegetable medley was something my grandma would enjoy. The menu is too extensive and dishes/ plating are dated. Food Seems like something out of a diner.
2018-01-12,5,Totally delicious. I highly recommend the lobster and shrimp over angel hair. It came in a creamy seafood sauce that was beyond amazing, just out of this world. The prime rib was also to die for. The french onion soup appetizer was incredible as well, very beefy, salty and cheesy; I could eat 10 more. The best part... it was very reasonably priced. We will definitely be back soon!
2017-11-26,3,A nice enough place, with reasonably priced dinners and solid service. However, the food is very average. It's essentially what you would expect at a diner.
2017-11-18,5,Really nice brunch. Welcoming, classy atmosphere. Broad menu and nice little complimentary fruit bowls. Server was good. I ordered a customized omelette and corn beef hash. Did not try the drinks. Will be back next time I'm in town!
2017-11-12,4,This is a nice place in Hoboken. The servers are great and friendly.We ordered -Crab meat stuffed mushroom - 4/5Salmon - 4/5The complimentary breads were also very fresh.Overall a good experience !
2017-11-06,4,this is solid go to if youre looking for a delicious dinner in hoboken. great for anyone-friends, parents, out of town guest or significant other. the space is intimate with a large wood bar in the front area, with a candle lit and white tableclothed tables in the back for larger groups.they have an extensive wine selection that is constantly rotating. came here last friday and they actually had a few bottles on special, we enjoyed a delicious bottle of red for $22.  there is always an extensive specials menu, i usually order from there. the everyday menu highlights more of what you could call "safe bets". steak, burgers, lobster,crab cakes, pastas and vegetarian options. the highlight from this menu definitely is the beef burgundy. so homey and satisfying- perfect cold weather dinner!highlights here for me have been their fish preparations and their take on veal scallopini (one of the specials). service is always friendly and attentive. and they bring you complimentary bread galore!
2017-11-03,5,Court Street is our go-to place for milestones, family events, and special occasions and even a New Years Eve dinner. What can I say? It's a lively bar up front, and an elegant, quiet dining room in the back. The service is perfect, the food is creative, the wine list is well thought out, varied and there's a wine for every price range. We did the fixed price for the first time last night - for $21.95, there were ~5 appetizers, 8+ entrees and 5 desserts. We love this place - can you tell?
2017-10-15,3,Sunday brunch. Seems like a local hang with very nice mixed age etc. crowd. Eggs Benedict would have gotten better marks if eggs were fresh (flat poached eggs!) and potatoes were not grease blobs. Included fruit salad was sad and tired. Irish Soda bread was a bit dry but tasty with butter. Broccoli was crisp and garlicky. Just hold the grease, please and you'd get another star! Drinks are cheap but you get what you pay for. Bar is comfy; back dining room looks nice. Adequate but with possibilities to improve! I wanted to like this place.
2017-10-14,5,This place is such an amazing gem! What I love about the space is that you can keep it low key and sit at the bar area or you can go into the dining room for date night. I came here twice already. First time it was in a Sunday and sat at the bar since there was a football game going on. Had a as an appetizer the crab cake and the portobello mushroom with broccoli rabe out of the specials for the night. The crab cake was Amazing and was the reason I wanted to go back so bad (well at least one of the reasons) for entree my husband had the rabbit and I had the shrimp and lobster in vodka sauce over linguini. Both so delicious and so fresh. It was literally a work of art ! For desert I had a pumpkin chocolate pie with coffee. The coffee was also great and that pie was divine ( another one of my reasons for going back!) 2nd time around went into the dining area on a Saturday and had as an appetizer the baked Brie and calamari. Calamari was so fresh and not fishy at all (which is a great sign) the breading was so light. That Brie was also something out of this world. Entree had fish and chips and my husband had some coq au vin. Needless to say we were not disappointed. Followed by another cup of coffee and a peanut butter chocolate pie ( the pumpkin wasn't served on that night) Definitely, a place to go and try! Worth every cent! Also, check out the specials in advance online. They also have different specials during the week and even a lobster specials on Saturday!!!
2017-10-01,5,One of Hobokens hidden gems. Front bar service is quick and attentive and truly has that neighborhood feel. Its the restaurant in back that truly excels with its exceptional classic american menu. Our party of 22 (yes 22 adults and 5 kids) were treated like VIPs. Have confidence that the menu has something for everyone. Our specials included steak, pasta, veal, duck, fish. Everything clearly prepared from scratch with the freshest ingredients. Thank you to Kevin, Arthur and Dan for a memorable night.
2017-09-30,5,Equal parts bar and restaurant. The menu was overwhelming large- great selection of food and drinks. Very impressed with my meal. The server was very knowledgeable about all the dishes.
2017-09-25,2,I've been meaning to come to Court Street for awhile now and I had the chance to with my friends on Sunday. To preface my review, we sat in the area because we were watching the football games. It was pretty packed but we didn't have to wait. The service was not great to be honest -- our server wasn't rude, but she not friendly either. Almost seemed annoyed that we were there. I ordered  the GRILLED PORTOBELLO SANDWICH. It was bland, even with onions and red peppers. My friends got some wings and a salad, which they said was pretty good. They have a separate bar menu and some specials for NFL Sundays if you're into that. I'll definitely update my review when I come back for a proper dinner -- I definitely want to try their lobster fest and other seafood dishes.
2017-09-11,5,Can't rave about this place enough. This place is welcoming, warm, and cozy. It's a great spot for a romantic fall dinner or even a casual dinner with friends or just grabbing a beer. The menu has something for everyone. I got a delicious veal scallopini and my boyfriend got the linguine with grilled chicken. The food was cooked perfectly. We were licking our plates clean. Highly recommend this place
2017-08-12,4,Went here for dinner with my boyfriend after a friend's recommendation.  Solid options and the waitress was very helpful guiding us through the options and helping us pick our entrees.  We had lamb and steak both of which were cooked very well.  What I found odd was that the wait staff was not in uniform.
2017-07-30,5,This is a place you can always rely on for a relaxed meal with a nice glass of wine. Friendly staff and a surprisingly extensive wine list considering the reasonable prices of the entrees.
2017-07-27,5,Our first time here and The lamb and lobster were amazing! High priced items you hope won't disappoint, and they didn't! Even though the staff seems to work together to make a good experience, Juan was very helpful and polite when answering questions. He didn't make me feel like I was putting him out. Will be back for sure!!!
2017-07-26,4,Came here for dinner with my wife and enjoyed the overall experience. We had the following meal:- 1/2 Dozen Oysters on the Half Shell - fresh, tasty, and sizeable- Seafood Pasta - Shrimp, Sea Scallops, Clams and Mussels over Linguine with Fresh Tomatoes, Garlic and Olive Oil - delicious! highly recommend. Fantastic mix of flavors and seafood. I'll be back for seconds once beach season is over- New England Crabcakes - made with Jumbo Lump Crabmeat, lightly sauteed - another fantastic dish. They do an awesome job of sourcing fresh, meaty seafood ingredients and it shows.A bit pricey so overall value is not fantastic but right on par for what you'd expect - thus the 4 star rating. Not worth making the trip from NYC just for dinner but if you're a Hoboken resident, it's a must try location.Tip: Lobster fest is every Wednesday & Saturday nights.1 1/4 lb Maine Lobster with Soup or Salad, Potato and Vegetable all for $21.95.
2017-07-13,3,From the outside looking in, Court Street looks like a regular bar. However, if you venture in past the bar, you'll see that they actually have a proper dining room in the back. I came in with my boyfriend and his parents on a Thursday at around 8, and it wasn't too packed.To start, we had the brie baked in a puff pastry, and the calamari. Both were great. The brie was nice and melty inside the perfectly toasted pastry. The calamari was extra crispy, without being or tasting too oily. As for the entrees, these were a bit lackluster. I had the penne with wweet Italian sausage. It was pretty basic - nothing I couldn't make at home. Unlike the appetizers, this on the other hand, was a bit too oily. But it might be from the sausage, which they did give a pretty generous portion of, so can't really complain about that. The prices have a pretty huge range. Some dishes are pretty reasonably priced (like my pasta dish, which was $13), but others seem to be expensive for no reason (like crab cakes for $24). Not sure I would be back for a whole meal, but I don't mind stopping by for some appetizers.
2017-07-06,5,Hands down the best food in Hoboken. They have a huge menu of delicious specials every day and great wines as well. Their menu always has items you wouldn't normally order- and usually plenty of seafood. My family comes from Staten Island just to eat here for dinner. Also, $1 oysters on (I think, Thursdays) are a great deal! I've also been here for their monthly wine tasting and it was a great experience.
2017-06-18,4,They have a bar area and also a dining area, which is much more quiet and intimate. The service was really quick and the waitresses were kind. The appetizers, I noticed came out extremely fast and the entrees took a little longer. The prices for seafood is very good. Stuffed Avocado with Lump Crab Meat ($11.95)- 5/5 This was part of the special of the day, and oh my goodness. This was so amazing, everything on the dish was so fresh and delicious. The tomatoes were juicy. When you mix everything together with a little onion and capers, it's the best combo. Sautéed Monkfish ($18.95)- 4/5 The monkfish itself didn't have much flavor to it but the mushrooms were very flavorful with the Marsala wine sauce and shallots. This came with a side and I chose waffle fries- the portion size was quite big and yummy.
2017-04-15,5,Fantastic meal with friends tonight for A birthday. We make a special trip to Hoboken to enjoy the fine dining and service at Court Street. Loved the bacon wrapped scallops and spinach fettuccine tonight. The venison special was excellent. Yum. Always a special place.
2017-04-09,5,Arthur makes the best bloody Mary's in town. Nice place, moderately priced and great food. This is a great place for Sunday Brunch!
2017-04-02,5,Still a wonderful place to eat and drink. Always great music. Always. Fresh salads and main courses delish deserts. We love it here. Perfect service. Big fanps. One thing that needs improving: they do not have wireless internet for the guests and anyone with a child knows this is important :D
2017-03-19,4,One of my favorite places to go for brunch and dinner with my husband. Today we went for brunch and we got: the poinsettia (a mimosa with cranberry juice instead of OJ) and it was delicious and refreshing! For brunch they also give you complimentary Irish Soda bread and fruit.   For my main dish I got the penne vodka with shrimp  and it was really good --- a bit more cream based than I am used too but still excellent.  My husband got the steak sandwich and he liked it as well!  Never can go wrong with this spot
2017-02-26,4,Solid and reasonably priced brunch placed in the middle of Hoboken. I've been before for dinner and to grab drinks but not for brunch. Brunch is what they do best w/o a doubt. Excellent drink menu including pitchers of Bloody Mary's or Mimosas for $12.  Attentive service, good ambiance, and a wide menu will welcome you. They do a brisk business but didn't seem to mind my friend and I sitting for a bit after we paid to catch up. I ordered the Eggs Florentine Benedict ($11) which was delicious. They do a great poached egg and I was really glad I ordered them as the eggs were cooked well and ran the just right amount when I cut into them. My friend got 3 eggs any way and also got the poached eggs so highly recommended. It also came w/some broccoli and home fries on the side though the home fries were a bit too greasy and crispy for my taste. All entrees also come with fresh fruit and soda bread which were good. A ton of food for $11.
2017-01-24,4,What can I say about Court Street it's the damn place in Hoboken with the best damn corn beef hash in town period. Also the best damn mimosas, don't even bother getting a glass get a pitcher with a straw. Matter fact, get two pitchers with a straw. Now food wise, i think I've had just about everything there. The crab cakes, the pastas, the steak and eggs, all awesome. Monday is prime rib night. Do yourself a favor and show up here and dominate as the maldonator does on a constant basis. Best brunch for groups too. I'll add to this review later I'm hungry and I'm going to court street.
2016-12-13,5,Love this place - a go to for me. nice but not stuffy. Food is amazing!
2016-11-30,4,I've been to Court Street numerous times & never been disappointed. It may not rival many of the newer, 'hip' places, but there's something solid about this establishment that serves good food and substantial portions. Brunch - the muffin basket is on the house and delicious. The waffles and pancakes and omelettes are all excellent. Drinks:  Great happy hour, pair it with the calamari and even the soup of the day on a cold winter evening  and you're all set. They serve bread and butter and an olive tapenade on the house as well. Dinner: My favorite part. They have some mean seafood specials. I recently had the Cajun Halibut and my friend got the Perch with a mild Mediterranean risotto and I can't stress how well done both the dishes were.  The Halibut had a slightly sweet and spicy rub and the Perch was succulent with a melt-in-the-mouth texture.  Delicious. PRO Tip: get their Prixe Fix dinner menu from 4-6 pm for $21.95 for 3 courses (excludes many of the daily sea food specials though)Service has always been warm and efficient.
2016-11-23,5,Court Street never lets me down. Love the wild game and seafood specials and the staff is second to none.
2016-10-03,1,Ordered takeout. Was the worst veal dish ever. Absolutely no flavor. Chick parm was also flavorless and had hardly any gravy on the platter. I guess they ran out and forgot to tell us. We ate here before in the restaurant and the food was not good that time either. Decided to give it one more try, well this will be the last. Such a waste of money.
2016-09-25,1,Had a terrible experience at brunch today. We arrived with a group of 7 people. When the food came out, they said they ran out of cream cheese for my bagel and lox and gave someone else at my table raw pancakes. Our waitress (the manager) was very rude and was not looking to accommodate us in any way. After multiple negotiations, she took drinks off the bill, but was not happy about doing so. In the end the two of us were not able to eat here with everyone and could not enjoy our family lunch. One of the worst dining experiences I've had!
2016-09-20,5,I had a business dinner at Court Street with a dozen colleagues, and we had a wonderful time.  The staff made everything run smoothly for this large group.  The ambience was very welcoming and not too loud for conversation.  Everyone enjoyed their delicious dinners, and the service was excellent.  I had a wonderful scallops dish and loved the gooey cake (It even topped their signature profiteroles)!  Yum!  A must-see stop....
2016-09-08,4,While the food wasn't AMAZING - it was tasty. I guess I'm spoiled from NYC standards (yeah yeah we're snobs) however I had a really pleasant experience. The service was good. I was a solo diner and felt like I was taken care of, dare i say it, even better than in NYC. Sometimes, dining alone can be daunting because you sort of get lost in the background but I felt the exact opposite here. They were very warm and welcoming and patient with my indecisiveness. I had the beef carpaccio special which was a generous portion for an appetizer and nicely executed. I think my favorite part was that they gave me tapenade with bread to start. It was a nice touch and helped me pass on the butter. I left it untouched - I don't need more butter in my life but that tapenade though!
2016-08-22,4,We came in for restaurant week and ended up ordering off the regular menu. We had to wait a bit for our table, so we waited at the bar and had a round of drinks. We had to close out our tab at the bar to move to our table, which I guess makes sense.  They brought us lots of bread, as the kitchen seemed a bit backed up, and were very attentive. The food we ordered was really good - I got veal, and they subbed in pasta for potatoes for me. Other people got steak and lobster. Everyone seemed really pleased. We didn't try the dessert menu. This place seems really nice and I would come back or recommend it to out-of-town visitors, since the menu is broad and has something for everyone.
2016-08-21,5,Come here for Wednesday lobster night -- it's a great deal!  But also come on the weekend for brunch. While there are no bottomless drinks, that is actually a positive, because it keeps that kind of crowd away!  Every brunch entree I have tried is delicious.  They also serve a small fruit salad and Irish soda bread before your meal arrives.
2016-08-17,2,I'm rating them as a restaurant, cause that's how I experienced it, the bar may be ok. I went in on Monday night, to try the Monday Special Prime Rib - extremely bad food, run away from this people. They offered something they refer to as "soup" as part of the deal and brought "something something avocado soup" - it tasted like some diluted ridiculous avocado guacamole squash and nothing like soup - in any case ridiculously bad. The meat was a joke, looked bad and tasted bad, wouldn't be surprised if they made it from frozen but not sure about that. I can't speak to other items on the menu cause we all ate this special, but I will surely never go back there. It came recommended by someone who lives locally, so I guess there are some people who may like this - I know tastes are different but I trust mine!
2016-07-29,4,Came here for restaurant week in Hoboken. This place might quickly become one of my new favorite restaurants in the area. We got the crab cake and French onion soup for an appetizer. For dinner we had the sword fish steak and veal with egg noodles. For desert we had warm brownie with ice cream and almond joy sorbet. Everything was delicious. My only complaint was the sword fish was a little more charred than I would've liked but it was still very good. My girlfriend and I agreed we would come back just for the desert as it was the eat part of the meal. On top of delicious food the service was fantastic. I am looking forward to visiting again very soon.
2016-07-15,4,I really liked this restaurant we went here on Thursday for dollar oysters. I don't like oysters so I ordered pasta with tomato creme sauce with basil and chicken it was delicious and flavorful!! I also loved the pear and avocado salad special!! My mom got the pasta with sausage and really enjoyed it too!! We had good service and the dishes were delicious, would definitely come back!!
2016-06-30,4,I've ended up drinking at Court Street a fair amount of times since leaving Hoboken, but honestly can't recall the last time I ate there - but whatever the feeding hiatus was, it ended this Sunday when I met up with some friends for brunch here.the Sunday brunch menu is killer: 2 pages with options for everyone and all tastes, far beyond just the standard omelets and eggs benedict. they start you off with some really good Irish soda bread and a cup of fresh fruit.I kicked it into high gear with a mug of coffee (not bad) and a (really potent) Bloody Mary. both were necessary after a long night of bar-hopping.as for my meal; Grand Marnier French toast with a side of corned beef hash. French toast was good, but what i liked about the hash was that it was real shredded corned beef, clearly not the canned stuff that has an odd texture to it (does that stop me from eating it? no, but I'm just making a comment). for an extra dollar you can get Vermont maple syrup, which is a great bonus. live it up, homeslice.service is still great and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. the front pub area is still a great place to hang out and watch some sports games and sip some good beers, while the back dining area is a little more upscale.okay, clarification on that last point: upscale enough that a large group of basic white girls in sundresses can occupy a big table for brunch, but still casual enough that I can wear a metal band t-shirt and faded jeans at the table across from them. that's how I roll.
2016-06-21,1,I've been coming here for the past few years. I love the ambiance, yet there was always something that wasnt quite right depending on what I ordered. Last weekend I finally figured it out... They MICROWAVE some of their entrees!! I ordered the Monkfish and it was served ridiculously hot. The only way food can get that hot is in a microwave.  Sure enough, after about 15 mins the fish became hard as a rock! There is no excuse to charge the kind of prices they do for microwaved food. Actually, there is no excuse for any restaurant to be microwaving fish. I am thoroughly disappointed. I won't be going back!
2016-06-05,2,We went there for the first time today to have brunch. The ambiance was nice and the service was fine. However, I ordered my eggs over-easy and the yolks were as hard as rocks (the rest of the meal was fine.) When a kitchen cannot prepare a brunch staple properly and with so many other places around where they are prepared properly, we see no reason to dine here again.
2016-05-26,4,My boyfriend and I heard about lobster Wednesday's here, so we decided to head over late one Wednesday evening. We were seated quickly at the bar and greeted nicely by a gentleman behind the bar. We ultimately knew we only wanted to try the lobsters so we ordered right away. We didn't need to wait much, plus it was nice we recorded a basket of bread, butter and olive tapenade. Unfortunately the bread was really crunchy so we didn't bother to eat much of that. The meal comes with a house salad, which I didn't care too much for. A side of baked potato, mashed beets and veggies, which I enjoyed. The lobsters came out pre cracked but still in tact, butter on the side. It was pretty good, and you really can't complain because it's only $20 for all of that! It's an affordable means to having a nice seafood meal - highly recommend and will be coming back to try out their other menu items!
2016-05-03,5,Their food is excellent and the atmosphere is great! Must try the shrimp Parmesan. Prices are expected for this type of food in Hoboken. Small restaurant, but would definitely recommend waiting for a table in the dining room.
2016-04-25,3,Court Street is a regular place for me and my wife. Great beers and a good menu. My only issue is that it feels as if it has a split personality; the bar area is great, but the more formal dining area in the rear feels like a different place -- the sort of decor and feel you might find in the suburbs. But maybe that's just me. Either way, it's a cozy place that should be on your shortlist if you live in town.
2016-04-21,5,A family reunion of sorts, scotland, california (japan), florida and hoboken all represented. Reservations for 6 made, oh and no credit card required for it (prior review...pfffftttt ). We were seated right away, a pleasant waiter, stopped and took our drink orders, wine and beer. Nice selection of both. We chatted, and weren't rushed. Eventually orders placed, oh it was lobster fest night. 1 1/4 whole with sides for 20...reasonable I thought. A couple more lobsters, steak, fish and pasta were plated for us. All looked yummy. No complaints were filed. I had au gratin, zucchini and pureed beets, excellent. Shells were cracked legs flying, was very good. Properly prepared. All the plates were cleaned. And now dessert...I shared a blueberry ala mode...not...lol. Other stuff was good to, flan and ice cream puff...oh boy. I'm done.
2016-04-20,3,I have had dinner here several times and stopped in for drinks once. As for their food I have had the chicken parm and the bone-in pork chop. Both of my entrees were decent but frankly not amazing. When I stopped in for drinks at the bar I was a little disappointed by the selection. I was in the mood for hard cider and the only option was some bottled organic stuff which ended up costing way too much.
2016-04-20,5,Court Street may be one of Hoboken's finest establishments. Brunch is amazing! From pitchers of mimosas to Irish soda bread to an assortment of menu items that please everyone. Dinner is equally as fantastic! Appetizers and entrees are served in a beautiful presentation. Nightly specials are seasonal and well priced. Desserts are outstanding! The staff is always friendly and accommodating. This past weekend, my girlfriends and I attended a wine tasting. This was a delightful experience from start to finish. Once the two hours were over, the remainder of the wines were poured for us while the staff transformed the dining room for dinner service. We went back for dinner later in the evening and enjoyed every minute of our experience. It's a very special place with a warm and inviting ambiance. I would recommend Court Street to locals and guests, there's something for everyone. You will feel comfortable and leave happy and full.
2016-04-19,1,I don't know who these people are. I made a reservation for 5 people. I got a call back saying that they needed a credit card. What? This is a Hoboken restaurant, not Per Se in Manhattan. I will never go there and I will tell all of my friends in Hoboken and New York to never go there. What a stupid policy! Credit card for a dinky Hoboken restaurant???? Unbelievable, rude and ridiculous.
2016-04-03,5,Absolutely perfect- had eggs Benedict and my wife had French toast. One of the best places in Hoboken...
2016-03-30,4,I've only been here for Sunday brunch, but it's the best I've had in town. Love the Irish soda bread, and the corned beef hash (much better than the cube shaped stuff you get in cans, more like a brisket). Good service.Decent value too, compared to its nice restaurant brunch competition. (I'm excluding Stacks, which is much more on the value side of the spectrum, but no atmosphere.)
2016-03-24,3,A few weeks back a friend and I were pacing up and down Washington street trying to find a restaurant that would seat us in time to make a movie afterward.After much frustration we found ourselves at court street, after checking Yelp I had the idea that it would be a bar like setting, good because I'm not dressed up.Apparently this wasn't the case, instead we were seated in a entirely full dining room with candles on each table, it was insanely awkward as I had not intended to dine in a restaurant so fancy.Long story short, we were seated in the far back corner as if we were too unsightly for anywhere else.Enough negativity, the food was actually pretty decent. I ordered chicken parm, about 17 bucks or so. The chicken was very good, the pasta and sauce were okay.Overall the food was good, but the atmosphere was dreadful, I don't see how they have a sports bar like image from the window, only to reveal a fancy dining room 10 feet from the bar. I'd probably rethink that strategy personally....
2016-03-21,4,Looks like a dive bar from the outside, has a nice restaurant inside in the back. Very nice atmosphere. Menu had lots of seafood, as well as chicken and pasta dishes - pretty diverse. Definitely good for couples or small parties, would not recommend for large groups because of the space size and atmosphere. Prices were middle of the pack for dinner. I would go back.
2016-03-14,5,The prime rib they have on Monday nights is phenomenal. Oysters were great and they have Allagash on tap. Kinda wish the dining room was a little bigger but this place has an excellent menu; hidden gem!!!
2016-02-27,2,Decided to try this place based on having passed by many times and seeing it busy with well-dressed (presumably discerning) clientele of a certain age.When two colleagues from out of town wanted to go to dinner I suggested it.  What a disappointment.  From the moment we walked in and the underwhelming reception (it was 6.30 on a Monday, most tables were free, we were seen but left waiting five minutes until the guy who would be our waiter seated us), to the unhelpful and mumbling replies to any menu question, to the super-sweet house "Chardonnay" (desert wine more like) and the very average tasting entrees (one of our party had what was billed as the best burger in Hoboken - he liked bare burger better the following evening, my salmon was meh although the side of potatoes lyonnais was very good) we felt treated shabbily by the wait staff and the food was average at best while my wine was plain awful. Will not return.
2016-02-13,2,Brunch for me, my wife and my young toddler (who was sleeping).  The host saw our toddler sleeping in our stroller to which they said "you can put her in a high chair"...uh yeah great idea, wake a sleeping toddler.  We ended up sitting at a tall bar table with our toddler in the stroller next to us.Took a few minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us, the host just stared at us.   Our waitress was less than friendly when she came over, nor was willing to give suggestions and looked generally irritated.We ordered a *pitcher* of Bloody Mary for $12 (I figured good deal bc a pint was 6)... Wrong the pitcher was not the type of pitcher you expect,it was prob 2 pints less the ice.  Bloody Mary was just ok.We ordered some burgers and French toast for our daughter.   I had to ask for my coffee 3x before I got it... Burgers were ok - nothing special (bare burger way better), the kitchen forgot the bacon tho so I asked for a side.    it came 5 minutes later and was way over cooked it just simply crumbled.Bill came, charged me twice for one of our orders, but waitress fixed the bill.    We boxed our toddler's French toast *with the syrup* (like the ones you get at McDonald's in little single serve plastic container).     Got home went to feed our toddler they didn't pack the syrup we put on the plate next to the French toast.  Weird, probably re entered the rotation... Lol, decided at that point to Yelp this place.All in all, first and last time to this place.   Food was average at best, service subpar.   Cost a little high but not outrageous... It didn't align to the quality or service though.Suggestion/recommendation: go to another bar grill, you'll prob be better off.
2016-02-11,4,I've been here a few times since moving to Hoboken.  They have a very large menu, many options ranging from burgers, salads, steak, burgers and pasta dishes.  Always a large list of nightly specials, though not sure how frequently it changes.  I've had the lamb chops and the cod Vera Cruz, both were good, plentiful portions offered with potatoes and vegetables.  Food is reasonably priced.  They offer a prime Rib special one night per week and a lobster fest special as well, both are great deals.  A little strange to walk in and have it feel like a bar but white table clothes in the back room.  Overall, decent food, large menu and decent service. A good alternative if it sure what to eat.
2016-02-02,4,Great local restaurant in Hoboken, I've been here numerous times for both brunch and dinner. I always have a great experience and the food is delicious. Their menu is large and has many options, the specials are always great, and the prices are decent. This is a "go-to" when my boyfriend and I want to go out for a good meal.
2016-01-21,4,This place is very cozy & I loved the overall feel of it. I really liked the olive tapenade that came with the bread - nice touch! I got the Veal Piccata, while my boyfriend ordered a steak. We were both obsessed with our dishes! The service is great too, would definitely come back here!
2016-01-03,1,A friend and I wanted to try something new in Hoboken which we try to do as much as possible. This place was a total let down. Walked in on a Sunday, waited about five minutes before we realized no one was going to say anything. We walked to the back to find a waitress that finally said "two for brunch?" we said yes and got seated. We quickly received water and fresh fruit cups which were great but that's where it ended. Our waitress walked up about 15 minutes later and said "all set to order?". Glad we didn't want anything other than water, but it would have been nice if we were asked. Ordered our food, waitress wasn't helpful at all, simply had a terrible attitude the entire time. Food came about 15 minutes later (normal). My friend ordered a Taylor Ham egg and cheese sandwich with home fries: ham burnt and had the consistency of a potato chip. I got the huevos rancheros, nothing special. Never got a water refill, never was checked on. Overall, a pretty terrible experience both food and service wise. Probably won't come back.
2015-12-12,5,Court Street is a gem of a restaurant tucked away on a quiet block in Hoboken.  I've lived in Hoboken for 10 years now and this is my absolute favorite place.  The staff is professional and attentive with very low turnover.  Many of the service staff have been there for years which is rare in the restaurant/ bar industry and says a lot about what a quality restaurant this is and what wonderful ownership it has.  I have been to Boston many times over the years and this restaurant's menu is the closest I have come across in the area to having the type of comfort foods I love.  Check out the daily specials on their website and you'll be impressed.  Hands down the best chicken pot pie I have had anywhere and I've even been to the UK.  They don't have the chicken pot pie every week as it rotates on the daily specials menu. I'm a burger kind of guy and their burgers are far better than many burger specific places.  If your looking for lobster look no further than here. I only wish they added New England Clam Chowder and  Lobster Roll to their menu and then I would feel complete.  Great place for a quiet & cozy evening for couples and families.
2015-11-18,4,Seating took a while, so we sat at the bar.  Bar crowd was friendly, good vibe.  Waiter didn't know much about wine, not a huge deal.  But the tuna steak was panko encrusted, not my favorite (I prefer plain), should have known better.  But the place was nice overall, would visit again.
2015-11-16,4,I really like Court Street, as evidence by my "Duke" status lol, and not just because it is my local watering hole within spitting distance. They have great food, they are definitely a restaurant first and a bar second.  Lobster specials in season are not to be missed, their bread with olive tapenade is great, and all their entrees and salads are fresh and crisp and well put together.  Plus you can get a pint in a nice and relaxed bar atmosphere while you are grubbing, what more could you want?  The back area is quiet if you are looking to sit down and relax.  The only gripe is in the winter, they get really really cold, as the glass just isn't good enough at keeping that cold air out, so if you sit on the bar high tops, blast the little heater they put under there or bundle up to stay cozy.  The best thing about this place after the food is the clientele, as you don't get the bridge/tunnel crowd or the meathead crowd or the pubescent college crowd from the Path area bars, which is great.
2015-11-09,5,WOW, the veal strogenoff is to die for.  TENDER chunks of veal in a rich noodle blend.  Melts in the mouth.  You MUST try it.  AND it is VERY reasonably priced.  All in all a great restaurant.
2015-11-08,5,Unfortunately I don't dine here as much as I would like to, but when I do come to Court Street I always leave satisfied. The bar is great, the food is spectacular, and the specials definitely go above and beyond. I came here with my husband last night and we were told the wait would be 15 minutes. We didn't have a reservation and expected to wait for a seat, so we went to the bar and ordered a pitcher of sangria which was very good. We waited for all of five minutes before the hostess came by and said they were ready for us. I ordered the tricolor salad for an appetizer which was a special along with the rack of lamb. My husband had French onion soup and the filet mignon. Both dishes were very tasty. I can't comment on my husbands soup because he inhaled it before I could ask for a bite. Cozy atmosphere, great service, and a nice night out. Will definitely continue to dine here, hopefully more frequently in the future.
2015-10-25,2,Two and a half stars for the food, and that's it. They have a very nice brunch menu here, with a good mix of breakfast and lunch items. I had an omelette with bacon, cheddar, and broccoli which was delicious, and their home fries are also pretty good.Unfortunately, this was all accompanied by sloppy and inattentive service and weak drinks. Their pitcher of mimosa sounds like a nice deal, until it arrives watered  down, icy, and served in water glasses. I love a good mimosa, so this was pretty disappointing. I'd be willing to give this place another chance based on the quality of the food, but there are other places in Hoboken that offer a better overall brunch experience.
2015-10-25,3,This review is specifically for brunch. The food here is excellent. The Starving Hobokenite is a tour de force of brunch food, and everything in it was delicious. Their pancakes are fluffy and just the right size, and the sausage is quite good. Their omelettes are also very tasty. So why only three stars?The service and drinks left something to be desired. The service was rather slow, and my table was never served the fresh fruit or Irish soda bread that came with brunch (and that every other table received). I didn't care much about the lack of Irish soda bread, given all the other food I was having with my meal, but it was a bit strange that everyone else got bread and fruit, and we didn't. Though, honestly, not sure why they even serve Irish soda bread with brunch - it seems superfluous given all the pancakes/french toast/muffins/etc.My table also got a pitcher of mimosas, which was served with tons of ice in the pitcher. Who puts ice in a mimosa? Watered it down a ton, and given the amount of ice in the pitcher, we wound up not getting much of the actual drink. Great food, but needs improvement on some other items. Would definitely be willing to give it another shot (just wouldn't get a pitcher of one of their drinks again).
2015-10-05,2,Drinks are terrible, it tasted like the glass was not fully washed. Food is average. Not sure why the rate is high.
2015-09-01,4,I'm kicking myself in the butt for not taking the reviews more seriously and getting here sooner. This was one of the most pleasant dining experiences I've had in Hoboken and it certainly explains why the restaurant has been around for over 30 years. Wednesday and Saturday nights are home to Lobsterfest, which was great to find out as we stepped in on Saturday night. For $20 your meal comes with a soup or salad appetizer, a 1 1/4 lb. lobster with choice of potato and vegetables of the day. There are also 2+ lb lobsters available for #30-35. It's a great deal and I strongly recommend taking advantage! This is was my boyfriend ordered for a meal. I tacked on 1/2 dozen oysters for appetizer and had the Seafood Pasta as my entree. From start to finish, everything was executed perfectly. My pasta was delicious and I nearly licked the plate clean. For fresh seafood, the value can't be beat. Our waiter was attentive, friendly and playful. It was clear he knew what he was doing. If everything else on the menu is as good my first time here, I'll definitely be back to give it that extra star.
2015-08-29,5,Our neighborhood bar for the past three years. Jeff is the weeknight bartender and is amazing. For date night or a quick and easy dinner, it's an easygoing favorite for food, wine and a good night out. And they just replaced their trivia cards!!
2015-08-28,4,Better than average bar and restaurant.  Olive tapenade comes with the bread and it is salty savory glorious.  Entrees are on point and priced between mid teens and mid twenties.  Rotating craft beer list.  Friendly service.
2015-08-23,5,Awesome food and amazing service. Water was always topped off. Pitcher of mimosas great for sharing. Filled 4.5 cups per pitcher. Home fries were great with 3 eggs
2015-08-14,4,Went there in January according to my photos. Enjoyed the server. I had on a jets sweater and he brings two glasses of water for me and my boyfriend except mine had the jets logo on it. How thoughtful! He was very quick with getting our orders food and check which we appreciate being that we're from nyc. Got the seafood pasta I believe. Loaded with seafood from clams mussels scallops and shrimp. We also got the surf and turf with veggies potato and mashed beet.
2015-08-11,2,On our first night in Hoboken, we happened upon Court Street Restaurant while walking through the quaint neighborhood. From the outside, it looked cute and inviting.Don't get me wrong, the food was great, and there was a large selection both exquisite and simple. I had angel hair pasta with a light tomato sauce and basil- perfect for a summer night. However, the service was poor. Our condescending waiter seemed to be bothered by our questions and scoffed them off. I will not return or suggest this restaurant to others for that reason. The importance of service cannot be stressed enough.
2015-08-11,3,The food was pretty good, the service not so much. I'd go back, no doubt. The place has a nice vibe to it.
2015-08-02,3,Solid place for brunch, nothing fancy or exciting but fits the bill.We stopped by without a reservation for a Sunday brunch, and the place didn't seem particularly crowded when we got there. I split an order of the "Starving Hobokenite" and California Chicken sandwich (chicken, avocado on a croissant). There's nothing special about these dishes, but they were well prepared and tasty; the latter in particular went well with the garlic aioli, while the former was quite a bit of food. In general, it's decent value for brunch in the area, and the service and food are pretty solid. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but it's a good place for a brunch for smaller groups that won't break the bank.
2015-07-30,5,I really love the fresh bread they serve to guests for free. It's soooo delicious! My boyfriend and me really enjoyed it. They offer really authentic American brunch menu, I ordered an Egg Benedict, and my boyfriend ordered veggie omelet, which is really delicious. The environment is good for couples and friends. I will definitely go back again, and I strongly recommend this place.
2015-07-27,4,Decided to eat here while in Hoboken, as we had a hankering for some good Fish & Chips. This restaurant did not disappoint. We were seated in the dining room at the back which was a bit more formal than we expected, but we did not feel out of place even though we were dressed quite casually for the summer heat. Service was friendly and everything we ordered -the fish & chips, apps and the halibut special was delicious!
2015-07-07,1,Tried to eat here with my friends and we were turned away because someone in our group was wearing a sleeveless top. Granted I understand there are dress codes but the way it was handled left a bad taste in my mouth.The "hostess" said let me check to see if we have a table. Then went into the dining room where she met another woman who looked at my friend and from the look of her eyes we knew they were gonna say something, but then instead of saying something to us, made eye contact with another employee who gave my group the up down and then said something to the woman and she came over and told us we weren't dressed appropriately for their dining room. The first employee should have been aware of their dress code policy and should have just told us, it did not require so many disapproving looks. Truly disappointed in the level of service.Can't comment on the food because we were not given the opportunity to try it
2015-06-12,5,Local favorite of mine. Everything I've had has been great.  Phenomenal burger.
2015-06-05,4,Their dinner menu isn't anything that you can't get elsewhere in Hoboken, but this place has an awesome brunch and is one of my favorite spots around town overall. Great atmosphere, friendly servers and bartenders. Definitely a must try
2015-05-31,5,I can't have a meal here without getting the french onion soup.  It is definitely one of their best items!  I like to come here on Wednesdays (and now Saturdays during the summer!) for their lobster special, its a great deal!  This place is a little off Washington on 6th street so it is easy to miss.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food you are getting.  When you first enter its like a regular casual bar but the backroom is set up in a more formal way with tables with white tablecloths.  It would be an ideal place to take a date!
2015-05-15,5,I love court street!!! The food is delicious and the setting is nice but also very laid back and comfortable. Do yourself a favor and check  them out on Wednesday nights for their lobsterfest. $20 for a soup or salad, a veggie AND a potato, and 1 1/4 lobster. You can also upgrade to a larger lobster if you'd like. You really can't beat that deal. Their wine selection is great and includes a ton of very decently priced (and tasty!) bottles of wine. They also have a baked brie appetizer that is super delish! I've never had a bad experience here- whether I was enjoying a quiet date night with my boyfriend, a girls night with a few friends, or a nice dinner with my big, crazy family- we've always left completely satisfied.
2015-05-13,4,GREAT brunch spot.  Complimentary Irish soda bread (yum) and fruit salad.  Staff is super friendly and attentive, atmosphere is bright and extremely clean, food came out quick and was very good.  Great little spot.
2015-05-05,3,I only gave it 3 stars bc I honestly do love coming here, but had a big lesson learned tonight. First off my server sounded like he just smoked several joints, and had the surfer look. Probably one of the worst servers I have had waited on me in years.  He passed my table up along side the wall at the bar 4 times, 4 TIMES, before he even asked how everything was. My gf got some kind of mexican shrimp cocktail on the specials and tasted like tomato juice. We told him she didn't like it, and he said I'm sorry to hear that and walked away. I'll give it another try, but if he's my server I am asking for someone else.
2015-04-27,2,Stopped here for dinner during the week and noticed it was restaurant week so my date and I opted for the pre-fixe menu; she got a salad which was pretty good and I got a chorizo and shrimp dish which might as well have been just chorizo as there were only 4 pieces of shrimp compared to what seemed to be at least 4 links worth of chorizo...tasty overall.Next came out our main courses - she got a seafood dish which was so incredibly salty it was nearly inedible and I ordered the steak medium-rare which came out ice-cold - when I informed the waiter they took it back and came out a few minutes later - essentially it appeared as if they just threw the pieces back on the grill as it was now closer to medium well and very chewy.When there are dozens other options in Hoboken you wonder if they just were having an off night or if the food is usually like this.The saving grace was the wine here - the wine was very very good and we will give it another shot but only come for wine and the ambiance - we will probably skip out on the dinner menu though.
2015-04-23,4,Such a cute little spot off of Washington.I came here for brunch with the girls one Sunday and we got seated right away.We ordered a round of cocktails - mimosas, a screw driver, and an Irish coffee.I then got the "Starving Hobokenite" despite not being starving. I got corned beef hash, 3 eggs over easy, home fries, and three buttermilk pancakes.  I almost finished the entire thing because it was so good! The pancakes were light and fluffy and so delicious. The corned beef was more shredded corned beef than a typical looking hash but it was tasty. The eggs were cooked nicely and the home fries were seasoned perfectly. Will definitely be back for brunch, and also can't wait to try the Prime Rib night and Lobsterfest promotions!
2015-04-22,4,This is a great place for a nice dining experience. It is a little small but the staff is accommodating. Good drinks and fresh food
2015-03-22,4,I haven't been here in quite awhile but went here for lunch with a friend and it was great! I had the daily quiche which was broccoli and cheddar - really not something I would typically order but the server said it was really good, and it did not disappoint, it was probably the best quiche I've ever had! I highly recommend it! I also go a side of the corned beef hash and it was also super good! I really could not ask for more out of a brunch. Very solid. The only thing I think could use a little improvement is the bread basket (super super dry) and the bloody Mary picture, it tasted really watery :/  neither were horrible but I would say sub par. I will definitely be coming again for brunch very soon!!
2015-03-16,5,We love their Monday night prime rib special. The prime rib is large and delicious. It is consistently good. The price is very reasonable and the service is very good. My only complaint is the fish and chips. I had it twice and both time it wasn't what I expected for fish and chips. I will definitely continue to patronize this restaurant.
2015-03-14,5,This is one of my "Ol' Faithful" places in Hoboken. I mean how could you not like a place that woo's you with irish soda bread and fresh fruit the moment you sit down to breakfast/brunch? Court Street never disappoints with their food, service, and ambiance. If you haven't been, make sure you go!Food - While brunch is my favorite meal there, they also do a mean dinner. I've sampled many things on the menu with their eggs benny and quiches being my favorite. My husband is in love with their corned beef hash, its ok, I've come to terms with it. Service - always impeccable and friendly. Ambiance - the happy diners there are what make it great. They are the ones to create the ambiance. Whether you are up front at the bar or back in the dining room, smiles all around.
2015-02-26,5,one of my favorite places in Hoboken. nice dining area for a more formal dinner, and a great bar menu/area if you want something more relaxed. everything ive ordered from here has been delicious. and the cheesecake is absolutely amazing. I recommend trying it.
2015-02-23,5,Loved the atmosphere and the food. Other than just average service, the restaurant is perfect. Good wine selection, fresh fish, interesting dishes, it was all wonderful. I'd go back in a heartbeat.
2015-02-18,5,This place was AMAZING! We came here for Valentine's day for the first time and we were happy we did! There was a set menu with plenty to choose from and a variety of food that all sounded great. We shared the hot appetizer for two with a bunch of different shellfish and stuffed mushrooms. For our entree, he ordered the surf and turf and I ordered the scallops over mushrooms and rice. The beets were the perfect touch to the meal, and they were possibly my favorite. Dessert was a bowl of dark chocolate and fresh fruit. Perfect- just sweet enough and light enough after a big dinner! The wait staff was more than helpful and super nice! Would love to come back to this place on a normal night and dive into their regular menu!
2015-02-08,4,Reasonably priced brunch includes corn bread and fruit.  I got the salmon eggs Benedict and it was cooked perfectly.  The peach Bellini is also delicious.The home fries are average. I recommend substituting the broccoli for something else if you get an eggs Benedict.  The broccoli is too large and I felt like the fruit is enough healthiness w the meal :) Also tried the corn beef hash which some of it was dry and some of it juicy.  Overall you can't go wrong with Court street.
2015-02-02,3,I picked Court Street for a Sunday Brunch with the "ladies". I hadn't been here in years and thought it would be convenient for a brunch. We arrived at peak time as the place was full (around 1pm). Service was slow but our waitress was gracious considering all of our "wonderful personalities."They place fruit cups and Irish Soda bread on the table which certainly helps while you wait for your meal. Brunch:Eggs benedict- good, not the best I have hadSide of corned beef hash- delicious, and homemadeFrench toast- very good- made with Challah breadBlueberry pancakes-goodThe Bellini's left a lot to be desired. First pitcher-the bartender made it with tons of ice. You don't water down Prosecco with ice. Very little peach, so we told him to get rid of the ice and add more peach. Next pitcher-we tried the mango with no ice-again, nothing to write home about. That detail can be easily rectified and make the brunch experience that much better. Court Street has a nice vibe and worth a visit for any meal time.
2015-01-30,3,GF and I went for restaurant week so take it with a grain of salt (ie I am restricted to eat what is on the menu and choices would not necessarily be my first choice on the menu).Deal was $35 for an app, entree, and dessert.App: baked brie in puff pastry and prosciutto & goat cheese crostinis (3): baked brie was a monster, very cheesy, and paired well with pears and the small greens and honey  mustard. crostinis were also good and i do not care much for prosciuttoentrees: grilled flat iron steak and lamb shankflat iron steak: tendon-y and really made me not enjoy it. Flavor was ok, just a standard gravy. cooked very well (med-rare)lamb shank: fall off the bone, literally pick if up and it falls off - very nice. flavor was good too. Dessert: chocolate peanut butter pie and warm brownie sundae. PB pie tasted like a reeses and the brownie sundae was just OK. Wasn't crazy about the grand marnier sauce as it was too rich.
2015-01-22,5,Lovely atmosphere here and great service, Consistently wonderfully prepared food , classy, and a great wine bar. Love the house merlot! This is my favorite for brunch and dinner restaurant to visit when someone wants a fine meal from out of town. Go here for the Lobster and Prine Rib specials, you won't be disappointed. The place is small and cozy so if you go during popular times, be prepared for a bit of a wait, but its worth it. One of the better places to eat in Hoboken for American food.
2015-01-02,5,Can't get enough of this place!!!  This is my go to bar when in Hoboken.  It's the whole package from a solid meal every time I go, to the environment, and staff.  Very chill atmosphere and if one of the guys is working the bar, you'll get some chill "Grateful Dead" music:)  Court Street is one of the few restaurants around that is consistent with the quality of their food, which means a lot to me.  I have never had a bad meal and for that I am grateful.  Thank you for doing such a great job!
2014-12-08,4,Nice place.  The bar is in the front with several hi top tables as well.  The dinning room is in the back.   The whole place was very clean and had a good atmosphere.  The menu had a nice selection.  I had a seafood pasta dish with scallops, shrimp, clams, and mussels.  It's served with linguini but I had it with penne instead.   It was a great meal.   The hostess was nice but a little less than pleasant.   Overall it was great and I would go back again.
2014-12-05,5,A family favorite. The owner/manager Meagan remembers my mother's special dietary requests (scary that she orders the same thing every time) and is extremely friendly and knowledgable about wines - even impressed my dad.
2014-11-24,4,Court Street still has the best under the radar Sunday brunch in Hoboken.  We've been coming here for years before we had kids, after we had little ones in tow, and now even make the occasional out-of-towner visit now that we've been booted to the burbs.While the coffee is not included in the price anymore, this is easily the best value for the money of any brunch served on a table cloth in town.  The dining room is surprisingly nice and can accomodate larger groups if you reserve ahead - they are kid friendly too which is rare in Hoboken.  Every entree comes with a nice fresh fruit starter and Irish soda bread as a starter, and the food is excellent.  You can't go wrong with the standard bacon & eggs or sausage options, and the corned beef hash is excellent.  The blueberry pancakes are personal favorities of mine as well.  And if you're more of a lunch fan, the burger, salads and pasta options are nice altnernatives.  Service is quick, people are nice, coffee is good.  Full bar also gives you the option of a nice bloody Mary pitcher to kick off the day, or second day if you have kids and have been up for six hours.  Bonus - you can sit at the bar or one of the small tables in the front room if you want to eat and catch one of the early games.
2014-11-18,5,highly recommend there food is great tasting chef alex is the best and he is very attentive to your needs thank you will return!
2014-11-18,5,Fantastic! From the greeting from the waitress to the end of the meal.Waitress  was very friendly and knew the menu forward and backwards. She made sugesstions for all the courses and everyone loved the food! The drink specials were refreshing and very tasty, house wine delish! Was there for my nephew's basketball game at Stephen's Institute but even though I live quite far away I will definatly return for another great dining experience!
2014-10-12,5,Very nice discovery when we enter this place! From outside you could expect a small strange old pub, but inside the restaurant room is very nice, clean and modern. What we ate was delicious!
2014-10-08,3,Good brunch experience. Food is consistent/ nothing fantastic. Good service and love the bread basket. Must come back for another wine tasting event.
2014-08-11,5,I eat dinner here at least once a week. they've been running the tri-color endive salad all summer as a special and it is delish and perfectly dressed. the pappardelle with short ribs on their specials is INCREDIBLE!!! their chicken parm is also really good. great wine, great service. only complaint is their air conditioner is a little high for my liking - so bring a sweater!
2014-07-31,5,I used to live in Hoboken and had walked past this place 100 times, but never went in. They always advertised crazy lobster specials too...I don't know why I never checked it out. Anyway, me and a friend of mine were chatting about #HudsonRW (Hudson County Restaurant week) & saw the menu posted, so we decided to check it out. I thought everything was amazing. We got there around 8:30pm on a Wednesday and the place was packed, so we sat at the bar & ordered some wine, the Sauv Blanc was awesome. They told us there would be a 30 min way, but sat us within 15-20 minutes. We were contemplating ordering lobster or from the pre-fix menu, as the prices were very reasonable, but we went with the pre-fix restaurant week menu. I had the baked brie, the potato encrusted tilapia & the brownie sundae for desert. The waitress definitely helped with my decision and she was great, very honest, helpful and descriptive, which I loved. The food was amazing, and my experience was perfect. I'll definitely go back!
2014-07-29,4,Dined here tonight for the second and hopefully not last time. It's Hudson restaurant week and a three course meal was $30, a real bargain. The hardest thing was choosing from the list of wonderful sounding starters, Denise and I shared the mussels meuniere and the baked Brie in puff pastry over mixed greens. Both were excellent. For entree, I selected the hanger steak au poivre accompanied by potatoes au gratin, pureed beets and baked acorn squash with cinnamon. Everything was delicious. For dessert we had the apple tart and brownie sundae. Both were excellent. And their coffee is great. All in all, a great meal at a great price and excellent service.PS - They don't take reservations, but if you arrive by 6:30 there is usually no wait.
2014-07-28,4,Stopped in quickly for some drinks and left planning our trip back when we could try the food.  The bartender was friendly enough and made our drinks straight away.  The decor while some have called campy and tacky I really enjoyed.  Lots of old pictures from varying genres of movies.  Added some character to the place in my opinion.  Food looked and smelled great from what we could see others munching on.  Drinks weren't terribly priced.  This one is worth a second look for sure.
2014-07-14,4,This was my first time at Courtt Street, and I thought the food and service made for one of the best dining experiences that I have had in Hoboken. If you are familiar with the Hoboken restaurant scene, you know that nothing is very impressionable and your best dining option is somewhere across the river in NYC. However, I think Court Street did a good job of providing a nice meal in a pleasant surrounding close to home.  You will be hard pressed to find a nicer brunch experience in Hoboken.  Court Street has a pretty, well-lit dining room that is just slightly less stuffy than Amanda's.  It's a good place to bring your parents when they are visiting from out of town, as the wait staff will not rush you out.  There are also plenty of menu options, and everyone at my table seemed pleased with their meals.
2014-07-13,5,Great food, great service.This really is both a restaurant and a bar.  The bar is very dark and old school (think regulars walking in and asking for "the usual"-type atmosphere).  When you walk further back you find yourself peering into a surprisingly fancy dining area that makes you feel a bit ashamed that you're just wearing shorts and flip flops.  But then the owner (Megan) or one of her super friendly staff seats you and makes you feel like family and it's all good.Brunch is always busy so we try to come closer to 11 when they open.  You get your very own cup of fresh fruit and a basket of crumbly Irish soda bread.  The omelettes are fluffy and their corned beef hash is probably the only kind I've had that's made out of REAL corned beef they've cooked and shredded.  It's unbelievably good.  Also if you love broccoli, this place has the best broccoli...buttery and al dente.  For dinner I once had the red snapper and it tasted like it was just caught that day - very delicate and fresh.  Also the goat cheese and arugula salad is so simple yet so good.For families with young kids, almost everyone who works here loves kids so don't feel shy bringing them.  My only gripe is the stairs at the entrance. Beware if you have a big stroller because it's a little hard to get in and out of the restaurant, and they don't allow strollers in the dining area.  So you either have to collapse it or park it outside.  I'd suggest bringing a lock or wearing your baby.
2014-07-08,2,Cool little spot in the city, but thats about it. The environment was pretty boring. Got a 1/2 lb burger with bacon and sautéed onions. The bacon was poor. You could tell it was just thrown on the grill and paid no attention to. Burger was alright. Will not be back
2014-06-22,2,The standard of this once great restaurant seems to be dropping. Wait staff dress and act very sloppy and one even smelled bad!We had the Lobster special - one lobster arrived with a blackened inside - caused apparently by eggs still inside the female but black color shows under cooking. Lobsters were tougher than normal also.Have been here many times before as this was a classy place to eat in Hoboken - the last visit was not so. Very disappointed!
2014-05-04,3,I would give it 3.5 stars. It is good quality food. We got the clams, French Onion soup, arugula and goat cheese salad and mako steak. The clams and salad were good. The soup was above average and the mako steak was delicious. I would give this place a higher rating but I don't like that it's hidden and not a byob. For Hoboken it has a lot of competition but it is definitely a good spot to try once.
2014-05-04,2,This is a reflection of the food - service was fine, and the bar is fine (lots of good wine & beer options).  First, they are trying to do too many things - do you have good bar food? Or finer dining? Neither works.  They should just be a bar and then make good bar food. The prices are outrageous - for a mediocre, "steak sandwich" - toasted white bread, a small over-cooked steak, sprinkling of onions & mushrooms and smothered in cheese (at $1-1.50 EACH, to ADD ON), I was charged $20!  Edible? Maybe. But worth like $8. Fish and chips were one small piece of fish.  Guacamole was good, but SMALL.Menu is too big and maybe if they tried to do less and make a few things Good they'd be more successful. Yuck.
2014-04-29,2,I have been here twice: once for brunch and once for dinner. Both times were extremely underwhelming. The decor of the restaurant portion is really lacking... I almost felt like I was in the dining hall of a senior center. I honestly forget what I ordered for dinner (that's how memorable it was...) but I do remember it came with a side of mashed potatoes that had been sprayed onto the plate like out of a can of whipped cream. 1983 called, they want their plating back.I would go back for a drink at their bar, but definitely not for the food.
2014-04-14,3,dinner on a friday night. normal menu seemed a bit weird. great prices.nightly specials.cozy atmosphere. those were not steak cut french fries....tisk tisk
2014-03-24,2,Court Street was our first thought, but I had reservations because I never have been a fan. And this time would not convert me either.After waiting in the front bar, rowdy for St. Patrick's Day, we were sat in the loud dinning room. For the holiday, our breadbasket included Irish soda bread, a sweet pleasant surprise. That night, we just ordered mains.My father had the beef Burgundy, which was served on a bed of yellow egg noodles. The stew looked pretty non-descript, but the portion was heaping and the sauce was hot.For my mother, the penne with seared scallops, artichoke hearts, tomato, and basil, coated in a little garlicky olive oil, one of the specials. The plate was pretty, but just looked like pasta. The plump scallops had a nice sear and the penne was al dente, adding textural balance.The chicken Francaise that my sister had was tasty, but just kind of dull. There was nothing super amazing about it, in fact, it is something would have tasted just as good if made at home. This was the same of the mashed potatoes.I ordered the panko-encrusted tuna dish, which was described as sushi-grade tuna, seared on the outside but a perfect rare on the inside. That is what I got, but it too was lacking and the crust was overwhelming. The sauces-- a wet spicy wasabi dressing, and a thick sesame aioli--made up for the missing flavor. The wasabi sauce was super hot and almost uncomfortable for me.In the end, the best things were the side and garnish. The olive tapenade served with the bread is super amazing, briny, creamy, chunky and delicious. The evening's vegetable, sautéed green beans, was salty, buttery, tasty and addictive. And that puree garnish, sitting pretty on the plate, was sweet and savory, like carrots.There was nothing remotely tempting or different for dessert, so quite unlike us, we skipped it. All this being said, Court Street is like a family place, like sitting down to dinner at home for home-cooked food. There is nothing extraordinary about the food, the menu or the place, but that is not really what it is supposed to be. It's not about innovation, but the classics people can rely on. If only those classics were taken up a notch.
2014-03-18,4,I like this restaurant a lot.  Good food and good atmosphere.  Good to go to on a date or just with friends.
2014-02-22,5,Dinner was a great introduction to Court Street R&B. It was just the two of us but the bar & dining room were completely full.It's not suprising either b/c this place is wonderful. The decor is a bit more upscale, which is nice! We were also seated immediately and had a very friendly waitress. The attentiveness after we recieved our meal could be a little better but, again, the place was full so it's understandable.The food was delicious and hot and there was plenty of it! We had:* bread (the tapenade is their "special" olive spread that I did not like at all - I'm not a fan of olives though so that's probably the issue)* shrimp cocktail (the cocktail sauce is very good but the shrimp are a bit small for $3 each...)* chicken parm (delicious w/ FRESH mutz! maybe get extra red sauce on the side of pasta)* traditional pot roast (DELICIOUS! So tender, perfectly cooked, and awesome gravy)* no dessert - we barely finished our meals!We can't believe we have walked by here many times and have never seen this gem. It's a great place and we can't wait to return.
2014-02-21,5,One of our top 2 favorite restaurants in Hoboken. EXCELLENT FOOD & WONDERFUL SERVICE!Great menu - you can get a great piece of swordfish or a burger - they have just about anything you could want & the wine list is fantastic.  Full bar, fast service & delicious meals.  There is usually a bit of a wait [up to 30 min usually, no reservations under 5 ppl I think] but it's well worth it & there is additional seating in the bar area. We've gone every NYE for the past 4 years or so and their prix fixe menu that night is outstanding!
2014-02-06,4,I was here over the weekend for a birthday brunch with family.  The staff was very kind.  The food was overall very good.  My homemade corned beef hash was the best part of my plate.  Not the best homemade corned beef hash I've had, but definitely near the top (and I've had a lot).  All of the people in my party were more than satisfied with their meals and the service.
2014-02-03,4,Ambiance, food and service is what has my husband and i come here more often than other restos in hobo.  Classic American fare and reasonable prices... Yummy soups and steaks. This is a good change of pace from the sports bar atmosphere... Good sit down spot without the chaos and noise...
2014-01-21,3,Definitely not a 4, but not really a 3 either. More like a 3.5 (Yelp, seriously, get your shit together and include half-stars in your ratings).My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on Sunday (01/19) after being turned away at both Anthony David's and The Elysian Cafe. We were first told it would be a 15-20 minute wait for a table, but after less than 3 minutes, we were escorted to a cozy two-seater in the dining room. Off to a good start.The restaurant's main dining area is comfortable and bright, with tables that are spaced close together but not directly next to each other, so you have some sense of privacy. As soon as we were seated, we were served two cups full of fresh fruit, which would have been fantastic if the fruits weren't honeydew and cantaloupe (two fruits I absolutely will not, cannot eat because they taste like bits of hard rubber dipped in talcum powder). NOTE TO ALL HOBOKEN EATERIES: Please include other, more delicious fruits on your menus, like berries or bananas or hell, even a plum or two. I don't care if it costs more, your patrons will thank you. Moving on...We had to wait a bit for our server, who sounded like she was getting over a cold. I don't think she gave us her name, either (although the receipt said, "Laura L", so we'll go with that). As she took our orders, we were given Court Street's complimentary Irish soda bread, which is also something I tend to stay away from because the flavor is either atrocious or non-existent. But Court Street got it right: the bread was firm, but not rock-hard, and it had a very pleasant, sweet and eggy taste overall, with the best part being the crust. I had to will myself not to eat more than one piece.I decided to order my usual brunch favorite (smoked salmon Benedict) with mimosa, and my boyfriend ordered French toast with maple syrup and coffee. We waited an unusually long time for our drinks, and I was surprised by the size of the glass Laura handed me. I'm used to sipping mimosas from thin champagne glasses, but she served it to me in what looked to be a 10-oz glass. I wasn't disappointed, but I had to wait until I had more food in my stomach before I began drinking (small person + too much liquor at once = giggly tipsiness). My boyfriend's coffee was served without ceremony in a plain white mug. No cream or milk was offered by our server. Puzzling, but he drank the coffee anyway and didn't mind the texture of it.My smoked salmon Benedict came with broccoli and roasted potato slices cut into little circles. It was good, not great. I liked how the broccoli was sauteed, and the potatoes were nicely done. I also tried a piece of my boyfriend's French toast and thought it was a little on the eggy side, but it was also good, and the maple syrup wasn't overly sweet. However, he had one complaint with the corned beef hash, which he felt was more like chopped/diced corned beef with a couple random pieces of cooked potatoes thrown in.We declined dessert (we were both pretty full by the time we finished) and left feeling mostly satisfied with our dining experience. Again, as I said earlier, the food was good, not terrific, but worth another try. Judging from the other reviews of this place, it seems as if the pre-fix dinner on weekdays and Lobsterfest in the summer are their main attractions. I'll have to stop by on a random work night and see if Court Street truly lives up to all the hype.
2014-01-12,5,I love this spot, it's a hidden treasure the food is great and the staff is friendly - make sure you order the chicken parm or the chicken Marsala. The beers on tap are always cold and amazing to drink. Enjoy!
2013-12-28,4,Walk through the narrow, wood covered, hip bar area to an open dining room.  Excellent ambience, large arched windows, crisp white linen, and a view of a picturesque bricked alley.  We made reservations for Lobsterfest.  Glad we did, because the dining room was filled.  We were given a long list of available lobster sizes, which are offered at incredibly reasonable prices, and are in addition to the 2 lobster specials they offer.  Everyone in our large group who ordered lobster, was more than pleased. The lobsters were all fresh, succulent, and yummy. Other dishes ordered included the sea scallops, which were prepared perfectly.  The flavor was nutty and the scallops were moist.  The veal parm was also delicious, as was the salmon.  You can't go wrong here.
2013-12-11,5,LOVE this place!  The bar is great and has a super low key vibe and the dining room is very nice, with just dressy enough.  Service has always been top notch.  Food isn't cheap but the quality is ALL there, and it is a really good deal if you go on one of their special nights (Mondays for prime rib and Wednesdays for lobster).  Great wine list at a very affordable price point.  Have liked everything we've had there, which is unusual for us.  The desserts are fabulous, too - get the profiteroles!
2013-11-27,5,This is by far our favorite spot in Hoboken and one of the few restaurants in the NY area that we frequent regularly. We prefer to sit in the bar area at a high top... it's always a nice atmosphere and incredibly cozy. Food, beverage and specials menus are all extensive. Staff is attentive and pleasant. We love the French onion soup, I am a big fan of their salads and my husband always enjoys their heartier dishes. I often skip the entire meal, though, and just save room for dessert... profiteroles are beyond amazing. Brunch is also fantastic.  Really can't say enough how much we enjoy coming here!!
2013-11-06,4,One of the better sit downs available in Hoboken. Pretty underrated as well. I do recommend the pre-fix which is from 5pm-7pm on the weekdays. It comes with a choice of appetizer, hot meal, and dessert all for around $20 a person. All the food items that are available to try are definitely above average. I can safely say I never had a bad meal here. Portions are generous too (get ready for leftovers!) Service is usually outstanding. Surprisingly they also have a very competitive wine menu as well. The make a MEAN seared tuna here. It's kind of expensive and I'm not sure if it's included in the pre-fix (over $20) but it's really tasty. You wouldn't expect that from a place like this in Hoboken. Definitely give this place a try...
2013-10-30,5,Great restaurant!!  Relaxed Vibe with a nice crowd.  Jeff the bartender Rocks!  Best Bartender in Hoboken!
2013-10-14,5,A great place, off the craziness of Washington (OK, about 50 feet off).  Went there yesterday with a date for football, and it was a perfect setting. We started with a pitcher of mimosas, still hurting a little from the night before.  We then moved on to lunch.  I ordered the ham apple and brie on a croissant, and it was delicious.  It came with a side of Irish Soda Bread and a fruit cup to start.  After we ate lunch, we both had a few beers,, and left happy, and satisfied.  The best part was, everything was 55 dollars, including a few buy backs from the bartender.  We will be back.
2013-09-27,1,WARNING: don't get the overpriced shrimp or oysters. They are frozen than thawed to a perfect rubbery texture. Oh and they serve it with a generic cocktail sauce which is obviously ordered in bulk.  Very disappointed by the food. My wife ordered the scallops, best thing about her dish the sweet potato mash.
2013-09-06,4,Court Street, named after the alley it sits on, which is apparently actually a street somehow(?), is one of the better places in the area. The service and food are both generally good. I particularly enjoyed their brunch.There is a bar area in front, which is a pretty typical bar area, but doesn't seem to get too raucous, fortunately. In back there is a moderately large dining room, which is where I've always sat. Nothing jumps out in particular about the space; it's clean and functional.I also sat at a table next to some local D-list reality TV celebrities once, so that can happen. If you're...lucky?
2013-08-29,5,Although Court Street is usually busy, I like to consider Court Street Hoboken's best kept secret. It's not in a location that's in your face like most restaurants on Washington Street. In other words, if you haven't been referred to Court Street or know it exists from yelping, you may never find it. And I like that aspect of this awesome bar and restaurant. What's so cool about it is it feels like an old-school bar when you walk in adorned with an oak bar, black and white framed pictures and TVs playing sports. Typical yet not trendy like most new bars in Hoboken. Eating in this area is okay as your two options are a bistro table and high seats or simply eating at the bar. But once you walk towards the back the experience changes exponentially. You walk into a cozy and classy dining area with ambient lighting, soft music, and white linen-clothed tables. This makes for a perfect outing for a date or dinner with family. The food is awesome. I particularly recommend anything Italian here, but the steaks are great here as well. Five stars all the way!
2013-08-20,5,Best wings in Hoboken bar none. Everything I have ever eaten there, and I have been going for at least six years, is amazing. Their pasta with sweet Italian sausage is out of this world. I didn't get it with penne though, I got it with a thinner pasta and added bell peppers. Yummy.
2013-08-15,4,I finally got to try this place and was not disappointed.My group ordered off the Prefix menu which is available on select nights.I started with the zucchini bruschetta then I had the Chicken Marsala and it was very good, so good I cleaned my plate.  I finished my night off with the Homemade rice pudding and left a happy camper.The service was great as well. Never had an empty glass and server was very attentive.
2013-08-10,4,I'm not eating and drinking here nearly enough, and neither are you. Everybody, let's go here and get fat! Great food, great atmosphere, great people.
2013-07-09,4,I had the lobster there. It was really good! Their French Onion soup is delicious. Their bree appetizer was amazing. I really want to go back and try other entrees there. Very busy place. We were lucky to get a table near the bar, because everyone else had reservations. I would recommend getting reservations to get a nice table there.
2013-06-26,4,This is the second time my husband and I ate here and I was pleased to find our return visit was as good as the first!Service was prompt and friendly. I was looking for a nice dry white wine by the glass and our server (wish I had gotten her name) recommended a Sancerre. Great choice - yummy!I had the Bancino Franchisee and hubby had the swordfish with a mango/black bean salsa. Both of us cleaned our plates.This is definitely our new date-night spot!
2013-06-24,4,Let me tell you that the service here was amazing. I went for brunch with my daughter and I loved every minute of it. She got the Benedict as always and I got the Grand Marnier French Toast. To die for!!!! I highly recommend this spot for Brunch and I am excited to try it for dinner one day!!!
2013-06-23,4,Nice place, a bit cozy up front in the bar area. Food was very solid, particularly relative to cost.  Service on point with no frills.
2013-06-05,3,On a recent visit to Hoboken was brought here to get a quick bite in the standard irish-like pub. Kinda dark, tvs, dudes at the bar drinking beer and eating burgers, cute female behind the bar providing pretty quick service. All good.I had a chicken club, I think, and my friend had a burger. Everything was surprisingly really good. especially after my 5th beer by 3:00. (nice nap afterward.)REally good local place that I would recommend. My guess, at times, this place gets really crowded...but there are tables in the backroom to add to the tables opposite the bar area.
2013-04-22,3,Passed by this place many times. It looks friendly and inviting. They were one of the few open during Sandy. Finally decided to stop for dinner.The good: service, wine list, clean, large windows, comfortable bar tables.The ahhh-ok: food.The bad: none noted.Will I come back? Maybe.Cornish hen was decent. Burger wasn't anything to get excited about. Standard list of beer. Good wine list.The place is loud. I think they should keep music a bit down so that people don't have to scream to overpower it. Tons of TVs above the bar and on the walls. Not sure what else to add - your typical average American restaurant.
2013-04-09,2,OK - the 2 stars might seem a little harsh but let me explain.  We had a reservation at Court Street on a Saturday night.  You enter at the bar and it's definitely a pretty nice place.  The bar area is a little more upscale than most bars in Hoboken and then the actual dining room is very nice.  Tablecloths, well kept, etc.  Not your average Hoboken restaurant/bar.  Service was pretty good throughout the meal.  No complaints from me there.  I was kind of looking forward to a burger, but Court House has a much more extensive dinner menu than I thought they would.  They actually have a huge seafood selection, and most of the people I was dining with decided on seafood so it kind of swayed my decision.  I went with the panko-encrusted center cut sushi tuna.  I'm a big fan of tuna so I had no problem going with that.  The tuna also came with a choice of potato and vegetables.  I also specified that I like my tuna rare (as it probably should be cooked).I was starving when we got here so I even started with an order of the french onion soup.  The french onion soup was very good.  I do think french onion is pretty standard no matter where you get it, but this one was solid.  The bread premeal was good, too.  It even came with some sort of olive tapenade that I thought was tasty.  I'm not even the biggest fan of olives, but I liked this one.  Along with some drinks from the bar, the meal was off to a pretty good start.I have to admit that my meal was pretty disappointing.  My tuna was way overcooked.  Even my wife said she noticed that.  Yes, I know I probably should have sent it back, but I was pretty hungry and didn't notice it immediately since it was crusted.  I guess I just had confidence that it would be cooked to near perfection.  It was also a fatty piece of tuna, so I kind of got the "raw" end of the deal on two sides (pun intended).  The potatoes and veggies that came with the dinner were also just OK.  I also have to say that the portions were pretty small.  My wife, who rarely ever finishes her meal, ate the entire thing (she had the crab cakes).  I did try a bite - they were good but definitely a little on the small side.  We also ordered dessert (yes, we went all out).  My wife and I split a piece of the chocolate cheesecake.  The chocolate cheesecake was very good - I was definitely impressed.  Unfortunately, it was the highlight of the meal.  I would definitely order it again.  It's kind of funny because the meal started well and ended well - it was just that my meal was a little on the disappointing side.I just can't give this place higher than a 2 star rating considering my meal and the place isn't cheap.  I would actually consider giving this place another shot, but I would definitely order something different.  If I do get back here and have a better experience, I will definitely update my review.
2013-04-09,2,You guys... I got really sick after eating brunch here. Like... really sick. Also, the service was super slow for brunch on a Sunday. The food tasted decent enough, but...  you know. I'll spare you the deets.
2013-03-27,5,This is probably me and my husbands favorite place in Hoboken. The food is consistently great here and the service is good as well. We like how there's a bar area that's a little noisier and fun and also a quieter dining room when you want a dimmer, tablecloth style dinner. They always have tons on daily specials on top of their regular menu so there always something to please anyone in your group.   The homemade pies are super good and their meat dishes with sauces is my pick. I especially like their Monday night prime rib night for just $18! And it's Soo good. Comes with  soup or salad too. It is a really filling meal. The best part is always this red mashed beet or potato something that comes on most dinner plates. It's awesome!
2013-03-10,2,Don't go to Court Street expecting to bring your own bottle of wine!"Our prices are fair " she said.... "We'll pay a $20 corkage fee" I said... purely profit to them by the way... "We have a very good wine list at reasonable prices" she said...All fine and dandy...good for Court Street! However, we had something to celebrate and had a bottle of wine that was appropriate for our occasion!We had a water and left. ?$&@(;: you! Too bad I live around the corner and loved this place! I will miss you!
2013-02-16,4,This is a solid restaurant, and maybe one of the best in Hoboken.  I would give it five stars but I see that as perfection and though it was amazing it was not perfection (the french onion soup was pretty good, but not the best.  Then again, I'm kind of a french onion soup snob so maybe it deserves five stars ;)).A group of friends and I went here for a birthday celebration during Hudson County Restaurant Week, and I am glad we did.  The front bar looks ...well...like a bar, but the restaurant area is very cute and really nice.  Our server was great, and the food was really fantastic.  I had the potato encrusted tilapia with potatoes au gratin and mashed beets (amazing!!!!).   Everyone else at the table loved their meal as well. It's definitely worth a visit if you're looking for something a little less Black Bear/ One Republik-ish in Hoboken.  It's a little on the pricey side, but its worth it!
2013-02-05,3,My favorite thing about this place is that one of their celebrity pictures they have a headshot of Ron Burgandy, that's right, not Will Ferrell, but Ron Burgandy. For me, that's enough of a reason to go back here, but there food is always quite good as well. I would give this place a higher rating since I've enjoyed all of the food there but each time I've been there I've received subpar service and a couple of times the dinner just dragged on forever.If you're looking for a nice dinner and not in a rush, this place is a great choice.
2013-01-30,5,I might have found my goto wine bar.  I read through the most recent reviews and was left scratching my head.  Almost all of them talk about how good the food is, how friendly the staff is, how reasonable the prices are...and then give three stars.  I don't get it.  Went for the first time this week and we were impressed.  The wine list is certainly above average (wine spectator awards for the past 10 years or so and they carry some of my favorites).  The food was excellent, lamb shank, the soup, the sides.  The brie/puff pasty was an excellent app.  Standard anti-mullet decor.  Party in the front (tvs, bar seating, etc) business in the back.  Couples, couples with parents, a few older groups.  Big thumbs up.
2013-01-17,3,This kind of place would have plastic surgery and it showed.  You would think this would be a regular Hoboken tavern or a nice looking girl, but as you walk in closer there was clearly a facelift and a few enhancements.  My head was trying to get around that this is actually really deceivingly classy inside.  I came for lobsterfest with some members of the family after work and I was for some reason the only one getting the lobster.  The other guys found much better substitutes on the menu.  The beer is appropriately priced.  I was very disappointed that there were no pitchers for draft beer.  As for the lobster.  It was perfectly cooked and was very delicious.  It was however deceptively small compared to other lobster feasts I have had.  You should opt for the two lobster deal.  The salad (you can get soup) was fresh and crisp.  The additional side it came with was a potato.  I had mine smashed.  Not bad.  There were spaghetti squash and beets off to the side of that.  Meh.  I heard the beef stroganoff and the seafood pasta was very very good.  The vanilla ice cream parfait with the grand marnier chocolate sauce was brilliant and did an excellent job of topping my stomach off.  I would come back just for that.  I was also given caffeinated espresso and not DECAF and I ended up running the mile in my sleep!  Oh well.  I will be back one of these days.There is a pub section and a dining room.
2013-01-06,3,This place lives and dies by the daily specials.  The standard menu is kind of meh to me but I always find 3 or 4 dinners I want to order from the Specials menu.  I've had the rabbit here and a couple of the pasta and seafood specials.  The food is consistent and always pretty good.  Lobster night is always welcome.  The profiteroles for dessert was outstanding.  The decor in the dining room is kind of bland and the service is so-so. The drinks menu is pretty standard.  Overall, it's a good, consistent spot.
2013-01-02,4,I went to Court Street on NYE with my fiance and two other couples.  They had a pre fixe, not the regular menu and the price of the 3 course dinner was determined by which entree you selected.For an appetizer I had the peach, goat cheese and avocado salad which was amazing.  I wish it was on the regular menu.  It was such a treat to have peaches this time of the year.  For an entree I had the surf and turf which came with a small lobster tail and 6 oz filet, which was cooked to perfection.  The options for dessert were off the regular menu and I selected the fondue- fresh pineapple, strawberries and bananas served with chocolate sauce for dipping.  Everything was delicious and I was beyond stuffed.  I usually only order an entree and maybe an app to share with my fiance.  It was a bit on the pricier side, but then again, it was NYE.  The total bill for two with tax, tip and two drinks was $150.  Overall it was a great experience.
2012-12-29,3,Your generic "everything on the menu" higher end Jersey place. You've got a dedicated lobster by the pound menu, seafood, meat and poultry and tons of specials. My bf and I came here for dinner at 9 and didn't have an issue getting A table. But people started to clear out after 45 minutes. Our waiter was really nice and made tons of suggestions- we asked a lot of questions. He was good about refilling waters Too. The entrees pricing wasn't bad- high teens, low twenties, but the apps were in the $10 range. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller which was more creamed spinach then oyster, and it was also not shucked well as I had pieces floating in my mouth. Big fail at 4 at $8.95. The bread basket wasn't anything special- it was dry stale ish bread. But the olive and Caper tapenade was great. As far as dinner goes, I ordered the corvina- a sea bass like white fish. I wasn't that flaky. It was fattier and more substantial than most white fish. It was served in an awesome white wine sauce. I liked the roasted spinning and beet purée but I didn't like my Au gratin potatoes- they were a bit bland and needed salt. My bf ordered the filet mignonette of pork- he said it was good, ESP. The rich Marsala wine sauce. I tried a little of his mashed and it was good. We ordered some drinks. My bf got the winter ale staff special- which we said wasn't as bitter as he liked. I thought my wine was really good- I got the premium Viognier from their award winning affiliate winery. It was fruity and light, but zesty. Lastly, we ordered the homemade cheesecake. It was not as Dry as my bf prefers it but I thought it was good. I also don't eat cheesecake too much so I don't know all the nuances.  Came to $40 a person.  I'd come back perhaps for bar food- we sat in the more formal dining room in the back but there are bar tables out in front if you want to watch TV.
2012-12-09,2,I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed with our visit to Court Street.  First of all, though, I will tell you that it's lovely - a beautiful bar with some cozy 2-tops in the bar area, and a small, but very pretty dining room.  The menu is quite comprehensive and offers a little bit of everything.  The service was adequately attentive.  So that's the good.  The bad?  Everything we had was ridiculously underseasoned.  Lobster bisque was way too sweet (too much sherry?) and undersalted.  Hubby's beef burgundy required copious amounts of salt and pepper to produce any flavor.  Our daughter had pasta with olive oil and shrimp.  She said the pasta was flavorful, but the shrimp had no flavor at all.  Again, copious amounts of salt and pepper, which none of us have a tendency to add to anything.  I had a special puff pastry appetizer with crab, asparagus and fontina.  Mine was probably the most successful dish of the night.  However, it was served on a bed of arugula that was devoid of flavor and actually quite tough.  I guess I'm used to young arugula that offers a peppery bite, which would have been a nice counterpoint to the creamy puff pastry.  I wish restaurants would make the decision not to offer something if it is out of season and not up to par.  (Tomatoes are a perfect example.)  Just disappointing all around.
2012-12-08,5,Went here for dinner on a Thursday night with my family who were visiting from out of town. We were seated in the dining room in the back since the bar area is a bit tight for 4 people. I had the braised short rib special which was simply DELICIOUS. My mom had the duck breast special which she really liked, my dad had crab cakes that he said were really good, and my sister had a flat iron steak that she really enjoyed. Service was excellent from all the really friendly and attentive staff here at Court St. It really is a great little place just to have a drink at the bar or to sit down and have a quality meal in the restaurant side. All four of us left very satisfied and have been talking about how good the experience was for the last few days now. We will definitely be back again soon!
2012-11-23,5,My family lives right near Court Street, and we love the neighborhood bar feel that we always get there.  We go there at least once a week, or at least get take-out.  I like the menu because there is always something healthy to order, and if I'm feeling like something unhealthy, the waffle fries are to die for.  The bartenders are so nice, and I love that it's never too loud in the bar area.
2012-10-20,1,If I could give this place no stars I would! Went in there on a Friday night with my gf and sat up front near the bar. We heard good things from friends but everything from my experience was beyond awful. We sat down and I asked for menus and was immediately greeted by a very unfriendly, snooty, disrespectful waitress. When I asked for menus and water she gave me a look and told me to give her a minute, rolled her eyes and walked away. We ordered the goat cheese salad to start and share and what we got was a sad looking plate of pre-packaged lettuce with some random slices of paper thin tomatoes on the side, a little goat cheese thrown on top and some oily ass dressing. I could make a MUCH better salad at home. My gf ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the sliced "filet mignon" sandwich. She seemed to like her meal but mine was seriously lacking in every department. It was obvious that I got a side of tiny, lame, bottom of the bag fries while my gf got a bunch of awesome ones! What I ordered was called filet mignon but what I got was a weak, dry, flavorless, thin ass piece of cheap looking flank steak thrown on top of two slices of shitty white toast. Nowhere near what I expected! If u want a real filet sandwich go to AURTHUR'S. I was confident it was not filet so I couldn't help mentioning something to the waitress who confirmed it actually was flank steak. When I asked to see the menu just to confirm what I actually had ordered she rolled her eyes again, walked away and brought over the owner. He proceeded to tell me that it was in fact filet and "that's how it's done in Hudson county". By far the worst meal I've had in Hoboken and most certainly will NEVER return - and I never did get to see the menu again...
2012-10-18,3,The wait staff was friendly and attentive.  The dining room was quiet, even though filled.  We ordered seafood, and after reading all the great reviews, I was disappointed.  The lobster was just ok; my portion of fish and chips was huge,but the fish was not tasty.  I liked the place enough to go back, and the prices are good, but I will not order seafood.
2012-09-15,4,A wonderful place and a great date spot. It is the best of both worlds with a bar in the front and a classy restaurant in the back. (BTW I though that had a great selection on draft)The service was great. The staff friendly. I was new to the area so they helped direct me around.The food was remarkable.  It was beautifully displayed. I had a pasta dish with pink sauce and chicken. It was incredible. The portion was large and each bite was better than the next.I would like to go back again very soon.
2012-08-13,4,Let me start by saying I don't generally like brunch.  Eggs, bread, cheap cuts of steak, and weak drinks generally = meh to me.But as far as brunch goes, this place does a pretty good job.  While the menu was painfully standard.... the omelet I had was pretty tasty.  Little fruit bowls at the beginning of the meal was a nice touch as well.  Service was average to slow.  'Pitcher' of mimosas left a lot to be desired.  Could be a 3 or 4 but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now... will go back to try dinner or brunch again and update accordingly.
2012-08-13,3,I ate here for Sunday brunch.  I had 3 eggs any style with corned beef hash and a bloody mary.  Both the food and service were good.  I really don't have any complaints about this place.  It was a nice brunch.  I am not sure if it is 4 star worthy, but it was definitely a place that I would try again.  If they impress me in the future, maybe I will raise my star rating.I would like to try it for lunch or dinner some time.  But as of right now, I would say give this place a try on a Sunday.
2012-06-10,3,The staff here is very courteous and attentive.  The decor feels a little stuffy but looks very clean and fresh, so I can't complain too much - and the prices are fair so that's a good start.I love the fact that you get tasty bread and fruit cups before you order.  It irked me when they switched my friend's and my order, putting my toppings in his omelet and vice versa.  So, I ended up having broccoli, tomatoes, and spinach with no cheese in my omelet - yep, your thinking is correct, it was pretty bland.  I'm a huge home fry snob and I thought theirs were very good.  The potatoes were mixed with a few small pieces of caramelized onions that gave them a salty-sweet taste.  They forgot to toast the english muffin that came with my meal, so that was kind of a(nother) bummer.  However, this restaurant gets 3 / 5 stars from me, because my boyfriend VERY much enjoyed the huge croissant with bacon, eggs, and cheese.  My friend also enjoyed his food (which, uhhmm, was intended to be my food hah).  Until next time, Court Street...
2012-05-28,5,Great place...Hoboken's best kept secret....Food is great, and most important, staff is amazing...love going there for my night cap right before closing...Megan and Nick are great...Jeff is great and as a bonus, he's a Red Sox fan, so love chillin there and watch the game...
2012-05-04,3,One of the better choices for American cuisine in Hoboken. The menu is good, and there was a diverse and interesting selection of specials available when we went tonight. This was our second time there and both times we've sat in the bar, but the service was sloooooow.We got the beef carpaccio special app and liked it, and I got the arugula and goat cheese salad with grilled chicken, which was nothing special and really could have used more goat cheese. My boyfriend got the ribs and wasn't crazy about the way they were sauced. They were served with a small side of a beet mixed with mashed potatoes and sugar, as well as a side of mashed potatoes and roasted cauliflower. I tried the beets and we were both surprised at how much we liked them. The last time we went a few years ago, we got steaks thought they were pretty good.We left around 10pm on a Friday night, and by the time we left, we were the youngest people left in the bar. Definitely an older crowd and a great place to grab a drink if you're looking to avoid the weekend Hoboken crowd.
2012-03-29,5,I've just found my new go-to place in Hoboken.  I fell in love with this place immediately; sitting on the corner of what is probably the cutest and oldest street in Hoboken, Court Street offers two different "ambiances."  When you walk in, it's a somewhat narrow bar, with 2-top high top tables along the windowed wall.  I went on a Wednesday, their Lobster Night, and we were able to get a table in the back Restaurant part right away.  When you walk to the end of the bar, there is a back room that I call their "Restaurant" section, with about a dozen or so tables.  It's quiet enough and cute.We each got a glass of wine; one Pinot Noir and one Sauvignon Blanc; they were very nice.  We got the special appetizer (one of many; they have quite a large menu selection which i love), which was asparagus wrapped in prosciutto, accompanied by sundried tomatoes, roasted red peppers and fresh mozzarella, drizzled with a light pesto sauce.  DELECTABLE!  The bread that was brought out was baked very well and crisp on the outside (not warm though).  It was accompanied by butter and a tapenade, which was also very good.  We also got individual appetizers- I got the Kate's Popeye Salad which was deliciously light and refreshing, and my boyfriend got a french onion soup.  FO soup is his favorite, and this was the best he/we have ever had.  The soup was very hot, and the cheese on top was cooked/toasted perfectly.  May be a bit salty for some, but to me, FO soup is supposed to be salty.  Our main courses were also amazing- I got filet mignon, ordered medium rare.  It was cooked perfectly- pink throughout the entire cut.  I got mashed potatoes and their veggie of the day, which was cauliflower.  They also give you a small portion of sweet potato mash, which was very good.  My boyfriend got a NY Strip, also cooked perfectly.  Unfortunately, there was no room for dessert, but the dessert menu looked good (although a tad overpriced if you ask me).Everything came out very timely.  The pricing was reasonable, considering it's Hoboken and the food was delicious.  I can see us going back at least once every couple weeks! :)
2012-02-24,3,Came here for brunch and had the chicken sandwich on a crossaint with avocado... it just didn't work. It was way, way oily/greesey, and the sandwich slid out of the sandwich after every bit. Fries were good... nice place, so will go back to try something different.
2012-02-15,4,This is my go-to neighborhood place. The food is always great and the wine hits the spot. Jeff is an entertaining bar tender who gets to know his customers too. Bonus: they do wine tastings, usually once a month, and always have some delicious wines.
2012-01-29,5,Been going to this place for years. Brunch is fantastic! I'm a huge fan of the olive spread that they serve with bread for regular meals. The place is very cozy and and has a great vibe to it. Great place for drinks. Nice wine selection too.
2012-01-19,5,By far the best place to have a great meal in Hoboken. They have a friendly staff & casual atmosphere. You can come here & have a delicious fish special & watch the nightly game. They have tasy nightly specials & always have more than 1 fish special to choose from. The chef has definitely perfected the art of making sauces!!! I cannot think of another place I'd like to eat that would top this place in Hoboken. It definatley is the best secret in town!!!
2011-12-20,2,Not as special as I wanted it to be as I am a neighbor. We went here for brunch. The service was more casual than the price led us to be. The food was very safe basic American brunch. There is no reason for me to come back here, even though the small cute neighborhood feel makes me want to.
2011-11-26,4,Dinner on Sat night when place opened with the kids.  Consistently good as always -my wife and I almost always eat off the nightly specials menu (Beef stroganoff and leg of lamb tonight).  Kids split chicken and fries.  One of our standbys.
2011-11-11,4,Hoboken Foodie is happy to have returned to Court Street.It has been over 10 years since I've dined at this restaurant and for that........Shame on me!!When we walked in it all started to come back to me. The place has it all going on, a great bar scene and in the rear a cozy and terrific dining room.Upon arrival the hostess told us there would be a 40 minute wait (and she was pretty close) so we ordered some beverages at the bar. The bartender was a bit slow in getting to us but I have to cut him some slack as he was the only mixologist in the place.The place was humming!We took our seats in the dining room and our server came by to welcome us and take a drink order. They brought out the bread and butter along with a tapenade that was as good as I remember it.I started out with the Oysters Rockefeller that were good, not great but good. I followed with a ceasar salad that was also good. For my entree I had a shrimp and lobster dish that was served over papardelle. Now here's where it gets very good, this meal was outstanding! The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the lobster was as tender as tender could be.They could have put my plate back on the shelf when I was done because it was licked clean!For desert the table shared a chocolate banana cake that was very nice.Our server was great with a very good sense of humor as we ribbed her a bit. She was proud to mention the fact that they serve Folgers coffee and I must admit even that was really good.So in closing I must say that I will not wait nearly as long before I come back to this place.And that's all I have to say about that!
2011-10-23,3,We ordered lobster special.  If it's not completely overcooked like ours it would be a great value.  Prices on sammies not too bad like some under $7 which you never see anymore but my 14oz pint of german beer was $8.  That is a joke, this is Hoboken and this is not a fancy place but a pub.  Good atmosphere otherwise and if they didnt gouge  me on a mini pint, I would go more regularly.  Some places shoot themselves in the foot...
2011-09-27,3,Been here twice now -- once for drinks and once for dinner. It's a great place for subdued drinks with a friend or date. Court Street is tucked away on... well, Court Street, so it's off the popularly-beaten path of Washington Street.Dinner here is good, but pretty basic. The menu is quite large, but it seems like typical pub fare -- burgers, salads, and entrees. My beef burgundy stew over egg noodles was hearty but plain. My friend's Popeye salad, however, came with a stunningly huge portion of chicken, which is rarely something you see anymore.I was looking forward to trying out the prix fixe menu, but we arrived at 6:10pm and the prix fixe ends at 6pm. Really? 6pm?While the food seemed pretty basic, I would definitely recommend Court Street as a nice place for chill drinks on a Friday evening.
2011-08-11,4,This place is fantastic on so many levels. They have an extensive wine list and the woman in charge is very good at recommending good wine pairings with dinner. I love trying their specials, but the best on ei've had so far is the fresh trout. And if you are in the area for their Sunday bunch special, I would HIGHLY recommend it. It is one of my favorite things and its very affordable. As far as the ambiance, there's a long dark wood bar in the front room and a sit down dinning area in the back. Its very homey and almost has the feel of walking into a friendly pub at first. Many good meals and drinks there.
2011-08-10,3,A favorite place of my mother and brother who live in Hoboken, so a group of five of us went for our version of the "family dinner". Went at 5:45 because there's a prix fixe dinner menu before 6 weekdays... and we're that kind of family. $17.95 gets you three courses: appetizer, entree, and dessert . And, the menu is QUITE extensive. Plus there's good bread with butter (margerine?) and olive tampenade that I thought was overly processed, and curiously a little "fishy". My four dining companions LOVED their dishes. My 13 year old son ate every last bite of his beef burgandy and rated it "excellent", so I'm feeling like perhaps I ordered wrong. It started out well enough. The soup of the day, chilled tomato avacado (essentially gazpacho.... And EXCELLENT gazpacho at that) with chunks of avacado on top was the perfect summer soup. I could eat that soup every day and never tire of it!The entree, however, I tired of before I was a third of the way through. Angel hair pasta with grilled chicken in a tomato basil cream sauce. Maybe I should say CREAM sauce because it was so heavy and creamy I barely tasted anything else. The pasta was al dente (sometimes difficult with angel hair), but the chicken was VERY overcooked. I was sad when I watched my table-mates devour their dishes with such glee.On to dessert....... The usual cheese cakes and parfaits and brownie sundaes, but also the "tart of the day"... made in house. This day it was apple and it was VERY good. Warm, sweet, but not too sweet.... with just a hint of almond paste in the crust.... and REAL whipped cream decorating the edges. I left a happy girl.
2011-07-22,4,I've been to Court Street for dinner (lobster night and prime rib night) and brunch. Overall, my experiences have been really positive. The food is consistently good and the menu has good selection without being overwhelming. Some of the dinner menu items might be a bit expensive, but if you're on a budget you should be able to find something. Court Street is one of the better restaurants in Hoboken.
2011-07-17,4,I had been to this place once before a long time ago but I did not realize it until I walked into the place.  The last time I was here I ordered the fish and chips which I thought was excellent. This time I came because I heard that they will have the Red Sox game on in the bar area. They had that and much more and I think I have a place where I will officially return on a frequent basis.I got in there on a Friday night and found that the place was not too crowded and that there were seats still available at the bar. The bartender was wicked cool and and after finding out that him and I were Red Sox fans, he immediately hooked me up with my frist drink. The rest of the staff was also very friendly and when they were not busy with their tables they were joking and chatting with everyone at the bar. I have to say that everyone knowing everyone or just being friendly made the atmosphere that much better.The Yuengling that I ordered on draft came out to about $4 a glass which is not a bad price for the Hoboken area. The bar looked to have a large assortment of alcohol available, so I figure they can probably make a wide variety of drinks for you.Overall I gave this place a four star rating because of the more than friendly staff, the great atmosphere, and the price of food and drinks.  I plan on going back to this place again whether it will be to grab a bite to eat of a drink. I'm happy I was able to rediscover this place.
2011-07-13,4,By far one of my fave places to eat in Hoboken.  I used to live like a block and a half away from this place, and it never disappointed.  Their drink specials/menu, to food specials and even  their regular menu.  Wow.  I love their crab cakes.  They're not overly crabby or bread crumby.  It's almost like I am in the Midatlantic region.  I always get the mashed potatoes here but you usually get a veggie side and like this whipped beet mixture.  Amazing.  I've never had anything like it.  This is a great place for a sitdown meal. But as for other places in Hoboken, I've never been given a compelling reason why I should visit here for sports event or something.
2011-05-31,1,The first time I went here I was thoroughly unimpressed, but every restaurant has bad nights and I figured that Court Street deserved a second chance.Perhaps Memorial Day Sunday was a bad night to eat out, but the only thing worse then the service was the food.  I've had better meals on an airplane.  Our waitress was rude until she dropped off the check. The lobster was astonishingly overcooked. Cooking lobster is easy. Screwing it up is difficult. Overcooking it destroys the flavor and texture of the meat. Get a kitchen timer. The seafood pasta was truly foul. The 'tomato marsala' sauce tasted like burnt ragu with too much dried oregano and no hint of marsala.  With that sauce base, its impossible to know how the seafood could have been had the sauce been even decent. Each raw oyster had bits of shell in it. Really?The jumbo shrimp were fine but not jumbo. More like 20/25 count, and definitely overpriced at $2.00 each.
2011-04-28,4,Really good food and a very nice wine list.  Weds. night is lobster night where you get a complete meal for under $20.  Worth the trip for sure!
2011-04-18,3,I had the seafood pasta. It was made with a tomato marsala sauce. It was interesting and there was a good amount of seafood. It was good. The mussels weren't so fresh though. I had 2-3 bad ones.  I still prefer regular marsala though.
2011-04-05,4,Great value for this upscale bar that's more of a restaurant than a bar.  Big interesting menu, an EXTREMELY extensive specials menu, and they pull everything off with ease.  At least, more ease than you'll have choosing what to order.  To me, it's all about the prime rib/lobster/specials menu.  They really do a nice job.The back room decor is a little too plain to be formal and too formal to be the "grill" half of "bar and grill."  Was with people wearing Yankee hats for brunch once and felt a little inappropriate (just me, not the friends actually wearing the hats).  The bar gets a good buzz and although it's not a "game destination," they do have nice TVs.
2011-03-09,4,My review is of the restaurant since I have never sat in the bar area.  I have been here twice and it is one of my favorite places in Hoboken.  I think it's one of the few places in the area where you get the most bang for your buck.  The decor is a bit plain jane so I wasn't expecting the food to be so great- I was wrong.   I have had the chicken marsala as well as the stuffed flounder (under the specials).  Each dish I thoroughly enjoyed and I have to say the waitstaff has always been pleasant and very attentive.  I think it is a solid go to for a lowkey dinner out.
2011-03-08,3,Sad day. My boyfriend and I went to Court Street a while ago and it was pretty tasty. We went on Friday and it was totally disappointing. My veal parm was way too salty (like they were at the bottom of the pot of week-old sauce), and my boyfriend was told that they didn't have the entree he ordered, was asked to pick something new, and then was brought the original order not to his requested temperature. Also, it was completely coated in black pepper - ick.We had such a high hopes... Too bad... I may try to let them redeem themselves with that crazy lobster special though.
2011-03-02,5,My favorite restaurant in hoboken, for sure. great ambience, delicious food, friendly staff- what more can you ask for? sure, it's not the cheapest place in the city but it keeps out the wild, obnoxious crowds that you'd find downtown. i certainly don't mind payin a few extra bucks to have a more cozy, low-key dinner and drinks. the bartenders are really friendly and always willing to offer a food/drink recommendation which are typically spot-on. Probably not the best place for a first date as it's kinda quiet and intimate. Def recommended for dinner with parents, significant other, or a small group of friends.Try the french onion soup, portobello sandwich, and/or any of the daily specials-they're always amazing!!!
2011-02-16,4,Court Street has always been consistent.  Its a little pricy, but the food is worth the price.  My friends are big fans of the brunch and the couple dinner items I have eaten were great.  I love the bartender (even though he's a Red Sox fan), especially because he makes a great gin martini.Drink specials are rare, but that does keep out the "unsavory masses".  I know I can come here and have a very low key night out with my friends.
2011-02-10,3,'twas a fun night with delicious food (including dessert!) but only sub-par service. more of a wine bar than a tavern, for sure. we spotted the only table left in the bar area at the front of the restaurant (there is more formal seating in the back) and parked ourselves. there are a handful of HDTVs, the perfect amount for the small setting. our waitress was cute but she had no idea what she was talking about - which was kind of fine, i wasn't looking to be impressed. we ordered chicken/cheese quesadillas (yum!) and then our own separate desserts to share, naturally. and based on these three items, i can't imagine anything on this menu being bad. in fact, i can't rave enough about the desserts! lots of seafood for the seafood lover, but i'm not one of those. it did end up being a more expensive night than either of us had planned for so when i go back again (and i certainly will be back because that apple pie a la mode was amazing...) i'll be more prepared. sidenote: they host wine tastings on saturdays!
2011-01-20,3,I really wanted to love Court Street. Our first dining experience was great - the food was amazing. The delicious olive dip they serve with their bread is what sticks out the most to me. However, on subsequent trips, our enthusiasm waned. There was a definite decline in the quality of the food. On our last visit, he had the misfortune of being one of the later tables in the restaurant and we were practically rushed through our dinner - no bread, no water refills and the busboy was practically trying to take our plates while we were still eating. Needless to say, we have not been back since.
2011-01-20,3,3.5 stars is exactly the right rating. I've only been here for drinks and for snacks at the bar, but I've been numerous times. I really like the staff here and the ambiance, but the prices on drinks are just too pricey for me. All of the martinis are $10 and, to my knowledge, they never have any specials. The best I can do here is a glass of wine for $7.95, which is a bummer. The soup is good, the motz sticks are respectable, I've heard the wings are decent. I just wish they'd have a good drink special once in a while!!
2011-01-16,3,I always enjoy a visit to Court Street.  Its not loud, its not trendy and its not too pricey.Its a very comfortable restaurant with a large menu.  I wish I could say the food was fabulous -- but its just slight above average.   While I normally visit a few times a year, I happen to be here twice within the last month.   On one visit, my entree -- a special - was delicious.   That same visit we split some dessert too, which was fabulous.  The last visit however was not great.  I ordered a chicken marsala, but they gave me a chicken francaise that they threw some mushrooms on.  Had we not been pressed for time, I would have sent it back..Nice atmosphere and nice service -- I'll continue to eat here.  I won't have expectations for the greatest meal in the world, but I know I'll enjoy myself.
2011-01-14,4,Great food and a great prix fix menu. Court Street is a nice quiet restaurant that has a lot to offer.
2011-01-12,5,This is my favorite restaurant in the state of NJ!  The regular menu offers a ton of choices and the daily specials always have more than one great option to choose from.  The wine list is exceptional, both in it's breadth and it's pricing.  They offer very good wines by the glass, but I always go back to their Shiraz -- either the Two Hands or the Rolf Binder.  Our son lives in Hoboken, so we go here once a month anyway -- definitely our go-to place.  The female wait staff is great.Update 3/29/11: This place is still the best!  Excellent duck breast special.  Profireroles are great.  Wine list abounds with great choices at good prices.  Try the Matua Pinot from Central Otago.Update 6/8/12: We've been here several times since our last update and it continues to please. Tonight they were out of the lamb shank so I went for the osso buco, which was excellent.  The chorizo and shrimp appetizer was almost too much.  The lamb stew and the pasta were also good.  The Two Hands Gnarly Dudes Shiraz is outstanding and reasonably priced at $40.  Our son prefers the Hoegarten.Update 11/24/12: We keep coming back.  Tonight there were six of us including my brother, sister-in-law and nephew.  We had 6 different entrees (lamb stew, pot roast, beef bourginon, snapper, scallops and fettucini).  All were very good -- that's what I'm talking about!  Blueberry pie and profiteroles for dessert.  Two bottles of Gnarly Dudes (only $30 with the weekend wine special).Update 4/21/13: Finally made it for brunch.  It was great!  The croissant sandwiches and the omelet were very good -- tasty and plenty.  The mimosas were only $12 per pitcher, but mostly ice.Update 1/13/14: Long overdue update.  We've been there numerous times, but just went again for "restaurant week".  All the favorites still on the menu.  We "mixed it up" and had a Rolf Binder Grenache/Syrah (stick with the Two Hands).  Still our favorite!
2010-12-31,4,Cute, cozy place for some of their delicious french onion soup on a cold fall night.
2010-10-30,2,Nice quiet bar - decent Lobster special on Wednesdays but I've just never had a great meal at this place.It's got a great scene though....so I want to like it, but just cant seem to get on board.
2010-10-17,4,Cozy and relaxing.Arrived somewhat late for dinner last night, no reservations. Though they had run out of two of the specials, they were apologetic and offered alternative suggestions.Though we were late, we weren't rushed. I had veal piccata which was well prepared and tasty. Ditto for wife's Shrimp and Lobster over angel hair pasta.   Entrees were preceded by mixed salad with caramelized walnuts and pears...very fresh andtasty.The wine list is outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed a wonderful Rioja Tempranillo and my wife had a lovely crisp Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. The choices are thoughtful, the ratings and descriptions are provided...and wine snobbery is absent. Prices are very reasonable.A great ending to a hectic day with staff that were courteous and helpful. Good food, great wine, nice staff. The room is smallish and the sports bar does break into applause, so not a quiet haven. But a large selection of well prepared upscale food in a relaxed and casual atmosphere will bring us back.
2010-10-11,5,Whenever I feel like having an old man meal, I go to Court Street. I like their wine selection and old fashioned menu and dining room. It's really comfy. In the summer we did Lobsterfest and it was great.Recently we went back for an old man meal, my husband had the lamb and I had a steak. Yum. Also we tried the Profiteroles for dessert and they are RIDICULOUSLY good.So good that we went back like two nights later just to sit at the bar and have appetizers, drinks, and of course, more profiteroles. I had the clams casino that time and they were great, and seriously.. have you even seen clams casino on a menu since like 1987? I love it, and I bet a lot of old men do too.
2010-09-06,4,Went to lobster fest, not for me but for the boy. He loved it and loved the price! I had great salmon and for dessert had creme brule. Yum! We were a little under dressed, but now we know. Staff was excellent, will definitely go again. Hit up the sale!
2010-09-06,4,Second time here was just as good as the last time. Court Street has a very nice atmosphere and the food is excellent and reasonably priced. My girlfriend had the Penne with lobster and shrimp and I had the confit of duck with mango sauce and mashed potatoes. Both of us were extremely satisfied. Highly recommended.
2010-08-15,3,A friend picked this restaurant for their diverse menu as the spot where we would celebrate her sister's impending nuptials. The bride-to-be is a vegetarian and some of the other attendants are picky eaters so the menu was perfect to suit the party-goers. Their menu is sizeable while remaining fairly priced and running the gamut from tasty appetizers to pastas, fresh fish to quesadillas. We passed on appetizers because we had all feasted on the complimentary bread and olive tapenade which was surprisingly tasteful. I started my meal with an arugula and goat cheese salad that was really good, the lemon garlic dressing was nice and light and was a nice contrast to the bite and peppery taste of the arugula. Dinner's ordered at the table ranged from short ribs to swai, and pasta with sweet sausage to chicken parmigiana. I had a portabella sandwich that I was less than thrilled with, the mozzarella cheese to mushroom proportion was out of whack so I felt like I was eating a cheese sandwich. There supposedly were roasted red peppers in the sandwich though they were sparsely intermingled. My meal was relatively bland, maybe if it had some kind of a balsamic sauce or some type of seasoning it would have been better. The reviews from around the table were all fairly positive though so maybe I was the only one with a lackluster dish. The restaurant itself is decently decorated. There is definitely room for improvement, but it has a nice cozy feel with floor to ceiling windows even if they do look out at the cobblestone alleyway. The setup is a little awkward as you have to walk through the bar to get to the dining room, the two rooms have completely different feels to them. The dining room at one point became excessively loud to the point that we were yelling to talk to each other and we were only a table of 6 seated 3 and 3 across from each other. The music wasn't loud and the bar was on the quiet side even with sporting events on the TV so I'm not sure how the noise elevated itself to such extreme level. All in all our time at Court Street was very pleasant, our waitress was fairly attentive given the number of tables that she had for the evening and my water glass was never empty which is a huge plus. If I had my choice between restaurants, I don't know that this one would top my list, but it was perfectly adequate for our group and the time together was enjoyed by all.
2010-08-08,4,When you walk into Court Street, if there early, you can have a nice and peaceful meal. Come a little later, and expect a bit of a crowd. This spick and span eatery sort of fills its duty- you get food that is as good as you pay for. The service is off and on, sometimes you will have a good time and sometimes you won't. They have a nice bar that has a different ambiance to it. Somebody could probably go by themselves and have dinner without filling awkward. Filled with people of all ages and a reasonably large menu which includes a prie fixe, Court Street is a fine restaurant.
2010-07-04,3,Occupies a decent space slightly off Washington.  Nice bar area in the front with a homey yet classy dining area in the back.  Service was less than stellar (took a loooong time for the waitress to take our order and she was not too chipper) but also not horrendous.Foodnalysis:- complimentary bread with butter and olive spread - I don't even like olives and thought the spread was rather tasty.- Veal Scalloppine - generous portion of veal covered in mozzarella, served with a side of homemade linguine.- New England Crab Cakes -  two large crab cakes, we opted for french fries which were pretty tasty.  Decent, not great.- Sangria - also decent, not great.  Fair wine selection, though.The Bottom Line:Nice dinner spot but based on other reviews, would give brunch a try.
2010-06-10,3,Like coming here for the Lobster Fest Special during the summer. 1 1/4 lb. Maine Lobster with Soup or Salad, Potato and Vegetable$19.95!2 - 1 1/4 Lobsters $29.95!Classy place with a more mature bar tone. Your not gonna see many Steven's kids coming here to drink. But they still have good drinks and plenty of TVs at the bar to watch your game. The high tables to the side of the bar are great for a quick bite/watching the game while you eat.Dinning room is great for groups. I recommend this place to anyone who asks about it.A solid dinning experience every time. Nothing out of this world, but solid food put out everytime i've eaten here.
2010-05-25,2,The food was good, but the service was piss-poor. Having worked in restaurants in the past, I cut servers slack but the staff at Court Street was inattentive, rude and sloppy in serving a 7-top.From only taking half the table's drink order and rolling her eyes when we asked if the rest of the table could order drinks to not even offering one person at the table a drink, I can understand a rough night, but once the bill came and the cheer returned, I knew her attitude was a farce.I'll give Court Street another shot, some day, but for now I'll pass.
2010-05-12,4,Had dinner there last night with the boy - ordered stuffed portabella mushrooms, potato crusted halibut, and broiled scallops in a lemon butter sauce. Both entrees came with a side of veggies (green beans) and potatoes. The food was good. I'd like to come back to try something else on their menu. The atmosphere was cute. It looked like the inside of someone's dining room. painted walls, wrap around molding. It felt homey. Their service - we accidentally got another table's score card with our bill. They wrote, "service just wasn't there" and I couldn't help but to agree. Our waiter was practically deaf - we had to repeat everything 3 or 4 times. Nothing spectacular - I have to say that service was just, blah.
2010-04-09,4,Probably last place in hoboken you can get an awesome burger for under $8!!  Very good dinners in dining room. Great portion for Great Price.  I love this place :-)
2010-03-08,4,My wife's friends' suggested this place for brunch so we strolled in about noon on Sunday.  If anybody knows Hoboken, they are infamous for their brunch scene.  On summer weekends, you can drive down Washington and catch all the Hobokenites eating their "Brunch" on sidewalk tables.  Me, I really don't get it.  I'm here so I might as well see what all the fuss is about eating a meal between breakfast and lunch.I ordered the "Best" burger in Hoboken and the wife ordered Steak and Eggs.  Pretty sure this wasn't the "Best" burger in Hoboken, not even sure it beats out any other burger in Hudson County.  While I got the most dry and tasteless item on the menu, my wife picked a winner.  The little bit that I got from her sure made an impression on me.  Moist and flavorful.  Although I got a bad burger, the steak stood out as a great steak from Hoboken.  Maybe they should claim to be the "Best" steak instead of burger.  They might be closer to the truth.
2010-02-09,4,If I was able to give a half star more I would. Everything I have ever ordered here have been good or very good. The only thing holding me back from giving this place 5 stars is the fact they don't really do anything great!  Monday are the time I most frequent the bar for Prime Rib night.  I have been told by friends that I really need to check out Wednesday for the Lobster night.  The Saturday wine tastings and daily price fix dinners are some of the best deals in town.  The wine list in general is impressive for Hoboken and very reasonably priced.  There's a dining room in the back for larger larger groups but if I'm out by myself or with one other person I always end up eating at the bar or the tables buy the bar.
2010-01-31,2,Went here last night with a group of 6.  I had a pasta special of lobster and shrimp over angel hair with a lemon sauce.  The seafood was cooked well, but the sauce was completely bland and oily.  Yuck.  I think it would benefit them to simplify the menu and do only a few things well.  They don't quite know if they want to be a steakhouse, seafood joint, or something in between.  I probably won't go back.
2009-12-20,5,I normally go there during the week for a late night dinner and sit at the bar. The food is always fresh and the large specials menu is always changing. They have everything from bar food to lobster and steak. The waitstaff and bartenders are a ton of fun and always bring the whole bar in to conversations. They have some of the best french onion soup I have ever tasted, even when I get take out. I also highly recommend the beef burgendy and the pot pie if you can catch it on the specials menu.
2009-12-07,5,I have only eaten in the bar area of the restaurant which is cool because there are flat screen tv's showing games.   The seats in the dinning area looks homey, but I prefer the seats by the window next to the cobble street.  They've got a good selection of vino, and their food is unexpectantly yummy.  I've had their pan seared bass and Steak.  The daily special is of great value and the service has been very nice every time I've been there.
2009-11-29,4,Pleasantly surprised with my recent Brunch experience at Court Street! I was expecting an average meal, but it was actually quite good. The service was great - the wait staff is sort of disheveled (obvously no uniform requirement), but i dug the laid back feel. Plus - half of our party was 30 minutes late, but we weren't pressured at all to order (it was around 12:30pm on a Sunday). The drinks were good ($5 champagne, $6 Bloody's and Mimosas, $12 pitchers). Very comfortable dining room (the room, not the chairs, which are small and hard). The food was nice - french toast (just OK), homemade corn beef hash (awesome), steak and eggs w/ hollandaise (perfectly cooked steak), penne w/ vodka (pink, creamy, delish), the cheeseburger - all received above-average marks. The bar scene looked great - a nice spacious long dark wood-finished bar, great football-watching scene (about 5 or 6 large flat screens). I look forward to going back for the bar scene, and to sample some apps!
2009-09-05,4,After a long day of fishing with friends, I came home craving shellfish so I did a Yelp search and discovered Court Street.  What a find!  An excellent menu full of seafood and steaks, standard pub food, and an extensive wine list.  I ordered the crab legs, which were great and surprisingly not that expensive.  We will absolutely be going back to Court Street and maybe even experience their wine tasting night or their Wednesday 'lobster fest' which were both advertised on their menu.
2009-07-02,3,I just need to know what kind of coffee they serve. Their house coffee is exceptional.
2009-04-17,2,Went there for dinner on a weekday night.  There was no wait.  I ordered the lobster special and my husband got a pasta.  The lobster didn't take long to come.  I was missing all the lobsters in Maine and was very happy to see the red crustacean in front of me.  But when I dug into it, it was nothing like!  The lobster was COLD inside.  I don't know whether they just undercooked the thing, or they just heated up an old one. But it wasn't good at all.  My husband's pasta was cooked, but just mediocre.  Given all the choices, I don't think we are going back there.
2009-04-05,4,I truly enjoy Court Street. It's casual yet upscale all at the same time. Their menu is so wide, it's great to go there with people who have different tastes and all are in the mood for different things. It's a little small, but worth the wait. They don't take reservations for less than parties of five or more, so you may be waiting, but you can enjoy a seat at the bar. Court Street is situated on a cute cobble stone street in Hoboken, just off Washington Street and has a nice atmosphere. It's great for friends or family. Food is delicious; I have never had a bad meal. Brunch is fantastic and their king crab legs special (which is usually on the menu), steaks and fish are some of the best in town ...you WILL NOT be disappointed, or left hungry!!
2009-02-13,4,Great little spot...nice prefixed early bird menu during the week.  The mixed drinks aren't the best though, stick with a beer.
2009-02-03,4,The bar upfront is a perfect spot to grab a few drinks and catch up with a friend.  There are a good amount of HD TV's which is great for watching sports games..
2008-12-09,3,good pub style place to hang out on a relaxed night. I recently had dinner there with a few friends and was not very impressed with any of the food that was ordered. I would not return for dinner, but would have drinks and maybe an appetizer at the bar. the food is very affordable if that makes a difference..
2008-12-09,4,I had brunch at Court Street on Sunday and I thought it was great! You get Irish Soda bread and  fruit cup before your meal and there were a lot of different options on the menu. Of course, I had to get one of the most expensive dishes (which was only $16) the Seafood Benedict which was delicious! It had shrimp and scallops and really yummy broccoli. We also had a liter of Pointsettas which is champagne and cranberry juice - a nice change from plain old mimosas.Service was fine, not exceptional. They never offered to refill our coffee which was fine since I was more into the booze anyway.The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars it because my friend was being lame and didn't want to drink that much (not Court Street's fault). But, I also felt like it was a little stuffy, not the kind of place I would want to get wasted at on a Sunday afternoon. Maybe it would be better for a brunch with my Grandma.Either way, the food was awesome and reasonably priced.
2008-09-19,4,Court Street is one of my favorite places to go in Hoboken.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is usually exceptional.  Also (I don't know if I should mention this since it might be harder for me to reserve a spot) but they have wine tastings once a month which are awesome.  It's $30 and you get to try at least 10 different kinds of wine.  There's nothing like having a substantial buzz by early afternoon.The only downfall is their brunch which isn't very impressive.  Dinner is much better in terms of the quality of food and the options.
2008-09-10,4,The food here is good and the wine menu is very good. They do offer a good number of reserve wines that you can order by the glass. There were a number of really good buys on their wine list. We dine here at least twice a month and you don't need a reservation, but you might need to wait maybe 20 mins to get a table if you go on a Fri/Sat night.
2008-03-07,3,Court Street has a surprisingly upscale atmosphere...However, the food is nothing spectacular.As you enter this large brick building, you enter a small, dark pub as you would expect based on the exterior decor.  However, there is an oddly matched elegant dining room just past the bar area.  The dining room is serviced by college age servers that are extremely inattentive and inefficient.  My friends and I went to Court Street for brunch the other day.  We were enticed by the free individual fruit cups and delicious Irish soda bread slices.  But we were then forced to wait almost an hour for our meals.  Also, I found a chunk of paper or something floating in my horrible coffee.  When I finally got my meal, the Kate's Popeye Salad (Fresh Spinach mixed with Cucumbers, Apples, Celery, Walnuts, and Onion with a light Lemon Garlic Dressing), I found it tasty, but uninspired.  My friends also found their meals quite ordinary, but the large mimosas (served in pint glasses) received applause.I hear the dinner is delicious, so I would consider going back to try that instead.
2007-11-29,3,I was alittle confused when I walked in...was it a bar was it a restaurant?At first glance it seem like a nice corner pub then towards the back is the dinning room that is like walking into another building comletely.  The front bar is in typical irish pub style; old photos on the wall, alcohol posters, and dark wood and lighting.  Walk to the back dinning area and it is a plain and small white room with absolutely no appeal.  The very small tables leave little privacy between neighbors.  The food was pretty good and made up a bit for the atmosphere,  we started with a sampling appetizer of shellfish.  I'm not a big fan, but I did enjoy the way it was prepared.  Dinner I was boring and just got a pasta dish with sausage(very tasty), but my friend got the rabbit(poor little thing).  He loved it, I wasn't very impressed.  Overall the food was very good but I dont think I would return unless I was staying up front at the bar which looks like it gets very crowed later.
2007-02-12,3,In more than 10 years in Hoboken, I went for only the 2nd time this past Sunday to try the brunch, which was good, but not great.Here are the pluses: - Really nice long bar with a relaxed and cozy vibe - Great service - Nice selection for brunch at really reasonable pricesHere are the minuses: - Very average food - Absolutely no atmosphere in the dining roomIn summary, it was a great value for brunch and the good service made it a relaxed meal with friends.  I'd like to go back one evening and hang out at the bar.
