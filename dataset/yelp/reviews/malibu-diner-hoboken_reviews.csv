2021-04-10,1,1- Bathrooms (both), were dirty. Over flowing trashcans and trash on floor.2- Floors in dining room were dirty. Trash in the isles and under tables.3- Tray that holds ketchup, salt/pepper were filthy and not wiped down for some time.4- Food took forever to come to the table, fries were barley warm and soggy/limp. We ordered extra crispy.....5- Plenty of meat in my Ruben sandwich, thank you! We will not return to have a meal here.
2021-04-09,1,Horrible.  I was one of three people here at 10pm. My burger came out within 5 minutes but ... cold? Weird. Never got my water despite asking multiple times.  Crappy diner. Waste of calories.
2021-03-01,5,They have a chicken carbonara that's basically chicken Alfredo with bacon. This might be in my top 5 favorite dishes of all time. If I was on death row and had to choose my last meal.... this might be it lol. They serve great portions, have a wonderful staff, and the dessert is off the chain. Every time I'm here, I leave with some chocolate cake. I've been here quite a few times the past 2 years and have never left disappointed. Malibu Diner deserves a lot more love than it receives. This place is great
2021-02-06,5,What can I say? It's a really basic diner, with great food and great people. Been coming here for a million years. I can remember sitting at the counter while they grilled a burger right in front of you. Feels very Covid safe-you don't have people waiting indoor violating rules, like you do at other places.  On top of that they had a parking lot!
2020-12-07,4,First time trying this place and it was overall pretty good! Came here for a quick meal after church and didn't want to stay long. Food came out fairly fast, service was friendly, and food was good! I got the French toast, very good- fresh fruit. My boyfriend got the banana walnut pancakes. They were really good! Chocolate milk was good too! Only give it 4 because there weren't a lot of combo breakfast choices which is what I love about a diner usually, but it was no biggie. Will come back for a quick cheap meal!
2020-10-11,5,Very cute establishment. Clean super friendly staff. Nice walk from the harbor (10 mins) 1.1 miles from the Lincoln Harbor Tunnel. Open 24 hrs. Covered outdoor seating. Lots of menu choices.
2020-09-20,1,If I could give this place ZERO stars I would.  We asked for water 4 times and finally asked the owner at the front desk. His incredibly rude answer was quote I get you water when I get you water.  Server had no menu knowledge and was also unable to simply get us water.
2020-08-08,5,Great food and service. I've been going there for years and have yet to receive poor service nor a meal I thoroughly enjoyed.
2020-08-06,5,Ladies and gentleman...the Malibu!Seriously, there are rumors that this place has an expiration date due to (what else?) construction in Hoboken...if they get rid of this legendary establishment, you are going to have one angry Hudson County girl on your hands.The Malibu was always a staple in my family. We've been coming to this diner for years, and the food and service is always consistent. It's a solid 'local' diner in the middle of the now-bustling city of Hoboken. Pre-COVID, we would come here for lunch and dinner (great specials, by the way) just to get out of the house. During COVID, our love and respect for the Malibu has only gotten stronger. Since reopening, their food has been just as delicious (if not, more so for some reason) and more importantly, FAST. We have been doing pick-up (sandwiches, mostly. They have a lot to choose from!), and the food is hot and ready in around 15 minutes. It's like magic! Also, they have set up a cute picnic area, so if outdoor dining is your thing, and you want to east somewhere casual, fast, and yummy, you HAVE to try the Malibu.Some of my favorite dishes are:French Dip Sandwich - a diner classic, but they do it a bit differently at the Malibu. It's served on a kaiser roll with onions. Honestly, just simple diner goodness! The jus can't be beat.Portabella wrap - a great vegetarian option! It's arugula, roasted red peppers, grilled portabellas, and feta cheese, drizzled with balsamic glazed. I usually get it with grilled chicken added and extra feta 'cause that's my business...Santa Fe Wrap - Grilled chicken, chipotle mayo, rice, cheddar cheese. Need I say more? Egg Skillet - OH MY GOD! My favorite thing at the Malibu. If you are a breakfast lover, a potato lover, an egg lover, a greasy food lover...this thing is HEAVEN SENT. It's a mix of breakfast meat of your choice (I go with ham), diced potatoes, peppers, onions, and drenched in melty cheese, topped with two eggs done to your liking. (Come through, sunny side up!) And! It comes sizzling on a hot plate. SIZZLING! It is ultimate breakfast comfort food OR ultimate drunk people food, your choice. Speaking of, I know it will be a while before we are able to do this again thanks to COVID, but...Before COVID, the Malibu is open 24/7. You know what that means? You can come here after a night of drinking and get that sizzling egg skillet. Seriously! Every time we have come here at 3 in the morning, the wait staff is always super pleasant and accommodating to all the patrons that have spent the night dancing. The are the real MVPs! Do yourself a favor - when COVID is over, and we all go out dancing again, and when you get kicked out of the club because of last call, take an Uber and meet me at the Malibu and we'll eat the egg skillet together. All in all - the Malibu is a fantastic staple in Hoboken, and you're missing out if you don't give it a shot.
2020-07-22,5,Glad to support this business during COVID. Friendly staff and good breakfast food. I'll definitely be ordering from here again. Enjoy!
2020-07-08,4,Solid Diner. The food is solid, the service is good and the staff is attentive. My food is always hot and comes out quickly. Never had an issue here. It's my go-to diner.
2020-06-11,5,Pleasant and patient service over the phone for delivery during quarantine. Fast delivery and everything was packaged wonderfully, cooked perfectly, and still hot! Really great diner food!
2020-04-24,5,Stopped by on 4/24/20 for a takeout order... First time here in a while...Cheeseburger deluxe was awesome...
2020-01-29,1,My first time at this diner and Im very disappointed and WILL NOT be back. The server was nasty and had attitude. My boyfriend asked for coffee  and I asked for water. She brought his coffee before bringing water and then never came back. I had to remind her when she came to grab our order that I had been sitting there (for over 10 minutes btw) without anything to drink. I am a server myself so I understand slow service sometimes but there was only 3 other tables. The place is empty and when I asked to bring the water before the order she rolled her eyes. When she came back she had attitude "Are you ready?!". You give me attitude because Im  thirsty? Thats horrible for a server. For the rest of the time she was very smiley and quick to bring my boyfriend extra coffee while im sitting there with no water.  Then the food was bad. I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap and it was dry and 90% lettuce. He ordered a burger and sent it back because it was nasty.
2020-01-29,2,Wow, I use to come here all the time and it's been awhile. My time back wasnt what I expected. I ordered a burger and my wife ordered a chicken Cesar wrap. I told the waiter well done, the burger came red and there was barley any chicken in the wrap, it was basically a lettuce wrap. Service was horrible and this is the last time coming to this diner.
2020-01-26,3,Typical diner: its menu is a volume offering dozens and dozens of dishes. Sandwiches, burgers, soups, hot entrees, gyros. All is done in a middle of the road style, solid, not fancy. I've gone half a dozen times in the last year. Eggs tend to be overcooked, so I ask for my omelette to be soft. Chicken can also be overcooked, but at times it's quite good. This last time I went I ordered their oriental salad, which turned out quite nice. Coffee is good. Service is friendly, but can be spotty if the wait staff is in a mood to flirt with customers at the counter or to kibbitz with each other. Conveniently located, has parking. Inconsistent.
2020-01-01,3,Good.We've lived in Hoboken for years and always wondered about this place.  No time like the present to try for brunch on New Years.It was packed (likely because other places in town are closed, as are the grocery stores, it was 1pm, and Most of the crowd looked hungover).  We got quick service and our food came out in less 10-15 minutes despite a line out the door.We sat at the counter--it was just me and my husband, so we fortunately found 2 seats side by side.  Counter is the move because it's first come first served.Our waitress was fine-nothing to write home about.  The food was decent, not amazing (think solid diner  food).  My husband had buttermilk pancakes (3, decent size, light, fluffy, not much taste to them, so they definitely needed syrup and likely came from a boxed mix), and I had an omelet with bacon, onion, tomatoes and cheddar).  I swapped the home fires (which looked dry as I saw them pass by on someone's plate) for French fries which were golden and crispy.  They forgot to ask me what toast I wanted and never brought any (it was fine-they were busy).  Coffee was mediocre at best-tasted like it had been left on the burner for a while.  All in all I'd say it's exactly what you'd expect from diner food:  lots of options, big portions, no frills, and a strong mediocre.Worth a shot for an average inexpensive breakfast you can get fast.
2019-12-24,4,Came back here with a buddy as the convenience and 24/7 time can't be beat. Was pleasantly surprised. The waitstaff and owner that rung us up were all very nice. We had the (HUGE) buttermilk pancakes with Reese's peanut butter and bananas, Veggie burger, and also a cappuccino (yep HUGE portions again and thankfully they have almond milk for the lactose intolerant).A good diner spot with its own parking lot (unheard of in Hoboken).
2019-12-16,4,Ended up coming here on a Saturday evening and it was pretty empty. Parking was a little concerning as it was so close to the road and basically on the sidewalk. As soon as we entered, we didn't have much faith that the food would be good, solely based on inside appearance but let me tell you, Malibu Diner was delicious. I had the veggie burger and my friend had a cheeseburger with fries. I would love to come here again.
2019-12-16,4,Super easy and causal diner. They have all the essentials- good omelets and hash browns during breakfast. Never had to wait too long, even when the restaurant is busy.
2019-12-05,1,Over Priced Typical Diner Food... I Ordered Steak And Home-fries And It Was Horrible.. The Steak Had ZERO Flavor As Well As The Home-fries.. A Total Waste Of Money/Breakfast. I Threw It In The Garbage!
2019-11-05,4,Delicious diner located on 14th street in Hoboken. Ample seating inside and parking lot outside. Both pluses for Hoboken dining. Large menu with lots of options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Love the farmers omelette and Greek salad.
2019-10-18,1,I was here on October 18th 2019 just for the simple reason that I am working in the area of Hoboken and it's convenient to dine here as they have parking.  That being said, I feel so sorry for the owner of this diner. You are being represented so badly by your staff that its a disgrace.   The waiters and waitresses are not  friendly. They serve you dessert and  the soup plate is still on your table while you're getting dessert. No one comes to clear your plates off the table not even before you're leaving. Service is horrible and with an attitude. The food is just as bad. I ordered the veal marsala and I couldn't cut the veal with a steak knife. It was that hard! Just horrible horrible horrible food and service. God I wish  the owner would read this because you're in such a prime location that this diner has so much potential to be better but with this stuff and with the food they're serving I don't think it ever will be even though you have parking and it's convenient.  When  I am in the area, I think I'm going to start going somewhere else. I can't do this anymore with this diner. I have tried to come back and give them many chances to improve their service and their food but it just gets worse instead of better. So terribly disappointed with this place.
2019-09-20,4,After helping someone move into their Hoboken, N.J. apartment i went the Malibu Diner. Hoboken is a freaking nightmare to park in. Malibu, fortunately, has a parking lot!
2019-09-13,4,The best place for grabbing yummiest breakfast in a very reasonable price.I just love the bacon and sausage skillet with the free coffee.
2019-09-09,3,This diner has good food. I love the pancakes and the reuben is great. I frequently stop here when I'm in Hoboken. One of the waitresses though is cranky most of the time and won't apologize if she takes forever. Otherwise a great place
2019-08-30,4,My husband LOVE this dinner - food is good - Parking - CleanIt's a nice upscale Diner
2019-08-22,5,Just ate at the Malibu Diner. I ordered their pancakes with fresh fruits (strawberry and blueberry) and it was amazing. The portion was larger than I was expecting which was good because as it turns out I was very hungry. The pancakes were freshly made, warmly served and tasted really good along with syrup. It's going to be my evening sugary cheat meal once in a while :p
2019-06-21,5,We had the best waitress named Hallie at Malibu Diner. She was beyond personable and really made our experience memorable. We are literally planning to come back in a few weeks to hear about how her upcoming trip went. Our personal faves to eat: The Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken is amazing. The dressing is light and creamy. Freshest ingredients. A must try. Oh, and it comes with a soup to start. The burgers are always delicious. Goat cheese and bacon for the win here. And you can substitute the regular fries for spicy waffle fries. Just sayin.
2019-06-18,5,I had such a positive experience here at Malibu Diner thanks to our waitress Halie!! She was extremely attentive and made sure everything came out exactly how I wanted. I have a dairy allergy so sometimes it is a headache going out to eat! Thank you Halie!!!
2019-06-05,5,I walk by this place all the time and today I finally tried it.  The server was really friendly and attentive.  I ordered the Western Omelet.  They serve breakfast 24 hours a day.  The food was really good.  I also got my meal very quickly after ordering.I'm so glad I decided to try it.  I'll definitely be back.
2019-06-02,4,Excellent diner on the north end of Hoboken. Great food, and they're proud of it. Very clean, and they're very friendly. If you're looking for a special kind of Diner, Malibu is excellent!
2019-05-24,5,The. Best. Diner. Ever. I love this place. I'm originally from south jersey so finding a north jersey QUALITY diner hasn't been easy..but man does Malibu do it right. A classic spot. Love the omelets, French onion soup, and a few of there wraps.
2019-04-29,1,This place sucks and needs to be shut down. None of the food is fresh. It's tastes really old. Gordon Ramsey would crap himself if he ate here. I hope the owner sees that and makes a serious change in that kitchen.
2019-04-16,4,Been here with my boyfriend a few times. First place we ever ate together! So funny. Today we ordered the French Toast, two eggs scrambled, bacon, buttery toast and potatoes super well done and crispy. A simple request/task many cannot complete. Four stars is for the portion size, taste, and prices of the food. Service is okay. Our potatoes were not done correctly. Our waitress wasn't happy that we let her know and she said she will have them re-make the potatoes. 14 minutes later, more potatoes came out that were cooked the same exact way. We took a few bites and were done. The eggs are pretty bland too. Some salt and pepper would have been perfect. We simply added after. We will be back because of the food and prices. It's great it's open 24 hours and they accept Apple Pay!
2019-04-15,5,I've been here many times and always have a great meal and even better service! Brianna is our favorite waitress and she takes great care of us anytime we come here. Highly recommended!
2019-04-12,5,The owner was very nice he made a great effort in providing a nice dining experience. The waitress was very hospitable, bathrooms were clean and the diet coke was sublime. Best diner in Hoboken!
2019-04-10,5,We grew up in an average blue collar Jersey town where we ate at diners, all the time.  During my childhood, I didn't even know other types of restaurants existed .  There's something comforting and homey about a Jersey diner that no other establishments have.  You can linger in conversation without feeling rushed.  Coffee on tap.  Endless menu of dinner specials that include a soup, main, dessert, coffee, and glass of wine for 15 bucks. So there's the average Jersey Diner, then there's the Malibu.  So legendary it should be declared a US Historic Site.  Mouth watering omellettes, perfectly seasoned entrees, and the best waitstaff anywhere.  Whether it's a Sunday morning breakfast or Wednesday night dinner special, the Malibu does not disappoint.  It's the platinum standard to compare all other diners.  Not to mention, they have parking.   Always remember to ask for Vlasia- she is the best server this side of the Aegean.
2019-04-03,5,I visited Malibu Diner for the first time this past weekend. For a Sunday, it wasn't packed - I'm assuming because the weather wasn't favorable. Our waitress, I swear I could remember her name so I could mention her because from her alone I would leave a 5 star review. If I can find my receipt and her name is listed, I will edit my post. She was on point with everything. She provided quick service and offered suggestions. Her witty banter was funny and definitely made our morning. I ordered the waffle and bacon and my friend ordered the fish sandwich. We will definitely be back to make sure we are fueled up enough to head to Trader Joe's across the street. Keep up the great work Malibu Diner!
2019-03-24,2,When I lived in Hoboken a number of years ago this was a favorite for good Jersey diner food. I'm passing through so lets go for breakfast, a staple of a good diner! Apparently someone came through with a staple remover. Let's start with the surely server. That is all I will say... you work for tips sweetheart so learn to smile. I will say that the woman who sat me was pleasant. I ordered a very simple breakfast, omelet with sausage, spinach, tomatoes, and extra cheddar cheese. Cooked soft. I even repeated that and added I do not like any brown on the eggs. A side of sausage and home fries, coffee and orange juice. The food came quickly. That was the good part, although perhaps if they spent a little time on it the food would have been better. Then again you can't change cheap, watery orange juice; a great diner would squeeze the oranges fresh, on site. The sausage again was some cheap commercial brand lacking in any flavor. The home fries apparently came from a broken home divorced of any seasoning... please please please learn how to salt your food as you cook it! Now the omelette. What is so hard about cooked soft, no brown? Just pay attention to what you are doing. The eggs were as brown as the home fries. And cooked with no salt whatsoever. The order was for cheddar not American. That is a cheap replacement. Tell me if you do not have what I requested. The coffee is nondescript, at least it didn't taste bad. Overall a very poor meal. The Malibu Diner in Hoboken NJ has slipped quite a bit, no longer is it among even the good ones at least for breakfast.
2019-03-06,4,Personally, I'm surprised I haven't been here sooner. This is a classic Jersey Diner that tends to get overlooked by the myriad breakfast and brunch options in town.Most of the breakfast options can be categorized as eggs or sweet things (pancakes, French toast, etc). I got the Mediterranean breakfast wrap (egg whites, spinach, feta, onions, wheat wrap) with hash browns, whereas my boyfriend got their Boken toast (French toast topped with pork roll and over easy eggs) with hash browns. Service was standard but the place was packed, so no big deal.My boyfriend LOVED the toast, specifically the combination of sweet and salty, so much so that he thought that it didn't need any accoutrement (syrup, ketchup, etc). As for me, I liked my wrap and thought it was filling and satisfying. Hash browns were solid, and portioned appropriately. I've heard this place is ALSO, a good late night spot; maybe I'll be back for that! ;)
2019-02-21,4,One of the few places in town with space and high chairs to accommodate several Moms + toddlers.  The food is good, solid diner fare. Prices are fair - especially the $7 plate of silver dollar pancakes that easily feeds 2+ kids.
2019-02-15,4,Had some good pancakes today at Malibu diner...A bit drafty inside though.Good service
2019-02-08,5,Always good quality food and friendly service. Never a complaint about eating here. Burgers and omelets a favorite. The dinner specials are a great value and includes dessert.
2019-02-03,4,My go to Diner in town. Always good service and good diner food with friendly servers. Their skillets are great. Eggs Benedict the best.
2019-01-16,2,So I came here hungover with friends. All we wanted was good fries food to nurse our hangovers.We were pleasantly surprised when we sat down to see that they had a special for $3 Bellinis because who doesn't love a good hair of the dog.I decided to go with the disco fries and mozzarella sticks because how could you go wrong with those. Well I was wrong... the mixer Ella sticks came out perfect nothing wrong there... but the disco fries...It was a plate of fries with a little bit of gravy and two slices of yellow American cheese barely melted on top. I could still pick the cheese up as an entire slice. It's safe to say these basically went untouched. The only saving grace was my friends both got the honey dipper chicken fingers which I will admit we're pretty banging (especially after my second Bellini and mess of fries).
2019-01-12,5,Great find! The food was awesome, everyone was on top of things and it was very affordable. This is our new diner!
2018-12-31,5,This is the place if you are looking for fast and tasty diner food. The staff is expert and if your in the mood for an adult beverage they have a liquor license. This is a Hoboken icon.
2018-12-30,3,This is all around a pretty good restaurant, but the Monte Cristo barely lives up to that name. Service is good, but the food really does not live up to Hoboken standards. I wanted to love this place, but I just couldn't bring myself to give more than 3 stars.
2018-12-25,1,the worst fucking food in history never eat here, close this shit tf down asapp call the health service
2018-12-25,3,Food is dependable for a diner. It gets packed on weekends. Sitting at the counter is always a great experience. The staff is friendly, prices are good. Great neighborhood spot.
2018-12-09,3,Pretty typical diner, with some more eclectic decor... Staff are always very busy but you can tell they're a friendly crowd. It takes a while to get noticed when you walk in to find a table - everyone is always running around and the lines aren't clear.Food is mixed in my opinion - most experiences with more classic breakfast options and lunch sandwiches have been fine. Tuna sandwich, egg dishes, and fries have been solid (though  they don't carry yellow mustard). Tried the Nova lox recently and was surprised it came completely deconstructed, down to the 2 mini packs of Philadelphia cream cheese on my plate... I wasn't expecting anything too fancy but I did expect my bagel to come with cream cheese.Good choice if you are looking for mass appeal (i.e. when my family is in town) or if you need somewhere with parking.
2018-12-01,3,Everyone deserves a second chance, including my local diner. I've had past experiences that were disappointing, but I decided to try Malibu Diner again recently. I see improvement, so I'm upping it to three stars. My ordering was pretty traditional diner food, one time for a bacon and eggs breakfast, the other time for a cheeseburger deluxe lunch. Both times I found the food served promptly, the quality was good, and the service was nice.  I even bought an old school rice pudding to go that was satisfying.  I could certainly nitpick (no Heinz Ketchup on tables, only 'Farmer's Ketchup), but considering I had two good experiences, and add in it's local and there's parking, these recent visits were A-OK and I hope to write another positive update in the future.
2018-11-24,5,What a great little place in Hoboken.  Got seated quickly.  Excellent friendly service.  Everyone was super nice!  Restaurant was clean and so were the bathrooms!  Whew! . I had a ham and cheese omelette with fried potatoes and a side of sausage.  My darling had a chicken wrap with fries.  And guess what else..... drum roll please.... COCA-COLA!  Yippeeee!  #PepsiSucks.  It's open 24 hours.  Highly recommend.
2018-11-11,4,The Malibu has been in Hoboken forever and will probably survive everything from the gentrification exploding all around it to the imminent rise of the Hudson River waters thanks to global warming. I've been stopping by at least once a year for the past ten for a breakfast during weekends and I've never experienced anything other than the hard-scrabble but happy to see you, friendly good service a diner provides. It's also a great place to listen to some of the most interesting conversations among staff and customers. Budding writers will love this slice of Hoboken history.
2018-10-01,1,When you complain to the night manager and his response is pay or I will call the police...  If I could give negative stars...  Pay with Amex, go home, call amex, have them reverse the charge.
2018-09-27,4,Stopped by because I was starving and it was the first place I saw. I wasn't disappointed. I was told I could sit wherever, which was nice because I was dining solo. Regardless, I chose the bar. The menu was huge and diverse, which I expect from a diner. I had the churrasco. Service was fast and friendly. The greens in my salad were fresh and crisp. Steak came with 2 sides. I opted for spinach and baked potato. The potato was baked to perfection. The spinach on the other hand could have used some seasoning, but that's how some people like it. A little salt and pepper did the trick. My steak was cooked to the temp I requested and the flavor was decent. For the price, it was definitely a good meal. The chimichurri was a little too oily and not garlicky enough for me. I used A1 to get that flavor I wanted but would have been nice if I didn't need it. If I ever happen to be in the area again, I would try Malibu a second time.
2018-09-25,2,I live near by and have been going here for years but I have never seen a place that can't make eggs over easy. They are either overcooked or very runny. And scrambled are always dry, like they press them before placing them on the plate taking all the moisture out of the eggs. Just my two cents.
2018-08-16,1,I have continued to give Malibu a try after my previous three star review, but I won't be returning after my past experience involving a take out order of waffles and pancakes. My boyfriend went to the diner, and ordered our breakfast, asking for extra blueberries and bananas. An additional charge for fruit was not listed on the menu, nor did the cashier inform him of the +2.25 charge for each measly sprinkle of fruit-- had he, there would've been no problem. At that price you might as well buy a carton from the grocery store and save yourself the trouble. My boyfriend only realized after looking at the bill. After pressing the issue, the cashier was heated and refused to either refund the charge and redo the order, or say "this time it's on us, but in the future you know the deal". Nevertheless, upon returning the apartment, not only were the fruits we paid extra for missing, but so were the walnuts from his pancakes and chocolate chips from my waffle. Moreover, we nursed an upset stomach for the next day after eating our meal.Breaks my heart to give a local diner a one star review, but I've finally faced the facts. There are more competitively priced options in Hoboken, whether it's Onieals for French onion soup and a burger or sunny side for breakfast. Can't justify it even though I'm a sucker for their Belgium waffles.
2018-08-02,3,Breakfast specials at Malibu Diner are a terrific deal! You get huge portions for a reasonable price. I ended up with the Italian Omelette ($11.95) which included Italian sausage, peppers, mushrooms, onions, and mozzarella within its three eggs. This dish also comes with potatoes and buttered toast of your choice. You also get juice and tea/coffee included in the price. Wow.However, the potatoes lacked seasoning. The other person who ordered potatoes also felt the same way. The omelette was fine. The sausage was cooked and sliced into circles. I'd prefer ground sausage, but this is just to let you know what to expect. Two other people ordered sizzling egg skillets.Our waitress was older and no-nonsense. We did have to flag her down a few times but at least she wasn't rude and surly.Someone at the table asked for marmalade. It wasn't available, so then she asked for jelly. The runner said they only had grape. The waitress managed to dig up some strawberry. If you're a marmalade person, you may be out of luck. You can request unbuttered toast if you'd like.My seat had a prime view of the dessert case, and I was eyeballing the carrot cake. I'll have to keep that in mind for next time.  Malibu Diner is open 24 hours. I also noticed that it has its own parking lot. I don't drive in Hoboken, but free parking always wins points with me. Fun fact: This diner has been around since the 1940s. Impressive. A-OK.
2018-07-24,4,A few weeks ago, I ended up in Hoboken at the Malibu Diner. I've heard the diner itself is good and have wanted to get up there for a while. It seemed to work out well.  When I arrived around noon, it wasn't crowded at all. I was shocked! There isn't a lot of parking so it was a nice surprise to get a spot in the lot. Atmosphere: The Malibu Diner is typical of any North Jersey Diner.  There is a bar and plenty of tables and booths.  I sat in the corner booth which was quiet. Coffee: The coffee at the Malibu Diner was good. I was pleasantly surprised to see they served Lacas coffee. It was hot and the waitress brought plenty of refills. Hard to argue with that! Food: The Malibu Diner has every option you need in a diner. I wasn't sure what I was craving! For those who don't know, North Jersey has far better bagels than South Jersey so I decided to order a bagel.  I'm sure it wasn't the best ever (according to my good friend Amelia's view) but it was much better than anything in South Jersey. I decided to order a protein wrap which had every kind of breakfast meat you might want.  It was extremely packed. I was happy with it. Service: The waitress left for long periods but after a while she warmed up.  The food came out quickly and the manager checked on us a few times.  Overall Thoughts/Would I come back?The Malibu Diner is definitely one of my more favorite diners in the area and I would go back.  I was definitely happy with my experience.
2018-07-23,5,I lived in Hoboken from 2005-2009- moved to NYC, then moved back 2014 until today.  Through these years Malibu has not disappointed -ever! The service, quality, FLEXIBILITY, and hospitality never disappoints! The service is always warm and welcoming. Today my server was Fernando- a true hospitality professional.  Only recommendation is to have a solid Greek lemon soup (no eggs necessary) on the soup menu year round. 5 stars on quality food and service. Thanks guys!
2018-07-22,4,I haven't expect a diner to be this good until I came here. Their food portions are big. I've ordered the quesadilla from the appetiser section and still too big for me. The cheeseburger and the wrap both came with fries on the side. The food was good but our waiter wasn't attentive at all as we had to get up and get our own straws and get another waiter to call her as the beef wasn't well done and still pink from the inside. Overall our experience was good and we'll be gladly come back.
2018-07-17,5,Hands down the BEST diner in Hoboken/Weehawken/Jersey City area! I've been here plenty of times & have NEVER had a bad meal from here. This is a very big diner with plenty of seating so you never have to wait to be seated. Whether you're with a big group or by yourself there is a spot for you at this diner. The staff at this diner is friendly & they make sure they get to your table in adequate amount of time. I also find the late night staff to be extremely friendly & they tend to chat it up a little bit with their clients. Like any diner in the Nj/NY area their menu is huge & they have anything that you may desire at that time. Some of my top choices at this particular diner are: BLT, chicken fingers & fries, & French onion soup. Looking further at the menu though, there's definitely plenty of more options that sound delicious.I know plenty of people who enjoy coming to this diner after a night out in Hoboken or for just a quick meal during the day. If you're ever in the area & in the mood for some solid diner food, this is the spot for you!
2018-07-03,1,I've given this place a few chances ordering different items off their menu and I'm disappointed every time. You would think being the only dinner in Hoboken the food would be up to par. I will not continue to order from this place.
2018-06-09,5,I had not eaten in two days and was staying bedside with family at a nearby hospital when I realized it was Thanksgiving night. Nothing was open except Malibu Diner. Although it was empty, the staff was welcoming, polite, and exceedingly professional. They had a Thanksgiving dinner special and I reluctantly ordered it with no expectations.The entire meal tasted great! Turkey, dressing, mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce, and all the trimmings. I even had a simple glass of red table wine, coffee, and dessert. Not only was the meal delicious, it looked great and the service was on point. Thank you for reminding me what the season truly means. Sitting alone with my thoughts, enduring grief, and eating a Thanksgiving dinner here reminded me that hope will always conquer darkness. I know there were kitchen staff and other employees working that night who I did not see. To the entire staff that made my meal possible, thank you. Not only did you provide me a warm meal on a cold Thanksgiving night, you gave me strength, hope, and a renewed perspective about being thankful. For the rest of my life, I will always remember that 2017 Thanksgiving dinner at Malibu Diner.
2018-05-30,4,This is a good place in a convenient location.  Some of the food options are great and some are really bad.  For example the Ballerina salad with organic greens, fruits and nuts is delicious but the burger is so horrible I couldn't finish it. Waiters/waitresses are generally nice but not always(I don't blame them, it's a tough 24 hour diner). In conclusion it is a good place to grab a bite and you might be very satisfied with your experience here but don't set expectations too high!
2018-05-25,4,I LOVED IT! It's a diner and it provided all the quality troupes of a diner, basically I am saying is that is CHEAP! I spent 14 dollars on my meal. I got waffles with fresh strawberries and also scrambled eggs on the side. The best part was when I ordered their Bellini, it was TWO DOLLARS EACH. I couldn't believe it. It made me so happy! And trust me on this, they were very generous with their champagne. I had such a lovely time and the service was great. I would definitely go back to this spot if I am ever in Hoboken again.
2018-05-21,2,Not impressed at all. If they didn't have liquor here, I'd pass. Came for brunch. Host was nice. Ordered omelets. They came with home fries that were overcooked and crunchy & buttered toast but no jelly. The omelets are as listed. She didn't ask if I wanted cheese on my mushroom omelet. I didn't ask as I thought cheese came with it. My fault. So I'm kinda disillusioned with this place; no jelly, no cheese. Prices are absurd. My man asked for a glass of milk & they charged $5.95!!! GTFOH with that! A gallon costs $3.29!! I almost thought I was at Tops Diner with these prices but at least Tops food has flavor.
2018-05-18,1,Awful customer service ! Walked in tonight on Friday night, place was not busy. We wanted to grab dessert and told the man that we would only be there for dessert. He replied back with a "no". My boyfriend replied back with "what?" And the man replied back with "no" and the man then asked for my boyfriends name. After my boyfriend said his name the man didn't even call him by his name ! He called him by a nickname. He then asked if we've ever eaten there before and once we said yes he said okay I'll seat you. By then we were so disgusted by how we were treated we left
2018-05-15,5,Cozy old-school athmosphere, great classic food, adequate prices - what's not to like?
2018-05-12,2,40 bucks for our late afternoon munchies. I got a burger, side of fries, and my love got jersey fries. The burger was small and tasteless. I don't like ketchup so doused it with hot sauce to give it some flavor flav. The 5 fries I got were again not worth the price. Got a coke with my food and the beauty I was with got water. They can thank my love for the 2 stars because she liked the jersey fries.
2018-05-08,1,Has a first good experience here the other time I visited so I said why not try another time. I came around 7pm the other night and the hostess that was there was not paying attention to me and my boyfriend and instead was focused on her phone. This was not good since when you come into a good establishment the front of the house is very important. Okay moving on, we sat down and had a dinner and the food was okay/good.. the only thing that creeped me out was the chicken soup. The chicken had some bloody red looking kind of chicken I just don't know how to describe it. So I asked the waitress to take and it back and I just exchanged for the other soup that was really good. Overall an okay experience, which is sad because the first time I was here it was pretty good.
2018-05-05,2,Their food good is alright have had better diner food but their prices are ridiculously overpriced and their wait staff would afford to pay closer attention to customers when they order
2018-04-07,4,We have a nice breakfast at the Malibu Diner. We are a family from Denmark Europe and enjoyed the true American way of breakfast. There was a lot of food and good service. Will recommend that for at good American breakfast.
2018-04-05,3,This is a diner and not some gastro version.  It serves the food you expect at reasonable price.  I have only eaten at counter and get good service.    You will not see the farm the eggs came from and that is fine.   If want a waffle with bacon at 9am or hamburger at 1pm that is what you will get with no pretense.
2018-03-29,1,The service was great. Our serve tended to us in a timely manner and continued to check on us. I had ordered the eggs Benedict with the salmon and I was extremely excited to try it out. Once it arrived I saw how the first egg had a lot of raw spots where the clear or the yolk was showing. I didn't want to be picky so I tried my best to eat around it. Once I got to the second egg, however, it was impossible to eat. The whole inside of the egg was clear and uncooked. I had our server take a look and he agreed and apologized. My stomach immediately began to hurt and although my order was remade I just decided to go home and take it to go.As I got hungry throughout the day I decided to eat the order they made for me to go. Hours later the stomach pain turned into far more worse. I have the worst food poisoning ever. Going on 20 hours of severe stomach pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. So again, service was great all around, but they need to speak to that kitchen staff. First and last time I step foot into this diner!!!!
2018-02-25,4,2 things: please do away with syrup packets you need glass canisters, get Heinz glass Ketchup bottle not plastic knockoffs. Good food, but don't cheap out on little stuff that people remember
2018-02-17,3,A good place for lunch during the week.  I liked the look of the place.  The service was good.  The food was good.   I took advantage of my favorite pancakes for this meal.   I'll keep this diner in mind the next time I need a quick stop for lunch and Im in the area.
2017-12-11,4,Great place to go to end your drunken night. The mozzarella sticks are fire (at least from what I remember) and the service is really great. No one wants to deal with drunkies at 3am but the staff is super cool and really attentive.
2017-12-10,1,I would never step foot in this establishment again. If you are trying to have a good brunch with excellent service i would think twice before stopping by this place. We were a party of 5, but when we sat down the server only brought 4 cups of water, if you wondering if the 5th person ever receive their water, think again because we didn't. Once we placed our orders in the server was asked to bring straws, which she forget and towards the end of our meal brought it (just in time for the last sip of water). The food was mediocre but nothing spectacular. When going up to the counter and paying, we were all puzzled at the fact that they had Already included 20% gratuity when We had barely received any type of service that would be worthy of that. When we explained our experience to the manager, he blankly stared at us (with unapologetic gestures and eyes) and said nothing. We were forced to leave the 20% gratuity tip and did not even receive an apology from the manager, he literally just walked away after we explained the service and looked annoyed with us. When the manager doesn't even care about your experience, that's when you know the Restarant is not worth visiting!
2017-12-06,1,I do normally say this is a good diner to go to in hoboken but went there n sat down for 15 minutes and NO waiter/waitress came over.  Walked out after I told owner today's service was AWFUL!!
2017-11-22,2,I have been frequenting Malibu Diner for many, many years and just started using delivery in the past year.  Not only does the hostess handling the delivery orders have an extremely bad customer service attitude but she doesn't get the order correct.  I ordered an entrée with gravy on the side and a vegetable, the gravy was all over it and no vegetables delivered.  When we called back, her poor attitude got worse and after almost an hour, still no re-delivery.  With all the competition in Hoboken, you would expect them to at least get the order correct, especially after waiting an extra hour for the re-delivery.
2017-11-11,1,I don't think I've ever had worse diner food in my life. "Italian" omelette came with American processed cheese food. Sent it back and it came back overcooked with breakfast, not Italian sausage and sliced packaged mozzarella cheese. The kind of place that gives diners a bad name. The only reason I'm giving one star is because of the waitress
2017-10-25,4,Let me start with the negative.  We were a party of 4 arriving early Sunday afternoon.  The place was crowded but there were a few clean empty tables that could have accomodate us  and no one else was was waiting so not crazy about the 10-15 minutes we waited to be seated.  Huge menu and we took advantage of the variety.  In our group of 4, we ordered breakfast, lunch and dinner; one of the reasons I like diners if they are good.  And, Malibus was good.  We ordered an omlette, wrap, salad and turkey dinner.  The food was good.  The portions were good, enough for some to take food home.  The service was good.  There was a mistake on the initial order which was corrected immediately with no problem.  Coffee was refilled without having to ask.  Prices were a little high but this is Hoboken.  All in all, it was good meal.
2017-09-17,5,Great establishment!Best Diner food I've had in this area! Great prices! Frequent Visitor!Must try the Chicken and Waffles!!!!!!They also put my favorite show on T.V upon request.Super friendly staff!
2017-08-31,3,This is an "okay" diner. I would really only suggest going here for late night eats since its 24 hours. It's really convenient - has parking which is not the norm for Hoboken. The inside is really nice looking - the service is usually a little awkward though. My friend ordered pancakes and asked for syrup, and the waitress looked at him like he had 5 heads lol. Again, not bad but only go for convenience. There are much better diners out there.
2017-08-29,5,This is one of the best diners I've ever been to. Whether it's judged on the service, quality or quantity of food, or their outstanding deals with their chef's specials, it's obviously a five star place. Next time you're in Hoboken, try their breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even dessert - their cheesecake is unbelievable! I'm definitely a regular for a reason!
2017-08-12,1,This is the first review I've ever made. I live 2 blocks from Malibu and keep going back for convenience reasons. Always giving it another shot after sub par food. Today my friends...was the last straw. I ordered mozzarella sticks.  HOW THE FUCK DO YOU MESS UP MOZZARELLA STICKS?!?!? It's fucking fried cheese....I felt like I was chewing on cardboard and dipping it into sweet and sour ragu marinara sauce. This place is crap. I'm done with it.... I'd rather eat a bag of shit that some hoboken bum took in the parking lot of this garbage establishment.
2017-07-17,1,Usually go here and it's fine but walked in tonight and there were at least 20 other people dining, and the waitress said hello and looked like she was about to seat us, but some guy came over, looked us up and down and said oh we are closed for maintenance.  What a bunch of bull**. Telling all my friends to avoid this place now.
2017-05-20,1,We found a bug in our food today and the manager did nothing about it. We also got very bad food poisoning. We will never be coming back to a place like this with bad food and bad customer service. Save your money.
2017-05-16,5,Went on a Sunday for some brunch. Had a chipotle wrap; it was great. Can't beat the $2 mimosas! Service was friendly and attentive. Will come back.
2017-05-11,1,Food was really good, but I am giving one star for the terrible customer service from every single person that worked there. When we first walked in, the hostess did not even greet us nor was polite. Then when we sat down, the waitress that we had was like a dead soul. She was beyond rude and had no manners. She just dropped plates on the table, didn't even tell us what we're are options to drink because the lack of menu options. She gave us the check without even us asking for it, made us feel so rushed. When it was time to pay, the hostess was flirting with a customer while attending us. She should do that on her own time. For our first time there, it was a terrible place and I would not even recommend a homeless man to go there, that's how bad it is. PS. The bathroom was beyond filthy, I've seen cleaner bathroom in NYC Port Authority.
2017-04-14,3,Finally made it to the Malibu Diner for breakfast on a Friday in April.  Pretty busy for a weekday morning!  Parking lot is always a plus and there were a few spots available.  Breakfast menu is a bit smaller than your typical Jersey diner, however, they had all the classics.  Two eggs over easy for me with bacon and hash browns- it was okay.  My fiancée got the Italian omelet and that came with hash browns, too.  Not bad.  He asked for hot sauce and it took a while to get, not a major issue.  Coffee included with breakfast.  The buttered whole wheat toast was delicious- thick bread and toasted to perfection.  The bill was under $25 and you pay up front. Option to add tip on bill when using CC, good if you don't have cash.  We would come back and next time we'll try their baked-in banana pancakes.
2017-04-13,5,Great place and food. The restaurant is very clean and the service great. Coffee cup was alway filled. It's also a great place for kids to eat and and enjoy thr food. Amazing place.
2017-03-30,2,Worst Greek salad ever. No anchovies, no dolmas, California black olives, no oregano. Basically a lame dinner salad with a very little bit of feta.
2017-03-29,1,Prices way to hi for the quality of food !!..  go some where else in Hoboken !! You're welcome
2017-03-24,1,I order take out once or twice a month from Malibu Diner.  Each and every time I order for delivery it arrives incorrectly.  Yes, they own up to their mistakes but now we have to wait another 30-40 minutes for the correct order to get here.  Let's get it right the first time.  The food is pricey too to be making so many mistakes.
2017-03-09,2,Came here for my first meal in Hoboken, fresh off the plane. Ordered a rib eye steak and eggs (between $14-$17, I can't remember). It was good, portion was generous. But why do they ask me how I like my steak when it's 3mm thick and it ends up being well done anyway? Anyhoo, the meal stated that the entrée came with coffee AND juice. Our server, who was cordial enough I guess. Didn't even mention to us that the food came with juice and if my brother hadn't asked, didn't tell us about the choices of toast that the meal came with either.I don't really understand the underwhelming service we received. This was 6:30 AM and the diner was not even a quarter full. Not once was my coffee refilled and she only came by three times. Once to take our order, second to deliver it, and third to give us our check. Never came by to ask how everything was, no smile on her face. To be honest, it wasn't the most welcoming atmosphere that day. I'm not very enthused to come back.
2017-02-23,4,Seriously love the 'Bu'! We often order delivery on our busy work nights and most of the time it arrives quickly. There have been two occasions where the delivery person called and told us 'to come outside' because he could not get off his bike for whatever reason...not okay.Aside from that, we love the food! Considerably delicious for a 'diner' - fresh salads, grilled chicken is amazing!
2016-09-24,1,It's a shame this diner's food isn't better because the location is great, but the food is not good at all and it is overpriced. Very disappointing that the quality doesn't match the pricing. The wings were hard as rocks & the soup wasn't made correctly.
2016-09-21,3,Its your classic overpriced jersey diner. Its exactly the kind of place you want to be if you're just coming from the gym and your'e messy an starving, or the place to get a pork roll, egg and cheese after a night of drinking. Dessert counter is on display right when you come in filled with cakes and pastries, there are booths and a back dining room.The menu is huge, and has just about everything you would ever want from a diner. The staff doesn't give you a hard time about making substitutions or omitting things. Prices are high for what you're getting, but you're most likely going there for the convenience anyway, which is what you're actually paying for.Also, they have $2 mimosas on weekends. Why not.
2016-09-01,5,WE LOVE THIS PLACE BEST ZUCCHINI STICKS IN THE COUNTRY. Try the 2 dollar saturday and sunday misosas. Take your grandpa. Take your roommate. Take your boyfriend. Is always there for me in a time of need. Like when I need to eat my feelings. Highly recommend.
2016-08-28,1,No. Just No.Really. Don't go in.I'm serious. Just find another Diner.No. The review states "No", how many other ways can I put it to you?Nein. Nada. I refuse. I reject. I am nauseated even remembering I went into this place. This was a harrowing experience.
2016-08-06,5,My favorite diner in Hudson county. Never had a bad meal here and everyone I bring here agrees. Super friendly staff and great food. Best part is there's a parking lot which is a huge plus for being located in Hoboken.
2016-08-06,5,the malibu diner is very good to our bldg next door, great service, great food, 24/7 great service i highly reccomend this place
2016-07-28,1,Warm beers, no toilet paper in the women's restroom, staff is ok no jollyness at all.   Omelettes were sad, small portion no flavor.   House bread room temperature.    Always had to ask for beverage refills.  Not going back.
2016-07-17,4,Came here for breakfast with my two friends on a Saturday around 11:30 am. Service was decent the food was good. I got the Monte Cristo and my friends got the banana&pb pancakes and a spinach&mushroom skillet. The prices are very fair and portions were good. This is a nice spot to come to eat after a night of drinking.
2016-05-30,3,Nice place for Hoboken. I would have liked to have had a better option instead of carbs with my protein omelet.  .75 up-charge for a frozen bagel. Waitress, Lina, was nice. She never came back to check after our meal was served. We had to go to another table to get hot sauce. She did keep our coffee cups filled. Easy to walk to from the Sheridan Hotel.
2016-04-24,3,Nice and clean dinner. Service is also good, however, they do not serve real maple syrup, that to me it's unacceptable. If I'm going out to pay for breakfast I expect to get at least real maple syrup for my pancakes. That's why I give this dinner a 3 stars. Overall, it's average, good portion size.
2016-04-21,1,The service sucked, the food sucked, the waitress didn't want to work our food came out cold, the whole vibe in this place was off it wasn't welcoming
2016-03-23,2,My boyfriend & I stopped by at Malibu Diner on a Friday evening about a few weeks ago and it seems like things have certainly changed here.I have reasons to believe that they hired a new staff because the waitress we had was definitely not bringing her A game to us. Food was mediocre, used to be better quality. We didn't want wine even though it was part of the Friday night special, so we got soft drinks instead and everything was swell when it was our entree, soup, and salad. My boyfriend ordered the French Onion soup since he's been on a French Onion soup kick, but sadly the French Onion soup was not on par. It seems no effort was put into trying broil the cheese. The cheese wasn't broiled at all. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken Francese over rice, but the shrimp lacked flavor and taste, definitely too much breading. After eating our entrees, we had to ask the waitress about dessert and she also failed to mention there was coffee and tea offered. I think as customers we shouldn't have to ask if something is offered and she or the staff should know this. It feels as though the staff has changed and so has the service. The service used to be a lot better, but for some reason this time wasn't up to our standards and for that, we feel as though we won't be returning back to Malibu for a while.
2016-03-22,4,My wife & I had breakfast here and it was really good. I had scrambled eggs and home fries, she had a vegetarian breakfast wrap, and we shared a grilled corn muffin. Standard breakfast fare, but done very well and at a good price.
2016-03-05,4,I stopped in with a co-worker around lunch time and we each had breakfast.  It's a big diner located off the busy downtown of Hoboken.  The good news is they have their own parking lot..  I ordered the Banana Peanut Butter pancakes, a fruit salad on the side, and coffee.  The pancakes consisted of 3 large pancakes with the bananas and peanut butter chips cooked into them.  Just the perfect amount of both so you could enjoy the pancakes.  The fruit salad was a combination of canned and fresh fruit.  A nice size portion.  The coffee was hot and tasty, the way I like it.  Service was good and friendly.  My co-worker ate all of his meal and had no complaints.  We'll be back.
2016-03-02,1,I've been to Malibu Diner about 3 times because my boyfriend likes it and it is the only diner close to our apartment. This place is the worst. The burger was gamey, and the fries were dry. I tried it another time and had the chicken fingers. They were fatty and the breading wasn't tasty at all. It was something you would find at a bowling alley. There were flies in the summer and the $2 mimosas were basically orange juice in a champagne glass. The French toast was decent, but nothing special. Malibooooo!!!!
2016-02-24,3,The BOOOO...It's an average diner with average diner food..I feel their foos is alright, Nothing is made with love.
2016-02-23,1,I went to Malibu diner and ordered a cup of coffee. In response, the waitress angrily snatched the menu, silverware, and threw them in the server station. Then she walked over to another server and yelled within ear shot, "just a coffee! Just an effin coffee!" Needless to say, not the best experience, even for New Jersey standards.
2016-02-19,3,Sandwich was good ordered the chi ken salad on wheat bread! Salad to pricey for the amount. 13.00 dollars for lettuce a 1 piece of skinny chicken! Wont order again
2016-02-15,5,I'm a tiny person but I could finish all of them because they were so delicious that I couldn't stop eating!!!! You can try "Surf and Turf" on the menu. I often go there. Never get disappointed. Those comfort foods are so addictive.
2016-01-31,2,Not impressed. We were on our way to Connecticut from Jersey so needed a quick place to eat by our hotel before we left. Service was slow and food was average. Typical diner style food and they get two stars because they have alcohol. My peach Bellini was ok but my date's Bloody Mary was awful. It also took a long time to get our check. Parking is terrible and isn't nearly worth the hassle.
2016-01-27,5,I recently stumbled upon malibu with my family and it was amazing!! Friendly staff, very clean establishment, and excellent food! My sister had a protein wrap, one of many healthy menu choices. Egg whites, grilled chicken, mushrooms and Swiss on a whole wheat wrap grilled to perfection. Served with a nice portion of home fries. My dad chose the fluffy western omelet also served with crisp home fries and his choice of toast. I had the spinach salad with grilled chicken which was perfect. Crisp spinach sliced mushrooms and juicy grilled chicken. My brother ordered a cheesesteak but at the malibu there are no ordinary cheese steaks, they serve an actual rib eye on a fresh roll cooked to your temperature preference, smothered in sautéed onions and cheese with a fresh slice of juicy tomato and crisp leaf lettuce. The best cheese steak he's ever had! Last but certainly not least, grandma opted for the classic chicken parm sandwich. Juicy breaded chicken cutlet baked in homemade marinara sauce and covered in melted mozzarella cheese, on a roll with a side of French fries. Every plate was prettier than the last, everything was fantastic and we are now frequent regulars. Give this place a try if you're in the Hoboken area, you will not regret it!
2016-01-20,5,So I've looked high and low for rice pudding like abuela and none have satisfied my palette. Most taste so artificial , until I arrived here at the Malibu. Their recipe is one of a kind and its made in house, not bought in bulk like other places. Somehow ice cream is involved in the recipe and it makes it taste delicious!!!!!!! Needless to say this is my favorite diner.
2016-01-12,4,The Bu! This place is good. Open 24/7 with anything you could possibly want how could this place get a bad review. The service is alright but who goes to a diner expecting top notch service. The food is good and the prices are alright. This is how a diner should be! I would change the name from Malibu diner to the Hoboken diner. The  name makes it seem out of place.
2016-01-03,1,This place is FREEZING. Bring a hot water bottle and fuzzy blanket. It should be called the North Pole diner. Don't bother complaining about it. Goes in on ear and out the other. The Ladies room is below zero. You can literally see your breath in there. In any given weekend you can see a fight break out after 2am.  Cakes are stale. Overpriced, cold and stale.  That sums it up. You'll see.
2016-01-03,4,Definitely one of my favorite places to go after a night on that town. Food is always very tasty. Their breakfast options are the best. Staff is always very friendly.
2016-01-02,2,Not a very good place. There's a reason why very few people who were born and raised in Hoboken actually eat here. There only claim to fame is that they have parking. Other then that, I'd go with the Spa each and every day. They're more expensive then a lot of other resturants in Hoboken which is absurd considering the quality of food they present.
2016-01-02,3,Classic diner with all your basic diner needs. Food is average but the selection is well varied. The only thing I have to say is the service is HILARIOUSLY poor when it gets busy and sometimes it gets real busy...
2015-12-28,1,With all the great places to eat in Hoboken, this place is OUT of place. For starters, the service is really slow and the wait staff seems inexperienced and cannot answer simple questions about the food. Way too many choices on the menu. The food itself is mediocre and overpriced. We were served a spinach dip that was supposed to be hot but was microwaved and partially cold. The bowl was not even half full and the chips were stale. $9.50. No thank you. The sandwiches were kind of small.  Dried up roast beef and greasy, fatty steak unseasoned. So overpriced, bland food and bad service. Go somewhere else!
2015-12-28,3,Typical diner food...large menu with many options, and fair prices. Restaurant itself is huge, and has parking (so rare in Hoboken!). I ordered a grilled chicken Caesar salad which came with a choice of soup. My boyfriend ordered the Italian wrap with fries. We were both full and satisfied!
2015-12-12,4,I don't get the hate for this place, I've gotten takeout breakfast from here a few times and it's been good, so I decided to take a chance and come for sit-down breakfast. Service was great, food was your standard diner fare - just what I wanted. Good location and a great place to burn off your hangover, haha.
2015-12-10,5,Love this diner. A Hoboken landmark, this is your typical diner -- with a large menu, great service, and a very homey feel.  Can't recommend the skillets enough!
2015-12-01,1,Pretty average place. The waitress seemed annoyed that I had even come in, I sat for 10 minutes before anybody came to bring me a menu or offer coffee (this was for breakfast) then another long time to come back so I could order even though the place was mostly empty. The food did come quickly and was ok (diner quality food as expected) but unfortunately even though the other staff seemed friendly the waitress but a damper on the whole place. I had to chase her down for a second cup of coffee and some butter for my toast. In a town with such great food I would not bother returning.
2015-11-21,1,Since the birth of my son 1 1/2 years ago, my family has had a Sunday morning tradition of going to a diner. Malibu has been in the rotation because it is close to our apartment. Well after today, it is out. Anyone who has been to Malibu knows it is below average diner food to begin with.  Recently, the nickel and diming has gotten out of hand. The last straw was today. I was charged an extra $3, without notice, for a simple substitution I have made every time I've come. When I spoke to the manager, he was completely indifferent and rude. Last time I spend $30 on diner breakfast at this dump.
2015-11-13,3,Its OK in a pinch or when you are really hungry..I hope this place stays open for that simple reason.
2015-11-01,1,Awful experience. Was not even asked what we wanted for drinks, and did not have our order taken for over an hour. Had to ask three separate times for the check. The food was awful quality. Chicken wrap was soggy and of premade quality. Like something you would expect from a gas station.Manager was running the register and would not split the bill and was extremely rude. Wouldn't you want to make every convenience for your customers? Poor experience overall. I would avoid this place.
2015-10-27,1,The owner was extremely rude to me and my guests after i forgot my license and later realized after ordering an alcoholic drink. They later kicked us off the property after confronting me about the drink and refused my female friends request to use the restroom before she left. The owner went so far as to call the police as we were leaving peacefully. 5 black men in Hoboken wanting to catch a bite to eat at Malibu's is a no-go. Avoid this place like the plague the owner is one of the worst human beings ive ever met. Stay Away!!!
2015-10-15,1,If I could give 0 stars, I would. Food is crap and the manager is nasty. I went in to see if it was ok to park in the parking lot so I could quick run an errand since my son and I were coming to eat right after and not only was the hostess miserable, but the manager (woman with dark hair) was even worse. It's one thing to say "no", it's another thing to be completely mean about it. I refuse to come back here because of that.
2015-10-09,2,The food is regular diner food, so it's edible and helps you get over whatever hangover you might have or be avoiding.The service... awful. We told the waitress we had a place to be in an hour and a half. It shouldn't take that long in the first place. But we BARELY made it. She took her time with EVERYTHING. The check too 10 minutes to get to our table. On top of that, it's pricier than other diners that aren't too far. I'd rather go to Coach House in Union City or River View Diner. I won't be returning.
2015-10-03,2,The food is pretty good had a good burger and the disco fries are good. Reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because I had the worst server experience I had almost ever and I use to only work in restaurants so I'm a nice understanding customer. She approached us annoyed already and said "what are you getting" she didn't introduce herself or anything. We told her what we were getting and she said OK. My friend said he wanted his burger well done ( he hates bloody burgers I love them) both our burgers were bloody. My friend tried to get the waitresses attention but she was picking her nails he said "hey excuse me miss" she came up really annoyed and said "Dont say hey to me I have a name" I said "but you didn't tell us your name" she said "you need to ask" and walked away without even hearing our concerns. We called another server and told him he immediately brought it in the kitchen and cooked it. We ate and immediately asked for our check because we didn't feel comfortable thanks to her. I still tipped her because I refuse to not tip waiters because I've been there. I still Dont know the woman's name but if I ever decide to come back I will walk out if she is the only server available.
2015-09-18,4,Solid diner on the diner scale...Pros:1. Big, so always easy to get a table2. Good menu, lots of choices like any diner3. Cheap relatively, not like NYC4. Usually parking available5. Good breakfast, which is key! 6. FastCons:1. French toast needs cinnamon and an egg batter, it is pretty much just bread2. Servers have zero personality, I miss Jersey diner waitresses like other places3. Water glasses are tiny and bad plastic, give me a real glass that I don't drain in 3 sips4. Toast is super generic barely soaks up my eggs5. Cookies and brownies are awful, expensive, inedible
2015-09-06,5,I bought a steak sandwich that was phenomenal! The service was the best. The waiter always kept my glass full and made sure that I was happy, with out crossing the threshold of annoyance. The steak was perfectly seasoned, well done and juicy. Great portions, never cheap with the fries. I love this place. I have been here at all hours of the day, and their services never fails. This is probably the cleanest diner in New Jersey. They have parking!! You can eat freely and take your time, without the worry of being ticketed and booted.
2015-08-09,5,We'd actually planned to eat at the Brownstone Diner (in Jersey City) today (mid-afternoon main meal) - but we took a different route than usual when going to donate tons of books at Symposia Bookstore in Hoboken, and the Malibu beckoned.  It was a good choice, as every aspect was very positive.  I ordered the cheese agnolotti pasta dish ($14.95), which had ravioli with four different types of cheese and it was *delicious*.  It came with either a house salad or a cup of soup and I had the soup (cream of turkey, which was very good).  We were also given a generous amount of warm garlic bread and that was delicious.  My husband ordered the tilapia shrimp special, which came with a house salad or a cup of soup (he also had the soup), a choice of potato & vegetable, coffee or tea, a glass of wine and a dessert - all for only $15.50!  He said his entrée and the (baked) potato & vegetable were good but not great, although the dessert (which we shared, since the portion size was quite generous) was very good (chocolate mud pie).Our server was a *very* sweet young woman, the cashier was another very nice young woman, and the restrooms were very clean.  There's also a parking lot, and there's a large back room which isn't evident from the exterior.  Lastly, the Malibu is open 24 hours/day.
2015-08-07,1,I came here with friends and the food was pretty descent except for a piece of lettuce that was in my friend's cup of water. They didn't manage to tell us about the gratituity rate (automatic tip) which was 18% of the check. Not only did the waitress not aware us about the gratituity rate, she also didn't say anything when we tipped her an 4 extra dollars. Overall, we were broke the by time we left.
2015-07-26,5,Always stop in when I'm  in Hoboken. Great breakfasts. Timely service, hey it's a Diner, you're in and you're out.
2015-06-12,5,Since i moved from Hoboken last year, I've yet to find the chance to dine at my favorite old spot! Upon entering i was reluctant to see how modern and spacious the dining room looks. The booths are a great new edition to the overall atmosphere of the place. I had the Ballerina salad on lunch special this afternoon for only $10 which included a cup oh homemade Chicken Noodle soup...oh so delicious! Washed it down with a glass of freshly brewed unsweetened blueberry tea and left one happy customer.
2015-06-10,5,This is by far my favorite diner. The service is always excellent. The staff at this diner is so warm and friendly they never give me a reason not to come back. My favorite meal on the menu is the open sliced steak sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes I highly recommend it! I've been coming here for years and they've recently renovated their dining which makes the atmosphere that much more comfortable. They definitely put a lot of effort to please their customers. Most diners let themselves go outdated and dont keep up with any maintenance. In the winter I love to come here and enjoy a nice cup of their frothy hot chocolate with whip cream, it's delicious. This place is conveniently located right at the brink of hoboken and the fact that they have a parking lot is a huge plus. And you can't go wrong with their Sunday morning brunch specials. $2 mimosas and bellinis are the perfect way to cure any hangover.
2015-05-23,4,We were in town for the Westminster Dog Show and stopped at the Malibu for something to warm us up. The food was excellent, with good portions, and reasonable prices. On the downside, we were lucky to find a parking spot, since there were few to be had, but altogether a good experience, and we'll definitely be back.
2015-05-19,5,They're pretty spot on for quality of food when looking for a variety, they definitely provide that on their menu. They're conveniently open 24/7 which is extremely convenient!!I never leave this place without ordering buffalo wings as they're my favorite and I love their teriyaki dish! Another awesome diamond in this busy little town is they have PARKING!!! So I never really have to worry about aimlessly searching for parking when I want to stop in for a quick bite on the go. I typically go there at least a few times a month and they've never disappointed. They give you a ton of sides / options for an entree for such a good price, that you can't get anywhere in other restaurants in Hoboken!Five stars in my book!
2015-05-13,5,I grew up going to Malibu diner and it's been consistently one of NJ's best diners. The food is hearty and the ambiance is welcoming and comfortable. It's still my go to for a good solid meal any time of the day!
2015-05-10,3,Went here on a Sunday for breakfast.Plus point is the free parking lot, as we are aware of the pain of parking in Hoboken.Food is average. Nothing my friend and I tried was too bad, but nothing was extraordinary. They have $2 Bloody Mary, mimosas, and Bellini on Sunday's during breakfast time.I would say the setting inside is pretty dull for a diner. It feels as if you're sitting in a cafeteria with tables just placed there and everyone is just talking away. The front part of the diner is much better though.Overall, plenty of options, especially breakfast, open 24/7, and free parking lot.
2015-05-09,4,What kind of New Jersey town would Hoboken be without a diner? Malibu Diner is open 24/7 and I have been here both late night and breakfast time. It's pretty standard as far as a diner goes, nothing spectacular to report with the exception of  the $2 Bloody Mary/mimosa/Bellini special on Sunday's. That is the cheapest you will find it in Hoboken!
2015-04-25,2,What can I say its a decent diner in Hoboken. Service is adequate and so is the food. Went for breakfast and had this health wrap which was quite tasty with a $2/mimosa it was a decent deal.Went back recently on Christmas Day. Yikes!
2015-04-22,1,I ordered a chicken chipotle wrap on Sunday and I swear it must've been made by Satan himself.  I have never gotten sicker in my entire life. Try cleaning your kitchen once in awhile and maybe I'll consider coming back
2015-04-01,3,It's a diner, and an average one.This isn't one of NJ's finest iconic diners. It's just a regular old diner. It has a fairly large menu with everything from eggs Benedict to lobster. however, if you come to a diner for Lobster and filet you will always be disappointed. Nothing is amazing here, but just kind of average diner food. It is a bit pricey for a diner though.You don't come here for culinary delights, you come for some greasy food, more often than not after a night out or the ending of one. The breakfast isn't half bad at all and worth it. I'd say it beats Stacks and the wait is a lot less than turning point. Service is diner service too, they're there to take your order and bring you your disco fries. I will say the milkshake I had once was pretty awful, so I wouldn't order than that. Other than that, this is average diner food, it has a parking lot, it's open 24 hours and it's the only one we really have in Hoboken. Spa doesn't count.
2015-03-31,2,Came here in the dead of night after clubbing in Manhattan, looking for comfort food. I had a burger. Plain and simple. Lettuce, tomato, cheese, mushrooms-- nothing fancy. Besides, you can't mess up a burger, right? Riiiight. I didn't enjoy it. I had a hard time finishing it. It was dry and rubbery. But I was hungry, and food is food nonetheless, so I wolfed it down. On the upside, the fries were good.My friend didn't fare so well. He had meatloaf, had a few bites, and refused to eat the rest. We mentioned our dissatisfaction to the waitress, who politely nodded and did nothing about it. Great. First and last time at this diner.
2015-03-07,4,Love this place! A great diner option to have in Hoboken. Nice sized servings, lots of seating.The Sunday $2 drink specials (Bloody Mary, mimosa, and bellinis) are fun, although tiny and don't have much alcohol in them.Something for everyone here and the staff is friendly.
2015-03-07,1,We woke up early and instead of going to our go-to Turning Point we tried this place and NEVER AGAIN. The eggs were over cooked and brown, the bacon looked like it had been microwaved and was dry and hard, when we asked we found out they deep fry their bacon ... YES deep fried ... My home fries were cold and a pile of mush. The coffee and water were the only good things I had. YUCK!!!
2015-02-27,1,I hadn't been here in years so when we were deciding which diner to go to for dinner last night and Malibu was suggested, I said sure!  We got there and the menu looked pretty good and the place looked clean.  I hadn't read any reviews and didn't recall anything extraordinary about prior visits, so I had an open mind.I was trying to decide between fish & chips or eggplant parm.  I didn't want fries with the fish & chips, so I asked for a veggie instead.  I get told it "comes with french fries",  One fried food is really enough, I don't need two.  I ask again and I'm told I can have "cole slaw" instead.  This is going well .... so I move on to the eggplant parm.  I ask if it's fried in a lot of egg because I really hate that and the waitress didn't really know.  Back and forth and I find out that it's premade.  I figure I'll take my chances and I go ahead and order it.  When it gets to the table, I find out that the eggplant is paper thin, literally encased in a pancake like substance.  Like you took an IHOP pancake, slit it open and slid in the sheerest slice of eggplant you could make with a slicer.  I kid you not.  It was pancakes with cheese and marinara sauce.  My linguine was lukewarm. My dinner companion didn't fare much better.  Her steak was cold and had to be sent back to be reheated. How can you not tell that food is cold when you bring it out?You have to ask for bread.  They don't bring it automatically. And anything else you might need.I had a couple of bites and gave up.  Brought it all home in a doggie bag.  My pets liked the marinara sauce. Not going back.
2015-02-16,2,The Yelp stars sum it up... "Meh. I've experience better"  I have come here a number of time and it has been nothing spectacular.  The prices are even inflated compared to other better more fresh restaurants in town.  If you come here stick to ordering eggs /pancakes/standard breakfast items.  I would stay away from the over priced dinners.
2015-02-01,4,It's a diner...You only go to a diner for three things- eggs, burgers, and fries..  And just maybe, just maybe you get some meatloaf.Malibu does all those quite well.  I have never had anything wrong when I ordered the listed items.  I cannot comment on their Chicken Marsala, Lobster Bisque, nor their Lasagna. But then again, I would never order those items at a diner..  There are a million excellent restaurants in Hoboken to get them. Prices are reasonable. Parking lot sucks; way too small..Have Fun
2015-01-05,4,Chocolate Chip pancakes are enormous and awesome! Very soft! I ordered a short stack and it was more than enough (2 instead of 3).
2015-01-02,3,went there for an after new-years breakfast.  everything was okay (egg skillet i had was super greasy, i'd ask for less cheese next time).  food was what could be expected from a diner.  service was slow, but the restaurant was packed given the date.
2014-12-19,1,Worst Diner I've ever been too. Horrible service, horrible food and the staff was more concerned with a booth full of what looked like their drunk co-workers. Our waitress never checked on us for refills or how the food was. Needless to say the food was disgusting. Price matched what I expected from the area but how do you mess up something as simple as buttermilk pancakes and scrambled eggs?!?!
2014-12-09,2,I have eaten here a few times and the food has varied between standard (although overpriced) diner food and inedible grossness. While the service is always friendly, the food is not worth it. We ordered corned beef hash that came out as chunks of burned-together meat and potatoes smothered in salt, and the worst eggs Benedict Florentine to ever exist. Maybe I should have known better, but the spinach was the chopped and brown-green microwaved type, and the hollandaise was wretched. I could barely choke down the spinach alone. I have had sandwiches from here that are okay. Pancakes and waffles are okay, but it is disappointing that a diner messed up breakfast, especially since it was expensive. Will not be returning here.
2014-12-07,4,Great service and great food.  It is leaps and bounds above that other diner at the other end of town, Spa Diner.  Service, food, atmosphere and ambiance all outshine what you'll get at Spa Diner.  Let's look at the managers of both establishments as a simple basis for comparison.  At Spa Diner you will find a chain smoking, rude and intellectually challenged moron.  At Malibu Diner you'll be charmed by a a manager that is both studly and cordial.  #malibu4life
2014-11-22,3,I know what I want when I go to a diner and I certainly get it.  I am not concerned about healthy food or fancy meals, I just want something simple and quick.I came here once for breakfast right before graduation.  I was a little worse for wear but their corned beef hash fixed me up nicely.  The service is quick too.I have been able to get free disco fries before using Loyal Blocks, so give that a try.  I have also tried out the buffalo chicken wrap, which only comes with a pickle and coleslaw if you request them.  Everything here is good, not great but solid.  Like I said, its a typical diner where the food is consistent but you are not eating 5-star meals.  But hey sometimes that is all you need.
2014-10-25,3,Came here after a night of drinking at Pilsner Haus. Typical diner food. My main entree was the rib eye and eggs. The best part however, was the calamari! It was surprisingly tasty and crunchy. Me and my group were filling up on the calamari before we even got our meals. Portion size was big and I was able to eat half for breakfast the next day. Our only complaint was that the waiter told us we could split the check one way, only to hear different instructions from the guy who rang us up. Good place to come for drinking munchies, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
2014-09-19,4,What you'd expect for Jersey diner and the added bonus is that it was clean too.  We went for breakfast and they met our needs.  Nothing super fancy, but everything was cooked to order, the service was fine and food came out quickly.  Enjoy!
2014-09-15,1,This place is an embarrassment for a diner, especially in a state known for diners.The chipotle burger used to be awesome, but now they use some weird sauce akin to diarrhea in place of the mayo, and the fries are awful. They taste like the ones you get on your college meal plan that sit under the red lamp for 12 hours a day..yuck.Also, they never cook your eggs correctly and the toast is never toasted. How do you mess up breakfast? You're a diner!!
2014-09-14,1,Horse shit. Refused to add spinach to my skillet. How is it impossible to add spinach to a skillet? Apparently very impossible. First time coming here all the way from Australia, never again. Fuck this place in its shitty butthole.
2014-09-13,1,Make sure you check your food because they substitute, when they say lump crab they use imitation crab.  Wouldn't suggest this place.
2014-09-13,4,Probably the best breakfast/brunch in Hoboken if your order the right stuff. Let's face it, Malibu is a diner and in NJ no less - it is not going to be fancy or have trendy food. Don't walk in and order something complicated. Stick to the basics and you'll be happy: pancakes, eggs, waffles, fries and Greek salad are all quite good. Service is fast even when the place is packed. They handle big groups well and also do fine with screaming kids. Speaking of... The back room tends to be very loud at brunch time on the weekends, so try for a booth up front.
2014-09-09,1,This was my 1st time at this diner and I have had better Diner experience The service was horrible. So my hubby and I went in for brunch on a Sunday. We were seated very quickly since it was not crowed which I thought was pretty good. We waited for 10mins until our waitress came over. We order a few teas to drink and ask if we could have them in a foam cup, she told us no, because of health reasons... UHH! WHAT?! Okk, so no big deal, we order and got our teas. We then ordered our food and it came out very quickly.We proceeded to eat when we notice the forks and knives were a bit dirty, so we asked if we could have plastic knives and fork, she straight up told us NO.... Like REALLY! When we asked why, she said, and I quote, " we don't serve them at the dine in table"... OH REALLY!! This is not the 1st diner we have dine and asked for plastic knife or fork. SO we packed up our food and LEFT THAT PLACE!!Like for real son... Plastic fork and knives for your customers is not going to hurt. Obvisoly she didnt care to serve us, so we left and took our business elsewhere.Will NOT return there even if they were the last place on earth to eat...LOL!!
2014-09-06,3,What has happened to the Malibu? Same good food but they need some new hostesses.  Went today, no one came over to seat me ; finally i sat myself. Best worker there ,victor, immediately brought me a tall glass of ice water.  Then. Nothing. No one. Came over. 5 minutes passed. Then ten. . I went to the ladies room came. Back.    No menu on the table. , no set up.   New people had come in and were given menus   And set ups.  I asked who served them and told them i  was there first and wasn't going to wait any longer.  Suddenly, a waitress appeared. Took 25 minutes. For someone to come and take order.  Rude hostess who ignored me and a waitress who came over only because i threatened to leave  .   Very petty !  I have encountered bad attitudes there before ;  there was no manager on duty to oversee the staff which. May have contributed to the poor service.   In any case,  it's a must to avoid!  ,
2014-08-27,4,It's a diner guys, don't expect to get the best meal of your life.  Obviously one would get the standard diner fare when visiting..cheeseburger, fries, eggs, etc.  As far as diner food goes, I love Malibu and I've been coming here since I was a little girl.  Service is super friendly and efficient and food is piping hot and delish!  I always tend to get the same meals and never had a complaint.  Stay away from this place after hours in Hoboken because it gets filled with loud and obnoxious drunks and I give the staff all the credit in the world for putting up with those assholes.  I gave it 4 stars because for a diner, it can be a bit pricey..I mean you could venture to a nicer restaurant and pay just as much.
2014-08-17,3,With Sunday Brunch you can get a bloody mary, mimosa or bellini for $2. That's good enough reason for me! The French Toast was huge - 4 large pieces with strawberries on top, well made. Had 2 poached eggs with corned beef hash, also good, nothing out of the ordinary, bacon wasn't crispy - not the way I liked it and maybe I should've asked them to make it so.Service was fast efficient and cheerful - very competent, and the food came out quicker than expected even though it was full.
2014-07-30,1,Came to this place starving to death and ordered scallops that was badly fishy and made me sick in my stomach. The worst part is when we asked for a different order, the manager refused for a reason that more than half is eaten!!!
2014-07-27,3,Seems as if they have renovated a bit in the back room, looks good. Came in for a quick bite with some friends and the waiter seemed to be rushing a bit. Which actually annoyed a friend of mine, immensely. Ordered the Texas Burger, was pretty great, bacon was yummy. This diner is ok, probably not a place I would visit regularly.
2014-07-15,5,Great place to come and eat with some friends the food is exceptional and the portions are great , I would recommend the desserts lol , free parking and the service is good ...prices are reasonable and make a great dinner for late night. Will come again!
2014-06-27,2,Terrible service, and it wasn't even busy. Can't really complain about the food, it's a dinerFirst and last time I will ever go there.
2014-06-18,2,2.5 stars.Sub par service.Sub par cleanliness.Food is typical diner food.This place would be out of business probably if it wasn't in Hoboken, a brunch capital in it's own right.
2014-05-31,5,We ordered the eggs "Chesapeake". The quality and taste of the food was probably 3.5 stars... But the quantity... Dear god! So much food! It's like there was a coup in the crab kingdom and all the victims landed on our plate in a delicious hollandaise grave!The service was fast and friendly and the place is clean. Oh... Yeah... 2 dollar mimosas on the weekends? For the win
2014-05-22,2,This felt like a classic Seinfeld episode... I pictured Jerry and George getting heated and arguing whether or not they should complain... but in the end, it was just too comical to say anything.Entire staff is occupied joining their tables for a meal, watching the game, or practicing their comedy routine with their table in broken english.Busboy brings 2 drinks to our table (which we did not order)  when we politely inform him they are not ours... he chuckles, shakes his head, and walks off showing his incredible mullet.Waiter delights us both with 2 racist jokes about Mexicans crossing the border (who is Mexican himself)45 minutes for 2 sandwiches (diner fairly empty) and when they come out, of course the order is wrong.  The waiter apologizes and then proceeds to make fun of the cooks by offensively imitating the way they speak.at least the food was edible when we got it.
2014-05-18,5,What a great Hoboken find. Granted it is the only diner in the boken but at least it's a good one! Came here for brunch with friends and parked in their FREE PRIVATE LOT. The skillet was recommended to me and it was awesome. I got the bacon and sausage skillet with scrambled eggs. My friends got tuna melts that they also said were great. Our server was very pleasant and attentive. We never had to ask for refills and our food came out quickly. Can't wait to go back!
2014-04-12,4,worth of money lol and we ate the special -- the fish dishes are all really good!  Veal is good. Special menu is a big combo. All good :)  a bit too much food though
2014-04-10,3,Conveniently located on north end of the Hoboken, Malibu dinner is  your typical New Jersey diner. It is also the only diner in the city of Hoboken so you don't have much of choice. I agree with rest of the yelpers here, they are bit pricey compared to other similar diners but its Hoboken so I suppose the higher cost is justified..?!? I eaten here few times--and tried to eat here on few early weekend nights but there was no parking. They have limited parking with a small lot which is not sufficient for the 2am drunk & hungry crowd. The food here is okay but they have a huge menu so there are plenty of variety/choices. My favorites: any breakfast food or chicken Panini with the seasoned fries. The service has been always good every time I ate here--and always left this place satisfied.
2014-04-09,3,Good food and good variety. Sadly it took 7 minutes for a server to notice me after I was promptly seated. She was apologetic but as a visitor in town who came in from the cold, getting a coffee order in pronto would have been nice, especially since it wasn't bustling when I came in.e place looks well cared for and I would come back if I knew I'd get more expedient service.
2014-03-30,3,Not often in my dining experiences do I wait to post my reviews, but upon my visit to the Malibu Diner I felt I had to wait to appreciate the significance of what happened. Tina Fontane. Remember that name, as it shall live in infamy. Tina was a young girl, growing up in Buck's County, Pennsylvania, with dreams of big city living and sparkly dancing shoes. At the supple age of fifteen she left her home, with nothing but a cloth rucksack and an advanced case of psoriatic arthritis which made her really hate those Phil Mickelson commercials.Fatefully landing at the Malibu Diner, she quickly fell in with the wrong crowd. Bikers, mostly - just causing havoc, nothing illegal. Once she discovered her uncanny ability to pour consistent portions of pancake batter she saw her way out of the struggle. She left her man, Chazz, and started a new life, away from the perils of the streets, pouring one pancake at a time. You only do two pancakes, she used to tell herself, the one you go in, and the one you go out.Bottom line is, Tina's an idiot and always burns the pancakes. Worst thing on the menu if you ask me.
2014-03-22,1,The food was not very good and the links we had w the eggs were old and smelled very badly. We were still charged for them. Terrible customer service.
2014-03-22,2,Eh. Is how I'd describe my experience here at this diner. I will preface this review by saying I've always has a plethora of diners near me for all 30 years of my life, so my standard is high. Pros: Decent diner decor, 24/7, hostess was friendly warm and attentive. Waitress was attentive and quickCons: gf egg white omelette the feta cheese was only on one side not spread on the whole plate. Toast was burnt. Table initially thought to be clean was slightly greasy. Overall for the only option in hoboken, what can you say or do? Cheaper than going to a local bunch spot and spend twice as much. I'd come back as a last second cheap option if were feeling lazy.
2014-02-22,5,I've been coming to Malibu since I first moved to Hoboken in 2009 and it's always a very solid diner experience. Whether grabbing breakfast or lunch, service is fast and friendly. The food is always good in a nice clean atmosphere. For a diner, what more could you want?
2014-02-15,4,Having had breakfast here in the past we decided to try it for lunch.First off, they have a huge menu so deciding what to have is a bit tough - it all sounds great! And, here's my second point, the food is good! About what you'd expect from a diner which is not a bad thing at all!The interior is much nicer than you'd expect and the staff is friendly and prompt.If we are looking for a quick bite we will remember this place for sure.
2014-02-12,3,Average diner food. My boyfriend loved the Challah pancakes. They have $2 bellinis, bloody marys and mimosas on Sundays =)
2014-01-26,3,I went after a night out because my sister was hungry at 2AM. I wasn't so I just got the seasoned waffle fries. It's very clean inside compared to other diners I've been to. They give you water as soon as you're seated. There's also a parking lot which would have been nice had I known that beforehand.
2014-01-07,1,I went here to have breakfast, after I was done I tipped out my waiter $15 cash & charged everything else to my card. even though my waitress was not that attentive I still tipped because I was once a waiter and I know how hard it can be at times. While I was looking at my bank statements within the week I notice my waiter took an extra 5 dollar for her self out of my card. I reported this matter, mistakes do not just happen, it can be a penny at the end of the day, I work hard for my money & I was very fair towards her by tipping her $15 compared to the officers she had that day that only left her a $4 tip but for her to take money out of my account just like that is wrong, the next week I went here again and confronted the waitress privately & told her she's wrong and that's stealing especially when someone is generous to you, she did not apologize she just asked me did I tell a manager and I told her No, I know it's hard to get a job now in days, but if I where you don't do that again, it's wrong and left.
2014-01-03,4,If you're looking for a typical Jersey diner experience, the 'Bu is your place. I've lived two blocks away for 4 years and it is my go-to place for breakfast and a quick, cheap dinner.Love their dinner specials! And Eggs Benny!My boyfriend and I have our fave waitress, too. Most staff is pretty nice (except hostesses at the register).If you're expecting an amazing experience, remember: it's just a diner. A really good diner.
2013-11-10,3,Really, just a totally solid diner in Hoboken. Staff is friendly and prices are totally reasonable (see $2 mimosas and bloody Mary's for weekend brunch) and it's clean and nice enough. Will the food or ambiance blow your mind? No, it's a diner and that's not what diners do, but as far as diners go, it's a solid spot.
2013-11-09,2,Not a great experience.  Food was below average as diners should be consistent.  Ordered a long iced tea as it was way too strong and un drinkable.  Lastly I felt that the price was high for a diner.  Only go unless its late night and everything else is closed.
2013-10-21,5,As if being open 24/7 wasn't enough, the service amazing the good is down right mouthwatering !! I would highly recommend this diner to any and all friends and family!!! Oh and did I mention there's a parking lot? All around score =)
2013-10-21,3,Petty solid meal and reasonably priced.  However I went here on a Saturday morning and sure it was a little crowded, but that's no excuse for poor service.  Waitress took about 5 mins to come over and never checked on us, and the Taylor ham wasn't crispy! I'm sorry but if u know you're going to be crowds hire a few more people to work that shift.
2013-06-16,2,I ate at Malibu last night with 4 adults and 3 children. 8 year old hated his hamburger. Mashed potatoes were terrible-unheard of at a New Jersey or Long Island diner. Other food was fine. The place was somewhat empty for a Saturday evening, but the service was still very slow. Our server was speaking with other staff, but we still had to flag her down whenever we wanted anything. Parking was great for the area. Service was slow and not very pleasant.
2013-06-09,3,Well, what can you say about a diner that's located in the northern end of Hoboken? First of all, it's Hoboken that we're talking about, so you know right away that the prices are going to be higher than some other outlying towns.We ate there after a Friday night event, around 11ish, so there wasn't much of a wait. Rather, we were seated instantly seeing that the place looked like it was looking for business. For a diner, I have to say that it's modernized when it comes to decor and ambiance. Honestly, it looked like a diner - something that I expected. Clean I might add.I ordered a chicken pesto panini with sweet potato fries substituted for the normal ones. I really can't say that the sandwich stood out from other things I've tried at other diners, but it certainly was a smidgen better. Satisfying from beginning to end, the chicken pesto panini was evenly portioned and cooked to perfection - and I have to say that the presentation was nice. As for the sweet potato fries, they too were perfectly cooked and presented. Thankfully, they didn't look too greasy, plus, they didn't smother it in salt, which is wonderful in keeping its "healthy" aspect intact.For a diner, the food was good, but not great. However, the only downside is that I could've probably ordered the same exact panini at another diner for less. Simply, that's going to be the deciding thing that would prevent me from making the Malibu Diner by premier diner choice in the area.
2013-06-05,5,Perfect cure for a hangover.  Great service.  Try any one of the benedicts.
2013-06-02,4,We came here on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was packed.  Despite that, service was good and we didn't wait long for the food.  The tilapia and shrimp scampi was excellent, although I was pretty hungry at the time.  The pudding for dessert was kind of solid and didn't look right.I guess this place can be hit or miss, based on the bad reviews.  Still worth a try, I think.
2013-05-22,3,Pros: Average to Good FoodCons: Awkward seating in back roomWent to this place on a Sunday around 11am. No wait which was nice. Sat in the back room. Would of preferred the front where the booths and counter is which feels more like a diner. Back rooms is just a ton of tables, luckily we got seated against a wall.I ordered french toast with two eggs. The french toast was very good and no complaints with the eggs. Coffee was good which is always important but waiter was not that attentive on refills. We were only given the brunch menu which we didn't realize until later when we saw other guest with the normal million page menu found at any diner.Overall good experience and would go back again. Wasn't amazing like some NJ diners.
2013-04-11,1,Probably the worst food I've had in Hoboken in my 5 years living here. My friend ordered french toast and it was covered in uncooked egg residue. I had a sandwich that was so dry I needed a pitcher of water to be able to get through it. Also about 25% of my french fries were green. No thank you.
2013-04-07,1,I go to Malibu regularly on Sundays with my girlfriend for a late breakfast - but after today it might be my last visit to Malibu.  We got there around noon, so it was understandably busy for a Sunday.  So they tell us we have to wait 15 minutes for a table. Ok fine no problem. We sit down.  10 minutes later someone finally comes up to us asking what we want to drink.  We order iced coffee.  10 minutes later he finally brings them.  The table next to us that sat down AFTER us was finished their entire mean before our food ever came out.Now - let me just say that I would never leave a bad review based one one waiter or waitress - I understand that service sometimes sucks.  But we complained to two managers about a multitude of things - wait time, service, extra charges on the bill - and both managers (one male, one female) basically told us to go pound sand.  I have given a lot of my money to this place in the past year and I am very put off by this place.  Suffice to say I will not be going back.
2013-04-02,2,Food is ok, the service is not good. I would not go out of my way to eat here. The parking lot is a nice convenience but it's not that big.
2013-03-09,5,Protein omelette, egg whites, scrambled with grilled chicken, home fries and wheat toast dry is very clean, gat quality and fast service on weekday mornings
2013-02-26,1,Worst diner ever, my friend and I went there at 2am. Everyone we saw sat in the front but they seated us in the back for some reason. Not sure if we were Asian and whatever it is.  Next 10 minutes, all I see if Asian in the back and all other people were in the front. Seems legit. Food is horrible by he way.
2013-02-09,5,I love diners and this is a super decent one. And $3 for 2 heaping scoops of pure chocolate and vanilla, you so beat some local [read in: pricier] competitors on value.  =P
2013-01-28,1,This review was written a while back (2012). It's saved in the draft and I forgot to publish. Here goes...Not sure if it's because of 4th of July, but I waited for a glass of water for 15 minutes. Then waited to place an order for 30 minutes, and again waited for food to arrive for 30 minutes, but ended up telling me that, there is no more ribs in the house so I need to order something else on the menu. So far my food hasn't arrived yet as I'm typing this on my cell phone...
2013-01-08,1,Food is ok. Service suck and it's overpriced.
2013-01-07,3,This is an average NJ diner.  The food is neither good nor bad.  They are open pretty late (if not 24 hours), so you can always get some food after a night of drinking.  It is good when there is nothing else open and you really need some food.  But I wouldn't seek this place out when I have many other options.
2012-12-26,2,I'm from New Jersey. I know that Denny's has about as much in common with a "diner" as a Ellio's frozen pizza does with a true NY slice. That being said, I've had "real" diner food. Real diner food clogs the arteries in the most fulfilling of ways and is a panacea for the common hangover (okay, it may involve some egg residue on your supposedly "clean" fork).Is Malibu "real" diner food? Nope. Is it better than Denny's? Of course. Food-wise, I've yet to have yet to be wow-ed. Eggs are "meh," fries are of the defrosted variety, and burgers, well, aren't so burger-ish.Pros: cheaper than most other places in Hoboken, $2 mimosas/Bloodys on Sundays, ridiculously overwhelming menu (in keeping with NJ diner tradition)Cons: long waits, quality of food is less than stellar, noisy, for large parties, they supposedly will only split a check four waysDig under the couch cushions, find some extra change, and spring for Anthony David's brunch or suck it up and get a breakfast sandwich from somewhere like Little Grocery. Sorry, Malibu. You are no Americana (which, if you find yourself in Hightstown, you SHOULD GO TO)...
2012-11-16,3,Its your standard diner, I don't know what else you'd expect .  I don't wanna give it a 5 or 4 because the food is exactly the same at every good diner I go too.  Its a reliable spot for late nights or early mornings.  Wouldn't recommend for dinner.
2012-10-13,4,defintely the nicest diner I have ever been too. Love that is open 24/7 there skillets are awesome late night
2012-10-09,1,Food was ok, that's why it gets one star ...but the prices for custom items are ridiculous .. I asked for a broccoli and cheddar omelette (oh the cheddar will be extra sir) ok so I thought $1 more.. I ordered that and a diet cola...$13.25. Wtf... I complained and the manager says we use the best Vermont cheddar $3 extra .. And $3 for a fountain soda (small) I will have to find a rich uncle before I go back !!
2012-10-02,2,I have been to this diner sooo many times and I always come out thinking that they can do better. I feel it is overpriced for the quality and presentation of their food. I am a huge coffee drinker and sometimes crave it on my late nights out. This place serves awful coffee. I mean, how can you mess up coffee? Anyway, i have to say that I do like their French toast. Notice I said "like" not the best either. The service is inconsistent so cross your fingers you get lucky on that one. Overall: a good place when it is late and you options are limited. I definitely could do without this one though. Sorry Malibu:/
2012-09-28,2,As far as diners go, this one is... Eh.  Typical diner food, but I've never been super impressed with anything I've ordered.  Good place for Saturday or Sunday brunch- They have mimosa and bloody mary specials (I believe they're $3 each, but don't quote me on that... it might even be $2).  For breakfast, their skillets are pretty decent if you're in the mood for a heart attack on a plate.  Had the florentine omlette today and was disappointed that I couldn't find a trace of cheese in it, even though it was supposed to have feta.  Staff is semi-friendly, semi-cranky.  I don't like cranky people.  They bring down my mood.  In any case, it's the closest diner around, so if you're in the mood for diner food, suck it up and deal.  xo
2012-09-28,3,LIke I said in my past review ... it has it's ups and downs.It's on an upswing again (went with a group ... my only reason to go here).  May also help when you don't go with a crowd of over 10 people in the middle of the night, but they make a nice Crab Cake Benedict (the Chesapeake?) early in the morning.Malibu, I congratulate you on your promotion out of my Nothing to See Here List
2012-09-09,4,My husband and I come here every time we visit Hoboken. Don't miss the brunch with Bloody Marys, Bellinis, and mimosas!
2012-09-02,3,Not the best diner I've been to and not the worst.  Service was not friendly and not great following up with coffee, etc.  Food was good though.  Standard diner fare.  Best feature of this diner by far is they have their own FREE parking lot.  If you've gone out to do anything in Hoboken then you know what I'm talking about.  One add point of note:  I ordered decaf coffee and my mug had no handle.  Is that a thing?  Not sure, never seen that before ever.
2012-07-30,1,The food is great but don't sit near the  waitresses when they have nothing better than TALK ABOUT YOU in "their language" because knowing enough Russian and Polish I knew they were not kind words. Even if I don't know Croatian
2012-07-16,4,I have been going to the Malibu for literally 20+ years. I have seen it through it renovations and changes. I am fan. Not everyone is, but I am. The menu and selection are really good. Food and service are usually OK and they are open 24/7. Better yet, the have parking!
2012-07-07,4,Free parking while eating in Hoboken? YES! I always go to this diner for a bite to eat as it is easily assesible and always find a spot to park in their lot. That's a big issue in Hoboken. The diner. Offers the standard fare and has been of decent quality and is a great place to stop and catch a bite. They ahve a wide assortment of desserts and i usually order the cheeseburger deluxe and it always hits the spot! Good find!
2012-05-21,1,This has got to be the worst place we've eaten in umpteen years. Most in our party ordered the prime rib special, medium rare and not one of us received anything remotely near "rare."  It looked like pot roast with none of the taste, and a tough one at that.  Even the steak knives couldn't cut through this meat. The green beans tasted like canned and the mashed potatoes were from a box.  Only the salad was palatable.  To make matters worse, the owner was nasty, even though our waiter did his best to make everyone happy. Never again will we go to this place. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
2012-05-10,3,Being from South Jersey, I know what a diner is SUPPOSED to be. The "Boo", as everyone in Hoboken calls it, is simply mediocre. The several times I've gotten the eggs and home fries, I've been left wanting more. Not that I was hungry, it just tasted like they had given me frozen home fries and mediocre eggs.... -=Shrug=-I dunno... would I go back? Sure... Would I recommend it? M'eh...
2012-04-17,2,Ouch, I've expected better... Then again, who would order stuff clams at a diner? Apparently my friend did... Which is pretty much a batter ur eating..as for the clams... ur not gonna find much in there. Although my eggs benedict was quite good... if it had some real hollandaise sauce! Instead I had the chicken gravy... or turkey? hmmm... But I have to admit. The waffles & Ice cream with whip cream on top is monsterious! Probably the only dish that was decent. Other then that.. Wasn't really worth the stop by.
2012-03-25,3,Well, it's better than the Spa Diner....Growing up in North Jersey with some of the best diners around, it's sad that Hoboken doesn't have an awesome diner. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad. Food is average, it's a pretty decent size and they have all the diner standards. They have $2 brunch drinks on the weekends and supposedly a $15 dinner special....although I'd never come here for dinner, no matter how cheap it is. Diners are for breakfast foods, disco fries and grilled cheese. They also have a parking lot, but it kinda sucks. It's a pain to get into, and we saw a car keep hitting the car parked across from it when they were trying to get out of the spot. Hard to determine if it was from the small size of the lot, or because this person was just an idiot with a huge car. Seriously, never a dull moment at a Jersey diner!
2012-02-23,3,Malibu is a pretty standard NJ diner. They have a large menu and it gets very crowded on the weekends. The food is OK, nothing to write home about. The service is hit or miss. I have been there sometimes when it is good and sometimes when the waitresses are crabby and unattentive. Even when they are slow, they can sometimes act as if it pains them that you are in the restaurant.... excuse me... aren't you being paid? Do you not get the tips I leave? The reason for the three stars instead of two is the weekend bellini and bloody mary specials! That's is the one reason I agree to go there!
2012-02-20,1,The group of people, especially young ladies, who occupy or control the casher area are horrible... No respect at all and feel like they are superior than others. I hope they are the relatives of the owner(s). Otherwise... good luck for their future careers. However, to be fair, the quality of foods the services from on-floor servers are fine.
2012-02-16,3,OOOOO MALIBU!!!  From brunch to lunch to dinner to late night, this spot always has good food that can satisfy any craving 24/7.  For a place that does justice to a typically large diner menu, the service leaves much to be desired.  Every time I go we end up with a table cluttered with water glasses, Rhett Butler servers that frankly don't give a damn, and a painstakingly drawn out wait for seemingly simple cuisine.Despite the shortfalls, I will continue to come here because 24/7 diners are awesome and the food fits the bill.NOTE:  For late night adventurers, if you ask for bread it comes out as GARLIC BREAD.  Excellence.
2012-02-14,1,Yuck! This place is a disgrace to NJ diners!  I've eaten there late @ night and for lunch and between being ignored at the door to be seated to the lousy service and bland food. I will NOT return to this place. Spend a few more shekels and head down the street to the City Bistro restaurant for a killer meal!.
2012-02-11,4,Solid diner for breakfast.  They have a "protein omelette" with eggs whites, broccoli  and chicken which is pretty good and their pancakes are delicious.  Its a little out of the way but they do have a small parking lot.
2012-01-30,4,I think I have had the best diner pancakes here.  Their breakfast potatoes are the best I have ever had and I do love good hash browns or home fries.  Our waiter was very pleasant.  Not a bad place to go an have a diner breakfast.
2012-01-26,3,The food = always consistent. The guys in the back can obviously deliver on some bacon n' eggs etc. (The only reason I gave three stars)The service = WTF?! I almost feel guilty for making the waitresses work, or maybe thats how they want me to feel. (Sorry if working at a diner isn't your life's path)"Ill have the pancake and eggs with bacon...hold the attitude"
2012-01-25,2,This place is really not all that great compared to other NJ diners. It gets the benefit of being the only joint open 24 hours in a drunk town (spa doesn't count). They recently remodeled but it doesn't look or smell especially clean. I'm pretty sure if they had some real competition they would have to step their game up but since they don't, they can get away with serving egg slop to 3am drunks.
2012-01-04,5,The Malibu diner had never disappointed me. The quality and quantity is above average, yet the prices are below average.   You definitely get your money's worth. Where else in Hoboken can you get a soup, entree, glass of wine, coffee and fresh piece of pie or cake for $10? Being open 24 hours is also a huge plus. The other amazing thing about the Malibu Diner is their super cheap Take Out menu.  If you order off the Take Out menu Monday - Friday from 4pm - 7pm, you get a drink and and a meal for about $6.As diners go, this one not only meets your expectations, but usually exceeds them.
2011-12-07,3,Another spot down memory lane. In high school we used to frequent this place since all you can do in HS at the time was hang out at diners. Yeah, we were cool. The food was average. Good burgers. Always great service. Always bumped into kids we used to play in soccer. It was inexpensive quality food. Their fries with gravy needed some work. Their mozz sticks were always good as well.
2011-11-12,2,even though they completely remodeled the place. the food is still bland and service was ehh
2011-11-09,5,Wow! I cannot say enough good things about the Malibu Diner.I came here with 3 friends on a busy Sunday morning.  We were seated in 5 minutes.  The atmosphere was cozy and inviting.  All of us got omlettes which were AMAZING. The homefries were good too and the coffee was strong which we all liked (it seems like the coffee is always weak at diners, no?)The best part about our experience was our waiter, Martin.  He was awesome! I'm a waitress so I tend to be very particular when it comes to service.. but he was amazing.  He was always there when we needed him and when we asked for something he was back within minutes with our request. Malibu diner is an A+!
2011-08-14,2,I've been going to the Malibu for years. Typical diner fare but the service is great. Recently though, I got a HUGE hair in my food. When I complained all I got was a blank stare and my check! Won't be going back anytime soon.
2011-07-29,1,Terrible service. They wouldn't substitute at A DINER. They were rude and the owner didn't care to help at all!
2011-05-31,5,Being from New Jersey, I am a total diner snob. I love going to diners and getting breakfast any time of day, and I ALWAYS judge on their coleslaw! Malibu was recently renovated and is a wonderful diner! I have been here a couple of times now, usually getting a delicious omelet and side of cole slaw. Their cole slaw is probably some of the BEST I have ever had! Service is also great when it comes to refilling coffee and water. Another great feature is on the weekends, they have brunch drink specials: $2 for bellinis, mimosas and bloody marys! A great way to start your day on a weekend in Hoboken. I will definitely go back for more!
2011-04-17,3,I am forced to go here too often and we always have to wait forever to get a menu.  They need more wait staff.  They are getting pricey too.  Good parking situation and portions are good.
2011-03-07,4,Holy shit this place may have slightly restored my hope for New Jersey(not likely).They were able to turn over a ton of hungover Hoboken party-goers with a line out the door and managed to sit 7 people in less than 15 minutes. That was an impressive way to start the meal and it got better from there. I tried the Challah french toast and I'm still thinking about it days later. As a Jew I'm rarely impress by Challah but I've definitely come around. Thank you Malibu Diner!
2011-03-06,4,Diners reminds me of High School years when all of us just got our drivers license and took our parents minivans and drove to the nearest diner in town and made the life of the waitresses a living hell. This diner is a great alternative to all the restaurant in Hoboken and it has parking! The place is spacious and doesn't smell like a typical beat up old diner! We had brunch here on a Saturday and ordered omelets and eggs benedict, which all turned out to be pretty good.Service was super fast and the waiter kept the chit chat to a bare minimum (which is always a plus).
2011-02-02,4,Love it...From gyros, to breakfast, to some of their wraps menu...grilledd cheese is sometimes soggy, but the disco fries are gooood
2011-01-06,1,I love diners; unfortunately, this diner is a no-go for me. I've dined here 2 times and the food overall is subpar, service is slow, and management is terrible. Also, they served us ROTTEN food. Go at your own risk, and if you do dine there INSPECT YOUR FOOD.If you want the whole story keep reading:My friend was served ROTTEN broccoli (part of her pasta dish) and we didn't notice right away, but when we both inspected the broccoli and saw the black and gray spots, we told our waiter, who talked to the manager and came back saying they'd take 20% off. We refused this option and asked to speak to the manager. She showed up at our table and stood there silently staring at us until my friend asks, "Are you the manager?" We begin discussing what happened and my friend says she refuses to pay for the meal cause it was ROTTEN. The manager NEVER apologized once and claimed she should pay because she ate most of the chicken. Well, she wouldn't have eaten the dish at all if she knew it was ROTTEN. Eventually we got it through to her that we don't care about taking 20% off, and we just want the whole dish taken off the check. She said fine and stalked off, again without one word of apology. Seriously dine at your own risk.
2010-11-10,5,listen... i know it's pretty hard to screw up a waffle. but the waffle i had for dinner last night (sidenote: love breakfast for dinner!) was delicious. our waitress was attentive and patient, considering we didn't know what to order even after she came over three times. my partner in crime for the night ordered a chicken wrap. a little messy, yes. but he said it was delicious and satisfied his craving. and the french fries? standard diner fries, certainly no complaints. there's no reason not to give this place 5 stars, for it's a typical jersey diner... and i am ok with that.
2010-10-08,3,Good for breakfast after a night out in Hoboken... have been here many times.  Decent food at decent prices. Staff never seems all too happy, but no complaints.
2010-10-08,4,My review is purely off of taste because I didn't pay for my food. Went here around 3am after a good night in the city and was not disappointed. I went to a lot of late night diners back in NC so I was excited to go to my first up here. I always get some kind of loaded hash browns so I asked for that which they didn't have but they did have some type of homestyle potatoes so I went with that. Customizing the potatoes wasn't on the menu but the server was nice and said I could get whatever I want so I got a large order and added bacon, cheese, and mushrooms. The order took a little long from what I remember but it was pretty amazing. Definitely try it if you're nearby
2010-09-12,5,one of my favorite places to eat in hoboken. day or night great food. special are always amazing too. very very reasonably priced and great staff every time i have been there.
2010-09-02,2,Stopped here on our way out of NYC as we usually love diners.  This one is a huge dissapointment!  The waiter was ok, the food was average.  But they also don't give free refills for soda and don't mention that.  You get a small glass, they still charge you 2 bucks and no refills.Definately not going there again!
2010-07-25,1,Ghetto place ... I wouldn't recommend eating here unless you're hammered and very hungry.
2010-05-29,5,I am from Boston and make sure that every time I come to NYC/NJ I visit "The Bu"   I have ordered a number of things over the years and would recommend everything.  I enjoy the breakfast food and whenever they have a special I tend to lean that way. Last time I was there they had a peanut butter banana pancake that was amazing! For your morning to begin I would also recommend the French Toast, Waffles or Eggs Benidict. If lunch or dinner is more of your style you can never go wrong starting with the super sampler. I would recommend any of there sandwiches esp a Burger or the Pastrami Panin. If you are in the mind for something larger try the Linguini con Camberi or even Roast Sirloin or Beef, Au. Overall I would highly recommend Malibu to anyone that wants to have a great meal and friendly service.
2010-05-23,2,Whether or not you'll be satisfied with your food here is really dependant on what you order. They get some things right, other things they don't. The food portions aren't as generous as you'd expect most NJ diners to have. The service can be bad or good depending on who your waiter/waitress is. One night, we had a really nice, accomodating guy; another night, we had an aloof older woman who was missing for most of our dinner. If you're like me and you go to diners only in the evening, you'll probably catch the drunk crowd from nearby bars. It's a lot like college. So if you can't laugh at the 30 year old frat boys, it's best to avoid this place on weekend nights. Do order the Napoleon for dessert, though. It's delicious!
2010-05-15,3,A decent diner. Specials include a glass of house wine.  The red was very sweet, almost like spiked grape juice. The food was fine but Topp's Diner, 15 minutes away in Harrison makes this look like a dumpy greasy spoon by comparison.   Pretty decent value and service was excellent.
2010-04-10,4,My 1st time experience @ Malibu Diner was FANTASTICO!My boyfriend and another friend all ordered from the ***Friday Chef Special*** of the menu.  To our SURPRISE, the special was an extremely great DEAL!  The dinner special description:  FRIDAY CHEF SPECIAL served with a house salad or cup of soup, a glass of wine, cake of the day, and a cup of coffee of tea.To start off, I decided on the house salad with ranch sauce.  Then for my entre, I ordered the Maryland Lump Crab Cakes (Three Crab Cakes Served with Homemade Honey Mustard Sauce) with 2 sides which I chose broccoli and rice.  Afterwards, dessert of any choice had to be the delicious triple chocolate cake. And it all ended with a cup of tea!OMG, all of the above only cost me $13.95 + tax / tips of course but $13.95 for all of the above was an unbelievable PRICE!After eating everything, I was stuffed like a stuffed bear!  It was definitely more than I can even ask for.  I was totally satisfied with the abundance amount of food and service (waitress Kelly).8 last words:  TOO MUCH TO EAT BUT I LOVED IT!
2010-03-09,4,This is a good spot even on the NJ diner scale, which says a lot since most are pretty good at what they do.  I've come here for breakfast and late night after bars.  Service is still on-point if you're a small to medium group.  I usually order breakfast and the food's always cooked well and tasty.  This is also entertaining to go and watch the rest of the drunk zombies late night.  Never a big line except on sunday mornings you could have a small wait.
2009-12-04,5,Great NJ diner!Love the dinner selections here.  Not as costly as the rest of hoboken everyone else has to remember its hoboken.  If you want a cheap diner go to paterson!
2009-11-05,1,Let's see...weird strict "no substitutions" rules (I wanted a soda instead of the free wine and got charged $2), obnoxious staff, and bad food (the chicken was so tough it was inedible and the potatoes were hard and tasted stale).  Which was the worst part?  Who cares?  I would never go again.
2009-09-24,3,This is one of the few diners that I've been to that have a teeny tiny menu.  I went for my Sunday morning hangover breakfast.  At the time, I was really craving a breakfast sandwich and sigh...Malibu did not have any.  Next option, I went with one of the skillets.  The waiter working that day was prompt, quick, and friendly.  The food came out much, much faster than I had expected and it wasn't bad.  The skillet consisted of small dice red potatoes (i think red) mixed with bits of bacon and sausage which is then topped with shredded cheddar and two eggs (your choice...my choice....over easy).  I was hungover so this food was pretty good.  I wish the potatoes were a little more crisp, but in the end, it wasn't awful and I'd probably come back again.
2009-09-02,1,Definitely more expensive than most NJ diners, and the food is even WORSE! The burger really sucked (dry, tasteless, bad bread) and I had an order of ribs that were really chewy and had this weird (and not in a good way) sauce. The fries were soggy and tasteless. I also ordered some soup (whatever the soup of the day was) and it was much worse than what you can get from a decent can of Campbells or Progresso. Decor was tacky, but the place was relatively clean. There is a free parking lot, and you never have to worry about it filling up because I have never seen the restaurant busy (and I drive by it all the time at night)Will not go back... ever. If you want a Diner in NJ - try Brownstone, or even CoachHouse.
2009-09-01,1,Not impressed.While open 24-7, the menu is limited for the mornings during breakfast, and I'm used to getting a full menu at a diner all day long.The eggs are okay, done exactly as we asked, but the ham is dry, and the home fry potatoes are completely tasteless.. going to have to try some other food there for lunch/dinner instead to see if this place really is overall horrible.At least they have parking for free.
2009-08-01,3,It is what is as a diner.  Big menu, consistently executed.  The 1- and 2-star reviews are a bit mystifying to me.  Do avoid the wine that comes "free" with the specials -- in this day of truly delicious bottles of wine at retail under $20 (i.e, $1.00 a small glass at most at wholesale), it seems a bit churlish to pour whatever it is they pour.
2009-07-24,3,Malibu is a fairly standard diner. it's a bit costlier than Spa, but has a larger menu and a bar (or at least I recall a bar).I find their breakfast food a bit better than the lunch/dinner food...even at 2 AM. haha. the fried zucchini strips are really good (do they still have those? last time I went they did, but that was a year ago). the shakes are also good!it is also great for groups, as it has a lot of space, whereas Spa can sit maybe 30 people? also, a parking lot. which my neighbor nearly missed and then almost drove into the front door of Malibu, but that's a whole other story...plus, now we all know the Malibu is the Watergate of Hoboken, thanks to the big Cammarano corruption scandal! yay!
2009-07-09,1,i was debating whether to give this place a one or a two. food wise, it's pretty bad as far as diners come. price-wise, it's also pretty bad for a diner. appetizers were a full $2 more expensive than other comparable diners. wait is sometimes long, even when the place isnt packed. the only saving grace is this place has a parking lot, but even this is sometimes too full.nope.. can't give it a 2. it's a 1.5 at best, and rounded down for all the aforementioned reasons. for late night eats.. youve got a few more options in hoboken. none really uptown, but if youre driving and youre near the malibu, might as well make the extra 5 minute drive to coach house in north bergen.
2009-05-30,2,For what NJ's got to offer in diners, Malibu Diner didn't really win me over. My sister and I were craving a corned beef sandwich so we went on a Saturday afternoon. I suppose most people are dining at a cafe of some sort down Washington and such, so it wasn't too busy - meaning quick to get seated and served. two stars for that. We ordered a milkshake to share. The portion is just right for one person; not super big like typical diners where you expect to share liberally between two people. Our waiter took our order for two corned beef sandwiches. I wish he had told us that it would be SUPER dry and to consider getting a reuben sandwich instead. It literally was just slabs of meet smushed into two pieces of dry bread, no cheese, no sauce, nothing else. I suggest that you order a reuben instead because the regular corned beef sandwiches were too dry. My sister ended up doggy-bagging one half of it for our dog at home! Not a fun meal. We got a side of cole slaw and pickles which partially helped to moisten our parched mouths. Total for two sandwiches, a milkshake, a side of fries totalled out to 20 bucks. Not bad but not sure if we'd go back here. We're still in search of that awesome jersey diner... and didn't find it in Hoboken.ps. cash or amex only (they have an atm inside)
2009-05-26,1,The food sucked and it is the most I ever spent for 4 people at breakfast $60!!! sorry i am a college student and I can't afford it. If you like spanish food go to Pon Con Todo waayyy tastier.
2009-05-22,5,Best diner in Hoboken & Jersey City area.  They are open 24 hrs and they serve a large variety of food.  I lived in New Jersey for 7 years & used to hit this place at least 3-4 times a week.  Friendly staff, fresh food & clean 24/7 day restaurant at very affordable prices.  What else do you need?You can never go wrong with their burgers, but always be sure to check their chef specialties.
2009-05-20,5,Love this joint.  Whenever I go to NY I eat here.  The strawberry cheesecake is to die for, best ever had.  Fresh, clean and good food.  I highly recommend this place
2009-04-14,4,Probably my favorite diner, solid food, and not too expensive!!!
2009-04-05,3,For late night eats, this is the place to go.  Came here after a long flight home from the West coast.  Had a major craving for chicken fingers and fries.  Hit the spot perfectly.  My husband had a wrap which was decent too.  mmm.. now I'm craving fries...
2009-03-13,3,This is the first place I ate when I moved to Hoboken and it's the place I go when I'm too tired /lazy to walk, drive or cook (it's only a block away from my apt).  I don't expect too much and therefore am usually not disappointed.  Recently I've been eating breakfast there and it's not bad - nice and cheap - however, DON'T get the 'skillet' breakfasts, they're floating in oil.  Stick with standard fares like a two-egg breakfast plate or french toast.  For lunch and dinner I do recommend the egg salad sandwiches, they're my latest standby on the menu.  Sometimes it's lacking that tangy quality, but a little mustard will do the trick.  Also the waffle fries are really good.    In summation - never go in with high expectations and you'll enjoy it.  I mean it's a diner!  Take it for what it is.
2009-03-02,5,best diner in the world.... for lunch and dinner not for breakfast..... lol good service.... amazing french fries.. the best fries i ever ate in my life ..the fries have like a crispy batter! ughh i want some now!!! lol  great great food! fun times at night.. all the locals go after partying.. very busy place!  i love the philly cheese steak wrap, reuben sandwich, just love everything!
2009-01-26,4,Yes, the Malibu is a diner. But it is a lot of fun too. The comfort food is tasty. I love the corned beef hash. The place feels very COMFORTABLE and retro. Waffles and pancakes are great. And, it has drinks too. Weird for a NJ diner.People watching gets 5 stars...busy, busy,busy and  everybody is here from elderly people to hip young people to babies.  Easy to have a good time here and very relaxed.
2009-01-20,3,This is a diner. The food is diner food. The looks are diner looks. And its open all day and all night like a diner in NJ is supposed to be. They have wierd messed up drinks you can order and they are big so you get 3 stars. oh ya drunk ppl galore!
2008-09-02,3,Slow service and ok food. I had a spinach and goat cheese omellette. I wasn't crazy about it. Ok, it was bad. Super greasy. Steve had the pancakes. They were fluffy and delicious, and I wanted to trade dishes with him. Terrible coffee and tea. Good for hangovers... too bad I wasn't hung over.
2008-03-24,4,My friend led us here after an evening of bar hopping along Sinatra drive.A place that can sit 6 in a matter of minutes on a Saturday night at 3 AM is pretty good in my book.  The menu is nice & extensive, guaranteed to please any 3 AM craving.I had the eggs & sausage which came with home-style potatoes and toast - at no extra charge.  Plus I got 3 generous-size sausages.  Much better value than I would have gotten at Dennys, IHOP, or any other diner that I have been to.  We got our food pretty fast.  I would definitely come back here again, even at a normal hour when I am sober.
2007-09-06,3,As with most diners, the big plus for this place is that it's open 24 hours, which is nice when you have 5 am food cravings :)  It's also great after a night of barhopping.  However, it fails to deliver the necessary satisfaction.  The service was bland, but I'll let it slide because of the time.  The Challah French Toast was more like regular white bread French toast, but it was decent.  I received 3 very large slices and could not eat it all.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese with tomato, which was fine but nothing extraordinary.  Basically, it's fine if nothing else is open :)  Plus, they have parking, which is rare in Hoboken.
2007-01-05,3,I ended up at the Malibu because I was meeting a friend who lives "just up the hill" in Union City. It's a great location, just a few blocks from Washington Street, Hoboken's "downtonwny" area. The diner has its own parking lot, so check it out before you park elsewhere. The food and service are pretty standard diner fare. You won't feel like you're completely putting the servers out just by showing up, but don't expect many smiles. Lots of great local color.
2006-08-14,2,Not a fan of diner's but this place actually wasn't bad. I've seen it for years busy and the parking lot full. The food I ordered was actually decent and the inside was clean. Would return again.
2005-04-30,3,Parking sucks but it's usually packed. Good place to go to if you're heading home and taking the Lincoln back from the City. Recommend a burger, do not recommend the buffalo wings which is basically fried chicken wings with jalapeno sauce.
