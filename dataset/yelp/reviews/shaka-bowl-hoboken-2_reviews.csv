2021-10-02,1,So this place has an ok bowl but 0 consistency. I bought a small and a large and the small weighed the same. So might as well have one size instead of charging people more for nothing. The only reason my large was slightly heavier was because I added toppings at home. Such a disappointment because every time I order here (same exact order) the bowl is different. I need to find a more consistent açaí spot for sure
2021-09-01,4,Big Island açaí bowl is really yummy, a little on the pricier end though. They have a self-order option which makes it easy for a quick pickup
2021-08-27,1,Ordered via Uber Eats. Placed my order at 710pm and was told delivery would be made by 750pm. Food showed up at 830pm with a missing bowl. I called the store and the manager laughed at me and said "I remember putting the bowls in the bag." Excuse me? She also knew exactly which bowl was missing (we ordered 2) so not sure how that could be if she placed both bowls in the bag herself. She finally said "I guess we can refund you for the missing bowl." Yeah that'd be great considering I never received it.... Absolutely horrific experience, made worse by the manager I spoke to. Will absolutely never order from this place again.
2021-08-09,5,I don't get to go to Shaka often, because I live in Jersey City and don't get to Hoboken as often as I'd like. I remember waiting outside the day Shaka Bowl opened back on Monroe st. This was before they even offered delivery, I remember Kiersten saying they wouldn't offer delivery until they figured out a way to ensure the delivery process wouldn't impact the wonderful quality of the food. I've been a convert ever since. The quality of ingredients, the care in which each item is made, the amazing flavors, there's a reason they were able to open the location on Washington St- because they are the bomb- duh. I had the pleasure of trying the avocado egg rolls- just wow. Perfectly crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, perfectly salted, served with the most heavenly dipping sauce. While here I obviously needed to get a poke bowl as well. Layered with super fresh greens and zucchini noodles, topped with loads of fresh Ahi Tuna, loads of yummy fresh toppings, and amazing house spicy Shaka sauce, and Hawaiian Ponzu. My first bite, I audibly said Oh My God. It was truly so delicious, so fresh, the best contrast of textures, literally everything you could possibly ask for. This was 5 hours ago and I cannot stop thinking about how yummy it was. I love that it's a girl power owned business, and another win is they're jersey girls- LOVE IT ALL!
2021-07-30,4,Pretty good açaí bowl, on par with what I get back home at Nugget (local supermarket chain). What really sets it apart are the unique toppings. Vibe/decor was really nice and staff excellent.
2021-07-28,3,Shaka bowl offers a nice space both inside and outside. I especially like their outdoor seating. However, I am so sad that the food really fell short of my expectations. I got the rock shrimp tacos and spicy salmon poke bowl along with two smoothies. Let's start with the shrimp tacos. The shrimp were over cooked and extremely rubbery. Very difficult to eat. If the shrimp had been cooked better, the tacos had some potential to taste good. Now the poke bowl- Firstly, let's call it the bland salmon poke bowl since this had no taste or spice whatsoever. Either someone forgot to add dressing to this bowl, or it just tastes bland. Secondly, the entire bowl is rice. I got 8 small cubes of salmon on top- I counted...The smoothies were not bad. My 3 stars are for the ambience and the smoothies. The food was plain old disappointing.
2021-07-22,4,The rock shrimp tacos were really good! There were like 4-6 shrimps per taco which was a lot! Super good thai chilli flavor and fresh mango.
2021-07-15,5,Holy Shaka-- this spot is delicious! I love pokè bowls, fresh ingredients, and good vibes, and that is what they supply. The fish is fresh, food is prepared on the spot, and service is more than accommodating. My fiancè had the Summer Lava Pokè Special and he loved every bit of it. I made my own Pokè bowl, with Ahi Tuna, edamame, greens, pickled onions, etc. Every portion of my bowl was delicious. We also shared the Lava Rock Shrimp Tacos, which were so bomb!! The shrimp was meaty and perfectly battered, and the sauce with the mango slaw was absurd-- next time I'm getting my own order! We finished our meal with Lattès. He got the Turtle Bay and I got the Shaka Latte. We are big coffee/ espresso people and these were so yum, a definite recommendation. Whether you're grabbing to-go or eating in, Shaka Bowl is great choice. Can't wait to go back!
2021-07-10,4,I only had the tostadas and they were delicious. That's awesome that they put in those tostadas it's life-changing. The only thing I was a little disappointed especially having such a hype about this place was how lazy the staff was. There was a girl sitting down on one of the tables with her phone on her hands and the girl that was in the cash register was half asleep. But the gentleman stepped in and was very nice. Other than that, when it comes to the food, the place was excellent and fresh.
2021-05-22,4,This spot is neat! Met with my friend for a few tacos and a poke bowl and there are no regrets here.  I love the ambient, the neatness and the food! It was a bit spicy for me but I didn't care.  I inhaled by poke bowl and couple of tacos because why not?  My only complaint... they didn't have enough desserts for me to try.  I also ordered a pina colada smoothie (or tropical, not sure) but didn't have much taste to it, it was very sour and very little coconut flavor.  I wish I didn't have to drink it, I could've spend the money to buy more tacos.  Good spot! :)
2021-05-18,4,Great atmosphere and nice place! The lava rock shrimp tacos were really good as well as the chicken tiki tacos. The caulipua tacos on the other hand were very bland and almost sour(hence the 4*). The presentation of the food is really great and wow, the tacos were loaded to the top (as you can see from the photo). I was also amazed at how fast it all got prepared. Overall a good place to come and grab some healthy grub! Would go back for the lava rock shrimp tacos!
2021-03-29,5,My fiancée and I LOVE this place! The food is amazing AND you feel great after eating it! It also keeps you full for a long time. I really love the variety of bowls available. Im especially addicted to the coconut granola so I always add that! But Its fun because you get to try something new all the time because you can add to the different bowls.My fiancée loves the breakfast bowl with the Buffalo sauce. We both like to split the matcha shake which keeps us awake throughout the day! The delivery is always on point and we are relieved to have healthy and delicious options. Thanks!
2021-02-27,2,Ugh, Shaka, I wanted to like you. I really did.I got the large big island bowl and added peanut butter and almonds. Honestly, the bowl didn't taste like anything. It seemed very watered down like they put too much ice in the blend. Sad. Their selection is also limited and they don't offer green smoothie bowls, nor can you customize the base (like having peanut butter blended into it versus on top). On the plus side, they offer two different sizes though I wish their large were bigger. Inside is very cool and staff is friendly. Perhaps better for poke bowls. If you want a smoothie bowl you're better off going to Playa a few blocks away.
2020-12-05,4,Great tasty tacos, especially the lava rock shrimp. The only thing is that the tacos weren't very hot as soon as we got it. We were able to do indoor dining during COVID. The kombucha on tap was good too.
2020-11-03,5,I just recently tried Shaka bowl after seeing they added some new things to their menu. And holy moly the breakfast tacos are some of the best I've ever had. Highly recommend. Their pork empanadas are also delicious. Really happy I tried it. This is going to become my go to spot.
2020-10-19,1,$8 soup tastes like it's straight from a can.Seriously overrated when there's so much good food around. I've had an ok poke bowl here once but it definitely wasn't special.
2020-09-15,5,Omg the tacos are so amazing here. I got the rock shrimp ones and I ate them in like 3 seconds. Sooo yum. Their guac is also great, chips are crispy !!:)
2020-08-03,3,Good for a quick bite. I ordered online through Grub Hub. Their bowls are on the pricier and small side. They have pokè and acaì bowls,I tried one of their poké bowls. You can also make your own bowl. I sat outside to enjoy my bowl and their outside seating is cute and comfy.
2020-07-26,3,I like the healthy options offered here, however, there were fuzzy white hairs in my gojiberries. I'm
2020-07-16,1,Used to be delicious when they first opened. Ordered the other day- portion sizes have gotten so small and nothing was fresh/was very bland. My fiancé and I both got sick after eating. Sucks because we used to love it here :(
2020-07-13,1,I'm so disappointed! I had higher expectations due to the great reviews on here. My order fell way short.One star because they did manage to get everything I ordered in the bowl and it was delivered with utensils and no spills. But that was really the only good things. Otherwise, I wish I could give negative stars. The average should not be so high, it's very deceiving.I ordered the build your own large 24oz poke bowl cause I'm hungry lol. I ordered it with the mixed greens, wild caught salmon, white onion, scallion, cilantro, cabbage, spicy Shaka sauce, and avocado (extra 0.75). The salmon bowl is $13.25 itself. I received barely ANY salmon in my bowl!! Certainly not worth $13.25! This bowl is not 24oz.The avocado is overripe and it's one small slice. I paid 0.75 for a quarter of an avocado at best. Pathetic. Not fresh. My lettuce was wilted and old. I'm upset. It was all drenched in their spicy mayo sauce. Should've got that on the side. Hid some of the old lettuce flavor. Also, it wasn't mentioned on postmates but they put SESAME SEEDS all over it. If you have an allergy to them or diverticulitis, BEWARE!! They shouldn't do that. It should be an optional topping choice.*****I will not be reordering from here. I spent $14.93 for a small snack plus Postmates fees, delivery and tip $21. Awful. Awful awful. I CANNOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE. Save your hard earned money!!
2020-07-12,3,Had a spicy salmon poke bowl and vitamin sea smoothie. Everything was just blah. No taste. Waste of money. Not sure why the reviews are so high. Disappointed.
2020-07-03,5,Yessssss I got the bowl with shrimp in it. Was afraid they'd give me a couple but they definitely made it meaty.   I'm happy :)
2020-06-17,1,Face masks? As I watched a food-prep person come out from the back kitchen carrying a container of freshly chopped sushi for poke bowls without wearing a mask, I concluded that she probably also prepared my shrimp taco in the back kitchen without wearing a mask as well.  And if patrons are expected to wear masks when entering a food establishment, then patrons should expect their food be prepared by staff who also wear their masks, even when behind the scenes.  I will say the person prepping food in the front kitchen was wearing her mask, and I wished she prepared my tacos too.
2020-06-15,4,Great fast casual spot in downtown Hoboken. It's got a pretty cool vibe to it too if you decide to eat there. Poke bowls are really good. You can tell the fish is great quality. I usually go with the spicy salmon. The açaí bowls are also really good. For both bowls, you can select a pre-made bowl or make your own.
2020-03-15,2,Better açaí bowl places in Hoboken. Not that flavorful, stale granola, and mango wasn't ripe (it's not mango season so why have on menu). My husband got a smoothie he said was also not flavorful just icy. Typical Hoboken. Why do two totally separate concepts mediocre just pick one and do it right.
2020-03-14,5,I love this place. Nice Hawaian vibe to it.  Plenty of clean seating at the front. They have 2/4 top tables as well as long tables.  The staff here are really friendly. You can order at the counter or at 1of2 touch screen stations off to the side.   I usually get one of the açaí or pitaya bowls. I like to customize mine.  I love that they have two size options.  Also LOVE the banana chic chip protein balls. Massively.  Wish I knew the nutrition info for their items.
2020-03-02,5,Great poke bowl. Meal was very presentable, service was quick, and the customer service was very friendly. I'll definitely be ordering from here more often!
2020-01-29,1,I came to the  spot bc I was craving  a poke bowl. So I opened up this app to be lured in by the pictures....Ordered a large bowl. Pretty sure I paid about 17 with a Diet Coke. Food was all stale rice.. little fish. And a lot of sauce. Was pretty bad. Left me upset and def not satisfied. Food came out really quick. But quality was just trash.
2020-01-26,5,Best poke spot in hoboken! Unlimited toppings -- that's unheard of! They serve high quality ingredients, and it's so filling. Highly recommend
2019-11-14,2,Ordered the Spicy Salmon Bowl. The half avocado was literally rotten, brown rice was mushy (didn't realize you could mess up rice that bad), salmon was chewy and did not taste fresh. Overall I was surprised on how bad this bowl was & it was $15. Would never order again. Cannot speak on the fruit bowls or smoothies.
2019-10-29,2,Not the best poke bowl. Gave me a whole bunch of greens and barely fish. You're way better off at another poke spot. Not impressed.
2019-10-24,5,Shaka Bowl is by far the best poke bowl in Hoboken. They always have the freshest ingredients and they give generous portions. The norm in this type of place is 15$ and a skimpy bowl. Not at Shaka. I leave full every time and feel like I got my money's worth.
2019-09-28,4,Hangover smoothie with rolled oats banana bites are amazing. It's my post workout routine to go here on most of the days.
2019-09-27,5,Shaka Bowl is definitely a favorite for me on Washington Street in Hoboken! They have such a great variety of food options here. I can always go for one of their smoothies, the flavors are perfect combinations that always seem to hit the spot and the person is definitely large which is really nice. They have a pretty typical poke selection and it is also customizable as well as their açai section. I've noticed that they also have pastries made fresh. There is a lot of seating in this location and usually a small line but always worth the wait. They also have things like tacos and salads available. I recently tried a fall menu special salad and it was so good! I would recommend pretty much everything I have had on their menu so far and will always be going back to try more at this location!
2019-09-19,5,This is my go to poke bowl spot! I always get the tuna with spicy mayo and they have really good service too. Love this gem in downtown Hoboken.
2019-09-07,3,Well, they made this place sound like the best poke in Hoboken. Actually, I had the ah tuna and I have tasted better. Food was made to order, counter staff was nice and helpful and the decor was good but the food was plain. So just remember, there are a dozen more pokes and bowls on Washington st. Make this if they are full of people.
2019-08-28,5,I recently moved into the neighborhood and cannot get enough of Shaka Bowl's breakfast and lunch! The Acai & Poke bowls are both delicious and nutritious. Plus, do not forget about Taco Tuesdays! The staff, both Ida and Elizabeth, make the experience warm and welcoming. Plus put A LOT of love in the food!
2019-08-18,5,This is my new açaí bowl place / poke / coffee. Yes! All in one place. I love a good açaí bowl and I've tried them all in this area, this is the best one yet! The açaí isn't packed with sugar and they don't cheap you out and charge for every single additional topping. Their poke bowls are fresh and the cold brew is a hidden gem.
2019-08-13,4,Just moved to Hoboken and upon seeing this place I knew it was one of the first places I'd have to try! The atmosphere is really neat and resembles the Playa Bowls atmosphere. You can order at the front or they have easy to use kiosks in the restaurant as well. I customized my own poke bowl and boy was that tasty. Nice bite size pieces of fresh salmon, so many sauces to try and unlimited toppings! The large bowl did come out to $14 but it was truly delicious and made with care. I can't wait to try more bowls from this place. Definitely one of my new go to lunch spots.
2019-08-05,1,Really bad customer service. Maybe the young stuff need some training because the guy at the register couldn't answer any questions. I asked what bowl could you recommend? And his response was "Ummm I like fish". And then said I don't want to eat fish today and I don't eat meat, so I asked again what's a popular bowl here and he said " I like to add fish". It was frustrating to get any answers or recommendations. So I decided just to do the Pineapple of The Day bowl even though I didn't want fish. I then asked if I can Not do the crispy onions because I have an allergy and to do half of the rice and add seaweed salad. Food was Ok but they messed up my order. I received the bowl with an old brown avocado, a lot of rice and crispy onions. I couldn't finish the bowl and gave it back to one of the employees and I told him order was incorrect and he said sorry. He was nice but didn't know how to handle this kind of situation
2019-07-18,5,Great place for some vegan options....had the Toki Tacos made wth bbq pulled jackfruit...excellent with the Hawaiian ponzu sauce....and had to have the vegan cookies for desert
2019-06-19,4,The atmosphere is to die for, i just wanted to find excuses to be able to hang there all day.  I went to school in Hoboken and have been making yearly trips back to the area.  Last year I had a bowl from playa bowls which was good, but nothing compared to shaka bowls.  From the amazing wood tables and chandeliers to the delicious acai bowls this place is a hit.  Wishing it was around when I lived here!
2019-06-12,1,One star for the brown avacado you charged me extra for.  When we asked for a non brown one you said you cut them all in the morning and they get brown.  Seriously.  I can't make this up.  Food was just ok.
2019-06-05,5,Food is insanely good/fresh, store vibe is on point, and the staff is super sweet. What else can you ask for? I will absolutely be coming here more often.
2019-05-23,5,As you walk into the place it feels like every corner of the place was designed with love. The food is great! The people are great! Would def go back again!!!
2019-05-01,2,We are huge Shaka Bowl fans, but ordering delivery is not a great experience.. I've order Shaka Bowl delivery a quite few times and it seems that each time there is an issue. In my most recent experience, I placed an order that was estimated to arrive in 45-60 min. After I did not receive my food after an hour and a half, I called the Washington location and was informed that my "order has been sitting there" and that they needed to get in touch with the third party delivery service "to see when someone can get my order to me."There is a $4.99 delivery fee on top of tax, gratuity, etc. An order of a regular size poke bowl and tacos is over $40. It's quite pricey and I would expect for the food to be delivered on time without me having to call. As I sit here and write this review, it's been 2 hours since I ordered and still have not received the food.  I keep trying to give them the benefit of the doubt because I enjoy their food so much, but this will be the last time ordering from them.
2019-04-20,5,The place is really cool! Even though I'm not hungry, I came to try their food and eat in their atmosphere. So far so good  I'm trying "pineapple of the day"and I can suggest this bowl!
2019-04-09,5,LOVE SHAKA BOWLI just moved out of Hoboken to the Upper East Side and I'm so sad I can't bring them with me. I only started trying them towards the end of my time in Hoboken, and I'm so sad I waited. My favorite smoothie is the one with Cold Brew and coconut in it - always was a great pick me up when hungover. Acai bowls are great too!
2019-04-05,5,Have eaten at Shaka a few times and it is consistently good. They have the best poke bowls in Hoboken in my opinion and the jackfruit tacos are unreal. The staff is always friendly and the place is always super clean. Highly recommend!
2019-03-30,1,Placed an order for delivery. It arrived late and my "fried dumplings" were cold. My dish also tasted disgusting. Is this a dog food place? Legit question.
2019-03-20,5,I stopped by here today for a bowl.  Service was fast and friendly.  My bowl was delicious.  Will definitely be back.
2019-03-11,5,Highly recommend this place! Their smoothies are probably the best I've had. I always get the Hilo smoothie and add blueberries and it is just so yum!! Can't wait to try the rest of the menu items :)
2019-02-18,5,Very fresh and healthy, one of my favorite place in hoboken.  The bowls are super delicious and the staff very cool. Great job guys
2019-01-27,4,Been here twice and got the bowl both times! First time,  we got the tuna, and second time, chicken, we got everything except fresh onions... sooooo good! However didn't love their taco or the guac
2019-01-06,2,The jackfruit tacos are pretty good. The chili and the carrot soup are the worst tasting soups I've ever had.  We got this delivered and they forgot half of our order so overall not the best experience in service or food.
2018-12-29,4,I wasn't impressed by the poke bowls I had in the past at the Monroe St location. Passing by this morning on the Washington st location I figure let me give the breakfast bowl a try since it's only available in this location I must say Shaka Bowl you have redeem yourself to me. The bowl was amazing and delicious! Portion was huge definitely could split with someone or eat it for next meal. I will be back again for the breakfast bowl!
2018-12-15,5,Ordered from here through seamless. Originally the driver messed up my order, but called the restaurant and they issued a refund and sent a replacement. They were incredibly helpful. On top of that the food was delicious. We got a Detox Smoothie and Açaí bowl and they were both amazing. Highly recommend.
2018-12-01,5,Phenomenal poke. Great staff. Especially Kiersten. She cooler than a polar bear's toenails.
2018-12-01,5,Shaka Bowl is simply amazing. Just had it for my 3rd time and it is to die for. The ambience is hip, the staff friendly, and the co-owner is easy on the eyes.  All in all, great experience and highly recommend.
2018-11-18,5,Looooove Shaka bowl :) my new fave now!Mellow vibes but fun feeling being here, staffs are friendly & very kind and nice. I appreciate how they were careful about the food allergy, as I have some, they were making sure about the ingredients.All the food tasted fresh and tasty, snack size was pretty generous amount so I enjoyed eating healthy satisfying meal. Food came super quick as well :)
2018-11-13,5,What I love about shaka bowl is their new shrimp taco once you see it is mouthwatering you can't resist to try it! Was very delicious and leaves a great taste after every bite. Haven't tried the bowls but I'm sure is very delicious and soon will leave a reaview for them. Great manager love shaka and go get you some bowls!
2018-11-12,5,Great ambiance with a great staff, the manager was very helpful when i asked questions about the menu and the food was delicious (hats off to the chef). Definitely recommend the tacos ! One of my favorite spots in hoboken, won't hesitate to come back!
2018-11-07,2,I came here last week for the first time and was greeted by a helpful and friendly staff. I came here for a poke bowl fix since makai poke location had me limited on time. I ordered the biggest size they offered and picked salmon as a protein. Sadly, I wasn't a fan. The white rice was bland with no flavor. I asked for a spicy mayo as the sauce and was told it was the "house sauce" and I wasn't crazy about the flavor. It was a bummer because I really wanted to like this place. I noticed waiting on line many people ordering smoothies, they looked yummy. I'm interested to go back and give the smoothies a shot. No more poke bowls though.
2018-11-02,5,My teen daughter loves this place and urged me to try. I have ordered two days in a row it is so good. The ambiance is pretty cute, with a nice relaxing vibe. They offer a rewards program which is bonus. The shaka bowl options are mind-blowing. I'm looking forward to trying all of the various savory and sweet build-your-own bowl combinations I can possibly fathom. To date, I have tried the Pulled Pork with brown rice, red cabbage, scallions, jalapeno, avocado and sweet chili sauce; then the steak with brown rice, pickled onions, scallions (I know, I have gum so it's ok) red cabbage, jalapeno, avocado and sweet chili sauce. On both occassions I ordered the snack size as it is very filling. The ingredients are so fresh, and the fresh flavors burst in your mouth. Truly satisfying little snack bowls. I do wish the avocado was fresher, as both times I ordered the avocado was slightly turning brown (slight peeve.)  I do love this place and definitely recommend you try it.
2018-10-01,5,This place was my daily stop for healthy and flavorful food that will help me get this body cruise ready by December.I'd heard about Poke bowls, but I was never brave enough to try it on a very hungry day. Shaka Bowl allowed me to ease into it on Day 1 with a smoothie, tiki taco with Jackfruit. Then on Day 2 I got the nerve up to try the Poke Bowl (snack portion), and now I'm in love !They have multiple mix-ins so that you can get the right amount of spicy and flavor to suit your palette.I'm sold.
2018-09-27,5,The woman who work there are amazing and know me by first name. Thanks to them I have cut back on soda dramatically and increased my water consumption. I am happy to say I lost almost 7 lbs in a month and feel better.Thank you ladies
2018-09-25,3,I've been dying to try Shaka Bowl for a while now. So after a quick session at the gym in Hoboken I walked over.Like a few yelpers below I also had a less than friendly cashier. I had never been here before and I was trying to piece together what I wanted in my poke bowl as the girl stared at me with a less than patient look on her face. Even as I was telling her what I wanted her only question was, "is that it?"I ordered a poke bowl with brown rice, ahi tuna, avocado, edamame, and the spicy Shaka sauce. I also thought it was a little bland. However, I would definitely try again with some extra sauce and toppings. My suggestion is don't be shy with your toppings as there is a generous portion of brown rice. I also ordered a detox juice which was almost warm, but tasted good. I look forward to giving Shaka bowl another try.
2018-09-23,5,If you stalk my activity feed, you may have noticed that I'm at Shaka Bowl A LOT. Why? For the best açaí bowl in town, head to Shaka. For a fresh take on a fruit smoothie, run on down. Poke bowl, taco (new item), cookies -- you name it, that's the place to be.Seriously, for a reliably delicious meal, timely service, and a great atmosphere, go to Shaka Bowl. I've been visiting their Monroe St location since it first opened up shop, and waited eagerly until opening day for the Washington St location. Space + Atmosphere - beautifully decorated and spacious. They have definitely outgrown the confines of the Monroe location. Noticeable difference in staff presentation and friendliness when the owners are not present. Açaí/Pitaya Bowls - extremely fresh, love the base blend, seasonal fruits (in the fall you can snag granny apples or pomegranate seeds), and great presentation. Hands down the best in town. My one complaint is that they have separated toppings into regular and premium - a scoop of protein powder is $1 extra! Question: is this a plant based protein powder? I'll update when I find out. Poke Bowls - excellent options, if you're stuck reference their house specials! And for those who have been confused as in previous reviews - yes, it's room temperature! I think the serving sizes have been reduced since they first opened, so I have stopped ordering this particular meal item (want the same bang for my buck).Tacos - cue Janice's "oh my GAWD!" Hands down my favorite meal option from Shaka. As a pescatarian I've tried the shrimp and jackfruit taco. The portion sizes are huge - three overstuffed tacos for $13! Unique taco toppings you can't find anywhere else - pickled cabbage, pineapples, spicy Shaka sauce, etc. I look forward to future additions to rival nearby Surf Taco, like mahi mahi or salmon. Smoothies - amazing selections. Pssst: I've even replicated their recipes at home! Love the use of coconut oil and cold brew in some of their mashups. Huge serving. Throw in protein powder for a meal replacement. Inclusive Options - vegans rejoice! With jackfruit, vegan baked goodies, and more, you'll be sure to find something that floats your boat.Sustainability - probably what I'm most excited about! If you eat in house, they serve açaí and poke bowls in reusable coconut bowls! You can even buy your own set. PLEASE DO NOT THROW THEM OUT when you order - they're currently running low because people make this mistake. Tacos are served on aluminum trays. Take out options for tacos include cardboard containers, and brown paper bags. Hopefully they can move to replacing plastic utensils and containers (biodegradable options!) in the future. Really a forward looking Hoboken establishment. Bravo!Community Engagement - they have a nifty newsletter with deals like Margarita and Taco Tuesday in August. Make sure to sign up (they have a rewards program as well). If you stalk their Instagram feed, they cater at local events. In the middle of trying to bring their business to the Stevens campus. As I said, I'm a Shaka Bowl enthusiast. I've already secured the Duchess at Monroe. I'm coming for you at Washington St!
2018-09-06,1,I bought lunch here today. Got the larger size bowl. 1. The price was absurd 2. There was NO sauce on it- it was like eating plain fish 3. My zoodles were so watery i was eating a bowl of soup 4. Everything was bland (i was promised free furikake and sesame seeds but sadly there were non) 5. Overwhelming amount of zoodles and very little fish, while the zoodles were on the top and the fish were on the bottom (very hard to maneuver in these tiny little plastic tuber wares they call take away bowls) HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE
2018-09-01,1,The cashier was just not interested in helping me out to place the order...bad customer service !!The quantity of the food was so less...looked like a leftover take out than the actual food ordered. Such a rip off. Btw I ordered a bowl, what I got for $10 is a SUPER MINI BOWL ! Never going there again !
2018-08-30,4,While the consistency could sometimes be improved, the quality of ingredients, presentation and flavors that Shaka brings forward are better than any other competitor in Hoboken. Or in the tri state area - and I've visited every single one of them (I think, probably). Also had a positive conversation with the owner that leads me to believe they've got a great team in place and will likely grow beyond the Mile Square City. Unfortunately. Would like to keep the secret well insulated within our flood prone borders.
2018-08-17,4,The food here is tasty and very fresh.  The issues are with the day to day operations especially the people at the register.  I have been here many times and at times have not been given a receipt, paid cash and not received my rewards points, hit my 500 points and not automatically rewarded.  If you are going to have this type of system you need to train your workers better or just have a more efficient system.  There never seems to be a manager there either.  Other than that everything is perfect.
2018-08-15,4,I was iffy about ordering delivery from here since it is raw seafood but it was very quick and was pretty solid. The tuna bowl was fresh and delicious. The kicker was the fried onions on top. They add a much needed crunch. The acai bowl is one of the best I have had in hoboken. Loved the fruit and the flavor. The freshness was incredible and it even delivered decently well. It came a little melted but it still was awesome. That says a lot. The weird part is that the to-go boxes are plastic containers. It was kind of a cheap way to deliver but it did the job. Like Arnold says... I will be back!
2018-08-14,4,We ate here yesterday and neither bathroom has a surface big enough for changing a baby. :-( There is floor space but I wasn't desperate enough. The bathroom on the left has ample space to install a change table and that would be so awesome!We did a "build your own snack size bowl" for our older son and he seemed to like the food. We just have to remember to ask for no sesame seeds (and not choose cabbage). We'll keep coming back! Shaka Bowl always seems to have the nicest amount of space for our stroller and I want to try the custom bowl I've planned for next time!
2018-08-10,5,So I came here because my sister and I wanted something refreshing after going to the gym and it was pretty hot out. I looked up poke and acai bowls on yelp because she was craving poke and I was craving a bowl and we found this place on yelp (as it was Hot & New). We luckily found street parking nearby so we walked from there (parking is hard to find here so take anything you find haha or else pay a price for the parking garage). The place is big and the atmosphere was very "island-like". The staff was friendly and brought our food to our table. You get to custom make your food or choose one that was already pre-made. I made my own pitaya bowl and it was only $10 ($11.73 with tax) and my sister made her own poke bowl for the same amount. There was way more than we expected and I personally liked it a lot more than any other acai bowl place I have ever been to because it was worth my money (I could barely finish so I had to take it home with me haha). Definitely, recommend this place out! I just really love this neighborhood and all the food places nearby~!
2018-08-02,5,This is the only poké place in town to go. I've been to several Hawaiian islands, and the food at Shaka Bowl is comparable to better than much of what I've had in Hawaii. My go to is the pineapple a day bowl with half sticky white rice and half mixed greens which is fantastic. Today, I tried some of the new options (zucchini fries, avocado dumplings and tacos). Everything was great, but the pulled pork tacos by far stole the show. The pork was smoky and perfectly cooked. The toppings are great and you really feel like you're getting a full meal and rest value. Customer service is friendly and customer oriented, and the food is fresh with quality ingredients. I strongly recommend Shaka Bowl.
2018-08-02,1,Packed in a long container so you can't mix up the ingredients. Very little meat (and it's cooked but cold) and tastes rubbery, in fact I just took it all out because it's just bad - and they forgot to add the sauce....Doesn't taste great at all - especially for what it costs. I'm now basically eating a 13 dollar container of brown rice.
2018-07-27,4,Got a Acai bowl the day after biking all over and it was so refreshing and delicious. I got a special with strawberries, bananas, nutella and cacao nibs on top. I can't wait to try one of their poke bowl next.
2018-07-21,5,Best acai bowl I've had. The perfect proportion for everything. The acai was smooth and creamy not icy. Fruit was perfectly fresh and ripe. They cut the fruit the perfect size..  other places the fruit is too big. There is granola at the bottom.. nice touch. Cute bowls!!! Love it!
2018-07-21,4,Stopped by with a friend from LA, we liked our açaí bowls (small was the perfect size) and we felt although the base with a little too frozen/icy-- fruit was delicious! The granola was good but she preferred a chunkier granola, we did like that the bottom had some granola as well which was a nice touch. I also added Nutella, and it added a sweet touch! I would come back for sure- the location is also beautiful and really inviting !! Great addition to the other location on Monroe st.
2018-07-11,5,I've only had the Acai & Pitaya bowls here, so this review is limited to those two items.  I credit Shaka Bowl for getting me into the whole Acai craze, prior to Shaka Bowl, I've tried it elsewhere and never understood why people go crazy for it.  The first time I tried Shaka Bowl's Acai bowl (in the Monroe Street location), I thought it was freaking delicious and went to Trader Joe's to buy their frozen Acai packets.  Unfortunately, I realized that I can't replicate them at home...  Since then, I made excuses to stop by Shaka Bowl whenever we drive through Hoboken.  I was really happy to see that they opened up a new location on Washington St, which is a much more convenient location from JC.  I stopped in a few days ago and was happy to find that the Acai bowls here taste just as good as the original location.I have tried both Acai & Pitaya bowls here, even though I am partial to Pitaya bowl, I tend to switch back and forth depending on my mood that day.  Acai tends to be a bit lighter and tangier (in my opinion), while Pitaya is creamier (due to the addition of coconut milk).  Aside from the delicious base, another reason I love this place is the unlimited topping.  I like to mix and match base on the fruit combination.  I discovered my love for bee pollen thanks to this place and always add it to my bowl.  Chocolate chips are also a great addition, because how can you go wrong with chocolate.  I also love the combination of peanut butter and honey drizzle on top, I am a sucker for sweet and salty combos.  I feel like Acai bowls are almost as good as ice cream sundaes, but less calories (at least that's what I tell myself).  They are great treats for the summer and perfect snacks for when you are craving something sweet, but want to stay somewhat healthy.  I highly recommend this place, check it out, you won't regret it.
2018-07-08,5,Now the Hawaiian frenzy has arrived to the East Coast I'm very happy that Shaka bowl has arrived to the main strip in town right by City Hall and the Path station, I was delighted to be greeted by staff when I entered and they were very helpful  and you can even customize if you don't see anything on the menu, they take cash/credit, they also have gender neutral bathrooms and free WiFi. Very friendly for families with kids and one of the managers were very friendly asking how my meal was, which I feel shows excellent customer service and showed that they cared and would even take criticism/advise which you rarely see, they have plenty of staff, I definitely would go back. Highly recommend their bowls or their smoothies
2018-07-08,3,Interesting place, they have such a huge store and a lot space. But they didn't give us any instructions how to order poke bowl. No assistance from the cashier about ordering food, too. The menu on the board is so small that I can barely see the words. Too many restrictions to make your own poke bowl. I still don't get why they hide all the food in the back instead of displaying in the front and letting customer choose by what we saw. I would say they'll have hard time competing with makai poke. Not as much choices as makai poke and service is not as good as them. Just saying
2018-07-07,5,Shaka Bowl is such a refreshing surprise. Excellent foods. Clean whole ingredients. Beautifully prepared. Options for every palate. The decor is a delightful bonus. Well done and I would highly recommend.
2018-07-05,3,I came here for a large açaí bowl, but I haven't tried any of their other items. Pros:- great atmosphere- large space- outdoor seating- management is clearly present in the business- unlimited toppings (also a con)Places for improvement:- my large açaí was not proportional to their toppings. It seemed like i only paid for more açaí as opposed to more toppings. Maybe that's their system,  but I found it silly to have a huge bowl with minimal toppings- related to toppings, even though they're unlimited they give you a minor serving of them. I only asked for maybe 3 Expecting the whole top part of the bowl to be covered but that wasn't he case.- the açaí itself was kind of bland. Very icy. The ingredients are clean, but I prefer my açaí a bit more thick with some banana blended in. - the young lady that took my order starting gossiping w her coworker as I'm giving my order. What?! Anyway, I kindly waited until she gave me her attention again. Very strange considering I came on grand opening weekend. This is definitely a solid spot and am going to return for another bowl - maybe update my review. Hopefully they've gotten into a better groove after opening weekend bc there is plenty of competition in Hoboken!
2018-06-30,3,It's ok, but the poke doesn't compare to Makai and the Acai doesnt compare to Playa Bowls.  Read this review as being written by someone who regularly poke and acai hops around Hoboken and has really high expectation!  They just opened, so hopefully they will improve with time! Pros:Staff is really friendly! They bring your food to you. The interior is REALLY cute!They keep the space really clean. Cons:Acai isn't very flavorful - it tastes like shaved ice, but with a little tang (the consistency is like a shaved ice too). The strawberries and kiwi toppings didnt seem very fresh (the strawberries were watery and had almost a jam-like consistency and the kiwi was paper dry). Poke bowls seem like they are filled 90% rice/base and the toppings were not flavorful (I got all the toppings except the pickled ginger). I noticed a few customers going back because their bowls were missing toppings.This spot is really cute, but they have tough competition in the area.Edit: my typos
2018-06-30,5,I went here just a few days after they opened and the place is beautiful; a nice little oasis from the Washington street hustle. They're located so close to the path so it's a great place to stop by for dinner on your way home. The food was great. Everything is fresh and made to order but it is still quick so you're not waiting for longer than 5 minutes.My favorites were the avocado egg rolls and the original poke bowl. The nitro matcha is so good!!I highly recommend this place!
2018-06-28,5,Went last night with a friend. Shared the dumplings, avocado wontons, classic poke, jackfruit tacos and nitro green tea. The food was delicious, ingredients were fresh, staff was friendly and they did a really great job decorating the space. I'll definitely be back to visit anytime I'm in the Hoboken Area!
