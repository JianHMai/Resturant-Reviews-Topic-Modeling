2021-11-06,2,Good view. That's the draw. Brought my teenage daughter and her friends her. Food was above average. Service was sucky. Left our plates sitting in front of us. forever. Didn't come by except to take our orders.
2021-11-02,4,Really enjoyed an impromptu brunch at Blue Eyes. I have no idea why we haven't tried it before. I wasn't that hungry but wanted to sit down and enjoy the weather and needed an outdoor area because we were on a walk with the dog. They were very accommodating for our large pup in narrow outdoor area. We had mango nectar mimosas (they made it with less juice to make it less sweet for me) and shared the burrata. I had the pear and walnut salad and my husband has the shrimp linguine. Everything was good. The best part is the view. Will definitely be back for it.
2021-10-31,5,This place was to die for.We came here for a birthday dinner with my friends and her parents. It is right on the water and has one of the most amazing views to look at while you eat. The staff was so amazing and was so accommodating to us needed a reservation for a larger party. Jonathan was our waiter and was absolutely amazing. He took care of 9 of us with absolute ease. We all got different dishes and I will tag what they are in the photos. All of the food was super authentic and you can tell by looking at them that a lot of care went into preparation. The pizza is cooked in a brick over pizza and it was so beautiful.
2021-10-18,4,The food was decent but the view from outside is the main selling point. We ordered the penne vodka, margherita pizza, and Nutella pizza. The penne was my favorite part of the meal. The Nutella pizza definitely needed something extra to make it taste better (option of fruit or hazelnuts on top would've been good) - it was really just pizza dough with Nutella but it didn't mesh well enough. Overall, decent - I wouldn't mind coming back if we're looking for a place by the water but wouldn't rush back either.
2021-10-02,1,Beautiful views, horrible food. Caprese featured underripe tomatoes and flavorless mozzarella. Both of our pasta dishes were watery. The calamari and shrimp were were like rubber.  My fiancé and I took one bite of our entrees and decided to just call it and pick up pizza on our way home. Don't go here.
2021-09-27,3,A view that can't be beat! Average food (avoid the pizza). Disgusting bathrooms. Go for drinks and apps  and pray you don't have to pee!
2021-09-22,3,Ok pizza, ok view. Very crowded. Prompt service. Overpriced. Don't pick the "window " seat when seated inside. It's right next to the pathway that runs parallel to waterfront, so everyone gets to see you. Made me a little anxious while eating.
2021-09-21,5,Absolutely love this place! we came for the view, but the food was amazing and our waiter Jonathan was nothing short of personable and tentative. Cannot wait to come back!
2021-09-19,3,Meh. The location is nice - on the water, and we watched the sunset. But the food is pretty meh. The frittura was fine but not crispy in the way I think the best calamari should be. The pizzas were decent. The pasta was unflavored and watery. While the pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was pretty shameful. We got both the Bolognese and the octopus pasta. Both were watery, lacked salt, and flavor. The service was fine but not great. The host was friendly and charming. I'd say the price to quality is pretty off. If you're looking for location, it's lovely. But don't go for the food. If you do, just get pizza.
2021-09-19,2,Two stars instead of one because my husband and daughter have eaten here during the week several times and really enjoyed it. She wanted to come for her birthday, so we did. Their website states they do not take reservations. We came at a peak time on a Saturday, so I anticipated a wait. Well, we waited....while people with reservations got seated. A guy standing behind us said, "What the heck, I called and they told me they don't take reservations!"  A woman also standing there smugly said, "I always make reservations". Turns out she spoke Italian and knew the pizza guy in the back. Nice. Apparently one can also make reservations if one has a mammoth group. Which makes sense, but then why don't they say that on their website?At any rate, we eventually got a table. The food was fine, but took an eternity to get, and the entrees came out at vastly different times. Our appetizer was MIA until I asked where it was. The surly waitress said she wasn't the one who was supposed to bring our out food, as if she was doing us a favor by doing so. We practically had to beg for water, and when I ordered a martini, she snapped at me, "We only have beer and wine". There are ways of handling things, and she was a dumpster fire. The wait staff wasn't wearing masks, and our waitress had her hair down. Safety and customer service don't seem to be their thing. Not sure we will ever return.
2021-09-14,5,Easily the best dining experience we had during our stay. If not for time constraints we would have returned. As soon as we walked up, staff were right there. Not just one or two but 4 employees were right there to seat us. A fabulous table overlooking the water and walkway was where we requested to sit and a table was immediately sanitized. Our waiter was attentive and brought our drinks quickly along with taking our order. Great wine options and the sangria was dangerously good. We had the Granchio,  Tagliatelle al Ragu Bolognese and Spaghetti ai frutti di mare. Everything was perfect with homemade pasta and perfect sauce. Prices were reasonable but we would have paid more for just the view alone.
2021-09-12,1,Worst service I have ever rec'd.  Our waiter was Fabrizio.  He began by saying he was tied and wants to go home.  He was rude, loud, impatient and scared the ladies at our table.  I hope some people read this review and skip this dump.  Restaurant can contact me as sunilandpoonam@aol.com if they would like additional info.
2021-09-11,2,Came here with the family on Saturday night. Knowing they would be busy we sat relatively fast. We sat at a nice table semi outside. The music was playing a little louder than I liked but no big deal.  The waiter came over and told us they were out of bread. It was 8;40 at night so I understood that.  He also mentioned that it would take about 40 minutes if we ordered the personal pizza. I appreciated the heads up.  We ordered an appetizer the Beratta came out quickly.  However we waited for our food do over an hour.  The waiter came over multiple times to apologize for the wait, but that didn't help the fact we were starving.  Food finally came out. All the food was very good. My son got the steak with garlic and seasoning it was good but not for $33!  We got another round of sodas and than the check. He took my card and I had to search the restaurant for him because he had it for 15 min. Ugh!!!!! I just wanted to get out of there.  My check was 168.00 they charged me for every soda we had. I just feel since we were waiting so long for food the 12 cent sodas could have been free instead of $3 a piece.  Again waiter was nice but it took WAY TO LONG FOR THE FOOD - don't think I would go back.
2021-09-11,4,Yummy Italian food right by the waterfront- you get great views of nyc and the water while enjoying a nice meal. The only downside is that since everyone seated outside wants to be close to the water, all of the tables are fairly close together.
2021-09-02,3,Food is alright, but expensive for what it is. If you're ok with that, then the atmosphere and view is great.
2021-08-27,5,Their grilled octopus with arugula salad on the side was phenomenal. I am glad I had it. It definitely satisfied my cravings for octopus. It was super soft and perfectly charred which gave the dish so much flavor! Would order again.
2021-08-17,4,Came back for an impromptu dinner on a Sunday niggt and had a much better experience as we were seated inside. There was a lot more room between the tables and less customers seated inside making for an overall much more comfortable setting to enjoy our meal. If you go for the view then I recommend going when there's still daylight, though the "outside" seating is enclosed.l and not truly outdoors. Service was great and food was delicious - had the seafood pasta which they made spicy upon request.
2021-08-15,3,The waitress was super unfriendly.  She spoke abruptly and rudely when ordered our drinks.  When I asked for an extra glass, she again had attitude get the glass.  When we ask for a wine menu she checked to see if our menu had a copy in the back.  Of course the wine list was missing.Never came over to ask if our food is okay.  But she asks our next table politely how their food is.  The fish is dry like pork chop well done.
2021-08-15,1,This restaurant features nice waterfront views...and that's literally the only positive thing I can say about it. Aside from its location, there is nothing good to say about this restaurant. Between the abhorrent service and the nearly inedible and flavorless food and watery drinks, this is not somewhere I would recommend to ANYONE. It was a painful experience from start to finish. We had two aperol spritz that were very watery along with the "special fresh mozzarella and tomato salad" and calamari and shrimp that literally had the consistency of rubber. On top of that, we watched as the owner berated a bus boy repeatedly in front of customers. STAY AWAY!
2021-08-15,5,We keep coming back here with our family this summer! It's the perfect place to impress with a view of sailboats skimming the NYC skyline AND grab an Aperol Spritz.I absolutely love the pizzas here (they're medium sized, thin crust, amazinggg sauce from Italian tomatoes) but the salads and pastas are great as well. Blue Eyes reminds me of hanging out at a cafe restaurant on the Amalfi coast. We always get a warm welcome, the owner is lovely, and can't wait to go back soon!
2021-08-07,3,Food is okay but you get a nice view of the city. We got everything they recommended and it was just okay. It was terrible but I definitely wouldn't be going back for the food.
2021-08-01,1,We had a blonde waitress with lots of makeup who didn't seem interested to be there. The food was beautiful and the view was great but the waitress ruined our whole experience. We asked for a cold glass for ice for my beer and she said the dish washer wasn't ready lol she also told us we couldn't make any accommodations to the sauce being on our food meanwhile she could have just put the sauce on the side.
2021-07-25,2,Not Exactly a "blue eyes" atmosphere- the food was mediocre at best. If you're looking for a romantic atmosphere by the name look elsewhere. It was so loud my date and I could barley talk over the loud music. The best part about this place is the view.
2021-07-21,5,Nice italian place with an amazing view. The food is delicious and who wouldn't love eating a nice meal with the New York skyline as your view.
2021-07-20,3,My friend and I went to Blue Eyes for dinner this past Thursday - we wanted to hear the Beatles cover band that was playing that night as a part of the free Hoboken concert series so we got there a little after 6:30 pm to make sure we could get a table outside.  We had no issues securing a table for two in their uncovered outdoor patio area;  it seems like there were open tables throughout the musical performance so no need to get there too early.  There were a lot of servers working the outdoor area and they were all very friendly.  They immediately brought out complimentary bread with a bruschetta like sauce that was tasty.  We decided to share a red & a white pie  - a standard margherita and the Tartufata which had truffle oil, prosciutto, and mushrooms.  The pizzas were average;  I enjoyed the white pie more.  While the margherita was good, I wish the dough was more crispy.   I liked that the servers didn't rush us to order or to leave.   It seems like you might need to specifically ask for/order the 'Pizza Pala' deal which is any two pies for $35 since they didn't ring up our bill that way even though we ordered two pies.  It was only a $1 difference so we just left it as is.  I don't know that I will be rushing back to eat at Blues Eye again, but it was perfect for us since we wanted drinks & a bite while we listened to the free concert.
2021-07-11,3,Went here for my friend's birthday last night and it was a good time! The food I ordered was okay, I got the MEZZELUNE DI SPINACI E RICOTTA. The Nutella Pizza we got for dessert was actually really good! The drink menu is limited despite having a bar at the restaurant. I got the Blue Eyes cocktail which was good. The servers were nice and they were able to accommodate a 10 person party last minute since they don't take reservations. The view was also nice.
2021-06-17,2,A mouthwatering meal and a fabulous view of the water is the best dinner combo in the world- don't you think? Located on Sinatra Dr. in Hoboken, NJ, the view of the Hudson River is everything- plus these folks have a faithful following. Coming here was wrong on sooooo many levels- but my sister gave my nephew the upper hand in selecting the restaurant of his choice for his celebratory graduation dinner.Long drive aside, I was hoping Blue Eyes at least look the part of a splendid "waterfront restaurant". Nope. Service? Not even. Except from my girl Andrea who took care of us for 2+ dragging hours. Between our Veganized Arugula Salad, Burrata and the seasony Calamari & Shrimp Frittura, the first two, were fire. Our dinner options included a mushy and tasteless Eggplant Parm, Sautéed vegetables that could've easily been sautéed together- but instead were plated individually, a weak chicken Parm, a Neapolitan Margherita Pie with a nice looking crust and another for my mom with "prosciutto"- that turned out to be pepperoni.  ̄\_(ツ)_/ ̄. Point goes for their simple, non-seasony tomato sauce. Andrea held her head high up and didn't lose focus. However, the other servers were sloppy when one of them cleared our table and dropped tomato sauce on the floor then took forever to clean up his mess. But Andrea comes to the rescue (not that she had to, because it wasn't her mess) to clear it- with a cloth table napkin at that. I love good Italian food and this doesn't come anywhere close. I also know this isn't the kind of Italian 'comfort' food Nonna used to make.
2021-06-16,2,I will preface this saying we didn't come for dinner and it likely affected the whole experience.. but that's why I'm giving it a 2 rating versus a 1.When we came in the host (owner?) was super friendly! It was later in the evening, and we had already had dinner at a different restaurant. We wanted desserts, some nice drinks, and the view!We were very quickly shown our table and given menus. The server was friendly until I mentioned we would likely just be getting drinks and desserts. He frowned and took away our silverware and proceeded to ignore us for a good half hour! Honest to goodness he spent that 30 mins talking about Italy and his daughter to the table behind us! He never glanced our way or he would have noticed I was trying to order. A bit peeved, I decided no wine. Just desserts and cappuccinos.  Surely that would be an acceptable order right? He came out with our desserts relatively quickly after we ordered them... but no drinks. We weren't even served tap water. We were given no napkins since he took them. And the cutlery? Spoons that were meant for tea/coffee. After 10 mins I ask about the drinks. He says they are coming. My husband finishes his dessert. Still no cappuccinos. We wait another 20 mins (now at the restaurant for an hour) until the cappuccinos FINALLY arrive. I had waited for a beverage before eating my dessert fully and the chocolate lava cake I ordered was definitely cold. The server was unapologetic.  He never came back to check on us and I had to ask a different server for some water. This was a horrible experience! I would have a left a really nice tip knowing I was taking up a server's time with just desserts and drinks... but this was abominable behavior on his part. Shame on this server for only looking at how much he could earn!!
2021-06-01,4,The service was excellent!!!  The food is very good but eggplant without pasta???!!!  They do a great job and have a great location.
2021-05-30,4,The great: -The views! If  you are sitting outside (the only place I've only sat) you will feel like you are right on the water. Yes, it's the Hudson, but who cares? You are getting the most perfect view of the NYC skyline.-I can't recall if they've always had such a big beautiful outdoor dining section or if that is just this past year and a result of Covid, but I am here for it. -The pizza. Thin crust and delicious! I've tried the prosciutto & funghi and the ortolano because I am a sucker for all things mushroom and both were great. I loved the broccoli rabe and roasted pepper on the Ortolana so I may call that one my favorite. The not so great: -The pasta was really not great. I thought the sauce tasted canned. -The cocktails. I had a few when they were doing their to-go stand early in the pandemic and have tried their sangria when dining in. I thought it tasted pretty watered down. What I recommend, go for the great views and the good pizza! Get a glass of wine with it and you will be oh so happy.
2021-05-23,3,I have never written a bad restaurant review but this was an unusual experience.  We arrived early for dinner- the restaurant was nearly empty. We got our drinks and appetizer and ordered entrees.  The place filled up and all the diners who came after us were served but our server never returned. After waiting 45 minutes we spoke to the manager who verified we had waited that long and told us "this isn't a fast food restaurant". We waited and additional 15 minutes before our food arrived.  When we left I told the manager I understood that mistakes happen- no big deal - clearly they lost our order and put it in when we called it to their attention. But I would have appreciated if not an apology, at least an acknowledgement that an hour was an unreasonable length of time to wait.  He said "you got you food didn't you"?  I have been dining out for decades and have never been spoken to so rudely by anyone at a restaurant, much less a manager.  It was appalling.The food was okay, our server was fine and the view is lovely.  But I won't be returning after that experience.
2021-05-16,1,Good location and great view. But very bad service. The waitress not familiar with the menu. And basically not provide any service. Would not come again.
2021-05-15,5,I gave them 5 stars because I couldn't think of one negative thing. We had 2 appetizers burratta and a antipasto of fried calamari, shrimp and fried zucchini. Delicious! We also ordered a brick oven pizza with truffles and linguine with octopus. Also amazing and to top it off the service and  waiter was great! I wish I would of asked his name. He was top notch and very attentive even though it was crowded. Great place, great food and great scenery as it is right on the waterfront. I highly recommend!
2021-05-02,5,I love this place... the location is amazing and the restaurants ambiance is so intimate which makes it perfect for a date night. I have been here for birthdays and date nights and I've never been disappointed. I've also never had bad service here... and never a bad meal.
2021-05-02,5,The perfect spot for a quick bite or a whole meal And it comes with a beautiful view of the hudson river and New York.
2021-04-24,5,So delighted to re-discover this Gem!! You are family with Alessandro, Rafael, Adelvino & Steffany. What a great time, experience & must the truffle buffalo brick oven pizza!!!
2021-04-16,3,Kudos to Blue Eyes Restaurant for being the only restaurant in north Jersey that was available for a 13 people reservation with such short notice! I've never been here before and I was a bit hesitant because of the reviews but my family and I decided to give this place a try.We visited on a Saturday night around 7:45pm. Parking in the area? It's Hoboken haha! I was lucky to snag a spot right in the front of the restaurant. Even though it was metered parking I only had to pay for the spot until 9pm (free parking after 9) It was as easy as downloading the parking app to pay.Blue Eyes is overlooking the NYC skyline which is absolutely beautiful. If you visit during the hotter months you can sit outside and enjoy the weather. We sat in the back of the restaurant with a view of NYC. Since we were a big party we were divided up between two tables right next to each other which is fine since the parents sat at one table and the young adults sat at another.Our waiter was super nice! He greeted himself and even shared some laughs with the table. He did warn us in the beginning that the kitchen was very busy and food may take longer than normal. He also stated the only food item that was coming out quick was the pizza because they had a brick oven. I started off with a strawberry and prosecco drink which was pretty good. The tables were brought complimentary warm bread and oil and the choice of bottled or tap water. We then started to order appetizers in which some apps came out and some did not. My cousins and I ordered Caesar salads, calamari and burrata in which only the calamari came out. The calamari also came with fried shrimp and sauce; it tasted fresh and I would definitely recommend it as an app! For entrees, 3 out of 4 of us ordered penne vodka; my sister ordered the white pie. The penne vodka was decent but i've honestly had better. After we finished our entrees we still did not receive the Caesar salads, burrata and the white pie. When we informed the waiter, one Caesar salad came out (when we ordered two) and the burrata. The burrata was good but I was bummed that it only came with two small breads with bruchetta on top. Again, we asked for the Caesar and pizza and it finally came out. My sister was a bit annoyed as the waiter stated pizzas were moving the quickest. We could definitely tell that orders were forgotten. Also, trying to stop the waiter to get water refills was a project in itself!And that bathroom? It was craziness! There is only one little bathroom stall. If the restaurant is busy be prepared for a wait. The bathroom is located right next to the kitchen so it can get hectic waiting in line.My family and I didn't get out of the restaurant until 10:30pm. Almost 3 hours! Yes, we were understanding of the kitchen being busy but us sitting there for that long made us tired for sure.I would give this spot another try when it's not so busy!
2021-04-07,2,My friend found a hair in her food, the pasta was undercooked, and my steak was grey and tasted like perfume. Would not go back
2021-04-06,1,Start to finish our experience this afternoon was rather unfortunate. The view is beautiful, but the food, wine, and service left much to be desired.The entire restaurant had about four tables when I arrived, and my partner, who arrived a while before me, told me he was greeted very rudely, and then waited upwards of 15 minutes for water; and then longer for a carafe of wine, which tasted like it came from a box, (the label was not listed on the menu or offered by the waiter). After I arrived, and we tried to order, we were informed the chef had not arrived and pizza would be unavailable, (which is odd for a place that advertises it so heavily, but we at least would have liked to know as we sat down, and not upon trying to order). But we started with an appetiser and tried to wait. I'm glad we did start with something else, as the appetiser alone was underwhelming, and overpriced. We decided that was enough for our experience of blue eyes. I'd stick with Halifax if you're looking for somewhere nice with a view. This was supremely underwhelming.
2021-04-02,4,Great service at Blue Eyes! I ordered the penne vodka and it was very good. I would recommend adding the homemade chili oil they have available, it really makes this dish stand out. The location is beautiful, right on the Hoboken Waterfront with NYC views!
2021-03-20,4,A nice little restaurant by the water in Hoboken with some good views. The food was good and the service was amazing and food came out very quick. The deserts were amazing. The portions were a little small especially for the price but overall it was a good eat
2021-03-17,1,Horrible service and rude.  Order food took over 2 hours and came out wrong.   Not accommodating !!
2021-02-23,5,First time there tonight. Walked by this place many times and finally walked inside. Very good food! Beginning with the bread and oil (I don't remember last time I enjoyed such bread), moving on to the pizza (executed perfectly) and ending with the Nutella/Cannoli pizza, everything was delicious. Service was great too. Very attentive. Will definitely be back. Thank you guys!
2021-02-16,3,We went for Valentine's Day dinner at 6pm. The place is beautiful and the atmosphere was great. The menu was a strict menu due to the immense demand during Valentine's (which I totally understand) My girlfriend ordered the Heart Shaped Lobster Ravioli's that came with Lobster sauce, she requested vodka sauce instead so it wasn't so much lobster, the waiter first gave her a hard time and I asked if he could please see if it was possible, since the vodka sauce was already on the menu. He complied and so far the evening was great. When the food was brought out My cheese ravioli's were heart shaped, but her lobster ravioli's were not. I asked the waiter what happened since this was a special menu. He told us he was hoping no one would notice, but they didn't have any heart shaped lobster ravioli's. I said, but it said on the menu, if you knew, why didn't you just let us know? That is minor and the food was very good! We ordered a decaf Espresso and a regular coffee and a grandmother piece of pie that had pine nuts and custard. Looked delicious on the menu. The waiter told us they ran out of that. It was early in the evening, how could they run out of that already? ok, no problem, we just would have coffee. The coffees came out and they were both ice cold! How is that possible? we told the waiter and he said he would take it off the bill, no apologies or any remorse to find out what happened. Maybe it was the pressure of the day, but the service was lacking. only one waiter, Jonathan, stood out at the beginning, We wish we had him as our waiter.
2021-02-08,1,I ordered delivery from this place last night. I got clams oreganata as an appetizer. I ate one and immediately threw the rest out. They were soggy, disgusting and not fresh at all. I opened up my chicken parmagiana and the first thing I noticed was how terrible the sauce looked. Looked like a campbells tomato soup but less red. It tasted very bad. The chicken was tough, tasted like they just thawed it before I ordered it. My girlfriend was sick the next morning from her dish. Over half of our $80 order ended up in the trash. I tried calling twice today asking for the manager but he was "in a meeting upstairs". I can't believe this place has such great reviews, they probably paid for them or something, oh well!
2021-01-31,3,The Mr. and I were able to get away for the weekend and decided to hit up NJ for the opportunity to dine indoors. While searching tons of reviews, I came across Blue Eyes which was within walking distance of the W Hoboken. I'm not gonna lie, the reviews scared me a bit but sometimes it's worth the gamble and Blue Eyes was better than expected.The restaurant staff were pleasant and accommodating as were originally seated in the enclosed area with great views of the NYC skyline. However, my toes were freezing so I asked to move indoors and luckily a table was available. I mean, why suffer the cold in NJ when I could've stayed in Manhattan and ate with my coat on? Anywho, we proceeded to order the Margherita pizza (with burrata) for starters, branzino for him and salmon for me. I must admit, the pizza was one of the best we've had and easily rivals any of the historic joints in NYC/BK/Bronx. The salmon was prepared a bit longer than my prefrence and the mustard sauce that supposedly accompanied it was more creamy than mustard-y. It was also too large of of a portion and could've easily been 1/2 the size. I felt terrible throwing it away but I wasn't taking it back to our room. His branzino, was cooked perfectly but would've benefited from a lemon sauce of some sort as he kept stealing mybsauve. Nevertheles, he still demolished his meal and unlike me, left nothing behind so I guess he was happy. The place got pretty packed around 8p before we left and we had to hunt someone down to bring our check and then to pay our bill. Overall, we enjoyed our meal but would likely stick to pizza or try one of their pasta dishes should we ever come again.
2021-01-30,5,We love Blue Eyes! Great Italian food and nice atmosphere with a great view! Highly recommend!
2021-01-06,4,I was excited to go here because I had heard great things and I'm a huge Frank Sinatra fan. Was a bit bummed the place wasn't very clean and they were playing club music instead of Frank Sinatra. Food was good but wouldn't go back.
2021-01-02,5,The food was delightful. I ordered lobster ravioli and black pasta. It didn't disappoint me. And Jonathan was amenable. Strongly recommend!
2020-12-31,3,Today was my second time here. The food is very good , we had calamari which was tasty, and the drinks are fine, but my boyfriend ordered the special and the portion was very small. As a former server I know specials are often smaller portion sizes than regular entrees, but this place is not super cheap and to leave hungry isn't right. My entree was very good, but I'm still a bit disappointed about my boyfriends - he ordered the lobster ravioli and only got 5, and trust me they weren't big. Luckily I didn't mind sharing my dish with him but if I hadn't he would have been hungry.
2020-12-31,5,Service is awesome, food is delicious, prices are reasonable, restaurant is clean and the view is great. Overall it's excellent! We will definitely go back.
2020-12-24,4,This is my go to neighborhood pizza place! I stop by many a night for some red wine and savory authentic Napolitano style pizza. Always the perfect crunchy crust and good thickness! It's hard to eat more than 2 slices so best to go with a friend or two! It has an old school vibe and stunning location with very friendly staff. Bon apetit!
2020-11-24,1,What can I say .. I expected this place to be better dinning. The place is ok and the waiters rush you to order. I ordered a calzone, you can't mess that up !!! I was wrong. The wine was just ok.  I would definitely pass this place up.
2020-11-21,5,The food was unbelievably delicious and the service was on point! Food had so much flavor to it! My mouth was in heaven haha. Definitely coming back to this establishment!
2020-11-19,5,Got the pizza special with prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, eggplant, and burrata cheese on top. 10/10 it was delicious
2020-11-07,2,Food is mediocre, nothing really special. View is good, our waiter was a nice guy, but all that can't help if you have to wait for 3 appetizers for 1 h+ plus (clams were not fresh by the way, and prosciutto was dry and old), and then one more 1 for 1 pasta dish... we left without even getting it at the end. would never spoil my afternoon like that again...
2020-10-29,4,Been here twice in the past couple weeks and I really enjoyed the food here, the chicken parmigiana is the bomb, as well as the bread they give you is a nice addition.
2020-10-28,5,I wish I had more stars to give!!!! Excellent authentic Italian food!!! I took my wife here for our 20th wedding anniversary and had a wonderful experience. So far I've been here twice and look forward in going again.!!!!
2020-09-23,3,Last night, We came in first & got sat down right away. We were waiting for a server to come give us our water but we saw that they completely ignored us & they served the other two people that came in after us & served them right away. We even saw them server other people who came in right away....... We were waiting about 7-10 minutes for our waiter to come to us & for them to notice us. Make sure you guys ask for clean cups b/c ours had stains & looked dirty. Our waiter wasn't very friendly at all. He was friendly with others which was weird kus my bf was trying to talk to him & all the waiter did was just ignored him. Why couldn't the waiter be friendly & social with us ? Anyways ,We got the blue eyes drink. A pesto pasta & Opanuozzo. It was really good!!! The view was amazing . (MAYBE next time we will get treated right)
2020-09-19,4,Really loved this place. Was great to experience this type of New Jersey town. Great outdoor patio with beyond beautiful views. The food was great!!!!
2020-09-17,4,Went here for a quick lunch with a friend. Perfect hoboken spot! Great location, great view, great food. No wait even on a saturday afternoon. Pizza was AMAZING!! You could tell our waiter was a true italian, accent and all. Treated us with a generous amount of kindness. Would definitely come again!!
2020-09-16,4,What i tried -  Nutella pizza: you can't go wrong with this one. This was delicious and the base was cooked well  ricotta spinach ravioli : this was good but not the most extraordinary dish I've had ‍ tiramisu: I was so happy to finally satisfy my craving after a week. Views are pretty
2020-09-08,3,I went to Blue Eyes for dinner with 6 of my friends this past weekend and although the food was tasty, the service was not great. It took a while to get our first round of drinks and then the apps came out at different times with us wondering if the second one was ever put in the system. We didn't get our entrees until almost 2 1/2 hours after we sat down. Again, the food was great but I just wish the service was on the same level. There were barely even checks ins from our server with updates or apologies.
2020-09-06,4,Went here as an anniversary dinner. The waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. We did see other tables speaking down to the staff which was not a good feeling. We ordered Margarita pizza, penne vodka, ceasar salad,  and two different house wines. Finished everything on all the plates. A lot of fish options.
2020-08-24,5,Excellent service ! Great meal  They don't carry hard liquor however they do have wine and beer.  Char octopus with lemon wash very fresh and tender now chew or over cooked  Pizza was great as well , , but mostly one goes for the great view and then after your meal a great walk -
2020-08-24,4,This place is great! Has a nice view of the city so doing outdoor dining is something I recommend. The food is delicious and fresh. I had the bolognese as my entre and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The calamari and bruschetta was amazing as well. Service is great, the waiters are attentive and will satisfy all needs. I recommend giving this spot a try whether it be for a quick lunch or a nice dinner date option. Parking however may be tricky but then again, finding parking in Hoboken is always a hassle.
2020-08-16,3,This is an ok spot with a great location.  I had the bolognese which was good, but the wine list was severely anemic.
2020-08-15,5,I went for a walk in Hoboken today and stopped in at blue eyes. I have been here a few times pizza was amazing as always! Great job staff. Be safe and be back soon
2020-08-11,5,This is my new favorite restaurant! The food is delish -  I've tried quite a few dishes and have really enjoyed them all. My favorite is the truffle mushroom pizza. Also love the Orelana pizza.The views are incredible - best spot in Hoboken.Service is great - very friendly staff.Prices are more than fair for quality of food and location.I take all my Hoboken visitors here. Everyone has enjoyed their meals here.
2020-08-08,3,Visited on 8/6/20Clean environmentStaff had masks on/ seating compliant w social distancing Beautiful view of NYC regardless of where you sitAbsolutely delicious sangria! Calamari deserves bragging rights! If you go, GET THE CALAMARIOutside of that, we waited 20-25 minutes before anyone even came around to take a drink order. We had to flag someone down and it really wasn't that busy. I wasn't impressed with the swordfish- it was very bland to me.
2020-08-01,2,Second time here. Warm beers, 45 minutes for apps, rude server. Real shame...I really wanted to like this place because the food was pretty good. May give it a third try, but really disappointed right now.
2020-07-25,4,Spent a day walking around Hoboken, but be careful unless your patronizing a restaraunt, there are no restrooms.  Towards the end of day, I found Blue Eyes on Sinatra Dr. (Go figure).  It is right on the Hudson River with great views of New York.  There is a nice breeze coming off the river and a large walkway filled with joggers.  There is plenty to look at.  Had a nice glass of wine and the Papparadelle with Ragu Bolognese.  The pasta was done al-dente and the sauce was delicious.  The portion was big enough for $19.  Finished up with a Nutella Cappuccino which was excellent.  I want to go back during evening hours because of the old lanterns on the walkway and thier hanging exterior lights.  I'm sure it will be beautiful.  4 glasses of wine, one entree and one Cappuccino $57.  All in all very nice place great location.
2020-07-19,4,This nicely located restaurant has a great view of the river. The food is acceptable and it depends on what you order. I had the spinach ravioli and it was very good. I didn't have the pizza but the pizzas look very good at other peoples tables. I had their freshly made cannoli and it was scrumptious.
2020-07-02,1,I wouldn't even give this restaurant one star. Do they not know what corona is???Our waiter had this mask on at first and then after initially asking our drink order didn't have it on again. All the employees are clearly visible inside the restaurant not wearing masks. ALSO I ordered a pizza after watching him make it I realize he not only doesn't have a mask on but doesn't have gloves on! If you are scared of corona do NOT come here.
2020-06-28,3,This is definitely a cute dinner with a Hudson River view. The waiters are very nice. No complaints with them but food was just ok. I had the a pasta dish with shrimp in white wine sauce which was just ok. Lacked in flavor but edible. The drinks were very watered down. Although friends had different pasta dishes and fried calamari and they said it was better. But I asked the manager or seating manager not sure what his title is exactly a simple question since two friends in our party were still waiting to be seated even though there was an empty table for two near us. My friends were fine sitting away from our table. He could have answered in a friendly professional host tone something like "no I'm so sorry that other table is reserved but let me see what I can do about it" even if it wasn't true I would of appreciated the friendly respectful answer. Instead he had this rude tone and brushed me off, his first words were "what?" With this fed up tone and literally walked away from me and left me standing. So rude. Unfortunately thats what I'm going to remember this restaurant for. I hear their pizza is better maybe I'll try again but will think twice before coming back, customer service is a deal breaker for me when I choose where to eat.
2020-03-16,3,Attended (on 2/23) Blue Eyes Restaurant with my husband after a great basketball win with my son's team.  Knew I wanted something by the water overlooking the NY skyline.   I had been in the area at another restaurant so I decided to try something new.As always it's an issue finding a park in Hoboken, however, if you have a great experience (which we always do) it's worth it   We didn't realized until  the end of the basketball season, it would be cheaper to take a Uber (from Saint Peter's U) versus parking.   Oh well.When we arrived, the restaurant was not crowded and our waiter Micheal sat us by the window. The location is perfect during the day since it sits on a walking path and excellent at night for the beautiful view. I ordered a glass of wine.  The guys ordered apps:  Scallops and Calamari.  Both were ok.  Our entree's were a different story, my Linguine w/clams lacked seasoning.  The guy's penne with shrimp was just ok.  On the flip side, I hear their brick oven pizza is awesome.  If we come back, we'll stick with the pizza and the beautiful view.
2020-02-22,4,Nice spot right by the water in Hoboken. I came with a big group of friends and was happy they accommodated us in such short notice. We had some cocktails and small bites. Service was good. Food was good. Drinks were good. The location was good. I would come back and recommend to others.
2020-01-20,5,Delicious food and amazing view. Their gluten free pizza was also a soft and fluffy crust! I'd highly recommend and definitely intend on returning!
2019-12-08,3,Went there on a Saturday night in September. Moderately busy. Got sat outside with the chairs facing NYC which is a nice touch. Got our menus but waited 15 min for the next human to even ask if we wanted drinks. When the waitress eventually realized we were just sitting with closed menus her tone was as if we did something wrong that we didn't order yet while other people were being served. I got a filet which was great, great sauce and great temp but my GF got a sirloin that tasted no better than a home cooked steak smothered with rosemary. We waited another 15 min for someone to take our plates. I would rate this 4/5 because the view is one of the best waterfront views I've ever been to even though the service was meh
2019-11-07,5,Original Artisanal Pizza Napoletana made by a Real Napoletano.Excellent Food Menu with a Palermo Twist.Can't get better.Love this Joint.The view of Skyline it's Amazing.Friendly Stuff.Perfect for a date.Must Try.
2019-11-03,5,this place iz da bomb! like 4 realz..... best food in da world!
2019-10-16,4,Solid place for lunch.  I had the penne vodka.  The wait wasn't long and the place was pretty empty.  You get views of the Hudson River.  Pricing isn't that expensive.  There's a wood fire oven and most of the people working here speak Italian.  My only complaint is the space is a little small.  It looks much larger than it is and there's a wait on the weekends.  There is also very little room at the bar, and it's almost impossible to get in on the weekends unless you have a reservation or are willing to wait.Overall a good place.  Cozy environment.  Decent food, although I have had higher quality Italian.  I did notice the pasta wasn't buttery and fresh.  It didn't taste like it was really made from scratch.  Ambience and aesthetics are pleasant, food wasn't amazing.
2019-09-24,4,This was my first time coming to this restaurant although I've passed by many times before. The wine list was pretty good and the restaurant is perfect for the view of NYC, however everyone in my group agreed that the pasta was just okay. After ordering our food we had to wait a little over half an hour for the food to come out which sucked because we were all so hungry. My friend ordered the lobster ravioli but didn't enjoy it at all and had to send it back. The waiter was understanding and pleasant so she ordered the Tagliatelle al Ragu Bolognese instead which she preferred. After looking at the reviews if I was to go back, I would just order the pizza because it actually looked amazing.
2019-09-20,5,What a great first experience . Food was authentic . Pizza  tastes like you're in Italy . Ambiance is stunning back drop is the NYC skyline  . Loved  it from start to finish ....
2019-09-09,4,The food (caesar salad and spinach ravioli) and view was nice however the tiny one man show of a bathroom was filled with a ton of flies. It was very uncomfortable and unsanitary. Management MUST work on that bathroom and make sure there are no flies because it really was disgusting.
2019-08-30,5,My home away from home - I bring EVERYONE here for the view, food, wine...It's just all around an old school Italian place just like it should be.
2019-08-28,3,Gnocchi was alright, I generally like them bigger and fluffier. Nothing to write home about, would not order again, but would ask someone else at my table who ordered it for at least 1 forkful.Nutella Pizza was wonderful. A no brainer if you want dessert
2019-08-20,5,Omg the food was sooo good!! I'm really surprised this place has less than 5 stars. My husband had a chicken Parmesan and I swear it was the best chicken I ever had. Great view, good service and yummy Italian cuisine. We definitely will be back.
2019-08-17,1,Worst Italian restaurant i have ever been to. To start, i ordered their penne vodka and to be quite honest, i could have made it taste better at my own home. I have never been treated this rude at a restaurant that i was completely baffled. Never will I ever return to this restaurant. We had a order mistake and it resulted in the waitress screaming at one of their customers. The manager and the waitress acted so unprofessional to the point where the waitress was so disrespectful she made a guest in our party cry. I have worked in the restaurant business for years and something like this would have never been acceptable at any of the places I worked at. I truly hope they wake up and learn how to manage & train their staff. As well as hiring better chefs!!!!
2019-08-17,1,Came here 8/16/19 for a relatives birthday, food was still as good but service was the worst service possible. Our waitress was rude and needs to be taught how to talk with her customers the right way. We had issues with her not once but two times within 5 mins of her bringing out orders. And both times she had such shitty attitude. I've worked in the restaurant industry and how she handled the situation was disgusting. We reached out to the manager multiple times to let him know what happened, he said all I can do is remove both items and that was ok. Was not apologetic either times and he didn't seem to care. As the night ended he approached me asked me what happened and said she was wrong for handling the situation the way she did and gave my family a $50 gift certificate. I will say this, you've lost me as a customer. I will not be coming back.
2019-08-16,4,Pretty solid place-especially due to its proximity by the water.On nice days they open the windows (today was one of those days, and most tables/seats aside from those at the bar have a direct view of the Hudson and NYC.  The wine list is sufficient for an Italian place-several by the glass, a longer list by the bottle.  You're really coming here thoughfor the view.  It's beautiful.  You can see all the way down to the financial district and all the way up to midtown.  We always get the pizza when we come here-super thin, tasty toppings, and enough to feed two people, and most of them are just under $20.  On a nice day, you can't beat the location with an affordable, good tasting Italian eatery right on the water!
2019-07-20,4,Food is good. The ambiance is okay.Best part is the location sea facing.Pretty quick service .
2019-07-14,2,Very underwhelming experience. Of course, the view is great but both entrees we received were subpar to say the least. The calamari appetizer was pretty good. The red snapper entree was VERY over cooked and rubbery. Almost inedible. The pork chops lacked flavor. Even the soda had a flat odd taste to it. The food took crazy long to come out and to top it off, The bathroom had no toilet seat or toilet paper!!! So disappointing. Again, the view from the restaurant is great and the calamari was good. Other better restaurants nearby at this price point. Will not return.
2019-07-09,2,I ate here and the service was disappointing . The waitress was extremely rude and not attentive at all. On the other hand the food is great but they need to train their employees . I asked her for an appetizer  first and explained to her I had not eaten all day( it was 7pm) and therefore I would like an appetizer while I decide on my main course . She told me that the restaurant policy was to take the full order at once. I thought that was ridiculous since I have never heard that before at other dining venues. It took her forever to finally come and take our whole order. It was not busy at all (Sunday night). Her attitude was just unpleasant. I really love the food and the ambiance but im not sure if I will be going back.
2019-05-28,2,Bad food and bad service, I definitely won't be going back. It's a bummer because the view is wonderful.
2019-05-28,5,This one was on the list for a while now, since we walk past it every time we have a walk along the waterfront. Our waiter was super enthusiastic. He kept us entertained throughout. They had a lot of Italian options. We had clams for the appetizer and margharetta pizza for the main course. For the dessert, we had the lava chocolate cake and cassata which is ice cream cake. Both were delicious.
2019-05-18,1,I was just eating here with my kids on the patio- one of them fell and scraped his elbow really badly. No one tried to help us at all and I went inside to try to find a bandaid and lakes to three hosts and also the bartender was in perfect earshot and they all told me there was nothing they could do for me. No bandaids. I'm a professional chef so I'm very familiar with how a restaurant works and OSHA requires that all restaurants have first aid supplies available. It's massively unsafe to not have first aid items available in a business with knives, glass and of course hundreds of people daily with a variety of varying health needs. My kids cut was actually really bad and needed something to absorb the blood as it was bleeding and dripping in the restaurant. To be clear, they didn't even offer me a napkin. I just actually am like grossed out that a business of this size would even function in this manner.... I did report this to the police as we left as they were outside for a festival and also were able to help us and clean up my kid. Anyway, fuck this place.
2019-04-15,4,Great service, and AWESOME PIZZA!! This can resume my experience here.Great views of New York City , a lit bit of waiting time, but that was expected because of the location, the only less of great thing was the old looking outside area! If you go there try the Metro Pizza!!
2019-04-09,3,I rather not. Ever again.The service and food are just not worth this beautiful location. I've been to Blue Eyes a few years back and just wasn't impressed. The server really was not attentive and the food was nothing special. Maybe it was because of what I ordered last time, and the server was still new? Either way, I decided to give it a go again recently for a friend's birthday, and again, it was just a disappointment. It took a good 10 minutes for anyone to come by to even offer water, then the water took another 10 minutes, and then we couldn't even get a hold of the waiter to order our food. I really did not want to make a big deal because my friend really wanted to try this place out. The view was wonderful, but 20 minutes in and I was ready to abort. When the food came, it was fine but not great. I'd hate to break it to any business out there who don't already know, but without good service, it doesn't really matter how good your products are.
2019-04-08,4,We were in New Jersey recently and were told about this place on the waterfront in Hoboken. We hadn't had Italian in he city and decided to do as the "romans do" when in town. We had picked a perfect day to sit by the waterfront with a gorgeous view of the City in the background. The waitstaff was very friendly and informative. Our food came out quickly and it was delicious. I had ordered the Chicken Parmesan, and Wifey had ordered the Tuto Mari. Lil guy had ordered the Linguini with clams. My in-laws had ordered the Seafood Linguini  and Lobster Ravioli. All the food was very good and the portions were big. Maybe it had to do with that bread at the beginning of the meal, but definitely a lot of food.  We didn't have time for dessert but we were so full from lunch. Excellent views of the City scape and a little Boardwalk/ sidewalk you can walk around on the waterfront. A must stop if your near the Hoboken area and want some Italian cuisine.
2019-04-02,3,I arrived as a walk in on a sunny day and we got seating overlooking  NYC. The ambience is great and the service was good as well, but in a moment of honesty we let the server know that the sauce for the mozzarella sticks could have been better. He actually froze in his steps and asked what could be better. I replied that it was akin to a Ragu sauce. We paid and left a reasonable tip and before we could exit we were blocked and a funny interrogation began. The manager introduced himself and asked why we did not like the sauce since it was something they considered to be a major hit at the establishment.A couple who had been dining there were randomly asked what they thought about the sauce and they sang the praises even saying they look forward to it when they stop in. LOL- and it did not end there because the Mgr. told them we do not like it and the couple's jaws dropped and they instantly began shaming us for not liking it.     I held my ground but I really was not prepared for the backlash or the mgr. actually challenging my taste buds. I have to add that while this all happened and as awkward as it was, no one was rude or disrespectful. The mgr clearly had his feelings hurt and wanted to truly know what it was we did not like. In the end we agreed to disagree and hey I may indeed stop by again because the spot is ok, but I will not be commenting on what I do not like as it seems Mgmt. does not take constructive criticism very well.
2019-04-01,5,My friend and I came here on a Saturday evening.  For drinks we had a pitcher of red wine sangria. Appetizers we had granchio.It was delicious. Dinner I had steak ,mashed potatoes and broccoli rabe.My friend had the snapper fillet,broccoli, and potatoes. Both dishes were delicious. Our waitresses was very attentive. Will definitely come back again
2019-02-16,1,Stayed in NYC for three days with my husband and had to fit this in as myself and my family are huge fans of Sinatra. We were so excited to go here for dinner and were quickly disappointed. The view of the NYC skyline is absolutely beautiful, but unfortunately, that's the only highlight. From where I was seated I saw only one photo of Sinatra and it didn't appear that there was much else in terms of Frank-related decor (aside from the hints of blue) but I'll admit I didn't venture far from the table. I anticipated an old world feel with his music playing in the background and instead heard the likes of Audioslave, Coldplay and the Arctic Monkeys... with not one Sinatra song or even music from that era. How do you name a restaurant after someone IN their hometown and not play their music which is their claim to fame?? We went primetime on a Saturday and ordered a glass of wine each and our meals and were in and out within 35 minutes. I hate when everything is rushed and you feel like they can't wait to get you out of there. Food was mediocre at best. We both ordered 'handmade' pasta (gnocchi for my husband and ravioli for me) and neither tasted like any homemade pasta I've ever had. True Sinatra fans... even if you're thinking to yourself, eh even if the food isn't that great, it will still be an experience... don't bother. You'll feel more of the Frank vibe at just about any other italian restaurant there is, with better food. If anything, check it out when the weather is warm and you can at least enjoy a front row seat to the skyline.
2018-12-22,1,Please dont eat here.  Awful food.  Mays well heat up a frozen entree in the microwave.  Ate here with guests and ended up apologizing to them for the awful choice for dinner. Would never eat here and dont understand anyone having anything good to say about the food.  Must be fake reviews.
2018-12-09,1,Went to this restuarant last night before going out to bars and was highly disappointed. First off the bread we got was hard and wasnt warm. Although the veiw was nice it wasnt worth the price of the items on menu. First the eggplant parm was 20$ but no salad or pasta with it. When gwtting it, it was baked thick eggplant with way too much sauce and not enough cheese. Lastly the pizZa was all soggy and it seemed like they rushed it out of the oven. We wont be attending this place again.
2018-11-10,4,Thumbs Up away from the hustle  and bustle with beautiful view Excellent service and great calamari
2018-11-07,5,I simply used yelp to find this restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the amazing food, service and drink selection. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a low key environment and amazing Bolognese!! The view was absolutely beautiful of the New York skyline.
2018-10-24,4,I used to see this restaurant every evening on my walk after dinner but never thought of trying it out. Me and my colleague were planning to go Thai restaurant in neighborhood and end up walking to this restaurant.  This is small but clean restaurant. We immediately got the seats with best view. The menu is Italian and look unique.We ordered below dishes:Burrata pugliese - it's an appetizer and defiantly tasty. It comes with mozzarella  cheese so creamy and tasty, toasted bread and tomatoes. I liked it, rating 4/5Polpo Alla Griglia- this is grilled octopus tail with salad. I did not like this dish, octopus was so hard to chew but salad was yum. Rating 3/5Margherita pizza - this was one of the best best pizza I ever had. I have tried margherita pizza at many Italian joints but here it's one of the best!!! We finished whole pizza maybe just in 15mins. It was delicious! Rating 5/5Penne alla vodka pasta - this was great dish and the sauce was delicious. But by the time we started on pasta it was little dry. May be we were already satisfied with pizza we didn't want to have much. But it's indeed tasty! Rating 4/5Service : quick rating 5/5Ambience : since we got seats outside with best view rating 5/5Parking: this is crowded neighborhood so parking is tough. If you don't find parking try parking opposite to hotel W at river street. Not going to rate for parking as we parked at hotel W.It was worth a visit for us! Uploading few
2018-10-02,3,Service was good . Have had better gf pasta( tasted like corn) pricey for the few smallish shrimps thrown in, but I understand we  are paying for the scenic view of the river and City skyline. The pizza was better.
2018-09-26,5,Amazing gluten free pizza!!! The dough is crusty and yet doughy and yeasty, just like the real thing. All other dishes that I have tried were good as well.
2018-09-23,3,The location is key here. It sits on the sidewalk of Frank Sinatra Drive overseeing the NYC view. I was not all that happy about the food. Had the Clams Oreganata, Penne and Vodka, and a specialty pizza. If it wasn't for the location I wouldn't come back again.FYI:No hard liquor here. Just beer, wine and soda.
2018-09-14,1,If you're coming to eat dinner like we were then stay away. The food was horrible. Pizza was okay. I've had way better Italian food elsewhere. HOWEVER, if you're coming for drinks and a view then this is a great place for that.
2018-09-03,4,Having lived in Hoboken for a while, I figured I would finally give this place a try. The waiter and staff were extremely nice, the view is obviously part of the experience. The food was good, pasta was cooked good and the pizza was fresh, a tad runny but nothing to complain about. All in all, good place to grab food on a nice sunny day along the water, will def come back.
2018-09-01,5,So i'm not a fan of seafood but the people i was with loved the seafood even the appetizer clams. i myself got just the vodka penne pasta which was absolutely wonderful. I loved the sauce and with the parmesan on top YUM! Also had some of the margarita pizza which was also very good i just wasn't a fan of the choice of bread and it was a little hard to eat because of the bread being so thin but the toppings was very good and very fresh. Good service as well and also the best sangria
2018-08-25,1,if I could put 0 stars I would most definitely do so. This restaurant has the worst service out of all the restaurants I have ever been to. they messed up my family's order almost 5 times. Terrible, just terrible.
2018-08-21,1,Nice menu, but I was not impressed with their food or service. Small dinner portions, overpriced and way too salty. Spend your money elsewhere.
2018-08-19,5,Best gluten-free pizza -- made from scratch!Most restaurants use premade crust for their gluten-free pizzas. Typically, this results in soggy or cardboard-like pizza.  Blue Eyes is the only restaurant I've been to where they make their dough from scratch. It makes a huge difference! The crust was chewy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The edges were even "puffed up" and you could hold it in your hand without it falling apart. Portion-wise, it was around 12 inches vs the usual 8 inches or less like most gf pizzas. We couldn't believe a pizza this good was gluten-free. We had dined the night before and the table next to us ordered a gf pizza and they couldn't believe it was gf and also commented that it was the best they've had.  In addition to the delicious food, the service and staff are great and you get an unbeatable view of the NYC skyline!
2018-08-18,5,l enjoyed the food very much. Love the Glutenfree menu.Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Love the NYC views and beingso close to the Hudson River.
2018-08-16,5,In my opinion, it's the best pizza in Hoboken. If you want real Italian Pizza, this is the place. I like to bring all my family from Italy here because I know they will be impressed and happy and I won't have to hear them complain on the phone about how the food in America sucks. Great salads and attentive service. AND they are pretty much the only place I now know of that serves crema di cafe. The view of the city is an added bonus.
2018-08-04,3,Had lunch there. Crab salad was ok. Chicken fingers for my daughter was dry and hard.  Service was eh.
2018-07-31,1,If I could give this restaurant a 0 I would. I would like to ask the manager and chef if they themselves would eat the dish we were served.   Had lunch there and ordered ravioli filled with cheese and spinach and my Mom ordered the linguine with shrimp, calamari and pesto sauce. The food came quick, almost too quick and was luke warm. My ravioli was in a sauce that looked like liquid diarrhea and the calamari had a gross raw, like very raw fish taste which means the calamari was old and spoiled. I swear to God we better not get food poisoning. I took a bite and spit it out in my napkin. The back of the restaurent had piles of garbage laying out, they nedx to make that area look mpre sanitary. That should have been a sign. Ill never go there again!!!!!
2018-07-18,5,We just celebrated my daughters birthday here tonight and we had a fabulous time.  The food was great, the staff bent over backwards to make the night perfect and the view was spectacular!  We will definitely be going back again.
2018-07-08,1,Pizza is soggy in the middle but burnt on the bottom, pasta was not hot, it was disgusting cold and tasteless, the owner was being rude to my wife when she confronted him about the food not being made fresh, like he said it was, and he said that pasta took  20 min to make, guess what? that pasta came out in literally 5min after we ordered, he says he has the best Italian food around Hoboken, but it's definitely not, he even said this is a American dish real Italians don't even eat penne Alla vodka, he made himself look even worse... unhappily we let the beautiful view fool us when we looked this place up on google, The only reason I gave a tip was because my server was nice. But also at the end he noticed my wife was writing a review on her phone and made a very sarcastic comment about it, which he was looking at her phone from the inside window, so disrespectful! What a shame
2018-07-07,1,Hoboken's worse restaurant I've ever been to. My wife and I came to this place with a breathtaking view for a "nice" afternoon with her grandma, when we got there everything look nice and the waiter was very pleasant but after I got a sweet tea  and got an unsweetened tasteless tea And ordered a new one the waiter didn't believe me and tried it out of my cup, which is very unprofessional then he brought me a new one and the same thing happen didn't taste like tea just like a cup of water with honey in it after I had to complain about my potatoes being completely raw in the polpo a la Mediterranean, the pasta being tasteless, hard and cold, and instead having a apology I will get you something else, NO the owner decided to be rude and completely unprofessional and unpleasant, saying that I don't know what I'm talking about, and that this is the best restaurant in Hoboken, sure the view is beautiful but the food is a completely mess even the pizza was watery and falling apart, so come on man after being a chef and waiter in a few restaurants I do know very well what I'm talking about, don't make fun, the waiter had to calm down the rude owner, which I've never ever seen that before. Never coming back here not even for a simple sweet tea!  the pictures look good but believe the food is disgusting!
2018-06-29,5,I had a wonderful experience coming to this restaurant, Jerry the owner and his employee Rafael were amazing and their hospitality was incredible, definitely coming back to this place and the view is amazing! Omg the pizza is so good and definitely fresh made you have to come and enjoy for sure! Wow! What a service
2018-06-26,3,I went to Blue Eyes on the evening of the Hoboken Frank Sinatra singing contest with my family a couple weeks ago. I had a great view of NYC and the Hudson River which is a good thing about this restaurant. One of my family members ordered an appetizer that I believe had octopus and potatoes..? Long story short, the dish came without a component or two and our waitress kind of denied the fact that not all parts of the dish were there! That same family member ordered pasta with a pesto sauce which he said was just okay. I ordered penne vodka which I think could have used a little more sauce. We did also order a clam appetizer that was very delicious.
2018-06-16,1,I got the grilled octopus salad which was dry and cold - tasteless. My bf got chicken Parmigiana that tasted like the sauce was served out of a can. Portions of pasta was maybe a 1/2 c. Our bill was $50 for what ?  Terrible food and small portions. We won't be back!
2018-06-15,2,Just ate there for my very first time tonight with my family, celebrating very big milestones. The waiter was nasty and rushing us the whole time. He was rude and not attentive. Honestly, ordering felt like we were bothering him the whole time. The food was okay. We came in from Carlstadt/Fairfield area, and I've had way better Italian food in my neighborhood than this spot. I think if the service was better I would feel otherwise but not coming back after tonight :/
2018-06-11,1,TOURIST TRAP STAY AWAY!!!!!!  1 hour to get food, then waiter forgets the pizza I  specifically  ordered with light sauce so you think he would not forget a special order?????  So when the pizza finally comes it was soggy and full of sauce that made it soggy,. .  I went back to read the reviews about pizza, 3 years of reviews about soggy pizza. You think maybe after so many reviews said so they would do something about it???   The owner says its from the fresh MOZZ. I guess all the places that serve pizza with fresh Mozzarella have soggy pizza. NO just this place and they do nothing about it. So That alone is a clue that this place  seems to not care about the quality of food. Makes you wonder what other things they don't care about maybe sanitation?    My Aunt ordered Lobster ravioli with chunks of lobster according to the menu. $ 14.00. 7 ravioli with tiny pieces of lobster Not a chunk on the plate.  NEVER AGAIN. To bad Frank Sinatra has his name associated with this place. His family should be outraged. Ciao
2018-06-09,3,I went here last night with two of my girlfriends. We were seated right away without a reservation at about 7 on a Friday night. The waitstaff was super nice, quiet and hard to hear at times but nice. Our food on the other hand was subpar at best. We order the margarita pizza, mussels, and the eggplant. The pizza was soggy, mussels were almost fishy and the eggplant just wasn't that good lol. We're from south jersey and came here for my birthday dinner because c of the awesome view.. food not so much!
2018-06-07,2,Came here to celebrate my boyfriends recent graduation. It was a weekday around 8pm. The place was not too packed but we expected that. Our server was OK. She greeted us, took our orders. Ya know the usual. My boyfriend and I ordered marg pizza and penne pasta. I have to say it wasn't anything to blow my socks off. The pasta noodles were very hard. The sauce was nothing special... no one offered cheese to top it off (I mean it is an Italian restaurant). Overall it was very mediocre and not worth the price tag attached to it. The first batch of bread we got for the table was served cold. We asked for another fresh batch. After that, we asked for more bread for the table. The server then goes "next time I'm going to charge you, we only serve two rounds of bread..." kinda took me "off" guard... but. I felt that totally could have been said differently or not at all. I never heard of a cap on bread for the table? Anyway. They have a great view and is literally RIGHT on the water.
2018-06-05,1,Just the name alone should make it clear that this place is just trying to squeeze $ out of the oh so overplayed & tired Hoboken/Sinatra connection (hint: Frank left and NEVER came back; just as this place should do!).   Food was bland, service forgettable and cheesy vibe
2018-06-02,2,Just the name alone should make it clear that this place is just trying to squeeze $ out of the oh so overplayed & tired Hoboken/Sinatra connection.   Food was bland, service forgettable and cheesy vibe.
2018-06-01,1,Tonight my husband and I decided to take a walk and try this place out. It is highly overpriced for mediocre food. The pizza was wood fired and soggy. The chairs inside are falling apart and clearly taped together with black duck tape. As I am waiting for my check I can watch employees wipe their face and then touch the bread that they cut (with no gloves on) and give to you at the table. From the inside table I was seated at I could see into the kitchen where they took a pre made bagged frozen dessert and plated it with some whipped cream so I could guess that's not worth the money they charged for it.There are much better restaurants for the price you pay.
2018-06-01,3,Food was average, great views of the city skyline. Unfortunately, the waitress did not ask us if we wanted another drink for quite a while and everyone at the table glass was empty.
2018-05-18,1,The food is less than subpar. My boyfriend and I went for dinner. We started out with the clams oreganata. They were packed with breadcrumbs and it was soggy and not done enough for my liking. I usually like when the breadcrumbs have a bit of a crunch and they dont overpower the clam. They had no flavor and made my boyfriend sick the next day. We were very disappointed with it. For entrees, I got the seafood spaghetti special. The pasta was so hard it was not edible (I am an Italian who likes my pasta al dente and this was even too hard for me). I had to send it back. My boyfriend got the steak with mushrooms, potatoes, and broccoli rabe: Tagliata alla Robespierre. They used mushrooms out of a CAN!!! It covered the entire steak and ruined the meal. You would expect an upscale restaurant with a prime location to use fresh ingredients. We were both extremely disappointed with our meals and will not be returning. The prices are very high for the quality of the food. We spent over $100 on a meal we both hated. The waitress was very nice, and the view is great, but the food was awful and I would not recommend coming here.
2018-05-08,5,If you feel like having pizza and desert at the same time - this is the place. The Nutela Canoli Pizza is amazing.
2018-05-05,4,Cannot go wrong with their good good quality good tasting food with a special touch that became their signature and definitely has brought my coworkers and I back for lunch they're a little pricey but worth it they have a lunch special as well which is great
2018-04-28,1,One star for the view. Gross food! Not Edible. Disgusting.Filthy place. Poor service. Don't waste your time and money. Skip this one ..... walk right past it !!
2018-04-21,3,Mediocre food with a great view. Our waitress battled us on getting white sangria insisting that she'd have to return it anyway because we probably won't like it. After all that the red sangria was just ok.  Server was overloaded with tables so a small table of two was ignored. We waited for 20 minutes for our check. Chicken was over cooked mashed potatoes and spinach were good. Wouldn't return for dinner - would return to try the pizza
2018-04-12,4,Had a wonderful dinner this evening at Blue Eyes!  Started with perfectly prepared pappardelle with zucchini, cherry tomatoes and scallops as a first course (shared with my dining partner).  The pappardelle were al dente, the scallops tender and sweet, the tomatoes flavorful and bright.  I then had a pork chop with mushrooms, roasted potatoes and broccoli rabe.  The pork chop was moist, tender, and perfectly seasoned; the mushrooms were flavorful and cooked just right.  Dessert was a house-made lemon sorbetto that was fragrant and just sweet enough.  Service was gracious and pleasant.  Our waiter, Fabrizio,  was attentive and friendly without being overbearing, and very patient with us as we chatted away.  All in all a very pleasant dining experience, and I look forward to returning to try one of the pizzas that I saw being served to others.  They looked great!   Bravo!!!
2018-04-10,5,When you come to NY/NJ Blue Eyes is a must stop!  Though Pizza is their forte theirs Italian seafood is to die for.  Get a little bit of everything! The best food the best atmosphere all while playing Frank Sinatra while you enjoy.
2018-04-03,4,Found this place on Yelp. Arrived for an early dinner at 5:30, immediate seating at a table overlooking the river and Manhattan.Waiter was really nice and friendly. I had a glass of wine. We ordered calamari/shrimp appetizer. Though breaded and fried, it was delicious and very tender.I had the gnocchi with a special request of vodka sauce. This dish was wonderful, with excellent flavor.Topped it off with a shared slice of cheesecake, perfect ending.Definitely worth the 5 mile drive from the hotel during rush hour.
2018-03-31,2,Came here to celebrate my cousins birthday, they were very accomadating for a party of 21 and our waitress was very attentive. The only thing that was unsettling to me was seeing the wait staff cut loaf after loaf of bread with their bare hands. I wouldn't have a problem if it was done by a designated cook staff but no. The staff would handle menus, make drinks seat customers and then go and cut their bread wearing no gloves! Are at least washing their hands!
2018-03-23,4,Great scenery. Food was mediocre but the service made up for it. Got a bottle of wine and dinner for two. It relatively affordable for an upscale restaurant with high ratings. I definitely think it is a must especially in the summer and spring when you can enjoy the views and maybe a stroll along Frank Sinatra drive.
2018-03-10,2,Location and view are superb -the food was subpar at best - plenty of other options to consider in Hoboken. Very pricey considering the portions you get for the cost . Chicken parm was tough and dry , pizza was burnt on the bottom and broccoli was over cooked -will surely look elsewhere next visit .
2018-02-18,5,Came here again and just A-A-Amazing-Saucemazing customer service! I was bummed the weather wasn't so great but spring/summer are on their way and I get to enjoy lunch/dinner by the river!!
2018-02-11,5,Great view of the NYC skyline! Food was very tasty as well, after sharing the calamari, zucchini and shrimp appetizer, my wife had the ravioli in a sage sauce, and I had the veal parmesan. Everything came out in a timely manner, and was very good. The waiter staff also made sure our needs were taken care of excellently. Definitely intend on returning when in town again.
2018-01-27,5,The food was great. Generous portions. Nice ambience. Extremely pleasant and helpful staff. Great location. We'll be back for sure.
2018-01-02,4,The location is beautiful! Beautiful sky line view. Cool ambience. The food was subpar Wish there were more options in the menu.
2017-12-17,4,Came here on a dreary evening and sat in the enclosed area so we could watch the rain come across the Hudson...if you come here for one reason, come for the views of NYC. However, even if there wasn't a view, come for the tasty traditional NJ meets Italian staples and great service.
2017-11-17,3,For a place that is next to the water, one would expect more of an upscale vibe. Came here with some friends for a birthday dinner and the overall experience was mix. First of all there is no actual bar which is a big thumbs down. Stay away from the sangria. It is awful. Bathroom is a mess and not to clean. Service is good, but food is ok. Needs that extra push for more flavor. I don't believe I would go back to this place again.1
2017-11-10,1,Not appetizing at all! Horrible service! Our waiter would talk shit about us when he walked away. The price was not worth the food! I will not be coming here again ! Very displeased
2017-11-05,2,This is how my 60 dollar meal arrived to me tonight. We waited over an hour to get this. The delivery driver apologized profusely stating that something was leaking, however, I suspect it was dropped or manhandled. He offered to bring it back but we had already waited so long I didn't feel like waiting any more. Food was decent but luke warm and very thrown around. This is our second time ordering from Blue Eyes and both times the delivery was disappointing.
2017-10-26,4,The pizza is good along with a glass a wine. The view is absolutely fanatastic a great afforable date place in Hoboken.The rest of the menu is kind of boring and not great. They should consider revisiting the menu options because they have potential to be so much more
2017-10-25,1,My husband and I hosted our rehearsal dinner here with around 50 people. We were explained that the restaurant would be open to other diners but there would be a partition splitting up. I couldn't really see how they could fit other diners but since they were the experts I gave in. We were packed in so extremely tight you could not move. The staff was overwhelmed. There were two kids in attendance total and I had to go ask the waitress for a high chair, that table was also not served drinks an hour into dinner, it was embarrassing. Food was okay, it was moderately good. Than it came time for the speeches which were so awkward. We had diners in the middle of our tables. Who goes out to eat and wanted to listen to speeches for a dinner they aren't attending, not me. There was no divider. Than what pissed me off even more was I look over and one of the owners is sitting done gabbing to a huge table of 8 who was complaining the speeches were happening. They were his friends! Are you kidding me. Ruined my rehearsal dinner. Do yourself a favor and pick a different place.
2017-10-24,3,Ehhh is all I can say about this place...3 stars for great service and the view. After that ehhh so so...Clams appetizer was excellent have to say.  Calamari was avergae at best.  Average salads .Main dishes consisted mostly of pasta and again average , penned w vodka not great , chicken parmesan  sauce  was a little wateryNow the pizza , wow what can i say what a huge disappointment ..Was expecting top notch pizza as they have a wood burning oven right there by the bar and the pizza man makes pizza right there ...however the pizza dough itself was very non discrept...Just a bland blah slab of dough   with no umph to it at all ,  thin crust pizza should have a good snap to it this was nothing like that Average entrees , pizza was a huge let down
2017-10-09,3,I met my niece here on a whim visiting from NC and it turned out to be a pleasant place. I had asked my cousin from Astoria, "What he recommended in hoboken?" He sent me here. To start off, the place isnt very large, seating is a little tight but the waitress was very kind and accommodating. It has some novelty old school photos throughout, with a beach bar type atmosphere being right on the river, overlooking the westside of NYC. We had a party of 10 without reservations so we were very grateful that they could squeeze us in! We started with some good Italian bread with some evo with crushed pepper. Then we ordered some Margarita pie and calamari for appetizers, yum!  I also had the orecchiette with broccoli rabe, sausage and pasta which were amazingly tender and juicy, sorry no photos lol, I ate it all up and actually forgot! Wine choice was nice and prices were good. Nice for families, tourists, amazing view with outside tables as well...Ps. Bathrooms were outside? A little peculiar but hey, it is what it is.
2017-10-01,2,Not sure how other reviewers can even rate above a 3. The biggest draw just seems the location with the NYC skyline view. And even that wasn't even impressive.Service was friendly and DYI. Which means the  server kindly hands you your glass or plate of food rather than placing it on the table. I don't mind lending a hand in tight spots but this was not the case.Pizza was blah. Nothing special. For dessert we tried the cannoli pie. Had no idea that this was just some filling on top of the same horrible pizza dough. Awful. Other desserts were all pre-made from a national supplier. No luck there either.If you're looking for a great meal in town look elsewhere. If you're taste buds lack and you drool for a view go for it.
2017-10-01,4,We ordered the spinach/watermelon/goat cheese salad and two pizzas - the one with eggplant and the one with broccoli rabe. Everything was good! The restaurant is in a great location with a beautiful view of downtown Manhattan and right on the boardwalk, which makes for a relaxing walk after dinner. The service was great. Little pricey for the quality but would recommend!
2017-09-10,4,Gets 4 stars mostly for location and vibe.  Old school Italian vibe and amazing views of Hudson River and NYC.  Food is good not great.  Pizza is too saucy and soft.  A little pricey but you are paying for the experience.
2017-08-30,4,Great food and view! A little overpriced but goodThe cutlery needs to be replaced ASAP. It not only looks cheap but I found myself constantly in a battle between my pizza and the knife . It just doesn't cut anything.
2017-08-26,5,I was pleasantly surprised how good the food was. Everything was super authentic Italian and even our server was only living in the states for a year! My mother was born in Italy and loved her meal. I'd come back here in a heartbeat!
2017-08-21,5,Arrived around 4 pm to celebrate our anniversary. We were told to grab a table.  Our server was polite , prompt, and didn't rush us as we wanted to take in the amazing view and enjoy our sangria.  We had a pitcher of white sangria that I feel could have been better.  It just tasted like wine and some pieces of apples inside.  We had the fritura app which had fried calamari, shrimp, and zucchini. Very tasty.  I had a salad and hubby had the tilapia both which were delicious. We both had espresso which topped the perfect dinner. I'll definitely be back !! But let's work on that sangria recipe please lol
2017-08-19,5,GREAT LOCATION!People just like to complain about little things .The service is great i didn't have no problem, the food is good. You pay what you get. I read some of the reviews clearly people don't know what 5 stars restaurant stand for. This place is great i will definitely come back.
2017-07-27,4,We came here to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is located a few feet from the water. I was skeptical because of the reviews but we really wanted a nice view and to be close to the water.They don't take reservations. We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday. There was only two parties ahead of us. We were seated in a about 20minutes. The restaurant has an inside which seems pretty small and an outdoors that is covered with a canopy. We sat outside. Started with the Calamari , shrimp and zucchini app. It was MY fav! Just wish there were a few more shrimp. For dinner we were both in basic moods and got chicken parm. I usually order mine with sauce of the side of the spaghetti. They misunderstood and they gave me mine sauceless (that's ok!). The sauce turned out being soooooo delicious. I wish the portions were just a little bigger. Skipped dessert. The Pinot Noir we ordered was delicious and had a high alcohol content lmao. Service was goood but could've been better.
2017-07-26,4,Went on a double date to this Hudson River eatery during the fall time. Food was good but not necessarily mind blowing - it was the overall experience I enjoyed. "Blue Eyes" was Frank Sinatra's nickname. Hoboken is also the birthplace of Sinatra, so the combo is fitting. Fall time in NYC / Hoboken is a magical time. You piece that all together, and a meal along the Hudson River in fall with Frank Sinatra playing in the background as you watch the sun set against the Manhattan Skyline is quite the experience.Food: Mezzalune di Spinaci e Ricotta Pasta was not bad, but again not worth the trip just for the food. We also all tried a piece of the Diavola pizza which was doughy and well made.I pass this spot on my runs all the time and always seems to have a steady flow of customers. Might give it another try in fall if the stars align. Keep playing those Frank Sinatra tunes!
2017-07-10,2,Meh. Not cheap. Not good. 2 stars at best. Nice view though. Sangria was descent but food wasn't.
2017-07-10,4,Location location location. That's what stood out to me the most about this spot when we were looking for a restaurant on the water this past Saturday night. It stands out as the closest to the water in Hoboken, and I assumed that would mean it would be PACKED on a beautiful Saturday night at dinnertime - but we had no wait. I even called ahead and was nervous when they said they don't take reservations for less than 3 people, but we had no issue siting right along the open windows outside, closest to the views. On one side you see the Empire State Building (partially blocked by a baseball field net) and on the other side a perfect view of World Trade and the financial district. For a casual night out, this place is definitely on the pricier side - probably the reason it wasn't as packed as it could have been. $17 for an app of fried calamari with a few pieces of fried shrimp and fried zucchini thrown it. My bf got a ceasar salad ($13)- small portion for a dinner salad. I went with a pasta entree because I love pesto - Garganelli con Patate e Gamberetti al Pesto (Egg penne shaped pasta with potatoes and shrimp in a pesto sauce) for $20. Pretty good pasta, only a few pieces of shrimp and I didn't think the potatoes were necessary in the dish, would have been better if there was just more shrimp for the price. Not terrible entree prices and glass of wine is only $7, but can definitely find cheaper elsewhere for the quality and portions. Total cost still came out to $70 + tip. Basically paying for the view and good service.
2017-07-08,4,The food here is good.  I'm not going to say its great, but its definitely pretty good.  Ultimately you come here for the view.  There is better and cheaper Italian all over hoboken/jersey city but the view is second to none.If you want to enjoy a good meal with an amazing view, then this is a good place.  If you're only there for the food, then try something else.
2017-07-04,2,First off, the view and location is what gives this restaurant high ratings. The food, not so much.I came here because the menu looked great and I wanted to see the fireworks on the 4th of July and have a great dinner with my boyfriend. The person who sat us was very nice and gave us a great seat in perfect view of the Hudson River and the fireworks coming from NYC.The bread they gave us after we ordered was bland and nothing special. One of my stars is because of the great value of the wine. A craffe of wine ( almost two glasses) is fifteen dollars. Great value! I ordered the Margarita Pizza and the vegetable pizza that had tomatoes, broccoli rabe, sauce and cheese. Both of these pies were TERRIBLE. No flavor. No taste. Pizza dough was doughy and not crispy. Honestly, worst piece of pizza I have had in a long time. For a personal pie it was expensive and it had no reason to be! My two stars are for the beautiful view of NYC and the value of the wine. I suggest coming here for drinks and to enjoy the view.
2017-06-24,5,Superb! Authentic pizza from Naples. Great spot for views of mid and downtown NYC. We shared a margarita pie. The char on the slightly salty crust, with just enough mozzarella and basil made this pie very fresh and light. We also split the chicken parmigiana. Pounded to perfection with a light, chunky tomato sauce served with perfectly al dente penne. Don't miss the Nutella pizza! The same incredible crust with an ample spread of Nutella, finished off with a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream. Add a glass of Pinot Grigio and enjoy the day! We will be back!
2017-06-18,5,I felt right at home at this place,  the margarita pizza was amazing.  Service was great.  Clams, salmon and desserts all were great.  Hoboken needed this place. I strongly recommend.
2017-06-18,4,I had an enjoyable time here, meeting up with Jersey City teachers.  Eating outside on a nice day made the gathering more pleasant.  The wait staff is local, efficient, and flexible.  Blue Eyes offers a variety of "personal-sized" thin-crust pizzas.  I shared the crab salad and a pizza with a friend.  She took home the left over pizza.  Not knowing the area, this place was incredibly hard to find, then impossible to find a parking space.  You feed the meter station, then walk back to the car to put the receipt on the dashboard.  Getting out of Hoboken was also frustrating.  But I recommend Blue Eyes for locals who can take public transport or walk.  Sinatra Park is a happening place.
2017-06-10,4,The place is so nice, the view is amazing, the pizza is so delicious, but some services are so poor, for example they don't have system, the server do everything manually, it look so bad for a place so fancy like blue eyes in Hoboken! Please improve it!
2017-06-07,2,The views are great for a nice summer day. The food was meh at best. Bronzino was dry, calamari was fishy, waiter seemed annoyed by questions asked. We have heard that the pizza here is what you should get so maybe that's where we went wrong. Unfortunately, we stirred away from the pizza due to the unappetizing description used on the  menu. Will try to go back and update on the pizza.
2017-05-28,5,I need to update some information: now Blue Eyes has its own gluten free pizza, made by the pizza chef.He doesn't buy it somewhere else, he makes it himself. Trust me, it's as good as the non gluten free pizza. It's the best. Thank you for caring for your customers. The food is unbelievable, real Italian food,I wish I could give 10 stars!
2017-05-27,4,I only had takeout via Seamless so I can really only address that.   I was very pleased with the food.  They have a lot of entrees and even have whole wheat pasta.  Everything we ordered was tasty and the delivery was at the quicker end of what seamless estimated, so I am pleased with that.   Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food.   I will order from here again for sure and may stop in to eat some day
2017-05-27,5,I absolutely loved Blue Eyes. First off let's talk about LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! The view couldn't get any more perfect. It's located in Hoboken, so already, that's a plus. But that view made every sip of champagne even sweeter. We sat at a table for 2 with the perfect view. Our waiter was an older man, very nice, very Italian. We felt as if were back in Venice. As our waiter gave us time to think about our order, another gentleman came around and was giving a champagne tasting. Of course, my bf and I tried it and loved it, so we got a bottle. As our app, we ordered the Burrata Pugliese. As our entrees, I got the Linguine Nere with shrimp and my boyfriend got the steak dish. My bf was raving about his delicious meal and my pasta was perfect. I wish I had some more now! All the food was amazing! Food was a 5 for us and so was the service. Everyone at Blue Eyes is so friendly and can definitely expect us back! Thanks Blue Eyes for such a nice evening!
2017-05-26,1,This was one of the worst experiences we had for a restaurant.  About a month and half before the event, we had called in to reserve 20 people for a graduation party and they said there would be seating inside.  A few days before the event we know there would a few more people coming and walked over to talk to them directly to give them the updated 25 person count.  They said, no problem.  The day of the event, it was a cold day, they put us outside seating, no windows wince they put in in storage, on the side with no sun and everyone was so cold.  The manager said he could not do anything about it. There was seating for us inside, but did not allow us to sit inside, the inside had his Italian, what looked like, connect people if you know what I mean, which I assume pushed us outside.  Our almost 30 guys that came from over an hour car ride away were freezing outside.  They charged us the $200 deposit and for the liquor we had drank, but we could not even stay for dinner since they took so long to server us.  The picture shows all white with black chairs, but it was crappy outside seat chair that they put us on.  This was one of the worst experiences at a restaurants I have had in a long time.  Warning - do not go there.  Oh one other time I went with my sister, and she ordered pizza, but it turned out to be salad on a pizza, which what just as horrible.  Outside of the view - stay away!
2017-05-17,5,We came here with my daughter and 11 of her friends for her Sweet 16.  The food was great, the staff made you feel like family!  It was a wonderful experience.
2017-05-16,5,Not sure how a restaurant could land such a perfect location in Hoboken-it's the closest establishment to the river with beautiful unrestricted views of the city while being in the middle of Frank Sinatra park where you can roam around during or after your meal. Hoboken's hottest bars on the water are within walking distance. Location aside, this place has the most genuine staff and the freshest ingredients. If you've been to Italy then you will notice the similarity. Definite must for New Jerseyans to take their New York visitors here and a great spot for brunch. & New Yorkers should go for the prices.
2017-05-07,5,The BEST and closest thing to authentic pizza that I have EVER eaten in America (& I have eaten pizza in Naples, Italy so this says a lot). Every single thing on the menu is delicious and served to perfection. The staff is incredibly sweet and friendly. I even spent NYE here and it was a great time! Highly recommended to everyone-especially to any Italian-Americans looking for a taste of home.
2017-04-03,3,Positives - food and location are great. Negatives - service is slow on weekends and I was constantly having to look for the server who was not very attentive. My wineglass also came with lipstick stains on it not washed off from previous use.
2017-03-26,4,Sat 3/25/17  cool overcast afternoon .... had a beer while sitting along the outside wall/window.  We didn't eat.
2017-02-23,4,Came here for a late dinner before closing. Great view and atmosphere. The food was decent. I would definitely go back again. It's a good intimate spot to go on a date.
2017-02-02,2,I gave this place two stars based on the view. The view is amazing from this place and when i ate here i saw a proposal. The food is  okay and pricey for mediocre food. The food lacks taste/spices. I ordered the ravioli and the brown sage sauce was bland and the plate portion for the ravioli was small as i was still hungry after finishing my plate for the price of my plate. The sangria wasn't bad. Also the space is small and feels crammed.
2016-12-11,2,Touristy.  Food is ok. Place is mediocre except for the view.  I am not a big fan but for family or a big group it's ok.
2016-12-08,4,I would recommend this place for a casual date night or dinner with old friends. The food meets all expectations, which I mean as strong praise given that expectations for Italian-America fare are high in its neighborhood. Pasta, fresh oven pizza, and the Nutella/cannoli  dessert pie were standouts. The chicken parmigiana was flavorful if not overwhelming. Service was prompt and personal; never overbearing. The detractions are par for the course; it's a small space and exterior seating feels somewhat "bolt-on" in the winter months. We experienced no delay on a Friday night, however, and the accommodation on the riverfront is unmatched in this price range. A fair wine selection to boot!
2016-11-30,5,My boyfriend and I had a nice experience because of our waitress Christine! Phenomenal help and attentiveness! We started with the frittura aka fried calamari, the we had the Caesar salad to share and after that we had the Margarita pizza. For dessert we had Nutella cappuccino and the Bomba ice cream! We enjoyed every bit of it!
2016-11-04,2,our waitress Cassandra was very nice however the food was dmfar from up to par. we had a pizza that was so soggy you could even lift the slice and so salty....then had the grilled octopus which was grilled and cooked perfect. our meals were squid linguini with seafood which was so salty he couldn't finish eating it and the salmon was also totally over salted. there was another service waiter that was a skinny Italian guy, speaking Italian yelling at all the other staff members fir no reason and being very rude to guests. we went to walk out the side terrace door and he told us what's the matter with you go the way you came....meaning the front door. ok buddy great lasting imoression. I should have known when the place was empty on a Friday at 7pm in hoboken. many better choices and I hope that staff member improves his attitude cause he's gonna run that place further in the ground.
2016-10-29,5,Everything was great! Great food, comfortable atmosphere, Christina is a nice attentive waitress and a beautiful view. We all enjoyed our food so it's probably safe to order anything.
2016-10-19,1,The one star is for the view which is spectacular.  Tonight was advertised as two hours of live Neopolitan music.  The music was unbearably loud...everyone was complaining that they could not hold a conversation...no matter how many people complained, nothing was done to accomodate the diners.We hurriedly ate our soggy pizza so as to leave quickly.  As we finished paying, someone eho appeared to be the owner walked by and I tried to tell him that the last extremely loud nusic made for an unpleasant meal, he just shrugged his shoulders. Have been there a few times prior to this...the view ..especially when weather permits outside dining is hatd to beat but since the food is at best mediocre.and the attitude of management is dismissive, I will not be back.
2016-10-05,1,Beautiful view if you're looking out onto the water. If you have your back to the view, we'll, that's a different scene. I saw one waiter running his hands through his hair, and I just felt relieved he wasn't serving us. There was also a dirty plastic shelving unit you'd find in a garage, that had cardboard boxes with supplies (one waiter kept reaching over our heads without excusing himself once) Drinks: over priced, and not good. Horrible overly brandied sangria with apples & lemons. Tiny glass of cheap champagne w orange juice for $10? No. Food: not impressed at all. Out of meatballs...seriously? We were there at 1pm! Flavorless bolognese, tough chicken parm, and the $20 pie w mushrooms, prosciutto and truffle oil was gross, and I effing love pizza. No oil, mostly sauce, barely any cheese or mushrooms, and slabs of prosciutto that was so tough the whole piece flies off the slice when you try to bite into it. Service: needs a lot of work. Saw one waiter drop food on a guest and then ours slams our food down, doesn't ask if we need anything. Never again.
2016-10-04,4,The best water-front view you can get in Hoboken. Pasta is pretty delicious. Definitely recommend.
2016-09-23,5,Had dinner again here and I just read 2 reviews that are ridiculous... 1st one saying he didn't get bread or told specials possibly because of "RACE" and 2nd review was SHE DIDN'T LIKE TO SEE LOBSTERS DISPLAYED. I'm happy to see blue eyes responded back and the reason why I  always return here and bring my family and friends  from california here is because they are super friendly..always greet you.. always ask if we need anything and because of the LOBSTERS, and I have to add when I'm asked if I can move my grand daughter stroller which is $400 have to add that in because that's important  (being sarcastic) I don't wig out.. strollers take up space. Every restaurant has its days but hands down this place is one to go and enjoy great food.. amazing views and great service!
2016-09-21,1,This place sucks don't waste your time. The food sucks the service sucks even more. Our waiter was an older guy with glasses and could not even understand what he was saying. I don't know why from the min we sat down my wife and my daughter he had a problem with us. I asked him if there were any drink or food specials he said it's in the menus and walked away. And then watched us from behind like a hawk until we ordered. Mind you there only 3 other tables in the whole restaurant. Another table sat next us thy brought out some bread and butter for them and told them about there specials for the night like wtf??? The tables next to me were all white Iam Indian hmmmm I wonder if that had anything to do with that. And my check was a decent check for 2 adults and 1 month old baby 85.75Maybe they should not judge a book by its cover not all Indian are cheep and some do spend more money then others. For the 1st time in my life I tipped a tip that was fully deserved.Nicole respond to your comment. You could try to assure me this had nothing to do with race, but when the waiter gives the table next to u bread, specials, and friendly service, and gives your family (who's dining with a baby on her 1st birthday) terrible service and neglect, please be assured I will not return there to allow Alessandro the opportunity to spit in my food. When he came over halfway into us eating our meal and suggested we move our $600 stroller outside the restaurant (to clear the space for the non existent tables) we had had enough, asked for the check and left.
2016-09-18,2,Went here on my birthday and the place was super packed. Service was horrible, the food was mediocre... small portions, certain foods that they said were going to be on an appetizer arrived missing, the wait time was very long, and overall it was a bad experience. I had gone to blue eyes before and it was great, but this time around everything changed.
2016-09-17,4,Just had a great experience here, my family and I came in for a light dinner and the food was quite good. The service was also excellent. Our server, Christine, was prompt and wonderfully courteous and friendly, always anticipated our needs, and made delightful conversation with us throughout our wholly enjoyable meal. Christine was very attentive and efficient and made this dinner go from a 3-star to a 4! We had a lovely time, and that is due in no small part to the excellent service, especially Christine!
2016-09-10,2,Food was just ok... Had water leaking from the ceiling onto our food. Would not go back.
2016-09-09,2,Blue eyes has tremendous potential and I don't know if it was an off night but my experience did not go as planned. My boyfriend and I arrived at a busier hour on a Saturday night and were quickly seated. However, our waitress did not have her hair tied and in the food industry that is a HUGE no no. We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, Chicken Parm and a pizza. The glasses were not polished and when receiving wine service it is basic courtesy to present a clean glass. On the upside the food arrived promptly, yes. We were starving and had to get food in our systems before heading to NYC. The pizza was appealing on the eyes BUT I did not understand why the toppings were only placed on ONLY half of the pizza???? Regardless due to our hunger we did not complain and just ate continued to eat.. The toppings on the pizza were fresh but the dough was raw and floppy, it was a poor excuse of a pizza. The Chicken Parm lacked UMPH.. and there was no spoon for the spaghetti or a steak knife for the chicken. I understand this place is all about location, location, location but for the prices charged they should be up to par with their food.
2016-08-30,5,What a great place, we had lunch after enjoying some time on the water we went simple and  just had pizza, salad, beer and amazing view. Must try and must enjoy this magnificent view of the Hudson.
2016-08-09,3,Good service. Love the baked bread and the pizza is pretty good. The best part of this place is the atmosphere and amazing views. Great place to relax and enjoy the Manhattan skyline.
2016-08-05,1,This place is dust, the service was terrible and the food was mediocre. Tourist trap for the views, go eat at House of Que next door for some super good BBQ.
2016-07-15,5,My entire family came here last night for my grandpa's 80th birthday - 26 people! My mom arranged the entire dinner and the owners were so sweet and attentive both in the planning process and during the dinner. The waterfront location is gorgeous, you really can't get better views of the city, and the restaurant itself fits right in on the water's edge. We did a limited menu for our large group and everything came out hot and yummy! Cannot stress how kind the owners were, if you want to have an event or even just dinner they will take care of you! Thank you for helping us make my grandpa's birthday a great one!
2016-07-15,4,Cute little place with a Frank Sinatra theme and amazing views. I loved my pizza.
2016-07-11,2,Boyfriend and I came here for dessert after having lunch at House of Que because I was feeling gelato.. What a mistake! The fridge temp must have been set way too high because my gelato was a melted goo before I even got to pay for it. It melted all over my hands and I did not get to enjoy it at all. Plus it was such a miserly portion. So disappointed!
2016-07-08,3,2 of the 3 stars are based solely on location.  It doesn't get any better.  Views of the city and people watching.  We ordered the calamari and a pizza.  The calamari was great.  The pizza not so much.  We decided we would go back for calamari only.  Service was not the best but not the worst.
2016-07-08,3,It's situated at a beautiful place. The service was great. The food wasn't that great. I felt that the calamari could have been cooked a little more. The chicken parm I ordered was overcooked. In fact, it was slightly bitter. The Nutella hot chocolate was fantastic though. Which makes me think that the cook was having an off day. I'm not eager to go back, however I'm going to try it one more time before completely deleting that off my list.
2016-07-06,4,Ambiance: The restaurant sits on the Hoboken waterfront with gorgeous views of the Freedom Tower and NYC skyline. We went for a friend's birthday, with a group of 10 people, and sat outside as the weather was beautiful.Drinks: They have a nice selection of red and white wines with beer, Prosecco, and sangria as well. We really enjoyed the red sangria.Food: They have a great selection of antipasti, salads, pasta, entrees, and pizza. We ordered calamari and pizza to share as a table and most of us ordered the infamous linguine with manila clams. Unfortunately, they were out of clams and mussels so they were able to substitute for shrimp. The orecchiette with Italian sausage was also delicious. A few ordered the mezzelune spinach ravioli, which was smaller in portion but also very good.Definitely would recommend this place for big groups and outdoor seating!
2016-07-03,2,All the reviews on here raved about this place and we thought this would be a great place for my cousin's 30th birthday. We were quickly seated when we arrived and ordered within 10 minutes. After (approx) 1 hour and 35 minutes+ later our main course arrives. The waiter and waitress were very apologetic about the wait time -- the offered us wine and gelato while we waited, which was kind. When the food finally arrived it was underwhelming from the calamari rubbery texture to the brick oven (soggy) pizza. The spaghetti and meatball was decent but I get the same quality at my local pizzeria for the fraction of the price. I kind of expected better at a restaurant. Overall it was a "meh" experience. Food: 2 stars Ambiance: 3 stars Service/Wait time: 1.5 star Plus side: The view of the city is amazing but you don't need to sit at the restaurant for that.
2016-06-28,3,I'm torn writing this review. I have dined here three times and each time the experience is slightly different. I will echo what most others have noted, the view is spectacular. Even in the summer, there are spots in the shade that will keep you cool from the heat yet still offer Hudson River views. During my last visit, I ordered the chicken Parmesan entree and it was inedible. The dish was completely overwhelmed by salt. Even the pasta had an above normal salt quotient - guess it was the sauce? I still give this place 3 stars based off my first two visits, but I am not clamoring to head back anytime soon. Hopefully, it was just an off day.
2016-06-28,5,Came here with my girlfriend the other night, the  view its amazing and the place also. To start we had a frittura and the burrata, the burrata was nice and creamy and the frittura was cooked perfectly and it was topped with this amazing deep fried zucchini. For are main course we had 2 pizzas, the first one was the parma topped with fresh arugula and prosciutto and shaved parmigian cheese. The second pizza was the margherita the typical italian pizza, I haven't had a pizza that tested like these two since I went in italy 2 years ago in Naples. The people are very nice and the owner Alessandro was very friendly and talked to us about the place and food. As a dessert Alessandro surprised us with a small shaped nutella pizza that was amazing, overall the experience at Blueeyes was amazing, even the espresso was good!!! Definitely a place to visit  and eat always on the weekends!!
2016-06-24,3,Came here for an outdoor dinner with beautiful views of NYC. Looked online for waterfront restaurants and this showed up. The views were amazing, the service was outstanding. Our server was not the best, but everyone else who came to us to ask if everything was ok, to clean up and to bring our food was amazing. Our server seemed like she didn't necessarily want to be there; but that's ok.Pros: the staff, the view, outdoor seatingCons: HOLD THE SALT!!!!! We ordered calamari, a salad, and a pizza. The calamari was great! Loved it, amazing, no complaints. The salad came out and it was drowning in salt; I didn't see the salt but I could definitely taste it. My lips were literally in pain because of the amount of salt that was in the salad. And then came the pizza - OH MY GOD! Again, great pizza, would be so amazingly good tasting if it was not drowning in SALT!!! Why would someone add so much salt? Needless to say we were not able to finish the pizza, did take it to go, and 3 days later there is still leftovers.All in all it was alright. I would go back for a drink or calamari, but def not want their full of salt food!
2016-06-23,5,We held an event in Hoboken and picked blue eyes as Final Destination. It was Simply Delicious and for a party of 25 they were on time great quality and really Pleasant to have dinner with. Thank you blue eyes for making a company event a success!
2016-06-23,2,My boyfriend and I always look for new restaurants and we love eating in Hoboken in the summertime. I've seen good reviews for Blue Eyes so we decided to give it a try. Upon walking in there were plenty of tables open outside which is where I wanted to sit. I was approached by the "manager" (?) and he said it would just be a few minutes until we were seated. We ended up waiting 10 minutes to sit when there were tables available & already clean. Once seated, we looked over the menu. Prior to dining here my boyfriend & I looked at the menu online as we always do and the pictures on Yelp & on Instagram. It was totally different than the menu that was in front of us. We were very disappointed because he had his heart set on the Pasta al Forno. The waitress came to take our appetizer & drink order. We ended up going with the fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini appetizer. It was decent but only came with one piece of shrimp, what were we going to do with that. Not to mention, I thought all fried calamari came with a side of sauce, this one did not. We asked the waitress for the sauce but by the time we got it we were already almost done with the appetizer. I went on and ordered the Margarita Pizza and my boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle al ragu bolognese. His food ended up coming out ten minutes before mine did. How long does it take to cook a pizza in a pizza oven??? Aren't wood burning pizza ovens supposed to cook pizza in 90 seconds? Or at least I thought so. Once I received my pizza 10 minutes later, I realized there was a puddle of oil at the top. Literally a puddle. Once I picked up my first slice all I saw was oil dripping out of it. I didn't think you could go wrong with Margarita pizza but clearly you can.On to the next dish. My boyfriend did not enjoy his pasta at all. It looked like something I could make at home, mine would probably be better actually. I had to try it, it was very bland. He only ate a couple bites and ended up eating my pizza because it was there.I was very unhappy with the service and food at this restaurant. How hard is it to remember I wanted a straw? I will definitely not be going back. It's a shame because it would be a nice restaurant right on the water. Not only did our bill come out to $60, not including tip, we had to pay $15 to park for 1.5 hours. I wouldn't mind paying for parking if we got a good meal out of it.
2016-06-20,4,Excellent Capricciosa pizza! Perfect oysters. Quality ingredients. Phenomenal Manhattan skyline views. Nice neighborhood at Sinatra Park right on the Hudson.
2016-06-19,1,This place is terrible. Service is poor. They don't fill empty water glasses. Cappuccino was luke warm. Hot tea came out cold (so they microwaved it). Salads were mediocre. Pizza was the only thing that was any good. Most of the food does not taste fresh. The manager was not too nice. The most redeeming quality of the place is the view. I would not go back.
2016-06-19,4,If you're looking for amazing pizza and an incredible view, please visit Blue eyes. This is not the largest restaurant in hoboken by far, but the quality of food and service was great! The only reason I could not give 5 stars was because we had a party of 15 and although they met all of our expectations, the staff refused to align the tables in a more efficient manner. Other than that please visit this restaurant if you're looking for a bite to eat near the water!! Try their Margherita (Tomato sauce, mozzarella and fresh basil  )and/or Capricciosa (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, Italian ham, hot soppressata, mushrooms, artichoke, kalamata olives ) and of course they have fresh oysters on the half-shell!!
2016-06-18,3,The view is spectacular - 5 stars for location- and the manager staff is wonderful. That being said, the food is mediocre. Everything was just kind of okay but not great. Furthermore, our waitress was not adept at checking on our table and making sure the food arrived in a timely manner. We waited far too long, and half the table receive their dinner as the other half had already finished theirs. For the price, this is just unacceptable. The waitress did mention that they had a new head chef and a new menu, but it appears that they still may need to keep looking. Be aware that some of the older pictures on yelp, maybe of dishes that are no longer offered (such as chicken parm). For a restaurant named after Sinatra I also wish it had a more Sinatra vibe- more intimate, actual Sinatra music and maybe more pics of him or music theme items. I really wanted to love this place, and like I said, the view was amazing, but the food and the waitress service just left a lot to be desired.
2016-06-17,3,I'm surprised on such good reviews because I thought this place was very average without much flavor. Ordered the calamari, shrimp and zucchini- the zucchini was the best part and very tasty but you definitely need a side of marinara sauce to bring flavors to the others. Also had the Parma pizza (Parmesan, arugula, prosciutto)- it was ok but also need more flavor. Wine is average and limited options. Wonderful view of the city and Frank Sinatra park though.
2016-06-14,4,We came here for a work lunch and absolutely loved it! Amazing service & one of the most incredible views of NYC.We had a reservation, but we're all starving (15 of us), so we called ahead and ordered family platters of appetizers. We had the arugula salad, calamari & crab cakes. They were all delicious & basically available when we sat down. It was awesome.Then we shared the tri-pizza. We had the Parma, pepperoni & porcini. They were out of the porcini mushrooms, so we just had regular mushrooms. Pepperoni was too spicy for me, but the other two were great. I would probably order just the Parma next time. The pizza was huge & crust was cooked perfectly (not too burnt). Can't wait to come back!
2016-06-13,1,Horrible service from beginning to end. The waiter dropped a plate on my Moms arm, leaving a large bump. Had to wait for my Dad's dish which splatted on the ground, making a mess. French fries went into her drink as well and they never brought her a new one until we asked for it. While my mom was in the middle of cutting her steak, the waiter asked if she was done and proceeded to grab it. It was by far the worst experience at  any restaurant to date.
2016-06-10,4,My family stopped by this conveniently located joint along the waterfront as we watched the local Sinatra contest. This place is located at a great place for a beautiful view of the city and also for the contest grounds. Now onto the food!Let's start with the bread, kind of super hard and not too flavorful but I did like that it came with a chimichurri sauce. For starters we had the grilled octopus and eggplant parm. The grilled octopus had a great char while retaining a nice juicy texture plus nice flavor. The eggplant parm was amazing! Served in a hot casserole with melted parm and roasted eggplant wonderful flavor.Lowlights are the slow service because our waiter forgot our order but he sort of made amends by hooking us up with a free pizza. The pizza was a classic margherita and had good cheesiness. We also had the veal entrée but didn't get the chance to try it as we had to bounce.Given that the food was pretty good and the service, while slow, was friendly and coupled with the awesome view this gets 3.5 stars.
2016-06-07,1,Ruined my wife's birthday dinner. Brought the wrong appetizers. Had us waiting for an hour and half while every other table was served. Then brought the wrong entrees. No apologies. No free drinks. No additional appetizers. Nothing!! Worst experience of my entire Hoboken life of 10+ years!!! Don't go to Blue Eyes!!! Don't waste your money!!! Asshole chef!!! Asshole owner!!! Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my life and ruining my wife's birthday dinner!!!
2016-06-04,5,Smack dab in Sinatra Park, the outdoor seating gives you an incredible view of the city. Great for casual date night. I'd recommend summer Thursdays when they have live band performances. Who doesn't love good food and live music?Alessandro, the manager, is an absolute pleasure. He's always around greeting guests and making sure theyre getting the best service. Casual dining but their food is high quality. Some of my favorites are classics done right-- Fried Calamari Diavola and Pasta al Forno. For pizza, I'd highly, highly recommend the Tartufata. Topped with fresh buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto, mushrooms and truffle oil. This pie is so addicting you'll go back for seconds, thirds, forths. I've never had room left for desserts but will definitely be back to cross that off my list.
2016-05-25,1,Never before have I been compelled to write a review mid-meal, but the food here was sub par. The Good: The View! We sat outside on a beautiful, warm day.  I love living in NJ and being close to NYC.  As a life long New-Yorker... The skyline never fails to impress and excite me.  The staff was also very pleasant and accommodating. For example, we returned our Sangria because we were not aware of the lack of alcohol in the mix/restaurant.  The Bad:  There is no hard liquor.  Beer and wine?  Yes.  Liquor? Sadly, no. The Sangria was a sorry mix of wine and club soda.  The Ugly: The food was really bad.  The American Pizza tasted like a Sausage McMuffin with Egg from McDonald's, except not as good.  The Grilled Octopus was tasteless and soggy.  The best part of my meal was the bottled beer.  Were I ever to return, it would be to drink a $6 Peroni and soak in a Million Dollar view!Update to review in response to the response from the restaurant.  Hello Nicole R. Of Blue Eyes.  Thanks for your reply and explanation of the liquor license.  I should have been more clear in my critique.  I wish that we had been informed about your lack of liquor before ordering AND returning the Sangria.  Had we not returned the Sangria, we would have most definitely returned the octopus (which we only took one bite of).  It's been my experience that restaurants would ask one of two things when an uneaten entree is being cleared from a table.  1. Would you like that boxed up to go; or, 2. Was there something wrong with the dish. Neither was asked so I made the assumption that we weren't the first to not eat more than one bite and that even your wait staff knows that no one would want to take that tasteless crap home.
2016-05-21,4,We were strolling along the water and decided to stop in her an early dinner to take advantage of the beautiful day and the sun glistening on the water.The view is just spectacular.  Sitting outside in their patio area just cannot be beat.Usually restaurants with great views generally have terrible and subpar food, but I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious and fresh the food was!  We ordered grilled octopus (tenderly grilled, great flavor and perfect texture), burrata and various meats (burrata was rich and the meat were a great accompaniment), and fried calamari with diavolo sauce (calamari was done well, slightly chewy but still very good and the diavolo sauce was perfectly spicy).  Had their white and red sangria and both were well made.  However the white one is sweeter, lighter and perfect for a summer day.
2016-05-09,4,We came for dessert and were surprised they sat us outside per our request in such an elegant and waterview location perfectly situated to see the entire manhattan skyline: WOW!!  The view was amazing and I liked that it got the sea breeze...felt more natural that way and you felt like you were outside while under the tented area because no windows. We ordered the gelato which was a bit too sweet for both of us and very good but not great in terms of freshness and texture but a huge portion (we could not finish half). The service could not be more friendly, the view was spectacular and the Blue Moon beer bottle we shared was served cold in a Pilsner glass with a slice of orange as is recommended by the brewery.  Will definitely return for the menu/food items.  Cannot wait to try the pizza and the lasagna! Love the relaxed, friendly, warm ambiance! Afterward took continued our post-dinner stroll to take in the sunset over Manhattan on this beautiful Spring night.
2016-04-28,5,We stopped in this evening and were very happy we did. We started off with the mixed greens followed by pizza portofino and tiramisu for dessert. All washed down with house made sangria!  Life is good!   The food was great, the staff friendly and the view is pretty spectacular as well. It was a little cool to sit out this evening but they do have a nice patio area, maybe next time. Enjoyed everything about this and would definitely eat there again.
2016-04-24,3,I went there for lunch and I would say it wasn't bad but not as great as I thought it would be. Sure, the view is spectacular but I didn't find the menu to be very  much different from other restaurants. I ordered pesto pizza and gnocchi which was good but nothing over the top. I would probably come back for the view not as much for the food.
2016-04-18,5,Stopped for lunch in Hoboken on our way home from NYC.  It was a beautiful spring day so we sat outside, overlooking the water and the skyline.  As it was a weekday it was fairly quiet for lunch so we had our choice of seating.The staff and the food have a lot in common here...they are all authentically Italian and absolutely gorgeous!  Seriously, lovely service and an awesome line up of great food and wine.  We shared the antipasti plate and a margherita pizza with a carafe of house chianti.  Absolutely perfect and reasonably priced.  Thanks for a great time, we'll be back!
2016-04-17,1,The food and service are really bad here. The view is great, but the restaurant is so noisy, it is hard to appreciate it.   The food was almost inedible. I don't know how an Italian restaurant cannot even make a decent marinara sauce. During the hour-plus we waited for our food, the waitress came over three separate times to tell us they were out of something we had ordered. By the time she told us that something we had ordered a full hour earlier (and clearly should have been served a long time ago) was sold out, we were annoyed and finally complained and the management was incredibly rude. One member of our party sent his food back because it was ice cold and they still charged him for it. This place is huge rip off.   You can get great food in Hoboken. Don't waste your time or money here.
2016-04-16,5,Tonight was our first time at Blue Eyes and we loved it! Even though our outside dinner became a little colder than we planned the staff tried their best to make it as perfect as possible! We started with the house wine which was super affordable! Next came fried calamari diavlo and a special of mozzarella and prosciutto. The calamari was spicy but not overbearing. The mozzarella was homemade, fresh, and just perfect. My boyfriend had spaghetti and meatballs, his favorite, and despite the cold he basically licked his plate. I had the special Zupa de Pesce aka a massive plate of seafood in a delicious light tomato sauce. Delicious!!!!! It was the perfect meal! One particular note we were seated next to one of the rudest families ever! They treated the staff so poorly and complained about literally everything. Blue Eyes is a local landmark don't whine because you are cold, appreciate the view and the people!!! All in all Blue Eyes is a must go! Perfect date night!
2016-03-31,5,I loved this place! The food was delicious, and the owner was super friendly. I was eating alone and he came over to chat for like 15 minutes. He's dedicated to his staff and his customers. They are from Italy and have purposefully kept all of their recipes and ingredients Italian. Not to mention the beautiful view.
2016-03-27,5,Dive in to the delectable red sauce on the eggplant rolatine for the meatless amongst us,the calamari fra diavolo when plain, fried cal is too blah for the kind of day it is, and pizza, pizza,pizza, (all of it here), when you just don't know where to start and are still deciding... You can share it as an appetizer just like in a neighborhood trattoria back in the old country, 'cause this is our neighborhood and FINALLY some authentic and good Southern Italian fare has landed here. Thank God.The exceptional lasagna is designed to send you home with lunch for tomorrow and the green salad is like grandma's with the little bitty extras like marinated mushrooms, roasted redpeppers, olives and the teeniest slivers of red onion. The added bonus is NOT being killedwith TOO MUCH GARLIC so the taste of real food can show its teeth. Most of the wait staff speak Italian and are super welcoming. And yes, when it gets busy, you might wait an extra minute or two for a refill on your water, but just pretend you're in Italy on vacation insteadof at a stressful midtown Manhattan lunch on a Monday. Its worth the extra few minutes here.Leave the tip and take the connoli.This place is like eating at home for us Italians. We respect it. Enjoy it. Remember it.
2016-03-16,5,Best pizza ever eaten (even in italy)!!! Great Manhattan viene and friendly service !Please, renovate the restaurant because is Truly ugly... Your pizza deserves to be served in a nicer place!!
2016-03-08,5,Yum, I'm getting hungry just thinking about the pizza here!  My friends and I came here Friday night after work, mainly because it was near the PATH train.  The restaurant is on the water and has a great view of Manhattan.  The inside is pretty small for a restaurant, but it makes for a very intimate ambiance- this would be a perfect date spot.  We sat down and they immediately gave us bread with some type of flavored olive oil with an assortment of spices in it.  I'm not sure what it was, but it was some of the best olive oil I've had.  They didn't have a huge drink menu and seemed to be limited on their wine options, so we just ordered a bottle of pinot noir to split.   For food, we knew the pizza's were going to be filling so we skipped the appetizer and each ordered our own individual pizza.  I ordered the carrettiera which game with broccoli rabe, sausage and mozzarella.  Come hungry because the pizza's are filling!   The meal itself was wonderful- the dough on the pizza was really fluffy and light. We skipped dessert and ordered two espressos and one Nutella cappuccino.  I got to sample the cappuccino and you can really taste the Nutella!  If you like Nutella, the cappuccino is the way to go.  Wonderful service + delicious food = A great restaurant.
2016-03-04,5,Let me tell you I am Italian born and raised and after attempting few pizza places on Hoboken i gave up and for 5 years I've only went to Manhattan for true Italian pizza to places like Keste' Ribalta and 28. But this is as good as these places so no need to commute if Im craving pizza! The dough is tender you just have to take a slice hold it while slightly folding it and eat it! This is Neapolitan  pizza, soft thin base and tender crusty thick edges. The owner is nice and  welcoming. I recommend it!
2016-03-02,5,Best pizza I've ever eaten!  It is Napolatena ( heavy on sauce and, therefore, flavor) We ordered the Prosciutto. The sauce had heavenly flavor and the toppings were perfect.  The view of Manhattan is breathtaking.  The service was prompt and polite. Sinatra music is a plus.  I'm from Seattle and came all the way to Hoboken to try this restaurant.  It was worth the trip. Don't miss this experience.
2016-02-28,5,Loved the eggplant appetizer, glueten free pizza that my wife had. My chicken parmigiano was fantastic. She had house Chianti and said it was very. Good. Wait service by Luca made our day. Amazingly attentive and knowledgeable. We will return on our next stop @ the W hotel in Hoboken.
2016-02-19,5,We had a great experience from the get go. My brother has a food allergy which makes it very difficult to eat out. He's allergic to soy - most restaurants use soy oil because it's so cheap compare to other oils. We called to ask if they used soy and the lady took the time to check if they use any soy product. When we got there, reassured us that no soy was used. They made us the best pizza! I wanted 3 flavor on my pie and they went out of their way to accommodate me. They even have gluten free sought!Their wine list is very reasonably priced and they offer organic vines. So far, we found 2 restaurants in all of hoboken who will assure us their is no soy in their products. There are parking spots available on Sinatra drive near the restaurant and the view is spectacular. We surely will be back.
2016-02-17,2,Ordered take out from here- really really wanted to love it but was unfortunately very disappointed. Gnocchi was too salty and the penne vodka had no sauce on it- asked for some on the side, but  got a poorly cooked mix of pure cream, oil, and vodka instead. Thinking that take out from here is not the way to go!
2016-02-13,5,This restaurant was so amazing! My husband and I went to Italy for our honeymoon so we are always trying to find places that have more authentic Italian food . Blue eyes is our new go to spot after the meal we had here . We got a grilled calamari appetizer which was unbelievable . Cooked and seasoned Perfectly I could have just had that and been in heaven . The pizza is just like being in Southern Italy .   Each bite is mouth watering . I got the Zuppa di pesce - seafood was tender and in a light sauce I started drinking with my clam shells ! If you're into heavy Italian American this may not be your spot . If you're into fresh simple and delicious authentic Italian please go here ! You won't regret it !!!
2016-01-31,3,Great place with some set backsPros: Amazing food (as you can tell because they're always packed), extremely affordable (even though it's Hoboken), excellent service (staff members are well dressed, well-spoken, mannered and treats you like royalty), breathing view (very romantic), great pluses such as live entertainment on most weekends, fresh seafood bar, gelato stand, outdoor seating that's great for the summer, close by park to take a stroll in after dinnerCons: Don't take reservations, ONe indoor bathroom which let's admit it is not very accommodating (the other bathroom is a public outdoor park bathroom that you have to walk out of the restaurant for), can be loud majority of the time, if it's winter time you better bring a jacket if you are seated outside because there are no supplemental outdoor heating equipment to keep you warm the inside will be packed like sardines and the worst thing NO PARKING LOT (it took me 45 minutes to an hour to find a legal parking spot which was a long way from Blue Eyes and since they don't take reservations I had to wait an additional 30-45 minutes to be seated plus I've been there twice and ordered the same thing both times but I didn't receive the same quality of food both times, should really start to hand out a drink/bar menu (I didn't realize you guys served alcohol until the ending of my meal)I recommend to start taking reservation, attempt to provide a parking lot for your customers or atleast infor on where they can park because when I went there to find parking I had to ask everyone on the street where I'm allowed to park just so I don't get ticketed, expand your menu (the food there is delicious but it lacks more variety, hire more staff members if you plan to expand your restaurant (strongly advised because of the bathroom issues, packed environment PLUS this place is a money maker so expansion would provide more profit for the business), be consistent with meals for example meal preping [the first time I went there it was amazing, great presentation of food and it was a Thursday night, the second time is visited it was a Saturday afternoon you guys were packed, I orders the same thing as last time but the food was laid out differently it didn't have the same tastes associated with my previous experience and it looked very sloppy I understand that you guys must've been in a rush because your busy but your customers still have to pay the same price for the food and service whether it is more, same or less quality so I suggest you stress to your cooks and chefs the importance of consistency, should offer a BYOB policy as well.Over-all it was a great experience !
2016-01-21,4,My boyfriend & I came here for New Years Eve & we had a blast! The pizza was great, and our entrees were even better. Get the tiramisu!! Great service, fantastic views :)
2016-01-16,5,Love coming here! Food is excellent authentic Italian and the service is always great! Perfect location with great views - very happy to have this restaurant in Hoboken!
2016-01-08,4,We love this place. The food never disappoints, the drinks are delicious, and the owners are super friendly and accommodating. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that service can be a little slow, which can be a bit frustrating when my two kids start to approach melt-down mode. Other than that, this is a great addition to the Hoboken restaurant scene.
2016-01-06,5,Love this place!  I've been here 4 times.. The last time was for NYE and the service was excellent and food delicious.  It was also very well priced for that night.  It's also one of the best places to go to in Hoboken on a nice day/night because the view is wonderful.  The only issue is that this place only has one bathroom.  Hopefully with the construction they are doing this month, that will change.
2016-01-04,4,We arrived and the door was opened straight away for us, shown straight to our seats. Our waiter was a gentleman! Probably the best waiter we have every had in awhile! We got typical Italian dishes.. mine had alot of pasta so found it very heavy to eat (probably too much pasta but my husband finished it so he was happy).  Our waiter asked us if we had any suggestions, comments (positive or negative) and I loved that he asked that! We had a glass of wine and prosecco which was generous. The bill was very reasonable. We felt well looked after and really enjoy the atmosphere/music in the resturant! We would go back again! Enjoy! Plus lots of Italian people in resturant too!!
2016-01-04,5,Super cute place on the waterfront. Great views, good atmosphere. Got the Rivera (shrimp, argula, and parm cheese), its greatness in your mouth. Def a must visit!
2016-01-03,4,Delicious!! Had the mozzarella Carrozza for an appetizer...then my husband and I split the penne vodka and one of the red pizzas.... Absolutely delicious!  We will be back! The pasta was the favorite for me :)
2015-11-20,5,I've been here 4-5 times now and the food keeps getting better. Incredible service and super friendly staff all around. In a town that desperately needed a true Italian restaurant, Blue Eyes saved the day.
2015-11-08,4,Beautiful views of the Hudson river. The outdoor seating is nice but a little too congested. Food was good (nothing exceptional). But a good overall experience. Will be back here next summer.
2015-10-07,1,Beautiful view and great location!  My friend and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat and had the calamari and margarita pizza. The calamari was bland and fishy and the pizza was way undercooked....very doughy....borderline raw. We expressed this to the owner and they offered to buy us a drink which we declined since we were driving, and would you believe they still charged us for the pizza which we left half of!  So they were willing to buy us $25 worth of drinks but not willing to remove a $15 pizza. Doesn't make sense. Also, in my friends review, they claim they explained the sogginess due to using fresh mozzarella. First off, they NEVER explained anything...especially related to that, and I order Neapolitan pizza made with fresh mozzarella all of the time and it is not served undercooked. We only had a small sampling of the food, so if you do decide to go, I hope you have a better experience!
2015-10-04,1,The only thing good about this place is the view. The pizza was extremely soggy and the calamari was very bland. When we brought this to two male staff member's attention, they offered us a round of drinks but we told them we were not drinking.  Nothing further was done for the poorly prepared food and no explanation was provided. This experience has turned me off from pizza for a while. We were looking forward to the quality buffalo mozzarella pizza that we normal get at other restaurants.  Be forewarned!
2015-09-27,2,The view here is amazing the food was not bad however you could do it at your house lol if you have a little Italian in you. Good service nice people a place to hang out.
2015-09-24,5,Had a wonderful dinner here with my family. We arrived at 7:30pm and was seated right away. The staff were very attentive. For starters, we had fried calamari, crispy on the outside and I didn't even need the sauce.  Then they brought the 4 formaggi pizza, and aside from being a little pricey, it was one of the best pizzas I ever had. Their combo of different  cheeses on top of thin crust was very delicious! I then had the entree of eggplant rollatini with spaghetti, served in 2 separate plates. I devoured the entire dish in one sitting. My family couldn't even get pass half of their food because they were full. I still had room for the cassata and bomba, and wow! It was Lambada dessert in my mouth! My family might not have finished their entrees but they sure licked, clean, the dessert plates. I also have to mention their Nutella Cappucino, and man, I was strucked how good it was! I wish they could've served it in a mug and not a tea cup. Save the best for last, the view from the restaurant was amazing. The water view and skyline of NYC was breathing. We took so many photos in front of the restaurant and ended the night with a big happy face!
2015-09-16,1,The food and service were just bad. Our server was nice, but it took him forever to take our order, I had to ask for refills on our drinks, and had to ask for our check. Additionally, it took an unacceptable amount of time for our entree to come out, and all we ordered was a pizza to share. The table next to us, a party of 8, came in after we had already placed our order, all ordered pizza, and received their pizza significantly before us (a party of 2). We had the same waiter. We ordered calamari and a margherita pizza. The calamari was soggy and overpriced. Our pizza was also soggy, and watery. It has become a running joke for my boyfriend to suggest we go to dinner here when we are trying to decide where to eat. Will not be back.
2015-09-09,5,Blue Eyes was such a find. Of course the view is spectacular but the food and the service are just as spectacular. We were a large party and our server was so great! Right there when we needed her and so friendly. We had the 4 cheese pizza, a gluten free pizza with sausage and broccoli rabe, calzones, muscles, eggplant parmesan dinner and panini, salads, etc. I think we ordered half the menu. The live music was great but a little loud. Other than that our evening was perfect. We had a fantastic time at Blue Eyes and will most definitely be back!
2015-09-07,4,We had dinner here on Labor Day. Sitting on the patio was delightful. The restaurant is located right on the Hudson River overlooking Manhattan. The service was good and the food was delicious. I had a house salad to start - it was big enough for 2 people. For dinner I had the lasagna and my daughter had the spaghetti. While we were enjoying our dessert there was a live band playing music. I would definitely recommend this place!
2015-09-07,3,3.5 stars- Great view, good food but this place feels very touristy.Came here LDW with my boyfriend and another couple. We were told the wait for outside would be 45 minutes so we took a table inside. Soon afterwards we noticed that there were, in fact, two open tables outside which remained unoccupied the entire time we were there. We definitely could've sat outside but whatever. I asked our server for butter to go with the table bread and she said "it will take me 20 minutes to find it in the kitchen." Alright, so I guess that settles that then. Everyone liked their food (spaghetti and meatballs, penne vodka, salmon) but with so many other great options in Hoboken, I don't know if I'd choose to go again.
2015-09-03,5,Wonderful service and pleasant atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and the food and drinks are delicious! I had the chicken salad and also have tried their pizzas.
2015-08-27,5,I love this place! I went last night for the first time and I was blown away by the food, service, and views. Perfect little spot. Our waiter's name was Cesar and we loved him. He was super sweet and attentive. My only thing is that I wished I had saved room for the Nutella Pizza. I can't wait to come back here again to eat.
2015-08-26,1,Went with a coworker for lunch today. We will not be going back. The waiter was pleasant but the service was terrible. First of all, it seems that there were about 7 people working the floor but each seemed to have their own responsibility and only one of the 7 waited on tables. It took forever to have our order taken, and even before it was, they were trying to give us someone else's food. They tried to give my salad to the table next to us. It just seemed to be hectic (even though the place was not crowded).I ordered a lunch special which comes with soup or salad. When I asked what soups they had, the waiter shook his head and said "Oh, not today". So salad it was. My coworker ordered lasagna. It was on the menu for $18. She knew it was pricey for lunch but hadn't had lasagna in a while and was craving it. When it came, it was a regular size dinner plate filled with marinara with a tiny rectangle of lasagna. She questioned the fact that it was so small and was told that, yes, that was what she ordered. When she complained again about the fact that it was $18, the waiter "investigated" in the kitchen and she was finally told that it was because it's a lunch portion and not a dinner. Needless to say, we asked to be charged a lunch price for the lunch portion. Luckily, we were. The pasta was way too al dente. She did not enjoy it at all. Silly complaint and I know that there are some (not many) places that do this but I'm mentioning it anyway. I am a soda drinker. No free refills at Blue Eyes. I could easily run up a double digit tab in sodas, which I feel is crazy when it's out of the tap.With bad service and bad food that is way overpriced, we will sadly not be visiting Blue Eyes again. Maybe we hit it on a bad day but, unfortunately, first impressions are important.
2015-08-24,5,I love everything about this place! I heard a lot of good things when it first opened so I had to give it a try. The location is perfect, overlooking the city. I've been there twice already and the food is absolutely excellent!! Best pizza I've had in my life. I had the prosciutto porcini truffle oil pizza the second time I went and it was to die for. The Nutella pizza is also a must when dining here. You really can go wrong with anything else you order but those two were my favorite. I also tried the nutella cappuccino which was incredible. The salmon dish and the clams oreginato were also really tasty. Above all the service was top notch! Very accommodating, good people. Really like the manager. Everytime I've gone there he always says hello and comes around to ask how everything is. Definitely will be back soon!
2015-08-23,5,5 stars across the board. The service was prompt and attentive. The meal was delicious. If not for the one of a kind view of manhattan, we would have thought we were eating a meal in Italy. We will definitely be returning.
2015-08-20,4,Had a great time there and enjoyed the view! Just plan on spending some money because it is pretty expensive. The serving sizes weren't huge either one of those pizza's with toppings is $19 and it looks like a personal pie when you get it. Plain pizza is $16 I believe.  BUT I do have to say it was delicious. It all depends on how much money you're looking to spend. Location also ups the price a bit. My date and I ordered their appetizer sampler ( I forget the name), Penne Vodka, and Prosciutto Pizza. The vodka sauce was nice and light. The appetizer was pretty good too. The only thing that actually really annoyed me was that they said they couldn't put vodka sauce on the prosciutto pizza instead of tomato sauce. Now I'm not sure if the pizza was premade or if the pizza guy just didn't know how to do it but I didn't ask. Hopefully he wasn't just being lazy because there was only one other couple in the place but honestly it didn't matter because the pizza really was delicious. Just expensive. That was my only major complaint of the place. Food was great, service great, view was great. If you wanna spend some money and enjoy your meal this is a great spot to eat!
2015-08-19,3,The setting is amazing and the staff was very attentive and helpful. We ordered an excellent specialty pizza, along with a Caprese salad, which featured the saddest tomato slices I've ever seen - pale, grainy, flavorless, and clearly from a refrigerator. It would be great if they could use fresher ingredients (fresh, local tomatoes are really easy to find in NJ in August)  for the veggie-focused plates. No one wants to pay $12.50 for 4 slices of inedible tomato.
2015-08-12,5,Great place with an amazing view , good for lunch dinner or having some drinks , first time here and we loved it , staff very friendly and food delicious good portions as well and of course you have " the view " .
2015-08-10,2,I was expecting a great meal after reading yelp and seeing pictures. Nope. We ordered pizza, calzone, penne w butter kids meal, salmon and blue eyes sweetness. Ugh. We waited 30 min to have our order taken. Penne was good. My daughter ate every bite. Pizza tasted good but was soupy. If you lifted it up all slid off. Calzone was good but in a puddle. We were doing ok and trying to salvage the meal but then it took 25 min after all was eaten for the sweetness to come out. We ordered it with our entrees. Server was handsome but not helpful or responsive. The sweetness was such a flop. Pizza crust with Nutella. There were 8 chunks of banana. 2 strawberry slivers. Just so stupid to wait for that!!! This is like a regular size pizza and like two slices had toppings??!! We won't go again. We sat down at 6:30 and begged for our check at 8 pm. At least the penne came out first and somewhat quickly. We also had drinks. Total was $116.   ugh.  Maybe it all felt longer bc we had a 3 year old? The view is nice. The weather was perfect.
2015-08-07,5,The food was excellent including dessert! The service was attentive and friendly. The view is priceless!
2015-08-03,3,This place has potential but we were disappointed.  We started with the appetizer sampler.  The rice balls were missing, and we got some unidentifiable other fried things.  The chef didn't tell the waitress, so she couldn't tell us.  I understand that restaurants run out of things, but to substitute without warning is not acceptable.  The menu lists an arugula salad.  When I asked if the salad was just arugula, the waitress said that the ingredients varied, but that it included red onions and roasted peppers and sometimes mushrooms, but she didn't know what was going to be in it that day.  Then our mains arrived, well, someone's entrees arrived--not ours.  The waitress was nice about it, but after the appetizer mishap, we really wanted what we ordered.  I had gotten the arugula salad, so I wasn't really sure what I had ordered.  Turned out that they day the salad had mushrooms in it--the canned variety.  Maybe it's me, but when I order a salad for $9, I don't expect to get ingredients from a can.  We also ordered the gnocchi.  It was actually very tasty, and the portion was very large.  That's pretty much the only thing I can compliment.
2015-08-01,4,Very nice place to dine on the hudson across from nyc with views. Nice for a date or family. Everything is fresh and ingredients imported from Italy. Pizza is thin crusted with creative and tasty toppings. Music and entertainment out front in amphitheater at times. Definitely worth a try. Owners and staff are nice people.
2015-08-01,5,Tried this place w/ my fiancé and bridesmaid last night. We didn't plan on eating but we're very curious so he ordered the spaghetti w/ meatballs and our lovely waitress suggested the sampler appetizer (can't remember the name). Everything was amazing - the pasta was al dente like I like it and the meatballs were flavorful! They aren't allowed to serve liquor next to the water but their beer selection is pretty good and they have lots of yummy + fun champagne drink options. I ordered a bottle of wine and the brought it over in the silver chiller which was a perfect touch. The staff is incredibly attentive, beyond accommodating and friendly! Bring a date or come for a family outing. Maybe call ahead on weekends for table availability because the place is a little small. But there was a larger group next to us.
2015-07-27,5,Started with the antipasto freddo, it had great proscuitto di parma, the group i was with wanted pasta so we asked for a family style portion of their special - lobster with cherry tomatoes and cream sauce. It was really great and flavorful. The view was great and we even caught the show in front. Service was on point, def will be back.
2015-07-27,1,The location is perfect but that's where it ends.  The pasta for my kid was filled with water, like they didn't drain the pasta...gross, and it had a meatball as hard as a cement brick.  The fried calamari was so big that it felt like I was eating rubber. The sauce for the calamari was tasteless and the soda was watery.  It was disgusting and I was disappointed, especially since I was born and raised in this town.  Let me not forget to mention that it took the waitress over 10 minutes to bring the check to me and there was only 4 other tables occupied.  I'll never EVER go back.
2015-07-24,2,It was great service until me and my friend discovered there was a thumb tack in the penne alla vodka we were sharing! We told the waiter and he reacted as though we couldn't have done great damage if one of us were to swallow it. When we told him that he took away the two slices left from our margarita pie(which was so delicious), we wanted to bring those slices home with us and he took them without even asking if we were done or wanted them wrapped. He came back out after a couple of minutes and let us know that he took the pasta off of our bill because of the thumb tack.The thumb tack pasta was ok tasting(yes we ate a good amount before realizing). And the pizza was really great. Because of the location(on the water) and the pizza I might actually be back even after the thumb tack incident.
2015-07-18,1,The food is not good. Service was very slow. The chicken parm was undercooked. The penne vodka was white instead of pink and tasted like mayonnaise. We asked for lasagna and got eggplant and the server insisted we were wrong. I never write reviews but thought it was so bad I needed to say something.
2015-07-16,5,We came by twice in one weekend it was so good! My husband and I had the mozzarella caprese and one of the specialty pizzas (I can't remember which one it had mushrooms). Everything was absolutely incredible! The staff was super sweet, the very handsome manager/owner came by to check on us both days and was very warm and inviting. They also give you a starter of bread with some sun dried tomato/ olive oil dip which is to die for. I highly recommended this place to anyone who wants a chill and delicious meal in a gorgeous location.
2015-07-13,1,Didn't actually get into this place. Called ahead and the person who answered the phone said the wait was roughly a half hour. 10 minutes later when my party arrived the guy at the door said it would be "hours" before we were seated. He was extremely smug, dismissive and non apologetic. I get there is nothing he can do at that point but at least pretend to care. If this place didn't have the amazing view I'm sure it would fail. An italian restaurant in Hoboken? How original.
2015-07-11,1,This was honestly the worst meal I have had in Hoboken...by far!  We ordered the caprese salad - completely flavorless.  The clams oreganata looked like something that was frozen from Costco and reheated at the resturant.  The worst part was actually the pizza - which is pretty hard to screw up.  The pie was undercooked - doughy and with literally one slice of sopresatta.  We couldn't even finish it - it really was that bad.  I have never before written a review but just had to make sure I shared as I am actually upset we gave them our money.
2015-07-09,5,Absolutely amazing, our server was Matteo a native of Italy. I must say, whether it was the service or the food everything was excellent. The owner came to me and my date for that day with such a warm and welcoming vibe. You know this place is amazing when the staff treats you like family. Will I come back here? Absolutely, I plan to take all my dates here. Yes. All of them. Am I womanizer? Maybe, but that's not the point. Blue Eyes in my opinion is hobokens gem to authentic Italian Cuisine. *drops mic*
2015-07-07,4,Nice, authentic, pizza and the friendliest service and owners! Not to speak of the unmatched view of NYC with plenty of outdoor seating. Lucky me, it's right around the corner! :)
2015-07-02,4,Got invited by my daughter's soccer coach to watch the US vs China World Cup game. Copa America was also playing on another screen (Argentina vs Columbia) Bonus!The location and views are excellent - a really nice space with lots of outdoor seating. The menu is simple which is good - we had pizza and some on the table had the grilled salmon. Washed down with a couple of beers and it was a perfect place to hang out with friends and watch the games.
2015-07-01,4,The ambiance and food were great. We had a great view of the NYC skyline and a live band outside while we munched on some delicious calamari, shrimp and margherita pizza pies!.I have to say, the staff is really friendly and attentive and their Blue Eyes cocktail is really good, especially if you like sweet drinks! :)
2015-07-01,5,Tried it for lunch the food and prices were great , and great NYC views , the staff was friendly and very nice to my daughter, will definitely be back.
2015-06-29,4,Attended a Yelp event so was unable to rate on value for money as the food was provided.Solid 4.5 stars.  Although I generally do not eat a lot of pizza or pasta, their food was excellent.  The wood-fired oven pizza bases were thin, with a generous amount of topping.  Their drink selection lets them down a little but the do have Brooklyn Lager by the bottle, which was some consolation.  The service was fast and friendly but one of the major attractions is the venue.  Blue Eyes is right on the Hudson river, with amazing evening views across to NYC.It was my first time in Hoboken and Blue Eyes comes highly recommended!
2015-06-26,2,Food ok. Staff seem very young and inexperienced for sure. Def needs a restaurant makeover - tables and chairs look super cheap...too bad, because the location is awesome...won't be back
2015-06-26,5,I am not usually in Hoboken but drove over to pick up something from a friend. It was a beautiful summer evening so we decided we wanted to eat with a view of the Hudson river. Strolling in the Hudson River Park on the Hoboken side, we stumbled on Blue Eyes and were able to sit outside.The service was phenomenal -- very friendly staff and the Italian owner from Sicily ensures each guests is having a great time. We had Shrimp cocktails to share -- which were meaty, large and fresh. My sister had the chicken park which was hearty, large portion and delicious. My mom and I shared the Prosciutto di Parma, which was tasty and we weren't able to finish it so I had leftovers for Monday's lunch!Also, if you're just strolling along the waterfront, Blue Eyes has a nice Gelato Bar where you could have a sweet treat on a summer event. Overall, this was a very pleasant experience.
2015-06-22,4,4.5 The view is of course beautiful and they really made the most of the outdoor seating. We ordered the caprese salad which is usually my favorite dish. It was the least favorite of all the dishes we got - tomatoes were unripe, not enough balsamic vinaigrette. The mozz was great. Next we got calamari Diavlo which was fantastic! Nice spice, very little breading and the calamari was large and amazing! Next was the Tartufata pizza which had mushrooms truffle large slices of cheese and prosciutto. Thin crust - amazing!! Lastly we got the Nutella pizza - how could we not!?! It was fantastic but very large. We took it home and ate it all weekend. Service was slow but with a view like that we didn't mind,
2015-06-20,2,My family and I recently had lunch at Blue Eyes.  Per the reviews we thought it would be much nicer but this is a very casual setting.  We had cheese ravioli, chicken parmesan, grilled chicken, gnocchi and the penne vodka.  The Gnocchi was good and probably the best out of all the meals.  The chicken parmesan was over cooked and way too crispy.  The side of pasta on both the chicken parm and the grilled chicken was over cooked and mushy.  The cheese ravioli was luke warm.  The penne vodka was just okay.  I was not overly impressed and wouldn't go out of my way to visit again for anything other than the view and you can get that at other places.  Great spot but food could be way better.
2015-06-15,4,This place is an awesome addition to town!  Just the kind of gem Hoboken needed.  Went yesterday and started off with the Seafood Salad, which was awesome, then Prosciutto and Arugula pizza.  The dough was light and airy and the pizza was fantastic.  The ambiance couldn't be better as we sat outside and overlooked the Hudson while watching some live performers in Sinatra Park singing some of Frankie's classics.  The man who sat us at our table was polite, attentive and got us a table surprisingly quick.  All the servers and staff were authentic Italians which brought the whole experience together for a nice touch.  If you're looking to enjoy some good food and a fantastic view while you dine, check this place out.  Can't wait to go back!
2015-06-14,5,Right on the water. There isn't a better place in Hoboken to enjoy a glass of wine and take in the amazing view of the city. The pizza is amazing as well.
2015-06-12,1,Worst service ever. There were 2 adults one child.  It took about 20 mins for the food.  Then they just brought the meat and 15 mins later after telling 3 servers the side of pasta was missing and watching them not go to the kitchen. The main meat dish was already cold. They refused to comp or discount the meal but offered a dessert. So no meal but free pastry how long will that take. *Update after another wait they comped the cold entree. I wanted to like the place. It's an excellent location.
2015-06-12,5,We came for the opening night, the Saturday following open night, Mother's Day  and have been back a number of times since. It's a wonderful family run venue that's extremely authentic and very accommodating. The complimentary stone baked bread is delicious is to die for! Warm, fresh and rare to find in Hoboken. We have sampled a few things in the menu and would definitely recommend the food. The portions are not only generous but very flavoursome. To top it off they have the best WTC views. One NOT to miss!
2015-06-12,3,Walked by here a few times and was waiting for it to finally open.  Went with my fiance last night and thought it was a solid italian meal.  We split the Quatro Formaggi pizza, which had an overpowering taste of Gorgonzola, but it was still okay.  We also split the spaghetti and meatballs which was uninspired.  The third star comes from the location and the view.  I thought it was also pretty overpriced for what we got.  Came out to over $100 for 2 people just getting a salad, pizza, pasta and a glass of wine or two.  Would recommend it, but don't know how often I will be going back.
2015-06-09,1,Don't waste your money - this place won't last long. My boyfriend & I had a TERRIBLE experience here. I wanted to like it so badly because the location and ambiance are so charming. Unfortunately, the food is generally tasteless and the service, though friendly, was so awful that I couldn't help but laugh at one point. We were greeted by a very nice man, who I believe is the owner, who sat us quickly - it was downhill from there. No one gave us menus, three different servers came over with food/drinks we didn't even order...STILL no one gave us menus...and then the server cleaning the table next to us sprayed cleaning solution all over us (he was super apologetic, but this should have been an instant warning sign). Finally, we were given menus and placed our orders. When the food arrived, it was cold and basically had no flavor at all. Throughout the meal, confused-looking servers continued to come outside and try to give us food and beverages that were not ours. Meanwhile, I continued to ask for our server so I could send back the terrible food. I finally flagged someone down, who was very apologetic when I explained that the food was awful. Because we'd been waiting for so long at that point, I wasn't even hungry anymore and just asked for the check. After TWENTY MINUTES and reminding FIVE separate servers, we STILL didn't have our check and a server decided to bring out a piece of chocolate cake "compliments of the house". While this was a nice gesture, we explained that we'd been trying to leave for almost half an hour at this point and really didn't want any cake - we just wanted to get the heck out of there! FINALLY, our check was brought to the table and the owner/manager came out to say he was "sorry for being nice"....not a great touch when you've royally screwed up a local's experience at your place of business, my friend.All in all...this was one of the most ridiculous and horrendous dining experiences I've ever had, and I would warn (and have warned!) anyone I know not to even bother with it. Hopefully the restaurant that takes over this location one day will have better luck, because I doubt this place will be around long with this kind of reputation forming.
2015-06-04,3,Went for lunch with colleagues. We sat outside to enjoy the weather and view. Food was pretty good. Our order was pizza, salad and panini. The pizza was great for eat-in, got a bit soggy after sitting for awhile so take out maybe tricky. Salad was good. Panini was ok because bread was too crispy and I don't eat meat so they added mutz. Flavor was good but it was a bit lacking in the center. Suggestions: There should be at least one veggie option for panini. Also, option of grilled salmon to add to salad would be good for pescetarians. Biggest thing is that it's a bit pricy for lunch so maybe consider adding lunch specials to the menu. That would get me back there again for sure. Service was awesome, friendly & attentive.
2015-06-03,5,I have been here 3 times sincer they opened and the experience is always unique and wonderful!Great authentic italian pizza, all freshly cooked food, great service and their gelato is a great way to end a meal. And the owners are always there to greet you. I'll be back with friends this week...and by the way, the view of Manhattan isn't so bad! Its breathtaking...
2015-06-02,5,Excellent restaurant Cafe. I ate here last Friday along with my husband and another couple. we were 10 min late to our reservation time, but they say us right away. This restaurant was busy but not overwhelmingly full. We had a lovely table outside in their wrap around little seating area, overlooking the water. The location to this restaurant is definitely  prime location. Right on the water next to the water promenade. You can see the lights, the NYC buildings and everything else. The food is also excellent. We had the Calamari, which were honestly my least favorite, we also had the eggplant parm which was a HUGE portion, deff shareable. And also a pizza which the serves was nice enough to let us split it with separate toppings. Loved that:! Pizza was for two people. Really good crust and fresh topics. wine was excellent too. Their Proseco is very good and reasonably priced.  A whole bottle for 30$. I would deff come back here, especially since the service is amazing. The girl we had brought everything super fast, and was very attentive and constantly asking us if everything was ok. Some people may not like it, but we loved the attention;).
2015-05-30,1,Food was so so. The gnocchi was doughy and the penne alla vodka was mediocre. Also had clams oreganata which were so so as well. Could have just been our waiter but we ordered apps and he ended up bringing them out with our main courses even when we mentioned it to him. My wife and I were looking forward to coming there after walking by it last week.  View is obviously great being right on the water. I might try it again but was not impressed overall.
2015-05-27,3,For the view on the Hoboken Waterfront- 5 stars.  It was such a nice afternoon we sat outside under the awning for lunch.  Our server, Luca was quite charming, an old school Sicilian. Pulling out the chairs for both my wife and I, addressing us as Signore and Signora. For our order, we came up with two types of Napolitano pies which are about the size of a dinner plate.  Still coming in 8 slices, enough to satisfy us plus leave leftovers. The first pie was the Prosciutto Pie, Prosciutto di Parma, shaved parmigiano cheese and arugula.  Our next pie was the Carrettiera, broccoli rabe, sausage and buffalo mozzarella.   Now I will admit I am a bit of a pizza snob so to me the pies were ok.  But, of the two I enjoyed the Prosciutto better.  I thought the Carretiera was a little under cooked for my taste.   As you picked it up and folded it wasn't firm.  Perhaps another couple of minutes in the oven would have made the difference. Will most definitely come back and try their assortment of pasta dishes and delicious looking gelato which were on display at the front door.
2015-05-24,5,It was a warm summer day and we were looking for something easy and breezy on the waterfront. Enter Blue Eyes. Staff was so friendly and welcoming, food was beyond delicious. 2 of the 3 parties are serious foodies and all parties approved! Pizza was the best we have had in Hoboken, and we have lived here for 5+ years. Only improvement I would suggest would be thicker pizza sauce on the pizza. That being said it was still delicious!
2015-05-17,5,Good food, service and wine ! Wonderful location with a perfect view of NYC. Great addition to Hoboken.
2015-05-15,5,Blue Eyes, what can I say? I was a bit skeptical after reading a few of the most intricate reviews. I have to say the reviews were way harsh to a business that just started! I went this past Saturday with a couple friends and had a couple different dishes from the menu, it was very authentic! My friends and I enjoyed it very much, even the ambiance was nice,the service was good and on top of it all the view was lovely! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive place to go out and have a good time by the waterfront.
2015-05-12,5,Finally a REAL restaurant with great people & delicious Italian Food in this terrific location on the Hudson with magnificent city views & all at reasonable prices. Who could ask for more. Wood Burning Oven Pizza, wine & beer and Italian music in the background along with from Italy Italian owners like Alessandro, & waiter Gennero all go to transport you to The Isle of Capri or some other Mediterranean town. Bravo!
2015-05-12,1,I was so disappointed with this place.. I was super excited to go and eat there, the view is perfect.. It's close to my house.. I haven't had Italian in awhile.. Such a let down. The server didn't really know how to answer my food questions, that's a bad sign.  I've been in the restaurant business for years, servers should know the menu inside and out. The menu is short, no excuses. When I sat they sent out bread and a flavored oil to dip. The bread was hot. I enjoyed it. The dipping oil however was just basically oil. The stuff at the bottom wasn't really easy to get to as it was at the bottom of a small ramekin. I feel like the oil and stuff was just mixed together because the oil didn't really hold the taste of what was in there. That should be re worked abit. Love the idea though!The salad was good.. I found Afew pieces of brown lettuce but it happens.. That wasn't that bad. Although I was basically the only person there so maybe they could have checked it abit better.. I enjoyed the dressing. Was a basic balsamic, seasoned well. Maybe they could add abit more of the cucumber and tomato and not cut it so small. Hard to grab with the fork. My calamari had 3 pieces of cartilage in it. THREE. Probably more but I stopped eating it after that.. Disgusting. The sauce for the calamari was ok, bland. Could use some spice it more salt. My spaghetti was raw. I was told its "al dente" no. It was raw, I'm a professional chef, so I know.. However you don't have to be a professional to know when you chew your pasta and it literally crunches in your mouth, it's raw. Al dente is abit of a bite, not a literal crunch. It needed atleast another two Minutes in the boiling water. The meatballs were cold and super small.. Again, I'm the only one there besides one other table.. Ridiculous. I couldn't order dessert because frankly I didn't eat much so I feel as though I didn't deserve dessert. Plus I was scared of how that would be. No one came for about 15 minutes so I walked into the "house" to pay. Got upto the front by the register and a man who I believe is the owner or one of the owners "greeted" me with "yea?"  So I replied "hello, do I pay here?" And his response was "pay for what?" So I replied "for my meal that I didn't eat because it was horrible"He walked away. My server ran over, she was nice. Didn't change me for the calamari that I almost choked on so that was good.. As I walked out I saw a table that had pizza, maybe I'll try that before I write this place off for good but still unsure if I'll return. Too bad. I hope it's just because they're new and getting the hang of things. Cold food/plates I can deal with but Cartilage in my calamari, that's a deal breaker for me.
2015-05-10,3,This place is so cute and in a great location. We sat outside so we had a nice view of the city. It took a while for our waiter to greet us. Once the manager noticed we'd been waiting a while he brought the waiter over immediately & apologized for the delay. After that both the manager and our waiter were very attentive. I ordered the eggplant rollitini which came with spaghetti and my friends both got the grilled salmon with a side Caesar. My eggplant was good their salmon though was pretty bland. Their complaint was that there was no real seasoning to the fish. They were a bit disappointed. The manager came over and offered to buy us dessert. We got the the Nutella pizza which was phenomenal. I definitely need to come back to try the pizza and gelato.
2015-05-10,3,Nice place but it still has a lot of work to do with regard to service and quality of food. This was a tough one to rate since different aspects of my visit varied in ratings from 2-5, so I settled on a 3 because overall, it was just ok. Highlights are the view and pleasant people that work there, lowlights are the food and the organization of service, both which can be fixed in time. Food: My biggest source of disappointment. It started off well with some flat bread and dipping oil, but then it was all downhill. My colleague's salmon was good and salad was very average, mostly lettuce, 1 piece of cucumber, and 1 cherry tomato. My artichoke soup was overly creamy for a summer soup though had a nice flavor but the worst of it all was the eggplant parmesan. Woof! It looked like they served me a TV dinner from the 60's and boy george it tasted even worse than it looked. The eggplant was not cooked and the sauce is horrendous. Sinatra would not like that something so gross was served at a place with his namesake. I think what made it worse was when I expressed my dislike at the end, they gave me a whole new order to take home - who does that! It wasn't good the first time, why would I want more! I gave it to my colleague to eat for dinner and he came in the next day saying how it was the grossest thing he has ever eaten! Blue Eyes - please nix this or change it up. Ambiance: I have to say, its a little odd the way they have chosen to decorate the place. I love the style, but doesn't seem to fit with the "Sinatraesque/Italian" vibe that they are going for. You picking up what I am putting down? When I looked at the inside I pictured swanky waterfront wine bar. Maybe they have set it up as a backup plan in case the Italian thing doesn't work out, it'll be easier to re-open. The view though, that is spectacular. Service: Our waiter was the sweetest guy. Very pleasant which added to the experience. Except, not the sharpest tool. Perhaps this was his first gig as a waiter. We ordered the lunch special which was supposed to start with soup or salad. My soup came at the same time as my entree and my colleague got nothing. For about 5 minutes. Then came his entree, but no salad. Asked for that 3 times before it came. Each time he was nice about it, but a bit odd when there are few people at the restaurant (4 tables of people). At the end when he asked how our food was and I had expressed my disappointment he was all apologetic and offered to get me more. I declined and he apologized numerous times. Then he sent out the manager and he also offered me more food. Again I declined, really just wanted to give them feedback. They were very sweet and brought out some ice cream for my colleague and I, in a shared dish with 2 spoons. Good thing I know my colleague well lol.I can feel ok recommending this place because really you know you are going for the view and perhaps some average food. Then its ok!
2015-05-08,3,We came here last night just to check out the food.The view is nice since its right by the water.My one complaint is the wait after being seated, three different people were pointing and we heard them discussing who should serve us etc.. at least 15 minutes before they came over to our table and it was not packed at all.Service:Minus the initial wait our server was very good and we received our food promptly.Food:Spaghetti and Meaballs: Meatballs were pretty small and you only got four.Calzone: The Calzone was tasty but the bottom was really soggy. Gelato: How can you mess up Gelato :)I will give it another try but if you are going to charge 16 dollars for a Calzone make sure its worth it.
2015-05-08,3,This place is quite new, open only about two weeks at the time I was there. And that newness shows, in not-great ways.The location IS great, in Sinatra park, on the water with a great view of the Hudson River and Manhattan. You can see kids playing soccer, boats on the river, joggers going by. It's pretty sweet. Parking around there isn't great (there's a public garage at 333 River, street parking while cheaper will require lots of luck).There is more seating outdoors, on three sides of the restaurant, than inside. With windows on three sides, the views inside should still be good.The food was actually quite good.Where things fell apart, and showed the newness, was in the service and execution:=I tried to determine if the lasagna was meat or vegetarian (the menu didn't say) so I asked the waiter about it, and he started to describe what lasagna WAS. To be fair, I don't believe English was his first langue=I also asked about the pasta al forno, to determine if there was meat (I like meat) and he described it, mentioning meat (or "beef", I forget exactly). I confirmed "So there's meat?" and ordered it. When it came, there was no meat. (It was still good, just not what I was wanting..also the pasta was cooked a fair bit beyond al dente.)=We had to ask for utensils and napkins when our salads arrived (after a fair amount of time)=While we ordered the same salad, one had finely chopped carrots on it, the other had no carrots=Our pasta dishes were brought out roughly two minutes after our salads...we asked them to bring them back once we had a chance to eat our salads=After paying with a credit card, the card and slips to sign were brought back without a penAny one or two of those small things would be overlooked, but all added up rather dampened the experience. I'll happily give this place another chance when it's had some time to work out the kinks, and re-evaluate then.
2015-05-05,1,I sat down for about 5-10minutes and had to wave at the waiter to bring me a menu. He said "no" as a joke and brought me a menu. I then waited for over 10 minutes until i finally managed to make eye contact with the waiter to tell him I was ready(mind you it wasn't a busy night, maybe a total of 4,5 tables were occupied). Another 5-10 minutes went by again after the eye contact and no one came to take our order. We got up and left, as we were the parking area, the waiter came out and yelled "sorry I was busy". We saw at least 2 people behind the bar and what seemed to be a manager. He picked up phone calls and used the computer monitors. We were there for minimum of 25 sitting right by the bar and no one cares to bring us a menu until we asked nor take our orders. The place is at an awesome location with an awful management.
2015-05-03,5,I almost hesitate to write a rave because I am guessing today was the last day we will be able to get a table with ease. My husband and I shared a mixed green salad and a 4 cheese pizza. Both were delicious. The pizza was different than other 4 cheese pies I've had (partly because it included smoked mutz) and I truly could have eaten another one. The table near us had ordered the baked clams, and I had food envy instantly. The desserts looked quite good too. The portions are very generous, and the service was terrific and friendly. It's very obvious they are aware that word of mouth/good reviews are key (which is refreshing) and really have the right mind set to make this place work. It's going to be a great summer spot, and I can't wait to go back.
2015-05-01,4,Came here for dinner with my husband. Sat outside - the view was great. Beer / wine selection could be expanded / improved. Traditional Italian food may be some of the best we've had in hoboken. Chicken parmigiana was awesome. Service was decent - staff still seems to be working out some kinks.
2015-04-30,5,Finally went to Blue Eyes for dinner last night with my husband. From the minute we walked in everyone was very friendly and made you feel at home. We got a great table outside with an incredible view so we were already enjoying our night. The menu was great and easy to figure out what to get without a million options. The bread is to die for and I usually never eat bread when places bring it. My husband had pizza and I had the cheese ravioli which is absolutely delicious!! The service was excellent and we can't wait to go back. I always jogged by and wondered why nothing opened at this location in so long. Very cool vibe I am certain this restaurant will be here for the long haul. What a perfect addition to Hoboken!
2015-04-27,4,I came here for saturday brunch this past weekend. The food was generally pretty good. I got the penne vodka which was flavorful and cooked well. The pizza on the other hand was mediocre. I could've got a much better pie elsewhere for under the price they charged. That being said, I would go back again. If youre going out for a date during the day i'd recommend this place.
2015-04-27,5,I had the truffle pizza - it was awesome!! Quattro formaggi was also great!! Wonderful pizza & a great view!!
2015-04-26,5,Great location, delicious food and attentive staff. House chianti was great. Would definitely go back again!
2015-04-26,5,Great family restaurant with beautiful views and great food. Authentic Italian pizza, flavorful clams and Nutella cappuccino are a MUST! Everyone was so friendly, we will definitely go back!
2015-04-26,4,Great pizza and service was much better since the first time I went
2015-04-25,5,Amazing quality food. Over the years, I have found it extremely hard to find a decent restaurant in Hoboken. This place is incredible; especially the prosciouto pizza. You can't get closer to tasting authentic Italian food.
2015-04-25,2,So I came with my friend here for the first time...looked pretty nice. Has a nice view of nyc. We waited a good 20 mins for someone to take our order and that's because I said something. All of the utensils and plates and glasses were pretty dirty. My wine glass looked like there's candle wax on it and my plate had some pink sticky shit on it. Food was ok. Bread was good. They don't have much options for drinks..just beer or wine which we didn't even know what the price of our drinks were...didn't even say on the bill. Overall it was an "eh" experience.
2015-04-19,5,I came last night for their opening party and again today for lunch, and let me say, if anywhere in Hoboken deserves to be successful it's Blue Eyes.They are a traditional Italian restaurant and their food is really authentic. I was just in Italy last month and the food was just as good. They make their pasta fresh every day, and the pizzas are cooked in a wood-fire oven. The entire staff seemed to be Italian - for example, our server was born in Sicily.Also the service was great. You can tell they are really cooking with their hearts and just want the customers to be happy. We had several staff helping us throughout our meal, all ensuring we were satisfied. My husband got the lasagna and it was absolutely amazing. I got a panini- also really good. I want to also reiterate this was their first day of service. I usually expect a restaurant to take a few weeks to get set up, and always anticipate a little chaos in the beginning. I was blown away by the quality of both food and service . It was actually pretty crowded when we came, and they really had everything under control. And of course outside seating with views of the skyline can't hurt either :)
