2021-10-19,5,Came here at around 10:00 am.  My husband and I ordered a chocolate almond croissant, apricot almond tart, and ham and cheese on a baguette.  Everything was delicious.  The staff was very friendly and they were very Covid-safe.  The seating area upstairs was also spaced well so I didn't feel weird sitting there and feeling like someone was breathing on top of me.  I will definitely come back!
2021-10-04,3,It's really just an okay bakery and cafe. On most days of the week they barely even have any pastries. If you walk in and it looks bare it seems that they have a limited selection, do yourself a favor and turn around and walk out. Whatever they have left will be stale. I have tried to learn when they bring fresh pastries in, but I don't think it's a very consistent schedule. One Sunday it will be packed to the brim with all sorts of pastries, the next Sunday the cases will be empty. I went in today (Monday) and there wasn't much to choose from. In the event that you happen to get there on a day that's full of pastries, the chocolate almond croissants are a nice indulgence. If you're not from Hoboken, there are much better French bakeries in Manhattan or across NJ that are more reliably good. As other older reviews suggest, if another French patisserie opened up in Hoboken, they would run this place to the ground.
2021-09-05,5,Thank you to the nicest staff member who helped me out the Sunday before Labor Day with the mystery bag. Thank you ! That was really embarrassing getting the locations mixed up! The food looks amaZing too. Very kind staff to help a minute after closing too
2021-08-30,5,Choc  O Pain is my favorite cafe in Hoboken. The baristas are so friendly. They also have tons of food to choose from. I highly recommend their quiche, almond croissant, and sandwiches. The space on the second floor is super cozy and not cramped at all. Great place for catching up with friends!
2021-08-09,5,Stopped by while walking around the area for the first time and so glad I did! The service was amazing and the person helping was so kind enough to tell me what everything was. His recommendation was the financier which was amazing and we also got chouquettes and kouign amanns. Definitely hard walking out the bakery without one of everything.
2021-08-02,5,Was walking through the streets of Hoboken, enjoying my vacation and came across this little gem. The staff was so warming and nice and the smell of fresh bread filled the atmosphere. I got a little bit of various things and it was super cheap!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND
2021-08-01,4,I am always a sucker for a good bakery. They serve freshly made crossiants as well as baked goods. Their Macaroons are also worth a try! I wouldn't say they are as good as LaudreÃÅe but not bad either.
2021-05-17,5,Stopped by here for dessert after testing out the new Shake Shack on Washington. Had the Strawberry Shortcake cream puff and the Strawberry Sable Breton tart. Both were fantastic. I should've bought more puffs!
2021-05-06,5,If you're in Hoboken and craving authentic French pastries, bread, sandwiches, quiches, and coffee: then come to Choc O Pain. The exterior is straight out of Paris, the food delicious, and staff are super friendly. Standouts are the chocopain $3.50 (I like mine heated) and due to covid, the ground floor does not offer any in-door dinning. Very limited outdoor seating is available.
2021-04-16,5,My favorite Choc O Pain! I recently moved to the area and I was so excited to see that they had a location a block from me. This location is amazing, it's spacious, all the baristas are super nice and attentive. Their bakery items and sandwiches are always fresh! The store manager Anika is very attentive and cares for her customers. Truly the best service you can get in Hoboken.
2021-04-07,5,The  chocolate  croissants This is my "special treat" spot, they are to die for! When COVID got rough and they needed to close their doors, we bought two boxes during their freezer sale and they were just as heavenly baked at home.  Mother's Day & my mother's birthday are no longer a true celebration unless I bring her one of these home. Trust me - treat yo self & get a "choc o pain" ASAP.
2021-02-28,4,Croissant was great! They also have several other flavors of croissants that give you a nice taste! Not best I've had but definitely good.
2020-11-03,5,Best coffee shop in Hoboken hands down. So cute and quaint, and their chocolate croissants are absolutely incredible.
2020-10-31,1,Worst hot chocolate ever. Don't buy the hot chocolate. It's horrible. Never spend money on hot chocolate a this place.
2020-08-25,5,Favorite bakery in Hoboken! The croissants are always freshly baked. This Choc o pain has a variety of French pasties. Highly recommend any of their homemade breads. The brioche loaf is my favorite!
2020-08-16,5,Maybe I am biased because I live on this block, but I love this place! Coffee is strong, and you will be happy with any pastry you choose! Can't go wrong with any croissants.  You can even get to-go kits for making bread or croissants which is a great family activity. Especially in the current climate, Choc O Pain has been great to visit and know they're taking necessary precautions for safety and health. My only recommendation is to look at the menu online as the posted menus are on the other side of the room and I have terrible eyesight. Shout out to the man who read the menu for me one time! Awesome staff and service.
2020-08-08,5,OK it's expensive, but oh, the patties are so wonderful ! I had a 'Financier' , incredible and something I can't pronounce or spell, (apricot and raspberry). Just incredible, wonderful taste. So it's only going to be a treat when I go here, but it's good to know that the money is well spent on exquisite pastries I don't often give 4 starts. I reserve it for something special. This is special
2020-06-29,4,It's one of my favorite coffee places in Hoboken! Their chocolate croissant and apple pastry are my favorites!
2020-06-20,4,Great local coffee spot in Hoboken. I've been here a few times. Iced coffee and cappuccino are great selections. They also have a ton of pastries and crossiants. The chocolate and almond crossaints are so good.
2020-06-11,5,I had the Leek and Goat Cheese Quiche and Chocopain. So delicious. Friendly staff too. I will return again and try the Egg Spinach and Ricotta sandwich and an iced coffee maybe.
2020-03-09,5,I brought a box of croissants in for a bunch of French people and got rave reviews ("better than Kayser", apparently).
2020-01-31,1,Disappointed disappointed disappointed!!!!Is the backer the same?The bread I bought was just as no good than the one I can have in a supermarket! Bad bad bad
2020-01-05,5,Today, my husband and I took the croissant making class.  It was amazing!  The instructor, Brenda, was informative, helpful, and very fun.  She really made the class enjoyable.  It was small, so you were able to ask questions and get help.  Plus, we were able to take home so many delicious goodies.  I would highly recommend this class. We are looking to take another class there soon. Two thumbs up!
2019-12-02,5,not gonna lie, when i first moved to NJ all i looked at were italian bakeries. I never thought twice to visit choc o pain until recently (and ive lived here for years). One of my friends recommended choc o pain, saying it was a legit french bakery so i "begrudgingly" tried it. Oh. My. God. The wasted years i am totally in love with this place. Light, buttery, flaky pastries and tarts. Delicious cream and almond flavored fillings! Fresh fruit pastries. Fresh bread too. Everything they have is to die for. I even took my parents and my dad danced down the block as he ate an almond croissant. Youre best bet is to sample sample sample. My goto has become the cinnamon snail pastry with a coffee. The staff are super nice too so dont be shy to ask them questions about whats in the counter!
2019-11-29,1,( Ratings based on what food taste and qualtiy for the price.  A rating for two stars is considered average by me. )The worst pastries I have ever had for its price.  The pumpkin pies were tasteless and bland.Perhaps it was due to a Thanksgiving Day rush, but my experience is that this place is over-price for what it offers.In any case, this shop cannot be said to be consistent.  ( Any place that sold product of this quality would never have any repeat customers. )
2019-10-15,5,The coffee and pastries here are so good! This is a solid spot in downtown. I usually get the iced coffee and you can taste the quality in the coffee
2019-09-30,1,I used to love this place. All of the Choc o pains. But in the past year the service and the delivery of beverages has been going down hill. It seems they don't pay attention to who the customers see on a daily basis and how condescending, slow, and rude they are. Recently I went to get an iced coffee, of course they eliminated the large while also raising prices. I want a straw, the young condescending man said "they're only for disabled people." Excuse me but no. If I want a straw, you will give me a straw. Not to mention they adopted these new silly cups that take MORE plastic to make they straws and food of cups combined. Also I'm not a 5 year old who drinks from a "sippy cup." I'm an adult woman. I really used to love this place. For a long time. What a bummer.
2019-09-28,4,Coffee here is really refreshing and egg spinach frittata sandwich is so filling and fresh. Sandwich with ricotta are was so good
2019-09-10,4,Probably the most amazing breads and croissants, and variations, this side of Paris. Seriously flaky, crispy, moist, in every spot that's perfect. Why not five stars? Some of the prepared food is missing the mark either the temperature it's served at or the flavors tho they are ok and the biggest disappointment for me is the espresso/coffee should be better. Imagine having an amazing latte/cappuccino with that bread....!!! Back to the positive, can't go within 50 feet of any Chocopan location and not go in to get my (at least 3) favorites and then drift into bakery heaven.
2019-08-11,4,Good selection of breads, cakes and pastries. Coffee is good albeit slightly overpriced. Gets busy on the weekends and there are only two outdoor tables. Free WiFi though which is always a plus!
2019-06-02,5,Thank you for making such delicious tarts, they are second to none! It is also a very cozy place, we love coming by.
2019-04-09,5,One of my favorite places when I was living in Hoboken!These guys always had the best coffee and great food. I always got the chocolate croissant or the ham and cheese croissant when I was looking for something easy to eat on my walk to the PATH. We can't forget about the spinach and ricotta sandwich though...it is so good and perfect for a Saturday morning breakfast.Wish I could move Choc O Pain with me to the Upper East Side!
2019-04-03,5,Favorite bakery in town! Great food and coffee and people working there aren't annoying! Keep it up!
2019-03-21,5,It's been a minute and a half since I've been here although I used to get my coffee / drinks here all the time, and also their brunch items as well as their macaroons :)  I used to come here with someone that I used to be very close with and unfortunately who's not in my life anymore.  That said this is a great little joint that we both enjoyed thoroughly when I lived nearby.  The upstairs area is good for working too although some days / times it's used for numerous moms and their youngins to romp around so can be not ideal when focus is required.   Looking forward to my next visit back here
2019-03-06,5,Such a great place!! JC and Hoboken multi-store fronts. Really really authentic. Cannot express that enough!
2019-02-20,5,This is a gem of a bakery. I love all their pastries.They make four different kinds of kouign amann. Get them all.I also love the escargot a la cannelle. It's a "lighter" version of a cinnamon roll without the icing.
2019-02-20,5,I love the coffee here! Price could be a little lower. I love that they offer almond milk. The lattes are very good. Service is good and friendly. I'm a returning customer. Lattes are consistent and so is the service. Friendly and nice atmosphere. Love the creativity with the foam.
2019-02-16,4,Normally would leave 5 stars specifically for their ham and  cheese baguette. My favorite, and I've tried all different ones from the best French bakeries in NYC and NJ. However just ordered on postmates today, and they definitely cheaped out in the cheese - like, they used a DIFFERENT cheese. Normally their emmental cheese is nicely nutty and a warm yellow color. Today it's like they used a supermarket version, very bland in flavor and pale in color. With the sandwich only having butter, ham and cheese as the ingredients, this completely changed the flavor of the sandwich and was just disappointing. Overall just confused how the bakery decided to order a different cheese? The baseline expectation of purchasing food from a restaurant is consistency. Hopefully they read this and fix. $8 is already quite pricey for this sandwich but I've been willing to pay in the past because the ingredients were top notch. But today I definitely felt swindled.
2019-02-09,3,The chocolate croissant is a nice treat,  but very overpriced in comparison to size of the croissant. The spinach cheese filled croissant was tasty, but overly greasy. Grab extra napkins!
2019-01-13,5,Their croissant was so yummy! The line moved pretty past. The offer milk substitutions and they take cards! Everything looked fresh. I wish I had time to try everything.
2018-12-09,5,Prompt and helpful customer service! I ordered macaroons as party favors from them - ordered was prepared as expected, customer service was amazing and macaroons super delicious.
2018-12-02,1,I usually come here for my pastries which are very good. But today we decided to get some hot chocolate. Ok, so we were told the hot chocolate is dark chocolate (still chocolate) and semi-sweet because it is a French patisserie. I thought fine - since I have been to a few and the hot chocolate was still very good since it was not made out of powder.But what is this poor excuse that you call hot chocolate?!When we went to taste it, it was literally water and chocolate. Why are using water and not milk?! Even (I dare not say it) Dunkin or Starbucks make better hot chocolate than this?! I think I can make a better tasting hot chocolate at home. This is very disappointing and it should be removed from the menu since it is just not good!! We ended up going to Craft Gelato (kids approved) which is one door down to replace this watery drink they call hot chocolate  and really good gelato.Choc O' Pain is only good for pastries.
2018-11-16,5,Choc O Pain has the freshest, most delicious French pastries I've had in a long time! Their croissants are always crispy and their coffees are great as well. Staff is friendly too! If you are in search of an authentic French pastry with some iced coffee or a cappuccino, Choc O Pain is the way to go.
2018-11-08,5,Choc O Pain Is a local classic. During the day there are many people seated here working from home with their laptops open and their coffee or tea and a fresh pastries. There are two floors of sitting here and it is very easy to get here from the path train, and write off of Washington Street as well. There are macaroons, croissants, French bread, and various other tasty treats available! This is definitely a local stable, am something I would recommend trying. They have locations in Jersey City as well, and I think they are also in a store further back in Hoboken. Waiting with review was making me want a chocolate croissant right now :-) it is also a great spot to meet up with friends or have a date. The pricing is pretty reasonable here for what you would get.
2018-11-08,3,Food is a 10/10Coffee is a 10/10However the service is pretty terrible. Whenever I go, there is consistently a long wait time to get a coffee and croissant. Twice there has been no one in front of me, and they simply forgot to pour the coffee but gave the croissant. Had a 12 minute wait for drip coffee yesterday. I asked about the breakfast special advertised on the sign outside, and neither of the workers knew anything about it.Again, amazing food and atmosphere but the staff seems very disorganized
2018-10-14,4,Place has good pastries and good iced coffees. Favorite item here is the petite kouigns- delicious. Prices are on the higher side,  but don't blame them considering their central location.
2018-10-10,4,I passed by here on my commute in and wanted to try it. There isn't many places in Hoboken that really blow me away so I been trying to find alternatives. The $9 buck lunch special which was a small sandwich/quiche, salad and pastry/drink is what I chose. I picked the slightly spicy tuna (they have other options) and it was delicious, salad was mixed greens but overall a good portion for the money. The pastry though...hmmm... that was yummy, a chocolate chip little muffin that made you want to order a cup of hot cocoa. Order at the counter and you can sit and leave the world behind for a bit. Refreshed and Fed, I was happy here. I'll be returning again.
2018-10-09,3,I'm a regular customer of choc o pain and I used to like their pastries a lot better. Recently more and more I find the pastries and bread over or underbaked. If you are true coffee lover please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for coffee, unfortunately, the staff does not know how to make a decent latte.
2018-09-09,5,I used to stop in after work on my way to Hoboken Terminal. I love love love croissants and the almond, chocolate, and almond chocolate croissants were all amazing. I recently stopped working in Hoboken and, aside from the city views, I have to say this place will be the only part of Hoboken I'll miss.
2018-09-07,4,Nice cafe for french pastries. Priced a bit expensive. French music all day long.Downstairs seating place and small, but the upstairs has plenty of room to hang out. They even have a section for kids to play, with some books and toys on cushioned floor. Very nice touch for family with small kids. Love the fact they serve food on a plate for eat in.
2018-06-21,2,A chocolate croissant was $3.35, one croissant - nothing else. At the Choc-O-Pain in Jersey City, the same croissant is $2/2.50 with tax. Too expensive, not well made, and the staff seems sad. I don't blame them, the all-around pastries/lunches are a hassle and nothing you can't make at home. Don't stop in here unless you are looking for an uninspired chain that disappoints and sets off your bank overdraft fee alerts.
2018-06-19,5,So Lucky I found this place on Yelp!  Hosted a small welcome-baby shower and it was the perfect location.  The food was amazing and everyone loved all the amazing baked goods;-)Can't wait to take some of their baking classes!Thanks guys!
2018-05-06,5,Aaa! Great place, you can eat your tongue!))) try french meringue and choco-almond croissant)))
2018-05-03,4,Baguette is good. I also love that they have mini version of the sandwich and soup.
2018-04-17,5,I went here last week for a meeting in the upstairs section. It was so cute and comfortable! The host ordered croissants, various pastries, prosciutto and cheese bites, flatbreads, and mini sandwiches. It was all literally DIVINE I could not stop munching!! Best bakery in Hoboken for sure!
2018-04-12,5,Love this place--authentic French pastries!! Petit kouigns don't look like much but are my new favorite pastry EVER!!
2018-04-09,4,It is a quaint little bakery right in town. We ordered the chocolate almond croissant, spinach feta croissant, and a hot chocolate. Crispy, but flaky and soft in the middle. The hot chocolate however was not sweet since they use dark chocolate so it just tasted like hot milk. Since my husband doesn't drink coffee it was his only hot drink option. Worth to check out if you want a little sweet to start your morning.
2018-04-03,4,The bread here is very good but it's kinda expensive for me though... and small... they have good coffee here too they used modcup from jersey city. I would say the bread in this bakery taste like Asian bread, while there are plenty of Asian bakeries could beat this one with cheaper price... it's just a fine bakery only in little expensive Hoboken. But definitely better choice than Carlos.
2018-03-24,4,Great homemade pastries. They are known for their pastries and you can't really go wrong with it. Comfortable ambiance. Don't get the yogurt though. Their yogurt is not homemade and is general grocery store brands. Their granola is also store bought and tasted old. Doubt they wash the fruits before putting it in the yogurt. Saw them take the fruits right out of the plastic container to cut and put in the bowl.
2018-02-23,4,Best French bread in Hoboken, not mad on the patisserie, it can get chaotic  at  the weekend as the  system for ordering and paying is far from organized, I have walked out in the past frustrated due to the chaos.
2018-02-01,5,Good coffee and absolutely delicious baked goods! The staff is always pleasant and efficient. Everything is much better than some bakeries on washington
2018-01-27,5,One of my favorite little rustic downtown spots in Hoboken, love their baked goods and soups.A very reliable service from their managers and staff.It's great for meetings downstairs or upstairs which is very toddler friendly (upstairs).  I normally grab a la coluombe double espresso cortado  with the $3.20 financiers (gluten-free) but their croissants $2.90,  kouigns $3.35 or their Banana Creme tarte $6.75 are amazing! They accept cash/card/applepay and have gender neutral restrooms. They have free WiFi as well! Excited for their new shop opening up on 15th street by the Tea Building. Enjoy.
2018-01-20,3,Good location and ambience. We ordered Hot chocolate and mocha. Both were ok! Didn't order food so can't comment. Tiny place and slow service. They took 20 mins for 2 hot drinks!
2017-12-27,4,The Croissant aux Amandes is absolutely delicious, you will not be disappointed! Great French bakery...a little pricey, but overall a good spot.
2017-11-30,4,Choc-O-Pain is still one of my favorite hangouts in Hoboken. I agree that it can be hit or a miss if you're getting anything other than a croissant or pastry. Mornings are pretty rushed and the two ladies behind the counter try their best to meet the barrage of mommy groups, out and about professionals and everyone else in between. Still nothing can come close to their chocolate tart, chocolate croissant and almond croissant. The upstairs can be a refuge in the afternoons if you manage to snag a spot. I like that they are very family friendly and have space for babies to crawl and a bunch of toys to keep them occupied. #winningOther pluses: clean restrooms, free WiFi and water jugs aplenty. Wait - did I just send more people their way? May be they can head to uptown Hoboken where a new branch is opening shortly!
2017-11-05,5,The petit kouign is probably the best pastry I have ever eaten and they are unique to this establishment. It is crispy, sugary, chewy, flaky - somehow everything all in one. The pain au chocolat ("chocopain" as they term them) are classic and much better than anywhere else you can get them. They are puffy and flaky, but are sometimes tough to get ahold of as they are made/sold in batches during the day. I've purchased another item and seen a fresh batch roll in the door on my way out, which is a bit painful! I wish they made chausson aux pommes on a more regular basis because they are very well made and less sugary than the American version (plus no cinnamon bombs)!
2017-11-04,4,Fresh pastries in the morning. The almond chocolate croissant was fantastic. There were also some French people picking up pastries so I assume it's pretty authentic. I have heard from friends they have not had the same experience in the afternoon. Apparently they run out of pastries or they are not as fresh later on. Something to just be aware of when planning a visit.As for the coffee: While my almond latte was delicious, my boyfriend just ordered a regular coffee and it was so bad. Like bad bad. It tasted like coffee grounds in water. When he let the servers know behind the counter, they just poured the first one out and gave him a refill to try again. It was still really bad, I also gave it a try to make sure..we didn't bother to ask for a refund, just threw it away. So while the espresso drinks and pastries were good, something is up with the regular coffee.
2017-10-03,5,Delicious French viennoiseries, especially the almond croissant and the mini kouignaman!
2017-10-03,5,Always the quiet, peaceful and gorgeous Cho O Pain! I am not going to right anything more because I have so much stuff to study and I always prefer to study and have my coffee here.
2017-09-26,5,Just visited Hoboken last week to realize that I never knew of this place before. This mistake is fixed. Pretty good place to get anything you expect form a french bakery. Nice settings too as you have choice of outside or inside to sip your coffee and work at the same time. The best part are sandwiches which are not to miss just like their breads.
2017-09-04,5,great little bakery shop, good coffee, good pastries, if you love french bakeries you will love this place, it is really cute and cozy and has a great atmosphere. will def. come back again next time im in Hoboken!
2017-08-26,5,MY FAVORITE CAFE IN HOBOKEN!! Their pastries are so delicious. My favorite is the Petit Kouign. The chocolate one is caramelized on the outside and soft and chewy inside. The apple one was buttery & flaky all around. The raspberry one was sweet and tart. I love how each flavor has its own unique spin. I also love the Financiers. It's hard to explain, just try it! The bread and pastries are just amazing. They brew la colombe (my favorite coffee brand in NYC). The staff is super friendly. The cafe has such a community feel. Upstairs there are toys and books for kids. It's great for when you're working but like a little buzz noise.
2017-08-16,5,This place is the real deal for french pastries! Their upstairs seating was the perfect spot to meet a friend and cowork with a plate of pastries to enjoy. Their wifi wasn't great upstairs. Not sure about downstairs. Parking is a pain so walk there if you can.
2017-07-29,5,Super cute bakery with delicious drinks and baked goods. I found this bakery on a whim, and my friend and I gave it a try. The drinks were probably better than Starbucks and the food was fresh. It was a busy place, with a consistent flow of people in and out.
2017-07-23,5,We go for coffee, but the breads and pastries are the biggest draw. Always busy, but always quick service. A true asset for the neighborhood.
2017-07-21,3,Had financier and ice tea. The outer crust was too hard to be a good one. This place needs some decent A/C.
2017-07-16,5,Best customer service in town. However they always take my order wrong. For example if I say I want a cold small cappuccino, they would end up giving me a hot large cappuccino.
2017-07-03,5,Best iced latte in town! Also great pastries and if you catch them at the right time, you can snag a free sample!
2017-06-20,2,Short & Sweet: Inconsistent bakery quality. Coffee & espresso, I prefer to go elsewhere.Detailed:I used to love coming to this bakery for a quick bite in the morning - a small coffee/Americano & chocolate croissant. Lately (past 6 months or so), the croissants can be over-baked and burned - some days you get awesome, flaky golden croissant skins; other days dark brown and crispy. I know they're glazed with butter, so they're easy to brown, but you'd figure they'd have a set timer down by now.In terms of coffee, I only grab one if I can't run over to Empire or BweÃÄ (which are both more uptown). Regarding espresso, it's a bit more on the bitter & acidic side, if that's your preference.
2017-06-14,4,Stopped by to get breakfast for lunch! Super cute bakery with a good amount of seats inside. They had a good selection of sandwiches, but I was hooked on the croissants. I got the almond croissant and the choc-o-pain (because of the namesake). Both were so flaky and crispy, I wish this cute shop was a little closer. I would definitely be back to get breakfast (for breakfast) or check out their sandwiches or quiche.
2017-06-14,5,The service is friendly and the environment very Frenchie and quaint... but how's the drink and food you ask! The cafe latte was delicious, not bitter or diluted, and the almond croissant and very nice, flaky and sweet. I recommend this place if you like that French cafe atmosphere (without the Fresh waiter attitude).
2017-05-02,5,Every time I walk past this cafe I stop in to get a choc-o-pain. They are the best, especially for breakfast with a coffee, which is also very good. The staff are all great too very friendly and helpful. I've never had a bad experience here and I stop in 3-5 times a week.
2017-04-26,4,Solid coffee and French pastry spot. Try the iced latte, cappuccino, financier, and the sandwiches. They get pretty busy during the morning rush but the employees work quick! They also have seats upstairs if you decide to stay longer and read a book or do some work
2017-04-08,5,This bakery is lovely! I've always eyed this place as a place to stop in, but I never make it downtown Hoboken. I'm so glad I did! Given that their name is choc-o-pain, I tried the choc-o-pain pastry and it does not disappoint! Its filled with dark choclate and the pastry itself is extremely flaky. Next time I'm going to ask them to warm it up! The barista and staff behind the bar are very courteous and knowledgeable regarding their breads and pastries, and accommodating to your needs. I asked for a decaf almond milk latte and it was made perfectly. There are about 4-5 small tables with chairs and a high top community table where I sat to do some work. It' a nice small atmosphere, very welcoming and definitely plan to come back for more pastries!
2017-03-20,5,I love this little cafe in Hoboken. Being inside of Choc O Pain brought me memories of my trip to Paris. The staff here are so warm and welcoming, and are very helpful. I love the almond milk caffe latte they make. I also tend to get a chocolate croissant every time I'm here (what they're famous for). Their croissants are flaky and delicious and as a bonus, they use great ingredients!
2017-03-19,4,Up until late this has always been a solid 5 star gem in Hoboken. Their tasty pastries and hot/iced coffees are amongst the best in Hoboken, and even in Jersey/NYC for that matter. Its a delightful cafe off of the hustle and bustle of Washington Street. When you step in you might as well be on a side street of Paris (not that I've been but its what I imagine it would look like). Highlights: the choc o pain, quiches, chouquettes, and the pleasant nature that they serve every item with. Their coffee is outstanding. Pretty much any food item you order will not disappoint. Lowlights: their service is haphazard. dining in they have forgotten to make my food a few times. The seating is right up against where the line is so its not exactly a relaxing place. Their mugs are chipped and the refrigerated display case isn't working still. They are out of coffee sleeves and instead are double cupping things. They could benefit from a re-worked traffic flow pattern and a little bit of reinvestment. Despite your flaws, you will always have my foodie heart in your hand Cho O Pain!
2017-03-11,5,This bakery makes me feel like I'm in Europe. Which I love! Ive gotten a variety of pastries, quiches and sandwiches here and I'm a huge fan. The quality of everything is superb. They also offer Groupon deals every now and then which is great. I work in the city and often stop in for boxes of croissants for my office. I'm a hero every time I do! I can't wait for the new location in the heights. I definitely plan on walking up to that location as well.
2017-03-08,4,My, oh my, what a cute and tempting store hiding in a quiet spot near City Hall!Lemme tell you, trying to decide on a dessert place that is highly regarded in Yelp along Washington Street was a struggle. Not because they were scarce but because there were TOO MANY! Finally I decided to go with the nearest one to me which happened to be this one. As soon as I walked it, I let out a resigned sigh. I wouldn't be able to eat everything I wanted to in that store. The air was filled with the comforting scent of bread and carbs. I was able to narrow it down to four pastries and as an added bonus, if you spend $10 or more, you get a free drink!I got the classic name-sake Chocopain ($3.15), Apple Petit Kouign ($3.20), Mini boule au chocolat, and another one that isn't listed on the menu but I will include in my pictures. For my free drink, I chose a CafeÃÅ au lait which was perfect for a chilly day (well, chilly for this Southern California girl). I've eaten three out of the four and my favorite was the apple petit kouign. I really wish I bought more than one but it was a last-minute decision to push me over the edge of $10. The disappointment was the boule. I think because it was out in the open air, it got very tough and difficult to eat. I ended up throwing it away after two bites and that made me very sad.I wish I had more time to explore their savory offerings but I definitely bookmark this place for future trips. Added perk, free wifi!
2017-02-19,5,The best croissants I have ever eaten (even the ones I ate in Paris weren't as good). Buttery, light, flaky...just perfect. Also hands down my favorite brewed coffee. I love this place and I honestly can't say enough about it. Great spot to work on your laptop or meet a friend. Lots of seating downstairs and upstairs. Amazing sandwiches...some of my favorites are the saucisson, the tuna, and the curry chicken.  Wonderful ambience...a little touch of Paris in downtown Hoboken.
2017-02-15,5,Wow! Excellent food. Came for espresso, but will keep coming back for the taste of all the bakery goods. So fresh ended up buying more. The use La Colombe beans for espresso which is good. Mocs Latte was very light in Mocca so may want to ask for more syrup if you prefer moca taste.
2017-02-06,4,Their Almond chocolate croissant & almond milk lattes make any morning more enjoyable. If you're looking to sit, try upstairs as there are about half a dozen tables always open.
2017-01-29,4,I frequently eat at a local Hoboken restaurant that has their baguettes baked daily from Choc o pain- not only does it have a magnificent crust outside it's the perfect amount of chewy bread on the inside. I was walking past and couldn't resist taking a look at other items available and was delighted to see my favorite cookies- Macarons. They are not made on premise but they were the perfect texture of an authentic Macaron and very FRESH. Keep up the great work! I'm glad to see you have several other locations so I can also visit you in Jersey City!
2017-01-26,5,French Gem in HobokenThey have a lot of different fresh baked items, sandwiches, and a few other options. You can actually see them bake behind the display window, very cool. They also serve La Colombe coffee. This stuff is quality and some of my favorite coffee in the tri state.I had some coffee, a chocolate croissant, and a jambon (french sandwich). I do wish the baguette was a bit softer and the croissant had a bit more chocolate. But the jambon was still delicious and the croissant was flaky and just out of the oven.
2017-01-22,4,Rustic little shop with upstairs seating at large communal tables. Selection is great and the pastries are heavenly. Great place for a pastry and coffee in Hoboken. I am pleasantly surprised and thanks for the warmest hospitality too. Great croissants & warm staff.
2017-01-15,5,All of the baked goods at this place are phenomenal if you have ever been to France this place is like stepping into a bakery in Paris..
2017-01-12,5,This place is the BEST!!!!! Wonderful place to sit, have lunch, sip tea, and enjoy the atmosphere. The upstairs is so homey that I fell asleep on the big comfy chair. I had the lentil salad and a peppery white tea. Both were very high quality. The woman at the counter is also really sweet and accommodating, offered to make the lentil salad on the spot and they also charged my phone. Can't wait to come back and try more delicious treats. Also picked up some local Hoboken honey :)
2017-01-02,5,Best cafe in Hoboken, hands down. Everything is good. My favorite are the petite kouigns.
2016-12-26,5,Such a cozy, free spirit place. Staff members are sweet and patient with requests. Background music and decor of the cafe definitely brings an authentic French feel. Had a pastry with raspberry and another with maple and both were equally delicious. Plan on visiting again
2016-12-21,5,AH MAZ ING. Nothing else to write. It's all amazing. Their pastries are what all other pastries should strive to be. The petite queens (not how they're spelled, but how they're pronouced) are heaven in your mouth. We also tried their banana walnut bread, chocolate croissant, ham and cheese croissant, and drinks. it was all really really really good.Cute spot inside, a bit crowded and hot, but isn't that everywhere in NY?
2016-11-20,5,The best croissants! I love the chocolate almond croissants. I also occasionally grab a dozen croissants for the office and everyone loves it. They also often have groupons so it's a decent deal!
2016-10-30,5,Absolutely delicious with top notch service makes their expensive pricing worth it. Their biggest problem is they can't keep their melt-in-your-mouth bakery items (patisserie items if I'm being more accurate with my language) in stock.
2016-10-16,5,I absolutely love having this French bakery in downtown Hoboken. It's a great place to stop on your way to work to pick up a strong cup of coffee and a pastry on your the at in. They also offer catering options to being tasty pastries to the office too. Each time I come I always get the Quiche Lorraine a small salad. Their chocolate stuffed croissants are especially delicious. This is also a great place for a quick brunch on the weekends or a cup of coffee with a friend.
2016-10-12,4,The place is definitely beautiful and the food was good. Another overpriced location though.
2016-10-10,3,Meh. I have been to the location in Jersey City and it is much better than the Hoboken location. Their selection of pastries confused me and it seemed as if they were all left over from the day prior. I went on a Sunday morning and they only had half of their selection available. My brother ordered a cappuccino and said it was way too milky. I would return for something quick and easy, but still on the fence about it.
2016-10-03,3,A decent pain au chocolat, but far from worth returning.
2016-09-10,4,Note to self... Need to get to Choc o Pain prior to 1pm on Saturdays if I have any chance of successfully getting what I actually set out to get in the first place (such as, for example, the pastry after which the bakery is named, a chocopain). In my experience, the store sells out of most of its popular menu items fairly early in the day, at least on weekends. Today, I ordered the Croissant jambon emmental and a chocopain, but both were sold out, so I wound up getting the Baguette jambon beurre emmental and an almond chocopain. While I was disappointed that my first choices were unavailable (which has been the case previously as well) I cannot at all say that I was disappointed with the food that I ended up with - this place has fantastic food, bread, and baked goods/pastries, which is probably why they sell out of everything so early in the day. To date, I have thoroughly enjoyed everything I have tried there, but I only wish that they made more of everything so that it would be possible to try more! I absolutely recommend this cafe/bakery to anyone in the area, though only before a certain time of day if you're looking for something to eat.
2016-09-08,5,My favorite bakery in Hoboken, and perhaps all of NYC. Fresh bread, and their pastries are delicious. My favorites are choc o pain and petit queen.
2016-09-07,3,Service is spotty and the coffee is not great. The thing that makes me comes back is their pastries especially the kouign - they are buttery crunchy delicious comes in 3 flavors: raspberry, Apple and chocolate. Not cheap for a small pastry but it's good. Their bread is decent but the sandwiches are pre-made and dry - would not recommend. Stop by just for the kouign. Has a few outdoor seating and a large upstairs.
2016-08-29,5,I enjoyed my ever visit of this place. It's located not too far from the Hoboken PATH station. The croissant is to die for. I have also had the quiche and sandwiches. If I have time, I liked to sit in the cafe and enjoy the food and beverages.
2016-08-09,5,My favourite coffee shop. Great service. Nice atmosphere. Awesome desert and coffee. Never purchased their sandwiches so can't comment on those. I recommend getting their points card if you plan to visit frequently.
2016-08-03,4,I LOVE THIS PLACE, but hate the tons of screaming babies and toddlers that fill it.It would normally get 5 stars, but the ambiance is just plain horrible sometimes. It makes me and my fianceÃÅ doubt if we want kids.  But we want lots and lots of croissants. The plain croissants are to die for and the chocolate croissants may be even better.  Excellent coffee and awesome sandwiches and breads.  I have never been disappointed with their food and visit a few times a week.  Always bring some carbs home for the family when I visit.
2016-08-02,2,I was surprised that this place has 4 stars.  I went on Sunday afternoon around 3pm, maybe because it's later in the day, but the selection was limited, the bakeries and sandwiches looked  old.  From just looking at the sandwiches, the salami and chicken meat looked dry.  It took me a while to decide on which to try as there were limited selections.  Finally I decided to try the chocolate croissant, it was not bad, also not that great neither, nothing special about the croissant.  Price tends to be on high side, almost similar to the bakeries in NYC.  For the same price, I could get much better and fresher bakeries in a French bakery in NYC.
2016-08-02,5,Amazing!  Chocolate almond croissant, macaroons, amazing apple muffins. Everything was on point.
2016-07-31,4,Came here for coffee and breakfast on Sunday afternoon/morning. Absolutely love this place. It really feels like you're in someone's home relaxing. Doesn't feel like the overcrowded over commercialized mess that is most coffee houses. Had te chocolate bread pudding which was delicious. Coffee was solid too. Check out the upstairs area! There are couches and the space in general feels unique. Only thing to watch out for is a ton of families with little kids that sometimes like to come here. Can be a little annoying haha unless you have kids then bring em.
2016-07-29,5,Choc o pain is probably one of my most favorite things about Hoboken. I literally go at least twice a week. I buy all of my bread from choc o pain and love to go and sit out side while sipping coffe and eating a delectable crescent! Highly recommend!
2016-07-18,5,Check out the second floor! Really cute and comfortable. It has a lot of toys for kids to play with. It might be hard to get a seat though. Pastries and the light bites are really good.
2016-07-13,5,My favorites are chocolate croissant and kouigan! Love how everything is made fresh daily. Staff are friendly. If you ever want recommendations just ask and they will be more than happy to help. Haven't tried their coffee yet but heard it's of the best in town. Gotta try it next time
2016-06-24,5,I always go for a tea and work there for the entire afternoon. Nice people and ambience!
2016-05-17,4,All the pastries I've had from here have been dangerously good, and the cafe atmosphere's very relaxing considering how close it is to Washington St.
2016-04-30,2,Disclaimer - I am not the type of person to malign any business or person for the sake of doing so or with unjust evil intent.  That being said, I am a firm believer in the power of constructive feedback to lead to better outcomes for all parties involved (in this case, both customers and the enterprise itself).In short - this Choc-o-Pain was not kind to my friends who were living above it. They had smells that would seep into the apartment and also played loud music at odd hours. My friends are extremely reasonable people and tried to work with the business to amend this. However, it did not pan out. They have thankfully since moved out of Hoboken (for other reasons...not because of this place, to be fair).I obviously have very limited power in this situation, but am hoping that the owners will read this review and think about how to build better relationships with future tenants. Overall - 3 points for actual food products (this is a standard run of the mill bakery).  One point for establishment management because of the reasons mentioned above.  Average them out and you get a rating of "2" (which is what I have given it).
2016-04-27,4,Perfect atmosphere for getting work done. Pleasant staff and variety of pastries. There is a cute room upstairs for children to play, which doubles as a great workspace when it is quiet.
2016-04-23,4,Great ambience, this place has a lofted room perfect to study and/or hang out with a group of friends. Pastries are on point and the coffee is great as well
2016-04-17,5,I've tried different kinds of croissant and they were awesome! Sandwiches were healthy and great. coffee/espresso was also great!!
2016-04-17,3,It's really 3 1/2 stars......the coffee and ambiance were the same at every coffee cafe......we chose and apple tart and a chocolate chip and almond pastry...  again 3 1/2 stars......we did take a loaf of sour bread with a nice crust on the outside......that was very good.......I was hoping to be wowed and I wasnt.....
2016-04-11,1,Manhattan prices without Manhattan food or service. Head to Washington & 4th's Old German Bakery to taste the difference.
2016-04-11,4,This place is adorable! Grab a coffee and a chocolate croissant on a Sunday afternoon. The vibes here are cozy, friendly, and relaxing.
2016-04-09,4,Delicious bakery selection of breakfast and lunch items. The staff members were all very friendly and helpful in assisting me. I got a black iced tea and the quiche Lorraine. It was so outstanding! Just fluffy, light, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. I wish they had pour over coffee options and more iced tea options, other than just black and green. But it was a great place to go and get some work done. Highly recommend!
2016-04-05,3,Go for the Atmosphere..   great place to just relax and have a cup of coffeeCoffee and Pastries are good. 2nd Fl, Quiet
2016-03-30,3,Decent but disappointed. Thought it would be like la Bouche but at 4 limited options for dining and less than expected baked goods available. Nice atmosphere. Delicious dessert.Come here for tea and dessert, not lunch if you're looking for a sandwich.
2016-03-18,4,I live about a block from this place and finally decided to stop in on a random Saturday morning. I was feeling adventurous so I just asked what their specialties were and grabbed a few of each. I have to say, everything was absolutely delicious. I couldn't even tell you what I ate but I would get it all again. Fantastic! My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey. But definitely good to indulge.
2016-03-18,4,I was surprised with two boxes of various pastries from this bakery for my birthday, and while I've been trying to cut down on my sugar, I still managed to sample a little bit of everything:Ham & Cheese Croissant - Buttery Flakey Happiness, this is the perfect portable breakfast, I could probably eat three of these in one sittingChocolate Croissant - There were two in the box, and despite splitting this, everyone wanted more of theseMini Kouign Amanns - You can't go wrong with any of these: chewy, syrupy goodness!  While their basic kouign amanns are my favorite, the chocolate, strawberry, and apple flavors are definitely worth a tasteBanana Tart - this is a baby banana creme pie, just yumApple Tart - surprisingly, this was my least favorite, the apple was very tart, and didn't have enough sweetness to balance it out, however it was the prettiest pastry according to the general consensusFlourless Chocolate Cake - this is really just a brownie, a delicious chocolate brownie dusted in powdered sugarOverall, a definite hit, I have a feeling we'll be seeing more from this bakery in the office after this.
2016-03-03,4,Chewy Petit Kouign! All flavors come out delicious! Would definitely come here again.
2016-03-02,3,I used a groupon for one dozen chocolate or plain croissants a month ago in Hoboken. My friend bought another dozen this weekend as a gift for me. Very surprised to see how the croissants lost their size in a month. They are not as big as they used to be. The chocolate ones were quite small. Very dissapointing to see how the owners decided to cut the size of the croissants. Let's offer a discount through Groupon but make them smaller. Really? Is it worth it? I am sure I am not the only one dissapointed.:(
2016-02-25,4,This place is great! They have quality food, tasty sweets, and there coffee is some of the best in Hoboken!
2016-02-23,5,I tried this place for a Saturday breakfast and overall it was great! I had a choc o pain and coffee and both were on point! The line was long, but moved fairly quickly and there was enough seating that we were able to get a seat without waiting at all.I'm excited to try more delicious food from Choc O Pain!
2016-02-21,5,Lovely place, a bit smelly and old-ish but sweet! The pastries are perfect; the coffee drinks are pretty good too. It's an open kitchen design so you can watch them make the breads and sweets.
2016-02-16,5,This place is so adorable and the food is great. I think it is a little over priced, but the service makes it worth it. Plus they have wifi; that's a win for me.
2016-02-10,4,I've been to Choc O Pain a ton of times! Their pastries never ever disappoint. It's a great place for a book, pastry, and coffee. During my last check-in, I was in a rush and had forgotten to eat lunch. I decided to swing by and pick up one of their delicious moist croissants and a small coffee. My only complaint was that the service was a bit slow and unorganized!
2016-02-06,5,Great little place with yummy coffee, macarons, and fun snacks!
2016-01-25,5,A bit pricey however everything is fresh and delicious worth every penny. I sometimes think the only reason my family visits me is so they can come here before they head home.
2016-01-24,3,Got hot coffee - very good. Got hot chocolate - not so good. Light on the chocolate and no sugar added. Got chocolate croissant - delicious. Little expensive for some items - Bread or sandwiches and Americano is nearly 5 bucks for a large. The wait is frustrating. The cashier has to tell the guy making the coffee everything each time. Surely there should be a better system? It's a beautiful space with lovely decor and chilled atmosphere.
2016-01-23,5,AMAZING is the only descriptor I can come up with as mind fills with the buttery delights at Choc O Pain... I stopped in on my way to the local Pinot's Palette in adorable Hoboken... I needed a quick lunch and something warm to drink to get me through the evening and had been food-dreaming about this place since I'd strolled past the day before.  The cases were filled with delectables including, croissants, kuoign amann, baguettes, sandwiches and quiches.  Hot coffee drinks and teas covered their drink menu.  I opted for a slice of the quiche lorraine and was ever so glad I did... They warmed the slice up for me and the very kind and friendly woman with the sweet French accent who took my order brought it to me when ready.  It literally melted in my mouth.  Heaven. Pure cream, egg, cheese, ham heaven... I also got myself a couple of ham & cheese croissants to take for the following day, as I expected to be snowed into my hotel  She assured me they would be open despite the weather, but alas, I was not staying in walking distance from the shop (my waistline is probably grateful for that too!) and had to bis adieu... The croissants were also as amazing as expected, flaky and loaded full of rich baked buttery goodness, and left me wondering if I'll ever get to visit my new-found bakery love in the future... If so, I will certainly tell her "Amour de ma vie...Toi et moi, cÃßa ne changera pas"...
2016-01-11,5,Love the baguette it has a lil bit of sour taste which I totally love, the chocolate croissants, rasberry kougin was crispy from outside and latte or coffee is amazing too.
2016-01-06,5,Great place. Customer service and food deserves 5 stars.  I work right around the corner at daniels and close up for 3 min so that i can hurry up and pick up some of my favorite pastries and other freshly baked food.
2016-01-05,5,Simply the best bread and best croissants in town... Better than financier, better than most of the boulangeries in Paris.
2016-01-03,5,I have a great experience at Chocopain. They serve freshly made Chocopain and tarts. Plus, their espressos and cappuccinos are top notch. A perfect way to relax on a Sunday afternoon in a authentic French atmosphere.
2015-11-21,5,Great ambiance especially upstairs! Great bread and chocolate croissant. Legit coffee as well. Will be returning :)
2015-11-18,5,I've been going here since it opened. Best bakery in Hoboken and best French bread in New York Metro area. For you snobs that are whining that Hoboken is in Jersey, well Hoboken is closer to the city than Brooklyn or Queens. And I lived in Manhattan longer than I've lived anywhere in my life (over 15 years). This bread is very close to the best Italian bread I ever had-by the legendary Zito's in Greenwich Village (it was open around 70 years but closed over a decade ago). I am certainly not a French bakery expert, but everyone knows the French set the bar very high on quality. This place has so many customers speaking French, I often close my eyes and pretend I'm in Paris. A tiny bit of Paris in Hoboken. But that's what I've grown to love about Hoboken. It's a tiny little town on the waterfront, where everyone sort of knows everyone, a bunch of awesome old family businesses and history and the best French bakery around.
2015-11-10,3,Food is pretty good. Not French Cafe good but American Pastry shop good. Generally a long line in the morning.
2015-11-03,5,This place is absolutely lovely. I've had sandwiches, their bread, and many of their pastries, and everything has been fresh and delicious. I love their coffee and tea selection too. This has become my favorite place to treat myself and relax. The choco pains are also amazing. I usually can't go there without ordering one.
2015-10-19,5,I'm a total snob about French food, but Choc O Pain is the real deal. (I once brought a French person here who took a bite of the food and said, "Wow, it's really French!") They've got the best bread and croissants in town, excellent tea and coffee, and amazing pastries. They also have a great selection of sandwiches, quiche and other lunch items, and a few fine food products to take home, like very fine jam. The venue is warm and inviting and always has room, and the staff is very friendly. I've never had anything bad there!
2015-10-17,4,My only knock is - why one register in here? On weekends it gets busy, they have 5 people behind the counter and 1 on register duty. The lines get quite long, and waiting 10+ minutes for a simple order. Add 1 more register to speed up service.
2015-09-21,4,There's a reason Yelp considers me a regular, and it's because even when I can make a pretty damn good espresso in my own house, I'd sometimes rather take a quick walk to Choc O Pain. I love their lattes and espresso drinks. They aren't too strong and taste really rich and velvety. I've had one of their specialty quiches and it was savory and delicious. The macaroons are yummy too! My favorite are the salted caramel and vanilla. Soon, I will be back for one of their sandwiches because the bread looks to die for. If you're into croissants, they are a must! Buttery, flaky and could also be sweet depending on which you get. The servers are all super nice, which makes it that much more of a pleasurable experience. There is even a room upstairs for private parties and events!
2015-08-13,1,The food is fairly ok, but the worst customer experience ever.Today it was my first time there and for sure the last one too.I was having breakfast with a group of friends on the children's area above and one of the employees very rudely asked us to pay 15 bucks each or leave because apparently bringing presents to one of my friends was considered a private event, yes it was ridiculous!!!They are lots of good bakeries in the area with excellent customer service please try some other place.
2015-08-13,1,I just can't believe what we just experienced today at this place! A shame, because I used to loved it. The bread and pastries are great! I met with a group of friends. We were 6 women, and we all bought food and drinks, I.e. We all spend more than $15. One of my friends is pregnant, so we all brought presents to her. Well, they asked us to leave because according to them "we were having an event"!!!!! And we were supposed to rent the place if "we were having an event"!!! I mean, since when meeting with your friends for breakfast at a restaurant means you are having an event? Yes, my friend is pregnant and we were giving her presents, so what?! the place was empty anyways and we were buying stuff from them what was the problem?The worst thing is that they gave us 3 options:1) leave 2) pay $15 (more) each just to be there or 3) they will call the copsHa!!!! Seriously?!!! The cops!!! I just can't believe it!This French lady (the owner) just lost 7 good clients and I hope this review makes them loose some more.
2015-08-13,1,We decided to go to Choc O Pain to have breakfast, drink a coffee, capuchino, and have some delicious sandwiches and treats, and while we were in the above area, having fun, somebody from the staff, appeared and told us in a very rude manner to leave the place immediately or they will call the police (as an order from the owner). It was the first time for 5 of the 7 of us and of course we will never come back (even it is amazinly delicious). One of our friend is pregnant so we decided to go there and give her some gifts. We were the only customers there, not making any loud noises. You know, kids friendly place so we brought our kids too. We paid between $15-$30 each and the lady told that because we brought 6 gifts we had to pay extra money to stay there because the owner considered we were having an "event".  So we had to leave and now we are in Panera Bread having a blast. This is not the first time the "owner" reacts in this rude manner, so please be aware of this.
2015-08-04,5,Such a lovely place to stop in for a quick cup of coffee and small desert I love love their chocolate croissant! The Baristas are always friendly and take their time to get your order just right.
2015-07-27,5,This is my happy place. It is tucked away on a quiet side street so  you are not dealing with the traffic on Washington. The staff is very friendly and they offer several great options. Their lunch options are just as good as their pastries and the coffee drinks are even better. I really wish that they would open another location uptown. They do have a stand at the uptown farmers market but that is only once a week when it is nice out.
2015-07-07,4,Addicting chocolate croissants!!! Must have more now amazing.  I did try their almond chocolate croissant too, let me just be very clear it is not and will never be a substitute for their chocolate croissants.  It was ok but can not compete with their chocolate croissants.Their berry tartlette was very good as well. It was well balanced.  I wish there was an option to add whipped cream on top, life is always a little better with whipped cream.Service is on the slow side so do not expect to pop in and out. The servers were friendly but management needs to spend more time thinking about how to maximize efficiency,  it seemed clear to me that they needed a separate for just drinks, and then a line for everything else.
2015-06-27,5,Everything is delicious!! So much love and care baked into everything they make. Really appreciate having a REAL French style bakery/cafe
2015-06-18,5,I love this place. They have the best croissants you've ever had in your life, especially the chocolate filled ones. They are a bit pricey, but it's worth it. It's a great treat to bring in to your coworkers.
2015-06-13,4,Love love this place...feels like your having a snack in your living room. Great food, so fresh and the real deal in French pastries. Try the Petite Kouign...there's nothing like it!
2015-06-08,4,This is a cute little cafe/bakery. I haven't actually spent much time actually in the place as I've just taken stuff to go, but their baked goods are delishhh. The atmosphere is kind of cute/quiet/quaint. They have a small outdoor seating area - never sat out there, but I always see people there for breakfast when I pass by every morning.They have almond croissants that are to die for, but I'm biased because I love croissants of any kind. They also have macarons - you can buy a pack of them and mix and match different flavors :)
2015-06-04,5,Here's what's good: curry chicken sandwich, spicy tuna sandwich, hot chocolate! Large cups are super large and medium is like a large. Free wifi and has two floors upstairs has sofa and kids area
2015-05-17,4,This is a cute little spot with a good selection for a quick bite.  Perfect for weekend breakfast/brunch. Enough room for you to stay in and eat but also very convenient to grab and go. We chose a few things to take out to the waterfront to graze through.-Egg sandwich with spinach and ricotta. I had them toast it.  Bread was a multigrain but had a very slight sweetness to it. So good.  -Croque Monsieur was really good IMHO. The cheese was well done and slightly crisp which is one of my favorite things in the food world. YUM.Also grabbed a couple sweet options which included a choc croissant. Three small, round croissant type pastries - I didn't catch what they were called - each made of raspberry, apple and choc chip. We also got a small apple tart.  All were just enough for two adults with a little leftover. Not bad for $25.Everything tasted fresh and delicious. We'll definitely do breakfast like this again!
2015-05-14,4,Very excited when this place opened in 2011. It has our patisserie loving Hoboken folks clamoring for the best pain au chocolat! It is pretty damn good. I also love their Almond Croissants, and the small little goucheres that are so soft, you can eat them one after another! The coffee is good (La Colombe), although I advise to ask if you can add the milk or cream yourself because they make it too milky in the end and you won't taste the coffee. The best part is, if you want sweetness you have all the choices staring at you from the glass cases --- drool... BUT, if you want savory, there is also the Ham and Cheese Croissant, which I highly recommend. Ask them to only warm it up for about 20 - 30 seconds, so that you can taste the gruyere and the ham deliciously melding in your mouth together... Great place to sit and people watch, but also great to buy and take stuff home!
2015-05-03,5,Always have a hard time locating some coffee store having good yet not too sweet macarons, so finding choc would truly be a remarkable experience. I guess the sweet level also carried to its drinks, hence I was more than happy to enjoy a healthy cup of latte. The best part about it was definitely the location, as it was sitting quietly yet not lonely at the corner. So strongly suggest sitting outside to enjoy the beautiful sunshine. Gonna come back and try its bakery sometime later!
2015-05-01,4,I LOVE their pastries. Sooooo good! Especially the croissants, chouquettes & petite kouigns! The service in the JC location is a bit on the slow side so I do avoid the cafe whenever I see a line but I still visit at least once or twice a week.
2015-04-22,5,A darling little (french--I love the music!) cafe that provides my favorite vegan soups!
2015-04-19,5,I'm pretty sure this place is fairly new but let me tell you they are amazing! They have outdoor seating so you can take advantage of the nice weather while getting a little work done. They have a great selection of small sandwiches and quiches. The curry chicken sandwich looked so delicious it almost made me forget I already ate ;) We gabbed two large lattes, one hot and one cold. Both were awesome. They have a bunch of diff types of milk products so if you are in need of soy they have it, or skim milk like my preference :) The lattes were well made and the barista was quick, I hate long waits for lattes. They totally have a new customer in me.Oh and try the macaroons, they look amazing. So colorful and enticing.Oops guess what I was told they were here for 3 years.... I need to get out more :)
2015-04-15,5,Wonderful French bread and pastries. A little gem in Hoboken. Much better than the cake boss across the street!
2015-04-07,5,Reminds me so much of the cafes I visited during my trip to Paris. The choc o pan is spot on! The upstairs room is a great little spot for kids to play while you enjoy your treats!
2015-04-01,5,AMAZING French pastries. This is my first stop anytime I am in Hoboken. Everything tastes so great and although I haven't tried, their homemade bread looks awesome too.
2015-03-28,3,I like the vibe here.. It's relaxed and laid back .. But not a big fan of the food. I've had better.. I'm not sure where the macarons are from but they're not good at all! I do love their chocolate croissants though .. The right size and not too much chocolate.. The other pastries like kouign Amman were good too.. You can feel the butter oozing out of them loll .. Delish!
2015-03-28,5,Best crossant you can get on this side of the river. chocolate pecan babka was unforgetable. They makes really good quality french pastry.
2015-03-26,3,I stopped in here twice in the past 4 days, once to bring croissants to my grandparents, and another day to get a drink & croissant for my boyfriend. The croissants were pretty good, but the drink (iced maciato was requested- but she made an iced mocha) was spilling all over the cup and she did not even try to clean it she just handed it. The customer service in there is very lack-luster. Both times they did not seem too enthused, nor did they even say thank you both times as well.
2015-03-19,4,Best chocolate croissant ever! I selected the one with almonds! It is delicious! I didn't give 5 stars because of the hot chocolate! It is really bad! Don't order that! They have a lot of bread options! The employees were kind, what is a difficult thing to see in the area! I will come back for sure!
2015-03-10,5,They make an amazing bread pudding! One of the best I've had in a long time!Anyways, this cafe is a true hidden gem in Hoboken. They have a great family style lounge area upstairs with two sets of couches, and a decent size breakfast style table to have your coffee, or even study!Coffee was alright here, but the pastries, macaroons, and sandwiches here are even better!I highly recommend this for anyone, especially for people with little toddlers that wanna chill with a coffee and pastry, while their little one plays upstairs with no fuss or problems of annoying the other patrons/staff in the cafe.
2015-03-08,5,This is an adorable cafe with beautiful little French pastries, fresh baked breads, sandwiches, and coffee. If you need a place to work, there are little tables to the side (hopefully you're not easily distracted, as the cafe tends to get fairly busy). There is also a spacious upstairs area with couches and tables - a perfect place for parents and little children, or for work if it's not too busy. The latte was delicious and went perfectly with the chocolate heaven cake (which was indeed heavenly). The cake is flourless and has a rich, melt in your mouth consistency. SO GOOD!!One tip: don't risk coming if you're in a rush. There's often a lengthy line and not enough staff to keep up so drink and food orders can take some time.
2015-03-02,5,Tucked away on the south side of First Street is a touch of the traditional -- a French cafe run by actual French people staffed with several French people serving French pastries, coffee, sandwiches, quiches, soups, and so on. Little known fact: anything French is kryptonite to the bros and hipsters. So if you're lost in a sea of them, struggling to find solace in the streets of Hoboken, ye shall find it at Choco Pain. The namesake choco pain is delectable yet light, while some other treats are sugary and buttery decadence. It's a great place to meet up with a friend over coffee and a light lunch, and a decent place to get some work done, although downstairs can get pretty busy and tight. There is a nice room upstairs with tables, couches, and coffee tables and, oh oh, kids toys. It's a good place for families with children, and when there are no screaming tykes, it's a nice place to read or work quietly or meet up with more than one friend. This room is available for private parties, btw... If only Jersey City's branch were not such a tiny cavern...
2015-02-18,4,The pastries and bread are delicious! It's not 5 stars because sometimes the pastries are burnt - maybe it's a style of baking? The staff is super, the prices are a little high - but I figure you're paying for the quality.  Plus there's a bonus area for kids on the 2nd floor.
2015-02-17,5,I arrived in Hoboken in the middle of one of those friendly February snow storms during which they close schools and stuff.Choc O Pain was like a little oasis of delicious coffee and baked goods. Jonathan, the barista, was incredibly thoughtful and attentive. The almond latte and chai tea he served me were both perfect to take the edge off of the wintry day. Another nice surprise is that they offer vegan options (like soups and sandwiches)! The place seemed perfect for kids, and everything was kept very clean and tidy (including the restrooms). It's a great place to work, as they offer free wifi and plenty of outlets. Overall, an adorable place for both lunch and dessert cravings- they serve La Colombe coffee and a great selection of delicious teas. The cherry on top is that the service is impressive, and they have little fresh flowers on the tables. I can't wait to visit again.
2015-02-16,4,This is a solid bakery with excellent bread and pastries, and consistently excellent.  The food is on the expensive side but the quality is great.  It is a nice place to meet a friend and chat. There is an upstairs space but somehow I have never ventured upstairs. The coffee is strong and good, but I go here mostly for the baguettes and pastries which are authentically French.  I appreciate they also make seasonal desserts such as Gallette des Rois. And where else can you find sweet chestnut paste in a tube for your homemade crepes?
2015-02-09,5,The combination chocolate + almond croissant is heaven on earth. Other pastries are delicious as well.The tea selection leaves something to be desired, so stick with the coffee. They make an excellent cappuccino.The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and low-key. Love the French maps and pictures on the walls. This is a great place to relax and enjoy a delicious afternoon snack.
2015-02-06,5,I have heard about the birthplace of 'ol blue eyes since I was a child growing up in Brooklyn , New York,  and through the years Hoboken has entered many conversations..........unfortunately, I never made  the effort to see what all the fuss was about...........ok, me bad.Well, recently it was suggested I check out a local French Patisserie named Choc o Pain located on the main "drag" of Hoboken, and I could no longer adopt the stick-n-the-mud posture, so off I went ala Anthony Bourdain, to seek gastronomic enlightenment:-)I initially had only pastry in mind, but I indulged in a humongous/super delicious spicy Tuna sandwich on some of the best artesian bread I have ever had the pleasure to consume!........and folks, the bread gives my 'holy-grail' Paneantico, in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn a run for it's money!!.........if you are here for lunch, you must have this!!Also sampled were delicious almond croissant(s) and tiny delicious brioche buns!Espresso on par with the best Italian eateries.One additional thing.............forget the hassle of driving the car here and attempting to find a parking space...........just take the Path here and enjoy!!
2015-01-29,4,Still holding up. Although the wifi needs to be worked on. Blocks some sites due to firewall and is hard to link into on the second floor.
2015-01-28,4,GREAT bread and pastries, but definitely pricey. I guess you get what you pay for though.
2015-01-19,4,This is a great neighborhood bakery to grab a cup of coffee or a light bite to eat. The food is great and prepared daily. I'll be back for sure! (Try the spicy tuna sandwich... Delicious!)
2015-01-06,5,The cappuccino is so good! And we ordered these apple round things (I'm sorry don't know the name of the pastry) all I have to say is I wish I ordered a dozen to take home! They were bigger than munchkins and smaller that a croissant but round and delicious!  Will definitely skip Starbux and come here when in Hoboken. And the service is so wonderful! So respectful and polite. Considerate and professional.
2015-01-02,5,Came in for a quick coffee after a few of my friends and I had gotten manicures across the street. It's a super cute French bakery.Coffee was great and so were their macaroons! Seating is limited which may be a problem if you have a group greater than 3 people. Would definitely come back.
2015-01-01,1,Overpriced and terrible customer service. Charging for water for a baby is a red line for me, I wouldn't even give it a star - we won't be coming back here
2014-12-30,3,I'm a newbie to the Hoboken area and was looking for a cafe to meet a friend. We found this gem on Yelp and decided to give it a try.Notes:  1. I ordered a Hot Chocolate and a Croissant.  2. I received a chocolate pastry and a bitter Hot Chocolate. I'm guessing the cashier didn't hear me because she was preoccupied talking to other guests - probably a regular.   3. I wish they had warned me that he hot chocolate was BITTER otherwise I wouldn't have ordered it.   4. Loved the ambiance and free wifi.  I'm not too sure if I'll come back. I liked the pastry it was flaky and soft, a nice surprise. I thought it would be hard and chewy.
2014-12-29,4,Cute cozy place. I've been here a few times and I've only tried their chocolate croissants and coffee. Only reason why I took off one star was because of how pricey it is for the size of the food.
2014-12-27,2,The wife had this bookmarked since she works in Hoboken and had always wanted to try. With two kids in tow, we were in need of something warm to drink and maybe a little something to satisfy a sweet tooth craving. Place is really quaint, cozy and inviting, with people of all ages and walks of life communing. There is adequate seating on the ground floor, with additional seating upstairs if the kids get loud. Check. We ordered a couple of hot chocolates, figuring these had to be good given the cafe's namesake. Fail. I'm not sure what happened, but the first sip produced such a bitter taste in my mouth, literally. I gave it a second swig, thinking maybe it was just the foam. Still bitter. I don't mind my dark chocolate to be a little strong, this was just a combination of bitter and lack of flavor, if that makes sense. I threw it out after that second swig, too worried to go back and ask for another one because one of the kids was in pre meltdown mode. On the recommendation of one of the workers, I also tried a chocolate short bread pastry. She told me it was chewy, which I don't mind. But this thing could've cracked one of my teeth, it was that rock hard and inedible. Fail again.Place gets two stars because the macaroons were good and we were digging the ambiance.
2014-12-11,4,I agree with other Yelpers-- the croissants are flaky and absolutely delicious. I almost don't mind the pounds... almost. Their other desserts are great as well. However, I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the unfriendliness of the staff (perhaps it was just a bad day for her?) and the steep price. The price is something I'm willing to overlook because everything is so damn yummy. However, this weird passive-aggressive attitude I got from one of the staff? No.
2014-12-07,1,I've gone to this Choc O Pain in Hoboken for years--it's pleasant enough. Not amazing, as the food tends to be on the bland side--even the desserts. Or the  desserts are over-baked and this is a  pricey cafe. Frankly, it's a bit over-rated simply because there is no other similar establishment. That is why I have gone there all these years -out of convenience. Also the owner is so nice--and it's a shame. I am never going back there again. Last week I bought a quiche slice for breakfast, and decided to also buy their egg and ricotta sandwich for lunch. I rush to grab the 12PM- 126 bus to Port Authority to catch an upstate NY bus commute for 2 hours, and thought it would be nice to get lunch beforehand to take on 2-hour bus. I could see the sandwich had no dressing--(remember I said the food tends to be bland,) and so, I asked for mayo on the side. I spent 5 MINUTES arguing with a server about mayo!  First she said-they "don't have those little packets." I was peeved-- I knew I was not in McDonald's. I said patiently--"Yes, I know, but you can put it in a small container. Then she said "We don't have those containers!" Then she said, "We don't have mayo."  I said. "I can't believe this." I explained the sandwich was without dressing looked pretty dry. I said "I will pay for it."  I pulled out a dollar. She said "I would not even know what to charge you." finally she said --let me see what I can do. She went in the backI explained to the cashier -that "I was relieved that the server was going to bring mayo for my sandwich because she had said initially -that they had none."  The cashier acted as if she was really sorry.  "I am so sorry,"  the cashier sighed--shaking her head sadly, -"She's right. We don't have mayo. We have a vinaigrette."  But the server was walking towards me with a tiny container of mayo! I said "Sure--you do --she's bringing it!"  The cashier disappeared after the server with the mayo and the server reappeared but with oil and vinegar.   The mayo was gone.  I was so upset--all this dishonesty---and fuss ---and lying over a  TEASPOON OF MAYO------I grabbed the sandwich so as not to be late for work..  I immediately called on my cell -to speak to the owner who was not there. I complained--"Why did the cashier TAKE AWAY the mayo? I have come here for years."  "Okay next time you come---we'll give it to you."  was the response.  Another lie?   I said--"I am right here. I can take it now." 20 minutes after originally asking for mayo--I finally got it. But I could still hear a male in the kitchen saying "Tell her there isn't any." The irony was -I wound up getting stomach cramps  over the quiche--I guess it was too rich? And 2 hours later, the oil and vinegar spilled over the sandwich--- I never got to use the mayo, and the bread part was surprisingly like an Italian-like bread.  Without it--the sandwich was just awful---just think of unseasoned fried  underdone egg white and unseasoned ricotta--and their combined similar textures--on bread. Bland as hell.  Ordinarily I would go back and buy the bread and vinaigrette--But the dishonesty--and wasted time over a stupid teaspoon of mayo to perk up a sandwich-that I was willing to pay for. That left a bad taste. And the cashier actually taking away the mayo after lying and saying there was none. And after I waited for it. I'd been a customer for  almost a decade. Thy charged me 54 cents for the mayo..NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN. CLEARLY IT WAS WORTH IT TO THE STAFF TO LOSE A CUSTOMER OVER 54 CENTS.
2014-12-05,4,Little Paris gem in Hoboken.  When I am in the mood for macaroons place to go.
2014-11-17,1,Walked in today only to be welcomed by a scolding and odd service. The two women at the counter were so rude to my colleagues and me, barking and passively attempting to correct my pronunciation--not that they were right either. I was really caught off guard because I've never experienced this before. I've found the service here to be warm and so friendly usually, but these new faces really disappointed us. Actually, I was quite stunned. This isn't the Choc O Pain that I fell for. It will be some time until I come back again and I hope that there will be some changes to that kind of hospitality soon.
2014-11-07,5,The croissants are the closest you'll get to Paris in Jersey. The upstairs has a lovely home vibe. Very rare you find authentic cafes in this area. I've been told the owner herself hails from Paris. No suprise everything is so parfait!
2014-11-02,5,I've known about this great gem of a place since it opened and have loved it from the beginning, but I've recently rediscovered it (I live on the other side of town) and had forgotten just how good it is. Brother, it's that good.Nothing in the area comes close to its bread. It has that super hard crust that you just never find in Jersey. Absolutely the best. The pastries and croissant are completely delicious. The almond and almond/chocolate croissant in particular - wholly moly!The place is quiet and relaxing and I just can't say enough good things about it. It's definitely worth me getting an Uber for.
2014-11-01,5,OMG.  I'm a Francophile.  Have had the great fortune of going to Paris and other parts of France 13 times so far.  Hopefully more to come in this lifetime.  Yet there is no greater treat than walking 1.5 blocks from my apartment in Jersey City to a bakery that when you walk through the doors, brings me right into the sensory experience of walking into a boulangerie in Paris.  When you walk through the door, it smells like butter is oozing from every inch of the place.  My only complaint is that it's super expensive, but I am willing to pay for the experience in moderation.  The warm chocolate croissants in the morning, quiche Lorraine, soups are just incroyable.
2014-10-24,3,Its all about the fresh bread here. Other than that it's nothing exceptional. Been here four times. I find it pricey unless you don't mind paying ANYTHING for fresh bread. Let's just say it's not my cuppa Cappuccino!  Btw. I spent money here four times only because the ppl I went with were raving about it and always insisted on this place. I went along just to oblige. Let's just say it's not a place I crave to eat at.
2014-10-15,4,I love coming here and discussing life and life-related things with my significant other. I rave not just about the quaint ambiance, friendly staff, or the delicious chocolate almond croissant, but recently I had my first experience with the ham and cheese croissant and holy moly was that an experience worth opening Yelp and writing about. The only opportunity for improvement I can think of is the coffee. I usually order the latte, and I find that it lacks the aroma and texture that I crave.
2014-10-15,4,Great coffee shop and it's near my apartment, great-great! Very clean and cute coffee shop. They have free WiFi so it's definitely a nice spot to study or read while you enjoy a cup of coffee and a pastry. I was only in the mood for cappuccino so I didn't get a chance to try their food yet. I will be back because I'm dying to taste some of their pastries!
2014-10-07,4,Excellent baguettes, croissants and coffee. Pastries and sandwiches are overpriced but they are the only French bakery around and can charge what they like. I can live with that. My only complaint is that their almond chocolate croissants get smaller by the week.
2014-09-25,3,I'm a regular here and I wish I could give more stars because their coffee and pastries are worth 4-5 stars, but the service is so incompetent and slow.  I come in about 3x per week and it's a rare occasion that I only have to say my order once, they charge the correct amount and I receive what I ordered.  And even more rare that I get my order in a timely manner.  I can't count the # of times that I'll see someone open the door, see that there are more than 3 people in line then walk out.  They could probably double their revenue if staff was efficient and competent.
2014-09-09,2,I used to love this place and I still think the coffee and food are delicious but the service is SO SLOW!  And now they charge 50 cents for Almond Milk? That is just a rip off. Just not worth it.
2014-09-08,5,I moved to NY 6 days ago and while staying with a friend in Hoboken I decided to venture out to find a cozy coffee spot with wifi. I was thrilled to have found choc o pain not only because I love all things French, but  because the coffee and bakery here is AMAZING. I have already been here three times in less than a week! The service is quick and the staff is very friendly. Bon appeÃÅtit.
2014-08-24,4,Just like the other reviews have said the ham and cheese croissant is delicious. I just wish it had more ham in it. The croissant was among the best I've ever had, buttery, flaky and melts in your mouth. This place looks so cute inside, everything looks like it's going to taste amazing. I will have to go back soon!
2014-08-16,5,Excellent real crusty bread and no sponge offered as bread like in so many places. Loved the berry tartlet with a good coffee in a REAL mug. Not cheap but definitely worth every cent
2014-08-09,5,We go here every. Single. Day. Pastries are at true, authentic, Paris-level. Very friendly staff. We literally cannot live without this place. Superb!
2014-08-05,5,Came in for a cup of coffee after lunch next door at the sushihouse.Had an espresso and a chocolate croissant.Outstanding.
2014-07-31,5,The perfect cafe. Delicious food, a soothing, classy atmosphere and outstanding service complement awesome free wifi!
2014-07-13,4,Great range of pastries. Good brioches and pains au chocolat. Decent prices (except for the sandwiches) and great space on the first floor for kids.
2014-07-12,4,Coffee-shop feel with a focus on baked goods. Quality, but you are definitely paying for it. Hard to walk out of there feeling like you got a good deal; maybe Sunday morning spot.Got the ham and cheese croissant - croissant was light and buttery with a hint of ham, cheese was a bit absent in the taste.Macaroons - pranline and salted caramel. They were very moist. At some places the macaroons you get are hard, almost like a cracker. Kind of like the difference between cookies straight out of the oven and after 2 days - these are straight out of the oven. Praline was my favorite, salted caramel was a bit sweet for my taste
2014-06-28,2,They have Starbucks prices but not the Starbucks service . They are all giggling and talking in the back and they forget to help the customers . I had to ask if my iced latte was ready and they were like o I was in lala land didn't even see we had an order ! The pastry was good and coffee ok but service needs improvement !
2014-05-28,5,this place is a gem. love everything about it. I love their ham and cheese croissant. the almond croissant is perfection. the quiches are great. I especially like the honey fruit croissant blob things... I have no idea what they're called but the raspberry is heavenly. I love that they offer agave and the people working there always are nice, helpful and seem to enjoy workin with eachother. must be good management. when it comes to the sandwiches they're all good. my favorite is the chicken curry. you've gotta try that one if u like curry. and then there's this seasonal sandwich I had a while back and haven't seen in well over a year or two but I ask about it every time I go.. it was this whipped feta with blasamic figs and some other stuff. 100% the BEST vegetarian sandwich I've ever had. this sandwich needs to be on the regular menu. it's soooooo good
2014-05-13,4,My search for a nice french bakery is over! Everything is so good you cant go wrong. Loved every minute of quite time I shared with my delicious cappuccino and treats. Must try!
2014-05-13,5,I think I'm in love with this place! I was looking for a place I could study, and decided to venture to Hoboken! 1) amazing place to study! Relatively spacious, free wifi, clean restroom, and unlike many other places, they don't mind if you stay there for a couple of hours to study! What more can you ask for?2) I've read other reviews concerning their customer service.. And I must say my experience here has been quite pleasant. Especially the gentlemen working there. Gave me many recommendations, and even asked if I need water while I was studying! 3) prices here are just a little expensive, but I think it's worth it for the quality of the food/the experience you get here. Just for a sense of how much things are... These are just approximate valuesChocolate croissant ~$3Small coffee ~$2Quiche ~$6 Check out upstairs, and try their chocolate croissant!
2014-05-07,3,I like the ambiance and the whole idea of this place.  It definitely reminds me of some cafes in Paris.  Being gluten free, there is not much I can eat here.  I know that they have a GF pastry or two, but have not tried them as of yet.  The coffee was just OK.  Im not sure if its good coffee or not.  It could just be me, but I was not in love with the coffee (I felt that way in Paris too).  I did take one bite of the banana sourdough bread.   It was freakin amazing... If only it was gluten free...
2014-05-04,4,Do come here for their pastries! The peach tart was amazing. Chocolate croissant was very delicious. The staff is nice. The coffee was OK... I've had better. Theirs was a bit too mild and light, closer to a Dunkin Donuts. Guess you don't really come here for the coffee, just the awesome pastries.
2014-04-16,4,Super cute little cafe... Very adorable. Reminds me of something from Europe however, it's a bit pricey as others have commented....
2014-03-21,2,I had a chocolate almond croissant and a few macaroons and both were terrible.  The croissant was so dry and old. The macaroons did not taste like macaroons but they were certainly priced like them. This place is a joke.
2014-03-15,3,I'm a regular at Choc O Pain, when I first discovered this spot I was obsessed, you can't deny their pastries and coffee. I will say the service has started to disappoint me over the past few months. Order a latte and they give you the wrong drink, my ham and cheese croissant is cold in the middle- always!, snotty baristas for some comical reason and it's starting to make me want to turn to a different cafe. Overall- great food but the service for a chic "French cafe" is enough to make the food start to taste a little dry and tasteless.
2014-03-13,4,Choc O Pain has good cappuccinos  (prices are slightly cheaper compared to Starbucks).Their croissants  are amazing! The Macarons weren't good the first time,however after giving them a second try they were much better.I had an issue with a purchase and my card. Throughout the process the manager was polite and refreshingly helpful. She even followed up with me! That's rare these days. Overall cute place, and a nice menu selection. I hope to try a few more items some time soon.
2014-03-09,4,This is one of best gems in Hoboken. Great coffee, and croissants are killer! Most ppl would say the almond croissants or choco-pain are the best, but I personally would recommend the banana sourdough. Don't leave with out it!!  Nice home like feel upstairs to sit and eat as well.
2014-03-04,5,WHY IS THIS SO HIDDEN? I was using Yelp to find a bakery in Hoboken and was surprised to see this joint off the well-trodden path of Washington St. So the boyfriend and I made our way over.It was pretty busy in there, but there were ample breads available. After asking the server what she recommended and getting "everything!" (thanks, Unhelpful Ulga), I decided to just bite the bullet and try a few things: a croissant, a banana sourdough, and, of course, the chocopain.The croissant was decidedly good. The layers perfectly filled with butter and cooked to that delightful border between chewy and crisp. The banana sourdough was pretty good as well, but that bread was tough. Like seriously. It was delicious though. The piece-de-resistance was the chocopain. Perfect: the croissant filled with (almost)bittersweet chocolate.
2014-02-17,4,Can't authenticate this place more than being greeted by a Parisian and then being followed by a French family, apparently this place was transported from France. Because I decided to stay, I had a perfect latte in a cute cup followed by drool-worthy chocolate croissant warmed up in the toaster oven. So delicious, I am contemplating getting treats for later!Nice communal table in the back to get some reading done. According to the other reviews there is an upstairs seating area.
2014-02-15,5,Let me start by saying this place can be very expensive.  However, outside of NYC this place is exquisite. Simply the best pastries, coffee, bread and and sandwiches. Everything is done correctly like in the European tradition. I can't say enough.When I'm in the area it's always my first stop. I feel like I'm in Paris when I'm there as this place I think is also owned by a French couple. I love it and the best in NJ. Period!
2014-01-31,4,Can you say choc-o-heaven?? Who doesn't like bread, butter, cheese, chocolate?? Put it all together and you get the yumminess that is faux-Paris in hobo. Take a stroll down first street, and find yourself getting lost in the delectables you loved in Paris...
2014-01-15,5,From my french point of view, this place has very good products. The tartes (sweet like the apple and the apricot tartes or salty like the quiches) are pretty much what you would get in a parisian bakery. I also tried the Croissant and the Pain au Chocolat. Same observation. If you like french bakery, you'll love this place.
2014-01-14,5,Ever since my husband and I went to Paris we have been going to Choc O Pain in Hoboken get that "Je ne sais quois" Parisian feeling. Not many cafeÃÅs nearby like it. It's pretty authentic to the cafeÃÅs in Paris. Everything is fabulous there especially the almond chocolate chocopain.
2014-01-09,5,I lived in Paris for 2 years and can tell you with confidence that these baked goods from New Jersey are just as good as the best in France.  I feel like a Parisian again bringing home a baguette under my arm each night to accompany  my dinner, or running out in the morning looking less than magnifique to scoop up a buttery croissant.  So grateful an authentic French establishment like this has graced us New Jersyites with its crusty, buttery goodness. The cafe-like atmosphere is cozy and cute to boot.Vive la Choc-o-pain: On y va!Oh I almost forgot: the QUICHE! The quiche lorraine is insane. Do yourself a favor and get this...
2014-01-04,3,Decent place...though a little overpriced. We had a mocha, latte and a choc o pain. We were thinking of going to Starbucks but wanted a change so went here. We prefer the mocha at Starbucks though.
2013-12-29,5,If chocolate croissant were a religion, choc o pain would be Vatican City. I had parked the car and was going to cross the street to go to Wonder Bagel for a cup of awful coffee, but the light was against me.  I turned around and there it was, maybe 4 storefronts off Columbus. I was overwhelmed with great breads and pastries as soon as I walked in and knew I found someplace special. I bought a pear tart for a Christmas eve visit that night. Very well received!  I also bought an olive loaf and a rustic apricot and nut loaf. Both strong breads with tremendous character.  Their breads range from simple boules to very create shapes. The topper? Best cup of coffee I've had in a long while. There was plenty of room for me to sit down to enjoy it, but I had to run to work. But not before telling my girlfriend we had a new "must hit" place. I think we agree that Cocoa is great for sweets and choc o pain is amazing for a little more sophisticated and less sugary items.
2013-12-23,5,While visiting family in NJ we stayed at the W and Choc O Pain was very close by! Close enough for my husband and I to eat breakfast here 3 out of the 5 days we were in Hoboken. It was amazing. The customer service is spot on and the ambiance is amazing. I loved the open view into the kitchen.Several times I had the quiche. Yum. Their ham and cheese croissants though were probably my favorite!!! So delicious. The cappuccino's were very good. Overall, my favorite little spot in Hoboken for breakfast and coffee. Very close to the Path also which is convenient.
2013-12-01,4,Delicious pastries! Just had an almond chocolate croissant and it was AMAZING! definitely recommend getting that!!! Super cute place and great to meet up with a friend :)
2013-11-29,3,Just returned home from my 2nd trip to this place. I went mainly because it is literally the ONLY place in Hoboken that has an inside play area for toddlers where the parents can sit and watch while drinking a cup while having a bite to eat all at the same time. The Pros: *You can bring your babies and toddlers UPSTAIRS (duh, first time the staff saw me chasing my baby around, yet never told me "hey, upstairs we have a baby PLAY AREA)*Has a changing table inside the bathroom*Has wide variety of hot + cold beverages (delish hot coco, coffee, tea) and "freshly squeezed" OJ etc*Has room to park your stroller inside*Has loads of tasty but very unhealthy pastries *Has healthy salads*Does NOT have a TV. Amen. The Cons:*Toddler area upstairs is FILTHY AS FUCK (I am 100% sure they have never cleaned it since they opened 2 years ago- germ-a-phobe NIGHTMARE*Hmmm, they know it is a BABY/TODDLER play area upstairs yet have lots of unprotected electric outlets that toddlers continue to probe with random objects. Put the dam safety plugs in them please before someone gets toasted!!*It is dark and dreary upstairs like a seedy night club. One lamp, that sits dangerously on a low table, does not even have a light bulb in it. Turn the fucking lights on people (or perhaps they keep it dark so no one can really see how filthy it is?) *The Bathroom smells atrocious. Holy fuck. Even my toddler holds his breath when we go into the bathroom there*It is expensive as HELL. Seriously, get a grip. *The staff is snotty (just like the other reviews say, I am backing them up, the staff seriously need an attitude adjustment). I was thinking, since I have been to France several times and found the French to be very arrogant and snotty, perhaps the owner tells the staff "I want this place to be authentic. Lets keep it filthy and arrogant, with a dash of "snotty" Merci"Bring LOTS of hand sanitizer and be ready to defend yourself at the counter when you order and pay. The staff does NOT give a toss!
2013-11-10,5,Great almond croissants. Sat outside with my dog on a Saturday morning, which was really relaxing!
2013-10-28,4,The place is really really nice. When you walk in, there are plenty of tables to sit at and enjoy your coffee/latte with a tasty pastry. The workers are friendly and helpful. I wasn't thrilled about my soy latte though but I will have to return to try other drinks. It had a burn taste to it but their croissant with chocolate in it made up for it. I went to the upstairs room which looks like a cozy apartment with couches and comfy seats. It's adorable. I do plan on returning to experience more of what this Hoboken cafe has to offer.
2013-10-25,4,I absolutely adore Choc O Pain! It has delicious coffee and pastries. The croissants are some of the best that I've ever had in the USA. The almond chocolate croissant is so delicious. The ham and cheese croquette is also super yummy. I love both their iced and hot coffees. The service isn't always the MOST friendly but the staff isn't rude either. It's mostly just business as usual in the NYC area...The menu is a little hard to read so mostly I would just look in the pastry case and point to what looked the most delicious.It can get pretty busy on the weekends and they make the pastries mostly in house so when they run out, they are out for the day. There is a lovely upstairs area with shabby chic/antique chairs and tables for lounging. I've often come here with a friend and a good book and lost the morning : )There is outside seating when the weather allows and it is conveniently located on First street just a few blocks from the PATH. It opens at 7 am during the week, which sometimes wasn't early enough for me on the way to work but I still love it anyways. I'll definitely return to Choc O Pain whenever I'm in Hoboken!
2013-10-19,4,We had spinach goat cheese quiche, macaroons(salty caramel, coffee, chocolate, pistachio) and cafe au lait. Quiche was great, caramel and pistachio macaroons were delicious, chocolate and coffee macaroons were ok and the coffee was good   Pros:The interior design is beautifulFood is deliciousI liked the fact that they are loyal to French cuisineCons:Just a bit expensiveThe menu is hard to readService was okay but it'd be better to have a proper waiter rather than self service
2013-09-26,5,Fabulous bakery! Felt like I was truly back in France, even if only for a moment!Service was quick and friendly (even with the long line, which is always appreciated). Definitely try their croissants! (Chocolate almond was the fave of the group!) And the quiche was amazing (must try the Lorraine). We took home about a dozen macaroons and loved each one.Be sure to hit them up if you're ever in the area!
2013-09-16,4,It's a little expensive,  but the food is delicious, the coffee if great, and the service has always been friendly. I personally couldn't afford to go there regularly,  but it's always a nice treat when I do.I particularly like the baguettes, the croque-monsieur, and the croissants.
2013-09-15,4,Chocolate croissant - $2.90, 3.5/5 very good quality of chocolate, about 3~4 bite sizesAlmond croissant - $3.10, 4/5, the almond paste is excellent, you can taste the liquor added, again 3~4 bite sizesFinancier - $2.95, 4/5, as good as Maison kayser, only two bite sizes Walnut & Raison Sourdough - 3.5/5, $5.95, good bread, but considering walnut and raison, it is a on bland side.I think overall the pastry is excellent, but the price would have been fine, it they made a standard size. all the pastry is about 50~60% of regular pastries, which makes their pastries about twice more expensive.
2013-09-14,1,WORST customer service!!! Terrible experience both times I have attempted to go here. And overpriced for ok food. Not worth it, go somewhere else.
2013-09-13,4,It sincerely pains me to give Choc O Pain four stars because their coffee and food is so good and fresh! This used to be my go-to spot for coffee and breakfast when I lived on 2nd and Bloomfield. It was part of my walk to the train station and it was always a pleasure walking in. I forget her name, but the older lady who consistently took my order was one of the sweetest people I've ever met. A few months ago I walked back in after not being by there in a long time, and a lot of the staff changed. My favorite lady was gone and the younger woman working the cash register gave me completely unfounded attitude for wanting to use my credit card. I don't ever recall there being a ten dollar minimum in the past, and I was so turned off by this that I walked out of the place. I'm sure the coffee and food still taste the same based on looking through the glass but quality of staff really can change a place overnight.
2013-09-07,4,It's a cozy and lovely little place for breakfast. There are a few tables outside, several downstairs and more upstairs.The chocolate croissant and the almond croissant are delicious as well as the mushroom quiche. The coffee is really nice and the sandwiches are very good too.It's a little pricey but a nice treat every now and then. A great little spot all around.
2013-09-01,3,I regularly stop in this adorable cafe for the delicious french macaroons and iced tea, but I won' t be coming back to use the "free" wifi.  Giving them 3 stars instead of 4 for the hassle I went through today.  They advertise free wifi so I came in to get some work done, but they actually only offer free wifi for up to 4 people (after that you're out of luck) so I had to pack up and head somewhere else.  The employees couldn't help, but hopefully they'll provide the feedback I had to the manager.
2013-08-19,4,Great little French bakery in the Heart of Hoboken. The washroom was clean but smelled. However, I'm sure the smell was due to my unlucky timing of using the washroom.
2013-08-16,4,This my go-to weekend coffee spot. Tasty and consistent all around. I love both the sweets (chocolate-almond croissant) and the savories (egg sandwich).One word of advice though- always order your coffee to go! The mugs are all chipped and dirty and rather pitiful. But at least the coffee is awesome!
2013-08-14,4,It's a lovely spot. Coffee isn't that special, but the breads and croissants more than make up for it. Also: I've ordered in French here so that's not just a marketing gimmick.
2013-08-08,5,This place is great! The coffee is delicious and the pastries are amazing! Do not leave without getting a croissant... Also Michelle, one of the employees was super friendly : )
2013-07-26,5,Well, I have been itching to write this review for some time. It used to be my daily stopping place when i lived in Hoboken just by Choc O Pain and after moving into NYC I very badly miss the place. The best time to get the best stuff at about 8-10 am. The croissants are very very flaky buttery and yum. The chocolate almond croissant to me is their star, fantastic almond paste, tastes true to almond and exceedingly delish. I have tried almost all french bakeries in NYC in search of a substitute and well there has been none yet forcing me to have to take the path train to get my fav choc almond croissant. Clemence i guess has managed to get the best croissants made near NYC, not trying to make an over statement here. The hot chocolate they make is also fantastic i must say. The banana bread is YUM too, something that is unique to them. Financiers sometimes come out too dry but they are more or less ok. The olive bread can be a winner with the right things on the table too. And one should take a trip to Choc O Pain during epiphany for their Galette des Rois. How I wish it  was epiphany all year long! With Patrick - the head baker at Choc O Pain, jenna (now at jersey city), michelle, and the others its a wonderful place to eat. Hard to find and negatives but somehow la'colombe does not rate as the best coffee and that can be bettered. Also u should know french as they play only french music.As i write this i am thinking to take the train there.
2013-07-24,2,Not what I expected. After reading rave reviews on Yelp I headed over. The wait was interminable - a few people left in frustration. The coffee was ok - nothing out of the normal. However, the ham and cheese croissant was really sad: it tasted industrial, perhaps a day old or so, with very little hand and cheese. To boot: heated up in a microwave. Yuck. Ah: and the WiFi worked not. Oh well.
2013-07-18,5,The first time I tasted a real croissant in the US after 5 years living in NY/NJ. Yay!I am so happy for this place :)) The ambience, the pastries, the super yummy tuna sandwhich!!!Yum yum yum. Thank you Choc O Pain xo
2013-07-18,4,A delish Choc-o-pain and an iced coffee made a great treat for a Tuesday afternoon.
2013-07-07,5,I'd probably be in this place all day if I lived a bit closer. The selection of pastries is huge and it's a genuinely sweet French cafe. I tried the crime bruÃÇleÃÅe and it's seriously addictive: perfect size, amazing crust on top, well-balanced. I love that all their pates are mismatched because it creates a cool homey feel. The second floor has great tables and couches, so it's a great spot to work away from home or have business meetings. I've never seen a line here even though COP is super popular. The staff is friendly and cool. Only thing that is a bit problematic is the the age is on the pricier side, but well worth it.
2013-07-07,4,Viva Choc O Pain!  I've only been here a few times so far, mainly because I live on the other end of town.  If I lived closer I'd be here all the time, for sure.  Why?  Because of the great food, coffee and atmosphere.To date I've only tried the espresso-based drinks, not the iced or regular coffee.  Cappucinos and lattes are some of the best in town:  rich and delicious espresso served under a thick, velvety layer of microfoamed milk.  The large is quite large - gotta be 20 oz., maybe more - and if you order in, drinks are served in beautiful china mugs.  Which is fitting, because the atmosphere inside is so pleasing, characterful and genteel.  They've managed to make the shop look like it's been around for 100 years (in a good way), which is a nice trick considering it's so new.  For eats, I've only sampled the choc o pain (yeah, it was so good that I just kept getting the same thing on repeat visits, couldn't help myself), but based on what my eyes and other reviews tell me, there are lots of other things I'd like to try.Bonus points for the large onsite kitchen / bakery, which ensures everything is absolutely fresh.Holding things at four stars for now solely because there are so many items I haven't tried, but I wouldn't be surprised if, after further review, this place vaults up to a full five.  I'm looking forward to doing the necessary research ;-)
2013-07-04,4,Really great to have a true French bakery in Hoboken. Nice atmosphere too. While most things are really top notch, especially the galettes I will say that there were several times that the pain au raisin was mushy when it should have been crisp and several occasions where the almond croissants were so hard, they bordered on stale. When it comes to these two items specifically, I head to Red Lion on 14th and Bloomfield. They don't bake but they do bring most things in from Balthazar Bakery and every bite of their pastry will crackle with goodness.
2013-06-30,3,A little standoffish -- comes with the French vibe, I guess.Coffee is good. Not sure how I feel about the mugs -- some are bigger than others and yet you pay the same price. It wasn't explained to me that they offer a large when I paid (I initially asked for a medium.) Also they charge full price for refills.The sandwich I had was a chicken curry on white bread. This was VERY good but if they offered it on a roll it would have been more appropriate. The upstairs is pretty unique. They have couches and lounge chairs etc. Whatever music they play (sounds like something out of a French New Wave movie from the 1960s) is pretty obnoxious.
2013-06-27,5,I loved the choc-o-pain croissants! The ambience is warming ! I luvd it :)
2013-06-26,4,20 minutes after my flight arrived from Paris, I was sitting in this place and feeling like I had extended my trip.  Very high quality french pastries and bread, great coffee in an unusually comfortable place.  Nice folks and lovely getaway in busy Hoboken.
2013-06-24,4,I got a Brioche loaf here and man, it made my chicken salad sanwich SO good. The bread was a great combo of toasty on the outside,and buttery and soft on the inside. At $7 for the loaf though, I can't justify buying this all the time.
2013-06-16,5,Bonjour Choc O Pain! OUI! OUI! Finally tried this place my lover constantly raves about. YOU SURE I haven't taken you to Choc O Pain?!? I'M SURE. YOU SURE? CHOC O PAIN?I'm sure.........And so we end up here. My intention is to get an iced Americano and nothing more but even with a glass case half full of pastries on a Sunday afternoon holding on for dear life,  the pastries were enticing. And since my lover is on a not-so-secret mission to make me fat despite my love of fitness, he probed me to get the gluten-free chocolate cake. Um OK, OK. Maybe it didn't take much probing. I kept looking at it salivating. HELL YES I want chocolate cake. Anyway, the Americano was great. Good espresso. I think they serve one of my fave coffee brands (Colombe). However I didn't like the ice they use.. It's tiny and melts awfully quick. The cake was rich but not overwhelming or overly filling. Just right & light. Delish! Ambiance is relaxing. The french music playing in the background (Is that French Pandora?!) and the ample seating makes this place a lovely idea cafe to sit and have a great chat with a friend or a lover- your choice! Definitely a good place for coffee. Iced Americano: $2.70.
2013-06-08,4,a little bit pricey, but the coffee and pastries are good. They have an upstairs area where you can sit and even toys for kids to play with! There's a childproof gate at the top.... I didn't know how to use it either, kids!
2013-06-02,5,OH HELLO! And Welcome to Jersey City!  At first taste I am 100% in LOVE with this place...When you walk in the array of baked goods is over whelming and you can feel your taste buds screaming for everything on the menu.  Visually everything looks fresh, homemade non-mass produced with natural rustic appeal that I can eat for ever.  I had the almond pastry sprinkled with powered and a coffee and was satisfied starting my Sunday morning with a smile.   Staff is friendly and prices are reasonable as plenty of seating.   I am so so so happy to see this establishment in DT JC.  yeah there are plenty of other bakeries but this has rustic, euro country  (shabby chic - as someone else put it)  vibe...... if you do not like this place chances are you been going to Carlo's too long.
2013-05-31,1,A very sad example of pour management with a lot of attitude and the unfortunate fact of having to pay $10 for a sandwich that spills all over you because the bread its too tick and the barrista's have no clue on how to cut it or warm it up. There is a plentiful of potential in both location Hoboken and Jersey city. but the owner has done nothing of hiring underpaid employees without a single tiny bit of training. Attitude behind the bar is a must for them. they wont even smile as a courtesy. and the Credit card minimum charge of $10 in a metropolitan area is an absolute minus. many times i try to take my clients to the space and eat, there is no even service for the table, actually there is a note on every table seat, asking you to clean after yourself. Not even Starbucks does it. Serving pre-made food, specially for a daily operation is bad bad business. it lacks on quality even if it taste good. does not matter to the Metro clientele that would like not to pay $7 for a slice of Quiche or $4 for a croissant. You are not a NYC operation and you are not required to charge that much money for a steamy tong burned cappuccino. I found a friend of mine training the staff behind the bar a while back, and I ask if there was room for improvement, the answer was a shake head for a sign of discouragement. If you go in either location, often, at any time of the day, some of the items are out of stock. not sure why, since they don't really do that much business. The PLUS about these locations are - the decor. very provencal, nice setting but, it lacks on ALL the other details and attention to customer service it does not matter at all. its like driving a ferrari without wheels on it.its a Shame, a big shame, toke me 9 visits mix at both location to finally decide to say something publicly, and I hope this message gets to the owner point to take some serious action on this matter.
2013-04-25,5,I think this might be favorite cafe in town hands down!! Back in my fatty days (not long ago) you could easily find me here almost everyday. Sometimes alone, others with friends and many times while working. The excuse? I'm a nanny and they have a cute play room upstairs. I did it for the kids you know;)I usually got their croissants which are to die for!! But they do have low carb, healthier options as well. The staff is very nice and sweet. The location is perfect being very near Washington and the path. Inside the decoration is simplistic and of good taste.I love this place so much that my friend makes fun of me and wonders why I haven't reviewed it. So here it is! Love love love Choc O Pain! Or should I say Choc O Pain Je t'aime! And I don't care if you don't say it back! XDAwesome place. Go see for yourself. I live close by so I'll be happy to join if you treat me to a cup of their delish coffee! :D
2013-04-18,5,Choc o Pain or Pain au Choc . Really you have to hate coffee, tea tasty pastries design and anything Euro not to like this place.  Rustic, shabby chic touches all throughout the bakery. My eyes were glued on the distressed furniture that successfully transformed this place into an elegant comfortable home. It's one of my favorite spots in the 'boken for coffee. Reminds me of my days in France, bicycles, French music , cafeÃÅ tablesand people who actually knew how to pronunce my name,  for the most part the ambiance is here. I would exchange the bikes for strollers though in Hoboken. There is an extensive list of coffee and pastries here. I keep it very simple a croissant and my espresso.  French music continuously playing in the background puts you in the right mood. Wonder if they will ever play Serg Ginsbourg & Brigitte Bardot sexy not so hit  "je t'aime.. moi non-plus"???
2013-03-25,4,It's a winner...Great place to spend some time and relax on a wintery Saturday morning.  The staff is super friendly and the place has a ton to offer.Upstairs sometimes gets taken over by Hoboken Moms which can be tough given the limited seating.  But hey...bring a matchbox car and join in.
2013-02-20,5,Love. This. Place. Tried every caffeinated beverage and they're all amazing as is the food (quiche, tuna sandwich, and it's namesake, the actual Choc O Pain.) Only the hot chocolate wasn't my fav I think it's traditional french style and not very sweet. Decor is like you're stepping into a Parisien Cafe.
2013-02-19,5,Have visited Choc O Pain now a few times when in Hoboken, and it literally feels like you're stepping into a European restaurant the second you open the door.  Lots of pastries, coffees, and "homestyle" wooden tables really set the mood for a laid back brunch experience.  If you have children, upstairs there is a playroom for small children with living room furniture, more than fit for a fun playdate with friends. Most recently, I dined on Croque Monsieur along with Quiche made with ham.  My Cappuccino came in an extremely large cup that made me feel like I was sitting in my livingroom socializing.
2013-02-18,4,Really quite an excellent French Bakery. My only complaint is that every time I've been in there it feels like I'm sitting in the oven. I know they bake on premises so it must be tough to control the heat but sometimes it's a bit much. I prefer not to sweat uncontrollably while eating a chocolate croissant. Beautiful shop and the display is very enticing.
2013-02-18,4,Nice quiet little cafe right off of all the hustle and bustle of Washington st.  It smells of baked deliciousness and was very very clean.  The macaroons were bite size and very tasty.  I could see how one might become addicted.  The hot chocolate was good and served with a heart made of steamed milk.  They have a limited but interesting menu of sandwiches which I did not get a chance to try but wouldn't mind sampling on a return trip. Seating was a bit limited and tight but it is definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.
2013-02-18,4,Supporting local Hoboken business is easy with the opening of this lovely bakery. It's unique, sweet, delicious and French pretentious. These things go together. I suppose it makes it more authentic, and it keeps me coming back again, and again and again... I love that you can see the bakers hard at work, combining butter, chocolate and flour into beautiful art forms that are equally delectable. In the city, this bakery might only rank 3.5 stars for me, but here is Hoboken it is a real gem..The tea list is extensive and wonderful, the coffee is reliably good, and the pastries are devilishly tempting and always fresh. (Or rather, beyond fresh...straight from the oven!)
2013-02-18,3,Mildly pretentious but the snacks and coffee are pretty tasty. Not sure the purpose of writing the prices in european style. I'm by no means a go 'merica kind of guy but this isn't making your food taste any better and its not transcending me to a French village, so really what's the point? Then again I guess there's people that find that cute, but its probably the same people that take pictures of their food and put them on instagram - so their opinions are meaningless.
2013-02-10,5,Five stars. Yes. Five. Count 'em.I do not believe a restaurant has to be a "fine dining" establishment to earn a five-star rating. I just believe that they have to have a strong objective and succeed at meeting it. And what this coffee shop/bakery does, it does well. The second you walk in, you are transported from Jersey to Paris. It's not "Hey, this place is trying to be like a French bakery!" It's more like, "Wait, how did I get to Paris? What's going on? Did I Apparate here?" My friend, who studied abroad in Paris for a semester, immediately began freaking out. Everything from the writing on the walls to the cute little baguette sandwiches just oozes with authenticity. But it's not just the aesthetics that rock. Cripes. For lunch, I picked one of the simplest things: the egg sandwich with spinach and ricotta on 6-grain sandwich bread. It sounded slightly dull, but the other sandwich options contained massive quantities of bread that I knew would over-fill me. However, I got the surprise of my life from my humble sandwich; it was incredibly flavorful. The bread was astounding (so nutty and fresh), and fillings were perfectly seasoned to enhance the flavors of the ingredients, which sounds odd considering neither eggs, ricotta, NOR spinach are naturally that flavorful. And the coffee. Hands down one of the best soy lattes I've ever had. I ended up ordering a second one, which is not something I typically do. I also tried the apple tart, and yeah, it was obviously fantastic. I mean, duh.
2013-01-17,4,Can't wait to come back here and try more of their delectable French Pastries!Searched Yelp and found this place thanks to all the awesome reviews so I stopped in on a Saturday evening to pick up an assortment of pastries for a brunch I was hosting at home the next morning.  The lovely girl behind the counter was very helpful and sweet in explaining what was what from the small assortment remaining at the end of the day.  Almond Croissants are what I had in mind upon going, but they were all gone and I was illegally parked for the 7 minutes that it took for me to get in an get out!  I ultimately chose two plain croissants, 2 raisin swirly croissants (no, this is not their proper name), a petite queen (apple filled) and another small sticky looking pasty that had cinnamon.  Figured a mix of sweet & savory would be perfect for brunch the next day and it was.  My friends and I really enjoyed our treats - even at a day old :)I'll definitely be back one morning to try Choc O Pain out when they are fresh out the oven and when I have nothing to do but enjoy the comfy, cozy ambiance.
2013-01-15,4,Fantastic selection of bread and they are so delicous, very kind employees, the ambiance is serene.
2012-12-27,5,I'm now officially addicted to their 5 grains bread (perfect for breakfast) and to the rustic sourdough loaf - I stop by every couple of days to buy bread and it's always extra fresh, crusty and delicious. But I have to say that everything I've tasted here was excellent: the quiche Lorraine, the croques, the savory croissants with ham and cheese and the decadent pains au chocolat. The cappuccino is really good too, not too hot and nicely foamy.Yes the check out could be more efficiently organized but a few minutes wait are a fair price to pay for such wonderful quality.Thanks for opening in Hoboken!!!!
2012-12-24,5,Great bread and croissants, nice desserts. So nice to have a great bakery on other side of Hudson.
2012-12-19,5,If you haven't stopped by Choc O Pain yet then you're missing out! This place is AMAZING! The chocolate bread pudding is my desset of choice on a chilly Fall night and we stop by on the weekends for the chocolate croissant and ham and cheese croissants. Delicious! Their latte's are also always well made. The staff is friendly and helpful and the ambience of this little gem is unmatched in Hoboken.
2012-12-09,5,My favorite place for coffee and pastries in ALL New York!Let me make a note before you start arguing - I have a 1,5yo toddler. And it is not very easy to enjoy coffee with little munchkin toddling all around. It makes me feel guilty - why should he do nothing while I drink my cup of coffee?And an amazing french Lady - the owner of Choc O Pain - she has made a wonderful playard on the second floor. There are security gates, toys ( i would suggest to wipe them with sanitizer before giving to your baby) comfy chairs and tables. I can undress my baby and let him run around while i sit near by, watch him and enjoy my morning cup of delicious coffee.The coffee is one of the best in the city - indeed! Previously I loved Joe coffee. Then I felt in Love with Kava coffee in meatpacking. And now this is my number 1.Also, all pastries are not only delicious - they contain only good products. Usually I feel very uncomfortable after pastries - a little aches, heaviness. But these french pastries make me fly.There is only one but - you'd better be served by the owner (french lady) she is so welcoming, friendly and effective.The old lady is not polite, friendly or effective - she is slow and always reasks the order.But i come there for food not for chat.By the way, the German bakery didnt make me stop and try something.
2012-11-09,3,First, they serve La Colombe espresso which impressed me much. I've had a few pastries (croissant and brioche) and they were just ok. Though their lemon curd tart topped with berries was heavenly.A group of 5 of us went in for lunch and it was a bit hectic when it came to all of us ordering and paying. A bowl of soup, berry tart, brioche, and iced americano set me back right under $20. That's a little expensive if you ask me. I'll probably stop by every now and then just for a coffee.
2012-10-25,4,Francophile here so imagine how ecstatic I was when I realized that we had our very own patisserie in Hoboken!I've tried both the choc o pain and the egg sandwich with ricotta. The choc o pain was wonderfully light,crisp, flaky, BUTTERY, with generous bits of chocolate strewn throughout the pastry. I loved the egg sandwich, rich creamy ricotta with a single egg, grainy and seedy bread generously buttered. It gets very busy on weekend mornings, not surprising with the quality of their goods. I was a little peeved though when I requested coffee for here, hoping to get one of those beautiful big mugs to accompany my New Yorker. Alas, mixed signals and coffee came in a paper cup. I couldn't have my perfect Saturday morning. Will definitely be back to try their leek quiche, plum tart, almond croissand, raisin croissant, everything. Highly recommended for those who are plain tired of the mediocre Starbucks and Panera.
2012-10-07,2,I bought the olive bread for $5.95.  Way too salty, I guess to make up for the lack of taste.
2012-10-02,4,Five Stars for the food...Three Starts for the service...Let me explain.I was staying with a friend over in Hoboken and went to Choc-o-Pain about 5 times over the course of 2 weeks.  Everything I ate was delicious, as everyone else has stated.  I would highly recommend the seasonal sandwich: walnut bread with figs, feta and balsamic glaze.The service on the other hand is not perfect.  Everyone who works there is very friendly, they are just not efficient.  I went in one morning to grab a coffee and croissant to go.  There were four people in front of me and I waited for 10 minutes while they tried for help the others.  If you're fine with a little wait, then don't worry about it, but do go in a rush.Otherwise, go, go often and try it all!
2012-10-02,5,Sorry, Old German Bakery can't compete with this place. Even though the German is the best on its block where Panera and Starbucks are located, Choc O Pain is the best in town. I love bread and pastries. Choc O Pain makes those reminding me of my vacation in France. After the first try on a Saturday morning, I came back next day and tried coffee and quiche. They were also meeting my standard of light-and-delightful. The atmosphere in the store is a plus. The space is bright and open. I like it that the kitchen area is transparent. Will definitely go back again and again.
2012-09-04,4,4 Stars just because I adore the ambiance of the place. It's perfectly quaint. Every time I stop in for coffee, I make big plans in my head to bring my laptop and set up shop or reenact some sort of French scene from 'You Got Mail'... maybe some snow day (not too :) ) soon.Their coffee just might be my favorite in town, and the chocolate croissant is a nice little treat. I'm also relieved to have a non-Italian sandwich option in Hoboken. I didn't love the one sandwich I've tried (maybe because I'm not huge on goat cheese, though I did find the bread quite tough and difficult to eat.) I have high hopes for this place!
2012-08-29,3,Wonderful food and atmosphere espically if your looking for a great place to have a cup of coffee and read a book on a lazy afternoon. The quiche Lorraine is my gave and tastes amazing both warm and cold. All the other little pastries from tarts to crossiants are delicious! Only downside to this place is the staff, they seem a little disorganized every time I go in, almost like it's the first day they are open. The owner is sweet but the staff needs to have a system to deal with multiple customers at a time because it can be very frustrating. Also avoid baby hour (early morning around 10) if you looking for somewhere to relax, this is the stroller sets unofficial club.
2012-08-21,1,This place is not that good and is very pretentious. Sure, it looks like it would be a nice cafe from the outside, but once you start tasting stuff here, you realize that looks can be very deceiving.I ordered a cappuccino and a pain au chocolat. I was surprised by the size of the small cappuccino. It looked like a 12oz cup! Sure enough there was so much milk in it, I could barely taste the coffee. The pain au chocolat was cold and didn't taste very fresh. It was just meh. Oh, and my cup was also chipped.My partner got a hot chocolate and a macaroon. The hot chocolate was lukewarm and tasted like it was from a Swiss Miss packet. She had a few sips and never finished it. In good cafes macaroons are prepared fresh and never refrigerated. The macaroon was tiny and cold, and didn't taste very fresh either.Don't be fooled by the looks of this place or the 5 star reviews. Go somewhere else. Maybe take the PATH to the city and try Amy's Bread for comparison.
2012-08-19,4,Choc o pain is a hidden treasure. Thanks to yelp, I am able to find this awesome breakfast place. I order an ice latte and the mushroom quiche. They are both incredible. I have to say, that is the best mushroom quiche I've ever had in my life. The intensity of the mushroom taste is amazing. The decor of the place is super cute with an old school French cafe look and feel. I'd def come back for more mushroom quiches.
2012-08-09,5,This place is a hidden gem.  I walk by this charming bakery every morning on my way to work and have always wanted to try it out so one day I picked up their infamous choc o pain (chocolate croissant) and a latte and it made my day.  So flaky, soft, not too greasy and so chocolatey.  Their savory pastries looked amazing too!  My husband fell in love with ham & gruyere sandwiches on our last trip to Paris so can't wait to bring him for breakfast next time.  Also, there's outdoor seating in the shade which is perfect for your morning reading and cup of coffee.
2012-08-09,5,Choc Au Pain is ALL CLASS.  From the lovely china & patterned mugs to the cutesie wood tables on the sidewalk, the ambiance is sophisticated yet relaxed Parisienne.  Let's not even TALK about their incredible spread of pastries & yummies...the worst part about coming here is the internal battle as you try to decide which to get!  We ended up coming here almost every morning for breakfast so we could try a variety -- everything was delicious.  QUICHE:  WOW - we tried the Wild Mushroom and the Ham&Cheese Quiches - extremely generous portions (in fact, I only ate half of mine and saved it for later) and the perfect balance of herbs, egg, and crust, so you get wonderfully subtle flavors.(SEE PICS)CHOC AU PAIN - of course we had to try their signature item - each one was totally perfect.  Chocolate croissants are one of my favorite things in this world, and I have to admit: these were the best I've ever had (hence the 5th star!)Ham & Cheese Croissant - The cheese is baked into the croissant and the ham/cheese filling is just right, not too heavy at all.  Very filling.PARFAIT -- this was the only item that was lacking.  Points for using fresh strawberries & blueberries, but the yogurt was very watery (perhaps homemade?) and the balance of honey:nuts:yogurt was off, IMO.  Disappointing.SERVICE -- this again pushed this to a 5 star review.  The owner is a lovely French lady who very sweetly welcomes you - and stands up for her beautiful place (to the disappointment of  a couple sitting outside munching on baked goods from Carlo's !!!, gracefully asked to put the competitor's products away and simply enjoy COP's treats).  Everyone working there was very nice and I feel great supporting this quality local biz!
2012-08-06,5,Their chocolate croissants are seriously what MY dreams are made of. Unbelievably buttery, flaky and just plain DELICIOUS!
2012-07-30,5,This lovely little  bistro was just the thing when stopping for a birthday brunch. Their quiche was so very delicious and their homemade lemonade was an instant hit not to mention that the customer service was +A. I would love to take them home with me...
2012-07-18,4,Choc O Pain is unique French style cafe that Hoboken was waiting for (and needed).  The drinks are superb from an ice coffee with the right amount of ice and yet not too much milk and the vanilla latte had just the right amount of foam.When I lived in Rome I bough croissants, daily.  So I'm always wear about going to a place and ordering one just in case it doesn't meet my expectations! BUT Choc O Pain does! The croissant amandine is definitely the best!  The texture is flaky and it has a sweet and savory taste--what more could you want!
2012-07-08,4,After a lackluster meal at sushi house- I strolled by this cute place I had never noticed.  Popped in- it was late Sunday so I didn't expect much.  What they did have looked great. I went for the apple tart and I LOVED IT.  Not too sweet at all and I finished it on the drive home- couldn't help it. I want to go back to try the croissants- they looked soooo good. I will be back.
2012-06-27,4,Very great detail on the end product, and fantastic taste, coupled with great service and inviting environment.
2012-06-22,4,Warm, welcoming French bakery, an excellent addition to the neighborhood. Spacious, clean, open and airy feeling. The window display reminded me of traditional bakeries in Paris.After a quick debate between the Choc O Pain (chocolate croissant) and Choco Almond, decided I should opt for the choice the store was named after. The waitress said it's their best seller, and understandably so. Flaky croissant crust with two inserted rows of rich, creamy chocolate. Did not disappoint.Seems like a great place to meet a friend for a snack, bring a book or a laptop. Would definitely come back.
2012-06-18,4,I guess I like fancy little French places after all...A typical breakfast out for me consists of a massive omelet, huge helping of hash browns and bacon.  However, I've learned that a chocolate croissant and  cup of coffee will do just fine.  The chocolate croissants are impossibly fresh and tasty.  The coffee is also good, although I'm not crazy about the little cup in which it is served.  I like my coffee fix in the morning, so I guess I'll ask for a bigger cup next time.  My only regret is that I haven't tried more of the food here.  Really looking forward to coming back.Only con:  A little pricey for not a lot of food.
2012-06-12,5,Choc O Pain is a well executed French bakery and succeeds where so many others have failed - the food. The pastries, bread, coffee and sandwiches are delicious (and according to a friend who happens to be French, very authentic). You could walk up to the counter, close your eyes, point and get something delicious. The croissants are so flaky and buttery that I'm surprised that they don't just float away. The pain au chocolate is the perfect blend of savory and sweet. And the fruit tarts are simply fantastic.We've been here many times and have never had bad service. The upstairs is great if you have a little one since there is a play area with toys and a gate to keep them off the stairs. The only issue is the heat. The ovens are right below and the heat and steam can make this area a little uncomfortable.Prices are a little high, but I've always felt that a premium is not too much to ask for quality. Hooray for Choc o Pain!
2012-06-12,5,My friend and Hoboken resident took me here after my first night on the town and my first visit since she sunk her heels into the neighborhood. I had a chocolate croissant, a regular croissant (yes. I needed both) and a homemade organic lemonade. She got the veggie panini and her sister ordered the quiche lorraine which looked awesome. Everything was delicious, perfect even. My croissant was flaky and crisp on the outside and gloriously soft and wonderful on the inside. The chocolate could not have been run of the mill baker's chocolate, it was heavenly. The atmosphere is relaxed and we set up at a high top table with stools and enjoyed our last few minutes before I hopped on the PATH back to NYC. There will never be a visit to this friend without a visit to this place. Bravo.
2012-06-10,4,Adorable French bakery with a great selection. I adored my chocolate croissant - I suspect it was very high quality chocolate in there.A few tables inside and several outside. Good service. It could be either charming or annoying to eat outside if you're interesting in conversation because of the guitar place across the street playing loudly outside.May be a good first date place if you plan to just meet for coffee.
2012-06-07,3,the olive bread is completely addicting and i have gained about 15 lbs since they've opened. i work a few blocks from this bakery and it sucks me in just about every day. i love this bakery too much. chicken curry sandwich is inventive and delicious, as is the tuna sandwich with a bit of spice. spinach quiche is fantastic. egg and ricotta breakfast sandwich is a total delight. chocolate bread pudding is insane. cucumber gazpacho? out of this world. minty lemonade that tastes exactly like a virgin mojito? yes! owner is lovely and staff will remember you. but the olive bread....superb....run, don't walk. then run again when you leave, and keep running.a bit pricey but ingredients are top notch and worth it.*i still love this place but have removed 2 stars due to less than stellar counter service. the honeymoon is over. i took my mother here after months of telling her how great it is, and she was excited. i ordered one of their cheese rolls (bonus, you'll have your very own cheese roll the next day, as you try and put your jeans on), and the girl who served us put a croque monsieur in the bag instead. which we would've just dealt with, except she literally threw the croque in this big shopping bag with all of the other stuff we got, so it was all over the place. ugh. then a week or so later i stopped in to pick up some quiche for a quick dinner, and the same girl was at the counter. i was kind of like, oh sh*t, she's going to throw this quiche in a bag and it's going to be a hot mess. well, she didn't throw it in a bag but she did cut it up and make a giant mangled mess of it. the way this chick operates is similar to the black and white reenactments during an informercial....the way they make something so simple turn into something super complicated and messy. like frying an egg suddenly turns into having egg all over your hands and the kitchen is a disaster and your hair is all frizzed out. the quiche didn't even need to be cut! all she had to do was put it in a box, (sigh). lastly, the other day i stopped in to pick up a sandwich for lunch and the owner was helping me. i told her there was a sandwich that looked particularly good, and asked her very nicely if she would get it for me. well, no soup for you! she actually asked me if i was joking by asking her to get the sandwich. she looked legit pissed. in my opinion, if a customer wants something, you try and give them what they want, without attitude. thats why a job in customer service can be a nightmare, because it isn't always easy. and i realize that complaining about the attitude at a french bakery is redundant, but c'mon.  i am a good customer across the board and always polite. i will still suck it up and go there for bread on occasion because my husband adores it, but yeah....i'm turned off otherwise.
2012-06-07,5,I'm a huge fan of this place. Stop in just for a baguette to take home for dinner or stay and enjoy the great food. I will remind people that this is a French bakery so, while you will find filling meal options, if you want a big, meaty sandwich then I'd recommend going elsewhere. For me however they hit all the marks: * Independently owned and community oriented: The owner (short brown hair) is genuinely French, friendly & will remember you. In fact after going in only a couple of times I think most of the staff knows my face (and they do have a pretty steady stream of people in and out throughout the day)... They usually have a poster or two advertising something around town (garden tour, farmer's market, etc).* The food is great: all made in-house, the bread is AMAZING, all of the pastries and sandwiches are all very good (although, like another reviewer wrote, the chock au pain is just so-so). Be sure to check out the Roasted Veggie w/goat cheese & walnut spread and the fruit tart or just grab an iced coffee & croissant. * Great County/Parisian Ambiance: Complete an upstairs and outdoor seating. If you have kids go upstairs. There is a play area and lots of comfy seating. One thing I though was cool was child gate that you can pull across the steps so you don't have to worry about your little one going for an unwanted tumble. Having an area for kids upstairs also means that downstairs is kept nice and calm for the rest of us. There is even a smallish  (8 person) community table that is nice to site at. * Free WiFi: Haven't taken much advantage of this yet but I've seen other people on their computers.Whenever I'm having a bad day I come here and it cheers me up!
2012-05-29,4,I got the chocolate bread pudding - terrific.  I need to go back before I give it 5 stars but this is clearly a bakery that's serious about their business. The staff were very professional and you could see they take rightful pride in what they do.
2012-05-11,4,Right now they get 4 star status. I'll be back Choc O Pain, to see if you can achieve that glorious 5 star status when I try more of your offerings. I met someone here for a meeting and though choosing a place blindly off Yelp tends to work, I was a wee bit nervous that it was going to be loud, etc.. Was I ever so glad we decided to meet here. The place is gorgeous. A 2 floored, cafe with the first floor housing a few tables, a high "bar" and of course the bakery part, and the ordering counter, etc... while upstairs is just for loungin'. Vintage chairs and tables, free wifi, bright and airy. Beautiful.I went with a latte and a small macaroon (just to taste so I could write this review) and I dropped a little over $5. The coffee was good (albeit small) and the macaroon (salted caramel) was decadent and delicious with the caramel insides oozing out. Though it was bite size it was indeed so rich and delectable that I had to eat this bad boy in 3 bites not one.I would be here likes all the time if this was my neighborhood joint. So, kind of glad it isn't but, I do know that I have now found my non alcoholic meeting space whether business or personal in Hoboken.
2012-04-28,5,Delicious!!!!  My sister called their croque monsieur heavenly and I completely agree! The banana sourdough bread is delicious and so are their almond croissants. I hope this place sticks around. They even have a playroom upstairs i heard from someof the mommis in town.
2012-04-13,4,I ended up here because the other coffee shop I was looking to try was closed, and it was better than I could have expected!I think I got there around 6, asked when they were closing, and when my friend and I ended up staying a little later than their closing time, they did not complain, they did not say a word, and they did not try to rush us out - and they could have done any of the above.  I didn't get have any of their pastries, although I would have if we were not going to grab dinner, and just had a cafe au lait and I think my friend had a black coffee, both of which were good.  Also, I loved the bounjour's and au revoir's to the French customers.  It almost made me feel like Madeline in Paris, and then I was slapped with the reality of bro's and the skeezies roaming the streets of Hoboken.
2012-04-07,5,I absolutely adore this place! It has a great ambiance, and the staff is friendly. The coffee is delicious and so is the food. I also love that there is free wi-fi available! My favorite coffee shop in Hoboken.
2012-04-07,5,Amazing! We actually think this was the best bread we EVER had! Add to that fantastic and friendly service, lovely atmosphere, delicious coffee and agave available to sweeten, what more can one ask for in a bakery? We live an hour away but will be back, as the crusty spongy sourdoughy :) goodness will have us longing very very soon. As for prices, you get what you pay for. Artisan and organic ingredients, non-mass produced everything, support it and it will become a way of life and make you a healthier, happier person. See many fat French people? Thank you for bringing it to us! Lovely in every way! Merci et a bientot!
2012-03-28,5,This place came out of no where and it's absolutely amazing. Very European!Great BreadGreat CoffeeGreat FoodLots of roomDownside:- kind of pricy- lots of babies
2012-03-17,5,I am reading these reviews and most I understand, but the people who are talking about ordering food and it not being big enough or having enough on it?? This is what that Michael Moore movie was about, America's obsession with gluttony! I mean seriously this place has ridiculously good coffee, the pastries are the best by far that I have ever had in hoboken and for that matter the city and the quiche is as creamy and light as it gets! Listen if you want good quality food it's gonna cost you a bit more...if you want some crappy slice of pie with loads o' meat on it or a gut busting sandwich for 3.00 then go to any other of the million dining establishments in hoboken...they are a dime a dozen and they serve in pounds.  Hoboken has been aching for a place like this for a long time a true non commercialized coffee shop with excellent food to boot and I hope they stay, traditionally folks on 1st street don't last. Now when it comes to all the hell raising kiddies destroying the 2nd floor and making it impossible to relax...well that is something for the owner to figure out....i only stay on the 1st floor because the obnoxious parents who let their kids rule the roost up there and practically draw smiley faces in snot on the walls make me want to disinfect myself upon exit. But as long as the wifi is on the 1st floor then I'm good.Highly recommend, perfectly sized sweets for a person with an ass smaller then momma cass......and worth every penny.
2012-03-16,5,Very nice addition to Hoboken. I am sooooo happy to finally have my real french baguette sandwichs once in a while ! Tarte aux pommes and tarte aÃÄ l'abricot made me think of my grandma's - that is a very good sign !! thank you
2012-03-16,5,Everything I've tried here is delicious, truly authentic. I don't know how they manage to be so good. It's a little pricy, but a bargain compared to buying a plane ticket to France! Love the roast veggie & goat cheese sandwich (two meals worth), the pain au chocolat, and chausson au pomme. And of course, the baguettes!!
2012-03-15,5,I've been looking for a place like that for years!! It's been 3 years I'm away from France and I've missed my bread so much... Bread at Choc O Pain is fantastic with a crunchy crust! I had the Emmental and ham sandwich, it was awesome with a real taste of ham! The chausson aux pommes is to die for! I'm eager to go back and try other things!Go there, you won't be disappointed!
2012-03-06,5,After being away from France for a year I have dreamt of the delectable pastries and breads. I have scoured the greater New York area looking for the quintessential French Patisserie, but have failed over and over again. Well, today, dear friends, I have struck gold. Choc O Pain is a delightfully Parisian bakery with everything that you would find in a traditional French bakery, including the adorable ambiance! I could sit there for hours! I have tried a few of their baked goods and all have been perfect - tous les baguettes, tarte aux pommes, pain au chocolat, pain viennois au chocolat and the cappuccino is the best in town. I love love love this place!
2012-03-01,3,If you're coming here for the bread, do it. The bread is absolutely fantastic.Lunch, unfortunately, offers little more. I have yet to try the quiche or the savory pastries, but I've had a few of the sandwiches, and they're a little light on the substance between the bread. My limited understanding of French fare believes that this is probably traditional, but I like a little more meat in the middle. The dry sausage sandwich only has a thickness of a single slice. The roasted vegetable sandwich is much more packed, but the veggies sit inbetween much thicker slices of bread.Seriously, though, the bread is amazing. If you're looking for a carbtastic lunch, this is your place. I can only handle so much of it in a week, though.Additionally, I think they did a great job decorating the place. It's definitely a great addition to the neighborhood.
2012-02-26,5,I'm in love with this place after only one visit! My friend and I stopped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and we had a fabulous time!The woman was very helpful when we asked her for recommendations. I ended up with the Quiche Lorraine, and my friend got the tuna and veggie sandwich. I loved every bite of that quiche. I seriously never wanted it to end! I loved the side salad as well. My friend was very happy with her sandwich. We both got iced coffees, which they just started serving. They were a generous size.We couldn't leave without trying a chocolate croissant, and I'm so happy with did! It wasn't overly buttery. A little on the small side, but what we ate was well worth it.It was a little on the pricy side. I think the small croissant was about $3, and our two lunches and two iced coffees were about $22, which is pricy but not totally unreasonable. I also believe in paying for quality, and you definitely get that here.The atmosphere is also adorable. It's great for anyone who is dining alone or with a friend or two. They also have free wi-fi and a very cozy area upstairs. I can see myself coming here with my laptop on the days when I'm working from home.Welcome to Hoboken, Choc O Pain! I'll be back for sure.
2012-02-14,3,The owners did a nice job of providing a cute, chic atmosphere in this little bakery.  There is an attractive window display of bread and there are a few seats inside like a Parisian cafe.  Hoboken seems to really like quaint little bakery/pastry shops and I think this place will do well, given its location!I've had the chocolate crossaint and the chocolate bread/roll.  Both have quite a bit of chocolate chips in them.  I thought the dough was pretty decent.  Unfortunately, both are actually really small (maybe about 3-4 inches long) and will still cost you $2.90 each!  Alas.I guess I can't really rely on this place for cheap (and filling) breakfast, but the pastries do make for a good quick snack.  Also, I think the person behind the counter was French, which is really cool!
2012-02-08,2,Dropped by around 6 pm, because the atmosphere looked nice and the bread displayed at the front window was appealing.  I ordered two regular coffee to go.  They only had regular sugar and splenda, so if you prefer any other type of sugar, you're out of luck.  Coffee was just ok - on the weak / watery side.  I also ordered two small slices of pizzas (which are smaller than your average pie slice) - these are little flat squares.   They were slightly on the old / stale side.  I also ordered one chocolate roll just to try it out.   The roll was the best out of all 3 - a hearty bread with a crusty outside with melted chocolate chips inside.  I was a little shocked when the cashier rung me up at $17.50.  Now I know why it's called Choc O "Pain".  Good thing I had extra cash on me.  I know the large coffee was ~ $1.95 each which would make the two small square slices and the single roll about $13.50 altogether.  Overpriced for two small slices.  I've had better similar style flat pizzas for less.  Try Sullivan's Bakery in midtown NY if you're in the area.  They have a lot more variety, and you'll come away with more delicious and fresher items for less even around 6pm.
2012-02-08,3,Love the place.. but was a little dissapointed that they seemed unorganized. They were slow ringing people up, and just don't have the kinks worked out yet with logistics.They were out of a few items... including bottled water.  I paid my total bill, then they told me they didn't have anymore water, gave me a glass with tap water, and never refunded me. Then, when we went up for a refill of coffee, they asked for $2.50. I felt a little bit taken advantage of... and it would make me not go back. However, the atmosphere is great, and it's a great addition to the neighborhood.
2012-02-03,5,Great addition to this neighborhood.  I tried the baguette (awesome, not too fluffy and seems authentic), chocolate croissants (delicious!!!), and one of their lunch items (not sure what it's called, it was baguette with bechamel and ham out of the oven, with side of green salad. Very very good, and a nice portion that wasn't too small but also not too big for lunch).  The other lunch options are quiche, sandwiches, and french pizza, all of which look good but I have not tried yet. This place is very promising... I hope they expand the pastry options!
2012-01-17,4,This place is so cute! They did a great job and I love the location.  A little gem.  Hoping it does well.  On the second day it opened, I was there early, so a lot of pastries were not ready.  Ordered a coffee and a croissant.  Coffee was pretty good but the croissant was amazing.  So light and buttery.  I will def be back (probably tomorrow) for more.  The woman who I assumed was the owner, was a friendly french woman (what!? friendly and french?! who knew).  The interior looks like a lovely place to enjoy a choc o pain :) Go here!
2012-01-15,5,I can only comment on the Croissant.  Very savory and buttery.  I did not try their coffee yet, but they made a pretty good selection of beans.
