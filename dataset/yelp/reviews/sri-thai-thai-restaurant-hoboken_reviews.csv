2021-10-28,4,Sri Thai is convenient, accommodating, and super timely. I love their pad thai and thai iced tea. have ordered it for take out and brought to Cork City for a beer across the street and it's the perfect combo !
2021-09-15,4,When faced with 3 different Thai restaurant options in the same mile, I decided to go with Sri. And it was obviously meant to be! Sri has great service and honestly the best pad thai I've ever had the pleasure of eating. This humble kitchen is the perfect cozy dinner spot to catch up with a couple of close friends. It is perfectly tucked away from busy traffic, offers outdoor seating and the dishes are a great size for sharing!
2021-08-29,1,Just ordered delivery from here - I remember this place being good so I was looking forward to the food. Incredibly, incredibly disappointing. I ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken and the Bangkok Shrimp. The Pad Thai was pathetic - absolutely no flavor or spiciness. Bangkok shrimp was just salty and tough, wasn't cooked to the right temperature or flavored correctly. Again, the only word to describe it is pathetic. I hadn't ordered food from this place in a few years and I remember it being really good in the past so I don't know if I just got a bad batch, cook was having a bad day, I got stale food etc. but whatever the reason, an embarrassing effort.
2021-07-21,5,You are in Hoboken, Jersey City areas and you didn't try SriThai, you didn't complete your full experience!!! It's something you have to. Wonderful food! Talented chef and wonderful & sweet staff!!!
2021-06-30,4,The service at the restaurant was great and the staff was very friendly. We started with the steamed dumplings, in which the pork and shrimp are mixed together. It comes with a yummy sauce! I had the see-ew for my entree with shrimp. The flavor was very good and the noodles were cooked perfectly, but the shrimp seemed a little off. Maybe overcooked or not fresh? I ended up eating around them. Other than that, the flavors were great.
2021-06-26,4,Pad Thai had good flavor, well cooked chicken and soft noodles. Also got the pineapple fried rice and the rice was cooked perfectly. Very tasty
2021-06-05,5,Great Thai food in Hoboken. We got 2 pad Thais (squid and veggie) and see-ew and they are all delicious. Very reasonably priced and good food too. The place was very nice inside with comfy cushions in the booths. Service was great, they filled up our waters 4-5 times every time we needed more. Great Thai place!
2021-05-29,2,So disappointing. Everything was extremely salty and hard to eat. One of the worst "red" curry I have ever had. Also, "spicy" to describe the food is generous.
2021-05-26,1,I ordered 6 dishes tonight. 1. spicy noodle with shrimp.  2. See-Ew with beef. 3. Pad Thai with Shrimp. 4.  Larb Moo. 5. Lang Sup Pa Rod (Curry) 6. Tom Kha Kai soup.  We tried 4 out of 6.  I haven't tried the Pad Thai and Curry yet. I have to say ALL the proteins are NOT FRESH!! Everything is SUPER SALTY and Spicy, though I ordered everything in mild spicy. I used to like this restaurant, but the saltiness is unbearable now. And the use of MSG and spiciness just kill  all the tastes. I almost couldn't tell apart what kind of meat, the texture are either tough (beef) or starchy (chicken and shrimp). And the shrimp smelled very badly. They should seriously look into their quality. If food is fresh, you don't let salt take over the freshness!!! Super disappointed today. And I am so sad. I used to love this place.
2021-04-22,2,Food is a little bland and sour tasting. It used to be better quality before the pandemic but it looks like the chef has changed. All the ingredients were hacked up into huge pieces and thrown together.Location and price is not bad but quality has gone down.
2021-03-15,5,My favorite Thai in Hoboken! Their pad Thai is a large portion and very good. The delivery/ pick up here is quick and the staff are friendly. The spring rolls and the curry are also amazing!
2021-02-11,5,The best THAI food I've had in the neighborhood. The food is absolutely delicious and the staff is friendly. They do have spaced out dine in available now. If looking for a vegetarian option I would highly recommend the Tofu Gra Praw or the Kaw Pad Gra Prow
2021-02-03,1,I am generally an accommodating and even  passive  individual. But sometimes one has an experience so great or so poor that you have to take action. So  unfortunately I'm prompted to action by what arguably is the worst take out order in recent memory. The chicken green curry was so massively over salted it simply was inedible. I have no idea who does the cooking in this place but they are frankly a danger to society. Avoid at all costs, there are multiple better Thai establishments in Hoboken.
2021-01-27,5,I used to live in Hoboken in the 90s and ordered from here and I am a long time fan.  It is the most amazing thai food- Ive since moved and I hold all thai food up to this restaurant as a comparison.
2021-01-06,1,Had high hopes for this place. Was chewing and found a staple in my food........ never again. Good thing I found it
2021-01-04,4,I ordered here for takeout on a Friday night and had no issues with my order, ready for me when I arrived. I got the Thai iced tea, pad Thai and the jungle curry! Would definitely recommend the pad Thai but I think I'll try a different curry next time since it wasn't my favorite and they have an extensive menu!
2021-01-03,5,Came here to pick up my takeout. Good portion (there was a fair amount of beef under the noodles you can't see) and kept me stuffed. When you walk in there's two large bottles of hand sanitizer. There's also two tables available for those who would like to dine in. Everyone inside the establishment was PROPERLY wearing their masks.
2020-12-28,3,I have known this restaurant for 30 years and visited from time to time. The food back then was Obviously better lol. It was kinda disappointing on our last visit. Tom yum soup taste like chicken soup, frog was salty, curry was meh, fried banana dessert was not sweet at all and honey drip was too little.
2020-12-26,5,Pad Thai is amazing green curry is amazing spring rolls are amazing chicken skewers are amazing literally everything is amazing!!! We've never been disappointed
2020-12-11,4,Sri Thai is my go to for take out Thai food! The curry puff appetizer and pad Thai are my favorite! Highly recommend for Thai food that just hits the spot!
2020-12-07,3,Always good food! Only thing that put me off was the server who ran after the guys sitting on table next to us to ask them to leave tip. I agree they should have left tip in the first place but if they didn't, I thought it was very rude to run after them and ask for it.
2020-10-04,3,I've ordered their drunken noodles and a few of their curries. The noodles clump together. Flavor wise not spicy at all for Thai food. Average flavors. The best Thai food in Hoboken but that's not saying much.
2020-08-29,5,This has been the best Thai food that I have had in Hoboken. Dining during covid was stress free- would recommend papaya salad, curry puff, veggie pad Thai spicy and the Thai iced tea. We will definitely be back
2020-08-27,5,This is one of my mom's favorite Thai places, and I see why! The staff are really friendly and food comes quicker than expected, and always so good. We always order pad Thai and Thai iced tea here and sometimes try out different fried rice variations. I love coming here whenever I'm in NJ (:
2020-07-31,1,This is the worse place I ever ordered from..they didn't give me my full order and when I asked them to refund me for the order they didn't give..they refunded me less than the amount of the food..they are a rip off..& when I called them again , they didn't answer ..I had to call fr my daughter's Phne & that's when they finally Answered their food is not good at all..not worth a penny of what i paid ..
2020-07-26,5,If you are looking for good healthy food at a good price, then I strongly recommend Sri Thai Thai Restaurant. There is a reason why this restaurant has existed on this corner for decades. The food and service makes dining here a pleasant experience. As a vegetarian, I have had Pad Thai and a glass noodle dish called Sien. My friend had a tofu curry and I took a taste and it was very good as well. I also like their sweet Ice Thai Coffee and Ice Thai Tea.I havent been around this area for over a decade and came back and was happy my old go-to was still around, especially now. Thank you Sri Thai Thai for the keeping it going and providing decently priced food.
2020-07-19,4,I'm a big Thai food guy and after ordering from this place twice, I decided it was time to leave a review. My go to in determining if a Thai restaurant is good is to try the Pad Thai. I can confidently say that Sri Thai is the best Thai restaurant in Hoboken. The food is delicious (very well balanced between sweet and savory) and the service is always excellent, kind, and prompt. I will not hesitate to order from here again and I encourage all Thai food lovers to give this Hoboken spot a try!
2020-06-23,3,*Quarantine Delivery Review*Good Thai restaurants are slim pickin's in Hoboken. Judging from the reviews, it seems like Sri Thai is the best one in the neighborhood, so we decided to order dinner from there on a Thursday night via Uber Eats. That was when I found out that we have actually ordered from here before, because the app recommended some dishes to 'order again'. Clearly, it was not very memorable and this second time around, it was no different.We ordered:Chicken wings - these were actually pretty good. I loved the sweet chili sauce it came withPla Mueg Tod (fried squid) - underwhelming, and a bit soggy and bland. Good thing this also came with that sweet chili saucePad Thai with shrimp - pretty basic. The noodle texture was good, but could have used more flavor. I solved that problem by adding some garlic chili sauce. The shrimp was kind of overcooked/dry. I added extra noodles for $2 and had more than enough for leftovers the next dayLamb Pad Ped - this is not something we would normally order but my fiance said he wanted to try something new. It's basically slices of lamb and eggplant in a curry-like sauce. It surprisingly wasn't bad. The lamb didn't have any of that gamey taste that it can sometimes have. However, the meat was a bit tough. If they hadn't sliced it as thin as they did, it probably would not have been edible.Not sure I would order from here again. I think the next time we have a Thai food craving, I might just drive somewhere else for a pick-up instead.
2020-06-19,5,Great flavor. Didn't get my order right, I asked for minced pork, but it was still delicious
2020-05-08,5,I ordered online, food was ready super quickly and absolutely delicious. We had the pad Thai and Massaman Curry- both equally great
2020-04-28,5,I've ordered from here at least 3 times since Hoboken has been on lock down so I thought they needed a new and improved 5 star review raving about how wonderful they continue to be. The first order was over a month ago on my birthday. My boyfriend and I had to forgo plans for a big dinner out with friends and turned to my favorite Hoboken restaurant to make the night special still. We got a little feast and all was amazing, as usual. Since then, it's been a go-to on the rare occasion neither of us feel like cooking. I usually always get the ginger chicken because it is incredible. So much tender chicken, the veggies are cooked perfectly and the sauce has so much flavor. They also make sure there is plenty of sauce so once you mix in the rice, it is never even close to dry. Lately, I have been trying new entrees like sauteed shrimp and veggies or just broccoli and, what I had for my last order, shrimp pad thai. As much as I loved loved loveddddd it, it left me feeling really full. The thing I love about the stir frys that I usually get is how good I feel after cleaning my plate. Never uncomfortably full or heavy. So as delicious as the pad thai was, I'll probably stick to my stir frys from now on. To give you an ordering process update during Coronavirus: as smooth as can be. Order and pay online (I usually do it right through the Yelp page) and the estimated wait time is about 20 minutes on average. They have it ready for you on the front table so you can just grab and go. We've also had food delivered a few times and it gets here right when they say it will. Thank you so much Sri Thai for continuing to be there when we really don't want to cook.
2020-03-28,1,Have ordered from this restaurant many times through take out and sit down. Has been a favorite. Just ordered my usual and received the container half full for $20. When we kindly called the restaurant they were very condescending and would not help us. Will never order from here again, complete rip off. Wish 0 stars was an option.
2020-03-15,5,Sri thai is great. Usually order from here to satisfy my pad Thai craving and it never disappoints. The noodles are always cooked well, the peanut sauce is delicious, and they always load on the veggies. Stop by if you're in hoboken !
2020-02-29,5,Very small space but it doesn't matter- the food is authentic and delicious! Stopped in for the first time on a cold Friday night. We tried chicken curry and basil fried rice, both were delicious! Very nice staff and reasonable prices. Will definitely be back
2020-02-17,5,Inexpensive, flavorful, quality. Just delicious, spot on. Food didn't suffer on delivery or take out.
2020-02-14,2,Very average quality of food. We need better thai restaurants In Hoboken!!! Hoboken deserves better quality of thai food.
2019-11-25,5,My first delivery experience from Sri Thai was years ago and honestly not very good.  On that occasion, I was very disappointed with my order of Pad See-Ew, finding it greasy and bland.  However, years have passed, and I am so happy that I gave the restaurant another chance.  I now frequent it for dining in or, even more often, for take-out.  Yes, I have reordered the Pad See-Ew and found that it possessed the sweet and savory balance that I cherish in this soy sauce-coated noodle dish.  However, while that was previously my favorite Thai cuisine option, I have since branched out and discovered a new beloved dish - Prik Ped Kai, which includes sauteed chicken, spicy chili paste, and eggplant.  The large portion is more than enough to blanket the side of rice that is included, and the zesty sauce is addicting.Sri Thai provides delicious, authentic-feeling cuisine enjoyed either in their cozy dining room or with quick preparation for take-out or delivery.
2019-11-12,4,The food here is pretty good. I had the curry, it tasted very nice, but the potatoes in it were kind of lackluster (I did not enjoy them that much). Other than that, I think this is a good place to go to if you are craving Thai food. The waitress was really attentive and the music they were playing was really good.
2019-10-17,4,Great lunch spot! Ordered for pick up, lunch come with soup or salad.Great flavor, good portion, love Chinese brocolli in my noodle, I order this dish all the times, they did everything right.Only downside is the Tom yum soup is way too salty. Soup came with few pieces of chicken.Will order again, stay away from the soup
2019-10-03,4,I've eaten at this restaurant a hand full of times and I order delivery a few times a year. I've always had a good experience! Delivery is usually 45-60min and the food always arrives hot and fresh. I like their Shrimp Pad Thai and have ordered Tom Kha Koong soup (perfect amount of spicy) and the Pla-Mueg-Tod (Calamari) prices are reasonable and the servings last at least 2 meals. I recommend this spot! I've tried 2 other Thai restaurants in Hoboken and I think this is my most popular spot and most consistent.
2019-09-27,1,Absolutely awful. Terrible service, they don't answer their phone, and it is taking over two hours for the food to be delivered AFTER the delivery time. All for some sub par Thai food.
2019-09-14,4,I've tried a few Thai places in Hoboken and this one tops the list. It's a small, hole in the wall place, looks family run, and serves pretty decent Thai food. It's my go to choice in Hoboken, although I'd venture to jersey city if I wanted spectacular Thai.
2019-09-13,4,The menu's a little bit hit and miss overall but I will keep coming back for the crab fried rice, which is fantastic (and has real crab in it). I'm spoiled by having lived in Jackson Heights around the corner from the famed Ayada for years. So no, this place isn't a contender for Best Thai Restaurant In The Tristate Area. But most things are reasonably well done, the staff is always friendly and welcoming, and it's basically a solid pick for neighborhood Thai.
2019-09-13,5,I ordered the crab fried rice and let me just say it's extremely rare to get REAL crab meat. I was highly impressed. The rice was delicious and super fresh!I ordered through Postmates so I can't comment on the location but it would be worth the trip. Can't wait to try out another dish.
2019-09-07,5,I've ordered from here a lot in the past few months and the food is always a hit! Every noodle dish I have had here has been pretty great! Plus, you gotta love a restaurant that is organized in the way your food is packages if specials instructions are given. Nice touch!! Looking forward to trying out more of the menu.
2019-08-17,4,This place is very nicely decorated and has nice seating areas by the window (with like throw pillows and lights): very gram-worthy!! The food was good and there were a ton of options.
2019-07-05,5,Best pad Thai in Hoboken, but delicious other meals as well.  service is always very quick and friendly.  Takeout is fast too!
2019-06-24,1,I hate to leave a bad review but this was a culinary disappointment. We had green curry with tofu plus extra vegetables. Tofu and veggies we're overcooked (eggplant was under) and the curry itself did not have a good taste nor a pleasant consistency. Green salad was ok.
2019-06-05,5,Continues to be a wonderful choice for affordable and delicious Thai food in the area. Always great delivery service. BYOB. What's not to love!
2019-05-10,5,Awesome little Thai restaurant. Food is so authentic (not fusion). My favorite is their shrimp pad Thai, soft shell crabs, chicken skewers and so much more. Take my family of 4 here all the time. I miss it so much because we've moved to central jersey. I wish there was one here that wasn't so Chinese own. They claim it's Thai food but it taste like Chinese food. Smh. Please visit Sri Thai. You'll love it
2019-05-07,2,I came here with a super high expectation, but made me a little down at the end. Pad THAI is  small amout so if u are hungry don't order it, and the noddles are hard and sweet, because I am not a sweet- like taste u know how was the feeling.... Two stars are for service.
2019-04-26,2,Let me start by saying, my husband and I have been ordering from Sri Thai for years and absolutely love the food. Unfortunately tonight's experience has turned us off this place for goodWe odered delivery around 9pm (late, I know! We were delayed getting our son to bed). We were fully prepared to eat between 9:45-10pm9:45 I called. I was told that the food was ready and they were waiting for the delivery man to come back. I asked how long? "I don't know" Can you give me an estimate? "I don't know but we'll put you first when he comes back"10:15 I called. I was told the delivery was on the way and should be arriving soon. 10:35 I called. I was given the "I don't know" response followed by "you're all the way on 12th it might take awhile" Didn't they say we were first when I called an hour ago? I asked for the delivery person's number and was given a non working number?!?I called back and was told that the delivery person had called me and didn't get an answer so he left. I guess he never heard of ringing the doorbell? My phone never rang...10:50 our food finally arrived and get this, it was hot! Confirming that they had lied the whole time and it had just left... I called back and the woman on the other end of the phone laughed at me. That really was the final straw. I will never order from there again.
2019-04-22,4,Been here a couple times. It's been a while but my boyfriend and I stopped in today. It's pretty small inside and has odd decor. The food is good though and the service too! We ordered the chicken soup, tofu appetizer, yellow curry chicken and red curry chicken. The chicken soup came out super hot.. once it cooled it was delicious. The chicken was soft and cooked perfect. Nice blend of flavors with the broth. The tofu appetizer was cooked perfect. Once it cooked, it had a nice crispy outer layer and soft center. The apricot peanut dip that comes with it was yummy! Crunchy with a little bit of sweetness. I like the tofu better dipped in it than by itself. The red curry chicken had perfectly cooked veggies and basil and chicken. Great flavors. Basil was wilted from the heat. The yellow curry chicken was the best. I would like more of the coconut milk flavor in the sauce but it has the right amount of spice. The onions in it and potatoes were great. Would def order that dish again. Our waitress was right on top of everything. She was great.
2019-04-21,2,Food came out fast and service was ok but the place is definitely overpriced. Paid $10.95 for burnt rice. When we complained to the waitress that the fried rice was burned, she checked with management and told us they couldn't do anything about it. Tofu was not cut properly in cubes and the green curry dish did not taste great. The vegetables including broccoli were not cooked through and were very hard. I would not try this place again and would go with another Thai option in Hoboken.
2019-04-03,4,I stopped in for lunch with a co-worker on a Wednesday afternoon and it was very quiet.  The restaurant was located a short walk from the drama of Washington Street.  Like all of Hoboken, parking is difficult.  We began with the steamed dumplings which had more meat than casing.  That's a good thing.  The menu is packed with traditional Thai dishes and specialties.  We each ordered off the lunch special menu.  I had the chicken Pad Thai and my co-worker had the Shrimp Pad Thai.  You have a choice of soup or salad with the lunch special.  Both dishes were very good.  Plenty of shrimp and chicken in each of the dishes.  The portions were very generous.  Everything came out fresh and hot....including the dumplings.  Service was very good.  The restaurant was quaint and cozy.  Prices were very reasonable for the amount and quality of food.  If I lived in Hoboken, this would be a place I would frequent.
2019-02-21,1,it was with great sadness i would like to report that i had a rather unsavory reaction to the thai thai treats i consumed from sri thai thai. i've had some bad luck with food poisoning recently, which stinks because i love to eat. it was my first and obviously last time eating at this place, unless of course i'd like to drop some weight before a body building competition.
2019-02-21,5,This place is Great!! I have been coming here since they opened almost 26 years ago in April of 1993 and the food continues to be authentic consistent and delicious
2019-02-12,3,Was hesitant to go because of the mediocre-below average reviews but ended up going on one of the coldest nights this year! Food was good but we couldn't thoroughly enjoy because of how cold it was inside...ended up wrapping our food and taking it home. We enjoyed the veg spring rolls! So I recommend that, the Nau Prik Sod- beef with scallions, onions, and peppers, and the Kai Broccoli- chicken with broccoli.
2019-02-09,3,Tom yum soup is mediocre. It's salty and barely has any lemongrass. They have free delivery for right now though, just call and place your order. Have had better Thai food
2019-02-02,3,So I think they do a pretty good job and prices are reasonable. The reason for three stars is they put a lot of msg in their food. My husband and I were both chugging mugs of water an hour after eating our food.
2019-01-30,1,One of the most disgusting Thai food I have ever had. I would hate to leave such a bad review. But I gave this place two try to make sure it was not a one time thing and clearly, it's missing all the flavors of a Thai food. The spicy noodle also known as kee mao, is so bland and has barely any spice to it. The crispy duck has no crunch or crisp to it, it's as bad as eating a boiled duck. For the price they charge, they really need to improve on the quality of their food.
2018-12-28,5,5-Stars based on a last minute decision to order take out. A big fan of Chicken Pad Thai, and they killed it. Loved the spice levels, just enough sauce and not one complaint. I live around the corner, so thank you!
2018-11-19,4,Came here on a Sunday afternoon:Authentic food, fast service, and friendly wait staff. Everything we ordered came out fast and was cooked really well. Ambiance was fine, nothing spectacular, but the food was well worth it anyway!**Recommend the Pad see yew and spring rolls**
2018-11-03,4,Byob which is great. The staff is very friendly.  The monster roll is delicious and very fresh . The hot and soup soup is not very good too much black pepper which makes it harsh on throat
2018-10-14,5,Such a cute little spot with friendly service! The Pad see ew was delicious and lunch portion is HUGE. Definitely try the fried ice cream.
2018-05-25,4,Cute little Thai place on the corner of 3rd and Bloomfield. The employees here are super friendly and service is fast. Lunch special deals are good, you can get an entree and soup or salad for around $8. However, everything we tried (lunch special soup, tamarind chicken, and beef pad gra praw) was all quite salty- definitely more so than other Thai restaurants.
2018-05-20,5,My go to Thai restaurant! Food is made authentic by a wonderfully friendly and sweet Thai family. Highly recommend the nom jeeb (steamed dumplings)!
2018-05-05,1,TERRIBLE Thai Food !! Just got two curries ordered through Uber Eats. Never eaten such terrible Thai food in New Jersey! This would be the worst !
2018-04-02,4,Pretty good. Friendly staff. We went early so we were able to choose any seating yay. Interesting selection in menu. May change a thing or two but overall pretty good. Plan to return in the near future.
2018-03-19,5,Excellent go to Thai. The pad Thai never fails. My husband always switches up his entree and is always satisfied. Delivery is quick and on point. Will come back again and again!
2018-03-02,4,Sri Thai is an unassuming BYOB that has the best Thai food in both Hoboken and J.C. The decor is kind of lacking and there is always cheesy pop music playing, but the staff are friendly and service is swift. The food is really really tasty, I've never been disappointed when I have eaten here and I have been eating here for almost fifteen years! I find the food is fresh, it's not greasy and it's pretty authentic and well spiced - it's Thai food rather than American/Thai. Their salads and appetizers are always good. Tom Yum Soup is out of this world delicious, it has a bit more body and 'funk' than other places and I love their curry puffs. It's not at all expensive and the lunch special here is great value for money -   either $7.95 or $8.95 depending on your choice of protein, for either soup or salad and a generously sized portion of a selection of their entrees. Overall SriThai is one of Hoboken's best dining options, if you like Thai try it!
2018-02-25,4,Good food and incredibly fast. I order from here probably once a week. I picked up but have never sat and ate so can't comment on the in-house service. It would be nice if they gave a little more rice with their curry, the ratio is way off.
2018-02-19,5,Always great!! Get the green pork salad sweet sour and delicious!!!! Also spicy vegetable soup extra spicy always get those sinus's clear
2018-02-16,5,Love this place! The seats are super comfortable, staff is warm and friendly, and food is delicious and authentic. While it's pretty small and intimate, it always sets the scene for a good relaxing meal!
2018-01-14,4,I haven't actually eaten there but we do the takeout since we live around the corner. It is good solid Thai food. My son was skeptical of the pad Thai but once he tried it he was all in. Except for the bean sprouts but he liked it.
2018-01-12,2,I was disappointed. I ordered the soup with coconut milk but got the one with lemon grass. The soup had a peculiar order. The same odor as in the restaurant. Shrimp on skewers  (2 skewers with 4 skinny shrimp) appetizer was small and lacking in flavor although the two accompanying sauces of peanuts and cucumbers were tasty. Red curry with coconut milk and eggplant was just ok and small for it's price. I'm from Bayonne and I find comparable menus here have tastier food with better portion to price ratio
2017-12-28,5,I've lived in Hoboken for over 15 years and this has been my go to delivery and carry out place all that time.  I'm a creature of habit so I get the basil chicken 9 out of 10 times.  It's hands down the best version of this dish I've had anywhere. I used to travel a lot for business and would look for Thai places to avoid the national chain hell that dots a majority of this country.  I usually try the basil chicken at other places as well (again, creature of habit).  No other versions I've tried has the richness of flavor in the sauce or the large slices of vegetables.  Careful though, the spice level varies sometimes and can get very hot.  When my wife orders she asks for the non spicy version and even then there's a little kick.
2017-12-01,5,If you are a true lover of Thai cuisine, this is the place for you. It is definitely a no-frills type of restaurant and BYOB which some true foodies really appreciate. But the food is very good and very consistent and exceptionally underpriced.
2017-11-18,4,Best thai food in the area. Great value. BYO with no cork fee (be sure to stop at Sparrows around the corner for the best craft selection). Their delivery isn't the best, but their dine in service is good. Across the street from Cork City, which is a plus. Ignore the homeless soup kitchen on the other side of the block.
2017-10-16,5,I've gone here over five times now. Pad Thai, green curry, and coconut sticky rice is to die for. I would go broke if I lived close.
2017-10-16,5,Great Thai food that is very reasonably priced be warned it can be a bit spicy. ! we have eaten here many times over a 12 year timespan, no frills Thai food that tastes good served by smiling staff. We go about once a month and will cont to do so, they do a lunch special M-F $9:00 amazing value GO also BYOB what's not to like
2017-10-11,3,average food. average service. good place for lunch if you want to cheap food and want a quick bite.
2017-10-10,2,According to the rating system here on Yelp, two stars means, "Meh. I've experienced better." while three stars indicates, "A-OK."  Based on this difference, I can only give Sri Thai Thai Restaurant two stars.  I came here based on a friend's recommendation that this was the best Thai restaurant in the area.  We had called our order in ahead of time for pick up.  When we arrived, the order was ready and waiting for us.  Sri Thai was empty of customers except for a small handful of tables outside, and so our order was completed quickly... but now in retrospect the void of clientele is an indication of the establishment?   From our order, all I wanted was a papaya salad, unfortunately it was not very good.  All of the components were there from the fish sauce, to the green papaya, the peanuts, carrots, and lettuce... but it just didn't taste good.  The fish sauce completely overpowered the papaya salad, and instead of being crisp and refreshing, it was wilty and fishy.  If their craftmanship of this standard Thai dish is any indication of their food as a whole, that's unfortunate.  Fortunately the staff was very friendly and cordial and I would be willing to give Sri Thai Thai Restaurant another chance solely based on their professionalism and friendly manner.  Hopefully, I will have another opportunity to visit this place and revise my review.
2017-10-09,1,SO DISAPPOINTED! This place has gone way downhill. I used to order from here a lot then stopped just to try to cook more at home. Just ordered for the first time in a long time my usual green curry, absolutely disgusting almost inedible and for me to say that is so very rare. They clearly have stopped using coconut milk as a base for their curries which is how Thai curry should be made so I don't know what this is. They are just using oil. It's lost its flavorful, spicy and light texture and is plain gross. I received a green curry that was a rotten color, with not enough broth/base, and a layer of oil sitting on top. They also sent me my brown rice wrapped in Saran Wrap and not just in the container. Btw there was no way enough curry sauce to even eat with the rice. After tasting it there was zero flavor and almost made me gag at the amount of oil. Never ordering from here again.
2017-09-29,5,Best Thai food in Hoboken. Everything is authentic, fresh and the prices are not bad for the sizes. I have not done delivery because I don't work far...but the staff are very nice and food is delicious.
2017-09-15,4,Quality Thai in the middle of Hoboken. Lunch specials are great value. We tried the Chicken Pai Thai and Beef Pad See Ew for take out - both had great flavor. The Chicken Pad Thai could've used a little more peanuts, but it was nice that the Beef Pad See Ew was not too greasy like most other restaurants. Great option for Thai in Hoboken. If you get take out be sure to ask for utensils - it's not otherwise included.
2017-09-06,2,Update: Visited this restaurant recently and had a totally different experience this time. The place was very smelly. It wasn't a food smell though...totally different smell. The masamun curry was too sweet. The appetizer "sate kai (marinated chicken in skewers)" was tasteless. Not as expected. However, the jungle curry was delicious. As this place was so smelly, I wonder how their kitchen is going to be.
2017-09-02,2,Quality has taken a nose dive over time. Foods been awful lately , whatever you order it smells of this weird fish sauce which seems to be common base in their all their curries and sauces.
2017-08-07,1,I kind of wish I had looked in Yelp before going in to grab lunch, but they have positive reviews on Google. It was also pouring, and I was starving.  Hoboken just sucks in general, and since my office moved here two years ago, I'm always looking for something new to try. When I walked in, there was an awful stench, but it could have been from spices, plus, I was just getting takeout, so I overlooked it. I got back to my office, and I opened my bag of food.  There were no utensils.  What if I was going somewhere that didn't have any; how on earth would I eat my food? Strike one.I opened my soup. It had CHICKEN in it, ick.  I ordered a dish without meat. Do you think that maybe I don't eat meat? Strike two. I opened my actual lunch, and it smells not so hot, but maybe it tastes better.  Nope.  Never have I been tempted to throw a lunch out, but it's been here for an hour-and-a-half, and I've barely touched it, despite the fact that I'm starving.   There's barely any protein in it, either.  It has a weird aftertaste, almost like urine.  It's gross, but I'm really hungry.  There is nothing really close to my office, and I've already wasted $9.57 on this garbage.  I'd go and ask for my money back, but I doubt they'd give it to me, and I don't want to deal with the stench again, nor do I have the time. Strikes three, four, five...etc. Just retire the side.  Also, while she was friendly, the girl at the register really needs to go back to elementary school. I handed her $9.75.  My total was $9.57.  My change should be 18 cents.  She was really struggling there and had to use the calculator no less than 4 times to figure it out.  I was going to say something, but each time, she looked like she had it, then nope.Stay far, far away...or bring some bleach.
2017-06-04,2,I ordered something as simple as red chicken curry and couldn't eat more than a few bites. Meat quality will keep me away.
2017-04-27,4,One of the best places to order Thai food in Hoboken! There aren't many places but I recommend this one .
2017-03-12,3,Located on the SW corner of 3rd and Bloomfield, this restaurant is perfectly situated just across the street from Cork City, and a great place to come before or after going to that bar.I came here with a group of 4 people, the service was fantastic, but the food was just okay. My experience with Thai restaurants in Hoboken has been a bit of hit or miss, and I would have to say that this place did not stand out to me as a place I would necessarily go out of my way for. Make no mistake that they absolutely have a target audience, which is quick and reliable Thai food, but at the same time, this is certainly more of a place for locals than if you're just in town for a night or so.
2017-03-06,4,Pretty good standard Thai food, good service, BYOB, reasonable prices. Nothing to complain.We ordered the basics- had basil fried rice with chicken and basil chicken with chilly. The portion was generous and the dishes were authentic and were absolutely delicious.This is probably one of the better thai places in the area! Will visit again!
2017-02-25,1,I ordered a shrimp pad Thai, shrimp garlic and pepper entree and chicken - basil and onion entree. The shrimp pad Thai literally had 3 pieces of shrimp. 3 tiny shrimps a lil portion of egg and yep that was it. The noodles were dry.The shrimp garlic entree was more like an appetizer but it tasted fairly good. The chicken entree was extremely dry. On top of the mediocre food, they did not give me utensils or napkins
2017-01-24,5,I love their Thai food. The dishes are authentic and are absolutely delicious. My favorites are chicken Pad thai, chicken fried rice, chicken see-ew. If you like somewhat spicey then I recommend their Lang sang with coconut milk. For appetizer I love their garee puffs, steam dumplings, and spring rolls. Their delivery times are not bad. Usually order from this place every week.
2016-11-19,2,Waitress went over the order with me meticulously, but a shrimp/pork dish was delivered instead of duck.  Sticky rice was ordered but regular rice was served instead.  When duck order arrived, it had tomatoes, despite the order she wrote clearly requesting no tomatoes.  I half-expected them to take something off the bill, given all the mistakes and how long we had to wait for them to be corrected, but instead it was the reverse: they double-charged us for the Coke.  Only tried this place because T Thai was closed that night.
2016-11-12,5,The food here is always exceptional and the staff is professional and friendly. They are my go to delivery place and I love coming here for dinner on a weekend night! Also, the one server has amazing eyeliner. Love this place!
2016-10-05,5,The curries are soo so good. I can't speak for the other food aside from the pad see ew which is decent but if you're looking for good curry in Hoboken this is your spot. Can't understand the terrible reviews so I had to give 5 stars. Don't ever eat in the restaurant only pick up or get delivery so not sure about the dining in experience but it's a tiny place and no one is ever really in there so I would recommend taking it to go and drinking your wine at home. Used to enjoy T Thai curry but it's too greasy and inconsistent so I will not be ordering from there again.
2016-07-24,2,This Thai food didn't have much flavor. Portions were acceptable, waitstaff was friendly, and the prices were reasonable.
2016-06-12,5,One of best Thai restaurant!! I drive up 45 mins to eat here. Worth the drive! so fresh and delicious
2016-06-02,2,We got some takeout from here. As I was placing my order, the woman on the phone said their computer was resetting, and that she would call me back in a couple minutes. About 15 minutes later, I called back and there was no acknowledgement of what had just happened; it was clear they had forgotten! Poor customer service right off the bat. It was difficult to communicate with them when placing my order, and I had to repeat things several times. It sounded like it was very busy in the restaurant and I wasn't getting the full attention. But the biggest peeve was that I had ordered a bunch of food and requested that a couple of items, like the yellow curry, be very mild because it was for kids. When the food was delivered, it was all incredibly spicy! In fact, we could barely tell the difference between the two curries (yellow and red) because they both looked the same color, and both were the same spicy level. Very frustrating because the kids ended up eating plain rice. Which was another annoyance: I asked for brown rice. But rather than substituting the white rice with brown, they added 2 orders of brown rice to the white rice that comes with the curries. So we ended up with 4 cartons of rice, which made no sense with the meal we had just ordered. I could have overlooked all this if the food were amazing, but it was just mediocre and forgettable.
2016-04-02,5,Went here for a family dinner with my sorority sisters and t was such a wonderful experience! The staff was very friendly and gave really good recommendations! It's BYO so that was definitely a plus. Overall, the food was huge servings at an affordable price with great taste!
2016-03-28,3,This is the first Thai restaurant I've tried in Hoboken.  Service was quick and attentive  when I came for dinner (7:00 on a Thursday). Food is average, but they are BYOB and also deliver!
2016-02-28,5,Amazing food!! Each bite is full of flavours! It's not on the Main Street of Hoboken like other restaurants but it's one of the best places to eat if you are someone like me who appreciates flavours highly! This spot is going to be my regular.We had chicken kang kiew wan, chicken masamum kang and tom kha koong soup. Must try these!
2016-02-27,3,I have only done takeout and never had a bad experience. The food is great, very quick and consistent every time. Got the pad see ew and it was super tasty! Will be back again
2016-02-08,5,Great BYOB, food, and service! Owner by the nicest Thai family, and always accommodating. Everything is good and come in good portions. Also a solid delivery option for a lazy night. Outdoor seating, too.
2016-01-30,5,I only get Thai takeout from here; I learned my lesson with other places. Food is fast, and they're always super sweet.
2016-01-11,3,If you had asked me to rate Sri Thai several months ago, I would've given them 4 stars -- the food was delicious, and delivery has always been timely (usually they are ahead of schedule).  But recently, the food hasn't always agreed with my stomach (or my friend's stomachs) on several occasions.  In any event, I think it's a pretty good option for Thai in Hoboken.
2015-11-15,3,3.5 Stars overall, nice quiet atmosphere and decent food with adequate service, and it is BYOB, so its OK in our book and we might return.Pros:1) One block off Washington St, so not as crowded as Bangkok Thai on Washington2) BYOB! no corking fee, so that's great3) Decent food, we liked the Pad See Eew and the Sweet Chicken with Pinapple and the Spring Rolls (not too greasy), but we weren't fans of the Papaya Salad (I get that pretty much at every Thai restaurant); the Masumun curry wasn't spicy enough but if you like it sweeter, there ya go4) Service was adequate, quick with the water refills, but nothing special, no recommendations, no welcome, no thank you, no chit-chat, no anything really (some like that though)5) They have the very good standard Thai chili sauce, a must!Cons:1) Cold in the winter, they have inadequate baseboard heating and only one front door so when it opens, bam, you get a nice blast of cold air2) It smells (kind of like dog poop said the two women at my table), but I think all Thai places have that certain odor3) Kind of pricey, even without alcohol, but all Thai seems to be in HobokenSo maybe BYOB is the best thing they have going for them, and the hot sauce.  There's no really "amazing" Thai in Hoboken, sadly.
2015-11-02,1,i would not come back to this place even if they paid me. The food was so terrible. They put so much sugar in their food. I couldn't finish my plate. The service was okay. There's so much potential for this place but it failed in all aspects for me. Decor, food, presentation...
2015-09-11,4,I have had take out here twice and both times it was very good, my only complaint is that it is not very spicy, even when your preference is specified.  However, this is my go to take out place in Hoboken for thai.  I like the chicken with pinapple.  Also, the prices are great!
2015-09-02,3,Was at Sri Thai is past Sunday. It's BYOB which I enjoy from time to time. The place is small and cozy. The service was attentive and the food came out in a timely fashion (never felt rushed nor was it super slow). For appertizer we shared 3 different dishes: steamed dumplings (very good), spring rolls (good) and can't remember the third item. For my entree I had the chicken massaman, which is my go to at Thai restaurants. It was okay. It wasn't spicy at all and I asked for it to be medium.Overall the food was good and reasonably priced. The only compliant we had was that the air conditioner needed to be on! It was hotter inside then it was outside (should've opted for their outdoor seating).
2015-08-25,3,Adequate food, slow service.  Tom Ka Gai soup nothing special.  Spring rolls soft and a little fishy.  Spicy noodles too sweet, and not spicy enough, even though I requested extra spicy.  Will probably not go back.
2015-08-17,5,Easily my favorite Thai spot in Hoboken. The Spicy Noodle is the best and the fried calamari with plum sauce is ridiculous.  Delivery is usually pretty fast, never any issues with my order. Definitely would recommend this place if you like Thai food.
2015-06-22,2,The food was not so great. Its okay but nothing special.The spicy noodle was tossed with sweet chili sauce, weird. Didnt really finished and ended throwing it out. I might need to try another restaurant next time.
2015-06-19,4,Spicy noodle dish was delicious! Average price about 9-12$ per dish. The place itself is a little small but does have inside seating as well as outside seating. The service was fast and efficient with taking our order as well as paying. This is probably one of the better thai places in the area! Will visit again!
2015-06-11,5,always love to try Thai food. This place is quite authentic. the service is great and price is also acceptable. You don't know if you don't try!!!
2015-06-11,1,Absolutely awful service. We have ordered from there several times and one night they lost the ticket from our order and only to find this out after they didn't deliver during promised time and we ended up calling. They apologized for losing the ticket and said it would come in 15 min. 20 min later they called and said they don't have a delivery man to deliver. I heard the lady talking to several different people and not one person wanted to do the right thing and deliver to three hungry customers. Two hours later - no food. Starving at 11 pm...
2015-05-01,1,I just had the worst Spicy Noodle dish from here...I think they used a disgusting tomato paste...
2015-04-01,4,My standard thai place when in Hoboken.  It's always been reliable and good.  The chicken pad Thai is delicious. Byob helps to keep the check low. Not many tables so take out is usually the best way to go
2015-03-29,5,Great food, price, and quantity! Get the chicken w cashew and pineapple.
2015-03-16,4,Always fulfilling ! Casual simple tasty and warm. I've been here 5 times now. The food is always consistently good. The stir fries and soups are great. I've been here in summer and it's nice to sit outside with some BYO beer .. Try the friend rice and drunken noodles !
2015-03-08,4,Pretty good standard Thai food, good service, BYOB, reasonable prices.  Nothing to complain about here.The Tom Kha Ga (sp?) coconut soup is among the best I've tried.
2015-02-12,3,Came here with my fiance two weekends ago.  It's a small restaurant, dimly lit, and is BYOB.  The waitress was very friendly and came up to us as soon as we entered.  There were a few tables, maybe 5 groups or 2 or 3, but the restaurant was largely empty, perhaps because it was absolutely freezing out.  They do have outdoor seating that fills up during the summer.We ordered the Thai Spring Rolls to start, as recommended by the waitress.  They were great.  They halved the 3 rolls for us to share.  I would order these again.  We then split shrimp fried rice, I ordered the Siamese Jumbo Shrimp, and my fiance ordered the Kai Prik Khing.  I really liked the fried rice and would get that again.  The Siamese Jumbo Shrimp was ok - I didn't love the sauce and there was too much of it.  The sauce overpowered the shrimp.  The Kai Prik Khing (chicken and string beans) was good.  My fiance liked it but he thought it was too salty and it was a bit too spicy for me.  It had almost a chipotle/smokey taste.  We had left overs and could have split one main dish and the rice and been fine.Overall, I would go back but wouldn't stay this was a standout.  Decent Thai food at a decent price.
2015-02-09,5,I have consistently had good meals here. When you eat in, the service is great. Their squid pad thai is excellent, as well as their basic curry vegetable over rice dishes. All are reasonably priced. To boot it's across from the best bar in town.
2015-02-04,4,My favorite Thai place in Hoboken. Any of their curry dishes and pad Thai are to die for.
2015-01-30,3,Solid food just too rich and too salty. Ordered takeout which was fast (delivery slow). Will have to go in person. Friendly staff intimate environment.
2015-01-28,4,I am giving it 4 stars because  have been to Thailand a number of times and lived in NYC for long time....so there is definitely better, but not in Hoboken and you can't go wrong with these folks.  Top notch.The Curries are spicy and tasty with all the right mixes and subtle and bold flavors that come along with being done right.  The appetizers are delicious and delivery is very reliable.
2015-01-22,2,Gotta be honest. I went here with friends who used to love the place. But it's really filthy, don't ask to use the bathroom! i ordered a dish and asked for not spicy. It came spicy but with several shrimps, and when I returned it, I got two shrimp back in the milder dish and almost an eye roll. It was an expensive dish - over $20 and i would not have ordered it if I couldn't have gotten it made mild. So, when I complained I couldn't eat it, that the chef didn't get the message not to make it hot, I swear something went wrong in translation, because, I went home that night, never so sick in my life, the next day. Can you say food poisoning? This never happened to me before and my party spent a lot of money there that night. It's just not about the customer here. i became sick for several days after, actually. Got the basil chicken - never again! I gave it two stars because I have had excellent fried spring rolls here on other occasions and the pad thai has never given me any problems. Beware of this place tho- it is very borderline and needs a good update and cleaning to the 21st century. no longer what it was, sadly.
2014-12-12,1,Order placed for delivery never arrived. Had to cancel 90 hungry minutes later (quoted 45 minute delivery).
2014-12-07,1,Ordered delivery from this place and never again for the following reasons:1) Delivery took forever.  They quoted 30-45 minutes and it took an hour and 20 minutes.  This was only after we called them at the 50 minute mark to ask where they were and they said, "on the way"  We only live 10 blocks away so unless the delivery guy was walking it couldn't have been "on the way" for 30 minutes.2) Basil chicken was inedibly salty and dry.  The chicken was so dry that I actually had to take a sip of water with each bite because my jaws got tired chewing it.  Maybe that was a good thing because it was also so salty that I had to constantly drink water.  3) Pad thai with chicken.  Same problem with dryness of chicken.  The noodles were also horribly clumped together as if they used day old rice noodles.4) Rice.  Adding insult to injury they didn't even pack the rice carton fully.  It was maybe 3/4 full.  It's white rice, people, it maybe costs cents to fill up the carton.We were looking forward to ordering from this place and were very disappointed with the service (via phone, delivery) and the quality of the food.
2014-11-24,3,Gave it plenty of time and another chance. Two, in fact. Vastly improved! The taste is back.
2014-11-07,3,The food was fine.  The service was so-so, but I'm just assertive about things to get my meal and get outta there.  Not their fault, I'm always in a hurry.  It was fine and I even had enough cash on me to pay the bill and tip.
2014-10-28,5,5 stars for what it is, your dependable neighborhood cheap Thai delivery spot. Don't eat here. It's a hole in the wall. Delivery is solid and takes 20 minutes. Drink your bottle of wine at home. Normally I judge a Thai place by the Penang curry. There's is scrumptious, but not my favorite menu item by a lot. These are the things you need to try:*paw pia sod - crab, Chinese sausage, bean sprouts, egg, in a steamed spring roll with plum sauce - light but packed with flavor *larb nau - ground beef with chili, lemon juice, and herbs - brightness of the citrus sets off the savory and spicy beef*kai pad ped/nau pad ped/lamb pad ped - chicken beef or lamb with eggplant in red chili paste curry - what do they do to that eggplant it's like crack?!?! Not a drop of that sauce goes to waste in my houseStop ordering pad Thai, try the aforementioned items, tell them not to make it white girl spicy but Thai princess spicy, then give hit me up to thank me.
2014-10-26,1,Used to love this place.  This review is solely on their customer service on an order I placed for delivery.  They took my order I gave my address they said 45 minutes.  Fine I call back an hour later they say 10 more minutes.  I understand if they are busy.  I call again 30 minutes later they say we don't deliver to your address and say I'm calling to cancel right?  I'm in shock never had an experience like that.  They didn't even make my food and just played it off like I was calling to cancel then they say sorry don't deliver there.  They could've told me that when i ordered.  Now it's late and I have to order elsewhere and wait again.  As a courtesy they should've sent their driver but they never even made the food.  Very unhappy about how this was handled.  Used to really like their food but this was unacceptable.
2014-10-19,5,My Partner and I go to this place as often as we possible can  it's a BYOB and everything taste so fresh and homemade, the staff does and awesome job to boot . We cant say we ever had a bad meal here . Oh and it wont break the bank on your wallet either.
2014-09-25,1,This is my second time having their food. The first time I ordered takeout. It made me feel very bloated and sick. Today i wanted to try it again but tried something lighter-- vegetable Pad Wun Sen. It is so very salty that i can not even eat it. What a disapoinment. I spent $16 with delivery and tip and I will have to throw it away. I saw reviews that said it was very salty- guess i should have listened!
2014-09-21,5,I've dined at this establishment many times and receive the same five-star quality service and food every time! I'm currently here, waiting for my house salad with the yummiest peanut salad dressing and Kai Sup-pa rod!! I love the peanuts in the main dishes smothered in the awesome Thai seasoning! I even came here during the World Cup and the live feed on their television was seconds ahead of the bar across the street, so I knew what exciting action had already taken place before hearing the reaction across the street. This place is that good! It's light years ahead of the competition! I'll be back, but until then it's time to feast!
2014-09-17,4,The food was extremely reasonably priced, but the portions were a tad on the small side. Service was good and the food was flavorful.
2014-09-02,4,So many negative reviews have left me befuddled. The food here is absolutely amazing. Who cares what building is next door? This is Hoboken people, not Harlem. Yes it's tiny inside, but I'm here for good food!  The place is clean too. As I do with all new restaurants, I check the bathroom. Clean bathroom = clean kitchen. I've had takeout on many occasions, have dined in a handful of times, and I'm never disappointed. It's a traditional menu that won't let you down. Yes it's the "standard unimaginative" according to another reviewer. But I'm looking for authentic Thai cuisine, not some kind of fusion from the PF Changs menu. Quantities aren't going to overstuff you like we Americans are so accustomed to, but pricing is reflective.I almost always order the spicy eggplant w/tofu, or the vegetable spicy basil dish (pad gra praw I think). Gratefully they make them both for me without using fish sauce. I also ask them to make it extra spicy to which they always accommodate. One minor negative to me is sometimes the smell inside reminds me of cleaning products or bug spray.  It may just be they are frequently exterminating and/or cleaning. Don't let that stop you from coming here though..the food is sooo delish.
2014-09-01,5,This is not your usual Americanized Thai restaurant. I love dining here whenever I'm in Hoboken and craving for some affordable authentic Thai cuisine. The place is quaint, homey and very unpretentious. They offer BYOB and do not charge for corkage fee.The Paw Pia Sod; steamed spring rolls with crab meat, Chinese sausage,egg and bean sprouts is a delicious appetizer and a great  dish to share.The Tom kha koong; coconut milk soup based with shrimp is always on my list. While Larb Moo; ground pork with chili, lemon juice and Thai herb served with lettuce and Jasmine rice is my all time favorite. the balance between spice and citrus flavor suits my palate.In summary, a great place to dine that serves freshly cooked Thai dishes!
2014-08-04,2,Well I visited this restaurant for dinner, waitresses were really friendly and attentive, also they smiled(which is missing in most of the thai restaurants I visited so far). Service was pretty fast and good. But we did not like their food that much, quantity and taste both were not impressive. Did not like their thai iced tea also it was too sweet for my tastebuds. Not sure about my next visit :-/
2014-07-24,3,I have visited Sri Thai many times. I think their got decent foods.Their curry is a little bit salty to me. Their pad thai is okay, and they spicy noodle is good. I like their Thai beverages because they are cheap($2), and they drinks okay!What I would recommend is their desert: Mango sticky rice.I would say it is very very tasty. The coconut sauce sprinkled on sticky rice just make everything right. Highly recommended!
2014-07-18,5,As the Duke here at Sri Thai, it is absolutely outrageous that I have not yet written a review.  (This is after all, my favorite go to spot in Hoboken)Simply put, this is the BEST THAI IN HOBOKEN! Add on the BYOB and you've got a home run, ladies and gents!The employees are as friendly as ever and the food is spectacular. From the curries, to the stir fries, to the noodles. I have tried and loved them all. Trust me and don't go anywhere else for your Thai!
2014-06-26,1,This place didn't look so great from the outside or inside but we thought we would try a new Thai spot in town.   When you walk into the restaurant it immediately smells like a dirty dog kennel.  The odor was really bad.  I love animals and I'm telling you this place stunk!  My friend insisted on giving it a shot and I didn't want to be a prude about it, so I gave in.  The chicken puff app was okay and the Tom kha soup was salty but ok.  Our pad thai entrees were less then mediocre and it's not that hard to mess up.  Will never go back.   I always try to say at least one good thing and in this case the staff was very nice and polite. I'm convinced this place has dozens of dogs in the basement or it was once a dog grooming salon...idk but the odor was gross and undeniable!
2014-06-21,2,I went here in need of good Thai curry. I come from Hawaii, where everything is pretty authentic with a local flair. I had ordered to Red Curry with Sticky Rice to easy my palette, but was let down a bit. The curry was somewhat watery and lacked flavour. The stick rice was dry and hard. I will not be returning again.
2014-06-01,2,A small hole-in-the-wall mom&pop affair dishing out the standard unimaginative goop - and not very flavorful at that. Very questionable ingredients - I ordered the masamun seafood and there was a very funky smell of stale / rancid oil in it.The only redeeming factor is that its cheap.
2014-05-19,4,Yum. That it is all. Just kidding. The place is quit small inside, making it more intimate. Tables are lit by a candle, and it's byob, so it's a real good place for a small group of friends to have a pleasant meal. The food is awesome! Pad Thai and spicy noodles are better than most Thai places I've been to so far. And what's best is, the prices are cheap relative to hoboken standard.
2014-05-07,4,I've ordered out from Sri Thai at least 10 times, and they have always delivered extremely quickly. The food is always hot, and I've never had a meal that I didn't like. The Pad Thai with chicken, shrimp, or calamari is one of the best I've ever had.I'm taking off one star for the dine-in experience. The wait staff was extremely friendly and attentive, but the establishment has a bit of a bathroom smell to it. It's a small place, and these kinds of problems are normal in a city, but it was a little bothersome. I'd recommend getting delivery over dining in. To clarify, the place is not dirty by any means!
2014-03-18,3,We ordered from here Friday night. The Thai iced tea was great - as were the spring rolls. Unfortunately, neither of our meals was all that good. I've eaten there in the past and thought it was "good' though not great. Three stars it is.
2014-02-19,4,Best friend introduced me to Sri Thai. I love this place. My favorite Thai place. I don't get the low reviews. It's a simple, small spot on a corner.  Nothing fancy, which I like. Price is fair, staff is great. Selection seems just fine. Quality not quantity. :)
2014-02-16,2,I ordered from Sri Thai through an online service on 2/16/14.  I ordered Red curry, steamed dumplings,  shrimp pad thai, and Tom Yum soup.  Overall, their food was underwhelming.  First, I waited 60 minutes for them to deliver ( I live 7 blocks away.)  The food arrived cold.  Granted, there is snow on the ground.  4 dumplings for $5.50.  The pad thai was almost tasteless.  The pad thai was dry, like it had been sitting out for hours.  Also, there was almost no sauce in the container.The soup had no thai flavors, but tasted like it had all chinese food ingredients.  The red curry was just standard.My friends have told me that "this was THE place" to get Thai food.  But next time I want thai food, I will try another place.
2014-02-14,4,Hoboken New Jersey charming small-town about 10 miles from MetLife stadium.Had a taste for some spicy Thai,How hot do you like it? 7This dish was very delicious.
2013-12-19,2,I'm giving them 2 stars based on their delivery service.  The past two times I've ordered delivery from them, something has been significantly wrong.  The first time I received the wrong order, and the second time it took an hour and a half to get my food on a non busy day of the week. It's disappointing because they are my favorite thai food in Hoboken.  I'm hoping their delivery service will make significant changes.
2013-12-10,4,I used to live a few blocks away from Sri Thai from '92-'03 and was a big fan during that time (Chicken w/ Basil Leaves & Chili was my favorite dish). I spent the last 10 years in Jersey City and just returned to Hoboken two months ago - it's nice to see that Sri Thai still serves good Thai dishes at very reasonable prices, and that it's still BYOB.
2013-11-18,3,It's a small little Thai restaurant that's just average. I'd even give it a 2.5. I ordered the Pad Se Ew and have had way better pretty much from every other Thai place I've ever been to. Something about this dish was off. My dish should have 10 bucks instead of 13. Oh well. I'd probably not come here again unless a friend was adamant about it..
2013-11-13,2,I should start making a list of THINGS I HATE ABOUT HOBOKENand really SRI THAI THAI RESTAURANT would be in that categoryI came on a Sunday afternoon with my GF on a casual date, thinking that I've passed by here on several occasions, why not try it out... I am no Thai Aficionado   to Thai establishments so I was optimistic, but as soon as I went through the doors I knew that something was off about this place...Looking down the menu, there I looked for your typical Thai dishes.PAD THAI - Check - JUST Pad ThaiBut I thought maybe there is different types of PAD THAI out there - any way carry onPAPAYA SALAD - CheckPANANG CHICKEN - CheckPineapple Fried Rice - ? not there (one of my favorite dishes on the planet)Fine, if you are not going have pineapple fried rice then I'll give you a pass. But waiting patiently for our food I noticed there wasn't any key elements in the Restaurant that I would see at a more authentic Thai restoFor example:No traditional Thai ShrineNone of the Thai 'Zen' Musicand NO SPICE RACK!!!!I asked the waitress the spice rack and she looked at me like i had 3 heads!!! NO No no, I'm sorry Hobokenites this isn't Thai foodPass
2013-11-08,4,I'm actually fairly surprised by the relatively low reviews for sri. I've always tended to get fresh tasting plates with clean flavor. We normally get the currys, along with a padthai to share. Place is small, but they move fast. Take out is where it's at though. And if you read Kim G.'s review, disregard the ridiculous comment about the homeless shelter. If you're afraid of a few people trying to get a hot meal, move out to suburbia and go to olive garden, you horrible yuppie.
2013-10-28,5,Love this place, try the green beans with chili paste, or the spicy noodle.  Never disapointed, delivery is always fast.  Love this place. Also on the appetizer menu they have these amazing puffs that have mildly spiced potato inside, with a watery cucumber dipping glaze.... Omg it is soooo good.  Gt an order for every two people in your group.
2013-09-21,3,This place is located  on a corner off the beaten path of Hoboken's strip.  Its next to a homeless shelter. I was super scared walking  from where we parked our car up the block. I had to hold my date super close, take out the sharpest object i had in my bag, and take out my new taser attachment that i just bought thats attaches to my new iphone!! Lol  I was hoping no one lunged at me while walking passed.  Pretty scary.  Ok back to writing this review. We were going to sit outside because it was beautiful out, but well we opted not to.  The place inside is super small.  Its nice but has no ambience.   We order chicken and shrimp pad thai and ginger duck.  And two thai teas.   The food was okay. Nothing spectacular.   The pad thai was full of peanuts, which i was told thats what it is suppose to be and it had a ton of lemon grass in the mix.  The duck was good but a little over done. Will i come back here? Im gonna say a big negative. I wont put myself at risk to  come back even if the food was great.
2013-08-17,5,Delicious food with super nice service. Loved trying new dishes here along with the tried and true. BYOB is icing on the cake.
2013-08-03,3,ordered the lamb #60 on the menu, meat was good, maybe a little dry but the peppers didn't have much flavors. My friends ordered the chicken with peppers and onions, it was tasty, i found most of their food contain peppers and onions, same ingredients. 3 ppl for $38 no appetizer. The place wasn't expensive but don't expect too much. I want to try the shrimp and squid next time.
2013-07-29,1,Last friday, my roommate and I had our food delivered to our apartment from Sri Thai for dinner.  To our disappointment, they messed up my roommates order.  Instead of delivering spicy shrimp basil with fried rice with a side of hot sauce, they gave us spicy shrimp basil with a side of white rice and no hot sauce.  When we called to say they messed up our order, they said it was our fault!  They finally said they'll make a delivery with our original order of spicy shrimp basil with fried rice and we reminded them to bring hot sauce as well.  They requested us to give back the spicy shrimp with the white rice. We thought that was very strange because it's not like they will give that order to another customer, right?  When they came back a second time, I checked to see it was fried rice, and it was.  However, there was only 2 shrimp with this order and no hot sauce included.  After this whole ordeal, we will definitely not order from this place ever again!
2013-07-14,4,I have been here a few times. The pad Thai, spicy squid noodle and green curry are all yummy. A friend of mine who is Thai told me that her mother fully approves! It's BYOB, which is always nice! The last time we went here, it was late, and I felt like the waitress was rushing us. She forgot an app order that our friends had placed. Otherwise, the food has always been great. Also, they do free delivery, so the last few time I've ordered I have done takeout. They are relatively fast, and always show up sooner than they tell you.
2013-07-13,4,Went there for the first time recently and was impressed with the quality of food. Got the Green Papaya Salad and some sort of spring roll I cannot even type, let along pronounce. Regardless both were fantastic and I will be back
2013-07-11,4,Really excellent. Terrific flavors, very fresh ingredients. I love ALMOST everything about it. What I don't like is the really dumpy digs. I opt either to sit outside in nice weather or take out. They really need a decor update!! But don't let that deter you, the food is great and very reasonable.
2013-06-01,3,We came here with friends as a "plan C" after finding out Charrito's had an hour-long wait and were almost out of beans, rice and guacamole, and that Karma Kafe wasn't BYOB.We came a little late, so that could have had an impact on the service we got, but really, that's no excuse. To start, our friends each ordered soup and we ordered the dragonfly steamed dumplings. Our friends soup came pretty quickly, but our dumplings never did. I still can't understand how they were forgotten, since we had to clarify with her which dumplings we wanted from the menu. In any case, it turned out to be okay for me because my dish was more than big enough to fill me; my husband, on the other hang, was left with a hunger pang that he ended up curing once we got back home.I ordered the pad Thai, which had really great flavor. My only complaint was that the egg wasn't broken up enough, so it was more like having pad Thai dumped on top of a fried egg, rather than having the egg mixed well throughout. The service was pretty good aside from forgetting our dumplings, but maybe the quality was a little subpar because we arrived there somewhat late. By the end of our meal, our server was hurrying us along a little bit and when we looked inside the whole staff was sitting at a table eating "family meal" together to finish their night.I'd be willing to give this place another try, earlier in the evening, to see if the service and quality improve a little. Stay tuned...
2013-05-31,2,The food is OK but definitely had better - small place and can get crowded and tight.  Tables are very close together.
2013-05-07,2,This review is based on a visit several years ago.  Things may have improved, but I haven't been back to see if they have.  I really didn't enjoy my food here at all.  It all tasted like greasy Chinese food as opposed to fresh and somewhat healthy Thai food.  We all have a group of friends whose opinions we can use as encouragement to do the opposite of what they suggest.  My friends who I went here with don't exactly have worldly food pallets.  The only reason we went is because two of them went here a week prior and loved it (it was their first time trying Thai food).  I don't want to harsh, but that reinforces my impression.  I will not be back.
2013-04-05,1,I waited TWO AND A HALF HOURS for my order. I repeatedly called and asked for a status and was just jerked around by the hostess who kept lying to me, otherwise I would have cancelled my order. Never again from this place. It was only a few blocks from my apt!
2013-03-30,3,Great Thai Food. Not the best I've had but great! The staff was pleasant. The place is very small and not a lot of room to move around. If you like to have a cocktail with your meal, BYOB. They allow you to bring your own Bottle, which is great! The price was reasonably cheap too... which was extra great!
2013-03-24,2,Went here once for dinner and the food was 3 stars or so, but there was a cockroach on the wall next to our table.  Having worked in restaurants before I understand they get in sometimes, but it was still difficult for my dining companion.  Tried to give it another shot by ordering takeout, but the dish was so heavy with fish sauce it smelled/tasted rotten and I couldn't even eat it.This was a while ago (8 months?)... I'm gonna give it some time and try again because it looks like there are some decent reviews on here....
2013-03-17,3,The quality of their food seems to have gone down a bit but the only two dishes that seem to have retained its great taste are their See Ew noodles and their house soup. Take note that they are closed on Tuesdays - sort of strange, but good to know nonetheless.
2013-02-26,4,First impressions aren't always right. I steered clear of this place because of the looks of it from outside, but caved one night on a search for pad thai. Hands down best thai in hoboken. Super fast delivery, great portions and they've always gotten my order right!Best plate on the menu: tofu and veggie panang curry
2012-12-02,5,This place is terrific.  Delicious, relatively inexpensive, and super-fast delivery.  Strongly recommend the Triple Delight.
2012-11-29,4,My boyfriend and I decided to try Sri Thai after it was recommended by our friend. He had never had Thai food before and this was a great start!The place is a little small (about 12 tables) but its extremely cozy and authentically decorated. As a plus it is also a BYOB :) The staff was very friendly and even altered something on the menu to our liking without a fuss. Since it was his first time we stuck to the basics but everything was really good!To start we had the Sate Koong, which was shrimp skewers with peanut sauce and cucumber sauce. Although the portion was small, only two skewers (normally I get 4 at other places) it was very good!We then had chicken pad thai ( a norm) and beef cashew nut. Everything was seasoned to perfection and delightful. The beef was spicy which I loved!The prices are reasonable. Dinner for 2 came to $25. Not bad at all!I will definitely be coming back here when I need a Thai fix, and so will the newbie bf!
2012-11-07,4,Friendly, prompt staff and very tasty Thai food. This place is byob but there is no "corkage fee" so eating here is not only tasty but a great value too! Try the appetizer assortment. Word to the wise- there hot sauce is VERY hot!
2012-10-16,2,Still have not found a "great" thai place around Hoboken.  The soup was ok, but I like Casual Thai's soup better.  The red curry is flavorful and spicy even with the medium which is better than the majority of the places around.  My favorite thai place is still a cute restaurant in a suburb of Detroit Michigan.  Does anyone have any suggestions on good Thai places?!?!  This place is also not open on Tuesday which I am not a fan of.  Take your chances, just another blah Thai restaurant.  *Enjoy*
2012-10-06,4,I first stumbled upon this place 20 years ago while on a bad date at the bar across the street......hungry and drunk for something, anything and as a native New Yorker always leary about unknown take out Thai places but was AMAZED by the quality of the food here....I admit, it's not a five star restaurant by any means but that being said, for a no nonsense place in New Jersey, it is the best.  Don't listen to any of the other reviews, especially those of folks from NJ.  It is salty, and delicious and def some of the best Thai you can get across the river....It may have lost some of its lackluster over the years but still beats the hell out of any of its local competitors.  Sri Thai is awesome...and compared to some of the other local eateries, still a worthwhile option while in Hoboken (which is in my opinion, not a culinary town to begin with.)  Get the soft shell crab in August (when in season) with Tamarind sauce.  To die for!
2012-09-28,1,Waiters are not professional. They even let customer to serve food by their self. Customer have to waiting long time for their order without a glass of water. I was very disappointed with the restaurant. Don't go to eat there.
2012-09-27,4,I, by no means, claim to be a Thai food expert but I really enjoyed Sri's Pad Thai! I added some tofu to it for an extra $1. Placed my order over the phone and they were at my place within minutes. No complaints here and I look forward to trying something else .
2012-09-06,4,I love this place. To me its the best choice for Thai in hoboken by a  long shot. The food is absolutely delish.  Don't expect to come here for the amazing service, that is where they lack a bit, but if you want good thai food this is the spot. My favorite is probably the basil chicken and the ginger beef. any of the basil dishes are amazing. I order from here more than actually going. Its nice that it is BYOB and across the street from cork city.
2012-08-17,1,Please take the time to read this review if you truly care where you spend your money and leisure time  to eat. By far the most awful seating, atrocious food, too greasy, and salty. So loud and cluttered that felt I was conversing with everybody in there . And to top it off a baby cockroach crawling under the table next to us and , if you don't leave a pricy enough tip, you will have one of their staff running after you on street try to get more from you. A true story. That's what happened to me. Starve but don't go here ever.
2012-07-31,1,I used to love Sri Thai until i found a baby cockroach in my rice. nuff said.
2012-07-23,3,This is my go-to Thai restuarant while in Hoboken. They give a generous amount of  always delicous food. The wait staff needs to improve, they lack friendliness...but who cares about them anyway...I always know what I want from their menu, I never subtitute anything...so I guess, I really do not need them to be nice...just get me my food and Thai tea, thank you.
2012-06-11,3,Been here a few times and it's ok. Most times my pad thai is ok, another time it's been too lemony. Chicken satay is good with the peanut sauce. Thai iced tea is good. Outdoor seating also a plus.
2012-05-03,3,Chicken Curry Puffs Yum !!!
2012-04-24,3,This is your average Thai place.  My party of three ordered Nua gra Prow and your standard pad thai with chicken.  We also got good spring rolls and pork dumplings.  Portions were good, but service could have been better.  I asked for sriracha sauce and was rebuffed, but asking for chili paste on a future visit  from our waitress resulted in the condiment finally being delivered to the table (a mandatory part of thai-american cuisine).Overall the food is good, but the service is somewhat lackadaisical and hit/miss.  When I asked for a common condiment like sriracha I was given a "what are you talking about" look, but asking for chili paste solved the issue.  I will go back for the food, but not necessarily the service.
2012-04-18,5,Favorite take-out in the neighborhood. Soooo good. We like the pad thai, corn patties, and shrimp with pineapple. Bang for your buck!! Sometimes their phone doesn't work. Just try again!
2012-04-16,4,Came with a group of friends and had an amazing meal! Amazing food and very friendly staff - BYOB is always nice...and the fried ice cream was to die for!
2012-04-11,4,I was pretty happy with the menu and the food portions.Thai Ice tea is just too good and their tom yum soup is delicious. BYOB is always a big PLUS. You are basically looking for a small family owned business on Bloomfield street, just 5 minutes away from busy Washington Street.I would definitely go there again.
2012-04-09,2,It does the trick if you need a thai fix but its nothing to write home or on yelp about.  The thai ice tea is very good and the yellow curry (onions & pot) is very good.  Most other dishes are usually overcooked and forgetful.
2012-03-25,5,After reading other yelpers mixed reviews I was eager to try this spot. Having been to Thailand myself, I typically rate a place based on their Tom Kha Kai soup- my expectations were met. I would highly recommend the Thai iced tea as well- one of the best I have ever had. I noticed many fellow yelpers gave poor reviews to Sri Thai based on the pad thai dish...... pad thai is an americanized thai dish, you wouldn't order a burger at a sushi restaurant so don't order pad thai at a Thai restaurant and base your whole review off of it.  I will definitely be going back here and/or ordering delivery. I want to try the Panang  next ( another traditional Thai dish).I also found the service to be very friendly and efficient. And BYO is always a plus!!!
2012-03-21,1,We ate there last week, and I had a vegetable curry with shrimp. My boyfriend ordered shrimp in a tomato sauce. The food tasted delicious, but about a third of the way into the meal, I felt a stringy material in my throat. I pushed my finger to the back of my mouth and pulled a long hair, about 18 inches, from my throat. It was obviously a human head hair that had fallen into the food.  We were both grossed out and couldn't eat anymore. The waitress took the hair from me and apologized and asked me if I wanted the rest of my food to go! We were stunned, said no, and asked for the manager. A young kid came to us and said the long string in my food was not a hair. When I asked what it was, he said he said he didn't know, but insisted it wasn't a hair. He then offered to give us a 20% discount off the entire dinner. We were shocked and insulted by how poorly he handled this awful and unhygienic misstep, we offered to only pay for my boyfriend's meal and our appetizer. I refused to pay for my dinner and we left in a huff. The manager didn't handle the situation very professionally and we are very upset and disappointed, as this was our 3rd time, but we're NEVER going back.
2012-03-16,1,Oh lord! Why did I ever eat here and waste a wonderful friday evening. We had to wait forever to place  our food order. Finally we had to call someone to take it, and the food arrived almost instantly. Read 25 minutes to place the order and 10 minutes to have it all on the table. Anyway the green curry  was Too salty and the other appetizers and entres below average. The decor & service ...err wait what decor & service? Do not recommend and very avoidable. Reasonable priced but I would rather pay 3 bucks more and eat decent food elsewhere.
2012-03-15,3,Sri ThaiGET it because I don't have to get on the path for SUPER good Decent Priced Thai FoodVery close to my apartment. I am a TOM YUM extra spicy nut and theirs is good but I like to add noodles to mine they are not a fan of customizing. The place is very quaint and #1 thing is BYOB and that just awesomeThe wait staff, each time I have been there has been the same girl she isn't the most warming or person she gets the job fun. ahem cough cough no small that "what do you want" the tables are on top of each otherFor some reason me and my friends like the table next to window and we walk right up the street to Washington Liquors to get our drink of choicePad Thai, Pad Kee Mao  all your essentials are here. I have never been here with anyone who has not enjoyed it hereOhh and there is free wifi well from the Across the street bar. so when it's nice outside on the patio I can have my TOM YUM and play with my Touchpad!!  (wait that didn't sound right) ITS A Tablet's God's sake !!
2012-03-11,2,This place is pretty average in every way. I was excited to see a Thai staff running the place, but that is where the excitement ended. Very little chicken in my dish, not much flavor, and the noodles were really dense and clumped together. Filled me up, but I wont be back
2012-03-10,3,Finally got the chance to dine in after a few takeout stints. Small space, slightly above average Thai. The food comes out alarmingly fast. Even on a Saturday night, the wait time was manageable, although we were squeezed between two couples - one clearly on a first date, the other barely spoke. Delightful!BYOB and very reasonably priced. Not sure if they take reservations, but if you're looking to for a big group dinner, I would look elsewhere.
2012-02-03,4,Pretty good lunch spot!  I ordered a chicken pad thai for only $7 and had a substantial meal.  You also MUST have the thai tea.  I have no idea what's in it but its amazing.Seating shouldn't be a problem, I've never seen the restaurant full.  If you're in the mood for Thai though Sri Thai should be on your list.
2012-01-09,4,This is the best Thai place in Hoboken, hands down. The larb moo (ground spicy pork in lettuce wraps) it awesome, and as it Hori Jori (sp?). Delivery is always fast and the only thing I've ever been disappointed in there is the scallops. If you are eating there, it is pretty much no fills dining, but the service is good.
2011-12-31,4,Sri Thai wasn't the first place where I tried Thai food, but once I had it there, I got hooked.  Now everywhere I go I want to eat thai, but the only problem is, I can never be as satisfied as I am in Sri thai.  Soooo i'm pretty much have given up on trying anywhere else because nothing will compare.  This isn't the place for a date or a fancy outing, it's just great and fast food.  You know it's great when a place in Hoboken off the main strip is always packed.
2011-12-05,5,Best Thai in Hoboken!  Went to Sri Thai with 3 girlfriends last Thursday.  They're still raving about it to me.  Had the tofu pad thai which was excellent!  Two of my friends also got the pad thai, and one of my friends had vegetables in a garlic sauce.  The veggies in garlic sauce was delicious...very garlicky :)  BYOB!  Also tried the papaya salad and the spring rolls...both were fantastic. It's definitely on the smaller side, but I don't mind being cozy.  I enjoyed the atmosphere overall.  Ordered takeout from Sri Thai a couple of months ago.  I was told that the delivery would take 45 minutes and it only took about 15.  Can't wait to dine in again!!!!!!!!
2011-11-17,5,Honestly the best Thai I have had on the East Coast. Great food, flavors and quick on delivery. Decent for the price compared to some other places. I always forget about it because its not on a delivery sight which is a huge over sight on my part. I have yet to be disappointed. I recommend the pad thai, panang curry, fried rice, and prik king (sp?).
2011-10-28,1,Sri Thai you let me down!  A couple of weeks ago I got food posioning from the yellow curry!I used to love Sri Thai... I have been there over 20 times... I had gotten the yellow curry (masaman) at least 10 times... this time it looked a little... off... but I had eaten there so many times I didn't think it would be a big deal... it was a big deal... took almost a week to get better!!!(And before making this claim I made sure it has to be sri thai --- I hadn't eaten anything else for hours before and nothing else after)
2011-10-17,4,Yep, still the best Thai food in Hoboken by far.  Here's the trick, though...Order something on the authentic side and you will be beyond impressed.  Order more "Americanized" dishes (i.e. Pad Thai) and you likely will be underwhelmed.  I HIGHLY recommend the panang curry.  Trust me...you (and your taste buds) will thank me.
2011-10-12,5,Sri ThaiThailand's Culinary Finest!!  "Hoboken" otherwise known as the little gem of New Jersey, is full of history, streets lined with Brownstones and home of lengendry icon Frank Sinatra who's famous song "New York, New York"  states "if you can make it there you can make it anywhere" is a short train ride on the path and you can be in Manhatten in as little as 20 minutes, consider it the best of both worlds.  Back in the day, Hoboken was the place to be, but then like alot of places it had gone down hill for many years until just recently, life has been restowed, and in a big way.  The main street which is Washington is full of unique shops & restaurants, including the lengendary Grimaldi's Pizzaria, the original is located right under the Brooklyn Bridge, then there is The Hoboken Bar & Grill a mainstay for many years and TLC's Carlo's Bake Shop.  But it is some of the side streets where you can find the most ecletic, artsy and unique places to eat.  So, whatever it is you might be in the mood for Italian, Indian, American, Chinese, Thai, etc. there is a wide variety to choose from at any stand point .  Sri Thai, located on Bloomfield Street, is a converted ground floor space of a brownstone that has an inside and outside seating area.  Inside is very small with a possablity of rubbing elbows with the customer at the next table, and outside, depending on where you are sitting is a bit unlevel, so there might be a little shaking of the table, but beleive me once you start your eating journey here you will not care where you are sitting.   Coming out of their kitchen is the the most authentic Thai cuisine you will ever eat.  Known for their Pad Thai, people drive from afar to experience it and everyone that was there was enjoying it.  Starting off with an appetizer of Steamed Dumplings accompanied with a Chili dipping sauce.  Tender little pockets of wonton dough filled with ground pork and shrimp that were stemmed to perfection and absolutely delicious, add the chili dipping sauce for the extra kick of spice.  For the entree's, of course, I ordered the Pad Thai with Pork, the other choices were Chicken, Beef, Shrimp or Vegetables and Ka Sup-pa-rod.  The Pad Thai which is rice noodles, egg, bean sprouts, and tender sliced pork glazed in a peanut sauce, was out of this world!!The Ka Sup-pa-rod, sliced sauteed chicken, peppers, onions, pinapple, and cashews in a chili sauce was spicy and bursting with flavor..  Honestly we could not get enough of either one.  Both dishes were plentiful and the service was outstanding.   If your looking to experience traditional Thai Cuisine this is the place, keeping in mind Thai is traditionally spicy, so no need to ask to make it more unless you like it hot, hot, hot!!!Sri Thai234 Bloomfield StreetHoboken, NJ 07030(201)798-4822BYOBDelivery is avaliableAccepts Major Credit Cards over $10.00On street parkingPrices: Extremley Reasonable
2011-08-29,5,How is it that I haven't written a review for Sri Thai yet!?This is my favorite thai place in hoboken, maybe even of the ones ive tried in NYC as well. You know the places that you're apprehensive to speak about for fear that people will go see how good it is, then forever ruin it with long wait times? this is that place for me.i noticed other reviews and some peeps aren't loving the pad thai. i've never had the pad thai here, but i DO think that its a dish that people have lots of differing expectations for. some like sweet, spicy, tangy, saucy, dry, crunchy--so its difficult to find a place with pad thai to your liking. i've only found one place that i like, from a place called Luscious thai, near the 59th st bridge on the UES!if you're thinking of ordering something else, i'd check out any of the dishes with chili and thai basil, the triple or double delight, spicy noodle (like pad see ew, but better) or any of the curries (i think green is the best!) my man likes the ground pork dish, and we always split an order of the chicken satay. the sauces are great.best part is that the prices are super reasonable. BYOB always helps, but the main dishes are $9-$12 that are big and come with rice. service is hit or miss. there are 2 women who answer the phones, serve the food, bus the tables, pack up the takeout/delivery, refill the water etc, so if its busy it may be slow, but its worth it. but where are you rushing off to anyway? bring a bottle of wine and relax! :o)
2011-08-15,2,I would give this place a three but for its underwhelming service. The food is decent, not great, but pretty good by Hoboken's standards. When I want a Thai fix in this city (I only work in Hoboken so it's generally for lunch), my default is Sri Thai. I usually get the Pad See Euw.That said, the service definitely has room for improvement. I usually get take-out here, and unless I specifically remembered to ask for it, they have never provided me with eating utensils or napkins, they just give the food and that's it. Once I ordered takeout with a friend and he ordered Thai Iced Tea, and instead of a normal cup, it simply came in an awkwardly squat soup container. So if you order from this place, expect them to cut corners. Despite all that, I will still continue to order food from here from time to time, at least until Hoboken gets a better Thai restaurant.
2011-08-13,1,No thank you.  Maybe I'm a spoiled Thai food connoisseur (see my review on Thai Tom), but I can make better Thai in my closet-sized kitchen than the food I had here.  My BF and I shared the phad thai, which had no spice whatsoever, and was bland and watery.  We also had a steamed vegetable dish with peanut sauce, which was unseasoned, watery, and the sauce barely tasted like anything, let alone peanut.  There were two other tables at the restaurant while I was there, but we still didn't get our undericed Thai iced teas until we got our food and I finally asked for them to be brought out.I wish I could recommend a better Thai food alternative in Hoboken, but I haven't found one...yet.  In the meantime, go to Bangkok Thai, which is at least better.
2011-07-28,4,Really love this place.  Never crowded, great service, delicious pad thai and green curry.  A consistent favorite for good, solid thai food.
2011-07-22,2,I went there today for dinner, and ordered pad thai, massaman curry, and thai iced teas. First of all, their air conditioner doesn't work well, which makes the inside of the restaurant hot/humid. Their waters are served lukewarm with inadequate ice, their massaman curry was way too salty, and their thai iced teas were only average. Their pad thai, however, was decent. I'll mostly order pad thai to go in the future, but won't eat inside the restaurant/nor order their massaman curry ever again.
2011-07-16,4,Their Tom Yum soup is delicious.  I've tried many of their dishes (sans the pad thai).  I like their food!  Keep in mind that the place is very small and lacks air conditioning.  I suggest getting take-out.
2011-06-04,2,Came here for dinner with a girlfriend after reading these reviews and was sorely disappointed.Shrimp spring rolls - When these arrived at our table, they were hardly recognizable. I don't know where they got the spring roll wrappers or what the chef was thinking but these were by far the WORST spring rolls I've ever had at a Thai restaurant. They were absolutely disgusting.Shrimp Pad Thai - After the spring rolls, our expectations were sufficiently lowered. The pad thai was passable, although not nearly on par with Pad Thai found at other normal Thai restaurants. Even the Malaysian place on Wash and 1st makes better pad thai than this restaurant!Overall, this place was awful. I will never go back. And you shouldn't either.
2011-03-31,3,I am AJ C.'s gf and I feel like he was being a little harsh. Yes, it took us a while to get the waitress' attention when his sri thai delight wound up being awful, but she took it back no problem and brought him a beef pad thai promptly and with apologies. Both of our pad thais were OK, place was small and cramped but probably wouldn't be bad as a takeout (that seemed to be what most of their service consisted of anyway). All in all, three stars seems appropriate as it is just ok.
2011-03-26,1,Went here last week with my girlfriend.  A really small kind of hole in the wall with not much ambience.  We started with veggie spring rolls which were average.  I had the sri thai delight which consisted of chicken, beef and shrimp in a spicy sauce.  It was awful, it smelled like dead fish.  Tried to send it back, but took forever for our waitress to notice us and check how we were doing.  I then sent it back (which i never do) then ordered beef pad thai which was OK.  My gf had tofu pad thai which was equally as mediocre.  If you want thai in Hoboken, try elsewhere
2011-03-01,3,Love that you can make reservations. Best Thai in Hoboken even if I am a little traumatized from seeing a roach on the wall. Better than in the food I guess.  Anyway it hasn't stopped me from going back.  Papaya salad, Tom Yum, some type of green curry, and Pad Thai makes for a good meal.
2010-10-24,4,We've gone here several times over the years, but this last time was noticeably better than prior visits - I think they've updated the place - newer chairs and tables, fresh paint - menu appears to have been updated.  That being said - this is the best deal in town - Tom Yum is great, good tofu dishes, all of the curries are delicious, and it's inexpensive.  Service is fast, just a nice local Thai place.
2010-07-29,5,Fantastic, authentic Thai food.  I've been coming here for many years and have yet to find any other Thai restaurant that even comes close.  It's BYOB which is just perfect for the small, quiet atmosphere of this place.  Food is always fresh and made to order.  The dishes are full of flavor without an outrageous price tag.  Beware:  Closed Tuesdays!!
2010-07-14,2,I did not really like this place. My pad thai was decent but my sister and best friend also ordered pad thai and their's tasted either too lemony or too too lemony. I felt really bad for my best friend because her pad thai was too too lemony. That's poor service on the Chef's part. I also ordered the curry puff and I didn't like it too much. It was sort of dry and flaky. The potatoes weren't savory. This place is hit or miss really. I guess it depends on what chef is working that day or how the chef feels when he's making your dish. There are a couple of other Thai restaurants in the area so I don't see myself visiting this one again anytime soon.
2010-06-11,4,Love the food at this place!  A definite must if you like Thai and you're in the area!  Not the trendiest place if you're looking for that, but it's a cool small spot.
2010-05-07,4,And how! Delicious chicken in chili and basil sauce! This is the main reason for the 4 stars. It's always so freakin good! Appetizers I've had are good but not great. If you stick with classics they should satisfy. The tom yom koong (sp?) soup with shrimp is exceptional. Between that and gra praw (chili-basil sauce) your taste buds will light up.....and will be hot for many hours afterwards. My girlfriend had a dish with ginger which wasn't listed as an ingredient and neither of us liked it much due to that. They should list strong ingredients like that in the description. Seems like would've been pretty good without ginger. Disappointingly we also ordered a shrimp dish for $14 that only came with 5 average size shrimp. Booooo!!  Anyway......I usually do takeout or delivery. In the restaurant the atmosphere is fine if it's crowded, otherwise you'll feel like a thai family is cooking for just you...and it's very quiet...and kinda weird. It's BYO which is nice.
2010-03-01,2,This restaurant is okay, but I've had better. I ordered a staple -- chicken pad see-ew. It was too wet/soggy. The service was good though -- my cup of water must've been refilled 4x. Went during off-hours (3 p.m. on a Saturday), so maybe that's why the food wasn't great? Not sure.Pretty small restaurant though.
2010-02-16,3,There's no doubt that this little Thai joint makes the most flavorful and fresh-ingredient-filled food in town. The Pad Thai is awesome, and the curry sauces are rich and addictive. But. The pork was inedible on a recent occasion. Just a tough, chewy disappointment. Not a tender morsel to be found.  I'll bet the fried shrimp and fish dishes are outstanding, will have to give those a shot. But c'mon guys, put some love n care into the meat....
2009-12-26,4,Thai it! You'll like it!While I am not sure whether sharing my personal stories with you, the readers, really helps connect with me, I will continue to do so until I think of a better solution. This week marks the one year anniversary when I parted ways with one of my ex girlfriends. But not only has it been a year since I parted with her, but this week also marks the one year anniversary of the last time I had the best Thai food I've ever tasted. My friends and loyal readers know that I used to joke that one of the best parts of the relationship was her mother, who would cook me delicious traditional Thai dishes for lunches and dinners. But the saying that there is a little truth in every joke definitely applies here. In the past year, I have eaten at many Thai places, but nothing could ever compare to the home cooking that I grew accustomed to for over a year. Feeling a bit nostalgic, I decided to continue my search for a suitable replacement and review Sri Thai.On the corner of 3rd and Bloomfield, it's a farther walk than I am used to, which may be why it took me so long to finally try them out. Although a bit dingy on the outside, the inside is surprisingly fresh. Recently renovated, the warm colors dress up this hole in the wall establishment into something a bit more presentable. However, it seemed to me like they tried to jam way too many tables in too small of a space. I could only imagine how crowded and uncomfortable it may get when the place hits peak times. The server was quite but attentive, so I can't complain one way or the other.There were several dishes that my ex's mom would make for me on a regular basis, each of which I tried at Sri Thai. For appetizers, I ordered the Tom Yum Koong Soup, which was shrimp and mushroom with lemon grass in hot and sour broth. The soup was cooked perfectly, and was packed with that sour and spicy flavor that I was looking for. Predictably, I also ordered the Pla Mueg Tod, which was deep fried squid with plum sauce. Although the portion was smaller than expected, the squid was cooked perfectly, not too tough and not too chewy. I also shared the Sri Thai Assorted sampler which came with 2 dumplings, 2 shrimp egg rolls, and what resembled an empanada but stuffed with green curry. Again, small portions on the appetizers, but they embodied the saying quality over quantity. For the main course, my guest ordered the Kang Dang lunch special which was chicken with red curry, coconut milk, and bamboo shoots. It is definitely not a taste that agrees with everyone, but I found it pretty tasty with the chicken being a tad over cooked. I ordered my most favorite of Thai dishes, Pad See Ew, which was beef with stir fried rice noodle, broccoli, and egg. I used to eat this dish twice a day for weeks in a row, so I had some pretty high standards. However, Sri Thai's Pad See Ew scored high marks in my book. Then to finish off we each had a Thai Ice Tea and their version of Fried Ice Cream. While the Thai Ice Tea was about average, the fried ice cream was less flakey and more solid, which can be either hit or miss.Call me odd, but I like to link foods to emotions. Whenever I eat sushi, I think of happy times hanging out with my friends from high school. Whenever I eat platters, I think about all the crazy adventures I've had in college that have ended with that delicious street meat. And when I eat Thai, I will always remember the dozens of meals prepared by a second mother of sorts. While I have all but abandoned to find a restaurant that can offer me the special home cooking I craved, Sri Thai comes very close, which is very high praise.
2009-10-21,3,The place is tiny, but since I only order delivery I'll just rate the food and the food is good. My favorite is Beed Lard (Rad) Na with a side of rice. My only problem with the place is that mild, medium, and hot all seem to have the same level of spice which is goddamnhot. I have a good tolerance to spice but I still have to say "very mild" just to make sure I don't have to fight the spice war the morning after.
2009-08-22,4,I love this place for lunch... for either take out or eat in.  It really is a hole in the wall type place.  Decor is not much to speak of - even though they did refurbish about two years ago.  Lunch special is very good... choice of about 15 entrees that come with soup or salad.  My office is just across the way on the other side of Bloomfield Street, so I eat here at least once a week.  They are closed on Tuesdays, so I made sure that's the day I am in my Clinton office.  That way, if I get a yen for Thai while in Hoboken, I know I can get a quick fix.  Staff is not particularly attentive, but who cares; this place is about the food, not the ambience or service.  They have all the classic Thai dishes and they are all good (Pad Thai, Red Curry, Beef/ChickenShrimp with Basil).   This is not the place for a romantic dinner for two.  Tables are close together, and the place is small.  But it is great for what it is... i.e. inexpensive Thai.  BYOB helps for dinner, and there is liquor store on 2nd and Washington.
2009-07-16,5,4.5 starts - I am shocked to see all these lukewarm reviews... so I am not feeling too bad about the 5 starts...This is still BY FAR, the best Thai on the NJ side of the Hudson, we have been going there for years, and order in from them all the time. This is not watered down Thai, most of the dishes have a kick, and are not apologetic about it.The Pad-Thai is amazing, probably the best around, we also LOVE the Sri Thai triple delight, Curry with eggplant, chicken basil, and many more... Also worth mentioning are the very good soft shell crab dishes, however this is only if you are eating in (mushy soft shell crab is not appetizing, which is what you get when order this to home...)our biggest gripes with Sri Thai are:* They are closed on Teusdays* Portions are on the smallish side (and even more so when it comes to the rice portion)* At times it's hard to get them on the phone...
2009-07-12,3,It seems like Hoboken's Washington Street also suffers from the same "Cheap Asian Food Syndrome" that plagues Hell's Kitchen. Luckily, off of 3rd and Bloomfield, there's Sri Thai.Though not the trendiest little nook, I'd rate it the most solid, especially during lazy Sunday afternoons when you're not in the mood for a traditional brunch. It's a small joint with a tiny bathroom and close tables, but you're not here for decor - you want to take the edge off that    Saturday night/Sunday morning hangover with food, silly!I don't remember what we started with, but both appetizers were fried bits of yumminess served up with their appropriate dipping sauce and a milky-sweet thai iced tea. But our entrees really shined - his chicken/onion/peppers/veggie stir-fry dish was nicely done, while my shrimp/veggie/eggplant in green curry blew my mind. The combination of spicy-yet-cooling curry followed up by the peppery stir fry was a nice palate contrast...without being hard on the pocket.3.5 stars.
2009-06-19,4,I would do 3.5 stars..I like the food here but it certainly doesnt wow me. solid pad thai (which is practically all i ever get from a thai restaurant, im no expert)I think the appetizers were very good, I love the pork dumplings. There seemed to be a discrepancy in the quality the one time I ate in the restaurant vs the many times ive gotten delivery - things just seemed better/fresher which makes sense. I would recommend it overall though.
2009-04-24,3,There is no other "cheap" Thai restaurant around, so this is the best bet for "cheap" Thai food in this area.  I agree with Yelper Molly A.'s review of this place, and, similarly, I would add that you can taste the chicken, you can taste the sauce... but you can't taste them, 2-gether (I believe they're in competition with Chicken-flavored Ramen Noodles)The most enjoyable thing here is the dinner-ware they serve the meals in.  Other than that, your best bet is the Pad Thai, which is very difficult for any Thai restaurant to screw up.  The soups are average, yet nice to sip on.  The appetizers are decent.  If you don't know much about Thai food, don't bother asking the one waiter they have for help because she tends to distance herself from the customers.
2009-01-18,5,The best Thai restaurant I have ever experienced!  I recommend the pad thai and panang curry.  The decor is not very chic but do not judge a book by its cover!  You do not want to miss out on this place if you are a thai food lover like I am.
2008-12-31,3,Curry, basil, and pork dishes are always great, and the service is great as well.  Prices are more reasonable than some of the other thai places in town.  Delivery is painfully slow though.
2008-01-07,1,Totally disappointed!  The dinner didn't start off too badly with our order of spring rolls and soup, but it took about 45 minutes to get our main course and there must've only been about 15 people seated in the tiny space.  My pad thai left little to be desired and wasn't touched after my first helping!  The noodles were rubbery, the sauce tasted artificial and didn't evenly coat the noodles.  Poor service and poor food= bad restaurant!
2007-08-16,2,I have got to be honest with you, I am reviewing the restaurant from a kid friendly standpoint. The food is no doubt good but they seem to be very less tolerant of babies. We went there with our 18 months old who was a prefecty good child as she sat in the high chair the whole time and didn't run around(another parent will know what I am talking about :-). The server who was a guy with shoulder length hair made nasty comments about the child dropping food on the floor. We ignored it initially, I even tried picking up the mess after my child and were planning on giving them a good tip. Just when we were about to leave, the guy commented on what a disaster the child had made. I was extremely upset at the response. Our child was not screaming or running around the restaurant distrupting their business. Just simply dropping food on the floor as she didn't have great dexterity. I am definitely not going their again and I am truly hurt as a parent.Also, they need to know that they potray a family freindly atmosphere but don't live upto it.
2006-10-24,3,Ten years ago, this used to be my favorite Thai restaurant ever.  However, things have changed in the past 10 years.The food is still good, but you can find better in Hoboken.  And they've done absolutely nothing with the space in 10 years.  Everyone is crammed in like sardines with nothing to look at but your companions and the young couple on a first date at the next table.It's worth a try for take-out.  But if you want to eat in, try another Thai in town.
2005-12-18,4,Parking sucks since it's in downtown Hoboken. The food is pretty good. The you feel like a whale in a fish tank when you go in. I think they need to re-locate to a much bigger place.
2005-05-15,2,I'm basing my review on only one visit.  Sri Thai seems to have average quality Thai food.  I will go again to try more from their menu, but the dining area is quite cramped.
