2021-11-07,5,Solid delivery experience and good quality. I've ordered from here many times through the years and always had a positive experience. Tonight I needed my sush fix so I ordered a Spicy Salmon Avocado Roll and the Angry Dragon Roll- both with brown rice. It came fairly quickly and everything was delicious. I also find this a great spot to pick up if you have a car since they have a parking lot! I've also had their kani salad and dumplings - both are good! Would recommend!
2021-10-01,5,Ordered for the first time. Let me just say.... The best sushi in hoboken without a doubt!!!! So fresh... delivery was quick. I ordered through "ezordernow" and they came within 20 minutes! I haven't ordered sushi in awhile because I'm never sure whether or not it's fresh. I hate when there's that old sushi smell. Okinawa on the other hand... so unbelievably fresh and is our new go to! We ordered a garden salad with ginger dressing. Dressing was so good and they give you a lot. Spicy tuna was really good and we love the salmon or tuna with avocado. Let's just say... we recommend!!!
2021-09-16,4,Place has great food, service, and value. The space just needs to be updated for a better ambiance.
2021-09-11,5,Our favorite sushi in Hoboken.  We normally do take out but the indoor space is cozy too.  Highly recommend.
2021-09-06,4,Very solid takeout sushi! Sushi was very fresh and rice was soft and fresh. Flavors were great. Quick preparation. Would def recommend for great and tasty special rolls and well done classics! Shrimp shumai and goyza were also great!
2021-08-18,5,Hands down best sushi in Hoboken! In the past 6 years I've lived here I think I've ordered from Okinawa almost once a week. Always fresh and tasty, delivery is the quickest I have ever experienced, and great prices for what you get. Ive tried many basic and specialty rolls, salads and soups, fried rice and pad Thai- all are delicious. I've gotten all of my friends in the area hooked on Oki and would recommend to anyone!
2021-07-26,5,Best sushi place in hoboken for a good price. The spicy crab roll is particularly good. Highly recommend for stay in sushi night!
2021-07-19,4,3 maki lunch for $11.75I got California roll, eel avocado, and kani roll.Everything taste really good.
2021-07-10,5,Love! Love! Love!I always place an order for pick up and it's always ready on time. Food and quality is consistently amazing.. EVERY SINGLE TIME! Reasonably priced too. This is definitely my go to sushi spot in JC.
2021-05-28,5,I have been to Okinawa many times and finally realized ive never reviewed! I prefer Okinawa over some of the other sushi places in the area because the fish is consistently fresh, the food is prepared quickly, and the rolls are done very well. On this particular evening, I ordered the Spicy Scallop Roll, Salmon Roll and the eel roll. You can ask for the spicy scallop roll with or without avocado. All of the rolls were fresh and tasted delicious. I also like how there wasn't too much rice in each roll. Indoor dining is still unavailable here but if you call in an order for pickup it's usually ready in 10-15 minutes. Overall, Okinawa is a solid sushi spot with great service.
2021-04-05,5,Awesome sushi!  Nice people.  We thought the restaurant was opened, but since it wasn't we had to order and wait.  Even though they were busy with takeout and delivery orders, we only waited about 15 minutes.  If you are in the area, they have a large selection, it's reasonable priced and best of all they have a parking lot.
2021-03-20,5,Ordered pickup via their site which is via delivery.comLunch specials until 4pm!  Got the sashimi lunch special with soup and salmon sashimi lunch with salad. Huge chunks of sashimi and super fresh. Sashimi lunch came with your typical 3 fish:  ahi tuna, salmon, and white tuna.Highly recommended!!!
2021-03-06,5,Great sushi in Downtown Hoboken.  Haven't had a bad roll here yet - have tried multiple different ones and all have been delicious.  Service is great too.
2021-03-01,5,Okinawa Sushi & Grill you are truly incredible, I had a wonderful experience here today. Awesome menu. Okinawa Sushi & Grill is one of these places where all the menu items look magnificent, I had Spicy Tuna and it was wonderful. Staff are extremely nice and service is very fast. What an amazing find Okinawa Sushi & Grill is.
2021-02-19,5,I love their sashimi, rolls, and udon!:) It's hard to find good sushi in Hoboken but I can always count on Okinawa. I have never eaten inside but  delivery is quick and a reliable one!
2021-02-12,5,Been ordering from Okinawa for a few years now. Always fresh, some of the best sushi in Hoboken
2021-02-05,5,Love their sushi. So fresh and always good! Can't go wrong with their specialty rolls.
2021-01-21,1,The sushi here is just ok but definitely not any better than Robingi or Ayame and this place is overpriced. Wouldn't be that big of a deal except their customer service is horrible? You call and the girl on the phone is rude and short and gives you attitude. I walked from uptown to pick up an order cause it was nice out and they overpacked the bag so much. I asked for a second bag just in case and they gave me attitude, didn't give me one. Guess what... the bag ripped  and then I called letting them know. I was already half way back and didn't walk to go fight with them. I called for a refund was told I got store credit instead. I asked for an email or something in writing and the assured me "it would be on my account linked to my phone number". Wanted to give them a second chance tonight considering I had this "credit". I called and no credit. Again given attitude and sushi was just ok. Go to Robingi instead this place isn't worth your money.
2021-01-09,4,One of the better sushi spots in the downtown Hoboken area compared to some of the other ones I've been to. The prices are pretty good and the quality is definitely worth the price you pay. We recently got the sashimi platter and a few of the rolls and were very pleased with the food. If you're looking for some different apps to switch it up, the tuna tataki and yellowtail jalapeño apps are really good. The fish is very fresh and the sauce that comes with is the perfect compliment to it.
2020-12-20,3,Tried take-out from Okinawa this weekend. I couldn't process my order online since it said my address was out of the delivery range even though I'm right by the Malibu diner so I had to call instead. Delivery window was 60-90 minutes and took full 90 minutes to arrive. The fried cheese wontons were good and a big portion size - they'd probably taste better in person though since they weren't that crispy delivered. For rolls, I got a spicy tuna, spicy scallop and avocado and the Hoboken roll. The Hoboken roll was mostly crab and would've been better with the spicy sauce poured on top. The other rolls were standard. I'd give takeout from there another try and get a speciality roll.
2020-12-18,3,I've lived in JC for 4+ years. Ordered Okinawa usually about 2-3/month. Probably the best we've had for delivery in the area. This is not a review of the food. However, at some point, when ordering delivery through Seamless, my building is now out of the delivery zone. Per Google Maps, I live a 1.5 miles walk away, 1.6 miles if driving. Once that happened, I would call the restaurant and order directly through them. And delivery was fine. Never had an issue. Gave them my address, CC# over the phone, and food would come.But not any more. Apparently 1.5 miles away is too far for delivery. If you live south of 2nd Street in JC, don't bother wasting your time. It's shocking to me, when restaurants are struggling for business they turn it down.
2020-12-11,2,Typically this restaurant is pretty medium quality (we usually order 1x/month since it's next door to us), but recently the quality seems to have slid.  We ordered sushi and were served old/unappetizing fish, actually it was pretty gross.  Probably will not come back.
2020-11-28,5,In my opinion this is the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken. The fish is always extremely fresh and the rice is seasoned perfectly. I've been coming here almost once a week since I moved to Hoboken over 5 years ago. Its unassuming, as it's located in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you. Try them!
2020-11-02,5,This is my favorite sushi place in my neighborhood. It seems like it's also everyone else's too. If you order from here, make sure you pick it up yourself. I recently placed a order through Yelp, which I think is actually grubhub. My order was placed and confirmed very easily. After being told 60-80 min wait, at 90 mins, I called on my order and the place was closed for orders and the number was going to busy. They canceled my order but 2.5 hours later my food showed up. I was very shocked because I had already decided and eaten something else. I mean it was annoying but at least they delivered the food I guess, I just saved it for the next day to have for lunch. It's really sad that they don't have enough help I think during these covid times, business is hard for them. I'm not happy with this but the several times that I've gone to pick up, my orders were always there and the food was good. I definitely prefer this sushi place over others in the neighborhood. I think their sushi rolls taste better and are made better. They also give you a generous amount of seaweed salad per order. The price is pretty standard as well.
2020-10-26,5,His place has great fresh sushi every time I order from here I'm always satisfied and that's important
2020-10-23,4,My favorite sushi place in Hoboken. Nothing fancy, but that's what I'm looking for with sushi. Just good quality sashimi for a reasonable price. We almost always get the sushi for 2. Great value.
2020-10-06,5,There is not a large variety of sushi places to pick from in Hoboken, and this place does not disappoint. They have a lot of different rolls to choose from, they are also quick, and the sushi is pretty good quality, especially for a great price.
2020-09-29,1,I checked the menu and this place has nothing to do with Okinawan cuisine. They need to try a little harder with the name. There was a place downtown in NYC with the same name.
2020-09-21,4,Great sushi spot recommended by my roommate. The rolls and sashimi were fresh- we got an eel avocado roll, shrimp tempura roll, hoboken rolls and a sashimi deluxe. Overall, I would definitely order again!
2020-09-18,5,Absolutely my favorite sushi place! The food is fresh and delicious! Kani Salad, spicy Tuna Roll, Spicy Tuna, Salmon Don, Salmon Avocado Roll, Salmon Avocado, Gyoza, Chicken Teriyaki are must to order!
2020-09-11,4,I found that the sushi here was decent midrange made cost it's not crazy expensive I value but you get a quality sushi for what you spend. One of the better ones in the jersey area if you're craving it and don't want to spend an arm and a leg. They are quick and have made a lot of precautions with Covid to make sure that you are safe and you get your delicious food. Depending on what you likeThey have a large variety of options of rolls and sashimi
2020-09-09,5,This is my go to sushi place in all of NJ! Their roles are simple yet fantastic. The fish taste fresh and sushi is made quick. Most places just add avocado in all their sushi but these guys keep it original. Definitely recommend this place if you like sushi.
2020-08-31,5,LOVE this place. The sweet potato sushi rolls are elite. Customer service is also great.
2020-08-24,3,Ordered the spicy combo and selected spicy tuna, salmon, and crab with a miso soup. I also had to order a seaweed salad to meet the delivery minimum.  The soup, sushi, and salad could've been more flavorful. It all tasted a little on the bland side. However, the fish was fresh and delivery was prompt.
2020-08-23,1,I've been ordering from this place for years great sushi but recently they don't deliver to all of Jersey city heights anymore, they don't past central ave and I live 2 blocks away from central ave. Very disappointing and I've been a loyal customer for many years.
2020-08-08,2,Such a shame...used to love this place and support all the time. Food was always delicious, but now very overpriced. I called today to order a bento box lunch special (currently on their website) and the woman who answered the phone rudely said "oh we don't have that anymore". I said oh I'm sorry, maybe I looked at the wrong menu, is there another I can look at? She gave me a new website, I looked at the menu, and again, the bento box was on there! I called her back and said I still see it on here, so it looks like it is available and she again rudely said "nope we don't serve that anymore". I find it very hard to believe a Japanese restaurant doesn't serve chicken teriyaki anymore, but I assume they just decided they no longer want to give it for a lunch special price even though it is clearly still on their site.  I will no longer be ordering from Okinawa, who just wants to overcharge their customers when there are many other delicious Hoboken sushi places with fair prices and kind service.
2020-07-27,5,After not liking any sushi in Hoboken for 10 years, finally found a place in town. Fish was fresh and delivery prompt
2020-07-27,4,This spot was delicious and very COVID conscious. You can only get take out, but the cool thing about this spot is that it is completely contactless, which made it feel really safe. On tap of that, the sushi was delicious. I had the chicken tempura roll and I would definitely get it again.
2020-07-11,5,Got this sushi for the first timeLast night. Rolls are larger portions. It is my new favorite spot for sushi in Hoboken, a little more expensive by a couple dollars than other places in Hoboken.
2020-07-02,1,I had the spicy crab, tuna and salmon. I couldn't tell any of them apart. It was dry, lacked flavor and taste old. It wasn't warm but still falling apart and most places I have had it I could tell what I was eating. I don't think that is a strange request.I'm not sure what passes for good sushi in New Jersey but if you have eaten it in New York, Miami or Cali this place will disappoint you. This is my second time eating here. Once was early like lunch and the second dinner. The good news is it was delivered quickly but that might have been because it was not fresh.
2020-06-26,5,Best Sushi we've had in Hoboken so far! We have tried 6 places already. We got this tonight! It is fresh, fast delivery, and a lot of fish meat!
2020-06-21,5,Best sushi take out in all of Hoboken! They also have great delivery. Everything is always very fresh & they have a large menu.
2020-05-24,5,My go to sushi spot in Hoboken! Always love their sashimi platter - so tasty. they're also very quick for take out and delivery. And they've reopened for take out!
2020-04-16,5,My go-to for sushi delivery in Hoboken!! They're also BYOB, so it's worth dining in too. There's a parking lot out front, which makes it easy and convenient to drive to without having to deal with finding parking. There's also a liquor store in the same plaza (very convenient).
2020-03-08,4,Depending on the time of week and day, the rolls are rolled with too much rice at times. 90% of the time, I've had perfection, tho.
2020-03-06,4,One of my favorite sushi spots in Hoboken. Always so accommodating to dietary needs/restrictions. They offer gluten free soy sauce that comes prepackaged and is certified GF. They also offer rolls with no rice for those who prefer that. Always fresh, never too 'fishy'. BYOB and they always have the best music playing
2020-02-28,5,I always order here for their sushi rolls! I feel like their fish is fresh and their delivery is really fast during lunch time. The food got here within 30 mins! ( I do live a little close the restaurant though - like 10 mins). I also order their Pad Thai and I like it. It's a little sweeter then other pad Thai's but their sushi make up for it! Their salad dressing is really good!
2020-02-21,2,I was so looking forward to liking this place, we have friends that order sushi from here and have recommended this place to us in the past. We arrived around 8:30pm on Friday night, so not too crowded, got a table for two after a couple of minutes and proceeded to order right away. We wanted to try the pad Thai and a couple of sushi rolls, nothing special, we ordered the chicken pad Thai, the Hoboken roll and the rock shrimp roll. They definitely forgot about the sushi order. The pad Thai came out and the sushi took another 15-20 min to come out. Two simple rolls, not a crowded place, no apology, this really ruined the experience for us. The pad Thai was pretty bland, but is not a Thai place, however the rock shrimp sushi seemed like it wasn't cooked all the way. Not as crunchy as you would expect. Overall the food was not good either. Service and food thumbs down. 2 star review because parking was super easy for Hoboken
2020-02-14,5,A coworker recommended so had to try. They have an insanely quick delivery so if you are hungry this is the spot. We tried a few different items. The shinning roll and peanut avocado hand roll were legit.  They have the option of the hand roll and a regular roll which I honestly didn't know the difference.  The hand roll is not my thing.  It is hard to eat first off and the rolled sushi just makes it taste better.  We also ordered the sweetheart roll as well.This place is also affordably priced but most importantly uses fresh ingredients. Nothing wrong with the spot and I would definitely reorder. One of the best sushi spots in town.
2020-02-11,3,I came here on Saturday night. I was craving sushi and thought it would be good given the good reviews. When I initially walked in, I was pleasantly surprised. The restaurant is located in a strip mall but inside the ambiance is nice. We were seated immediately.The server asked us for our order 3 times within 5 minutes of sitting down, each time when we said we needed more time she rolled her eyes and scoffed looking really pissed. This immediately turned us off, but  we were hoping for at least a good meal.The sushi however, was disappointing. We ordered the Spicy yellowtail, spicy salmon, and alaska rolls ( not depicted, two veggie rolls (peanut avocado and sweet potato), as well as the yellow crunch dragon roll. The sushi was mushy and did not have a good balance of fish, rice and crunch. The crunch  in the yellow dragon crunch roll was also mushy. The veggie rolls were the best but even those were not quite done well.Overall, would not come here again.
2020-01-27,5,Been here a few times during lunch. The lunch special is a really good deal. The food comes out very fast and always fresh. The servers are very pleasant and welcoming. The restaurant is also BYOB which is great! I've never been disappointed here and will definitely keep coming back. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for great sushi, great service, and a clean restaurant
2020-01-24,5,Their oki roll is my favorite. This is my go to place. I get this food for my birthday! Favorite combo is the general tsos chicken and sushi, It's a really fulfilling combination.
2020-01-05,4,Okinawa is hands down the best sushi place in Hoboken.  They have a variety of regular rolls  ($5-$7) that range from 6-8 pieces. Our go to  rolls are -  spicy tuna  avocado - shrimp tempura -    Yellow tail and scallion -  sweet potatoe (recommend with brown rice) - asparagus roll Their speciality rolls are expensive and range from  $11-$17. I've enduldged in  some of these rolls and have enjoyed them (Hoboken , dragon and summer) but if you were craving  unique sushi  I would suggest the sushi pizza. Sushi pizza is Tuna, jalapeno, scallions, spicy mayo , eel sauce on top of a wonton cracker.  It is hands down delicious. Other appetizers we recommend are rock shrimp, beef nigikami , eggplant and the Pineapple fried rice.The lunch special is the best bang for your buck- $15 for 3 rolls and a choice of miso soup or salad
2019-12-20,5,Honestly, ordered delivery hoping that sushi was decent. But everything I ordered was VERY TASTY! Food very fresh and everything I asked for. Will be ordering my sushi from here from now on!
2019-12-19,4,Sushi is good. Some pieces of rolls fall apart when separated from adjacent pieces. Fish and vegetables taste fresh even with delivery orders. Miso soup is plentiful and perfect flavor. Gyoza is full and tasty. Ginger tastes a bit artificial. Otherwise best delivery sushi in the area and have ordered several times!
2019-12-13,3,Just ordered from here with seamless. The spicy salmon hand roll was pretty good! I like that the seaweed wasn't overly stretchy. The chicken fried rice was wack though. It's very bland especially the chicken--it tastes like if you were to boil the chicken and not season it and then they just threw it in and definitely not worth $12.
2019-11-27,4,The sushi sandwich is amazing!  And the crazy tuna roll is really good. They offer lots of choices in special rolls.
2019-11-19,4,Standard but good and fresh.  Good staple sushi and good serving sizes.  Another one of those go to restaurants when we are lazy and need a place that is local and quick.  Their delivery is like out of this world quick.
2019-11-05,4,Finding decent sushi in this town is like finding a needle in a haystack. When it comes to sushi, Okinawa is by far the best and has been my go-to spot for dining in or ordering taking out. I've only tried the sushi here, but they do offer other Japanese, Thai and Chinese entrees. The specialty rolls are fairly large and their basic rolls are fresh and tasty.If dining in, the restaurant is BYOB! However, you may have to wait a bit if you come later on Friday or the weekends.Delivery has always been fast and they've always gotten my orders right.Highly recommend!
2019-11-04,1,Very petty ownership, inconsistent portioning and food quality.  I have found Robongi to be more reasonably priced and more consistently fresh,  with far superior customer service and less nickle-and-dime'ing.  Owners made a whole production out of my complaint RE: portioning sizes (see photos) for one single order, despite me ordering takeout from them pretty regularly (as well as their competitors, since I'm a pretty big sushi-head).  They made it clear they didn't want my business anymore, which I was not upset about.  Very poor decision-making by a lousy ownership team.  I have since found other good options in JC and Hoboken and continue spending $50+ per week on sushi at their competitors.
2019-11-01,5,While visiting, I was suggested this place from a friend who orders their sushi for delivery often.  Delivery sushi through GrubHub/Yelp was fast and delicious. I ordered the Rainbow Roll and House Roll, both very good! I personally enjoyed the House roll a tiny bit more! The honey wasabi sauce was delicious! Would definitely order from here again! It arrived in 23 minutes too! So quick!
2019-10-13,5,Just discovered this sushi spot and we were very pleased with the quality! Finally a great sushi spot in Hoboken! We had the yellowtail jalapeño sashimi, spicy tuna roll and the Trio Spicy Roll. We are definitely coming back soon to try other items on the menu. Also, it's BYO, but next to a wine / liquor store!
2019-10-04,5,Yum! I was impressed with this place, I'm surprised I hadn't tried it sooner. We got a table for three last night around 7pm without a wait, which is great because I was concerned there might be a wait since they don't take reservations. Our waitress was attentive and our rolls came out very quickly.  I ordered the Oki Roll and it was super filling (I loved the special sauce) and a spicy salmon roll. Honestly, it was hard to choose what I wanted because all of their Special Rolls sounded amazing. Looking forward to coming back soon to try some of the other rolls! One note - it's BYOB. I didn't realize this til we were on our way, but thankfully there's a liquor store nearby.
2019-09-22,4,A new sushi restaurant in the south end of town, it's good to see this as an option for the residents, there's seating inside and if it's too packed you can sit at the bar area.  They have a great selection of Asian entrees, would recommend trying their special rolls. There is parking available and if you're driving you can try to find it on observer highway and cut through the car wash. They do accept cash or credit, service is fast and the staff is very friendly, definitely would go back to try more of their menu. Don't forget to rub the Buddha's belly when you leave for good luck!
2019-09-19,4,This place is probably the most affordable sushi you will get in Hoboken! All rolls are very tasty and there's parking so getting there is very convenient. Its BYO as well!
2019-09-08,4,The atmosphere is great. Really cozy and modern. The food is great and prices weren't bad at all. I went with 2 other people. I got the Philadelphia roll which were 6 moderate sizes pieces. It was very creamy and tasty. One friend got chicken fried rice and said it was tasty but nothing special. The other friend got a bento box which was around $24 and it was really worth it. It's huge and delicious. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because our waitress didn't seem very welcoming or nice. She was very quiet and seemed annoyed. She muttered a lot and we had to ask her to repeat herself, she didn't seem happy.
2019-09-07,2,Food was excellence. Horrible waiter. We spent $140 and she would barely talk to us. We told her it was our 1st time there. She walked away. I tried to inquire about food and she would just say "get xyz".  I told her I dont like xyz and no suggestion.  THE FINAL STRAW WAS MY FRIEND DECIDED TO GIVE HER A $14 tip and we wanted to give her nothing. Then she WALKED OVER AND PUT THE RECEIPT IN FRONT OF HER AND CONFEONTED HER "Did you give a 10% tip?" She said "yes" and we were mortified.  Sushi was good. Steak was not. BEWARE!
2019-09-06,5,Fresh, very Marie Kondo with their presentation, delicious food!  Fast and accurate delivery.
2019-08-03,3,Horrible service. Okay food. Staff uneducated on menu ingredients. Definitely 3 stars NOT 4.
2019-07-25,4,I ordered delivery for lunch as many other places were closed . Pleasantly surprised as the food came fast and fresh !  I had 2 hand rolls , a sandwich roll and another which I cannot recall ( but It is pictured ). Very good sushi and the portions are large compared to the typical Hoboken sushi joints . Will definitely order again!
2019-07-22,3,I was looking for a sushi spot in Hoboken and this was the first place that popped up. My experience here was very mediocre. First off, it was about 95 degrees outside and the place had poorly working air conditioners. I ordered rock shrimp ($10.50) and the plate was smothered in spicy mayo and eel sauce. Most of the plate was soggy lettuce and the other part was tiny battered fried shrimp. For my entree, I ordered the sushi deluxe which came with 9 pieces of sushi, 1 spicy tuna, and an option of miso soup or salad ($25). The miso soup tasted pretty good and the spicy tuna roll was just okay. However, I wasn't impressed by the sushi. They gave me the usual basic salmon, tuna, yellowtail in my sushi pieces. It didn't taste terrible but it wasn't that great. The quality of the fish wasn't too fresh. I also don't understand the reason as to why there was a literal handful of ginger placed next to the sushi...The service was just okay, hostess wasn't very welcoming and I felt rushed to leave by the waitress. The only plus is a free parking lot. However, I don't think I would return.
2019-06-27,4,I ordered delivery from Okinawa for the first time last night. I've been searching for decent sushi in Hoboken and have been disappointed by everywhere I've tried, but I'll definitely be ordering from Okinawa again!I kept it simple with a salmon avocado roll and a spicy tuna roll, adding on an order of the rock shrimp appetizer. Everything was really good. The rice wasn't too cold and hard like a lot of low quality sushi places (people forget that the rice is as important, if not more, than the fish!) Prices were really reasonable for decent, simple sushi, and delivery came right when they said it would. Looking forward to trying more off the menu!
2019-06-16,5,After trying tons of sushi spots around hoboken, Okinawa is my exclusive go-to now. The delivery is exceptionally fast on a consistent basis. The sushi is top notch and they never mess up my order down to the chop sticks and spicy mayo. The best!
2019-06-09,4,Food was pretty average but I would definitely go here again! The service was quick and our waitress was super nice. I had the fried cheese wontons, shrimp tempura, and the fried rice (my go-tos at any Thai/ sushi place). A bit pricy compared to some other places but no other complaints!
2019-06-07,4,Food was delicious, prices were good for lunch special. You get a lot with the soup, salad and rolls. Service was very fast. Staff was friendly. Would recommend and would go back again.
2019-06-03,5,Service was great and the food was great I recommend the shrimp and chicken Thai pad!!!!
2019-05-30,4,Great sushi! Great service and fresh food! Could be a little more generous with the wasabi.
2019-05-27,1,Takeout order was supposed to be ready at 7:55, food came out at 8:40pm without even an apology. Crappy service + average sushi is not worth my business.
2019-05-26,3,After reading the many positive reviews that are shown online, I had high expectations. And don't get me wrong, my standards are high. I ordered with ease online through Yelp which was easy. Called the restaurant immediately after to confirm they've received my order and they did. I arrived to pick up the order, the hostess was very cutthroat and impatient with me, work on people skills please. I picked up the lunch which was neatly packed. I ordered the sushi lunch and maki two rolls lunch which consisted of the spicy tuna and eel w/ avocado roll. The spicy tuna is heavily mixed with mayo, very little flavor development or spice. Felt like eating giant pieces of shredded tuna with mayo. The eel avocado was mainly avocado with very little pieces of eel. This made the roll cold as the roll is supposed to be fairly warm or room temperature at least when the eel is broiled. Overall the stars are for the ease of ordering and the quality packaging. Willing to give it another try soon.
2019-05-19,4,Good sushi convenient but needs more expansive menu.  Quality is awesome with the right chefs working but average w the wrong ones.  Convenient and good addition to SW Hoboken
2019-05-05,5,Amazing taste!Too good to say especially the shrimp tempera and spicy tuna avocado ones
2019-05-05,4,The food here is good. Service is prompt even when busy. It's trustworthy for freshness. I had a good experience. For quick sushi that you can trust, this is a good spot.
2019-05-02,5,I lived in Hoboken for 2 years after college. Okinawa was literally the only place I would EVER get sushi. They are by far the best in Hoboken. I always mixed up what I got. The rock shrimp are the best app. I get take out, and I've gone on dates there. It's an awesome spot. HIGHLYYYYY RECOMEND
2019-04-25,3,It's mediocre but better than store bought sushi. Options for sushi are lackluster in Hoboken. This spot remains in the top three.
2019-04-23,5,The best sushi in Hoboken. I have tried so many restaurants and nothing is as fresh as Okinawa!
2019-04-22,4,Have been meaning to try this place for a while but I have to say it didn't quite live up to the hype. While my rolls were pretty tasty and there was nothing wrong with them, the quality felt pretty similar to places that cost a bit less around here. Next time I might try a special roll to see if that where the hype is at! I did upgrade my avocado roll to have soy paper to hit the delivery minimum and it was a good choice, very yum!
2019-04-16,5,On a Friday afternoon I was browsing through Hoboken restaurants on Yelp in search of delivery for an early dinner. I was with a friend who isn't a fan of Japanese or Thai food but I convinced her that this restaurant has good reviews and that we should test it out. We ordered the Pad Thai and Philly Roll. My friend LOVED the food was looking forward to having it again in the future. Note that she had never tried sushi or pad thai before this meal! This place has fantastic food and I cannot wait to actually sit in the restaurant and try more of their dishes. I'm psyched that Hoboken has added another great sushi restaurant!
2019-04-16,4,This is a great sushi spot for takeout.  The delivery is always quick and accurate.  They have a ton of specialty rolls to choose from.  My only issue with this place is the Pad Thai.  I've ordered it a few times and each time I'm unable to finish the dish.  There is just something off about it. If you're ordering from here, stick to the sushi!
2019-04-10,5,Ordered take out Sushi for the first time...we were a little bit nervous about take out sushi BUT...this sushi was amazing...it was super bright and super fresh. The amount of fresh fish in each roll was probably more than we recall at any other place. The pieces were HUGE! The Pink Lady roll was off the charts...so was the Pacific Roll. We started with a seaweed salad and if you are a fan of this, you must try it here. 100% recommended.
2019-03-31,5,Ordered takeout from here for the first time last night after hearing positive reviews from a few friends. We ordered on Seamless as the delivery is free and received our food a half hour before the estimated delivery time, which was great as we were hungry!The rolls were incredibly fresh and tasty, and they gave us a generous portion of wasabi and soy sauce on the side. I also had the Chicken Tom Kai soup which was delicious, although I'm not sure why they have it labeled as "hot and spicy" on the menu since I didn't find it to be spicy. This sushi is a bit pricy if you're used to places that offer half off sushi every day. Our takeout with four regular rolls (not the specialty ones) and two soups came out to $46 including the tip. However, the quality of the sushi and quick delivery service makes it worth it. I definitely recommend ordering from here.
2019-02-23,5,I order takeout here occasionally and enjoy the food, but figured to try it out for date night. When my boyfriend and I got there, the place was packed. We lucked out and got seated right away.Pros:- The place is BYOB- There is a free parking lot- The portions are GENEROUS (peep the sashimi pic *drool*)- Sushi tastes and looks freshCons:- Place was packed, so you may have to wait around
2019-02-14,1,This place is absolutely terrible. Do not go here and tell your friends and family the same. Service and food quality deserve less then 1 star. Give them a year before they close based on the garbage they serve.
2019-02-09,5,The best Japanese/Thai food in Hoboken!! I have never ordered anything here that wasn't amazing. Prices are reasonable and food comes out so quickly. Their chicken udon yaki noodles are to die for and it is such a huge portion. Pad Thai is also really great. All the apps I have had are delicious too. Okinawa will always be my go to spot.
2019-02-08,5,Best sushi in Hoboken hands down. Best delivery. Great date night spot, without frills. Classic go to for us and we are swingers!
2019-02-08,1,worst experience ever!! i put my order in wait 40 mins and take my payment to tell me they dont deliver to my address. manger told they will throw food away and doesnt offer any solutions...never order from here very dis honest...
2019-01-28,5,Excellent sushi! Everyone is always very friendly and they save your phone number to make deliveries even easier! Everything is always super fresh and delicious! Highly, highly recommended!
2019-01-27,5,BEST sushi in Hoboken! It took me some time to find a restaurant with great quality fish and I'm glad I finally came across Okinawa! Delivery is always super efficient. Highly recommend...
2019-01-26,5,This is the best sushi in Hoboken and has become my go-to for sushi.  It's a little more expensive than some other sushi places in Hoboken, but always high quality and worth it.  I live nearby, so I usually get takeout so my review is about the food and the people who I speak with on the phone and who greet me when I come to pick up my food.
2019-01-18,5,Basically like the Nobu of Hoboken! For the price, best sushi on the east coast.
2019-01-18,5,Best sushi in Hoboken! I have tried about 6 other sushi restaurants and there is no comparison. The Sweet Heart Roll is the one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had. I have ordered from this place about 30 times and will continue to do so.
2019-01-12,5,This place has some amazing sushi and rolls even the Pad Thai is amazing! The owner is super friendly every time we go there and I would recommend this place to all my friends because its the best sushi ive had in hoboken!
2019-01-03,4,Okinawa has been my staple sushi spot since moving into Hoboken in 2017. It's a rare find when you get the same quality of sushi whether you go to the restaurant and sit down or do take-out/delivery. I, being a creature of habit, always get the gyoza and sweetheart roll. But when I do venture from the norm and try new dishes they are all fantastic. The sole reason I docked a star is the service when I go there and sit down isn't always the best and I wish they would add some new creations to the menu. All in all, this is a great date night spot or if you're looking for a sushi delivery.
2018-12-31,5,Ordered via yelp app. The order came early, on New Year's Eve, was delivered by a friendly driver who followed the specific directions I left in the order notes, and the food was delicious. We're visiting from out of state and unfamiliar with the area so we relied heavily on yelp reviews/search, and we were not disappointed! We ordered all sushi rolls, all raw, and they really were scrumptious and fresh!
2018-12-30,1,Soo...not good. Both rolls I got were a solid "meh" at best. Pretty underwhelming.We had the general tso chicken (I know, we shouldn't have ordered chinese food at a Japanese restaurant, but he doesn't eat sushi) had a really bizarre chemically taste. He couldnt finish it. Another friend got the chicken yaki udon and it had absolutely no flavor. He couldn't finish his food either and he is NOT a picky eater. That'll be our last time there.
2018-12-30,5,I've tried several sushi spots in Hoboken but this place is by far the most consistent (always good) and deliver pretty fast.
2018-12-28,3,Ate here the other night, sushi was flavorful, on the expensive side for sure though. Ate Kani salad and beef negimaki, the beef negimaki was watered, as if frozen, and I wish the Kani salad was a little more flavorful. The rockstar was the white meat general tsaos. Absolutely spot on with flavor. Will I be back, yes, not my go to though.
2018-12-19,5,Solid sushi! Got the Spicy Scallop avocado roll, the salmon roll and then the lobster roll. It's one of the cooked sushi rolls. Really good sushi & enjoyed it! Quick service. I just didn't realize it's such a small place but a plus is that there's parking!
2018-12-14,4,Best sushi is Hoboken! We stopped in on a Friday night and Okinawa was packed out with a 20-30 min wait time... guess this place is a not so hidden, hidden gem! Luckily we were able to grab two seats at the sushi bar and enjoy a delicious meal. We ordered the tuna pizza, which is a must try - I've had many mediocre variations of tuna pizza but this version was up there... crust is done well. Also started with an order of pan fried dumplings, kani salad, BBQ squid and miso soups, all tasty and recommended! For sushi, we ordered nigiri a la carte followed by several maki, my favorite of which was the Golden Coast due to the sweetness of the mango in combination with the fresh, raw fish. If you're in the area, definitely check this spot out for a low key, high quality Japanese meal.
2018-12-12,4,The only good place in Hoboken for sushi. We have tried every place there is and this is the place we'd come back to time and again! We love the special rolls and would order 2-3 each time along with an appetizer. Haven't been disappointed yet. I did try their chirashi when I first dined here and it was just ok. So I would just stick to the special rolls here. Byob also sweetens the deal! This place is usually packed for a reason! Definitely check this out..
2018-12-10,5,I've tried them all, except this spot (not sure why) but tonight changed everything, Okinawa is hands down the best spot for sushi in Hoboken. Everything that my friend and I ordered was great! Definitely my new go-to for sushi. Can't wait to order again! Highly recommend!!!
2018-12-02,4,I am guilty of having my go-to sushi spot in town. I shamed myself in finding out this place has been in Hoboken for about 4 years! Came in on a Saturday night, no reservation and was seated right away. It's BYO and a liquor store is in the same complex so that's convenient. The place was bustling with delivery orders and at least 3 guys were constantly coming in to get more bags. I walked here but yes there is parking! I got a daily special roll which was amazing, the miso soup was on point, and a spicy scallop roll and walked out super full and satisfied. Would definitely recommend!
2018-11-30,5,BYOB, great sushi, good service. I have had this delivered more times than I can count at this point and it hold well but nothing beats having it in house. Tonight we had the sweetheart roll and Kamakazee. Will be back :) TRY THE WASABI CRACKER WITH SPICY TUNA APP!!!
2018-11-21,5,I had a major craving for sushi and decided to try a new spot.  I searched on yelp and after reading the positive reviews decided to try Okinawa.  I ordered the spicy tuna roll, the lobster tempura roll, and the signature Hoboken roll.  The whole thing was delicious.No container for the soy sauce.  You have to pour it into a tray.But food is delicious.
2018-11-19,1,These people nearly killed my best friend by putting plastic in her sushi rolls! I need my best friend alive, pigs. Plus she just got a new job. It can't end like this! Then these grime bags only reimburse her for ONE roll & she ordered 3. Classless & disgusting! Do not eat here unless you enjoy eating inanimate objects that are harmful to the human body. Bye.
2018-11-17,5,Delivery is quick, food is delicious. I order from here about twice a week! The rolls are fresh and are probably the freshest in Hoboken.
2018-11-14,1,Currently posting as I fight back the severe nausea I have from this TERRIBLE delivery that I bit into twice before giving up out of fear of becoming super sick.Rice was mush, contents of my rolls were BAD BAD BAD. I am SO upset I spent the money I spent for this and now have to spend more on another take out order from a different restaurant. Never again.
2018-11-03,2,I ordered sushi for delivery from Yelp. I found it annoying that their photo description of the food was quite misleading. For example, this photo yelp.com/order/v2/cart/b... seems to suggest you can get a good deal for $7. But in fact, you only get 6 small pieces and their flavor is just okay.I will not order delivery from this place again.
2018-10-29,4,Edamame, seaweed salad, miso soup, nabeyaki udon *pause for deep breath* eel avocado roll, chicken teriyaki, tuna roll, veggie spring roll, dragon roll *undo top pants button* spicy salmon roll, pork dumplings *ask for doggie bag* yellow tail roll *AND SCENE*. Between 4 people, we all ate family style and that was more than enough. The stand out stars for me were the eel avocado roll (my personal favorite) and the dumplings. The eel was still warm and paired with fresh avocado, YUM. The dumplings were delish, cooked perfectly so the skin was just a little crispy but only barely. My parents weren't fans of the nabeyaki udon, they said the broth was watery, but I actually really liked it so I guess that one goes person to person. The staff is friendly and place was buzzing on a Monday night. The restaurant has an interesting vibe. Beige and plain in nearly all of the decor except for the neon lights running throughout it. It almost has, HERE ME OUT, Cocktail vibes. You know that movie from the 80s with Tom Cruise? Anyway, if you are jonesing for some sushi, this is your place. Get delivery, call in and pick up, or get a table and eat here. You can't go wrong, Cocktail vibes and all.
2018-10-21,3,We ordered the sushi for two. This comes with 12 pieces of sushi, a rainbow roll, and an eel avocado roll. We also ordered a yellow tail scallion maki. My thoughts below:Rainbow roll: was okay. Not the best. There was a ton of rice and the avocado was sort of mushy. Eel avocado roll: way too much rice and way too much avocado. You could barely see any eel. And a little too much sauce. Yellow tail scallion roll: again too much rice. And the roll wouldn't stay closed. Nigiri pieces: they all had a really vibrant coloring that didn't appear natural. However the salmon was good. The tuna was good - typically don't like tuna nigiri. The red snapper was good. The white fish was chewy. I had to spit it out Miso soup: five starsOverall the sushi is just okay. Nothing special. And imo the rolls are overpriced for the taste and amount you get. I would rather spend my money at Komegashi 2 which has never disappointed me. Additionally, the delivery man asked me for more money!!!Please note: I'm a sushi snob.  if you aren't then this might be the place for you. It tastes like I picked it up from the Whole Foods pre-packaged sushi counter.This place isn't horrible. Just not my favorite.
2018-10-18,5,Best sushi in Hoboken :) and an extra plus it's BYO! Favorite rolls - Golden Coast and Fairy Tale.
2018-09-08,5,The food here is delicious and fresh. The staff is wonderful and very accommodating. I've ordered here many times. One time my order was not what I had wanted and they switched out the sushi roll for free. I would recommend getting the Shogun Roll, or if you aren't a fish fan their noodles are yummy too!
2018-09-01,4,Ordered for delivery--the fried cheese wonton and the Pacific roll were great! The shrimp & veg tempura was bland, wasn't a fan of it (but the pieces were large & fresh). I've ordered from here before and it's been mostly good. Also the delivery got here quicker than expected (and delivery is free, unlike too many places in NJ).
2018-09-01,5,Initially I wasn't sure about sushi from a strip mall, but so thankful we found this gem. Okinawa has the absolute best quality sushi in Hoboken, and the staff is super friendly. I really can't say I've ever ordered anything here that I didn't love! This place has snowballed in popularity since it opened for good reason, and everything is made to order, so plan ahead if you're doing delivery.
2018-08-06,5,I love this place!!! My boyfriend and I order sushi from here every Monday! It's by far our favorite sushi restaurant. The delivery is always quick and fresh! They have the best cheese wontons EVER!!!
2018-07-10,5,My go to in Hoboken! We are here almost every week and every time we get great sushi. I haven't had anything less than great when we've been! It's byob which makes this place that much better. Definitely get the rock shrimp app
2018-07-07,1,I used to like this place, especially the sushi.On my last visit I tried the Pad Thai and it was way too sweet, as if it was over loaded with sugar. It was not good at all.
2018-07-06,4,LOVE that it's BYOB! Sushi was fresh and great, and their miso soup was really great too! We did also order the pad Thai, and I'd say we've had better, but nonetheless wasn't bad. We will definitely return for the sushi though!
2018-07-06,5,I love this place! Best sushi in Hoboken with plenty of vegetarian options, something on the menu for everyone. Great portion sizes and fresh quality. The staff is treat very friendly and efficient. Restaurant is clean, simple, and modern.
2018-07-03,5,Only ordered from them twice but so far I am very happy!  I used to eat sushi every Friday night, I would have sushi and wine and order from Robongi which was really good for years.  I dont know what happened but they went downhill hard and fast and it made me lose the taste for sushi and I stopped ordering it for over a year!  But recently I have been in the mood for it again so I yelped it and Okinawa came up with great reviews and I have to say I hope they keep up their game because so far the sushi is super fresh and the delivery has not only been on time but early!  I have to give this place 5 stars and fingers crossed it stays that way so I can start my Friday sushi nights again.
2018-06-29,1,Picked up my order, got home and noticed that they forgot to give me one huge roll I ordered. I called them up and their response was "yeah it's here, would you like it delivered or are you going to pick it up?" Rather than wait an hour for delivery, I opted to take the 20 min trek. Upon pickup all I got was a "here ya go". How about being a little apologetic... a "sorry" perhaps? I don't like unapologetic people with a lack of customer service skills. The sushi was yummy though!
2018-06-24,4,Very cute neighborhood joint serving up your favorite sushi and other Japanese fare. I got the chicken yaki udon, which came on a huge plate and was very flavorful. My brother got "The Sandwich" rolls, which he described as amazing. I do not eat sushi, but from seeing the sushi that the other members of my party ordered, I thought they were presented beautifully and rolled meticulously. We had a baby with us, and the staff was very accommodating!
2018-06-16,3,The shumai has pork in it and the description did not include as an ingredient. Food overall was ok, easy use with grubhub.
2018-05-31,3,It was just ok.. Average sushi. I came here for lunch with a friend and we ordered a lunch combo with 3 rolls, a tuna sushi pizza and I ordered just one piece of eel sushi. The rolls on the combo weren't that great, too basic. Maybe I should have known better and ordered special rolls. The tuna pizza was pretty good, my favourite part was that the base was a scallion pancake! However it was smothered in eel sauce and spicy mayo, which I love both sauces but it was a bit too much on this pizza, regardless i would probably order again. The eel was good and decent sized. Service was ok except for when I left I said thank you twice and 2 of the girls were talking to each other and couldn't be bothered. Found that to be a little rude. But overall, an ok experience and affordable lunch. sushi combo with soup and salad w/ 3 rolls $15.751 piece eel sushi $3.5tuna pizza $13
2018-05-22,5,I really like this place great sushi and great service. It's BYOB which I also like. We had the bento boxes which had a taste of everything in there. They gave the option of soup or salad to go with it. We also got deserts with were pretty good, we had the mango mochi ice cream, And the cheesecake tempura. So good. Delicious. Really good spot.
2018-05-17,4,Not bad but over priced. It's not that nice inside - looks like a strip mall sushi place (which is exactly what it is). I thought the sushi was good tho.
2018-05-04,5,I have gone in person for dinner and ordered takeout numerous times. The quality is consistent and well priced.  My fave sushi place in Hoboken !  Hoboken Roll = #1
2018-04-12,5,Best sushi in Hoboken. Great for delivery and a night out. They also offer byob! The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Love it here :)
2018-04-09,5,This has become our go-to Sushi restaurant.  Whether we are eating in or taking out, the food as always been fresh and delicious.  You really cannot go wrong here!  All of their rolls are spectacular, service is great.
2018-04-09,4,Ohh boyyyy!!!  Love it!  It's fresh and they have so much art to choose from.  For now I just ordered Paradise kiss roll, Yellow Dragon (I think) and soft shell crab.  It was all good and service was fast.  I think I will come here more often because I want to try more sushi.  All selections look great!
2018-04-08,5,I admittedly have only ordered delivery from Okinawa but I do religiously. The sushi is always fresh, and I haven't been disappointed yet.
2018-04-03,4,Revised review: Service is prompt and sushi is consistent. Revised review to reflect that this is take-out and not fine sushi isuda. :) it's good option for a takeout date night and not stress that the food will come after Netflix and chillin
2018-03-26,5,The sushi is always fresh! Reasonable prices for good quality sushi and serving size. The staff is always welcoming. You can't go wrong!
2018-03-24,5,Sushi is amazing here. Fresh and staff is friendly. We came here on a Friday night with a stroller, staff was able to accommodate us with moving tables around and there was no wait. Food came out fast and tasted great. It's also BYOB.
2018-03-11,1,The sushi is stale and I found a plastic chip in my sushi. First time it happened I called the restaurant to let them know and they had the manager call me back and apologize but it happened again!! This is unacceptable.
2018-03-09,5,This place is very consistent. They almost always deliver on time if not early and it's pretty good. If you're looking for a casual place to get take out or go in and sit byob it's one of the better ones in the area
2018-03-03,1,Two of us went to dinner at Okinawa on a Friday night and were not happy with our experience. We were able to sit right away and had our appetizer order taken quickly and before we received them we put in our entree order. After finishing our appetizers we waited a while for our entrees not thinking about the wait. After about 30 minutes another waitress came over asking for our order and we told her that we already placed our order. We were a little concerned at that point but felt confident our order was put in. After about 45 minutes they gave us some free dumplings for having to wait. After 1 hour we asked for the check and left. We were extremely upset as we've been here plenty of times with great service but to not even receive an apology this time, we may not return.
2018-02-15,4,so good! love the tuna pizza and lunch specials. better than any other sushi place around :)
2018-02-12,5,Fantastic sushi and really great value compared to other places in Hoboken. Delivery is always fast and they have never gotten an order wrong.
2018-02-09,5,Best sushi in Hoboken. Hands down. Always fresh. Quick delivery. Great large menu to choose from!
2018-01-21,1,We ordered through seamless on 1/21/18. I ordered vegetable pad thai, but I was given chicken pad thai. My garden salad was just lettuce. I am a vegetarian, so I called to ask them to send out a vegetable pad thai. An hour later, it still had not come, so I called back. They told me that I had asked for a refund, even though I clearly asked for them to send out the vegetable pad thai. They were rude. I suppose it is just as well, because my boyfriend has been sick to his stomach after eating his chicken curry. Never ordering from here again.
2018-01-21,4,This is a a nice place in Hoboken. Its not on the main strip , so easy to miss it. But it has its own advantage - You get free parking space !!The place is not very big with decent ambiance. We had ordered sushi . The california rolls were good. We also got udon. That was great as well.They also served complimentary salad (not bad).The service is good and quick. Overall a good food experience.
2018-01-20,5,I came in today and ordered the house special roll which was delicious. The service here is great and I love that there is parking and BYOB. I came with a friend, we ordered the pork dumping (it was aight) and spring rolls (I loved them but my friend thought more filling was a must) and he ordered the three roll lunch special. I have nothing bad to say about this place. I'm coming back and trying more. Also, this isn't a fancy spot, this is causal dining and the ingredients aren't super super fancy but, it isn't horrible quality either. It's chill and affordable with a nice setting. It's great when you're on a budget.
2018-01-17,3,tried this spot over MLK weekend. very convenient for cold weather. it has a parking lot, and is in a shopping center with a wine store... so very easy to get there and grab something for this BYO spot. due to its location, we didn't have to wait for a table, which was great! the menu is pretty expansive with a mix of sushi, japanese and some thai cuisine. we came for sushi, but the udon coming out also looked delicious.  we started with the rock shrimp app and a bowl of tom yum soup. both were tasty, tom yum broth was nicely developed with a good kick. for sushi we tried two specialty rolls and two basic rolls. definitely try the pacific roll. its tuna, lobster salad, shrimp, avocado, tobiko and wasabi mayo. lots of fish in the rolls, we filled up quickly. service here was also excellent. lots of people working to ensure you were taken care of. overall food and experience was a 4, but knocked a start after both me and  the husband felt ill later in the evening and then not the greatest the next day after.willing to give the spot one more try!
2018-01-14,4,Solid sushi spot! We like to get the lunch special here, which is pretty affordable and comes with salad and miso soup. The rolls are well made, with a good amount of filling and not too much rice. It's nice that they have a parking lot, though it can get filled during busy hours. We've had a good experience getting delivery as well.
2018-01-05,1,I ordered food at 8:15pm. At 10:10pm I call the restaurant and I ask for a refund as they say they don't know where the food is and it's been 2 hours. It finally arrives at 10:20pm and the driver hands me the food . as he's walking away I politely tell him I called and asked for a refund since it took over 2 hours and he comes back and says he has to take the food! The foods going to waste clearly, the smart thing to do is write this off as a cost to potentially keep a customer. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN! I ordered from here twice before and both times took over an hour and I live in their neighborhood!!
2018-01-04,5,I'm almost tempted to not review this place but I absolutely love the sushi here. It's amazing, the quality of sushi, taste, types of rolls and attention to instructions beyond beats every other Hoboken sushi spot. The sashimi is awesome, and the prices are fair considering the quality. My only complaint is they don't give enough ginger and they removed the option toPurchase extra ginger. It's definitely a little annoying because I spend 100 plus dollars there usually and I would appreciate the option of ordering more ginger.
2018-01-03,4,Very good food. Customer service could be better. They treat non white differently and it shows. Not fair but food is very good.
2018-01-01,4,This was my first time eating Okinawa's sushi and we ordered in, so I can't have an opinion about the atmosphere of the actual restaurant, but everything else was amazing. The delivery took just as long as it said it would, (which was quite a while because they are so popular) but it was well worth the wait. The tuna appetizer was delicious, along with the salad and soup. The rolls were so fresh, and had the perfect "rice-to-fish" ratio.
2018-01-01,1,Placed an order at 7pm cause I love their sushi and delivery is usually great. Received a call at 820 to tell me they couldn't prepare my order because they were to busy.  Safe to say I won't be ordering from their ever again. Can't wait to tell my friends.
2017-12-21,3,Nothing special. Stingy with the ginger and wasabi. The spicy California roll is literally a California roll with a squirt of spicy mayo on top. Definitely not the #1 place to go.
2017-12-16,5,Solid sushi spot. Fish is fresh and nicely cut, and the presentations are nice.  This is our go to sushi spot for dining out in Hoboken.  We also order takeout from here, which is always delivered in a timely fashion.  I would highly recommend it.
2017-12-15,1,I really don't know how this place has 4 stars because this place was terrible. I had a garden salad and it looked as if someone had just torn leaves off from a head of lettuce and threw them into a bowl because the pieces of lettuce were huge. My boyfriend and I shared the sushi for two and it's supposed to come with 12 pieces of sushi, a rainbow roll and an eel avocado roll. However, instead of the eel avocado roll, we received a spicy salmon and avocado roll, a substitution we were never informed of. The restaurant also didn't have the heat on so halfway through the meal, I had to put my coat back on because it was so cold.
2017-12-02,5,I ordered delivery and got the shrimp bento box. It was really good. The delivery time was pretty quick, too.
2017-11-19,1,Why is there hardly any rice in your sushi rolls?? Ordered once and was so disappointed. Would not cost too much to use the standard amount.... or maybe this is something they do to customers who order out? Waiting for a response.
2017-11-14,4,This is the best sushi restaurant in Hoboken and with reasonable prices to boot. We tried the tuna pizza as an appetizer, and it is alright. I recommend the Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp; it is spicy and flavorful. Kani and Seaweed salad are as expected with decent portion sizes. Recommended rolls are the Spicy Girl, Fantastic Roll, and Lovely Roll. They all have a lot of raw fish and taste really fresh.I like that this location has parking and it's BYOB :) Try Tempura Ice Cream!!!
2017-11-05,2,Pad thai tastes like it is marinated in melted candy, which I really just don't understand at all. Everything else is just okay, wish I could order a normal pad thai from here since it is so close to my apartment!
2017-10-26,1,Since moving to Weehawken from Brooklyn, I've been on the hunt for a go-to sushi spot. With all the positive reviews for this place, I was hoping we found it. Sadly, not the case. Our order took forever, and when it we got it, it was very disappointing. Rolls were packed with rice and tempura flakes. We both bit into bones with our sashimi. And my husband ordered pieces of mackerel and got some questionable cut of fish we've never seen before. Yellowtail was also ice cold like it had just been defrosted. Prices are very cheap though. So I can see the appeal if you aren't looking for great sushi/sashimi quality. Would recommend taking out since the ambiance is weird (tons of take out bags everywhere, delivery guys running in/out, and bright fluorescent lighting)
2017-10-18,5,Best sushi in all of Hoboken!! Love this place!! Highly recommended!! Ask for the Dragon Ball appetizer. It's a Kano salad wrapped in an avocado ball in yuzu sauce, absolutely fantastic!! I've always had great experiences and everyone I've brought here loves it too!! Thank you Okinawa!!!!
2017-10-14,5,Really nice place and the food I had was also amazing. Would most likely go there again. The waitress was very kind and the service was just as good as the food
2017-10-11,5,Lovedddd this joint! First of all, it BYOB with a liquor store next door, score! Saves you a good wad of cash! We had the three sushi combo with tuna, yellowtail and California roll, so simple but so delicious! We also had the TNT And Hoboken Roll, those were also delicious! The sushi comes with miso soup or salad, we chose salad. The salad was a very small bowl for 3 people, we just assumed we'd each get a small bowl. Our bad for assuming, but really what's the point of a tiny salad for 3 people?! Other than that, no complaints! Food came out quickly and the service was on point! Definetly my new go to spot for sushi!
2017-09-27,4,This is one of the best sushi places in town. We usually pick up but when we have had it delivered it came quickly. Reasonably priced for good quality food. My go-to is the hoboken roll!
2017-09-27,4,I wanted to have a quick take out sushi and this place seemed decent. It's like a 15 minute wait for take out. They have sushi and thai food which I thought was pretty cool. The sushi was a little more than my usual places. Kani salad- 4/5 This was pretty good. Your typical kani salad but they ask if you want it spicy. I got mild and it was really exactly how I imagined it to be.
2017-09-26,5,Best sushi in Hoboken without a question or any near competitors!  Perfectly fresh food and presented in a way that makes every bite enjoyable. The prices are beyond fair and service is pleasurable. BYOB joint and the liquor store is doors away. Just please don't go Mondays, I need my space :)
2017-09-19,5,My new go to sushi place for sure. Been here twice and I've loved the service and every sushi/sashimi  plate is extremely fresh and nicely plated. The crispy calamari is superrrr crispy and they're pretty big pieces, so delicious! I also love that they're byob! the server brought me an ice bucket for mine. so definitely bring your bottle of wine!My mom and I got the shumai, spring roll, and shared the combo for 2, enormous we could not finish it all and took the rest home.
2017-09-11,4,Good sushi at a pretty reasonable price! I had the Oki roll which was delicious. A friend tried the pad thai which they really liked. The dinner bento boxes are also good and come with a ton of food. The best part is it is BYOB! There is a liquor store right next store to pick up some drinks beforehand.
2017-09-10,2,The food had no flavor. I ordered the Shumai and Yellow Curry Entree. The shumai was good...very flavorful but the entree tastes like nothing and I'm not even kidding. So glad I ordered  the soup and shumai otherwise I would have no dinner. That yellow curry was just awful
2017-09-07,1,I do not want to give them even one star. I ordered delivery through Seamless and all rolls were not good. I didn't even eat them and when I complained through Seamless customer service, they wouldn't do anything except provide a refund of $5.08 on my $25 order for the roll where they left out my salmon. On top of making the wrong roll, the spicy tuna was dry and not mixed well. The spicy scallop avocado roll had no taste. Very disappointed with my order and their lack of customer service. I will not be ordering from them again.
2017-08-24,5,I recently tried this place since they actually delivered to my house and I'm going on fourth order with them. Their sushi is pretty damn good for it being local and their delivery is always super fast, my new go to sushi place for takeout now
2017-08-18,5,Best sushi in hoboken. Love how they don't put too much rice around the outside of the rolls. Also super fast delivery. Hoboken roll
2017-08-05,5,This is the best sushi place in Hoboken. The fish is always fresh and the rolls aren't overloaded with rice. When you dine in they do A great job of presenting the dishes as well. My only gripe is the location, since it's pretty far from Washington st & all the main dining and entertainment.
2017-08-03,4,Last summer, my friend and I both moved to Hoboken around the same time. The first place we had lunch together was at Okinawa and we were both elated that the food was delicious! Since then, I've come to Okinawa many more times and have ordered take-out. The sushi is affordable and they have a variety of rolls and sushi/sashimi dishes. I usually get the CHIRASHI these days, which comes with 20 pieces of sashimi. I've been to A LOT of sushi restaurants in the city, both cheap and expensive, and I'm satisfied with what Okinawa has to offer and its prices.The restaurant is usually pretty busy but I've never had to wait for a table. They are closed on Tuesdays, fyi!
2017-07-28,1,Came here for dinner last night with my husband and brother in law.  Fish was not fresh and the rice was not sturdy enough to hold the rolls together. My brother in law's sushi rolls were falling apart. My rolls had a lot of ingredients (which I was excited about) but lacked flavor. My husband was unimpressed by his sushi and sashimi order. Overall, this place is highly overrated.
2017-07-24,5,This is my favorite sushi place - EVER. The shrimp tempura is absolutely out of this world. No other place compares. Their fried rice is also amazing - it has tomatoes in it which is a nice twist to a common dish. The pork dumplings, chicken on a stick, and rock shrimp appetizers are also fantastic. I've never dined at this restaurant, but the take out has worked out great every time. Order from here - you won't regret it!!!
2017-07-16,5,Ordered from here for the first time today. Had other sushi in Jersey City that doesn't even come close to this! I got exactly what I ordered and it tasted fresh and delicious. Delivery was quick, under 30 minutes. Highly recommend!! Yummmm!
2017-07-06,5,Now that I live literally down the block and have ordered/eaten in almost 1,000 times, it's safe to say Okinawa is my favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. My fave: the spicy maki combo with green salad! So much food for a great price, ridiculously fresh and delivery is super quick!
2017-06-15,4,Went to this place for the first time 3 weeks ago. I have been back there twice since. Food is very good. Will definitely make this place one of my regular stops. Love that it is a BYOB.
2017-06-11,4,I'm not a sushi fan and I only know this place through take-out, but they're usually pretty quick when it comes to delivery and the food is always satisfying and tasty. I had the salmon teriyaki bento box (I usually order the chicken) , miso soup, and a salad, all of which I enjoyed (although I could have done with less iceberg lettuce in the salad). My co-workers ordered 2 Spicy Tuna Rolls, a Philly Roll, a chicken Yaki Udon (no mushroom), a shrimp Tempura Roll...nothing negative as far as any of them were concerned. The only negative point...one co-worker wanted to lower this a star, but I ultimately decided otherwise...is that the guy who delivered it asked for a larger tip. I've never encountered that before, and find it distasteful. Other than that, we're all happy ordering from here.
2017-06-01,5,By far, I've NEVER been disappointed with their food or their service. They deliver. I've ordered from them a few times since moving to Jersey City after trying a few spots closer to me. Great food and they are very professional. They will not disappoint!
2017-05-08,2,Want to like this place since its so close to my apartment, but every time I order from here I am disappointed. My sushi rolls are always tiny with hardly any fish in them and there is always a wait when I order pickup. Not impressed.
2017-04-24,3,Usually our go to for sushi in Hoboken.  Here's why:Pro's: they're fairly quick (on nights when it's not busy we've received our delivery in 20-25 min from placing the order online), their quality is fairly consistent, and their prices are pretty fair.Con's:  this goes for anywhere, but if the weather's bad or it's a Friday night, expect a wait.  If you get something that's not up to par or incorrect, it's a bit of a challenge to explain (and more importantly convince them to come out and drop off the right thing).  It's not the best I've ever had, but again due to the price and the fact that it's not the worst I've had in the area (there are plenty places where the food is pretty gross), this place is ok.
2017-04-24,2,The grilled octopus was not good.  The sushi was average at best.  The sashimi was average with questionable quality for tuna.  The atmosphere is somewhat weird with people constantly coming in and out.  I didn't enjoy the experience at all.
2017-04-21,5,Awesoooomeee! Sushiband the tom yum was great i hate typing a bunch of blah blah this is a great restaurant ... coming here agaon no questions asked
2017-04-20,2,This place is average at best.  I ordered spider roll, dragon roll, lobster tempura roll, all 3 had exactly same ingredients and sauces, except the spider and lobster were more deep fried which tasted plain and oily.  All 3 rolls lacked in taste, the eels in the dragon roll did not seem very fresh, and it was more eel skin than actual meat.  We also ordered tempura box, the dumplings in there were hard and its obvious it's from frozen dumplings.  The miso soup were from instant soup packages.  I am not sure why this place is 4 stars.  The quality of food is far below its overhyped ratings.
2017-04-16,3,It's a cute place to go eat with there byob. Some days sushi is amazing and some unfortunately just meh, which is weird. The quality of sushi should always stay the same. Always love to order delivery here, since they always would bring it to your door. But today wasn't the day, delivery guy called me and I told him I will buzz him. He said ok. Nobody comes. I walk down after 5 minutes waiting, he just parked lol then instead of my voss water I get some cheap water. Sheesh I pay more, plus tip and need to pick up my food from outside. So I will just start ordering sushi from restaurants closer by, since they don't stand out anymore. Too bad.
2017-04-13,5,Ordered delivery from here a few times and the food is always amazing. Comes pretty quick and is always fresh tasting. I would highly recommend the sweet potato rolls.
2017-04-10,2,I have to say, this is an Ok sushi restaurant. It is small but super busy because of their crazy amount of to-go order. I sat at the bar area and waited for our sushi for more than 30 mins. I started to regret that I didn't order any appetizer. After the meal, I ordered Tempura ice cream as dessert. It took almost 15 mins to get the ice cream. Meanwhile, it was not cut into pieces so that it lost all the fun and tastes of Tempura Icecream. They have like 4 or 5 sushi makers to make sushi but they are really slow because of the to-go orders. It's not cheap and it's not worth the price. I don't know why they have a 4 stars reviews, but I really think it's a 3 star and one star off because of their slow service and terrible tempura ice cream.
2017-04-08,2,Im amazed the place is rated as the best sushi in Hoboken.   The rolls dont even hold together.  This is the third time Ive tried the place.  The taste is no different than any other basic sushi place, but the chef doesnt know how to roll!   Will never order again, and sad to say it is like so many other restaurants in Hoboken, the people ordering that are the NEW Hoboken dont know what they are ordering nor good food from bad, so they ratings and reviews arent any good.
2017-04-02,5,We always order delivery from this place! At lease once a week! We are always very excited for their food. Love love their special rolls!!! Our favorite is crazy tuna roll and tsunami roll. Their sushi / sashimi is very fresh and tasty! Can't wait to visit the restaurant once it gets warmer.
2017-03-30,5,Sat at the sushi bar watching 6 sushi chefs compiling amazing dishes. It was a non stop show of artists working their craft. The sushi was great, good music and a full house on a Thursday night. Excellent menu. Fyi, it is byob (bring your own beer).
2017-03-30,4,The food was exceptional.  I had soup and a special roll and both were of the finest quality.  The service was attentive but not overbearing.    I heartily recommend this place.  It even has parking, which for Hoboken is really great.
2017-03-20,1,Food was good but servis was troubleserver need to pay attentionI never gonna game back!!
2017-03-19,2,Ordered unagi don and vegetable tofu teriyaki to go, the latter one is so weird. I've never seen  teriyaki sauce and vegetable separated, aren't you supposed to mix the sauce with the vegetable to make a dish?
2017-03-15,5,I work at the hospital and frequently stop in for dine-in and take-out, and delivery. I've always been completely satisfied. Prices are very reasonable and preparation is great. You can't beat the parking lot!
2017-03-10,1,Currently waiting over 1 hour and 25 minutes for delivery. Would have never placed an order knowing my food is going to take a total of 2 hours to get here.. to our Hoboken apartment. Will update my review if the food is EXCEPTIONAL. I called to get an ETA and complained saying this is ridiculous. I got nothing taken off the bill let alone an apology or accurate ETA. She said it's because we ordered off delivery.com ? Makes NO sense. Order elsewhere if you're hungry in the next 2+ hours.
2017-03-05,2,We ordered a few rolls-  california roll, the eel and cucumber roll, the dragon roll (which is soft shell crab) and the rainbow roll, the rolls was small and the fish was not fresh. The negimaki is okay but jot great. The agedashi tofu is okay but not great. The pad thai was sweet and sticky consistency. The service is slow but the server tried her best to accommodate. Hope you can improve on the food quality!
2017-03-05,5,This place was SO amazing I made a Yelp account to leave a review! I've seen it highly rated but always thought it was out of the way. I'm so glad I came in here. The place is small and can be cramped, but very cute and nicely decorated. The waitress was very pleasant too. But obviously the highlight was the sushi! It was so tasty and fresh, I was just so surprised at how amazing it tasted! And at such a great price too. I got The Sandwich (SO filling), a salmon + tuna roll, and my friend tried their veggie rolls and was pleased with them too. I need to come back here and try their other rolls! You can see from all the pictures that a lot of time goes into crafting your food. Can't recommend this place more, hands down the best sushi in Hoboken!
2017-03-03,4,Was just having a night in and I decided to order out sushi and this place looked like a decent place so I made the plunge. I love that I could order right through this app, but the sushi took an hour and fifteen minutes to get here. The reason my review is 4 stars is because it is a Friday night and I get that it's probably pretty busy. Other than that, the sushi was really good and the soup was still warm by the time it got here so overall it was a decent experience minus the wait.
2017-02-19,5,Cozy atmosphere, the food was great and they were very kind to us. You can bring your own drink (wine, beer, etc.). If it's your birthday you can bring your cake and they will help you with plates, spoons and knife. I really enjoy it :)
2017-02-18,5,Great sushi, great value. Great service. Locally delivered 34 minutes from when order was placed, on a Saturday night. Have eaten in and had delivered. Just as good as the other longer standing more well known Hoboken sushi spots, just off the beaten path.
2017-02-09,4,What a great sushi selection! Their special rolls are all really good especially the Sweetheart roll! There's a little language barrier so when you make reservations I'd call again before going just to make sure they have your information. There was a little confusion last weekend when we went for dinner but the service and food made up for it. There's a parking lot so that's a plus especially in Hoboken!
2017-02-08,5,Ordered on seamless and delivery was quick! Quick for sushi. Probably came in 20 mins. They have a set for 3 rolls and miso soup for $17. We ordered two sets. It was fresh and the soup was hot when it arrived. Would definitely recommend if you are craving fresh sushi but do not want to wait an hour.
2017-02-01,5,I have been missing out. First time here and will definitely be back. Best sushi in Hoboken. Chill vibes and BYOB.
2017-01-15,5,I love the food here! Sushi is fresh, and delivery is super fast to JCH. This is my go to sushi place, the other ones in the area don't measure up to Okinawa.
2017-01-13,1,I ordered a chicken lunch combo. Chicken tasted plasticky. Nothing is eatable except rice and salad. The lowest quality of ingredients and food. My family has a Chinese restaurant in Philly. I know the tricks they do to make this shitty food. For the sake of your health, don't go there.
2017-01-08,1,We received a call from our front desk notifying us that the delivery was downstairs. Sadly, I missed the call, but called back exactly 3 minutes later. The next thing I know there's an angry delivery man at my door yelling that he "called me 12 times" and wanting to know why I "don't answer my phone." This will be our first and last order from Okinawa.P.S. The sushi was very average.
2017-01-07,5,This is my favorite sushi take-out and delivery place that is close to my house. On a snowy day such as today, when I didn't like to go out or cook something, delicious sushi meal was just between my finger tips. I just needed to log onto Yelp and place the order. The delivery service was super fast, which took about 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Everything was super fresh too!
2016-12-25,5,Found this place for delivery (on Christmas) on Grubhub. VERY VERY VERY tasty. The miso soup was very tasty the seaweed was plentiful and were huge, which was fun to chew on. We ordered Cali roll, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna. I did not have to have the CA roll, but everything thing else was YUMMY! The fish tasted fresh, the sushi was tightly rolled and the flavors worked well together. Nothing but good things. Nothing but good things, folks. I am already ready for more
2016-12-23,5,Food was excellent and service was great!!  Miso soup was on point, hot and flavorful.  We got two specialty roll crunch dragon and fairy tail roll both unbelievably delicious! Best sushi we have had in 7 months since we've made the move to New Jersey.  Definitely our new go to.
2016-12-22,2,Maybe I should have ordered sushi? We ordered Thai and I added salt, pepper, some crazy mixed up salt, I slaughtered a pig and poured its blood on it, I added Coke, the drink and the drug , and a partridge in a pear tree there was NO taste. Like...NONE. The kids would say that's BLAND AF. Two stars for the noodles being hot? You're welcome? Never again. I wish. Noodlefan delivered.
2016-12-20,5,Visited few days ago. I was glad that they had a parking space! Food quality was good and the price was good for lunch! Little cold during the winter.:( but other than that, good restaurant! To visit with a car!
2016-11-20,4,I've ordered delivery from here many times as it's my boyfriends favorite sushi in Hoboken. The delivery is free and fast!As a vegetarian I love that they will let me customize my roll (with extra fees) and the rolls are extremely fresh. My only complaint is that unless I remember to explicitly state to keep my vegetarian rolls separate from the non vegetarian rolls, they end up mixing them all together.
2016-10-28,5,Great food! Love the sushi!!! Went there a few weeks ago, will definitely go back. Parking lot which makes it convenient to park and everything we ordered was delish!
2016-10-23,1,I used to love Okinawa but based on today's experience I had to change my review. I ordered and waited TWO HOURS for my food. When it didn't arrive, I tried contacting the restaurant and no one answered the phone. Grubhub then proceeded to tell me that the restaurant cancelled the order. However, during the two hours that I waited the restaurant was clearly advancing the Grubhub process, because I was getting updates about the food being ready and on the way. Not to mention that this order was over $100; and that money is now conveniently going to be held on my card for numerous days. I really was a fan, but never again. This lack of customer service is inexcusable.
2016-10-19,5,OMG. Came here by chance! I was going crazy for some good sushi. I ordered the Kani salad and specialty rolls. The kani salad was amazing but a bit spicy, I prefer spicy food. I forgot the name of the specialty roll I order but I believe it had lobster, spicy salmon and eel. The rolls were big in portion. I will defiantly come back!
2016-10-13,5,Yum!! Went with the family while visiting my sister in Hoboken. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share, including the sushi pizza, octopus, and tuna dumpling. They were all great, the tuna dumpling was my personal favorite even though it was really big and a little tricky to eat. My mom got udon and loved it, the rest of us got a bunch of rolls to share. The best ones were the Sweet Heart and the Pink Lady rolls (the Pink Lady was really big but the pieces of fish were sooo fresh and tasty, it didn't matter--catch me shoveling those in my mouth next time I'm in Hoboken). The Sandwich roll was funny--literally a little sandwich! It could have used more fish because I got a couple bites that were mostly avocado and rice but it was a cool idea. We also got sashimi to share which was also delicious. Big pieces of fish, and when we told them we didn't like white tuna they swapped it out for a different kind of fish. Everything was super fresh and delicious, sushi had big pieces of fish and not too much sauce. Will definitely be going there again!
2016-10-11,4,Love this place, this is my go-to Sushi spot. The food is always good, prices are fair (still cheaper than most places on Washington St). I've eaten in the restaurant, and ordered delivery -- the quality is consistent. They have a slight discount if you pay in cash.
2016-10-03,5,We order here literally once a week (twice if we are feeling extra lazy about cooking ... :) and the food is always good. Super fresh sushi, lovely dumplings and solid noodle dishes. Highly recommend - oh and delivery guy is always on time and friendly!
2016-09-10,5,Got maki lunch for takeout. It was ready in like 5 minutes. Good sized solid fish pieces (as opposed to minced fish you get at some cheap places) in the sushi. Sushi tastes fresh and the price is competitive for Hoboken. Miso soup has some tofu and seed weeds in it, which is great. Okinawa also has a distinctive advantage compared to the restaurants on Washington St - free parking! I think this is my new go to place for sushi in Hoboken  :-)
2016-09-08,1,I never write reviews either but my entire order was terrible. Overall quality of ingredients and complete dish poor. Not ordering again.
2016-09-07,5,Score. Creative. Affordable. Fresh. Fast delivery. Tons of options. Will enjoy this place as choice number one for sushi. I don't write reviews. But this time I had to. Attention to detail is hard to find.
2016-09-04,1,Do not waste your time and money by going there. My wife and I were looking for a new Sushi place after finding out that our regular joint went south with the last review so went here to try. Well let me start of with hospitality and service!! We got seated right away so that was a good sign but it went down hill from there. Food is okay okay and service is horrible, the waitress was very rude and took for ever to clean the table after appetizers. I dropped some water on the table and she didn't even bother to put tissues on the floor. So we just went along with the food and drinks without any visit from the waitress to see if the food was good or if we needed anything else.  Right after we finished she came and dropped off the bill without even asking us if we were done with the food or if we needed any dessert. We were planning to order desert but after what happened, we no longer were in a mood to sit there any longer. I had to walk over to the main hostess by the front door to pay the bill. I complained to her and mentioned that service was horrible and didn't apologize that the service was bad. Definitely not going there again!!!!!!!
2016-09-02,4,Pleasantly surprised to find some fresh fish so close to me! I've only ordered the lunch specials here but for the price of the sashimi lunch, you get so much fish! The first time I ordered this it came with salmon, tuna, and yellowtail though another time the yellowtail was replaced by white tuna (or escolar). 9 pieces of melt in your mouth goodness accompanied by a nice portion of rice, miso soup, and garden salad. The slices of fish are also quite thick, which is always greatly appreciated! I will continue to come back, especially with its convenient location.
2016-08-23,4,Came on Yelp for some Thai recommendations that would deliver to my hotel. Didn't feel like going out after a long day of doing tourist things in the area. My family was exhausted and starving. I gave this place a shot based on reviews. I called stating I was placing an order and had some very hungry kids in which I would greatly appreciate a speedy delivery, estimated time was over an hour. They came through with some great food. I have had some past experiences elsewhere in which portions were either too small and others too much, these were just a little bit much which helped in our case. Everything was delicious and hot! Chicken Soup, salad that came w/entrees, gyoza, General Tso Chicken and 2 noodle entrees (beef udon and chicken pad thai) were perfect. I didn't order any sushi so my rating doesn't include that. I will be stopping in at this location when in town again. My family thanks you greatly for such quick service.
2016-08-17,4,Around noon, not crowded at all. They got a 4 star instead of a 5 because we had a bit of a bad experience with this one waitress. My Uncle asked her a question and she responded with "just read the menu" uh RUDE. Then she spilled one of our glasses of water. She managed to clean it up with one of our napkins. Other than that food and deals were great  the sushi was delicious and the bento boxes were fresh.
2016-08-16,3,Decent sushi and surprisingly fast delivery. Good value and tasty food. Sashimi was fresh and medium quality. Fried rice was Fabulous! They forgot my yellow tail but came back a second time twenty minutes later. I'd use them again.
2016-08-15,4,This review is for take out.I ordered the Okinawa Salad as well as Tuna and Eel sashimi. Everything was really good. The fish tasted fresh.The Okinawa Salad had a solid amount of fish, but was light on the salad part. It was supposed to have a radish seaweed salad, masago scallions and chefs special sauce, but as far as i could tell, this was regular seaweed salad.They said delivery time would be 45 mins to an hour, which I found to be accurate.
2016-08-14,4,Ordered delivery, and it was prompt and pretty tasty. Would order again!
2016-08-05,4,Tofu teriyaki was awesome. Rock shrimp hand roll was absolutely amazing! We will definitely order again. Long delivery time is well worth the wait.
2016-07-29,5,Really really fresh sashimi & sushi! The yellowtail & tuna just melts in the mouth & the specialty rolls are some of the best I've ever had. The avocado salad is crazy with fresh avocado & the edamame is always great! AND?!!? they deliver to some spots in Jersey City!!! Their take-out/delivery is as good as eating in the restaurant! Seriously, I hope they keep up the great work. They are my go to sushi spot & thus far, never been a disappointment.
2016-07-29,3,The food is great and good quality, but I would not recommend eating in the restaurant.. I was the only table in the restaurant and the service was slow and unattentive. We were seated and did not receive menus until we requested them ten minutes later. I will only order take out now.
2016-07-25,4,I can't lie, I had very few expectations of this place, walking in at 10:45 on a Saturday when they were closing at 11. After spending the entire day (12+ hours!) helping a friend pack her apartment for a move, sushi sounding amazing for my famished body, and this was the only option both open and nearby. In a starved stupor, neither of us considered the option of take out (right?! Clearly we were delusional from lack of food) - so we walked. and walked. and walked until we made it (okay, we only walked about 10 minutes, but have I established our starvation? So yes, we were a little sad when they said we could only get takeout. And yes, we bought a party platter for 2 which had chirashi, sashimi, and 2 different types of rolls, plus a salad and soup. And yes, we took that home and devoured it - only to be extremely pleasantly surprised at both the quality and quantity of our meal. Will definitely visit again if/when in the area - couldn't have been more pleased (and I can say that, knowing we didn't finish our entire meal that night and ate the rest for lunch the next day, and it was still good).
2016-07-24,2,Went here for dinner during a Sunday night. I got the chirashi bowl and my boyfriend got the Mongolian beef with scallions and onions. Chirashi bowl was $23 with a hefty amount of fish and rice. Was highly satisfied. But the Mongolian beef was really bad and portion was so small for the $18 I paid. Not worth it at all. Staff was nice and attentive. However I would rather go somewhere in the city to eat. Typical Asian food and probably a better place for lunch.
2016-07-12,3,Took a friend here a few weeks ago, and I will be honest to say I was not really impressed with the food. The sushi was alright, wish I ordered more to give it a more accurate review, however I do NOT recommend the Teriyaki chicken dish at all. The chicken itself was bland, with lightly drizzled teriyaki sauce zig-zag across, not to mention the portion for the price ratio was horrible. Thankfully I ordered sushi at the beginning to leave there content along with the salad that came with the dish. The place is small, so it can become hard to hear the person across from you, with customers who have a semi-loud voice easily. Parking is great, since they have their own little parking lot.
2016-07-07,4,Tried the chirashi lunch special and I really liked it. The sashimi were fresh and the rice was good too. Would definitely come here for good sushi in the jersey city area.
2016-06-26,4,Great food and an extensive menu, and all reasonably priced. I've ordered (free with $15 min!) delivery from here a few times. Using the Yelp app was super easy and they've never made a mistake on an order. Plus: they usually arrive within 45 minutes. Which means I can order, start an episode of Orange Is the New Black and by the time the credits are rolling, my doorbell rings. It's perfect. My only qualm is that the food is room temperature when it arrives, and I like my sushi ~cold~. But that's a risk you take with delivery.
2016-06-18,1,I normally don't write reviews,  but I ordered from this restaurant based on the positive ones so I thought I'd help some of you out! I spent  $30.00 and the only thing that was good was the small salad that came with the uncooked chicken and shrimp udon noodles. There are far better spots in Hoboken.
2016-06-13,4,Ordered takeout from here a couple of times, and it was definitely my favorite spot for Sushi in Hoboken. They were always quick, fairly priced and the food never disappointed. I've tried a number of items on the menu including pad thai, gyoza and a variety of rolls - everything was always flavorful and fresh. Was never really able to sit down for a meal but there was ample seating and parking so it seems like a good place for a group.
2016-06-04,5,Delicious and pretty average pricing for the area. My favorite is the golden coast roll and for some reason, their tuna avocado is the best I've ever had. Also, very good shrimp shumai.
2016-05-30,3,Sashimi is no as fresh as some other similar price restaurant. Pad this is too sweet. Edemane is okay.
2016-05-30,5,Very fast delivery and food quality stays high. Love the different specialty rolls. Would reccomend.
2016-05-30,4,Average sushi with good prices for the area. Really good rolls and apps. I recommend the Seared tuna, soup, and speciality rolls.
2016-05-26,3,Ordered sushi and pineapple fried rice. Sushi was good, but the fried rice was terrible. I ended up frying it up myself because it was not at all caramelized. Did not taste like much. Very disappointing. Stick to sushi here.
2016-05-24,4,After several trial and errors with other sushi restaurants in Hoboken, I'm glad to have finally found Okinawa. **Only experiences have been with delivery**I'm very picky about house salads with ginger dressings, but I have to say this was one of the best I've had. Sushi is super fresh, they have a great menu, and delivery is fast. Spicy tuna roll also holds up to my impossible standards. Impressed.
2016-05-22,4,I feel extremely lucky to have this place mere blocks away from home.All the sushi and sashimi that I've had from here has been damn fresh and delicious. Their rolls are top-notch, especially my go-to spicy ones: salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, and scallop. The portions are pretty fair and sometimes even generous, especially considering the price. No doubt, you get value here.I typically order delivery, even though it's so close. The restaurant itself is also nice, and the service is typically great, although there were a few minor, forgivable hiccups in the past. The only thing that's holding this place back from a full 5 stars is their dining set up. They have such nice tables, chairs, plates, sushi bar, and overall decor, yet they had to ruin it with cheap, disposable chopsticks, and paper napkin, and take out menus. Are you kidding me??
2016-05-22,5,Really good food here. We usually order from seamless and they are really fast. Always on time. On the occasions that we eat inside the restaurant, Everytime was a good experience. The workers are really sweet! They were playing with my son and they aren't rude or pushy. It's byob, which is always a great thing. The liquor store is just next door. So it's not as if you have to go far. Fresh fish. I recommend the roll that is wrapped in cucumber. The bento box is also a hit. They give you so much food! So many sides included in the box. Tempura, dumplings, a roll, soup or salad, and then your main dish of choice. Thumbs up!
2016-05-19,5,This is my go-to Hoboken Sushi place takeout place (and trust me, I've tried them all in town).  Hot, fast and always fresh, the value of Okinawa is excellent.  We placed a huge order for 12 people. I included names in my order to correspond with each dish. When delivered, they had taken the time to write each person's order on the items.  Not one thing was missing. Excellent!
2016-05-16,4,If you want a tasty, fairly priced, low-calorie maki rolls that are prepared immediately you should hit this spot. This is my usual spot for a quick lunch special pick-up. I have eaten here many times. Spicy tuna rolls, salmon avocado rolls, tuna avocado rolls. They are consistently delicious. It's really a no brainer. They have 2 or 3 roll specials. You get 6 pieces with each order plus miso soup and salad.The location is conveniently located within a shopping plaza which gives you a better chance to find a parking spot after all this is Hoboken. Finally they offer BYOB which is awesome. So stop by and get your lunch special!
2016-05-13,4,Good Staff Good SushiGood Quality Will not go back Will recommend If you like sushi go somewhere else If you like Chinese food you should try.
2016-05-12,2,Really unfortunate that after two years of giving Okinawa business, I had a very unpleasant experience that will stop me from ordering from them in the future.After an hour waiting for delivery (the estimated time, so totally fine) the sushi was delivered with a missing roll (a $16 roll). The delivery man was apologetic and told me to call the restaurant.The woman who picked up was annoyed, unapologetic and said she'd send the roll back to Jersey city shortly. Then, almost a half hour later the roll did not show up and I called to tell her to cancel the additional roll. (It was 10:00, I had ordered at 8:30 and did not want it anymore). The woman said it had already left the restaurant and she was very passive aggressive, placing the blame on me for telling her to send the missing roll in the first place. After some discussion of a refund on that roll, she let me know that this was "impossible" and offered a $5 coupon and hung up on me very abruptly. Never expected such rude, unprofessional behavior from this place, sad that one cranky hostess can taint their reputation.Will take my business elsewhere.
2016-05-07,3,Waiter was nice, but this is not a Japanese sushi establishment. It's Chinese run, if you want quick sushi, than eat here. Clean place, but sushi isn't prepared traditionally at all.
2016-05-04,4,Sushi is great here! There are definitely some better sushi places in the city, but this place beats out any place I've tried in Hoboken, by far. I'm pretty picky about my sushi - the fish has to be fresh, the rice has to be cooked well and the right texture, the ingredients have to pair well together and be proportioned well in each roll. Okinawa meets all the criteria. It's on the pricier side, so you won't be getting one of those $20 all-you-can-eat deals, but the quality sushi is definitely worth it.The nabeykai udon was very good - a comfort food, for sure. It had chicken, mixed veggies, fish cake, a bit of (imitation) crab, a poached egg, and two pieces of shrimp tempura on the side. I was glad the tempura was on the side so it didn't get soggy in the soup. The broth was light and very flavorful, and the chicken was still tender and not overcooked.I've also tried the Thai Spicy Chicken, which I thought was cooked very well. It wasn't quite what I expected - it was a bit creamy and maybe a little coconut-y. Not usually my cup of tea, but I still enjoyed my meal and I think others who like those flavored would think it was even more tasty. The service was also friendly and quick here. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. She brought out our appetizers very quickly, which we loved. Afterwards, one of our meals was brought out first and it took a long time for the other entree to come out (so neither of us were eating), maybe another 10 minutes. The waitress noticed this (without us saying anything) and came to let us know that the dish was coming and apologized for the inconvenience. She also was very nice to offer us an order of edamame on the house :)Each table had fresh flowers this past time I went here - it was a nice touch. This is a casual but nice place, not too crowded, average noise level. Could be a good date spot for sushi lovers!
2016-04-28,5,Review is for a delivery order. I ordered here for the first time tonight. I got the Salmon Don entree with a salad, a tuna & avocado roll and a miso soup. While a few dollars more than my typical delivery places, this place was worth it and I can't imagine ordering sushi delivery from anywhere else now. Salmon Don entree that comes with a soup/salad costs about $22 and comes with a good portion of sushi rice, topped with furikake and seasoned perfectly with subtle vinegar flavor- order included 15 well sized and fresh tasting nice cuts of melt-in-your-mouth salmon sashimi. Tuna roll was fresh and perfectly sized. There were generous amounts of wasabi, ginger and soy sauce included in the order. Miso soup was very good and not skimpy on the seaweed and tofu. I was quoted 45-60 minutes for delivery, but order arrived in about half an hour on a weekday evening. Delivery guy was very friendly and called to let me know he was at the door. Two thumbs up.
2016-04-20,1,Today, I ordered 9 of sushi and something else, but only 7 of sushi came.So I called to Okinawa to talk about missing dish, then they said "we don't have material." They just gave me 7 sushi , didn't call me to notice that they don't have any material or change price or change menu. They just said to me if I order next time, they will give me a today's missing dish. WHAT THE HELL. do I have to order again after experience kind of this poor service? so I told them no. After talking, they promised that they will give me a money back to my apartment, but still now, I didn't receive a money and they didn't get my call because they "have to go home"THEY JUST TAKE MY MONEY ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T GIVE ME A RIGHT DISH.THIS IS CLEARLY STEALING.
2016-04-20,3,Ok so I ordered this tonight for delivery for the first time I normally order from illusion while I was eating I was think wow this is so much better fresher and better tasting LOVED IT amazing! however I was picking up one of my last rolls and was like what is that and there was three short hairs ugh gross ....I know everyone can't be perfect and mistakes happen so that's the only reason for the ding on stars bug it was still gross
2016-04-10,4,Really good sushi and free delivery. I have gotten sick from a few other local sushi places but have had no issues here. Gave 4 stars because the girl who answers the phone is rude and unprofessional. Kept yawning while taking my order. Sorry I bored you. But other than that, really good rolls :)
2016-04-08,5,I am driving 45 minutes in each direction to enjoy the excellent sushi .It is one of the best sushi I have had.
2016-04-04,4,First off, can we say free parking in Hoboken?! The place is nice, sit at the sushi bar if it's just you or 2 people. I got the Chirashi lunch. I appreciated the effort they put into presentation. Food is good. Nothing that blew my mind but satisfied my sashimi craving. Super nice service. They gave me a salmon seaweed salad on the house!The uni pics on Yelp got me in the door but they didn't have any today. Yes, it is Chinese owned and run so don't expect authentic Japanese food. It's Fusion. But I gotta say, it's probably the first Chinese run Japanese restaurant I would come back to.
2016-04-03,2,The servers were extremely rude, they messed up our order then told us we messed up ordering, and forgot to bring out a lot of items even though we asked countless times. The food was great but not sure if we will return due to this poor and rude service. When we arrived the "hostess" was on the phone and pointed and snapped us into a table, no greeting. Very rude, need to reconsider how to treat customers. There are plenty of great sushi places in the area, but you can't treat your customers that way.
2016-04-02,5,This is my favorite sushi spot in Hoboken. Great sushi, reasonably priced, and fast delivery. I haven't eaten in, but have gotten delivery many times. Their special rolls are pretty par for the course as far as creativity goes, but are always flavorful and well made. Their fish consists of good cuts of meat and always tastes fresh. I always go with a white tuna hand roll, and one or two of their special rolls, at least one with fruit and one with shrimp tempura and/or eel. I haven't tried their other Asian dishes but the crab Rangoon is really good too! For sushi in Hoboken, start here!
2016-03-30,4,My favorite sit-down sushi in Hoboken. Good service, better value than its competition, great sushi. BYOB. No real complaints here. Was tempted to give it a five star rating, but decided not to because I've had a better value in sushi dining elsewhere. But not in Hoboken, so maybe the higher local rent means it deserves 5 stars.
2016-03-27,3,Great dishes, the chefs are doing an amazing job here. The service is great too. The place however is not very apealing, don't bring your date.Prices are fair.
2016-03-24,4,love this place. The sushi was delicious the atmosphere was good but still needs a little bit of work they still have some Christmas decorations hanging and Valentine's stuff up. They have an extensive menu to choose from and I also love the fact that they are BYOB. They also do delivery and there's lots of parking.
2016-03-18,5,Great Sushi place. I've never had a bad meal here. The sushi always tastes fresh and it's nice that it is a BYOB with a liquor store right in the same strip mall if you want to grab a bottle of wine. Insider tip: Order the Philadelphia roll with fresh salmon (not smoked salmon). Once I tried this I never turned back and now my gf and I always order one of these rolls a couple of special rolls.Another favorite of ours is the Golden Coast roll and you always need to finish the meal with red bean tempura ice cream!
2016-03-07,5,Found this restaurant on Delivery.com a few months ago.  Was looking for a new Japanese food restaurant that delivers in Jersey City after suffering food poisoning from food prepared by another, different Japanese food restaurant in Jersey City.  Have ordered delivery 1-4x a week from Okinawa Sushi & Grill for the last few months and the food has consistently been prepared well (even included numerous special requests/substitutions) and has been delicious, and the deliveries have been very fast (sometimes in under 20 minutes from the time I ordered).  The prices seem pretty reasonable to me for the quantity and quality of food, as well.  Would recommend Okinawa to anyone looking for great Japanese food in Jersey City or Hoboken.
2016-02-29,5,Love the sushi here especially all the specialty rolls and the lunch specials are reasonably priced for the area
2016-02-28,4,I have dined in the restaurant and have ordered for delivery and have had great experiences with both. The fish is always fresh and delicious {salmon avocado and shrimp shumai are my favorites}. They also have some great special rolls that aren't spicy. I do not like spicy food and this is the only place in Hoboken i have found that caters to someone who wants a more elaborate roll without spicy tuna or spicy mayo on it.The delivery is also so fast!  My apartment isn't too far away but when I ordered a few minutes before I was leaving work {I live 1/2 a mile from where I work in Hoboken} the delivery guy was already at my door! Amazing.
2016-02-21,1,I can't believe these reviews - this place is horrible.  Teriyaki dishes are like eating jello with boiled meat inside.  Fried rice has tomatoes in it. Rock shrimp smothered in mayo and sushi was very average.  Robongi blows this place away for delivery.  Never again. Complete garbage - I would give it less than a star if possible.
2016-02-15,5,Best sushi around! They have so many unique rolls that are absolutely delicious and so fresh! The udon noodles have a great flavor as well!
2016-02-14,5,Best sushi joint in town. Reasonable prices and quick dlvy. Great cooked food as well and byob 9/10
2016-02-10,1,I have been ordering take out from this place for about a year now, and every time I called to order, it was a hassle to try to get them to deliver to my area. Sometimes they would say yes and sometimes no, because allegedly they are too busy in the middle of the week. My average order was between $40-$50. Their customer service sucks, but the sushi is decent. Unfortunately I would not be ordering from them again due to their poor customer service. I am not one to spend time writing reviews for anything, but I am very disappointed in this sushi place.
2016-02-06,4,Great place with a huge selection of vegetarian sushi & hot dishes as well. The service is great & attentive.
2016-02-04,5,I have been living in Hoboken for the past 8 years and I believe this place is my favorite sushi house in all of Hoboken. Robungi? Good if your 21 and like techno, sushi lounge? Small rolls that are overpriced. This place delivers great sized rolls and it's a BYOB-- how can you beat that???? Their special rolls with tune and salmon and shrimp tempura are always delicious. Kani salad and edamame is a must have. Their spicy mayo is the perfect consistency. This is my new go-to for sushi.
2016-02-01,4,I was looking for a nice sushi place with byob and so glad I found this. First I'd like to say the interior was very nice. Had a modern and clean feel to it which I liked. The waitress was friendly and welcoming and got us everything we needed. One thing I picked up on which I don't see too often is the waitress would come over and rearrange our table and dishes to create space before bringing over our sushi. Usually you'll see servers bring the food and then fumble around with one hand and sometimes knocking things over. We got the sushi/sashimi combo for 1 along with spider roll and salmon avocado roll. It was all delicious and fresh. The prices are reasonable too at around 6-8 for the regular rolls and 12-16 for the special ones. All in all, I was very comfortable here and will definitely be coming back
2016-01-31,4,We would always end up here whenever we came back from a short holiday and looking for something fast, delicious, fresh and close to Jerry C. Apartment, also, the convenience of the adjacent liquor store is handy since Okinawa Sushi and Grill is BYOB.My favorite here is Chirashi, with omelet slices, sashimi,  Nori and Roe arranged in a very artistic way and served with Sushi rice and Miso Soup. The shrimp and pork gyoza that we enjoyed sharing deserves a special mention as well. The service is quick but did not compromise the quality of food. They also do not charge for a corkage fee. This place is truly a great add on to this lovely neighborhood.
2016-01-31,4,I wouldn't go here for the ambience, but the sushi was among the best I've ever had - crazily fresh.
2016-01-16,4,I've written in another review that Wild Fusion's rolls are so padded with rice and look like they're melting in a Dali painting.  It was refreshing that there's at least a sushi joint, albeit Chinese owned, that takes pride in making rolls.  They're ship-shape, light on rice, and pretty to look at if not tasty.  And I'm giving this place 4 stars despite waiting for 2 hours for my delivery, and then calling to learn that they never put in the seamless order.
2016-01-14,4,Tuna and avocado salad was awesome-fresh ingredients and very tasty. Happy I moved nearby.
2016-01-01,5,Great service, excellent fresh sushi and the pan fried dumplings are great! BYOB as well
2015-12-30,5,The place is small and the service is mediocre, however, the prices are great and the sushi is VERY good. I am very picky about sushi and after leaving this place I am very satisfied. I live in Hoboken snd this is probably the best sushi I have had here. 15% off if you dine from 4-6pm!
2015-12-23,5,Finally another good sushi spot in Hoboken! We ordered a couple of regular rolls and they were absolutely loaded with fish and the good stuff. Hopefully the keep it that way and don't progressively stuff it with more and more rice like some of the other Hoboken sushi places.Thanks for a great dinner!
2015-12-20,4,Exceptional sushi where you'd least expect it - next to wings to go and dunkin donuts? It's true. Upon coming to Hoboken many people told me this was the best sushi in Hoboken. Coming from Brooklyn I scoffed. I shouldn't have been so quick to diminish Frank Sinatras birth place as the home of great sushi - but I did. The rolls are super fresh and perfectly made. Today I had the Spicy Trio, Yellow Tail Jalapeño and peanut avocado. The peanut avocado is a creamy crunchy masterpiece and the other rolls delicious. It's not cheap and the service is sort of blah but you can't go wrong with this place. Even the edamame on pickup is on point.
2015-12-16,4,I love getting takeout from Okinawa. The food is great, moderately priced, delivery is fast and the service is on point.
2015-12-06,4,Second-best sushi in Hoboken (Robongi is my #1).I've ordered from here quite a few times and had good luck with the standard rolls.  The fish has always been fresh, and the rice has a good texture.  Not quite as good as Robongi's rice, but still good.  Deliveries to uptown Hoboken usually take 30 - 40 mins at prime time.The naruto rolls are also very good.  The cucumber provides a crisp, pleasant wrapper, and makes for an even healthier, lower-carb option.  The only downside is that they don't hold together as well as rice-based rolls (sushi rice sticks to itself, whereas cucumber does not).  A bit tricky to eat without them falling apart on you, so maybe best ordered when you're out with people you know well.  Other than sushi, I also enjoy the Tom Yum soup, which has a delightfully tangy broth full of tomato, lime and cilantro flavors.  Things I probably won't order again:  the gyoza, which were OK but nothing special, the Thai spicy chicken, which was not at all spicy and rather bland, and the Tuna Tataki, which is a dish I normally love, but which had a distinct 'fishy' odor the one time I ordered it here (hopefully that was just an off night).
2015-12-05,4,It's hard to find a good mid-range sushi restaurant in Hoboken on par with Manhattan, but Okinawa Sushi comes pretty close. It's probably the best west of Washington St and caters to a neighborhood crowd. There is an abundance of sushi rolls for all tastes. For lunch they have decent specials including bento-style boxes. The Seafood Udon Noodle soup is good too. At dinner I tend to stick with the Sashimi Deluxe special that is reasonably priced and the fresh pieces are fair sizes. Although the fish selection is pretty standard American, check out the few daily or weekly specials on the board. Service is quick and just wave if you need their attention. Added plus: BYOB, one of my favorite things about Hoboken. There's a wine shop in the same strip mall, so just buy a bottle before going to the restaurant.One weird note: Using the takeout menu flier as the in-dining menu is pretty tacky.
2015-11-20,2,I ordered their delivery several times. The food is all right and they came relatively fast. but the delivery guy is not nice. I went down and picked the food only 3 min after the call today. When I say hi to him, He yelled at me: Omg, I am very busy ok? Then left... I am like what the hell???
2015-11-13,4,My go to sushi place in Hoboken. Fish is fresh and its BYOB. The tuna pizza is really good and my favorite roll is the Oki Roll but everything else is good! Can't go wrong with this place.
2015-11-11,5,Sushi was really delicious and fresh. The best sushi I had so far including the ones I had in Manhattan. The prices are so fair! I will definitely come back...
2015-11-10,4,Ordered here for takeout through Seamless. Took your standard 45-55 minutes during prime dinner hours. We ordered the sushi for two (assorted sushi, eel avocado roll, and rainbow roll), which comes with two salads or soups. I wasn't a fan of the eel avocado roll but that's only because I don't like eel, so I can't hold that against Okinawa. Other than that, everything else was good.We also ordered the Okinawa salad, which was tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna with seaweed salad and radishes. I was expecting more of a 'salad' but in reality, it was just seaweed salad topped with chunks of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and white tuna, with a few pieces of radish haphazardly thrown in there. But at least the fish tasted fresh, so that's all I really care about.This seems to be the least expensive/best deal in the Jersey City/Hoboken area, so I would definitely order from here when that sushi craving hits again (which is pretty often!)
2015-11-05,3,Sushi is best in town of average sushi restaurants. A little annoying that prices seem to keep creeping up in such a short period of time
2015-10-25,3,Ordered take out & picked up- delivery estimate was 55 minutes on a Sunday night (crazy!) I ordered the special tuna roll that is highly rated on seamless and a salmon avocado roll w/miso soup. The crazy tuna roll was definitely a good choice! Their salmon and avocado roll I was less impressed with- salmon wasn't as fresh. Miso soup was also average. All in all, I'd say this is definitely a solid sushi place for Hoboken. I'd say it's comparable to sushi house, though I think I'd prefer Okinawa over sushi house any day. I'd like to come back to sit down to experience their service since I can't comment on that. Also their lunch specials are quite a steal!
2015-10-22,5,Just picked up from there and no complaints. The Shushi was delicious and so was the spicy mayo. The place looked super clean and the girl attending me was very friendly. Happy over all.
2015-10-01,4,Tonight was my first time trying this place & I ordered delivery because it was raining. I was craving sushi all day so I just had to have it.  This place did NOT disappoint!  It really hit the spot!  Now, let me just say I am pretty picky about my sushi. I was not expecting much from one in Hoboken but I really enjoyed my food here.  Very fresh- which is the most important thing to me when ordering sushi.I ordered the Oki roll, the Clear Soup, and the Avocado salad.  I wanted to order more roles and I definitely will next time. The spicy mayo & eel sauce on the Oki role was amazing. Had the perfect kick to it. The fish tasted fresh and the tempura was delicious. I can't wait to try more of their special roles & everything else on the menu! The avocado was perfectly ripe & green, and the ginger dressing was homemade tasting and flavorful.  My clear soup was great for this cold rainy night and the broth had delicious flavor. I didn't love the chicken in it (too large of pieces) but overall I would order it again because of the broth, with maybe a side of rice & no chicken.  Overall, great delivery experience & I'm looking forward to visiting the restaurant again & trying more SUSHI ROLLS!
2015-10-01,4,This place reminds me of the sushi restaurants in California. It is decently priced, rolls based sushi - a lot of sriracha mayo, spicy (insert type of fish here), but it works.I also really like their shrimp fried rice - so flavorful, huge, fresh pieces of shrimp, and butter.A very chill spot, with parking, to get your weekday sushi fix.
2015-09-30,2,We went there with a couple of friends just because of the high yelp reviews. I am so disappointed. The sshini were tooo tiny, sushi rice was so hard and bland, and their soy sauce was just a bitter black liquid. The only good things were their tuna dampling and rok shrimp appetizers. Their salad dressing was so bad. I am really surprised about the high reviews for this place. Nope. Never again.
2015-09-29,3,Fresh, but thinner slices of fish than most sushi restaurants. Fish to rice ratio is off as well. End up eating too much rice
2015-09-21,4,This is my go-to sushi in Hoboken. The fish is very fresh and the roll selection is great. Their seamless delivery is also extremely quick!
2015-09-20,1,I can't speak to the sushi (probably my first mistake) but the chicken udon and chicken curry we ordered were extremely bland and the chicken itself was very rubbery. Will not be ordering from here again.
2015-09-08,4,Very good Japanese.  The sushi is fresh, delicious, and well made.  The katsu were scrumptious.  The pineapple rice could have used fewer tomatoes and the pineapple could have been softer, but the rice was otherwise delicious.  The food arrived relatively quickly (we ordered delivery) and the delivery man was courteous!  Great spot.
2015-08-30,4,Really impressed with the overall presentation, quality of fish and the service of the wait staff. Would  highly recommend and plan a return visit.  Recommend: chicken udon, tuna salad and the gyoza.
2015-08-24,5,fantastic sushi... extremely fresh, rice is perfect, size of rolls are perfect, fast delivery... I think the best sushi I have had in Hoboken and I have had a lot...
2015-08-23,2,Admittedly, I did not try their Japanese cuisine which is probably their specialty. I had their Shrimp Pad Thai and my friends had Chicken Pad Thai as well and they were SUB-PAR. Easily the worst Pad Thai I've ever had! It was bathed in some pink sauce that made it sweet like a dessert. Pad Thai is not supposed to be sweet! My friends agreed with me that the taste was not right. Another friend got a salmon dish and he said that was awesome so I think it's safe to say that this place doesn't do Thai cuisine nearly as well as Japanese cuisine.
2015-08-23,2,Guess I'm one of those that didn't have a great experience here. Went with my wife an 9 mo old little girl. The sushi wasn't great and my roll actually had a bit of plastic wrap still on the fish. That wasn't all that confidence inspiring. The sushi and sashimi here approached "OK" levels, but nothing close to some of the raves I see in the reviews. Hobokenites must be desperate for sushi. The yakitori chicken was bland and tough and was basically plain chicken with sauce dumped on it like you'd make at home for a quick snack. Also not great was the waitress kept touching our babies face. Look, she's cute. We get it. But that doesn't give you the right to touch her face. Show a little restraint.Won't be returning.
2015-08-21,4,Nice place away from the normal Washington St restaurant row with ample parking. Fresh fish and good service, what more could you ask for.
2015-08-13,1,Sushi smelled fishy.expected higher quality food.seems like the newness is starting to wear off.Might give them another chance,but will stick with the original sushi bars in Hoboken.
2015-08-13,5,Very quick delivery, fresh, always large portions of seafood in the sushi. This is my go-to delivery/take out joint in the Jersey City and Hoboken area.
2015-07-31,2,Did someone remove my review? Okinawa - you used to be my date on Friday nights...but no more. The last date you had made my stomach queasy. I'm breaking up with you. I also told my next door neighbor that you used to be my go-to but no longer. You sadly...smell fishy....
2015-07-30,4,Great sushi spot and Hoboken needed it. Sushi Lounge has always been my only option so I'm really happy I discovered an alternative. Okinawa has many appealing factors..- It's BYOB and they have plenty of tables inside. You wont get that same fancy feel like Sushi Lounge offers but you will save a lot of money by bringing your own booze/wine.- There's a parking lot! This is almost never the case in Hoboken so this absolutely sets this place a part from others. -The sushi is fresh and good. I've tried the Ocean King, Spicy Girl, Philly and Salmon Avocado rolls. All equally delicious. I really like their specialty rolls menu too, I think they have better options than Sushi Lounge. Also, I tried the Thai Spring Rolls, which were yummy, I especially liked the dipping sauce that accompanies them.-My delivery experience was also awesome. They came quickly and the order was correct, good job Okinawa! I will continue to order from here, excited to try out their other specialty rolls.
2015-07-23,4,This sushi place delivers to Jersey City Heights! YAY! Sushi is always yummy and fresh. My only go to for this area!
2015-07-13,5,Ordered from here yesterday (they deliver to my section of JC, yay!) I think I found my new go-to spot. So good. Fresh, full of flavor, well-constructed. I tried 2 special rolls (Dancing Eel & Golden Coast) and they were both fantastic. Delicious and filling. Also tried the tuna dumplings since several Yelpers raved about them. Not disappointed. I didn't know what to expect - it was crab meat wrapped in large, tender pieces of tuna (x2). Very good. Worth the $10, for sure. Highly recommended!
2015-07-10,5,This place is awesome! Not only is the food delicious, but their service is great. They deliver pretty quick too. Definitely give it a try!
2015-07-06,4,The sushi here is very fresh. I usually order the salmon avocado roll and the spicy scallop roll and my husband orders sashimi. We've tried most of the sushi spots in hoboken and this beats them all in quality and freshness. Not the best sushi I've ever had, but there's not a lot of stiff competition in hoboken. Another perk: delivery is fast and easy on Seamless.The reason I'm not rating this place five stars: I ordered two rolls last time during lunch special hours. Because I did not specify the words "lunch special" (I only realized that my order qualified after placing the order), I was charged full price instead of the lunch special price. It was only a few dollars difference, but it's a turn off to feel as if a place is taking advantage of it's customers.All in all, I will continue to frequent Okinawa because of it's convenience and quality.
2015-07-02,5,This is my favorite sushi place in Hoboken, by FAR. Every roll I've had has been delicious and fresh. I literally rave their tuna dumpling. It is too die for. Other favorites include: spicy crab (not on the regular menu, but it's on the lunch menu and they'll make it for dinner), spicy tuna avocado, Shogun, really all of the rolls. The restaurant is BYOB and Hoboken Vine is in the same shopping center, which is great.I really can't say enough about how great the sushi is.
2015-06-29,4,I ordered the Trio Sushi for delivery. Fish was very fresh and delivery came within a reasonable amount of time. I'm deducting one star because their menu on delivery.com is incorrect. It lists the Trio Sushi as coming with an okinawa roll but it showed up with a tuna roll. I was a little disappointed when the delivery came since I was expecting the okinawa roll. The paper menu that came with the delivery does show that it comes with the tuna roll. Please update delivery.com to reflect your actual menu thanks :)
2015-06-26,5,My family and I ordered for delivery several times and each time the food was consistent. We finally drove there for dinner from downtown JC a few days ago. If I were just passing by the area, I wouldn't even look at the restaurant. The location and the outside look of the restaurant are deceiving. The experience was quite enjoyable.I recommend the Tuna Dumpling for appetizer. The sushi is always fresh; I usually get the Salmon Don (slices of salmon on a bed of rice with Bonito flake seasoning).
2015-06-21,2,I just ordered delivery from here and I'm incredibly disappointed.  Let me first start by saying the service was excellent, it was prompt and the driver was courteous.  We both ordered Pad Thai Chicken....it was very underwhelming...almost seemed like it was frozen before...almost no fresh ingredients.  The sushi was decent and the egg rolls were very low quality.   You can find better out there.
2015-06-18,5,Me and my husband always order from here because they have sushi and Chinese- he prefers Chinese/I prefer sushi. Never been disappointed. I've tried a lot of their sushi dishes and my husband really likes their General Tso's.
2015-06-16,5,It's always a great sign when the first impression I have of a new restaurant is that they've cut their expected delivery time by half... And the food is hot.I'd heard all good things about this new sushi place. I love all Japanese cuisine and am always willing to give new roll creations a try. My friend suggested the chicken and pork gyoza, which I ordered, along with the dancing eel roll and shrimp tempura hand roll.The wait time on seamless was 60-70 minutes, so imagine my delight when my door rang 25 minutes after I had placed my order. Saliva filled my mouth as soon as I opened my (hot!) appetizer and my eyes landed on my beautiful Japanese opus.Gyoza was fantastic and plentiful. I believe there were 6 pieces (maybe more, I was too overcome with joy to stop and chew). Crisp, not soggy. Flavors were great and not overpowering. I'll definitely be reordering. The tempura on the shrimp was crispy, all ingredients were super fresh. I couldn't eat it fast enough (but was trying to desperately savor every morsel while I could). I really didn't use much soy sauce because the eel sauce was so good (and I didn't want to lose the roll flavor). Just fyi , I can eat a LOT. Many of my guy friends have commented on my man vs food tendencies. This meal completely satisfied me. Overall, super happy with my choice.It's a bit on the pricier side as far as Hoboken sushi goes (gyoza+hand roll+special roll after tax and tip came to $30) but there are a few other specialty rolls I'd still like to try. Overall, I'm a big fan!
2015-06-15,4,we have ordered take-out a couple of times and the sushi is very fresh. My kids say the Salmon Don is better than Komegashi or Honshu, our other favorites. The Salmon comes in 15 smaller pieces but it really looks like a good cut, not overly large like some other sushi places. Haven't been to the actual restaurant yet, as the parking looks tight but will soon attempt a visit as they are BYO.Got a $5 discount from Delivery.com, and the delivery service is cheerful and efficient. Took about an hour, probably a busy Sunday evening.
2015-06-06,4,When you're from Los Angeles, you don't really go for sushi in New Jersey, but DANG!  This place is good!  I tried both sushi and cooked food and they rocked both of them.  We started with a Spicy Girl Roll that has spicy tuna and yellowtail with crunch inside, spicy salmon on top, and then a creamy wasabi mayo sauce.  It was AMAZING.  Actually, I have to say we get getting quality fish in LA, not that this was less than really good quality fish, but the prep on this was fabulous and can compete with the best of the best.  That was pretty much it for the sushi, though I admit taking a photo of a dining neighbor's sushi platter (yes, creepy, but I asked first) because the presentation was artistic and amazing. On to the rest of the meal, we started with salads and the dressing was really good. I had beef that was well prepared, but I might skip next time.  The shumai was downright delicious.  The California roll was a California roll and didn't stand out one way or another. My dining partner's chicken teriyaki, tasted with permission, was possibly the best I've had.  The quality and cut of the chicken was way above average.   If I stay in Hoboken again, this will be a definite return-to place, but I'll probably do more of the sushi, not because the cooked food was bad (it was above average), but because the sushi was so dang good.
2015-06-04,5,I've been here a couple of times and ordered out several times already. The sushi is fresh, the food is consistent, and the service is attentive and friendly.  It's definitely one of my "go to" restaurants for sushi.
2015-05-31,4,I found what might be a true gem! Super fresh sushi and prices that are reasonable. Almost too good to be true... Nice staff and atmosphere as well. You must try the yellow tail.
2015-05-27,5,They Deliver!!!We ordered pick up there the other night.  It was good, very good.  Picked up three standard rolls and the Veggie Udon.  Everything was excellent.  My wife and I are not sushi experts but we thoroughly enjoy Okinawa.  The prices were a bit lower then other places in Hoboken, so that's a bonus...  And an even bigger bonus- they deliver to the Heights which is why I'm giving them 5 STARS!!!! Way to go Okinawa!!!This is going to our go to place...Have Fun
2015-05-12,5,I've ordered from them from Delivery.com! They do not disappoint with their sushi selection and lunch options. I wish they would just stick to making Japanese food though, because they're pad Thai isn't that great.
2015-05-01,5,I used by delivery.com coupon to order. First time.  No food is so perfect to deserve a perfect 5 star rating, but this place got em all because it simply was delicious.  Melt in your mouth sushi.  And the sashimi was fresh.  Will go there again.   No concerns and that's why I gave it five stars.
2015-04-23,5,One of the best sushi and tempura shrimp I've had in a long time...we've ordered on Grubhub and it's always what we've ordered....
2015-04-22,4,Great location! Love that they aren't closed from 3-5 like so many sushi places are. I've only had a few rolls but all were delicious!!! Great addition to the area.
2015-04-20,3,Ordered delivery from here last night.  I didn't try the sushi, which seems to be their forte.  I got Mongolian Beef, Garlic Chicken & Pad Thai Shrimp.  The beef and chicken were both very good.  The Pad Thai was mediocre.  The food came quick and the portion sizes were solid.  I would definitely give this place another shot.  I certainly would try the sushi next time, and I would like to go dine in.  This is a solid new joint.
2015-04-14,5,Now that I've found this place, and they actually deliver to JC Heights, I find myself ordering at least once a week. Delivery is fast and the food is always amazing. The combination pad thai is better than any I've had at a Thai restaurant. I haven't even tried the sushi yet because I keep ordering the pad thai.
2015-04-14,2,Ordered delivery: Saturday Afternoon for 2ppl.    Delivery time: approx. 35mins.Apps; Gyoza - GOOD/Avg, Veggie Tempura - GOOD/Avg.  Soup; Tom Kai w/Shrimp - GOOD/Avg, however be aware there are only 2 shrimp for the additional $$.   Entrée; 2 Chicken Teriyaki w/brown rice & salad (Kitchen Entree $14 not Lunch Box $10) -   Disappointing.  The chicken was dry (most likely pre-pkg , heat & serve).   The chicken was served over snow peas, very few mushroom slices and red onion (lots of red onion).  The red onion was over powering in both amount and taste (hot).  I called to let them know I was unhappy with the entrees.  The manager was very apologetic and offered house credit, restaurant policy.   I was able to get a refund of the entrees instead.We were specifically looking for Teriyaki.  Most reviews has this as a top spot.  Guess that maybe for the Sushi.
2015-03-29,2,I ordered pad thai and fried rice for delivery and it arrived on time but to explain my order on the phone was a task. The lady barely could speak english and i couldn't understand a word she was saying. Anyhow, the pad thai so sweet that even after adding tons of sriracha sauce i couldn't taste anything but syrup like thing at the bottom of the container. Very bland weird tasting food, not for me!!!!
2015-03-28,4,Prefer takeout to dining in as the restaurant is really tight and the tables are awkwardly close together. Solid classic sushi rolls and appetizers, but the Nigiri is only one piece not two, so not a good deal.
2015-03-24,5,Best take out sushi I've had in a long time! Ordered at 12:15pm and was delivered in 35 minutes and devoured 10 minutes after!
2015-03-23,4,Nice sushi addition, especially for a local spot for its location. They did a great job making the space feel modern with a touch of zen. Had a lunch special, and all of the pieces were solid. I'll be ordering from here again.
2015-03-14,1,Can you call this sushi?  Tasteless and bland.  tuna looks like it went through a dye job and they forgot the texture.  All the sushi was so very bland did I say that already?.  This place needs to invest in a true sushi chef!  In order for the rice to taste like sushi rice (and not like ordinary rice), you need to add rice vinegar to it right after it is taken out of the pot.
2015-03-13,4,Awesome experience. Ordered on Seamless and the delivery estimate was 25 - 45 minutes. Our food came in 25! My boyfriend had the beef negimaki and a spicy tuna roll, both of which were great. I'm not a huge fan of fish so I tried the chicken tempura roll. Highly recommend if you are not a big fan of standard sushi!
2015-03-12,4,What a good new addition to Hoboken! I think this is my new favorite sushi spot. There is plenty of space so you can definitely come with big group. Also, there is a parking lot if you are coming from out of town. The service was awesome and so was the food. I especially liked the gyoza and crazy tuna roll. I will definitely be back!
2015-03-12,4,Update - Upgrade alert!Man I must have caught them on a bad day because I've ordered another 3 times from there since and it has been solid every time.This is not to say it is the greatest sushi in the world, but in Hoboken, a land of mediocre sushi, this place is solid.I'll put it on the give it a try list for anyway.
2015-03-07,1,This restaurant does not serve any Okinawan food such as shoyu pork, oxtail soup, Okinawan purple potato, bitter melon, or Okinawan soba noodles.  The cooked fish menu is also very limited.  The owner apparently is not even familiar with Okinawan dishes.
2015-02-28,5,BYOB like a lot of restaurants in Hoboken. There is also a liquor store in the same plaza which makes it extremely convenient to pick something up before dining here. Friendly staff, fast service. I have only ordered sushi and some appetizers from here so I can't speak for the full menu but everything I have had here was delicious. The seating in the restaurant is pretty tight, we felt like we were eating with the table next to us. Prices are reasonable.
2015-02-27,1,I ordered via grubhub sushi, specifically avocado roll with rice on the outside. Some lady called to clarify the order and was told to put the rice on the outside. My order comes and its cucumber strings with avocado slices on top. I called the restaurant and originally the lady who picked up said that the lady who took the order is new and she didn't understand. When told she called to clarify the new lady said she didn't even speak to anyone because no one picked up. That's not true. I spoke to her and clarified. So she begins arguing with me saying it's not entirely their fault. After 5 minutes of back and forth she said she'll send me another. Which she did, the correct order, but with no soy sauce. How do you eat sushi with no soy sauce? Chances of ordering from here again are slim. Poor customer service.
2015-02-18,5,I tried this place on Friday, it was good , I like the sushi and sashimi they offerd , nice cut and fresh !
2015-02-13,1,I ordered a delivery three hours ago. And it is 10:15 I am still WAITING FOR THE ORDER!!! Three Hours passed. I do not know how is the food at restaurant. But now, I am totally disappointed by the extremely efficiency!!' I sware I wont order another one order from this Restaurant.
2015-02-10,5,Phenomenal restaurant with fast, friendly service, an immaculately clean, new room with trendy decor, and the freshest sushi I've had in Hoboken. They separate themselves with their commitment to quality and presentation.
2015-02-08,5,Very nice and cozy environment. The food is delicious with reasonable pricing. Definitely a recommended place to go for dinner or party. Planning on bringing my gf on valentines day there.
2015-02-07,5,Awesome new sushi place that is BYOB with some top notch fish. This place blew me away on all fronts - fresh fish, great rolls and delicious appetizers. The service and staff are friendly and there is a great ambiance.   I will definitely become a regular here.
2015-02-07,3,I ordered delivery from them yesterday evening.  The sushi was fine - not great but OK.  The delivery was fa st,  but the special instructions I set for a few of the rolls I ordered where completely ignored.
2015-02-06,4,So happy this place has opened!!!!I am so happy to have a new favorite sushi spot. Okinawa is affordable, BYOB, (hello!!!) and they have such fresh fish and give you large pieces of it in your sushi.Plus, for out of towners, there's a parking lot, which is unheard of in Hoboken. This is my new favorite place, for sure.
2015-02-06,5,I'm visiting my friend at hoboken, friend told me about this new place, and I was skeptical about this place meeting expectations but thankfully I was not disappointed at all, The food was great and I like the atmosphere, I will be coming back for sure !
2015-02-06,5,Been here twice now and love it. Food is great, kind and quick service and can't beat BYO. So happy it opened up!!
2015-02-05,5,Wow. I'm genuinely impressed. I've eaten sushi all over the places, and i usually don't write reviews, but this place is something different, I would rate this establishment as among the best. Very fresh, and generous portions. A decent selection of the rolls,  Service was great and overall ambiance is outstanding! This will be my "go to" for sushi in and around hoboken. As I said, genuinely impressed! definitely worth your try!
2015-02-05,5,Delivery on a Saturday night was quick and delicious!!! The sushi was fresh- i will absolutely order from here again!!!
2015-02-01,5,I am very happy that there is now another great sushi restaurant to order form in Hoboken.  My standard go-to sushi spot for delivery is Ayame, tonight I decided to give the new guy a shot.  I am so happy that I did.  They arrived quickly (on Superbowl Sunday); they are located downtown, I live uptown and my soup was still hot when it arrived.  The sushi was fresh and delicious.  This restaurant has officially been added to my list of delivery places in town.
2015-02-01,4,Located in the shopping center between Grand and Adams on Newark St., Okinawa is brand new to Hoboken. There's parking in the shopping center lot.  We really enjoyed our sushi and sashimi for 2.  My boyfriend and I do not like dragon rolls and one came with the dinner. We asked to swap it out for a tuna roll instead. At first the waiter was hesitant but then accommodated our request. The service, overall, was attentive. It's BYOB and good for small groups (no more than 4 for comfort). We really enjoyed our sushi and sashimi dinner. The sushi was fresh. My only dislike was the way the yellowtail sushi was cut. I can't explain it exactly but it was a more chewy part of the fish. It was still good, however, just different. The presentation was nice but nothing over the top. The prices were average as well. I will definitely be returning soon!
2015-02-01,4,Just opened, so take the service review with a grain of salt.Attentive wait staff, small location.  Can fit maybe 30 people there.  I got the Chicken Curry, which was nicely prepared.  Needs more rice than the single bowl, as you get a decent amount.  The curry was very good (Thai style curry).My wife got the sashimi deluxe, and it comes out in a nice presentation.  Nice large cuts, many pieces.  Fresh, and good.  Typical good sushi.Love the location (2 blocks from us), BYOB (there's a liquor store in the same plaza), and there's parking.  We hope it stays, and we will do our part to ensure it does!
2015-01-31,2,The sushi was just okay but I've had a lot better, even in Hoboken. The fish was not that fresh and the Yellow Dragon Roll didn't have much flavor. Delivery time was very fast.
2015-01-29,2,Well, we didn't get food poisoning, so that's worth 2 stars.....We had pretty high expectations given the other reviews of Okinawa. I wish someone would've said they are a Chinese restaurant. Or a Thai restaurant. Or anything else, but they are definitely not a Japanese restaurant. I don't like crossover food. If you have a focus, do that. But Chinese people do not know anything about sushi. You don't see Russians making tacos, and there's a reason for that.Anyway, when we got there, there were employees sleeping at one table. Hmmm....maybe should've left then?The lights were very bright, I thought I was at the tanning salon next door. The TV was on. I could've just stayed home if I wanted to watch the news. The server was nice, but we had to do the back and forth with our order a hundred times, still not sure if we were getting what we ordered. We (actually, I) spilled water everywhere, but no one noticed.OK, the sushi itself was a C-, Not sure how "fresh" it was. Tasted frozen. The mackerel was scary. The tamago was weird. Kind of chemical taste all the way around. Was that sushi rice or just plain white rice? Wait..wait for it... the kicker= HAIR IN OUR FOOD!!! NO WAY!!!And that's the end of our dining experience there folks. I tried to remain calm as the very nice manager comped our food so I could go outside and puke it back up.We took our sake and Sapporo to Robongi, where we were so thankful to have fresh, huge portions of the most amazing fish. We pretended Okinawa was all just a bad dream.
2015-01-29,4,Happy that there is finally a decent japanese place in hoboken (because all of the ones on Washington are overpriced and suck). The sushi was good and all the flavors in our hot dishes were great.-1 star for paying over $20 for a salmon teriyaki dinner and getting MAYBE 2 oz of fish. Luckily I ordered more food. Otherwise would definitely order again.
2015-01-28,5,So excited there is great sushi closer than Washington! Had the tuna don, Naruto roll, salmon don and the spicy girl (there were two of us). The spicy girl was amazing, even though I'm not usually a fan of anything that has crunch. The sashimi was super fresh and delicious. It is on par for quality with sushi lounge, but less expensive. The only thing I would have liked more would be if the Naruto roll had been served with a ponzu sauce. I will definitely be a regular here.
2015-01-28,5,I love Japanese and since I've moved to hoboken I have tried every sushi place and I always get the same thing and I'm ALWAYS dissappointed! Okinawa is by far the BEST! Great portions and if you're a kani salad lover like I am you WILL NOT be dissappointed! (PS if you get spicy it actually tastes spicy!) I loved that I was able to add spicy mayo on the side with my rolls! A lot of places don't give you that option! Love love love! Will go back again and again!
2015-01-27,5,It's great to see how well this new business is doing! The service was amazing, everyone was so attentive and professional. The decor was nice, the string lights were a bit intense but still cool. The food, was great! My partner loved the eel entree and I was hugely impressed by the vegetarian sushi entree! We shared the green tea ice cream with tempura banana and it was a great finish to a great meal!
2015-01-22,4,Had dinner here last night.  Definitely nicer than many of the other BYOB sushi places in the area.  The scallop sushi I had was super melt-in-your-mouth. seriously!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I do have to say the fish in the sushi chef's fish refrigerators was served a little cold.  The quality was good, but even during my last piece of my 20 piece sashimi platter, it was still *too* cold. Otherwise, service was a delight! Hubs had a few rolls which were also yum too. The fish was the star of the rolls - not the rice like some other places.
2015-01-20,5,This restaurant is great and reasonably priced! The waiters are very friendly and the service is wonderful. From what I've experienced, Okiwana Sushi & Grill outshines Sushi House on 1st Street by far!
2015-01-18,4,Great addition to the neighborhood. BYOB, Yes! Stopped in last night to order takeout with my husband and our one year old. The hostesses were super friendly, especially with our son. For Parents, they do have highchairs but no changing table in the bathroom. The decor is modern. There is a sushi bar that seats 8 or so and about 15-20 tables of 2 in the dining room.  Now for the important stuff like, the food...It was delicious! We had the Oki Roll and a few tuna avocado rolls (we kept it simple) The tuna was very fresh, they did not skimp out. The rice was soft and warm... You know, the way it should be. There are so many things we want to try on the menu that we are going back tonight for dinner. I really hope this isn't putting on the typical grand opening "front". I hope they can keep operating this way!
