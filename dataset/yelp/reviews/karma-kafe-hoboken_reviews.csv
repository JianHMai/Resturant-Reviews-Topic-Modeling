2021-11-07,5,never disappoints ! biryani, chicken tikka masala, kebabs are my go to. great portions too.
2021-11-06,3,The food is ok not that great. Have been here couple of times now the apps are good . If you want to try whole fish this could be one of the spots.
2021-10-30,4,I'm mostly impressed with the restaurant. The food all tastes good and is authentic or close to it. The mint and tamarind chutney are spot on. The Naan is an American version of it which is a little disappointing since all the other items they have seem authentic. I asked for a sample of their Dal Makhani but I was told they only sell full servings and no samples. Unfortunately eating alone it would be too much for an order and since I'm in a hotel it would be mostly wasted. This is a restaurant I would come back too which for me says a lot about it.
2021-10-28,5,Karma Kafe is an intimate dining spot specializing in Northern Indian cuisine. Located on Washington Street in Hoboken, it offers a varied selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian entrees. The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining. There's a full bar available with a complete lineup of all types and levels of spirits.My dining experience began with an excellent assortment of appetizers to chose from. I recently ordered the kabob sampler...an assortment of  chicken and lamb kabobs. There's also the baked chicken wings, juicy and delicious.  These are prepared in a delectable sauce. The karma Aloo is a vegetarian dish made with potatoes that was excellent. Also on the menu are vegetarian or Chicken Pakoras, very tasty and well prepared.The Ginger Coconut Chicken soup is a must to order. This soup will be one of the most tastiest you will probably ever have.I recently ordered the Tandoori Chicken. This is a full half chicken baked in a tandoor. An absolutely superb meal...tender and juicy...prepared with just enough spices and cooked to perfection.Also, the Chicken Makhani or Butter Chicken is simply the most delicious meal one could order.  Dark meat chicken pieces cooked in a butter tomato sauce. Absolutely delicious. One of the fish entrees offered is the Shrimp Malabar. Jumbo shrimp cooked in a Coconut sauce served with rice.  It really doesn't get any better!If hot and spicy is on your agenda its the Chicken Vindalo to order. Chicken and potatoes in a very fiery sauce.  A Goan specialty.I always order Naan bread.  This delicious bread compliments any of your selections.  You can chose from onion, garlic, plain, butter, or cheese.A great beverage choice is the Mango Lassi. It's sort of a smoothie.  It can be ordered with or without alcohol and is extremely popular.Traditional rice pudding is a great end of meal dessert.The staff is very well versed in the menu and the preparation of all that is offered. They are friendly and professional. Karma Kafe is definitely a great choice for delicious and well prepared and presented Indian cuisine. I will say..due to each dish being prepared to order...be prepared to enjoy the evening leisurely.Nothing is rushed!
2021-10-23,1,Food is okay but some staff members are exceptionally rude making it an overall quite bad experience. I will not recommend this restaurant and will rather recommend other Indian restaurants in the area.
2021-10-17,3,I've been ordering from this place for a while now, but I visited them this weekend to be disappointed with their unauthentic Chai and unexpected cheap Spring Mix in every dish.
2021-10-08,5,Really good Indian; will satisfy your Chicken Biryani craving! Their yogurt sauce is fresh, and cool, although I wish there was more per portion to match the rice dish. Perfectly spiced as well!
2021-10-07,5,All the food here is very good. Amazing flavors. Not Indian spice level but you can ask the dishes to be made spicy. I recommend the Malai Kofta and Palak Paneer
2021-10-04,4,Reunion went well with good food! It was a fine Sunday afternoon meeting with a couple of friends from school after a long time and food was important to keep the reunion alive and happening. So we chose this place, Karma cafe to meet. Starting with appetizers we ordered vegetable kebab and karma aloo. Both were delicious, specially loved the karma aloo. With the drinks we ordered sparkling wine, both white and red. It was perfect. In the main course we ordered malai kofta and bread platters. It was good but hoping for a better taste. Overall, the presentation and service was nice. Looking forward to try again other appetizers. Thank you for the good food.
2021-09-27,3,Food is good but their delivery is careless. At least 50% of the time there is something missing. Tonight it was my garlic naan, last time it was the rice, the time before was my soda. It's getting really annoying. I'm not sure it's worth ordering from them since by the time they bring the missing item, everything else is cold.
2021-09-01,5,Service was excellent. Food was amazing. Not only was it aesthetically pleasing to the eyes, it was as good tasting as it appeared. The portions was grand and filling. Food had the right amount of kick and heat. I love naan...theirs was fresh and tasty. Great place good food.
2021-09-01,4,As soon as you walk in your slapped in the face with the smell of Indian flavors and spices. We sat outside and I ordered the Bombay blues and my friend had the fresh watermelon juice. As described there was literally a splash if tonic. It was good and a little on the strong side. The watermelon juice was very refreshing and you could tell it was freshly made to order. I had the bagare shrimp and my friend ordered the Bhindi aloo with a side of naan. Both dishes came with basmati rice and dhal.  1.Papadum was served table side with 2 different sauces and a type of chutney. They were all good.2. Dahl - was good and was made with a bit of spice. I prefer mine to be a little spicier but it was still really good. It wasn't too chunky which I prefer.3. Basmati rice- I feel as if the rice was strained because there was a loss of starch in the rice. It was good but not great.4. Bagare shrimp was good. After a while it felt like too much tomato. I must say they gave a lot of shrimp. No complaints on this end.5. Bhindi aloo- this dish had the same flavors as the shrimp but without the shrimp. Do not order this if you don't like okra. The okra was cooked well not over or under cooked.6. Naan - was super good. It was made to perfection. Soft with a nice crisp. Not to doughy. So good we ordered another round.The staff was great and so was the food.  I will tell you to beware these spices will permeate through your body, if you know what I mean.
2021-08-30,5,I ordered Paneer Kashmiri from here the other night and it was so delicious! It was creamy with a little spice and the fruit and nuts made it so sweet and savory. I finished the meal off with Ras Malai which was also very good. The best Indian food I've had in along time. I live outside Hoboken and was happy that UberEats was able to deliver this to me otherwise I would be missing out!
2021-08-25,5,Amazing food. Back in 2015 when I was a student at a nearby college, used to frequent this place with friends. I recently moved back to the area recently and have been ordering takeout quite often. Their food is amazing. I cannot recommend any particular item because everything we have ordered so far from their veg curries to some mouth watering appetizers, it's been such a treat. One thing I definitely want to point is that unlike a lot of Indian restaurants, they are one of the rare ones who manage to keep their quality and flavors consistently good. So kudos to the team (especially the kitchen) for that. With that, let me get back to the veg biryani I just ordered :)
2021-08-24,4,Loved this place.  Ordered from here last night.  Had the lamb biryani which was spicy and very tasty.  Such a large portion for the lamb! The garlic chili naan is very good too! Mouthwatering!! Unfortunately I can't give this place five stars, I can't say that I am happy about the chicken tikka masala.  For $16 they give you a small pint which looks like a lunch special portion.  It's tasty but way overpriced for the size! Only a few small pieces of chicken and a lot of sauce! Why?!! Overall, love this place but they could do a lot better with the portion size for the chicken tikka.  The picture that I attached was a little too late to show all the pieces of chicken but it does show the container that it comes in!
2021-08-06,5,I always heard karma Kafe was good but it took me too long to order from here. Got take out last week and is was all delicious. We got garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, & the best mango lassi I've ever had. Will definitely be ordering again.
2021-07-30,4,Good food, reasonably priced. Have a great lunch special. The garlic Naan is amazing.
2021-07-19,5,I always love going here for Indian food! I usually order the chicken tikka masala that has a fairly mild spicy level and is also very flavorful and delicious. I love ordering it alongside their garlic naan which is also very tasty!Their watermelon juice is refreshing and chai is delicate. A great place to go if you're craving Indian cuisine!
2021-07-05,1,The usual dip the meat/veggie in basic orange curry and have exotic names around it only to be disappointed with its inauthentic Indian taste. Will go back for their papdi chat which was pretty good but the curries are SO SO disappointing.
2021-07-03,3,Food was okay. The aloo paratha was more like a tandoori kulcha. The chats were again ok- papdi chat was better than bhel. Expected much much more.
2021-06-24,5,Chicken Biryani is a must try, specially if you love the Punjabi and Mughali way. The portions are good. The interiors make it a perfect ambience.
2021-06-23,4,The lamb achari was very good, with a great curry sauce and tasty pieces of Indian pickle. The pieces of lamb were all really tender.The chicken malabar was tasty with a unique spice profile, though the chicken is a bit dry due to being breast meat rather than thigh.Overall, spice levels here are calibrated on the low end so definitely go for the spiciest setting available when ordering.
2021-06-09,5,Best indian food hands down in north nj area.I am a big fan of their kebab platter, salmon fish and mughlai style curry dishes. Highly recommend this place.
2021-06-07,1,Karma is trash now, the 600+ reviews must be from years ago when it was actually very good. They were closed for a while due to a fire and after that it's been very bad. I used to love this place but now my paneer makhani tasted like pasta sauce with heavy cream and it was soooo bad! Ordered garlic naan, and they gave regular butter naan; not a huge deal but still! The daal which comes with the entree also changed and is a watered down version of what daal should be.....I hate leaving bad reviews especially during COVID but it's NOT like they're giving away free food. You can see my review from 2016 which was a raving 5 star review so clearly things have changed significantly for the worse!! For premium price indian food, I expect much better all around including service!
2021-06-01,5,So delicious! The portions are generous and everything I've ever ordered has been heaven!
2021-05-18,5,If you love authentic Indian food this is the place to go. Great vegetarian and gluten-free option.
2021-05-09,5,This place is great. Portion is great. Appetizer is good and entree is also good. It is not pricey. Reasonable price with unlimited chips and good food!
2021-05-07,4,Ordered the lamb korma through Uber Eats, while the amount of meat they give you is solid, the flavors are not all there. The lamb seems to be cooked by itself and then used with the different sauces. The garlic naan was a little burnt and stiff. I'm giving 4 stars on the amount of lamb alone. Will give it another try.
2021-04-25,5,Great spot. 1) For lamb dishes: try the lamb korma, lamb bhuna, and lamb vindaloo.2) For the chicken dishes: try the chicken tikka masala, chicken Malabar and chicken Kashmiri.3) For the bread: try the karma naan and aloo paratha. Will for sure come again.
2021-04-10,3,It was easy to get a table on weekday for dinner. We got the Chicken Madras, which we assumed would be Chettinad style but it wasn't. I have never had a South Indian chicken curry which was so devoid of salt and spice, it was almost sweet. Lamb biryani was okay, it's one of the regular restaurant style ones where biryani rice is cooked separately from meat- doesn't really make for a gastronomical delight that a biryani usually is. Decent wine menu. Service was quick and efficient.
2021-04-06,4,We ordered vegetable biryani, naan and curry after seeing the reviews here on a Friday night. Delivery was very quick and food was good. It's not the best biryani but it's a nice vegetable rice and quantity is very huge. Their naan was super soft and we got vegetable jalfrezi which had lot of vegetables, it was spicy, not too oily and delicious. The curry came with jeera rice and dal. I would like to try panner and other dishes from their menu.
2021-04-01,4,First time ordering and it won't be the last! Ordered a Palak lamb lunch special. It doesn't photograph well, but the lamb was tender and the palak tasty! Could have used a bit more seasoning, but I would still order it again! Added naan for $2.00 and I got this huge naan right out of the tandoor! Looking forward to ordering again and checking out their lunch buffet in the future!
2021-03-31,4,This spot is good for Indian food in that area Their food is good but we Indian like little spicy so it was mild for us but definitely next time we ask them to make it super spicy :p
2021-03-25,5,We moved to Hoboken a few months ago and have walked past Karma so many times ( it was always busy ) Tonight we were lucky enough to get a table so we tried it out !!The service was a little slow to start , then we realized they had so many take out orders that all the staff were busy, however when we did get our waiters attention the service was excellent, the food came in good time , hot and well prepared, ( there was so much we have a doggy bag ) One of the best places we have been to since we moved  here  !!
2021-02-14,5,After spending long hours outdoor in the cold, I sometimes rely on Karma cafe! Their deliveries are very quick, always hot, delicious and large sized.
2021-02-07,5,When I'm not in Hoboken, this is the only thing I want. Their chicken tikka masala is top tier. It's not a matter of if you're getting the bread basket, it's if four gigantic naan will even be enough. The veggie samosas are in my dreams. Half of my roommate group chat is just "Karma? "
2021-02-05,5,Tried the Biryani here and was the best I have eaten in this country. The chicken is nicely cooked and marinated
2021-01-30,2,Too hot! My wife and I have had wonderful food from Karma Cafe, but the last time we ordered the lamb in spinach sauce, and I ordered the curry chicken. The lamb was extremely hot, and the curry chicken was out of this world hot--too hot to eat. After I took a few bites my lips were on fire. We frankly threw the food out as too hot to eat. I expect Indian food to be spicy, but this was just too spicy!So if it say "spicy," be forewarned--that means really, really hot! There was no warning about the curry chicken, which was way too hot to eat. Maybe we ordered the wrong things, so if we order again we will look for "mild" dishes, if there is another order.
2021-01-26,5,Craving Indian food, we were so happy to stumble upon this little place. We are from the west coast and our daughter is a freshman at a local college. Hoboken is such a cute little town. Anyway, they gave the best naan I've ever had! I'm not even a bread kind of girl. The tikka masala is very flavorful and our usual must have. We also enjoy the saag paneer, korma, shrimp malabar, different biryanis and veggie samosas. All delicious! We look forward to dining here whenever we are in town!
2021-01-23,5,Fact check. "Josh B. is so fanatical that he remembers details about buffets from 15 years ago." Answer: partially true. While his recollections of buffets are far above statistical norms, they can be inexact. For example, he can generally recall the highlights of long-ago buffet visits, but is unclear on details such as whether soda was included.It's been far too long since I went to Karma Kafe. Remember when buffets existed? Sigh. But life goes on. Weekend nights are for getting wild and crazy, i.e., spending a long time reading Uber Eats.Many places have tandoori chicken, but I don't know many that specialize in it. Karma Kafe was the only one I found where it appeared in the Yelp top three items. It was exemplary, with just the right amount of char and more spice than usual. The papri chaat is also recommended, with plenty of flavor even before you add the outstanding green and tamarind chutneys.
2021-01-17,4,Having tried numerous Indian restaurants in  Hoboken and the surrounding areas I have been underwhelmed. Tonight I decided to try Karma Kafe and wow! I ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken biryani. The biryani was really terrific, perfect blend of spices and aromatics with huge pieces of chicken. I don't usually like raita and even that was awesome. The tikka masala was very good as well, really enjoyed everything! I am a big eater and have enough leftovers for another 2-3 meals at least. Karma Kafe offers great quality and value, highly recommended.
2021-01-17,5,Awesome vegan options and super cute seating. I personally never really eat Indian food so this was all new food to me, but the man working was really helpful and nice! The deserts were also so good I got one of each The area is also really cute to walk through, especially since parking is impossible in Hoboken. Overall so cute.
2021-01-14,5,Oh my goodness! Karma Kafe, you're amazing! I visited once before about 8-9 years ago for the lunch buffet and it left a great impression. Decided to order delivery a few nights ago extremely skeptical since it has been a while but I was literally floored. I had the chicken tikka masala and veggie samosas and they were perfect in taste, quality and portion size. I can't wait to try more items! Also, I hadn't noticed that I placed my order a tad bit late, maybe half an hour before they were to close and they threw in an additional samosa at no cost! Was probably just gonna go to waste but a wonderful gesture anyway. Thank you!
2021-01-13,5,A very favorite restaurant of ours in Hoboken. Introduced two year old Brandin to Indian food here. Used to go for buffet lunch, but in changed times, we ordered inline. Delivery was fast, shorter than expected. Nan, dal, lamb korma, chicken biryani, saag, are among our favorites. The vegetable samosa, too. Can't go wrong. We'll keep ordering until we can go back. Highly recommended.
2021-01-11,4,A rainy day outing brought to you by Karma Kafe!Good word of mouth had us looking this place up on our search for some solid Indian food nomming - with the weather wet and cold a hot meal was necessary! We called ahead asking what COVID restrictions they had in place and what their terms were for reservations/ dine in inquiries. We were told that they would be able to seat us inside whenever we arrived and that promise was more than enough to convince us to go here haha.  An unsuspecting place from the outside - it's more long than wide when stepping inside. The full bar is tucked away in the back. We sat in the more inside corner to keep away from the chill of the entry door opening and closing. The main middle area was blocked off from seating and was used as a touch point for all the take out orders being picked up by different delivery services. This effectively organized the flow of dine in and take out traffic - the middle being purposefully cleared and the dining patrons seated on the perimeter - smart! Once seated, our waiter had our water glasses ready and were served complimentary papad to begin the meal! Our waiter took down our app and drink orders in quick order after answering a few questions we had about some of the items. We ordered the bhel puri to start - very tasty. We asked for the tamarind on the side and the staff were great in accommodating that request. For our party of three we ordered two entrees to share - the paneer makhani and the chole palak. Each dish came with daal and rice on the side and we ordered a helping of garlic naan. The food was very flavorful and not too oily. I liked the chole palak a lot and the spice level wasn't over powering but definitely tingled my taste buds. The wait staff were great in checking in on us and quick with clearing dishes as items were finished off. We did have some leftovers so they gave us some takeaway containers and per their guidelines asked us to pack up (totally understandable because COVID.) Overall great experience and didn't find it overall expensive given the amount of dishes and drinks we ordered. Happy to be back soon!
2021-01-05,4,Made our way over here on a Friday evening for dinner time. Still plenty of seating available with most of the restaurant set up for getting deliveries out as quickly as possible.Menu consists of several categories with lots of options in each. Ordered the Bhuna Mutton ($18) to go along with a 'Mangotini' ($11?). Before the food arrived, they serve you some free papas and side chutneys. Sauces actually tasted fresh, and the papad is easy to eat (good alongside the strong cocktail). Mutton comes out shortly after - a bowl of rich curry and several large chunks of goat; served with rice, greens, and sambar. Liked the flavor of the goat, albeit a bit chewy, rice and sambar definitely helped. Greens were an afterthought on the plate.Cool place for Indian food on the street; service is quick and they seem like a solid place for delivery as well.
2020-12-10,5,Yummmyyy! They give a very generously portioned lunch box special. I had the chicken tikka masala and it was delicious! Can't wait to try out more menu items.
2020-12-05,5,One of the best Indian food I've ever had! Can't stop coming back here. Their samosas are the bomb.
2020-11-13,5,Consistently amazing Indian food!! I'm no expert on this cuisine, but I've eaten at a few different Indian restaurants in the area and I always find myself wanting Karma. The staff is so nice and friendly as well! Highly recommend
2020-10-21,5,I was never really a fan of Indian food until I decided to try Karma Kafe. Their samosas (which are huge and fried perfectly), chicken tikka caesar salad and tandoori shrimp are delicious. I now order from here regularly. Quality is always great!
2020-10-19,1,We got food delivered from this place. I understand if the bread gets cold and not so soft in the way of delivery but what about the curry. Paneer curry seemed like sweet fish, it was so sweet and had a weird taste. Fish curry was supposed to be cooked in coconut but I could barely taste any presence of coconut. Samosa chat was the only item worth eating of all the items we had ordered. Chicken was not cooked properly hence difficult to chew.
2020-10-18,4,First time trying out this place, would definitely recommend, and will be back.We had a naan basket, kofta and chicken poppers. The portions were out of this world, I couldn't believe it, each plate is enough for two and you still have left overs. The food was good and tasty, in my opinion everything could have used a bit more salt, but not a deal breaker. I wish they had real masala chai, rather than what they are offering which is just tea with milk on the side (girl please -_-)Overall, good choice for your buck, hard to find places like these in Hoboken. And flavors are okay.
2020-10-11,1,Very sad experience. Ordered Bhuna mutton at 9.45pmIf something over its over.Sad that they sent scraps of meat n a lot of ginger garlic gravy.
2020-10-08,5,Literally everything I've ever gotten from here has been AMAZING. I'm always so full afterwards because I cannot stop eating. Some things that I highly recommend...chicken tikka masala, tilapia malabar, and chicken saag. The garlic naan!! The chicken ginger soup!!!!! The samosas!! But truly everything I've had has been absolutely FIRE!!!!!!
2020-09-29,5,I order food regularly from Karma Kafe and have never had a bad experience. My favorite is their dal makhani. I've tried this dish at a lot of Indian restaurants in JC/Hoboken and theirs is simply the best. Other curries are good as well. Palak paneer, chicken makhani and bhuna mutton are my go-to dishes. Their roasted garlic naan is soft, delicious and HUGE. I highly recommend it. All entrees come with rice and dal (a complete Indian meal) which I appreciate. Appetizers are good too but they could have had a more varied collection. In all, I love their food and the slightly modernized approach to Indian cuisine. If you're looking for a fix of hearty Indian food, Karma Kafe would not disappoint.
2020-09-24,2,I've eaten here twice. The first time I ordered vegetable malai kofta eating in the restaurant. Service was good. The food was bland, totally lacking in flavor. The second time I ordered bhindi aloo and garlic naan. The garlic naan was very good and the garlic flavor came thru and looks like fresh garlic was used. The bhindi aloo was totally lacking in flavor and I was disappointed. Perhaps the meat or seafood dishes are better. Ordering vegetarian at this restaurant has left me disappointed both times due to lack of flavor, basic flavors.
2020-09-22,4,We get take out about once a month and it never disappoints. We usually do delivery and get the food within an hour. We've tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Curry, Samosa, and a few other dishes. The entrees are flavorful and I love how they come with rice and dal. The garlic naan is so good. I wish they had rogan josh in the menu.
2020-09-14,5,Karma Kafe is the only place in Hoboken worth anything. Always great food, never compromising on the flavor. keep it spicy my friends.
2020-09-12,3,Not bad, but the Chicken Korma is better at A Touch of Spice in Weehawken. Chicken was a little tough. The naan didn't have any raisins in it...The veggie assortment from the starter menu was a little greasy. All in all, it was OK.
2020-09-01,1,I've been really disappointed in this place for a while now.  The food hasn't been great, but they have also been very lax about taking safety precautions during COVID.  The last several times I have been here the vast majority of the employees - both in the front and the ones I can see in the kitchen - haven't been wearing their masks.  Most of them keep it around their chin.  I'm done with restaurants that don't care about the safety of their customers.  It's made easier by the fact that the food hasn't been very good lately either.
2020-08-22,5,Love them!! Great, fresh food, I don't go anywhere else.m for veggie korma. I definitely recommend it
2020-08-09,5,Excellent flavors and portions. Thank God they are open during COVID.Always order a side of the Samoas.
2020-08-08,4,Love this place for indian, been a customer for years. The chicken tikka masala is authentic!!!
2020-08-07,5,The food was very good and good service. Dining was outside in open air.I am not very familiar with all the Indian food dishes but the next time I eat here I will try the goat!
2020-08-05,3,Karma Kafe is a popular Indian restaurant located in Hoboken. It is extremely popular in the neighborhood and we planned on going there for lunch before COVID-19. Thus once everything opened, this was one of the first places we decided to order fromPaneer Kashmiri: we chose this option as we wanted two completely different entree options.  Kashmiri curries are supposed to babe saffron and lots of raisins and cashews which make them creamy and sweet. We enjoyed the curry but were disappointed with huge chunks of potatoes in it. The curry was sweet but the huge cherry on top and big pieces of potato were not a delight to eatVegetable jalfrezi: vegetable jalfrezi is assorted veggies in brown curry. This was spicy (not super spicy) and tasted well. It had peas, cauliflower, cilantro, peppers, carrots, tomatoes and potatoes. It tasted well but was super oilyPeshawari naan: peshawari naan is an all purpose flour flatbread with raisins and nuts. This goes well with a spicy curry. It was huge. Much larger than the usual serve and could taste the dry fruits in every bite.Whole wheat roti: I was surprised with the portion size of the whole wheat flat bread. It was huge. This is for health lovers. Plain simple flatbread. It exemplifies the taste of the curriesAll the entrees come with a side of dal and rice. Rice is plain simple rice which can go with any curry. Our guess is it is made of yellow split beans. It was slightly watery for our taste and avoided it all together. All together, we liked the food. The quantity was decent. Slightly pricey. They could avoid serving the dal and provide more finely chopped veggies in the curry.
2020-07-24,5,Love love love. Delish food, nice customer service and they do not skimp out on portions, which is greatly appreciated. Most Indian restaurants skimp out, esp. in the cities.
2020-07-20,5,Karma Kafe is the best! Paneer Palak is my favorite. The flavors are consistently delicious and the service is incredible.
2020-07-12,2,Somebody please tell the chef cumin and green peas aren't the only ingredients available. I think they could have done great justice to the food but the the spice type of this place for Indian food is just plain weird. I can judge because born and brought up in Indian household eating curries so kinda know what curry should taste like. Lol! I would give it a miss if you are looking for authentic Indian food.
2020-07-09,4,It had been a while since I ate at Karma Kafe and I had a craving for Indian so decided to order delivery before they reopened for outdoor dining.  I got two meals so I could have leftovers and try multiple things.  I got a classic, the chicken tiki marsala and a vegetarian dish, Aloo Chloe (chick peas & potatoes in curry).  I also got garlic naan.  I ordered ahead and scheduled my delivery time and the food came right on time.  Everything was warm and packaged nicely.  Great portion sizes.  Both dishes had a good kick to them.  I was very pleased with the food.  It's a shame that because of covid they can no longer do their lunch buffet.  Was such a bargain and always really good food.
2020-07-05,5,I love this place.  Whether its for pickup, delivery or dining in, the service and quality are always consistently perfect!  This is a local Hoboken indian restaurant right on Washington St, that i've been going to for at least 9 years!
2020-07-02,4,We decided to take a chance on the Karma Kafe in Hoboken at the  recommendation of Olive's friend Olivia last night. It took a while for the delivery to come. We tried watching Ghost Adventures while we waited, but it just wasn't the vibe.     After an hour and 20 minutes, I called the restaurant to check on my order. The man was friendly and Olive recognized the music as "Jupiter" from Gustav Holst's "The Planets", as she had played in her high school concert band. Very shortly after being put on hold, we heard a knock on the door. Ain't that just the way...    I looked down at my phone and then back up at the door. Rudely, I hung up on the restaurant and stumbled to the door. A nice young fella was on the other side and told me I owed $5.33. I was like 'huh?' And then he reminded me that I had ordered the Poori in my comments section for my order of naan. "Oh yeah! hold on", I said, grabbed my wallet, and shuffled around with the cash inside. I asked the young man if he had change for a twenty and then subsequently turned around and asked Olive if she had any change. She went to the other room and by the time she had returned with a $10 bill I had already sorted out the exact change. We easily could have just given him the change from the 10 as an extra tip but I had already tipped online and in hindsight I should have just given the dude the extra tip. Next time...     On a side note, the past 2 times we've ordered delivery; once from here, and once from Mario's, the delivery dude has managed to get in the coded front door of our building and up to our apartment door. Gotta get to the bottom of that...    Anyways the food was pretty darn good, all things considered. An inventive take on Indian food compared to what I've had in the past. We ordered the crispy desi fish, the samosa chaat, the gingery coconut chicken soup, the garlic naan and poori bread, the paneer kashmiri, and a side of tikka masala sauce. Definitely ordered too much. The portions were huge and we quickly stuffed ourselves to the brim in a matter of minutes.     The fish was great; I've only ever seen fish like this at my favorite Indian spot Kumari in Baltimore. If only it wasn't delivery; it lost a lot of its crispiness sitting in the takeout box. The honey mustard sauce that came with it wasn't bad either. The samosa chat was essentially like veggie samosa nachos. Definitely enough for 4 people to share as an appetizer; bright, refreshing taste as well. The samosas kind of fell apart underneath all the wet toppings and chutney, but the taste was really nice. I would honestly order from here again just to get the soup. A mellow, tangy, creamy broth with huge chunks of tender tandoori chicken, cilantro, and whole slivers of ginger. I've never had a soup like that before. Another surprising dish was the paneer kashmiri. I love paneer dishes and I've never had one in this style before. The sauce was saffron-y and creamy; just a bit of spice. There were peas, cauliflower, raisins and pears in the sauce which created a great savory/sweet balance in the dish.     Unfortunately, the paneer tasted a little off to me; Olive didn't have a problem with it. I kept getting this almost plastic-y taste from it which she thought was just a nutty flavor. Anyways, both breads were quite good and the tikka masala sauce was nice as well. If I had not had an issue with the paneer, I would consider this one of the most pleasant Indian meals I've had in a while.    I think with Indian food, there's endless possibilities and subtleties with how the food can be prepared and seasoned. This wasn't the best I've had, but it certainly wasn't the worst. After we ate the food, I had some evil liquid poop bombs and then fell asleep on the couch for about 45 minutes. Classic Indian food. Then we took a walk, came back, I smoked a weed and ate some of the room temperature leftover food and it was even better than before. Then Olive fell asleep on the couch while I watched like 4 episodes of The IT Crowd. All in all, a good night.     Can't wait for COVID-19 to be over so I can try the buffet! P.S.     Sorry about the lack of photos; I didn't even think to write this review until after I finished eating. I included a picture of my leftovers in the fridge though. B^)
2020-07-01,5,Great food, delivery is always on time. We usually get the paneer makhni, garlic naan and samosas - all great!
2020-06-28,5,Probably one of the best North Indian restaurants around even with journal sq around the corner nothing hits the way karma Kafe does. It was closed for a few months because of a fire a year or 2 ago and I remember that's when I really realized how good this place really is. I normally get the black lentils it reminds me of my mom's the butter chicken and palak paneer is another few go to dishes. *enjoy*
2020-06-25,5,Excellent food.   Portion size is good.  Wait Staff, the best.  Very attentive and friendly.   Sonny is the best.
2020-06-20,4,Delicious tikka masala, garlic naan, daal, rice and samosas. Everything I ordered was fresh, warm, spices were great and portion size was good. The food was ready in 20 mins for pickup and we paid over the phone due to COVID precautions. We'll be back for authentic Indian food!
2020-06-15,5,This is my new go-to for Indian food! I dined in once and the food, service, and ambience were all great. We've been ordering in during this pandemic and Karma Kafe has been consistently on point! I loveeeee the masala mozz naan - it's genius. I always get the dal makhani and it's always cooked to perfection. What I love about Karma Kafe is that it reminds me of homemade food - it's not heavy as most Indian restaurant food can be and it's also packed with the right amount of spice and flavor. Their complimentary side portions of rice and dal are also well portioned and delicious. I will continue ordering from here and can't wait to dine outside soon!!
2020-06-12,5,The best Indian food in all of NJ and NY. Frankly, it's better than the food I had in India. Perfect every time and insanely delicious. Hands down the best restaurant in Hoboken all around.
2020-06-08,1,Honestly, the worst Indian food I've had in memory...We ordered the vegetable Samosas, molai kofta, eggplant dish, garlic naan, and soup.     Well, when I bit into the Samosa I got the instant impression of "old"..like really old, stale and like it had been heated and refrigerated multiple times.  The inside was filled with a dry flavorless grey grandular substance, that upon later consideration "might" have been "chicken" at some point, although my visceral reaction was that it seemed like cat food.  They forgot the Molai Kofta, so I guess I dodged a bullet there. They did however charge me for the non-existent Molai Kofta.The "eggplant dish" that we ordered was not there either , but a dish we thought was the eggplant turned out to be more fricking chicken.  We are vegetarian, so we couldn't eat it, but the bite we had was not great tasting either, so I guess no big loss.The garlic naan was actually good, I will give them that..So out of a $50 dinner order, I was able to eat one half (my bf got the other half) of a $2 piece of bread.We threw it all in the trash (except the naan) and ordered 2nd dinner from Touch of Spice instead.I hope that "Karma" bites this place...because it was incredibly bad on all levels...
2020-06-03,4,This is our go-to spot for deliveries. We have never been to the actual restaurant, but we have ordered from Karma Safe several times during and before the pandemic. With Indian food we are quite conservative, and once we have found our favorite orders, we have never really changed them.  We always get naan, paneer palak, chicken malabar, and we have tried also the kormas - food is always delivered on time, correct and warm. Also, portions are fairly big and for a good price.We can recommend it for deliveries.
2020-06-03,5,I ordered takeout from Karma Kafe. My order was ready on time. In terms of set up, they only allow 3 people inside and have booths set up (takeout, order, etc). Each entree comes with rice and dal. I got the kashmiri paneer, vegetable jalfrazzi, and palak paneer, as well as 2 pieces of garlic naan. The naan was big, fluffy, and deliciously garlicky. The kashmiri paneer is my favorite from there. It was a good spice and has a delectable saffron flavor. Their paneer is one of the softest I have ever had. It almost just melts in your mouth as you eat it. I definitely enjoy the food from here
2020-05-23,5,Biggest criticism here is the nan. 4 dollars for a single piece of nan is ridiculous. We can buy a pack of like 20 for that just down the street. That out of the way. We have been very happy with the dishes from here. They come Spicy and full of flavor. We prefer lamb vindaloo and chicken tika but have tried several others and all were up to snuff. Worth an order in if you are itching for some Indian food.
2020-05-23,5,Food is always great here, and portion sizes are huge! So happy that they opened back up for takeout during the pandemic.
2020-05-23,5,We got delivery from here during the pandemic. Food arrived on time, and was delicious. We especially loved the Bagare Shrimp!
2020-05-05,5,I was looking for a good Indian place and this place has hit the spot! The Chicken Marsala was really good, full of flavor and the portion was pretty big! We also had the chicken vindaloo. It was spicier than I thought but it was good! I wish that it had a little more flavor but overall it was good! We also had the kebab sampler and that was really good! You got to try three types of meat and style. We also ordered the saffron pistachio ice cream. I'm not sure if they gave me the right one because the color was yellow like their mango ice cream.. but regardless, the ice cream was SOOO good!! It was so creamy! Definitely getting the ice cream again!!!!
2020-05-02,5,This place over the years has just gotten better. It was  alway good .. but now feels like an  oasis in a time of food blahs. Great take out too in this weirdo time of pandemic isolation. Look forward to on location sit down reopening once this virus voodoo goes away! Support local especially when it's this good!
2020-03-21,5,Helped me with a delivery problem last night. I appreciated them explaining to me that as buildings aren't letting drivers inside, there are higher levels of delay than usual.
2020-02-29,5,Very solid Indian food and the best in Hoboken. Garlic naan is amazing! Chicken a little dry in chicken tika masala, but you can't have everything. We also ordered delivery through Karma directly and it is always on time and hot. Definitely recommend!
2020-02-16,4,I'll preface by saying that I don't eat a ton of Indian food, so I may not know what "good" or "authentic" Indian food tastes like. That said, this has become one of my go-to delivery places. The lamb korma is solid af. The veggie samosas are so. freakin. good.
2020-02-15,5,Serves good quality, delicious Indian food. Quantities are more than generous. Welcoming atmosphere and courteous staff.
2020-02-15,5,Simply the BEST Indian restaurant in all metro area!I love Indian food but most restaurant to the food is spicy to the point that it overwhelms the flavors of the good.I had to come to work to Hoboken in New Jersey I'm at lunch time I search for an Indian place and I found karma Cafe. It is conveniently located three blocks away from the EY building. A lunchtime they offer buffet menú.The food is outstanding. The most important thing is that the food is not spicy at all, so you can taste the flavors of the rich tasty Indian food.My all-time favorite is the chicken tikka masala, and karma Cafe makes one out of this world. it is so tasty, so fresh, and the chicken is so tender that you feel like eating and eating and eating without stopping.The rest of the food vegetarian or not is also amazing.For the Stars they don't have too many options that they have rice pudding. I have to say that. Rice pudding has been one of the best ones I have tasted in an Indian restaurant.I eat lunch at karma Cafe every time I have  to work to Hoboken. I am basically addicted to this restaurant. The price is excellent .
2020-02-06,5,This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken and my favorite Indian food I've ever had. I get the takeout and it's always hot and fast. And I love dining in too!! The food is outstanding, no matter what I get and the people are always so friendly.
2020-01-28,5,I'm so glad karma is in the neighborhood! Their food is always tasty and they are reliably open! Staff is really efficient and thoughtful. I don't know why it took me so long to write a review since I've been coming here for a few years. Definitely recommend trying then at lunch!
2020-01-26,5,Really great restaurant from the buffet to the dining menu.The service has always been spot on for me.
2020-01-23,5,Amazing food! The buffet is such a steal and probably one of the best I've ever had. It's always fresh and well put together. The service is always great. Hands down one of the best Indian restaurants in NY/NJ area.
2020-01-20,1,I had buffet. I would say if you are vegetarian like me then i would not recommend buffet and in general vegetarian menu. Not much options and not that great either in my experience.If you are non-vegetarian, then i heard from my friends its overall fine. You can try it for non-vegetarian food.
2020-01-18,4,My last update was from 2012. I stand by what I originally wrote. Delivery has gotten better. I use Seamless and it isn't as bad as it used to be. It is still relatively expensive. But, in fairness, it is the best in town. I order Lamb Vindaloo (Lamb and potatoes in a spicy vindaloo sauce), which has a spicy kick. Lamb Korma (Lamb cubes in a mild cashew nut herb sauce), which is savory and delicious. I still order my beloved popcorn crawfish. Also sometimes get the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is really good. Also the Tandoori Chicken is very tasty and never dry. Their Samosa are large and fluffy - I can't get enough. I really like their naan. Their only "miss" is the Lamb Biryani. It's not terrible, but I have had better. Not flavorful enough.Otherwise, I feel like I should update my review from 3 stars to 4 stars. I order from here at least once a month since my review 7 years ago.
2020-01-08,4,A small but very charming/cozy place with great food.  I came here with a friend and my gosh, do they serve a lot of food?  Well, to me seemed like a lot and it was very tasty too.  We ordered paneer, tandoori fish, and garlic butter naan.  The naan was gigantic and delicious, I love the taste of garlic and butter on my naan, I enjoyed every single bite of it.  Our table was very small though, we ordered around 3 dishes and we barely had any space, that's why we didn't order any other drinks to try because there was no space at all.  I enjoyed the place, the service was excellent, the paneer tasted REALLY good, the fish, the appetizers (don't remember the name).  I would definitely go back to try the drinks!
2020-01-02,1,Really bad. Haven't ordered here in a while and don't plan to ever again after today. Food was tasteless. This place used to care about quality and taste. Not sure what's happened but the chicken tikka and tandoor paneer w veggies I got just didn't taste that good. Never again.
2019-12-28,4,Dal makhani was great. Paneer makhani was okay. Sweet lassi was awesome. The ambience was also not bad. Definitely one of the better Indian options in New York/New Jersey.
2019-12-28,5,We ate dinner here in the evening, when there is waiter service at the tables (not a buffet).  The food we had was delicious, the service was good, and the décor is nice.  When we arrived at 6:00 p.m., we were the first ones in the restaurant; it filled up, however, and by the time we left, every table was occupied.  I would highly recommend Karma Kafe for a good Indian meal.
2019-12-27,5,Popular spot for Korean food. You're gonna love it  get the kale salad! You can only eat here if you're a ginger.
2019-12-24,4,I frequently order delivery from this place and out of all the Jersey City restaurants, this is the only one I remotely enjoy. The food is well cooked (not over or under) and they have a decent amount of vegetarian options. The roti's are not humungous and are good for 1 meal. I've tried the tandoori platter, samosas, kofta, pudina paratha, kadhi, kachumber salad, karma aloo and enjoyed most of them. The aloo (potatoes) were a tad under cooked. The samosa's are my favorite in the area. I give it 4 stars (despite not knowing how the service or cleanliness is) as the food doesnt make me feel heavy or sick, the packaging is mostly reusable and minimal. The chutney's also have a good flavor. Would probably update once I try in person but till now it has been a good experience.
2019-12-23,1,I ordered karma Cafe basket of bread and it had plastic remain in it. I would never recommend this place for being untidy
2019-12-23,4,In a previous review when I ordered "takeaway" I said that I never expected to dine in at Karma Kafe -- well, I was wrong. Last night we walked over to the restaurant and enjoyed another tasty meal, this time on site.I really cannot add much about the food. Everything I ordered was authentic and flavorful. One could nit pick the details (the dishes were not completely flawless -- for example: some of the papadum were a tad burnt and I'd prefer a bit more sauce for the samosas) but rather than dwell on a few small errors I'll just say I enjoyed my meal "eating in" as much as I enjoyed eating "takeaway."Karma's atmosphere is totally "Indian" without going over the top to "kitschy" and the service was efficient and friendly. As we departed every employee we passed thanked us for our patronage. All in all, for us, it was a great experience and I can recommend both takeaway and dining in.
2019-12-22,3,Karma Kafe is a small Indian bistro in Hoboken. The food here is usually good, so here's a quick review.The portions are generous as per the price. It's usually very crowded on weekends as any other popular restaurant would be on Washington street.We ordered the Special for today - Tandoori Fish- it's tandoor grilled fish marinated in herbs and Indian spices! Really good entree, comes with a side of rice and dal (dal is surely disappointing, no salt and lacks flavor) maybe because it's 'on the side' . I give it a 4/5 and I liked it the most !Also ordered the chicken saag along with garlic naan. The naan is huge so we had to wrap up some and take it home. The saag is very simple and not very fancy. Again the side dal was absolutely a minus to the whole platter. I give this 3/5Mango mojito (non- alcoholic) was good with adequate sweetness. Gajar ka halwa looked appetizing but wasn't good at all. Tasted old and not fresh. Had a weird taste of oil and was bitter. I give this sweet dish 1/5. So overall that's why the 3 stars.
2019-12-11,3,Came here with my girlfriends the other night to celebrate an early birthday. This place is very nicely decorated and the tables inside are beautiful! Upon sitting down we ordered a bottle of wine and a naan basket. The waiter brought us one glass of wine instead of the bottle at first, as he misunderstood our asking for a whole bottle (which isn't a problem but it took a few moments for the wine to then come out). The naan basket didn't come out until we asked for it a second time after getting our meals (which also took a fairly long time).Everyone was fairly satisfied with their meals overall. I told the waiter I was vegan and he told me what dish could be made to fulfill my dietary needs, which was a yellow lentil dal (and very good). The portions are huge - we all left with leftovers. While the food was pretty good, the service was a bit iffy. All the waiters were kind and friendly, but they forgot our bread order and went totally MIA when we needed them. They didn't have a vegan dessert, but they offered us fresh watermelon. I really appreciated their accommodating me being vegan but the service itself just really threw me off.
2019-12-03,2,Good food but rude staffNever again Can't believe the rudeness The first thing the waiter does was give me a dirty look when the other one comes up and says we close at 3 o'clockI understand the wanting to leave as soon as 3 o'clock hits but you don't have to be so nasty
2019-11-28,5,I've never been dissatisfied. We always order the salmon dish, garlic bread, samosas, crab cakes, mango lasi  it's our top most ordered dishes now!!! The side lentils are yummy also. And they are also so nice over the phone and delivery is ALWAYS ON POINT. We love karma cafe, LOVE. My hubby said he never liked Indian food but I turned him around by introducing him to this spot and now it's all he wants to eat!!!!! I'm so happy! Thank you for being open and making thanksgiving great for us two!
2019-11-26,5,Best indian restaurant in jersey city / hoboken area. Food is very tasty and the service is above average. The place has a nice ambience. Tends to be fairly busy, so be prepared to wait a little. The outdoor seating in the summer is nice and cozy. The Aloo Chole and Biryani are a must order.
2019-10-29,4,Lunch buffet was great and delicious and affordable. Dinner was too expensive for me to try though but good prices for food in the Hoboken area.
2019-10-21,5,The Chicken Tikka Masala, daal, and raita cannot be beat. One day when I leave Hoboken, this will be the restaurant I miss the most. I would bathe in the tikka masala sauce. Have I gone too far? I apologize.
2019-10-21,5,Great selection and great food. My go to when I fly into Newark. Portions are huge. I have yet to try any dessert as entrees are more than enough.
2019-10-19,2,Just got delivery - came on time within an hour, even though the tracking wasn't updated on the yelp app. Overall I'd give the restaurant/experience a 3.5, definitely some issues. Ordered a chai that was missing, I called and they said they would "credit my account", I expressed that we were really looking forward to it and they said it would take 25 minutes to deliver it, so I told them we would wait for it.I also asked for hot sauce on the side, which wasn't given, and no chutneys were given either. There also wasn't any salad, which is standard in almost all orders from an Indian restaurant.We ordered a garlic naan, but was given a plain naan. Very mediocre. Chicken tikka sauce was pretty good but the chicken was over cooked and bland. They did accommodate my all white meat request, which is appreciated. Ordered a keema paratha that was a bit burnt and not really good or an actual paratha.The last thing we ordered was the lamb bhuna, which was excellent and the only real highlight of the meal, I would get it again. The daal they give is a pass, rice was standard.It's been 50 minutes and I'm still waiting on the chai to be delivered.Over all a 3.5, probably a better restaurant for dining in.**update: I called after an hour of not getting my chai and they said they had already credited my account (which they didn't) because they didn't have a driver to deliver it, they didn't bother to contact me to let me know at all. Very unprofessional and poor service.
2019-10-03,5,First time trying their lunch buffet today. For $9.95, you get a variety of meat and veggie dishes. Quality Indian food and service! It was super busy during  lunch so try to get there before 12. We were also able to try their mango lassi which is basically a mango smoothie with yogurt (a must try!!). They serve lunch buffet every day for $9.95 + tax on weekdays and around $12 for weekends. The staff are energetic, fast, and will answer any questions regarding their menu. Great place to have lunch in between work!
2019-09-30,3,Good food and not too spicy but lack options.It's the same menu for years now it would be good to some additional seasonal items on the menu every once in a while and especially in the lunch buffet.
2019-09-28,5,When we visit New York City we stay in Weehawken. It's easier for our family. It was a beautiful night so we walked 1.5mi to Hoboken where there are many choices for restaurants. I researched a bit on Yelp prior and since we don't have Indian food where we live, and we love it, that's what we settled on. There was a bit of a wait when we arrived at 8:30 on a Saturday night, the staff was hustling and they got us in ASAP. We appreciated that. The atmosphere was energetic and the aromas were enticing. We had mango mojitos, one with alcohol, one without; both very tasty. As for food, the portions are large for Indian cuisine. My husband and I and are adultish children all took home leftovers. We enjoyed the vegetable somosas, the pastry had nice consistency. They were steamy, fresh and had hints of cinnamon; so good. My husband and son both had chicken dishes that they enjoyed. My husband wanted some veggies in his (it was all chicken) otherwise he was happy. I shared some of my perfectly spiced vegetable jalfrezi with him and that seemed to do the trick. My daughter had the daal, it was also really tasty (I tried it), she loved it. We did not have any room to even consider dessert! My son asked if we can come back here next time we are in the area. The only thing I would do differently is split an order with my daughter. Oh and I almost forgot- the garlic naan was crazy good!!!
2019-09-24,5,This is the best Indian food in Jersey City / Hoboken area.Everything we have had there has been good. We have heard their buffet on the weekends is delicious but have not tried it yet.
2019-09-19,5,This place is so good! The service is really nice and you get really good quality indian food. I got the lamb bhuna and it was delicious. We also got the meat platter and it was amazing. Definitely will come here again
2019-09-08,4,Love this place! when ever we are in the area we have dinner here. The waiters are really friendly and food comes out super fast and super Hot. It all taste home made. Great for vegetarians.
2019-09-08,5,Typically order food for delivery. While it might take some extra time, food is consistently great. Lamb seekh kebab, salmon, veg biryani and chicken kali mirch are some of the better dishes.
2019-09-05,3,Ask for take out and got too many plastics. Food is good but I don't like the waste. Next time I'll eat in but will never ask for good to go again
2019-08-28,5,Great Indian Food. I take my wife there for the fish offerings which are awesome. We have been there 5-6 times and have had fish of all sorts. Their side dishes make the breads redundant most of the times - typical tongue wagging Dal and rice. We normally order a fish starter and then have a main course which is also a fishy dish affair. The portion is always sufficient for 2. Though this time we went for Bengali tandoor salmon, the base was little overfried which we had to leave out - then also the quantity was good as we had a starter to satiate our appetite. This time we went for a glass of Pinot Grigio and it went down pretty well. Must visit. The ambiance is good for a indian bistro. They have outdoor sitting too but we normally prefer the warmth of indoors.
2019-08-27,3,Nice selection of foods for the lunch buffet. Weekday lunch is ~$10 and all you can eat, which is such a great deal. The food isn't the highest quality, but it isn't expected due to the cheaper price. Some of their chicken was undercooked, so be careful, and that's why it's 3/5 stars. I like how you can try different curries or just stick to what you like. Loved their naan--catch it when it's just coming out and it's so warm and soft. Their rice pudding dessert was refreshing and quite sweet. Overall, you can build a well rounded meal with a salad, protein, and carbs.
2019-08-25,5,The food was great. It tasted like I expected, right amount of spice and salt. The quantity was sufficient. It arrived on time, hot and fresh and the best part was that the plates and cutlery were given along. Definitely trying out more dishes from Karma Kafe.
2019-08-18,5,Great taste & good service! Portions are large & the veggie mains comes with jeera rice & dal.
2019-08-09,4,This is one of our go-to take out places.  We always order the chicken tika masala, naan and samosa chaat. The chicken is juicy, the sauce is tasty and seasoned well and the samosa chaat is the perfectcombination of sweet and savory.  The naan can be hit or miss. Sometimes it's perfect cooked and sometimes it a little rubbery. I am only giving it 4 stars because I think the chicken tika masala is overpriced for the portion.  I'd also appreciate more rice.
2019-07-31,5,Favorite Indian restaurant! The lunch buffet is ALWAYS amazing and fresh, and you get to try a little of everything. Food is high quality and delicious. Restaurant is clean and cute. Everything here is so good!
2019-07-30,4,Karma Kafe is my favorite Indian restaurant in the area. I got the chicken tikka masala and the portion was very generous. I asked for hot sauce and they gave me some delicious sauce that I couldn't stop adding. The garlic naan also never disappoints. The staff here is very friendly and helpful with questions about the menu. They have a full bar so come hungry and come thirsty!
2019-07-24,5,My favorite Indian food in Hoboken! Get the garlic naan and you will not be disappointed. All of the entrees I've had there are good, but if you don't have a high tolerance for spice, make sure you clarify with the waiter how spicy your dish is.
2019-07-22,5,Karma Kafe is a stand-out in a town with an abundance of restaurants.  I frequent their lunch buffet which offers a limited selection of basic but very well executed Indian cuisine at a fair price.  Reliably there is at least one chicken dish, a meat or fish option and two or three rotating vegetarian selections along with delicious naan, rice, soup, salad and fresh fruit.  The sides plates are just as fresh and tasty as the entrees and this attention to detail is what keeps me coming back.
2019-07-17,5,My favorite restaurant in Hudson County. All of their food is cooked to perfection. Have eaten here at least 20 times and have never had any problems. I highly recommend going to their lunch buffet on weekdays and also trying their mango lassi! Love you guys!!
2019-07-16,4,I recently visited Karma Kafe after about five years and the food was actually even better than I remember it! If you're looking for delicious Punjabi Indian food with generous portions, I would definitely recommend Karma Kafe. We came here on a Friday evening after hanging out at Pier 13, which is a fairly short walk away. We went around 7:30 PM, and the restaurant was packed but there was still a couple seats open. I enjoyed the vibe, it was a bit loud with the many diners, but it added to the fun and excitement of the experience. I started off with a delicious cocktail and complimentary "pappar" which is like a light, crunchy Indian cracker flamed on a stovetop with a kick to it. It comes with delicious sweet and spicy chutneys, as well as spicy pickled onions!For the entree, I ordered my go to at Punjabi restaurants, Paneer Palak (Paneer Cheese Cubes in a Spiced Creamy Spinach Sauce. Served with Basmati Rice and sal) ($12). I also ordered the Chili Garlic Naan ($4.50). These were generous servings and I took about half of my food to go, which was great! Everything was so delicious and well spiced. The Palak Paneer was creamy, savory and tasty. My favorite was the Chili Garlic Naan, it was spicy and had a strong aromatic taste of garlic. I'm glad they also include the dal, you can use it as a dip with your naan or pour over your rice for another delicious side combo. The wait service was generally good and on point, which the exception of a long wait for the check following the dinner. I'm looking forward to going back to Karma Cafe more regularly from now on!
2019-07-13,4,Ordered delivery, food was flavorful and we enjoyed it. Portions were large. Pricing about average for Indian food. Only issue was our order didn't get processed and so it took about an hour and half before it was delivered. Otherwise, would try it again!
2019-07-13,3,Decent place.Food was good not great, but they don't read the special instructions. Delivery was horrible through grubhub.
2019-07-10,5,This is the best food I have had so far near Jersey City. The buffet rocks and the food quality is supreme.
2019-07-03,5,a local recommended this place, and it was delicious!! she said it was the best indian around and i definitely can tell by the price and quality of the food. buffet was only $10
2019-06-25,5,This is a gem. Appetizers were nice. We then ordered their chicken Tika which was soft and exceptionally flavorfull. Decor is nice, also.
2019-06-12,5,Staple excellent food, service, presentation and even speedy delivery!!! Karma is hands down the test best Indian food in Hoboken. Best samosas I've ever had. Customer for life, yum!
2019-06-10,5,Delicious Indian food on a major strip in Hoboken. Service was spotty but it was a beautiful weekend day and the place was bustling! Like w/  every Indian restaurant, there were plenty of delicious vegetarian options. Their korma & onion nan were  some of the best I've had. Their cocktails were unique & beautiful. If I lived in the area this would be my go to Indian spot!
2019-05-30,5,Love Karma, we have been eating at or ordering from Karma Kafe for over 10 years and we live it. Always fresh and consistently delicious. They have a lot of vegetarian options. Their lunch buffet is also great and very affordable.
2019-05-25,5,First time here and we love it. The vegetarian options that we tried were amazing. We definitely will come back.
2019-05-15,5,This is my go to Indian place; I just love everything about it! The service is always awesome no matter how busy they get. Everyone is so nice and they are quick. Also, their take out is just as good as eating in. I always order the chicken vindaloo; the spice is awesome. Be aware though it is spicy!! We also order the shrimp malabar which is nice, but not spicy and of course garlic naan. They always have good specials that we've tried as well. We have never had a bad experience here. Pricing is pretty good too, not that expensive and the portions are perfect. We always have a little leftover.
2019-05-13,1,We have ordered delivery food a couple times and the whole experience has been extremely poor. The food has arrive up to two hours after completing the order on a weekday. We tried to reach out to the restaurant but were not able to get through the system. They have no regard for paying costumers; if you can't deliver food in a timely manner, don't accept people's money!
2019-05-01,5,I was pleasantly surprised by this popular, efficient Indian restaurant in the heart of Hoboken. I arrived at 10:30 p.m. and it was still going strong with more than half of the tables in use. I ate the papadam appetizer served with marinated vegetables and tamarind/cilantro sauces so they gave me a second one at no extra charge. The pomfret fish special was spiced brilliantly without being overwhelming, while a Himalayan vegetable dish was prepared using a savory orange sauce. There was also a collection of unspiced fresh greens as a necessary contrast. I didn't order any drinks, although they have a liquor license and the large glasses served at the next table looked colorful and foamy so I might try one of those the next time. There is also ample outside seating in warmer weather.
2019-04-21,5,Came by here on Sunday afternoon.  I had the chicken poppers as an appetizer.  I had the saag paneer too.  All was fresh and hot and delicious.  Servers were so hospitable and kind.  Prices were also very reasonable.Worth a stop by if you're in the neighborhood.
2019-04-16,5,The best Indian restaurant in Hoboken, best chicken Tikka Masala, fire naan, good service and atmosphere.
2019-04-14,5,I have never had Indian food before and this place was amazing!!! I have a severe dairy allergen and they were super accommodating and helpful in every aspect! Food here was great, service was great. I ordered the chicken curry and it was delicious! The only bad thing about it was the food took a little long to come out. Other than that, great experience
2019-04-07,5,This a great place to dine. Food was very tasty and delicious,  Perfect for an evening or lunch mealtime.
2019-04-03,4,Nice place at good location . Food was great except there was lot of Kesar in paneer Kashmiri. Parking is a hassle esp if you go during the day but place is very centrally located . Food and service was great . Awesome quantity at reasonable price .
2019-03-22,1,This was my second time at Karma Kafe. I would say the food is OKAY. Nothing special. However, this review is more so for the staff than the food. My friends and I were a party of 6 but we were still waiting for another friend. The staff told us we'd have a 10 min wait so they could put another table together for us. 10 mins turn into 30 mins and people after of us are continuously being seated in tables of 4's and 5's that are essential for our party of 6. We express this concern to the staff and they say it'll be another 10-15 mins. We then explain that if they keep seating other parties of 4 and 5 that there will never be a table ready for our party of 6. The bartender then becomes very rude and aggressive and says "what do you want me to do? Rush people out and tell them to hurry up?" He then rolls his eyes and waves at us to go away. Please teach your staff how to speak to customers.
2019-03-18,5,Best lunch buffet!!! I always skip breakfast because I cannot help stuff myself with all the yummy goodness!
2019-03-17,5,OhGOSH! You honestly have to come here to taste it for yourself- my review won't give it justice. The food was amazingggg, they have their Indian recipes on lock down in that kitchen. Must get: garlic naan, their salad with cucumbers and tomatoes and chickpeas. Tandoori chicken & chicken tiki masala. I'd have breakfast, lunch and dinner here lol
2019-02-24,4,We were here on Sunday buffet. I have tried a lot of buffet in Jersey city and the food here was good. The only thing was that the variety was pretty limited. The service was good.
2019-02-23,5,Best indian food i have ever had. Goat bhuna was the best. The quantity is also good.  The service was spot on. Definitely going to be regular for me. Must visit. Will be recommending friends to visit it once
2019-02-23,5,I love this place! Staff is friendly and accommodating. Great service. Felix is the best. We usually come here for the lunch buffet which I highly recommend. It's always very good. BEST Indian cuisine in the area. The Nirvana drink tastes delicious and refreshing. The Taj Mahal beer is great. The crunchy chips and 3 dips provided while you wait is very good. We ordered the Tandoori shrimp, a chicken Caesar salad, and the chicken Tikka masala. All dishes were amazing! The tandoori shrimp were spicy, full of flavor, and cooked perfectly. I love the crunch of them. The salad was your average chicken Caesar salad with fresh lettuce. The first bowl of chicken tikka masala came out rubbery but they quickly gave us a new bowl which was perfect. Very flavorful. Cost is decent too. Highly recommend Karma!
2019-02-22,5,Favorite place for a 1h work lunch on Fridays! Unlimited delicious and flavorful food for 12$ with tips. What more do I need to say?Oh right other than you will most likely be in a food coma the rest of the day and gained 2 lb but that's to be expected
2019-02-22,4,I'm not big on Indian food but if you need a quick Indian fix come here ! My go to drink when coming to an Indian spot is mango lassi . I recommend everyone to try, it's like a mango Greek yogurt drink , very delicious. For starters I forgot the name of it but it was like a round empanada with potatoes and peas inside.there was nothing special to that really. On to the God stiff the Nan bread was great but very oily , almost too oily hold of on the oil please. I know that's how they have to prepare it but I've gone to other Indian spots and it's never been that oily. On to my main course I got the Chicken Biryani and my friend got the Tikka Masala. There was nothing particularly wrong with my Biryani but there was nothing out of this world about it. It's a regular plate of rice and chicken with spices but for some reason I didn't find that the flavor was there. I judge the Biryani based on flavor and spices and this plate didn't blow my expectations away but nonetheless it was good. Perhaps it's because I enjoy flavor spicy food. Now the Tina Masala was right on point , buttery and filled and explosion of flavor ! I would for sure come back for that. Over all I did enjoy coming to this place, the ambiance was nice and cozy lots of couples go there. The portions of the food are a great amount especially the Biryani !!!!! Would I come again ? Yes I would just ask to make my Biryani spicy ! Nice addition to the Hoboken area  !
2019-02-10,5,Amazing tasting Indian food with unique flavors! Also, the quantity of food given here is beyond generous. I would definitely recommend Karma Kafe to anyone who is either new to Indian food or is craving some Indian food.
2019-02-09,4,Karma Kafe,exactly what it says on the door! Homely Indian food with very friendly and polite staff! Appetizers are superb!
2019-01-21,5,Went here after careful searching for a good place to get some biryani. The ambiance is pretty cool though the place is small so whenever the door closes you get a waft of freezing air. The portions are GIANTTT. My mom and I got a lamb and chicken biryani to share together and my good Lord was that a lot of food. We ate as much as we could at the restaurant and had it for dinner the next day easily. Taste was pretty amazing, though I feel like the chicken was more tender than the lamb. I feel like the only thing lacking was the variety of nuts (they only put peanuts in). Service was top notch: I never noticed my water glass get low, they wrapped everything for us when we were done, and the waiters were amazingly nice on our way out and gave us a free appetizer coupon for our next visit. Also I learned that they have free parking around the corner which is a gem in Hoboken. Definitely going to go back again, possibly for their lunch buffet.
2019-01-18,2,Dont ever go to this place waste of money very very high price , not worth for quality they provide , better Check some best food in other Indian Restuarant
2019-01-11,2,Know that Indian food is spicy but this came more than spicy eve though I asked for mild. The food with unmeasured spices (so much paper and so...) made me sick. I have had a stomachache I love Indian food but NOT the one here.
2019-01-06,5,Food was amazing. Service was amazing. Staff was incredibly kind and helpful. My date wanted a vegetable korma, which isn't even on the menu, the chef said no problem and made one of the best vegetable kormas we have ever had! The nan, the somasa, all took our breath away. It was first the heat that did it, but the subtle taste of India claimed what remaining breaths we had left. Delicious! Can't wait to return soon, as the karma given to us was top notch
2018-12-30,5,Probably the most authentic Indian food I have had outside of India. The goat curry was hearty - cooked just enough to make the meat tender and not taste gamey. The upma and kheer tasted like home! I've tried a lot of Indian places around here and this definitely ranks among the top few.
2018-12-27,2,The place is small, but the ambience is good. The food depends on what you order.Stay away from the Lamb, Goat and Fish. Stay away from the Tandoor starters as well. Their goat/lamb was way undercooked and tasted like chewing on rubber. Pretty sure it was not thawed properly. The fish smelled stale.The vegetables in the vegetarian entrees looked fresh and were cooked al dente-something I prefer.The weird part is that they slipped in a gratuity in the itemized bill despite us being only three members. I would have tipped regardless but It got weirder when they gave us the final receipt to sign which asked for an additional tip. The weirdest part was this final receipt was missing the original itemized bill. Someone who might have not paid attention to the 1st itemized bill would end up tipping twice. Now you know!!!
2018-12-26,5,This review is for the lunch buffet which fortunately is available on both weekends and weekdays!! Wonderful value, friendly and non-pushy staff, fresh food. I love this place! It's one of the few places you can get a good and filling meal on Washington St that's not a sandwich or burger, for $12ish (and that's on a weekend, too!). And the food is legit! It's always a good sign when an ethnic food restaurant is filled with people from that culture who know what's good. The buffet options have several staples like chicken Tikka masala and dal and spinach with paneer but also a handful of rotating entrees. Dessert too! And the naan comes out fresh and piping hot every 10 minutes or so. I have no complaints. I'll keep coming to eat here for sure.
2018-12-25,4,Good to find an Indian restaurant in Hoboken.Good ambience and it seemed a nice place to dine in. The starters were excellent  and customer service was excellent . I would love to be here again.
2018-12-24,5,So far I've dined in for dinner with 6 and ordered delivery for 10 and both were fantastic. Food is outstanding here. I've ordered lamb curry/vindaloo, chicken curry, lamb korma, saag paneer, okra, and cauliflower. All were really good. Portions are big so you'll have enough for another meal. I really like that, when cold, the curries don't coagulate and sport a layer of oil on top.The service is friendly and proactive. Delivery is on point. I like how you're able to schedule a delivery in advance. Overall a great experience and my guests really enjoyed themselves. Stop in or get delivery when you have the opportunity.
2018-12-17,4,It's actually been years since I've had a Karma Kafe dinner.  Keeping it simple, we ordered chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, and naan.  Everything was delicious! The tikka masala was the best I've ever had at Karma.  Consider this: the prices remain reasonable, and no one has been able to oust Karma Kafe from the top spot for Hoboken Indian cuisine. That says a lot.  Next,  have a liquor license for those in need of a drink, and they still have a popular lunch buffet.  This dinner was mostly due to a craving for Indian food, but my perspective is refreshed and I'm looking forward to my next visit.
2018-11-30,4,We ordered way too much food. The portions are HUGE! We loved the garlic nan more than the cheese nan. Biggest, and thickest nan I have ever had! The paneer was so flavorful and delicious! The chicken tikka was also amazing! Did not enjoy the chicken or lamb curry as much.
2018-11-26,5,The best vegetarian dish I've ever had. Nice Resteraunt on the main st with friendly staff definitely returning again.
2018-11-18,5,Perfection. Favorites:Crackling chicken poppers Samosa chatKofta makhani Extremely flavorful "americanized" indian food. Some of the best in the area. Very consistent and good portions.
2018-11-17,5,If I could give Karma Kafe 5 stars I would, this place is very good. The service is always outstanding. Good good food very authentic! I recommend the tandoori shrimp you won't regret it, mango lassi to drink and the chicken tikka masala is my personal favorite! Place is packed on the weekends to eat in but it is worth the wait!!!!! Definitely the best Indian restaurant in Hoboken! Felix is amazing! Ask for him!
2018-11-12,5,Great Indian food in Hoboken...Always good and helpful great staff...Delivery is perfect!!..Considering They are busy wait time can be long but worth it!Especially on inclement weather....Please use common sense when ordering on rainy,snowy days delivery will be longer then usual but the food is splendid!!!
2018-11-11,5,Karma Kafe is Hoboken's best spot for Indian food. The restaurant itself is bright and cleverly decorated incorporating a variety of antique Indian objects (bells, old doors and windows) into an open modern space. The servers here are all very, very nice - friendly and helpful. If you aren't familiar with Indian cuisine, Karma Kafe is a good introduction. Dishes are flavoursome and well spiced but not 'burn your ears hot'.The lunch buffet has to be one of the best deals in town, it's $9.95 during the week and just a couple of dollars more at the weekend. There's always a good selection of things to choose from: salads, appetisers, a couple of chicken/fish or meat options and a good variety of vegetable dishes. My tip is to come either early or late at lunchtime as it always gets busy (people know a good deal when they see it it seems!) don't worry though the buffet is always plentiful and constantly being restocked.In the evenings, there's a fairly extensive A la Carte menu of both Indian classics and modern takes on traditional dishes - order a bunch of appetisers and a few curries and eat them family style. Everything is good but some of my favourites are the samosas and pakoras, saag (spinach), daal (lentils) and don't forget to order some of their excellent stuffed Naan Breads. There's a fairly extensive range of beers wines and cocktails available and finally, it's a great place for vegetarians as there are plenty of menu options for them to choose from.
2018-10-28,3,Tried their food delivery and ordered chicken tikka and garlic naan (as typical as it gets!). Chicken portion was plentiful but was not well cooked; tikka masala was OK; garlic naan was tasty but too thick; Daal (and rice came along with chicken tikka) was really tasteless and too watery.I think if the chicken had cooked well and tikka could reach inside, you would have got 4 stars from me right there.I am gonna try their buffet though which I heard is pretty nice.
2018-10-28,3,We ordered many naans, chicken mirch, kashmiri paneer, malai kofta, one appetizer veggie plate, one appetizer kabaab plate.The portions were good so no complains on that, chicken mirch was spicy and red hot, way i like it. Chicken appetizer plate was good too. Other things, well, I could have done without.Paneer was basically paneer cubes thrown in an overnight heated cream, extremely heavy and way oversweet. Kofta was tolerable but again one bite was may be a 1000 calories. Veggie platter was bad, extreme amount of oil in pakoras - especially samosas which clearly were stale.Worst of all were two waiters who clearly ignored requests for menus/plates and one of them was rude enough to say "i heard you, its busy..wait" - he clearly hated his job!This might be one of my last option to eat at.
2018-10-15,5,Karma Kafe is my favorite local spot for Indian food for two major reasons: the food and service. While I'm not Indian, my husband is, so when it comes to eating out he looks for truly authentic Indian cuisine. We had trouble finding a restaurant we both liked in the area because I don't enjoy the spice levels (and greasiness!) of many other places. Karma is a perfect balance for us! They've found a way to keep their recipes super authentic, while still appealing to a non-Indian crowd who might not enjoy the spice as much. At this point we've ordered just about everything and it's all been delicious--chicken and lamb curries, tandoori meats, veg appetizers, biryani, and of course their perfectly soft and crispy naan! You really can't go wrong. My sister-in-law has recently moved to Jersey City as well, and this has now become her go-to spot! The best part is they delivery to us, so when we don't feel like a sit down meal in their charming restaurant, we can still enjoy their delicious menu items. Food is obviously an important factor in reviewing a restaurant, but so is service. The sweet staff saw me come and go a few times the past months picking up takeout, and one day we got to talking while I waited for my well-worth-it biryani. I told them that my husband is Indian and we've finally found an Indian restaurant we BOTH love. I also mentioned his favorite dessert is Galab Jamun and since then we always find an order of it in our takeout bag on the house from Felix! We recently sat inside for their mouthwatering lunch buffet (only $12 on the weekends!) and he even served us a complimentary plate of three warm and syrupy Galab Jamun. Such a yummy surprise and sweet gesture! He's the best!  So while the food is what got us hooked, it's the service that will keep us coming back! Can't say enough good things about this spot.
2018-09-11,5,This has been my go-to Indian takeout spot for about three years now. It's always delicious, always delivers on time, and pretty authentic in my opinion. I was so sad when they closed for a few months but I'm so glad they're open again! I don't order from anywhere else!
2018-09-08,5,Loved it, we wanted to find a great Indian spot in the neighborhood and this is it. We will be back! Would love if there were peas in your basmati rice though. Other than that, it was all fabulous.
2018-09-08,5,High quality, good value and delicious Indian food! Everything is so good but highly recommend the Chicken kebab medley. For $15 you get more chicken than you can eat-- both ginger chicken kebab and chicken tikka kebabs, along with rice, cabbage and onions. So friggn good!! The chicken tikka entree is also delicious if you like a creamy sauce. Get some naan on the side and you're set! Delivery is always pretty quick. Love Karma Kafe and so glad they rebuilt after that fire a few years ago. A staple restaurant in Hoboken.
2018-09-02,5,Very tasty food. Amazing tomato soup, best I had till date. Lovely ambience.Must visit when in New Jersey.
2018-09-02,5,I went there on a Sunday and loved it. The food was great and they are very generous with their portions. We celebrated a friend's birthday there and they were very accommodating and took really good care of us. I did not try their buffet but my friends who tried it said it was well worth it. I had the biryani which I liked. I recommend getting the paneer, it was one of the best paneer preparations I tried.
2018-09-01,5,I went there with my family for dinner today and was pleasantly surprised. Having been to many Indian restaurants in the north/central jersey area I was used to being disappointed with poor service and/or mediocre food.However, Karma Kafe did not disappoint on either count. The food was great, we had the malai kofta, veg biryani, and paneer makhani. All were of very good quality and in generous portion sizes. Other plus points include - nan was very fresh and well made- prices were very reasonable- they included rice and dal with each entree- most other Indian restaurants don't do this- paneer dish actually came with more than 3 paneer pieces! - I've been to so many Indian restaurants where I could count the paneer pieces with the fingers on one hand.- service was very good and professional- nice decor
2018-08-26,5,Freakin DELISH. We order from here on seamless- have literally never been inside but my GAWD it's delicious. We order paneer palak and kashmiri (sorry for butchering the spelling) it's so so good and fast. Highly recommend!
2018-08-19,5,Great food, excellent staff! For the price you pay, the food portions are more than fair! I've tried other Indian places in the Jersey City area but Karma Kafe has to be my new favorite. Their food is bursting with flavor and I felt welcomed upon entering the store. Will stop by again soon!
2018-08-12,4,My friends rave about this place so you know I had to try. I do not eat Indian food that much but when I do you know I have to put the toilet paper in the freezer before hand. I had to go with the classic chicken tiki marsala. Yes I know it is cliche to order but wanted to try the gold standard. It was pretty good. The sauce was both spicy and creamy. The heat doesnt hit you all at once but rather slowly builds up on you. To help with the heat I ordered the sun dried tomato naan. Pretty solid. We also ordered the fried fish with honey mustard. Not sure how authentic that is but fish was cooked well. Not sure of the combo with the honey mustard but it was ok. The  kebab platter however was dry and probably wouldnt order again. Overall, good experience here just get that toilet paper in the freezer just in case.
2018-08-11,5,Great food, EXCELLENT service. If you're in the area and want good quality, well made Indian food, this is the only place I'd recommend.
2018-08-11,3,I would give 3 stars for my experience by visiting the restaurant twice in two days. First day I was very impressed as I ate the fish specials however the next day I got carried away and ordered the daal, roti , and hariyali chicken. All of them were disappointing to be honest!
2018-08-09,4,My Sister took me for weekday lunch.  Excellent buffet deal.  She only had 1 hr. We were seated right away and immediately stuck into fresh authentic Indian dishes.  Fish was a bit dry but rest of the food was delicious.  Starters, main course and dessert all laid out. Drinks came fast and so did the check.  Enough time to grab a coffee after.  Clean toilets and not too cramped for Hoboken.  Shout out to Felix the waiter. Friendly and efficient staff.  WILL BE BACK! (with my hit the buffet twice husband :)
2018-08-03,5,Love love love! The food is good, ambience casual, staff is nice! All in all, a very good spot for indian/fusion cuisine. Both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes are fab! They also have outdoor seating!
2018-07-24,5,After moving to Hoboken, I began to think I would not be able to get my Indian fix!  Crisis diverted.  I can only speak about the delivery service and it's top notch.  Food arrives as expected - most often earlier than promised.  Chicken Tikka has a slight kick - just the way I like it.  Naan is fresh. My first order was mixed up and my fault with entering the wrong address and the owner was truly top notch.  Kept my food warm and delivered three times.  I'm a loyal customer.
2018-07-22,4,I've only had dinner and takeout from here and it's always delicious. Today we tried the buffet and it didn't disappoint. It was nice to try things that I wouldn't normally order off the menu.
2018-07-20,5,Overall Experience: Best Indian Food and awesome staffItems ordered: Tomayo soup, cheese Naan, Roasted Garlic Naan, Panner Makhani Ambience: place is lil congested and noisy Breadth of Items: Paneer Makhani was tasty and spicy, tomato soup is a must try item at this place, Naan is fluffy and tasty. We were walking to bare burger and gave a try at this place and worth it.
2018-07-20,4,This is one of my go to lunch buffet specially for Indian food. The location itself is a great- filled with natural lighting, located in the heart of Hoboken, plenty of outdoor seating, clean restrooms, and a vibrant atmosphere indoors. The lunch buffet itself is tasteful, filled with flavor and spices. However, the food isn't spicy at all and at times it can seem like the food is lacking in a bit of taste when compared to some other Indian restaurants such as Touch of Spice. Despite this, the staff and servers are personable and overall great. I would say that when I have had dinner here the food has been significantly better than their lunch buffet.
2018-07-20,5,As a native Indian I give this restaurant 5 stars for many reasons! Location! Right in the heart of hoboken next to many offices and apartment buildings. They offer ample outdoor seating and have a cute decor setup outside and inside too. The servers were really nice and allowed us to sit even when restaurant was almost closing. He came fast and served our drinks in a timely manner! As for the food, we may have ordered a bit too much but i must portions are huge. Much larger than we expected. Indian restaurant portions tend to be very small. Okay now onto what counts, the food! We ordered a goat biryani, lamb and a special they had, a whole fried fish. The fish was full of flavor and cooked to perfection. It was so moist and easy to digest. The lamb curry was on point and tasted homemade. The biryani, my favorite was a perfect mix of rice, meat, veggies and nuts packed with spices! I strongly recommend Karma Kafe if you are in the area and like Indian food! I will definitely be back!!
2018-07-15,5,The BEST Indian food I've ever had. Chef of India used to be my spot but I think I will be jumping ship. The vegetarian appetizer sampler is what love and beauty would taste like if it were a food. In particular, I was shocked by the samosa. The outside shell was crunchy but still had flavor while the filling was moist and rich. A friend of mine had some of the pakora and thought it was meat. They do a great job of making vegetables appealing to even the most strict omnivore. I don't even need to tell you about the naan bread but I will say this: it had the PERFECT taste and texture. Thank god. I really enjoyed their chana saag: spinach curry with chickpeas. It was a little spicy - even for me - but the jasmine rice slightly mellowed it out. I had leftovers the next day and prior to reheating I actually added a little bit of soy creamer from my fridge. Much better! If I had to complain about ANYTHING it'd be the rice portion. It's a little small for the amount of entree you're given. It's possible I'm just a gluttonous bastard spoiled by other restaurants. Who knows? I'm not sure what I'll order next time but I am excited to explore their menu! Come here. You'll love it.
2018-07-14,5,Awesome food and it really taste delicious. From appetizers to the main entrees, everything is to the point. Their customer service is really good. We order from them regularly and any issues we have had, they immediately rectify it. Karma Kafe is really the best spot in Jersey City Hoboken area. We keep going back. Thanks guys!
2018-07-13,5,One of the best Indian spots I know of in Hudson County, the staff are so friendly and helpful, the best Indian food I have ever had was in Brick Lane in London and this would be right up there. The two dishes you must try is the chicken tikka masala $14 and the lamb madras $14-$16 (mild spicy and slowly cooked) I would also get the roasted garlic naan $4 but it is quite filling so if you want go for something lighter because you're going to get dessert, then get the poppadoms with their special sauces that come with it. If you do have space get the mango lassi (mango and yogurt frappe)which is amazing but filling! I've become a regular and the staff is always so helpful and quick with my orders.
2018-07-10,5,great buffet food! I had it for the first time a couple weeks ago and the food was terrific! You walk in and go straight to the buffet. Their dessert is great, you must try!
2018-07-08,2,I am generous with my rating giving it two stars. The reason is that this place is kind of cute. The good and service - not so much. The waiters seems quite indifferent. They never cleaned out dirty dishes from appetizers even after I stacked them up myself at the corner of the table. The food was horrible. Truly. It is the first time I write the review saying that the food was truly bad. I know and love Indian food. And this place was by far the worst I have even eaten too. It is not truly Indian; dishes looked like a fusion of Indian-Chinese. The portions are huge but inedible. My veggies were so oily sweeping in grease. My husbands meat was tough. I don't understand why this place got such rating but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
2018-07-08,5,The chicken tikka masala and the malai kofta were some of the best I've had in the New York area. The breads were fantastic--light and fresh-chewy. What a lovely find.
2018-07-08,5,It's been years since I've had Karma as I moved out of NJ and to this day, I have yet to find a chicken Kashmiri as delicious as theirs. Hands down the best I've ever had and I refuse to give up until I find one just as good in the Buffalo area! Or feel free to send me your recipe!
2018-07-04,4,Went for their Sunday buffet. They don't include unnecessary dishes, it's a small but decent spread. Tried the following items -1. Pakoda kadhi (fried onion-gram flour fritters in yoghurt and gram- flour based gravy) - It was pretty good, and very tasty.2. Mutton gravy - It was good for mutton lovers, for me it was okay as I can't stand the mutton/goat smell. 3. Pav bhaji (toasted buns with a mashed potato thick curry) - It was spicy like its supposed to be, and tasted good except it may have been a little old (maybe reheated?).4. Chicken tikka pieces - were pretty good, they had a nice grilled taste to them. 5. Sambhar (lentil based vegetable stew) - It was really good, nice hot and spicy and had a great amount of veggies in there. 6. mutton Meat balls - It was good. They had a few other items like chickpeas, spinach paneer, etc. that I did not try. Service was attentive, and place was not too crowded  It is a good spot for a decent Indian buffet but not one that I would crave (not exceptional).
2018-07-03,5,The food was very good. The veggie biryani was mild which I liked the most but the chicken biryani was a bit spicy. The naan was good as well and the waiter was attentive. Nice experience after all.
2018-07-02,5,Truly a delight in Hoboken's glut of Italian and American offerings. Their new location makes good use of what little space they have, and they have great outdoor seating options, both covered and uncovered. The space is open, and even when it's bustling (which is most of the time), it doesn't feel overwhelming. The food is fantastic. Their chaats are solid and big enough to be an entree on their own! I always get the kulcha, but people love the naan. Stand-out entrees include the malai kofta, paneer kashmiri, bagare baingan, and bhindi aloo, though I love everything that this place serves. Service is always great. The waiters are friendly and attentive even when they are running from table to table. I've also ordered take-out from here and it was timely and just as good eating in.One of the gems of Washington Street.
2018-06-17,5,Best Indian food around.  Great cocktails too.  Try the buffet.  Also deliver.  The biryani rice is outstanding. Pretty much everything on the menu is great.  Try a mango lassi too.
2018-06-03,4,Went here for their buffet lunch during the week. Place got and gets packed quick! Their spread was delicious and always fresh and refilled. Their naan was so good! Buttery and fluffy! For the price of their buffet, it will definitely put you in a coma! Their tandoori chicken was one of my favorite dishes they served. Definitely will come back for some flavorful food!
2018-05-21,5,I live in Hoboken and the Karma Kafe is one of my favorite restaurants in town. I am no expert in Indian food but being a big fan I have had it often   and I love everything about Karma, the portions are large and very reasonably priced. Did I mention how tasty it is? Well it is and they seem to care about their cooking and it shows. Friendly and attentive service too, you never have to wait long for a check. Just writing this review makes me wish I was there.
2018-05-17,4,It was a busy day today at the office so me and my coworker decided to order here. I never had Indian food before. I ordered the chicken tikka masala. The order came with rice and dal. For the price of the meal it was worth it. The food didn't take long to be delivered. The chicken tasted very good and flavorful.My coworker order samosa and I had a piece of it. The samosa was packed with chickpeas, onions, and tomatoes. This is an appetizer and it's good also. Next time I will actually go to the restaurant and eat instead of getting it delivered.
2018-05-16,5,Truly the best Indian restaurant in Hoboken!  Crawfish vindaloo & the goat are staples when we order.  They're not afraid to season & spice their dishes which we think is awesome (and rare these days).  Lunch buffets are always hit and miss, but they do a decent job with theirs.  We tend to order delivery once or twice a month from Karma - top notch!
2018-05-12,5,A-Mazing!!  We've been looking for a great authentic Indian restaurant in NY/NJ since we moved here 4 years ago.  Found some that were decent but nothing compared to what we had back home until now!  Had the Chicken Vindaloo (hot) and the veg Samosa, both were excellent!  We ordered delivery, will definitely do that again but also want to try the restaurant!
2018-05-11,4,One of my Indian frineds recommended this place to me a while ago and finally checked out today. Ordered Aloo Chole. I like the home-made sauce a lot. Little spicy but not too much.
2018-05-11,3,Went here for lunch and it was just OK. The wait staff is extremely nice and the price is AMAZING for a buffet but I really felt it lacked more flavor. They had a great selection of different dishes that I was eager to try but when I got back to my seat everything basically tasted the same. I love Indian food and how different each dish can be because of the layers of spices in the curries but these came up a bit flat.I feel that if I had come here for dinner everything would be a lot better because they actual meats and veggies and naan were cooked perfectly. This is still a pretty solid deal for lunch and I would probably still come back if I had a craving.
2018-05-10,5,Just ate here with my daughter and had a fabulous dinner and experience.  We sat outside (with our dog Lincoln) on a beautiful night.  The service was excellent as was the food.  I had the rogan josh and my daughter had the vegetarian dumplings in masala sauce.  They each came with a soup which I barely noticed because the rogan josh was so good.  We also had naan - which was both huge and delicious.   And --- they have a liquor license !  Will definitely go back.
2018-05-10,5,I'm so glad I found this place! My dad and I went here for dinner and had a wonderful time! Sat outside and the waiters couldn't have been more accommodating: brought out water for my dog, explained the menu to us, and brought out appetizers and water very quickly I had vegetarian dumplings in a tikka masala sauce with naan! Absolute delicious. The sauce was extremely flavorful and the naan was out of this world. Had an overall great experience! Will definitely be back
2018-05-03,5,Super fresh food at very reasonable prices. The portions are great and tastes delicious. The samosas are awesome and super huge too.
2018-04-19,4,Went in today for lunch second time having Indian food first time here my server was Gabriel or so it said on my bill he was very nice and took the time to go over the food selection with me I had the weekday lunch buffet along with the coconut lassi all great including service the rice pudding dessert wasn't my favor it had a sharp taste other then that it was a pleasant experience they get super busy during lunch decor was lovely looking forward to returning
2018-04-18,4,One word:  The veggie samosas.I'm not an Indian food expert, but consider myself a finger food or small bites junkie. I also like killing two birds with one swoop -- that is, I like to eat while walking, in the hopes that I burn those damn dear munchies before they grow into ever-loyal, waist-loving munchkins (which are really regarded as muffins...their top parts, if not simply donuts...), and so...this starter is just perfect, and actually took me and the guy to the finish...I mean, we didn't have to get anything else -- the veg samosas were filling, and 2 pieces for $5?!! (of course, we ended up with two orders). But more importantly, we didn't get any digestive problems or nasal congestion, which we usually get from overly salty foods... (though I haven't checked this condition's scientific validity). Also appreciate that these fine golden browns didn't drip with oil as you sink your teeth into them, which is nice since you were on your feet... Final word:  The veggie samosas. (Which should really be called fat potato empanadas or giant, crispy pierogis, but never you mind that.)In other words:  You might need to practice stretching your mouth with a tennis ball... Unless you use a plate to catch all them savory stuffing...Food for thought:  Looking forward to sitting in for the pakoras and other dishes. Alright, I need to stop here, as I'm already salivating just having this thought... Though it might just be simply good karma... So 4 at this karmic time.
2018-04-14,5,This sounds like an excellent restaurant that i hope to try at some point in the future
2018-03-31,4,Once again Karma café hits a homer  in the stomach with a most succulent variety of spicey food.I would had given them a full 5 stars but they did not include plastic utensils or napkins.For delicious delivery make sure you ask for those items my little kiddies!Otherwise set your taste buds to "stun!"my little kiddies!
2018-03-28,3,Ordered in :Paneer makhni - decent - soft paneer and not too sweet.Gobhi matar - ok - in tomato gravy.Comes with a side of rice and daal which was pretty cool.
2018-03-20,5,Indian cuisine is one of my favorites. I was recently in Jersey and had to try out this spot.  As soon as I sat down I was greeted by the staff with smiles. Top notch service. I ordered the chicken tikka masala, shrimp madras, and a lamb dish. Usually, I'm not really into lamb but the waiter said it's one of the best things on the menu so I listened. Boyyyy am I glad I listened to him because it was SO good! In my opinion, it was the most flavorful dish out of all of the ones I ordered. The meat was so tender and flavorful. For desert I got the rasmalai. Absolutely delicious. I recommend you try Karma out.
2018-03-05,5,I've been coming to Karma for almost 20 years and in that time they have never let me down. Their consistency for excellent food is amazing and the staff feels like old friends. Karma has a lunchtime buffet that changes daily with Indian specialties that you can have for about 9 per person. It's not too big in there and it does get crowded.
2018-03-03,5,Delicious, buffet lunch great value, chicken tikka masala excellent and definitely try the rice pudding for dessert
2018-02-26,5,Awesome spot for lunch, dinner, or take out. The chicken vindaloo is spicy, but worth it. All the options were really good and I have not had a complaint yet after 6-7 visits.
2018-02-24,4,Tried the weekend buffet for :$11.95Veg options - Pav bhaji, paneer sabzi, palak saag, Naan and palak bhaji.Non veg options - Chicken tandoori, mutton curry They setup a buffet in the small corner of a beautifully decorated place. I thought they could have had more options on a buffet menu. Very limited options but food was great! Service is prompt and courteous. I wouldn't mind going here again if I'm in the area!
2018-02-22,4,Tried their $11 lunch buffet during the weekday. I would say food are pretty decent with unlimited buffet and salad bar. It's cheap, too. But seriously, both me and my friend had stomachache right after the meal...  I would say unless I have really strong stomach for the Indian food, otherwise I need to think twice before I tried again lol
2018-02-17,4,Fresh, fragrant and satisfying! The lunch buffet I visited on a Friday around noon. They had the traditional vegetarian dishes I have come to expect, along with very fresh and warm naan. There was a fish based main dish that I have never had before - it was a thick-bodied white fish that was very good, as was the Tandori chicken and other dishes.  For vegetarians, one dish had tofu and there was also a nice Caesar salad, that with the watermelon was very refreshing to top off the meal. Stevens students are fortunate to just walk down hill to catch a lovely bite.
2018-02-14,5,Food and service is great. I highly recommend the chicken tandoori. When it's nice out they have outdoor seating.
2018-02-12,4,Always great food at Karma!!!  Had delivery for the 1st time and the food was just as good in house.  My friend I was sharing the meal with said this is the best Indian he has had!
2018-02-07,5,My husband and I finally made our way to this restaurant last night. The staff is very welcoming it gets crowded in the night on any given day I can tell. The food was amazing (naan with garlic was everythingggggg) my husband had a chicken dish and I had Tandoori Fish which was made just right seasoned perfectly and nice and rendered. I had the lentil soup spicy just the way I like it to be. I would definitely return back with my husband. We might try the buffet on a weekend.
2018-02-04,3,Average place, average food. Nothing to write home about. Service was a let down. Could be better
2018-01-30,5,LOVE Karma Kafe. My husband and I eat here almost every week and everything we've had is great. The service is generally good. The lunch buffet is good for meat eaters- if you're vegetarian/vegan there are many more options for dinner.
2018-01-30,4,$9.95 lunch buffet (weekdays)$11.95 lunch buffet (weekends)Come early, around opening time, on a weekend to snag yourself a seat. The buffet section takes up a small corner by the front door and features mostly popular Indian dishes, and an abundance of naan. Definitely get the rice pudding dessert at the end of your meal, its sweet and refreshing. The staff here is always friendly and attentive without you having to flag them down. They're on seamless, and offer $5 off your first delivery order. For the price of the lunch special, especially on a weekend, it is very fair for Indian food. I actually really appreciate the fact that Karma Kafe offers weekend lunch specials since most place do not. The mango lassi is $4.95 and not included in the buffet selection but I highly recommend the beverage as it is deliciously refreshing. When coming for the lunch special, be prepared to leave with the itis post lunch special, and probably be unproductive for the rest of the day.
2018-01-20,5,This was Indian food done really well.  My favorite thing was the naan.  A lot of times, naan can be kinda burnt and flaky, but this one was big, fluffy, and buttery, just perfect.Got the chicken tikka masala which was tasty, but I wish I went with the chicken coconut one.  The reason I didn't was because I was told the spice would be too hot.  Maybe next time, I will grow a pair, and give it a shot.
2018-01-15,4,Delicious food and generous portions.  Friendly, excellent wait staff.  They made us masala chai even though it was a busy night.  Awesome location right on Washington.  Only drawback is the small bathroom.  But that shouldn't detract on an outstanding experience eating Indian food here.
2017-12-22,5,I am a Hoboken resident, and Karma is one of our favorite restaurants in town. Not only is their food yummy, their portions are also very generous (Samosas the size of your face!). The guys that work there are also quite nice, and we've only had pleasant experiences here.
2017-12-21,1,We were here for a holiday dinner. Restaurant wasn't that crowded and looked clean. Service sucked big time and food was terrible. For starters we ordered veg and chicken samosa, allo tikki, kabab sampler, wings haryali and papdi chat. I cannot tell which one was worse. For main course, we ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, salmon malabar, lamb curry, lamb Bhuna, roti and nans. I couldn't tell if any one of them was worth their price. Definitely I am not coming back to this place nor I will recommend this to anyone..
2017-12-12,5,Since their redo, I have been actually stopping on the way home from work to pick up food as opposed to waiting for delivery. Food is always delicious and no matter what night of the week I go there, it's always busy!
2017-11-23,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants. The food, flavor and service is on point. I love everything on the menu specially the tandoori chicken. I highly recommend it!
2017-11-18,5,Came for the buffet lunch. Besides being a tad crowded, this place is a little hidden gem. The decor is so cute and the food is nice and authentic, besides being a buffet. Very cozy place to enjoy some authentic Indian food. Naan was fantastic!
2017-11-09,4,This was my first time trying real Indian food at a restaurant rather than buying a he microwave stuff from Trader Joe's. I got the tikki chicken masala and it was really good. It came with a small chickpea soup, some lettuce and cumin rice. I had no idea cumin rice was a thing but I'm a fan. My wife got the spinach and cheese dish which looks unappetizing but wasn't bad. We also got the nam (not sure if I spelled that right and I'm too lazy to look it up), which was made with a few on of garlic was good. Overall, everything was pretty good and not bad for a quick dinner.
2017-10-28,3,Karma is OK. I ordered spicy and it was not spicy. It would be nice if they would get off the generic Indian food and start to mix it up a bit. It is kind of the only game in town so we can get the standard fare.
2017-10-25,5,I have to say that after a couple of attempts of 'ok' experiences here, I ordered tonight and everything was delicious! The texture and the flavors were on point. Really happy that I gave them a try again! Chicken tikka masala was perfectly seasoned, samosas were crispy, the accompanying sauces were perfect. And to add- delivery was right on time and finally, this review is not coming from a "boring Western" palate : )
2017-10-24,4,Chicken tikka masala is one of my fav dishes and this is close to the best ive had in a long time! Not sure i would eat in the restaurant as it doesn't have much of an atmosphere for a sit down dinner, it's bright and doesn't feel like i'm sitting in an Indian restaurant, which is a shame.
2017-10-19,1,Karma Kafe may have decent food but their wait staff is AWFUL. Very disrespectful toward women. One of the guys actually stuck their tongue out, like a reptile whilst waiting on me. Who does that?! And then he just kept ogling at me, for goodness knows what reason. Felt very unsafe just being in their presence. Ladies, I'd suggest that you take your business elsewhere.
2017-10-18,4,I stop in occasionally for dinner. Always has been reliable tasty food.  I usually order the chicken sag. Large portions.  Service is outstanding.  Lunch tends to be much busier than dinner time.  They can be a little slow settling the check but you food does come out pretty fast.
2017-10-17,3,We came here for the lunch buffet on Sunday. It was okay. We were disappointed by the limited selection of items. Our favorite was the goat curry and the rice budding. Everything else was just meh. The Basmati rice was a bit too watery. The chicken was simply just fried chicken. The curries blend in together. It was a very popular place, but we've had better.
2017-10-12,2,This review is about their Lunch Buffet only- 1 chicken entree, 3 vegetarian entrees, 1 chicken app, 1 veg app, salad and chutneys with 1 kheer dessert. $10 for such a small variety was hard to believe. The naan was cold and then they ran out and didn't refill for nearly 10 mins, by that time my food was cold to even eat it with naan. I came from Journal Square area because I heard great things about this and was disappointed with the food choices and the flavor, the Chicken Tikka Masala was actually kind of sweet and the paneer dish was bland and cold. I would maybe come try this place by ordering off the menu but someone would have to suggest the place to go. Best part of the meal was the Tandoori Chicken- soft and moist and flavorful. Naan was thick and cold. I would suggest adding more items and keeping food warm and maybe serve fresh naan (garlic and butter) to the table. Even a dollar extra would make sense then for that much but $10 for the food there was not worth it. I ended up going somewhere else and eating to fill myself to satisfaction.
2017-10-08,5,We had some guests from Mumbai recently. They were wanting familiar food so we took them to Karma Kafe and it did not disappoint. 10/10 rating from our guests. Hoboken is lucky to have this place!
2017-10-08,2,Went there because the reviews. Nice service, and nice spread. However this was the blandest indian food I have ever had. We had a few bites and left. With that being said, it may be more suited to western pallets.
2017-09-28,4,We are trying to eat fish at least once every week and we chose to go for Karma Kafe's Tandoori Fish. This was my second time at Karma Kafe and I can honestly say ta not going to be my last. The tilapia was amazing - soft, succulent and absolutely delicious. It wasn't spicy, which is how I usually like my fish - but it was delicious nonetheless. The fish comes with a small bowl each of rice and dal. Our server gave us a $7 off a starter coupon which is great. But honestly, I had decided that I'm gonna come back even before he gave it to us. The server also suggested we go for the Tandoori Salmon - which I think is not on the menu. So I know what I am going to eat next time.
2017-09-27,5,Everything is good about this place; food, ambience, location and yes food.We tried lamb korma and chicken tikamasala, with kabob platter as appetizer and all were cooked to perfection. The service might seem a little slow but we were not in rush and we enjoyed our time.
2017-09-26,3,Decent food, can't compete with Jackson Diner. But being located in Hoboken, it's as good as it gets! A few things that did not go well:1. Fried fish- you're a step away from serving a delicious Fish Curry. Why stopped there? Put some curry sauce that will prevent those fish cutlet from drying and getting cold. 2. DO NOT LET PEOPLE USE THE SAME PLATE TWICE. there's literally 2 nasty peeps I saw chowing down on their plates on line at the buffet to refill them plates. The tongs touched their food. It's FREAKING GROSS.  Please observe, NEW PLATE every time you go to the buffet. There was this Chinese dude eating in front of the buffet bar on line then refilled his plate. JUST PLAIN UNSANITARY! 3. French fries called Desi Fries? Seriously???4. Caesar salad on an Indian buffet? You gotta be kidding me!!!! The rest was not bad. Will come back IF you require fresh plate every trip to the buffet bar.
2017-09-25,3,We were craving Indian food yesterday so after reviews lots and lots of reviews of the different options in Hoboken, we decided on Karma. The portions were pretty generous (the SAMOSAS are HUGE!) but they really skimped out on the rice. We got an order of CHICKEN MASALA and the LAMB VINDALOO (incredibly spicy) and we couldn't eat anymore after the rice was gone because the vindaloo was so spicy. Spicy, but delicious. The prices are a bit up pricey for me, and I've def had better Indian food. The samosas were a bit on the salty side, but I like the sweet brown sauce and the green sauce they give you. NOTE: If you're ordering delivery and you want a small portion of MANGO CHUTNEY, just write a note in the "Instructions" space. However, it's pretty small and you probably just want to order an actual order of it. I didn't see a it on the menu though so might have to just call them and order. Our food took over an hour to be delivered, but it was still pretty hot when it was delivered. I read some good reviews about the buffet so I'll have to try that sometime.
2017-09-23,5,On Fri evening we were roaming near Hoboken boardwalk.We were searching for Indian cuisine and then we came across karma kafe it truly stands for its name. The best dish for me was vegetable biryani. I love to go there again as the ambience and crowd was awesome and in day time they provide buffet too. Don't waste your time and try and you won't regret. Keep eating stay healthy.
2017-09-21,5,Great place, fresh food and amazing buffet.Will go again and again. Very nice stuff and great value. The fact that the buffet is also on the weekend is great.
2017-09-15,5,Delicious Indian cuisine! nice atmosphere. Went there for diner last night food and service was great. Definitely coming back!
2017-09-04,3,Food is okay, bad vegetarian options and price for vegetarian buffet is same as NV, which is not too pricy. I had salad with mint and mango chutney other than these all others are unhealthy options. It's kind of only Indian restaurant near by, which is great advantage to them. I would recommend to try once and decide if matches your taste. Tandoori is very artificial too much color coating. I would be nice if they cook healthier‍
2017-08-29,5,First time eating at an Indian restaurant. LOVED IT! Already making plans to come back. Got the potato and pea samosas as and app and the mixed chicken kebabs for my entree.
2017-08-27,5,One of the best Indian food in Newport/Hoboken area... the portions are huge and decadent. I highly recommend the goat curry.. it was cooked perfectly and reminded me of authentic muglai cooking.
2017-08-25,5,Amazing food, very friendly staff, terrific prices. We love this place!!Best deal in town is the lunch buffet.
2017-08-25,5,It was our first time coming here and all i can say is delicious. The place is cute and very clean. They have indoor and out door seating. They serve adult drinks which is always a plus for me. The service was fast and all the staff were very attentive. Perfect place for a relaxed date night. Now to the food...we started with samosa chaat as an appetizer. As an entree we ordered palak paneer and the onion kulcha with raita. This was enough to share and we even had leftover. The food was so fresh and flavorful. I am picky with Raita bc not everywhere makes it good but this one has become one of my favorites. When we finished, the server packed everything up nicely and even provided us with a little extra raita. Hands down this little gem was wonderful.
2017-08-19,4,Went there for a buffet. They have descent  options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarian but limited deserts which was a turn off. Otherwise, the food was delicious and well balanced spices.
2017-08-16,5,I always get the same things when I go to Karma.  I love the vegetable jalfreezi, chana palak, and naan.  The samosas are awesome too but they are enormous so make sure you're hungry!
2017-07-31,5,Everything was delicious and great recommendations! The Bhulan Mootan (goat) is one of our favorites, especially when it's on the Weekend brunch menu.
2017-07-29,4,I really enjoy the food at Karma Kafe and always order home delivery (which arrives on/before time, kudos). Some of my favorites include their chicken biriyani, malai kofta, samosa Chaat, aloo bhindi and tandoori fish. Yesterday, I ordered something new and the dish was not up to the mark for what I would expect from this place. I decided to ring the restaurant to provide feedback and to my surprise (& delight) the manager offered me to try any other dish to my like on the house and delivered to my home. Thanks Karma Kafe, you surely retained my loyalty with such customer service!
2017-07-02,5,Good good good good customer service. Excellent food. Nice environment. Absolutely love it!!!!
2017-06-28,5,My boyfriend and i come here so often they probably recognize us lolWe used to come here for buffets; we still do. Price is reasonable and food is always on point. I really enjoy the selections they have. Came here for dinner the first time and really enjoyed it so we decided to have dinner here tonight. Decided to change up the orders instead of sticking with the norm. We got chicken tenders for app, (wasnt anything different compared to other places but flavor was nice) the mutton curry for my bf and i got the tandoori fish. Everything was on point for us just like the buffet, even better. 5 stars because of consistency and quality.
2017-06-21,5,The lunch buffet is really great and is super affordable. It's different each day of the week, my favorite is the fish tiki masala on Fridays
2017-06-19,5,Came here for Father's Day 06/19/17 around 1pm.  To our surprise it was buffet style, which ended up to be great.  I assume this runs until 4pm.  A generous selection of all you can eat fresh, HOT and delicious foods to choose from for only $11.95.  I would suggest coming around 2pm or so to avoid the crowd, because at 1pm it was packed with a 20 min wait.  Another great experience at Karma Kafe.
2017-06-10,5,They have a great vegetarian menu and even accommodate vegans. The servers are all very nice and helpful. The vegetarian dishes are so good. Honestly I think this is my favorite indian restaurant. I've been to several in NYC but no one can compare to Karma Kafe's veggie biryani. The best biryani no questions.
2017-06-08,5,Karma Kafe is quickly becoming my favorite restaurant. Being a regular at the weekday lunch buffet, I have to convince myself to not eat here every day of the week. Not only is each dish more delicious than the next, but the lunch buffet is by far the best deal in the area.
2017-06-07,4,Very tasty although not spicy enough for me! Nice choices in the buffet brunch, very reasonably priced. Service depends on who you get, from cranky to friendly. Will be back!
2017-06-03,5,Been coming for 8 + Years . Hands down the best Indian food you could find . Service is extremely good. They make sure the customer is completely satisfied . Felix is my go to guy at the restaurant. Try the butter chicken I assure you haven't had butter chicken like this anywhere in the tri- state.
2017-06-03,5,One of the best Indian food I have had in the United States. My husband and I were here for dinner and enjoyed the Paneer Makhani and Vegetable Jalfrezi. The Peshawari Naan was soft and very fresh. Friendly staff who recommended pairing of curries. Brownie points for excellent decor and great taste in food presentation.
2017-06-02,5,Just go here, stop thinking about it. It WILL NOT disappoint! Love this place, their staff are super friendly! Get the Samosa chaat and coconut Lassi  they also offer buffet service during lunch time!
2017-05-29,5,Awsum food both Veg and Non veg..also they opened for us beyond thr closing time. Do try karma aloo..They made our new york trip fantastic
2017-05-22,5,Best indian entrée and dessert. Try the mango lassi, one of the finest I had in a long time. They also have lunch buffets just for 10 bucks, so a good option to try a variety of Indian meals.
2017-05-19,3,used to love it, it has had always a great menu, and service was always consistent. BUT After it was re-opened after fire, food is now bland, and portions got smaller.Something certainly changed!
2017-05-14,4,The food is very good, and well priced. If you can make the lunch buffet during the week, it's an amazing deal. Things were not quite as spicy as my wife and I like, but once we got some chili sauce and salt, it was fantastic. We will be back!
2017-05-11,5,It's so good and the buffet is a great deal.  We have been coming here for 15 years......great quality and very consistent
2017-04-17,5,This was our first time having food from here, we got it delivered. It came in under 30 minutes which was extremely surprising and I was very pleased just from that. We both ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, had samosas and an order of plain naan. The portions were a generous size, the samosas were HUGE compared to what we've gotten from other places. Great flavors in everything! I'm excited to dine in next time around. Wound up ordering two orders of samosas not realizing it came with two per order so we have extra but that just means we have some for tomorrow! Loved everything!!
2017-04-08,1,Stopped by after work last night. Very dissatisfied I ordered Tandoor chicken, not sure if it was leftovers​ from the buffet . Extremely dry very very disappointed! I had looked forward all day 2 have it a very good (Indian friend) of mine recommend it. I guess I will have to school him on good Indian food!!! NYC Boardway (70's) J,ersey City! Would of been happier w/ Mc.Donald's.Sorry, could of just been a bad day. .
2017-04-07,5,The food was awesome. portions are big, I ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees for 3 of us and we couldn't finish. Ate the rest the next day and just as good.... if you ask for mild, it's actually mild, not like most Indian restaurants that burn a hole in your mouth. Service was great. Will go again. Very easy to get to. Only 15 minute walk or a $5 uber from the path.
2017-03-31,5,I've been searching for great Indian Food ever since I moved here 3 years ago, and finally found it!!!!  This place is great.  The staff is super friendly and attentive.  The food was delicious.  We both had the chicken tikka masala and garlic naan- both amazing and a glass of wine. We will definitely be back!
2017-03-24,4,I was very impressed with Karma! My roommates and I went- 2 familiar to Indian food and 1 very new. We ordered chicken dishes and were very impressed with the serving size and presentation. Each of us had enough food to take a full meal to lunch the next day. The serving staff was very nice and friendly, willing to make accommodations for us. Although we didn't drink, their specialty cocktails looked very good including a mango mojito. I think next time we go back we'll try some drinks as well.
2017-03-23,4,I am not a big fan of Indian food but my boyfriend likes it a lot. I really like the samosas (tastes delicious) some of the best samosas I've ever tried. If I'm going to get anything it usually is the tikka masala which is pretty good. I don't like their basmati rice too much. It doesn't have any flavor to it. I do like their nan bread which pairs nicely with the masala. Overall this restaurant is better than the other Indian restaurants in town. If you like Indian food this is the place to go.
2017-03-21,5,Best Indian food you can get in Hoboken/Jersey City area. Get Chicken Korma with a side of naan. Heaven.
2017-03-19,5,Superb indian food. Ordered in a couple of times, ordered their biryani, chicken tikka masala and shrimp tikka - all nice. Their naan is delicious too. Good value for money (huge portions) and good service. Definitely one of my fav indian places around hoboken!
2017-03-15,4,Maybe it's due to some odd devotion to another Indian restaurant in Hoboken, which closed years ago although it was excellent, but I've been holding off on writing a review for Karma Kafe for what seems like years. I have frequented Karma Kafe multiple times in the past 5.5 years, and I'd say most times it has been quite consistent: Good service, flavorful food, generous dishes (enough leftovers for a full meal), and a nice environment.The most recent visit was a few months ago with my boyfriend. Karma Kafe was closed for about 8-9 months as a result of a bad fire in the building. I was afraid they weren't going to reopen but the construction gave me hope. At some point they put up a sign saying they are going to open soon and I got really excited, we made sure to come here shortly after they reopened.The restaurant looked even better than it did before the fire, but with a very similar set up. When we came in it was still somewhat early for dinner, unless you are an "old" person like us, so there were a few empty tables but they all filled up by the time we left. We were seated almost immediately and got the menu.I can't recall the previous menu but believe it was almost identical to the current one. We split the veggie tikkas, garlic naan and I got my regular order of Vegetable Jalfrezzi. The food was delicious and the service was consistent.I probably take this place for granted, but it's definitely nice to have a good Indian restaurant close to where I live.
2017-03-11,4,Very good food and plenty of it when you order in. I ordered out once and the amount was significantly reduced. The quality was good though, escept the specialty bread tasted a bit stale though. The lamb dishes are delishious. The brown dipping sauce is excellent. The wait staff is excellent and attentive. No need to expect cold food here or the wrong order. They are very polite. The decore is cheery and very clean. The music is not too loud. It fits the mood. I can communicate with my meal partners and not over hear the next table.The lighting is just right. Able to read menue, see food and the person across from me. The tables are very close to one another but can be overlooked.
2017-03-05,2,I loved the food once I was there for dine in, last week.....And ordered yesterday night around 7-8 items from menu for home delivery but I was really disappointed because none of the dishes were good and everything was below expectations....
2017-03-03,1,Great food. Wonderful spices. Found a fingernail in my pakora dish though. Not my favorite.
2017-03-01,5,Amazing buffet. Selection is on the lesser side but the quality definitely makes up for it !
2017-02-11,3,This review is for delivery only.Overall our meal was pretty good but I will definitely need to update this review with after a dine-in experience. We got the appetizer sampler to get a taste of a bunch of things. Nothing really stood out, but everything had a good tatse. We also ordered veggie samosas and some lamb, all of which hit the spot. I got the sense that Karma Kafe would be a great spot for a sit down dinner as well and hopefully I get to try that in the future.
2017-02-09,5,Love love love the food!! They never disappoint, from dining in to delivery I can always count on a delicious meal. The buffet is well organized not tons of options but enough and everything is so good (I rather have all great selects then a few). So happy they opened back up great spot!
2017-02-04,5,Ive been living in Hoboken for a little over a year and missed my opportunity to try Karma Kafe last year due to the unfortunate fire that put them out of business for almost a whole year. They reopened a few months back and I decided to try it out since I always see it packed. My fiance and I went over and ordered more than enough food for two people. I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment. Amazing service and incredible food. I am middle eastern and have a love for Indian cuisine, this surpassed my expectations and i will definitely be back. Thanks Karma!P.S. they serve alcohol so no need to bring your own .. great selection of drinks.
2017-01-24,5,Best Indian food in Hudson County.  Naan was delicious.  Saffron sauce amazing.  And the guys in there are really cool and help you order the best options for you.
2017-01-15,4,Best Indian food I've had in year!! Make sure you make a reservation because they were packed on a Friday night. Started out with paapri chaat a fried deliciousness medley of chickpeas potatoes and onions.  I then had the lamb biryani which was amazing! My husband had some chicken madras which he really enjoyed. Our friends got the lamb bhuna which they raved about! The garlic naan was the best I've ever had, incredibly fluffy and flavorful. This restaurant is worth the trip!
2017-01-11,2,I love your food and the staff is nice. But PLEASE, for the love of health and hygiene, PLEASE don't allow patrons to bring their dirty dishes back up to the buffet to refill! The serving spoons touch their used plates, it's so gross and it is a health hazard, especially during cold and flu season.
2017-01-08,2,I am so sad to write this, but unfortunately since the place burned down and reopened the food changed completely... this use to be my favorite Indian restaurant in HOBO, but this time I ordered the food was sooooo salty... the saltiest saag paneer I have ever had in my life... the cheese naan was good( like before) but the papadam was super spicy ( it used to never be spicy and burned)  I am giving them 2 stars because the naan was good, but they need to improve to gain their clientele back...Sorry Karma, please re-hire your old chef...
2017-01-08,5,If you enjoy a casual tikamasala this place is for you. Vindaloo is hotter than a whore in church, and the tandori shrimp will have you feeling some type of way. The Nan will also get your peppies turnt. I'm showed.
2017-01-07,2,Such a huge disappointment in food quality. As an Indian I expect the basics of the food right especially when ordering from an Indian restaurant. Rotis ( Indian flat bread whole wheat) were raw inside and were more a huge blob of dough. Daal which comes as a side was more a broth than anything else lacking basic flavoring. When I called the restaurant back complaining that my child couldn't chew the roti I was told next time when you order we will send you free roti. Which means I have to spend another $50 for food to get raw rotis again. I expected them to take their rotis back and return the money back for those as they were non edible. Very disappointing
2017-01-05,4,The food is really good but a little spicy. The service was fast, and a lot. I really recommend this place if you like spicy meals. Go for it guys!
2017-01-03,5,No need to worry about this place changing when it was being fixed after the fire above it.  Karma is back at 100%.  Absolutely delicious.  One of my favorite places if not my top place in Hoboken.  It is that good!  Have been in several times since they reopened and also ordered delivery several times, perfect consistency every time.  The best.
2016-12-30,5,This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Hoboken and Jersey city. They have take-out down to an art form (flawless) and their in-house service is great. Not the healthiest options, but their korma snd tikka are delectable. They were closed for quite a while due to a fire and were severely missed. Their menu is on regular rotation in our home.
2016-12-25,4,The best jalfrezi I have ever had. The good thing about Karma kafe is the veggie comes with dal and rice. The quantity is also decent. I love coming here for comfort food. Only thing is, curries were oily and whole wheat paratha was NOT whole wheat (see picture)
2016-12-24,5,Really tasty food!! Paneer makhani was just amazing. Very rich flavor but not very spicy. Veggie Tikki was a bit oily but still very good. Strongly recommend this place. One of the best Indian restaurants in and around Jersey City.
2016-12-16,1,do not order delivery from karma kafe--we ordered via grubhub, and we waited for over two hours and it never came, so we finally gave up.  karma kafe's phone number did not get answered.  they owe me $60.
2016-12-14,5,So I order Indian food a lot. It is probably my top 3 types of food. I only ordered delivery, so I cannot rate the actual restaurant dining experience.The shrimp Malabar was amazing. Richly flavored. It had this lemon zest with coconut flavors. Lots of shrimp were included.The roasted garlic naan was nice and soft.The samosas were huge. You could get potatoes and peas or ground chicken and peas. I got the potatoes and peas. So yummy. The green sauce that comes with it is refreshing. The chicken Tikka masala was fantastic. Very flavorful. Lots of chicken. Not too heavy. It was a garlic tomato sauce. The meals came with basmati rice and dal, which I think is kind of soup, similar to lentil.I will absolutely order from here again. It only took about 40-45 minutes to arrive. I may try to dine in at this place.
2016-12-05,5,I'm so glad that they finally opened up after a long break of more than 6 months. I missed their kadhi pakora and paneer makhni so needless to say that those were the first dishes that I ordered and was so happy to find that the quality hasn't been compromised. This place even offers lunch specials.
2016-12-04,1,My wife accidentally ordered from them again and it took over 2 hours again. Can't make this stuff up. Food arrived bland and cold to boot. Strong stay away.
2016-12-01,5,Karma is back! and I couldn't be happier.  This has long been our favorite Indian place in town and it has been sorely missed while closed due a fire in the neighboring building.But now it's back - and of course, we were there on opening night. Food at Karma is always great.  On our most recent visit we ordered our favorites - papri chaat, paneer makhani, and chana palak with naan.  Everything was great - this restaurant has been consistently good over the 10 years that we've lived in Hoboken.The atmosphere is cozy and casual and the service is always efficient.Take out is great too, but be prepared to wait at least an hour for your order.
2016-11-19,4,This place was closed for 9 months and just re-opened as of 11/17/2016 due to a fire in the building. This place does not disappoint! Chicken tikka was delicious and if you love naan, then definitely order the bread basket of it which allows you to try 4 amazing flavors!
2016-11-18,5,Karma is back and looks great and improved! Probably the best lunch special And buffet in town. The food seems authentic (I'm not from India) and incredibly tasty and fresh. I'm writing this review after speaking with the owner and hearing about the troubles with the fire. Apparently she kept staff on the payroll as they were closed. Bravo !
2016-10-28,3,This restaurant is closed due to a fire, where are these people getting these reviews from? And when I called for delivery a mild tone voice said they don't have delivery. Really so what's really going on here?
2016-09-29,4,I have ordered food for delivery. It came within an hour. Impressive because it was a rainy day.I think they don't know how to make veggi samosa. It was tasteless. Malai kofta was very good and garlic naan too. They give you rice and daal with the order of any curry.  Hope that they will improve the receipe of veggie samosa.
2016-09-21,5,Amazing restaurant. One of my favorite in town. I am eager to eat there again when it reopens! I was recently in Paris and as I sat under the Eiffel Tower I was actually dreaming of eating at Karma, and that just reminded me how much I love it.Delicious food, great service, all the servers are very relaxed and attentive. I always recommend the lunch buffet! Great place can't wait to get back.
2016-09-01,5,The best indian food in hoboken, when are you reopening!!!!
2016-07-13,5,I never realized how much I loved this place until, unfortunately, the building caught on fire and the restaurant was forced to close temporarily. It's been almost 6 months since I've had Karma Kafe and I find myself craving the chicken madras and tikka masala multiple times per week. I've tried ordering from other Indian restaurants in the city during the week for lunch and nothing tastes quite the same :( Karma Kafe- please come back soon!
2016-07-09,5,Despite the cheesy name, their food rocks. One of my all time favorites in Hoboken. So happy they'll be back in the (hopefully) near future after suffering damage from a fire in adjacent building.
2016-06-12,1,Stop yourself and don't even think of going to Karma Kafe. Control your taste buds if you are craving for Indian food. Karma Kafe had their kiosk in Hoboken Art festival today. They had most unfriendly staff and I had to give directions to give me my parcel in bag, ask for spoons and paper napkins! Besides they listed their items in menu as Chicken combo and Veg combo. A chicken combo usually includes chicken curry and a vegetable curry. However they only had the chicken curry as part of it. I wonder why they called it a combo. The chicken curry was too sweet and no spices. Felt like eating chicken marinated in yogurt but zero spices or salt. Worst part was their box was so substandard quality and the guy didn't close it properly. Some of curry spilled inside the bag before I noticed and locked it nice! I don't recommend them. There are many better Indian restaurants in Newport.
2016-02-25,5,Really good food. Ordered for delivery multiple times and dined in a couple of times. Never disappointed.
2016-02-16,3,The Story: Came here with a big group for Indian buffet. Haven't had Indian food for well over a year. Food: They had an assortment of popular Indian dishes laid out. I just felt that the food wasn't as strong flavor wise for Indian food. We were lucky enough to catch fresh naan out of the oven. Decor:  Very small place. Charming. Sits maybe 30 people. Price: $11.95 for weekend lunch buffet, $9.95 for weekday. Service:  Service was okay. I had to ask for water multiple times and they screwed up our check.Parking & Finding the Place: Parking was horrible! First finding a parking spot was like pulling teeth, then the parking meter didn't take my credit card and it was below zero outside! Additional Thoughts/Tips:
2016-02-05,3,My last few visits for the weekday and weekend buffet have been disappointing. I thought the food on the buffet was a little lackluster and lacked any innovation or zing. The star of the meal which the Karma Kafe buffet was known for - chicken koftas is now missing completely from the buffet. Instead it's being substituted for Achari Chicken - meh. Rest of the dishes include Saag Paneer (good), Fish tikka masala (very good - like a butter chicken but made of fish!), aalo gobhi (meh), tandoori chicken (not impressed), tava vegetables (deep fried potato and okra as an app -okay) and medu vada (very good).The quality of the naan has improved tremendously, but some of the best dishes like the koftas, pav bhaji and chicken biryani are all absconding. Delivery is still good - see my detailed delivery review in the previous update. They do have great vegetarian options on their ala carte menu - like the aaloo chole (banging) and kadhi pakoda (excellent), so it would be great if they added some of those options to their buffet to give it a face-lift.
2016-02-04,4,I was staying at the W and craving Indian food. I ordered several of their items for take-out. Service was fast and friendly. Everything was really good and totally hit the spot.
2016-02-02,5,New to Jersey City, I decided I wanted to have Indian food. As I went through the choices near my hotel, I came across Karma Kafe. I needed to have the food delivered and was a little worried about the quality of food. No need to worry! Everything was delish! First, great portion size. Secondly, and most importantly, everything was soooo good. I ordered the samosa chat, palak paneer, and raita.
2016-01-24,5,Love this place.  The food is amazing and I haven't had a bad experience here yet.  They have reliable delivery...including going to two places during Jonas and delivering food in the 18" of snow.  Simply great food and great service.
2016-01-13,4,A new indian cafe I explored today..Went here for lunch buffet..Karma cafe has good options for veg and non veg both.. I believe in trying out new things so you will definitely find something different here..
2016-01-09,5,We've been eating here for like 4 years now and it's absolutely delicious. We've catered food for an event from here before and they were super helpful and the food was delicious. All the guests loved it! The spinach with chickpeas and Chicken biryani are my favorites. The kebob platter and of course chicken tikka masala are also reallllllly good.Service is always accommodating, courteous and efficient! Will be going here for a long time.
2016-01-02,5,For the third year in a row, we've gone to Karma for Christmas Eve dinner. Throughout the year however, we go all the time. We're a big fan of their lunch buffet throughout the week. It's fair priced and the offerings are always tasty. My wife's favorite is the Chicken Tikka Masala and mine is always the Lamb Korma. The Garlic Naan is delicious and so is the Raita. It's a bit small in the restaurant itself but the food is well worth it.
2015-12-24,3,Half of the of the food was great and half of the food was ok to not so good.  The potatoes in the weren't well done.  The samosas were okay.  The rice was great!  So was the garbanzo beans with the sauce.  I'm not sure I'm a fan yet.  I may give it another chance.  I ordered out.  Perhaps it would be better if ate in.
2015-12-19,1,Highly disappointed .stale food !  We reached towards the end of buffet . Everything was almost over . We still are as we didn't have any other option . Then we found any hair in the food! Ok forgiven . After 15 mins of eating my stomach was literally churning .. Cramps like I've never had before in my life . I was in such pain ! Had to rush home . This was first meal of the day so it can be only attributed to this food . Don't know what was in that food but won't return
2015-12-15,1,This was the first genuinely disappointing Indian food experience I've had in this area. Delivery was fast, and I was starving, so I was incredibly let down on digging into the lamb vindaloo I ordered to find that it was all bone. I mean, about as close to 100% bone as it could be without there being any meat at all. Of course, more likely than not you won't get boneless meat when ordering Indian, but when you're digging through a pile of curry and bones ultimately scraping up what amounted to one cube of meat at any of the Indian places a mile away in Jersey City, you should be embarrassed for your business. That entire section near Journal Square has about 5 blocks worth of great Indian places, and I've never been ripped off from any of them.  I paid $30 for a container of bones last night; considering I'm not a dog who lives in a junkyard, that didn't do me much good, so I suggest you don't make the same mistake.
2015-11-29,5,Originally had a poor review due to an issue with delivery but this has now been resolved. The food is fantastic (Tandoori chicken is to die for) and we love this place.
2015-11-19,3,Food is tasty but delivery times are terrible. Always takes 2 hours for the food to arrive. I am less than 1 mile away from the restaurant. Avoid ordering online!!!
2015-11-16,5,My go to Indian spot in Hoboken. Dining in this place has a chill atmosphere with cool tabletops and simple decor. The staff is really cool and service is always great. Food is excellent and they have a good variety. Recommend the weekend afternoon buffet. You will not leave hungry or disappointed.
2015-11-02,5,This place is so charming, amazing customer service, and best of all... the food is AMAZING! Every time I go I try something different and have never been disappointed. I can honestly say this is my favorite place in Hoboken!! Two thumbs up!
2015-11-01,5,So good. Will make it a point to get back here soon! The Indian beers are pretty good. Everything here is delicious
2015-10-31,3,Ordered off of Seamless on a Friday night. We selected the kebab platter, the archari lamb and the saag chicken as well as a naan. The kebabs were good - preferred the lamb over the chicken. The archari lamb was spicy and flavorful. The saag chicken was tender. The naan was average and the daal was terrible. The basmati rice was good but too small. Will order from here again but will try a different bread and just chuck the daal.
2015-10-30,5,I've only been here for the lunch buffet but it was immaculate.  Although there is a handful of food options, they are all extremely tasty and there is ample meat and vegetarian options.  I recommend the rice pudding for desert and bonus points if you top your fruit with it.  Service was very quick as well, every time I got up to get food my table was plate free when I came back :).  Tables are also very close to one another so don't be surprised if you are in the middle of multiple conversations.Try it out ASAP you won't regret it!
2015-10-29,1,It was extremely bad. I had ordered malai kofta, mushroom matar and kheer. I had to throw away the malai kofta. It was horrible. Mushroom matar and kheer was ok. The food was delivered in one hour, which is the standard time for delivery. The food when we received, was hot, which is good. Just wondering how can a chef make so pathetic malai kofta.
2015-10-27,1,Filthy rude I saw staff  attack two men cause they requested there change back. I will never walk thru those doors ever again
2015-10-24,5,One of my favorite places in Hoboken. It never disappoints. Their prices are reasonable and portions are great. My favorites are the chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo. I've tried almost all the chicken and lamb dishes and can't really go wrong with any of them. The papri chaat appetizer is also great. The staff is friendly and helpful in explaining he dishes.
2015-10-23,4,I love this place!!! Seriously, one of my favorite places to eat in Hoboken!!!! All I can say is eat here!!!
2015-09-22,5,Best Indian/South Asian food in Hoboken and I'd have to include Journal Square, too, in my experience.  Outstanding appetizers and mains, and the portions are very large.  Two meals, usually.  Bag it up and take it home!  The weekend buffet is great and it is a bargain, and dinners are really good, with a full and diverse menu.  I well remember the old Akhbar on E. 58th Street and Anapurna in little India, and I'd say KK is their equal foodwise, though without the atmospherics.  Most/all cooking is done on premises -- the kitchen is actually there, not elsewhere! -- so torment yourself sometime and go to the alley behind Karma Kafe around 11:30 in the morning (that's Court Street at 5th Street).  The aromas are delightful!  There is one TV screen in the place (it's usually not audible but personally I despise TV when dining) but the crowd does get LOUD on Friday and Saturday nights -- my only real complaint.  Go some other time and you'll enjoy the experience.  Wholeheartedly recommend!
2015-09-19,3,While the food was mostly tasty - chicken biryani  and lamb curry (good)  with a vegetable appetizer (this was so-so- more like fried dough). The wait definitely  brought down my review.
2015-09-18,1,Order from here if you like waiting 1h 30 minutes for delivery and having the guy BS you and tell you it is "just around the corner"
2015-09-15,4,I ordered the Curried Lamb lunch box and was very pleased. Their curry was very flavorful but not so spicy that I needed to have my drink within reach. The lamb was very tender, the basmati rice was fragrant and fluffy. I ordered nam with my meal but could have done without it because the lunch portion was too big for me. The nam was warm, soft and just soooo fresh. I'm saving the remaining piece for my long ride back home. Next time I will dine inside only to get a better look at the interesting table tops. The prices and wait time were very reasonable.
2015-09-05,5,EXCELLENT! They have the best indian food, and it rivals that of the indian food on Brick Lane in London. Fantastic service too. The garlic naan is addicting.
2015-09-03,4,I have eaten at this restaurant for dinner at least a half dozen times over the past couple of years, pretty much whenever I am in the mood for Indian food. I was just there last night for saag chicken (very tasty) and lamb curry (delicious). One of my frequent dining partners likes the vindaloo so much that it is always what he wants to order. However, I find it a bit too hot and spicy for my tastes. I've never been for the buffet lunch, but the place is usually not too crowded in the evening for dinner. I've never had to wait for a table. There is also some outdoor seating for nicer evenings, though I wouldn't sit outside on a hot, sticky day.The portions are bountiful, and the prices are very reasonable. The naan is out-of-this-world good!
2015-08-30,1,I was always a fan of their food until my most recent experience. Ordered my favorite Kashmiri Chicken and when I was serving it I found a dead insect floating in the curry. I was very disappointed and called the restaurant and to my surprise the guy on the phone did not even apologize or seemed bothered by what I told. He asked if I wanted the order resent or a credit for it. That is unacceptable to me - if a restaurant is not as shocked as I am for such unsanitary food, I am never going back there again.To top it all haven't received any word on the credit also so will have to go through the hassle of working with seamless myself.They did lose a customer !
2015-08-27,4,Love their $10 lunch buffet! What an awesome deal! Food is delicious.
2015-08-16,4,Went here for curry before and it was just "okay." It wasn't spectacularly good or bad, so it was not very memorable. What is great however is their lunch buffet! I appreciate how they have meat and non-meat options. Everything is very tasty, although a bit spicy. I also loved how their buffet had fruits and a rice pudding for dessert. One thing I noticed is that it can be a bit difficult to get the waiter to get you a refill on water.
2015-08-02,4,Great food. Try malai kofta, kadi pakora - awesome and super flavorful!
2015-07-31,4,One of the most important things to me when writing a  review is price, and that being the case I'm knocking my rating down a star. But besides that, the food here is amazing. It's delicious and some of the best indian I ever tasted. Service is good as well, I highly recommend this place.
2015-07-30,2,Poor curry. Think Buffett style. Chicken tikka masala was very bland. Doesn't even come close to the currys you will find in London. Garlic naan and roti was pretty good though.  Think we'll try somewhere in JC next time.
2015-07-25,4,Cute little spot with indoor and outdoor seating. Had the buffet - not a wide selection but definitely quality food.
2015-07-24,3,The tomato soup was very average. The bombay shrimp and chicken drumsticks were drenched in oil and dint taste good.The lamb curry entree was good and biryani was mediocre.
2015-07-10,1,I don't see zero star for review that is the reason I am giving 1 star. The worst Indian food I had till date. We have ordered food for my friend birthday and everyone felt very bad once tasting the food. It is not a biriyani it is just masala rice. The chicken is really old. Looks they don't change the oil for chicken fry.. Chicken tikka masala is just like tomoto chuttny. Seriously we all hate the food. Its waste of money and very disappointment .. :(
2015-07-05,4,Usually I would go to Edison NJ for Indian food but today my friends and I wanted to stay around Hoboken so decided to give this place a shot. The place is sized as a typical Hoboken small restaurant, however they accommodate large groups by grouping tables around and there's a few tables outdoors which make it very accommodating. I went for the Sunday Lunch Buffet, the selection is not as great as other places in NJ but probably the best around the Hoboken area. They offered a few dishes mainly I was interested in the Chicken Tandoori, Lamb and Chicken Curry. The Tandoori is spicy and cooked well, the chicken curry was good and the lamb was really good. I would definitely recommend the lamb an chicken tandoori. I did find it useful that the naan was out on the buffet and I did not have to ask for it like most places. This is definitely my new go to place for Indian food in Hobo.
2015-07-04,1,Worst dinner. Samosa had no salt. Chicken curry tasted just like boiled chicken. Rice and daal are complimentary with the entree - rice was good, but daal sucked bug time. Wings hariyali which is  Chicken wings - was just okay. Naan was great. We are not coming back. The food is worthless for the quality and the taste!
2015-07-03,1,We have ordered from Karma Kafe a couple of times before. And so, we ordered food for home delivery last night for dinner. I was absolutely not expecting dishes filled with mostly oil! It's obnoxious amount of cholesterol that I must have consumed! We ordered yellow daal, bhindi aloo and palak paneer. Al soaked in oil. This has been my worst experience with them. I hope they pay attention to this post and mind the oil content as this is not at all acceptable.
2015-06-27,1,Great food. Just be ready for them to completely mess up your timing on delivery. They frequently are on the late end of Seamless time tables and today where 40 minutes late on their scheduled delivery. A real shame that they can't figure it out.
2015-06-25,4,Well I am not a expert on Indian cuisine however I do know what I like and what tastes good to me. We stopped in here for the lunch buffet so we could get a variety of dishes. They had the usual basmati rice, naan and tandoori chicken. Obviously those are very hard to screw up. I however had a delicious chilly gobi made with cauliflower which I helped myself to 3x. Palak Paanar a traditional spinach and garbanzo bean dish was great and a slopped it all over my naan. I really enjoyed the Dal!! I however am a fan of any type of lentil. But this was great it had a kick of spice and I loved the cilantro finish. What I really liked best was the texture some lentils were still whole and others almost mashed. I ate this like a soup, over my rice and also dipped my naan in the bowl. By far my favorite dish there. Vermicelli pudding was the choice I picked for dessert. I really am not a dessert lover and sweet sugar rice with raisins and almond bits just is not my thing. However it was not bad just not fit for my taste buds. This place is very cute and offers outdoor seating on a nice day. The price for the buffet was perfect. All in all great place!!
2015-06-25,4,The chilly gobi, an Indo-Chinese cauliflower stew with peppers, was probably the best dish I've had in a long time. The cauliflower, my forever nemesis, was very tender and soft. It was a texture contrast to the thin sauce and the crunchy green peppers.      The tandoori chicken was terrible. The meat was dry (like the waiter's personality), the spice rub was too spicy even for an Indian food lover like me, and the chicken skin looked like a Victor Frankenstein experiment gone awry. I was under impressed because it is considered their best dish. Really? That's your best dish?     The dal, a lentil soup, was delicious, however, my fellow diners didn't enjoy it as much as me. The soupy lentils was the perfect for the chewy naan. And that brings me to...     NAAN!!! The charred naan had the crustiness of burnt ends and the chewiness good flat breads should have.      Palak paaner is a traditional Indian dish of spinach and... you guessed it... cheese. Some people don't know that Indians make cheeses but weirdly enough, they do. Anyway, spinach with cheese is just not my thing so I ended up disliking this dish.     For dessert, we had vermicelli pudding with golden raisins and almonds. I, personally, didn't like it because of its odd texture. But my fellow diners wanted to bring some home.      I enjoyed the food we had today so I'm giving it 4 stars. I recommend going to Karma Kafe as soon as possible!
2015-06-18,4,Taste and portion side was good. Spice level was ok, more towards a palate of an typical american. Overall liked this place.
2015-06-17,3,The food is tasty but not an Indian restaurant that stands out. Definitely a good place for location and price.
2015-06-16,5,Good stuff.  Just had Veggie Samosas- awesome.  Everything else we had was good.  Spice, but not too much.  Environment is cool and super laid back.  Good wine list and service was just fine.  My new go-to place when I come to Hoboken for work!
2015-06-16,4,The food was really delicious with the right balance of spices . We ordered the papri chaat as an appetiser and had the veg jalfrezi and paneer makhani for the main course. The portions were quite large and came with dal and rice.The only downside was the service. We got served in dirty plates and the waiter was looking to get rid of us early since they were close to shutting time.Also the gratuity was included in the bill even though we were a party of just 4 which I thought was weird.I would definitely go there again though just because the food was great!
2015-06-14,5,Amazing indian food!!! Walking in there is a very cozy vibe. This is not a crowded or huge restaurant. It is perfect for a date or a small get together. The food was amazing!!! Fresh, tasty, not too spicy, just elegant and beautiful. I had the chicken Kashmir. I cannot tell you how great this dish is!!! Just the right amount of spice, rich, creamy, and a slight crush with the added nuts. We also had this coconut creme dish I don't recall the name off. It was also a great pic!! I recommend the saucy dishes if you are a dip extraordinaire like myself. Especially with the garlic Naan; warm with just the right amount of toast and garlic (not overpowering at all). But now to the drinks, for $9 a drink it is exactly what you crave. If they had a happy hour I would be there at least once a week. We had the mango mojito and mango pina colada. When I tell you I felt like I was on a beach drinking the breeze it was that amazing. Definitely going back!!!! Cheers Karma Kafe you are definitely unique!!!
2015-06-06,3,Maybe 3-1/2, but opting to round down to three stars as the food was good, but not spectacular.  Enjoyed their Chicken Tikka Masala.  It was a bit spicier than most I've had, but not too spicy (I'm a bit of a wimp).  The rice was good (usually is, but it is possible to make bad rice).  I thought the naan was pretty average (we had garlic and had mozzarella, the second of which was unique and good, but not amazing).  Overall, if you are in the mood for Indian food, this is a good choice.  It's not the most authentic, but the food is well prepared and mostly flavorful, and good value for the prices.
2015-06-01,2,Food was ok slow to come out to the buffet. ..however service  was horrible  worst service  I ever had  slow and didn't seem to care at all
2015-05-30,2,Tried veg buffet here. Not great food and very limited options.
2015-05-29,3,Ordered food from this place.. The madras chicken was really good . It was spicy and tasted great with nana and rice. The coconut chicken curry was Ok. It was not that spicy and was just OK.The portions were good. Good place for a good price !
2015-05-29,4,This is a good place. Tastefully done small place and serves sumptuous portions. I did kadhi pakoda here. It came with rice and dal ( dal was okay), but kadhi was good! They can get rid of the pakoda in kadhi. Sangria was fine as well. I liked it and would recommend y'all to visit once.
2015-05-25,4,Fairly decent food, good portions. Especially loved their tandoori roti. Please order well in advance though, they take an hour to deliver on weekends.
2015-05-21,5,Thank you Mr. Daroowalla!!! This place is awesome!!! If you're within a five radius of Karma Kafe (and you're hungry) - you need to go here! Food is well balanced in flavor, the naan is HUGE, and the service is what you'd expect from a restaurant in Hoboken. Thank you the great lunch experience!
2015-05-18,4,I've been to Karma Kafe on numerous occasions. In the process I've experienced everything from their lunch buffet to dinner to delivery. Every time, they follow through with a fantastic experience.The lunch buffet leaves nothing to be desired. They have a wide selection of food that left my omnivorous friend and my vegetarian self so satisfied that we practically waddled out of the place.The difference between eating there for lunch and dinner is the crowd. The lunch crowd is usually people from nearby businesses and some families with small children. It's usually not too crowded, too. During dinner you get an interesting mix and they have a tendency to be more crowded. The problem with that is that it can get loud pretty quickly inside. However, the outdoor seating area is nice and is usually a viable option.Delivery is the one thing they fall a little short on. I've ordered from them through seamless and waited for over an hour for the food. The food was delicious once I got it, but that wait just about did me in.The food is always fresh and delicious, and I like that they offer cocktails in addition to wine and beer. I'm not a fan of rum, but I highly recommend the mango mojito.
2015-05-14,5,When India on the Hudson closed down, my girlfriend and I were really sad about it -- I know we can make the short trek to Jersey City for Indian Food, but nothing beats delivery on days you don't want to cook. Karma Kafe has made their menu better and the quality of the food definitely shows it. Our favorite things to order are : Chicken Tikka Masala, Any of the Biryanis, of course the garlic Naan. You can never go wrong with their food. The Paneer Palak is also very good. My favorite though is the Malai Kofta. This is for someone who loves to have the really saucy stuff.
2015-05-12,5,I have only been for the lunch buffet but I love it.  It's a small place but the food is great and the price isn't bad either. :)
2015-05-07,4,I love this place. Granted, I'm still basically only eating the Chicken Tikka Masala (the General Tso's of Indian food), but the dish is well-spiced, tender and the dinner portion is enough for two decent sized meals. Still planning on testing out the buffet soon to see how their other dishes taste. Highly recommend.
2015-05-05,2,Pros: daL makhani and the veggie sampler is worth your buck. Other dishes esp. Chat is horrible. The ambience is nice but, the waiter had a very bad attitude .
2015-05-04,3,Simple indian place, good food, big portions, right price.  Service was weird as we had like 5 different waiters and at the same time we didn't have a waiter - if we wanted something we had to make it very well known we needed attention.  But it is a cute place on the strip and worth a trip.  Chicken Tikka Masala was excellent, the Naan was good.  We did order their special stuffed Naan and didn't like it, but the Garlic Naan was good.  And I got a lamb biryani which is how I test out all Indian places, and it was good, but they didn't remove the inedible and really hard spices so you got a couple surprises every now and then.
2015-04-29,5,I mainly come for their $10 lunch buffet. Love that that have a lot of vegetarian selections! Service is always excellent and consistent.
2015-04-29,5,Love this place. I took my boyfriend here to try Indian for the first time, and it was so good he now wants to go back when he's craving Indian. The naan is flurry, the tikka masala is mouth watering, and cocktails are refreshing and the staff is very attentive and courteous.
2015-04-26,1,Cramped place, with absolutely no options for vegetarians. I wouldn't come here again!
2015-04-24,5,This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Hoboken. The portions are huge, the staff are friendly, and it's always a great experience. I've come here many times in small and large groups and have never left disappointed. The buffet they have for lunch is also an amazing deal for what you get. Unfortunately, I don't get to experience it very often. My favorite dishes here are lamb Biryani, Naan, and Chicken Pakoras. They also have great drinks, and wine, including non-alcoholic drinks like Mango Lassi. If you order a lot, sometimes they'll even throw in a free dessert or an appetizer for next time.
2015-04-14,4,We regularly order takeout from Karma Kafe, which delivers consistently good food... the chicken Madras, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, plain naan, and veggie samosas, are our favorites. Recently we tried the chicken biryani, which was tasty but slightly over salted... and had a couple of bits of hard fragments (bone or shell?) so be careful when biting down... but I'd probably order it again and ask for less salt.We tried the chicken samosas which was much too salty and not very tasty. The potato filled vegetable samosa is far better. The Chana Kachumba salad (chickpeas, cucumbers, carrots) becomes too waterlogged - accumulating a lot of liquid, so I stopped getting it.If we're in the mood for Indian food in Hoboken, this is definitely the place for us.
2015-04-11,4,This Indian restaurant is a good one amid the sea of other restaurants on this street. My honey and I started with a samosa (very generously sized, I might add) and it was very tasty. I opted for the tandoori chicken wrap and my honey had the potato and chickpea curry with dal. The portions are very large, so I suggest sharing!
2015-04-11,4,Exceptional food. The buffet always has something new and different. The Lamb biryani is to die for also...i've been eating it for years now.
2015-04-07,5,Great food great decor and ambiance. I will be returning with a friend to try the lunch buffet.
2015-04-03,5,Karma Kafe serves superior quality Indian food, (... and probably the best in Hoboken). In addition, their staff are extremely professional and hospitable. If you stop in to order take out on your way home as I do on occasion, they will pour you a glass of water and treat you as though you're dining in while you place your order at your leisure and wait on your food to be prepared (which doesn't take long). If you live  in Hoboken and enjoy Indian food but haven't yet tried Karma Kafe, it's worth trying this restaurant.
2015-03-31,5,Chicken Biryani is the best i've had (other being Udaipur Trident hotel)!Chicken Kali Mirch (aka black pepper) is amaznig ..but the meat can be a lil overcooked at times.   everything else is ok but give it 5 star cuz they got these two things right and a trendy serving style with friendly staff.
2015-03-30,5,After pining for some Indian food for weeks on end, we decided to go to Karma to test the waters. I was not disappointed. We ordered garlic naan, butter chicken and chicken tikka masala. Everything was flavorful and evenly spiced. Not too spicy but not too mild. We will definitely visit again.
2015-03-18,5,The best bhel puri I've ever had, including in India. Addictive, crunchy, moist. Every time I eat Indian, I order the bhel puri hoping it will stack up. Nope
2015-03-15,4,Constipation Guaranteed buffet.Tastes pretty good but please stop putting constipation med in the food.Tried three times and same results.
2015-03-15,5,I came here for the first time for the lunch buffet on a freezing cold Sunday in January.  My boyfriend is Indian and he recommended this place.  He knows the owner and said he was just in love with cooking authentic Indian food and decided to open this restaurant and follow his passion.  It shows in the food - fresh and fluffy naan, fantastic authentic curries and great chicken tikka masala.  My favorite was the paneer palak, the spinach is so creamy and intriguingly spiced...just loved it!  The restaurant is also pleasantly decorated with inlaid tables and plush maroon velvet pillows.  The service was attentive with someone coming over to take away our plates almost the minute we polished them off.  Was stuffed when we left but can't wait to come back again.
