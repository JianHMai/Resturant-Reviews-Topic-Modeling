2021-10-31,1,No, no... just no. Had to stand for 20 minutes to wait for our order (aren't they supposed to give you a buzzer so you can sit?) Order was missing items. Food was meh. With all the wonderful places in Hoboken why come here? Don't.
2021-10-26,1,I ordered for pick up through Uber eats for myself - order was 15 minutes later than expected (total prep time of 30+ minutes). When I tried to inquire about the order I was treated like I was an inconvenience.  I felt as if I was being treated differently because maybe they thought I was a delivery driver, which is also concerning.
2021-09-16,1,Terrible wait time. Waited 30 minutes for a rapid pick up order. When we asked the status of the order the person in the back said he can't look right now because he was too busy. Turns out, it was ready and sitting on the counter in the back and no one gave it to us.
2021-08-06,1,Typically I like stopping into Panera and fortunately not all Panera's have the same policy. This Hoboken location refused giving me a cup of water and wanted to charge me for a fountain drink just for some water. Welcome to Hoboken. So many places to eat in Hoboken, take your business elsewhere as I did!
2021-07-22,2,Went here and ordered a WHOLE frontera chicken sandwich . There was absolutely no one in the store , waited almost 15 minutes and instead of packing one whole sandwich they had to pack two half's because they didn't pay attention that was a whole sandwich so I had to wait for them to make another half .. I wonder what happens when they're busy .
2021-07-13,5,As usual good comfort food! I like to order from here during the days I feel down or need something familiar. My favorites are the french onion soup and chipotle chicken avocado melt, I also like their passion papaya green tea.   I usually have my food delivered through the app Fetchstr. I found that it connects you more to your community and is easier on your wallet as well. I will link it below for easy access.link:https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fetchstr/id1014Â­044282
2021-05-27,5,I came here regularly during my 4 years at the nearby university. Great food, I especially love the soups and grilled cheese. Panera is pricey of course but this location has great customer service, they've offered me a free drink on a hot day on a few occasions.
2021-03-02,4,This place is straight-up a homeless shelter. Coffee is still pretty good, but I wish they would disinfect the booths better after the bums wake up and re-enter society.
2021-02-07,5,Nino the manager at this Panera bread location was so incredibly kind and helpful! He went above and beyond normal customer service standards to ensure we were happy. Can't say enough nice things about him!
2020-10-30,1,Horrible experience ordering delivery today.First, I got an email saying the order arrived, but no one ever called me to say it was here. It wasn't outside my apartment door. Then I went down to the lobby to check and it wasn't there either. Just as I started to call the store thinking my food was missing, the food arrived at our door, over 10 minutes after the email saying the food arrived had went out.Then, upon opening our food, the salad and sandwich we ordered were in there but we received the completely wrong soups from what we ordered. So, I called the store and spoke to the manager Rosemarie. She apologized and said she could not believe it happened and said "I am going to run it right up to you myself." Based on what she said, we were expecting the soups to be at our apartment in about 20 minutes. The soup didn't arrive until AN HOUR AND A HALF after the phone call with the manager. The manager threw in free brownies BUT one of the soups was STILL WRONG! Unreal. Our lunch was ruined by the mix up and the ridiculous wait. Will never do business with this branch of Panera again.
2020-05-02,1,So we ordered delivery today and I have to say it did come on time and food was decent. However one of the soups was missing and no utensils. I've been calling the store for over 2 hours and after waiting on hold for a minute or two it was hanging up on me. No way to leave a message or have a callback. I've tried calling corporate to get this resolved again no answer and over 30 min wait with no answer.  Manager please contact me to resolve this! I don't like leaving reviews like this but this store needs to get their employees trained and correct their mistakes.
2020-01-20,5,I think it's pretty cool that Panera has someone going around checking in with all customers. I work up the block and don't really see that much anywhere around fast food restaurants. Thanks Chris.
2020-01-12,2,I hope the manager and the corporate office sees this. I tried to provide feedback to the corporate office but there is no easy way to do so.   I placed an order at 2:17pm on January 12, 2019. Went to the restroom while waiting for my food and there was no toilet paper in either stall. I don't know how long ago the staff cleaned the toilet but for both stalls to not have any toilet paper left it must've been a long time.   When ordering at the kiosk, there is always a lack of buzzers. No one called out when our food was ready.  My Thai chicken salad didn't have ANY chicken in it. Service here just seems very much below par. The Newport mall location has much better service. It's a shame a Panera bread can't provide consistent service across all locations.
2019-11-19,1,This was a horrible experience. I ordered a baguette with my large mac and cheese and i unfortunately received a rock.
2019-10-15,1,Since working in the Hoboken area I have ordered from this Panera on several occasions and the service has gotten consistently worse.  My sandwich orders are NEVER as I've ordered and frankly the sandwiches look less than desirable.  The ingredients are not fresh either.  The sandwiches are falsely advertised.  What you see on the website is NOT what you receive and for the price it's disgusting.  Panera you have lost me as a customer.
2019-08-16,4,One of the better Panera experiences I've had. Everything I ordered was correct and was ready when I walked in.  What else can I say? They are what they are.
2019-08-07,1,Don't order catering from this location. They are always late, never call to explain and the never answer the phone when you call.  This has happened more than once.
2019-08-01,4,Always a positive experience every time I stop by this location. The workers are super friendly and the service is quick!
2019-07-30,5,I really like this location. The food comes fast and the man and woman who hand deliver your food to the table are extremely nice! I really appreciate that about a Panera.
2019-07-24,5,My experience with this Panera bread location has varied over the years, however, my experience today was excellent! The service was very friendly and helpful, my pastry was absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend trying the cinnamon bun but I don't know if I've seen there before. There is plenty of sitting there around lunch hour and plenty of people also sitting there on their laptops doing work. Overall the experience was efficient and enjoyable as a Panera can be. Very easy to get to you on Washington Street. You can also order online or on a panel if you are less of a people person. Also enjoying my Panera rewards membership, thanks for the free pastry for my birthday :-)
2019-07-01,4,Best Sandwiches for price point. You may run into crowds of kids during lunch time so I would avoid during these hours. Otherwise swing by anytime.
2019-06-17,4,I can honestly say, I always have a positive experience at Panera. Quick , tasty and convenient. Yes it is a chain , but sometimes you need a dependable " go to ."I generally go for breakfast and get a coffee and the avocado egg sandwich. Can't go wrong !
2019-06-09,2,My online orders have been cancelled twice and the place is pretty dirty not gotta lie. The food portions are also slightly smaller than other panera's i've been to. I've heard from people I know about them seeing mice here, and judging from other reviews they're right.
2019-05-16,4,I have lived in hoboken a long time and I have never been here. It is a big place and you can tell management cares about their business. They are cleaning things and making it look nice. I saw the manager even getting his hands dirty to ensure it was the best experience for the customer. The food was solid as well. I ate the corn chowder and the green goddess cob salad. I also tried the yogurt with fruit and granola. This isnt a michelin rated place but it serves a great purpose for the community. It offers a spacious place where you can get work done and eat good food af a fair price. There isn't much else anyone can ask for and for that I applaud you Panera!!
2019-03-05,5,I came here with a friend to relax on a cold day. I must say, their chai tea latte is bomb. Seriously. The best I had. Service is friendly and chill. I recommend going and drinking the chai tea latte.
2019-02-05,1,Very disappointed in my rapid pickup order which basically had half a spoon of tuna on my sandwich and barely any condiments and add on's I selected. What's the point of customizing if they are not honored? To top it off I couldn't even get thru to their phone number, nor could their corporate office when they tried to call. So much for "accuracy matters."
2019-01-17,5,Panera is truly my go to when all things fail. I specially enjoy the broccoli cheddar soup in the bread bowl. I do wish the bread bowls were the same seize always (bigger) but the quality in taste always remains. The bakery is fascinating and they offer really go dessert, treat options.
2019-01-05,1,I was leaving the women's bathroom and saw a mouse scurry underneath the door into the men's restroom. Totally killed my appetite.
2018-12-22,2,Everyone loves some good Panera food, but honestly this place isn't what every other Panera is like, from the service  to how long it too to get out food. Not to mention a server and a cook where sick and everyone's order was wrong. Sad.
2018-12-02,1,Service is hhhhorrible, and the place filled with homeless, terribly managed place
2018-11-13,1,It's been diminishing returns for me at this establishment located in lower Hoboken and I'll tell you why. Sometimes you just want to sit down and sip a hot coffee on your day off from work or on a weekend morning, unbothered, enjoying your alone time out of the house. Had I anticipated the noise that both Panera management and its customers emit I would have preferably ventured to Gregory Coffee at Newport or Exchange Place or the Starbucks on Newark St. Firstly, the music was turned almost all the way up which made it difficult for me to read while having a pastry and coffee. There is no escaping it. Headphones are in order because you will be driven almost crazy by the sheer volume of the music. To top it off, both the front and back of the establishment attract a bevy of shifty looking people who have no idea, or don't care, that they are bothering others with the noise their phones make while they mindlessly watch videos. It just dampens the experience. Panera on 310 Washington needs to address the situation. While folk music is pleasant it doesn't need to be so loud it almost feels like a bar. Aside from this, they should place signs encouraging customers to please listen to their videos of choice without having to share it with the entire locale. I've been to many Panera's around the country and this is by far the only one that lacks that courtesy to its customers.
2018-11-08,5,There service was amazing and very personal. They treated me with dignity and respect. The people who work there deserve 5 stars for their moderately delicious meal
2018-10-15,5,I love Panera! I love for their Mac and cheese, get the large because you will want more if you get the small.  They always have a great selection for pastries one of my favorite is the one with the cherry filling. Everyone is always very friendly and the place it always clean and welcoming. Their prices are very affordable. They also have rewards points and on your birthday you get a free pastries. Just love this place
2018-10-13,2,The food is decent, but the customer service and atmosphere are terrible.  It took 30 minutes to receive my salad, and they gave me the wrong order twice.  No apology, offer of a free dessert, etc.  While this location is slightly cleaner than it used to be, the trash is still overflowing, and there are a lot of kids running around.  Ok for takeout, but allow for extra time and double check your order.
2018-10-07,1,This place epitomizes everything that's wrong with chain restaurants.  The quality of the food is poor and overpriced, especially for the quality and quantity.  For example, the mac and cheese is mushy and gross, the sandwiches are far, far better if you go to any number of delis in Hoboken, and the apples are always bruised and old.  The people who work here don't care about their jobs, which is obvious considering that every time I have been here the tables are dirty and there are bugs flying around everywhere.  I'm done with Panera Bread.
2018-09-17,3,Today I order a sandwich and they didn't put it on the bread that was on the menu. It was crowded and I was hungry so I ate it the sandwich was good but I was disappointed as I like the Cranberry Walnut Bread. I also order a soup to go & when I got home it was not the one I ordered. I have been going to the Panera in Hoboken for years but I think it's time to retrain the staff including management because it's not being run as when it first opened.
2018-08-12,2,While they've improved over the past two years, their service and food are too inconsistent. My order is often filled incorrectly, requiring multiple visits to the service counter. Nevertheless, a quick go to for black bean soup, summer salad, or bread bowl. Debating whether it's worth the frustration.
2018-06-24,1,The guy preparing the food was angry and swearing. I've never heard a worker that angry. He was so angry and loud it made me nervous to eat the food. I don't think I'll be back
2018-05-08,1,I will never go to this Panera again.  I ordered catering which I go to pick up and they don't have any record of it.  They eventually find the order and don't follow my instructions on order.  Due to their inability to run catering orders properly I was 15 min late to a very important business meeting I was hosting.   They cost me business by their lack of organization
2018-04-30,1,Waited 5 minutes for service on a quiet mid morning, money in hand, as three employees and the manager pointedly ignored me. Finally went to Starbucks. Guess they don't need business.
2018-01-07,1,Walked into Panera to eat there, but couldn't find a clean table in the entire place to sit at. It looked as if the tables had not been cleaned all day. The walls even had food caked on them. We finally found a barely clean table to sit at and it was surrounded by homeless people and a woman who was clearly on drugs. The guy sitting next to me was eating anchovies out of can and was yelling at another homeless man at a different table for not liking anchovies. The employees preparing our meals had their hair barely up and back. The one girl had her hair basically down all in her face as she was preparing our food. Very disappointed because I like Panera, but this location is disgusting!
2017-12-03,3,Lots of seating in this location. The cinnamon scone was delicious. Perfect paired with a cup of coffee if you just want a place to chill.
2017-10-28,1,Great spot if you want to mingle with Hoboken's homeless community and eat processed food, they do do a good cheese bread and the bagels are ok, I never stay because of the above reasons
2017-10-18,1,10 minutes for a soup and sandwich TO GO combo and it's not busy . Here's the catch ...10/18/17Ordered 2 pastries and a baguette. Time ready 8:50pm, time now 8:59 still no order. For a ng organization I expected this was corrected from my prior visit.9:06 I got my order....partially as they ran out of what I ordered. I wouldn't have known if I didn't demand for my order. Get your closing shift act together.
2017-09-30,3,Friendly service and order came out correctly. I thought the place could be a little bit cleaner, and some of the patrons dining in were...interesting. Convenient location right in the middle of everything on Washington St.
2017-07-20,1,I am as compassionate as the next person, I really am. That is why i am. (Not was, am because I am here right now) by homeless people " just getting cups" and helping themselves to the sodas, water and ice teas! One guy even took a cup from the garbage to get water, another almost pout his mouth on the spout! Now in Hoboken the homeless population is out of control yet I am paying 8 $ not to see this...never again in Hoboken will I go to this Panera
2017-07-10,2,It's unfortunate because they literally can never get an order right. Then I saw this girl take a baggy with her hand and put it on the ledge of the pick up spot and then move it back on a plate. SO GROSS.. everyone who was waiting, including me, just looked at each other in disgust. I have said it several times this place is sloppy but now let's add unsanitary to the mix. Not ever returning.
2017-04-18,3,Be careful when sitting here... management needs to do something about the odd people who come in and yell at customers
2017-04-09,1,The Panera on Washington St. in Hoboken is full of very rough, sketchy, unclean-looking patrons. I'm not sure if they are homeless or even if they buy anything, but I wonder if management can do something about this? I see another Yelp reviewer had similar feedback; and I notice the problem is only getting worse. Today, there was a man rummaging through the garbage & wandering up to all the tables, and another woman talking to herself and touching all the straws & drink tops by the beverage center. I initially ordered my food to stay, but felt very uncomfortable eating there with all of this going on around me. My food arrived to my table and the mac & cheese was cold. I quickly ate it anyway, then got a to-go box for my salad. I dropped one of the boxes on the floor and an employee standing nearby looked at it, looked at me, then went back to his convo with his friend. Never mind that my hands were full & a little help would have been nice. Anyway, I bolted out of there as fast as I could only to get home and realize my Fuji Apple Chicken Salad was missing....CHICKEN!! So, I paid $12+ for cold mac & cheese and a salad with no chix. At least I got an iced green tea & a bag of chips for that price. Smh. Needless to say, this place needs to clean up its clientele, work on their food prep, and step up their customer service. Until then, I will not be going back.
2017-02-16,5,How can you go wrong with Panera?  I am soUpset they took the Asiago Roast Beef Sandwich off the menu.  One of the workers in the back overheard me and said, " Don't worry I'll make it for you".  Wow.  I was so happy!!!!  Love you Panera
2017-01-30,2,I was in on Saturday and I was planning to eat in but had to take my food to go. The food was fine, no complaints, but the eating areas were not good. I noticed a few people that seemed rough looking, maybe homeless, and that area had a smell that you would not want when trying to eat. I'm not sure if this can be controlled by management but I was disappointed.
2016-12-18,1,I visit  Panera bread cafe 1499 today in Springfield,  NJ. I usually visit the one in Clark,  NJ  twice a week for lunch.   My order was a large order of Greek quinoa salad  for $10.01,  it was not worth the price.  I was very disappointed and dissatisfied.  They forgot to add quinoa to the salad and Kale.  It was mainly lettuce & iceberg and 1/2 cup of olives.  And the bread they broke a piece with their hands and did not use a Knife, how sanitized.
2016-11-03,2,I'm sorry, I love Panera to death but the people that work here are rude!! They display wrong prices on their baked goods and then tell you it's a different price because of tax. I showed them my receipt and said it did not match the display price. The lady then said oh no it's the wrong label. Then why not tell me that before I purchase??? Why lie and say yeah that's what you're being charged- it's just tax!!?? Rude! Rude!!
2016-11-02,3,The employee who helped us was very nice but only packed 11 bagels in our "baker's dozen" order. We only noticed after we were home and were sorting the bagels.
2016-10-18,5,I wasn't really a Panera fan until I went this location. From the GM, managers, to Panera staff they are always great and treat all customers with a smile and remember everyone's names. The location is always clean and the food is always great. I highly recommend this location. You will never be disappointed.
2016-10-14,4,Spacious, plenty of room for people to do work or study. Has outdoor seating during summer months. Just like any other Panera. I have noticed homeless people wandering inside the last few times I stopped by to pick up food.
2016-09-23,3,Guy in the morning takes his time with orders. I don't really have patience but sometimes you need a coffee and Mediterranean egg wrap the woman that makes the sandwiches is very nice
2016-06-03,4,The location is clean and spacious. Whether you're there for a quick bite or just for the wifi, they have comfy stools, benches and tables. My go to for a healthier alternative to take-out. For about $8, they have a "pick two" deal that I love. If you're a cheese lover, the side broccoli cheddar soup and half grilled cheese sandwich will not disappoint. The food is made fresh, so expect a little wait.
2016-05-20,2,I go to this location very often and for the first time in maybe 2 years I had an unpleasant experience. I was placing my order with the person at the register and told him I wanted a salad and pasta combo, but with a large salad. He said that wasn't possible but in a very rude way, like he was really mad at me for saying that. I was confused cause I always get that, than I said I wanted my pasta to be the Mac and cheese. Again he got really angry and said "Mac and cheese isn't pasta". I don't know where he comes from but Mac stands for macaroni and that is pasta. The cashier on the next register looked at us and was shaking her head and looking at me feeling sorry for the situation. Than I realized that the person at my register was the manager of the store, Victor. Either he is a terrible manager or he was very mad to be working as a cashier that's why he was being so rude and impatient. I don't feel like going back to this panera.
2016-05-03,1,Literally THE WORST Panera I have ever been to. I would give a negative star rating if possible. The management of this location is TERRIBLE. They have messed up my orders completely on multiple occasions. After the third time of completely messing up my order (and after I walked all the way home) I called them and the manager said I would get a free meal on my next visit (she put my name down on a list). Well when I came to this location a week after this happened and told the male manager working the closing shift what had happened to me a week before, he basically told me "f%*$" off. His one job is customer service and he can't even get that right. This place is the definition of TRASH. Did I mention that the management here also has no problem letting the homeless sleep at booths and bother patrons to ask for money? Avoid at ALL COSTS. I know I will not be returning.
2016-05-03,1,Once again the problem here is the squatting homeless, which is a distraction. Not a place to sit and eat when they take up most seats with all their things. The staff and management ignores it.
2016-04-22,5,Soup, bread, and bear claw are so good! Free wifi and chargers. Convenient to spend some time here. Enough space even during the peak hours.
2016-02-09,5,I absolutely enjoy their salads and soups! They are amazing and leave you satisfied. Customer service is also great!
2016-02-07,2,Let me just say that I love Panera food, all of it. But this particular location is notorious for two things, first is never having seats available because of people who take up the space for wifi usage. Second is for always messing up the order, unless you verify you want bread with your order and not chips or completely forgetting soups on a pick 2 once you've already driven home. They apologize yes but it's completely unacceptable when it happens more than once.
2016-01-30,4,First time in years. Just as I remembered from our college days. My husband and I went here when other salad places (like Honeygrow) were closed due to the winter blizzard that attacked the city the day prior. Panara was shoveled out and in full operation. I love the new feature to order your food on the new-er? touchscreen iPad type devices. This made for the one who likes to customize orders, very user friendly and I was a very happy customer. I was impressed with the freshness of the salad and thought the chicken wasn't too salty for the fast foodish style food. Avocado was nice and fresh too.  And a great portion.  The hubby got a panini sandwich and he kind of got confused by the customizable options on the touchscreen because of how many choices he had for bread selections, etc. which I can understand if you are new (or re-new) to the menu item and just want the classic version. Was there an easy kid button for classic way that we missed? All in all, satisfying lunch at a good price.
2016-01-24,1,Seriously this place is really slumming it as a Panera. Kind of dirty. The menu is not half as varied as Paneras in the suburbs and this new ordering system is just plain dumb and doubles the time to get your food.  Skip this Panera but visit others.
2015-11-28,2,The coffee here is hit or miss. It's almost never hot enough, something true of just about every Panera I've ever been to. The temperature is only close to okay when fresh coffee is brought out, which seems to happen around here very infrequently.Why can't Panera get coffee right? How hard is that? Seriously, if you like coffee, go somewhere else.Other than that, the place is not always clean and the food is mediocre yet pricey (again, true of all Panera locations). The saving grace here is the staff. They're friendly, helpful, and pleasant.I'm drinking lukewarm coffee yet again as I write this. I only came in here because the Starbuck's next door was full.
2015-11-16,5,Perfect, perfect pit stop in Hoboken. Yes, please remember this is in Hoboken. If you come during lunch hours or after school hours, expect children of all kinds of ages and noise levels.But also remember that this is Panera. Great food, warm atmosphere. Did I mention really, really good food? As a college student, this is a dream for me. Healthy, close by, and not that pricy. I love it here. It's a savior from my cafeteria's frozen buffet, and a refreshing break from the other more pricy and/or greasy places in Hoboken that sell themselves in adverts but disappoint you on the plate, in the plastic basket, etc. It's also pretty well kept.One of the key things here, though, is the service. They're just so friendly! Arthur, especially. He takes the time to get to know his regular customers and what they usually order (without their online preferences, he doesn't cheat!) AND he just honestly puts the customer first, always. The people who work here are real people; funny while professional, friendly without being creepy. Good service AND good food? Damn, that's how restaurants should be.
2015-07-09,1,Wow. Just wow. I have never experienced or witnessed so much calamity at a Panera Bread before. How was the food you ask? It was great. However the front of house service left much to be desired. I don't know where the blame should be directed. PB customer service training? The local school district? The total for my delicious meal came up to 10.99. I gave the cashier a $20 bill and then found a dollar and said "Here's a dollar so that I can get back a $10 bill." Gadzooks. You da thought the girl's brain was computing the most difficult linear problem on earth. She called a manager over and told her the "situation" and followed up saying "...so, do I give her back $8?" Whoa Nelly! During this time, the manager is also handling a customer complaining about the iced green tea. After settling the bill, I noticed that the cashier had mistakenly rung up the customers order behind me. She too is asking for the difference of a whole sandwich from the half sandwich she actually asked for. Another "manager guy" comes over and all I hear the customer saying is 'I don't want that, I want what I ordered". They were trying to get her to purchase a different 1/2 sandwich to make it a whole. Then after strongly suggesting her change, the manager guy couldn't compute the customers returned change. The customer said to him "you aren't making any sense". She decided to just order a baked good in exchange for ongoing confusion. Meanwhile (as Im eating) the first manager is on the phone and I hear her disputing an order saying "we didn't deliver your order late... we called the number you gave us and no one picked up.This was so horrible that I'll just have to blame this one on a full moon.
2015-05-30,1,I was very surprised to see how dirty this place is. The set up/design of this place is off. The tables are sticky, floor dirty, and there are crumbs everywhere. I agree, there do seem to be many homeless people hanging around. The employees appeared a bit unkept (dirty noses, chapped lips) idk presentation wasn't the best. I came to dine in but decided to take my soup to go. Upon eating half of it I found a straight black hair in my soup...seemed to be from someone's beard or mustache? IDK but absolutely disgusting...never again.
2015-04-18,2,While in the abstract I love Panera, this location is pretty ratchet. Not because of the workers or food - here, it's pretty standard fare and the workers are always pleasant. It has a lot of seating and if you're extraordinary lucky (or deaf), you could manage to study here.The main problem is its patrons. It is baby central with young, bougie parents shirking their responsibilities to other customers in order to try and enjoy their bread bowls. Perhaps Hoboken should open a Chuck E. Cheese as that's how these parents are treating this restaurant. Babies scream at the top of their lungs, toddlers sprint back and forth through the restaurant, and parents try as hard as they can to ignore their own children's outbursts.In general, I'm sure the space is wonderful during business hours, but avoid if you're looking for evening or weekend respites as you won't be able to hear your partner's conversation over the din that is unmanaged children.
2015-03-20,3,place is greattoo bad it's Hoboken's homeless shelter
2015-03-20,2,We stopped in for lunch and were pretty disappointed with our meal.Decor: It's a Panera, no surprises. However, I will note that it is pretty large (for a Hoboken restaurant). There are a decent amount of tables.Bathroom: Standard as well.Staff: Everyone was nice and our food was ready in a semi-quick manner (it was not very busy while we were there).Food: I had the Asian salad and it was pretty pathetic. It consisted of the bottom 2/3rds of a head of iceberg lettuce (the white and light green/yellow part) and some nuts sprinkled in. The chicken was fine but there was not a lot, of it given that I had the "whole" serving, but there was not much dressing at all. We also had the Pick 2 - a steak sandwich and ceasar salad. The salad had the same issues and the sandwich was nothing to write home about.Value: We didn't pay much, about what you would expect, but it seems we got what we paid for... Even though it didn't set us back much it still feels like we got the short end of the stick here.I certainly will not be coming back after this meal.
2014-12-10,5,Most franchised coffee shops seem to follow the fast food model of ushering as many customers in-and-out as possible. The employees at the Panera Bread on Washington, however, seem to defy this standard as they continually remember who I am, what my usual order is, and go that extra step to ensure my experience is a good one. Hanna, Danny, and the whole team are a friendly, warm group of people.This week, I came in for a coffee on a freezing rainy day, and I noticed a kid in line ahead of me, looking through his pockets for enough money for a cup of soup. The girl at the register told him he was still a dollar short, so I gave the kid a buck. The manager on-duty noticed this and when she rang up my order, she informed me that my coffee was on her. When I questioned, she simply said, "pay it forward, right?"I was truly touched.With so many options on Washington Street alone, you can be sure this ambiance, friendliness, and consideration is what keeps me coming back to Panera bread.
2014-11-30,2,This is one of the worst Paneras I've visited.  There are homeless people sleeping in the booths.  It doesn't smell that great and is kind of dirty.  I hadn't gone for a while for those reasons, but I really wanted to try the chicken power bowl.  The bowl is supposed to have vegetables, chicken, cilantro hummus, and lemon.  I ordered it to go and when I got home the hummus was missing.  Very annoying.
2014-11-03,4,Its your typical Panera. No big surprises but has the positives you can usually expect: friendly and prompt service, sandwiches and bagels on demand, and plenty of seating and outlets.
2014-09-27,1,Wifi signal and speed are pretty terrible and that's about the only reason to come here. The coffee is bad, the food is ok and the bathroom is comparable to a football stadium's after halftime. The bums also use this place for free coffee and drugs exchanges.
2014-07-17,2,Having heard so much about this place, visisted it once for lunch and was disappointed. Maybe because I did order the worst things on the menu, but it sure wasn't impressive. Ordered a vegeterian sandwich and tomato soup in the bread bowl. The soup tasted pathetic. Sandwich was average. And for the amount they charged, did not really find the sandwich filling.  Not the place I would visit.
2014-05-07,4,I love Panera! I go to the Hoboken location about once a month and find that their staff is always pleasant but the portions are not consistent. I always get the same half salad and half sandwich. The bread of the sandwich is sometimes 3" in width and sometimes 5" in width. I know that the meats inside are the same pre-measured portion regardless but I want to feel like I'm eating an adult sized sandwich. My biggest complaint about this Panera is that it never feels 'clean'. Maybe its the lighting or the furniture but I always feel like I should've gotten my food to go. It probably doesnt help that you have moms sitting there chatting away while their kids climb on top of tables and chairs! I would never let me kids behave that way at home or in public. I can't wait for Panera to open in the Newport Mall this Fall. The space looks to be much bigger than Hoboken.
2014-05-03,4,the consistency at panera is the best. sometimes I dream about the frontega chicken sandwich. always a great choice.
2014-04-08,4,Pass on the chicken Cobb.I'd say yes to all the soups and sandwiches. Pass on the salads. Get the fountain drinks -hibiscus iced tea = heaven. The End.
2014-03-18,1,Panera is usually a relatively healthy fast food choice, expensive but with a generally good service. Not in Hoboken though. Food preparers are slow, sloppy and undertrained. They managed to drop my sandwich on the counter, and later I found that the meat (chicken piece) was undercooked, and that's after 10 min waiting for my order! During all this time, they would just talk each other back and forth, and don't care about food at all. This is really an exceptional Panera location, I've never had such experience anywhere else...
2014-03-18,5,Went there the day after St. Patrick's to recover and get refreshed from a night out with my friends. The food was fantastic, as always, but what made me want to come to Yelp and write this was their staff.A pal of mine got a bread bowl soup and it was too salty. The manager came over randomly to ask how we were and she offered to get him an entirely new meal. Free. It's not really about getting a free meal and it's not about the fact that the food was good/bad (for the record it's really good . . get the sierra turkey), it's the fact that she cared enough to check up on us.She knew we had a rough night. She knew my bud wasn't feeling his best. She cared enough to check up on us and make sure we were all good and having the best experience we could.This persons name was Lauren. I believe she was a manager (purple polo shirt), but can't be sure. Lauren I have no idea if any of your staff or whomever runs this page, but consider this a personal, deep-down thank you from my two pals and myself.Thanks again Lauren.
2014-01-05,5,I absolutely love Panera Bread, and the one in Hoboken is the only one that I actually enjoy. The staff is pleasant, food is fresh and tasty, and the atmosphere is welcoming.
2013-11-24,4,Standard panera food. Kinda pricy but good and fresh food. The food preparers are fckn slow here though and don't take their jobs seriously. They need to be fired and replaced with some fast moving workers preferably from guatemala. Just sayin..
2013-11-11,3,Great for a quick salad or sandwich on the go. The coffee is pretty decent too, as are their soups. I like the Mediterranean sandwich and ask for it grilled. Would like to see more vegetarian options in their sandwich selection. And yes, most of the times, they have clean restrooms.
2013-10-27,2,The food in my opinion sucks. I don't see what all the hype is about when I can get a better sandwich for much cheaper at a deli. I'm only giving it 2 stars because of how early it is open and how quick you get your food but the woman at the counter was in a bad mood so that took them down a star.
2013-10-11,3,A casual dining place with good options in salad and soups.
2013-09-05,2,Why, I was just here today!I come to Panera on a bi-weekly basis. It's not as cheap as a fast food restaurant, but they actually use real meat! The staff here is pretty nice. I was about a dollar short on something- and people in Hoboken aren't too forgiving when it comes to that- but the lovely woman behind the counter told me to forget about it and enjoy my dad. So yeah, foods okay, service is good, inexpensive, sounds like a halfway decent place. But ah, my friend, that's where you're wrong. I come in and I'm greeting with a several crying babies (screaming, I might add) whose parents would rather drink their tea and chat with their friends so they can enjoy their experience rather than give their kid something to do so others can actually enjoy their experience. Please, take your kid to a place that is meant for screaming children.
2013-06-11,1,ordered catering. highly doubt the delivery is coming in a cart instead a car!wed water dropping broken bags? even if it is raining outside, the delivery is not coming in the car? $25 for such a delivery, will never ever order from them.
2013-04-15,3,I find myself here and I may grab a croissant or a coffee.  But friends visit me here in hobo for some reason, they always want to go to Panera Bread. I don't understand why. Its  a cult following. The place is  just blah.  I mean the sandwiches are pretty dry. Somehow I end up spending $20.00 bucks just on my food at this chain. Plus side if you need to get away from your super annoying roommate from hell. I concede you win. There is Wi-Fi, huge amount of seating, and soup with baguette.
2013-04-12,4,Before I had kids, I was not a fan of Panera. Everything they sell is pretty mediocre. Especially if you're in the NYC metro area, there are so many other options for bread, pastries, sandwiches, coffee, etc... why go to Panera?After I had kids, I realized that stuff like bathrooms (bonus if there's a changing table in there!), large tables, lots of seating, etc. were pretty important. Not deal breakers but after you continuously go to eateries without bathrooms or only have 3 tables in a tiny cramped space, it's a breath of fresh air to go to a place like Panera.The staff here have always been very nice. Good location.
2013-04-11,3,The staff here is nice.  I ordered a tea and chose a Mango Green tea and also got a chocolate chip cookie.  The cookie was a little overcooked in my humble opinion.  Do they bake them here??  Take it out 2 minutes sooner.  :)  I used to be a big Panera proponent but I can't seem to find one in the area that I love as much as the one I use to go to in Bridgewater.   Their french toast bagels are dangerously good and I love their bread bowl soups though I try not to order them because I can never stop myself from eating the whole bowl.  One thing that bothered me was the man who came in a few minutes ago and asked the folks in this place for money.  Though I sympathize with poor and hungry people, I could tell that he wasn't going to use the money for food if you get my drift.  I have actually seem that man by the entrance to the Pulaski a few times in the early early morning (6:30/7am).  Anyway, not their fault - this is what you get when you're in an urban environment and I don't think you can completely control that.When I use to drink home late from work I would sometimes stop by here to get a half soup (black bean, garden veggie, or low fat tomato basil) with half a sandwich or salad.  A good way to control your intake and their web site is really great too.  It's awesome too that they have free wi-fi.
2013-04-03,4,I love anything Panera. This location is great, right on Washington St., close to Sinatra Park and Hoboken Terminal. Had the Green Tea Iced Tea today and it rocked! Will be back for more soon.
2013-03-14,4,Since I have a baby now on my hands, finding a restaurant that is child friendly is always on my mind when I am out and about. This place seems to be made for bringing your munchkins. The food is pretty good (insist on wheat bread or multi-grain bread if you want to stay on the healthy side)..The soups are tasty and salads are great for the price. It is a pain but worth it to get their dam regular card, the kind you hang on your key chain like a suburbanite. Register online but once you do, you get lots of free food.drinks. Back to their kiddie friendly jazz. They have a microwave for customers to use. This is gold for parents wanting to warm up their baby food/breast milk/bottled drinks. Rather than having to pester the staff to heat up your bottle, you can do it yourself which I love. They have napkins everywhere, loads of seating, a baby changing table in the bathrooms and booster seats. The staff smiles at the kids, they do not roll their eyes like most places. LOVE it. They always have decent music playing in there too. (No Zappa, but I mean, classical, Jazz, instrumental/easy going stuff). Music is never too loud so you can chat with your friends/family while you dine.You are never rushed here. In fact it seems like some people set up shop in here and spend their WHOLE DAY in there using the free wireless internet. Only downside is the place could use a good scrubbing. I am a clean freak and notice this sort of thing immediately. I always have to ask the staff to please come and clean the table as there is always crumbs and mysterious liquids all over the tables. Probably because of the fast turnover in there. The floors are dirty too but then again, there are loads of kids (and strollers) in and out of there all day and night.
2013-03-06,4,This has got to be my favorite Panera. I love the staff. Everyone is so nice and friendly. I am not crazy about the layout of the restaurant as nobody ever knows which line to stand in, because sometimes you're being helped at the usual register and other times at the bakery.I love their food. The taste never disappoints me. I do not like getting soups at night, because when they are low on a soup they simply fill up the cups/bowls 3/4 only and not all the way to that little line in the bowl. :-/ I'd rather have them tell me that they are almost out of my choice of soup so I can pick a different one.The soda fountain drives me up the wall here. Someone please fix the Diet Pepsi!! It takes 3 minutes to fill up your cup. It's so bubbly.All in all, it's my favorite lunch place.Favorites (usually in a You Pick Two Combo) are:- Broccoli Cheddar soup- Creamy Tomato Soup- Napa Almond Chicken Salad Sandwich (on whole grain bread)- Big Kid Grilled Cheese
2013-02-18,3,Panera is one of my favorite weekend lunch spots but, recently I've realized how awful the clientele is at this location. If it isn't the mothers with kids screaming up/running through the restaurant, then it's the random couple arguing loudly in the corner (Mind you, multiple people-myself included-complained to management & received the response, "oh they do that all the time").Panera food is always excellent & the employees at this location are wonderful. If you can tolerate the people, then it's worth going. If not, there's a much quieter branch in Secaucus.
2013-02-03,5,Love the way they serve the soup in a bread bowel. Something unique... Creamy tomatoes nd beans soup are great.. Does anyone know which Sandwich or panini is really good for vegetarian?
2013-01-03,3,Oh Panera. Let's talk.I don't understand your layout at this location. Some days I get served at the bakery registers; some days I get served at the regular registers. I can never tell which one to wait for (and I usually end up picking the wrong one). And there always seems to be more employees than necessary ... though I could be coming on off-peak times so that's probably on me.The bigger problem is that on two occasions, a week apart, my to-go dinner was incomplete. Avocado was forgotten on my Turkey & Avocado BLTs. Avocado! On both occasions I was too far from the restaurant by the time I discovered the mistake.*I'm giving this spot the benefit of the doubt because I love their food. I had a lot of good, solid meals before The Avocado Incidents occurred. But I'm going to need a little consistency & a little organization to be able to come back from "tolerate," to "like," to "love."_______________________* I should mention that Panera's customer service is excellent. I notified them of the mistakes, & they responded immediately with apologies & promised to pass on the information to the appropriate people. Definitely a reason to give them another chance, don't you think?
2013-01-02,5,This Panera Bread is awesome! It's great for coming here for breakfast on weekends, it's a very peaceful and nice environment, the employees are nice with customers and best of all they give you the food freshly baked! The Wifi is decent and also the location's great! Highly recommend it!
2012-10-14,3,It's your standard Panera Bread. It's quite roomy, lots of seating in the front and near the back of the store. So if you're coming in expecting to knock out some work in a coffee shop, you won't be displeased. Although I will recommend bringing some headphones depending on the time of day that you come in...The main gripe that I have with this Panera is that the internet is mega-weak. Because of that I find myself simply running in here to grab a quick coffee or some of their delicious bread and going on my way.
2012-09-09,3,For some reason, Panera Bread is general is a hit or miss.I love their soups, and salads... and enjoy some of the sandwiches... unfortunately, most are pre-made, so asking them to customize is a bit difficult.I have also enjoyed their new egg bake (Quiche) that they have for breakfast.Always a good bet when a "local" establishment is not available.
2012-08-16,2,I would give this 3 stars except the breakfeast specials are only served until 10:30AM on weekdays although they tell you till 11:00 am (but that's only Sat and Sun). This is stupid and misleading.  The manager should have given the breakfeast special based on this misleading information but he was quite the snooty man!
2012-06-24,4,Don't sleep on this place.  It's no wonder why the company has done so well.  The bread is fantastic and the service is very good (Katrina was awesome).I've been here from lunch a few times.  It's very close to where I live.  The bread bowl chicken soup is a favorite of mine.  How often do you get to eat your lunch and then eat the entire bowl it came in?  Fantastic.  If you are on some some Atkins BS, keep it movin.Today I was here for breakfast.  I had the Power Sandwich.  Ham, egg and cheese on rye toast.  I'm not sure what cheese it was, but It was a great contrast.  They toasted the bread perfectly, and the egg was cooked well.  I have nothing but high compliments for today's meal.The only thing that that kept this from being a 5 star is that I've called ahead a few times, and the screwed up the order (no cheese, no ham, etc.).  I'd say from today's experience that they have gotten their act together.  Sign up for the Panera Rewards...it takes 2 min.
2012-06-19,4,I'm not ashamed to say that I love Panera. One is opening in the city on 5th Ave, but I can tell you right now I will never ever set foot in it because it will be a tourist trap and a den for tourists.  Can't handle that.  BUT this one, conveniently located on Washington St in Hoboken, is one that I can easily get my Panera fix and in a convenient fashion.  I love their souffles for morning - their brownies are amazeballs - I was dying for lunch, but for some reason wasn't feeling pizza (shocker - since this chick knows the best pizza is in Jersey).  Voila! Soup with bread and a brownie for an extra 99 cents at Panera.  Done and DONE.  I had a great lemon orzo chicken soup - phenom.  Funny thing is that I don't enjoy their salads...know why...too filling (who knew?).  Anyway, for NYCers, fret not - don't go to Panera on 5th Ave, take the PATH to Hoboken and give the tourists a taste of their own medicine.  But you know, just don't act like one.
2012-04-27,4,I've been to this Panera for breakfast at times and lunch when I visit the local Citibank.  Their food is consistent with the other Panera Bread out there.  I have no complaints since it is pretty much what you'd expect out of them.  Often during peak hours for lunch, it is difficult to find a seat here and that's not about to chance anytime soon.
2012-04-13,1,Im livid right now.  I have had bad experiences at this Panera before.  When you get a salad from here, be prepared to get lettuce with no dressing.  The first time I got a caesar salad from here I just asked for a caesar salad.  I got one container of dressing on the side.  Their containers are like half the size of a plastic ketchup container you would get at a fast food restaurant.  So the container is small to begin with, and it was filled about a quarter of the way.  So pretty much it was not even a full spoonful of dressing.  Now I went again and ordered it with extra dressing and made it very clear that I wanted quite a few dressings if the containers weren't full.  They gave me three of them and they were filled even less than the first time.  Each one contained about a teaspoon of dressing.  I put it on the salad and shook it up.  Worst caesar salad ever.  The lettuce was almost brown and it had little to no dressing on it.  I love Panera, but this one is awful.
2012-03-07,1,Normally I like Panera breads.  But lately something has been bothering me when I go there.  They leave that bread for sides out in front of everyone.  I have seen people coughing and hacking by it in the winter and mothers that are holding their kids play with with it.  I literally watched a little kid slime up a whole loaf with snotty fingers.  I told the manager and they did nothing about it.  This is huge red flag and its still there weeks later.  I cannot believe they allow this to happen.  If I see it again I am calling the board of health.  Someone has to do something.
2011-12-07,4,This place is always smooth and neat.  The inside is calm and lots of space, good tables to sit at.It is also a great spot to have lunch here  or on your lunch break from work.  I will give it an A, great service and clean!!!p.s. their soups, cookies and panini sandwiches are the BOMB!!I recommend it to go there at anytime no matter what seasons it is.
2011-12-03,3,It's a good enough Panera, but it's unclear why they don't boost their consistently weak wi-fi signal - Internet is a major reason many of us go to coffee shops and the like, and the user-unfriendly one here is not good customer service.It is roomy, and it's even possible to get far enough away from the coffee machines to have a business call, which is nice.
2011-12-01,3,I can't get enough of this chain, I hate to say it!!!Of all the Paneras in NJ, I think this one may be on the bottom of the totem pole.  Of course I'm a little biased since I'm not from the city, but it mostly has to do with the staff.  I'm a west-coaster (i know, i know.... hehe) but I do find it odd that just a few miles west, where Panera East Rutherford resides, has a very different mentality when it comes to service.But yet again.. it's Panera... 'nuff said.
2011-09-27,3,A little confusing in the ordering department, mainly how the quiche was delivered (you are suppose to get it at the register, FYI). Other than that, same old Panera (soup, bread, salad). Staff was friendly though.
2011-09-21,5,Once upon a time, when I was still an undergrad, I would drink 4 (possibly 5) nights a week, all in a row. By Sunday morning, I felt like shitasscrapgrossewyuckHANGOVER. The ONLY remedy? Panera broccoli cheddar soup. And a salad of some sort. Usually caesar, because who is healthy on Sundays after binge drinking? Not me, that's for sure.Now that I live in the Boken, I come here armed with my laptop on Sundays. Like, pretty much every Sunday. My order has changed slightly---I get a Thai chopped chicken salad. My binge drinking has also waned...just two or three nights a week now. Sure there's better soup and sandwich places around, but I'm a fan of what's familiar. And this place reminds me of being back at PSU. And for that, it gets my five stars :)
2011-08-28,1,I have never been to a louder Panera Bread. Nor a louder Au Bon Pain or similar location. I would say that it feels like you're in a pre-school class but that's not fair to pre-schools-- they're not this loud or crowded.You'll be hard-pressed to find a place to sit and to make any sort of pathway around all of the 20 or so strollers.The service is mostly awful except for a very nice cashier named Petra (who has no control on the quality of food).I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and after taking one bite of it I found (I have no idea why) the stem and a portion of jalapenÌo pepper. I'm actually allergic to jalapenÌo peppers and absolutely didn't ask for any (especially the discarded portion of one).Never getting food from here ever again. Maybe coffee, since I can't think of a scenario where jalapenÌos might introduce themselves, but then again I can't surmise how the litter-portion of some ended up in my sandwich.... so maybe not.Anyway, wouldn't recommend...
2011-08-16,3,I keep saying "I don't review chains"--right before I review a chain. I'm not a food snob. It's just that you probably already know what a Panera is like.Ok, so I don't review chains, but this Panera is worth mentioning. Convenient location, fast order delivery, and some friendly staff members (one at the register today--German accent? Scandinavian?--almost fell over herself in an effort to be helpful). Also, the layout is sectioned off, so that the stroller set naturally gravitates to the open tables near the middle, while the laptoppers find secluded spots closer to the front to enjoy the free wi-fi.But there are negatives here I haven't seen at other Paneras. The ladies-room stalls are falling apart and have been for some time. The stall doors don't close properly, as if it were a dive bar, and a dilapidated toilet-paper holder made the other stall an obstacle course. Details like this just make the whole place seem uncared-for.For every friendly staffer, there's another who seems borderline hostile at the registers. I've sensed this even when the place is half-empty, so it's not due to understaffing. Having said that, it's still an oasis of classiness on a fast-food-dominated strip. Get the loyalty card they're pushing. I already got a freebie just for signing up.
2011-07-21,4,I am powerless against the soup in a bread bowl.  Every time I stroll in I look at the menu, think something looks good, and immediately order French onion soup in a bread bowl.  Its just that good.  Its very affordable too at around $5.I've been here quite a few times and only heard good things about the menu items.  Having the choice between an apple or chips with your meal is a nice touch too.  Haven't yet checked out the breakfast food but that also looks delicious.And there's free WiFi!
2011-07-07,3,So, Panera Hoboken has a few things going for it, in my ever-humble opinion.One, great, high-powered air-conditioning.Two, free refills on sodas, iced tea, and coffee.Three, free internet, BUT limited between 11 and 1 (or so) to half an hour. This is a good thing, for those of us who spend too much time on facebook and not enough time writing our scholarly articles and books.Four, the Panera card, which, at random intervals gives you free stuff. In the last year, I've received a free Take 2, two sweets, a smoothie, and a bagel.Notice, I did not mention the food, which is standard chain fare.
2011-06-07,1,Decided to have a nice afternoon lunch at panera and do some studying.  ordered a you pick 2 meal.  salad and sandwich.1st sandwich. chicken frontega.  took a bite, ate some chips, ate some of my salad.  back to my sandwich and notice the bite i just took was pink. inspect the rest of the sandwich... blood vessels can definitely be seen.take it back. staff easily responds to my issue and get me a new sandwich.  i don't think i can handle meat so i get a tomato and mozz sandwich.  (it's cheaper and they don't offer to give me the difference)i get my sandwich, go back to my seat.  half way through it i open the sandwich and there's a STICKER on my cheese.  they gladly refund me my money, but weren't very nice or apologetic about it.  also didn't offer me anything additional.i used to like panera.
2011-05-20,5,Awesome. Always loved Panera consistency and counted on it whenever I needed some good food/place/service without any thinking. Brocolli cheddar soup, Frontega chicken half/half with chips is my favorite.
2011-04-12,4,I just wanted to update my usual entree order.  You can still order frontega chicken which is smoked & pulled white meat chicken, mozzarella, tomatoes, red onions, chopped basil & chipotle mayonnaise, grilled hot on Focaccia you cant go wrong there.  But I think I may have a new favorite dish.  Its Chipotle Chicken Sandwhich, which is an all-natural, antibiotic-free chicken, smoked bacon, smoked cheddar, tomatoes & ancho-chipotle spread.  I can live without tomatoes, but you can barely taste it so if I dont pick them all out, im not going to cry about it.  Next time I should just tell them not to put tomatoes in. That should make my life easier. Happy Eating!
2011-03-26,3,Don't sit in the back, it smells like bathroom, and your food will taste like bathroom.Otherwise, it's a Panera bread.
2011-02-19,1,Panera is gross. It is not a deli. You think your getting something healthy but its just poor additives and fillers. Take a look at the ingredients in a soup or sandwhich on the website, about 50 ingredients. These chains shoudlnt exist in the Tri State area.
2010-10-13,4,It's your standard Panera and, as with many Panera locations, I'm a fan. This location also seems to be a very friendly establishment. I have joked with at least two cashiers and the staff is typically pretty smiley, which I enjoy.  Someone must be doing something right here.
2010-09-01,5,I really like Panera Bread.  It's a pretty good chain that is slightly on the more expensive side (more expensive than McDonald's, that's for sure).  I would expect a meal to average around $8-$10.Their You Pick Two deals used to be my favorite.  You pick two out of a half sandwich, soup, and salad.  You do have to pay a little more for their "premium" items though, which makes the meal a little pricier.  Their paninis are also excellent.  Toasted just right, and filled with flavor, yum.  Nowadays, I just come mostly for soup!They have a set soup menu, and soups can include Baked Potato (my favorite), Chicken with Wild Rice (close second), Chicken Noodle, Broccoli Cheddar ...With this store in particular, service is generally pretty fast, although sometimes the guys preparing the food get confused as to what orders they have done and haven't done when there's a lot of backlog.  But it's usually minor and not like catastrophic in some other places.Only beef I have with all Paneras around the U.S. is that their portions are kind of tiny, so every time I suggest this place to a guy friend, they usually cringe because of how little food one gets here!
2010-06-12,4,Ingredients are freshcompetent staffPackage take out food wellsometimes get our food messed up, but it's expected at a chain restaurant like these where staff turnover is higher than mama and papa shops.Note to Panera: Train your staff please!
2010-03-29,4,Finally woke up early enough to get myself to Panera before their 11am breakfast last call.  Got the infamous souffle - tried the spinach artichoke one and I am hooked!  It is a souffle with an American twist, i.e. lots of cheese.  It is a combo of puff pastry enveloping the kische.  Not sure why they call it souffle to be honest but who cares when it tastes good!
2010-02-22,1,Even the best broccoli soup on earth couldn't save me from writing a bad review of this place. Don't get me wrong, the food is solid. But I swear every time we go there our order get's messed up. EVERY TIME! I wish I was exaggerating because this is one of my favorite chain restaurants but this place needs to get it's sh*t together.
2010-02-03,4,Can't help myself but I really like this place. Food is always reliable. Certainly not the best of anything but just good food all the time you go in. Internet availability is also a nice touch. One of my regular stops.
2009-12-21,3,I was a Panera today and was really disappointed to find that they had sealed up many of the electrical outlets where people plugged in their computers in the back of the store, and there are just a few outlets in the front.  I actually say someones computer fall, when someone trippped over their computer cord.  I understand that there were people who abused the free internet access, but the I think this new development will backfire.  The store looked a lot emptier today.  I hope that other will also let the management know their distress at this new development.  On the plus side, their new menu item of Mac and Cheese was very good.
2009-11-13,4,Dear Panera,I'm a huge fan of your barbeque chicken salad which is fairly new to your menu at one of your Northern NJ locations.  Mmm, your breads are yummy too as are your soups. I tried your french onion for the first time a few weeks ago and am happy to report that I am an official convert of your french onion soup  which I never thought I'd be- a french onion soup lover that is.  I especially love your Panera location on Route 23 or is 46 next to Party City?  Hmm, not sure. But I am sure about you, your salads, soups, bread and coffees and oh yeah, your yummy fresh tangy lemonade too.  Rock on, PB!!   Wish you were here in "The Big Apple". You would totes be one of my fave bkfst/lunch spots for sure.   Oh, hi 5 on the wi 5 too.  ;-)
2009-10-29,5,I'm a regular here; I think they're getting sick of me. :pWhat makes me a regular to this Panera is the EXCELLENT salad, unusually good customer service and the wide, wide space to sit down and study. Any place which can provide that will see me pretty frequently. The managers of this shop are really, really nice and are more than willing to give you the best service possible. The floor staff is really nice as well; all of them are great to talk to. Their wifi can get slow, especially when it's at peak, but there are many other access points to log into if faster internet is needed. (I am NOT condoning wardriving, but then again...)Besides their salads and tomato soup, I also love their bread (it would be a travesty if they were a commercial bakery with horrible bread), their coffees and their sandwiches. I wasn't too fond of their latte, as it tasted like it was made with a coffee base instead of an espresso base. Regardless, the overall quality of the place trumphs any negatives I have of them (which are few). Take a visit here; you won't be disappointed.
2009-09-24,4,was brought here by a friend visiting from the Philippines with his son---they're already based in HK for some time now. i agree with them that this coffee place / bake shop is great. nice location, nice overall service. for a freelancer like myself, doing online content writing among other things, & even though i live in staten island, i think i may consider going back here one of these days----i'll definitely be doing my writing while enjoying their coffee (which i was told was refillable) here---by the end of my visit, i may just end up doing 3 to 5 drafts of my articles---that would be fantastic for my plans---btw, their bagels are great, too!
2009-06-08,1,How this place gets away with 5-star reviews is astonishing, and quite sad. This place is the polar opposite of good food, from the morgue-like space to the overly processed baked goods and a sterile environment that makes Starbucks feel like a luxury resort in comparison. What do people eat that they think this place deserves a breadcrumb of praise? Wake up, Hoboken. For anyone who thinks this is even on the radar screen, fly to San Francisco, go eat at Alice Waters' Tartine, and repent, repent, you baked-goods heathens. Panera is hell on yeast.
2009-06-04,3,Sourdough bread bowl filled with chicken noodle soup is instant win on a cold day.Whether you're there in the morning or evening, there's something good to eat, from pastries to soups.Wish the prices were a bit lower, but they're not too bad.
2009-06-02,3,First, the good things: Panera does have some pretty tasty sandwiches. Their soups also hit the spot on a cold Hoboken winter day.Next, the so- so: their prices fill the niche between fast food cheap pricing and sit down restaurant pricing. What, there's no such intermediate price level? That's what I thought too. It's too expensive to be called a "cheap eat", and the quality / quantity of food isn't enough to be considered a proper meal. meh.Finally, the bad: if I ever have to walk into a restaurant / coffee shop and see any more idiots with their macbooks and ipods pretending to do "work", punches might be thrown. Just go home, go to a library, go to a friend's house... just don't sit there and pretend to look important when really all you're doing is checking facebook and sipping a medium coffee.
2009-04-11,2,It is clean, I'll give it that; and there is ton of space; and you can work in peace, though I really don't understand why anyone would work alone in a public space, seems like such a narcisistic thing to to. But the food itself is mediocre and overpriced and the coffee is acid.
2008-11-07,4,Free wifi, delicious bread, and free coffee/soda refills? What more can you ask? If you don't feel like making the schlep to Hoboken, they've got a Queens location just off the Steinway St. stop on the G/R/V. Just as good.
2008-06-30,4,Stopped in here for a quick bite to eat - pleasant open seating, and a good bear claw, plus the green tea was nice and cool, yet not too small.  Will come to try lunch at some point.
2008-06-07,3,i live in cityplace in edgewater and there is a panera here.  i like their chicken frontega sandwich lots of different flavors but not enough chicken. as a matter of fact all of their offerings seem to be that way. they remind me of a subway with more bread than filling. but i give the nod to panera for their bread on steroids and their array of desserts. the salads are good but once again not enough meat. the decor is relaxing and comforting.
2008-04-28,5,excellent !! Love the onion soup and the frontega chicken!! Delish!!!!
2008-04-07,3,Obesity only truly flourishes when you eat something and then eat the container in which it came. Panera presents this gift in the form of its bread bowl. My preference is the clam chowder although french onion is also a solid choice. Yeah, I'll dip my bread in my bowl. Then, I will eat my bowl. Speeeeeectacular.
2008-02-10,5,There's no logic that Panera has not yet made it to NYC proper.Not only does this establishment offer free wifi (making it sublime to work at) - but their bread rivals some of the city's best bakeries, and when paired with the soup/salad combo, is a quite delicious value as well. I love their strawberry poppyseed chicken salad, as well as the vegetarian black bean soup...and their soy lattes can show the people at Starbucks a thing or two. Why oh why are there none in the city????
2008-02-01,4,Panera Bread is quite possibly the most perfect "fast-food" restaurant.  They bake all of their products, including fresh breads, pastries, unusually flavored bagels (French toast, etc.).  They also offer a variety of salads, sandwiches, panninis, and soups.  Beverages range from fresh brewed iced tea to coffee to fresh lemonade.  They offer a terrific "You-Pick-Two" menu options, which includes our choice of either 1/2 sandwich, 1/2 salad, and bowl of soup for $6.49.  You can even get the soup in a bread bowl for an additional $1.99.  This option even includes a side dish of your choice.  Choose from an apple, a bag of chips, chunk of French baguette, or large piece of whole wheat baguette.  I always order the "You-Pick-Two" with a bowl of Low-Fat, Vegetarian Garden Vegetable soup and 1/2 Classic Cafe Salad.  The soup is a vegetable broth stuffed with chunks of lima bean, carrot, potato, and more.  The salad is a basic garden salad of mixed baby greens, tomatoes, cucumber slices, and red onion in a balsamic vinaigrette.  I order the delicious whole wheat baguette as a side.  I also highly recommend the fresh brewed iced tea, for which they usually have a bucket of lemon slices available.The Hoboken location is extremely large with seating at the front of the cafe, as well as another large dining area in the back.  They also offer free Wi-FI.Panera is great, and with the size and comfort of this location, I highly recommend giving it a try.
2007-12-26,5,I can't help but laugh when an overly excited worker seems like hes having an orgasm putting together my "pick two."  These people love their job.I went through a Panera Bread craving stage ever since i had the frontega chicken sandwich with the chicken noodle soup and chips. Their "pick two" deal really helps out this broke college student. I never think it will fill me but it always does. The pick two you get a half a of sandwich a soup and a free side.  The sides aren't much to choose from but their chips and bread are amazing.  Also as a fellow chicken noodle soup lover, it is one of the best I've ever had.  Love this damn place.Sky*
2007-09-25,5,The only time I get to enjoy the wonderful Panera Bread is when I'm in Boston = /They are the best in their category. I love all their sandwiches and soups in bread bowls; most items come with a choice of an apple or kettle chips. My faves are: Sandwiches - Turkey Artichoke, Smokehouse Turkey; Soups - just about all of them.I LOVE it so much that I want to open a franchise in NY. Just out of curiosity I checked out their franchise info and found out they demand such freakin' high qualifications - Net worth 7.5 million, no single-unit franchises, experience as a multi-unit restaurant operator WTF. Oh well... back to reality as a loyal customer.
2007-07-05,4,On the way to New England and pulled into the monster mall near Co-Op City for a Book on CD. Starving and I thought, Not choosy but saw Panera and figured, they ought to have a panini that I can choke down. Accompanied by ultra finicky husband and two boys, I was not hopeful. But WOW. Everything was delicious: I mean tasty,savory, hit the spot kind of good. Ordered some kind of new feature panini with yummy tomato sauce, creamy cheese and perfect bread, chicken soup was gobbled down by the kids with bread for dipping,turkey sandwich was so pretty it looked like it was prepared for a commercial, lettuce fresh and crispy, tomatoes thick and summer- red! I have NEVER written a review of any sort before. This was so unexpectedly good and, since I want to have Panera again, of course there would be none in NYC, so this is what I can do to temporarily satisfy myself....hope someone else gets to eat there and enjoy as much as I did.
2007-06-15,5,This is the best chain lunch place there is. Everything on the menu is awesome. When I go there for a tuscan chicken sandwich I bring a change of underwear because I loose control. I stopped getting the soup in the bread bowl though because I like to eat the bread first and then I always end up with soup on my pants...And for those people that sit there on their laptops: You are not cool, nobody likes you, and there is free wireless everywhere so there is no need to waste good space for the eating customers with your gadgetry. Go home.
2007-05-11,5,I love this place. Actually, I'm a sucker for any soup and sandwich place and usually from a chain, they both suck. But Panera has changed my mind about all of this. Their sandwiches are filling (I get some sort of pesto chicken sandwich, on multi-grain) and soup in a bread bowl. So delicious. Their green tea isn't so bad either and their pastries are pretty good most of the time. And they are *cheap*!! The "you pick two" is the ultimate. Also.. try the Fuji Apple Chicken salad. The apple vinagerette is surprisingly tasty.
2007-04-05,5,Panera bread is amazing. I am allergic to a lot of veggies, so I order my sandwiches pretty plain wherever I go (just meat, cheese, and mayo, mostly). I love Panera because the bread is so amazing that my sandwich doesn't taste plain - the flavor is delicious. I get the Asiago Cheese Focaccia bread. They also have very good chocolate chip cookies, and INCREDIBLE coffee. I don't know how their coffee is so good, but it is. The cafe blend is light and delicious. As if all this wasn't enough, the atmosphere is so warm and welcoming. I feel happy just to be in there. The booths are especially cozy. I like to eat and then spend a few hours sipping coffee and reading if it's not too busy there.
2007-03-19,4,Craziness - that's the only way to explain a Manhattan girl going all the way over to Hoboken to go to a chain bread cafe.  Crazy!  But it's Panera, and Panera is really good.  Sure, you can get bread just as good or better in the city.  And there are plenty of nice cafes and coffee shops with free wifi there, too.  I guess sometimes I need to be in a Panera.  I feel like they care about me and my laptop and my wireless card and my insatiable appetite for soft, warm, happy bread.Downsides: weekends are crowded, screaming babies are annoying, and... there is no third thing.  Other than that, this palce is awesome.
2006-11-10,5,Typically, I don't like chains.  I guess this is why it took me so long to try a Panera Bread after passing by them hundreds of times.Yesterday I finally did and was really pleasantly surprised by the quality and the price of the food.  My turkey sandwich was delicious, and my baguette was crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside, the way it should be.  Oddly enough, I had someone's dog sitting next to my desk during lunch, and she liked the bread even more than I did.I've never seen a dog that liked french bread THAT much before.My total for a sandwich, side, and a cookie (no drink) was six-something dollars, so it's about the same price as fast food, but infinitely better!
2006-08-11,5,I am completely in love with this place. Haha. Free WIFI, soft music,  great environment, friendly staff, free refills on coffee, and great pastries. Haven't tried the food yet, but I will in... oh let's say ten minutes. Man, it's a perfect place to unwind and finish some of that work you have put off. Hm, good times, man. Good times.
