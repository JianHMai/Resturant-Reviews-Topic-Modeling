2021-08-01,5,I come here every chance I can when I am in hoboken. You can get cake slices and pastries without pre ordered though you have to pre order full cakes and of course by closing time most slices are sold out.I had the 4 layer chocolate cake and it was amazing. So light and not too sweet. Very delicate but hit the spot
2021-04-27,5,THE place in Hoboken for authentic, hearty bread. Lovely assortment of desserts. Try the beinersnitz (almost positive I spelled that wrong). It's a great honey and almond cake, very light
2021-04-14,1,I have been patronizing this bakery for some time and have always had a good experience. until I met the owner's wife while enjoying the food, staying away from the lady extremely rude.
2021-03-07,3,Picked up from here during covid times! I ordered in advance online.  The cake was ready at the time I specified and because I already paid online, it was an easy process.Overall, I enjoyed the cakes because they were not too sweet, but I was not impressed. At a price point of $7 per slice, I guess I expected slightly stronger flavors and a bigger portion size for each slice. The cakes are definitely beautiful and we'll made, but at the end led the day the flavors weren't really there for me. I would potentially go back to try different cake flavors or their other offerings.
2021-02-07,5,stopped by here spontaneously on a Saturday afternoon as I've seen the cart that is the front area of their store, many times! I never had a chance to stop by, but there was no line so decided to see what they had.both staff I talked to were super friendly and patient in explaining german desserts, the light and not sugar-heavy flavors that their desserts have, which was just what we were looking for!!the coffee cake, chocolate mousse, and the pineapple papaya one I believe?? (something like that) were super delicious and just as described.they are on the pricier side at about $6 a piece and we ordered about 5 slices of their cakes, but they were super tasty so I'm excited to come back here to come and support a local bakery :)
2020-12-13,5,The owners are really nice and the service is good too. The pastries look all pretty tasty. I got a cherry cake which was really good. It almost feels like being in Germany.
2020-12-11,5,I called ahead here to get some birthday cake and the person on the phone was incredibly helpful and friendly while explaining the sizes and options! Ended up getting the Berry Mix cake and was told if I was slightly late getting over to just call them and they'd come out to hand over the cake! Great service! (luckily I got there before they closed!)The cake itself was a smash hit. It wasn't overtly sweet at all, but just right. The sponge was as fresh and perfectly baked as I could hope for (with a bit of spring) and the buttermilk cream filling between the layers was honestly divine. To top it off the actual fruits (berries would you believe?) were fresh as well!Let me put it this way - at 6:30pm in bustling downtown Hoboken, there were people behind me queueing up here for a Danish. On a Friday....And I love Danish. Guess who's going to be back here many times in the future?
2020-11-09,2,I stopped by seeing the cute cart outside the store and  picked up an almond croissant. It was not fresh, not flaky and there was so much almond paste inside.
2020-09-18,5,I often go to Germany on business so I stopped by on a business trip to Hoboken. I got a chocolate and cherry pastry and it's the real deal. It is that perfect degree of sweetness found in German pastries where it is sweet but not overly sweet like so many pastries found at US bakeries.
2020-08-17,5,Cakes are perfect for me a not-too-sweet lover. The owner is super nice. I got two cakes one is honey almond cake the other is chocolate. Loved both and would definitely come back again!!
2020-08-13,5,Cute little bakery, delicious pastries and coffee. Friendly staff. There's a historic area and many parks nearby, you can sit or just take a stroll with a coffee in your hand.
2020-08-03,5,If you are looking for authentic German bread and desserts then this is it! I lived in Germany for half my life and I never felt closer to home when trying the desserts. Definitely recommend this place!
2020-07-20,5,Wonderful bakery and such friendly staff and owner. If you go on weekends they have a little stand outside which opens early. Excellent! Our baby loves visiting too they are so nice!
2020-02-22,5,My boyfriend and I stopped here on our way home from dinner. I'm dairy free so I wasn't expecting to find anything there I could eat. The owner offered to explain all of our options to us without knowing I was dairy free. He went through each item giving us a great explanation. He finally got to a chocolate cake and said "this is our only vegan item" and I was so happy!!! It looked amazing and tasted even better. I promise you wouldn't even know it was vegan if you tried it. I'm so happy to have found this place!!
2020-02-15,5,The chocolate cake is not too sweet but very chocolaty and delicious.  Had that and a cappuccino! Perfect!  Their leek Parmesan pastry was also great so nice selection if you are into something savory OR sweet OR both!
2020-01-31,5,This is a must visit if you're in Hoboken. The owner & baker Haytad is a gem and will quickly detail all of the days offerings. Bread sells out by noon. Desserts are available into the late evening with huge variety. Try the Gluten-Free Almond Chocolate tart or the Vegan Chocolate Hazelnut cake, both $3.50... easy on the conscience and the wallet.
2020-01-31,4,Very packed on a Saturday morning, the OGB has great service. Ordered my espresso and cherry danish, and was brought to my table a few moments later. I guess I'd want a little more filling, but the danish was fresh and great. Definitely a top bakery in Hoboken
2020-01-17,5,I love this little bakery.  The owner is really friendly and helpful, great selection and my favorite if the egg sandwich. Bread is oh so delicious!
2019-11-30,5,The best pasteries in all of Hoboken (maybe even the whole east coast?)!! As soon as you bite into a pastry from OGB you'll be transported to the streets of Cologne. The leek parmesan pastry and the mini Berliners make the perfect start to any day!
2019-11-07,4,Great service. Excellent prices. Very clean and open. Wish they had a bigger selection but I went on a Thursday afternoon and they were running out of a lot of pastries. The mini berliners with hazelnuts (Nutella inside, not whole hazelnuts) are delicious and $.85 a piece! Paper bags are $.20 each just FYI. Very authentic pastries. Also similar in style to Eastern European. Can't wait to come back.
2019-10-24,4,Stopped in here this morning to try their coffee and ended up with a few other items as well lol. I ordered a small latte with soy milk (no almond milk or oat milk available here), a mini Berliner w/jelly, mini Berliner with hazelnut (Nutella), and a peach crumb cake. Everything was delicious! There is better coffee in the area but the baked goods were excellent. The coffee was just too bitter/acidic for my personal liking. The berliners were soft and fresh. The crumb cake was soft and fresh. Fruit was firm, baked perfectly. Nothing I got was overly sweet which was perfect for me! And everything was $10. Totally reasonable! I'll be returning for more lol. :)
2019-09-29,4,Came across this while strolling in Hoboken on a saturday evening.There was a large selection of pastries.They don't have names along with them,so you have to ask the person taking care of you about the different flavors and all.After asking the guy a few questions,i decided to take the black forest slice and one cherry slice.Both of them tasted very very  good.The vanilla mousse in one the slices is to die for.Definitely going back.
2019-08-07,1,Named one price and then charged another on the credit card without a warning and without showing the POS-terminal with the transaction amount. Apparently, they charge extra when you pay with a card, even on amounts above $10. That's unethical practices. Lost a customer.
2019-07-01,5,Very good service and so Nice with european pastries and Coffee. It took like 5 min to get a Coffee but worth it.
2019-06-16,4,This place is our favourite cafe in the area. The owner always gives us a warm welcome. I love all the selection they have. And my favourite are the strudels. Sweet and Savoury.Going here always feels like home!
2019-06-14,5,Store keeper is very FRIENDLY. I lived in Germany for 6 years and the ambiance is very similar to a bäckerei in Deutschland. I was particularly looking for a German pastry similar to a crumb cake which I hadn't tasted since my childhood. Thankfully, this bakery sold it under the name "Almond butter". It was a wonderful experience to be reminded of cherished times in my life through a small cake. Delightful little spot! I think you will enjoy
2019-06-02,4,Highly recommend this bakery! Their pastries are absolutely delicious. We had a cheese and strawberry strudel which was amazing. The chocolate croissant was also very good. Their breads are a bit on the pricey side ($7-8 for a loaf) but are tasty.
2019-05-28,5,Very good food. Nice staff. Had several deserts and enjoyed all of them would highly recommend.
2019-05-14,5,This is the most amazing place in Hoboken !!! The food is delicious , and stuff are very friendly , i can say every little something is out of this world , just give a try and you will fall in love in this place !!!
2019-04-28,5,I love this mans! The owner makes my day. I can literally walk by, see him in the window, and be happy. He has a real love for his bakery, and it shows! Great baked goods and variety of desserts. I highly recommend this spot for a nice pastry and morning coffee.
2019-03-15,5,I love, love this place.  Parmesan and Leek pastry is awesome.  Chocolate pastry was amazing too - everything I have ordered here is great.
2019-02-26,1,Horrible owner/ manager poor service. I brought a whole loaf of bread back because it was falling apart And was unedible like too much flour    He insisted it was not from here. As if I imagined buying it.  It was insulting in front of other customers too.  He did not offered replacement or refund.  He lost a regular customer instead of treating me fairly.
2019-02-15,1,I would not recommend this bakery for anyone. Wish I could give -star if it was possible. The owner is terrible. I went to this bakery for little treats and there was $5 dollar credit card limit ( which is illegal but well, a lot of places do it so) I got it. My total came up like $4.75 but  the owner made such a big deal out of it so I paid extra $3 for the quark balls (cheese pastries they have). It was sold out at the time so the owner said I can come get it next day but I forgot. So I called the bakery today and the owner told me that he needs to charge me again or won't give me the pastries that I already paid for cause I didn't come get it the next day. Total scam. SO stupid he lost customer over $0.75 pastries. Would never go back.
2019-02-10,3,This place is solid for the pretzels and small pastries we get.  Budget a bit of time when you go because they usually only have 1-2 people working behind the counter, so even if you're grabbing something quickly (like a coffee or a pastry), it'll take a solid 5 minutes minimum.  We've never sat in and staid to eat (they have about 6 tables maybe-mostly 2-tops), and even though the prices of the pastries are a bit high, the quality is usually there.  The only watch out I would say about this place besides the bit of a wait and it behind a somewhat pricier option would be that you should go on the earlier side (especially on weekends) because they make a limited amount of everything and once it's sold out, it's sold out for the day.  Net/net-if you have a little bit of time and want an elevated good pastry, and it's before noon on a weekend, swing by here.
2019-01-04,5,These are the best pastries I have ever had in my whole life!  Cherry strudel was sublime! Nutella croissant is to die for.
2019-01-03,5,This is a real German bakery. The owner is from Germany and imports his ingredients. You can get coffee here too but I'd get pastries to go and grab a coffee elsewhere.
2018-12-01,5,My favorite bakery in Hoboken!!!Great service, great cakes and fresh breads everyday!The place is relaxing and cozy, gives you the real feeling of being in a German bakery in a small village of the countryside of Cologne
2018-11-24,1,I walked in around noon on Saturday looking to buy a multi-grain loaf of broad.  They only had one loaf of bread sitting there on the shelf - you are a bakery isn't that your business to have bread available?  Very perplexing.
2018-11-06,2,Lady behind the counter didn't know the names of the displayed baked goods (no tags?). The chocolate cake I bought was dry and tasted cheap. Won't go back again.
2018-11-04,5,What a delightful bakery! Loved their latte, almond croissant and pastries. Talk to the owner before you choose the pastries. He is very knowledgeable and will tell you all the ingredients and also tells you the ones he doesn't fancy and why. The place gets really packed in weekends. The almond croissant I had was so succulent and yum.
2018-09-22,5,Delicious! Most items are gone by 5 or 6 on the weekend. Try everything. I have tried cakes, pies and croissants, honestly all of them are my favorite.
2018-08-26,5,Great coffee and great deserts. I used to go here when I lived in Hudson County. Love!
2018-07-31,5,Love love love everything about this gorgeous spot in Hoboken. Their breads are the most healthy and delicious breads that I ever found in Hoboken. Pastries always fresh and service is great. I am stopping by at least once a week for coffee, cookies and bread!
2018-07-27,5,The pastries here are not only delicious but also immaculately made and beautiful to look at. But their coffee is every bit as good, and to my personal taste it's the best coffee I've had at anywhere in New Jersey (other than in the homes of coffee fanatics). I only wish this place was nearer to where I live.
2018-07-09,5,I stopped by this bakery with my husband after eating some lunch nearby. I have a horrible sweet tooth! ;) I stepped in, looked in the counter and knew exactly what I wanted! I had a slice of the German chocolate cake with a small decaf latte. The cake tasted as amazing as it looked! It wasn't overly sweet and tasted like real cocoa. The latte was perfect as well. Very friendly service. Highly recommended. I will be back!
2018-07-07,1,I used to like this place, although it is slightly overpriced. The staff there is very friendly and the cakes are delicious. On my last visit I got a piece of apple cake. Unfortunately I got food poisoning from it.
2018-06-03,5,The owners are always so sweet and accommodating, and the pastries and bread options are delicious! Highly recommend!
2018-05-28,5,This place is great! Coffee was great, our cake was delicious and the service is super friendly. If I'm ever in the area again I would definitely come back.
2018-05-26,5,Still the best spot in Hoboken for a coffee and cake. All their pastries are baked fresh. Been to Germany many times and I'm hard pressed to find a place as good over there
2018-05-21,4,I love many things about the Old German Bakery. The place is adorable and the food selection is different and fun. Best item but also generally sold out are the pretzels. You usually have to come early for that. They have a big variety of pastries to enjoy and unique beverages. Near the path and Washington st location.
2018-05-12,4,Always wanted to try their cakes and glad we finally stopped in ! They had quite a few to choose from, we settled on the multi-berry cream cake- it was light and creamy. We enjoyed it, not sure it was worth $6.50 but overall the quality was good. I can't say I'd go out of my way, but if you are passing by and want something sweet- this would be a nice option.
2018-05-08,5,Such a delicious selection of pastries! The quality is amazing and the owner takes pride in his craft.  Highly recommend!
2018-04-07,1,Owner was rude when I asked a simple question his reply was this is a German bakery maybe that's what he didn't have any customers ‍
2018-03-31,5,Delicious. After a long gap of 6 years the wife and I went back here and place is as good as ever. The owner and his adorable little daughter ensured we made the right choices (not sure you can go wrong with any of these cakes tbh). The cakes were light, fluffy sponges and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet. All of the cakes had fruits (cherries, raspberries) which added great flavor and texture. We will definitely be back and hopefully there isn't a 6 year gap this time around.
2018-02-27,5,Stopped by this place before they were going to close and I can't wait to go back! The owner kept telling us how his desserts aren't very sweet and at first I didn't believe him, but after trying the berry layered cake I was really really impressed. It wasn't overly sweet and the berry jelly on top tasted very fresh and flavorful. I definitely will be going back to try the other cakes and pastries!
2018-02-27,5,This spot is one of the bests in Hoboken. I have been to Germany a handful of times and am married to a German and this is the place to get true German baked goods -- as said by my wife. Get there early to ensure you have a good choice of rolls, pastries and breads, but be sure to try one of everything or else you'll be visiting more frequently than not. The owner is the real deal, moved from Germany, importing many of the necessary ingredients needed to bake these German treats. This is a must stop.
2018-02-10,3,Came to this place for breakfast. Ordered turkey sandwich and coffee. They don't provide breakfast as listed online but have pre-made sandwiches. It's too cold and not very fresh. Tried their dessert in the past, which i would value more.
2018-01-27,5,Love the place! The lady was very helpful in explaining each cake and helped with selecting if you are indecisive. Cute place for a date, or afternoon coffee!
2018-01-20,4,This place has been a favorite since it opened.  Always an interesting mix of breads and pastries.  Great place to stop for a post dinner treat.
2018-01-20,5,We came here at 1pm and all the pastries were sold out! They were making their next batch so our timing wasnt great. But we still were able to try their apple turnover which was delicious!! Crunchy on the outside, sweet apples in the middle. We ended up buying 2 more to take home for later. We also got a chocolate vanilla cake. Very light and creamy. The staff here are nice but not super helpful in informing us about the different pastries and cakes. Also small amount of seating available. Still, loved the pastries. Would come back again.
2018-01-14,5,Love to stop in here! They have different stuff than you usually find. The late discount does not hurt either. Somethings maybe pricey but are very high quality.
2017-12-21,4,I stay in the neighborhood and I can't deny the fact that I think about this bakery almost everyday and I drool over imagining their deserts !! I'm in love with this place , their hospitality (especially the cute daughter ) , abundant variety and brilliant German black coffee !! May be a little over priced though - hence a 4star rating.
2017-11-11,5,Oh man these guys have one of the best cakes I've ever eaten. I'm a sucker for cakes and these guys being in the neighborhood just gave me another excuse to help myself to some. Came here with my boyfriend and his sister after some drinks at a nearby pub and some dinner. Glad we didn't get dessert anywhere else. Do not order dessert no matter what kind of fancy ass restaurant you're in in Hoboken. Seriously just eat your dinner and head straight here. The owner is a very helpful chap. He explained to us what each one of the cakes were. That helped us a lot in trying to pick one flavor each from the horde of delicious cakes on display. He was also kind enough to get us glasses and pour water for us. Great guy! Great place! Great cakes! Danke!
2017-11-02,5,Small bakery in the heart of Hoboken to satisfy your sweet tooth! Came here a while ago with a friend from Germany who was very happy and impressed. I didn't try anything because I wasn't hungry. I am glad I visited again, this time to eat!!  Ran by the owner who has an amazing personality and happened to have his 9 year old daughter there that day. What a cutie! She explained to us what each cake slice was and helped us choose. Its wonderful to see business owners who involve their children and make them love what their father does too. I will be back for sure!!
2017-10-27,5,Customer service was amazing. The deserts were even better! A gentleman behind the counter took time to explain what everything was. He gave us time to pick and think about what we wanted. I didn't  feel rushed or like someone was waiting on me. They use all German ingredients and you can clearly tell the difference. This is a must go if you want some genuine deserts.
2017-10-24,5,It is my favorite bakery in Hoboken. Everything here is so fresh and tasty. Go there early to taste freshly baked pastries in the morning.
2017-10-18,5,Doesn't disappoint. I'm a particular fan of the onion bread, chocolate cookies and espresso.
2017-10-17,5,Fantastic sandwiches and breads. Nice staff as well. Definitely worth a stop by in you're in Hoboken.
2017-09-30,5,Cute bakery with plenty of options. Wanted something sweet after dinner and stumbled upon this place and I'm glad I came in. The staff was very friendly and the place also has coffee and an assortment of teas to choose from. Had a slice of cheesecake and a chocolate cake that tasted like ferrero rocher - it was amazing!
2017-09-21,2,Sunday at 8:10 I walked in with 2 grandmas and 3 little kids looking for dessert after dinner. The owner was very excited telling us about his pastries. We ended up buying about 6 different pastries and coffee. As we were all starting to sit down to enjoy our dessert, this random woman customer who seems to be a regular by the way she carried on told us he is now CLoSED and we have to leave!!  The Owner just smiled and let this random obnoxious customer basically kick us out!  If I had known that we would have taken our business elsewhere! There are plenty of dessert places in Hoboken.  As we gather all of bags of desserts and coffees, I said we'll can we sit outside while you clean up inside?  Once again that Random customer woman told us NO!  The Owner just smiled!  Ridiculous!!  My aunt ended up dropping her coffee all over the sidewalk and it was an utter mess. We were so frustrated we had no where to sit. Ended up going across the street to the Crepe place and sat there to eat our dessert.  Honestly the pastries were just OK! Not worth the money or the chaos!!
2017-09-21,4,Coffee and pastry were good. Only one employee working at the time so service was very delayed. They should staff more workers, otherwise great place
2017-08-29,4,Anytime I'm passing by this bakery I have to stop in and get a few of these quark balls and a cappuccino...absolutely love itI haven't had a chance to try their other stuff yet but will be back too
2017-07-08,4,We went there last week on our trip to Hoboken..Owner and his little daughter were very nice. He explained most of desert and what's in them and we ordered multiple items including cookies, turnovers, cakes. It's local and family owned. Everything was delicious but if I have to pick up which we end up ordering again to go on our strip walk is German cake.. it was dense and delicious.. too good.. definitely will go back to checkout more if ever in that area!!!
2017-07-01,5,I am German. This is the only authentic bakery in NY/NJ! The owner is super nice, the products taste amazing, the prices are reasonable :) LOVE it! They have an online shop coming soon.
2017-06-12,3,nice and quite place. had a german chocolate cake here. it was moist and tasty.
2017-06-06,4,I've been here a couple of times. They have some delicious treats. I absolutely LOVE the quark balls. Sometimes they aren't so much on the fresh side..just be sure to ask if they are. They don't taste as good when they have been sitting for a few hours. I recommend everyone try them at least once. They have a variety of other pastries that are also good. The selection of treats sometimes changes which is nice because you get to try new things.
2017-05-13,3,I didn't get any sweets here but I did get this pastry filled with spinach, and this other pastry filled with eggplant and zucchini. The spinach one was a bit dry. I really enjoyed the eggplant and zucchini one because it also had some tomato sauce (?) in it, so it gave it a nice flavor. Judging from the rest of these reviews, I think I might be the only person who didn't go for the sweets. Overall, it's a bit pricey but it's good if you're in the area and you're looking for a savory snack that's somewhat healthy.
2017-05-08,4,This place is adorable. Picked up some tarts and strudels  for a dinner party and they were delicious. Also, the brown bread is soooo fresh!
2017-04-07,5,A great place for those looking for the not-saccharine sweet desserts. The host is extremely fun and will help you choose
2017-03-28,4,You can tell just by looking at OGB that it's a venerable local institution. In keeping with the mode of venerable local institutions, it's more or less resting on its laurels at this point - not innovating, gently fading - but that doesn't mean it isn't good. The pastries are admittedly only slightly better than their convenience store counterparts, but they're better enough to be worth it. The more specifically German items, such as the quark balls and the plum cake, are especially good. Most of the people working there are not German, but they still can pronounce and describe all the various kuchen and taschen. Plus, they're way better at pulling espressos and cappuccinos than your average Teuton.
2017-02-26,5,Amazing food. Best coffee around. And the owners are the nicest people you can meet!!!!! Everything is so good!!
2017-02-15,5,My new study spot!!! Great food and music, I like their coffee so much, smooth and tasty. Not too crowded, not too pricy at all. Love it!
2017-02-02,3,Don't know what these reviews are for.  Too expensive and not very tasty.  $3 and$4.40 for danish is absurd.  The 40% off deal brings it to the price it should be.   Not much choice.
2017-01-21,4,This Old German Bakery makes fantastic desserts from what i saw and had. It was a great place to come in, order a dessert, and rest while eating a delicious sweet high calorie pleasure. They have great German chocolate cake which I can confirm. Very helpful staff in helping you choose what you might want to try for the first time.
2017-01-06,2,Been here a few times and I think it has lost a little bit of what once attracted me.I loved the quark balls and they are probably still great if you get them fresh, but if they have been sitting for a bit, they just aren't nearly as good. BUT they are super cheap. I haven't experienced anything like the first bite into one of their quark balls...it's what keeps me coming back. Its so spongy and amazing, perfect amount of firmness and then it gives way to super soft sponge deliciousness.However, there is a whole lot of other things this place offers other than quark balls and they just aren't nearly as good....The pastries don't do it for me...They are hard and don't give me the satisfaction of a lot of french pastries I've had that have tended to be much softer on the inside than the ones here. My fiance does love a few of their cakes.
2016-12-12,5,Excellent coffee, incredible/fresh pastries, very very friendly staff.
2016-11-07,4,The art of the European pastry is that it is never too sweet. Old German keeps them light and decadent. Perfect for a mid afternoon delight or perhaps a pre dinner snack. The ambiance is quiet and classy, not sure it's really the right place to bring kids. The coffee is excellent. Definitely recommend you to stop in if passing by to pick up a quick treat.
2016-10-01,5,Wonderful bakery, friendly and very helpful staff, delightful products! We walked by this place in search of coffee, and we were immediately drawn in by the welcoming aroma of freshly baked goods. The owner (I presume?) was just running up front with a tray of freshly baked quark and raspberry pastries. The pastries were so adorable, and you can see the jam and quark peeking out from the holes."I'm bringing out two more trays. Just one moment please," he said. As we feasted ourselves with the selection of pastries, he went to the back and emerged a few minutes later with two more trays of fresh pastries, this time apple turnovers and two types of apple stroudle. "What's the difference?" we asked. One stroudle has more dough less apple slices, and the other has less dough and more apple slices. Both look delicious. We got a raspberry quark pastry, a chocolate croissant, and a apple turnover. The pastries were light and airy, and they melt in your mouth. You savor bite after bite of delicious flavor. The pastries go very well with the coffee. We cannot ask for a better treat on the weekend.Sehr gut! Very good, as they say in German. Must try!
2016-09-26,5,Fantastic. 1) The black forest cake was unbelievable. 2) I liked the fact they had seating outside. 3) Nice spot to chill; and eat cake.
2016-09-17,5,Delicious fresh baked goods. Amazing customer service! What else can you ask for?  Worth the drive!
2016-09-10,5,I've never been to the location but friends had brought over pastries.  OH.  MY.  GOSH.To-die-for pastries.  They must have brought 8 different kinds of pastries and all of them were phenomenal.Don't come here if you're on a diet - but definitely check this place out.
2016-09-04,5,Delicious pastries, excellent coffee and incredibly nice owner / staff ... check it out!
2016-07-19,4,I was waiting for my wife doing her shopping in the nearby store so I thought I grab a bite. Well, they have a nice selection of sweets and pastries. I went for peach yogurt pie. Awsome and light! I loved it and was really tempted to order the second one but then I looked at my belly and decided to stick to one! Highly recommended.
2016-07-05,5,The bread and cakes here are really good and authentic. Sehr lecker!!The breads tend to sell out fast...for obvious reasons, so get there early ;)
2016-06-15,5,Highly recommend this place is an awesome bakery, the staff is friendly in special the owner very good person. Everything is delicious. The raspberry quark is the family favorite.
2016-06-05,5,Awesome little bakery with great tasting German desserts. Their bread is also amazing but you have to get there early or else it's gone by a certain time. Definitely stop in for a coffee and a treat. They also have outdoor seating when the weather is nice.
2016-06-01,5,Fresh, delicious, and amazing.  What more can you ask for? The croissants are perfect, the pastries are just right. I have to try out the bread next time
2016-06-01,5,Absolutely fantastic baked goods & kindhearted staff!
2016-05-14,5,The best bread in the area. That's how it should be baked. It's heavy and delicious, can last for a week on the countertop.The pastries are also great, I go there all the time to buy smth for my friends Although I didn't really enjoy the coffee, it's rather straightforward and bitter.
2016-05-07,5,Tasty Germany and European style bakery! Tried different kinds of croissant and chocolate mousse, yummy!!! Their espresso was good too! love this small bakery place!
2016-03-24,4,Happened to walk in and loved everything we tried: not too sweet strudels, moist light pastries, and the coffee was excellent too. Great quality and would have liked to try more (owner claims all German products being used.) The lady server was a bit grumpy and her face grew stern when we sat at the small bistro table. The smile came only when she saw us leave a tip (given to see if she will cheer up...she did.)
2016-03-21,5,I stop by the old german bakery as a result of a quick break after work.  When I first got in I was not sure what was the best they had so I ask for a recommendation.  I was recommended to a dessert called Quark, this is like a croissant with cheese inside but it tates different and its totally amazing.  These desert are not the typical american desserts, they taste different because they are made with different ingredients (high quality).  I highly recommend this bakery to anyone in hoboken, instead of doing a quick stop on the over rated Carlos bakery, you should definetly stop in the old german bakery.
2016-03-12,4,Cozy place! Their coffee is really good and the pastries very fresh. I will come back.
2016-03-12,5,Everything was fresh. Delicious and the coffee was good. Really good customer service. The employees were really nice and polite. Will come back
2016-03-11,4,Am I an expert on German pastries? Nein. So my uninformed opinion of the Pear and Chocolate Crescent is that it was flaky and tasty without being too sweet or doughy. The perfect on-the-go snack. The lady behind the counter was also super friendly, esp. considering I no doubt butchered the pronunciation of all of the pastry names.
2016-03-04,5,Having lived in Germany, I miss the great baked goods I used to grab on my way to classes from the local bakery. This hits the mark pretty closely, in my opinion, to many of the delicious treats I used to get. I'm only in town for an overnight business trip, but I had to hit it up again this morning for a Brotchen and to pick up a Pumpkin seed Bread to take home with me.  The marble cake tasted just like my host mom cooked it. Bravo- very delicious!!!
2016-02-27,5,I am the pickiest person when it comes to coffee, because I drink it black! German bakery does coffee right! They always take their time making it and make it right in front of me and it comes out tasting absolutely perfect. It reminds me of the coffee I used to have in Europe. I have been living in Hoboken for 5 years, and they have the best coffee here, in my opinion. The owner always greets me, even if he is busy and asks how me and my husband are doing. Even if I am walking down the street, he always waves. Maggie, who works there, is super sweet and works so hard. I love all of their pastries too and they are a good size to split, as well. Everything has always tasted so fresh and it amazes me how many things they can make each day and how fast it all goes. I go to this bakery probably three times a week for coffee and it is such a special experience. This place is a gem!
2016-02-21,1,There is nothing German about this bakery.The quality is average, but I do not understand why it is called Old German Bakery
2016-02-09,5,this place is amazing, the quality of pastries and the coffee is truly outstanding! The cream that they use is not cheap whip cream, it is light and tasty.
2016-01-18,3,We only tried the chocolate cream cake and it was light and not too sweet which was nice. The chocolate flavor wasn't strong enough for me, but it still satisfied the craving. At $6.5 for a single slice, I did think this place was slightly overpriced. The staff were also very amiable.
2016-01-16,2,stay away from the rye bread. You go in there on a saturday morning expecting freshly baked bread and you get yesterdays bread thats worse then what they sell at grocery stores. The pastries are average. Waste of calories and unworthy of the bakery name.
2016-01-10,4,We bought some fruit popped cakes to bring home and they were delicious! A bit pricey... two peices of cake 13 dollars?  But I can't buy something fresh like this at my local food store so I found them to be worth the price.
2016-01-07,3,The service is friendly and the place is cozy and immaculate, but the inventory isn't too expansive. I can somewhat appreciate this, however, since a smaller spread leads me to believe the limited goods they do offer are fresh. But for the amount of turnover one would expect in Hoboken, especially on Washington St., I was hoping for more options. The prices reflect the location, but given the choice between this place and Carlo's down the street, I'd take the Old German any day.
2015-12-13,3,Dropping a star for service issue. Actually what service? Some things I recommend you say..."Hello""Can I help you?""Do you have any questions?""Who's next?"Instead I was virtually invisible until I walked out.Regardless of the quality of the food, I like to at least be acknowledged.Maybe it's time to explore bakeries in JC.
2015-12-09,1,I was meeting up with a friend at the Starbucks,but wanted to sit somewhere quiet,so my companion chose this place. I ordered a medium hot chocolate and it had no taste and wasn't hot..Lol I inquired about a raspberry /cheese  pastry/tart,and couldn't  find the sign explaining  about the dessert.The owner pointed to a sign located no where near where the pastry  was located and asked me in a condescending  way if I had a problem understanding english? I almost cursed him out,but I was with someone and there were other ladies in the store so I didn't want to make a scene. I was ready to buy the dessert  but the owner pissed me off!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY,I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THAT BAKERY AGAIN!! NEXT TIME  SPEAK TO YOUR CUSTOMERS WITH PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT!!!!
2015-12-03,5,I love this place, especially their fresh roasted/brewed coffee. I've never had their baked goods cause I keep stopping here for coffee but it's on my list of things to try. They also have outdoor seating which is perfect when the weather is nice.
2015-11-26,5,Revisited this place after almost two years and I had to say the low rating I gave last time was simply because I have ordered the wrong food! So this time, got the almond vanilla bar (filling inside, fluffy and yummy) with coffee.They open even on thanks giving morning - add one star right away. I was literally running alongside Washington street and everybody is closed!
2015-11-25,5,Walk away if you're not prepared to gain some serious weight from here. I'm not kidding. I had to join a gym to offset the amount of pastries I have from the Old German Bakery. The owner (I unfortunately don't know his name) once encouraged me to "try everything". I laughed him off but over the weeks and months found myself doing exactly what he said. I'll list all of the "gotta have it" items that I strongly recommend: pear and chocolate strudel, plumb crumb, sweet pretzel, quark balls, apple strudel, butter pretzel.Try the egg sandwich if you come here in the morning. Sliced hard boiled eggs, sliced tomato, mayo, pickles, salt and pepper on a hard roll. Interesting and different and DELICIOUS.
2015-11-25,1,I went there with my parents. We order a pastry each and two of them were ok, but mine was dry and definitely not fresh from the day. I asked for a glass of water and my dad had to stand up at some point and ask at the bar for that glass again because I never got it.He then paid our order and came back. We stayed there for a while, and when we were leaving, the lady behind the counter said "Excuse me, can you pay me?". It was really embarrassing. We had already paid and we had to wait for her to double check in the computer that it was true. There were only 3 more tables with people at the café, was it that difficult to keep track? Definitely will not go back.
2015-11-03,5,I love this place. This is the place I come to always when I crave for a delicious cake, donut or other pastries. Everything in the bakery that's made tastes so delicious and so is the coffee. The environment is excellent and so is the owner's attitude. I highly recommend this place .
2015-10-30,5,I am so happy I finally stopped in to try. I have been walking by this bakery for about a year and always thought it just sold bread, but I finally popped in today after reading the reviews and was so happy. I ordered a quark ball, the raspberry cheese beehive danish and a slice of cake which looked like cheesecake/cream with some sort of jam. Everything was fresh, delicate and outstanding. Just the right amount of sweet, soft flakey pastry, very high quality.I am Polish American and am a big fan of true European pastry, not the oversweet commercial fluff sold in most bakeries here in America (sorry Carlos!) Thrilled I finally found a place to buy my pastries and cakes, I will certainly become a regular here over time :)
2015-10-24,2,The place is not authentic at all. They have a German pretzel that is filled with butter.  However, people who ordered it loved it.  I tried the regular salted pretzel and the strudel and it was great!! Also excellent coffee. I would go back again for the pastries but not if I am wanted authentic German breakfast.
2015-10-13,2,It's ok - I'm spoiled by my monthly trips to Germany.  So I have access to their baked good on the regular so I was looking for something on this side of the pond.  Quaint but misses the mark (not the duetch version)
2015-10-13,4,The pastries are delicious (especially the pear/chocolate one), that can't be denied.I deducted one star because the owner is arrogant and I probably won't be coming back because his attitude during a friendly chat got very bizarre.
2015-10-06,4,The Apple Turnover is da bomb. Da bomb! Good coffee, tried some other pastries, nothing else really caught my fancy. Nice place to spend some time reading the paper with a cup of joe and a pastry.
2015-09-17,5,This place is special: charming, friendly, equally a place to sip your tea or to chatter with friends over coffee and pastries. And oh, the pastries. Everything from the cakes to cookies and croissants is subtly sweet, just enough to be wonderful. The first time I walked in on a snowy day last year, I asked the owner for a recommendation that wasn't overly sweet. He laughed and said it must be my first time there before leaning to a delicious slice of chocolate and cherry cake. I've come back for the hospitality and the sweets ever since.
2015-09-02,5,Skip the long lines at Carlos and try this place, it is fantastic!  The quark balls, which I had never tried before, were absolutely delicious, as was the pear and chocolate strudel I bought on my first trip.  That combination though... worth the extra cardio!  On my second I got a chocolate and vanilla crescent but they were out of quark balls!  I did get there late, though, so I'd recommend trying to get there as early as possible: they sell out!Add to that the amazing service I get every time I walk in; the man behind the counter is very honest and accommodating, full of information and very friendly.  Great service paired with great food means they have a new repeat customer.  Check them out!
2015-08-25,5,The coffee and pastries are delicious. The staff is welcoming and attentive. One of hoboken's little gems.
2015-08-15,5,The place has authentic stuff, had an almond pastry here it was just amazing so rich in taste and presentation.
2015-08-15,5,Love this bakery...there's this almond pastry filled with Bavarian cheese which is awesome
2015-08-08,5,The best bakery .. Everything is good here and not too much sweet like carlo's.. The Black Forest cake is specially nice..
2015-07-29,4,Very nice bakery . Some of the awesome pastries. Host is great . BUT the prices are on the higher side.
2015-07-14,1,The worst I could have imagined. Terrible value. All foods are over priced. Of the items I purchased, all were lacking in flavor and quite dull. I lived in Germany for awhile and there is no comparison between true Germany bakeries offering fresh pastries and this. Even other American german imitations like Reinwald's Germany bakery in Huntington are much much much better.
2015-06-17,5,If you know true German breads and pastries, you will be a huge fan! There is nothing like an authentic, crusty, hearty loaf of German bread or a great brotchen, and now they are here in Hoboken!
2015-06-14,5,OMG People, this place makes Authentic German Pastries. The lady told me they use a special cheese in the cheese pastries, and they are the only ones in the USA that use that special cheese from Germany.  I tried it and immediately became 5 years old in my Grandmas kitchen (I'm in my 40's)You will think your in Germany!!!!!!I'm 100% German too!There's a German bakery near my house (lol) and I won't think twice to drive over 50 miles to go here. One hour out of my way is so worth it!!10 STARS!!!
2015-05-22,5,The pastry at this bakery is unbelievable. One of the best pastry bakeries in the country and I have been to many.
2015-05-20,4,Nice hospitality shown by the german owner and real good cakes...Loved the great view of Hoboken's ever busy Washington Ave on a sunny saturday morning with from Old German bakery while sipping my coffee..Have to visit it again...must go...
2015-05-04,4,Visited the place last week. Nice place with small comfortable sitting area.. All things served fresh . I loved the crockery too. The person at the counter was really sweet. I loved the chocolate moose, veg patty..
2015-05-02,5,Everything in this place is awesome, but the lattes... oh the lattes... best coffee you will ever drink in your life.
2015-04-14,5,As a German expat this place is really special to me. The owner and staff are incredibly nice and are happy to explain their selection. Everything there is great, I try something new every time I go and have never been disappointed. This place is 100% authentic, so if you have experienced a bakery in Germany then you will not be disappointed by what OGB offers you!
2015-04-11,5,A good friend of mine and I were in Hoboken for brunch and afterwards we decided to try something different. We came to his place simple because it had really great yelp review. The server was very friendly. We had green tea and some cake. Both of us were very happy. Totally a must try
2015-03-17,3,Meh. There wasn't much selection the day we went in, maybe it depends on the time and day that you go. Coffee was pretty decent, prices are a little higher than normal for bakery items. As someone who had traveled a bit and been to German bakeries, I didn't find this was anything spectacular, nothing to rave about.
2015-03-10,4,I stopped at the Old German Bakery in seek of shelter from the frigid weather in Hoboken. A quaint little bakery with several great pastry options. Unfortunately for me, I arrived late afternoon and I assume all the yummy authentic pastry were already taken. The girl working behind the counter was very friendly and helped me with my selection, as my knowledge of German baked goods is very limited. I decided on a cheese filled pastry. SO GOOD! (sorry I do not recall the name). Great place to try and explore new deserts.
2015-03-01,5,This place is a great stop in hoboken for coffee and delicious pastries! The service is excellent and very friendly! Always willing to give suggestions and tell you about each pastry!
2015-01-19,4,Original rye bread that taste great! The rye bread is often sold out though so come early.
2015-01-14,4,Walked in pretty late, around 8pm, so sadly many of the fresh pastries were gone.  I got a piece of chocolate cake and tea (they carry Mighty Leaf, which is my favorite bagged brand) and sat down.The presentation of everything was nice and the shop has a warm feel to it. Perfect on a cold December evening.My cake was enjoyable, though not mind blowing.  It was not too sweet, just right, with hits of creamy chocolate pieces throughout that added moisture to this slightly dry cake.  Went well paired with my hot drink. I hope to try the desserts everyone's yelping about sometime.
2015-01-11,4,Delicious! Owner came and talked to us, very nice gentlemen. His daughters art work is displayed on the wall behind the register, so cute!! We loved the pastries and coffee and cappuccino, would come here again!
2015-01-09,5,This place is the cutest bakery on Washington in my opinion and the deserts are so good plus their coffee is to die for. The owner is really nice also and seems so happy all the time, which makes it inviting.
2015-01-03,5,Excellent selection, service, coffee, and food. By far the best bakery in Hoboken. Not a gimmick...very authentic.
2014-12-29,4,One of the best, hottest, strongest coffees in Hoboken. You heard me right.Always frothed milk and the owner (who's there all z time) says it's straight from Austria. Take it to go or enjoy it in a perfect little OGB cup and saucer.Now the PASTRIES are something to write home about, too. About 10 kinds each time I go. This past time I got a raisin croissant, which was excellent. But don't be afraid to try something new. Like one filled with (quark?). Soft, sweet cheese.Prost!
2014-12-22,5,The best coffee and food I have ever had. Drove from Brooklyn, New York to buy their Stollen. The absolute best! Will be back. Nicest owner.
2014-12-08,4,We decided to stop by after lunch this weekend, and I am glad we did.  We ended up picking up a Chocolate Dome Cake and a Raspberry Layer cake (I'm probably butchering the names of the cakes but the top layer of one of the cakes is covered with raspberry and the other is a circular chocolate cake with a hard outer-shell).  They were both not overwhelmingly sweet so you are able to really taste the cake.  It was super moist even though we stopped by around 3PM and there were only a few slices of various cakes left.  The cake was light and fluffy and truly a wonderful dessert after a meal.  It is not heavy and overwhelming, so you do not feel like you indulging.   It is a little pricier but worth the occasional treat to yourself and that special someone.  I would have to agree with previous yelpers, the lack of labels is a bit annoying but luckily we came at a time when the store was not super busy and the staff took their time and explained each cake to us.
2014-12-02,5,We stopped on are way home from Westminster. I MY GOODNESS ever thing was very good. The guy helping us was wonderful.
2014-11-20,3,Full disclosure, my appraisal might be a bit unfair. I walked in sick with a cold and craving a very specific comfort food that exists, but 100 miles away. It is a sweet potato layer cake with a cinnamon triple sec glaze, cinnamon cream cheese frosting on the layers, and caramel buttercream on top. You see? Now you're craving it too, as you should.Regardless, I had my heart set on cake. The first issue is they have no labels for the assortment of cakes and pastries. There were several patrons behind me and I felt bad holding them up inquiring about every single item. Furthermore, the explanations from the clerk were vague, at best.The second issue is that each item was in very short supply. I was going to get the last slice of beehive cake, but I could hear the man behind me audibly wince when I asked about it. Trust me, I know that should have increased my sense of urgency, but my conscience got the best of me.I settled on two types of hazelnut treats, not because I wanted two cakes but because none really jumped out at me. One was a straightforward layer cake with hazelnuts in cream icing. The cake was stale and bland. I abandoned it after a few bites. The other was more of a shortbread dipped in chocolate topped with a layer of diced hazelnuts and honey. The chocolate was waxy and flavorless, but the rest of it was nice. It gained steam with each bite possessing a flavor profile reminiscent of baklava. These two pastries rang in at $12. Not exactly highway robbery, but not a great value either. I won't be rushing back.
2014-10-24,2,This is our second time there. First time, we came in right after they opened. And decided, maybe things will get better after a while, so decided to pop in again a year later.The pastry is totally unimaginative and plain. Cakes are filled with whip cream (seriously?). Couple boring cakes and some cheesecake.VERY PRICEY!  $6 for a tiny slice of cake?! Go to LaIsla, few blocks over, at least there you get an atmosphere and desserts (while, by far not the best in town) that will be original.Decore that says "corporations, welcome!" (aka:bland colors and atmosphere)Unimpressed.Not coming back.
2014-10-17,5,My German oasis in Hoboken. No nned to bake your own bread. Everything is authentic, the bread worth every slice. My favorite pastry is the cherry strudel.Could be a bit more cozy, especially outside!PS: I just moved here a year ago from Germany. I know what I am talking about!
2014-10-11,3,Cute little German bakery/cafe.  Can't say I'm in love with the place, but it gave me enough reason to be willing to come here again.  Had a piece of their vanilla sheet cake, and a croissant.  The vanilla cake was not bad, crumbly and moist; flavored well, and not too sweet.  However, the croissant was disappointing being a somewhat dry, and with an odd aftertaste that was...too buttery?  Hard to explain, but i do not recommend.  Had a cup of coffee also, which was rather bland, and don't recommend unless you are really craving caffeine.
2014-10-04,4,Absolutely love this place! The owner told us all dishes and cups were imported from Germany, so as the ingredients. Everything was made at the store. We have been to this place a several times and tried different items each time. They were never disappointed us.
2014-09-07,4,One word of advice- they are closed during some summer months, so make sure you check it out before they do! I came here with my friend one morning, after walking along the water, and we were ordered some cappuccinos and picked up some pastries to enjoy outside. One was cheese and berry filled and another was a chocolate croissant. If you want to enjoy a nice morning outside and fill up on some German goods, check it out!
2014-09-05,4,Great outdoor space to grab a coffee in summer. Try the chocolate-pear croissant and plum crumb cake - both are delish and will leave you asking for more. The staff is always polite & very helpful.A Hoboken gem.
2014-09-01,5,Old German Bakery will make you feel like you're right in Deutschland. Pastries are excellent homemade treasures, particularly the raspberry cake. However, to me, what separates them is their coffee. In my eyes, it's the best coffee in all of Hoboken. Imported from Europe, it is truly on an honor to take a sip from this roasted delicacy. Bonus: the owners are truly nice, genuine people who you should get to know.
2014-07-21,5,This place is amazing, everything tastes so good. Origionally I was going to go to Carlos bakery with family, but had such an insane line we oppted out. But here we got about 5 of the small iteams in the case. My favorite dessert was the cherry squares with crumble, not quite sure the exact name. A close second was the berry pastry with sweet cheese, it looked like a honey comb on top(So Pretty). It tastes like cheese cake with berries and flakey pastry. The others were tasty as well, the only one I was not wide about was the apple strudle. So happy I went here, an amazing find.
2014-07-19,5,Very authentic German Bakery!! Fine quality baked goods and cakes that are not so terribly sweet but have just the right amount of sweetness. Love this place!!!! Staff is friendly and prices are good. Also had a cappuccino: yummy as well. It's worth a visit!
2014-07-11,4,Maybe even a 5. When I went in during my lunch hour I was given a walk through on what each pastry was and what was missing. Told me his favorites which was the chocolate and vanilla filled pastry and quark. He was very nice and helpful. I appreciate that he took the time to tell me about everything since it was my first visit. I went home with a box full of pastries.I got the chocolate and pear pastry. Brought it home to my guy and he said "very tasty" and kept eating high praise from a discerning palate. I had to take it away so he would have room for the other pastries I got. And so I could have another bite. Very nice, the chocolate was great not too sweet. A Light crunchy and flaky crust, had to stop myself from finishing it. Definitely my favorite.The chocolate vanilla filled pastry which was the German's favorite had nice flavors but the pasty was a bit denser then I want. We decided it was a "manly man"s pastry", which makes me like it more. The Quark's were good not quiet as addictive as he said but very yummy and you would eat them when in front of you but I'm not diving into the bag for more. Maybe i just want to express my free will once told they are addictive.I also got two cakes; the chocolate with cherry on top and the mixed berry. Mixed berry is nice, light and good textures. The chocolate with cherries, well I wasn't taken with the cherries but I loved the flavors and textural weirdness of the chocolate cake.
2014-06-09,5,Every time I go here, the owner impresses me with the quality of the food that I try. I recommend the pretzels, quark balls, and the strudel (they are all my favorites, but you really can't go wrong there). Also, the German Chocolate cake is amazing.
2014-05-17,1,Overpriced, mediocre cake.We bought 3 pieces of cake, 2 of which where just small fruit bars, only one was a slice from a layer / cream cake. They charges us 18 dollars.The fruit bars were dry and not very tasty on top of that.
2014-04-27,4,I've made a second stop here after two years - after the first one (which would have earned two stars maximum), I said I'd never shop there again. The farmer's bread I bought was dry and just ok, the pretzels (3) were a huge disappointment as they were at least a day old (in southern Germany, no one would dare to sell day-old pretzels). The Berliner (jam-filled donuts) were quite fresh and tasty - but all together so NOT worth the almost $17.but chance had it I was in the neighborhood and I figured I'd get a piece of cake today to go with the coffee I had already had in hand. I'm giving the single piece of German cheesecake-like dessert with canned mandarin oranges on top four stars because it was quite fresh and good.BUT - at $6.50 for a maybe 5oz slice (not big, likely one twelfth of a ten-inch round cake), this treat is ridiculously overpriced. I know it's beside any point to compare prices, but this "Mandarinen Käsekuchen" costs about EUR 1.50 in every bakery I know in Germany. Equally good slices at Heidi's bakery in Ridgewood, NJ cost around $4.Also, I watched the German-speaking woman behind the counter not ring me up but simply open the register and give me my meager change and no receipt. That means money right into one's (company) pocket. At roughly $80 per cake that can't cost more than $10 including labor, I just took part in supporting someone's well-buttered (pardon the pun) business scheme.If someone knows how much are shop rents on Washington street and wants to make a case for poor shopkeepers, please enlighten me.SO - four stars for current food experience, barely one star for worthiness.
2014-04-12,4,Very friendly and very hearty,yummy bread. Got the rye and enjoyed it to the last bite!
2014-04-05,4,I really enjoy the coffee here. I'm not sure what they used but is good. Quark balls are a tasty donutty/zeppole like snack that are good too. The apple crumb cake was very fresh and I enjoyed it. The man behind the counter ( owner?) is always helpful and friendly. Nice spot for coffee and a sweet treat.
2014-04-05,5,Yum! I love this place as much as I dislike Carlos Bakery, which is just a couple of blocks away. This place has the genuine warmth, taste and variety of an old-fashioned quality bakery and lacks all the pretentiousness and arrogance of its loud "made-for-TV" neighbor. Love the almond bars, quark balls, chocolate cake and almost everything else here.
2014-03-31,5,Excellent 100% excellent! Service was impeccable & the goodies were exquisite!  Will be back when I have another cheat day & I'm in the area!
2014-03-15,4,The pretzels here are amazing. Just like in Germany! Definitely try the quark also, really good stuff. And any cake with berries on it.
2014-03-13,4,Old German Bakery is small, it has about 6 tables. However it's very warm and inviting. The gentleman who worked this past Sunday is so nice and welcoming. We tried:Wild berry cake with a cream filling is just ok. Cinnamon roll/pastry is really goodRaspberry and cheese Danish is perfectly balanced. The fillings complement each other without one over powering the other, like some pastries do.Quark is a must have. They are fluffy, airy, eggy ( in a good way) ,little pillows of awesomeness!To top it all off the cappuccino is one of the best I have ever had. I didn't need nor wanted to add anything to it.
2014-02-26,4,Great pastries!! The owner I so nice, he is always smiling. He never has problem to tell you what the pastries are made off
2014-01-19,5,If you're ever in Hoboken, you have to go here! I went with my friend, and it was amazing. The gentleman behind the counter (based on his German accent, I assumed he was the owner) was so nice, he patiently explained what every delicious looking confection was, and when he found out it was my friend's birthday he gave us two complimentary quark balls. I'm so glad he did because they were INCREDIBLE. If you go, you must try the quark balls. The almond paste-filled pastry was also great. I want to go back and try everything!
2014-01-18,4,Instead of hitting up Carlos' Bakery (because the line was ridic) we decided to hit this place up, thanks to the  Yelp reviews. Forgive my memory, I don't quite remember the goodies we got from here, but they were delectable. I had a white cake with raspberry on top, 2nd favorite of the 3 we tried. Sis had a chocolate cake which was light and was perfectly moist. Best one goes to the cheesecake type with a swirl of red on top. Yuumy!  The coffee was awesome, according to my fellow foodies. I'm sure the rolls and sandwiches are good as well but unfortunately didn't get to try em. The shop had a few tables & was cozy.
2014-01-09,4,Some of the most delicious German pastries. Their apple streusel is amazing as is their German chocolate cake.
2014-01-05,5,So this this is my first yelp review and I could not pick a better place.  From the courteous staff to amazing everything else.We come to the bakery once a week as a treat.  Further more, every time we have guests we just stop in and point to a few random pastries and call desert part of the meal done!The one advice I can say is to not to wait until closing time as options will be very limited.
2013-12-20,4,Try anything. Just close your eyes and point. You won't be disapointed.
2013-11-08,3,I like it here.  It's a nice little bakery.  I'd say it wasn't divine or anything, but I will be back when I want some baked goods - but only when I'm randomly out for a walk.  I don't envision myself making a detour to specifically come.
2013-10-31,5,What a find! Not wanting to wait in line at Carlo's we took a little walk to find another bakery and ended up here. ALL of their pastries that we tried (we tried 5) were delicious and some still warm out of the oven. Homemade, not overly sweet, and a great combination of flavors describes the desserts here well. The coffee and cappuccinos are very good as well, nice and strong. I would definitely go back and recommend this place. Oh, and on top of the delicious food, the staff and presumably the owner were very nice and willing to answer any questions.
2013-10-24,5,How did I not know about this place any sooner? How could I have walked passed it so many times and not known!I ordered a vanilla almond cake and a nutella filled croissant. Both were delicious. The cake was soft and the filling was air-y. The star had to be the nutella filled croissant. So choco-hazelnutty! I'm literally dying from goodness. Also, because I told myself I'd save the other halves for my bf. -___-A little more than $9 for both pastries. Worth it.
2013-10-19,4,Get the latte. Most cafes and bakeries add too much milk and you can't taste the coffee. Old Herman makes it with fresh rich espresso that you can taste as you sip your latte.
2013-10-12,4,came in for a coffee and cherry strudel. It was tasteyyy!!!!! (although not cheap - I guess you get what you pay for) Will come back
2013-10-07,5,Tasty German sweets,  European style coffee and the sweetest owner!  Will return for sure when I hoboken . A jem in the neighborhood
2013-09-23,5,Came in here mid-day on a sunday, the "German" in bakery got our attention for a quick pastry and its a choice of the same old Starbucks, Panera, or Dunkin for coffee... Well,  the place was full of people so I decided for a later return.  A Great choice it was, the service was great and the excellent staff. We had the chocolate pastry w. powder, the crumb cheese cake, the coffee... Great, great, and great= Great choice to end my day and 5 stars!
2013-09-23,4,bit pricey, but the best cake shop in the Hoboken/jersey city area.  give it a try.  yum!
2013-08-26,4,I love this shop - good ol' rustic pastries for a morning snack or a great pick-up treat when visiting clients.
2013-07-20,5,Great coffee and a great team of employees who work hard and give their best at their service. Their pastries are delicious and I will definitely be coming back and supporting this great place in the future.
2013-07-07,5,My husband and I had been to this place in the past for their fabulous pastries and coffee. On my husband's birthday, I called to order for a cake but the store owner took extra effort to walk me through a wide variety of pastries and helped me order the best birthday dessert for my husband and our friends at the party... Such a delightful ending to his birthday surprise.  Now every time we need desserts for our guests, Old German Bakery is our go to place. This place has our business for as long as we are around :)
2013-07-04,4,I don't think that people give this a fair shake....they have some of the highest quality baked goods that Hoboken has to offer (no, Carlos' bakery is not on the list). Dome things are extremely simple and plain, others more complex but always with very good ingredients. The coffee is excellent, very European quality. The staff are OK but not necessarily overly helpful.
2013-06-21,3,You would think with a name like Old German Bakery that it's one of those old family-run businesses that was around when Frank Sinatra was a young boy singing for pennies on the street corner, so imagine my surprise to find out later that it's been open only since 2011. We were taking a leisurely stroll from the waterfront (...where I coulda been a contenduh) to Zafra Kitchen on Willow. It's hard to miss all the businesses in a row on bustling Washington Street, but this one caught my eye with the hot pink umbrellas and of course, the name (photo: bit.ly/14NSE5w). I led Jamie W. astray by making a beeline to see what aromatic, old-world baked goods they had on display (photo: bit.ly/14aifTv).Front and center were their specialty, Quark Balls or more authentically, Quarkbällchen, which looked like a big tray of donut holes with powdered sugar (photo: bit.ly/1azpQjJ). Quarks, as I recall from my astronomy classes at Berkeley were related to atomic particles that cannot be directly observed. Well, I thought that was good since maybe I wouldn't be seen should I decide to wolf down a dozen at 75-cents each. At least that's how I justified buying a couple of them for me and Jamie to try. Quark, as it turns out, is a curd cheese that according to the framed description, "can be eaten as a health food". Hmmm. All I know is that a very yeasty texture and a too-sweet interior didn't make us hanker for more balls. Nice servers though.BAKED GOODS - 3 stars...German donut holes not quite what I was hoping forAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...nice, contemporary spaceSERVICE - 4 stars...charmingTOTAL - 3 stars...I am an expert on balls after all (review: bit.ly/17rIfQB)
2013-06-02,3,I walked by a few times after my 15-mile long training run from the other state, today I had my Thanksgiving balloon training nearby so I decided to check it out before going to Citi Field  for my MLB All-Star Game info session (I'm a busy person.) I love German food! As I walked in I saw a lot of interesting pastries and cakes and after I scanned through the counter I decided to go with an Almond Roll and of course a cup of coffee! Everything looked pretty, though the wait of the coffee was a little long since they were making it from the espresso machine European style. I dined in so they put everything on *a real plate* and the coffee in *a ceramic mug*. The Almond Roll was tasty with a lot of flavor in it, and the coffee was perfect with crema on top. Love real coffee, which bought back my experience in Europe. There was no need to put cream or sugar in it.The bakery is run by a family I don't think they are German but that doesn't matter. The owner's daughter Arsima is cute, she is 3-1/2 years old and she likes to draw. They put up a lot of her drawings on the wall behind the counter. The bakery shop is clean but the decor is kind of bland. A lot of people came in today and bought cakes I think I will stop by again and try those so I can update this review.Overall, I like this place in HoBo.
2013-05-25,3,Tried an assortment of pastries here. Some were hits, some were misses. The quark balls (German donuts) were pretty tasty. Their tarts satisfied as well. Coffee/latte is strong and good. Some misses include the chocolate German cake and crumb cake. Both didn't taste that fresh to me. Perhaps they were a day or two old.
2013-03-31,5,Great local bakery! The owner is so nice and very knowledgable of the items he's selling. The best coffee in town, hands down. The baked goods I've tried so far are delicious - not super sweet, very fresh tasting - I can't wait to try more!
2013-03-14,4,I've walked by this place for months now, but now on a date with an actual German, I figured he might appreciate the fresh baked goods and coffee. If only I'd known he actually preferred tea... I had an almond roll and a late. Both were very good. The place was pretty empty. The owner is very gregarious and an expat from Germany. He was chatting us up over our hot libations. He mentioned this place might be moving into the city soon, so get your strudel while you still can.
2013-02-22,5,I came here once for coffee and pastries with my Fiance. The atmosphere is lacking but the coffee was excellent and so were the pastries.
2013-02-18,4,I was fortunate to walk past this bakery when it was the store's anniversary, so they had a really good deal on their pastries that I could not pass up on.This German Bakery has a wide selection of baked goods, including cakes, rolls, croissants, pastries, brownies, pretzels, and etc.  I had a tough time deciding what I wanted to try.  I ultimately bought an apple berliner, apple turnover, raspberry/vanilla turnover, and a quark ball (mini-donut that has a cheesy flavor to it) My friends and I who have tried these all agree that they were ALL delicious!  My personal favorite was the apple turnover, full of flavor and sweetness!  The apple berliner was such a bargain (normally priced $1) and it can fill you up pretty well if you like apples.  The berliner is just dough with chucks of apple inside, simple, yet satisfying.The staff was very friendly and suggested me to get a variety of their baked goods.  If I had a larger stomach, I definitely would have!  There are so many desserts that seem very tempting to try here and I would need to come back and try more of their creations.In addition, they have a nice selection of coffees and even sandwiches, so you can have a full meal too if you wish, ending with a delicious dessert!
2013-02-04,5,So happy this place opened. Amazing fresh baked breads and amazing pastries! I went to Germany 3 years ago and every time I step into this place I feel like I'm back in Hamburg! 5 stars, two thumbs up.. Kudos!
2013-01-21,4,Every pastry I've had here has been superb and if you enjoy a good, strong coffee, you have to get a cup here. The owner is extremely friendly and is always happy to tell you about the selection or recommend something if you can't make a decision (sometimes its overwhelming).
2013-01-06,4,Wife and I came here in the evening and got the peach yogurt cake, cherry vanilla crumb cake, and a cup of coffee. Everything was great, especially their coffee, which tastes a lot better than Starbucks. I think it would be better to come here in the morning though, as the pastries would probably be more fresh at that time. Still, even in the evening, it was really good.The staff is always very friendly and helpful, which I really appreciate.
2012-12-31,3,Nice place but way expensive for the quality.  Cakes are not that tasty surprisingly...could' ve been much better
2012-12-27,4,Amazing bake shop, amazing products, great and friendly staff! Too bad it's just a tad on the expensive end, but hey you pay for quality!Would come back and splurge if my things allow it!!!
2012-10-28,5,This is a fantastic bakery with wonderful German pastries. Whenever I am looking for a treat in the Hoboken area I always find myself turning to the Old German Bakery. The items are unique since there is no other bakery like this in the area. The chocolate and fruit pastries are my favorite.
2012-10-22,4,German quark balls in my mouth are amazing!  I love Quark balls! Hehehe.  Sorry, but I had to get that off my chest!  I am a huge fan of fried bread in general: Donuts, Zeppoles, Trini Floats, churros.  I haven't met a piece of fried bread I didn't like, and Quarks are no exception.  Quark balls are amazing circles of fried bread/donuts with a somewhat sweet glaze.  Not very sweet at all, and the balls themselves are perfect, moist, and fluffy on the inside.  Five stars for the Quark.On to the rest of the offerings, I had a slice of the Behive Cake (Light sweet yeast dough filled with a fluffy vanilla custard & cream. The caramelized almond topping) which was amazing!  The almond honey topping is kind of like a brittle and nicely compliments the yummy cream filling.  Not too sweet with great flavors.  My friend had the cinnamon roll which was good, but nothing mind blowing.  The drip coffee was strong and I had a double espresso which wasn't very good.  Service was friendly but fell a little short.  The inside of the café is a little small and claustrophobic, but there are a few tables outside.I will definitely be back.  My advice is try the over-the-top looking stuff and leave the apple turnovers and cinnamon rolls to someone else.
2012-10-15,5,My friends and I live in Jersey City and had a ridiculous craving for donuts. Jersey City seriously needs to step up its game when it comes to bakeries! After calling maybe 3 or 4 places in Jersey City asking whether they had donuts, we decided to just make the drive to Hoboken. We came across Old German Bakery on Yelp. SO glad we did. We hadn't eaten lunch yet so it was hard to not buy every pastry donut and slice of cake in the bakery. I narrowed it down to 3 items: the danish with plum filling and crumble on top, custard filled donut (we spent such a long time searching for donuts, how could we have not gotten a donut?), and one of those, I think they're called quark balls? They're on display on the counter. I think the danish with the plum filling was the best. Super moist and I loved the plum filling. The filling in the donut was really good but the dough itself was a little dry. Quark ball was great too. Apparently they have "happy hour" from 7 to 9 and its 40% off. Would definitely recommend this bakery and since its a little pricey (I think I spent about $11 bucks on the 3 items), I would definitely come back for happy hour. Well worth the prices though.
2012-10-07,5,We love old German bakery at anytime of day from the baked goods to the fresh cakes I have a few favorites but can not decide on just one. Right now my fav is the marzipan Danish omg I can keep eatting them all say long. The staff is friendly and always is pleasant. We will be back soon this is our regular weekend stop!
2012-08-31,5,i am from germany and have been missing certain specialties for years. then i stumbled upon this place and was saved. donauwelle, schwarzwaelder...vollkornbrot...brezeln....strudel...all the good stuff, presented in an authentic way (even the countertop is brought over...).  heaven.
2012-08-30,5,I'm from Germany and I was so happy to see this place.  It made my day. Wait no it didn't bc EATING their cakes made my day.  Their black Forrest cake is spot on! It is legit! Seriously it reminDs me of my aunts cakes back in Bavaria and my aunt is good! I love this place.  I just ordered a bread cutting machine and will be getting my bread here in the morning in Saturday.  I'm so super excited.    Eating here reminds me of Germany minus the scenery.  But hey it's NYC ... But at least it's 100% Germany in my mouth! Love this place!!!
2012-08-25,4,Old German Bakery is an amazing place for breakfast or the not-so-heavy lunch! Friendly environment and great service in a beautiful neighborhood. Yes, its a bit on the pricey side but I've only been once on a recent trip and thought it was worth the pretty penny. Couldn't move afterwards.. Due to over-satisfied belly!
2012-08-23,3,This is barely scratching a 3, barely.  Their pastries were subpar, especially for what i paid for.  I was expecting more.  The location is convenient, nice design, and very inviting.  I might have caught them on their "off day."  So I will try again.  Remember, you can't make a final judgement about a place by going just once.
2012-08-19,4,I got a few pastries from here since I love German food.  I don't remember the names of what I got since it was a few weeks ago, but rest assured, it was all yummy!  Friendly staff too!
2012-08-16,5,Best bakery!!! all the cakes are great but the black forest is to die for.  They have stopped making the cake everyday- only weekends or by order.  I got the cake for my husband's bday and everybody loved it.  the coffee is good too.  I love going to this place.  so much better than Carlo's.
2012-08-07,5,This place is THE place where you can find true and original Europen taste in baked goods!  The best donuts ever!! I searched for a place where pastries and baked goods wouldn't be "pumped up" with too much sugar. I found it in this amazing place!  I must add that there is a happy hour Monday - Thursday where everything is almost half price after 7pm.  Enjoy!
2012-07-10,5,What a pleasure!  A great variety of sumptuous baked treats, and wonderful coffee.  When the coffee was served we were warned that it is strong, which it was, but just like we like it -- a European style espresso-like coffee.  It was difficult to choose among the cakes and pastries.  My husband and I chose two and shared them. Both were delicious but I am sure any other two would have been equally yummy.  We sat outside where we could savor the flavor and watch the passersby at the same time.  If I lived in Hoboken I would want to go to this place every day.
2012-07-05,3,Pretty decent bread. I was vacation and the bell hop at the hotel recommended I go there for breakfast food. The food was pretty decent but the service was insanely slow. Good food just be patient.
2012-06-26,3,Very authentic place and very good products.  Late in the day, the bread can get stale (ask when it was baked).  I'm also subtracting a star for screwing up a fairly big custom order for a party (they forgot to put one of the two things we ordered in the oven, so got delayed for an hour).  Except for the owners, the front line staff also have room for improvement in customer mindset.  I would still recommend the place, though - a very charming addition to Hoboken.
2012-06-23,4,The coffee is fresh - the baked goods are great. The donuts and ooo the chocolate pear strudel is amazing. It literally drips a rich chocolate onto you! Get napkins.  I'm going there again tomorrow morning, I need that pear strudel in my life.My mouth is drooling just thinking about it... Most of the ingredients are  imported from Germany - sooo, if you think the prices are high, well now you know why! The owner is a great guy, baking great stuff - give him some business!!
2012-06-13,5,This place is awesome! They are my go to study spot with some of the best coffee you will find in town. I also love their pastries. My favorite are the Quark Turnover and the Nutella Croissant. Their bread has proven to be delicious and fresh as well. Some of the best rye you will find in the area.I strongly recommend stopping by here :).
2012-06-12,1,Ok , everybody here talking about the best bakery in hoboken, this place it s ok, super pricey , hoboken doesn t have good pastrie places, only Ultramarinos that nobody pays attention, but americans don t understand about pastries, simple, ohhh the staff , suckkk the falafel place two blocks from there have better pastries and cheaper
2012-06-05,3,Great desserts, at par with NYC and a very friendly staff.
2012-05-23,5,Love their 7-9pm 40% off "Happy Hour." The owner is supper friendly.
2012-05-21,5,If you are looking to fulfill that craving for authentic german baked goods from that time you backpacked through Europe after college, or in my case lived in Austria for 18 years, look no further.  This is a true german bakery, run by an actual german couple that live in Hoboken. If you want to support a true local business, this is it.  To ensure that everything is authentic, they import all their ingredients from Germany and make everything fresh on site daily. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxing, exactly what you would expect at a modern german bakery. Now on to the bread. I am a Carb-a-vore and the bread and rolls are exactly what I've been pining for since moving back to the US 10 years ago. It's baked fresh every day, so go early for the best selection. Another fun treat is the german breakfast they offer. It's great to order a german breakfast, (a platter of cold cuts, cheeses, Nutella, etc, with fresh rolls in a basket) and coffee (strong coffee, as it should be) and sit at their outside tables and people watch.They also have amazing pastries. Personally I don't have a huge sweet tooth, so I generally go for the bread, but they have all the great german pastries, and I'll usually buy them to take to family in PA who aren't blessed with a bakery like this. Most aren't overly sweet, which suits me just fine, but have a wonderful balance of flavors and textures.  My personal favorites are the Quark specialties you won't find anywhere else. The Quarktaschen and Quarkballs, are the best.As you can tell I'm quite smitten with this place. I was thrilled when it opened and lived up to my expectations. I currently live quite close and so frequent the place often, and have tried most everything. When it comes time for me to move, how far I am from the bakery may play into my decision.I highly recommend you give this place a try, it's worth the trip, and the line is shorter, and the reward oh so much sweeter, than standing in line at another Hoboken bakery....
2012-04-17,5,I come all the way from Brooklyn to get these Bretzels. I even have a custom order that I've worked out with the owner! Him and the staff are so nice and the interior is warm and welcoming. This place brings me right back to Germany. I'll be back again and again.
2012-03-27,5,O.G.B. is my joint.  This is a neighborhood gem and it's only been on the block for a year.  Everything there is so good.  It's kinda old school in really vital ways.  Plus, the guy who owns it is awesome.  Ja, ich bin ein Berliner.  You down with JFK, you down with O.G.B. -- it's what's good, y'all!
2012-03-19,2,Very, very disappointed.  We walked across Washington Avenue after a great dinner at The Cuban Restaurant to try some baked goods after reading the favorable reviews on Yelp.   From 7-9 pm, Old German Bakery discounts their baked goods so I was psyched that I would get to try some baked goods at a discounted price.We ordered the apple streudel, poppyseed pastry and a hazelnut danish.All were varying degrees of inedible.  The apple streudel was filled with such tart tasting apples that my taste buds were just overwhelmed with unpleasant sourness.   The hazelnut danish was bland, boring and undersweetened, more the sweetness I would expect in a bread.  And finally, the award for the most bizarre dessert I have ever eaten:  the poppyseed pastry.  Visually, this danish looked like a  lovely square croissant that was dusted with powdered sugar and filled with poppyseed.  Well, it was filled with poppyseed but it was topped with some parmesean cheese tasting outer  crust.  It was the most nauseating combination of savory and sweet.  Finally, every danish was dry.     I understand we had slim pickins being there on a Sunday night, but at the inflated price of $4.75 a danish, we were shocked at the subpar and strange tasting pastries.  When we got home later, my husband said, "I can't believe we have to resort to eating Milano cookies for dessert."
2012-03-01,3,I just had a decent sandwich for lunch here the other day. You have the choice of ham, turkey, or salami on one of their rolls with your choice of cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I thought it was a pretty good sandwich -- it was on one of their seeded rolls and it had a good amount of substance inside. For $5, it really can't be beat. Although, I think Choc au Pain has better bread.I also thought I'd satisfy my sweet tooth and that of my co-workers by picking up a slice of something. I settled on a sliver of cherry vanilla crumb cake that wasn't labeled with a price... whoops! My mistake. That little thing was $5.50! It was pretty good, but $5.50 good? I dunno.While my sandwich was being prepared, a woman asked how much a slice of strawberry cheesecake was, and the attendant said it was $6. The woman was shocked and, needless to say, left without any cheesecake. As she left, she yelled out the door to her friend, "$6 for a slice of cheesecake?!"
2012-02-27,5,Cute store, friendly service, delicious pastries, and strong coffee. A dangerous combination if there ever was one. Thank goodness they're located in Hoboken and not in the city, or I know I would give in to my crumb cake cravings far too often! My friend and I stumbled upon this place after seeing the ridiculous line for Carlo's Bakery (is it really worth it?!). The man who greeted us behind the counter was so sweet and gave us a description of each and every pastry they had displayed. My friend chose the almond crumb cake, and I went with the butter crumb cake. Hers was unbelievable - it was so much lighter than we expected it to be, and it had just the right touch of sweetness and nuttiness. Mine was exactly what I had wanted and expected - a dense, buttery cake with large chunks of crumb topping. Delicious. Top it all off with strong, European-style coffee, and I'm about as happy as can be. Definitely visit the Old German Bakery if you're ever in Hoboken!
2012-02-27,5,My favorite bakery in town.  Everything is good.  I especially love the pastries....they have a good variety of pastry types and all different fillings.  They have some pastries filled with various berries, which are very good, but usually I don't have that much of a sweet tooth and go for the more savory fillings such as quark (cheese) or nut flavor such as hazelnut.  Also love the German coffee.  The people who work there are all so nice.  It can be a little pricey but it is totally worth it.  Can't go wrong here.
2012-02-25,4,Nice lil spot on Washington St..a lot of people were getting coffee here..we got the Raspberry Quark Basket..apparently Quark is some kinda German cheese, we also got their sunflower seed bread and dinner rolls to go..everything we got here was very fresh and tasty. The pricing here is on the higher side but worth it!
2012-02-24,4,After my trip to Hamburg, I've been looking everywhere for quark balls. Thankfully, this lovely bakery had them right around the corner!Delicious, light, fluffy quark balls. So tasty. They're not displayed with the other pastries in the case but in a nice little stand above the case which leads me to believe they're usually overlooked. Get them if available! A nice, small, much improved munchkin treat. Tried their croissants as well. The glaze is way too sticky and causes my teeth to stick together. Expand your German offerings like the berliners and quark balls and leave the croissants to the French!
2012-02-11,5,I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the apple turnovers and strudel here... so yummy!Everyone that works here is so nice too. I think the owners are around a lot and they are great.
2012-01-10,5,We happened on this bakery by chance when we got off the bus from the Port Authority on our way to Carlos Bakery further up Washington Street --- what a treat! It's as authentic a German bakery as I've seen in the US --- a great selection of breads, rolls and pretzels, plus delicious pastries and cakes the likes of which you rarely see in the US. Several flavors of gugelhupf, fruit and cheese cakes and pastries, all kinds of strudels, lots of marzipan and almonds, and a really unique and delicious pastry "basket" with rasberry jam and quark. The rasberry and quark basket is the best pastry I've had since the tiramisu at Ferrara Bakery in Little Italy. The emphasis on wondereful breads and rolls, as well as their great selection of sweets, makes the Old German Bakery quite different from Carlos, where everything seems supersweet by comparison. Don't miss sampling the treats here, either as part of a trip to Carlos, or as a stop by itself.
2012-01-09,5,ALWAYS love going here!!! i live in town and get sick of hanging out and supporting Starbucks so I take advantage of Old German Bakery's free wifi, extremely friendly staff and amazing food...ummm and most especially...their GERMAN COFFEE!!! it is quite fantastic! i'm a coffee snob but i really love their coffee....not sure how they prepare it, but it looks freshly french pressed with a layer of a lighter brown foam resting on top...yum! very classy place! LOVE the owner!!!! so unbelievably nice!!!
2011-12-16,4,I was so happy to find a german bakery in nj, I love real german bakeries. This is as close as it gets in germany. I love broetchen (roll's) if you have been to germany you know what its like to have one of these bakeriers in your life :) Their plum cake is really good and authentic. They do a great job hands down, now the reality of this place.. Its very very expensive for what you get. This is my only gripe with them is price.
2011-12-16,2,During my lunch break, my co-worker suggested that I stop by the bakery and pickup a cheesecake since I been constantly saying that I wanted a cheesecake all week long.  So I decided to try out their cheesecake. I wanted to order a whole pie but the girl behind the counter told me I would have to come pick it up later because they had to bake it. That wasn't a problem so I asked how much and she told me $40.00 for either 6 or 8 inch pie ( I forget exactly the size but I know it was 6 or 8)!!!! I definitely didn't want to spend that much money on a cheesecake. So, I opted for two single slices of premium cheesecakes. The minute I took a bite, my first thought was, " Thank  God I didn't buy a whole pie'!!The cheesecake tasted very bland and it didn't taste like a cheesecake. In addition, the slices were $4.89 each. It was definitely not worth it!
2011-12-10,3,You get what you pay.  Baked goods are amazing here!  Very elegant but also very expensive.  They offer breakfast here but only have one option which comprises of meat, cheese, and bread with coffee and OJ.  Food was not impressive and we waited OVER half an hour (we didn't get our drinks until we got our food)... which we found out that it was sitting at the counter for some time... Overall, I will not go back for breakfast but I will go back for their delicious baked goods.
2011-08-14,4,Yum, I had a cherry strudel and this cheese swirl thing (it was a pastry with gouda cheese on top). LOVED my strudel. Nice and crunchy with nuts on top and big pieces of cherry inside. Best part was that it wasn't too sweet. I loved it. The cheese thing .. not so much but it wasn't mine so I didn't care. The bad thing is that it's kind of pricey. 3.50 for a strudel but then again, the portions are pretty big. The strudel was an inch or two bigger than my hand. I'm definitely coming back for their cheese danishes!
2011-08-07,5,First off the one star ratings are really uncalled for.. seriously. Go get your pastries at Carlos, effin tourists!Stopped by for the first time with my wife this morning to grab some pastries with our coffee. Pleasantly surprised by the selection. We tried three pastries between the two of us (was which was really too much but wow, was it good). Flaky and crispy outsides without being overfilled inside. The plumb tart reminded me of my mother and grandmothers (if anything just a tad sweeter). What's more... I'm not a sweets person. I never order desserts and rarely eat cakes yet my mouth was watering over everything in the place.Service was very friendly and felt very local and casual. A definite plus. Will be trying some of the breads as the weather gets cooler with stews and heavier meals.
2011-08-06,5,I was visiting Hoboken the other day and in search for dessert just before 10pm when I stumbled upon this place.  (The posted hours say they close at 9pm, but the doors were open, and they seemed to be in no hurry to close) Everything in the dessert case looked delectable, and  the owner was very helpful in describing what the various cakes and pastries were.  I finally settled on the Black Forest cake, which was positively delicious.  What first struck me was the clean tartness of the cherries.  The chocolate cake had a very light and spongy texture, and was layered and frosted with a silky cream (not the nasty oil-based grocery store variety) that melted in my mouth, and finished with a dusting of chocolate shavings.  This overall cake was light and subtle and exceptionally good in comparison to the sugary, heavy versions of Black Forest that seem to be sold everywhere else.I paid $4.50 and thought the price was quite reasonable for the quality and compared to what a slice of cake would have cost in a restaurant or other bakery.I'd be in trouble if I actually lived in Hoboken because I'd be in this place every other day to try something new.
2011-07-31,4,First thing first ... It smells so good in the shop.They all looked delicious but I can get only one :)The owner was very friendly and helped me pick out the one I like.Will come back for sure.
2011-07-24,5,German bakery shop is the most authentic bakery shop I visited. This was my first visit to this shop and it was totally worth it. Their "black forest" is the BEST in the town.  It is that they are little pricey but guys your getting one the best quality of bakeries. So if u really enjoy authentic bakery shops then price should not matter to you that much. Lastly, I am waiting for the day when they will going to open their shop in Manhattan as well as in Edgewater NJ.
2011-07-22,2,The cheesecake here is super light- usually I opt for a richer tasting cheesecake. It also had a slight sour-ish taste, which wasn't very pleasant. The apple strudel was decent, but also very light. If you're looking for some bold flavors, or any flavor at all, don't come here- Decadent is not an adjective I'd ever use to describe their bakery items.
2011-07-08,5,I adore this place. Since it has opened I've tried around ten different things. Everything here is delicious. EVERYTHING. Though a bit pricey, their pastries are absolutely worth it. Everything is always fresh too. The older reviews mentioned how they wished they had the names and prices for each of the items. They now have this!Aside from the food being wonderful, the staff is lovely as well. The owner is always very pleasant and cheerful.
2011-06-30,5,OMG!!!! We got two things, granted 9 bucks is a lot, but you're in Hoboken and the baked goods were definitely WORTH IT!! Thee berry yogurt cake melted in my mouth like butter. It was delicious and I will be back. The chocoate and hazelnut bark was delicious because it was soft and scrumptious, but with a hazelnut top... and chocolate covered sides... delicious!! a little bit of everything in one bite!
2011-06-15,2,Tried their chocolate croissant and was surprised at how little chocolate was inside. Even with no one in the shop at the time it took about 8 minutes to get a croissant and my iced coffee.The staff didn't seem to know what they were doing. The prices are steep as well (3 dollars for a standard iced coffee?)I did enjoy the outdoor seating on a quiet Wednesday morning, however.
2011-06-12,4,Fine automotive engineering is not the only thing the Germans do well; German bread is simply the best in the world, and German pastries and cakes are delicious. It's about time someone brought this stuff to America ! This place is exactly what you will find in any bakery in Germany and the product tastes authentic too: absolutely delicious bread and cakes. I give this place 4 stars because I agree with some other reviewers that the shop could make some small fixes to improve the experience:- it would be great if they could introduce some sort of line so customers can be served more efficiently. In Germany, customers generally don't line up, but that just doesn't work here - I find that the staff often don't know what is in the products: it would be nice if they knew a bit more, and again, small signs listing the name of the product and key ingredients would be helpful and add to the experience- please display the prices !!
2011-06-05,4,Love this small little German Bakery in Hoboken!  They have a lovely sweet girl that works behind the counter.  She was very helpful explaining the desserts to my girl and I.I tried their sugar powdered ball.  Its sooo soft and fluffy it felt like you werent even biting anything when I sank my teeth through it.I also tried their ice german coffee..;)  The person who made my coffee  was the owner.  He was very nice and friendly to all his customers.  He has many loyal ones.  My girl had a sore throat so she has a hot lemon tea.  It was a bit too lemony for me, but it did help her throat ;)I would come back here and try more of their desserts.  Its not overrated like some bakeries around here haha.
2011-05-17,4,Very lovely bakery, I would say the best in Hoboken (I havent tried Cake Boss and looking at the line outside their door, I doubt I ever will try them).I'm giving them 4 stars because I'm really annoyed that they don't have the prices and names/descriptions of the goodies up. I hate to keep asking them what's in this and how much is that. Or to point out that "give me this thing over there, no not this, the one over there etc".Yummmm, wish I could be there right now!
2011-04-30,4,i love love love this place! its pricey but its soooo worth it. must try: nutell croissant, chocolate croissant, and the chocolate dome cake.
2011-03-17,5,Had their Champion Roll - figured if you are what you eat, I could use the luck.  It was a multigrain roll with sesame and other seeds on top.  I thought it was going to be stale but it tasted great!  I ate the whole thing without putting any thing on or in it.  I also tried their almond roll, which was a pastry, and although I'm not a fan with fillings, it was really good - not to overwhelming on the goo.  Didn't have any trouble with service, but went on a Thursday night and the 2 gentlemen behind the counter seems to know what all the items were.
2011-03-13,5,Everything I've tried so far tastes great. The quality of the baking and ingredients shine through. I love that they aren't heavy handed with the sugar (this is difficult to find in many American bakeries). I actually taste the freshness, the sweet and tart of the fruits in their pastries, and the nuts and creams. Whoever is baking these pastries excercises great balance and honors the integrity of the ingredients. I love everything, but my favorite right now is the plum tart! The doughnuts are great too...great cream filling and not greasy!Their coffee is lush and satifsfying, and I would go back for that alone!  I usually get their "German" coffee black, no need for cream and sugar. However, if you wish to add cream and sugar, it's just as good. Service is friendly! And comfortable chairs and lighting!  Go during weekday mornings to avoid the crowds and get your first pick on the goods. I've been there three times thus far and admit that I was a bit frustrated at first because of the delay in their lines, but they have gotten better! I'm sure their service will become more efficient as the weeks roll by, but their friendliness is already top knotch.
2011-03-04,4,Ja ja, you're all right with the kinks and some of the staff not knowing what they are selling and that it is a bit pricey. But hey, it is not a discount supermarket or mass production factory. I am German and haven't found really good fresh German bread in NJ thus far - leave alone the quest for the best Bretzel. The first I bought was slightly overdone, but the second Bretzel was really great. The Zwiebelbrot / onion bread and the Krustenbrot / crust bread were just delicious. I am from Nuremberg in the northern part of Bavaria and this crust bread was almost like home. Get some fresh cold cuts like Speck, Black Forrest Ham, Braunschweiger and some cheese from the Garden of Eden deli, open a good Hefeweizen and enjoy your Brotzeit.
2011-02-17,3,stopped by last night for some dessert.  The owner/manager recommended a chocolate cake with an apricot filling.  Apparently, it's a popular German dessert.  I've never heard of it, but we ordered it anyway. It was decent.  Not too much apricot, just a thin layer in the chocolate. We ate it.  We did see some thumbprints on the part of the frosting, which kind of bothered me.  Must have gotten there when the server pulled slice out of the fridge.  We sucessfully dissected it from the rest of the cake and kept eating.  No big deal, but they should really be more carfeul!
2011-02-13,1,German Fakery.  Come on - its not really a bakery - three loafs of bread and everything else is cut in small pieces.  I asked the women behind the counter how much the strudel costs - she said "I really don't know - I think its 3 or 4 dollars "  Well if the person serving you doesn't know how much the most basic item is - your either HIDING OVERPRICED cakes or you should just give up now!!!!  Granted i was there later on a Sunday - but the actually $4 plus with tax small piece of strudel was not only over baked to a extreme hardness but it was also stale.  Why is there a line ?? well that wont last for long.
2011-02-13,4,Come on! A German styled bakery? That is awesome! I have not tried all the strudels yet but I am a HUGE fan of the chocolate pear strudel. It is the best strudel I have ever had in my life!I don't think the service is slow but I have only been here for a couple of times... The staff is very helpful the decor is nice. (reminds me of the bratwurst stands in Frankfurt). :)The only thing... for aesthetic reasons, they should really put more loafs of breads on the racks next to the window.
2011-02-12,4,Very slow moving line but everything i've gotten has been very delicious!!!
2011-02-07,4,They have some kinks to workout, but that is to be expected with a place that just opened.  The people working there may get a bit confused, or not be the most efficient, but at least they are friendly and attentive.The two breads and a pretzel that we I tried were all pretty good.  I wanted to try some strudel, but we just picked up some cupcakes right before stopping here, and my girlfriend wouldn't let me that much of a fatty fatty no friends.They also have a limited menu with things like sandwiches, which would be worth trying, since you know the bread they are served on would be good.
2011-02-06,4,I went in a couple days after they opened, but they weren't serving the whole menu yet. I agree with many of these other posts that it seemed very disorganized, but I'm going to cut them some slack because they just opened. Their food is delicious, and as a German, I can say that their German apple pie is pretty authentic.
2011-02-03,1,Don't waste your time. Went in to buy a whole cake there weren't any. Asked about buying a sheet of coffee cake, no such luck either. Asked about buying the precut cake in display case, staff had no idea what to do. They recommend two other bakeries in the neighborhood that could accommodate me. Very disappointed, I was looking forward to a good German bakery.
2011-01-30,5,This place is awesome. I've lived in Germany for 30 years  and after a decade in the US really missed German baked goods. This place is as authentic as it gets. I typically pick up a bread and a handful of rolls on my way from work. I've enjoyed the sunflower seed bread, schwarzbrot, and the potato bread is a particular favorite. The sourdough was crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside - yum. It keeps pretty well - probably shorter than what you could store a store bought bread for, but we tend to finish a loaf up within 3 days anyway. The rolls are good, but you may have to toast them after a day to get them back to form. In terms of sweets, I've tried apple and plum cakes and they were very good. It's not cheap, but you pay for quality.
2011-01-29,4,Just tried a mozzarella snail... it was very delicious.  A flat swirl of flaky bread w/ just the right amount of cheese.  I was looking for a savory treat, and this definitely delivered.  Can't wait to try their sweets and other pastries that looked very appetizing.
2011-01-29,5,I'm completely astounded that this place received bad reviews. We visited there today and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the breads and pastries (we bought quite a few to bring home). If you're looking for the sickly-sweet-make-all-my-teeth-fall-out dessert, this is not the place for you--best go to the overrated and predictable bakery down the road with the endless tourist lines or the commercially-outsourced-just-above-supermarket-quality Crumbs. OGB is a place of artisan quality, hence, the price--which really isn't that expensive if you consider that it appears the ingredients they use are of high quality (I'm basing this on the sunflower bread which was phenomenal). This is not the 'stuff your face till you clog your arteries bakery,' it's more the 'let's enjoy food the way it's supposed to be enjoyed' type. This place renewed my hope for Hoboken by producing good quality pastries with some class without the barbaric snobbery of Manhattan (oxymoronic statement I know, but Eli's anyone?).
2011-01-27,2,I agree with several of the comments already written. I waited on line for almost ten minutes and there were three people ahead of me. The items that were there,it seemed pretty empty honestly,were not priced nor did the girls who worked there know the names of the pastries or the price. When I did get the price of a pretzel at 2.75 I thought it was expensive.Another piece of a crumb cake was 5.99.  I did want to see some strudels but did not. Hopefully, they will getThings together and lower their prices a bit. Good luck!
2011-01-25,1,I have to agree with Billy B.  As a Germanophile, I was SUPER excited about the OGB opening so close to my apartment.  However, when I visited the bakery on opening day (and several occasions thereafter), I was terribly disappointed.  Main points of issue:1.  World's slowest moving line.  Although the bakery just opened and it always takes a while to figure out best practices, the length of time it took to place an order was unacceptable.  Several times I looked at the three girls (+ the owner) behind the counter, and couldn't figure out what they were doing or who they were helping.2.  Employees don't know what the items are or how much they cost.  I asked several of the girls behind the counter what some of the items on display were and they had no idea.  One pastry was alternatively described as "Cheese and nut danish" or "Cherry and vanilla danish".  That's a big difference!  This leads me to my third point:3.  The items have no prices or descriptions.  This wouldn't be a huge deal except for the fact that, when I went to pay for a pretzel and what-looked-to-be-a-bearclaw, I paid $7.19!!All in all, I'm super disappointed in this place.  Unless the OGB gets its act together soon, I think'll quickly be saying "Auf Wiedersehen".
