2021-11-05,4,Solid dinner. Haven't been back in years and although it's consistently just ok the food quality is good. We each got a Tequilla (Passion of Jalisco) special cocktail and our server upstairs was very nice. We ordered beet and citrus salad to share and the mussels. Those were just ok- very small and many shells were empty... however the salad was so good! I would get that again! We also each got the skirt steak (cooked MR) and it took a while. It was a little pricey but overall solid. They also take resi on open table which is a huge pro!
2021-10-27,5,I had two events there and both times were amazing. We used the upstairs a few years ago for my baby shower (which was awesome) and then recently used the outdoor patio for my second child's baptism dinner. Due to COVID, I wanted the event outside and the set up of the patio was perfect and private. They had twinkling lights and plants hanging. The heating lamps worked so well. The food was amazing- like spectacular (Thai bbq calamari and steak with feta was delicious but really everything was delicious)!! Service was great. Nancy, the manager, was so sweet, helpful and accommodating!! It was just the perfect event and was easy to book. I couldn't be happier. I hope to have more events there in the future!
2021-10-17,4,Attended Large party, and they catered the staff fairly well. Premium entrees are expected in quality, but food is adequate. I enjoyed their vegan burger.
2021-10-09,4,We sat at the bar and the bartenders were really great. Suzy took care of us at the bar. We ordered drinks and a couple of apps and finger foods. Suzy was very attentive! The drinks arrived so quickly and the food was good too. Very nice, upscale vibe. We enjoyed it.
2021-09-20,2,Came with 6 people, based on a recommendation from a friend. Ordered a beer that I have had many times in the past. It tasted off, as if it was the end of the keg. Two of us Ordered the short rib sandwich. My sandwich looked like it was made with the ends of the bread, and was probably half the size of the other short rib sandwich. Also, one end of the sandwich had no short ribs, unlike the other sandwich which was well made. Also got many fewer fries. Major quality control problem in the kitchen. Half the table loved their entrees, the other half won't be coming back. So many other better choices in Hoboken.
2021-08-13,4,Came here on a saturday around 3/4pm and got seated right away, which was nice. but probably because it was such an awkward time haha i got the truffle buratta rigatoni and my friend got the fettuccine with grilled chicken. At first the dishes were really good and flavorful. I loved how the eggplants were cooked in my dish! and the fettuccine was so creamy and really hit the spot. However both dishes were a bit too heavy after a while. I guess that was kind of to be expected, especially  with the fettuccine. But neither of us were able to finish our dishes unfortunately :( I would consider coming back in the future to try a different dish
2021-08-12,4,Stopped by brass rail on a Tuesday night after work to try their lobster roll and grab a drink. I liked the open air concept of the restaurant when they open up all the street facing doors. It sort of feels like a mix of indoor and outdoor dining. I ordered the margarita which was delicious but small. We were also told that happy hour was at the bar only and I believe only applied to house wines and beers on tap. As for the lobster roll, it was a hot butter style roll with bacon and a few shreds of lettuce (why?). As a self proclaimed lobster roll connoisseur... this roll just didn't cut it. This roll had about 3.5 pieces of lobster on it which tasted good, but was just not enough with all that bread! I also did not care for the 10 pieces of shredded lettuce. I will be back for another margarita!
2021-08-03,3,Ate here Friday night with a group of friends. Outdoor seating was a nice option during these times and for summer.  It smells like a bar, but wasn't too nasty and the bathroom was clean. We had our dinner upstairs. It was freezing, but better than being hot, I supposed. Our waitress was super nice. I went for a pasta with burrata and eggplant. She was kind enough to let me know that they prepared it with chicken stock, which is a no for me. The pasta was good, but I felt like it was missing something. For dessert I had the Nutella creme brûlée. It was pretty tasty, though I didn't have the biscotti since I was avoiding my chipped molar. (oops!)Anyway, probably would pick another place to eat if I was in the area again. But not too bad of an option.
2021-06-06,5,Came here and had the lobster roll.  It was really good.  Service was friendly.  Highly recommended.  Nothing more.
2021-06-04,2,I went to the Brass Rail yesterday during working hours dressed like I was working at a casual office.  I ordered a burger at the bar and no drink. It took forever. The staff was standing around and I wouldn't be surprised if they realized I'd ordered something after I stared at them. After I finally got my burger and my bill, they said that their billing system wasn't taking credit cards and they had to restart it. That took another few minutes.  I know reopening is awkward but I suspect that they can do better.
2021-05-28,5,I've been trying to stop into The Brass Rail twice a week to support them and hopefully see them through the pandemic in my small way. Always order a couple of pasta dinners to go, one for dinner and one to freeze. My family has been coming here since it was originally opened by a French couple in the 80s!Jesse is the best server! He always has a smile on and super nice!
2021-05-26,5,I went to the Brass Rail for the first time, and had a fantastic time. My friend and I ordered the Salmon and the Short Rib sandwich; both were delicious and filling. The cocktails were a little bit on the pricey side; however, I could definitely taste the alcohol, so at least I knew I was getting my money's worth (my personal favorite was the Strawberry Rhubarb mule). The waitress was incredibly sweet, amicable, and gave us great recommendations for the food and drinks! Will definitely come back for dinner again!
2021-05-16,5,The portions are a little small for a couple things, my friend had the oxtails and was still hungry later. The steak and eggs was a good portion. We did the brunch special and the red sangria and mimosa are great.
2021-03-12,5,I have been there twice during covid , there protocols are good and feel comfortable. They keep it very clean . There brunch is so good snd great cocktails!
2021-03-09,5,We had such a good time we came here for brunch and had such a wonderful experience. The staff was amazing and we were seating upstairs quickly. We had awesome drinks and a great server who took the time to give us his real option and I love that. He was awesome and the brunch menus was great we had great options and everyone found something they would enjoy. The food portions were great as well. All the staff was friendly wearing masks and gloves. The tables were all distant and very covid friendly. I honestly ended up spending less than I thought I would. We did make a reservation for 12 which was opening and it was definitely had people coming in. It is a place that we would come back to again. I really enjoyed my whole experience. Thanks again for such a great time we will see you soon.
2021-03-07,3,Food was okay. Music was mediocre, pump it up a bit. Service was slow and most of them seem miserable to be there. Amp it up a bit and im sure it'll be a good spot.
2021-02-20,1,Went here pretty late around 11 pm to get a few drinks. Decided to charge me for drinks we never ordered at our table which included a Fortaleza (no idea) , a Brooklyn lager (we didn't drink beer), a JD. I've worked in a restaurant and I find this shit so insulting when this could've went us unnoticed closing a tab at 1 am. I honestly thought it was a great place til I felt like they tried to pull a fast one on me. Won't come back now for pure principle. Apologies to the owners who probably don't know why they're losing customers but they need a better manager. Didn't eat this time but the food was good other times just shitty people work here I guess trying to scam you
2021-02-18,5,Nice brunch spot for friends and family. Good atmosphere upstairs and the food was delicious. Brunch special is on point too. $26 for a drink, appetizer and brunch entree.
2021-02-15,5,We were there for Valentine's dinner on Saturday, February 13, 2021 and we had an amazing meal! Every platter brought out had a bouquet of flavors making our taste buds dancing! The charcuterie board is so tastefully paired, octopus is delish. Strongly recommend pulled ribs with grits!!!They strongly follow Covid restrictions, and we were very happy...
2021-02-09,5,Jessie was so sweet and inviting when we visited last night for a celebratory dinner with my boyfriend. The drinks were impeccable and the food was hearty. We will definitely be back to see Jessie as we will soon be living in the neighborhood! Thank you Jessie for helping making our evening memorable :)
2021-02-06,5,Brunch here is the best in Hoboken. Love the prix fix and drinks are very good and only $5. Went last weekend and there was no wait, fantastic service, reasonable prices and delicious food.
2021-02-06,5,Really friendly staff. Food was really good. I've gone a few times and I'll definitely come back in the future when I was a pub atmosphere and some savory American food.
2021-01-23,5,Great dinner. Started with the calamari, hummus and meatballs. Meatballs were the star. Very good. Lobster roll was good, salmon was also good and the brussel sprouts were super flavorful. Overall really great choice for dinner. Sat upstairs and nice ambiance.
2021-01-09,5,It was my first time in Hoboken , and I was not disappointed . Came to the Brass Rail with a few of my girl friends and was not disappointed  . Jesse was an amazing waiter and made us feel right at home . 10/10
2021-01-09,5,Always great to come here, staff and service is superb. Food is even better! Great place for a nice night out with friends or a spicy date you're trying to impress.
2021-01-07,3,So with COVID and outdoor dining still being a thing, I don't entirely blame the restaurant for our experience but I do believe they could've done a better job. I went with some friends to celebrate an important date for us. It was pretty cold this day but I had read in other reviews that they have heat lamps. We got seated and asked for the heat lamps to be turned on. The heat lamps were turned on and within 5 minutes turned off. We kept asking for it to be turned on again but I guess it didn't work. Anyways despite the cold, our waitress was super nice & the food was pretty good but we could barely enjoy it since it was freezing. Not sure if I'd go back any time soon, maybe in warmer weather
2020-12-16,5,WARNING: Long post ahead So imagine trying to get married in the midst of a pandemic and not being able to find a reasonably priced, stellar service type of place--welcome to my reality! It was November 2020 and my fiancé and I wanted to have our small wedding ceremony at a bar/restaurant but after searching for a few weeks in NYC-we stumbled upon the great reviews that the Brass Rail had, so we decided to go there for Brunch one weekend in October. The food and service were on POINT. (And I'm from the industry and ridiculously picky btw )After brunch, we had our initial meeting with Nancy who showed us the second floor and we discussed food options and protocols during these crazy times. She was the EASIEST person to talk to and I mean this in the best way possible lol I felt like I was becoming your typical BRIDEZILLA because I was doing everything on my own from decorating to planning. Nancy recommended a cake lady and even allowed me to decorate a small space the day before! She ensured me that everything would go as I planned and I felt confident since day zero! We had our wedding there on a Saturday evening and her staff was able to decorate the place for me as I wanted; the food, drinks and service were OUTSTANDING! I couldn't have been happier to have my wedding there and would 100% recommend this place!
2020-11-17,4,Made a reservation and went for a Saturday brunch and were seated immediately. Not bottomless but one drink included with a starter and main course. I had the mesclun, omelette and red sangria. Additional drinks pretty cheap. Overall the food was okay and the drinks were good.
2020-11-15,5,Went here for outdoor brunch and really enjoyed it! They have a great brunch special where you get a drink, an appetizer and a main for $25. I chose the champagne punch, French onion soup, and oxtail potato hash and would recommend all of it! The service was good, and we were able to pay through Venmo.
2020-11-14,5,These place is a 5 star all across the board . Been going there for 7 years now with my boyfriend and also brought many friends there . As a matter of fact will have brunch with some friends tomorrow . We have tried about 80% of the menu and they change the menu  through the seasons and the food is simply fantastic , the have the best chef in Hoboken for sure . The bartenders here are always so friendly and the staff in general is just such a joy . This place is great for breakfast , lunch , dinner and cocktails.. they have it all and the thing I love the most is the atmosphere, always such a pleasure being there . .
2020-11-14,3,4 star food5 star waitress1 star hostess/managementWe were so excited to try their brunch $25/person meal, but hadn't made reservations. We called ahead and they said we could sit at the bar since their reservations were booked for outside. We were okay with it so we got there maybe 15 min later. The bar had filled up and they sat us outside-I asked about a table in the sun but they said a reservation was coming for that table soon. The hostesses seated us in the shade, with no heater (where all other tables had a heater) and a palm tree smacking my husband in the face. We placed our drink order with the waitress and she offered to move us to the table in the sun, we jumped at the chance & moved. She came out two minutes later to kindly ask us to move back since the hostess had told her we couldn't sit there. Whatever, she tried and we appreciated the attempt! Food came, it was good (steak tacos, oxtail hash and the omelette), I mainly used my plate to heat my hands up since we were freezing. Meanwhile the tables in the sun sat empty for the 40 minutes that we sat shivering & unable to enjoy our meal. Since I hadn't ordered a "first course" for their brunch special they billed mine as a meal & a drink, at $24 instead of $25... with all the trouble we went through and unpleasantness something should have been complimentary. I was so excited to try a new place for brunch but this reaffirmed that our favorite spots in the area are the best. In food yes, but just as importantly in service. Latham House, Hamilton Inn, Hudson Hound, Halifax)
2020-10-30,5,Brass Rail is honestly my favorite brunch deal in Hoboken! Cocktail, app, and entre for $25 is great! They have the basic brunch cocktails - mimosa, beer, or sangria - all are tasty. Their food is on another level. Those potatoes .. yum. I've never had a bad time here. You can also make reservations via Opentable which makes coming here during the pandemic so much easier. They're socially distant seating makes you feel at ease while enjoying time outside.
2020-10-25,2,Brunch experience was not great. French onion soup was just ok but lacking flavor. Breakfast gyro was pretty good. The cocktails were all terrible. Very weak and poorly made. Watered down from too much ice. Service was also very slow which you would think wouldn't be the case with reduced capacity. Won't be going back for brunch again. Dinner is a better option.
2020-10-14,5,We held a welcome dinner for family and friends on the 2nd floor for our sons wedding weekend.  It was the perfect location for us to gather with ample space for social distancing but still have an intimate space for our gathering. We had the entire 2nd floor, with bar and tables.  Food was excellent.   Service was prompt and attentive.  Our evening at the Brass rail helped to set the right tone for the weekend!  Lots of kudos from attendees.  Thanks Nancy and your entire staff for helping to make this a memorable evening!
2020-10-04,5,The usual male bartender is very personable and makes the bar fun. This place is a gem. The downtown adult/mature bar. The bar tender stays on his game. Makes sure you're glass isn't empty for long. He offers food and friendly convo.Always a great time for the game too!!
2020-10-04,5,The food was great, but the service was BETTER! Our waiter Jesse was attentive, funny, fun, professional and on point! For the restaurant being pretty busy, he always was servicing us- we never had to wonder when our next drink was coming out. I was impressed with all the COVID guidelines and how well all the staff seemed to work together. Me and my 4 girlfriends had an enjoyable night out! Thank you Jesse!
2020-09-29,3,3.5-starsI have been to The Brass Rail many times, as relevant from my previous 2 reviews, but my recent visit fell a bit flat.  I started with an Aperol Spritz, which was actually very well-balanced in terms of the ratio from Aperol to prosecco to seltzer.  For my main dish, I selected the Seared Salmon, which I requested to be cooked medium.  However, it was definitely prepared medium-rare, which I know was the chef's recommendation, though not my preference.  Also, the fish was served with a medley of "crispy" brussels sprouts, butternut squash, and pistachios, which were charred almost beyond recognition in a honey cider.  The brussels were particularly blackened, and when I alerted the server, the kitchen sent out a new miniature skillet of brussels sprouts that were lightly grilled and much better tasting.  There was a spiced pumpkin yogurt on the salmon plate as well, which tempered the sweetness of the honey cider, but could have used a bit more spice.The Brass Rail will continue to be one of my favorite American cuisine places in Hoboken, though I prefer to go there for their brunch special.
2020-09-28,5,Vegan pad Thai was great! They seem to have one vegan option that they change seasonally.
2020-09-20,5,We made reservations, recommended as it does fill up.  We sat upstairs which was nice.  Service was very good, our waitress was very pleasant.  Drink selection was nice - appetizers were delicious and came out relatively fast.  I can speak to the burgers...they were great. Highly recommended.  No dessert only because we were full from the meals.  Great place to take the family....
2020-09-01,4,I was looking for a nice restaurant on a Sunday evening with outdoor seating and stumbled across this restaurant. They had a cute set up around the corner of their restaurant with lights that light up after the sun sets.You have to go inside their restaurant with your mask to request table but it's no problem and we were seated immediately. They also have bathrooms inside but you must wear your mask! But you can take it off once you are seated at your table.Menus are available on your phone after you scan the QR code and the waitress/waiter will take your order in person. | ORDERS |Miso Mustard Glazed Baby Back - this was an appetizer which is amazing. 10/10 would order again.Brie & Truffle Honey Risotto - got the large size; flavorful and nice creamy texture, great choice.Grilled Brass Rail Burger - great burger but the buns were a little thick so it was eaten with half the bun haha and was good.Nutella Creme Brulee - I absolutely love Nutella so I naturally loved this. A good way to end my meal and was a decent size as well.Overall, really enjoyed my experience and would definitely make another visit.
2020-08-30,3,I pains me to only give them 3 stars but the service was very lacking. We asked for an extra plate, the server never came back.  The turnaround time for drinks and food was extremely slow and the server charged all the wrong prices so make sure you review your receipt.  Now as for the food...DELICIOUS!!!! I can't say anything bad about the food.  My daughter and I had brunch which comes with 1 drink, a started and an entrée for $25. Definitely worth it. I mean everything we had was sooooo good. We cleaned our plates. I would definitely come back to try the dinner menu. I would recommend if you're looking for Great food and drinks but don't expect great service.
2020-08-14,1,I ordered through seamless for my boyfriend and I. We ordered the grilled BR burger medium well (it comes with fries, which I asked in special instructions for them to be burned and extra crispy crunchy), a small truffle meatballs and gnocchi, and the chicken fingers.No complimentary bread/cornbread/muffins what have you, do not come with delivery ordered btw. I wasn't sure. Now I know.Where to begin...delivery arrived early but it was not a good thing. The burger was thin and cooked rare (see photos), presentation for burger poor but who cares if it tastes great? This one does not. There was a small thin slice of pancetta but we couldn't taste it, unfortunately. I even looked at my boyfriend and asked "is there pancetta even in there? He had to look! Bun was a bit firm and tasted like plastic bag. Wouldn't order it again. And at $16 we were expecting WAY better quality. Awful.The three chicken fingers came with fries too (it didn't state that on seamless, though special instructions aren't followed anyway!). Not good quality chicken. Can't believe they charge $13 for this??? It's better and cheaper at Grubbs!!! And Wendy's lol. Never again. I see why no one really has posted pics of it or mentions it.The best tasting was the truffle meatballs and gnocchi. The cream sauce was good. However, you only get three TINY meatballs, and SIX gnocchi for $15????? And a few mushrooms. Uh hell no. EXTREMELY OVERPRICED for the size.Idk what everyone else was talking about regarding portion size being large but for the cost, ours was very small and not worth it. We will not be reordering from here. How disappointing!!Bonus: seamless contacted the manager asking for a refund for the small portions, rare burger, and High prices. Manager said no. SOOOOO good to know they only want your money and could care less about quality and size of what is delivered for their customers.One of the most disappointing experiences. Seamless made it worth one star. Otherwise, I'd have given negative!
2020-08-06,5,Birthday dinner for my sister..Split a lobster roll app, two drinks, two entrees (hanger steak and short ribs) and complimentary dessert - under 100 before tip. How?! Service was a excellent, we were checked upon at the right times - never bothered.
2020-07-25,5,First of all this place is in a great location. The pre-fix brunch deal is an absolute steal- the food is good and the portions are great! Not to mention there's a lot of options to choose from. The service was wonderful. We made a reservation on open table which was probably a good call cause it was pretty busy. Definitely recommend!
2020-07-18,3,the chairs for outside are literally the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat in in my life, same for the rest of my party. clearly they are supposed to have cushions
2020-07-11,5,One of the best bar/restaurant combos in Hoboken, both pre and during COVID. The brunch is one of the best in Hoboken; you get both an appetizer and an entré and they're always delicious. They also give you delicious mini muffins with your meal. Just tried their outdoor dining and they have a great setup of tables that are actually 6' apart in both the shade and sun. Truffle meatballs and gnocchi were fantastic and perfectly portioned. Bartenders are friendly and service is great.
2020-06-23,5,had a great first outdoor dining experience mid pandemic here. the limited menu still had a lot of great variety and the servers were very attentive. they had an assortment of tables in front and on the sidewalk, some in the sun and some in the shade. i will be back soon!
2020-06-21,5,Staff was excellent! Owners are super friendly! I had the hanger steak and it was hands down the best I've ever had! My wife had the burger and it was cooked to perfection. Try a frosé! Soo perfect for a summer evening!
2020-06-18,5,Thursday is the new Friday ! Start the weekend early, go out for a drink and  have some food that is not served in takeout container!!! Wow- I forgot how fried food is crispy and not soggy from arriving with lid of container keeping moisture in and crispy out :( Social distant seating was well done on the sidewalk of a Washington Ave. Post quarantine reorganization, no dinning inside, no entry for restroom or hostess station without mask, once seated you can take mask off. No handheld menus, a QR code was used for all menus. We ordered through a server, and received excellent service of meals and drinks. Delish cocktail menu and full bar with beer and wine. Surreal dinning outside watching masked people gather and get back to normalcy or the new regime of socially distant public gatherings.
2020-05-23,4,The food here is definitely good but a bit pricier than I would like for what you get. They do have great drink deals on different nights of the week, which I love!
2020-04-17,4,Brass Rail was clutch for our Easter dinner order -  a Full 3 course meal for 2 people for $45 - what?!?  On top of that the delivery came early as well which is appreciated.  The food (Caesar salad, calamari, salmon, lamb, and run raisin a la mode) was delicious and they kindly were able to add some wings from their partnered restaurant, Stewed Cow.    To top it off, I was able to add some grocery staples to the delivery order as well which for sure beats waiting in a grocery line to find out that the item you are looking for is sold out/currently out of stock. On top of this all, they have also partnered with the Hoboken Shelter to donate some meals. Thanks Brass Rail for staying open and making sure the Hoboken community is fed!
2020-03-05,5,My friend Mary recommended this place and I'm glad she did. When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly hostess. We decided to wait for seats at the large well stocked bar. Communal and dining tables are also in this area. If you have a large group or party you  can dine upstairs.  The staff was so nice and the food was great. We've been here twice in one week for dinner. I was informed that they were known for their seafood dishes. I decided to order the lobster roll. The bartender asked half or whole. Excuse me:) I was hungry, so I went with the whole. My sandwich had a whole lobster poached in butter, pancetta, on a toasted roll with a side of fries. This sandwich was so big it took me two days to finish. My second visit, was the chicken sandwich fresh mozzarella and basil mayo were the game changer. We stayed for hours.
2020-03-05,4,Had the truffle gnocchi meatballs and they were unbelievable. The pancetta gave it a twist on a classic gnocchi dish, they also offer it in a half and full portion which is a nice option. It was perfect for one person to order and share with the groups, the servers were very nice, a bit slow, but friendly. Would come back here, a hidden gem in Hoboken.
2020-03-01,3,I really wanted to like this place. Drinks are always amazing and they make a perfect espresso martini but the brunch left much to be desired.  The muffin basket to start off is a nice touch, but the appetizer I had was actually.. bad. Went with the mini "fluffy" Japanese pancakes. They weren't fluffy and were very bland for apparently being served with maple syrup. Presentation was on point though, came in a Chinese take away box with chopsticks. For a main I got the ham and gruyere sando on French toast. The French toast wasn't cooked through and there but otherwise it was alright. Maybe they just had an off day but I wasn't really impressed. You do get a lot of food though.
2020-03-01,1,Ok I definitely think Brass Rail is better for dinner than brunch. I've been to brunch here now twice. The first time it was a disappointment but I didn't exactly complain. We were left scrambling for a place to go this morning and future husband suggested Brass Rail. I knew it wasn't going to impress me but I let future husband get his way and we took the crew to a high top table near the bar.Firstly, I will say that our servER was great. She was attentive and knew the menu well. She seemed to be a seasoned waitress. But the servICE was terrible. After we were given mini choc chip muffins with strawberry preserves (Meagan noted that this was quite the odd combination) we placed our order. Maybe we should've peaced out instead considering that these little muffins were so dry and they were WEIRDLY shaped. Like someone was squeezing out the muffin mix sloppily in the kitchen in the back. I'm assuming there was some semblance of a chocolate chip in these mini muffs but maybe the chips were from 2006 because I got no hint of chocolate from the taste. Hershey's is crying.  What type of brunch bread service is that?Some of us ordered off the pre-fixe brunch menu and apps were not brought out at the same time whatsoever. Meagan got her french onion soup first. She said it was good but Nicky said it was watery. Yikes.Finally other apps were delivered and we could continue on with our dining experience. I did get a good tequila drink and Pat tasted it and got one too. But Meagan commented how OJ heavy the mimosas were and she was definitely right. We were itching for the hair of the dog here people, give us what we are paying for! I did like my tequila drink though because I'm always mesmerized over a cocktail with one big cube. It's extraordinary to me and feels fancy even in a shitty restaurant.Once the dishes arrived we were very much dismayed to find that certain ingredients were missing. Where was the manchego cheese I was promised in my quinoa bowl? What type of concoction was this anyway? It just didn't "go," and was ice cold which felt weird underneath two poached eggs. I ordered them poached because the thought of a hard boiled egg on a quinoa bed (as it's offered on the menu) just can't be right. I feel like Chef didn't mean for that and if Chef did, is Chef alright in the head?Sasha's potatoes were undercooked which is even worse because she had requested them crispy. She sent them back and once someone goes so far as to send something back in a restaurant I automatically deduct a FULL star.The very worst about all of this? Pat's sandwich bun was rock hard. Like, harder than a rock. I can't even make this a simile and say "as hard as a rock," because this bun truly rejiggered the very meaning of the word rock in my book. I have no idea how he bit into that thing but goodness knows that man's teeth must be loose.Future husband finished his meal and then apologized for suggesting the restaurant but we were all glad to see his breakfast tasted just fine. Unfortunately, I won't be back here for brunch and Pat will be sending his dentist bill to Chef.
2020-02-14,5,Cheese and honey  we ordered the mix 3 lunch and everything was amazing! Housemade ricotta with honey...yes. Also the truffle honey and Brie grilled cheese sandwich was yummy!
2020-01-09,3,3.5 out of 5. Pretty good business lunch with my work team. We had a party of 8 and were easily able to make a reservation on Open Table one hour prior. The lunch items range from $10-$20 and include salads, sandwiches, burgers, as well as salmon and chicken plates. They also offer a trio option for $15, where you can pick any three items and you will have a small portion of each. My team ordered the BLT, the BR Burger, one trio, salmon, rigatoni pasta, and chicken. I had the BR Burger which was a good size and came with a pickly, onions, mozzarella, pancetta, lettuce and tomato as well as a hefty portion of fries on the side. The burger was well cooked, and together with the fries tasted really good. Overall my team was fairly happy with their meal, with the exception of the pasta rigationi (which looked soupy and tasted awful), and the BLT sandwich (which tasted really blend). Overall decent option for a lunch near work in Hoboken.
2020-01-01,2,Never had a lobster roll I didn't like.. until today. Do NOT order the lobster roll here.. it is advertised on menu as "BR Lobster Roll : pancetta & fries". It came out as one giant slab of lobster which you could not break apart. It was smothered in mushy celery, a million  fried onions, and circular slabs of bacon. No lemon, no taste, no pancetta. Totally disappointing.
2019-12-28,2,Bad service. Food is overage at higher price point. Not worth it... we had chicken lollipops, were ok. Thai calamari are not Thai, just greasy calamari with mayo souse. Gnocchi over salted. Food gave me bad heartburn... wouldn't recommend
2019-12-22,3,I like brass rail but I am not a fan of the food. It's always mediocre and service outside of the bar area is hit or miss. To paint a picture, I paid $18 for a lobster roll that had no more than a claw worth of meat. There were also peppers and onions on it and an insane amount of butter. Really just not good at all. Most of my meals there have been like that. Would suggest it for a drink or two! Bartenders are nice.
2019-11-25,5,Came here for my daughters birthday.  She lives nearby in Hoboken.  The food was delicious.  The upstairs room was very cool with that old school feeling.  Will definitely be back
2019-11-11,4,I've been here a few times, but usually only for drinks outside or at the bar downstairs. But for the first time this past weekend, we stopped here for brunch, so happy we did! Our party of 8 had a big comfortable table upstairs in their really beautiful dining room. They have a fantastic brunch special - an appetizer, an entree and a drink for $26. Any additional brunch cocktail you get after your initial one is only an extra $2-$3, compared to the usual ~$8. I got the Kale and Pumpkin Salad, the Eggs Benedict and a Bloody Mary. I left very full. Okay, first the Bloody Mary - actually one of my favorites I've had in awhile, and I loveeee bloody Marys. It was premixed, so when someone from our table asked to make their with a bit less tabasco, they couldn't. The pumpkin and kale salad was tasty (but they didn't have kale so replaced it with arugula). Zero complaints, it was a delicious salad with pumpkin seeds, coconut shavings and a tasty vinaigrette. The eggs benedict wasn't my favorite. It came on mini bagels instead of English Muffins, and I didn't think that it complimented it very well. The bread was a bit hard and chewy. It came with home fries and a little salad on the side. It was still a tasty dish, but not something I'd get again. I'd definitely recommend stopping in for their brunch special! For everything that you are getting, you can't beat it.
2019-11-09,2,Extremely mediocre food. Good vibe and music though. We ordered Pizza, a flatbread, wings and their sweet potato fries are potato wedges. Everything was ok, just Ok.
2019-11-08,3,I came here for a girls night out. It seemed really hip and trendy. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the vibe. I sat at the bar and got a cocktail that had "mezcal" that was supposed to be Smokey; unfortunately it was not and tasted like vodka. It wasn't a problem the bartender changed my drink with absolutely no issue and it was fine. We also ordered Guac which was really good and although we were finished; someone came and took it. Didn't ask any questions; just took it off the table without asking if we were done. The guac was good, my gf wanted to lick the plate. Lol. Please train your staff to ask if the person is done before taking the plates that THEY PAY FOR.
2019-10-30,3,Good for brunch in Hoboken. They have a Prix fixe menu for $25 that includes an app, entree and a mimosa and then $2 for additional mimosas. I went with the Eggs Benedict, it was a good portion and came with a salad and potatoes. I went on a Sunday and the football games were on. It's a more low key place compared to other bars on Washington St. in Hoboken. It was not too crowded.
2019-10-29,3,A solid brunch spot in Hoboken with a killer deal! Free muffins, appetizer, entree, & one drink all for under $25. If you want to keep piling on the drinks,  they'll only cost you an extra $3 and next thing you know it's turning into a boozy brunch. Be warned, somehow ordering just an entree off the same menu will cost you more, so you may as well order that appetizer! The staff at brass rail was really helpful, but somehow only one of our menu changes was actually executed while the other was forgotten. Accidents happen, so not a big deal, but we were appreciative of the effort to accommodate our requests!With a top and bottom floor, this place is more spacious than you'd imagine. There was plenty of room for our neighboring table's 30th birthday party and the place wasn't too loud with all the hubbub around.
2019-10-22,5,I picked this awesome restaurant to host my oldest daughter's 30th birthday brunch.  I have to say that it was the easiest thing to plan from meeting with the assistant manager Nancy Guajardo to emailing and speaking on the phone with the manager Jesse McCraig.  My husband and I had the best customer service you can get.  They wre very flexible and accommodating in whatever we needed.  The restaurant caters to people with all types of food allergies.  The brunch menus has a lot to offer and the food was awesome.  The best item was the stuffed french ham guyere french toast.  The brunch cocktails were delicious.  I highly recommend this place to host an event.  The spacious upstairs room was recently renovated and it is beautiful.  The printed menus looked so elegant and how the tables were arranged and setup.  It was beautiful.
2019-10-15,4,This place has a great happy hour and outdoor seating. I got the crab dip and it was good! I've come here at night once too and it was really fun! Really good music and everybody was dancing. A great spot in downtown Hoboken
2019-10-14,5,Decided to try this place out on a Saturday night and absolutely loved. The bartenders were amazing. We and my old roommate sat at the bar and the bartender got our order wrong like 5 times and ended up charging only for the drinks he got right. The place typically gets crowded but not as crazy as other bars in Hoboken.
2019-10-09,5,I chose this restaurant for my husband and his brother's surprise birthday party. Since there were over 18 adults, we were seated upstairs where the music wasn't loud. The manager Jesse was extremely cooperative. He was very responsive both over phone and e-mail. He provided vegetarian options in the prix fixe menu and allowed two service dogs who had come with the guests. The food was excellent. The pistachio crusted goat cheese salad, salmon, and the chocolate mousse were the most outstanding dishes. Everyone had a good time. The server was a bit slow and stand-offish but the high-quality food and service provided by the manager compensated for it. Highly recommend it for large parties.
2019-10-06,4,Cute vibe and good drink specials. We came on a night when they had half price wine. The food was mediocre, but fine if you just need a bite while grabbing a drink. Would come again for drinks!
2019-10-01,3,Only been here once, will update as I eat more. Came here after work and we ordered some drinks. Our waitress was really friendly and I ordered a custom drink which she was nice about. We also ordered some food!Buffalo lollipops: I enjoyed these! Thick piece of chicken, with the right amount of sauce. Crispy on the outside. Boom. Calamari: was not a fan of but my colleagues loved them. I needed more sauce or lemon juice. Came with banana peppers and bbq sauce.Oysters or mussels (whichever is the apps) : I did not try this but my colleagues did not end up finishing this. The shells were not with the dish and already scooped out.
2019-09-08,2,Very disappointed in both my app and meal. Fruit salad looks like it was thrown together., not even served in a bowl. Eggs Benedict is usually a safe choice- here the sauce was thick and flavorless and bread mushy. Only thing I enjoyed was the red sangria and breakfast potatoes. Would not recommend.
2019-09-01,4,I have been here four times, however, I've only ever sat at the bar. I've been here three times for brunch and one time for drinks and appetizers.Their menu is seasonal. Their drinks and service has always been good.Their brunch menu is prix fixe which is $25 and it comes with two courses, an appetizer and an entree. It comes with a brunch cocktail: Mimosa, Bloody Mary, or Red sangria.The portions are good. For starters I had the Very Berry Crepes. There were two crepes filled with a cream and they drizzled honey along with berries. They were delicious and light. My boyfriend had the Pork Belly and Egg taco that came with a soft tortilla. I didn't try his because he ate all of it and didn't save me any crumps except I was able to taste the pork belly juice and it was yummy.For an entree, I had the Steak and eggs. That was my second time having that and it doesn't disappoint. I ordered it medium rare and they didn't overcook it. It comes with a bed of greens along with bread and fried eggs. My boyfriend had the burger and he was satisfied. The fries are just the way I enjoy them, which is crispy.As far as for the drinks, we had all three and they were good. We will keep coming back to this local restaurant.
2019-08-30,4,One of my go to placesFood is great - ambiance is fun - drinks are great On Halloween they gave out candy to kids too - very fun to sit and watch while I had my dinner
2019-08-13,4,One of the many tasty bars & restaurants in downtown Hoboken. Really great place to come on a nice day so you can sit outside. We were promptly seated for a late dinner and the waiter was very accommodating and fixed our shaky table for us. The Octopus salad was sooooo delicious, I just wish there was more of it! From what I could tell the entrees were also on the small side. Looking forward to my next visit!
2019-08-03,4,A long time favorite lounge bar on the Main Street downtown in Hoboken which is convenient to meet friends and families during the week or weekend, it's right near parking garages when parking is difficult to find, I love their lobster roll which is wrapped in bacon and it's quite filling. It comes with fries and it's filling for one person.A great appetizer or entree is their gnocchi which isn't offered that much in restaurants in town but this is definitely my favorite place to order, it's very creamy & the truffle meatballs with the mushroom  makes a great starter to share with someone. The lollipop wings  $10 which are amazing which are another great appetizer. Their is an upstairs and you can have private parties as well, most stay downstairs or like to sit outside and people watch during the summer. They accept cash and credit. Check it out
2019-07-30,5,One of my favorite brunch places - it was really hot when I went - they just had fans on and I'm not sure if there's AC - but the brunch special is reasonable and the drinks are fun!
2019-07-28,5,What a great street/outdoor cafe!!  Servers and managers were fantastic, matched only by their fabulous food.  The home fries and french fries were fantastic.  The inside was cozy and friendly and the outdoor seating was really nice too.  When you are in Hoboken stop in here, you will not be disappointed, I HIGHLY recommend this venue.
2019-07-27,4,This place is really pretty great, and near and dear to my heart since I am part of an organization that regularly meets here, and I had my bridal shower here last year.  The food is always consistently good.  Solid portion sizes, a fair amount of options for each category (above and beyond typical "bar food", they have some eclectic spins on Thai, Asian, and new America an).They have a VERY long list of beer (short list for draft/tap beers, but good news is they carry local brands (like Hoboken brewery), and their bottle list is long, and quite good.Service has always been on point, and it's not divey like some bar/restaurants, especially not on the second floor-that's where they usually have private events.  Bonus:  they have lots of outdoor seating and their restaurant week menu is always on point
2019-07-25,3,I went to The Brass Rail for lunch and ordered three small dishes as part of the BR Trio (3 small dishes for $15): Truffle Honey and Brie Grilled Cheese, Korean BBQ Short Rib Slider, and Grilled Octopus. These portion sizes were puny- like 2 bites per item. The grilled cheese was average. The bun on the slider was too crunchy and the meat was a bit dry. The octopus was too salty.The service speed was a bit slow. That being said, our waitress was nice. The place is nicely decorated in an American bar/restaurant style.Overall, I was not that impressed by the food at The Brass Rail. It was passable, but I will probably try a different place in Hoboken next time.
2019-07-01,4,Really legit, nice dinner in Hoboken. Decent happy hour specials and really good food. Was very simple to make modifications to the menu and wine and beer selection was vast. Food service was fast but drinks a little slow. Would return on another trip.
2019-06-29,5,We went their for cocktails and they were really good. We had the punch and smoky. Food was awesome especially shishito peppers and ricota. Service was prompt and ambience good. 5 stars. Go here for quick bites and cocktails.
2019-06-23,4,My friend and I ate dinner here last night. I had the rigatoni pasta with eggplant and mozzarella. Delicious! I also ordered the Southern Peach cocktail, and my head was spinning halfway through - great drink. My only complaint is that our server was not very attentive. He needs to make sure to clear away empty plates and glasses while serving his guests.
2019-06-20,4,This is a Hoboken mainstay, and my boyfriend and I came over for an impromptu after-work dinner with drinks. The place was packed, especially outside, so we ended up eating indoors. For drinks, we kept it simple: beer for him, G&T for me. Then it was time for food. We split a cheese board with three cheeses -- one Italian, one French, and one British, which came with brioche, apples, raspberry jam and walnut spread. The Italian cheese (my boyfriend's favorite) was sharp and nutty, like parmesan, while the British and French cheese were soft, spreadable, and creamy. All of the accompanying breads and fruit paired together well with each cheese, in any permutation. As for food, my boyfriend ordered their truffle gnocchi with meatballs, while I went with the mini sliders with fries. Service was solid, if a little busy. My boyfriend loved his dish: creamy, flavorful, and a lot of texture. This is actually his favorite dish. I enjoyed my sliders and fries. The miniatrue brioche bun enveloped some juicy, yummy slider patties. The only garnish on these sliders was cheddar and caramelized onions which, in my opinion, is really all you need for a great burger. Persoally, I ended up removing the buns (trying to cut back on bready carbs), but of course, still had my fries! Fries were perfectly cooked and crispy, all you could ask for.Another ace in the hole for Hoboken!
2019-06-09,1,Went with a group of friends for the pre-fixed brunch and the mimosas were 99% orange juice 1% champagne. When I told the server she said they make it a certain way since it's a pre-fix aka they make it with no champagne....the food was mediocre at best. I do not recommend going here for brunch.
2019-06-03,3,The drinks were great! The burrata cheese pizza which was good but still somewhat cold . Meaning that it was frozen and was not heated up properly. Salad was good but could have been a bit more. Mac n lobster was pretty average. Service was great stars s are for the drinks and service.
2019-05-23,4,So the Brass Rail has a been a favorite of mine. I recently went for brunch and they have a decent brunch deal. I had the burger which was ok and had the sangria which was pretty good. The deal includes an appetizer, entree, and drink. I like the comradery of the place. The bar is usually my go to spot for drinks and food. I'm usually there for dinner and I think the food is much better at dinner than at brunch. They have a good wine list and a decent cocktail list. It's really a neighborhood favorite. Staff has always been friendly.
2019-05-19,4,I've been coming here for years. Usually for brunch. Often for dinner. The staff is friendly and stable (very little turnover)Food is decent and atmosphere is noisy but laid back. You can get bar food but also notch up to bougie entrees.
2019-05-06,4,We came here from Brunch on Saturday morning. We had a baby stroller with us and they were very accommodating and seated us at a table where we could place our baby right beside us. They have a fixed price $25 menu for brunch where you get to choose one appetizer, one entree, and a cocktail or mocktail.There was a good selection of choices. We ordered the Very Berry Crepes and Pork Belly/Fried Egg taco as apps. Both dishes were very good especially the taco which was fantastic. We got the Popeye Sandwich and Steak and Eggs for our entrees. The portions were generous and the fries were delicious. The steak and eggs were cooked to perfection.I highly recommend this place for brunch. I will be back for dinner.
2019-04-20,5,It was such a nice weather so me and my hubby decided to sit outside after our doc's appointment. Unfortunately, it was past lunch time and too early for dinner time. So we had to order it from the bar menu. Surprisingly, our choice of foods were all great! Especially burrata pizza and pasta were delicious. Will try this place again for brunch.
2019-03-26,5,Great Date spot on the corner of 2nd and Washington in Downtown Hoboken. I wouldn't recommend this place for a group larger than 4. Even that many people may have trouble finding a comfortable spot at the bar during prime time. This place has always been packed whenever I'm there (usually nights and weekends) The interior isn't quite "rustic" or "pubby" But it does have a wooden bar down the length of the first floor and a warm relaxed vibe. Although I've hear it's Haunted!? Bartenders will make some very creative craft drinks and brunch menu also has some interesting options. I've shared the picture of my cauliflower "grits" and steak and eggs. Also, I've shared a picture of the Brussels sprout salad and poached eggs. I recommend this place always.
2019-02-17,5,It's something in the air cuz I'm giving out 5 stars like candy!! Me and a party of 16 really enjoyed a close friends birthday brunch. I was very impressed with how quick we were seated. The food took a while to come out but nothing special expected for a party of 16. The bathrooms are small but clean if I had to complain I would say that the portions are small and there are not a lot of Vegan options
2019-02-11,2,Came here as part of Restaurant Week and left very disappointed. The appetizer (guacomole with tuna tartare) had the consistency of baby food, the hanger steak was not terrible but very small, and the creme brulee was burnt. To be honest, no one in our group of ten enjoyed their meals and it was not surprising to see the restaurant almost empty. Service was good though, but would probably only come back for drinks. Should have known better than to expect a great restaurant in the heart of Washington street...
2019-02-11,4,**2019 WINTER HUDSON RESTAURANT WEEK REVIEW**I was pleasantly surprised by my dining experience at Brass Rail. My expectations were not too high since the restaurant just had okay reviews. But I was convinced to try this place out when I saw the RW menu. So I made a reservation via Open Table and headed over there one Friday night.For $29, you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. For my app, I went with the Truffle Meatballs and Gnocci. The meatballs were a tad dry but the flavor was great, and so was the creamy sauce it was served in. My BF went with the tuna tartare, which I thought was just okay. Both were pretty big portions though, for appetizers. For the entree, we both ordered the Garlic-Rubbed Skirt steak. This was cooked perfectly at the medium rare I asked for. The little bit of blue cheese crumbles and the crispy shoestring potatoes were a very nice touch. For dessert, I chose the mango sorbet. I was expecting one scoop but it came out with three! I couldn't finish it all but it was a nice and refreshing end to a pretty heavy meal. BF wanted the oreo cheesecake, which they ran out of - so he had the Nutella creme brulee. He ended up being glad that they ran out of the cheesecake because he really enjoyed the creme brulee. I did too - even though I'm not a fan of nutella.Overall, a great experience. However, it's pretty loud so it's probably not the best place to go to if you're trying to catch up with someone. Still, I definitely don't mind coming back to try their regular, non-RW menu.
2019-02-09,3,My friends and I decided to try this place for Hudson County Restaurant Week. We were expecting that since it's an opportunity for the restaurant to attract new diners, they would put their best foot forward. We were wrong, let's start with the good, the drinks are fairly priced for Hoboken, very nice atmosphere, and good service from the staff. The food was bland, there wasn't even an "ehhh" I might try this again factor. The tuna tartar was more life baby food, it was too much of a puree. The Monk fish tasted like it was steamed, sprinkled with salt and then quickly fried. My friends experience was about the same, just ehhh, we might come back for drinks.
2019-01-26,5,I love coming here for brunch. They have good brunch cocktails and entrees. I've also been here for events as well. All around a good neighborhood bar and restaurant.
2018-12-30,1,The lobster roll was terrible, I don't know what the other reviews were talking about. The worst one I've ever had. It was so chewy and did not taste good. Waste of 18 dollars
2018-12-27,5,Totally added this place to my brunch collection! From the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out the service was outstanding!My only downfall would be parking; yet, that's not the Brass Rail's fault. If driving here, give yourself ample time to find parking as street parking in the area has changed. Look for meter parking rather then residential street parking. The winning deal here is their prix fixe brunch. For $24 you'll get 2-courses & 1 complimentary "Brunch Cocktail", additional cocktails vary on what you're getting; yet, prices range $2-$3. Pretty good deal if you ask me. Do know that pricing of additional drinks only applies to those ordering the prix fixe meals. The food itself was all tasty! Definitely recommend the egg Benedict along with the dessert sampler. Big thank you to our waitress who helped make this a great birthday brunch for my sister! Can't wait to return and try their prix fixe dinner menu!
2018-12-21,5,Amazing food every time... I used to visit this place often when I lived out here and loved the burgers. I would highly recommend...
2018-12-09,4,Great brunch deal - $24 for an app, entree and one brunch drink! Unfortunately, the bloody was NOT good, but my friends enjoyed the sangria and the mimosa. Food was great and large portions! We had a reservation for Sunday around noon and got seated upstairs.
2018-12-04,5,Every time I visit the brass rail it is extremely pleasurable experience but this time it was even better than I had ever expected. Now I do go there a lot for happy hour or for brunch with a few a few girlfriends which is a lot of fun but this time we had planned our Christmas holiday party here. This may be a little bit different than your regular dinner review but overall is a great example of how wonderfully run this restaurant actually is. So I had decided to bring the team to The Brass Rail after looking at multiple other options in Hoboken. I made this decision based off of the responsiveness of the staff who run the events email program as well as the options for large groups. What we had decided to do was the bottomless brunch drink option with a 3 course prefix menu. Don't get me wrong; yes we are a group of young professionals but there were 30 of us and we are a quite rowdy group. Yes; I did expect decent food but let's be real here - I was in the service industry all throughout high school and college as well as after college prior to joining the corporate workforce. When food is put in the system and fired at such a high volume for such a large party I did not expect the creme of the crop haha. Now for the food. For my appetizer I had the French onion soup, which is absolutely divine literally gives Arthur's a run for their money, eggs Benedict with holindaze sauce (perfectly runny egg included) and for my dessert I had the Oreo cheese cake.  Everything was honestly, fantastic. Many of my colleagues got the other appetizers entrées but one that was a true stand out was the steak and eggs entree. The steak and eggs was a perfect medium rare juicy steak - super tasty. Another crowd pleaser of the meal was the nutella crème brûlée which was a hit. Overall, the Quality of the food did not disappoint when they were trying to get out 30 appetizers 30 entrées and 30 desserts all the same time. Only thing people could even think to complain about was how full they were so portions did not disappoint either Drinks;Perfection as always. I am a spicy Bloody Mary gal and Unfortunately many places in Hoboken have an extremely watery one - Brass Rail did not. Spicy Bloody Mary was a nice thick tomato juice with a good kick but not a "omg my mouth is on fire" kick and I LOVE spicy. White sangria was a little sweet but overall delicious. Service;  I was very impressed with how the staff worked as a team. One solid unit. There was not a moment that a server wasn't at the table replenishing a Mamosa, grabbing a new bloody Mary orhelping someone switch to a sangria. Spot on service. I definitely love food and my group of girlfriends and I or my boyfriend try to eat out a new restaurant at least 1 to 2 times a week in Hoboken or New York City. To say that this has officially made brass rail my go to spot is an understatement thanks again - you all were great.
2018-12-03,4,I came here for brunch over the weekend. We made a reservation and were sat upstairs in a booth. It was a nice space and not loud, despite being packed. The Prix Fixe Brunch menu here is a great deal that offers plenty of food and a cocktail for a reasonable price. I got the Caesar Salad and the Popeye Sandwich. The salad was very simple but had an amazing Caesar dressing. The only truly vegetarian entree option was the french toast but I don't like a sweet breakfast so I went with the Popeye and got it without the ham. It was tasty but since it wasn't designed to be a veggie dish I felt it was lacking a little bit. But, it did come with a big serving of french fries, which were delicious! I really would have liked to have seen a savory vegetarian entree on the menu. For my cocktail I chose the mimosa. A basic choice but always a good one!
2018-11-17,5,really amazing appetizers especially their homemade and house hand whipped ricotta with olives and olive oil and the crostini !
2018-11-10,5,Easily my second favorite pasta dish I have ever had (first was in Italy) such a nice atmosphere as well.
2018-11-03,3,It took a very long time to even get acknowledged let alone served.There are sooo many places in Hoboken to eat/drink therefore I'd think twice before returning!
2018-11-01,4,This place was surprisingly great. We had burgers which were amazing and a great value, we couldn't finish them. The drinks were strong and not super expensive. I'd definitely go back anytime!
2018-10-31,4,Great vibes. Male bartender (don't know his name) is fantastic. Me and my girlfriend come here every so often for some drinks, wine and cheese samplings.Cheese samplings are fantasticGreat atmosphere, more upscale than the other bars in downtown. Not 5 stars because there food is over priced yet under par.
2018-10-14,4,I absolutely loved the Brass Rail's Saturday Bruch special. You get an appetizer, entree and drink for $24 and each drinks after is only $2. I went with the Endive Wedge salad- unique twist on the wedge, it was great. For lunch I had the popeyes egg sandwich- a fried egg over spinach on avocado spread toast with fries. The portion was huge! The Saturday we went was pretty calm, there was no wait for a group of 4 and we were able to stay for a few hours and enjoy hanging out. I would definitely recommend!
2018-10-11,1,I have been going to BR for a few years, even spent a New Year's eve here. The food was never top notch but the laid back feel is why I continued to go. The last 2 times I went, I wasn't happy. First time, it took a very long time to even get acknowledged let alone served. I almost left than finally the bartender came over and offered a free wine for waiting so long. Mind you there was about 6 people at the bar. I ordered the risotto and it was good, 10 bucks wasn't a bad deal. The second time I went, again empty but again long time for service until finally, the guy NEXT to me who knew the bartended called out that I needed a drink. She didn't seem to be happy about  that but came over. I ordered, ate some fries and basically got ignored so I walked out and won't be back. There are too many spots who want my business & serve me with a smile, that's where I will spend my dinero.
2018-09-28,1,I've lived in Hoboken for more than a decade and I used to think of this place as unmemorable, but kindof decent . My most recent visit which was during restaurant week  (I'm a bit late to the punch) was my last.  Food was atrocious, not fresh, overcooked, and misrepresented on the menu. When I brought one issue to the waitress' attention ( following already slow and subpar service ) she shrugged her shoulders, said "well..." and walked away.  I would've rather spent $90 at McDonald's.  Dont waste you money.
2018-08-31,4,It's time I update my review of The Brass Rail because I have been here many times since my last review.  The food has generally been very good.  I think they make the best burgers in Hoboken, and the truffle meatball with gnocchi and the lobster rolls are good too.  The only bad thing was the lobster mac and cheese, which was so overcooked the cheese had turned into oil.  That, and still slow service at times are what's preventing it from going to 5 stars, but overall this is one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken now.
2018-08-08,5,As always the food, service and drinks were superb!!! We celebrated our wedding anniversary with the Brass Rail for the second time and will continue to do so!!
2018-08-05,5,We visited the Brass Rail after spending a night in Hoboken over the weekend. The restaurant is super cute, staff is friendly and most of all, the pre-fix brunch options were delicious! We ordered the egg salad toast, chorizo omelette, the green salad and the mojito and bloody mary to wash it down. Absolutely delicious and for the price, it can't be beat. Will be visiting again when we're in Jersey.
2018-08-03,4,Came here during restaurant week for an early dinner at 6:30 on a Thursday. It was not crowded, but we asked to be seated upstairs due to the noise since it was still a bar. There was also a bar smell that was a mix of lingering throwup and alcohol that didnt wash away fully. The 2nd floor was thankfully much more elegant and quiet compared to the lower level. There was only 1 party seated there, hence the quiet. Our server was very polite and offered us their usual menu along with the restaurant week menu. I ordered the P.E.I. Mussels, Scallops & Buccatini, and Oreo Cheesecake. My bf ordered the Tuna Tartare, Garlic Rubbed Skirt Steak cooked medium rare, and the tangerine flavored sorbet. We didn't want to drink alcohol so we just got water. I was pretty much starving too so I didn't want to drink on an empty stomach.We did not wait long for the appetizers to come. The tuna tartare came first, then my mussels. I was pretty surprised by the portion size of the mussels and no surprise later that I got pretty full from finishing that alone. I loved the pita that it was served with and it was a perfect balance with the mussels in the  soup since the soup was pretty flavorful. I took a bite of the tuna tartare and I liked it. It was my bf's first time trying tartare and he really enjoyed it, especially the avocado mousse under.I was decently full from my appetizer and could not finish all the pita as good as it was and I had to ask the busser to remove the plate because I wanted to leave room for my entree. Our entrees came shortly and as usual I look a bite of my bf's. The steak was perfectly cooked, truly medium rare. The fries were every interesting since they were so thin, but I liked the crunchy texture it added to the dish. My entree came with three giant scallops, mushrooms, and pasta. I loved how juicy the mushrooms and scallop was. Even though I was pretty full from my appetizer, I was still able to finish a good portion of my entree because it was so good. I was beyond full when the desserts came. I regretted getting such a heavy dessert and the sorbet felt like a much better option at this point because it was light and tangy. We ended up finishing the sorbet and left half the cheesecake untouched because it was impossible to continue eating any longer T.T
2018-07-27,5,Had dinner here for restaurant week and it was phenomenal! I had the baby kale & quiona salad, scallops and nutella creme brulee.  I would have licked the plates and bowl if I wasn't soo close to the people seated at the next table. Lol.  I will be back soon.
2018-07-24,5,Visited here for the first time just to have a drink and carry on down "Washington" here in Hoboken. Had the privilege of meeting Suzy who was the bartender this evening. She was amazing. We ended up up ordering appetizers and more drinks. Now I'm full and don't think I'll have dinner. Nevertheless. She's awesome. The mussels are amazing--without Chorizo and the spiced nuts--wow, you would think it's Christmas and it's snow outside. They reminded me of winter. Great Place!!So my family and I went back the next day for brunch. I ordered the same thing--which was amazing again. My son and his fiancé had the salmon and Caesar salad and they both pleasantly enjoyed themselves. I love good food, food service, and good people. These people are good people. My server Phillipe was so funny and just an all good person. The GM was amazing (I forgot her name) but you wouldn't know she was the GM because she was working like everyone else, clearing tables, serving food, being an amazing host, and making sure guest was satisfied. When she introduced herself and told us her position I was surprised. She clearly loves what she does and it shows amongst her staff. Excellent leadership, leading by example. Well, I'm back in FL now but I've already told my husband he has to experience this place the next time we are in the area. He missed out this trip. Oh, by the way. Suzy is the Sangria Queen.
2018-07-23,2,The food took 45 minutes to get to us and literally EVERYONE else in the restaurant was served before us. This is the worst treatment I have ever received and what made me the most upset is that people came after us and were served everything they needed, we were literally the last people there. The waitress kept saying "its coming out any minute now." Which irritated me further because i was still stuck there waiting forever. When the food finally came, it literally was the opposite of what I asked for.  I don't like writing off restaurants but I'm not sure I would go back to be honest.
2018-07-21,4,I wanted to update my review cause credit is deserved.  I was unhappy with my brunch about 2 years ago. While i hold to my review that it wasn't a great brunch i will 100% say my dinner was amazing.  Myself and my party of 4 walked out of brass rail full, happy and completely satisfied. My steak w blue cheese was so good it was hard not to polish it off in 1 sitting.  We sat outside and enjoyed a great Friday in Hoboken.  I'll be back and I'll recommend.
2018-06-04,2,I've been to this place for brunch twice and while it has a decent selection and great drink prices, the one problem is sort of a big one...the food. I've tried quite a few items on the menu and none of them were particularly good. Even the complimentary muffins that were provided (and appreciated) tasted like a dry sponge. I tried to give this place a second chance but when I couldn't even finish the Eggs Benedict because it was so bad, it was the end of our relationship.
2018-06-04,2,My boyfriend and I ate here this weekend and didn't have the best experience. First the mojitos were straight rum. There was practically no mint and one lime so it had absolutely no flavor. After like 20 minutes we asked for bread because we were starving and the waitress looked pissed off at us for even asking (the other tables had bread right away). The seafood platter was honestly the only good thing we ordered. He ordered the fettuccine dish and ate one bite. I ordered the Cobb. I asked if they had any other dressings besides balsamic and if it was possible to swap out the bleu cheese with a different kind of cheese. The waitress was supposed to come back and let me know. I never heard back but got a balsamic, cheeseless salad instead. My boyfriend ended up ordering takeout from across the street while we paid the bill. We won't be coming back.
2018-06-03,4,Me and a few friends went to brunch here on a Saturday and sat outside to enjoy the rare warm day in early April. The brunch special was very reasonable and the the mimosas I got as part of the special were great (didn't skimp on the alcohol). I started with a grilled caesar salad - was a bit hesitant about the 'grilled" part but it was great. It was served as a half head of lettuce. It was still warm when served and the charred bits of lettuce gave it a great smokey flavor. I then got a burger with mozzarella and prosciutto on it - loved it. A few other standout dishes that my friends ordered - banana nutella crepes, eggs benedict, and blueberry lemon french toast (so good!).I will definitely be back for another brunch!
2018-06-03,5,I went here for brunch with a group of my friends and we loved it. We were able to sit outside and did the $23 brunch deal that includes two courses and a mimosa or Bloody Mary. After that, each additional mimosa was only $2. A good deal for the area, but the highlight was the food.We all tried different plates and shared, and the highlights for our group of four were the banana & chocolate crepe and the lemon & blueberry french toast. While not a typical brunch food, my friend that ordered a burger said it was also very good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for brunch!
2018-05-26,5,In Hoboken looking for Guacamole and Craft Beer, found this gem.  They have a guacamole platter with three different kinds of guac! Chicken sandwich with fries was amazing and plenty of beers and wine! on tap.  Super nice bartender, we will be back!
2018-05-19,5,I went to the Brass Rail for a drinks with some friends around 10:30 PM. The atmosphere was hip, inviting, and not too crowded. When we approached the bar the bartender warmly greeted my five friends and me. The drinks were affordable and the bartender was tentative in realizing when out drinks were empty.  I will be back.
2018-04-29,1,Okay, came in for the Sunday Brunch w/  "Unlimited Mimosa's" but they do not have "Unlimited Mimosa's" ... what u get is a pre-fix brunch option for $23 /pp which brings one app and one meal option w/ $2 "Mimosa's"... which can't even be called a mimosa AT ALL! They are 90% OJ and a drop of cheap Champagne! When we asked the server (b/c we were seated at a table not the bar) if we could have at least a 50/50 ratio.. we were told that since we were on the brunch Pre-fix $2 Mimosa option, that was the way that they came. When I pointed out that a person at the bar had a 'normal' mimosa, to our surprise, he said they are different for "Full Price" paying customers!!!! ! After asking for a Mgr and explaining why there shouldn't be a difference, she offered  to remake a fresh one with the 50/50 ratio she said they were 'all' made with. See the 50/50 version photo... U decide...You've been warned!!!
2018-04-07,4,Hanger steak was PeRFECT!!!!Exquisitely tender and exploding with flavor.  I was very envious of a friends Mac n cheese too! Will definitely be back to try more of the menu!
2018-04-04,5,Went for Hudson Restaurant Week DinnerFood - 5/5. Focaccia bread came with a mellow tomato sauce on top and the sun-dried tomato dip added a nice richness. Tuna tartare was fresh and meshed really well with the avocado mousse. The smooth avocado with the nice bite of the tuna was a great mix with the soy wasabi mayo adding a salty kick and the fried wonton adding crunch. Garlic rubbed skirt steak had good seasoning and went great with the crispy shoe string potatoes. Nutella creme brulee was creamy and sweet. The flavor had just the right amount of nutella in it and the crunchy sugar was a good mix. The texture of all the foods were great!Service - 4/5. It was a busy night but I was seated relatively quickly and the service was friendly and attentive. They gave me the wrong entree at first but rectified the problem quickly and without hesitation.Value - 5/5. Delicious three course meal plus complimentary bread for $29 is an absolute deal! Any restaurant that can get food textures on point is worth a visit and on restaurant week, even more so.Parking - Street (Metered)
2018-03-23,5,My boyfriend picked the Brass Rail for our date night on Saturday night. Given that it was St. Patrick's Day, I wasn't sure how crazy it would be with patrons decked out in green. Luckily the Brass Rail has a spacious and calm second floor for dinner goers. The first floor is more of the party centric bar area. While the second floor was practically empty when we showed up for our 7pm reservation, it filled up quickly with large parties and was full by the time we left. Would highly recommend making a reservation beforehand. We started with the calamari, which was super crispy and came with a sweet and sour thai dipping sauce. I enjoyed the special - medium rare hanger steak with a mushroom and potato hash with bleu cheese and a few stalks of asparagus. The steak was so tender and delicious!!! My boyfriend had the potato gnocchi with truffle meatballs. Also a great filling choice - perfect for a cold night. Drinks were also on point - I enjoyed my 'pretty in pink' lychee flavored cocktail. They have a pretty large beer and wine selection as well. Will need to come back here for brunch soon!
2018-03-20,4,Wow this place gets packed for brunch, and with good reason - the food is very good!For about $20 you get a two course pre-fixe brunch and if you kick in another $10 or so you get booze with it! We kept those mimosas flowing.For food I chose French onion soup (hit the spot) following by steak and eggs with fries. The fries were terrific. The steak and eggs were also put together well and came on a sweet bread. By that I mean actual bread, not sweetbreads.If you have not tried a brunch here before, I think its worth it. See for yourself!I have not sampled the night life here. I tried to once but just wasn't feeling the atmosphere when I walked in. Maybe I'll try again someday.
2018-03-19,1,Based on the reviews, I went here for Sunday brunch. I had the app and entree with a complimentary mimosa. Each mimosa with this deal was $2 after your complimentary one. I had the crepes as an appetizer. Very small compared to the size of an actual crepe. For the entree, I had the steak and eggs. The steak was cold and bland. The eggs didn't look like eggs and the bread was too wet, didn't taste good. The best part was the fries. I won't have another brunch here but may hop in for a drink or two.
2018-03-16,3,Great drinks, just wish their egg white advertisement in their drinks was real. One egg, one drink.
2018-03-11,5,Had my birthday brunch here & I absolutely loved it.  I had gone with a party of 15 and my server checked up constantly to make sure we had everything we needed.. The staff & overall atmosphere was very nice & comforting. They have a great prefix brunch menu where you can get a starter, meal, & 1 cocktail for only $23!! With every drink after that $2-&4 more dollars. I enjoyed their crepes & eggs benedict, along with a couple mimosas and sangria glasses. I would def mutely recommend this place & plan on going back soon!
2018-03-10,1,Went there for brunch with my wife on a Saturday around 1pm. The place was busy, we sat at the bar but for 10 minutes no one came up to us. Then the they moved us to the table. We ordered an appetizer, a soup and main dishes which were egg salad toast, French onion soup, then two lobster egg Benedicts. It took them about 30 minutes to bring out the first appetizers which were both cold and neither tasted very good. At that point we were hoping that the egg Benedict's would be great since we had brunch there a different time and we personally didn't remember it being this bad. 40 minutes later still no food, I catch the waitress and ask whats going on. She goes in the kitchen and quickly comes back out with food, yes finally, crisis averted! Nope not at all, both of them were super cold. I don't know if they just don't have enough people there to bring this food out or what happened there. We called the manager to take it away. She didn't even say sorry. The manager took both the dishes we ordered said ok and walked away. The waitress comes back over says they voided the check but still no apology, no sorry nothing...If you want to wait over an hour for cold bland food, this is the place for you!
2018-03-08,4,Every single time we go there is awesome , friendly atmosphere and the guy bartender is awesome!, and their risotto is the best I've ever had ..
2018-02-28,5,I went to this location for a friend's birthday Brunch. I absolutely loved it. They have a special brunch menu, which includes two servings (an appetizer and a entree) and a beverage for $23! Then for every drink after the first one, they're super discounted. For example my mimosas were $2! The food presentation was beautiful, and the food was beyond delicious. I can't wait to go back and try the other things on the menu!
2018-02-26,4,This place is cute! I usually brunch in NYC and do the unlimited deals, so this one was a bit unfamiliar but unique. For $23 you get 2 courses and a drink (the Sangria is a winner, but the mimosas also have a good amount of champagne). After that, mimosas are $2 and Sangria is $3. So all in all, not a bad price and the food is tasty. Only thing that would make this better is a few more food options for the main meal.
2018-02-19,3,Gave this place 3 stars bc there was no one available to seat us when we walked in. No host? C'mon. We decided to go here for the $23 brunch special that offered a free alcoholic beverage, one appetizer and one entree. Not bad huh? For brunch I ordered the salmon with the seared garlic kale and mushrooms. It was tasty but I was let down by the portion size.  I was still kind of hungry after. For booze I ordered Sangria. Was good but could have had a harder punch.
2018-02-10,3,This place is too bar-ish to be a restaurant...Ordered spinach flatbread and chicken pasta... probably the most tasteless things i have ever had... 2.5 to 3 points.... i like the environment upstairs tho.
2018-02-08,5,One of--if not the--best restaurants in Hoboken. My Fiancee and I love this place, particularly for dinner. Amazing food and drink menus that rotate seasonally to offer a little change of pace, two floors that offer different ambiances depending on what you are looking for (plus the patio during the summer), and incredibly friendly staff, and great management. Can't say enough good things about the restaurant.
2018-01-28,4,Came here Sunday for Brunch. They told us 40 min wait, but we were seated in less than 10 min. We got the $22 brunch and I got the nutella chocolate crepe and eggs Benedict. Overall, pretty surprised at how good this place was. The eggs were delicious, the salad was tasty, and the potatoes were different. They also give you muffins in the beginning. The mimosa was included in the price, and after that they are $2 a piece. The music here is pretty good as well, a little loud, but at least its good. It is worth a try! Would come back.
2018-01-28,2,Decided to try restaurant week here... only because of the menu, a few of the options they had looked better than other menus.I did reservations via open table and they only had 5:30 on Saturday so that made it seem like it would be very popular.  When we walk in , there is a huge bar area with loud music, but the host took us to the upstairs dining room and the ambiance there was really nice.We got seated, and a waitress came immediately and offered us tap or bottle water.  I wanted my regular dirty martini but their cocktails looked intriguing so I tried the winter lemonade which had a bourbon infused tea and was served warm!  It was pretty good.We ordered our food, and  I started off with the gnocchi meatballs - this was my fave part of the 3 course meal.  Although very rich and heavy, it was super tasty w/ the earthy mushrooms and truffle flavor.  My main course was skirt steak with spinach, mushrooms and shoestring potatoes..Sadly the vegetables were the best part of this dish... I couldnt even finish my steak, it was suppose to be medium but overcooked, and the quality of the meat was off.I ended the meal w/ the nutella creme brulee....Again it was just okay.... nothing special to me.  Oh, I also ordered my dirty martini as a second drink and meh.  I won't try this place again.
2018-01-27,2,Two stars only coz our server was warm and welxoming.Eggs benedict had absolutely no garnishing and pretty bland.. have had much better ones than this.Felafel balls were undercooked and not crispy at all.French onion soup was tolerable.. maybe after all the disappointments the expectations fell low in anycase.Virgin Mary had mustard in it, not sure if I have ever had a more terrible one than this.Not sure if the restaurant was trying to put their own unique touch in every dish.. honestly they failed..Thumbs down
2018-01-20,3,20$ min once you want to order at the bar.I didn't like the lighting of the place.An average bar, nothing special about it to make me go there again.
2018-01-08,4,Came here for a last minute birthday brunch. We did the $22 pri fixe which includes 1 entree, 1 app, and 1 brunch cocktail. This is a great deal for the food and drinks in Hoboken. Even though it's not bottomless you can get additional cocktails for $2-$3. The brunch menu has many options so you'll definitely find something! The salmon and avocado toast were my favorite. They even brought us a Nutella creme brûlée on the house for the birthday girl!
2018-01-07,3,Good food, friendly staff, good cocktails. This place has been here for decades, I enjoyed it but nothing to go crazy about. Its in the right place for the right price with good food.
2017-12-23,5,Went there last Sunday for brunch. Me and my girlfriend we loved it! They make a $22 deal and you can choose one appetizer and one entree, and also special prices on drinks. We ordered soup and sweet potato salad, and both us got steak and eggs for main course, absolutely amazing!Also the service was pretty good both times we went there to eat. And luckily, we had the same waitress, Rebekka, who is very friendly and attentive. We'll definitely come back
2017-11-25,4,Delicious brunch, bit of a wait but that comes with good food and a great deal. 25 dollars for app, entree and 2$ mimosas bloody's with that deal^.
2017-11-10,5,They have a seasonal "Fall Risotto" it is AMAZING. Also, loved the Pear & Fig Mule!
2017-10-29,4,Great brunch deal. I was able to order an appetizer, entree, and drink for $22, with additional drinks (mimosa, sangria, Bloody Mary) costing about $2-3. The steak and eggs was great, but the mimosas were basically just orange juice. They have a pretty big upstairs area that's great for large groups. I'd recommend sitting outside for smaller groups if the weather is nice.
2017-10-28,3,I have been living in Hoboken for 13 years and come here off and on, they offer American staples a good burger and so forth, the drinks are ok we ordered wi e recently and it arrived in a carafe, we had expected a bottle as that's the way it was presented on the list a bit cheeky charging bottle prices for draft wine.I come here mid week usually and when it's quiet as it get very loud during peek times, a bit rich in people in oversized sportswear shouting at weekends.Conclusion not bad mid week for dinner can get expensive quickly, watch out for the draft wine scam.
2017-10-15,1,I would like to give 0 rating...brunch menu in entrees had no veg option. Service was very very late and not up to mark. And when the order came it had missing ingredients, so had to wait for 30 mins more to get the ingredients and make my own egg benedict and the bread had become soo stiff at the time of eating.
2017-10-09,4,Went there for brunch yesterdays, must say it is a WINNNNN!!!   The staff is friendly the food is great,they have a per-fix menu you get a drink ,app and entree for $22.00 worth the price you wont leave hungry and they give you there little breads with chocolate inside and jam was great. if you want to order another drinks is only two to three dollars on top of the price. we sat  out side i would say make a reservation before you go there because it get super packed. We had bloodly mary's you can tell they were made fresh, not the premixed stuff and the mimosa were good too.for app we had the  Fried clam and salad and the , falafel good choices very fresh salad and yummy ,and the cucumber sauce that comes with the falafel was great, for the entree we has the 4 cheese mac with shrimp and broccoli, and the beef short rib omelet... over all i would go there again.. good food fast service and friendly staff : )
2017-09-21,3,Good ambiance and food, a tad pricey though. But the reason why I put three stars is because I went on a first date and we kept being interrupted and rushed by many people, trying to get our unfinished dishes off the table multiple times, after a while it got too ackward and we had no choice but to call it a night. Unfortunate and rude, under the pretense of service.
2017-09-18,5,I had not been here in 20 years and today we stopped in and so glad we did.  For starters our waiter Thomas Smith (we asked his last name since Thomas is very common and low and behold his last name was Smith!)  He was very knowledgeable and helpful and honest with selections throughout our whole meal.  He was attentive but didn't hover ( we appreciate that) .  For starters I had a spicy tuna tartare special made with an avocado cream underneath it  and my hunny  has the sesame crusted rare tuna with daikon radish, pea shoots and carrot in a wasabi soy vinaigrette.  Both were delicious and very fresh. The "chip" served with my tartare was fabulous ( wish I had a couple)   I had the  pappardelle special with cream, peas, a couple of types of mushrooms and grilled shrimp.  One word AWESOME.  He had Chicken breast 65 served with parsnip puree and haricot verts. He said it was perfectly cooked and juicy thought.  He especially loved the parsnips preparation.  Looked liked mashed potatoes but much more flavor.  Thomas recommended each and every dish we tried and he hit the mark every time so we will definitely be back.  His grand finale... A trio of sweets!  A light fluffy profiterole filled with ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce, chocolate mousse, and strawberry shortcake.  All I can say is yummy. The day was intended to be a relaxing laid back lunch which we both needed.  Yes they are dealing with the endless construction in Hoboken right now but they are troopers and made our meal memorable. I did take photos but had an issue loading them.  Hey my next meal right!  We will be back, we loved it and enjoyed it very much.  Thank you Thomas for great service and the rest of the staff who served us, stopped by our table to check on us or just in general were charming and attentive.  Kudos to the owner, you have great people taking care of your establishment!
2017-09-17,5,Great prix fixe menu. Comes with a drink, an appetizer and an entree for brunch. The food was excellent and the service was great as well. We sat outside. The pictures are of our jalepeno hash and the short rib omelette. Check this out if you are in the area.
2017-09-16,4,Brass Rail is my go to brunch spot in Hoboken. It's a bit pricey but well worth it! For $22 you get an appetizer and an entree, additionally you can get unlimited drinks for only $2!!The menu has a vast variety of food options  ranging from sweet nutella crepes to BLT (bacon lettuce and tomato) egg sandwhiches. There is something for everyone! The sangria drinks are large and good. Highly recommend!!I decided to get the falafel bites and the BLT egg sandwich (my go to).  The falafels were plentiful, I couldn't finish them, since there was so many! The falafels were decent, which is expected at an American restaurant. I'll stick with eating falafels at middle eastern restaurants hahaha.Yum yum yum!!!! is how I can describe the blt egg sandwhich. I love how the scrambled eggs and arugula salad overflowed from the multigrain bread. To top the sandwhich off, there is an avacado spread on the toast which adds a tasty dimension to the sandwich. Can't forget about the bacon that adds a nice crunch and savory taste.  WARNING!! This sandwich will put you in a food coma lol. I knocked out for a hour after eating this sandwhich.I almost forgot about the fries that come with the sandwhich, that are soo good and crispy!If you can't tell, I highly recommend this sandwich..its a must!!!
2017-09-11,4,One of the best Sunday brunch places in the Hoboken area!!!I sat outside on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and enjoyed a two course + 1 complimentary brunch cocktail special and it was delicious. To start, instead of table side bread, they serve these warm cranberry/blueberry muffins and butter that go great with that first sip of your Bloody Mary (at least that's what I got). I than ordered the warm fruit cobbler with a vanilla mascarpone cream to start, followed by the country ham hash as my entree.The only critique I would have about brunch that day is that the "gravy" that was served with my hash was a little heavy for a beautiful 80 degree summer day. Now, that's somewhat my fault because I obviously could have chose something more fresh and vibrant, but it was still delicious. I've only had brunch here so I'm leaving one star off my rating in hopes that I go back for dinner service and I'm just as pleased to the point where I can give them the final star that I think they deserve. Brunch on my friends, brunch on!
2017-09-06,4,Great brunch in Hoboken. The Nutella crepes are fluffy and not too sweet, the Caesar salad is delicious, the steak and eggs were perfect and came with some leaves in a vinaigrette. Come here for dinner once, wasn't too impressed though. Everything seemed to have feta cheese in it. Not a fan.Will come again for brunch.
2017-09-01,1,Nice location and great decor,  craft beer selection is lacking (sucks unless you like beer owned by AB..). Also $20. In for Credit Cards.. that's Against your credit card processing agreement...
2017-08-31,5,Food was great and service was excellent. Rebecca was grrat and very help. I had caught a flight and waiting for a friend and she was very helpful.
2017-08-24,5,This place is probably one of the top brunches in Hoboken and one of my go-tos. A little mainstream but excellent food and a really good prefix boozy brunch menu with it. Highly recommend getting a table outside on a weekend in the summer but go early because it does get busy.
2017-08-18,3,It depends on when you, the food is good, no problems there, service also great.  But we went upstairs for brunch, and the people sitting around you were SO FREAKING LOUD.  Gaggles of girls just talking over each other, and sitting between three groups of them was akin to torture for my eardrums.  The sound just echoes off of the walls.The bar area is good though, a little small, but you can go outside if you can get a table.  All depends.
2017-07-20,5,Cool spot with great food and and the best bartenders in Hoboken. If your looking to grab a drink and have a conversation this is the spot to be. The food is amazing. They have a menu like nothing else in Hoboken. If you do hit the bar and Joeys working ask him to make you one of his specialties, you won't be disapointed.
2017-07-19,1,Just talking by the grab a bite to eat and something to drink.  I walked by many restaurants to pick this one. Happy hour - beer and wine specials ONLY.I choose the guacamole.  You get a trio of three.  A basic, a spicy and one with bacon and blue cheese.  What you really get is the basic three times with spicy sauce on top of one and blue cheese on top of the three (don't eat meat so told them to hold the bacon).Well - needless to say - won't be back.  Won't recommend.
2017-06-30,1,Got sick TWICE from this place. It wasn't just any kind of sick, I was sick for the rest of the day and all through the night. I should've learned my lesson from the first time. When I used to walk by I would always think it smelled so good, now when I walk by I cringe. If you ever had to step foot in this place.. stick to just drinks...
2017-06-16,3,The design of the Brass Rail has always been inviting. It is not often I frequent a restaurant or bar in Hoboken as they can be loud and sometimes have children along. I went around five in the afternoon and was presently surprised that they had a good wine and the salad was OK. I have previously had very good brunches here but am not sure these are the same owners. At any rate, it is a very god choice for a late afternoon cooling off.
2017-06-12,3,Managed to grab a table outside on a beautiful Saturday summer day.  The brunch menu pre-fix of $22 for an app, entree, and cocktail is a great deal, however, the menu felt a little limited to me, particularly the entrees .  I ended up skipping the pre-fix and getting two appetizers. The french onion soup was basic.The spicy calamari salad with argula was tasty.Both items were filling to have as a meal.I stole some french fries from my friend's plate, and they were crispy, cruchy, and yummy!
2017-06-10,5,The bomb of bars and bartenders.So we might be biased because we also had our wedding many moons ago.Up all night martini drinks are the best for appetizers and dessert.Dinner review pending
2017-05-21,5,Love this place and everyone who works here! Joey is an awesome bartender and Nancy the manager rocks. Always feel like a part of the family when I visit. I recommend this place highly!
2017-05-14,4,Thick 'lami here. I was absolutely floored by their selection. 'Lami tell you. Also, great mustard pairings. This place does salami correctly.
2017-05-08,3,OK food in a fun, noisy atmosphere.Food: Had the brunch: Fruit Cobbler and Eggs Benedict. The fruit was OK, nothing special. The eggs were on nothing special mini-bagels, with a few tiny bacon pieces. Also OK, but nothing special. The included Bloody Mary was good, albeit a little small.Value: Just a little expensive for what you get.Service: Friendly and efficient.Atmosphere: Noisy, mid-scale bar.Drinks: Full bar.Trying to serve some "elevated" food, but execution misses the mark.
2017-05-03,4,After an awful lunch as del friscos...my friend and I stopped here and decided to get a bottle of champagne. It was there house champagne, which is why this review is 4 and not 5 stars. It was very sweet. But also house champagne so we got what we paid for I guess.The bartender (female Asian bartender) today was great, warm and ready to take our order. We got a side of fries after we finished our bottle. Which were hot and delicious and the bartender gave us a side of chipotle mayo too! She also informed us of their "wine down" Wednesday (READ: THERE ARE GREAT WED DEALS) so we got one more glass of sparkling given the deal before we left. She definitely deserved the 50% tip we left (hope she got it! We left it in cash and credit).The other notch off the review was for the host(?) the white male in blue jeans and black shirt was extremely cold and borderline rude. We Said have a great night as we exited and completely ignored us. We'd come back for the bartender and fries but seriously guy get a grip, you're wearing dungarees.
2017-04-21,4,We came here for a drink after dinner at Dino and Harry's. It's a good neighborhood bar with reasonably-priced drinks, a casual ambiance, and solid service. It's nothing to write home about or go out of your way for and I doubt I'll be back again, but I don't have one bad thing to say about it.They serve about 8 cocktails, 5-6 white wines, 4-5 red wines, a few sparkling, and then a bunch of food. We weren't eating but there were plenty of compelling menu items. They have a section from Murray's Cheese which I thought was pretty cool and not something I've seen before. The Short Rib sandwich intrigued me and is probably what I would've gotten if I was there for dinner. They also have a Peanut Butter Oreo Pie for dessert that was screaming my name.I could see this being a go-to spot if I lived around the corner and could envision myself becoming a regular. That being said, I don't live in Hoboken and am only there a few times a year.
2017-04-13,4,Came here for work (March 2017) and the food and service were very good.  Very good experience.
2017-04-10,5,Really wonderful meal. A party of 6 of us came in for Dinner on a Sunday night and it was pretty packed downstairs. We asked to be sat upstairs, which is a little more refined and has a more intimate, quiet feel. They obliged and we ascended the large wooden staircase in the rear to a quiet dining area. First off, our server, Morgan was outstanding from beginning to end. Really, one of the best servers I've had maybe anywhere. She was pleasent, attentive, and really seemed to have a wonderful knowledge of the menu. Now, the food. I had the pleasure of choosing the Truffle Meatballs and Gnocchi and my wife can attest, I not only ate the entire thing but used the bread to sop up the sauce. My wife had the Trumpet Mushroom Risotto which was out of this world. You can tell a great chef by the way they prepare risotto and this was top notch. The rest of our party cleaned their plates and left not only well nourished but not overly stuffed. It was just right. Thanks for a great night and not only will we recommend, we will be back!
2017-04-07,5,Best salmon I ever had! Friendly staff add to the overall atmosphere of charm whenever I enter the rail. A bartender that knows his drinks,waitstaff that is friendly that and most of all god people,. The price can not be beat and the portions of food are incredible,
2017-04-07,5,I came here on a whim today as my girlfriend headed back to Manhattan on the train and I was waiting for my husband to pick me up not sure if I made it for happy hour but had a couple glasses of wine and good conversations with the bartenders and peach and sitting next to me I absolutely loved my experience I use the bathroom and it was very very clean it was the place that I would go to on a regular basis if I was closer I think his name was Chris that took care of me but it was a nice girl that was blonde from Bloomfield that mainly took care of me she was very nice and polite and kept my wine glass filled They had a great happy hour I'm not sure but I think I pretty much left them 100% tip I would go back if I was in the position I was in today where I was sitting on my husband to come pick me up
2017-03-29,4,The green tea whiskey shots here are amazing!!!! You must try it if you haven't already!
2017-03-29,3,artichoke with burrata with olive oil toast is the BEST ever. Our second course (blt) sucked. Moderate brunch with good drinks. Bff Saturday I will never forget
2017-03-26,2,Attention people with allergies! I've been to this restaurant twice for brunch. The first time was excellent! It was a great deal for two entrees and a cocktail. However, when I went the second time, ordering the exact same dishes, I ended up having an allergic reaction to something I ate. I have an allergy to tree nuts and am very careful to order dishes without nuts. I even asked my waiter to check with the kitchen that the muffin appetizer was nut-free. I think it's incredibly dangerous for a restaurant to not take allergies seriously. Whether it was cross-contamination or an important ingredient not mentioned on the menu, this sort of thing is unacceptable. Avoid this place if you have allergies.
2017-03-26,4,I came here on a Sunday for brunch! The atmosphere and decor is very nice, but the tables upstairs are squished together. We ordered from the brunch special menu, which has a great value. $22 for an app, entree and drink. I had the s'mores crepes and steak with eggs. Food was tasty, but nothing crazy. Both dishes were cold, which took away from the experience. Overall, a nice place to go for brunch with friends. They have $2-$3 drink special prices, so despite the food being cold, I would go back if I was in the area!
2017-03-21,5,Great brunch! Delicious and affordable; waitstaff was knowledgeable and courteous. Make sure you try the sangria!
2017-03-05,1,Completely unacceptable to be refused a tap water by multiple bar tenders after paying a $20 cover and purchasing multiple rounds. Would rate 0 if possible. To make matters worse, asked multiple bartenders for a water. The second I asked said absolutely, then when he went to pour it, the first bar tender who said no to me stopped him. Asked to speak to a manager, they said she would come around. I asked they point out who she was and they did. She never came and when I asked a second time, they told me she had more important matters to deal with. If I were asking for something that was of large cost or inconvenience to the bar, I would not be writing this review, but we're talking about a tap water. Absolutely disgusted by the the horrendous customer service.
2017-03-02,5,I really loved this place for several reasons. If you like the atmosphere of a bar more for your dinner setting, there's a downstairs area for that but if you're like me and you like a quieter environment to eat, the upstairs area was perfect! We had a great view of Washington St. I had the skirt steak, which was unbelievable, and my date had the short ribs, which was also amazing, but, in my opinion, not as good as the skirt steak. All in all, a great environment with many different, unique choices for your dining pleasure.
2017-02-11,4,Tonight was the 1st time I have been to The Brass Rail, since before the fire. As usual, the service then & now was excellent. Our server Leila, was very pleasant  & informed about the menu & recommended some really nice appetizers & entrees that were to die for. The ambiance & overall atmosphere of the restaurant was, to say the least, friendly & warm. The two women that were with me could not say enough how good the food, service & staff treated us, like we were family.  If you are ever in the Hoboken area, this should be a priority stop. Again, I can not say enough about Leila & how patient & informative she was about the menu. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!!!! WE WILL DEFINITELY NOT BE STRANGERS. My only regret that it took me so long to come back.
2017-02-10,4,I really like the Brass Rail. They have a great selection of dishes for brunch, lunch, and dinner. I never have had a bad experience here other then the occasional slow service. They have great brunch specials and in the spring/summer they have a ton of outdoor seating to accommodate a big crowd. Dinner is also awesome. I would say this is a GREAT date spot....guys take note! I have never personally been on a date there, haha, but every time I am there for dinner with friends we always think it's a great date spot. Lights are dim and they have good music playing, portions aren't massive, the restaurant is intimate and it's right in Hoboken....great for your next bumble date! Haha.
2017-01-22,5,Went here for brunch a couple weekends ago and what a great deal! For $22, you get a brunch app, entree, and drink. There are several apps and entrees to choose from and the apps are decently sized. Come hungry because you will leave stuffed !!!! You can choose from sangria, mimosa, bloody mary for cocktail and each additional cocktail is $2-$3 extra. not bad at all. Would definitely come back.
2017-01-22,4,Enjoyed a delicious Saturday brunch with friends, and I will def be returning! The service was on point, all staff were very attentive and they worked as a team! Food was slightly above average in taste, and there is a pretty nice selection to choose from. The atmosphere was also nice, not stuffy at all but also not too loud like some of the other Hoboken spots.  The price is what topped it off, very affordable! Thank you for a nice start to my Saturday
2017-01-18,4,I had a lovely honey and mint margarita here last night.  Actually, I had 4.  The mint is freshly picked and this unique combo turned out to be one of my favorite cocktails in Hoboken.  Good prices and great service.  I will definitely return for dinner.
2017-01-16,4,Went here on a Saturday around 1:30 for brunch. Cute place. Nice staff. Space is small though. You get 1 drink, an app, and a main course for $22. Food was pretty good. The potatoes were super hard but otherwise the food was good. They don't do unlimited drinks but the brunch drinks are only $2/3 so it's still a great deal.
2017-01-08,4,Pleasantly surprised by this longstanding restaurant & bar. We went for dinner on Friday night & were led up their spiral staircase to a quieter dining room than the loud bar area downstairs. They have great options for appetizers and a creative cocktail menu. We enjoyed the warm burrata to start. We ordered the salmon with bok choy and it was cooked perfectly; not overdone as too many restaurants do. We also tried the lamb which was fall-off-the-bone and delicious. We were too full for dessert, but their dessert menu looked good as well as their selection of after dinner drinks. Will definitely return!
2017-01-06,4,The waitress Morgan is the bomb!!!! She was great and super helpful. We had a party of seven of New Year's Day and it was super busy and even though a few things came out from the kitchen incorrectly she was more than happy to Go out of her way to apologize and correct everything to make sure we left satisfied. Great personality and seemed happy to be working and keeping the convo going with us
2017-01-01,5,I give this place 5 stars for the following:1. On a cold winter night--the ambience of this place hits the spot: cozy, comfort food, and great music. 2. Better than average beer list--they have great rotating beers on tap. 3. I've been here on "big nights" aka Halloween etc, and this place delivers. 4. Bartenders and service has been great this far. This place is often overlooked, and I like it that way sometimes....
2016-12-30,3,I seem to be a minority in not loving this place. I know people that LOVE it. I found it to be hit or miss. The burgers are great. The rest of the menu was a crap shoot. Beer is above your standard bud/miller but doesn't rotate often or venture too far off the beaten path. Not bad for Washington St, but not my first choice.
2016-12-23,2,This is shame! I very much enjoy this place... Until now! I have been here numerous times for brunch and dinner. This is the first time I ordered delivery and I can tell you it will be the last. The only good thing about the experience was the amount of time it took to arrive. However it may have been too fast. I ordered the SMALL truffle meatball gnocchi for $13 and an order of calamari. The meatballs were EXTREMELY undercooked! And when they say small they mean small! The calamari was O.K. But again rather mushy rather than tender. Best of luck to you Brass Rail.
2016-12-20,4,Great for brunch and dinner. Just go. Great staff. Attentive. Full bar and they have a brunch special where u get an appetizer, drink, and entree. Great for group brunches and going out with friends.... For santa con .
2016-12-12,5,I went here for Sunday brunch with a large group of girlfriends. While we were not able to make reservations for all of us to sit together, they were very accommodating, and we were able to sit in three groups. Our server was very friendly and helpful! We had some delicious mimosas, sangria, and coffee. They had a great deal where you could get a beverage, appetizer, and entree for a set price which was very reasonable! I had the quiche and it was awesome! The server was nice enough to let me rearrange my order and get my appetizer of nutella crepes after my meal, kind of like dessert! It was such a good idea that the other girls with me did the same! I wish we had brunch deals like this in Nashville! It was great food, and I didn't spend a fortune. Thanks, Brass Rail! You made my one and only brunch in NJ an amazing experience!
2016-12-11,2,Found this place on Yelp and ordered $30 worth of food online. I will say the service was good, as I received a call from the receptionist who made sure my order got to me alright. However, they forgot the chicken on my grilled Chicken Caesar salad. Appreciate them coming back to give me the chicken haha but it wasn't even that good honestly.
2016-12-06,2,Food sucks. Portions are small. Too expensive. Greasy veggies. Chewy/ fatty steak. Salads bland. Fish undercooked. Terrible . Never going back :(
2016-11-14,5,Great restaurant off of Washington street. The upstairs in a nice quiet area for good conversation with a small group. The gnocchi with meatballs and truffle sauce is amazing! I've had it twice now and it will keep me coming back!
2016-10-02,4,This place has great food! Have tried both brunch and dinner! The Chicken Lollipops with buffalo sauce and blue cheese are awesome! Also would recommend the Kobe beef sliders and the prosciutto pizza! Also. Good selection of beer and wine! Highly recommend the RZ Rose, it's a great wine!
2016-09-22,4,A must see if your out for a night of fun in Hoboken! A few friends and I stopped by for a few Oktoberfest beers and to relax. The atmosphere was chill, the bar tender was super friendly and the location is perfect. Its right in the middle of several different shopping areas and had a lot of business when we were there. The process were very reasonable. All together we had 4 or 5 drinks and the tab was less than $21.00. The menu had a wide variety of food selections including some good appetizers. Plenty of seating at the bar area or tables upstairs and off in the outside seating area. Def would come back if I am in town!
2016-09-16,1,First I'd like to start with this- every BAD review you read about this place- def spot on. I've been living in Hoboken (blocks away from the middle of Washington$ for almost 3 years... I've been to every place in Hoboken and I used to live in greenpoint bk.. And still work in the east village/ williamsburg. I know good food. The Brass Rail is the biggest rip off and worst food I've ever eaten in Hoboken. I went for a lunch, not only were the "hostess" and "waitress" rude and acted stressed and busy (though we were one of two tables in the whole place) the menu was ridiculously expensive. I don't mind paying for what is deserved.. So I bit the bullet and decided it must be "upscale". The result was 2 drinks (one made wrong) an "appetizer" that was a crappy jumble of three ingredients completely different in temperature and texture (I swear to god it was like Luke warm pork belly, cold raisins and lettuce, and fucking cornflakes or something as ridiculous) a Coke for my son and then a $100+ bill. I was astounded... I walk in to your place of business with a great attitude a wallet full of money, a want for a place to come regularly as a local, and an educated palate.. And I got a hostess that acted like  I shouldn't be there (I'll add I have a bodysuit of tattoos from fingers to throat.. Maybe I was being profiled and she didn't want "my kind" there).. A waitress that stumbled through every forced description of the "specials" and had no answers to my questions about said food... To get plates of food that looked like a 5 year old was cooking for hipsters. And a bill like I went to a 5 star steakhouse. Insane. Bonus level- I brought a date there SPECIFICALLY to make fun of the lame attempt at being a hipster brooklynite organic foraged free ranged non gmo "look we have animals with hats and handlebar moustaches on our signs" bar/lounge/etc. I provided the previous critique to her and we sat the whole time "enjoying" the exact same experience I had before. In fact my date was appalled on how dead on my words were.. As AGAIN.. Our hostess, waitress, and food were so bad I looked around thinking "I must be on an episode of portlandia! Where's the camera??". Bottom line.. The only people you see eating here are people that eat McDonald's and Wendy's every day and decide to "treat themselves" to some hap-hazard ridiculous ingredients that don't go together at all and don't because every chef that has any training knows better, or those that want to walk in a place and feel like they just walked into someone's bedroom uninvited while they are breaking up with their significant other. Thank you Brass Rail for being total assholes to me, being condescending acting like because I'm heavily tattooed I have no sense of manners or class or taste, then serving me literally the worst food I've ever had in a sit down establishment..TWICE. I understand everyone has bad days.. We all do.. But I gave them more than one chance. Let's say this...they are so bad.. That me, my friends AND children laugh when we walk by. Again- every bad review you see... It's real.  Also- I'd like to add, I'm not into people emotionally ruining a company because they are pissed- I wrote this review a while ago... Almost a year? Then saved it.... So if I felt the same later I could re read it and decide if I wanted to really say all this- yes. I re read it from a year ago, tried again- and BOOM- I still feel every part of this article is relevant. Even worse they started advertising their chef was on the show "Chopped" and upped their prices. A few of my close friends are food network chefs... And I'm calling bullshit. What world level chef associates them selves with a place that treats their clients like they don't deserve the food they are serving- then serves icebergs lettuce with cold pork chunks, Frosted Flakes and raisins ? The wait staff was incredibly un-knowledgable and condescending to me, and I actually showed up hoping for an actual "decent meal". Again, I've been to every single spot in Hoboken over many years and this place needs to step aside and make room for a spot that actually gives 2 fucks about serving good food instead of faking an image. Honestly, this review seems harsh, but I gave them 3+ chances to treat me like a human being and serve me decent food with decent service. Each time they treated me like I should be taking out their trash instead of dining there, served me horrid food at a snails pace, then hand me a bill that looks like I must have bought a limo to get there. You think they would be extra careful to treat locals with respect... But no. Even though they wanna kick that hipster vibe- I had I guess too many tattoos to be treated like I deserve good service.
2016-09-07,5,All I can say is the food for Delicious.  I am a food snob and vegetarian.  The veggie burger was delicious.  The polenta was SO good!  And even the sauté spinach was so good.  Don't hesitate - if you're looking for good/tasty food, go here.  I will be back when I'm visiting NJ.
2016-09-05,4,I have been to the Brass Rail several times for drinks with friend and one time for dinner. This place is a great place to grab drink with friends or a perfect place to bring a date. All the times I came here there has been ample seating. Sometimes you would have to wait to be seating, but the wait usually is not that long. The atmosphere here is good and the service has always been great. It should be noted that the food wait time can run a little bit if its packed. (There is outdoor seating) The food quality is above average for a bar. I would recommend The Brass Rail to anyone  looking for a great place to meet up with friends. I would rate The Brass Rail as follows: Food Quality is 3.5 Stars, Atmosphere is 3.5 Stars, Price is 3.5 Stars and Service is 4 Stars. The views expressed are of my own and are my true personal experience at this establishment. My personal experience may not reflect this actual establishment, their quality or someone else's experience at the establishment.
2016-08-29,3,Came here on a Saturday afternoon for a friend's birthday brunchpros: she was able to create her own menu with three options for app, entre, and dessert for each of her guests plus either complimentary mimosa, sangria, or bloody mary. (after that, $2 per mimosa, sangria, or bloody mary)The Food: - the falafel balls - i've had better, the inside seemed undercooked. The tzatziki however was good. - the smores crepes were good if youre looking for something sweet over savory.- veggie burger - also tasted very mushy and undercooked like the falafels. The fries that came on the side however were AMAZING. - Breakfast lasagna, composed of eggs, quiche (decent), the french toast (pretty good), but nothing special- Eggplant rigatoni was really good, just not very "brunchy"- dessert was definitely the best part of the meal - especially the chocolate ganache, or do what i did and combine two desserts - have some of the tres leche cake topped with chocolate ganache.Service:-  Our waitress was great and did her best to accomodate us
2016-08-29,3,Came here for a friends birthday brunch on a Sunday. The Food: - pick one app/one entree/one desert. My friends and I decided to each get something different so we could try it all.- the falafel balls: was medicore, did not taste like falafel and the insides were a little mushy which made it seem uncooked - the smores crepes were the best appetizers- the burger we substituted for a veggie patty - this also did not taste good and they ended up switching out the fries that come with the burger for salad (which we were not informed)- the quiche & the french toast were both good and i would recommend these instead - desert was probably the best part of the meal the nutella creme brulee is a must have Service:-  the service was a little slow but however our waitress had a great personality and did her best as it was a little busy that morning Ambiance:- typical bar feel downstairs. - upstairs feels a little more classy - would recommend sitting outside on a nice day
2016-08-23,5,Hosted a wedding rehearsal dinner for 50+ on 8/19/16 at the Brass Rail. Food was terrific, the service was gracious and the upstairs room looked great and worked really well.  Kudos to the staff and to Lisa and Nancy who made sure everything ran smoothly.  Very accommodating!  Our guests had a great time. What more could you ask?
2016-08-17,4,We decided to sit down outside to enjoy this meal as I had already sat at the bar prior. The hostess and staff were extremely nice and prompt. We evaluated the menu and decided upon the fried calamari which came with a sweet thai spiced dipping sauce. Then we ordered the truffle meatballs &  gnocchi engulfed in pancetta and mushrooms. Both meals were very very good. They came separately as asked and on time. The food had to be washed down with some liquid so we decided upon the reisling and a savignon blanc. They were surprisingly good. Perfect touch and compliment to the meal. Would highly recommend going to The Brass Rail for a drink or bite to eat. You cannot really go wrong here.
2016-08-09,5,Decided to try this place on a whim walking on Washington st. We were seated right away and they brought us water and silverware.We started with the octopus and it was absolutely delicious, especially with the sauce they had (bit spicy). I had the skirt steak with the salad and it was prepared very good.  Decided to return a second time during Hudson restaurant week with my girlfriend   And this is where they earned the five stars. The waitress was really observant and made my day special. She even remembered that I was celebrating my birthday without reminder, kudos! Some of the dishes I have tried and enjoyed include the salmon, skirt steak, and crispy calamari. They were all good with no complaints. We wrapped up with dessert and tried the chocolate mousse and Nutella creme Berle and they were both awesome! First time I ever heard of Creme Brele.I will definitely be back. If I recall correctly our server was Leila.
2016-07-28,5,Amazing, eclectic menu. The food was executed with professional and passionate enthusiam; the staff ; Pete and Morgan were very attentive and suggested items from experience and made our experience that much better. Thank you for the excellent t service and great menu choices!!!!
2016-07-24,5,The service was phenomenal. We went for Sunday brunch and Morgan was my server. She recommended the Mures et Champagne which was AMAZING, not too sweet and perfect amount of champagne. I had the fried egg and avocado BLT with multigrain bread and fries which was AMAZING. The place is A+ all around. I'll definitely be back. Ask for Morgan!
2016-07-10,1,So today I went there with my friends and ordered a pasta. I was chewing on it and suddenly started feeling porcelain chips in my mouth and My tooth started hurting. Stupid me thinking it was granulated salt. Third spoon in and a huge piece of sharp porcelain ends inside of my mouth chipping my teeth. The only thing the manager had to say was "sorry, it wasn't on purpose" seriously? I SWALLOWED THREE CHIPS OF PORCELAIN and They didn't even care. Excusing themselves with "we had no idea the plate was chipped" Don't eat there. They don't even look at where they are serving you.
2016-07-05,5,What a nice spot! Kelly was amazing, she was really on top of everything plus she had the time to talk to us. She was very attentive and had great recommendations. The food was good. I totally loved the Mussels and one of the sandwiches that was a special of the day. The tuna tartare wasn't bad, and the desserts...Were freakin amazing. Nice spot. I would totally recommend this place for lunch.
2016-07-04,4,Had a. Wonderful meal on a wonderful summer evening. Al fresco dining at its best!I came here a very long time ago, c. 1985. We would come in in a Friday or Saturday night for a good Weisse beer(with raspberry syrup) and listen to Jazz. Not sure if they still have live music but they sure have upped the selections on the menu.Cesar salad was nothing to rave about. Nicely chopped romaine, flavorful croutons and dressing. I would have expected shaved parm.We split one of the evening specials with was superb in every way. Rib eye bone in with a side of steak fries, grilled avocado and wait for it "street corn" I giggled a little at the waitresses description then called her back for a bit more info. I had assume that it was corn on the cob but the poor girl obviously was instructed NOT to use that verbiage. In her elaborated description she used "vendor style" "cart style" "wrapped in foil" she just couldn't spit out "cob" lol So this "vendor style" corn. It was flipping fantastic. Butter oozed from it, cheese melted on it, my mouth tingled from the slight spiciness of it. Yum! I almost ordered another piece even though one dinner was enough to fill us both. There were untouched potatoes as well as avocado left over. $38 is no bargain but it was well enjoyed!Thanks for the memories! I'll be back sooner rather than later!
2016-07-03,4,Brass railCame here for some Happy Hour drinks and bites with a couple friends. We had a coupleVodka clubs, keeping it kinda basic on a Tuesday! We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese, sliders, Caesar salad and fries. The fries here are pretty great, they aren't truffleOr anything but they are well salted and seasoned. The burgers were so tasty! We ended up ordering a second of themBecause they definitely hit the spot. Plus the buns were sesame free and I'm allergic so it was a definite win.Prices were reasonable and it wasn't typo crazy or crowded we could definitely hear each other and had a great time. Will be back!
2016-06-25,5,Stopped in for fixed price brunch and man is this place a find. For $22 you get an appetizer, entree and your choice from a selection of cocktails. I'll save you the decision making...go for the Bloody Mary.  Just do it. Spicy and savory and just right. Smoked salmon with capers was fantastic and my only gripe with the eggs Benedict entree was that the breakfast potatoes were kinda stale over cooked things. Just leave them on the plate, you'll still be full. And if one bloody isn't enough, extras are just $3 so imbibe in another one or two...or three!!
2016-06-19,4,When looking for a more adult and formal dining option in Hoboken, this is a great option. I've been here for drinks before but went with a friend for dinner on a Friday night and was pleasantly surprised with my dining experience. There was no wait for 2 at 8pm on a Friday night though the place (esp outdoors) was fairly packed. We sat outside on the non-Washington Street side and it was alot more secluded. Good service as our waitress was very attentive and drink/dinner orders taken fairly quickly. Our waitress checked on us often.  Huge cocktail menu as well as tons of craft beers/drafts and wines. You will find what you want to drink here. Menu focuses on classic American proteins (salmon, chicken, steak, hamburger) but fairly wide selection of options. They also have a good selection of appetizers (btw $10-15) and sandwiches. We split some calamari ($12) to start. Very delicious flaky breading. They also gave pieces of soft focaccia to start that melts in your mouth. The main courses are not cheap (btw $20-30) and are a bit pricey compared to other options in the area. However, the food was well executed and well flavored.  I got the salmon and was really impressed w/the flavors and the well cooked salmon. The greens were also delicious and my only complaint is that I wanted more!  My friend got chicken and was also very pleased.All in all, a great meal. It's more expensive than other area restaurants but it's good food and a nice environment to enjoy dinner and drinks.
2016-06-13,4,Came for dinner with my fiance and father. Attentive service, food was delicious and very well cooked (salmon it particular was very good.) Would return but not exactly one of my top places to go to.
2016-06-12,3,Second time here, first was for dinner, this time was for brunch. My SO and I were looking for a boozy brunch on a Sunday morning. I remember this place having "bottomless" brunch but no more. You get a free drink and then you have to pay for each drink thereafter. Now, they are only $3.00 bloodies for the special brunch price but the bottomless was better. Onto the food-- weak. The brunch menu is a Price fixe for 2 plates, an app and entree. My Hun ordered the "falafels" for the app and a salad for the entree. I got the "s'more" crepe and the eggs Benny. The falafel wasn't really falafel, looked more like corn made but it was okay. The salad was, well, salad. The crepe - you just can't mess up chocolate fluff and graham crackers on a crepe. So that was good. The eggs Benny not so much. The eggs were poached well and were funny but the hollandaise sauce was meh. I've had better. Also when i ordered a coffee it was like ice cold. Meaning it must've been sitting for some time and no one thought to change it. That said, the waitress was very nice and apologized and offered to bring me a new one - which she did. So overall, meh. Disappointed in the no more bottomless brunch and the food was just meh. 3 stars for the outdoor seating, the nice waitress and the bloody I did enjoy (along with the crepe).
2016-06-11,2,Came here for brunch and got the $22 pre fix menu. Mimosas had little champagne, so that was disappointing. Ordered the eggs Benedict and it was disappointing. Doesn't come with any ham. Barely any bacon on it. The salad on the plate had no dressing, so basically just lettuce. Plate was very busy but nothing stood out as being good. Would not recommend this place and would not come back.
2016-06-05,5,I wrote a dinner review a while back but this time I came for brunch. Hands down, one of the best brunch deals in Hoboken for both the quality and price. For $22, you get a choice of an appetizer, entree and a brunch cocktail. Each additional cocktail is only $2. I opted for the Smoked Salmon Toast with capers, red onions & crème fraiche and the Grilled Salmon Nicoise Salad with mesclun greens, kalamata olives, potatoes & a tomato vinaigrette. Their salmon is sushi grade so you can imagine the freshness of the fish. The customer service and the food is consistent each and every time. I really cant understand why it has only 3.5 stars. Yes, it may be a little pricier than other options on Washington but you get what you pay for and it isn't a dive bar.
2016-05-29,4,Nice place for brunch.  (Who doesn't like I start off a Sunday with a mimoisa?They open up the front of the restaurant in the warm weather which adds to the atmosphere.
2016-05-24,4,I came for dinner with a party of 4 on a busy Friday evening and were seated right away. Our server was friendly and attentive, despite the fact that there was a rather rowdy party of about 15 right next to us. He knew the menu well and was able to make recommendations, which is always appreciated.We started with the roasted octopus appetizer, which was delicious. The octopus was cooked really nicely - not rubbery at all - and it was a generous portion for an appetizer. For entrees, we had the ginger garlic salmon, the 24-hour braised lamb shank, shrimp & asparagus risotto, and a special of the day, a mahi-mahi over truffle risotto. The only mild disappointment was with the lamb shank; it wasn't quite as fall-off-the-bone tender as we were expecting, and as the server explained, it was cooked sous-vide, so it was a bit lacking in flavor and richness. But that being said, it was still a good dish.All of the other entrees were phenomenal. Salmon and mahi-mahi were both well cooked, and all of the accompaniments (veggies, sauces, etc.) were flavorful and well-balanced. The truffle in my risotto wasn't overpowering, and the texture of both risotto dishes was great. Portions were good as well.Dessert was nothing special - I've had better profiteroles and tres leches elsewhere, but they were by no means subpar. The chocolate mousse was decadent without being too heavy.Overall, I was impressed by the excellent service and the balanced, interesting, and flavorful food we had at The Brass Rail. I know the rest of my party had a great night as well. We hope to be back!
2016-05-24,5,The brunch gods must have received my request-- the menu had a lobster eggs Benedict! The service at The Brass Rail was impeccable. There was a bit of a wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Our waiter was  beyond personable, gave great suggestions and made sure our glasses were never empty. Even though we sat at the bar, the window and doors were open so we still had a great view of the street and got fresh air. Recommendations:I'd recommend the eggs Benedict with lobster to anyone. It comes on a mini bagel instead of an English muffin so it's extremely filling.Kale salad w/strawberries, blue cheese crumbles, almonds, beats and balsamic vinaigrette. *Beets and blue cheese make a surprisingly good combo***grilled salmon Niçoise salad. It's sushi grade salmon so they can make it as rare as you like. The flavor was out of this worldI didn't have the smoked salmon toast but my friend and her bf said it was divine. The place is great over all, great food and not too noisy to be conversation friendly. Oh and you get an app, a main entree and 1 mimosa for just $22 and only &
2016-05-23,4,There's a Brass Rail in San Diego that's a gay bar. This place isn't that, but they do have multiple meat options for your mouth. Zing!The Brass Rail offers both a vibrant outdoor and indoor seating area right on the main strip of Washington Street. We opted for outdoor seating to enjoy some of the amazing New Jersey weather and a few cocktails with brunch. The service was fast and we had both our drinks and appetizers in front of us within about ten minutes of sitting down. I suggest getting the $22 fixed brunch menu that includes one drink, an appetizer and a main course, this is a great option if you're looking to try multiple things on the menu. We ordered one fixed menu and then ordered a la carte for the rest of the way, starting with; Fried Falafel Bites with yogurt cucumber dip, Breakfast Lasagna, which is a take on a Monte Cristo: French toast layered with bacon, ham, scrambled eggs and jack cheese sauce topped with maple syrup, and Eggs Benedict with lobster added on. The Falafel Bites was bland and definitely needed garlic and parsley, thank goodness for the cucumber dipping sauce. The Eggs Benedict was very tasty, the egg was cooked perfectly and once cut the yolk ran down and coated the lobster and mini-bagel, nummers! The Breakfast Lasagna was the best option of the morning, stacked French toast, eggs and cheese sauce. All this topped with maple syrup along with crunchy sweet toast and the fluffy eggs made for some great texture.Prime spot for people watching and capturing the "hair of the dog" on a Sunday Funday!
2016-05-23,5,Celebrated my birthday here with a group of friends and had such a great time. Even on a busy Saturday night with a large group, staff was attentive and went above and beyond to make it an amazing time. Food was great and I personally loved the Moonshine punch. Can't wait to come back and try their brunch!
2016-05-15,3,Always seems to be packed. Maybe thats because it is a very narrow resturant so seating is sort of cramped. Food and drinks are good. I really enjoyed the old school atmosphere although it seemed kinda dark inside. I sat upstairs in the banquet room which was good for a small party. More than 50 people and it will start to get cramped. Service was really great. Its Hoboken so parking was crazy but to be expected.
2016-05-11,2,Came in here for brunch with a friend, food was not good at all. I had the French onion soup and breakfast BLT. Giving two stars for service as everyone was friendly and attentive. Wish their kitchen would catch up to the front of the house.
2016-05-09,3,Went here on a Sunday early afternoon and was seated right away by a friendly staff. The location along Hoboken's busy downtown made it a perfect place for people watching. Had a great time with my date and the drinks were filled by an attentive wait staff. The only slight negative was the food was just ok. I had the lobster Eggs Benedict, which came out a little on the cool side on toast that was difficult to get my knife through. The little side salad on the plate seemed like a waste because it came with no dressing and just got in the way. Again, the taste wasn't bad but it could have been a lot better. Overall, a decent restaurant experience and a good location for a Sunday morning date. Just have to improve on the food a bit.
2016-05-06,4,Awesome bar with attentive bartender and good wine and beer list. Live DJ and cool vibe! Bartender bought us a drink! Nothing better than great service and good music! Can't wait to come back next time we're in Hoboken.
2016-03-31,3,Food: B-I came here with a friend for lunch about a week or two ago. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with cannellini beans, chorizo, carrots, celery, onions and kale. I love salmon - it's my fav. But my meal here was only alright. The salmon was a bit overcooked for my taste as I prefer mine cooked medium with the center still tender. However, it was seasoned well, and I enjoyed the light soupy kind of sauce it came in (with the chorizo and veggies). I felt like it was a healthy option, which was just what I was looking for that day. I got the Nutella crème brulee, which was AMAZING, and it came in a large portion - enough to feed 2 (we didn't even finish it). One thing to note - I did find what seemed like a rock in my food (the salmon entrée)... I was chewing my food when I bit on it and had to spit it out.Service: B+The service here was good - when I pointed out the rock to our waiter, he went to speak to the chef and came back to explain that it must be some part of the pork in the chorizo, which wasn't made in-house. The rock-like thing was the color of the chorizo, so I had already assumed that I found it in my food because some of the bone from the pork got processed and included in the chorizo, but the way he was talking about it made it kind of seem like he was suggesting that it was edible, which it definitely was not. But he was quite nice about it, apologizing and offering a dessert on the house. I wasn't really looking for anything in return by telling him about the problem with the chorizo (just felt like they should know for their future patrons), but when he recommended the Nutella crème brulee, my jaw dropped and I had to have it :)Ambiance: B  (outside: A, inside upstairs: C)It was quieter in Hoboken at the time since it was a weekday, and we chose to seat ourselves outside since it was one of the first nice, spring days in March - warm and sunny with just a light breeze. It was truly beautiful out, and their outdoor seating area was cool and casual, perfect for relaxing and catching up with an old and close friend. I particularly liked that their outdoor seating area wasn't too separated from the rest of the restaurant - they have those window doors that fold to the side so that you could walk right outside from inside the restaurant and those sitting indoors could also enjoy the weather. However, I've been seated in the upstairs area of the restaurant as well (see below), which I didn't think was nearly as nice (less natural light, felt slightly more cooped up). So the feel of this place is very different depending on where you're seated (or ask to be seated).Brunch: CI've actually been a patron of The Brass Rail on two occasions - the first was a birthday brunch, and the second was this lunch. Just a note - for the brunch, they have a bottomless option, which my group opted for. You should keep in mind - if you're a rowdy group looking to reallyyy day drink, this is not the place for you. They keep an eye on you here and really moderate the amount of alcohol they're giving you. They will only serve you just enough and refill your glasses in moderation throughout your meal. I'd say it's good for a casual brunch with a friend and you want to have a drink or two, not good for a birthday brunch where you'd want your friends to get a good buzz going.
2016-03-23,5,Love the brunch here! A great deal and the food and service is outstanding, especially their flatbread! Yum!
2016-03-20,5,Jimmy was an incredible server! We came in with a large party and he took perfect care of us. Will always ask for him when we come back.
2016-03-13,5,If I could give more stars I would. Came here today for brunch with my family from Brooklyn and although I'm a Jersey resident, this place  was new for all of us. From start to finish our experience was wonderful! Upon entering, right away a friendly waitress lead us upstairs( we were a party of 14 with reservations).As soon as we were seated and settled our waiter Jesse was ready to take our drink order and  boy was he nice!!! He did an awesome job at making sure we always had our drinks, we never needed to wait. Food was great, I had the steak and eggs and my steak was just the way I like it nice and tender. Price was perfect, staff, ambiance and the entire brunch flow was great. We will be back I definitely will spread the word on this cute cozy place. We loved Jesse! Ask for him!
2016-03-13,5,Best filet mignon  I have ever had in my life. No exaggeration. Also the $33 price tag is a bit hefty but it had to be about 12oz of a perfect tender cut. Can not complain.It was served with fingerling potatoes that were "hidden" inside of cheesy creamy spinach artichoke dip with a side of pita triangles.I had come here once prior to have an equally exceptional steak, but it used to be served with a hit beefsteak tomato and it was covered in mozzarella. I can't decide which was better but I can't complain with either.Not sure about the other food (besides the salads which we had as an appetizer), but I can't imagine anything other than greatness!
2016-02-27,4,Loved the spicy mixed nuts, the olives, and the drinks. Bartender, Jill was super friendly and chill. Saturday afternoon fun. Dig this joint.
2016-02-27,4,had the olives and nuts.  they were very good.  the bartender was very attentive and friendly.  decent drink prices, too.
2016-02-26,5,Stopped in 2nite. Menu changed. Still one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. Pork Tenderloin was awesome. Joe's behind the bar so my glass is always full. What's better than this place?
2016-02-03,3,This is a long overdue review, I came here a few months ago for Brunch.  I've heard great things about their brunch and decided to give it a try.  We were seated almost immediately, which was great.  Shortly after, we noticed a line so we were happy that we made it beforehand.We waited a while for our food, as the place was decently packed and I'm sure their kitchen was overwhelmed.Honestly, nothing about the meal itself was memorable except we were seated next to these two girls who must have sprayed their entire bottle of perfume or something.  Every bite of the food was a bite of their perfume.  Although it is not in the Brass Rail's control of how much perfume their clients wear, I left with a headache and a very mediocre experience.I might give them a try again, once I finally wash the taste of the perfume out of my mouth.
2016-02-02,2,I have to say I totally agree with Jade's review below. Of course, I went with two other people for the $30 bottomless drinks (mimosas, sangria, etc.) and the two course menu. Seemed like a great deal, but once you actually see and taste the food it makes total sense. This place serves diner food that has glorified menu descriptors. I had the French onion soup which is typically rather salty- this had minimal taste. I then ordered the BLT which was basic and rather difficult to mess up. The fries were randomly pretty good. But my boyfriend ordered the chicken and egg quesadilla- what a waste. It was literally the tiniest quesadilla I've ever seen. One small tortilla folded over. When we opened a triangle up, it was three small chunks of chicken and some shiny neon orange shredded supermarket cheese. We actually sent it back because it was embarrassing. I'm actually going to assume that's not how it's typically served. I switched and let my boyfriend eat the BLT. The waitress (who never made eye contact when dropping food or talking to us) didn't put up any fight when returning the food which was nice. I ordered the grilled salmon with risotto. It was interesting. I wish I had taken a photo of it. It was basically a 6oz piece of grilled salmon on top of some runny, oily 'risotto' for a lack of better words. It came in a plain white bowl, no garnish, nothing. Guess the chef was not happy about the send back. My guests said the salmon smelled and looked extremely weird, I ate it and it tasted okay. Some complimentary little dry muffins with raspberry jam are supposed to come to the table, but ours never did until we asked. I gave it two stars for the atmosphere which is nice. The hostess was fantastic, a thin brunette with some facial piercings I don't remember. She squeezed our table in quickly despite giving a long wait time estimate and was super friendly. All in all- definitely would not return. If you're looking for diner food, find a diner.
2016-01-31,5,I have to say that The Brass Rail is one of the most consistent restaurant/bars I've been to. The service is great and the food really stands out. The menu is both hearty and playful. I highly recommend the mussels appetizer and I really enjoyed the Truffle meatballs and gnocchi. The beer selection is very good and the cocktails are imaginative and well executed. Happy Hour is a great time to try the menu!
2016-01-27,5,I have been a dedicated customer for sometime now food is great and the atmosphere is amazing the last visit I had with this place was good but not as enjoyable than the one we had a few weeks ago I met a young man from Georgia named Adrian although he was new he made us feel as if he been here for years.  I recommended him to a friend but he was no longer there ..good food good people and great times
2016-01-24,5,Always enjoy the food and service! Their cheese board  is great as well as their raw bar. More of a monthly stop for me but I've never been disappointed always enjoy my experience here!
2016-01-24,5,Waiter Kevin,I'm 23 years old. Never, up until this point did I ever think I'd experience the true power of love. But on the afternoons of January 23rd and January 24th of the new year, that juvenile mindset faded away like the remnants of Snow Storm Jonas, which Kevin braved to come into work and deliver superior customer service in. Right from the get-go, Kevin and I instantly connected as we talked about our childhood growing up in central New Jersey. Turns out, he grew up just a town away from I. Despite the travel ban that played in effect this weekend, Kevin somehow found his way to work and played a significant role in making this one of the most memorable in recent years. Thanks to this Kevin, at age 23 I got to experience what love feels like. Thank you Kevin. Thank you for this weekend that I will never forget.- Anonymous
2016-01-23,5,I'm a regular at the Brass Rail, and have had nothing but positive experiences. But today I had the pleasure and honor of being served by Kevin Campanale. His demeanor, kindness, and overall charm really blew me away, in more ways than one. I had a hard time asking for the check and leaving, just because of the sheer ambiance he brought to the establishment. If it wasn't for him, I would probably be 20 pounds heavier crying in my bed eating a pint of Ben & Jerry's chocolate fudge, again in more ways than one. Kevin is the sole reason for my happiness, and made me realize The Brass Rail is the most magical place on Planet Earth. It didn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes too
2016-01-23,5,If you could write an award winning poem on the topic of happiness- it would start with "The Brass Rail." Their bottomless brunch is the best I've had and I've literally been to a thousand in New York. Who would've though the best is in Hoboken. Our Waiter, Kevin, treated our table like a Siberian tiger treats its cubs in a fierce snowstorm, making sure we had everything we needed to survive whether it be food, drinks or a confidence boost. I feel the way a cat feels, having 9 lives and every time I die I go to heaven, except heaven is not up and above the sky or stars, it's at the brass rail.
2016-01-20,5,Came in for brunch a few weeks back with some friends and had a ton of fun.  It is by far the best deal in Hoboken, 30$ for unlimited drinks and app+entree.  You really are not going to find a better deal in Hoboken.The best part about our time there was the service.  Our server was always checking in on us and making sure we had fresh drinks.  I think his name was Kevin or something like that, but he was great.  He explained how the drinks work and that they are only refillable while you're eating and once you are done eating that's when the drinks end.Brunch food is average, but it is all about the drinks for brunch.  I've been here for dinner in the past and the dinner food is much better in quality.  However for brunch you can not go wrong with the Crepes and Burger.5 stars for the fabulous service and 5 stars for the price.4 stars for the food.
2016-01-20,5,My girlfriend and I recently visited the Brass Rail for dinner and had a great time.  The upstairs dining room is very nice with a classic feel.  It was a busy night and some tables seemed to be a little cramped, however we had plenty of room.For our appetizer we split the mussels which had plenty of bacon and the broth on the bottom was delicious to soak up with the complimentary foccacia bread.  For my main course I got the General Tso's Ahi Tuna.  My waiter Kevin suggested I get it just briefly seared and rare in the middle, which was absolutely the perfect way to have it.  My girlfriend had the fish and chips, which they actually make with Skate Wing instead of a white fish like you traditionally see.  It was just average I thought.  Maybe it is my personal preference, but I prefer a traditional flaky white fish like cod for my fish and chips.  I do have to say the tarter sauce with my girlfriends fish was on point.Overall we had a great dinner, and I would def come back to try some of the other options on the menu.  My only regret is that I did not save room for dessert as they have a Nutella Creme Brulee that sounded out of this world.
2016-01-19,5,Lisa B. was the best server ever! She got everything we asked for right away and even pulled a bar special for us at our table. She made our experience that much better! The food was awesome, I got the rigatoni while my friends got the lobster Mac and the French onion soup! And who doesn't love a spicy margarita?
2016-01-19,5,My parents were visiting from LA and I decided to take them here for brunch. I've only been here for dinner but have heard around town that this was the best place for brunch. They weren't wrong! Lauren was amazing as usual; made us laugh the entire time! The hostesses are great and always updated us as we waited for our table. The french onion soup is bangin and if you are hung over (i definitely was); get the breakfast lasagna! We really enjoyed it and for $30, 2 courses and with brunch drinks, why wouldn't you come here?
2016-01-19,5,Kevin was the man when my lady friend and I were in recently. His recommendations were on point. The venison was outstanding. Great wine pairing by Kev. Can't wait until we come back!
2016-01-16,5,My friend and I decided to go to brunch last minute we stumble on this place. Great deal bottomless drinks (mimosa , sangria or dos Equis) with an appetizer and an entree for 30$. I was not disappointed with this deal. Food was good and drink were good for the price . I will definitely come back and bring my friends with me.
2016-01-14,5,Great bar. Never been here to eat but an awesome place to go get drinks. Great atmosphere, even better music, and awesome bartenders. To make it even better, the place is supposedly haunted ; ). My favorite bar in Hoboken
2016-01-12,3,I'll cut to the chase: weekend brunch is $30 for an appetizer, entree, and bottomless drinks ($19 w/o drinks). If you're looking for quantity over quality, you'll be IN LOVE with this place. If you're a foodie and price isn't your main concern... this is totally not the place for you.As a college student, sometimes price ends up having a huge weight on my decision when choosing where to dine. I'm all in favor of searching for a good bang for my buck! The Brass Rail does its job- it filled my belly and gave me a nice buzz;) Plus, the environment was nice. That said, there's no denying that nothing was spectacular. Drinks- options include mimosas, sangria, and a bottle of Dos Equis. I was actually surprised that the drinks didn't completely suck! The sangria was too sweet for my liking, but other people seemed to be okay with it. I found the mimosas much better. Prepare to be a go-getter if you want to get your money's worth in drinks! Servers walk around with pitchers of mimosas & sangria so make sure you get their attention if you want a refill.   Food- I couldn't believe you get an appetizer AND entree for such a low price! After actually tasting the food, I was no longer so shocked.. The food wasn't awful, but it reminded me of mediocre diner food. I liked that each course had both savory and sweet dishes to choose from. Each table is given a complimentary basket of mini muffins and jam to start, which was a pleasant and tasty surprise. I ordered the French Onion Soup and the Mushroom & Goat Cheese Omelette. Soup was fine. I found the omelette too buttery, a tad sickening, but the yummy goat cheese kind of masked it. I had a taste of my boyfriend's Eggs Benedict and would choose that dish next time instead. I have to say, my entire table of 7 people were pissed at how cold the side of potatoes were; they totally must have been sitting out all day long. Decor- Cute! So even though the food was nothing special, it's a nice environment to be in to eat & drink. The ground floor has a more sporty feel with tv's and a bar, while upstairs has a more romantic family friendly vibe.Overall, if you are looking for a cheap fun afternoon with friends, The Brass Rail is the perfect choice! Just mentally prepare your tastebuds for a not-so-good experience. But hey, there's no where else in Hoboken that you can get bottomless brunch for such a cheap price. I will most likely return in the future for brunch, but with much lower expectations.
2016-01-03,1,I've been to Brass Rail before and was turned off by sub-par menu and service. However, they are one in new places that offers bottomless brunches so I booked my party there regardless. Previously they have refused to seat my party without everyone there, but after complaining when booking my party, they said they would seat me. We went there, and like my previous experiences, they were unable to keep up with drink demand. We were a party of 11 so we had an automatic 18% gratuity and As I was the drunk birthday girl, I wanted to make sure my waiter understood how thankful we were for service. About 30 min later I received a call saying I shorted the waiter $100. Okay. Fine. But after the craziness of paying the bill between 11 20-somethings we came to $180 credit and $250 cash for $340 bill with $60 gratuity. Didn't think being generous to my waiter would leave me having to call everyone in my party when they should've checked their security cameras first.
2016-01-03,1,Came to the bar with 20+ people for a birthday.  Bartenders were great however my night was tarnished by some silly move management made.  While a bunch of us were standing at a high top, using it to hold our drinks (like many others) and some using the stools as a coat/bag rack, "Turd" the manager looking guy and some other guys literally pushed their way in and started taking things including people's drinks off the table and then had their door bouncer remove the table.  Nothing is said to us, no "excuse me" or reasoning.  We were literally pushed as they made their way in. I wondered if maybe at a certain part of the night they remove the tables but I left at 1am and we were the only table that Turd and his muscle removed.  Happy to never be returning.  Never seen anything like that.  Well done Turd.
2015-12-29,4,I been here twice before and had good experiences both times. Once for drinks and another for lunch on a Saturday in December. I can only speak about the burger which was fine but the atmosphere is nice and the service was always good. Its also an easy place to meet up on Washington Street. I plan to go back.
2015-12-27,3,I just had my birthday brunch here for a party of 14 and the first thing I want to say is the service here is awesome. Our server was great and was refilling our drinks without us asking, he was flexible with some orders, and just had a very positive attitude. I wish I remembered his name but my bf was the one who spoke to him most. Anyways the place is very nice. The food could've been much better though. My boyfriends burger was kinda dry, my salmon was over cooked, and the falafel was very doughy, the risotto taste looked and taste like rice, and the crepes were cold. The sangria was delicious!  The service made it 3 stars but the food was 2 stars. For the price it was good though and I was trying to avoid going to the city.
2015-12-17,5,Came in late tonight and had such a nice experience. Bartender was friendly and super knowledgable on his wines on tap. Thank you so much! I may begin to be a regular here!
2015-12-16,5,Went here for brunch on my friends birthday in November. We had to wait a little while to be seated even though we had a reservation but once we were seated we were treated like celebrities. The manager kept coming over to make sure everything was good and kept refilling our sangria and mimosas. I wish I knew the managers name but she was so doting and just wanted us to enjoy our friends birthday lunch. I had the French onion soup which was amazing then I had the eggs Benedict was also very good. I highly recommend The Brass Rail for lunch. The atmosphere is fun and the staff is very friendly and doting.
2015-12-01,3,I came here with some friends for drinks. It was the holiday weekend so I'm thinking because of that it was pretty scarce. The entire restaurant was really dark inside, there wasn't a server attending but assumed it was because it was late, kitchen wasn't open? I had a mojito which was not that bad but you can't really mess that up. The atmosphere was pretty chill, not too loud where you couldn't hear the person next to you talking. I'll have to come by again to try their foods and other drinks on a more popular night :)
2015-11-26,5,Had a wonderful Thanksgiving Dinner tonight.. They where so lovely and accommodating.. Showed early due to getting off early from work..they where able to seat us earlier than expected.. Had a wonderful table and a very nice dinner was very happy  with everything a very nice surprise and a nice evening thank you!!
2015-11-26,1,I had Thanksgiving dinner there today, which was very tasty.  Turkey with stuffing, mashed potatoes and carrots.  Then I threw up in the men's room, ten minutes after dessert.  This is not good.  The stuffing had sausage in it, which I suspect was the culprit.
2015-11-24,4,Top 3 best brunch spots in Hoboken! My go to is always the steak and eggs. Cooked to perfection and I love the free mini muffins that you get. However, I've been here for dinner twice and got the swordfish once and it was horrendous, therefore knocking off 1 star.
2015-11-24,1,I took my friend from out of town here for dinner. What a mistake.I got the chicken with fettuccine. I ate some of it until I noticed THE RAW CHICKEN. Two pieces were about 80% uncooked and one larger piece was 100% uncooked. I showed the server the raw meat and he quickly whisked the plate away without saying much. I so regret not taking a photo of the raw meat, especially after the manager (female, dark hair) tried to claim that "the chicken was just mushy from absorbing the juices from the dish." Absolute lies- I cook chicken often and I know 100% pink raw chicken when I see it. The manager was also speaking really low and continuously glancing over at the patrons at the table next to ours to make sure they didn't hear what was happening, so clearly she knew they effed up. She agreed to take my raw dinner off of our bill after we went back and forth arguing for several minutes. I also want to mention that the restaurant was pretty dead at the time, so it's not as if this mistake occurred because it was super busy.Shame on you, brass rail. Just ... shame.Edit: I don't appreciate this establishment calling me a liar in their response to my review. My friend and I BOTH saw and were appalled by raw chicken in my food. If they really felt that the food was cooked, why didn't they bring the dish back out to show it to us and prove us wrong? These scumbags have a lot to learn about food preparation and customer service.  You don't serve your paying customers raw chicken and then refuse to take responsibility for that massive screw up.
2015-11-19,5,This pub is an explorers delight when from out of town. Stopped in on a rainy day to be welcomed by a very nice staff. With the suggestion of the bar tender ordered a cheese platter with a glass of chardonnay. Everything was great. Seems to be a popular local establishment with lots of regulars being a good sign. I would highly recommend it to all.
2015-11-16,5,Probably my favorite bar in Hoboken. Service is always great. They have good brews and wine on tap. Also, they serve the best lobster roll I have ever tasted.
2015-11-14,5,Brass rail keeps getting better and better. When we walked in we were greeted by a lovelywoman around my age that we later learned recently got promoted to manager of the restaurant. Lisa was very hospitable and made sure we got seated right away and enjoyed every part of our meal. The meal was excellent and I love the prix fixe menu - only $19 for two courses!My experience overall today was top notch.
2015-11-09,4,Had a wonderful evening with friends.  The mushroom and onion soups were gourmet quality and quite unique.  The skirt steak was very tasty, and the chicken was superb.  We definitely plan to come back since the service was very nice and prompt as well.  My only problem was that its noisey, but that is the new standard in Hoboken.
2015-10-24,3,Food was great but the service was terrible. It got to the point where it was awkward asking for anything. We got a lot of eye rolling & sass. Extremely unnecessary.
2015-09-29,4,Ok so I'm giving the Brass Rail another review as the first time I went we had such a bad experience. So we went again on a Monday night; place was fairly empty. Few people dining outside and some at the bar watching the Packers Game. We were seated promptly, brought waters and warm pizza bread with pesto sauce to the table. We ordered off the pre-fixed menu. For apps I got the calamari which I personally loved and the sweet and spicy sipping sauce that came with it was great. My bf got the French onion- he gulped it down so I'm assuming it was delicious lol. For dinner the Bf got the Salmon and I got the Tamarind Chipotle Chicken. My bf (who may I say hates salty foods) had to add salt to his meal lol but other than that he said it was really good. My tamarind chicken was a bit spicy for my taste but it had amazing flavor &  the side of mashed plantain & snow peas were AMAZING!! For dessert, I had the Nutella creme brûlée & fb had coconut sorbet which were both good and came with a biscotti. The place was kind of empty, it did take a bit for the server to come attend us but at least this time around our food was good and we weren't ignored as much lol. The waitress was very nice, and we enjoyed our dinner this while watching Monday night football. I guess second time is the charm :)
2015-09-27,3,Ordered off of Seamless for dinner on a weekday. Had the fettuccini with ricotta and chicken for 15.00. The dish was well made, was a good portion (not to big not too small) the chicken was tender and the ricotta was fresh with a big dollop in the middle. I would have preferred if it was mixed but then I guess this is probably a fresher solution. Overall it was good and I will try other items off the menu in the future but I wasn't wowed...but delivery is a tough format to wow over. There wasn't any bread thrown in - but not sure if they provide bread at the actual restaurant or not.
2015-09-25,4,Was in town for business and stumbled upon The Brass Rail with coworkers as we were trying to find somewhere to eat that wasn't a "sports bar". It was a bit less noisy outside which is where we opted to sit. The food was much better than I had hoped for, the appetizers including the octopus, oysters and calamari as well as each of our entrees. I had the swordfish and it was excellent. Nice little surprise was their wine down Wednesday specials on house wines. Overall great blind pick, happy with our choice!
2015-09-20,2,Never really had a chance to see how the food stacks up at this place. Went as a group of four. Hostess said there was only one group ahead of us and wait should be 30 mins max. 40 minutes later we went to see if we were ever going to get seated and hostess tried telling us when she gave us our original wait estimate she said there were multiple groups ahead of us. Don't like being lied to. Went elsewhere.
2015-09-18,3,Went here for lunch. The food was okay and the service was fine. We sat upstairs and was a good place to have a meeting. They did have very loud music on upstairs.
2015-08-26,5,Incredible pre-fix brunch. Went here a few weeks ago from the city for a Saturday brunch. Was waiting for my party to arrive so had a drink at the bar. The bartender was quite friendly and made my Bloody Mary percent. Was pretty quiet initially but picked up as noon neared. We sat outside and all four of us ordered the pre-fix. $30 gets you an app, entree and bottomless drinks, which get refilled really quickly. Each app looked better than the next, but I settled with the strawberry banana parfait and was quite pleased. Other choices within our party included the smore donut holes and lemon marscapone crepes. For entree, I was tempted to go with the peanut butter and jelly waffle but instead decided to go with the eggs florentine with smoked salmon....it was the prefect choice. Presentation of everything was amazing and cadence between courses was on point. Our server was so on top of it, and even brought us a plate of olives for free. In total, I probably had about 8 bloody Mary's that were quite delicious...not an easy fete. After brunch we made our way back over to the bar for some beers and sangria. Served with a smile. I highly recommend brass rail for a brunch. Perfect location if you are meeting friends in NJ and are commuting from the city. Just a few blocks from path. Looking forward to going back.
2015-08-25,2,My sister, 6 year old niece and myself, were eager to have oysters last friday eveinig 8/21. We work just steps away from this restaurant and decided to go after work. The hostess was on point and didn't let us wait long.. she made it happen. We sat down outside and the waitress was really nice.. I believe her name was Susane J. We ordered our Oysters (3$ each). We don't mind paying the $3 but the oysters were so small (so dissapointing). We only ordered 6 for $15.. if they were worth more then we defintely would want to order more. Besides that I had ordered the sweet and sour duck.. (don't order it) big mistake.. was the worst I've ever had ($18) down the drain. My sister ordered the Skirt Steak and it was good but they added so much blue cheese all over that it took the goodness after a few bites. My sister said, it wasn't worth it. My niece was so hungry that we had to feed her as much of the meat possible or else we had said something (they were so busy). Oh and the duck soup only had like 3 pieces of duck.. geez.. I only ate the duck and left the rest. After that we were still hungry and we had to stop by the Crepe place on Washington to fill us up and to get that soup taste off my mouth.The bill came up over 100 not including the tip. My sister said, the best part was her 2 drinks. I didn't drink alcohol and had a soda.With the bill there was a comment card. I left my comment with my number in case they wanted ot follow up with me. (never herd from them).Just read some reviews and looks like the bar food it good here the rest of the reviews were about steak being bad.. I wished  we had read this reviews first before wasting 100 plus tip.. geez (well sis 2 drinks were good lol).
2015-08-14,5,Went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon with co workers and everything about this place was great! Attentive and friendly staff full of recommendations and the food was delicious.
2015-08-11,1,I call this place Brass Fail.  My gf and I came in for brunch on a Saturday and the food was awful.  I don't understand why people actually go there and order food.  I had the BLT with avocado and a parfait.  The bacon was just blah and the parfait wasn't even a real parfait.My gf got the steak and eggs.  The eggs were OK, but the steak was disgusting.  The meat tasted very very old and definitely was expired.  The crepes were also sub-par.The only thing that was good was the free cornbread.Just come here for drinks and that's all.
2015-08-09,5,I came to Brass Rail for the first time a few weeks ago for a birthday brunch. I've been walking past it in Hoboken for years and finally decided to give their brunch a shot. Now that I know how amazing it is, I'm sad about all the time i wasted when i could've be coming to BR! We came with a large group of around 12 people who all arrived at different times. The wait staff were very accommodating and sat us once we had a good sized group. They even started bringing out mimosas for everyone before our whole party was there. The service was excellent the whole time.For food I did the two course brunch and started with lemon crepes and chose the steak and eggs as my main. The crepes were extremely light and airy; a perfect starter. I took a bite of someone else's banana parfait and the falafel bites too. All the food was excellent. The parfait "yogurt" is like this creamy fluffy mousse. I would def order that starter next time.For the entrees almost everyone at the table got steak and eggs. The steak was cooked to a nice medium, just how i ordered it. The fries were yummy and my poached eggs had perfect runny yolks. I was only sad that I wasn't hungry enough to finish it all! The bottomless boozy brunch is the way to go. I've done many of these in the city and usually the waitstaff are inattentive and pushy about rushing the table out of the restaurant. Brass Rail didn't make us feel rushed at all and we never had a problem getting refills. A+ service and yummy bar food in a nice atmosphere. It is my new Hoboken brunch of choice :)
2015-08-01,1,horrible policies. just walked out. came here early for brunch, place is empty. we were waiting on 2 friends and they refused to seat us.  I tell them they're currently walking up from Madison St and we just wanna sit and get drinks.  still refused to seat us.  so now I'm sitting at black bear with drinks looking at empty tables at brass rail. really, just bend the rules for minute. you're empty not making money off me.We spent just about $150 at Black Bear which would've been easily $200 at Brass Rail.  When we left Rail still had empty tables.  Horrible policy.  Not only did you lose out on money but it also cost one of your servers at least $40 in tips.  All because you can't adjust a stupid policy when you're slow.
2015-07-27,5,I loved the music they played here. It was perfect. Drinks are good too. Prices are pretty average $5-15 depending on what you get. Small and dark inside but I like it.
2015-07-22,4,I haven't been here in awhile so decided to meet a gf for drinks after work.  We indulged in some happy hour champagne (which could have been colder) but it went down just fine :)  Such a great deal.  We decided to also order some calamari and the skirt steak lettuce wraps - both were great!  The calamari is clearly very fresh and comes with a great basil dipping sauce.  Loved it.  This is not your ordinary frozen chewy bar calamari.  The steak wraps are very strongly marinated, so if you don't like a super strong flavor you may want to skip it, but I do, so I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The steak was very tender with a teryaki'ish flavor.  I appreciate the quality of the steak because you never want to be awkwardly trying to bite through a piece of steak.  You know what I'm talking about, that awkward moment where someone is asking you a question and you just sit there helplessly with food half hanging out of your mouth while you frantically try not to look like a complete slob.The service was great, we had a girl that was new, but super friendly.  Dang it I need to be better about getting names.  Overall a really great drink & snack spot.
2015-07-19,1,I made reservations  for a Sunday brunch with my wife. As the my wife walked in the hostess did not greet us, instead she scowled at my wife and then sat us in on the top floor in a small cramped space in between two larger parties.  Under any other circumstance (ie. overcrowding) we would have made the best of it.  However, the events were the total opposite. The restaurant was empty except for the two large parties and some couples in the first floor.  The hostess did not then as if this seating will desired, she put the menus down and walked away.  My wife and I walked out and she never tried to stop or question what our problem was.  They will never have our business again. It was clear from the lack of patronage that others feel the same.
2015-07-15,5,Ok you guys have won my business. Thank you for the free desert! Put a smile on my face and made my day!! Thank you!
2015-07-15,5,I haven't been going to Hoboken as often as I used to and my lady friend has actually never been there. So on monday, we both had off and I decided to drive down with her and walk around. After attempting to bar hop we stumbled upon The Brass Rail which was very inviting with its outdoor seating and view of a neat, clean, sexy looking bar. Of course we went in and sat down at the bar. It was just before dawn and the breeze between the rotating fans above and the open doors was comfortable and delightful. Made me feel happy we went into this bar. And the liquor display was very eyes catching also. Its nice to be able to see everything on the shelf. Soo, you never know what to expect from a bartender, especially in hoboken. Either they are just too busy to give a crap or they really just dont. Or you have a friendly bartender like Lindsay who was happy to make us a few specialty cocktails and discuss spirits and drinks with us within our first 15 minutes there.  I asked for a Vesper and she said shes not sure if we have Lillet but she will check. Turns out there was jusy enough for one more drink and i made the cut! I was very excited and she made it so perfectly, i felt like James Bond! My lady friend asked her opinion of 2 drinks that she was eyeing and Lindsay gave her honest opinion and suggested one of The Brass Rails specialty cocktails. She went above and beyond to make sure we were happy and had the drinks that we wanted. Instead of bar hopping we decided to stay because Lindsay was good company and we wanted to try some food and have another drink.  The fried calimari was just awesome. Nice size pieces cooked perfectly almost like scallops, very tender and very fresh as Lindsay explained that they get fresh calimari a few times a week. I was blown away by the calimari because most calimari is pretty typical when fried...Either crispy or chewy. But this was just perfectly seasoned and cooked with a chili dipping sauce. So again Lindsay went out of her way to make me a cocktail of her choice when I asked what I should have next. I told her gin for the season and she made me her own cocktail idea which was really good. Thanks again Lindsay for the great service, skilled mixology and good company. I'd be happy to hsve some food and get drunk at the Brass Rail again. And i will...soon! I then claimed that this is one of the best bars in Hoboken. But idk if i can make that claim yet. But I'm confident that it's one of the best for sure! Looking forward to coming back!Sorry for the length  of this post. I was overzealous.
2015-07-08,3,I've been here for brunch, dinner and now lunch so I think I'm now versed enough to leave a useful review for all you diners. In short, Brass Rail is a solid option for decent downtown food that is more intimate than a bar. You will get a greater value from dinner and brunch than lunch in my opinion. The cocktails are well crafted and strong, even during the all you can drink brunch. The food doesn't underwhelm nor overwhelm. That being said, there a few other restaurants downtown I would go to before committing to Brass Rail but it's a decent spot to fall back on.
2015-07-08,5,Went I for brunch with some out if town guests and had the "bottomless" brunch. Boy were we surprised! The quality of the food and the ability to switch between your drinks made for a perfect day! The best part of the entire experience was our server! Sarah J was an absolute gem! She continually stopped by, cracked jokes, and made our experience that much better. I enjoy my Bloody Mary's spicy and she had the bartender make a special carafe of spicy ones for me! I will be back mostly because of the experience she gave us! Well done!
2015-07-04,4,I attended a business dinner and the food and service was exceptional. Unique touches on common dishes, excellent vegetarian option. It gets VERY loud but it's worth it for the food!
2015-07-03,4,I went here earlier today.  It was nice.  I guess you could call it a typical bar/restaurant with an upper level.  I was sitting at the bar on the ground floor, but the bartender said I could walk to the second floor if I wanted.  I didn't want to.  I ordered some clams and the Kobe beef sliders.  I must say - the presentation of the food was supra-par.  My burgers were well-put-together and well-aligned on the plate they were served on.  They also tasted great.  It was my first time having clams, and I was really impressed how they served them on a tray with SO MUCH ICE.  The sauce for the clams could be described as tangy and tomatoey I guess - they were good.  The remnant clam juice in the shells was also to-die-for.  It is the summer time to the bar and restaurant is open to the happening outer street known as Washington.  The atmosphere and especially the breeze are pleasant.  The bartender who served me was on top of her s***, and you could tell she had a lot of experience.  Other staff were notably diligent.  8/10.
2015-07-01,2,So I thought we would give this place a try. Never again. After we are seated...we order drinks and wanted to get the cheese plate. The waitress said she would bring the cheese menu, but she completely ignored us for 15 min, and after we called attention to the hostess, she finally came and blamed it in the new bartender for holding her up. We ordered the cheese and said we are also going to order dinner after. She said that fine because we have an hour left to order. No less the 10 min later when we went to order...she told us that we may not be able to order now, unless it's the bar menu. Then she said it was ok. So we ordered, 5 min later she said that we can still get our meal, but we would have to move inside. This was unacceptable so we left. She should have told us before hand. We came there specifically for dinner. She said we had an hour and it was less then 10 min after we ordered. This can not happen especially after being ignored for 15 min. Never coming here again.
2015-06-23,2,The service was attentive but I ordered the lobster roll which came with fries. The lobster roll had onions and bacon in which I was not aware about. I also ordered a flavored mojito which seemed rushed. Good service. Just needs better quality with food and drink.
2015-06-13,5,I hosted my son's first birthday party on the second floor of the restaurant.They were really great to work with. Leading up to the event, they were very responsive and professional via email with all my questions. We took up and entire second floor and had tons of people. Needless to say, with this kind of event, you're always running behind on time. But we were never rushed thru the whole process. Space was also great. The décor was neutral so it was very easy to fit our decorations. And with it being on the second floor, it was completely private. Food wasn't bad either. We had a prix fixe menu that had three course with juice and soft drinks included. It was during lunch on Sat, but the menu had a good mix of lunch and brunch items. All this for $35pp! Pay with cash, you can prob get a discount.
2015-05-31,4,Had the hummus platter for appetizer, it was pretty good. The salmon was excellent, had it with baby carrots and spinach; both complimented the salmon well. Service was great and good wine selection. The bread they bring out with pesto sauce is awesome btw. Overall good spot.
2015-05-23,2,I went for brunch with two others and we were seated quickly because we were willing to squeeze into a two person table. Things started out great - our order was taken quickly and the first course arrived promptly. The lemon crepes and smores donuts were great. After that, things went downhill. I get that brunch is a busy time but the wait for our second course was quite long. We checked our watches when it felt like it had been awhile.   25 minutes later, our food arrived. During this time, our plates weren't cleared and our glasses sat empty. When the food arrived, it was just alright. The breakfast BLT featured hard bread and overhard eggs rather than overeasy as requested. At that point I wasn't about to send it back but it was disappointing overall.
2015-05-13,2,Menu advertised for MOTHERS day was not there when we sat down.  Hostess informed us she set the menu.  Drove hour to get crepes, etc  Not on menu   had a hamburger    Mediocre at best   Very disappointed    Bread basket was stall cake.
2015-05-13,3,We enjoyed a great outdoor dinner last night at the Brass Rail.  The wait staff was prompt and attentive.  They easily accommodated my friend's gluten allergy.  The table bread was interesting; like soft spongy pizza bread with a delicious dipping sauce.  Enjoyed my glass of Pinot.  Muscles - thumbs upOysters - thumbs upSkirt steak with bleu cheese - thumbs upZucchini soup - mehKale Salad - mehTruffle gnocchi with meatballs - thumbs up.The dinning inside would have been much more bar/night scene.  The music was very loud and there was close seating.  Great first meal.  We'll definitely return as long as we can eat outside.
2015-05-11,3,I've been to the Brass Rail a handful of times. Typically I like to sit at the bar or bar tables, not a huge fan of the upstairs unless you are a bigger group.That being said, the bartenders are always friendly and helpful, the happy wine is OK, I'm not wowed but it certainly isn't bad, and the food is solid. My favorites are the seared tuna app and their flatbreads are always good! Brussel sprout flatbread is my favorite. I think it's a great neighborhood spot.
2015-05-06,3,Decent service but the food?! I was jealous of my kids chicken fingers...  I ordered the "Brussels Sprouts & Smoked Bacon Pizza", which for $13 I assumed the Brussell sprouts would be cooked in some shape or form....nope.  This was a decent pizza (although a bit greasy) with RAW brussel sprouts sprinkled on top.  I was a little unsure about eating them raw, but figured it was just a veggie....Unfortunately, my husband ordered the "Spicy Grilled Chicken Sandwich".  He was so disappointed when his sandwich came out.  Small sandwich, with sliced chicken, not a grilled chicken cutlet and sprinkled with some hot sauce. That's it....He prefers the spicy chicken sandwich from Wendys!Our drinks were $$$ and for the money, I would have expected better. My cocktail, the Ruby something was ok, but super sweet and I'm pretty sure watered down with juice...I'll stick to wine/beer next time.We were able to sit outside on a beautiful day and the experience was elevated when A waiter (not our waiter) was able to talk to us about the food a bit.  Our waitress was ok, but very rushed...The place is nice and there was no wait on a busy Sunday afternoon, so that's a plus.  Also, it's clean (the bathrooms have a changing station, thank you!!). #waytooexpensiveforcrapfood
2015-05-03,5,Chorizo pizza, chips and guac, Caesar salad, sangria .. And sunshine ! Was great .. Food tastes good.. Sat outside ... Sunday afternoon ... Was quite nice and relaxing. This place is generally packed and it was quite full coz of the hoboken art craft festival. But still was v comfy ... The staff was good. Hostess was nice and courteous !
2015-04-24,4,The best thing about The Brass Rail is that they are a dependable place to get good service and good food. Every time we come here, there is a manager walking around to all the tables checking in on how the food is and just making sure that people are being taken care of. During brunch they always keep your mimosa glass full and good atmosphere going.
2015-04-23,4,Brass Rail is the best (maybe only?) Boozy Brunch in Hoboken!For $30 you get a two course brunch, which is always too much food, as well as all you can drink brunch cocktails. I always go for the sangria - too many mimosas give me a headache and I'm not a bloody Mary fan. Their red sangria is perfect.I didn't love their falafel appetizer, but I usually like to start with a salad anyway and those are always on point.The steak and eggs entree is delicious. They change their menu with the seasons, so I actually haven't tried anything else on their current brunch menu but I probably will on the next nice weekend day.  It's the most fun when you can sit outside!They also have a pretty nice lunch deal - 3 "tastings" for $15.  Some of the tastings are very small, while others are pretty filling. For example the soup is a full cup (French onion soup is very tasty), and the salads are generally a nice portion. The sandwiches are slider sized, which is perfect when you are ordering 3 different things. The grilled octopus is awesome, but very small. The skirt steak lettuce wrap is pretty good, but also pretty tiny. The first thing I ever had for dinner here was their truffle meatballs with gnocchi in a sherry cream sauce. This is still one of my favorite dishes in any restaurant in Hoboken! Seriously amazing. Because I love it so much, I haven't tried any other dinner entrees here, but I probably should because a bunch of them look really delicious as well!
2015-04-22,3,We had brunch at the bar while we visited Hoboken, my hubby was hungry and thirsty. We had a nice female bartender who made sure his Sangaria was extra sweet, the way he likes it. He ordered some bottomless deal. I appreciated that the bartender told us that if she took his plate away, the bottomless deal was then null and void. We got there right before the deal ended, it wasn't busy in the main room. I appreciated that she filled the grumpy/hungry hubs Sangaria one last time before brunch ended and the deal was over. The drinks/service was better than the food, but we will go back and try more dishes. Clean enviornment, reasonable prices, clean bathrooms, close to Path.
2015-04-21,5,We ordered delivery and our food was prompt. My wife and I shared the truffle meatballs with gnocchi- best gnocchi I've had in years and I make gnocchi from scratch the meatballs melt in your mouth, the sauce is decadent but not over bearing. We also shared the Cobb salad, my wife dislikes blue cheese so we switched for the balsamic dressing, delicious, fresh ingredients better than I could make and I used to cook for a living. We also got the Hericot vert, these were a nice side and they were still warm when we got them and they were still crisp. Mmmmmm.
2015-04-21,5,What's not to love about this place, I don't really know. My boyfriend and I are definitely a fan of brunch, especially one at a good price. Brass Rail offers two choices; at $19 you can get an appetizer and entrée or at $30 you get an appetizer, entrée and unlimited drink choice (Bloody Mary, mimosa, sangria, beer or wine). We knew we were going to have at least two drinks so we opted for the second choice. For the appetizers, I got the strawberry banana parfait and my boyfriend got the crapes. Both were really good and a perfect start to the meal. I would not suggest getting a BMary with a sweet dish; not a good combo on my part. Next I had the breakfast nachos and they were awesome. Didn't realize that they bake the tortilla ships in salsa which makes the chips a little soggy but I didn't even care because it was still flavorful and the chorizo on top adds the perfect amount of saltiness. My guy got the steak and eggs and said that it was also cooked very well and had no complaints. We both enjoyed our own meals so much that neither of us reached over to get a taste of the others' meal. Gladly coming back to this place
2015-04-18,4,Lindsey was able to help me with credit card and all is good now.
2015-04-12,5,A fantastic spot!Myself and 4 friends (5 total) had dinner here Friday night, 4/10. We did not have a reservation, but the restaurant was able to accommodate us promptly with a table upstairs. Our waitress was quick to take our drink orders while we looked over the menu.While waiting, I decided to take a quick peek at the Yelp reviews, and see if any one dish (or two) stood out. Several others mentioned the truffle meatballs and gnocchi, and that was enough to convince me.The verdict? They were delicious. The sauce was so good, I was tempted to lick the bowl. I think my eyes rolled back inside my head a few times.I should also mention I had a terrific bowl of french onion soup before my entree.I enjoyed my meal at The Brass Rail, and I look forward to trying their brunch the next time I visit Hoboken.
2015-03-30,1,Great bar but if you are looking to eat, go somewhere else. Menu is extremely limited and the potions are small and not impressive.  With so much selection in Hoboken go somewhere else if you would like to get your money's worth.
2015-03-29,1,This review is based off the pre-fixed brunch. You have two options $19 for a starter and entree and $30 for the same plus bottomless mimosas and bloody marys. I opted for the food only. With the $19 you are not offered complimentary coffee or soft drinks those are extra. Seems a bit steep in my option. I got the sweet potato and ricotta crepe as my first order, was very bland with no flavor and was pretty small. Would have expected more!As my main dish I chose the eggs Benedict however since I don't eat bacon I chose the Salmon which was an additional $7.... That's crazy! The potatoes were over seasoned and cold. The eggs looked good at first but once I cut into them they still had uncooked white.  So at this point I have myself a $26 bunch that is so underwhelming it made me sick. At least offer coffee for your guests in the $19 pre fix it would help soften the blow of your over priced crap food. I'm not pretending to be a critic, I am however a 12 year restaurant worker who expects to get what  they pay for. If you don't need to drink with your brunch go someplace else. I don't understand what half of Hoboken sees in this place. Didn't want to go today and won't ever be back tmrw. Oh and I'm telling anyone who will listen. PS the server was very nice. The one star is for her.
2015-03-28,5,Great music in weekend.  The drinks are delicious. . I recommend the honey mint margarita. It tastes like the perfect hybrid of a mojito and margarita !  I also recommend the guac with chips. You get three different guacs all delicious! Esp the one with bacon and blue cheese mixed into it.
2015-03-23,4,After years in Hoboken, we finally made it here. We did the brunch prix fix lunch, no drinks. The French onion soup was pretty pedestrian, but the burger really was cooked to perfection. Juicy and well balanced. And the fries were spot on; some of the best in Hoboken. Come early though; all of the tables are filled by noon at the latest. I'll be back here for sure.
2015-03-16,5,Absolutely loved the lobster roll and brussel sprout & bacon pizza - soooo delicious!!! The lobster roll had bacon in it and it was just amazing!  Brussel sprout & bacon pizza was also very good - more like a flatbread - great assortment of beers from different countries - Love coming to The Brass Rail for a game since they don't have your typical bar food and service is great!
2015-03-03,4,Came for dinner with friends. Love the fact that they validate parking. Was packed but not too loud. Had an appetizer portion of the gnocchi but should have got the full portion. It was amazing!! Had the short ribs and polenta which was also good. My drink was some sort of flavored champagne I think I had 3 flavors. Planning to return for brunch but I must also have that gnocchi again!
2015-03-02,4,I came here for dinner, and it was delicious. Everything was very tasty and very fresh. Just from passing by, I wouldn't have guessed it would be as good as it was. The upstairs dining area was really nice too and definitely a step up from sitting on the first floor in the bar area.The only negative was that we were completely crammed in. When we were seated (and even when we left), the dining area was maybe half full, yet they crammed everyone into one corner of the room. We had maybe six inches in any given direction between us and the neighboring table. Even the servers had to shimmy between tables to get to people. The overall experience would have been better if we had a little more elbow room.
2015-02-28,3,This was my first time here, so maybe thy were having an off day in the kitchen, but everything my sister and I ordered was not good. From my French onion soup being weirdly sweet to the "side salad" that was really just a pile of mixed greens with nothing on it taking up space on my plate, mediocre would be a compliment. Flavorless and lacking and thought, I don't really understand why this place was so crowded. Coffee wasn't even included in the prix fix brunch that we ordered. The only up side was that the service was fast and the waitress was pleasant and attentive.
2015-02-27,4,The best quality brunch in town, hands down! My husband and I take our inlaws here every time they visit and they love it. My father in law raves about the meatballs. Love our once a month visit. Perhaps we should make it more frequent!
2015-02-11,2,Did the Prix Fix, not bad but not great. The dessert was especially underwhelming (I tried both the tres leches and bananas foster)
2015-02-10,1,We have been to the Brass Rail many times over the past few years and have had an OK to very nice experiences each time.  We ate there on Thanksgiving and had one of the worst experiences ever in a restaurant.  After waiting for a very  long time at our reserved table and our drink order finally being taken by the hostess (after we complained), we had the pleasure of dealing with an incompetent waiter who barely had a clue as to the basics of his job. This guy actually wanted us to order our desserts in advance of the meal!!  When we told him we would decide if we want desserts and if so, order them at the conclusion of our meal he stood there and rudely read off what all of the dessert choices were and ignored what I had just told him.  He was unfriendly, unprofessional and a tremendous turn off to deal with.  The bland and boring turkey dinner consisted of extremely small portions that actually looked like a lunch plate and not a Thanksgiving dinner by any measure.  These servings were just tiny and much smaller then what was served to us every other time we had been there, including two other Thanksgiving reservations in prior years.Then the real problem occurred.  We were subjected to a situation in which we were overcharged and the management refused to correct the situation and refund the amount of the over charges!All of our drinks were purchased within the time of their happy hour during which they offer half prices on all draught beers from 4-7 Monday Through Friday.  We did not realize it when we were there but this gem of a waiter charged us full price for each and every pour.  When I called and spoke with the manager (after sending an email the very next morning to which I received NO response for days) I was informed by the manager that they "do not issue refunds".  What in the world  do you mean you do not issue refunds??  You over charged ME and the refund money is MINE, not  yours!  This is a sign of complete indifference or incompetence on the part of this manager.  Under no circumstances do you treat a customer this way.  There is no justification for it especially when we paid  happy hour prices on all draughts during our two prior Thanksgiving visits and there was no mention of any changes on this year's menu!Further, this horror occurred after visiting the Brass Rail at least 15 times over the last four years (this was our third Thanksgiving dinner there) and never, ever complaining about anything in the past as there was no need to.  The people who own / manage this place are not too bright.  All they needed to do was correct the mistake made by this moronic waiter by at very least issuing the refund that was due to me for the overcharges (which is all we asked for) and I would have been satsified and continued to patronize their restaurant.  After the complete incompetence of this so called waiter, the embarrasingly tiny portions (in place of what were robust holiday meal sized portions in the past) and absolutely no concern or resolution from the management,  I would never again go there.  I would also advise others to take notice of  the large amount of negative reviews they have received here on Yelp and other places.  Be sure also to read the "not currently recommended" reviews  to further see what others have been saying about their experiences here.
2015-02-09,4,While downstairs noise level is high for dining, upstairs is much quieter.  Food is always good as well are specials.  One ding on service.  My wife's wine glass had lipstick stain.  Pointed this out to nearest staff - busboy as waiter was not nearby.  Nothing was done perhaps due to language barrier.  I walked glass over to upstairs bar and replacement was brought over within a few minutes.  No other service issues.  Food was very tasty.  We did not have room for dessert.
2015-02-03,3,I went to The Brass Rail during Hudson Restaurant Week. For my starter I had the Fried Calamari which was great. The Calamari was made fresh and was nice and tender. For my entrée I had the Mahi Mahi which was over cooked and the flavors were just ok. For dessert I had the Nutella Creme Brûlée which was very good. I would return just to try other dishes but it wouldn't be the my first section of restaurants to choose from.
2015-01-31,4,I was honestly apprehensive eating dinner in Hoboken as it is known more for their sports bar. The 3 star on yelp didn't help either but I was forced by some friends and I am glad that I went. Since it is Hudson restaurant week, I decided to opt for the "safe" choices because how can you go wrong. If your "safe choices" are bad, it is at least edible. If it's superb than you know everything on the menu will reflect that. First course, I had the calamari. It was fresh-crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. They were huge pieces as well. It came with a Thai chili vinaigrette that was really good. It was light and tangy not like our normal thick sauce. Main course I had the garlic rubbed skirt steak with spinach and skinny crispy potatoes topped with mushroom and bleu cheese. It was juicy and flavorful. Last course, the nutella creme brulee. Whoever thought of this was a genius. I was so full but I could not put my spoon down! Overall, I really loved everything I had and I would definitely come back and try other dishes. The portions were decent as well.Besides the food, I would say service was great considering they were busy. The employees were nice and attentive. Downstairs is a bar if you are going for a more casual vibe. There's music etc.. We dined upstairs for a more formal vibe. It's cozy but nothing to fancy.
2015-01-20,4,Haven't had a bad experience here. Usually easy to get a table, nice atmosphere and well priced menu. Had a salmon Caesar salad both times and it was delicious
2015-01-05,4,In general, I really like this place and go often when I'm in Hoboken, hence the 4 stars. I think the food is good and they offer a good selection of cocktails and spirits. However, I went for brunch the other day and wasn't too impressed. For brunch, you have the option of a. $19 for an app and an entree or b. $30 for an app, an entree, and unlimited mimosas, bloody mary's or red sangria while there. This deal lasts until 3pm on Sunday. When we arrived, they took us upstairs and sat us down right away. The place was packed and so loud I couldn't even hear myself think. I guess this is the place to be for brunch on a Sunday in Hoboken! Anyway, we sat down and asked if we could have a mimosa until the rest of our party arrived. He said he would allow us 1. Fair enough. Two more girls came and we sat waiting around for awhile before the waiter finally came back (granted, we now had 4 instead of the 6 we had promised). When we finally tracked him down we asked for more mimosas and some corn muffins. They both took a fairly long time. Finally got the mini muffins with raspberry jelly, and I asked if we could have butter too. I think I asked 15 times to 3 different people. FINALLY, got the butter. GRRR.Overall, I thought the brunch menu was a bit limited (similar to most places), but what I had was tasty. They give you a variety of app options from oatmeal, yogurt, and other breakfast options to salads and soups. I went with the French Onion soup, which was tasty. After that, I had the fried egg BLT with egg whites and a salad instead of fries, which they gave to me no problem. The BLT was good, I liked the avocado and alfalfa sprouts on my multigrain toast, it felt pretty healthy. General consensus, I still really like this place, but I think I'll stick to happy hour and dinner instead of brunch. While the food was good, the service was pretty spotty and I ended up getting agitated with the waiter a few times, maybe he was just super busy, who knows. The mimosas seemed to have very little alcohol in them too :(
2014-12-28,5,Review for the bar only, as I've never eaten a meal there. The beer selection is phenomenal. They have so many different types of craft beers in bottles and on tap. The wine selection is also pretty good. They even have some decent wines on tap! The bartenders are very knowledgable about the selection and friendly. What more could you ask for in a local bar? We had the guacamole experiment app. It was okay. The experiment is that they give you three different "kinds" of guac- regular, with sriracha, with bacon & blue cheese. They don't quite give you enough chips to finish, but they gave us more when we asked.   They have two flat screens over the bar. It's nice to have them, but they don't take over the room.
2014-12-26,3,My friend and I stumbled into The Brass Rail for bottomless brunch.  For $30 you get an appetizer, entree, and choice of mimosas, sangria, beer or bloody marys.  I liked  that you weren't condemned to one kind of drink over the entire course of your meal.  The brunch menu was somewhat limited; I was craving an omelet but no such luck.  We tried the french onion soup, falafel bites, and salmon citrus salad.  I much preferred the drinks over the food.
2014-12-05,3,Brass Rail is the epitome of Hoboken restaurants: mediocre, with the prices of New York without the refinement. I live on the block so needless to say my life would be so much easier if I loved this place, so I am writing a productive review in hopes they change a few things!First off I will say the service is excellent. Every manager, server, bartender I've come in contact with has been so accommodating, professional and kind which I really appreciate. Let's get the worst out of the way - the cocktails are terrible! I don't know why it's infuriating to me - I guess because if you're going to charge $10+ I'm expecting a good drink.Almost every time I've ordered a cocktail I have sent it back. I know better now and just stick to wine/beer.  Drinks are all sweeter than the description lets on, and menu is uninspired. Why no mulled wine or other seasonal cocktail? It's decorated so nicely for the holidays and I can't get a nice cozy drink? I once ordered a sangria which tasted more like fruit punch sugar water served in a water glass with ice without fruit. I didn't even bother sending that one back. I am begging you: PLEASE hire a barista to redo the entire cocktail list along everything associated with it! Food is ok. The menu is kind of all over the place. I had the salmon last night. Texturally the dish was off everything was soft, but flavors were there. I've had a million better salmon dishes. You're better off with their bar menu. This review sounds like the restaurant is terrible and it's really not, I just wish Hoboken would raise the bar (no pun intended) with their food and drink and this would be an ideal place to begin.
2014-11-29,2,Way expensive for what you get.We went there with our kids. Let me tell you, I have never been asked to pay 12$(!!!!) For a kids chicken fingers with French fries and ice cream meal (not even at Hoboken's more expensive establishments). There is simply no justification. None.The adults' portions were just OK. Also small sized in comparison to a huge amount of french fries.I gave 2 stars as the food itself was OK. The prices are so ridiculously high in comparison to portion size, that you better off going somewhere else.
2014-11-25,5,When I moved downtown I desperately searched for a new "home bar" and after testing the waters surrounding 2nd and Wash I decided on Brass Rail. The food is awesome and they have a great selection. Their brunch is on point. Getting a drink there after work or on weekends is always easy. I also made a recent discovery that they have Prosecco on tap... Enough said. I bring everyone I know.
2014-11-24,4,My boyfriend and I came back here on Saturday night for dinner, and we had an absolutely wonderful meal. I ordered the tuna tartar appetizer, which was like raw tuna and guacamole nachos...and he had the lamb sausage, which was also excellent.For entrees, I chose the seared tuna and he had the garlic skirt steak. My tuna was excellent, and they easily subbed me veggies for the starchy side. As I've mentioned before, I rarely drink (neither does my better half) but we both ordered something randomly for a change. He had some kind of moonshine cocktail that was POTENT. And came with whiskey soaked cherries that will certainly clear your sinuses! My dirty martini was perfection...something I rarely find these days. All around a fantastic meal. The only negative is the bar crowd gets a bit loud and it's hard to talk over dinner.
2014-11-23,4,Just left the brass rail. We were a party of 12 and everyone had a great time. Great service, enjoyed the brunch menu with the unlimited drinks. The only complaint out of 12 people was the eggs Benedict. Needs a little work. Brett was soggy, not enough bacon. Also would be better with Canadian bacon and English muffin versus untoasted bread.  Steak and eggs were delicious. We were disappointed as the French onion soup and the falafel lights were out. All in all a great experience.
2014-11-15,2,Service, vibe & decor is good, but don't ever order the strip steak here it's an embarrassment.  If you want to relive being a 5 year old with having your steak cut up by your mommy then go ahead and get the steak here.  Couldn't even find the steak as it was covered under a mountain of fries.  I asked for a medium cooked steak; waitress said medium rare and I again said medium so of course the steak came out cut up as rare.  Worst steak I've ever had.  Can't take this place seriously with an embarrassing dish like this.
2014-11-12,2,Of all the places in Hoboken, this one has never been my favorite. It has such potential given its location, beautiful bar and ambiance, but the food just doesn't match up. I've been here for both dinner and brunch and neither was very appealing. Overall, the food lacks flavor, everything is just kind of mediocre or bland. The burger was just OK - nothing to write home about. The french onion soup is also just OK - it didn't have amazing crusty cheese or a bold taste. It was just soup. And don't even think about getting the crispy falafel. It was probably one of the worst foods I have ever eaten. It lacks any sort of "crispiness" and basically tastes like wet bread. The bar is a completely different story. There's a decent selection of beer on draught, inventive cocktails and the bloody marys are actually delicious. There's a pretty good unlimited drinking brunch deal which is worth getting if you're getting your drink on. Service is good; nothing spectacular but nothing terrible either. They get the job done. I'd drop in for a drink, but wouldn't stay for a meal.
2014-11-11,4,Been here twice: once for brunch and once for dinner Atmosphere: split between a somewhat mature bar area downstairs and a bit classier upstairs. Service: consistently good, very attentiveBrunch:$19 for two course prix fixe$30 for two course prix fixe + bottomless mimosas, bloody Marys, beer and Sangria**the second option is totally worth it if you plan to have at least two drinks!**-French Onion Soup: if you like it, get it here!-Sweet Potato Crepe: very sweet, but yummy!-Steak & Eggs: steak over cooked, but the fries were incredible -Eggs Benedict: decent. Hollandaise sauce didn't look homemade and be warned that this is not a classic Benny. There isn't ham, but instead crumpled bacon bits on top. This one was just okayDinner:-Grilled octopus: get this!! It's absolutely incredible! Seriously...GET THIS!-Calamari: good, but nothing compared to the grilled octopus-Argentinian Steak: very, very tasty. Little fries were just for looks though -Truffle Meatballs & Gnocchi: Oooooof, way tooooo rich. I gained 5lbs with that meal alone. That being said... I ate the whole thing, so if you're looking to indulge...Great experience and I would certainly recommend for brunch, girls dinner, or a date night!!
2014-11-05,1,Seated via a reservation on a Saturday evening early and only a party of 3...  order was promptly taken but was horrifically slow to arrive.  and it was not correct.  Constantly the waitress and hostess pushed us to order another drink. when we just wanted our food.   this used to be a go to spot but no longer.
2014-11-05,5,WOW, I went last night for the Bruichladdich Scotch tasting, (Scotch was out of this world) and had a pint of Pranqster (5 stars) and the Lamb sausage appetizer, (5 stars). The 2 bartenders were probably the most engaging I have encountered in a very long time, (and pretty too).  I love the old time feel of the restaurant itself, and I am amazed how well stocked the bar is, and extensive menu for food. I think I have found a new place to go, even though it is an hour train ride. Upstairs at the scotch tasting, the hors d oeuvres were very tasty and plentiful. The staff up there, also very friendly and helpful, and the room was very cozy and fun.Definitely a new restaurant on the list for me.
2014-10-29,1,Brass Rail is a fine place to have a beer!
2014-10-25,3,We visited here one evening in July to meet up with friends who lived in the area. It was very simple and cozy. They had a simple bar menu with great appetizers & entrees we could share with one another. Fairly decent prices. Bartender and servers were attentive and respectful
2014-10-22,5,MUST GET THE OCTOPUS. its the best ive ever had and i basically get it every time its on a menu..the service can be a toss up and i think some of the entres can be a toss up too.but over all its good. when we are having business meetings i always suggest this place because hoboken is lacking in the decent restaurant scene. i like the atmosphere, drinks, and good food. (and especially when my boyfriend pays!)
2014-10-19,4,I have been to the Brass Rail twice for Saturday brunch, and both were good experiences. The food is good, mimosas are refreshing, and the staff was friendly and attentive. Both times I had the same thing- mimosas, strawberry banana parfait, and steak and eggs. All were so good, I'll probably order the same next time. I'd recommend it for brunch, but on a nice day, it might be worthwhile to make reservations.
2014-10-19,5,Sat at the bar for a great brunch!  Bartenders Joey and Kristy had great recommendations! Service was fantastic!  Awesome Sunday brunch:)
2014-10-15,2,I will keep this simple:The restaurant was empty. Aside from my boyfriend and I, there were 2 other patrons. Why did it take over 10 minutes for us to get water? We shared the Beef Tartare and Chorizo Pizza. The Beef Tartare, mustard, capers, the usual. It was tasty and classic- I just felt like it was missing something. I can't put my finger on it. The Chorizo & Ricotta pizza was more like a well done flatbread, and we both found it very dry. The sprinkles of chorizo drizzled over it was the greatest disappointment of the meal. There was soooo little meat. The service was terrible because it was allll over the place. We got sat by one person, a different person (who I can only assume was a manager based on what he was wearing) took our order, a third delivered the food, a fourth lady (who was very nice) came to check on us, and then yet another person (who had a very shitty attitude) delivered our check. We had to ask him for a pen so that we could make a quick note of our experience on the receipt, and he was clearly annoyed to have to lend us one. Not happy.
2014-10-14,2,I have been here twice with some friends who live in the area and have been really unimpressed both times.  Which was disappointing because it is known to be one of the only "real brunch spots" in Hoboken.I have had the burger and the Eggs Benedict off the brunch menu with "unlimited" drinks. I thought the food was mehh and the servers took so long to get us drinks that we were sitting without any for up to 25 minutes.  Within the entire time being there, some of us only managed to get 2 drinks - not very "unlimited".It is the price of a NYC brunch but without the pizzaz you get in NYC, but still a place to get some hangover food on the weekend if you're in Hoboken.
2014-10-11,3,Brunch is usually ok. However for dinner stick to the apps and drinks. Entrees are repeatedly disappointing.Wait staff is usually ok but the hosts are unnecessarily rude. FYI: If you only have drinks and apps but don't have dinner, the policy is to ask you to leave the table. I guess this is important for the summer months but the delivery of the message is so rude that it is off putting. Also they take no responsibility for food errors. This summer we had a monk fish entree with fish that was overcooked and shriveled into a dry sponge.  We asked to send it back. The server brought over the head hostess. She did not bother to apologize and was generally unfriendly. She just asked if we wanted something else. We decided not to bother since it took so long for someone to help us with the issue.They have a beautiful restaurant but that does not make up for subpar food and indifferent servers. Too bad - they have a great location and downtown Hoboken needs more places for impressing visiting relatives.
2014-10-07,5,Steak and eggs, watermelon and goat cheese salad, gnocchi with ragu - all amazing! Super cute date spot and interesting menu without breaking the bank. Upstairs is nice too and on holidays like St. Party's or Halloween they throw good parties.
2014-09-26,3,3.5 stars. We got the mushroom and asparagus pizza for an app. That was pretty good but lacking some sauce. Then I ordered the eggplant, spinach, tomato, and fresh mozz Rigatoni and that was amazing. The sauce on it was addicting and everything was cooked perfectly. It was a huge portion and only $12! They also have half price drafts and house wine during happy hour so that was sweet. My bf got a different pasta with mushrooms and cream sauce for $25 that he wasn't wild about but I would definitely get my meal again!
2014-09-17,2,Started out well actually impressed by their selection.  Appetizers were on point except the guacamole app had chips that were pretty stale they should invest the little time needed to deep fry their own.  For some reason our entrees took an hour to get after asking to just have them wrapped took 30 min to get wrapped up even after the manager reassured us they were done and being wrapped 20 min ago.  Eating the meal at home things of course do not travel as well but I found my steak a bit salty and same was said by my friends who had other entrees.
2014-08-30,5,Great food, great environment, and the staff really knows what they are doing!
2014-08-25,3,My hubs ordered a steak lettuce wrap ($14) but they brought (and we got charged for) regular skirt steak($24).  He didn't realize it at first because there was some wilted greens underneath ... But it was covered under all these little french fries.  He was well halfway through before thinking it was the wrong order...he didn't want to bother at that point.For an app we got the hummus, but it would be so much better if they served it with warm pita as opposed to tortilla chips.  Chips are too salty to enjoy hummus.  I could tell the difference between the different hummus options because of the saltiness.  Please don't ruin a Mediterranean favorite with junk food.I had the Kobe slider trio and it was good, but in general, I wasn't jones-ing for anything on the menu.  The menu must have changed. I wish they had a better soup option than the French onion too.The waiter also brought out table bread and though it seemed they warmed it up, it had a stale/non-fresh taste to it.  I thougt this place use to give fresh bread - is that just upstairs.  Bleh.I always hope this place would be more of a farm-to-table (like Grammercy. Tavern) kind of place but it seems to be falling into more of a bar food, chips and fries style of place.After 2 sub-par visits here, I'm probably not going to come back for a long time, if at all.
2014-08-18,4,Good food, good service, but extremely loud for a restaurant. I have always had great meals here but have had to yell to the person next to me to have a conversation. Overall, a good place if you are not trying to have a quiet, intimate dinner.
2014-08-15,4,The drinks are fun and the service is great. Kristin is an awesome bartender. She made a great moonshine punch. She also made my first date much less awkward with her fun personality!
2014-08-09,5,Hands down best brunch in Hoboken.  Food - absolutely delicious not just your ordinary menu of eggs Benedict, pancakes or waffles.  The menu is always changing and every change is just more amazing food. You get a great amount of fantastic food for a great price and if you want bottomless drinks you have the option.  Service is great, you will never have an empty glass or go long without seeing your server.
2014-08-09,3,Friends insisted on dining here last night. Made the mistake of not making a reservation and waited more than 30 minutes for a table. But, we did request an upstairs table to cut down on the noise from the bar area. Window table was nice and provided a view of Washington Ave. I would recommend window tables upstairs if you are going here. Food was "ok" not anything great and I didn't expect it to be. Large menu with choices for everyone (pasta, meat, seafood, veggie). Appears more of an active bar scene than a restaurant. Nice wine list for dinner pairings.
2014-08-08,4,Awesome service. Was there in a party of 4, sat upstairs by the auxiliary bar of the restaurant. Would have asked to sit outside in the future. Had the steak and eggs. Very tasty but they sliced the petit filet, which I thought was unnecessary.  Great little spot but could step it up to compare to places in the city like Hotel Chantelle on Sunday Funday. A great Hoboken spot overall!
2014-08-07,2,So we went here because it's packed often...  usually the sign of a good place... well...  either people in Hoboken don't know what's good, everything else is that bad, they just have money to burn, or it's all their first times too.  This place was not good.  From the watermelon pepper tequila drink to the special beef with egg noodle to the overpriced beet and goat cheese salad that literally had such a small shmear of goat cheese on the bottom of the plate I couldn't see it or taste it to the $6 for 4 medium size tasteless grilled shrimp add on to the syrupy sweet coconut rice with the scallops.  Everything here food wise was all wrong.  The service was friendly otherwise they'd get one star.
2014-07-27,5,Classy restaurant with great food. Also the wait staff was great. I would definitely go there again.
2014-07-27,5,Amazing food, service and ambience.I had grilled Spanish octopus and it was just perfectly cooked.
2014-07-24,3,Came here for brunch last weekend. We had a GREAT server! He was funny and really made our dining experience enjoyable. The food took a little while to come out but it was a saturday afternoon so I understood. Unlimited sangria at a prefixed price. I would go back.
2014-07-22,2,Drinks were good and refreshing but I expected so much more from what others describe as "one of the classier spots on Washington."  We were greeted and seated promptly and while we were waiting for the rest of our group to arrive we ordered a few drinks and some guacamole.  The guac is served three ways which was interesting but unfortunatley it was not fresh.  It was far to smooth to be made in house.  2-3 Kobe sliders were over cooked and my chicken sandwich was cold and tiny.  The service was also very strange.  We actually thought our original server left midway through because he was so unattentive.  But then he reappeared at the end of the meal when we needed the bill.  I stop back for a drink but their are plenty of other "classy" spots where you can drop your dough in this town.
2014-07-12,1,This place is pretty awful. I ordered their prix-fixe lunch meal on a Saturday - some sort of melon yogurt salad and eggs benedict. Everything had a funky taste/smell to it. The melons seemed really old and were lukewarm. The eggs had a filmy plasticky taste and was inedible. We randomly walked in with some friends since there seemed to be a good number of patrons, however, walked away embarrassed that this was what they tasted in Hoboken. I will never eat here again.
2014-06-24,4,This is my go-to restaurant in Hoboken.  The atmosphere is more upscale than most of the other bars and restaurants downtown and the food is quite good.  We always sit downstairs where there is more of a bar vibe, but the upstairs room is good for more formal dinners, especially if you can get the round table that faces over Washington Street.I'm a big fan of the burger here, as well their pasta and seafood dishes.  Make sure to ask to hear the specials which are usually great as well.  Their beer selection is awesome.Only thing I would change is the bread they serve with the meal - normally seems a little stale and comes with this pesto-like dip which could be better.
2014-06-14,3,One of the best creme brulees I've tasted here; however,  the prices of the meals and drinks are too high for both its quality and quantity.
2014-06-08,5,Love the brass rail!! Food is good, especially the entrees. We have a go -to bartender, Joey. He's awesome. My boyfriend and I go here offer to either start our night or for a nightcap. The feel of the place is chill, you can hear yourself talk and they play good music in the background. Def check it out.
2014-06-05,2,The food is not that great and the service was very poor. Took 15 minutes just to get water and a menu. I understand I went on a brunch Sunday but that should tell the place to hire more servers. Drinks were good, that's what I will give stars to!
2014-05-26,2,This review is for Sunday Brunch -- I came here with my girlfriend and my father a couple weeks ago.  They have a special for $18 where you get to order an appetizer and an entree.  Seemed like a decent deal for Hoboken.  The waiter, Mick, comes over and I hate to be mean, but this guy had the personality of a rock.  He wouldnt even speak to us!  Just kept nodding and was acting so put off.  There were a couple salads on the appetizer menu, but nothing that was just plain greens.  My father has lost about 60 pounds in the past 3 years and he didn't want to order one of the specialty salads, so asked Mick if he could have just a bowl of greens instead.  Mick's response "If it's not on the menu, you can't have it."  Really?  You can't just put some lettuce on a plate?  We even told him look we will pay for it.  NOPE.  So my dad wound up paying for an $18 entree.  I asked the waiter, Mick, if the salad that said "grilled ceasar salad" was actually grilled chicken or to explain what that meant.  His reponse "umm, they grill it."  It was honestly comical, like I felt like I was on the show Boiling Point.  The only reason this place gets 2 stars from me is because the food was decent.  I had the steak and eggs.  However, I will definitely not be back and would not recommend it.  I will actually tell my friends to NOT go there.
2014-05-25,3,The food, drinks, and outdoor space is awesome here. Service was good and overall I had a good experience. The bill was just a bit shocking. For what I ordered it seems over priced. Other than that it's. Great place.
2014-05-25,4,Don't let the cold unfriendly hostess deter you. Great laid back place. Food is great. Service was good, especially for a Sunday brunch. Definitely will come back. Gazpacho and Cowboy Quiche are great!
2014-05-19,4,Hubby and I wandered into Hoboken this past Saturday - we never really come to Hoboken (we live about a half hour away), but after hitting the Brass Rail, we will definitely be back more often.  As craft beer lovers (and member of NJ Craft Beer club - check them out online - get your membership - you'll make back the money you spent on it after using the card just once!), we are always in search of new places.  It was Saturday night, about 9:00 - the bar was full, but there were some empty tables.  I think there is an upstairs, but we just stayed by the bar and ordered a couple beers (VERY nice craft beer selection ... AND wine on draft - we were chatting with the owner/manager later in the evening and asked how that went over and he said the customers love it - the wine stays fresh and 'carbonated'....better than if in a bottle - and we saw a few customers enjoying more than 1 glass while we there).  We showed our NJ Craft Beer card, and found out it our beers were half price!!  WOOOOO-freakin-HOOOOOO....sooo in love already!  And they had a DJ there who was AWESOME (he's there once a month).  This 40-something-year old lady was a happy camper - but the 'younger' crown was lovin the music too!  Lots of 80s (with some 80s fun rap - not the crap rap...  I was digging it!)   We just couldn't figure out why the place wasn't packed??  I guess for now, it'll be our little secret   :)
2014-05-15,5,Probably one of my favorite bars in Hoboken.  Mainly because of the bartenders, Lindsey and Joey, they are the best!  I've lived in Hoboken 2 1/2 years and outside of going to the city, probably come here the most, good drinks, good food and great bartenders!!
2014-05-14,4,My husband and I were walking down Washington Street in search of a place to get a few beers during Happy Hour.  The Brass Rail had a sign outside advertising for a Samuel Adams beer flight.  So, of course, we had to go inside.We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar.  They have a wonderful selection of craft beers.  He ordered his flight, and was pleased and I ordered my Yuengling.   (I'm a creature of habit, what can I say?)  While we were sitting there, a Samuel Adams representative (Alex) can over and started chatting us up.  Alex wanted to get my husband's opinion on the 3 Sam Adams beers.  He even bought our next round.  Thanks Alex and Sam Adams!I decided to venture outside of my comfort zone and try Pranqster (Belgium Style Golden Ale).  It was pretty good.  My husband ordered the Sam Adams Porch Rocker.Lindsey (the bartender and sommelier) was really nice and friendly.  We already had dinner plans, so we didn't try the food.  We will have to come back again, as the food looked good.
2014-05-12,3,WAY WAY overpriced for what you get but probably also some of the better tasting food in Hoboken.  They also have a great beer selection.  Despite the prices, I still make this my regular place when I come to Hoboken.
2014-05-05,3,This is a review of the Sunday brunch only.  I have lived in Hoboken for a little over a year and always see this place packed every weekend so I decided to finally try it out. I was able to easily make a reservation the day before and was promptly seated upon arrival. There are two brunch options. You can get an appetizer and entree for 18 or make it an all you can drink (mimosa, Bloody Mary, red sangria, and beer) for 28. Btw this is notably one of the only places that I have seen serve all you can drink sangria so I was pleasantly surprised. Food: We ordered the Caesar salad and eggs Benedict. Both dishes were delicious and had very simple presentations. The mimosas, Bloody Mary, and sangria were premixed. I found the sangria to be a bit watered down. Meanwhile the mimosas were pretty standard. Ambience: considering it was a pretty chilly day the place was still pretty packed. There is a nice outdoor seating area which is great during the summer. The restaurant has two floors. I came here With a friend and it was a bit hard to hold a conversation as the music was relatively loud on the main floor. There were a number of large groups that came in for a brunch which definitely added to the volume. Having said that I would still recommend this place to a friend but would suggest that it's better for a group of people rather than a pair. Service: We expected to have a wait however found it a little frustrating to have to ask for a refill of our drinks several times before receiving them. We were told that the kitchen was a backed up however still didn't have much of a wait for the food. It was nice to have two meals (app and entree) rather than just one and made waiting for the main course much easier. Overall I will definitely be back. This is a great place in Hoboken to come to once the weather gets nice to sit outside. The two course meal lets you relax and drink for longer than you normally would. The only con I found was the relatively slow service and somewhat watered down sangria. If you have some time to spend and aren't afraid to ask for another drink then you should definitely try this place out.
2014-04-16,5,Brunch at The Brass Rail is really amazing. I got great service and a great deal. I never felt rushed, the food was delicious and the refill on drinks was always on point.
2014-04-14,5,The Brass Rail is a great venue. The cuisine is impeccable and always fresh. Moreover, the service is best in class. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially the seafood dishes, notwithstanding the filet mignon that is to die for!!! It's a special Hoboken place you must visit!!!!
2014-04-07,4,love their food! use to live across the street and always a great too for a quick burger (turkey burger the best) or salad (iceberg wedge)!  brunch is awesome!
2014-03-30,5,This is the first review I have ever written. I stopped into The Brass Rail and was amazed at the menus for both food and cocktails. My wife and I sat at the bar and were immediately made to feel comfortable and unrushed. Joe, the bartender, was very friendly and personable, and ,made the best margarita I have ever had, and I am a huge margarita fan. I also had the Tres Chiles, which is made mostly with peppers and I was blown away, especially since I hate peppers. We ordered the truffle meatballs and gnocchi and it was lick the plate amazing. It was so good we went back for the Sunday brunch. I had the Crepes and Steak and Eggs and it was great, I really cant say enough good things about this place. We cant wait to go back to Hoboken because we will be making The brass Rail our first stop.
2014-03-24,5,Best bottom-less brunch around. Lovely way to spend a Saturday or Sunday morning/afternoon. Service was great, food good and drinks endless.
2014-03-15,5,Even though I pass through Hoboken daily, I rarely frequent it for anything other than a bagel for breakie, or my Cuban fix from La Isla. On the real, Hoboken is just not my scene. On two random occasions, I have found myself dining at The Brass Rail. Both times the food was really damn good. But what stuck out to me the most on both visits was the personable, attentive service BY ALL. From the doorman tonight, to the bartender, and our actual waitress; as well as the hostess on my first visit, and the waiter we had that time. All around on two separate occasions, first time being a weekday evening, and this time on a bustling Saturday night, service was on point. Without hesitation, Brass Rail is for sure a place, probably the only place, I would recommend when someone is looking for a casual yet "upscale" by means of food offerings for a "bar" in Hoboken.
2014-03-13,3,The service isn't very good most of the time. The servers sort of seem like they're too cool to be servers or something. BUT the cocktails are really good, and I highly recommend the fish tacos! There usually isn't a very long wait either, so it's a great spot to hop in and out of for a couple drinks, and it's great to sit outside when it's warm.
2014-03-10,4,If you are looking for a great burger in a relaxed but nice atmosphere this is the place. Along with an extensive beer list and some of the best and interesting appetizers The Brass Rail offers some of the best domestic cuisine in the area and the cheese plates are nothing short of incredible.
2014-02-18,3,**Editing my review to add additional star. The owner took the time to reach out to me about my latest experience which was commendable and courteous. He corrected the information that our server gave us about the Chef. While there is a new chef, the original one Chef Doug is still the culinary director for the restaurant. Not sure what role that plays exactly but they offered to set everything right on our next visit**Beware - disappointing new chef.Went with the wife for Valentine's day. I was not aware the chef of many years was no longer there until I'd asked for my steak to be prepared au poivre. The last chef always did it no questions asked and it was phenomenal. The new chef flat out refused, I believe my servers words were, "He said sorry, no changes allowed whatsoever". The steak was au jus (ie. BORING) and, while cooked properly in the middle, both my wife's and mine were charred on the outside. The accompanying potato lyonaisse were dry and hard, we literally took one bite and pushed them aside. Matter of fact, since our steaks were so disappointing we had them wrapped to go nearly whole and weren't even asked why. We fed the steaks to our dogs :-/  Now we don't plan to eat there anymore, we'll likely try again if we see a new chef at the helm. It's sad as I really liked the old one.Now, for a quick pro/con breakdown:Pros:Good selection of beers on tap and in bottles, friendly/good bar tenders and servers, decent prices, decent looking interior, not so hard to get a table or seat, outside seating during warm seasons.Cons:New chef, quite noisy on lower level, beer glasses often not cleaned well.
2014-02-11,3,Saturday Brunch review. The upstairs dining room at the Brass Rail when i was there was undoubtedly the most rawkus crowd i've ever encountered..albeit less fun. They need to pump in some music or something because it was just piercing,  shrill, wasted women screeching over one another.But the food was generally good. We were a group of 4 and everyone liked what they had. The only disappointment was the fruit salad. It was sliced apple and pear with a dollop of yogurt.. nothing more. French toast and omelettes were solid. The service was understandably on the slow side given the ridiculousness, but our waiter was just fine.
2014-01-04,5,I recently went here for brunch, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It's a great deal ($18 for an app and brunch entree, $28 to add unlimited brunch cocktails while dining). Our server was fantastic, very accommodating and ready to answer any question we had. I also enjoyed the selection of food that was offered. It ranges from sweet to savory, healthy to fat kid (I went toward fat kid, because why not?). I started with hummus and bagel chips which were simple and satisfying and finished with the green chicken enchilada. My friend had the quiche with bacon, bourbon, and sriracha, which I had half of, and it was also delicious. It's definitely a fun little brunch spot to hit while in Hoboken and definitely one of the best deals. I'll go back!
2014-01-03,3,Let me start with saying that I love this place as a bar -- it has a great selection, awesome service, and a very cool atmosphere. At the bar, I've ordered the calamari, and it was good, not great.  I recently went here for brunch and was thoroughly underwhelmed. The food was not bad necessarily, but no one in our party left talking about it being good - it was totally meh. I really wanted this place to be good at everything but have come to realize that its just a good bar, and thats ok.
2013-12-22,3,I just had Sunday brunch with a couple friends. For $28 it wasn't a bad deal. You get an app and main course with choice of mimosa, Bellini or bloody Mary's. It's not a true all you can drink but as long as you have food in front of you they're pretty good about refills. I ordered a Caesar salad and the steak and eggs. It's a pretty standard brunch menu. I've eaten here before and have never been disappointed with the food.
2013-12-06,4,Garlic Rubbed Skirt Steak and The FishTacos were both great, as was the service and atmosphere.
2013-12-05,3,This is a place that you truly want to like, but can't. The ambiance, service, beer & wine selection is very good. Heck, even the bread they give out at the beginning is delicious. The problem is the food -- it just sucks. I had the gnocchi with veal meatball and it was almost near disgusting. It was also $20 and gave me the worst gas at 4am the night after I ate it.I will say that it is POSSIBLE to have a decent meal here, but I'd go with something simple as opposed to complicated. I never had dessert here. I could see that being good also.I would say worth it for drinks, definitely not for the food. During the summer they definitely don't have enough staff onboard to cover the outdoor and indoor areas. That can be a problem when requesting refills.
2013-11-14,5,A complete and total 180. Almost a year ago, I lambasted The Brass Rail for their food, as everything we tried that night was an unqualified disaster. However, being as introspective as I like to think I am, I like to think I can admit when I'm wrong - not that the food wasn't terrible that night long ago, just that we probably went on a bad night. Nonetheless, we returned to the scene of the crime tonight and, to their credit, everything was terrific. Service was great. Management was tip-top and the food was some of the best I've had in 'boken. The Wasabi Shrimp appetizer is hands-down the best appetizer in town. Skirt steak was perfect and creme brulee as well. Also, the pesto that comes w/ the bread is kick-ass. Could eat that by itself. They should put it on pasta.  Live and learn. Will be going back mas times. :)
2013-11-04,1,My friend and I decided to try a new place for brunch on Sunday.  I had heard about how great the Brass Rail was supposed to be for brunch; as well as the great "deal" you get for $28.The biggest problem with this restaurant, as well as why I will not go out of my way to visit again, has to do with the service.  Our waiter had the worst attitude problem imaginable.  Servers tips are based on the service they provide the customer.  We could not believe how rude he was being.  The meal itself was not horrible, but also not memorable.  With so many options for brunch in Hoboken, I believe this establishment should make more of an effort to treat their customers better.
2013-11-03,4,I had brunch here with my boyfriend and his mother, and it was very good. Couple of hiccups in the service, but it was crowded, and we had plenty of time, so I can't complain. We were seated in the second floor area, which is much classier and quieter than the bar downstairs. I ordered my usual brunch favorites: a Caesar salad and grilled salmon with roasted vegetables. This may be the only place that recommends ordering salmon medium rare, as their salmon is sushi-grade. As always, my dishes did not disappoint. The Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, with light shavings of Parmesan cheese. And the salmon was cooked perfectly and had a sweet buttery texture. The veggies were good too, although they slightly burnt the artichoke. My boyfriend was not thrilled with his meal, sadly. He ordered French toast with fruit compote, and he called it "underwhelming". I didn't try any, but I'm fairly certain he wasn't keen on his dish because he was getting over a cold and his taste buds weren't exactly up to par yet. His mom loved the mushroom and cheese omelette though.Word of caution to any potential patrons: don't come to The Brass Rail for a quick bite if you're running low on time. This place caters to those who linger over their food, so allow yourself enough time to sit, eat, and digest.
2013-11-01,1,Let me first say that their food is actually decent.  I've had my wife's birthday here in the past and it was fine.However, when it comes to customer service the Brass Rail gets a big Brass Fail.  Just recently I called about an order I placed for delivery and was put on hold by the manager (Dave) for a solid 5 minutes.  The next person who picked up was a short order cook who proceeded to curse me out for no real reason.Bottom line is that this place is poorly run.  If you order from here expect long delays.  If you have a problem with that, expect to deal with a rude staff who have no idea how to speak to a customer.
2013-09-30,1,I tried their duck entree tonight and was very disappointed. Although it was over cooked, the duck itself was passable....the problem is the awful brown gravy that smothered it! eek. They put cherries in the sauce as an after thought. Their "jasmine rice" was soggy, bland and overcooked. They threw in some other items into the rice...again as an after thought... which didn't do anything to help it....and sadly, the dish took over 30 mins to arrive. Bland and Tasteless. Not even close. I've tried this restaurant a few times hoping it would redeem itself...but never again. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
2013-09-29,1,One star: Too expensive for mediocre food and a mouse in the dining room. Drinks (ruby red martini) and service were great!My husband and I went here for dinner on friday night (9/27) after work.  The service was really good.  The man who sat us even carried my shopping bag up the stairs.  Our server was great, our food and drinks were out quickly.  The bread pieces that they served to our table were delicious.  My drink was very good and VERY strong.  We ordered the broiled oysters.  In two of the oysters I bit into large pieces of shell (I thought I broke my tooth).I ordered the special, venison with spinach and a type of potato.  I ordered the medallions medium rare (as the waiter suggested) and it was way over cooked.  I could almost not cut it with my steak knife.  Husband got the spare ribs which were good but nothing great.  I think I would have been more happy with the meal if our bill had not been almost $200.  I think our drinks were probably $50 of that.  For that price, the food should be amazing.  Everything was just ok, we also had dessert which was good, not great.  Then as we were finishing up we noticed a mouse run across the floor.  We were on the second floor of the restaurant for reference.  I live in the city, I understand that this can be an issue, but I don't want to see them and certainly not on the second floor of the restaurant.  We didn't say anything about it to the staff until the second time it came over to our table.  It was completely unafraid of us.  We quietly called the bus boy over and told him.  We were very quite as to not bother the other guests.  We told our waiter we wanted our bill and we were going to leave (not upset, just did not want to be there anymore).  He never offered to get the manager or make the situation right.  We then went to leave and a woman also asked if everything was ok.  We then told her and again, it was as if they knew this was an issue and were ok with it.  They both offered apology but nothing more.  It would have been nice to offer us a drink or something, anything.Too expensive for mediocre food and mice in the dining room.  We will not be going back.
2013-09-04,1,Went to have dinner on Wednesday night with my two friends. This place gets #1 place in my list of bad restaurants. Food was disgusting. I ordered filet mignon  and I think meat gone bad and after that they cooked it, cuz it smelled like garbage. Ribs were super dry and had the same sauce as filet. So far, the worst place I ever been to. We couldn't eat any of the food we ordered.
2013-08-28,1,We recently decided to stop at the Brass Rail for happy hour. The restaurant looks appealing, and it seemed like the perfect day to sit on their patio. Our first drink came and was great. We ordered a second round of wine, along with a cheese plate. Most of the cheese on the menu wasn't in stock, so we chose at random. When my wine came, it tasted completely different from my first glass. The waiter assured me it was the same Pinot Grigio, just from a new bottle. I knew otherwise, but rather then be a bother I decided just to drink it. When the cheese plate came, it was a complete disappointment. Not well presented and such a small portion. We decided to try the French onion soup, and ordered one last glass of wine each. When my wine came, it was the correct type this time, confirming what I had suggested to the waiter previously about him bringing the wrong blend last glass. Finally the French onion soup. Terrible. One bite was enough. What was most frustrating for us, is that we had two different waiters, both whom were inattentive.  It took the waiter 15 mins to ask us how our soup was. No manager came to apologize for us sending it back. Needless to say, no tip was left and we will not be returning to the Brass Rail. There are too many other restaurants we'd rather give our business to in Hoboken.
2013-08-14,4,Great brunch had the French onion soup and burger. The soup was a little sweet but I enjoyed it. If u get the unlimited drinks deal they stop serving you once your food I'd done so hold onto your plate.
2013-08-04,3,Nice ambience. Good crowd. Food was very crafty but tasted great. Drinks were strong. Servers very friendly and helpful. Fun place to hangout but slightly pricy.
2013-08-02,1,Well I eat out in Hoboken frequently and have my go to restaurants where I know I won't be disappointed. I figured since it's Hudson Restaurant Week what better way to introduce myself to a new restaurant and add another to my list. Boy, What a mistake! Granted I know it's a prix fixe menu and they are very busy but to wait over an hour and 15 min for my entree was unacceptable. My waiter was not helpful at all and we waited nearly 20 min for our drinks. I proceeded to order the Salmon dish which I asked how he recommended it cooked and he told me medium. I don't eat too much fish so I didn't know that my salmon would come out basically raw like sushi. I asked the waiter why it wasn't cooked through and he told me that is how they prepare the dish. Almost like a sushi dish. He then told me he should've told me that when I ORDERED. Not for nothing, but if it is my first time there and If I ask him how he recommends a dish it should be told to me BEFORE I order it not after. Why should I have him take it back if I will have to wait another 30-45 min for the dish to get back to me? While my wife is finishing dessert I would have just received my dish. Granted, it's the start of Hudson Restaurant Week but that doesn't mean that the dishes should be of a lower standard. I made them take it back and didn't order anything else. I then asked for the manager to voice my displeasure but that didn't do anything at all. He said that I should have ordered pan fried and not medium. I continued to let him know that I wasn't informed of how medium would come out and he said that is how they cook it there. He didn't offer any solutions to my complaint. THANKED ME FOR MY FEEDBACK and suggested me to come back and try them again. That's it?? That's all that the MANAGER could do. He could've taken out a drink since we paid over $95 for my wife's food and my drink. So my night out at Fabulous Brass Rail consisted of a drink I waited 20 mins for, a raw, undercooked and unsatisfied piece of salmon, and the dessert I just didn't want. What for? IT COULD HAVE GOTTEN WORSE!! I love eating out and trying new restaurants but the standards are not only about the food but the experience. If I have a great experience I wouldn't mind going back every week to enjoy myself and the service. I wouldn't mind spending more for a meal if the experience is unmatched. I am there not only to eat but to enjoy my company, food, and have a lasting memory that I can tell my friends, coworkers and family about. The server, food, and manager left a lot to be desired. I thought maybe the manager would offer some sort of damage control but he only furthered to damage my experience at the Brass Rail in Hoboken, NJ. I wouldn't recommend eating here if you are looking for a dining experience. There are a lot of other top quality service oriented restaurants in town. So if you happened to walk by the Brass Rail and think about going in just take a breath, count to 10 and keep walking. Don't worry you aren't missing much.
2013-07-31,3,I would have given the Brass Rail 4 stars since their food is so good, but the service was horrible. We went there last night for Hudson Restaurant Week and upon arriving we had to wait for the hostess to greet us. It took her 10 minutes. No one was manning the front of the house and they definitely lost customers due to it. That was our first indication that service was going to be slow. We wanted to sit outside and noticed that a table was available, it just needed to be cleaned. It took another 15 minutes for them to clean the table off. We decided to have a drink at the bar. Well, service at the bar was extremely slow as well. To keep with the gist of the story, our service was slow once we were seated. The only reason I'm not fully blasting off is because the food was phenomenal! I would endure the slow service all over again just to experience the amazingness that is the Brass Rail. I started off with the mussels, they were SO good. The sauce they use for them is pure goodness. Next, I had the chicken with rigatoni. I wasn't really a fan of my chicken, I found it to be too chewy but the eggplant and tomatoes that accompany the dish were great. Finally, I had the chocolate mousse for desert. I had to remind myself that it wasn't proper to pick the dish up and lick it. It was so good, I could have eaten 6 of them! So the moral of the story is this: The Brass Rail has amazing food, but you're going to be there for over 2 hours to enjoy it.
