Marc Bee, 2 days ago, 2, 'Food is fine, but it is NOT dim sum. Also, it’s pricy. Decor is very nice.'
Rachael Rohrig, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'This place is fantastic!! We hosted my sister’s baby shower here and had the whole place to ourselves which was wonderful. It is BYOB but their mocktails are so so good and you can always bring your own alcohol to make it a cocktail. All of the food was incredible: ham egg and cheese bao buns, lox and cream cheese tea sandwiches, French toast, dumplings… all amazing! Highly recommend for any meal or an event!'
Dana Hansen, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'Have been wanting to try this place for a while and so happy we did! All of the food we tried was delicious. Our favorite was the General Tso Broccoli appetizer, but we also ordered the fried chicken bao, the general tso chicken dumplings, and the sesame chicken lo mein. Besides the delicious food, the ambiance and decorations were beautiful. The staff and service was very good as well. Would definitely recommend to others & go back!'
Stephanie Vehon, 2 weeks ago, 3, 'We were excited to try this place and ended up disappointed. Some dishes such as the avocado roles and the coconut as crab rice lacked flavor.\nThe shrimp buns and soup dumplings were excellent. Thus the food is hit or miss.\n\nFurthermore, we were frustrated with the lack of service. When we asked for'
Ola Nesgovorov, 2 weeks ago, 5, "Very nice staff, the food is ready super fast & it's very tasty.\nIt's a fusion between American & thai style from what I tasted.\nLot's of greens & ginger notes.\nI ordered the brunch omelette with sausage on the side, it was very flavourful ,and the portion is more than enough ."
Michael Song, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'Honey chicken bao bun with kimchi, ube and begetarian dumplings were very good.  The ambiance and staff were amazing as well.  Will come here often.'
Ming Jia, 3 weeks ago, 1, 'What makes non-Asian people think they can open an overpriced, mediocre dim sum place right next to an existing dim sum restaurant owned by people making authentic cuisine?'
Steven Lowell, a month ago, 5, "I went over to Hoboken via ferry from Manhattan to see a good friend of mine, who recommended this place. I absolutely loved it! Here's why!\n\n1. The Basil Lemonade was incredible and so was the virgin bloody mary.\n\n2. We had an incredible brunch and some of the freshest tasting pastries I have had in a long time.\n\n3. Our waiter was a friendly young guy named TJ. He agreed to tell the chef to come out so we can tell him how much we liked the food.\n\nThe chef is this young, talented guy named Anthony Leonido who works at & partners with 4 other restaurants. Super friendly and willing to talk to us about the food he enjoys making.\n\nSunday Brunch ended about 3pm and they shut down for 2 hours and reopened for dinner at 5pm.\n\nIf you are just checking out the area or live in Hoboken, I recommend this place because the chef is talented and seems very creative, too. He's going places! :)"
Tae Kim, 2 months ago, 1, 'This is my first 1 star review. I went for brunch, but it feels like I had an early dinner. All servers ignored me to order food, so It took 15 minutes to order the food, and although there were not many people, I waited almost an hour for the food to come out. All the tables around me complained about the late food coming out, but it was just an excuse without a word of apology.\nIn addition, the bar code is required to view the menu, but the actual price of the food was higher than that. After compiling, manager showed me the paper menu and made an excuse that the menu price on the Internet was wrong.\nAlso, if you look closely at Bill, if you pay with a credit card, a 3% fee is unilaterally made to the customer.\nA place I never want to visit again.'
Beverly Brown, 2 months ago, 1, 'Tragically this Dim Sum restaurant does not serve Dim Sum in the day time! The name of the restaurant is the English translation of Dim Sum, which is traditionally served as breakfast or brunch.  Instead, they only serve a standard American brunch in the day time, which you can get anywhere. Typically Hoboken in that the facade looks great but the actual place has some ridiculous and disappointing  suburban twist. Food looks good, but I will just head to much less expensive  place with excellent fare served at the traditional time.'
Max Nozewski, 2 months ago, 5, 'Amazing food. Great service.'
Nicholas Gkionis, 2 months ago, 5, 'This place is one of the best restaurants in Hoboken. The decor is beautiful and makes it perfect for a date night or dinner with friends. The food is served tapas style with american-chinese fare.  I liked the dumplings, bao’s, and the entrees. It is byob too which is always solid. Really really good. I highly recommend!'
Chloe Bergman-Ray, 3 months ago, 4, 'We had a good experience at Touch the Heart! The service was friendly and attentive, and the food was overall quite good. Its also BYOB, would recommend!'
Devin Seep, 3 months ago, 5, 'A unique cuisine restaurant to try if you’re ever in Hoboken. The food comes in a well balanced portion and is tasty as it sounds. If you’re a fan of buns as your appetizer try the hot honey chicken with kimchi on a bun it is very good! The American mix with Asian cuisine was a bit different but worth a try!'
Jessica P., 3 months ago, 5, "We've had two great experiences at Touch the Heart!  The food is so delicious, comes out very fast, and is great to share.  The staff was kind and prompt.  The BBQ pork bao buns are our favorite!  Looking forward to going again."
Victoria Verdel, 3 months ago, 5, 'Great little place. Food was super yummy and came out quickly. Service was wonderful. Will be back for sure.'
chuck fitz, 3 months ago, 2, 'Food is great. Service is pitiful. How many times will you walk right by our table of four? Without even giving us a glance Chloe? 8pm. No dinner order yet. People we walked in with have their check and are paying.'

Jay Chua, 4 months ago, 2, 'Wasn’t impressed - thought it would be given the decor and ambiance but the food disappointed and the wait times were way too long… perhaps teething problems as they navigate routines at the beginning'
Routie Assirbad, 5 months ago, 1, 'Horrible service, slow and surf and turf today was soggy with too much eggs. Staff is unfriendly and food is not that great. Waiter forgot to bring out appetizer and then when we are leaving forced us to take it home and pay for it after we refused it. Horrible place. Management needs to train these employees to do a better job.'
Katie N, 5 months ago, 5, 'Went here on a rainy Saturday afternoon and this place was amazing. Service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable on the dishes, and orders came out at the perfect time. The food was delicious- our favorite was the flower tea and buns. I will definitely be back!'
willzy34, 5 months ago, 5, 'Best fried rice I ever had.  Delicious mocktails are even better if you hand them a bottle of your favorite spirit to add to the drinks.'
Samantha Casternovia, 5 months ago, 5, 'The cutest place in Hoboken! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is beautiful.  Wasabi sweet potato dumplings alone are enough to have me coming back regularly. Look forward to them expanding into brunch! I only wish they had a sign so I would have gone in sooner :). Also please add vegan items so i can bring my friends!\nBut still 10/10'
Kesavan Menon, 6 months ago, 5, 'Fantastic food. Especially liked the Cheeseburger Dumplings but everything was great'
I And, 6 months ago, 5, 'Went there with my girlfriend and we shared the avocado egg rolls, the fried plantain dumplings, the California roll, and the tofu bao buns. Everything was delicious and fresh tasting especially that California roll. The service was friendly and the ambiance inside was cute, perfect for a quiet date night. Plenty of vegetarian options as well.'

Justin Grzeszczak, 7 months ago, 4, 'Great little spot in Hoboken. BYOB. The menu is shareable plates. The Bao Buns were really good.\n\nPlant vibes inside and some outdoor seating as well. A must try for small groups!'
Allison, 7 months ago, 5, 'I love this place! Very cute chill garden vibes, food was very good and so was the service. It’s also not as well known so typically can find a table right away. I love that they are BYOB and make drinks with mock tails, the tea selection is also unique. Positive experience and would recommend!'

Dhananjay Salgaocar, 11 months ago, 3, "Food was okay not great. The fusion concept didn't work for a lot of the dishes. Portions are measly, even for dishes with not so premium meat."

Megan Gillen, a year ago, 4, 'Went here for dinner and enjoyed it! Definitely a modern/fusion Asian American place but I liked the food. Most notable was their take on soup dumplings- the broth was served in a shot glass! The overall atmosphere and aesthetic is also very instagrammable, complete with a plants lining the walls and also available to purchase.'

Sunpyo Hong, a year ago, 1, 'Definitely disappointing. The food is not Chinese-American. Flavors are for people that are uncomfortable trying new things. Portion sizes are laughable for the price you pay. Would not recommend.'
Lyla Mannoia, a year ago, 5, 'I went with a handful of friends, we brought our own wine and we just ordered a variety of things from the menu. The five of us sat outside under the canopy and the lighting, table setting and ambiance was so pretty.\n\nI am still thinking of the delicious lotus roots and green beans that we had! The shrimp spring rolls were good. The eggplant lo mein was delicious. I loved that there were a number of vegetarian options and the dishes were made to share. I wish I had taken pictures of the dishes, but when they came out they looked so yummy that we all just dug right in. 😬\n\nCan’t wait to go back and try the rest of their menu items! They were out of the bok choy, but I’ll be back for those! We had a great time! Thank you!'

Liza Gomelski, a year ago, 3, 'I couldn’t give a 2.5 so I’m giving a 3. Honestly, I didn’t hate anything, but I didn’t really like anything either. We were seated outside on the far end near the frame shop and no one came to take our order for what felt like substantial amount of time. That being said, our waitress was very nice and apologetic. She really was not the problem. We arrived at 7:50 put our order in around 8’ish, our first  dish (spicy, raw, cucumbers) didn’t come out until 9.\n\nIt is BYOB with option to use their mixes. We brought tequila and used their “just add tequila” mix. I liked it, subtle flavor, my boyfriend did not like it at all. I think a bit steep for $8/glass for my own tequila.\n\nWe ordered: spicy cucumber, Bok Choy, Dan Dan noodles (the noodles were not noodles and in fact 1.5” long “noodles”. The way you cut up food for your toddler and difficult to eat with a chopstick or fork), the fried chicken boa (which was the best thing), and soup dumplings.\n\nThis place is brand new and I understand that every restaurant needs to work out its kinks. I will try It again in the future but was extremely unsatisfied with the timing and flavor of food. Did not leave a good first impression. I hope management can work out the timing from the kitchen.'
