Vanessa, 8 months ago, 1, 'If you see a line outside the place just leave. Two large crowds asked for a guy named ‚ÄúJimmy‚Äù and they were able to cut a whole line of people that had been waiting for a while outside in this cold weather. It‚Äôs filled with a bunch of millennials who are so immature. I understand that if you know ‚Äúpeople‚Äù your able to get in a few places without having to wait in line. But they let a crowd in where a girl had thrown a bottle at another female that was in line whom was just simply stating that it wasn‚Äôt fair that other people just get in while other people had been waiting for a while. Terrible experience while waiting to get inside the bar.'

I liked the fact that it wasn't overcrowded and my hubby gave me an anniversary surprise here and we could play games and drink at our leisure during happy hours. Not a bad place for a group with friends kinda get together!"

The various games allow for a cool night of drinking and fun in the comfort of this wonderful environment. If you want to grab drinks with some friends and enjoy a great night, the Shannon is your bar.'

Prateek Malhotra, 3 years ago, 2, "DJ was not to my liking. Seemingly picking random songs to play at full length while rotating through many others at 5-10 seconds a clip, really frustrating. Would also make announcements at the worst part, like right before the chorous or before a drop. Crowd is about what you'd expect for Hoboken, though not terribly rowdy."

Michael Godeanu, 3 years ago, 5, "One of my favorite spots to go to on the weekends. Good music in both the hip-hop and edc realms, there isn't a tremendous wait to get in compared to other places in Hoboken, the bartenders are fast and knowledgeable in mixology, big dance floor, and friendly security.  It's even fun during the week because they have games such as giant jenga, cornhole, darts, pool, and beer pong set up to have fun with your friends.  Strongly recommend visiting!"

Dominyka Stockunaite, 4 years ago, 1, 'I apologize for the one star, however, this isn‚Äôt a bar that I will be coming back to. It has happened 2 times now... I used to love this bar and the bar games and thought it would be fun to bring a group of friends with me. I came with a group of about 10 people so we could play and enjoy ourselves ON MY BIRTHDAY! We ordered beer for the beer pong game and got thrown out because we ‚ÄúDID NOT TIP ENOUGH‚Äù for the beer pong. Like are you guys kidding me? I have so many people with me and we are all getting mixed drinks on top of the beer pong each of us throwing tips at you guys on every charge. We calculated that we dropped almost an extra $50 dollars on tips alone before we purchased the beer pong. I‚Äôm making you business and your staff is still somehow unsatisfied? All he had to do was pull a lever for the beer I‚Äôm sorry 3 dollars in tips was not enough for that. This bar likes to randomly charge a cover fee so I would always call ahead of time or just simply don‚Äôt go because aside from the lovely big bouncer guys, the bartenders are absolute trash.'

Haddie Shah, 4 years ago, 5, "Literally the only bar I go to. Honestly, I always had horrible experiences at bars in Hoboken. The Shannon is a gem in a city filled with rocks, seriously! And the bartender Mike is their Diamond! Extremely fair prices, large drinks, and the BEST attitude. Mike knows how to make you feel right at home and never makes you wait for your next drink! He's genuine and makes all his drinks with a little extra love. Needless to say, the rest of the bartenders are ridiculously sweet as well. I went from dreading drinking at bars to becoming a regular! I would highly recommend the Shannon to everyone but especially to those that want to be able to go to a place with a friendly atmosphere where you're never ignored!"
Nando Gomez, 4 years ago, 1, "This is the worst bar i have attended the bartenders are straight racist and rude. We asked if there was any special and mike the bartender said no so we bought 2 coronas for 14$ when there was in fact a special bucket of 5 for 17$ i wouldn't recommend anyone going here after viewing other reviews I see that they treat people like animals."

Manuel Morgan, 4 years ago, 1, 'Honestly, the Shannon and their pre-civil rights mentality don\'t deserve 1 star. They are plain and simple RACIST, I don\'t use that lightly. I was the only POC (black and Hispanic) in the place. After buying about 90$ in libations, we moved to the "Sports Bars" viewing area to watch the Pacqaio fight...a non pay per view fight mind you . Two minutes later the blonde bartender (7/1 ) singles me out , in a group of 15-20 folks... Accusing me of loitering.\n\nShe then talked to multiple bouncers and asked for us to validate whether we purchased anything. After the bartender in the back confirmed exactly what we said. The racist bartendar didn\'t like being wrong, she then threw a fit to another "manager", who then removed us from the bar. Offering a standard answer around occupancy ... The place was empty!\n\nTL,DR: Racist, Dirty, Scum.'
Caitlin D'Angelo, 4 years ago, 1, 'Well, if you enjoy incredibly rude bartenders and watered down drinks go ahead and see Mike at the Shannon in Hoboken. We were told we we stiffing him "all night" aka an hour and a half, 1 drink each. I had his tip in my hand as I was trying to buy a pitcher of sangria, and we all planned to give him his tip at the end of the night. Not to mention he told us he didn\'t need our patronage. "We don\'t need you anyway" after we had all intentions of buying many more drinks. The bouncer is the only reason to go to this bar, he was lovely.'

I dont think they have food but they have great drinks and friendly staff. Theres always a funny conversation going on outside with the cigar/cigarette smokers. The bouncers cool if youre not asking for trouble and the music is diverse. Dont stand next to the bench across the street from the bar tho.'

Kadeem Webb, 4 years ago, 1, 'Once again stay away from this place if you are African american lol I have never been bounced out of a club back in North Carolina. Every time I go here the bartender begs for tips. He got me bounced out of here which is cool lol I did not mind being that there is other spots to go to. All in all avoid this place unless you are with a group of your white friends. its funny one time I was leaving here and I mentioned something about ti being too white and the bouncer made the same remark. If you do not want to end up in jail for no reason avoid this place at all costs and go to tally ho black bear or any of the other places. Also if you are gay I would not recommend this place either. they also discriminate against gays. I can see the Shannon changing management sooner or later. They also charge a cover on the weekends and when you get inside there is no one lol. my advice go here if you want to shoot pool and LEAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE afterwards lol'

I've seen a gay couple get rejected by the bouncers, sometimes the bouncers are very rude, the line is just ridiculous to get inside and if it is 2:00AM and you've been in line for so long, they won't let you in at all. The bar is okay, it really isn't that great and the drinks are somewhat okay. To be honest don't waste your time getting on the long line, if it's 8 people short then it's worth it."
