mymunimobile, 2 weeks ago, 1, "ordered here for the first time and was excited to try. long story short the food delivered was nothing i ordered. Im pretty sure it could have been someone elses order. But anywho, when i called to have it fixed, they really did not care, were not apologetic and blamed the driver for them giving him the wrong order. They didn't even want to fix it. so now im stuck with food i dont even want and now had to go through the trouble of finding another place to order from. c'mon really."

Starlin Burgos, 3 years ago, 2, "I gave the cashier a compliment about how quick my food was cooked and he answered that HE CAN TAKE IT BACK IF I DIDN'T WANT MY FOOD. I asked why is he saying that and he said that I was complaining. I told him that it was a compliment and and not a complaint. I've been in this place before and received a great service. First time I see this person working here."

loy, 5 years ago, 5, 'I live across the street and this is my daily deli and grocery store. The five star is based on the following facts:\n\n1. It has a wide variety of choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner, including sandwiches, omelette, salad and etc. The price is very reasonable.\n\n2. Very convenient for daily grocery, including fresh veg and coffee.\n\n3. Always friendly. For a couple of times when I was at work, I have package requiring signature. I ask little market to receive it for me. They gladly did it free of charge.'

John J, 7 years ago, 5, 'Always a smile. Quality, healthy products and with prices that give supermarkets a run for their money'
Nicky Hobbs, 8 years ago, 5, 'One of the best convenience stores in Hoboken. Sam and John who work there are great and they have way more than just the ordinary stuff. Lots of fresh products and the prepared foods are really good too. Parking in the "strip mall" parking lot makes this place even more appealing.'
