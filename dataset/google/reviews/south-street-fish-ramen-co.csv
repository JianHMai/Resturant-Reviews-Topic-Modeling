Tran Thai, 11 months ago, 1, "The service was extremely terrible, I have never experienced anything like this before. When we got to the place, we were rudely told by the employee (girl with red hair) that they were closing soon in a rude tone. My girlfriend said that we thought they were closing at 9:30PM and it was only around 8PM, she said yes they close at 9:30PM but they were still about to close. And then we asked if it is okay if we can eat here and she responded rudely and said sure. As she was taking our order, she was scrolling through her phone and singing to the song over the speaker, which is extremely unprofessional. Then she took a century to swipe my card because she didn't know how the machine worked. Never coming back again and surprised this is located in Hoboken. The food was decent, broth was too salty."

Latia Bates, a year ago, 1, 'I ordered today for delivery and as I immediately opened my container of the hot and spicy ramen (fire pulled pork), I got a horrible stench. It was a very heavy, foul smell. I was making excuses for this dish and telling my husband it must be the seaweed but then I took a bite of the egg and gagged. Not only was the outside brown, the inside was too. My entire bowl is rotten and my daughter ordered the same thing. We just cant eat it and I will not take a chance. 30+ dollars down the drain.

Trish Laureano, a year ago, 1, 'Do NOT come here !! Our eggs were clearly old to the point where it is dangerous to even try eating them.

Daniel Lane, a year ago, 1, 'Came here thinking this was the best ramen house in Hoboken in accordance with the reviews. The noodles were clearly store bought and resembled cheap spaghetti. The eggs were brown to the extent you could not even recognize that they‚Äôre eggs. Overall the dish was well below average. Find another place.'
Melanie Tam, a year ago, 2, "My fianc√© and I came in with my parents for a late-ish lunch at around 2 pm on a Sunday. There was one other couple dining there and no one ordering takeout. Already not a good sign. We had noticed that this place was always empty, so we never gave it a chance until this day. They serve ramen and poke bowls (odd, I know), you order at the counter, and they bring it to you.\n\nMy parents had the Original Ton Men (braised pork, egg, onion, bean sprouts, nori, seaweed, kikurage, bamboo, roasted onion flakes). I had the Fire Chili Miso Ton Men (Fired pulled pork, egg, onion, bean sprout, nori seaweed, kikurage, bamboo, roasted onion flakes.) It was basically just a slightly spicy version of the original ton men but with pulled pork instead. I feel like most of the ingredients didn't really go together. It was more like 'whatever they could find that is Asian and seems like it could go into a bowl of ramen' ramen. It didn't taste bad, but it was just odd. I did appreciate that they didn't overcook the noodles though. My fianc√© created his own poke bowl. The color of his spicy tuna was a fiery hot orange, like a flaming hot Cheeto. Looked pretty questionable, but it didn't taste off. It just tasted like they added a lot of stuff to it to hide any fishiness. I probably wouldn't risk ordering anything raw from here again, especially not with so many other poke places popping up in Hoboken now.\n\nIn fact, I probably wouldn't visit again. I'd probably prefer the dried ramen noodles. I too can haphazardly throw random ingredients into a bowl."

The added veggies were a bit odd (the overabundance of raw onion wasn't too pleasant).  The real deal maker was the egg (they give you an entire egg) it was perfect.
