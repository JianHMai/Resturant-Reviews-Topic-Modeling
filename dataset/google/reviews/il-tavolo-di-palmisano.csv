Anthony Spirito, 2 weeks ago, 5, "All of their dishes are pretty good at the bare minimum, but some of them have been the best meals I've eaten outside of my home. I think La Nonna has more street cred, but I think the Short Rib Rag√π is easily the best thing I've ordered so far."

Ed Bocchino, a month ago, 2, "Mediocre, unauthentic theme park food. Red sauce and pasta tasted like Prego and Butoni from the supermarket. Spaghetti was undercooked and inedible. Unsanitary outdoor area with trash bins adjacent to tables drawing rodents in clear view of diners, broken toilet in men's room, lipstick on wine glass. Friendly staff and fast service keep it from one star. Hate to leave a review like this especially when so many hospitality businesses are hurting but please clean up."

Shout out to Dante who really had an amazing personality and made us laugh. The owner Frank came over to ask how everything was and if they can improve anything which we really enjoyed.

Angie Gutermuth, a month ago, 1, 'Honestly the worst food and bar experience I‚Äôve ever had. We ordered the mussels which came out dry, rubbery, and smelled like they were bad. We sent them back and then attempted to order the fried burrata. It came out and was cold in the center. We sent that back as well. In my entire adult life I‚Äôve never ever sent food back. Service was also terrible. When our mussels came out, we asked for utensils and plates. None ever came. We went to hostess and she pointed at the bin of utensils. We were sitting at the bar for almost 2 hours & after ordering our drink at very beginning, never had anyone come back to us. This was a Monday night between 4:30-6:30. We were literally 2 of 4 people sitting at the bar.'
Agnes Damato (Wallace), 2 months ago, 5, "The service was fabulous! The food is beyond delicious. Just like my very Italian Nonna use to make, and even more delicious, dishes Nonna never made.

Licia McClary, 8 months ago, 5, "Before writing this I wasn't sure if I would give 5 stars because our immediate impression from the hostess wasn't the best.  We had reserved an outside igloo, we arrived on time and she said we would have to wait as the table was not free yet.  I pointed out that there were three open tables outside. all the same size and she still said we'll they are reserved so you will have to wait 10 to 15 minutes? Huh? I went outside to wait...She came out and said I can seat you at one of the open tables...well ok we got to sit, I assume the manager inside who heard me questioning her told her to seat us as no one else was waiting.  Now the reason I did give 5 stars is #1 the servers are terrific.  Dominique was our main person but each and every person on the wait staff looks out for you.  They were all attentive, pleasant and gave great recommendations from the menu.  We chose everything by their say so.  #2 food was absolutely delicious. Cooked perfectly, and a nice portion.  We also had the pork chop but I unfortunately took a bad pic of that.  We have not eaten out in months as we do not do the indoor dining thing right now.  We figure we have been so conservative for a year, why change that now.  We will wait until summer when the whole shot thing is under control.  However, kudo's to the owners, the igloo's are a fabulous idea for us conservative couples. It was a glorious sunny Sunday afternoon but they also have heaters in them so I am sure they are comfortable then too. My hunny cannot be around anyone right now he must be ultra conservative but we were really dying to get out just this one time since winter set in! Love the place overall, will go back again. Look forward to another meal here."
Catherine Anlas, 8 months ago, 5, 'Excellent dinner with friends! Love the ambience in the back room. Our waiter, Jared, was absolutely fantastic. Wish he could be our waiter everywhere!

Eric Hammer, 9 months ago, 4, 'First of all, credit to Il Tavolo for opening their doors in tandem with the world shutting down, and still standing tall today. That timing would be a death sentence for many lesser businesses, so congratulations on your early success!\n\nI finally got here a few weeks ago, sat right away outside, and had a great experience. The fried calamari was good not great, we loved the stuffed long hots, but the chicken cutlet w burrata (I forget the actual name) was the highlight of the night. I wish it had more balsamic and more roasted red peppers, but this is a ‚Äúmust try‚Äù as far as I‚Äôm concerned.\n\nI also spoke w the business via IG and they were grateful for me coming in. It‚Äôs nice when a business lets you know those types of things. Can‚Äôt wait to get back here again soon.\n\n2/1 UPDATE:\nStopped in again with friends recently and had another great dinner. The grilled octopus starter was fantastic, as were the stuffed peppers. For mains, we split the short rib (best dish of the night), Chicken Cutlet burrata, and pork chop and peppers.\n\nAnother great meal. I hope Il Tavolo sticks around for a while. They can hang with any italian restaurant in Hoboken'
Victoria, 9 months ago, 5, 'My roommate and I tried this restaurant for the first time tonight and it was amazing! We sat outside in one of the bubbles and it was so cute. We got a bottle of Chianti, 2 of the bruschetta plates (artichoke heart and roasted pepper), the stuffed rigatoni and the short rib raviolis. Everything was delicious! The service was great and the owner even checked on us himself a few times. Definitely 10/10 recommend! We‚Äôll be back for sure!!'
Melissa L, 9 months ago, 5, 'I am 9 months pregnant and have rarely gone out since the pandemic. After deciding to go here for a date night, this preggo is very happy. We had the bruschetta board for a sampler. I‚Äôve never had bruschetta like this. All were VERY good (broccoli rabe, tomato, prosciutto) but my absolute favorite was the roasted tomato with hot honey. I can‚Äôt wait to go back for it. We also shared the Pete‚Äôs shrimp which had a good spicy kick. I can‚Äôt wait to back after baby and this time to have a cocktail with my appetizer. Husband loved the Mediterranean mule.'

Daniel Scheetz, 9 months ago, 5, 'Wow!  Excellent meals!  We had multiple bruschetta boards, Burrata as appetizers.  Chicken Parm was best ever had.

The short ribs ragu special was delicious and portions are plentiful.  Nice atmosphere, friendly and attentive service, fairly priced, indoor and outdoor dining available.'

Top quality wine & liquor to rival 5 star hotels.  Our server Edward struck the perfect balance of highly attentive yet low-key.  Hit this gem now before word gets out and the wait becomes weeks.'

Samuel Wilson, a year ago, 2, 'Look at the surface and it looks like a fantastic restaurant to dine in/at. Good refurbishment, nice crockery and glasses, well presented food. Scratch below the surface and you‚Äôll actually find a sub par experience.\n\nWe called to be added to the waitlist. At the maximum time given, we called back to enquire about the status of our wait, only be told we were called and we missed our turn. I asked the hostess to check the call list and call me back. Two minutes later she calls back and let‚Äôs me know that she called the wrong number.\n\nWhen we arrive at the restaurant, there‚Äôs an apology. Greatly appreciated. Sat at a very pleasant table outdoors with a personal heater. Nice atmosphere. Menu via QR reader as most places are nowadays. 15 mins later ask the hostess to ask the waiter to come to our table. At this point, no water, no attention, nothing.\n\nTakes order and quick service from there. Food is good. Not great, good. Dry focaccia, so-so octopus and nice burrata. Entrees arrived quickly after.\n\nOur cutlery arrived five minutes later. In the interim I asked for black pepper for my carbonara. A mixed chili shaker like you would find in a Pizza Hut 10 years ago arrived. I asked for black pepper again, old school salt and pepper shaker arrived. Join the 20th century and order grinders (I know it‚Äôs the 21st, but I‚Äôd be happy if they joined the 20th).\n\nCarbonara was thicc. Tasty, but not traditional. Heavy cream used in sauce, served with a burnt fried egg. My colleague had salmon which she enjoyed.\n\nPrice was reasonable. Since I moved from the U.K., I‚Äôve never tipped below 20%, but I felt compelled to only tip 15% today. I had high hopes when I planned my attendance, but walked away with an unusual taste in my mouth. Could be the cream from the carbonara, could be the glitter they used to cover mediocrity.'
