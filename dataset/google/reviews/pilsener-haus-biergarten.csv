Sabrina G, 4 days ago, 1, 'Absolutely horrendous experience not once but three times here. But this last experience was the worst. Not sure if it was the manager or someone else but he disrespected my mom publicly because she was trying to wave down someone to help us while chewing (so she wouldn‚Äôt be speaking with a full mouth). No one has been to our table in well over 15 minutes (as usual there). I hate writing negative reviews but after three bad experiences, it clearly was not just an unlucky night.'
