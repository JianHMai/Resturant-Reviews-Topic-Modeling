This is 2 lunches for me.\n\nA great deal also is the rainbow roll special which is 11$ and comes with huge portion of the roll, 4 pieces of sushi, a soup AND a salad. You can't beat that.\nMy humble opinion anyways\n\nOh and they have bubble tea and Thai iced tea . What else do you want?????"

I‚Äôm a lifelong Hoboken resident, and I‚Äôve been eating at restaurants here my whole life - and I‚Äôve never left anyone a review, good or bad.\n\nHowever, after my experience today at Precious, I felt like I had to share my review with the internet.\n\nAs I was eating my fried rice, I found a huge chunk of plastic in my food (I‚Äôll try and attach a photo if I can). The waiter seemed hesitant to exchange for another one, but after a minute of my persuasion she finally let up.\n\nThen she proceeded to try and charge me for all my food, which I hadn‚Äôt even touched, since I lost my appetite two bites into the plastic-infested rice. The waiter consistently denied me the refund I deserved, and went on to insist that I pay over thirty bucks for two bites of food, and a bite of plastic.\n\nAs someone who had plastic in my food, the least I could ask for was a full refund. The internet says that the average settlement for a civil lawsuit regarding foreign food of restaurants is more than $100,000.\n\nAfter half an hour of waiting and arguing for a rightful refund, I just barely prevailed and I was granted a refund.\n\nAdditional, my friends were granted something called a ‚Äúservice fee‚Äù. It‚Äôs their covert way of charging for a 20% tip - and there‚Äôs no way to opt out of it.\n\nFolks, don‚Äôt come to this restaurant. There are plenty of other great restaurants with Chinese/Japanese/Eastern Asian cuisine food. One‚Äôs that have a bare minimum of service, and don‚Äôt have plastic in your food.\n\n1/10'

As vegetarians, there are plenty of choices, from veggie fried rice to lo mein to the amazing string beans. They also have soy-based chicken that is always a tasty option.

Agraj Sobti, 3 years ago, 1, "Did not get to try their food. Yelp and Google both say their closing time to be 11:00pm. So we took the outside table at 10:10 only for the waiter to come out and tell us that the restaurant will be closing in 10 minutes. He kept coming out again and again to confirm that we can finish our food before 10:30 so they could close the place. Would not say it's the waiter's fault. The owners should update their operation hours on both Google and Yelp as it can be very misleading for customers. Again, I am not laying the blame in the waiter. He was just doing his job."

But the reason I gave them 1 star is because yesterday I ordered my meal to go, but my girlfriend was in a long line in cold stones so I decided to come back in to eat. I walked up to the front corner and I let them know I would like to sit down and eat.  The guy looked me in my eyes and flat out told me NO! I was shocked, I instantly looked behind me and seen numerous people eating, so I got offended because I knew off the bat that it was because I was a young black man. I had to ask him "Why can\'t I sit down" his reply was, because you have to tip the waiter..... so not only did he tell me I couldn\'t sit down but his reasoning was because I had to tip, as If I didn\'t come on and just pay for a whole meal with out a problem... I\'m never spending my hard earned dollars in the restaurant again & it\'s a shame because they\'re really good. But I will not be treated any kind of way...'

The most recent time it took an hour and 40 minutes. The last two times the food has also arrived cold. The drivers are incredibly rude, one guy bad mouthed me because I didn't leave a tip. I didn't give him a tip because he was so late, the food was cold, and despite telling the driver and the restaurant that the doorbell doesn't work and to please call he didn't call. Instead he stood in front of the wrong door ringing the bell."

Xavier Rosario, 6 years ago, 2, "Food was too expensive. Got delivery but the delivery man couldn't even speak English therefore i had to run around looking for him. The food was also subpar. Never ordering again. Only pro was quick delivery."
Sam jackson, 6 years ago, 3, 'The Boss is an arrogant , his last name is Huang. I have been going there for years and I do like the place , however they have a policy that requires you to spend a minimum of $15 on your credit card even for take-out! Legally they cannot do this as the law states that the minimum charge can be no more than $10. I contacted the restaurant and was told that the boss (Huang ) said its his restaurant and he can do as he pleases. I called VISA and MasterCard and reported the incident and the restaurant is now being investigated for abusing the credit card laws. Please confront Precious restaurant and the owner and let them know you will boycott the restaurant if they do not reduce the minimum charge on credit card to the allowed amount of $10! Also let them know that you will be calling both Visa and MasterCard and filing a complaint against the restaurant , and then please follow through and do file the complaint! We cannot let these arrogant owners get away with this. Please stand up for your rights ! There is strength in Unity! To contact VISA dial : 1-800-VISA-911 , to contact MasterCard dial: 1-800-MASTERCARD . please take action and fight for your consumer rights.\nRegards\nSam'

Will Nickley, 7 years ago, 5, "My wife and I order delivery from Precious at least once each month. Although they always seem a bit frantic on the phone, our order arrives hot and quickly, even on Friday night! (plus, we're in JCHeights)\n\nThey definitely have the BEST vegetarian options I've EVER tried from any Chinese restaurant. Their Vegetarian House Duck Special is super, and so is their Vegetarian General Tso's Chicken.\n\nHope you find something you love, too."
Baldwin Torres, 8 years ago, 3, 'Food was great! Awesome rolls and main course! Service a bit disappointing my "Chinese Fried Rice" arrived minutes after the "Chicken Wings"\nOverall I still plan on going back.'
Wendy Leveron, 8 years ago, 5, "Love it....I'm from JC and drive to Hoboken to have some Good Chinese Food :)"
Matt Pesci, 8 years ago, 5, 'The best Chinese food in town. I lived in Hoboken for 3 years and have worked here for more then 5 and have tried them all. Precious has the best Chinese food by far and their Sushi can be among the best as well, though some nights I would say it is just average. Delivery times were always quick and the food is not horribly overpriced. Service is decent when eating in as well, at least for a Chinese restaurant.'
Lewis James, 8 years ago, 3, 'My favorite Chinese restaurant in town. The food is not greasy like normal chinese fast food, and it has the best vegetarian selection around. My favorite dish is the veggie scallops.'
Natalie Flores, 10 years ago, 4, 'My favorite chinese restaurant in town. The food is not greasy like normal chinese fast food, and it has the best vegetarian selection around. My favorite dish is the veggie scallops and the veggie house fried brown rice. I love that they have such creative vegetarian dishes and my meat eaters always empty their plates so I can vouch for that too. I love this place, it is cheap, good, fresh and byob. What more can you ask for.'
