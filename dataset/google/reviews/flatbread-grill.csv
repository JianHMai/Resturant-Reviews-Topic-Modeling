Erika, 2 years ago, 1, "I was in love with the one in jersey city and am extremely sad that it closed. So when I went on the website and saw that the Hoboken location was delivering I hoped right on it. After an hour I received a phone call saying that I should check my locations before ordering and that they do not deliver to jersey city and that I can to come and pick up my order. Unfortunately due to my job that was impossible and was the reason as to why I clicked on delivery. I had no problem with this and asked if I could just have a refund. The young lady refused to let me speak to a manager and said she didn‚Äôt know any of them. She was extremely rude and on top of that I went without lunche and still got charged. Highly disappointed with the customer service and the ordering system. If you only deliver to Hoboken that should be stated.\n\nSomeone makes a comment and you feel harassed. If that‚Äôs the case you should just close. And don‚Äôt use another country's turmoil as a poor excuse for the way you treat your customers. You would never understand what they are going through."
Bitter Sweet, 2 years ago, 1, "The food is good, but the customer service and staff look miserable! I have been there 3 times now and everyone has a very very bad attitude. Management, please work on better staffing as you might be losing many customers because people do not want to deal with your staff's attitude."

CurlsnPearlsss, 2 years ago, 2, 'Falafel pita pocket was ok but it was overly drenched in sauce (yogurt cucumber and red hot) which was way too tangy. It made the bread completely soggy and I was unable to eat half of it. Staff is not friendly. Will not return.'
Maddie, 2 years ago, 1, 'Employees are unnecessarily rude. Food isn‚Äôt anything special and overpriced. Not worth it.\n\nEditing to respond:\n\nI have never been to the location and Montclair, starting eating here when Hoboken location opened up. Customer service has increasingly declined as you can see here.'

Stephanie Escobar, 2 years ago, 2, 'Employees either need to cheer up or just add more love into making these sandwiches, my chicken pesto sandwich wasn‚Äôt good. Chicken was burnt.\nNo greeting when walking in nor while standing at register.\nAlso, not their fault but sodas out of service- a few sandwiches were out of stock. Horrible'

Brett Hladczuk, 3 years ago, 5, "When I first heard of this place, I was surprised, and frankly disappointed, that it was not just a specialty flatbread pizza joint. This disappointment faded quickly when the first fork-full of shepard's salad blessed my tastebuds. 2 years of rehab later, I was finally able to get completely clean and quit shepard's salad for good. Oh, and the rest of the food is great, too."

Ryan Gilmartin, 3 years ago, 1, 'Just called to place just for delivery.  "Umm can you do it online? I\'m busy".\n\nDecided to order somewhere else so this 1 star is based solely on the customer service.'
Malcolm McDaniel, 3 years ago, 2, "I will never order here or recommend it to anyone I know ever again. First, when the food was delivered, they forgot three orders of fries. When I called the store to inform them of this, the woman that picked up first insisted that we did have the fries. After informing her again that we didn't receive them, she said we would need to wait because they delivery driver had other orders. Second, I received a Dr.Pepper and a Half and Half Lemonade when I asked for a Sprite. I originally wanted a Minute Maid Lemonade, and the same woman called to tell me that they didn't have that so I asked for a Sprite which she said was fine. After calling about the Sprite, she first hung up on me! After calling back and stating that she hung up on me, the same woman rudely stated that she didn't hang up she placed me on mute and proceeded to yell at me as I inquired about the Sprite which resulted in her rudely hanging up again. Thirdly, I asked for a sandwich with no onions for allergies reasons and received a sandwich with onions. Luckily I spoke to a different woman and she was so kind to send me a new sandwich (S/O to Gigi!) Odd thing was when the delivery person brought the sandwich, he asked to trade the sandwich I did have which I have never heard of before. There's plenty of other options, and I will never waste my time dealing with them again. One of the worst experiences I have had ordering food ANYWHERE!"

Kathleen Budny, 3 years ago, 4, 'Four stars cause the food is decent and there aren‚Äôt many great choices in the immediate area. But they seem to forget something from your order each time, whether it‚Äôs sauce, feta, or bread.'
Georgie Murray, 3 years ago, 1, 'Poor customer service. Flatbread over cooked and made with an attitude. Pot luck on whether you receive great service or bad. Shame as has a lot of potential. Got a concealed lump of milk in my iced latte also.'
Amy Bernard, 3 years ago, 1, 'Placed an order on seamless that they completely messed up. They told me I could request a refund through seamless but they wouldn‚Äôt redeliver. When I told the person on the phone I was not satisfied with that (because I still needed to eat - and btw this is 1.5 hours before they close) she literally said ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù.\n\nEditing to respond: I called 5 minutes after I received the order when I opened the bag and it was apparent the bowl was missing more than half the ingredients. Yes, I received the item - it had a scoop of hummus and some sad veggies (no beets, quinoa, feta cheese as described). I did not want free food - I wanted the food I ordered and paid for. And you absolutely said ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù and hung up on me when I said I wanted the item I paid for delivered. Nice response though - a continuation of your stellar customer service.'

Joe, 4 years ago, 3, 'Flatbread Grill has great food most of the time.  The service is okay.\n\nOn busy days when the staff are turning over a lot of orders, it is easy for them to be swept into the rush and not put out quality product.  My Chicken Chipotle Flatbread was burned on the bottom, and they gave me a "for here" container even though I specified that I wanted it "To go."\n\nThe staff take a long time to take your order, and can take even longer to get your food out, which isn\'t necessarily because the food is basically made to order.\n\nFlatbread grill has great food, but stay away from it when they are busy, or you will wait 3x longer than you should and the food will be either great or not-so-great.'

Matthew Hartsough, 6 years ago, 3, 'Ordered a chicken flat-top platter with chickpea salad, brown rice, and rosemary garlic thumb bread. Everything I ate tasted great, I finished every last drop of food on my plate. Which leads to the downside of Flatbread Grill: portion size. The rice and chickpea salad were plentiful and the thumb bread is a nice size, but there were only 4 small morsels of chicken in my dish. There should be at least two more for the $10 bill. I hope when I try Flatbread again the portion sizes are bigger and I can bump the review up to 4 stars. They also use computer screens to order which I think takes some of the personality away from the restaurant.'
