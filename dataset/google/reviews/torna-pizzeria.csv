Casey James Scheiner, a year ago, 1, "This is unfortunate as I am very proud to have been a long-time pizza blogger (thatssocheezy,com), but this place was very disappointing.\n\nI had always passed it as my wife had  lived right above the pharmacy, so the one day (around 3 years ago) I grabbed a slice. They unfortunately had to cook a new pie cause the previous one burnt (I guess reasonable), but they couldn't provide me change because they didn't have money in the till and though polite, seemed pretty uncaring that I waited 20 minutes for a slice.\n\nA lot of people swear by this place as a good night place, but maybe my experience was just the rare poorly executed one. I hope to come back one day and not be disappointed."

Codi Franmaio, a year ago, 1, 'Ordered for delivery a small pizza with onions (menu says 10 inches) and received an extra small pizza (8 inches and virtually no onions) that Looked about the size of a slice. And all this (sarcasm) cost me $12 lol. Thanks for nothing!\n\nIn Response to Owner:\n\nYou had a chance to make it right yesterday when I first called to bring your attention to this issue. When I said I wanted my money back because of the inadequacy of the pizza, I was told that I would have to give back the pizza. So you had your delivery guy return to pick up the pizza. Why not just offer me a full refund and let me keep the pizza for the inconvenience? That is how you could have made it right, but you didn‚Äôt. How are you proposing to make it right now, by me ordering another pizza from you and paying for it? That is certainly right for you but it does nothing for me. What a joke!'

Joshua De Leon, 2 years ago, 3, "I have been visiting Tornas for over 20 years and I order a Sicilian slice almost every time.  Once in a while I do get some other things on the menu like mozzarella sticks and wings, sometimes a regular pie but I think the Sicilian pizza is the best thing here.   I used to be a huge fan of their hot sandwiches for the size and price but ever since the old Italian lady that used to cook at Tornas passed away the food hasn't tasted as delicious as it was before.   Tornas food used to be super good  and now it's just OK that's why I'm giving them 3 stars.  Don't get me wrong the food is good and you get decent portions it's just not like it used to be.  If you order food for delivery try to order early on weekends because they can get very busy and you'll end up waiting for an hour or more any other time it's fast."

Melanie Tam, 2 years ago, 4, "I've tried many of the abundant pizza places in Hoboken but I didn't even know Torna's existed until I saw it on the Slice app. We ordered for pickup one Thursday evening. We tried a regular slice, Sicilian slice, chicken tenders, baked ziti with vodka sauce, and the meatball parm platter. The regular slice is nothing to write home about. There are plenty of better slices in the neighborhood, so don't go out of your way for this. But that Sicilian slice...might be one of the best I've had in life. It's light and fluffy with plenty of ooey gooey cheese. If you get a topping, they put it under the cheese, which was an interesting twist that I enjoyed.\n\nYou can skip all of the other dishes - especially the chicken tenders. Chicken tenders from the supermarket freezer section taste better than this. We only ordered it because we had a minimum to meet for a coupon we wanted to use, and it was supposed to come with French fries (which I was craving, and we saw it was missing when we got home).\n\nI'd definitely come back for a Sicilian slice, but nothing else."

Frank Brennan, 2 years ago, 2, 'The place changed ownership. The prices went up and the product quality and taste had declined.  They once had the best lasagna for $12. Now it is more money and not nearly as good.  The pizza was also better before.  They did change the interior and make it a little more updated but still, not any better than a basic pizza parlor.  I hope they can go back to the old recipes.'
