Michael Blazek, 2 hours ago, 3, "Decent pizza, a little watery though.\n\nService was okay but I would have liked the server to come by a little more often. Considering the staffing situation in this country though, I don't fault the establishment on this."

Grace .S, 5 days ago, 5, 'My boyfriend and I came here for dinner since it‚Äôs always packed when we walk past it. We were really impressed by their Tagliatelle al Ragu Bolognese. It wasn‚Äôt overly salty, the pasta was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was *chef‚Äôs kiss*. We also ordered their Margherita pizza which was also great. The only complaint we had was not having enough space on our table as their dishes are large and we had to have our sharing plates taken away.  The location is great, its right by the water front so the view is nice. We will definitely be back to try their other dishes.'

Slavica Chavdarsky, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'The place has an outside sitting area with a beautiful view of the Sinatra Park and the Hudson River. The tables are small but still it feels comfortable. Food was very good. We ordered some chicken served with pasta and it was delicious and the dish was large. I tried pizza too but for my taste it was a bit too soggy with tomato sauce. Yet, that‚Äôs just my personal preference. Prices for a meal ranged 15-30. Staff were great. Definitely coming back here.'
Mina Defee, 2 weeks ago, 2, 'Pretty disappointed to be honest.\n\nReading the Google reviews and looking through some of the other pics on here it looks like this would be an awesome place with great food and a view. It‚Äôs pretty much none of that.\n\nThe service was incredibly slow. It took forever to order, forever to get the food, and forever to pay. It wasn‚Äôt very busy and it didn‚Äôt look understaffed so I don‚Äôt know what the deal was. Did see others get better service so maybe it was just our individual server.\n\nThe food was not worth the price. We paid over $20 for the chicken parm and they literally used sliced cheese‚Ä¶ the fruta di mate was pretty good but some of the shells were broken in the spaghetti.\n\nOh and if you‚Äôre looking for something Sinatra related, you won‚Äôt find it here. The name and a plaque outside are the only things that are related.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a good view, just go to one of the local parks.'

STOOL PIGEON, 3 weeks ago, 3, "This place is pretty nice with a view-our waiter (Anthony if I'm not mistaken) was really attentive and funny. We were a group of 4 around 2030, food was served fast -my friend got tuna salad I belive which was nothing special tbh. My bro got pork chops and I gotta say that was real good, my other friend only got a cheesecake which was not bad, I got the prosciutto truffle pizza (my first time trying truffles) and I think that was the highlight of the whole night -it was super delicious. Downside is they have no cocktails on site -just wines which we weren't in the mood for"

So far one of my favorites in NJ, With an outdoor terrace with a European flair that teleports you to Italy and a wonderful view of the Hudson River and the NY skyline. As for the food it is 5 stars.

After brining our drinks which took long we told our waiter we are ready to order but he said he would be right back. Finally we ordered three meals one was a pizza. The waiter asked if we wanted it to come all together we said yes.\nWe also ordered penne vodka and asked for it to be light on the sauce.\nAfter waiting some time 2 meals came no pizza. The penne vodka was drenched with sauce. Chicken was hard. No Pizza he apologized said pizza never went in. Finally after both meals were done pizza came. I felt so bad for my daughter it was her special day. Bottom line service is horrible, prices are high and food was just ok.'

Tata and Bubu, a month ago, 1, 'It was out first visit in this restaurant. I was looking forward to come and eat here since we move here in Hoboken. We tried so many times to come in but everytime we cone its always pack. This time 9/17/21 we finally get to chance to come and eat here since they have no customer and only have 1 table only when we got here. When we got sat down, they asked as for drinks, and asked for Still water, we noticed that the glass was dirty and asked for a new one, the server Jonathan changed up his moos after we asked for that. My boyfriend and i both worked in NYC as Restaurant Manager. After we got out drinks. It took 10minutes for him to come back and said sorry i forgot about you and he will be coming for the complimentary bread. They brought the bread and took out order. I was excited about it and just gave the server a chance. We order Pulpo(octopus) and baked clam. Theyre both great! But when our entree meal came in. Noone even clean up our table yet befor dropping off our entree. We sit in a 2top table. We have to lift our own plates so the busser can put our next meal in our table. After that, noone even check on is, our server Jonathan fidnt even check if hows our food. Working in a restaurant, i know that there‚Äôs a 2 bite rule, once a customer took there 2 bites a server should be checking up on the table and make sure the food went well. We just both hope that the food come up good even if our server wasnt that attentivd to us at all.Jonathan never did check on us. Our food was actually not tasteful. The cheese from the chicken parm was old, cause we can taste and see how it look also. My salmon wasnt that great also. We just tried to eat because we didnt want to waste the food, in my end i didnt really ate much because my salmon wasnt that really great for $26 plate. After we ate we were waiting for our server to come and just get the check we waited too long that i have to go inside the restaurant to asked for our check. This is a bad experience. I hope you cAn do something about this issue. This will be our last dine in to this restaurant. We were going to bring our family on Sunday to this restaurant but i had to call another restaurant in the area to make reservation because of this experience. Our bill came to $89 already that we didnt even enjoyed neither service and half of the meal.\n\nThank you for listening.'

I was expecting something a little more low key and more of a chill city vibe, but loud pop tunes were ringing out and trying to have a convo was almost impossible.\nI had the penne vodka which was cooked perfectly al dente. For the price point of this place (wasn't too too crazy) I was expecting some bread  before dinner, like any Italian restaurant. This particular person did not ask if bread was wanted nor did they bring any out, but tables sat afterwards all had bread brought out. I asked for a glass of water along with my sangria (which was horrible and $9 a glass). I did not receive my water until the meal was already served and wasn't aware of water options until I overheard the table next to being asked what type of water would they would like. Bottled, sparkling, etc.. I received a room temp glass of water. I will not be going back here."

The worst thing by far was the lasagna. They used b√©chamel sauce for the lasagna, and a so-called ‚Äúbolognese‚Äù that hardly had any meat in it. The pasta itself was over cooked, and the whole thing was soggy in the middle. Service was horrible, took 30 minutes to even order in the first place after our original server had vanished. The place is filthy and the floor is literally sticky, you can feel it clinging to your shoes. I wouldn‚Äôt go back to this place even for free. This is a shame to Italian cuisine.'

Then we ordered two drinks that obviously tasted different from what we ordered. My friend asked the waitress if she got us the right drink because it doesn‚Äôt taste like it. The waitress just said yes it‚Äôs the drink you ordered and left without even asking if we want another drink instead or if there is a problem with the drink. Maybe it was the right drink but that didn‚Äôt taste good. We honestly felt like she was not treating us properly especially that she was not giving other customers the same treatment.

Our food arrived, but there were no utensils, the server took some time to get them to us while our food was getting cold. The good service you expect for a pricy restaurant was just completely absent."
Davide Siciliano, 7 months ago, 4, "This is a great authentic Italian restaurant, right on the Hudson River, across from Manhattan. In fact, you can see the NYC Skyline while dining here. If you didn't know it is named after Ol' Blue Eyes, who happened to be from Hoboken, you would probably think the name of this eatery doesn't sound very Italian. But Frank was a true goombah and was proud of his Italian heritage. My lady friend and I shared a delectable margherita pizza. There is one grumpy young waitress here, though. That is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Fortunately, our waiter was very hospitable and respectful."

Gary E, a year ago, 5, 'I had two dinners and one lunch here. It was fantastic. You would think the location is what makes the restaurant. But it‚Äôs the food and the service. Friendly waiters, and owner. Most importantly, the food was a delight. I will be back. I recommend the pizzas, or any of the pasta dishes.'
Kayla Contreras, a year ago, 1, 'Service here was so terrible! We waited an hour for our food, but yet no food. We were told we had to move to a different table. The waiter tried to move us to a very small table that was completely outside of the restaurant where people were standing in line to come inside. It was such a disrespectful and embarrassing experience here.'

Shireen Bhullar, a year ago, 5, "Delicious food and dessert, great coffees and wine, and a beautiful view! I've been here a couple times now and do suggest this as an option for dinner to others. I love Italian and this is one of my favorites for many reasons. The food is fresh and flavorful. The service is usually great as well. I love the nutella cappuccino, their margherita pizza, ravioli, and tiramisu the most! They have a great wine selection as well. They do have enough vegetarian options. The only drawback is a slightly cramped space and if you don't mind that, it is a great location for a date, a family dinner or for a dinner with friends."
