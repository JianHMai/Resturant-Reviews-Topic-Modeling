Mariah Blah, 3 days ago, 1, 'Food is great. Two stars for poor customer service and attitude from man in charge of expediting. I ordered 1 bagel at 10:48 exactly. I literally work down the block about 3 stores away IN A RESTAURANT. I order every weekend so I completely understand how busy they are. I never complain. I returned exactly 3 times after receiving a 35 minute wait time ( ordered online ). Unfortunately I had to work at 12pm. I returned at 11:15, 11:30 and 11:45. It still was not ready. Finally after clocking in, I was able to get a quick break to run and pick it up.\n\nNot only does the man tell me he threw away my bagel but then continues to argue with me after I explained that I had already returned 3 times. My coworker ordered at 11:45. The final time I returned to pick up all three bagels. Their two bagels were ready while mine was thrown out. Instead of comping my bagel and remaking it . He tells me to pay for it and he would deliver it very rudely. You just lost a customer for a $6 bagel for your rudeness and horrible customer service.\n\nSucks when you work in the restaurant industry and are one of the most understanding customers, we always get the short end of the stick. We will no longer be ordering from here.'

Such a generic bacon egg and cheese sandwich. It wasn‚Äôt good. At all. Cheese was barely melted and just a fluffy chunk of cold scrambled eggs. Barely any bacon as well. Home fries were just huge chunks of semi raw potatoes. For 11$ for the sandwich and home fries would much rather go to 8/11 or Dunkin‚Äô Donuts the sandwiches  are very similar. Will never be back.'

In terms of the bagels themselves, JPs is probably the best in the city (#2 at worst). But the way they make sandwiches is better than anyone in Hoboken. Also I haven't found another spot in town with Egg Everything bagels. The flats are outstanding too.\n\nThe breakfast sandwiches hit the spot every time. And I personally love getting lunch sandwiches on bagels, and no place does it better than JPs. They load up the bagels with everything I want. Great spot. Worth the walk, worth the wait, worth the price."

The bagel was perfectly toasted, the quality of the bagel was delicious, too.  The tuna and cheese were also delicious, and the coffee was perfectly brewed.  I was very surprised to see a table built into the window of the shop, and a separate table near the ordering counter.

Mayra ‚ÄúMDXDY‚Äù Miguel, 3 years ago, 4, 'My family had breakfast here twice during our Hoboken stay. The coffee was really good! I ordered the everything bagel with cream cheese and the Nutella/cream cheese‚Äîit was so tasty and filling! The jalape√±o burrito was also quite spicy. Service was kind of slow the first time (four bagels and one burrito ordered Saturday around 9am) but a little faster the second time (same order Monday at 7am).'

G G, 3 years ago, 1, "Its crazy to think that I went so out of my way to come to this place for a bagel, but I did and boy do I regret it. I could've gone to Duncan Donuts and have had something wayyyyy better. All I asked for was a toasted bagel with cream cheese. I even risked getting a parking ticket for this place....woah that makes me mad. How do you burn a bagel and still think its a good idea to give it to your customer that way. Either this place can't handle the amount of clientele which was not bad or they were having a bad day. I for one will never come here again after this experience. Its unexcusable and unforgiveable!"

I ordered breakfast platter and when I arrived, the girl was not nice and said they didn't start cooking. I'm so disappointed. I've been going there for ten years and it has become worse. Maybe its time to change the morning girl."

They put cheese on it and the egg was burned. Regarding the cheese, whatever, it happens. OTOH, browning an egg is not good. Really overpowers any other flavors. If you accidentally burn the egg, cook another one...'
