Beverly Brown, a day ago, 2, 'I should first say that admire and I appreciate  the owners‚Äô efforts to establish a large tapas bar in Hoboken. I lived in Spain for many years and love the idea of having a tapas bar near where I live.  It is also a logical venture in a town with a culinary industry that is routed in a heavy drinking clientele.  Tapas, by definition accompany alcohol and are a welcome addition to any bar top.\n\nThe space where Sangria is located lends itself very well to large parties that want to drink and dine. They have a large wide open dining room off of fairly large bar and, in good weather, there terrace doubles the dining room. The staff is welcoming, friendly, efficient and have pep in their steps.\n\nWhat I am about to say is an honest critique that I think the owners deserve  to have so that they will indeed succeed!\n\nUnfortunately, my experience fell far short of satisfaction.  Walking by one day, I stopped in drawn by Flamenco music wafting from loud speakers. A fan of the genre, I wondered if their were live performers inside.  There were not, but the hostess, after checking with someone behind the bar,  told me that there would be live music during the Saturday brunch. Excited, I suggested to my husband and daughter that we check it out. Saturday morning I called to confirm that there would be live Flamenco. She said that ‚Äúyes at 11:00am.‚Äù\n\nWell! ‚ÄúLive‚Äù means that they have a live DJ, who did not play any Flameco at all. The entire time we dined to super loud bass boom Euro-pop, my least favorite music and discoed up cover tunes. This at 11am!)\n\nThe pleasant waitress brought to us the coffee we ordered right away. It was good coffee and a good sign, we thought. We then ordered some of our favorite tapas: croquetas, gambas al ajillo, d√°tiles rellenos. We also ordered caldo Gallego and French toast.\n\nOverall there was failure of flavor. The croquetas, a variation with both ham and chicken had  the right texture, but had a flavorless weak bechamel. They were served with a sauce was very close to velveeta cheese. The gambas  were tough and accompanied by another a weak and flavorless sauce. The d√°tiles were good  in flavor but  absurdly tiny. The caldo might have been more satisfactory if it had stewed more and if the chorizo were better quality. The French toast had good texture but also lacked flavor.\n\nThe Bloody Mary had not enough tomato flavor or vodka and no horse radish-\n\nI hope the kitchen will go back to the drawing board and build this  potentially great tapa menu up from a much richer Spanish flavor base.\n\nPlease  also make sure staff is clear about what ‚Äúlive‚Äù means, or bring in some of the great Flamenco artists in the area to perform every once and a while. People will love it and come back!!\n\nYou have the right idea‚Ä¶ please just dig deeper!\n\nWith respect and best wishes for great success!!'

Hansel Cabrera, a week ago, 3, 'The 3 stars is really for the staff, they were very nice and attentive to us. Food service was good and quick. Just needed a bit more seasoning. Will try it again maybe it was an off night for the kitchen or just our plate. Everyone around us seemed to be injoying their food or maybe it was the drinks'

Monica Cotallat, a week ago, 3, 'I went here on their 1st day of business. The staff seemed pleasant and the space looks nice. I was excited to have this in Hoboken‚Äôs restaurant scene. The food wasn‚Äôt bad but it was on the bland side. Drinks were yummy. Presentation and quantity was nice but it wasn‚Äôt authentic. I guess that‚Äôs why they are calling themselves ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Spanish cuisine. The waitress got my order wrong but they quickly made up for it so I won‚Äôt hold it against her.\nSangria won‚Äôt be my 1st to go spot for tapas especially since I live close to an amazing tapas spot a few towns away but it has a good enough vibe to bring me back.\nHowever I am disappointed as I tried to arrange a small brunch party and never got a response. I called on a Saturday early evening and no response, I emailed, no response, I called again for someone to tell me the manager will call me back in 20mins. That was 4 days ago. Never got a call back. I now booked my brunch party elsewhere and for this reason I may not give them another shot.\nNevertheless I do wish them success. Maybe they are working out the kinks.'

Nathaniel Brown, 2 weeks ago, 2, 'I was here two days after it opened and then yesterday - about another two weeks later. This place is just a big, "Meh". I had very high hopes but the food just isn\'t good. The first time I was here the bread was stale - chalked it up to opening woes. The bread was better the second time around. The food however, even though there is nice variety, remained just sub par. Tomato based sauces taste canned. Meat is okay. The only plus side are the drinks and friendly staff.'
Edwin Collado, 2 weeks ago, 1, 'Mediocre! (To say the least)\nWhere should I start: ü§î\nMe and my girlfriend stopped here just to give it a chance because we live in the neighborhood on a fly. We decided to do several apps to test the waters because we‚Äôve had some amazing Tapas from other reputable institutions in the Hudson County area.\n1. The empanadas? EMPANADAS???? They tasted and looked like they went down the block, got the frozen ‚ÄúGoya‚Äù Empanada tortillas, cooked some ground beef and stuffed them closed with a good old fork like my aunt used to do in her kitchen. Only they tasted like my little brother made them üòù.\n2. Avocado stuffed w/ shrimp? How about an avocado cut in half on a plate with mildly seasoned ceviche thrown on a plate.\n3. Ordered a Churrasco cooked medium, got a kids sized piece of pepper corned leather with a pile of potatoes and Brussel sprouts, Left half of the suede on the plate.\n\nThen last but not least, let‚Äôs go with the waitress and staff, took 25 mins to be sniffed at for an order and she couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how she eats on Bergenline Ave ‚Äúwink, wink‚Äù. Almost as if she wanted to advise us to RUN AND RUN FAST! We should‚Äôve read the signs. This place is a knee slapping joke and a far cry from true Tapas. Mark my words, Although I wish all new businesses well, unfortunately, if they don‚Äôt upgrade the food quality, they will shut their doors.'
Amir Zeenreich, 2 weeks ago, 4, "3.5 stars, it's someplace between average and good\n\n3 stars = average\n4 stars = good\n\nPros -\nGood portions for the price (there were 4 of us. We got the patatas bravas, 2 skirt steaks with cheese, avocado and shrimps, beef empanadas, bowl of mushrooms, the lava cake and a pitcher of blood orange sangria and the bill came up to 123$ - not bad)\nService was great, super friendly and very quick\nThe food quality was mostly above average (patatas very very good and the skirt steak was delicious)\n\nCons -\nThe dishes can look nicer (patatas bravas looked great, but that's it). The bowl of mushrooms just looked cheap...\nThe skirt steak should either be cut or not served on a piece of bread. You'll have trouble using your teeth alone to cut it\nSomething about the facade just says 'average', can't put my finger on it\nThe sangria was meh. For a place called sangria, they should take it up a notch. Wouldn't mind paying more and get a high quality sangria (check out the sangria they serve at Olivia in Hoboken, for example)\n\nAll in all, we'll come back - but I'm not counting the minutes to our next visit or dreaming about this food at night"
Emily A, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'The food was INCREDIBLE and the sangria was very good. The staff was fabulous. I almost took a star away because i think the decor could have been redone a little better to make it more of a cool vibe but overall it was a great experience and i will definitely be going back for happy hour and dinners.'
