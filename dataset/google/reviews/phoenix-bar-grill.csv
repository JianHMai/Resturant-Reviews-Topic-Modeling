Dominick Ogrodowicz, 2 years ago, 4, "Inside Hoboken station.  Nothing fancy but a good spot to wait for your train.  Happy hour specials are usually pretty good.  Only complaint is sometimes they play the music so loud that you can't hear yourself think"
Jim Pezzillo, 2 years ago, 1, "Nothing worse to me than a place stating to be open for business at 12pm on Saturday and you are standing outside its doors at 1pm and it still isn't open. Must be run by millenials."

Bill Segulin, 2 years ago, 5, 'My new favorite place.  Carlos and Margo are spot on hosts. This is a great place for a quick drink or bite to eat... very tasty food not the blah bar grub you get elsewhere.  Social and friendly like a local pub conveniently located in Hoboken train station. Even first timers will feel like locals.'

Kitty Slaughter, 2 years ago, 5, "I might be biased, but I have to say, best and sweetest bar tenders you will ever meet.  I'm here often, and I will always come back.  Waiting in Hoboken for your train?  Come here!  Get a drink!  Have some popcorn and let Carlos or Margo help you.  Carlos is fab!  They really get into the holidays as well!  We went for Halloween and LOVED the Vegas theme.  I'm originally from Vegas so it was a whole lot of fun for me.  Great bar!"

Clarine Pitts, 2 years ago, 4, 'the truffle fries were amazing. i loved my kale ceaser salad. the Hoboken was full of ice and it was filled halfway. also i wish they had more Hoboken options and they would let us sit in the booth. Overall very cute place. I love the decoration and vibe.'

Sean Wilson, 3 years ago, 1, '‚Äú Closing ‚Äú and almost closed are two different things - why keep posted hours if your bit going to honor them ??  And the bartender was just plain rude about it - last time I checked the bar business is customer driven , luckily there‚Äôs plenty of other establishments right up the block - I‚Äôd take your money else where but be carful not to miss your train lol'

Michael Piracci, 4 years ago, 5, "Best place to wait for a train. Great staff,  good prices and nice atmosphere. I've missed more than one train sitting at the bar here."
Julia Solomon, 4 years ago, 5, "Nice bar while waiting for the train. Staff is great, food is great and prices are just right. I laughed when my wings were handed over to the bartender by a man wearing a Sbarro shirt. I think there's one next door and they have  contract with them or something lol"
BroadwayCJ97, 4 years ago, 1, 'The bartender (older woman who "has been there for 26 years") is a complete jerk! Scolds me when I order water instead of a beer and ask her to put the Yankees game on at 10:30 PM. Your job is to SERVE in the SERVICE industry, not tell me what you think I should do. I still tipped even with the horrible service but if you have a chance to get a drink before your train, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!'
