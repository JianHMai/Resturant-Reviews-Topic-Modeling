Marlon Vite, 2 weeks ago, 3, "I hope you find this information useful, hurting this business is far from my intention, quite the opposite, I don't really like this type of food this is why I don't eat it often but I guess other people love it, I was invited to invite 2 ladies, sisters, one my girlfriend, I paid the bill as it may be expected and it is normal for me to generously do .... our 3 dishes were a combination of the same ingredients except the drinks .... the flavors were good, temperature could have been warmer, our 3 dishes included bbq beef, tasty which had plenty of beef fibers, ligaments and or tendons which the chef did not remove prior to grilling it and serving it so we had to chew until it was too difficult, cumbersome and we had to shamefully but diplomatically remove it from our mouths into napkins .... I would have to try all other dishes to be fair in my public opinion but I will not be able to anytime soon, I wished the grilled tasty meat had no tendons in it oh well, we ate 90% and mine made me sleepy soon after so I believe it was nutritious...."

Thought beef was a little chewy but bowl still tasty. Also got Shrimp burrito. The bowl and burrito were to have sauces but nothing came on them. I recommend extra sauces like Clinatro lime or Katsu on the side. I was very impressed overall and would recommend to anyone who like Korean fast food.'
Xauen Zirpolo, a year ago, 2, "Ordered a bulgogi beef burrito on the way back from the path. Everything about it was tasty- the beef, spicy sour cream, onions- but the kimchi fried rice I got in the burrito was a complete turnoff. I love kimchi, and kimchi fried rice is usually a favorite of mine! But however they prepared theirs lacked that great sour, pungent flavor that kimchi usually has, and was actually unpleasant to eat with the burrito. I bet if I went back and ordered it without the kimchi, it'd be much more delicious."

Morgan Philips, 2 years ago, 1, "I originated from New York to attempt the pullover Verison of Gogi Grill, in light of the fact that the one they had in New York is extremely insipid, the client benefit was ludicrous. I as of late obtained a combo in the Hoboken zone. I went to the acknowledgment that the administration is extremely poor and amateurish, wrongdoing, on the off chance that I was the storekeeper I would be exceptionally vexed. By the looks of it I feel terrible awful for the representatives they look awkward like they are caught creatures. Slaving endlessly, running forward and backward and they way that they demonstration isn't right and I completely comprehend why they do it. Yet, that is one thing the nourishment is over estimated! For a bowl resembles 10-20$. That bowl must be made out of gold to be requested once more. The taste is insipid, the store is dull, the client benefit is frightful. As a fruitful specialist I would prescribe to eat some place that merits your cash and time"

Went there this evening before work and tried out the bowl for the first time and it was so yummy. I got the Korean Fried Rice and chicken breast, and for the sides I had the water cress, spicy slaw, cheese and sriracha sour cream.
