Lauren Dziubinsky, a month ago, 5, 'I cannot say enough amazing things about this place: from the venue to the food to the people, Justin and his team are so accommodating and easy to work with.  He customized the menu for our half jamaican family and all were incredibly impressed and asked to take home leftovers!\nThe food is outrageous: not your typical catering.  Delicious and beautifully presented (white platters no chafing dishes).  Youâ€™ll want to eat the marinara with a spoon.\n\nThe backyard is adorable and spacious: easily fit 50 people.\n\nWe will find reasons to celebrate and always make One12 our first destination.  We will be back often as soon as we finish these amazing leftovers.'

I'm so happy this restaurant opened so close to home.ðŸ˜Š The back patio is a pleasure to hang out in, the service is impeccable, and everyone is super friendly.

Daniel Kolic, 3 months ago, 5, "This new spot in Hoboken is the place to be if you want an amazing meal! I have had breakfast and lunch there on multiple occasions and have never left disappointed!\n\nThe restaurant is impeccable, very tastefully decorated and all of the staff always has a smile on their face, it doesn't matter if it's 7 am or 7 pm.\n\nFor breakfast, the breakfast burrito or the healthy wrap is an excellent choice. The breakfast sandwiches are phenomenal as well.\n\nThe specials are updated daily and all taste amazing. I especially loved their taco Tuesday's, you can tell that all of their food is fresh and that they use the best ingredients in their meals. Ever since my first visit, I have been back multiple times and plan to continue to visit. When you visit don't forget to try one of their tasty rice balls or their famous chicken cutlets! You won't be disappointed!"

Richard Fedor, 7 months ago, 5, "Recently had a small gathering at our house that One12 catered which was incredible.  Our guests couldn't say enough wonderful things about the food.  The Sloppy Giuseppe,  the mini rice balls, the finger sandwiches of eggplant/roasted peppers/fresh mozzarella and the mixed roasted veggies plater were a hit. Then we brought out the desserts of chocolate brownies,  blonde brownies and apple tarts.....our guests were blown away with how fresh everything was,  how creamy and delicious.  They want to know when they can  come over again if One12 will be providing the food. Thank you so much for thinking of everything and letting us just enjoy the afternoon."
