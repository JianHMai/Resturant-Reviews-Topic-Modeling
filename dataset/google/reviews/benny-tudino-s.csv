Tracie Lutz, 4 days ago, 1, "Ordered through Uber eats for delivery: A pizza I will never forget and not in a good way!\nHonestly I am not even sure what this pizza was and have never seen anything like it. Opened the lid and thought it was a joke. This is far from a veggie and meat pizza that I've seen. The pizza was so heavy and soggy by the time it was delivered it was starting to fall through the bottom of the box. Needless to say this pizza went right down to the trash!\nUber Eats total cost all in: $57.00 down the trash"

Instead of taking the order they made sure I was aware of the the price of 34.00 dollars and when I returned to add to my order they mentioned that my order had to be handled in cash, cash only, which also surprised me since I've paid with my credit and debit cards many times.

My sister had her dog with her and the waitress refused to take our orders while we had the dog and suggested we tie the dog to a fence five feet away from our table. The dog was not in any way excitable and was just chilling. Almost every other place we've eaten at on Washington has been fine and they've even give us a bowl of water for the dog to drink under the table. She refused to take our orders and kept blaming other people saying they had an issue with it and that she couldn't serve us in case someone came to eat who was allergic. When we walked by a few days later there were other dogs with customers and I wonder if maybe it's just one waitress who is the problem. Unfortunately we'll never know as we're never going to try to eat here again."

I even offered to pre pay the tip and any difference in price if that were the case. They still said no. Extremely upset! They‚Äôre rather give the table to a customer that would probably only order a slice or two, instead of accommodating my family and I who had spent $75!!!!'

The crust of every pizza is so crispy and have lots of mozzarella cheese. The place has a comfortable atmosphere and the staffs are very accommodating."

I bought one of there Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday special only, and the pizza was just tasteless, very greasy, and cheese was falling right off it! Don't get me started with the wings, breaded and cooked like a it was home made or something it was bad! Plus its being managed by a bunch of Egyptains! they are not only cheap! but also just terrible in the pizza business!\n\nMy recommendation is STAY AWAY FROM THEM, any other pizza joint in Hoboken or Jersey City is better then them!\n\nOh don't forget they are overpriced in my opinion, 5$ for their big slice!!!! !!EW!! for $5 dollars I can get 5 slices across the river!! stay away from them!!!\n\nP.S. they only take cash! take your business elsewhere folks"
