Meidos De Jes√∫s, a week ago, 5, ''
Lauren Reich, 3 weeks ago, 5, "I've been to House of Que 5 times and I've had a wonderful experience every single time. I am not even a huge meat/BBQ eater but the food here is so good and so is the 512 sauce which I would eat just by itself if possible. The sides are all delicious but the corn pudding is above and beyond. I dream about it, I think about it all the time, I wish I was eating it right now. I don't even have photos of the food because I eat it all so quickly my brain doesn't have time to process the idea of taking a photo. I've also had a GREAT time at Dueling Pianos (I'm the nerd asking for them to play Hamilton.) I highly recommend stopping by!"

Joe Tomic, 4 weeks ago, 1, 'Not one to write reviews, as I don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs opinion should deter you from having a good time. With that being said, I have never been treated as poorly as I did on Saturday afternoon. It was my friends 27th birthday and we arrived at House of Que in great spirits. Unfortunately I could not say the same for some of the Saturday staff. As soon as we sat down, the bartenders grew visibly upset and our entire group became uncomfortable (about 20 of us). We ordered food and drinks and did our best to enjoy our company! Over time, we went from being unhappily served to completely overlooked. If the bar was busy, thats completely understandable - it wasn‚Äôt. When we inquired if there was a problem, one of the bartenders called my girlfriend a rude name that I don‚Äôt plan on repeating. Shortly after, I was told we would no longer be served for the ‚Äúsafety of others.‚Äù No reason was provided. Rude servers, rude security staff, and an overall poor experience. Hoboken has plenty of phenomenal places to spend a beautiful Saturday afternoon, this is not one of them!'

Advait Gharat, a month ago, 4, "The ambiance was amazing. There was karaoke, which was great. Super sweet and helpful staff. The chicken burger wasn't the best, but wasn't bad either. My friends who had the beef burger liked it. All kinds of fries were amazing. The normal ones were better than the curly tho."
Anastasiia S, a month ago, 1, "If you don't know how to pack your food for takeout so it's not all mushy and gross then don't give the takeout option. All containers were crushed, food is bland and all our family feeling sick now. Don't ever recommend anyone to eat here üëé"

She was on top of everything and when the chefs messed up our food she took it back and gave us the correct food no extra charge or argument, even added a "im so sorry" to it. The food was decnet, not some jawdropper and pricing is expensive but these are still very good prices for hoboken waterfront. Side note, parking is difficult to find in hovoken but its not the restaurants fault. Great spot to go to if you are just in hoboken relaxing and want some food. Be careful for families because the music is very very loud. Overall decent food, great experience, and amazing service by Vanessa. Would recommend.'

I ordered a special that comes with 2 sides. When I placed the order he forgot to take the time to ask about the side dishes. While I ordered appetizers, I received the entrees almost immediately after getting the appetizers. The pulled pork that I ordered was bland and without seasoning. I had to take bbq sauce from another table to give it any taste.  My advice to the managers would be to retrain your wait staff and do not allow food to be served without any seasoning'

Edwin Cabrera, 4 months ago, 1, 'On Friday June 25th 2021 at approximately 3pm My friend and myself went to try this place out in Hoboken and spoke to the waiter ( white bearded male with a fohawk style hair) attended us, and told us to sit down outside. I use the word ‚Äúattend‚Äù loosely, but he brought us our waters and said he would be back shortly. Well 25 minutes passed and he never came to attend us so we decided to leave. No exaggeration because I used the time of parking meter app as reference. The restaurant was not busy at all, had about 5 tables all whom their foods were already serve, but it was obvious the waiter kept avoiding us on purpose. Why, because Every time I‚Äôll attempt to make eye contact he would turn his back and do casual conversation with other tables who already order their food. It‚Äôs a shame because the menu looked appetizing and I was craving the House of Que burger, but it was upsetting we got no service by any of the staff. It‚Äôs worth noting everyone outside was as being treated except us, maybe because we were the only minorities in the restaurant? Prejudice? I‚Äôm sure it was not that‚Ä¶I just went to the restaurant that is right next door, pricer; but at least they  treat everyone equally.'
A.K. Walker, 4 months ago, 3, "The views and location are the greatest asset to this spot. You can walk off your food after indulging in your favorite BBQ meals. I felt a little risky and selected the Sloppy Texan. Unfortunately, the flavors didn't spark my taste buds. The good thing about this restaurant is the size. There was plenty of room for bigger groups. Seems like a great spot to drink and watch the games."

Brandon Pollock, 4 months ago, 2, "Only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because our waitress was nice. Everything else about this dinner was terrible. Sangria pitcher was mostly ice, came out to three full drinks, tasted like Kool Aid. Beer tower came next, the beer was stale. We ordered wings to start, the wings weren't bad, but the oversaturation of sauce made them bad. The wings weren't tossed in sauce, they had sauce globbed all over the top... awful. Our entrees came next, 2 ribs plates, 1 brisket sandwich, and 3 sides of mac and cheese and cornbread. Everything came out cold. It took forever to come out, which is fine because the place was busy, but this made me believe our food was just sitting on the counter and nobody came to get it so it was served to us cold. Ribs lacked flavor, brisket sandwich was dry, mac and cheese was standard, cornbread was also dry.\n\nNot sure what happened to this place, but it has serious glaring issues. This is not good BBQ, and I will most likely never be coming back."

Before we even get to price our party was already turned off as we approached the podium to be seated we were not greeted warmly, as we felt like what do you want, later I was told the guy was a manager named Zeus that was covering the podium 5/1 late afternoon...as I was not in a mood to make this a race thing I proceeded and decided to see how this played out. One thing these establiments need to realize is you never know WHO is walking thru your doors...well today it was a YELPER & a Google Review Guru with over 2.5 MILLION views of my pic\'s etc. So after the rude approach upon seating us, we were seated and not really feeling the seating we asked if we could change the young man said oh you have to ask the guy at the podium..after how we felt.. I refused and was annoyed as we asked you and you work there and I need you to go inquire for me as a customer. We moved.\nVanessa came and introduced herself she was nice and professional- Service was ok. Food was Super overpriced and we ordered these "48 hour wings" which were OK, tasted like the same wings I make in my air fryer and 6 wings for 14.00? Air fryer wings?? The Cowgirl drink was nice. We ordered burgers and fries. Burger was good and flavorful. Our bill was 140.00.\n3 drinks, 3 meals, & 6 wings & order or fries.\nThe liquor store and Five Guys may have been a cheaper option LOL  #YOLO'

Adam Knuckey, 6 months ago, 2, 'Don‚Äôt order meat if you go later at night.\n\nIt seems that once they start focusing on the drinking crowd, the quality of the food goes way down. I ordered the brisket and the pork shoulder, neither at all cheap. The brisket was cold, incredibly dry, and lacking in any flavor. I only ended up eating half of it despite not having eaten at all that day. The pork shoulder was ok, but definitely not the quality I‚Äôd expect from a place calling itself the ‚Äúhouse of ‚Äòque‚Äù.\n\nHonestly I think they just took some leftovers out of the fridge and microwaved them for a few minutes. Only sauce I was given to go with it all was a small cup of ketchup, but I assume that was for my onion rings, which were very delicious and I‚Äôd absolutely recommend. Not sure if there‚Äôs normally a tasty sauce or two that I should have received to go with my meat.\n\nMusic was loud enough that, even yelling, my friends and I struggled to hear each other across the table, and we were on the other side of the restaurant from the music booth. Catching up with an old friend I hadn‚Äôt seen in a while was a challenge, we both had to lean over the table and I had to scream directly into his ear for him to catch everything I was saying.\n\nOld Fashioned I ordered was strong but not well balanced in flavor at all.\n\nWe had a reservation but didn‚Äôt get seated until about 30 minutes after that time.\n\nThings are priced pretty highly for the small portions and low quality.\n\nVery understaffed, service is at best ok.\n\nNot going to come back, there are definitely better places in Hoboken that would be higher on my list.'

We got 2 tables party of 6 each. They separated our tables and when we tried to talk to each other by getting up to go to other table to celebrate my other nieces birthday they made us sit back at our tables.  We spent alot of money that night to be treated wrong especially when my one niece planned this and they said we can all be together.

Digital Smooth, 9 months ago, 3, "Went in with high hopes. Great location and view. Service was nice, fast and accurate. I heard about the pulled pork sandwich so i tried that. Nothing special - small portions, more bun than i would have thought. If you can close the bun on the sandwich and not see the pork, it's too small. Basic, untoasted, flavorless bun. The pork itself with the bbq sauce was okay but nothing to remember. The portion of fries was too big. Everyone ate about half their order (fries do not come with the sandwich). Surprisingly there was no pulled chicken.\nAlthough i didn't have any, i heard the sangria was very good (designated driver). Our bbq chicken strips were basic breaded chicken strips slathered in a house bbq sauce - they should have been grilled. Nothing like spending $16 on an app for some frozen strips! The nachos were seemingly enjoyed by the table. Go for a drink and some nachos and enjoy the view.\nAs a big fan of bbq perhaps i expected more (which i did).\nWith so many options in Hoboken, you need to stand out, but they don't - not foodwise."

Drinks were horrible server kept talking to my guest and not me even though I was paying and made the reservations and all. I was excited to get bbq after moving here a month ago from down south.

At the entrance, we were greeted by several doormen at once. Not sure if they were all bouncers, but kind of odd for a relatively quiet place. But, we were quickly seated at a table near the bar area.\n\nFood was very overpriced, but at least it was very good. Bud light drafts were on special for $4, but server still charged our first beers at $6 each just 5 minutes prior to happy hour starting which was not cool, but otherwise waitress was friendly and attentive.\n\nCountry music DJ was great and played both our song requests.  I noticed it started getting a little more busy by 7pm. There was a notice on their menu stating table time limit was 1.5 hrs, but I guess since it wasn't too busy, they didn't enforce it.

This place is right along the river and among other nice bars. The waitress was very nice and helpful to us as well.\n\nCONS: There's no parking except for the street but of course thats hoboken which is why I haven't lowered their rating. Other than that they're pretty good.\n\nOVERALL: If you do decide to come here I recommend the smoked wings. Unfortunately they're bone not boneless but its worth it. If you're in the area this is a better place to eat at compared to other places. I would make a reservation before trying to grab a seat as a walk-in"
Vickie Jones, a year ago, 3, 'It was cold outside.  Our nice waiter Ricky switched us to a table with a heater after our drinks.  Ricky was wonderful!!!The 48 hr smoked wings were good.  The corn pudding was good.  The Texas slaw had too much vinegar.  The view was beautiful but it was too cold for outdoor seating.  I would have enjoyed being inside to enjoy the live band, but we were told that there was a private event going on when we arrived.  Later, we learned that it was not a private event.  I should have been notified of this when I phoned about my Open Table reservation.  I notified the staff that we were celebrating a bday.  It was not acknowledged and nothing was offered to the bday celebrant.'

We got there and waited 20 mins to be served. Got our drinks and then waited another 50 mins for APPETIZERS. The food arrived cold and tasteless. The wings were also disgusting. Go somewhere else. Additional negative points for college kids everywhere. Some girl was also throwing up in the toilet.'
Kensy, a year ago, 5, 'I completely forgot to write this review but this place has excellent customer service. The first time I went there was 1 years ago and I enjoyed it so much I decided to take my family out there once we all got a chance. When the time was appropriate for every we went. Walking in I expected the same friendly customer service which I didn‚Äôt receive, (side note: is was not busy at all) then our host sat us down and told us that they take care of us. The table we sat down at was FILTHY!!! The bench was sticky and the table. So I decided to swap the bench for another one, and all the workers watch me and our host came over and told me that she watched me move everything and try to clean up the table. That was very awkward. To continue with that night when I was served my meal was incorrect and what the gentle did was take it back and wipe off the food with his hands and give me back the plate. I was amazed but such horrible  service especially when I made everyone excited to walk in this restaurant. After I finish that meal I did not tip, but everyone else in my family did. My reason for not tipping was because our waiter didn‚Äôt give us her name, she had a nasty attitude and also never checked up on us, and she blatantly watch me clean a table and bench that should of been clean. Now as we leave the restaurant we are taking pictures and the host comes out and helps us. As we‚Äôre taking photos we notice the waiter we had staring through the window sticking up her middle finger. Then as we walked away she walked out the restaurant and started to curse all of us out. Instead of any of us give back negative energy I contact the manger, and regional manger. The manger of House Que name was Zues. I can‚Äôt remember the the regional at the moment (sorry man!!) however they both contacted me and invited us to comeback which we did but they were our waiters which was a huge surprise. Not only that they apologize to all of us individually. Then gave us a on house free meal and drinks on every single thing we did. I was not expecting it at all but what really made my night was that we told them to stay around and join us which they did and the negative experience we had before went away. The waiter that cursed us out ended up getting terminated from her position and they even explain that they have had a meeting with every single staff member to reassure the rules in a restaurant ‚Äúworld‚Äù. Overall the reason why I give it 5 stars is because of the great service and the food was more of a 3.8 -4.0 but the overall experiences were great. THANK YOU HOUSE OF QUE HOPEFULLY I CAN COME BACK WITH MY FAMILY AGAIN.'

Joan Lazar, a year ago, 2, 'Purely a review of the food, as I ordered take out and did not dine in (quarantine life).\n\nBackstory: I worked at one of the best barbecue places in the states, I tasted a LOT Of barbecue from neighboring restaurants in NYC and Brooklyn. I have tasted incredible barbecue and i\'ve tasted mediocre bbq.\n\nWell, this was mediocre. The brisket was hard, chewy, lacked flavor, and appeared grossly overdone. The rub was minimal, it didn\'t have that "supple fall off the imaginary bone" texture. I have a feeling it wasn\'t even cooked in a smoker, but if it was was, it definitely was rushed at a far too high temp. I was not impressed. It was almost rubbery.\n\nThe mac and cheese was acceptable, but not great.\n\nThe brisket chili had... giant chunks of hard brisket in it. I was hoping they\'d be shredded. Not impressed.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were okay, nothing impressive there.\n\nThe manager was a little stand-off-ish, to be understood, we\'re going through some tough times.\n\nOverrall, would not visit again.'

Do not try this putrid concoction called a Que Margarita.  It was the most disgusting cocktail I ever drank. Service was very good, although the waitress comes around less once the music starts. Aside from that awful Que Margarita, I would definitely go back to this place."

reshma srinivas, 2 years ago, 2, "Went there a few weeks ago for weekend brunch , their were hardly any waiters and no one bothered checking on us / catering. Being a vegetarian, it's tough. But I was taken aback that the veggie burrito that me and my friend ordered had a piece of meat in it !\n\nWhen we informed the waiter, he said sorry and to just take off the piece of meat and eat the rest.\nIt was unacceptable that they could do this. I would never return to this place again."

Eduardo Rodriguez, 2 years ago, 1, 'The sign in their door said they close at midnight on Mondays.  We called before we went there and the person that answered the phone said that they were open until midnigh. We got there at 10:30 PM and the place was closed.'

Stephen Harris, 2 years ago, 1, "My girlfriend and I went on a Friday around 6:30pm.  We both ordered sandwiches; I had the pulled pork.  On both the meat was barely warm, tending towards cold.  I ordered a Stella to drink, but got something different.  When I sent it back the waitress never replaced it until I complained and then she gave me another drink that wasn't Stella.\n\nThe next day my girlfriend had a stomach upset; we can only presume it was due to the almost cold meat.\n\nDefinitely won't go back here!"

Joe C, 2 years ago, 2, 'I am in awe that this place has gotten above 4 stars for their food. Please people, expand your horizons and venture to Texas, NC, etc. to try real barbecue! Dueling pianos and the drinks are definitely the highlight of this place.\n\nAs far as the food, the ribs and brisket had my stomach in knots, and I have been here multiple times. Be prepared the next morning...\n\nI think they should consider calling the restaurant something else, because the "\'cue" is misleading for what barbecue should taste like'
