Peter Cedeno, a month ago, 5, 'A hidden Gem in Hoboken. Food is genuinely Amazing in a very welcoming environment followed by a Staff that is on Point. Full disclosure, i am not too much into Mexican cuisine But Bajas has coming back again and again. 😋🤗😋'
Tim Riggins, a month ago, 1, 'Without a doubt, the worst restaurant I have ever been too. From the rude owner, AWFUL service, to their new increasing prices. If you go to Baja, you’ll stand like an idiot inside the waiting for a table. Staff will walk past you, like you don’t exist. Finally (after 10 minutes minimum) someone will say “oh, do you want a table?” As if they’re surprised you’re there to eat. Once sat down, let the timer begin! If you get a drink within 20 minutes, congrats you’re the first I’ve ever heard of. Anything can be saved with good food and drinks right? Too bad you’re at Baja, you won’t be getting either. Overpriced weak margaritas, bad tacos and the greatest sin a Mexican restaurant can commit, awful tortillas. I never review restaurants, but the combination of bad food, overpriced drinks and rude staff made me irate. Do NOT come here.'

We asked for their hottest hot sauce and she was nice enough to bring a milder version.  That was the best because we could t handle the hottest 😊\n\nWe had two special margarita. A fajita a camarones and a chicken fajita.  The chicken fajita was a generous portion. Shrimp fajita was reasonable.\nLove that it came with guacamole and beans\n\nVery reasonably priced.

We did outdoor seating and it was really nice. My boyfriend and I both ordered alcoholic drinks and I was shocked that we had to buy bottled water - no tap. They charged us for the water, but I never received a bottle. For a dollar not a huge deal but kind of annoying as a whole.\n\nWe got a chorizo quesdilla as an app and 10/10 recommend! It was so freaking good. We didn't get little plates and chorizo is messy, again not a huge deal just an inconvenience. I highly recommend their steak burrito, the meat is actually really tastey and the burrito is huge! Overall would definitely recommend!"

Service in the igloo was excellent but the hostess initially seemed annoyed to have to go out in the cold. The menu is VERY limited so check it out prior to going as you will need to spend a minimum of $250 during the week. They do automatically add gratuity to the bill so take note of that. What we did eat was very good but was missing one thing...MARCUS WHERE WAS THE SALT?? You would have been chopped!!! The experience did offer a 5 star view and atmosphere.

Seda Arca, a year ago, 5, 'First time, I went to this Mexican restaurant today in Hoboken. I cannot describe my satisfaction here. Everything was delicious!! Yes, It’s still pandemic and there was almost no customers inside. We wanted to support local businesses in Hoboken. Most of the restaurants are closed on Monday in Hoboken. Baja is the one of the open places. We ordered Baja combo which is chicken, beef, shrimp. It served with rice, avocado, black beans, sour cream and warm wrap (It’s for 2 ppl but enough for 3 ppl too). After we ordered our food, they treated us with a nice nachos with salsa sauce. The waitress who is really nice and polite ,served our dinner 15-20 min later. (I am sorry that I didn’t ask your name). Food was Fantastic!!!!!  I’m a picky person. I only eat in certain places ( old fashioned woman) and I’m so happy to find out this place today!! I cannot wait to come back with my family and friends. Thanks for everything guys!!!\nPlease, support local businesses due of pandemic. We need each other.\nThank you!'

ashley, a year ago, 5, 'I cannot emphasize enough how great this place is! My bf and I went on a Monday night. It wasn’t busy. We were the second table in there. They first serve you with fresh cooked tortilla chips and salsa. The chips were still warm both times when we asked for seconds. We order house margaritas, one mango and the other, passion fruit. Both are also great. My boyfriend ordered steak fajitas and I ordered Baja steak tacos. We were both mind blown! The seasoning on the steaks are just TO DIE FOR! As much as we tried to continue savoring all that flavor, we were already so stuffed!  As much as prices go, I think it is worth it! I totally recommend trying it out!!'

Amanda Shirley, a year ago, 1, 'The waiter had an earbud in the entire time making it impossible to get his attention. He brought part of meals, and then went missing for over 15 minutes (not bringing the tortillas with a fajita order) to the point where I had to get up and find other staff. The food was also just okay, but mostly disappointing. For example, the guacamole was very pale and hardly verdant so there was definitely filler in it. The avocado crema sauce was actually slightly better guacamole but not a crema sauce at all. And the fish was chewy. They have a good drink deal though, so maybe if you drink enough, you would not mind the experience.'

The layout gave us a limited exposure to the entrance, bar area and other diners, energy/activity, and felt a little isolated. The food was excellent for that type venue but the prices are a bit high for what you get. For example, a Kids Cheeseburger is $9.95. The service was very good and the location is highly accessible. So, only a few dings for some pricing, and seating configuration thats not the fault of ownership. Otherwise very good Mexican food and services!'

Amy Iandoli, 3 years ago, 1, "Horrible service and me and my friends food was cold and horrible. We waited a very long time for the food to come to our table and it was cold and soggy, which means that it was sitting out for awhile. Pricing was outrageous and I don't know how this restaurant has 4 stars. Very disappointing."

Nikki Ghooprasert, 3 years ago, 5, 'Great food. Nice service. I love their Jumbo shrimp fajitas and nacho. Oh.. they make great sangria too. There was one in Jersey city but was closed down. Too bad. Now i have to go allllll the way to Hoboken for that. So from a weekly thing becomes a quarterly thing because of the crazy price of parking fee. Love the food.'

Greg B., 4 years ago, 2, 'I am sorry, but we have tried this place 3 times... all 3 it was really bad. Chicken is horrible and rubber, fajita platter barely had any vegetables with the chicken, food is tasteless, and overall the food is not good. We eat out a ton, never complain, but after 3 tries, this one is over with...Can find much better. Service is fine.'

The food and the drinks were super delicious and they gave me such a beautiful birthday banana with a sparkler.  Would totally recommend this place but I don't want people to know my new favorite place !!"
jas877 sp, 4 years ago, 1, 'I always go here and the food is always great and I usually get great waitresses. However this time we had a male server that we never seen before. We all wanted water and he kept pressuring the table to order drinks even though we said we were fine multiple times. Then made us feel forced to order more food and then leave more than 18% tip. Put 20% tip then our way out still questioned\nthe tip. Very disappointed.'

Brian Luscombe, 6 years ago, 5, 'They make a fajita special for the table - loaded with grilled chicken, steak, onion, peppers, and three different types of shrimp- stuffed, grilled, and sauteed.  Then they serve it to the table with home-made tortillas. Their margaritas are amazing too!'

Matthew Lambert, 8 years ago, 3, "Meh.... This is standard Mexican fare, nothing to write home about. The grilled chicken inside the burrito seemed frozen reheated. North Jersey isn't really known for it's Mexican food. If you're in Hoboken looking for authentic Mexican then keep looking."

lauren deldotto, 9 years ago, 2, 'the food at baja is terrible - just overfried tortillas drenched in nasty, oily cheese.  there is nothing unique, special or even good here.  frozen margharitas are about the only reason to come.'
Willem Klein, 9 years ago, 4, "I ordered the steak chimichanga and it was the BEST mexican dish I have ever had - the steak was cooked perfectly and seasoned spectacularly: both the texture and flavor were phenomenal. The tortilla was fried and was light without being too crunchy - exactly how it should be. I went on a Tuesday night so I can't exactly speak to the service on a busier night, but when I was there the waiter was prompt and our food came out quickly yet not rushed.\n\nThe table salsa and chips were also superb."
Bree K, 9 years ago, 2, 'I wanted to like this place, but alas it was not to be. I was there with two other people early for dinner on a Saturday (5pm-ish). The waiter was strangely smug and purposefully not helpful when we were ordering drinks. The food was okay, but when asked to combine two of our leftovers into one take-home container, only one of the leftovers was actually saved. The best thing at this place was the black bean soup! Seriously, it was amazing - hearty, tasted great, not too salty, and you are brought rice to put with it. I would come back here for the soup only. Otherwise, I was pretty underwhelmed.'
