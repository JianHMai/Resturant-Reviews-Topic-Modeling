Today I ordered on grubhub, didn\'t pay attention to my ETA whatsoever as I\'m in no rush to get my food, and the restaurant called me. The guy I spoke to was extremely apologetic, says they\'re running a little behind, it could be 20-25 minutes late. "This is a once a year kind of situation." I was like dude that\'s absolutely fine with me, doesn\'t matter at all... But the fact that they\'d call about such a minor delay, the attitude it takes to value your customers\' time enough to make them aware of a little longer lead time? That shows great management and a good culture at the restaurant. If you go here, you can know they absolutely care about you and giving you the best experience. Thanks a lot, guys.'

Celeste Perlez, a year ago, 1, 'I would give this place zero stars if I could. First, after placing my order, the man at the register who had glasses was going to fry up some fries. There is a trash can right next to the fryer. He placed the basket on TOP of the trash can filled to the top with trash, filled the basket up with fries, and then placed it in the fryer. Completely unsanitary!!!!!!!!! I ordered a chicken Parmesan sandwich and when I got home to eat it, a disgusted reek filled my apartment! The Parmesan cheese smelled spoilt and I was too grossed out to eat it. This place doesn‚Äôt care about being sanitary OR giving quality good food to their customers.

The printed menu doesn\'t say how much adding onions and peppers would be either so I just declined. When I got back to the office a block away, my "provolone" was super yellow and gushy like whiz.

Sergio Scardigno, 3 years ago, 3, "It's aight. Lots of lettuce, not a lot of meat. Rolls are aight.\n\nEdit for a reply to Midtown: I got the California Chicken sandwich - an item you serve that comes with lettuce. There was a lot of it, and very little chicken, that's objective. I'm also 100% Italian, and my grandparents used to own Sasso's Deli, and we always got fresh bread from Rockland Bakery. I know what good bread is, I'm offended you would even call that into question. And we certainly put more meat (quality meat, too) on our sandwiches when we owned the place. Take notes."
Joshua Linguine, 3 years ago, 5, "I walked into Midtown Philly on a cold winter's night whilst craving some late night munchies. It was 10 minutes before closing time. Some meanie from earlier that night had ordered 4 cheesesteaks and never picked them up. My man Jinesh offered to give them to me all 4 for only the price of 2 cheesteaks. It blew my flippin' mind. I ate 2 of them that very night, gave one to my good friend Soup as a favor for accompanying me on my quest, and had one for a delicious breakfast in the morning. Easily one of the best nights of my life.\nAnother time I was on a date with a fine lady, and took her to none else but Midtown. As we were making small chatter, talking about our hopes and dreams, one of the other workers (I forgot his name) gave us a complementary order of Cajun fries. We're not dating anymore, but god damn those Cajun fries were tasty.\nIt's the generosity of people like Jinesh and the other employees of Midtown that make the world go round. Their cheesesteak sandwiches, AKA ambrosial meat and cheese generously stuffed between the supple loaves of fresh bread, absent of lettuce (as a cheesteak should be), are a must have for any Hoboken native. Midtown is not only LGBT+ friendly, but Wizard friendly! Even to wizards who are quite powerful and have a fixation for Gatorade."

Richard Cunningham, 4 years ago, 1, "I have ordered pretty regularly from these guys in the past. I like the food. Tonight the delivery guy turned up with a dollar change and stiffed me on the tip. No apology, he thought it was funny. Walked off with 30%. So that will be the last time I order. Hope his employer thinks it funny because I'm not laughing."

Tobias Noll, 4 years ago, 4, "The food here is really good, and some things are very unique. The combinations here also don't sound like they would work (For example, the pizza cheese steak) but they taste very good, so feel free go go a little outside your comfort zone, I did, and I haven't been disappointed.\nPrices are quite good as well, I'm always filled up for around $10. In Hoboken, this is around average, maybe a bit cheaper.\nOne warning though: if something sounds spicy, it is, and it is probably twice as spicy as it sounds. Don't worry though, it always tastes good.\nDelivery can be take a bit of time, but they don't advertise 30 minute delivery to my knowledge, so I don't hold it against them. The food arrives hot, so no complaints there. It generally arrives in around 45 minutes for me. The delivery drivers have been rude at times, but I'm not paying for a smile, I'm paying for food, so I don't mind much.\nThe quality is hit or miss though, sometimes  (Very infrequently) I find that the food is really greasy, but other times (Most of the time)  it's perfectly fine. If they could get that worked out, I would definitely give it full marks."

Nadir Johnson, 4 years ago, 2, "not a fan of their customer service...\n\n1. The person who took the order had a attitude saying they couldn't hear me.\n\n2. He never asked for my phone number just name, address and payment info.\n\n3. Delivery person also had a attitude saying I should have given my phone number if he had to contact me. Granted I had my food delivered to the same address a couple months back. The delivery person said no I didn't because they don't deliver to my area."

Melanie Tam, 5 years ago, 4, "I ordered from Midtown Philly after a late night out because I was craving a philly and it was one of the only places open at that hour, which served one. I ordered a chipotle philly and to meet my minimum, I opted for a side of cajun fries. I don't know if the quality has gone up since the last time I ordered, or if not a lot of people order at that time so they just put in more effort, but I really enjoyed it! I especially loved the Cajun fries because even after 30 minutes + of delivery time, they were still hot and crispy, which is pretty impressive. I might need to pop in for an actual visit next time. This way, it'll taste even better, and I won't have pay that pesky little $3 delivery fee,"
Quinn Kerrigan, 5 years ago, 5, 'I come here very often in between classes or after the gym for a quick bite to eat. Service is always fast and easy.

Today however there was an issue with the delivery of our food and the owner of Midtown P.Steak worked very well with fixing all the issues we ran into tonight. The food here is excellent and I never thought about what customer service was like at M.P.S., after speaking with the owner ship it's definitely a 10/10 customer service approach. Thanks to all for fixing the issue tonight and the great food!"

Sarah Lim, 5 years ago, 1, 'I ordered a philly steak & sweet potato fries for delivery via Yelp. I normally don\'t like philly steaks but thought the cherry peppers and grilled pineapple sounded good so I got that. The delivery took 1 hr. I sat down to finally eat, but no cherry peppers & just small unripened pineapple pieces not even cooked. Next, the sweet potato fries were all soggy and gross. I figured ordering fries for delivery in the first place was my fault. But I was not happy about the philly steak so I called. They put me on hold. I called again. They put me on hold. I called with a different phone. They finally answered. They said they\'d send a new one. I waited 45mins as they told me. I called back. They said "it was on the way". I called again after tired of waiting more. They said "there were other orders but it was on the way". I finally got my food well after 2 hours or so, very late at night. I did not even end up eating it. They probably spit in it anyway. They\'re just VERYYYY RUDE people there! Very disappointed with their childish disrespectful treatment to a customer!'
