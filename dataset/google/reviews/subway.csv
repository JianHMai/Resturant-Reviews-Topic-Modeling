Varun Harnathka, a year ago, 5, 'The staff are absolutely amazing. Special mention for Kajal and Usha. They are extremely friendly, skilled, and quick on their feet. I usually order online and the estimated wait time is 20 minutes, but my order is usually ready in less than 5 minutes. As a vegetarian, I thought I was limited to just the veggie patty, but they also went out of their way to suggest new varieties such as Falafel. They are always smiling, welcoming, and prompt. Since I was new to the area, I asked them help for finding events happening in the city, and they gladly helped me with that as well.\n\nAs for the taste, they make the subs exactly as per my liking. Usually, I have noticed that the subs are so filled that the veggies start popping out when you eat, but they fit in all the toppings in such a way that it is just right.\n\nI would highly recommend it. Cheers.'

My favorite is the choice of different types of bread you would like to eat.\n\nLunchtime can have a line forming so prepare for that .\n\nI find the ambiance here kinda like dead, damp and need update.\n\nService is generic (neither bad or good), but it gets the job done.'
Rahul Yadav, 2 years ago, 4, ''
Abby W, 2 years ago, 3, "Yikes. Mediocre food, mostly because the staff here gives customers less product than normal on your subs (4 or 5 pieces of meat instead of 6, 3 pieces of cheese instead of 4 on a footlong, etc). I don't know whether it's laziness or trying to cut corners to save money. I've visited this location 5 times, and each time the employees are on their phones or joking and talking with each other, paying little/no attention to the person buying the sub."

Priyanka Patil, 3 years ago, 1, "One of the worst subway sandwiches I had. I love veggie delite at other places. The one I had here was made by a lady named 'Usha'.\nI wanted only a few ingredients like onion olives jalapenos.bell peppers. She sprinkled the small pieces of filling on the bread and when I asked more she said she was instructed to put only 6 small pieces of each. Then the sauce added was not even as much as a teaspoon.\nWhen I said why is she making the sandwich this way, she said that is how they are trained. (I doubt, I have really had good veggie delite at other places).\nWouldn't recommend this outlet to anyone."

Peter Arnone, 4 years ago, 1, 'The service here is unbelievably bad.  I\'m not sure who owns this location, but they should consider rehiring an entirely new staff.  I\'ve been here a few times now and usually the staff is unattached to what they are doing.  That\'s not the worst part.  It says everywhere that they close at 9pm, however I have been there a few times at 8pm and they were closed.  So I finally decided to call one day before going to get a sandwich.  I called at 11am on a Saturday to make sure they were open.  I asked what time they closed.  The lady replied "it\'s going to be slow so we don\'t know what time we will close.  We will definitely not be here at night though".\n\nI\'m shocked that subway franchise has not pulled the rights from this owner yet.  I think they make decent sandwiches as a franchise, this one is not worth visiting.  Save your time and money.  Go elsewhere!'
