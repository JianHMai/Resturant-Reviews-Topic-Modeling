Eric Hammer, a year ago, 4, "Been to Johnny Pepperoni's only twice but enjoyed both experiences.\n\nThe two experiences were very different. The first we ordered one or two apps (the burrata with prosciutto was *chefs kiss*) and a bunch of pies to split. That's the way to go in my opinion. I'd recommend the Mushroom & Fontina pie, and the Sausage & Broccoli Rabe. Bottom line is you won't be disappointed with any of their pies.\n\nWhen I returned for my second visit, my group had a different approach. Many wanted their own entrees, so splitting pies was regrettably off the table. A few ordered chicken and fish dishes and seemed satisfied but not overly thrilled. I sampled the chicken parm which I surprisingly did not love. Mussels appetizer was fine. Arancini was good.\n\nTip: go with a group and order a bunch of pizzas. Bring wine (BYOB!!) and enjoy yourself. Solid Hoboken spot, great little environment as well."

Jean-Claude Santini, 2 years ago, 2, 'I don\'t understand how this place has been here for at least nine years +, and only has 2 reviews??? Very questionable and it concerns me greatly. I used to be a regular here food was and is always great and atmosphere to dine-in used to be awesome. Well after 6 or so years had passed, i was in the area and i just ended up pushing myself to go there last night cause i remembered loving it, and man let me tell you, if it wasn\'t for that pepperoni!! I\'d be giving this play Zero Stars.\n\n***Long-haired dude that works there has got to tie his hair back and stop touching it every five seconds before he touches people\'s bread baskets and their utensils that they\'re going to eat with...!!!! Nasty, clean your hands.***\n\nMaybe it was close to closing time when I went there like 9pm and they close at 10pm, and I\'ve worked in restaurants before, so I\'ve worked in tight quarters before, but man they need to change the location where they restock their silverware and dry them, it\'s right next to all the dining tables...it\'s loud ...it\'s obnoxious, and it was constant, for about 40 minutes and which in fact is aTestament to the fact that they do work hard there because it didn\'t stop...but, the fact is who wants to hear that banging and clanging the entire time you\'re sitting in a restaurant? Might as well turn off the radio, I couldn\'t even hear the music.  What happened to Johnny Pepperoni? I might order take out, because the pizza is awesome,  hands down best place to eat if your a true Pepperoni lover, but sit...no thanks, id rather not have dandruff flakes hiding amongst my bread crumbs.  Seats and tables feel greasy and poorly cleaned.  I guess I\'ll just take mine to go.  Oh...waiter was good, however,  try to keep your personal conversations out of ear shot distance while your guests are eating.  Your working, and im not there to hear your chit chat all the while with the clanging of spoons, forks and knives in the background.  Ambiance "0", so, i respect your demeanor and communication skills were on point but,  be mindful of the environment.  Your serving $25 + items on a dinner menu, that means big tips! But who wants to go and sit down and eat there with that background noise and that ambience,  it\'s terrible!!! I\'d rather just order pizza and take it to go cuz that\'s pretty much all this place is good for it seems, it\'s a shame too because I\'m sure those entrees are good but I don\'t order entrees that are $30 to go home... I sit down and I enjoy it in a nice restaurant, but, not in this place, thus, your tips are going to be a lot less, so be mindful of the environment that you\'re working in.. that\'s your bread and butter... build your customer base by not making their experience there a nightmare.... that\'s my advice. In the end, I\'m not willing to risk going there again so you\'re not going to make much tip money from me.  Good luck...'
Juan Jose San Segundo, 2 years ago, 5, 'The best'
e collins, 2 years ago, 5, 'We have been regularly visiting this restaurant for about six years now. It has become our family‚Äôs favorite in Hoboken.

We‚Äôve brought many out of town guests here ... whenever they return to Hoboken they always ask to go back to Johnny‚Äôs. More than just a pizza place - the balance of their menu is solid.

Melanie Tam, 3 years ago, 3, "I love pizza. My boyfriend loves pizza. So we decided to slowly hit up all the pizza spots in Hoboken (not all at once). Johnny Pepperoni had been on our list for a while because we always passed by it on the way to/from Trader Joe's. One snowstormy day, we found ourselves with no dinner, and had a small case of cabin fever. So we decided to place an order and trek on over to pick up some pizza.\n\nTo start, we ordered a side of the arancini (Sicilian-style rice fritters, prosciutto, fontina and tomato sauce), which I didn't like. Somethaing didn't taste right with the cheese - like they might have mixed some cheddar cheese, or kraft singles in it.\n\nFor the pizza, we had the Mushroom and Fontina pie (white pizza, roasted mushrooms, fontina, fresh mozzarella, pecorino, garlic and thyme). Now I don't know if maybe I just don't like white pizza, or if it was just too much going on, but I didn't like it as much as I was expecting it to. It was pretty heavy. On the plus side, there were a decent amount of mushrooms on the pie; I just wish they had spread it out more evenly.\n\nPerhaps their pies would taste better if you dine in, so I wouldn't mind going back to try a different pizza, preferably one with sauce. Plus, I believe it's BYOB!"

Sadness!\nSecond- An order costs you $14 for six of these sorry little molluscs.\nThird- The bread crumbs were bland.

Andrew Schaich, 5 years ago, 1, 'UPDATE March 2016:\n\nDO NOT EAT HERE. They don\'t care if they get your order right or not, they don\'t care to correct their mistakes (in fact, they expect you to pay for their mistakes). They then ignore you when you try to bring it to their attention.\n\nI rarely go after places who make mistakes, it happens (we\'re all human). It all comes down to, how you rebound after a mistake. Well this places is the worst!\n\nVery confused why they are the worst restaurant in Hoboken?...\n‚Ä¢ On 3x occasions they took the order wrong!\n‚Ä¢ They contacted me to apologize and offer to correct the situation, but...\n‚Ä¢ They asked for my contact info.\n‚Ä¢ They said John the owner will make it right.\n‚Ä¢ After no word, I followed up twice without an answer.\nREALLY?!?!\nTHey decided to take 3x bad situations and made it worse.\nFOR SHAME. SERIOUSLY NOW THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY SCREWING WITH CUSTOMERS!!!\n\n---\nFebruary 2016:\n\nTonight at 7:45pm is the THIRD (3x) time they can\'t get an order right - I order the same thing each time "1x Square Deep Pepperoni Pie" and the last three (3x) times they try and give me a Large Round Pepperoni Pie $17.\n\nWorst was today, I asked the hostess on the phone to read it back  and quote me the higher $22+ price. So after waiting an hour, I refused this pie when they tried to pawn off the large round pie for $17 or wait another 30 minutes for them to remake the order.\n\nThis happened in October and November where I begrudgingly paid and took their pizza mishaps.\n\nReally, how hard is it to get an order right that\'s your actual restaurant name?!? Your excuses were old the second time, let alone third time!'

Jonathan Goodelman, 6 years ago, 5, "Johnny Pepperoni, is an excellent neighborhood restaurant, the food is absolutely amazing, I have never ordered anything I didn't like. Additionally, the staff is excellent, they are usually extremely busy on Friday and Saturday nights but they do a wonderful job of making you feel as if you are the only ones in the restaurant. Rich, Dom as well as the whole staff keep me coming back week after week. I feel like I am eating at home with friends. Johnny Pepperoni is a must go to in Hoboken."
Rachel Silberman, 6 years ago, 1, 'I was walking around the area and saw Johnny Pepperoni. It looked like a good restaurant; there were families outside eating pizza, and I wanted to experience that. I walk in and ask for a menu, then I find what I want and ask to be seated. Instead, the hostess refused to seat me and took my order. I thought maybe after I gave her my order she\'d sit me down, but when I asked where I can be seated she told me the bar. I told the hostess that I wanted to dine in and be seated, and she looked at me and said "Oh, I thought it was a to-go order" and STILL didn\'t seat me, even though the restaurant was full of empty seats. I just stood there waiting and the girl just looked at me. How else can I word "I want to dine in"? I\'m appalled I was refused service, offended on how the hostess treated me, and confused because I would have given Johnny Pepperoni more money. I don\'t even know why I paid for my pizza. Like hell I\'d stay there and eat at the bar with my pizza in a box. Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else.'
John Rutter, 6 years ago, 5, 'One of the best "fancy pizza" places in town. Ricotta bruschetta toast points are my favorite app. Pizzas are excellent.'
soraya piergrossi, 6 years ago, 1, 'We used to love ordering from Johnny Pepperoni for the past couple of years. They always delivered to us no problem, we live 10 minutes away. But earlier this week and tonight, we tried to place an order and tonight we were told "they no longer deliver to our neighborhood". Seriously?! After ordering from them from over two years?! And the employee who answered the phone wasn\'t even nice or professional about it. We live in a large building and they just lost a good handful of customers. As someone who works in customer service (and in the food industry for almost 20 years) I am just appalled with their "customer service" and lack of professionalism.'

Cardiff Giant, 7 years ago, 4, "The pizza was really nothing to brag about.  Similar to Grimaldis, and maybe not fully cooked when they brought it out (little doughy). However, their chicken al diavolo was the most delicious chicken I've ever eaten in a restaurant. Flavored perfectly, not dry at all, even my friend who doesn't like chicken said it was amazing."

Brad Catalano, 8 years ago, 5, "I was there this past Friday night and had a great dining experience with my family!  I ordered a pizza with pepperoni and roasted red peppers and it was outstanding. (Who says NYC has the best pizza?)  I taste tested all the pasta dishes that everyone else ordered and all were delicious.  I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Hoboken, N.J.  Our kind of place!\n\nBrad from Pittsburgh\nGO STEELERS!!!"
