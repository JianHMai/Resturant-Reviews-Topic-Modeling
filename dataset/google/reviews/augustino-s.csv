Dan Miranda, a week ago, 5, "Let's cut to the chase, you're gonna love it. This place is very old school Italian, do expect a little bit of that in the heart and soul of this place, from the food to the staff. Our bartender and server Denise was delightful, and made our one year anniversary dinner absolutely delightful, can't wait to be back."
Eric P, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'Authentic and incredible old school Italian restaurant that stands among the best in the nyc area for classic red sauce spots. The service and people makes it unique to itself. 100% must try. Try the chicken parm (pictured), artichoke francaise, or the pork chop!'
Staci Hilsheimer, 2 weeks ago, 3, 'Had been waiting months to have dinner here and was really disappointed. The food was EXCELLENT, but service sub par, the portions for the price?? I would be very upset if I was charged the $5 sharing fee for that amount of calamari.  We had out of town guests and felt rushed to enjoy dinner and conversation.  We also realized that our tip was already included (party of 5) something our waitress ( who btw was very friendly) did not tell us in advance. In Hoboken you can find great food everywhere but atmosphere and service in today’s world is still #1.'

Melissa Sheehan, a month ago, 2, 'I’ve lived in hoboken for 5yrs - This place survives on its reputation for being exclusive and hard to get into. I had the linguine with clams and found it to be too garlicky and the sauce was broken - we make it better at home. We were sat just after 7 and asked to get up at 8:36, after we had just ordered a bottle of wine with dessert. Around 8:45 we were again asked to get up from our table, despite the fact that we weren’t notified of a table time limit when we were sat and most places offer a 2 hour limit when there is one. During the meal, we were also told to stop chatting so we could select an appetizer.'
Oscar Abreu, a month ago, 5, "What can you say about this place other than that everything is amazing from the ambience to the food to the staff to the patrons. This place is awesome! Amazing food, drinks are always topped off and Denise is amazing!!! Will always come back to this place! Order the Chicken Danielle(I think that's how it's spelled )"

Jose “Joe See” Gomez, 2 months ago, 3, 'Reasons i removed 2 stars\n1 star for being overpriced. Almost 23 dollars for 3 shrimp cooked in brandy and butter. That comes out to 8 dollars a shrimp when accounting tip. This is by far a rip off. Overly priced. Only a 3 star Mich can get away with those types of prices. (The shrimp were okay, nothing memorable about them)\n\n1 other star was knocked out because the food was, well, bland? The veal parm had no seasoning. It was just, fried and breaded. IV had better else where.\n\nThey only accept cash, i wont knock a star off for it.\n\nThey had good service or at least reasonable rotation and water coverages. The bus boy was on point, he was the quarterback. If not for him this place would get 2 stars.\n\nCheers!'

Joe, 2 months ago, 1, "Walked over to check out a new spot.\n\nUpon entry i was asked if I had been there before so they could let me know that it's cash only.\n\nRan next door then back in less than 5 minutes. Asked for a table outside and the hostess asked the waitress for table of 1 at which she scoffed and shook her head as I was standing there.\n\nIt is an hour before they close and pasta/Italian so not sure why that response was warranted.\n\nI immediately said never mind. Instead of talking to the employee to say how inappropriate that was, I was offered a table at the entrance of the restaraunt. You can't even make this up. This must be family owned because no customer should ever be treated that way. I happened to be the only minority inside or outside, so imagine how I felt experiencing this real-time.\n\nI'm not saying it was a factor but it definitely did not make me feel welcomed at all.\n\nI declined the table and left."

I live in nyc and have no issue hopping on the NJT 126 bus for 15 mins to feast here plus you can go for a nice walk along the river to see the city skyline before or after the meal.\n\nIm usually too busy enjoying my time there to take photos but will make the effort to do so during my next visit!'

Matt Krekel, 7 months ago, 5, "Wonderful place!  Atmosphere is great, food is out of this world. I did not get the flagship meal-the pork...  I saw it on another plate.. It's huge. And I wasn't near that hungry.\n\nI don't remember exactly what I had... It was a whole (both lobes) chicken breast stuffed with all sorts of goodness and topped with mushrooms.  I was in heaven. Wife got the clam linguini. Both were amazing dishes. Next time I'm back visiting, I'll be sure to come by.\n\nAs a note, talked to a few patrons while we were eating. All recommend various dishes..  But one had a standing appointment on the 4th Monday of the month who brings a different friend with them each visit so they can enjoy the food as well. If that doesn't explain the quality and the enjoyment of the establishment, I don't know what does."

Ken Boyar, 8 months ago, 5, 'My last review of this restaurant was 8 years ago. So it\'s time to tell you that Augustinos is still #1 in Hoboken (and possibly anywhere). The food is superb and while some like to refer to the staff as "saucy", they are genuine and lovely and will make you feel like family. People in this town who are sour on Augustinos probably just can\'t get in !'
Eileen McCarren, 9 months ago, 1, 'Ordered take out tonight to support them. Waited one hour and twenty minutes for the call back I was promised for the woman who took our order. When I called back and asked about our order I was told I never got an order under your name. I said thanks we won’t make this mistake again for take out. So our star review is “0” after my order, name and number was taken. I have to leave a single star to record the review.'

They were written up in the NJ Star Ledger this summer for their especially wonderful pork chops. It’s hard to get reservations because they are that good so I took advantage of take out during this time. I got the breaded pork chops which blew me away. They were actually 2 double pork chops and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend! This will provide me with at least 2 other meals. Compliments to the chef and staff, you deserve recognition.'

Ronald Landau, a year ago, 3, "Expensive. We each had a glass of wine and an entree. No appetizer, coffee or desert and with the tip it was $91. Food was ok, not great.\nThe restaurant was highly recommended especially the pork chop which was $38. I didn't order as I thought it was overpriced .\nWaitresses were delightful which made up for the slow service. It took almost an hour for our entree to be served. We won't be back."

Mohini Sarin, a year ago, 2, 'The food was overpriced for average portions and cold but the staff didn’t seem conscientious and were unfriendly or at best phoney ‘friendly ‘. The other customers who gave low ratings in their comments about ‘cash’ only . A great inconvenience . They do not automatically provide receipts unless you request. The Barman was the rudest . I was not sure how much cash I had given him as I have vision problems due to retinopathy and other impairments and he just slammed down the change . I had already told him to keep  $ 22 plus change for the tips for the staff . When I called back to ask for break down for expenses as I realized he had not provided a proper itemized receipt , he ran through the food items and told his staff ‘ it was That Woman’ ! How disparaging and disrespectful  to his customer . It just shows they only concerned about the ‘cash’ not  courteous customer service . I was very hurt and called back realizing he had not given me the breakdown of the drinks. He seemed annoyed ran through the beverages quickly not even letting me explain there could have been a mistake as we never ordered Chardonnay and he slammed phone down . Spoilt my brothers birthday ambience . Left bad taste in our mouths . Will Never return leave alone recommend . Better Italian restaurants With less arrogant attitudes and far more friendly And humble attitude . Let Augustinos eat humble pie . If they want to refund me I’ll go back'

Paul Mignone, a year ago, 1, "Ever since I moved to Hoboken, I have wanted to eat at Augustino's.  There is this hype surrounding Augustino's as being sort of the Rao's of Hoboken.  A place that's difficult to get a reservation that serves great food.  Given the current pandemic, my wife and I thought this would be a good chance to finally try Augustino's.  Knowing they are busy (even just doing takeout), we ordered at 4 pm with the hope to be eating sometime shortly after 5 pm.  I called to place our order and the woman on the phone sounded flustered.  She took my order and was very curt, however, polite enough.  She said she would call back to let me know when I can pick up the food and that it would be around 5 pm.\n\nWe waited patiently and at 5:40 pm, I called the restaurant to check on the order.  This wouldn't have been the first time a Hoboken restaurant has messed up/or even missed our order.  Again the woman sounded flustered and I told her I was following up and that we've been waiting since 4 pm.  She told me I could come in five minutes.\n\nI walked to the restaurant, go inside and I was asked which order I was there to pick up.  When I told her my name, the woman began berating me for calling to follow up on my order.  I was completely taken aback.  I felt like I was little kid being disciplined by my mom.  Imagine the audacity to follow up on an order after waiting an hour and forty minutes.  I waited a moment and tried to make a joke about it and this just further triggered her.  She went on a mini-rant, saying they're not making McDonald's back there.  She went on to say, she didn't care how long ago we placed our order because all of these other orders (pointing to the bags of food) were waiting just as long  The whole incident was bizarre.  I was getting the sense that in her mind I should be grateful they are allowing me to buy their food.  I starting thinking to myself that I should just leave, I don't need their food.\n\nThe total was $61 and I started sorting through my cash to get the money and I handed her $60 and was looking of a single dollar.  When I handed her the $60, she said it was $61, though she could clearly see I was still looking for another dollar.  Her level of impatience was unbelievable.  Who treats their customers like that?!?  I was nothing but polite through this entire situation.\n\nNow to the food.  We ordered calamari with sweet sauce, chicken parm and cheese ravioli.  I would not normally order chicken parm, however, I read so many rave reviews, I felt compelled to try.\n\nThe calamari was pizzeria quality.  It was not good.  If you want the best calamari in Hoboken (or perhaps the best you've ever had) go to Tutta Pesca.  Also, the owner there is kind and appreciative of his patrons.\n\nThe chicken parm was good, however, I can get comparable chicken parm from a number of other restaurants in Hoboken without the side order of attitude.\n\nI can't speak for the ravioli, though my wife said it was OK.\n\nI've been to Augustino's two times, first and last.  This is unfortunate, because despite the average food this time, I would like to have tried something else that had rave reviews to see if they are as good as advertised.\n\nOne thing I can say with certainty is don't believe they hype!  There are better alternatives in Hoboken."
Leon Sanchez, a year ago, 2, "As soon as I walked in 10 minutes on my reservation, I was approach by a manager in a very racist manner telling me that because I was late I have to eat quick or to go and eat at the bar,it was my girlfriend birthday and I felted so uncomfortable that I told my girlfriend, l don't like this treatment let's get out of here but insisted on staying, we had to order the food in5 minutes and eat it in 30"

Anna Clement, a year ago, 2, 'This place has gone down the drain in food and service quality. I was excited to take my friend from Florence to dine here and he ordered the clam linguini that was basically noodles in an oily soup. The worst part was after the dinner was over the waitress proceeded to tell us she had someone waiting to sit down and shooed us out! I was mortified! You pay good money (cash only which is already inconvenient) for sub par food and horrible service. I will not be back!'
D Please, a year ago, 5, 'I grew up on homemade ravioli and theirs are the closest you can get from a restaurant.  Shrimp scampi and fish oreganta dishes are all great. Scoff up the meatballs when they have them. Sauteed spinach and vegetable sides all great. Fun time. Will have to fight through the shtick to get a reservation here but authentic people with authentic food. Best in area so it deserves to have an edge.'

Ashley Lanza, a year ago, 1, 'It pains me to write this, as I always looked forward to an upcoming Augustino’s reservation. After this last visit, though, I will absolutely not be returning. Our group of five made a reservation three months in advance for 9:30pm. I’m a former Hoboken resident and was traveling from out of state for a super short trip, and booked this reservation as one of the only things I’d get to do with my family. The day before the reservation, they asked if we could make it 9 instead, only to call us an hour before our time and move it back to the 9:30 time. Sure, no problem. We show up for our 9:30 reservation, are not even greeted, check-in with the hostess, and assuming it will only be a few minutes, proceed to wait outside, as the restaurant is quite small. Mind you, it’s freezing out. After about twenty minutes, we head in and stand against the wall waiting to be seated. Around 10:00, still patiently waiting, I tried to order two drinks at the bar. The woman who always mans the phone area says she’ll bring me the drinks because I can’t stand in her area. Another twenty minutes go by, still no drinks. At this point I accept that we’re not getting our drinks, but I see them wiping down a table which I assume is ours. Wrong! Another group walks in around 10:15 and is immediately seated. Now irritated, I walk up to the woman near the phones and tell her we’ve been here for well over a half hour. She says the people that just sat had a 9pm reservation, ours was 9:30, so they get seated first. Mind you - they weren’t even physically here waiting! If they called them and told them their table was ready, why couldn’t they do the same for us? They saw us waiting there for about 45 minutes and never even had the courtesy to tell us to wait inside when we were standing out front. At this point, we are all exceptionally irritated. This woman was beyond rude, unapologetic, and condescending. She said ‘there’s nothing I can do. Everyone was late tonight.’ Why wasn’t I told that when she called me an hour before my reservation time instead of wasting our entire night? She acted as if it was our fault. I can’t imagine speaking to people like this in general, let alone at the business you run. It was a horribly irritating and exceptionally embarrassing experience. I recently moved out of Hoboken and hyped this place up to my family big time, only for them to have this experience as first-timers. You can find delicious food on every single block in this city. Without good service, let alone horribly rude service, you don’t deserve any of the CASH people pay to be there. They’ll read this review and they won’t even care, because all they care about is just that: the cash. Looking back it’s now easy to see their entire schtick is all so fake and unauthentic.'

The second I walked though the door, I knew by the aromas in the dining room, I was in for a night of good food.  We (thankfully) got to taste everyone’s dishes and everything was exceptional.   Veal picatta, chicken parm, lamb chops and GIANT veal chops were all so flavorful and well prepared.  We also had the juiciest meatballs and the calamari (and its tomato sauce) was the best I’ve ever had.  Great servers with sass! Make a rez and go.'
