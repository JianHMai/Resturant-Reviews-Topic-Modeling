I usually order platters from Lisa's when I have family and friends in town and today I stopped in 8.5 months pregnant to pick up lunch for my husband and I. I ordered the mufuletta sandwich and got home, they didn't include olives or peppers, just meat sliced way too thick and provolone. So sad, probably won't be back."

The order included turkey and chicken salad ham and then I saw this delicious looking salami mozzarella sandwich so I got two of those but instead  of receiving these mozzarella. Salami sandwiches I got 2 additional turkey. I wish we could have gotten 2 DIFFERENT additional  sandwiches. Ideally they would have called and asked what we wanted instead . Maybe they were missing some ingredients which is fine. Totally understand. but from experience in the service industry I‚Äôm assuming they were just lazy or wanted to save a buck.

In short...phenomenal and definitely a highlight if my first trip to New Jersey. Be warned...they have a sandwich for every appetite and desire. Fresh meats and cheeses, plus fresh bread equal a fantastic sandwich. Bonus for me...I got to show my boys the type of Italian deli I frequented in my youth. They also carry a large number of foods from prosciutto to salami to fresh cheeses to massive cans of tomatoes. Parking is a bit tricky but it's definitely worth the effort.

Mary Ann Farley, 2 years ago, 1, "Sorry, but sandwich is a total fail, mainly because of the price. $10 for a basic sub? Seriously? I asked the guy for added sweet peppers, pickles and roasted peppers, as Subway has gotten me used to toppings, and he forgot to put them on! I called the place, thinking the price meant he had left them out, but nope..that's the price of a basic sub! Had he added my toppings, the sandwich would have been $12!  Recently I went to Kings and got the same sandwich, with all the toppings I wanted, and it was $7.99. And that was with the best cold cuts and amazing provolone. Sorry Lisa... this is price gauging. Will NEVER go there again. UPDATE: Just ate some of this thing. Meh. They're even stingy with what they DO give you. And thick sliced meat? What?"

Got two sandwiches, one hot with roast beef, a little gravy, mozzarella, and sauteed onions; the other with hot soppresata, provolone, tomatoes, a little balsamic, and roasted red peppers.  Had a little problem communicating with the counter staff, but they were friendly enough and let me get a sample of the bresaola and mozzarella.  The mozzarella here didn't impress me that much, pretty good but far from the best.  Their bread on the other hand was perfect, not too dense not too light.  The roast beef sandwich was bursting with beefy flavor, and was incredible.  The soppresata was great too, although the soppresata itself could've had more flavor, but the roasted red peppers were excellent and the balsamic gave it a nice kick.  They put chunks of provolone on the sandwich instead of slices, but I just took a couple chunks off and the sandwich was fine."
Paul Lichstein, 6 years ago, 5, "This place is the little Italian neighborhood deli perfected.   If that is not what you are looking for superficial friendliness and fast service you should go to Chipotle.    Sharp provolone is aged in the basement.  Mutz is excellent.   Prosciutto is perfection.   Choice of breads from the local bakers is large though I am partial to Dom's.   Cleanliness is not obsessively sought so by the end of the day the place can look a little rough.   Same guys have been behind the counter for 20 years.   If you are doing delivery or ordering on line you are missing the charm of making small talk with the guys behind the counter and hanging with your neighbors while your stuff is being made."

The food was OK, but when it was delivered, we were missing a side of fries. No big deal - we called and "Lisa" said she would send it out. Ten minutes later, "Lisa" called back and asked if we had found our fries in the bag. I told her no. She said that she would send a delivery guy out. After 30 minutes, I called to see where our fries were, and was told that the delivery guy was out delivering the food right now. Another thirty minutes later (now almost two hours after the original order), I called and got the "cleaning crew" who said that they do not work there. When I asked why they answered the phone, I was yelled at and the person said "Lisa\'s is closed - we just answer the phone to see if its the boss". Too bad ... you just lost a customer for good.'
