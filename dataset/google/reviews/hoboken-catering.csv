Kevin Beneduce, a year ago, 5, "We used Hoboken Catering for our wedding of over 250 guests and we're extremely happy with the results.  Our wedding was in a greenhouse which presented many challenges, none of which were too difficult for Todd and his crew.   They paid attention to detail and made all of our requests come to life.  The food was excellent, from the mini lobster rolls and grilled cheese tomato soup shooters, to the pasta and carving stations.   We would recommend Hoboken Catering for any and all of your catering needs."

Michelle Sullivan, 3 years ago, 5, 'I finally braved the line at the Sons of Italy Italian Feast last night in Blauvelt. Although it was long, it moved quickly. I was more than impressed with the service I received once I placed my order. The woman taking orders and filling them was so pleasant and apologetic for the wait (she must be a mom). The rice balls were off the hook! HUGE and delicious and fresh. The saixe was perfect!  We could see everyone hard at work, sweating and running around and just doing what they obviously love. There is no doubt in my mind that any of their food is made with just that.. love! I highly recommend!'
Michiko Delaney, 5 years ago, 4, "I hired the Woody character for my son's first birthday party, it was great entertainment for the the kids! The booking process was very easy, great service, I had all my questions answered before hand. The day before my event I received a confirmation call from the person attending my event. On the day of the event he was there on time and entertained the children right from the start to the very end! The kids absolutely loved him and had a great time! Best of all he made sure to stick with the Toy Story theme and had prepared games for the kids to play. I would recommend them and will definitely use them again in the future."
