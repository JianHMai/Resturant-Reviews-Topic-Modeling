He bit into one and immediately spit it out saying it tasted spoiled like sour milk!. ü§Æü§Æü§¢ü§¢ They should be ashamed of themselves!

Disappointed however they feel they need to automatically charge 20% gratuity. I do not feel a $13 drink ordered necessarily should cost $14.60. Or that the public is not capable of tipping accordingly. Should gratuity automatically start at 20%? What happened to 15 and 18%? These servers are making $60 per hour+ for serving Mexican style McDonalds. I have a college degree and don‚Äôt make half that. 2 ppl X 2 taco orders X 2 frozen margaritas + tip = $60.38'

Even after that, two different food runners and the waitress came frequently to bring more chips and salsa and check if we needed anything. I‚Äôm big on customer service from so many bad experiences going places where people are literally just hanging out, are doing whatever on their phones and give you nasty attitude despite trying to set a friendly tone as a customer but they really bring their A game here. Everyone was really friendly and upbeat despite the hectic pace of the business that night.\n\nAlso everyone was super happy with their food and drinks were on point.\n\n10/10 would recommend and go back.'

The reason I am giving this place a 1 star is because of the manager Ryan. Ryan was extremely rude and a complete misrepresentation of what this place used to be. The owners of this establishment need to rehire who they put in charge. Ryan first and foremost shoved a member of our party‚Äôs chair in to ‚Äúmake space‚Äù instead of asking him to slide over. He also began to rush us out our table upon receiving our food asking if we needed to-go boxes while still having the food still in our mouth and it only being the appetizers. He then claimed it was because members of our party ordered food after other members and they had an hour wait. Our party was still eating, still wanted to order entrees and drinks and I don‚Äôt understand how an hour wait has to do with what we wanted to order and how much more we were about to spend. My family and I have been coming to this place since it opened and have never been treated in such an unprofessional manner.

H, 2 years ago, 1, 'My friend and I faced some major discrimination at this place. We rolled up on our bikes on a Saturday night, and parked them inside the gate. The bouncer asked us to move them outside that area, so we did. On our way to doing so, he said ‚ÄúActually, you can take your business elsewhere.‚Äù  He said this loudly in front of several other patrons. It was really humiliating and hurtful. We did nothing wrong.\n\nI can only assume that he didn‚Äôt want us inside because we didn‚Äôt look like typical Hoboken bros/yuppies/young professionals (though we both have respectable jobs and degrees, not that those things should matter).\n\nI used to grab a burrito from this place every week after an appointment in Hoboken.

Well if it were free I would have just left it there for waste but for $28.00 I expect it to be good.'

Joshua De Leon, 2 years ago, 4, "East LA is a Mexican food spot that serves good food and if you like Margarita's your gonna love this place.  When I eat here my go-to choices are the Taco Salad, Enchiladas Rojo, and their burger.  You can get chicken, steak, or shrimp on the Taco Salad while the Enchiladas options are beef, chicken, and cheese. Now the burger they serve here is a half pound patty with bacon and cheese on a toasty bun LTO on the side with fries. The Enchiladas and Taco Salad come with guacamole and pico de gallo with the Enchiladas having refried beans and rice served with it.  The portions here are big so your definitely getting your money's worth when you eat here.  Let me move onto the Margarita's.  East LA is known for their Margarita's and let me tell you that these Margarita's are no joke.  First off they have a ton of varieties from a frozen strawberry margarita to a jalapeno margarita on the rocks.  The list of flavors are on the back of the menu and they'll let you mix it up.  When I ate there I had BBQ wings for an app (they have a half off appetizers and $9 Margarita's happy hour Mon - Fri 4pm - 7pm) the shrimp Taco Salad as my entree with a mango passion fruit margarita to wash it down."

We were sitting next to a couple who were waiting for their food for a very long time (repeatedly asking where it was and told it was coming in 5 minutes). The patio was full when they arrived and it completely emptied out during their wait for their food. They got fed up waiting and asked to pay for their drinks and just leave. They asked the hostess and she put her hand up and said, ‚ÄòI know you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm your server. You seem to think I‚Äôm your server, but I‚Äôm not. Do I look like your server?‚Äô What kind of hostess says that when someone has been waiting for their food for an hour and are clearly pissed off? The couple got up and just left without paying. The woman was yelling about the bad review she was going to leave as she walked away. Okay fine. We ate our food, it was fine and our actual server was a nice guy. The tables outside are horrible and constantly wobble. Ours wobbled once and an entire glass of water spilled on me. Fine, it happens. As we were paying the check, the table wobbled again and an entire mango margarita spilled in my lap. A server (not ours) came over and said ‚Äòoh that happens all the time‚Äô to which my husband said ‚Äòthese tables are horrible.‚Äô The waiter said, ‚ÄòI know, everybody complains about the tables and drinks spilling, it gets people outta here quicker.‚Äô He even took a glass and showed us how the glasses get caught on the wood slats and fall. A place with good service would offer up a new margarita, not make jokes while my pants are soaking wet and sticky. So we pay the bill, leave and start to get our bike and realize that we left the wrong total on the check because we had a gift card. So my husband went back and asked the hostess if he could make sure the bill was properly filled out to which she said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm not your server!‚Äô My husband went in to speak with the manager and asked for the name of the hostess. The manager was extremely apologetic and kind, but this place has major problems with service. We have no plan to return.'
Gabriel, 2 years ago, 1, 'A restaurant to walk in have a margarita near the bar and walk out. Bar tenders were great and attentive! The Saturday night dinner service was TERRIBLE! (There was maybe a one table wait, not super busy) After 25 mintues of waiting at a table we finally flagged down Manager Jeff to request our orders be taken because no servers did. Orders now taken, food out,  we were told server Jorge M would be assigned to our table. Another 20 minutes went by and neither Jorge M or Manager stopped by to ask if we needed anything. Food is mediocre at best. One plate came out cold! Manager attempted to reconcile but the experience was ruined. Would not recommend it to anyone looking for a restaurant in Hoboken.'

I had 2 steak tacos and 2 chicken tacos, the steak could be better not gonna lie (was a bit dry), but the chicken was bombbbb. Now, the frozen margaritas lol guess it's just not my thing. I got the mango margarita and the taste was good but I just couldn't do the whole frozen thing. Second time we came was last night and it was SUPER crazy busy, and extremely loud, got 4 chicken tacos and the guac and yes all were delicious.
