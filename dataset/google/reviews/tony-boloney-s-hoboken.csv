Priestly Canty, 2 months ago, 5, "Saw this as one of the featured places on Giant Foods you have to eat before you die on youtube, so I drove over from Manhattan to try it. Street parking is available, but be advised it's meter parking only. $4.00 max for two hours, and if you use the app, they charge you an extra .35 cents. They are limited on tables. As far as the pizza, it's probably one of the best if not the best slice I've ever tasted in NJ. It's a bit pricey at $10 a slice but I do recommend the Lobster Roll slice. The dough is nice, and soft, loved the crust, loved the taste. I also enjoyed the $hitfaced slice which cost $4.69 per slice. I enjoyed the food so much, I had to order something different to go. I got the winger fries with added chicken. The buffalo sauce gave it an a nice kick it it. I also ordered the Lobster Trap. It was good, but overpriced at $35 for a sub. Overall, great place to go for lunch, or to grab a pie for dinner. They definitely have an assortment to choose from."

As a pizza it‚Äôs a letdown (and my slice was stale) and as a taco it left much to be desired; the taco didnt taste good and i would much rather go to taco bell. Also if you eat the tacos first, then your pizza loses its main flavoring. Ridiculously pricey too for what was an incredibly mediocre pizza\n\nI would recommend going to taco bell and pizza hut to make your own ‚Äòtaco pizza‚Äô.\n\nMaybe i just had a bad slice but in general ill be avoiding novelty food that is only popular bc of instagram'

They have a lot of really cool pizzas with toppings I never would have thought would work on a pizza!\n\nWe tried their famous taco taco taco pizza, the general khan, s#itfaced, and da ruler slices. I really wanted to try the k-pop mic drop but they were already sold out by the time I got there. I think that‚Äôs one of their most popular slices.\n\nI thought the taco taco taco was going to just be a gimmick but it actually worked! The 3 full size tacos are all delicious (one steak, one brisket and one chicken) but the steak was my favorite. The retried beans and green sauce on the pizza were very tasty as well! This thing is massive so if you‚Äôre on your own this should be enough to fill you up by itself! My favorite was the general khan! The sauce, fried chicken, green onions and sesame seeds all worked really well together. The wontons were a nice touch too!\n\nThere were so many other slices that I wanted to try so I‚Äôll definitely be back! They also have sandwiches and wings if you want something other than pizza. We tried the gochuchang wings and the beeria sandwich, both of which were awesome as well! Highly recommend this place!'

To see that pizza in-person, was like seeing something magical come to life. I've seen it in videos, reactions, and etc. But to eat it myself? Magical. I have to warn you, it is a bit pricey for ONE SLICE (12.50). When I ordered it, I didn't realize the price until my order was totaled.\n\nHowever considering, you are getting a pizza, + guac + 3 very well-made tacos...the price is WORTH IT, and dare I say, A STEAL. (Tony Baloney's, please do not increase the price :/) It was delicious, and although my slice was the last one in per-slice category, it was still BOMB. 10/10\n\nThe second item I ordered were the K-POP fries. These little potatoes were A LOT. This is a good shareable item, especially if your going with someone [a friend/a date] that your not finnicky with, and would share a dish with. WARNING: IT WILL GET MESSY. It has gochujang, cheese, scallions, and sesame seeds on a MASSIVE BED OF FRIES. 10/10\n\nSo all in all? Does it love up to the thrill[ist]]? Absolutely. I need to inquire about the Ramen Pizza, because NO INFORMATION WAS FOUND.\n\nMike (the owner), if you see this, lmk!"

Alex A, 10 months ago, 3, 'Rated based on my first impression when opening the box. Usually when opening meat lovers pizza box it\'s "daaamn look at all that meat!". This time it was more of a "huh, that\'s it? looks kinda empty?"\n\nRecently moved to the area and needed a new pizza place. The reviews and pictures made it look like a solid choice.\n\nOrdered CASINO CARNIVORE and K-POP MIC DROP. While both pizzas where pretty good, neither were very toping loaded.\n\nThe k-pop was much better because the sauce at least covered the entire pie providing the good flavor. The casino carnivore was a pile of meat in the middle and just plain pizza around it. I had to spread the meat around to cover it up so I\'m not eating plain slices.\n\nMaybe the description of "10 meats ravaged by mutz" made me imagine a giant pile of meat, but I\'ve definitely had meat lover pizzas more loaded than this. I expected better.'

These wings were so soggy. Most wings around here don‚Äôt have the crispyness to them needed, but these were just holding water and were inedible. I love their vodka sauce but woof way too much on the pizza. The pizza was drenched in sauce and too soggy. Overall a very disappointing experience.

I tried less conventional creations and neither used tomato sauce so maybe that was the problem. Yet one slice called "sh#tfaced" had a bbq sauce on it that I thought would add flavor...but the sauce was indeed bland as well.'
Courtney Perlee, a year ago, 1, 'I\'ve ordered from Tony Boloney\'s more times than I\'ll admit over the past *six* years. Top menu items are Winger Fries (formerly Buff Fries) and the Corn Husker Pizza. I gave them the benefit of the doubt, because COVID, and I want to support local business. They\'re 100% hit or miss. Something is wrong with every other order this year: on four different occasions I received regular crust when I ordered gluten-free (allergy-related, dangerous if I didn\'t recognize it before I bit in), on other occasions I received fries with no sauce or cheese, or just plain didn\'t receive part of my order. I have no faith when I order from them anymore, so Tony and I are "taking a break."'

It has changed slightly but it's a delicious salad any way you chop it. It likely wouldn't be anyone's first thought when Tony Boloney's comes to mind, but they have my favorite salad in Hoboken.

Tony Rosica, a year ago, 5, 'The Taco Pizza although pricey is worth it, you can only eat one slice. We learned after getting there, that they only make it once a week, because of the prep, but they went out of their way to accommodate us, once they learned we came an hour away. It was amazing and the bagel pizza was exceptional as well!'
