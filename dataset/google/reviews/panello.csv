D. Bansal, a month ago, 1, 'Update 10/09:\n\nService has drastically gone downhill\n\nOriginal:\nWould give more stars if I could. Food and service is excellent. The cacio e Pepe is recommended.'
Kirsten Walpert, a month ago, 2, 'Good food, terrible service.  Felt pushed out the door from the moment we sat down.  Appetizers served at the same time as mains.  Several servers were rude and made comments about us leaving throughout the meal.'
Michael Oake, a month ago, 2, 'BOTTOM LINE: Review your Bill.\n\nThis 2 star rating is strictly based off of some food being good. The pasta was well done, the eggplant burrata honestly was delicious. You get the gist.\n\nI‚Äôve never experienced more insulting ownership in my life. Enough for me to sit here and write this review.\n\nOur waitress was new, the risotto was never fired, so it came late, and the steak was drastically over cooked.  None of this is why I‚Äôm here.  Our check came and the bill was 12 dollars higher than expected. Our 7 waters cost 14 dollars (the menu said 1 dollar each). The steak cost 44 dollars (39 on the menu). This issue was quickly elevated to management since it was our waitresses second day. When the owner came,  I pointed out the discrepancy and he stated that meat costs have increased. I recommended he change his menu prices because my expectation was to pay X. Longer story still long, it ended when the owner stated ‚Äúpay what you want‚Äù ‚Äúdo you go food shopping?‚Äù ‚Äúit costs hundreds of dollars to change my menu‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a lot of things I should do‚Äù.\n\nBottom Line: Review your Bill'

Jack Ferreira, 3 months ago, 5, 'Been here on a couple occasions and the food never disappoints.  Gio is a superstar and Iggy the owner is a stand up guy.  Their wood fire pizza is super thin and very crunch.  I always leave there thinking about when will be the next time I have the pizza.'
Joseph Peterson, 3 months ago, 5, 'Beautiful place. Great wait staff. The owner (Iggy) made us feel at home. Food is out of this world.'
Christopher Dunne, 3 months ago, 1, "Ordered through the Panello website (links to Slice).  Pizza was cold and missing mozzarella, so I returned 10mins later thinking they would make this right.  Instead shop said the menu on the website must be wrong and didn't know why the pizza would be cold.  0/5 for customer service but 1/5 for the cold pizza I'm eating."

We got there early and didnt understand why with food so good that the place was empty. By the time we left the place was full. And people waiting to get in'
Ricardo Llera, 5 months ago, 1, 'Terrible service by Iggy the owner and the waiters. We were there along with some other families with kids for a nice dinner when suddenly we got verbally attacked by a client who was drunk and high on weed with his friends demanding all of us to take our kids away. What did the owner do at this point? Absolutely nothing! No apologies, no accountability whatsoever for having to put with this idiot, or even offered a discount. They should close this place down if they allow clients who can‚Äôt handle being around families! And on top of it all service was slow and the food was bad üëéüèºüëéüèº'
Gilda Llera, 5 months ago, 1, 'We are regulars and always loved this place until today, we got verbally ASSAULTED by a customer and Iggy (owner) did nothing no apology nothing, we were amongst 4 tables that got verbally abused by a customer in the outdoors area while enjoying our meal, Owner tried to calm down THAT client but didn‚Äôt apologize to the rest. Guy was smoking weed and drinking, complaining about why are kids even there? Excuse me? Walking up to tables threatening customers saying he wanted to enjoy a nice night as adult with no kids? So maybe don‚Äôt go to the restaurant that has not one but two daycares next door and is in the middle of a cultural center for kids? Inexcusable and poor response from the owner all of the affected families are local residents from buildings in and around Monroe, won‚Äôt be going there won‚Äôt be booking special occasions there and we are disappointed.'

You feel like you are bothering them.'
Natalya Kokhanovska, 6 months ago, 1, 'If there was a 0 star this place would of gotten it! They have no customer integrity when it comes to pickup. I‚Äôve place an order at 9:35pm on Slice my order said it would be ready at 10:10pm, when I walked to the place at 10:10 it was closed! No one even bothered calling me to notify that they were closing or if they can‚Äôt make the order. The next stay I called to receive a refund, they claimed that they still have the food for me to come pick it up almost 24 hours later! The manger was really rude and screaming that I wasn‚Äôt going to receive a refund. This place should be closed just for safety violation serving food over 24 hours. He legitimately stated to pickup my food from the previous night and it was already 8:23PM next day.\n\nNever ordering from them again!'

Gene Rabinovich, 8 months ago, 5, 'You‚Äôll find simple yet delightful selection of traditional Italian fare at this pizza restaurant located in Monroe Center for the Arts. We have dined here with friends a few times now and each time walked away impressed and mentally noting the menu items we should try the next time we visit. The place is kids‚Äô favorite, too, as they can always count on getting thin crust Nutella pizza here. You are always welcome to bring your own bottle of wine to enjoy with your meal. And if you didn‚Äôt bring one from home there is a nice wine store literally next door.'

Andy Y, a year ago, 5, "Amazing food, and even better service! My wife and I reached out to multiple restaurants about hosting a small post-wedding dinner just as Hoboken was opening up for outdoor dining. While most restaurants either wouldn't return our calls or weren't willing/able to think through the logistics of such a reservation (within the city's guidelines, of course), Frieda at Panello was incredibly accommodating. She went above and beyond to work with us in this time of uncertainty and gave us the perfect dinner to cap off an incredible day.\n\nIn addition to their thoughtfulness, the food was fantastic! We started with a custom antipasto platter, shrimp skewers and baked artichokes. For our entre, we ordered an assortment of Pizzas (#CovidWedding) and the Penne Vodka to share. All the food was amazing, but I kid you not: the Truffle pizza was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. We'll be back for that alone, but all around, we give Panello 5 stars!"

Walter Zielenski, 3 years ago, 2, "Poor service, slow food, overly-child-friendly atmosphere.\n\nUnderstandably, the amount of children running around was not their fault. It looked like the restaurant was beneath an elementary school and surrounded by tutoring companies. It seemed to be the convenient, go-to place for families with their screaming kids. It absolutely distracted from the atmosphere, though.\n\nThe food was decent, and I have no complaints with it at all; well cooked cacio e pepe and a beautiful pizza. It's a shame that it came out after an hour wait. We had two waiters swapping back and forth; figuring out who was in charge of our table was a task, and I'm still not sure who it was, thinking back. Though, both would disappear for large gaps of time without coming remotely near our table again.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place, nor go back."
