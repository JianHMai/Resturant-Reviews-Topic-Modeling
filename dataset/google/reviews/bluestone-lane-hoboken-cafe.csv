Jimmy Zuniga, a month ago, 1, 'I‚Äôm not sure what is going on with management - but why is there only one employee running the entire show? They‚Äôre the barista, server, and takes the orders.\n\nIt takes 20 minutes just to grab a coffee. And when there are staff working - it takes over an hour to get food.\n\nI‚Äôm only marking this review with 1 star so that it gets noticed - revamp your business model because this is extremely inefficient for the business and customers.'

Ivanna Kaleniuk, a month ago, 1, 'Terrible service.\nDon‚Äôt tip until you get your order. We waited 50 minutes for avocado toast. AVOCADO TOAST!!!\nAll they have to say is sorry. Maybe only one person prepares food but it‚Äôs not acceptable.\nDo not ever go there for brunch'

N Busch, 2 months ago, 5, 'We only had drinks and croissants but I‚Äôve had food at the upper westside location and it was great. I so appreciate the healthy options this restaurant offers, the outdoor seating was nice, and once I figured out that I was supposed to order from my phone it was ok. We had a hibiscus iced tea and an americano (called something else on their menu) and croissants. The croissants were fine and would have been good with a few minutes in an oven to crisp them up. I hope to be back soon and order more food. My high rating during this particular visit was the absolute, genuine warmth and kindness from our server. It was hot out and we have a big, very old dog. We were surprised she made it the few blocks to the restaurant. The server brought her a big bowl of ice water and really lavished her with petting and kindness. It was so sweet. Really appreciated the warmth. Look forward to determining my favorite coffee item on their menu.'

I‚Äôm not sure if the coffee or the milk was spoiled but the coffee had a spoiled sour taste and it also tasted burnt. It honestly did not even taste like a cold brew because it was so harsh and not smooth like most cold brews are; i think they gave me their iced coffee instead because it tastes burnt and sour. Staff was nice but If you want good coffee do not come here‚Äîyou‚Äôre better off going to Dunkin Donuts instead to be very honest.'

Sue Paerels, 4 years ago, 3, "I will give it another try. Adorable place, great menu, wait staff was sweet. The Avo toast looked wonderful. I had a half flat and it was bitter, but I'll give it another try - might have just been my experience. Great wait staff and great location. Definitely worth a visit"

Dustin Glass, 4 years ago, 5, 'Although I was skeptical at first, I am happy my fianc√© made me try this restaurant. All of the food is freshly prepared and good for you. Pictured below is the traditional avocado toast with the addition of feta, tomatoes, and prosciutto. Their coffee and similar beverages are second to none. I have now eaten here a few times and have come away impressed with the service as well as the cuisine.'

Alyssa Russek, 4 years ago, 4, "Very expensive but extremely interesting. I really enjoyed my beverage and talking to the employees working. They were all extremely knowledgeable in barista craft which was wonderful. They were also extremely kind. The only reason it wasn't five stars is because of the price but if you believe a good cup of coffee is worth the price, this is the place to go."
Aleister Joan, 4 years ago, 4, 'They have gluten and dairy free snacks and some pretty good coffee.'

Brian Meise, 4 years ago, 2, 'First, the positives. My girlfriend and I both ordered cappuccinos which were good and came out relatively quickly. We also got toast with almond butter and jam which was great.  Service then went downhill. It took forever for the waitress to come take our order. We both ordered avocado toast - I thought it was ok, however, my girlfriend thought it was too oily. My avocado toast came out 5 minutes before hers and got cold while I waited - unacceptable! It then took forever for the waitress to get it check.\n\nThe two stars are for the cappuccinos and toast.\n\nFYI - They do not accept cash.'

Alexandra Aroyo, 4 years ago, 1, 'WARNING do not eat here! Yes this look yummy but tasted awful. The Avo toast tasted of spoiled yogurt. Our service was horrible and really do hate complaining about stuff like this but the food was spoiled which ended up in my boyfriend having extremely severe\n\nFOOD POISONING ü§¢\n\nThe managed Stephanie was kind enough to comp our meal but that does not excuse how sick he is.  We will not be going back. Also after trying to call the location 4 times to warn them about potentially making other customers sick no one answered.'

Bridget Monahan, 4 years ago, 1, "The one star goes out to the avacado toast. It was in fact very yummy. But the rest of my experience this morning was why there aren't any more stars. I went to have breakfast with myself and was seated immediately. Then was ignored while the hosts/wait staff seated multiple tables and started taking those tables orders without taking mine (I was not being distracted on my phone and just forgetting to order). While I was waiting I was watching some wait staff kind of stand around or bumping into each other. Not sure if the amount of tables and how they are set up is the best use of the space with the amount of wait staff that was working that day. The menu should have the descriptions that they have online. I had never heard of magic, piccolo....) and Had to look up most of the different styles of coffee they had listed. I ended up going with a long black and avocado toast. I had never had a long black but it came with a small glass of sparkling water that was cracked. I told the waiter about the glass and he went to replace it but replaced it empty.....The manager was nice enough to discount my drink.  What I wish was more advertised was that this place is a credit card/debit card payment only place. The waiter said there was a sign on the door meanwhile the door was open so that only if you approached from the left would you have seen it."
Andrew Stranovsky, 4 years ago, 4, 'Great coffee and healthy breakfast options.  This new location fills up quickly so get there early.  The app works perfectly for ordering.  Place is cashless so get the app set up before your first visit.'
Peter Praum, 4 years ago, 5, '(Translated by Google) Very good cafe that is in no way inferior to the European one !!!\nFinally a good cafe, outside your own four walls.\n\nA perfect European style coffee !!!!\n\n(Original)\nSehr guter cafe, der dem europ√§ischem in nichts nachsteht!!!\nEndlich guter cafe, au√üerhalb der eigenen vier W√§nden.\n\nA perfect European style coffee!!!!'
Mango & Coast Patterns, 4 years ago, 2, 'Visited the new location in Hoboken all the way from Canada for Easter Weekend and the barista who made my drink put no effort into my beet latte, no latte art as advertised on your beautiful Instagram account, what a let down.'
