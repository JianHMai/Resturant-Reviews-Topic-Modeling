Rob Parker, 3 years ago, 5, 'Phenomenal BYOB with gourmet food so you can save a little but get great meal. They now have some half bottles of wine you can buy if you forget.\n\nServers know their stuff.\n\nItalian but more american overall. I almost always get a special, and I always get burrata.'
