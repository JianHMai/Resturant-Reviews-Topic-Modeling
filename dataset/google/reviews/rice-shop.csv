wvuravensfan, a month ago, 5, "We had the spicy beef noodle soup and duck over rice.  Both dishes are authentic, and delicious.  Standard Americanized Chinese food is also available.  They have an open kitchen and it is very clean.  They do have a small store front with seating for dine-in customers.  Great location, right on Washington St.  I can't wait to try more item on the menu."

I even complimented the food and she didn\'t even say thank you. This was for 2 days in a row that we visited. This 2nd day we went, she continued to be rude and mannerless (even threw our plates on the table) there was a pretty shameful and disgusting situation: I asked for my bill and there was something wrong with it.. almost $7 extra we\'re being charged. We made numbers just to find out in a second it all was because she charged tip on my bill without authorization!!! When approach about the situation she yelled that we didn\'t tip her the day before neither that day. I explained that I happily paid for my food because it was good but the tip is 1optional and 2 is a reward for the kind and attentive service of the waitress and she WAS NOT either one and that\'s why she didn\'t get any. She just yelled "Ok I will take the tip off and you pay get out of here and don\'t ever come again!!!!" In front of the other guests! It was that horrible that the people didn\'t even eat. They left before even being approached. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE!'

I ordered the wonton soup which had 4 very small but just enough wontons with a nice surprise hint of Ginger and the broth was delicious. Then I ordered peppersteak with onions that was a little spicy but good. Then my husband used to order curry chicken and potatoes and they still had it so he ordered it again.  When they were in Secaucus he would call them all the time and say Dominic we got it today for you. When they left we saw them at mill Creek and they asked to take a pic with him.  My husband said the curry chicken is still delicious and maybe even better. If you know Hoboken then you know parking is a nightmare but coming to the rice shop is definitely worth the hassle. The prices are obviously a  little higher then when they were in secaucus. The place us smaller then what they had in Secaucus but much nicer and cozier but very busy. You get a very warm and confy feeling when you walk in. i hope if you decide to come then you enjoy your experience like I did mine."

Nart Varoqua, 6 years ago, 4, "With a featureless facade and generic name, I don't know what impelled me to walk into Rice Shop, but I'm definitely glad that I did. Most of the food is about as nondescript as the name, but the (very spicy!) Szechuan Chili Chicken so absurdly good that it doesn't even make sense in the context of this restaurant."

Ali Rice, 7 years ago, 1, 'Worst customer service/management at a restaurant I have ever experienced. I don\'t understand how these people run a business.\n\nI\'ve been ordering delivery from here for over 9 months because my boyfriend and I think the Chicken Pad Thai is fantastic. But within the last couple months, every single time we\'ve ordered, it comes completely wrong. Our order has showed up late (waiting over an hour for delivery), the order is completely wrong, with many items that we paid for completely missing. Each time we have called and complained to management, which is basically pointless because nobody speaks a lick of english and the "manager" always seems to be "not in" and he/she doesn\'t speak english anyways so it wouldn\'t even matter, in their words.\n\nThey have never been able to fix the food and re-deliver it and have always refused to refund us for missing or wrong food items. HORRIBLE, horrible service. I will probably never order from here again after the amount of mistakes that have been made across so many orders.\n\nAlso, they are so stingy!! Giving only 1 or 2 packets of soy sauce when we specifically request lots of extra soy sauce. That just puts the cherry on top of this place.'
