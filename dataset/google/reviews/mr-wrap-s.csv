Jessica Barna, 7 months ago, 2, 'Stopped here for lunch on a beautiful Saturday to sit outside. Had an awful ordering experience and the staff is rude and inattentive. It took them 20 minutes to make a buffalo chicken wrap that was subpar. I went to check on my order after about 15 minutes and they looked at me like I was crazy. Wrap was not well wrapped and not very tasty either.'

Sean Micheal, 9 months ago, 5, "Mr Wraps is absolutely delicious. The menu is INSANE, there are SO many options and I can't wait to go back to try more. I definitely went because of TikTok and was not disappointed. Their wraps are so good and they have tons of other options which are probably amazing as well."

Roberto Beltran, a year ago, 3, 'Stopped in here for the first time and ordered their Hot Corn Beef Joe. Tbh, the sandwich was just okay...nothing special and it was pretty overpriced (little meat to bread ratio) for such a small sandwich. $10 bucks for two slices of rye bread, about maybe 2-3 ounces of corn beef, about 2 tablespoons of coleslaw and a sliver of Swiss (I couldn‚Äôt even see the cheese). It also took them well over 15 mins to slap this baby together even though there wasn‚Äôt a single person inside when I walked in. Should have taken 5 mins to slap these ingredients on some slice bread. The staff was friendly and the kid with the glasses brought my sandwich to my table. They get some kudos and an extra star for that. Overall, I think this place is overrated and can‚Äôt see myself recommending it or lining up for a return visit.'
Brenda Bueno, a year ago, 5, 'Bestttttt wraps !! We drove an hour for this place and it WAS WORTH IT !!! A++++++ IT SLAPS FOR SURE !!
