Akshay Patel, 16 hours ago, 3, "Place is clearly overrated. Food quality was not so good, not so bad either. If you have to wait more than an hour to get a sit, it's clearly not worth it."
Tapan Acharya, 2 days ago, 1, "The food was good but I was shocked when my server came back demanding more tip. I went on 11/14 and had a bill of about $74 and paid $80. I don't like the culture of tipping especially for this reason. The menu price is all inclusive and everyone should always put in their best regardless of the tip amount. It was extremely rude of the waiter to come back to the table for more."

kmason, a month ago, 3, 'Updated review:\n\nVisit with caution due to inconsistent customer service and care. Revised review: Down 2 stars from 5 stars to 3 stars. Called early this morning to make reservations for Sunday brunch for an important family get together. The restaurant told me that they don\'t take reservations so I needed to call in 20-30 minutes before arrival to get on the "wait-list". We followed instructions, were ready to head out and called. We were told "...sorry, we don\'t have a wait list".\n\nI asked to speak to a manager and was placed on the wait list that supposedly didn\'t exist. Upon arrival were were told we had to wait because they were busy. They finally seated us in a loft area with several tables crammed in a very small area. I was virtually shoulder to shoulder with an unknown person at the table next to us. Because there were so many people crammed into such a small area I asked to be relocated and was told they couldn\'t help me because they were too busy. I asked if they could put us back into the lineup and they said well ok but it would be a long time because they were too busy. So we left because we had a limited amount of time which is why we tried so hard to make a reservation in the first place. Sorry to say but we are not going back!\n............\nBelow is my original review:\n\nI recommend Turning Point of Hoboken. Breakfast, brunch or lunch...kids, couples, groups...including vegan choices...all with a beautiful NYC view. One of our local favorites for over 6 years.'

Casey Donohue, 2 months ago, 4, 'Update: I was mailed a voucher to try their salad again. I went today and it was back to the fresh fried chicken I’m used to having!\nI also ordered the lobster Benedict- which overall was fine, but the lobster was questionable. It tasted off and had a weird crunch to it like it was just defrosted. Overall though, I think most people know that you probably should get seafood from anyplace other than a seafood place anyway.\n\nI will be back again! (The last image is of today’s salad)\n\nI’ve  been here multiple times and ordered the chop chop salad and loved it; finally treated myself today to it only to find dried up old chicken nuggets in my salad instead of fresh fried chicken like the last times.\n\nHad I known they stopped making fresh food themselves - I would’ve bought my own bag of chicken nuggets myself… I mean really?! Come on!!! What a waste of money.\n\nAnd they gave the me the wrong dressing.'

Aaftaab T. Aahil, 2 months ago, 1, 'While vacationing in the area with family we searched around for a breakfast restaurant during our stay. After our second day in the area we came across this spot and we felt delighted. Not only we ordered the perfect breakfast all around but the waitress was also so good to us, in fact she spoiled us with her tender and humble service. I believe she was of a Hispanic decent, which reminded me of the people in Chile when I worked abroad. I told her, we’re coming here for BK from now on, and off course we would returned the next morning. Sure enough the next morning there we were walking through the door, but that same waitress was not present that day so we got seated by a different waitress whom didn’t appear to care to even greet us. After we sat down I looked forward for a refreshing glass of water with lime in a pinch to start off with, but instead it was served in individual glass, no pitch and no lime. Meanwhile, everyone else had a pitch off water with lime. That same person also took our order for the drinks, yet when the kids got their drinks it was all wrong. Soon after we got another waitress, I guess she was the one to take our food order. When the food came out my wife and I still had not coffee. I immediately told her that I can’t have BK without my coffee. After a king wait she finally brought it out but it was not the coffee we asked for. She was all over the place, like a chicken without a head. Eventually when she got the coffee right I looked over and noticed my youngest son had no food yet so we waited and waited, but soon decided to feed him from my plate. Actually, four officers happened to be in the same room with us and couldn’t believe what was happening to us as they looked over, in fact they expressed their sympathy for the bad service. The waitress wouldn’t even give us napkins. This service went from bad to terrible and one of worse service ever received. It was like fighting the enemy that I never once new, while wearing a shirt that said “be kind.”This was so misleading! You have been warned! Review posted in good faith…'

Viz Ritz, 4 months ago, 3, 'July 11th 2021 @11:30 - 10 people\n\nFood: 5 stars\nService: 1 star\n\nAwesome food. Great view. Packed place after 9-10am. This is a great place for small group or couple breakfast/brunch place will get you table right away. Table for 10 had to wait 45mins+ wait even with online/virtual check-in. I was okay with the wait time cuz of the bigger group. Funny thing was that they were expecting 10 people to fit on table of 6, no clue what they were thinking. One of my friend requested bigger table or asked to merge small table for 2. So at end 8 people sitting on table of 6 and another 2 people on merge table. But, then after getting table 15-20 minutes no one came asking for orders  or start with drinks. After placing drinks order (coffee and tea only) we had to request them to get drink first until food get ready. Food was really good worth the wait time. We finally started eating around 12:15-12:30pm.\n\nOnce again this place is compact place. Group of 6-8 people or more has to wait definitely minimum 30minutes unless first group to walk-in when they open. So get there early as possible or before planned time. It just become little tricky with patience when an individual pass their brunch time and hunger becomes hard to controll.'

We waited 15 min for our coffee just so you know I ordered regular coffee ( long story short I got with milk in it already instead of having it on a side ; I wasn’t even asked if I have any allergies or which milk I prefer ), when I stopped our server and asked if I can at least have my coffee she said they still making it .It was another 5 min . After we finished all our drinks still no one offered water . We finally got our food which was COLD . All of it . And right after we got our check . Then 5 min later our server came to us because on the back they realized my child order was wrong ( to be fair she was nice ) which wasn’t a really big deal .After we finished our food I asked for containers which I got but not a bag . I asked hostess for a bag but she said I have to wait for our server and ask her even though she saw that we were ready to leave\nIn general place is nice with a really good view which I can’t really say about food also service was OK but definitely could be better\nI don’t think we are going to be back'

Turning point takes no responsibility for the use of a delivery partner to execute their business.  They feel no need to review their partner or take any corrective actions.  They completely wash their hands of this business decision.\n\n2.  Turning point feels no need to apologize to their customer.  The manager told us they have no part in this issue and it is solely with the delivery partner.  They have no need to take any corrective actions such as making sure the packages are labeled correctly and minimizes delivery error.\n\n3. When we asked for compensation for the frustration we have been through, and their attitude towards 1 and 2 above, they said they cannot give any refund beyond the food total and that we are welcome to leave a review.'

We ordered avocado toast- which was Okish..but they have great coffee / tea choices. I ordered vanilla chai tea latte and it was very good. They have good selection of pancakes - lemon blueberry is the best one . We also ordered zucchini bowl which is a very healthy option. Definitely recommend this place.'

Monika S., a year ago, 1, 'The turning point was one of my favorite brunch spots at a different location in south jersey. Unfortunately, I will never come back to this place. The manager/hostess (Maria?) was extremely disrespectful and nasty, and after a two hour wait I tried to explain to her that my family was walking and would be here within the next 5 minutes, they got lost and I told her I’d be willing to start ordering my food now, but she said they had 4 minutes or she was giving my table away. As I was sitting down she told me I need to get up NOW (although I waited over 2 hours for this table) and dragged the chairs from underneath the table as I was sitting there with another person from my party. Terrible customer service, and just a major lack of humanity, especially considering she claimed she was the “supervisor” AND “manager” (I believe Maria was her name) and when I asked to speak to her boss she said she was the only person in charge (shocking); but thankfully due to her rudeness & unwillingness to be accommodating I found an amazing spot up the street that welcomed my entire family so politely, the Hudson Tavern... I highly recommend!'
Sarthak Brahma, a year ago, 2, "Vegans should ignore this place - nothing besides vegan pancakes and the bland avocado toast.

With the dog, servers were nice but services wasn't the greatest, they wouldn't clean off tables nor ask how everything was going..... would I come again ? Absolutely not.

Mary Soliman, a year ago, 1, 'I frequent at this establishment at least once a week because the food is delicious and the servers are kind. With that being said, as a patron I put at least 80 dollars a week towards this place. Today I placed an order over the phone and notified the host that my husband will come and pick up the order. Moments later while I’m on the phone with my husband I hear how my husband is treated at this establishment. Hosts rudely push him to the side, place other orders over him, ask him to grab a drink for another customer, and lastly give him a hard time to check for a drink I order all the time which was missing from the bag. The difference between me and my husband is purely complexion. Why are our experiences completely different? It’s a breakfast place! You expect him to go on the rest of his day with that horrible experience! I later call for the manager it seems a host picks up and says, yes the he is here. Same host answers and says yes I’m the manager, Maria. Same woman who made my husband wait hours for the bag that was already ready was recorded to be there since he arrived. How dare you guys do that?! We both serve as well and know how crazy the wait times can be but we also know when hostesses or servers play manager. I had no intention of writing a review because it is not my style but because the host refused to let me speak to a manager to sort this out, I go public. Not cool and no, we will not be dining here again.'

Edward Curtis, a year ago, 1, 'I have eaten at the Hoboken location approximately 40 times in the past few years. Not because the food is great or the service is good. Frankly the place smells and the staff is inexperienced. The only reason anyone does eat there is because it’s one of the few places in the area open at that time. Today was the last straw. I was rushing to catch the ferry and I needed to use the restroom. I was literally in the restroom 40 seconds when the counter girl told me I couldn’t use the restroom “as per the Manager”. I have never used the restroom there the many times I’ve been there before. I bought a coffee to make up for using the restroom, because “ I was  not a customer” . I’ve been a customer for many years but I will never go back. Has anyone there ever heard of kindness, courtesy or compassion? If any of their staff ever came to my place of business I would graciously offer them the use of our facilities. With a smile. Happy Holidays'

This place is clearly understaffed - which reflect s on their management. It does have great food and prices but not everyone is willing to wait an hour to get food'

Prasad Iyer, 2 years ago, 4, "It is a beautiful place, keeping g in mind the view the service and the friendly staff. The only thing I had a problem with is before going there I called and asked if you guys have vegan options and on call they said yes they have a lot but when I went there they only had vegan pancakes that's it. It was delicious though but you should not lie to get a customer. And place is a little expensive as well. Who charges 8.50 just for coffee. Hence the 4 star rating. But overall ambiance, service and taste was pretty good. Definitely worth a try."

Adams Journey, 2 years ago, 5, 'A group of 5 of us went here on a Sunday for Breakfast.\n\nI would recommend that you go on the website and use their booking service because the place is absolutely packed. Even having booked we had to wait another 30 minutes past our time.\n\nBut don’t let that put you off. It’s right on the river front and we had a booth next to the window with the views of Manhattan. Perfect.\n\nThe choice of food for breakfast was enormous. In the end I opted for the Huevos Rancheros. (See Pic)\nTo go with that I had French Vanilla coffee.\n\nNot only was it all delicious but reasonably priced too. Service was great.\n\nI’ll definitely go back. Maybe for lunch next time.'
