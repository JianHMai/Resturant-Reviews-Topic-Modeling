Philipp Siemons, 14 hours ago, 1, 'Given the good ratings, I really looking forward to taste their quality. In fact, as a tourist staying in\nManhattan, I actually took the Bus to Hoboken to try it (and then look at Manhattan while eating a sandwich near the water). But sadly, when I looked through the window from the outside, I saw that neither of the two customers and one of the two staff members at the counter was wearing a mask. You might be ‚Äûhouse of quality‚Äú, but I couldn‚Äôt verify that, because you failed my expectation of protection against Corona.'

Seth Victor, 2 months ago, 5, 'If you‚Äôve been here, you know. If you haven‚Äôt, this review won‚Äôt explain things properly - go try for yourself. What am I talking about? The mozzarella, the big cheese. Some people will recommend other places within Hoboken for the cheese fix, and there are cases to be made for other favorites. That said, the sandwiches here are my favorite in NJ or NY. Get some roasted red peppers and some sun dried tomatoes on a baguette with that perfect mozzarella (regular or smoked, though I‚Äôm a fan of the regular) and just love life. Cash only, and there will always be a line on Saturdays, but it‚Äôs always worth the wait. You won‚Äôt need to eat anything else for the day.'

The taste was ok, would not go out of the way to get it. People seemed nice. Also ordered the octopus for about $20/pound.'
