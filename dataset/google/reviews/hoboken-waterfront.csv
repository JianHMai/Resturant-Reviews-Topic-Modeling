Anuja Puranik, 7 months ago, 5, "Amazing waterfront with NYC skyline views. The waterfront connects Newport,  Exchange Place, Hoboken all the way to Secaucus.  There are many restaurants,  cafes on the street and it's very lovely especially in summer and fall. There are couple of restaurants which have great views while dining.  Try to come here to catch early morning sunrise or at golden hour for sunset. The views are surreal!!"

Kellie Z, 3 years ago, 5, 'I would like to thank TLC for producing a show about a little bakery in Hoboken and I would like to thank Buddy and his beautiful family for having this cute little bakery and making  a show on TLC about it.  If it had not been for TLC, Buddy, his parents and Carlo’s bakery, we would not have visited Hoboken during our week long visit to NYC.  We are in love with Hoboken.  We want to move to Hoboken. We are world travelers, seriously we have been all over the world, well we haven’t been to Africa or South America YET.  But anyway, Hoboken ranks up there with our favorite cities in the World.  Washington St should be in Guinness’s World Record for having the most people under 30 on their streets at any given time. The cutest dogs on leashes, on the street at any given time, and the most golden doodles at sidewalk cafes, at any given time.  Seriously.  I understand why there are so many real estate offices on Washington Street (Oh!Another Guinness record!). If any of those offices had been open last night, we would have immediately signed on the dotted line for any available apartment.  Never mind that rental for a loft is the same as the mortgage on my  5 bedroom, three bath house eight hours away.  Can you really put a price tag on a piece of heaven on earth? Anyway, This trip is about revisiting NYC, but we just want to hang out on Washington St in Hoboken and eat at every single adorable and chic restaurant, cafe and bakery and just watch all of the cool, beautiful people and adorable dogs who are blessed to be in the greatest little city that no one outside of this corner of heaven would know about if it weren’t for the cute little bakery across from the very large Hoboken City Hall that was somehow featured on a network watched the world over.  God bless Hoboken and everyone there.  We ♥️ you!'
