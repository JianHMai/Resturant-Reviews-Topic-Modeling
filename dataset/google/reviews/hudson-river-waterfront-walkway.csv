Rita L, a year ago, 4, "I visited my friend who lives nearby and loved walking along the waterfront here. The views were really nice looking across the river! It's relaxing to take a walk here, great for running as well. It's a spot where locals come out to hang out and there are parks around the area for families with kids. It's fun for people watching too."
