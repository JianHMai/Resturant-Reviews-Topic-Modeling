bizzy izzy, 5 months ago, 4, 'Sushi is good. Very fresh fish. One thing. I got my daughter who is 9 Sesame chicken. While the dish itself was very tasty, i was shocked to see red peppers, the very spicy kind, mixed in with it. I have gotten Sesame chicken for her for years. NEVER has it come with spicy anything'

Mattington Bear, a year ago, 1, 'Food is bad.  Maybe they are coughing on it in the back?\nBe careful because you will be charged more than the menu says.'
Mark Glass, a year ago, 1, 'Been ordering from here for 20 years. The food has not always been the best but for the price you cant beat it, until this time. I ordered roast pork egg fu young like I have for many years. It usually comes with plenty of fresh vegetables and big chunks of pork. This time it was obvious that they used frozen peas and carrots. What was not obvious, was the pork. It seemed to be absent. Tasted terrible. Huge drop in quality. Shame because they were my go to for so many years.'
Punit Shah, a year ago, 3, "Mediocre experience unfortunately. Spicy udon noodles had only spice no flavor, veggie sushi was ok but didn't impress on quality."
Parker Wolf, a year ago, 1, 'Never going back. Been going here awhile now for about 3 months, at least once a week. Never had an issue until I ordered today, Labor Day. Ordered general tso’s chef special with an egg roll. 1 hour passed and I called in to see what was up (usually only takes 45 minutes or less). The employee acknowledged and apologized that it was late. She said it would be there in about 3 minutes (how long it takes to get to my place via bike). 20 minutes later my food arrives. I open the bag and go to take out my food, when I realize that my containers are soaked in general tso’s sauce. I discover further that the entire bag had been fipped over. There was so much sauce at the bottom of the bag that it literally bled through. That’s too much sauce. Food was cold, egg roll was overcooked. .5 stars if I could!'
