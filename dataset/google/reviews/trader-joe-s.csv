Allot of  products dont look that fresh , like bread and more I got package of hazelnut  and they were hard as a rock not fresh.... this store is more for junk cheap  fast frozen food than healthy , that place should named Local  Junky . But I give them credit for the the fresh fruits at the entry , nice gimic for fulls .Excuse me for my lan... organic my a... !"

One lady saw that I had more items in my arms than I had anticipated buying- she's smart, she just knew (lol), but she asked me if I wanted a basket. She was so helpful.  I saw teams working together keeping the place stocked even as we all shopped, and the team members let us all know they were there for us if they needed us. The place was clean and organized. I wanted to buy more items but I was so far from home as I explained to Keri whom was my cashier, who was so pleasant. I enjoyed our conversation, just small talk about my experience there and a few of the items I selected. She was a breath of fresh air, (along with everyone else) but Keri and spoke more. Upon learning I was new to the area and it being my first time in the store she welcomed me and blessed me with a bag for first time shoppers. Thank you Keri and all staff, I'm sorry I didn't get all your names, but you all are doing fantastic!!!"

Melanie Tam, 3 months ago, 4, 'I was so stoked back when this Trader Joe‚Äôs opened up in Hoboken. Back in the day, my only access to Trader Joe‚Äôs were the ones in the city and those were a mess. Plus I couldn‚Äôt buy much because that meant I would have to lug it onto the Path.\n\nThis location is pretty decent. It‚Äôs clean. There‚Äôs free validated parking. Wine Dad‚Äôs is right next door if you need to make an alcohol run but don‚Äôt want to make multiple stops.\n\nI avoid going there on weekends. I remember going pre-Covid and having to line up just to look at the produce. Mondays can be pretty packed too. When Covid first started, they did a great job with handling the situation. They even reverted bag to free paper bags to help stop the spread.\n\nMy only gripe overall is that they usually don‚Äôt have half the new items I want, or maybe I‚Äôm just going at the wrong times - so I don‚Äôt end up being able to try them. Still, no new items would be better than no Trader Joe‚Äôs at all. Some people aren‚Äôt as fortunate as to have one within walking distance in their neighborhood!'

Any good greengrocer is better.\nCheese selection, ho hum.\nThey have great and reasonably priced flowers. Plants aren't all they're cracked up to be.

This particular branch is somewhat disappointing as compared to others as it lacks many prepared/frozen vegan selections. I can usually count on TJ to have a prepared fresh vegan meal when I am too tired to cook, but could not find one at this one, and the frozen selection is also small. Hoboken seems like the kind of area where vegan food would be welcomed so why not get a bigger selection? I'm from Seattle and TJ is known as a spot for a decent vegan selection there."
