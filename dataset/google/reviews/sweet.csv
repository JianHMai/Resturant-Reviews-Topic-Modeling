Liz Cognat, 2 months ago, 2, 'Let me start off by saying my daughter ordered a cake in April that was absolutely delicious!  This is why I decided to order from them for my nieces bridal shower in September. Unfortunately this cake was dry and stale. I was so disappointed and embarrassed. I called the store the following day but the manager was not there. I told the person I spoke with what happened and she apologized and told me she would have the manager call me back. It‚Äôs 24 hrs later and no phone call. Very poor customer service. Needless to say I will not be returning.'

Nikhil Saxena, 3 months ago, 1, 'I don\'t know if the people that work here know what they\'re doing. I placed an order here for a very special birthday over the phone simply for two yellow cakes with chocolate frosting. The lady on the phone jotted down two "vanilla" cakes with chocolate frosting. When I followed up that I specifically want yellow cakes, she responded, "Those are our vanilla cakes." I expected after my clarification of yellow cake, and the affirmation from the lady over the phone, that the bakery would provide me with yellow cakes. I then picked up the cakes a week later. However, only during the birthday party once we cut the cake did we notice that they made us white cakes. This honestly spoiled the birthday party as yellow cake is the birthday girl\'s favorite. A professional bakery should understand the difference between white cake and yellow cake especially after I made it clear and repeated I wanted yellow cakes. This is why I\'m not confident the employees here know what they\'re doing. To top it off, the cakes were dry and lacked any flavor. Very disappointing from a supposedly professional bakery that they couldn\'t manage to complete a very simple cake order, and I would recommend people use another bakery if they want the cakes they actually ordered...'

Lady Ace, 6 months ago, 3, 'I came here after dinner as I was craving something sweet. I love eating something sweet and I am always in the mood for cake. The quaint bakeshop is located near a park. Due to COVID, they are limiting the amount of people in the store.\n\nI ordered a Red Velvet ($3.75) and a Fluffernutter ($3.75). The cupcakes were tasty but, I felt that they were a bit small to be "regular" sized. Personally, I thought the tasty and presentation was just okay. I didn\'t see anything that made them noteworthy to visit again.\n\nThe bakery had tons of interesting flavors but, I am not sure I would return. Maybe if I was in the area again. The one thing I didn\'t like is that the cupcakes were placed in a paper bag. I had to be very careful on transporting home my goodies. The customer service was okay. The person didn\'t really seem into being there one way or another. I was just another fly on the wall for all they cared.'

So I ended up leaving never trying anything so I can't even judge the produce... I'm sure if I was in my scrubs from work and parked my testla outside I would have gotten service quick but because I was in shorts and walked up I was ignored."

nick piergallini, 5 years ago, 1, "Thank you Sweet! I have literally given you hundreds of dollars of business and today after I called and spoke to someone who told me that I would be OK if I came 5 minutes after you closed, you wouldn't open your door AT 6:05pm.  I'm so glad as a bakery you cannot make a 5 minute exception for a customer who is loyal enough to race to get to your shop as you close after calling ahead and making sure it would be OK to do that.\n\nI will NEVER give you my business again. Very rude customer service after I have been so loyal. I'm unbelievably disappointed a business could be so rude."
Amanda Rich, 6 years ago, 5, 'I am a cupcake snob and this place makes the best cupcakes that I\'ve ever had.

Ruchi Patel, 11 years ago, 5, "I was walking by and just randomly decided to stop by and grab some cupcakes on my way up to Stevens. They were by far the best cupcakes I've eaten thus far. This is compared to Magnolia Bakery in NYC and Starbucks cupcakes. Crumbs cupcakes are good as well, but fancier and more expensive. (also larger) But these are absolutely excellent. Red velvet is a must!"
