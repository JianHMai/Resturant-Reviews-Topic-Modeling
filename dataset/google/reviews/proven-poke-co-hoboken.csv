ashley, 5 months ago, 1, 'I ordered two poke bowls and a mango smoothie. it took over an hour and a half for it to get to me because the restaurant had a miscommunication with my doordash driver. now, that would’ve been okay with him. however, when my $65 order got here (w tips and fees included i know) this is what they gave me?'
Life with Cey & Jen, 6 months ago, 1, "Thid place is extremely poorly managed!Constant long lines no matter what time of the day you come as whoever is managing it keeps it with one person working at a time. So be prepared to wait at least 20 mins to get your food! To top it off, they only give out paper bags and when their bags break on you, they don't offer any replacement or compensation. Will never go to this establishment again, there are plenty of better places in the neighborhood with MUCH better service!"

SuperStarBunny3, 11 months ago, 1, 'No just no, I once ordered lunch to the office from here--the rice was overcooked, the fish tasted stale.. nothing about this place was good.  I literally ended up trying to eat it as I was starving, halfway through I started feeling sick and just threw it out.  I would avoid this one...'

Zah From Newark, 11 months ago, 5, 'Guy was so friendly and patient this was my first time having Poke and my food was delicious. The rice is that sticky rice u get inside a sushi roll! I ordered rice with mixed greens with chicken and shrimp....spicy Mayo with Hawaiian Mayo on the side to balance out the spice. Good to the last bite'
A F, a year ago, 4, 'Decent poke place, happy it’s in the neighborhood. I didn’t love the zucchini noodles (too thick) or the spicy tuna (it wasn’t sushi tuna it was more like canned tuna), but the other toppings, white rice, and salmon were good. I’ll go back but skip the spicy tuna and zucchini noodles and stick to the basics of rice and salmon (or try the ahi tuna). Very friendly guy working there and the store was very clean'

Denise Cahn, a year ago, 3, 'I am happy we have a place locally and enjoy the food but on more than one occasion I walked over there when they are suppose to be open and they were closed.  No note on the door or anything.  very annoying, especially when they have their opening hours posted on the door.  My other complaint is that they switched from the more environmentally sound packaging that they had when they first opened.'

Thomas Castner, 2 years ago, 5, "Love the sauce selection. You definitely get more food and it tastes high quality. The place is clean and there's a Steven's discount!"
