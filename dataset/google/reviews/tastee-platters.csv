Boo Bees, a week ago, 5, 'I tried the chicken sandwich! It was delicious üòã it\'s different from your average "halal" spot. The onions are caramelized not raw. The sandwich was hot and white sauce was more on the mayo tasting side. All in all I will be back!'

Mike E., 3 months ago, 3, "Went there last Friday night with my two other friends for take out. I got myself a mixed platter and gave a small tip, I asked for 2 extra empty containers to fill with white sauce they had on the table and they young guy working there with brown (curly?) hair gave me attitude and he threw it hard in my bag... I understand if it costs extra just lmk I would've just paid for it, the food is good and the rest of the staff seem friendly. Heard a lot about this place just a bummer I didn't get the best customer service :/"
