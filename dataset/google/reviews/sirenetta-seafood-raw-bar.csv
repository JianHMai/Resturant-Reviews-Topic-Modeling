MaryAnn Molinari, 3 days ago, 2, 'I was looking forward to coming to this restaurant but I was disappointed with everything I ate I had the Frutta de mar  with pasta. The pasta was tasty but the fish was cut up and barely there. I have had frutta de mar many times with big portions  of shrimp and calamari but you won‚Äôt find it here. My daughter had squid linguine which tasted like sesame chicken.\nAlso we had Brie for an appetizer and that was not good either.. The service was good and the drinks were tasty.'

Camille Corum, a month ago, 2, 'Cocktails were eh. Food was bland. Service was slow and terrible. Our empty appetizer plate sat on our table through our entire meal. Our waiter paid us little to no attention.  I waited 15 minutes with an empty glass before he asked if I wanted another drink. Awful.'

Nic Bradley, a month ago, 5, 'Solid spot with excellent sparkling wine selections to go with their exceptional seafood.'
William Lakebrink, 2 months ago, 2, 'The cocktails were poorly made with one seemingly missing the syrup entirely. The food was unremarkable with nothing to tie the flavors together in the dish. The spicy shrimp were not spicy at all. The linguine was dominated pepper and lemon flavors which were not even in harmony with each other. The concepts behind the dishes seemed good but the execution was poor.'

Hana Sherza, 2 months ago, 4, 'Went here with a bunch of friends for lunch and ordered a bunch of appetizers. And here is the tea - Oysters were nice and meaty. The brie was the best part of our order, and the shrimp was good too. The octopus was cooked nicely, but I would probably swap it for Tuna.'

Fatima Castellanos, 2 months ago, 3, 'I took my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner on 08/18/21. The food was amazing, the ambiance was great, and service was fabulous. We had a great time and ordered 4 drinks, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts. However, I was overcharged for the experience by a factor of 100% over the final bill and tip (I left ~25% tip on top of the bill amount). I am currently working this out with the restaurant and my card provider. The food and ambiance is great (5 Stars), but I am giving the handling of customer PCI Data (1 Star). If you decide to give them a try I suggest paying cash.'

Besides the table next to us obnoxiously talking about puking for outr entire dinner, our dinner was ABSOLUTELY amazing.  Our sever "Brooks" was one of the BEST servers I\'ve seen in years!! He was polite,  attentive,  courteous,  and extremely well mannered and professional. He definitely saved the day after the wholesituation with the table sitting next to us. This man deserves a raise or a higher position at this restaurant.  That\'s how good he was. We were really impressed. The food was amazing,  flavorful and delicious!! We will be back here soon to dine here again without a doubt. Thanks again brooks we will be asking for you next time we come bro!!'
Elijah Durantine, 2 months ago, 1, "I think disappointed is an understatement. The service was terrible and the food made my girlfriend sick. We went out for my girlfriends birthday and didn't even stay for dessert because we didn't feel like waiting another hour. After we were seated it took at least 10 minutes for our waitress to approach us. We ordered the baked brie and two entrees because we were told that we had to order everything at once. After about 30 minutes, our entrees came out before our baked brie. We tell the food runner that we had an appetizer and after trying to give us our entrees he goes back to the kitchen to check for our brie. About 10 more minutes pass by and who I believe was the manager (didn't introduce himself) approaches us and tells us that we had never ordered the brie and he could give us our entrees now. I asked if we could order the brie and he tells us that they have been out of the brie for a week (our waitress never told us this). He then proceeds to be extremely rude when we try to order another appetizer. He made it seem as if we never ordered the brie and just wasted two entrees. His tone of voice was very accusatory, condescending and rude to the extent that it made my girlfriend cry. After grudgingly taking our order for another appetizer he didn't speak to us again for the rest of the night and seemed like he almost tried to avoid us. After another 30 minutes of waiting we finally get our appetizer. A total of 2 hours in the restaurant for just an appetizer and two entrees was a waste of our time. I will never be coming back."

Maria Sokolova, 3 months ago, 1, 'My husband and I wanted to have dinner at this restaurant. We came on a Monday evening but they didn‚Äôt have a table at the\nmoment, as the hostess told us. Though there were 2 empty tables. But she promised to sit us in 15 minutes. The hostess wrote down my husband‚Äôs phone number and told us she will call in 15 minutes.\n\n40 minutes later , no call. We passed by, those 2 empty tables still were empty.'
Alexander Trofimov, 3 months ago, 1, 'terrible. so despite constantly having 3 or 4 empty tables outside, they only suggested to put us on the waiting list and guess what - they never called! we were waiting and waiting and waitng and‚Ä¶ nothing. we are still hungry. just avoid this place. the hostess is so careless it‚Äôs just unbelievable.'
Joseph Severini, 3 months ago, 3, "If it wasn't for the food being so delicious, it would get 1 star. The service was awful.  Had to remind her that she didn't always bring the entire order. Go for the food and don't expect anything good from service and you will leave happy. I will go again because the food was so good, hopefully service is better and I can make it a five star."
Iulia Ilea, 3 months ago, 3, 'We had dinner on a Friday. The place was packed and very noisy. We ordered a bottle of wine and it took 15 mins to get it. We had the scallops which were perfect, the octopus (that was chewy and burnt) the spicy shrimps were good. We also ordered oysters which came at the same time as our main. For the main course I had the branzino. It was extremely salty and had soy sauce added as well. My husband got the swordfish which was good but also salty.\nThe one thing that was outstanding was the peach tart which was amazing.'

Des KF, 4 months ago, 4, "I made reservations for me and one of my girlfriends for 1pm. When I arrived I was lucky to find parking. Parking on Sundays in Hoboken is terrible. I walked in and told the hostess I was there for reservations and she sat us. I really liked the decor of the restaurant. We were served by Zack and he was nice. When he wasn't around another real nice young lady helped serve us. For appetizers my friend ordered the lobster biscuit. I tasted it and it was tasty but too cheesy. For entr√©es my friend ordered the lobster all'amatriciana and I ordered the salmon burger. My friend really enjoyed her meal. The salmon burger wasn't bad. It was big and filling though. The bill came to about $60. All in all we had a good experience."
Michael Perdomo, 4 months ago, 3, 'Food was very good, but was rushed through dinner which did not seem appropriate for the price range (check thrown on table in under 45 minutes).  Unfortunately ruined the experience for me.  Not sure if this is a new policy as I had been once before and it had been a much better experience.  Prob would not go back.'

I definitely recommend!!"

Chris V, 4 months ago, 4, 'Main was excellent, nice place and nice staff. But I was annoyed the the so-called ‚Äúprawns‚Äù I ordered literally were cocktail shrimp and there were like 6. I can‚Äôt believe that with such nice food, they would serve this. I imagined 6 large prawns in a nice sauce of some kind, but literally was served cold tiny shrimp. Not cool.'
K Graves, 5 months ago, 5, "Lovely outdoor seating experience at Sirenetta last weekend. Low-key best friend's birthday dinner was delightfully enhanced by excellent service and witty conversation from the best waiter Zac!All food was delicious and the cocktails even better. The Hoboken Mule was tasty an refreshing, the scallops savory, and the watermelon salad was light and flavorful. I enjoyed the swordfish and the snapper and I'm looking forward to trying the pappardelle when I go back. The peanut butter mousse/chocolate dessert with house made candied peanuts was everything! Thank you Zac, Matt, and Brooks for making our visit extra extra special and letting us help you close up the restaurant üòâ Cheers!"

Wouldn‚Äôt even make French fries for my young nephew.\nMenu was on line had to use cell phones to access menu . With Covid basically gone I felt this cheesy.\nSmall portions some pasta plates were very al dente. Smoked crab spaghetti was sent back way too smoky!!!!\nTable service was ok until meals were finished, had to ask for dirty plates to be removed. They offered water at the beginning when we were seated not during meal.\nWine list was very overpriced. At this price structure don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll return.'
Chris Boudreau, 5 months ago, 5, 'Always solid food. Staff is friendly, bathrooms sooo clean, and the food! Yes, the food was flawless! Kudos to the Chef and Manager that run this place.

Mia S, 6 months ago, 1, 'First off, I picked this place in hopes of some good seafood dishes . The reviews seemed promising. The place is pretty that‚Äôs the best I can say. The menu is limited. My husband ordered salmon which came with some super bitter arugula & nothing else  . I ordered the crab spaghetti & it tasted like someone dipped it in a salt bin & just threw it on a plate with some bitter shredded Brussels sprouts. Who knows , maybe I‚Äôm spoiled because I‚Äôm Hispanic and we know what flavor is. Never coming back here. Womp womp .'

Robin Zapata, 7 months ago, 3, "Food was ok. The lobster pasta dish was super salty but still edible which we mentioned. Raw oysters were fine and the octopus was cooked well. They forgot the stone crab dish which we mentioned at the end of the meal and they comped a dessert in it's place which was ok. They also got me a silver tequila instead of the reposado I ordered but I just didn't bother bringing it up. Wine was decent. The decor is really nice inside. I wouldn't come back though. Too many off things and there were only about 5 or 6 other tables in there. The servers were nice but I guess didn't care enough to get the orders correct."
Natali Gonzalez, 7 months ago, 4, "We had been meaning to try this restaurant for a while and I'm very happy we did, the service was very friendly and professional. We tried their oysters and crab legs, but I wasn't too impressed with that. The standout for me was the local pork porterhouse, it was divine, I absolutely recommend going for this dish. I do want to go back to have  that dish again but give the rest of the dinner menu a try."
Suthida Chuenklin, 7 months ago, 5, "This place definitely doesn't deserve less than 5 stars from me! I have been living in Hoboken for 2 years and I regret for not coming here sooner. I would recommend all the dishes we ordered here, there were so delicious. It was worth every $ we spent here, including the service. I can't wait to come back here to try other items on the menu!"

Brandi Brister, 8 months ago, 5, "My hubs accepted an offer for a great new job so I took him to dinner at Sirenetta to celebrate. The super lovely hostess said we had a little wait before our reserved table was ready so we went to the lounge in the back for a round of cocktails beforehand. The cocktail list is small and creative and we both enjoyed what we ordered.\n\nWhen our table was ready the hostess came to the back lounge and brought us to our table up front. She grabbed a silver tray from the bar and carried our drinks to the table as well. Of course we can carry our own drinks, but it is a nice touch given the price point of the restaurant, which is quite up there for Hoboken.\n\nOur server was Zack and he was truly fab. Great personality, knew the menu well, and checked in with us just the right amount. I will be asking for him every time we go in.\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Shrimp & Frittes (amazing), the Lobster All'Amatriciana (amazing), and the Squid Ink Linguine (good, but way too black pepper-y for my taste). A really wonderful dining experience. We will be back."

Eric Hammer, 9 months ago, 3, 'My first Sirenetta experience was interesting but good. We came in with big expectations due to the high praise from others. We booked a Friday night reservation almost a week in advance, and we were seated pretty much right away.\n\nThe place is gorgeous and clean. We sat at a table close to the bar with clear sight light to the raw bar. And arguably most importantly, the staff was great. The hostess, the two managers, our server, and the bartender were incredibly kind, professional, and personable.\n\nWe ordered two drinks from the Moscow Mule Bar, both of which were delicious. One was made with Jameson and peach liqueur, the other with bourbon. We love mules, so this was a no brainer for us.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the Grilled Octopus. This was our favorite dish of the night. Absolutely delicious, great char, big flavor. Highly recommend.\n\nOur starters were regrettably less than impressive. Our Mahi Mahi was tasty but undercooked, to the point where it could have, and maybe should have, been sent back. The very middle of the fish was noticeably raw, but the rest of the fish was good enough. It was served with a few different forms of eggplant, the thinly fried eggplant being the standout side component.\n\nThe other starter, as recommended by our server, was the Lobster Rigatoni. The lobster portion was generous, and the lobster itself was awesome. Unfortunately the pasta was a little too al dente. I like my pasta a bit softer, but this bordered on chewy. It was especially disappointing because it was homemade pasta.\n\nOverall it was a good, but not great, experience. I would definitely return to Sirenetta again, in fact I look forward to dabbling with the raw bar and other dishes.'

Sam B, 11 months ago, 3, 'Although this place is fairly new, I would say it does need some adjustments. We ordered 3 dozen oysters, which may have not been thoroughly cleaned because we were all swallowing/chewing on bits of hard pieces with every single one. The apps are SMALL, we ordered 4 different ones and they are definitely not "sharing size" for 4 people. The main courses were good, but definitely on the smaller side as well. The drinks were just average, nothing spectacular for the price. We all left hungry still. Other than that, the ambiance is nice and the place is clean.'
