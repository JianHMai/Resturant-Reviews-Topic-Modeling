Aditya Vaidya, 17 hours ago, 1, "Used to really love this place, getting delivery at least once every week or two. Unfortunately, our last couple of orders have been well below par (one bland, one inedible order).\n\nThe latest order of 2 Kati rolls (delivery) appeared to have stuffing which had gone completely bitter (it was either burnt, or had something else wrong with the spices and peppers).\n\nHad to completely dump both rolls because they were unfortunately inedible. It's the first time I've dumped a complete order this size ever."

The food was overall decent with proper portion and our favorite was the fried ravioli because the filling is creamy & cheesy with crunchy layer & appetizing sauce.\n\nHowever, we had a small complaint that they didn't serve water even tap water, so we just purchased their limited bottle water selection."

I tried the Kathi Roll at Sue's suggestion and was very much pleased with the dish. P.S. Those chips? To die for!

Kayla Ramlall, 4 months ago, 3, 'The first time we ordered delivery the food was great. The second time we picked up in store we were given less amount of food than the first time. The third time we ordered delivery, the chicken in the tikka masala and the paneer in the paneer masala was very little again. Also the chana tasted different from the first two times. It tasted stale or maybe it wasn’t seasoned the same way as the first two times? This was very disappointing as I was very excited for a curry up location nearby.'

Keep it up ‘Curry up now’ !!'
Josh Pesin, 7 months ago, 5, "I came across this place quite by accident while walking through Hoboken, NJ.  I was actually looking for a coffee place, but being that I love Indian food, plus the catchy name of this place made me pause and take a look inside.  This place bases its menu on Indian street food.  I noticed that they had a menu with burritos filled with traditional Indian ingredients.  They also had quesadillas stuffed with Indian food as well.  This excited me since I love both Indian AND Mexican food.  I ordered The Hungry Planet burrito and asked for it to be extra spicy.  Since I'm mostly vegetarian, this dish included vegan plant protein and was perfect for my preferences.  I was offered the option of riced cauliflower instead of actual rice and I opted for the riced cauliflower (I need to cut my carbs).  The burrito was very flavorful and spicy.  I wolfed it down in no time flat.  I also tried the Deconstructed Samosa Burrito shared with me by my ex-girlfriend Jacky.  They put crushed samosa pieces in it which made it crunchy.  I was in heaven with each bite.  I spoke to one of the workers and he told me that is a California-based company and that Hoboken was their first East Coast location. I hope that one day they open one in Brooklyn, which is my hometown."

T. Pisani, a year ago, 4, "I like the food here but I have two complaints. First, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN! Every time I go there i'm shouting back and forth at the counter and with neither of us able to understand what the other is saying. It's obnoxious and I never know if my order is going to be correct.\nSecond, they had signs up saying free naan bits of you fill out a survey online. I did that and then when I go to redeem the coupon they tell me they don't serve that there. Why was the sign in your shop?? They didn't offer me anything else as a replacement either. Bad customer service. These are minor complaints and it won't keep me from coming back but they are worth mentioning."

First of all food was not ready on time and i was asked to wait 5 mins, which is really tough in that stretch of Hoboken if you have a car with blinkers on. The papri chat was decent but was somewhat less in quantity compared to the price charged. I was expecting more. Kathi roll quantity was full filling but it was not a kathi roll but was some tikka masala burrito - if you want to have a kathi roll go to Kathi roll company in the city.'

The staff was very caring & friendly and made sure we are satisfied with our food. We were served complimentary gulab jamuns in the end and a cute lil note from the chef himself😊.

Priyambada Jain, a year ago, 3, 'Curry up now is a place that serves Indian food with a twist. When it comes to giving a twist that too to one of the most difficult cuisine which involves a span of different spices and it can be challenging to attain the perfect balance of the various ingredients.\n\nThis place provides a eclectic menu with dishes that will excite you and will be different from the ones that you have in mind when it comes to Indian food. I stumbled upon this location during their soft launch phase and ordered some of the must try dishes from their menu like Holy moly fried ravioli, Naughty Naan and Mumbai dahi Puri.\n\nRavioli and Naan were good needed a little bit more flavours and seasoning. The little bit disappointing factor was the chat dahi Puri this is such a vibrant dish but it lacked the basic chutneys which are soul of the chat and another point being the potato inside were diced without any seasoning added and not mashed. The potato felt raw and tasteless and the whole chat experience was missing from it. .\n\nI am still interested in coming back to the place to try the other dishes and hoping the chat improves the next time.'
J-Rocks!, a year ago, 5, "Delicious restaurant quality Indian food, hospitable and charming staff, clean, trendy decor.\nI chose from the 'Lite' section of the menu, it was fresh with a homemade taste, ideal for lunch without putting me in an afternoon food coma.\nNice to see an establishment not using single-use plastics for dining in 👍"
Sahil Ramchandani, a year ago, 5, "This place is fire. Not sure what some of the bad reviews are about but I've had this twice now (Delivery and Pickup). I didn't love every dish I had but I can say confidently every dish I had the quality of ingredients is evident.\n\nPapdi Chaat: Amazing. Great Indian snack that they assemble perfectly.\n\nHoly Moly Fried Ravioli: They forgot the Tikka Masala dip but I tasted the potential in the plain Ravioli. With the dip, I know this would be a winner.\n\nDeconstructed Samosa: Perfect app to share. Samosa is super tasty and all the chutneys and Chana Masala blend really well together. It's pieced together perfectly.\n\nNaughty Naan Paneer: Not the favorite of the order but still not mad we split it. A lot of the group was saying it had too much of one flavor. Maybe cardamon?\n\nQuesadillix: Everyone got this as their entree and loved it. From Chicken, Lamb, Paneer, and Aloo every protein choice got raving reviews. Now this is super oily and butter as it is a Parantha so has to be loaded with Ghee (Indian butter) but once you get past that WOW it's delicious. The dipping yogurt and chutney is the perfect pair to complete it, one aspect I thought the Burrito was missing.\n\nBurrito: I got the Chicken Burrito. I felt like this lacked a certain flavor that would've completed it. It's basically Chicken Tikka Masala, Channa Masala, and Rice. While each tasted good individually, it didn't blend well together. Maybe it's just missing the yogurt and chutney that the Quesadillix has.\n\nI know this is going to be a go to spot for me. Try it out for yourself!"
