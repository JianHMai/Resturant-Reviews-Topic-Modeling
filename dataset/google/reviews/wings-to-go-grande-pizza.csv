Abinesh kumar K, 6 months ago, 2, 'I was there to get a "Too Good to go" order, but they gave a slice of pizza and 2 garlic knots for 4$ I paid on the "too goo to go" app.\n\nI am sure a slice of pizza doesn\'t cost 4$.\n\nThey are making money off of the Too good to go app,instead of keeping the word of giving items worth about 10$-15$ for 4$ because they are too good to go.'

Robert Smith, 2 years ago, 1, "The entire place is gross. I'm not a picky eater either. No sauce on the pizza, which looked old from the get go, wings were really plain. Shouldn't have to rely on sauces for good wings. Not a fan and will not go back. Fyi, gave the place 3 tries, months apart, same result."

Naveen Thattil, 4 years ago, 5, "I've been here at least two dozen times over the years. The food is about what you would expect. For the price, it's not a bad option if you need something quick and cheap. The family that runs it is very friendly and nice. I was surprised to read that people had bad customer service experiences. This is one of the few places in Hoboken I've never had a bad experience."

Zin Mot, 4 years ago, 2, "Pizza looked really old. Crust is tasty but cheese and sause are not balanced. When my slices came out of oven they were kind of burnt and dry. If you're extremely drunk and you just wanna eat something it's a good place but if you want to eat pizza and enjoy your pizza go somewhere better."

Sasikanth Kancherla, 4 years ago, 1, "The cashier was rude and stand offish for no particular reason. The food was very mediocre. My biggest complaint is that their kitchen did not look clean. I saw one cook blow his nose and then continue to prepare food without washing his hands. I don't plan on ever returning.\n\nThe Little Market next door is vastly better if you need some hot food in a pinch."
3dplanet100: walking and tours videos, 5 years ago, 3, 'Sometimes the pizza is good. Sometimes, its not too good. And sometimes its terrible. And sometimes is yummy. Its sucks when you go to a place and not know how the food is gonna be this time. Now i go to somewhere else, which i know that the food is goona be excellent, and is a little cheaper.'

Mike Casella, 8 years ago, 3, "I regularly order wings and pizza from wings to go because they are normally some of the best wings in town for delivery and price. Recently however the quality of the wings has suffered. They are either burnt or double fried or the oil needs changed. Not so good. Better shape up or I'll find another regular joint."
Matthew Hartsough, 10 years ago, 2, "Wings were a good size but didn't have tons of flavor. The mild wings didn't taste like they had any sauce on them. Wouldn't go back. Good quality celery and blue cheese included at no extra cost."
