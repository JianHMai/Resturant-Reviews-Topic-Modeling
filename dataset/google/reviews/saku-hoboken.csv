Dean Saidon, 2 weeks ago, 2, 'One of the worst spots for Japanese food in Hoboken. Ordered chicken fried rice - had no taste at all. The sushi was not authentic and mediocre at best, especially for the price. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because of the decor.'
Olivia Gural, 3 weeks ago, 5, 'We ALWAYS have an amazing meal at Saku! We love the atmosphere and the cocktails and that they change their speciality rolls once in awhile so it makes us try new ones. 100% recommend to everyone!! Also the crispy rice and gyoza is out of this world'

Michael Greenberg, a month ago, 3, 'Expensive and only okay sushi; easy to eat outside with kids, and a nice selection of drinks.\n\nNice sized portions of miso soup and seaweed salad. Nigiri sushi portions were small, with still warm rice. Rolls were okay---the rice layer on inside-out rolls (all we got) was thin and the rice was smooshed and broken.\n\nService was friendly (to the point of being oversolicitious, but tastes vary).'

Olander Wilson, a year ago, 3, 'Meh. Not bad and not overly impressed. Had better sushi. I had the ‚ÄúI like butter and I cannot lie‚Äù (blue crab roll), surf and turf and my appetizer was the Philly cheesesteak gyoza. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the gyoza. The dumplings description was written very well. Caramelized onions, Asiago cheese and mushrooms. I‚Äôm still looking for those ingredients. I was told it‚Äôs the ‚Äúclosest to a philly‚Äù - hearing that made me excited. The dumpling was stuffed with a piece of meat, not a prime Ny strip steak as advertised. The dumpling was very flaky as I got mine pan seared. The customer service was A-1 by the way. Very friendly and warm hearted.'

Eric Hammer, a year ago, 4, 'Despite living only a block away, I\'ve only been to Saku once after months of anticipation. Dating back to when the restaurant was in full service, I had heard mixed things going in. My expectations were slightly and pleasantly exceeded.\n\nWe had to wait a while for a table but were able to sit at the bar faster instead and order there. We had drinks at the bar, both of which were fine but nothing memorable: the Samarai\'s Widow (the better of the 2) and the Tokyo Rose.\n\nFirst course was a Toro Tataki special in some kind of truffle sauce; loved this. Any time I can get toro I take advantage. And with truffles? No brainer. Would order again.\n\nWe got 3 rolls: I forget the name (it was on the Specials menu) but it had soft shell crab in it, similar to a spider roll. It was the weakest of the 3, but by default.\n\nThe Japanese Jeopardy Roll was a "must try" based on recommendation. It\'s actually a very good roll, with the added bonus (?) of one VERY spicy piece.\n\nThe best roll BY FAR was the Crunch Drunk Love. Our bartender Wil explained that it was a special for a while and was promoted to the everyday menu. I can see why. MUST HAVE in my opinion.\n\nService was very good albeit a little slow. Busy Friday night though so it was understandable. Wil behind the bar was awesome and helped with my whiskey selection.\n\nThe most appropriate rating probably lies somewhere between 3-4 stars. Tie goes to the higher score in this case.'

As good and refreshing it was to take a bite of the yellowtail with avocado it blended perfectly with the spicy mayo topped with tobiko.

Eventually the order was ready only at 8:15! We had to wait outside for over an hour, this was beyond ridiculous! The only good thing about their sushi was it was fresh, but for $10 for basic sushi like Alaska roll they could have made it with less rice and more fish at least. Our evening was ruined and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever order from them again.'

RJ S, 2 years ago, 3, 'Good ambience with attentive and friendly service.\n\nApps were good (philly cheesesteak gyoza sounds strange but tastes great), cocktail was watery and lacking and really relied on the mezcal to taste of anything. The speciality Hoboken Brewery Saku beer was great!\n\nThe sashimi is pricey ($4 per piece!) and no sashimi combo on the menu which this place would really benefit from. It really racks up if that is what you‚Äôre after (usually we would share a 16 piece combo, but not here!). Unfortunately it isn‚Äôt anything special. We also weren‚Äôt told it was $4 per individual piece until after the order was in so we felt kind of obligated to stick with it and order more accordingly.\n\nThe sushi roll (we had Dude, Where‚Äôs my Roll?) tasted and looked good. The only problem was the green leaf/roll on the outside didn‚Äôt stick together well and fell apart when you picked it up, so beware when using chopsticks.\n\nOther reviews have compared it to not meeting LA quality and I have to agree. Our favourite local sushi place there is in a grocery store parking lot and the sushi at Saku paled in comparison both on price point and quality consistency. There‚Äôs really no good reason why Hoboken can‚Äôt compete, especially when this menu is at an NYC price.\n\nIn short, we might go back for the rolls, apps and the beer, mainly because Hoboken is sorely lacking in Japanese options. Definitely not for the sashimi or the cocktail.\n\nThis is really more of a 3.5 star review but Google doesn‚Äôt allow. I can‚Äôt honestly give it a 4 because our experience was so 50/50 good/distinctly average.'

She made the night!\nMy friend and I went on a Tuesday which is flight night.  A taste of 3 wines for 15 dollars. We started with the Garlic edamame which is sweet and spicy, which I strongly suggest. Then we ordered 2 specialty rolls - Salmon Poke - pretty good and the One and Only Roll (DELISH!) and we shared a fried rice. Melanie told us there is duck in the rice, just in case we do not eat poultry (I am a pescatarian, so that was great of her to say)  so I went for the vegetarian option. That fried rice was OFF THE HOOK! Kind of obsessed.\n\nCons:\nThe wait:\nThere was a sushi class - so it took almost an hour for us to get our meal.  Melanie was just as surprised at our wait. So I would strongly suggest the staff and the patrons are forewarned that if there is a class, you will wait a painful amount of time for 2 rolls of sushi and bowl of rice.\n\nIt was good food, but not an hour wait, good.\n\nThe price:\nEdamame\n2 specialty rolls\nOne fried rice\n2 flights\n2 glasses of wine\n\n124 dollars\n\nCome on, now.'

My glass was never more than half full before it was refilled, the environment was fun, energized and just right.\n\nThe choice was exciting with traditional sushi as good as anywhere, excellent fusion rolls and a great choice of drinks. This really is the place to go in Hoboken and compares with the best Manhattan has to offer. And the price is incredible. At least half what I would have paid in Manhattan.\n\nTo all of you who run, own and manage this establishment, thank you and well done.'

Carolyn Delia, 2 years ago, 5, "Ok first off it's the nicest sushi place in Hoboken. Aesthetics aside it had the most unique menu I've seen in a while. Fushikake fries are an absolute must. Beet roll is amazing. Lobster rolls were out of this world. Just go . The kicker of it all was there was live music and it made the whole night ."

Michael Panayiotou, 2 years ago, 5, 'I would recommend planning in advance with an early reservation as they get slammed on weekends. I ordered a drink from the bar and made friends with the bartender who was super chill. I got the ‚ÄúBoba Fett‚Äù cocktail which I could drink dangerously fast. It was delicious. My friend and I had a sampling of the menu and everything was fresh, and exactly what I wanted for a night if sushi. I highly recommend. They have their own designer rolls but you can have whatever classic roll you‚Äôd like. This place is great.'
sophie lavet, 2 years ago, 2, "I hate to give this review because this place was needed in Hoboken. That being said I think they have a huge opportunity to improve. First off, whoever created your sushi menu, or who you hired as your sushi chef has got to go...I'm from Los Angeles, sushi is without a doubt my favorite food, I've had Michelin star sushi and strip mall sushi (those places can be just as good) but this truly was grocery store level sushi. I get trying to be more adventurous with the menu, adding rolls like the guacamole is extra, (the guacamole was barely present and flavorless) or the surf and turf roll (supposed to be based on steak and it's ice cold). Anyone who knows sushi (and you should if you're starting a sushi place of this magnitude) knows that the consistency and temperature of the rice is one of the most important factors (watch jiro dreams of sushi) apprentices spend 3 years perfecting how to make perfect sushi rice. This rice was ice cold and mushed together. Additionally, choose better ingredients, or be honest about what you're using. You said there was blue crab in one of the rolls, it was actually artificial crab. All in all your place will fall off in popularity when people realize how average the sushi is. These are generally sophisticated eaters, who have every opportunity to go into the city and spend this kind of money on sushi. I would truly reevaluate your menu, your ingredient supplier, and whoever you have hired as your sushi chef. Go into the city or to LA and really eat at the best of the best, ask questions, figure out what they're doing to be successful, and bring it back to Hoboken, it could definitely use it!!!"
Gregory Bryan, 2 years ago, 5, 'FINALLY!! A solid uptown place for refreshing dinner and fun/delicious cocktails.  Don‚Äôt listen to any negative review.  The place is phenomenal.  All of our dishes were tasty, fresh, and left me wanting more.  Our waiter, Chris, was amazing too.  I loved that he gave us the crowd favorites but also his personal favorites - all his recommendations were spot on.  My wife and I will be back very soon.'

Jeremie Pettit, 2 years ago, 5, 'Great addition to Hoboken, blows away all other Japanese restaurants in town. Korean spiced chicken is truly unique and amazingly delicious. Had the chance to meet the owners Pat and Dan when my wife and I went in for dinner last night and it was obvious they put a lot of effort into the small details which makes such a difference to the overall feel of the restaurant. I was sad when The Turtle Club closed until I went to Saku, not so sad now! 13/10 would recommend, on par with Antique Bar & Bakery.'

Melanie Tam, 3 years ago, 4, 'I had been wanting to try Hoboken Turtle Club for a while now, so when they recently had a Restaurant Week special, I jumped on the chance. Our party of four came in on a Thursday with a reservation for 6:30 and the place was still pretty empty.\n\nFor $25, you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Plus, they let you combine with happy hour specials too and Thursdays are 25% bottles of wine. They also have the regular happy hour going on until 8: $3 select draft beers, $5 house wine, $5 well drinks.\n\nFor my appetizer, I went with the bacon mac and cheese. This portion was HUGE. It definitely wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting for an appetizer portion. I ended up bringing most of it home since I still wanted to save room for the entree. But I probably wouldn‚Äôt order this again as it was a little bland.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the short rib cheesesteak. This was great! It had the perfect cheese to meat ratio, and the meat was very tender.  It was a little bit on the salty side but still great overall.\n\nFinally for dessert, I had the pistachio gelato. There‚Äôs a lot of pistachio flavor to it but after a while, you realize that there‚Äôs also a lot of sugar in it.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back in for another cheesesteak, and I‚Äôll definitely be back to try their $1 HH oysters on Tuesdays.'

Thomas Venneman, 3 years ago, 3, 'The food is decent, the atmosphere is pleasant and the service was spotty and infrequent. The waitress spilled a whole beverage on my fiance and she spent half our time there in the bathroom  under the hand dryer. Kind of ruined the night because it was below 30 degrees and her jeans were soaked... on her birthday.\nWe waited to see what the restaurant would do to compensate for what happened and at the end of our meal the waitress informed us she had taken ONE of the SIX drinks we ordered off the bill ... My fiance gave me that hard look when I became to complain (she doesn\'t like confrontation) and I just paid the bill and left.\nIt was a pathetic attempt of making things right, not to mention the handling of the situation left something to be desired. All the waitress did was bring bar napkins when I asked for a dry cloth towel and or paper towels, which the restaurant "did not have"... I find that hard to believe.'
