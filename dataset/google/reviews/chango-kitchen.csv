Jonathan Petrakakos, 2 months ago, 5, 'I always have a great experience at Chango. The staff is friendly and the food (especially the sandwiches) is amazing. BYOB too. I highly recommend the cubano or the Venezuelan steak sandwich.'

Andrew G, 3 months ago, 5, 'The breakfast tamales were awesome. No argument there. I could have used more creme fraiche though. The morir sondano was excellent as usual. We haven\'t been inside since their renovation and it\'s quite nice. All staff were very conscientious about mask wearing but customers often completely ignored the huge "no mask no entry" sign. The infection numbers are up again and we should be more careful.'

gia hargrove, 4 months ago, 1, 'This is the second time I order the steak sandwich even the flavors were good I could count one one hand the strips of steak on the sandwich all I tasted was mayo and onions, the server was extremely rude. Handed her my money she placed it on the counter I hate that. If I give it to you you should give me my change back'

Rafael Lopes, 6 months ago, 4, "EDIT (05/03/2021) (4 stars):\n\nIâ€™m moving my review to 4 stars because they revamped the kitchen, amenities and customer service. It is a very decent place to eat right now, with friendly staff!\n\nâ€”\nPrevious review (2 stars):\nDon't trust Chango for ordering with Grubhub or Seamless. If something goes wrong with your delivery, they won't provide a decent service or refund. Like, on the level of calling the restaurant and they hanging up the phone in your face when you are talking."

Marcela G., 7 months ago, 5, 'A big shout out to my best latin place in Hoboken: Chango Kitchen. Traditional yummy latin dishes. Our fabs are churrasco con chimichurri (skirt steakgrilled) and ropa vieja (shredded beef). My kids loved "alfajores with dulce de leche", "tres leches" and hot chocolate with when is cold outside. Services is warm and friendly.\nI can visit the place multiples times and never get tired. You should try it as well!'

My son was born in beginning of Covid And it wasnâ€™t easy to just cook all the time but we tried chango on UBER and we have been ordering ever since. The customer service is incredible we canâ€™t wait to come visit in person, my sons a little picky and this is the only place he will eat rice beans and empanadas other than mine!!  Keep up the great work !!'
