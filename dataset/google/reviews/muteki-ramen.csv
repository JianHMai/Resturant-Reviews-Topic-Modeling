Sanket Pednekar, 4 days ago, 3, 'Nice place to have Ramen. I am not that fond of Japanese cuisine but Muteki Ramen has made rethink that. We ordered Bang Ban Shrimp which was pretty good. Maybe they could serve with more dipping sauce as the appetizer do not have much of a spice. We also ordered Karaage Ramen with thin noodles. The quantity was way too much. I felt the chicken was never going to end. The usual ramen taste, nothing extra ordinary but the chicken had good taste. We ended our meal with Mango Mochi Ice cream. It was good too although it was my first time having a mochi icecream. Overall, a decent experience with good food.'
TheGrassGuy, 5 days ago, 5, 'I greatly enjoyed their spicy ramen, and their okonomiyaki too! My first time trying the latter, actually. Liked it.'
Bianca Johnson, 2 weeks ago, 1, "Went here for lunch with a friend today. The fried chicken boa was soggy and the ramen was not enjoyable from the broth to the thin noodles used nothing was enjoyable didn't eat much at all. My friend got the kimchi ramen and also said hers lacked flavor. There's way better ramen out there"

Maria Loera, 4 weeks ago, 5, 'We ordered the ramen, okonomiyaki, unagi don, and karaage fried chicken. All items were very tasty and even for delivery you could tell they cared about presentation. I will definitely be ordering from them again if I want a Ramen night in.'

stacey li, a month ago, 5, 'Great place if you are looking for ramen or wanting to experience japanese food. The gyoza was crispy and juicy, the takoyaki was soft and sweet especially since there were bonito on top. We came here with friends, and we all ordered ramen. We had the tonkatsu ramen and karaage ramen, the karaage was so crispy and the crunch was great when you take a bite. And the broth for both ramens were good because you can taste the pork broth in them and it wasnt too salty. Overall, great place and the servers were so nice plus they came back and checked to see if we needed anything. 5 stars and we will be coming back to try other items.'

Mar'Keith AllenCampbell, a month ago, 5, 'So after being stationed in Japan for 2 plus years. You get the taste of ramen and udon. Most of the restaurants or shops that sell ramen and udon have a feeling to them that is hard to recreate. So when I walked in, got that warm polite welcome from the staff. A nostalgic feeling hit me, I knew this was gonna be good. The waiter I had was not only polite but patient and kind. So I decided to order the Volcano Miso, Karaage buns, and a Ramune Strawberry. The Karaage buns were so soft, warm, and delicious it was like OMG. Volcano Miso hit the spot like a train hitting its destination on a clear beautiful day. Just the right amount of spicy to compliment the oh so butter melt on your tongue pork. All and All if your near this part of jesery this spot you might wanna stop by and try for yourself.'

Bryan Cabo, a month ago, 5, 'After a long day with my veteran group and running the flag throughout Northern NJ, we found our way here. I’m always down for ramen but damn i didn’t know i was going to be in for an amazing surprise! Long story short: veggie ramen is phenomenal!!! Also picked up mochi and green tea cheesecake.'
Liza Gomelski, a month ago, 5, 'Thank you Muteki for making such a delicious Tamtamen ramen, it makes me happy every time. Excellent service. Not a fancy restaurant for dates but if your craving some hot soup it will fulfill the needs. Will be coming back!'
Natasha Brennan, a month ago, 2, 'Food was good, but halfway through I guess the employees children walked out of the kitchen area with a poodle… left the restaurant and shortly came back with the poodle in their arms…. Couldn’t finish my food and was repulsed. When I arrived there was a guest with her pet outside, so if guests have to sit outside with pets WHY would the employees think it’s ok to have pets inside the dining/food prep area. GROSS.'

Toni B, 2 months ago, 1, "We reaally wanted to like this place, but several negatives: 1. While the Volcano ramen was decent, it's definitely on the sweeter side. 2. The ramen with garlic oil (which I always get in ramen places in NJ, NY, and in Asia) tasted like it was all salt. 3. Takoyaki was ridiculous--each one was ALL dough and one tiny piece of squid. When we kindly shared our feedback with the server--he said the takoyakis are made my their supplier so it's not up to them. Ugggghh. Then get a better supplier for food that's worth the money? Which brings me to 4. Overpriced. Even at NYC standards, you can get a larger, better tasting bowl for their prices."

Eric Shwartsman, 2 months ago, 5, 'Delicious'
R K, 2 months ago, 2, "It is not what Japanese cuisine indeed; base, texture, and bun. I think they don't know how to make genuine Japanese ramen. They should learn it from the bottom."
Brooklyn Williamsburg, 2 months ago, 1, "This place not authentic Japanese ramen. I had tonkotsu ramen but it tasty like pork broth and mixed chicken broth i think. Also, they are NOT Japanese even they can't pronounce of Tonkotsu. If you mad for ramen, don't go here. People go here reason only for location. Horrible Ramen EVER!"

Linnea “Adurnari” Stew, 3 months ago, 5, "Aesthetics: excellent.\n\nService: quick, polite and friendly.\n\nMusic: a hair louder than I would normally like, but great selection nonetheless.\n\nFood: I have chosen, for your sake, to keep this brief. I could wax eloquent about the quality and flavor, but let's keep it simple. The combination of flavors, textures, and presentation made this my favorite ramen experience ever. I bought one of their souvenir pairs of chopsticks to commemorate the occasion."

Kalauna, 4 months ago, 3, 'The ramen was ok (very heavy on not that great). To be fair, we should’ve know since there was no ones in there. They are nice and get attentive but the food is just lacking. The ramen was $17 ( I got the Volcano miso one) and it was not hot ( i do have a high spice tolerance but even my friends with a lower one said the same) and it was not flavorful. The broth is missing some love and seasoning. I plan to take my leftovers put them on the stove and add some garlic salt and extra seasoning. I also got the buns ( the beef ones) the beef was seasoned well... kinda fatty but a problem but the buns are like warm and ehh. Overall, I would not come back but I don’t feel terrible about the experience.'

Not to mention that all of their vegetables tastes sour, I had runs that day and am still not feeling well.\nNot sure how they could have >4 rating on Google, I suppose they are only bad to deliveries since you can't tip the waiters who put appetizers in boxes.

Occasionally I mix it up and get the Thai curry ramen.   The buns are good too.  The Muteki wings weren't my favorite, but to each their own, nothing specifically wrong with them, you might like them\n\nWorth a trip for sure."

We ordered a black tonkotsu, which tasted fairly authentic to versions that we've tried in Japan. We also got the Muteki ramen, which was a nice variation on tonkotsu with a bit more body + extra chashu. The broths were flavorful while still being fairly light, noodles were nice and thin, and the toppings were all delicious; melt-in-your-mouth fatty chashu was a particular highlight.\n\nThe portions were also huge! It was like getting 1 kaedama for free.\n\nWe tried the yuzu honey drink while there and loved it.\n\nCan't wait to go and try other options from the menu!"

Seems like they have options for single (perfect for introverts) or group dining.\n\nRamen:\nPresentation 👌\nBroth is good. Not as rich as other broths I've had before, but still tasty. Pork was well marinated. Was not a fan of the noodles. I might be wrong, but the noodles did not taste freshly made. I wasn't a huge fan. Overall, I'd give it a 3/5 stars.\n\nPork bun - I prefer a more savory flavored pork buns, but they were still delicious with a sweet taste. 3/5 stars\n\nWe also ordered the lychee drink and that was delicious! Definitely worth a try. 5/5 stars"
