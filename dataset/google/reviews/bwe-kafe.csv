Gary Stout, a week ago, 5, "Possibly my favorite place on Earth. Amazing coffee, perfect taste in music at all times and the staff has always been legendary. I've been coming here since they opened and have made a lot of friends mingling with people in here. The people that work here and have worked here in the past I've grown to know and became friends with over the years. Top notch ownership, beautiful spaces that are well thought out with great details, and just a great experience the second you step foot in any location. BWE is a vibe."

It has milk alternatives which is always a plus for me - almond, soy, and oat milk which is my favorite! The drinks are large sized 12 oz and 16 oz but the price is equivalent to an 8oz drink in NYC so  don‚Äôt mind if I do! ;) Has good amount of seating with a large table in the back of the shop for small groups or getting work done.

Ana T, 4 years ago, 4, "Great place, but drip coffee can be inconsistent. I guess they switch up the beans and you never know what you will get when you ask for a dark roast drip. Sometimes it's pretty weak, which just f's up your morning lol. It gets crowded, especially on weekends, so if you plan on working here you must come early. Otherwise, it is a stylish local spot with friendly service."

Wen Lui, 7 years ago, 4, "The coffee is from La Colombe and it's, as usual, great--robust and bold with just the right amount of kick. I've had an almond latte and a regular latte here and they were both delicious!\n\nIt's also a really nice spot to kick back and relax, whether with a friend or alone with your computer/smart phone/book. There are smaller tables at the front, and a huge communal table at the back. I personally prefer the front because there's a ton of natural light there, which makes the place seem really warm and cozy. The baristas are also really friendly and welcoming. I'll definitely go back with a good book or my laptop soon!"
Sasha G, 7 years ago, 4, 'I am such a cafe feign.\nI seriously can\'t get enough of them.\nAnd I must say: bravo Hoboken! Despite the usual Hobo stroller moms, this cafe pretty much embodies everything I want in a cafe:\n\n* great lighting and relaxing ambiance\n* conveniently located near my lover\'s place\n* great cause and background story (work in Haiti)\n* an interesting name\n* good espresso (La Colombe!)\n* & ALMOND MILK. (enough said.)\n\nBecause we\'re both coffee feigns and the name "Bwe kafe" means "drink coffee" in Haitian Creole- we were instantly enticed. I mean there\'s nothing else really Haitian about this place being it\'s in Hoboken I don\'t think they want to shock their typical clientele but it\'s a great place nonetheless!\n\nPerfect spot to spend the afternoon with my love sipping an iced almond milk latte, giggling (yes, men giggle) at the stroller moms and the frazzled look on their faces.\n\nI\'m hooked & I will totally return.'

Peter Kim, 8 years ago, 5, "When I was looking into moving to uptown Hoboken, I was a bit concerned that all the good coffee shops were downtown. It sounds like Red Lion is good but doesn't have indoor seating.\n\nI was glad to find out that bwe kafe was opening just after I moved in. I got a Haitain pour-over which was delicious. Also had a very good danish.\n\nThe inside space is really nice -- there are some small 2-person tables in the front area and a large 6-8 person table in the back. Free wi-fi for people who want to study or do work.\n\nLooking forward to coming here often!"
