I had to borrow money because I had already ordered.  Later, when my Mom went to figure out what the problem was the manager said the gift card machine was broken and he didn't know when it was getting fixed.  He didn't care that we had bought the gift card there.\n\nUPDATE- Decided to give Ben & Jerry's another try- one month later this Ben & Jerry's still does not accept its own gift card.  No explanation.  No sign.  it is mid summer.  This does not appear to be a good faith effort to fix a problem."

After consoling her and making her aware it\'s ok accidents happen, we just have to be more careful next time. One of your workers made her a cup of the same ice after telling me sorbet shouldn\'t have been as the 1st scoop because it melts faster. I thought it my head ok that\'s nice but you might want to make your staff aware of this. As she checked me out she said " just to make you aware, I\'m going to have to charge you for that and point to the fallen ice cream. In response, I stated "no you will not".\n\nThe audacity of you to even think of charging me for fallen ice cream from which was an accident from my child, after seeing me console her and then make a cup to replace it. And also admitting the person who made it, made it wrong with putting sorbet on the bottom!\n\nShame on you!\n\nA simple happy trip to grab ice cream turned into a lesson in which I had to explain to my daughter which got upset once again after leaving Ben & Jerry\'s.'

My wife literally eats only one brand (Ben & Jerry's) and one flavor Vanilla Toffee Crunch. We have gone to a ridiculous number of grocery stores in recent weeks looking for her ice cream, with no luck. So we decided to take the 30 minute ride to the actual store because we just knew we would satisfy the craving. Well not only did we strike out on that, for the employee to check the list of discontinued flavors and this flavor made the list is very disheartening!! Now because there's no reason for my wife to purchase anything Ben & Jerry's, I am out too. Again this 1 star is for Ben & Jerry's decision makers and not the staff at the Hoboken store!!!"

Tyler Lund, 7 years ago, 3, "I expected a little better from the normally amazing Ben & Jerry's. The place was full of non-commital patrons who needed to taste every flavor, and while this is outside their control, the staff did nothing to move the line along. In addition, the highly advertised frozen yogurts were all gone, without any signage. The flavor I did get was pretty good, but even a small was a bit too much of a good thing and very rich. For the price premium, I was looking for a better experience. One more reason Hoboken needs a gelato store."
