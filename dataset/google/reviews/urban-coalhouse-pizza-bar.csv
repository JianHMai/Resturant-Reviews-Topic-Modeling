After having a little one it has been difficult to find places to accommodate having a stroller. Urban has been so amazing with not just having one stroller but accommodating several moms with several strollers.'

Ariel Tranquilli, 4 weeks ago, 1, "Called to place an order. The woman clearly didn't speak english that well. After 4 minutes of giving her all my contact info for delivery... I asked if I can upgrade an appetizer to an entrée. She didn't understand my question... got annoyed that she couldn't understand my question then HUNG UP on me. I had to call back 3 times before she'd answer again then she blamed it on being disconnected. CANCELLED my order & didn't bother calling me back. HORRIBLE customer service. The manager wasn't any help either. Been in Hoboken 10 years and I'm a huge foodie, too bad they will not be getting any of my business & I'm happy to tell everyone I welcome into Hoboken about their horrible attitude as well."

K. __, 2 months ago, 3, 'The location is lively and fun to walk around and explore especially on Friday and saturday nights. The restaurant looks nice from the outside, it looks like something you’d find in Manhattan. When we got there we were ignored twice by waiters and hostess. The waiter who served us was kind. The pizza was bland, it lacked a rich flavor and sitting outside made the pizza colder by the second. The spinach artichoke appetizer came in big chunks with barely any cheese in it. Nothing looked appealing nor something that I would want to take a photo of. The fried calamari was good.  The seating arrangement was odd—pushed up against each other; It took away from the private setting of a dinner. Overall, I would not come back here  nor recommended this place to friends. There are much better spots in town just look at the reviews.'

The waitress was nowhere to be found and the place was dead 2 tables in and 2 tables outside (incl mine)!\nWe sat outside but we're completely ignored!  I went in twice to order desserts, but my husband ended up asking for the check after my failed attempts. The present staff did not offer help but continued to hang out amongst each other but told me they were short-staffed. They could have quickly assisted but instead said the waitress would be with us ASAP.\nRuined our night!"

Alexis J., a year ago, 3, 'First dining experience at a restaurant since March with my husband and 2 little kids. Didn’t think to make a reservation when we saw at least of the tables OUTSIDE were empty. Upon asking for a table, we were told we could ONLY sit inside without a reservation. I immediately went on open table and got a reservation for 5 minutes after we were just told we needed one. Although many tables were open, the hostess then walked us to the last table; one of edict was similar to other seated patrons who were in groups of one 2 or 3. We were 4 with 2 kids.\n\nWe then ordered within 10 minutes of being sat. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 pizzas, and a kids pasta. 10 minutes later, our wings come to our table with a hair baked right into the chicken. They immediately took it back (later off the bill) but our pizzas (entree) came to our table a minute later. Our table could not hold our food so we had to put our waters or empty cups on the floor. They refused to add a small table to our table because they “had reservations” coming in 30minutes so we could use a second smaller table only up until the reservation arrived.\n\nAll in all, they’re food was good but I’d recommend just picking it up if you really wanted it that badly. If it wasn’t for my kids being hungry after reading the menu and excited to go out to eat for the first time in 7months, I probably would have left the moment the hair showed up in my food.'

Good work CoalHouse team!!!\n\nPerfect crust, delicious cheese and sauce with basil to perfection, and Apple Salad which as always, was maximum fresh and crispy with tasty dressing.\n\nAs a rule I don't mention names but since my first negative rating was all about poor service, I want to mention that this 5 star rating was in great part due to our server Michael, and the excellent and highly professional attention he gave to my family today. Thank you Michael and I hope your boss (who is also doing a great job) reads this review.\n\nPRIOR REVIEW BELOW\n\nFollow up visit after prior review. This trip a much better experience. The food quality was very good, fresh ingredients, very good pizza crust and toppings. A good menu selection for all including tasty vegetarian choices.\n\nToday the place was full of energy, tables and bar area were packed, and though the food came out a little slow due to the crowd size, it wasn't an issue because the the servers were fast, positive and did a great job under pressure.\n\nI recommend Urban CoalHouse and it's great to see management's success at addressing issues and keeping this a fun, refreshing place for ice cold beer, friends and a family pizza gathering.

I have tried half the pizzas and have never been disappointed, and always pleasantly surprised!\n\nAppetizers are delicious as well (wings, brussels sprouts!!)\n\nService can be lacking (in terms of courtesy, menu info, specials info, at least on the week days) even when it's not at all busy, which is something the owners should look in to ( ! )\n\nVery Good Beer Selection, Full Bar\n\nNevertheless, food never disappoints, especially if you stick to delivery.  5 solid stars\n\nP.S. This place gets very busy on the weekend, and delivery can be very slow (2.5hrs!!).   110% suggest ordering from UberEats for fast delivery."

When I saw the new owners opened up in Hoboken I was very happy, went there Sat nite and the food wasn't good at all. Found it to be mediocre at best. The thing that's making me write this is this, before you order take a walk to the back past where your prepared food waits to be brought to your table. I was sickened by what I watched as I waited for the restroom. 4-5 flies buzzin and landing all over this area where again your food sits waiting to be brought to your table. I know if it was summer I would have to be annoyed that they weren't doing anything about a normal summer nuisance, but it being middle of sub freezing weather makes me think these flies are living in this place. I was very upset but didn't want to say anything due to the people I was with. I had just met some of them for the 1st time. Get it together that is disgusting and unacceptable. I just couldn't believe how they all just stood around & it didn't phase anyone."
