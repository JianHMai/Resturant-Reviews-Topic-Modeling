I love that the drafts are all displayed cleanly and well-organized on a digital board that also displays the Beer Advocate rating. I'd prefer the Untappd rating, but now I'm just being nitpicky.\nMy one genuine issue is the fact they don't serve flights or small pours (eg 4oz). But I'm otherwise so impressed that I still rate it 5 stars."

Yuriy Z, 5 years ago, 5, 'The frequent brewery tasting events make it a breeze top learn and try a wide variety of beers. Bartenders really know their beers, and take the extra effort to drain the rare heady keg so you can always enjoy a cold brew.'

Zachary Rose, 5 years ago, 5, "Great selection of beers and friendly bartenders. Always every time I've been there but never so packed that you can't move or get a drink."
Christian Graninger, 6 years ago, 3, "Has nothing to do with cork city, it's just the name and bar staff isn't very friendly"
Andy Lee, 6 years ago, 5, 'I went to Cork City with a close friend last Friday, and the selection of beers they had was phenomenal.  They had their cellar raid earlier that week, had had plenty of top beers left.  I was able to try my first mead here, and even found a 2011 version of the Japanese Green Tea IPA!  Bartenders were very helpful, overall a great experience.'

John Voorhees, 6 years ago, 1, 'Cork City has some of the best beer selection I have ever had. However their service staff is terrible.\nLast night I went in with some friends. My friends were served, the waitress (I use the term waitress because this person broke all kinds of etiquette and I refuse to refer to her as a bartender) tells me she will be right with me. I then watch her go and serve 6 other people, then get my friends their second round of drinks. After 15 minutes of standing at the bar I finally flag down the other bar tender. As the waitress sees the bar tender getting my drinks she rushes over and asks what she can get for me, I politely tell her that I am already being helped. The night goes on and we have a few more drinks. I close out my tab while my friends are still drinking. I sign the reciept and leave it on the counter. The waitress insists that I fill in the total. I write down the total, planning to leave a cash tip before we leave. As soon as I set down the check she picks it up and asks if there was a problem with the service. I inform her that I was dissatisfied with the wait, at which point she launches into a tirade about how she only makes 2.16 an hour, how I should feel ashamed for not leaving a tip, how it would be cheaper for me to go home and drink a 6-pack alone, and how much she kicks ass at her job. Never before have I been treated so rudely or encountered such a strong sense of entitlement from service staff that they would think it is acceptable to berate a customer. Honestly, it was embarrassing and childish behavior that I am appalled to believe Cork City would condone.\nIn summation, while Cork City has great beer, their employees need to learn proper manners.'
Patrick Brose, 8 years ago, 5, "The bar has a ton of beers on tap and an obscene number in bottles. Lots of obscure craft beers to be had. Nice atmosphere, not too loud and generally not packed to the point where you can't easily move around. I like the place."
Eric Bogard, 8 years ago, 5, 'Best bar in town: awesome taps that constantly are rotated, meat market free, and unpretentious.  Bonus points for being across the street from Sri Thai.'
Matt Evangelisti, 9 years ago, 5, "I was surprised to see bad reviews! I went here last night for the first time and met the owner. He's very friendly and you can tell he cares about his business/customers. He puts a lot of effort into running events, specials, and keeping ‚Ä¶"
Randallius *, 13 years ago, 1, "This place is just plain awful. The beer was flat, the only patrons were fat, old guys, and the whole place stunk like a public bathroom. Oh, and the bar owner seemed to be flamboyantly gay, which was weird. You couldn't pay me to enter this establishment again."
