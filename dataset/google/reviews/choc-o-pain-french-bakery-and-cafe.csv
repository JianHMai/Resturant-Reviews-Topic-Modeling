They offered to make them again but it wasn’t any better the second time.  They said we’d have to sweeten them.  Sweeten hot cocoa??  Anyway, tossed them down the street.  So disappointed!! ☹️'

Arash Dadvand, 4 months ago, 1, 'This place is poorly managed, over priced and they don’t even bake their bakery in store\nLet’s start with management,  they do not make everything fresh. For example the pies are their from days before until they are being sold. Even Panera bread donates the remaining bakery at the end of the day!!\nAnother example of rip off is I just ordered a large latte. There is a chalkboard that has the price for 4.75. When the I wanted to pay suddenly the price was $6+ tips. I asked isn’t that the price the man said that is the price before Covid!!\nThe next day I bought the same latte and the price was 5.50+ tips!!!!'
Roshun Sangani, 5 months ago, 5, "I can't say enough good things about Choc O Pain! As you walk in you immediately are greeted with an extremely aesthetically pleasing establishment and display of their variety of baked goods/sandwiches. The staff are extremely nice and friendly and it is clear that they take pride in their store (as they should). I have had the luxury of trying a variety of items from here including their sandwiches, fresh bread and baked goods. I can honestly say that I have yet to try something that I did not like. Now I am by no means an expert on bakeries, but I have had my share of freshly baked goods in Europe and the US alike and Choc o Pain is easily going toe to toe with some of the best I've had. Please do yourself a favor and give this place a try."

In addition,the “frangipane” was nothing like the one in the galette des rois. There was too much cinnamon to have a tasty almond pear. I won’t buy it again. I bought although 2 baguettes, and could not eat the rest of it, the day after as it was completely dry and too hard to eat except if you want to loose a tooth with a bite. Very disappointed experience. I won’t return to this place for sure !'

Robert K. Chin, 2 years ago, 4, "wanted to see what the fuss was about in regards to people complaining about the croissants.   the time of baking to time of purchase also says a lot.  I purchased a croissant around 3pm.  croissants are yeasty breads so chewiness is normal, also depends on how long they proof the dough, the type of flour used, and how wet the dough is, how much water is in the butter, oven temps, that all affects overall product.   the croissant was merely ok,   i felt the inside of my croissant was a bit wet, a bit chewier than normal, and wasn't well laminated (Butter and flour layers). I think also most small american bakeries don't have a dough sheeting machine as these are expensive, so trying to make a croissant by hand rolling or however you can to make thin sheets of butter and dough will result in a not so perfect croissant.  they did use butter, but overall, there was some lamination problems, and the dough was probably a tad too wet."

Jen, 2 years ago, 2, 'My mocha was unpleasantly hot and didn’t taste great (I’m fine if it’s not sweet chocolate, but this was just bad) but the food was okay. We sat upstairs and it was filthy and rather than looking like a little French dolls house, it looked as though it was just full of someone’s discarded mismatching furniture. They didn’t turn on the music until we’d been up there an hour. Please make time for your staff to clean! The stairs looked like they hadn’t been swept/mopped in a week. Huge pile of boxes in the hall, too. Just felt like we were in someone’s home but in a ‘sorry, I should’ve called ahead’ way.'

Guillaume Guy, 4 years ago, 5, "Definitely my favorite bakery in Hoboken. Espresso are great, pastries are delicious (croissants + chocolate croissants + Kouign [buy 3 for $8] ). I also bought their delicious quiches and pies for parties and they were all appreciated.\nAlso, try out their bread (campaign loaf). It's pricey but really high quality (lots of nuts) and fresh."

I'm really disappointed for a French bakery."

Also, wifi is semi reliable and bread is some times stale. :(\nAlso, it gets pretty rowdy with all the adorable children for they sometimes throw birthday parties there...at a French cafe!??\nBut! Delicious pastries, lovely 2 floors, big selection and most of the time wonderful staff.\n3 1/2 stars as an avid LevelUp user'

Wen Lui, 7 years ago, 3, "The latte I had was good, but I was disappointed by the almond chocolate croissant. It was cold and dense and not as flaky or crisp as the reviews I read.\n\nBut, it's a great place to study/get some work done--check out the second floor of the cafe. It has a sky light that lets natural light in, nice comfy couches and some large communal tables. A nice hideaway from the bustle of the streets/incoming customers downstairs. A warning though: there's also a kids area up here, so if you can't deal with external distraction/noise you might want to stick to the downstairs area, which is a little dimmer."
