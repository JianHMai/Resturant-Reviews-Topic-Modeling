Id make it a point to try their stew‚Äôs for this chilly weather. The lamb shank does not disappoint at all. Stop by it‚Äôs worth it!'
Kathleen Heaney, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'One of the best restaurants in Hoboken. The food is superb. I wish I could eat the chicken kebab every day!'
Family Fan, 2 weeks ago, 3, 'Really wanted to like this place. I love Persian food and eat it pretty often. The food was ok. Kebabs were decent but portions a bit small and seasoning alright. But the rice was undercooked so it made the meal a bit underwhelming. I would‚Äôve still given it 4 stars but the service was pretty mediocre - wait staff was surprisingly not friendly or engaging in any way. I may come back to try the tadig and gormeh shabzi but was disappointed overall.'

An absolute gem if you are looking for middle eastern food. I get the chicken soltani! Its so addicting. Thank you!!!! We needed this in hoboken.'
Mitra Dowlatshahi, 2 months ago, 5, 'Lots of very nice outdoor seating. Service is lovely. The chicken breast kabob is seriously the best I have ever had.'
Milad Mahdian, 2 months ago, 2, 'This is by far the worst persian food we ever had, ever. The meat in kebab (we got the filet minion) smelled pretty bad. The chicken kebab was ok. The worst of the worst award goes to the gheymeh Bademjoon. It was smelly stale and ‚Äúmaside‚Äù. Finally ghorme sabzi was bland, or as we Persians say ‚Äúja nayoftade bood‚Äù'

Matthew Boyer, 3 months ago, 4, 'Seven Valleys is great. They have the best chicken kabob in town. Their flavored rices are also excellent. If I had to offer one area of criticism it is their bread. It‚Äôs almost always pretty dry and tastes stale. If they revamped that they‚Äôd really have the full package.'

Alexia Edwards, 3 months ago, 5, 'Absolutely amazing food! The service was great and the waiter was especially helpful in making suggestions and explaining the flavour profile of each dish. Such flavourful and aromatic option; highly recommend the Persian lemonade & the Persian ice cream. Definitely suggest dining here!'
Andreas Hadjiapostoli, 3 months ago, 1, 'Food quality was poor, cold, and extremely small portion for delivery. Ex. Shirazi salad was all cucumbers that were old and in a small plastic container (the same of which you would get at a cheap Chinese restaurant).'
Maddie Jewell, 4 months ago, 5, 'Truly my favorite place to dine in Hoboken. The chicken is always juicy and delicious and the cherry rice keeps me coming back! I‚Äôve tried many of the appetizers as well, and I truly have never had anything disappointing. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a delicious meal!'
Amy, 4 months ago, 1, "Disappointed with the quantity of food we received through Ubereats. Though the food was good, paying 19$ for koubideh that was very thin and takeout box not filled all the way felt like a rip off - they could have at least given more rice to fill us up more. The quantity of the takeout didn't look comparable to the pictures I saw posted by others that dined in"

jamson0, 7 months ago, 1, 'I went to this restaurant last night and my experience was less than subpar.   They had one person taking orders and serving tables.  The guy must apologize to table and take out orders at least 20 times in an hour sitting which speaks\n\nFood was good though,  however I don‚Äôt like to be charged for things I am not aware of.  The same guy mentioned above asked us if we wanted the filet or hanger steak w the Medley,  obviously filet would always be our choice.  Where he failed was he didn‚Äôt tell me it was an extra charge for the filet.  The menu didn‚Äôt even say it which is big miss on the restaurant‚Äôs part.  No one wants to be surprised about an up-charge.\n\nThey also ran out of the eggplant at 7pm on a Saturday which didn‚Äôt really make sense with the Persian new year close ( I think).  Small menu. Should never run out of food\n\nI won‚Äôt go back'
Darek Michael, 8 months ago, 5, 'The chicken soltani.... WOWüòç I‚Äôve been going through the menu and ordering something new everything but this chicken prepared in their special yogurt sauce hits the spot great place to eat at or order on ChowNow!'
joanne Hazel Matthew, 9 months ago, 1, 'Ordered the Masto Khair and I must say it was the worst representation of of Persian food culture.  Ok, the yogurt sauce was doable but the bread was dry and stale.   I am having a really difficult time understanding how they can possibly sell stale bread and charge Money for the exchange.  The lamb kabob was a meager portion and the rice and stew was a child‚Äôs serving. The place is overpriced and the food is absolutely not good.'

Vibe inside is relaxed with a modern aesthetic, and service is super friendly. The cherry rice is drool-worthy - honestly would be worth going back just for that.

Kim Mattappallil, 2 years ago, 5, "The food was out of this world and the recommendations the waitress made were spot on. Had the chicken and ground beef kebabs, which were hands down the best I've ever tasted. We tried both beef stews as well (one with tahdig and one as an entree) and, while we preferred the one that had been suggested by the waitress, both were fantastic. It's hard to say whether we were more in love with the food or with the atmosphere/people."

Douglas Lindstedt, 2 years ago, 5, 'Exceptional is the only the beginning when describing the food here. This is some of the best tasting, flavorful and delicious food that I have ever had. It was such a pleasure to eat food that you can tell was crafted from an experienced chef that poured their heart into it.  The quaint ambiance only added to the phenomenal food. I left feeling satiated, not stuffed and uncomfortable, but perfectly satisfied even waiving off dessert because I did not want chance ruining the "good mouth feels" that dinner left me. If I could give Seven Valleys my own rating, it would be 12 stars out of 5. A true pleasurable memorable evening that will be repeated over and over again!'
Hen Pastry Chef, 2 years ago, 5, "I think it's the best persian restaurant I have been. And I have been in a lot ! The food is delicious. It doesn't seem like a typical persian restaurant it's quite modern.  small but warm and unic we really loved everything we tried and it was a lot. The plates are big so you can definitely order some and share.\nDist miss the cherries rice. For me it was the best!"
KM G, 2 years ago, 1, 'Absolute sham! Dont bother ordering from this place. Ordered a eggplant kabob and it didnt have a single piece of eggplant. The delivery guy was so late and lied to us that "he called like 20 times". We then waited outside for 20 mins before the food was delivered to us.'

Sanam Hashimi, 2 years ago, 1, 'The food is not good. The Shirazi salad was old. The cucumbers were setting in lemon juice for so long that became mushy. We asked for salad instead rice. Half a cup of mix spring and one olive and two cherry tomatoes. The portion was so small that we had to grab take out for dinner. Not recommending it.'
Kyle Reinfried, 2 years ago, 4, "Tried to go to seven valleys when it first opened, it was packed (it's a small space, but good for them) and they werent (still don't ?) take reservations.\n\nSo I returned a couple months later and very much enjoyed my meal. It was very good, pretty traditional Persian food. Persian food is very under represented in North Jersey, specifically Hoboken and Jersey City. I feel comfortable saying that having lived in both.\n\nIt was a little pricey for the size of the portions, at least compared to other Persian restaurants I've been to, like Ravagh in nyc. I can't say anything else negative about it. Every dish was delicious, in particular the lamb shank. The meat so easily pulling off the bone and the broth was delicious and great to poor over the rice."

I have tried their Koobideh, Beef, and Chicken dishes. The chicken kabob portion was a little bit small though. The owner was very friendly and nice.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new and different food in Hoboken.\n\nThe only drawback is the wait line. They do not accept reservation in advance and because of the limited space, you should expect to wait for a while to be seated.'

Christian martinez, 3 years ago, 3, 'Overall - Okay but over priced Persian food (other restaurants give more)\n\nI believe since it was the second day opening, and they didn‚Äôt expect their Tuesday to be overwhelmed with curious foodies.\n\nFirst, dinning area is very tiny the total square footage is about 180 sqft, fits about 7 tiny tables at most. I believe the back area is 4 times bigger than the dinning area.\n\nTheir decor is pretty nice\n\nNow, let‚Äôs talk about service and food.\n\nLike I mentioned before, I believe it‚Äôs due to them not expecting the crowd; these people had no idea how to control 3 couples that were waiting or where to seat them (due to the lack of space).\n\nThey have 1 waiter and possibly 1 cook, I had to get the manager to get us our food and drinks because there were too many people.\n\nOrdered the food, they forgot the appetizer.\n\nBrought the Kebobs, and the beef kebobs were not well cooked; they were partially turned into charcoal and then some parts were medium then the others were not cooked fully. (I‚Äôm not the type to complain at a restaurant).\n\nFor me, I don‚Äôt mind. But for my Persian GF, she felt disrespected for being served this. We‚Äôve been to plenty of Persian restaurants and never was given these smaller portions for the same price.\n\nI‚Äôll give it another shot, but I‚Äôm sure my Persian Gf won‚Äôt be excited...\n\nI‚Äôll share their portions vs other Persian restaurants portions.  Picture of Seven Valleys portion vs usual Persian restaurant.'
