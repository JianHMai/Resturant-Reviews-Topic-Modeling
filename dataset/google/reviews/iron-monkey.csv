Charm Golden, 2 days ago, 1, 'I had read about the heated igloos at this location it‚Äôs actually featured as a must do in the area .. my husband and I stopped in too get the igloo experience on the roof. An older grey haired man came too take us upstairs as I was getting a call as we were walking that my mother was being rushed too the ER. This grey haired man then took the opportunity too completely disrespect my husband about our choice of sitting on the roof ‚Ä¶ he said we could not have the igloos they were reserved for the night and kept saying ‚Äúyou know it‚Äôs cold right?‚Äù  He even went as far too say too my husband who is a black man ‚Äúyou people amaze me ‚Äú .. what does that mean .. then slammed us down ..in some dark area .. I am absolutely upset at this .. we were there November 16th 2021 in the evening .. the man was very rude..'
karisma kaye, 5 days ago, 1, "I've recently moved to jersey city and have read mixed reviews about iron monkey, but their menu was enticing so I decided to give it a shot.\nBY ALL MEANS REFRAIN FROM COMING TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT! I came for drinks and received minimum service. We ordered a salad to start and the Cesar salad was overdressed and steak was under cooked. Trying to be optimistic- we ordered beer and whiskey. After hearing conversations with other patrons who were not satisfied with the bill, we were curious to see what ours was. Jameson on the rocks (which was poured half a shot with ice) was under poured and charged $13.00!!!!!! Cesar salad alone was $20!!! The prices did not match the menu. Overall I will never come back, the service was minimal and their prices did not equate to an actual drink. I basically paid for $130 for ice and no steak."

So awful that I'm not a great cook but I can make better sandwiches than this chef.\n\nThe precious menu was awesome, the food was delicious. Their chicken schnitzel and meatballs were mouth watering!\n\nThe problem with this place is, the owner cannot sustain one chef or bartenders for a long time. I had stopped visiting this place since 2018 to summer 2020. When they opened it for take out during summer 2020, they had a new chef and the food was great! But seems like they just changed their chef recently, and I doubt if he's even a chef. Stay away, until further updates on the new chef."

Brielle Burton, a month ago, 1, 'I went to the iron monkey with a group of my friends we got sat down pretty quickly and ordered our food. after waiting for about an hour for food we talked to our server asking where our food is and she said that she would check and she never came back to us. then after waiting for another half an hour we decided to speak to a manager about where our food is and they explained that their kitchen was having trouble tonight. at first our waitress was very friendly and helpful but as soon as we started getting annoyed with the fact that we haven‚Äôt received our food for over an hour and 30 minutes she became disrespectful and had a terrible attitude towards us. my friend also wrote a review about our experience and the staff at the iron monkey basically told her that she was making stuff up and was telling her that the waitress never had an attitude with us. As someone who goes out to eat regularly I have been to places where the food is not to expectation and usually when I leave a review the management is quite nice with their feedback and what they have to say and I was really disappointed with what they said to my friend and honestly I think was disrespectful. I will not be coming back and I do not recommend. our server was stacey m.'
Dena N., a month ago, 1, "Not pleased with my experience at this bar. Came for happy hour and opted for outdoor seating. Ordered a peach sangria which was ok but before ordering food, our waitress Iryna informed us that she would need to have our method of payment beforehand.  She stated that this was a new policy implemented by the bar, to ensure that guests don't walk out on their bill. Others who have visited this establishment have said that this was never required of them, which made me suspicious.  Not sure what to think of this place. Decided in that moment that I didn't want to stay, paid for my drinks and ate lunch elsewhere. Wondering if this is a requirement for all of their customers......"

Ian Gordon, a month ago, 3, "The rooftop is sick, but the service is pretty terrible. Our server didn't write down any of our orders, we had 3-4 different people helping us throughout the meal and when we got the bill they charged us for 2 drinks we did not order or receive. When I called the next day to get a refund, the Asst Mgr assured me they would refund me and never did. I called 3-5 more times, only to get no answer and redirected to a voicemail box that was different from the one I had been calling. It's a shame the management here is poor because the food and atmosphere were amazing. Definitely going to think twice before returning here and definitely will be checking the bill at the table!"

A H, 4 months ago, 2, "Crowd was fine, bar is dated and goes from tacky whacky to kind chill on the roof, food was good, beers were great, anytime I overheard the manger she was talking about her wife or attempting to flirt with the females around instead of checking on our table because we had an angsty teen for a server that didn't want to be there. My work buddies seem to enjoy themselves and love a Scottish bartender and some kid who quit/fired but I haven't had the pleasure. We're heading in tonight after work so I'll update this review then and cross my fingers we get the right server. Definitely better rooftops to spend money at unless you need a particular beer they have on tap or work right around the corner like me.\n\nUPDATE! While I appreciate the timely response from mgmt below - my friends and I were stuck in the corner of an overcrowded bar and asked to wait for further instructions. Not one person knew what was going on and the manager was huffing around not helping the situation at all. We patiently waited and then were told we couldn't go upstairs without closing our tab. We should have been warned about that before sitting and no one wants multiple charges on their cards. By the time we got upstairs the infamous Scot was PO and yelling at everyone in sight. It was mildly entertaining but still. Sorry if the pandemic took your good staff but that's no excuse for the way your current staff operate. Probably try closing for a week or two with intensive training and a deep scrub."

I completely understand that with Covid there are staffing shortages and training learning curves, but the wait time was over two hours for a couple of drinks/food and the place was not very busy.\n\nThis place does have a great beer selection and wonderful rooftop seating area, but after the first round of drinks, we did not see or have any contact from our waiter or any other staff for over 30 minutes. Normally I would completely understand considering our waiter probably had other tables and looked to be in training, but the place did not seem to be busy (plenty of open tables) and there were other staff walking by and standing around the rooftop seating area who made eye contact with our empty drink glasses several times but never came over to offer refills or check in on us. It‚Äôs a shame because I would have gladly ordered a few more rounds to further patronize the business.\n\nThe food was decent, but a bit pricey for what you get. Drink prices were comparable to other places in the area.\n\nI‚Äôm not writing this review to tell anyone to not at least give this place a shot if you‚Äôre in the area (there‚Äôs a lot of potential for growth and I will be back for a second chance) but I‚Äôm hoping management will take my shared experience and hopefully use it to help make the business stronger during these tough times.'

Upon entering and asking for a table, we were told ‚Äúno, absolutely not‚Äù as if we were not of the stature of dining at the establishment. After double checking her reservations, the hostess informed us a bubble outside was available. I understand that with limited seating and, as we were informed, there was only once chef so the kitchen was backed up. Our appetizers and food were meant to come out separately, but ending up taking about an hour and 10 minutes and all the food came out at once. The food arrived barely warm. The waitress, after being informed the food was not hot, told us she would speak with the manager. 15 minutes later an irate man approached and came into our bubble, without a mask covering his face, and proceeded to scream at us that we were being too difficult and that we should understand they‚Äôre backed up. And yes, we did understand that, but we hadn‚Äôt expected some tater tots and a soft pretzel to take over an hour to make. The manager, after getting blue in the face from yelling and finally letting us speak, heard our concerns with the food temperature, the greeting upon entry, and the fact that we had not even gotten napkins or water. After him hearing us out, he handled getting us napkins and water and the hostess even came out and apologized. But to be quite frank, as someone who has worked in food service and has a bachelors degree revolving around food and food service, I am honestly appalled by how I was spoken to by the OWNER of this establishment and will not be dining here again.'

No one came to check on us to see if we were satisfied or if everything was ok. No waiters in sight to say anything . No one to take a drink order. So we have 30 minutes to eat cold food and on top of that they didn‚Äôt even bring everything we ordered to the table. So here we are from 645 pm to 758 pm; cold food, one drink. Telling us 90 minutes and a 80$ minimum. How? Oh and yea still no one !'
Bre TH, 10 months ago, 2, 'Hair was on our glass and napkin and the manager came to talk to us about it and he just grabbed the hair off the napkin and said he was sorry about that. He didn‚Äôt even try to get us a fresh napkin. The beer was good but they came in tiny glasses and they don‚Äôt fill them all the way up. Food was ok but not seasoned. The waitress was really nice about all the problems we were having but I just wish the manager would have done something to compensate for the hair we kept finding. We spent almost 100 dollars and was disappointed. Won‚Äôt be returning.'

We went there on a cold day and they offer small clear through tents you can sit in. They provide a heater in it which unfortunately keeps you not so warm. I recommend to ensure to have warm clothes if you sit outside.\n\nThey have a great variety of different beers. As a craft beer enthusiast you will find a lot of great options. They offer a six beer flight, which let you taste a lot.\n\nThe food was ok. Their food menu is huge and you will find a lot of different possibilities. The vegan / vegetarian options were a little less then at other places I've been to. I would check out the menu beforehand to see if you find something for you, if you don't eat meat.\n\nThe service was all the time great and friendly."
