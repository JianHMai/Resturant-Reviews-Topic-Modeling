Melanie Tam, a year ago, 3, "*Quarantine Delivery Review*\n\nGood Thai restaurants are slim pickin's in Hoboken. Judging from the reviews, it seems like Sri Thai is the best one in the neighborhood, so we decided to order dinner from there on a Thursday night via Uber Eats. That was when I found out that we have actually ordered from here before, because the app recommended some dishes to 'order again'. Clearly, it was not very memorable and this second time around, it was no different.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nChicken wings - these were actually pretty good. I loved the sweet chili sauce it came with\nPla Mueg Tod (fried squid) - underwhelming, and a bit soggy and bland. Good thing this also came with that sweet chili sauce\nPad Thai with shrimp - pretty basic. The noodle texture was good, but could have used more flavor. I solved that problem by adding some garlic chili sauce. The shrimp was kind of overcooked/dry. I added extra noodles for $2 and had more than enough for leftovers the next day\nLamb Pad Ped - this is not something we would normally order but my fiance said he wanted to try something new. It's basically slices of lamb and eggplant in a curry-like sauce. It surprisingly wasn't bad. The lamb didn't have any of that gamey taste that it can sometimes have. However, the meat was a bit tough. If they hadn't sliced it as thin as they did, it probably would not have been edible.\n\nNot sure I would order from here again. I think the next time we have a Thai food craving, I might just drive somewhere else for a pick-up instead."
J. Martin Wills, a year ago, 5, "You could not and can not, find a better Thai Kitchen around NJ-or-NYC.\nThis fine establishment, serving food like a TEN STAR RESTAURANT.\nVery kind and inviting owner from Thailand who makes every genuine dish with brilliance that's absolutely memorable and satiating.\n\nChicken Satay, chicken chili-basil.\n...although the Chicken Pad Thai is equally unforgettable, and couples with spring roll.\n\nLocal LEO's often kindly-lenient/considerate with unobtrusive motorcycle parking on sidewalk, allowing good visibility from BIG windows.  Street parking a truck can be a challenge, all the more, it's worth the effort of walking several blocks, to reach this corner.\n\nFOOD here's like eating from a TEN STAR RESTAURANT."

Kristina Bodnya, a year ago, 1, 'This is not the 1st time I’m putting “no onion please” in my online order and getting this much onion. Moreover, there’s no other vegetables in my rice except for a tiny piece of tomato. The rice itself is extremely dry as if it was cooked a week ago. I don’t think I’m gonna order from them again.'

Their best dish is Yum Ped (Crispy Duck salad), but we also had Koong Priew Wan (shrimp in  sweet & sour saurce with cucumber, pineapples & tomato) & Koong Supparod (hot & spicy shrimp with pineapple, cashew & chili sauce). You walk in and there are only a few seats, but this place is always busy with take-out orders. My only caveat is that they are closed on Tuesdays. Eat here! It is worth the trip. Flavor explosion!"

As for the food, not gonna lie I have been going to bangkok city for 7 years and this day, I happened to only stop by sri thai because bangkok was closed.\n\nWe had chicken curry, beef fried rice, and shrimp pad thai. Portions are smaller than bangkok but the food did come out in a timely manner. Honestly? Nothing too special, food was decent and satisfies the craving. I still prefer other thai restaurant but i also didnt leave feeling disappointed. :)'

Ry D’Lessio, 2 years ago, 5, "I've been to EVERY thai restaurant in Hoboken and Sri Thai WINS IT ALL! This is definitely my go-to spot when i'm in the mood for delicious thai food. As far as the interior goes, it's a tiny restaurant (about 6-8  traditional square tables give or take). This will not accommodate bigger parties of more than 7-10 people per table. Unless you don't mind sitting separately. The servers are attentive and kind. Price points wise:\naffordable. Party of 4 with 3 appetizers (small serving), 3 soups, and 4 main dishes includes white rice (from curry to noodles) came about less than $65 not including tax and tip. ** Kang Panang Curry is a MUST try! **\n\nLunch special from Mon-Fri is a steal! Less than $12, which includes your choice of Salad OR Soup - NOT BOTH, white rice and your main entree.\n\nside note: If you're a fan of EXTREME SPICY dishes, this place isn't for you. You might need to request hot oil on the side to add in to your entree."

Very light crust and great flavor. For entrees my BF had the red curry with beef and I had the yellow curry with squid. Both dishes spicy but tasty!  The Thai ice teas are sweet but had that authentic Thai tea flavor.\n\nIt was one of the staff’s birthday and the restaurant had a big feast for her- fish, shrimp, Thai noodles, etc.  They sung her happy birthday with a fruit cake which they shared a slice with us! Very nice gesture and the cake was so good!\nI’ll be back whenever I’m in Hoboken!'
