Shima, 3 weeks ago, 4, "I really like the food at this place, it's the best Thai food around here, but the service is not very good. They are slow and not accurate. Today we asked for spring rolls for our appetizer, after all the food was served the lady came to our table with something else and said we are out of spring rolls but you can try these. We were like we don't want these we want spring rolls but she said you should try these instead and thinking they were complimentary because they didn't have the spring rolls we accepted it. Then when we wanted to pay for our food the lady charged us for the thing we didn't order and when I said we didn't order them she said you had them!!! I was with a friend and I didn't want to argue so I ended up paying for the stuff but that was unacceptable!\nI'm so disappointed that such a great place has such a bad service!\nI recommend this place, but be careful about what you order and what you are being served!"

Michelle Bivas, 3 months ago, 1, 'my boyfriend and i ordered the garee puff, chicken pad thai, and pork pad see ew for delivery. the garee puff was flimsy and soft, not crispy at all and the filling was just okay. the pad see ew came with chicken instead of pork, and the flavor was off. the chicken pad thai straight up didn‚Äôt taste like pad thai. nothing tasted like it was supposed to and we couldnt finish even half of our meals even though we were still hungry. i never post reviews but felt obligated to post this. save your money and go elsewhere'

Marguerite Schneider, 7 months ago, 2, "I've been eating here since the restaurant opened several decades ago, and it was great.  Had lunch there today and it was NOT great, not even good.  We were the only occupied table, in part because the restaurant looked messy and not that clean.  There was a dirty napkin in my seat, which I had the waitperson remove.\n\nThey were out of chicken satay, not a big deal, so we agreed to chicken dumplings.  They were horrible!  Clearly frozen and microwaved, likely purchased in bulk.  The texture was terrible, chunky in a bad way.  And some parts were soggy. MucNuggets would be better.  I complained and they were removed with no apology.\n\nThe vegetable rolls were decent, the highlight of the meal.\n\nMy diet coke tasted funny.  Weird, I thought.  I checked the date on the can.  It has expired in June 2020, 9 months ago!  I brought this to the waitstaff, she didn't apologiz.  That she didn't provide a non-expired can was interesting.  I said that water would do.\n\nThe Massaman chicken had good flavor but the chicken was rubbery and the sauce was much too thin and inconsistent.  We left about 1/2 of it. Not much peanut flavor.\n\nThe waitstaff rushed us throughout the overly quick lunch, bringing the heating up chicken while we were just starting the apps.  I told her to stop rushing us.  Rushing us in a totally empty place.\n\nThe waitstaff removed the dumplings and coke from the bill.  I think she was the only one on duty at lunch, serving and heating up/microwaving.  They had a few takeout orders, those people who think anything takeout is good.\n\nMaybe it was a bad day, or maybe this place has really fallen.  That's a shame. I now places are cutting back on costs with reduced business due to covid, but this was not a reasonable meal."

Mimi Chicotel, 4 years ago, 1, "Came here for lunch take out, horrible customer services. First they tried to sell us cold random take out food. After talking a while, she allowed me to order hot food. My friend ordered a salad, the lady said to her cash only because her salad is less than $10. When my friend gave her a $20 bill, the mean lady said don't you have a smaller bill? I ordered food from lunch menu, the mean lady charged me from the regular menu. When I asked, she said next time I need to tell her. I mumbled next time I won't come again. She charged me for the smaller amount and said she would void the larger amount later. I insisted her voiding the charge in front of me, she gave me a face of disgust. Food took a long time to be ready. Horrible attitude! I don't know they did it on purpose, other reviewer said it has no taste but my Pad Thai requires 5 cup of water to dilute it down the saltiness. Or the ladies just don't hate us so much to add more salt to our food."
