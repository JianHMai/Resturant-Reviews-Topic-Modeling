Jenny Lukose, a month ago, 4, "Loved the vibes plus the waiters and staff were super friendly- you could tell they actually care about your dining experience. The food itself was why I reduced the star- it was good but nothing crazy. We felt like it wasn't seasoned enough but maybe that's just our personal preference. I'd still recommend it because it's such a cute place."
Ryan McLaughlin, a month ago, 1, "Service was good but thats about it.\n\nFood in general is extremely bland. My friend and I ordered the traditional couscous bowl as suggested but it was so dry it was practically inedible. After adding 2 bowls of broth, which also lacked any real flavor, we just stopped eating.\n\nWhen asked about why we didn't like it one of the managers suggested another (3rd bowl) of broth. Didn't seem to understand that neither the bowl nor broth had any flavor."

When I walked inside I realized it was a causal dress type vibe and after reading the menu, reservations are to be made. I cod also be wrong about that. However, they welcome us with open arms!!!! What I love the most more than the food, is the family atmosphere. They actually sit down together and eat together. I love that!!! But this LAMB though.....so freaking tender and the combination of seasoning, I can't even explain. Please try is all I can say. Drinks are so different in a good way!!! I will definitely come back and recommend!! Thanks for a great experience!!!!"

The appetizers are prepared according to Moroccan Cuisine, just the correct amount of spice and herbs. The main dishes are also various and well-prepared.

The proportions of foods served are generous. There is a full bar. Finally, the service is perfect! They are attentive to customer‚Äôs needs without spending too much time at the table.

Valentina Locatelli, 2 months ago, 2, 'This is the second time I dine here and I got back to give the place a second chance to surprise me!\nTuesday night, 7:30pm, me and my girl friend go there for dinner.\nWe order one appetizer (delicious) and two entrees. I asked if the spicy sauce can be on the side or completely removed, if not I\'d order something else. The waiter noted that down and said "absolutely no problem".\nAt 8:45 the waiter comes out saying that there is a delay in the kitchen and our meal would be out soon - no big deal we were having a good time.\nAt 9:20 the entrees got out brought by someone that was not the waiter, her is perfect and very good. Mine is floating in harissa sauce. At that point I ate most of the couscous that wasn\'t soaked (and that was good) but couldn\'t have the whole meal because of the spiciness.\nThe waiter then came and asked how everything was and I said that probably something went wrong in the kitchen and that his note got lost, we went back in to check and few minutes after came out apologizing of the mistake.\nNo big deal again we were having a good time.\nJust before leaving (10:30pm) he came out once more asking (and here I am quoting) "do you have a dessert for your netflix show tonight? or can i pack some baklawa for you?"\nI thought that was very nice so we said yes! the doggy bag came out and few minutes after the check....\nThey charged us for the whole meal (which is fine even if they made a mistake on my order) AND for the baklawa to go!!!\nI let the reader draw conclusions but I\'m sure I won\'t give the place a third chance.'

Darwin Cipion, 10 months ago, 1, 'I had a terrible experience here. They offered me a table outside in the cold and the heater at my table didn‚Äôt have gas. I asked them to moved inside the restaurant which they did after 45 minutes. Once inside I placed my order and I asked the waiter for Quinoa instead of fries because I can‚Äôt eat fry foods. The next thing he does? He brings me a whole plate of fries. I asked him to replace my order with another dish which he didn‚Äôt. I try to get someone to notice me to change my order and everyone was busy with other tables. The manager noticed me after a while and came to my table and took the replacement order which took forever. The only reason I stayed is because I was with my fianc√© and she was starving and try our best to make the best of the situation after all it was our anniversary. I didn‚Äôt touch the lamb dish with the fries and asked them to remove it and they still made me pay for. It was the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had in a restaurant. I wanna say they are understaffed, because if that‚Äôs how they treat guess they should not be in business. They should get more people to better their service.

Well, the Pandemic has been happening since March. That was 9 months ago. So you're telling me it's been 9 months and they still haven't yet updated their hours on their website or on Google? What a disappointing first impression of a restaurant I was looking forward to eating at. I think it's about time they updated the hours on the website so that more people don't have this same negative experience and bad impression. They've had plenty of time to update their website.
