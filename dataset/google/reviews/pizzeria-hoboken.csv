Super thin crust, lots of sauce and cheese, with a slight smoked flavor as they use real pizza ovens.\n\nTalk about consistent!  The slices are the same every time, even nearly years later.  I don't think I've had a single bad slice."
J Ashley, 11 months ago, 1, "Prices are soooooo much higher than they should be considering the quality. I don't think they put any salt in the alfredo I ordered.

Just not a hearty slice. Its sizable but it's not worth 4.00.

Oddly enough we have yet to try the actual pizza but that is next.\n\n*update* the food has still been good but on one occasion I ordered a hot pepper and pepperoni pizza that was not great. Some of the stems were still on the peppers and they were cooked under the cheese, making the pizza very runny. (As a result, now 4 stars). Try their cheesesteak, salads, and chicken soup... all were very very good. I have also had pizza slices from here that were tasty as well; it was just the one aforementioned pizza that was lacking. Overall, the portions are fairly large and they are very accommodating.'

Worst $16 of my life.\n\nEnded up paying over $30 for 2 slices of pizza, 2 crap salads, and 2 flat fountain sodas.\n\nWhen asking them about it they just played dumb and said it was tax, even though there was already another line item for taxes.\n\nHorrible business practices for a local pizza joint. It\'s unfortunate that they\'re trying to shaft locals who could easily become regular customers.'
