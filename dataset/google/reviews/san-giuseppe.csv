With 4 types of seating areas & available bar til midnight nearby,  it’s an amazing experience. Back to the pizza, cheese is so fresh, sauce is full of flavor & crust is so good nothing will be left!

Narin Ahmed, a year ago, 5, 'Excellent food (try their margarita pizza, house made cheese ravioli, bread sticks, meat balls and beet salad... everything is delish but those are our favs!) There’s ample outdoor, socially distanced seating and friendly staff. If you have small kids like I do, there is enough space for them to run around, ride their scooter, or play in the enclosed soccer area right next to the parking lot if they finish dinner early.  It’s never too busy or loud, so we always feel like we have personalized service! We have wondered why people opt for the loud and extremely busy other spots on Washington or 14th (where the food is also just not as good) - but we realized that many people probably don’t know the restaurant is even there because it’s about a block away from 14th and Willow.  Easily walkable from Jersey City and Union City if you are close to the 14th street bridge.\n\nHighly recommend this local, family owned business especially for a nice night out for dinner during this quarantine (and post, whenever that happens).'
Natalie, a year ago, 5, 'Food was delicious for a small restaurant not in the main part of Hoboken.  The Burrata cheese, prosciutto and roast peppers appetizer was yummy.  The linguine el dente with white clams had a great sauce.  Lastly, the chicken francese was great.  Good outdoor seating and free parking.  Also, the price is good.  I highly recommend!'

Anne Liegel, a year ago, 5, 'I really just love this place. I was super excited to see they recently reopened after closing for a bit during Covid. Anything I ever order is always out of this world and you can always rely on their delivery (an area I feel most restaurants in this area lack). They also have a good delivery radius (I moved from Hoboken to Paulus Hook and they reach me)! Once we can stop social distancing I also recommend them for parties. Joe hosted a birthday for me a few years ago and worked so patiently with my family to ensure everything was just as we envisioned. There was so much food and everyone had such a great time. Thanks for keeping me well fed and keep up the good work you guys!! Hope to see you in person soon.'

Owner was friendly at first but then kept his distance once he saw the look of disappointment on my dates face, made no attempt to improve our experinece.

Mica Nkusi, 2 years ago, 1, 'First time ordering from here and it was terrible. Found them On seamless/grub hub and ordered one minestrone soup., spaghetti & meatballs , & kids spaghetti & meatballs. The minestrone looked like someone just salted chicken broth & put in some vegetables. If you look at the attached pic you can see this soup has clear broth unlike what a real minestrone  is. Tried about 4 spoons & dumped the rest of that salted water.\nThe spaghetti & meatballs were equally as woeful. Barely had any seasoning, dry as heck & flavorless. Not sure what was in the tomato source but it wasn’t very good either.\nAlso, the regular spaghetti & meatball order ($18) is practically the same amount as the kids order($10)- except for one measly meatball.  Basically charge you   $8 for the xtra meatball. Ripoff.\nOrder came complete with some burnt bread.\n\nWould not order from here again'

This was the first time I’ve ever eaten at or reserved any of my events at San Giuseppe, and I can truly say I’d return and do business with them again. I felt like I was in good hands from the very beginning. The manager (great guy; very professional and personable) allowed me to close down the restaurant on a Friday night for a small wedding reception of a little over 30 people. Not only did he cater a food menu that was specific to my liking and needs, but the food and dessert were hands-down DELICIOUS; left me and my guests wanting more! They were also able to accommodate my reception set up: I was able to set up small center pieces, a dessert table, and a backdrop; everything looked beautiful. The staff was super friendly, attentive, and detail-oriented from beginning to end, and the space was the perfect size for my dinner. Their location is right inside the parking lot, which is extremely convenient, especially in Hoboken. And for everything I got (location, privacy, amazing food, friendly service, venue size and cleanliness, and overall the manager’s and his team’s hospitality, hard work, and attention to detail) the price I paid was very reasonable. I was very grateful for how much of an easy going process they made everything. Overall, I love everything about it, and I would definitely recommend anyone to visit and try out San Giuseppe! You won’t be disappointed! THANK YOU San Giuseppe, we will hopefully see you again soon!'

We were a little late in picking it up, so it was a bit cold when we snuck a slice outside but even then, it was still really good.

Scott Cooper, 4 years ago, 1, "Dreadful service.  Wretched food.  At least the men's room was clean!\n\nThis place used to be good, but the last few experiences have been pretty awful.  We went there for dinner this weekend -- one of the two entrees we ordered was inedible.  We would have loved to have brought that fact to the attention of our waitress, but neither she nor any other staff member passed by our table for 15 minutes.  Then, when we told her the dish was inedible, that we were dissatisfied, and that we just wanted the experience to (mercifully) end by her bringing us the check, her response was to ask whether we wanted her to wrap the offensive entree, as though she didn't listen to a word we said.  But that's not the end of this story.  After another 15 minutes of watching the waitress ignore us, we had to get up and ask her, a second time, for the check.  She told us a manager was handling it.  For another five minutes (20 minutes after we first asked for the check), we watched the manager do absolutely nothing to get us our check.  Not wanting to spend the entire night in this restaurant, I again got up to ask for my check (our third such request), this time by speaking directly to the manager.  He was at the register, asked me if I was sitting at Table 19 (as though I worked there and knew the restaurant's table numbering system), and told me he would get me the check in a few minutes.  At this point, the sheer incompetence on display was as amusing as it was infuriating, so I shook my head, sat back down at my table, and pulled out my phone to write a review.  Then, a few minutes later, the manager came over and brought me a check ... for the wrong table!!!\n\nBy the way, the restaurant was pretty much empty while all this was happening.  I can see why."
Andrew Cucinotta, 4 years ago, 5, 'The pizza is by far the best in Hoboken, heck might even be all of NJ. The menu has explanded and the place\nlooks totally renovated. The Salmon was fantastic as well. Great place to have a party, romantic evening, or just to grab something quick and go. This place has it all and I hope it sticks around for a long time.'

Ángel M. Fernández-Ruiz, 4 years ago, 5, 'Small and cozy place to bring the family or gather with friends for delicious food and a good time. If you bring your own bottled wine, they will uncork it for you and break out the glasses as well. Attentive waitstaff is also a plus. Plus free parking in front of the restaurant!'

Drew Pronko, 4 years ago, 4, "My favorite place for pizza... thin crust and a selection of combinations (try the prosciutto & arugula). The burrata is also the best I've had. Overall, well-made Italian dishes, served in a modern space (with parking!). It's BYOB so remember to pick up a bottle on the way over."

Nicholas Casci, 5 years ago, 1, 'I\'m not sure why this place has any more than two stars. Pros: we were seeing a movie and I wanted Italian, large men\'s room Cons: the worst service I\'ve  ever had in Hoboken and thoroughly average food.\n\nWe had 90 minutes before our movie, but that doesn\'t mean your wait staff should completely ignore their respective tables. The servers consciously went out of their way to position themselves so that they deliberately avoided eye contact with us. I went outside to make a reservation at Carpe Diem after going 15 minutes without even acknowledgment.\n\nSadly, we had finally been addressed and my girlfriend had placed our order. I was 70/30 for leaving, but our server put our order in and has disappeared for who knows how long. And man, that was a mistake.\n\nGf said the server apologized for the "unusually long wait" at peak time on a Friday. But instead of keeping an eye on us to ensure we had a better experience, the same kind of deliberate ignoring continued.\n\nWe were initially served half a rocks glass of water, about one mouthful of room temperature disappointment. We were never asked if we wanted to order wine (we did). We were served our bread about 45 seconds before our only dishes came out. We weren\'t provided or offered olive oil or butter for the bread. We weren\'t offered cheese or pepper for either of our pasta dishes, which I have to admit is a first for this Italian at an Italian restaurant.  When the table next to us finally were addressed after a similar 15 minute wait, same eye contact avoidance and we couldn\'t get more water.\n\nWhen we finally got her attention, the check unsurprisingly came immediately. Although after leaving it on our table with the card sticking out, I had to basically thrust it into her face to get her to accept payment.\n\nAnd the sad thing is, the food wasn\'t even that good. My lasagna was about an inch thick and looked like someone had flattened it with a frying pan. And the sauce was incredibly acidic as if they had opened a can of crushed tomatoes and let it simmer for five minutes.  The gnocchi with pesto was okay but needed some kosher salt and pepper, which we never got. And even the dry bread we were given at the same time as our main dishes couldn\'t make these bland sauces appealing.\n\nThe place is also designed horrendously with the hostess stand in the middle side next to the service counter and a table so you\'re guaranteed to be in someone\'s way.\n\nThe men\'s bathroom is huge, which is a plus.\n\nWe will never return. It takes a lot to get a 10% tip. Actually it takes very little service.'

Katie Lane, 9 years ago, 4, "The coal-fired pizza is top notch - just enough char, but not too much.  The crust is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy and the tomato sauce is just a bit sweet.   It's not the slightest bit greasy or sloppy - you can eat it right out of the oven without being covered in juices.  Gramaldi's may have the history, but I think this pizza is better and its served in a ambiance that doesn't make you feel like you're offending them when you place an order."
William Waldner, 9 years ago, 5, "I have been here a couple times now and the food is delicious! The wings are really tasty but the pizza is really AMAZING. I have been to many places in NYC and this is by far the best pizza, if you like thin crust.  Perfect crust and just the right amount of cheese to sauce ratio. We also tried the pasta, and drank plenty of wine (BYOB).  The sauce is just like homemade sauce. It's a new restaurant so go there while it's still a secret."
