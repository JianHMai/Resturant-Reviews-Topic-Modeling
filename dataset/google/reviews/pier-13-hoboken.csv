Juan Jos√© S., 2 months ago, 2, 'I was there and it seemed that the preferred people there were people coming in groups. I was let in and told to go to the end of the pier, where most people were and no sort of physical distance was happening. A handful of those groups were already holding seats for their friends that did not get there yet, meaning NO plastic chairs were even available, while loads of tables sat empty. How is it that those can sit empty for ‚Äúcapacity‚Äù reasons but the single plastic seats were all occupied? Don‚Äôt even bother coming here if you plan coming alone or with your partner, you won‚Äôt enjoy the view and people will claim seats for hours for their late friends. I noticed that management has no policy about that, but they make sure you don‚Äôt, God forbid, sit in the emptier areas because they‚Äôre not open (I‚Äôm going to guess that it‚Äôs for capacity reasons), but please consider spacing your patrons out, just my two cents. The food and drinks are decent, I will give Pier 13 that, and not overpriced.. it‚Äôs typical for the waterfront areas IMO.'

Sean Truman, 2 months ago, 2, "I really want to like this place but they need to chill on the rules a little. It's like they enjoy enforcing rules that just hinder their sales. First time we went we couldn't sit on the grass because there was only 2 of us, second time we went we couldn't sit on the grass because we had a dog, third time we went we had a two hour time limit and were basically kicked off our table mid way through our second round (no heads up the time was nearing), last visit we couldn't go in because I had a small, folded up electric scooter..... I can have a dog move around but not a small scooter, on a Tuesday, when it was fairly empty.... The place is good but so uptight. We used to go often cause we like space and a great drinks menu, but we are going to stop."

I was accompanied by colleagues and our purpose of our visit was to see if this was an establishment I can bring gentleman from my group home to visit . I order 3 drinks and all 3 times the gentleman serving my drink through them down on the table . The 3rd time the drink spilled on me . I asked the same server if can bring me some napkins so I can clean myself off , the server rolled his eyes and said we don‚Äôt supply napkins even though he threw the drink on me . I then requested to speak to a manger. The general manager ‚ÄúWill‚Äú approached our party asking what‚Äôs the problem. I explained the severer spilled a drink on me and as I was explaining the story I gestured in the direction of the server and Will the general manager who refused to give me his full name said I was being rude for gesture and he‚Äôs trying to help me . He became angry at our party and said he‚Äôll take the drinks back . I then asked for the servers name and he said he felt uncomfortable doing so . I was really offended and all I was expecting was an apology. The general manager Will said that isn‚Äôt possible and me and me and my party can leave .I‚Äôm not sure if this is how you decide to run your establishment but I will highly recommend my peers not to come into this facility unless the want drinks thrown at them . As far a will the general manager he made the issue impossible to be resolved and rather lose the business. I would like to know if this will ever be rectified or will I have to go about the matter in a legal way .'

Despite arriving on a quiet Tuesday evening, where there appeared to be almost as many staff as customers, we were seated at an uncomfortable table next to a loud speaker playing inappropriate EDM music that did not match the vibe of a weekday spring evening. This table was next to the bar, away from the views. It was probably the worst table in the house. There were at least a dozen empty tables on the perimeter of the pier where it‚Äôs obviously preferable to sit. When we asked to move tables, no one would give us a straight answer about whether we could do that - each staff member passed us off to someone else. 10 minutes later we were told that once you are seated you can‚Äôt move (because of COVID). Wish someone had used common sense to seat us somewhere decent, or at least asked us whether we were happy with the table before we made an irrevocable error by sitting down!\n\nWe left promptly and didn‚Äôt try the food or drinks, but the food trucks were pretty uninspiring. It‚Äôs a shame because the views are amazing and it‚Äôs a unique location. I would like to return if they they would hire more caring staff, focus a bit more on hospitality and cater to a wider range of visitors with a more tasteful approach. There is a lot of unrealized potential here. Try creating a welcoming atmosphere instead of an awkward heavily guarded music festival vibe.'

Inez Gonzalez, a year ago, 3, "Was at this place last week and it was a very nice experience. Obviously with COVID there is waiting time but other than that I had no trouble getting in so I decided to go again yesterday as it was my last day in the city. I got turned away because I didn't have a second I.D., my friend who had been checked before me did not get asked her for a second identifier which I found a little odd. I would suggest the pier invest on an I.D. scanner instead of constantly bending I.D. to verify validity. Also, for future reference the list of policies that are at the entrance of the pier should be placed on the website where it is easily read this way tourists don't waste time finding and paying for parking just to get turned away."

Once inside they bring you to your table where you'll be staying the whole time. They are definitely taking precautions for the pandemic. Must wear masks when getting food or going to the bathroom but once seated you can take it off. Great views but expensive drinks. They provide a QR code at your table for you to see the menu for drinks! I recommend getting the bottle of mixed drinks for the table!!"

A Google User, a year ago, 1, 'I went there ,with my husband and my friends that were visiting from a different state. Since everyone has to stay in line because of new regulations of Covid-19 , I saw people tip the manager and getting inside without staying in line. So my husband said to the general manager ,that that‚Äôs not fair . He was super rude and said you have to leave because you don‚Äôt like our rules. I tried to explain to him that not liking the rules and braking the rules is a different thing. So ,based on what do we have to leave? He insisted that he has the right to let in the bar who he wants, and lied and said that that rule is written in their policy. I said to him you need to calm down because we are not leaving, and the owner of this beautiful place will not be happy knowing the way you are doing your job. He said you will do me a favor if I get fired. He embarrassed us so much in front of our friends and a long line of customers.\nI hope I will be able to go back when this place hires qualified people, that know how to do their job.i hope no one has to experience what we went through today.'
