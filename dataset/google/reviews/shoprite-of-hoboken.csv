Joy Gertner, 2 days ago, 2, "Aisles go on forever.\nOk store. In this time you, need to improve product selection in terms of more healthier items. More organic and competing with TJ's, Whole Foods, Wegman's you are having competition that can wreck you. You are actually a 'department store' of food and non food but still need improvement."
Toxichammertoe, 3 days ago, 4, "This place has more of a variety for healthy conscience people, The Only reason I give it 4 stars is because it's not as big as the super shoprite"
Andrew Freeman, 5 days ago, 4, "The store itself is great and has nice quality. Their butcher isn't the best so don't expect high quality steak here. My biggest complaint though that drops a star is the deli department. They are painfully slow and will add an extra half hour to your shopping trip no matter how many people are there."

Frank Sikernitsky, 2 weeks ago, 5, 'This may be the best Shop Rite in the entire chain. It doesn‚Äôt have the warehouse-y or dated feel of many of the other locations. It‚Äôs clean, has an extensive meat department, parking, and prices are very good compared to most of the local competition. The staff has always done right by me. They recently changed about half the checkouts to self-service, which I personally like. It can get very crowded on Sundays and around holidays.'

I mean I can't see it getting any worse.\nConsistently jacking up the prices and extremely poor quality produce over the last few months.\nMost items are marked up higher to the Jersey City. To top it - poor quality produce.\nConsistently got stale oranges for e.g.\nIf I had a car, I would have never visited this place again.\n\nPrevious: Good quality.\nHas a wide range of fresh grocery.\nWish they had a small section for Indian grocery like the one in Jersey City."

stella ng, 2 months ago, 1, 'The disrespect received from this store is absolutely unacceptable. To turn away people in need of a shelter during the hurricane about 2 weeks ago, how much humanity left does the manager of this store have? Furthermore, the people they turned away when they needed shelter, one was someone who works in healthcare. They risked their lives saving people, sacrificing their health and life for somebody else. What if one of the shop-rite workers had been in a life-threatening situation and had been turned away simply because the hospital is closed? You really couldn‚Äôt even open up the lobby space for helpless people to find shelter?\nThis situation really shows how much we can‚Äôt depend on each other.\nIf you have any morales, please boycott this particular shop rite. Corporate needs to rethink management on this store.\nIn fact, I don‚Äôt even trust what the corporate offices‚Äô policy are for each store, but this reflect that a change in the policy is needed.\nShop rite, you really let us down on this one.'

Alvaro Rangel, 2 months ago, 1, 'Today was my first time and last time at this store. When I was checking out the cashier was taking her time as if there were not a bunch of people behind me in line. She looked like she could care less about her job. My grandma could literally probably scan items faster than her. Anyways that‚Äôs not the biggest problem, the biggest problem was when I tried to ask her about water jug refills and she looked at me with so much disgust and annoyance. What a rude staff. I don‚Äôt know why people act this way. If they hate their job they should leave and go do something else. I hate this sort of entitlement from people. I hope management makes changes soon but will not be returning ever.'

Alice, 2 months ago, 1, 'If I could give this store -1 stars, I would. The manager of the store was so unempathetic and selfish. During the Ida hurricane/flash flood that took lives in New Jersey, a couple of people wanted to seek shelter to stay warm and dry. However, during closing time, she kicked everyone out and had the attitude of, "you\'re on your own". What if something happened to those people because of her decision? She only thought about herself and the store and not the lives of the people morally. Understand that when store closes, people who are not employees should leave. BUT THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY THAT WAS LIFE THREATENING. Aren\'t people supposed to help each other during an emergency? Be kind hearted? One person I know that experienced this is a pharmacist in a hospital and was stuck in the flood after getting off from work. HE HELPS SAVE LIVES. What does he get in return? SOMEONE TRYING TO KICK HIM OUT IN AN EMERGENCY. HIS CAR GOT SUBMERGED IN WATER. IT\'S GONE. I will never put my money on this shop rite because of the unethical treatment this manager gave.

Abel Salcedo, a year ago, 1, 'Care must be taken when using the ShopRite Hoboken self-checks. After 10 minutes of buying 4 avocados for $ 8.00 and leaving the market, I was charged $ 104.01 to my debit card for a purchase that I never made because it had already left. They do not give me the purchase slip or a copy or the list of products of that purchase, they simply ignored giving me the answer "Not having any record of the purchase, and that I managed with the bank that is the one who should take care of my money, not them". The bank say my pin was used.'

The majority of the check-outs have been converted to self check-outs resulting in a mad dash to scan and then bag your groceries at the same time, which is particularly difficult if you're shopping alone. What I'm sure was intended to maximize efficiencies has actually made the check-out process more of a nuisance with long lines and lack luster service."
