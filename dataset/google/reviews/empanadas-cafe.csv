I‚Äôm not sure if there was change in management or what, but this place is going downhill. Firstly, the shrimp empanada used to be very delicious - one of the best there - but the last few times there was something very off about them. It seems like the quality of shrimp is different or they are not cooking them as well. Next, they got rid of their outside patio and there is nowhere to enjoy the empanadas outside. This was perfect for us because they are NOT pet-friendly inside and we like to go there with our little dog. Lastly, the customer service is non-existant. The women who manage the register are very rude and do not know how to work with customers. In short, OK empanadas, NO patio, and HORRIBLE customer service. No more business from us!'

James Park, 3 years ago, 5, "I'm a huge empanada fan and every time I visit Hoboken to hangout with my friends, I make sure to pay a visit to this store! The empanadas are so fresh and the outer crust has a perfect consistency of crunch and softness. They also have a wide variety of different flavors which makes very indecisive because you can‚Äôt go wrong with any of them.\n\nI can't wait to pay another visit soon!\n\nAlso, for more NJ local reviews, check out my Instagram @dailymealhabits"

Amoi H., 3 years ago, 5, "I've tried the cheese, guava & cheese, Philly cheesesteak, chorizo and spicy chicken, and pulled pork. The spicy chicken is really good (even better than the chorizo surprisingly) but the pulled pork is definitely the best of all the ones I had. It has the perfect amount of bbq flavor.\n\nI love cheese empanadas and theirs did not disappoint!"
