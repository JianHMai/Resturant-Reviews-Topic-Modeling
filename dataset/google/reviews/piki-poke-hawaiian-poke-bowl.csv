Ana West, 3 months ago, 3, 'Decent place for poke in the area, my issue is that I had poke in Hawaii and keep comparing it. Place is very clean, easy to order it, with many options. The fish is not the best and the portions are small. Ordered extra for my poke bowl.'

Hanna Nicole, 10 months ago, 5, 'Definitely worth the price! The ingredients tasted fresh, and unlike many poke restaurants I‚Äôve visited, they aren‚Äôt stingy with toppings and sauces. The selection of ingredients is great for customizing your own bowl and they offer signature bowls with their own combinations of ingredients. Overall, ordering is simple, the service is fast, especially when there is no wait, and you can order online in advance anyway to avoid waiting in line. Additionally, this place is located in a great spot right by two great bubble tea spots and only a couple blocks from the beautiful waterfront.'

Joe Elmasri Jr., a year ago, 1, 'I am extremely disappointed with this establishment. This place was a go to of mine....ordering from this place 2-3 times a week. I recently had a terrible experience where there was something very hard in my food (I‚Äôm my opinion a small rock) While taking a bite, I bit down and ended up chipping my tooth. I called the manager, (Johnny) the next day after I had to make an emergency visit to the dentist as my molar was killing me to have my tooth fixed. Thinking this place would do the right thing and cover my $276.00 bill the manager did not take responsibility at all m, denying that anything was in my food and basically calling me a liar. No store credit or anything. The way in which the manager handled this issue was exceptionally unprofessional and even more disappointing that as one of their better customers they made zero effort to retain my business. Needless to say I will be taking legal action against this restaurant and never ordering from this place again as there are plenty of other Poke bowl places in hoboken. (Shaka Bowl,  Proven Poke)'

Hector Hernandez, 2 years ago, 5, 'Cool interior design. They got cucumber water for free. You get to order from a place card that you hand in where you get to see all your options on paper before your order it which is really helpful vs other places where you hold up a line pointing to things and asking what they are. Only complaint is that I don‚Äôt eat poke bowls often so had no idea what half the options were so I‚Äôm missing out but it‚Äôs definitely not a big deal if you‚Äôre not shy to ask or take a shot in the dark and try things you don‚Äôt know. The pricing is VERY reasonable in comparison to other places. You‚Äôll only pay a pretty penny if you overload your bowl with a ton of toppings. They were prepared very quickly and the presentation was impeccable. Most importantly the bowls were DELICIOUS. Everything is fresh and flavorful and many of the items are organic if you care about that. Best poke spot I‚Äôve been to to date.'

Melanie Tam, 2 years ago, 4, "Dropped in on a late Sunday afternoon at around 2 when my BF and I were looking for a quick/healthy-ish lunch. I suggested poke bowls and I knew Piki Pok√© had just opened. Plus I saw they had a Yelp check-in offer for 15% off your first order.\n\nI decided to build my own bowl. I had the purple rice as a base, salmon and tuna for protein, corn, sweet onion, and cucumber for mix-ins (max 3), poke sauce and spicy mayo for flavor (max 3), and seaweed salad, spicy furikake, crabmeat salad for toppings (max 3). They also  had Parmesan cheese available as a topping, which I thought had no business being there. Overall, it was a pretty good bowl. But if I could change three things, it would be 1. Add zucchini noodles as a base 2. Bigger scoops of protein (my BF did the three proteins and it looked like the same amount I'd get for two proteins at my usual poke spot in NYC. 3. Unlimited mix-ins, like most NYC poke joints have.\n\nNot a bad option for poke bowls but I think next time, I'll try some of their rice balls."
