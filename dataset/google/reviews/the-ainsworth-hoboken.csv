J Spiegel, 2 months ago, 5, 'I never post reviews but I had to post this one because it was such a great experience.\nHad my daughters 16th birthday dinner for 12 kids and it was so easy to plan, so easy once we arrived and they all loved their meals. The staff there was attentive, friendly and didn’t miss anything. We had another table just for 4 adults separate from the kids beautiful set up in another space, and I didn’t once worry. I plan events for business and I have to say Haylee and staff confidentially pull your event together so you don’t have to worry at all! Super reasonable pricing for a party, good food, made me look like a really smart MOM! Thank you Ainsworth!!!'

Emily Cummings, 2 months ago, 1, "Sat here on a Saturday night, waited 10 mins and  said something to the bartender who told me he couldn’t serve me and he’d send someone. Waited another 10 mins said something to another person who said someone would be right w me. 5 mins later I left. What a terrible place, who makes you wait 25 minutes for service, with EMPTY tables and slow crowd. Wild.\n\n***Wanted to update my review***\n\nCame here 2 Sundays ago to give them a second shot, the waitress butched our order and the salad gave me food poisoning. Was sick for 2 days. I know it was the salad because after a few bites it tasted off to me so i stopped eating it. We had our son with us and asked for water for him and she gave me a glass cup for him... not so safe for a 1 year old kid, but maybe they don't have child friendly options since there is no kid friendly food options either. Extremely over priced for the food / service you receive. Save yourself the time and money and try out one of the other restaurants next door- they are all far superior to this dump."

Jacqueline Browne, 2 months ago, 5, 'I had a private event at the Ainsworth last weekend for my birthday and it went amazingly! The event planner I emailed back and forth with was very responsive and flexible with all of my questions. The event itself was so much fun. The back part of the restaurant was secured off for the event with 2 private bar tenders - Alex and Shanelly. They were very attentive to all of guests and very nice. They helped set up the cake and cannolis I had brought and displayed it out for the guests. Even when I first walked in the hostess was very friendly and helpful. Wonderful event! If you need a place to have your event, the Ainsworth will for sure do a beautiful job.'
Mackenzie W, 2 months ago, 5, 'My friends and I went for an after happy hour dinner and it was great! The food was delicious, the service was wonderful.

Philip Leotardo, 2 months ago, 1, 'After doing 20 years in the can, me and my kid brother Billy needed to grab a bite after doing a pick up from the Esplanade in Newark. Ho’ lemme tell ya, the way they run things here, it’s all sorts of messed up and they have no respect for our thing. I knew something was wrong the second I took my seat, I didn’t feel like I was sitting at 12 o’clock. I could have sat in there until freakin San Gennaro, I would not have been sitting at 12 o’clock. They tried to tell me it seemed ok to them, how could it be ok if it’s askew? We had no idea who our server was the entire time, nobody checking up on us. Had to grab the attention of anybody that walked by for anything we needed. Drinks, plates, food, the bill, etc. just flat out bad service. A lot of compromises had to be made. I wanted Fried Calamari. I compromised. I was given low quality frozen Shoprite tier Onion Rings instead. I wanted the Grilled Chicken Pesto Sandwich. I compromised. I was given a bread sandwich instead (see photo). 5 freaking locations in New York and they got this other pygmy thing over in Jersey. Don’t waste your time or money here.'

We were only there for 15-20 mins maximum and ordered 2 rounds. She straight up handed us the check when we were not done and we were not even planning on being done! They just lost business. Very unprofessional.\nThere were other couples there who were only drinking and they didn’t bother them!? Why the bad treatment selectively?'

Mollie Crom, 4 months ago, 1, "This place was truly terrible. My party had a reservation for brunch. We were seated and a server took our drink orders. He served them to us and that was the last time we ever interacted with that server. He went behind he bar and despite the fact that many of us tried to get his attention to order, making full eye contact with him, he never came back to help us order food. I think he may have even been the bartender? We had to flag down a server to get every single thing else we needed: our food order, boxes, our bills, literally everything. I honestly don't think we even had an actual server assigned to our table. Maybe they do tip share or something? On top of everything else, the food was mediocre and way too expensive for what it was. The drinks were good but that was the absolutely only decent part about this place. We'll never go back."
Samantha Stratton, 4 months ago, 5, 'I threw my sister a surprise graduation brunch here and I was super satisfied with everything!!! To start Haylee the event coordinator was awesome! She accommodated 11 girls for brunch and put us in a good spot where we were kinda separate from the normal brunchers and right near a perfect photo taking spot that all my sisters friends loved! We did bottomless mimosas and they were very quick to bring over multiple pitcher fulls as soon as we would finish one, which everyone loves and what makes a good bottomless brunch!! The food was also very good!!!!! The lighting and music were perfect, not to much but just enough to be able to talk at the table!! Id definitely recommend coming here for brunch!! Especially if you have people coming from out of town!! And if you have a special occasion or large group reach out to Haylee!!'

Ana Duarte, 5 months ago, 3, 'Nice environment (decoration and music) but poor quality of food. Service was ok but nothing special. The calamaris were terrible. The Cobb salad was just ok; the avocado was not fresh, the lettuce was just stems and the chicken breast was dry.

Pao Bonilla, 5 months ago, 2, 'Don’t check the menu on the website. It is pointless since it is not updated.

Not exclusive for vegetarians since they can’t accommodate other options. The veggie burger, pizza and chicken burger were dry. They also said they can’t substitute because the kitchen is “busy” when the place was empty. Don’t recommend.'

Cocktail (summer mule) was in a mule glass that could fit inside a typical moscow mule mug and 3/4 ice. Pathetic tbh. Asked for medium rare burger. Came well done and cost $17. Definitely not 1/2lb of meat and came with maybe 12 fries total?\nServer was inattentive to us yet had plenty of time for his boys at a nearby table that walked in. No silverware or napkins at the table. No checkup. No 2nd round of drinks. And $4 for a soft drink? Come on now. Covid sucks for everyone not just your business.
