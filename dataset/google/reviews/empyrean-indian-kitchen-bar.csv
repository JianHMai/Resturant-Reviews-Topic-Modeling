Tom P, 4 days ago, 1, 'Ordered food 2:30 hours ago and still isn‚Äôt ready.  Not even sure why they‚Äôd take orders if they can‚Äôt fill them.  Never ordering or going there again.\n\nAlso tried calling after an hour and they said they were preparing the food.  Tried calling back and they‚Äôd answer then not say anything while keeping the phone online to be busy.\n\nMy biggest issue is that they weren‚Äôt honest when they picked up the phone as we would‚Äôve made other plans if we knew it‚Äôd end up being 3 hours.'
Atharv Gosavi, 4 days ago, 1, 'The service sucks a lot. For one beer to serve they took 1 hr. We had placed the order at 8:50pm and the waitress came to ask at 9:45pm  for our order, however we had placed the order long back. Never order paneer chili as it‚Äôs not paneer it‚Äôs just rubber. When we asked about why everything is so late the manager and the waitress started giving us rude looks. So far it is the worst service I have ever had in any Indian Cuisine restaurant in entire US. I‚Äôm sitting in restaurant and still waiting for rest of my order and it‚Äôs 10:30pm.'
EZ NZ, 4 days ago, 1, '2.5hrs and food not even ready for delivery driver to pick up. Order at your own risk.'
Mo Sekhon, 4 days ago, 1, "Awful experience. Ordered over two hours ago and they still have not got the food ready to be delivered. It is fine to be busy but to not update the wait time online is wrong. I looked on UberEATS again to see if this has since been changed but no it has not, it still states 45mins. You can't call either as they have clearly disengaged their line to show as busy. Terrible service."

I also tried paneer pakodas which I'd say were average.\n\nI'd say the management at the place could be better, I appreciate being asked about my experience but not 7 times in 2 hours. Also I was asked about what I wanted to order 3 times within 5 minutes of sitting down by different servers.\nIt's not a deal breaker, but just a genuine good hearted feedback. Would definitely be going back here!"

Amey Phatak, a month ago, 5, 'A late night dinner hunt and then you arrive at the right place to satisfy your hunger. This Indian kitchen is delicious with fine cocktails. I always have a habit of ordering the cocktail with the weirdest name and this time it was ‚ÄúThe Gujju Misunderstood Smash‚Äù. If you‚Äôre a whiskey lover then this one is the drink for you with a hint of ginger, fresh mint and cucumber. My friend ordered ‚ÄúSomrus mango martini‚Äù. A drink with its own taste, not a fan but it was okay! Coming to appetizers, ordered delicious steamed veg momos. Try this for sure if you‚Äôre visiting this kitchen. For the main course ordered Tandoori roti and Paneer Kaju Makhani. Tried this combination for the first time and it was tasty. If you‚Äôll order medium it will be a bit sweeter however, you can go for the spicy one. The rice is provided on the side with curry!\n\nThe ambience is perfect. Service was excellent and friendly. They make sure you get what you like and keeps on checking with you in case you‚Äôve issues with the food or need anything else. Thank you for the hospitality. Kudos to the cooks for serving the delicious food!'

Vivek Trivedi, a month ago, 4, 'My rating: 4.2 / 5\n\nGood food and few unique items on the menu which are not very common in the menu of Indian restaurants around here.\n\n1) Bhindi masala: 5/5 Great sabzi, very authentic recipe.\n2) Empyrean chicken curry: 3/5 Nothing special even though it is supposed to be special because it‚Äôs cooked in wine and has mushrooms. :/ The biggest complaint I had was the quality of chicken in this which was dry (perhaps overcooked) and bland.\n3) Fried paneer momos: 5/5 Crunchy and tasty momos. They forgot to give us sauce for it so I had to make my own special momos sauce at home which was not an issue.\n4) Garlic naan: 4/5 Good old garlic naan.\n5) Lachcha paratha: 4/5 Good but nothing extraordinary.'

Sourabh Ajmera, 2 months ago, 5, "It's a newly opened restaurant in Jersey City.\n\nFood:\nThe best Indian food in jersey city area. All other restaurants are don't even come close when it's about food (taste and quality). This restaurant is definitely at the level of one of the top Indian restaurant you could find in NYC. I like all their dishes in the list but do order momos, my favorite appetizer.\n\nDrinks:\nRestaurant is still experimenting with drinks so it's hit and miss sometimes. They haven't nailed down their cocktails list. So if you are particular about your drink, I would say stick to beer and wine.\n\nAmbience:\nI would say the ambience is pretty good inside and outside. This not being an expensive restaurant it's still gives you a vibe of being in a nice cozy place to have a dinner with your SO or friends and family.\n\nCommute/Parking:\nRestaurant is located right outside Hoboken path which it a very easy commute for locals but the restaurant doesn't provide parking. So if you would like to drive here you would have to look for street parking and I mean really look for it over the weekends as the area is always packed.\n\nCheers!"

It was definitely one of the best chicken momo I had outside of new york but veg momo wasn‚Äôt the best. I heard paneer momo was also little dry.\nTheir service was the best though. I ordered chicken curry and it ended up being little spicy and the waitress who was serving me took it back and asked them to make it less spicy and brought it back fresh for me.\n+5 star for their service but had to give 4 for the momos.'
Gayatri Somwanshi, 2 months ago, 1, 'I don‚Äôt understand where should I start. About the service.. they‚Äôll make you wait for almost everything from refilling water to take orders. We had to wait for everything and the wait isn‚Äôt worth while. There was too much kasoori methi in both the curries that we ordered and we had to remind the server for our food. And when we asked for a special request in a soup as my friend is allergic to pepper and tomato, the server didn‚Äôt understand it I guess and rudely asked us to order something else. Even we had to wait and ask 2-3 times for the drinks that we had ordered. The only better part were momos. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest this restaurant to anyone that I know.'

If you're planning to sit outside under the temporary structure, it's probably not worth it. Overall 3.5 stars."

Ujjval Thakkar, 4 months ago, 4, "I went in here with my wife expecting to have good Indo-Chinese food. We ordered Fried Veg Momo, Veg Chow Mein and Sweet Lassi. After tasting it, we felt this place was like a fusion of different cuisines. Like it was not the authentic indo-chinese taste. At first, we didn't like it, but with time, I started liking it.\n\n1. Fried Veg Momo - Were good, the sauce was not. We mentioned something was off about the sauce to the waitress and she did go ahead and check it for us with the chef. They did find something off there. It was great of them to acknowledge it.\n2. Veg Chow Mein - Was good, was different, not authentic indo-chinese. Grows on you.\nNote to restaurant: If you are reading this, please, no broccoli and cauliflower in the veg chow mein, a big NO.\n3. Sweet Lassi - Was good, not cold though.\n\nThe waitress was super courteous, did check upon us regularly and was open to constructive feedback. She did mention they were new and are looking to improve."
Suraj Fale, 4 months ago, 1, 'We read so many good reviews about this place and visited here last sunday. Read so much about their Momos so ordered steamed and fried momos. We found fried momos were all stale and very bad in taste so we thought may be steamed momos will be good. It was all same and everything was so sour and stale. Still we thoughts lets order Main course it might be better but we were already so disappointed with our Momos. We ordered Biryani and 2 curries. Biryani was fine and again curries we found so sour. So much disappointment with the food. Service was worst. There were only 2 tables occupied that day still no one was responding to us. We asked change of plates after bad momos experience. They didnt change the plates. Almost for half of the time, we were eating in dark as we misunderstood it as the theme of the restaurant but they switched on the lights after restaurant was full. Overall very much disappointed for such a pricy food.  Never going to forget this experience. 1 star i added for their cocktails'

We also got the vegetable biryani, which was good in my opinion;\nOverall, the food and service was great. Prices are definitely not on the higher end ($15+) for a curry. Rice is also included with the curries.
