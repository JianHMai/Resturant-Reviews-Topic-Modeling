Ryan Zucker, a month ago, 5, 'Great spot. Tacos are huge burrito was delicious'
Victoria Trasente, a month ago, 1, 'This is the least authentic, most disgusting ‚Äúmexican‚Äù food I‚Äôve ever had. The salsa, tortillas, and rice all tasted store bought. Nothing was seasoned, nothing was fresh. For example the beef taco tasted like a slim Jim. I couldn‚Äôt force myself to have more than one bite.\n\nWould not recommend.'

Rosanna Terrero, 7 months ago, 4, 'If your looking for good Mexican food you should order The food is very good and they have fast delivery. I recommend to go because it‚Äôs not a place where you can sit comfortably it‚Äôs not very big. Overall they have good food and fast service.'
Jelly p, 7 months ago, 1, "You ever ate something that put you in a bad mood?\nWell if thats what you're looking for come here.\n\nThis was bland and cold.. how? I picked it up almost as soon as I ordered it..\nI ordered a steak burrito and was served a rice and bean burrito with rice and beans on the side."
April Lancona, 7 months ago, 5, 'The best quesadilla in Hoboken!! I swear I crave their quesadilla every week, need to get it at least once a week! Also their homemade salsa has the perfect amount of spice, I order extra to dip tortillas into throughout the week. I love you Hoboken burrito'
Mr. C, 8 months ago, 1, "I will never order from this place again. They are way overpriced and they don't even give you a lot of food. I ordered the grilled steak taco meal and they only give you two tacos. That is unheard of any restaurant you go to where you order a meal of tacos you always get three. I felt so ripped off I will never order from this place again that's what happens when you have Chinese people making Mexican food"

Kyle Gheewala, a year ago, 1, 'This place has the worst mexican food I have ever had. DO NOT GO HERE. There is nothing special about the food. I ordered a grilled chicken burrito and when i picked it up to eat, the entire wrap fell apart and the insides spilled out. When i asked the manager for a refund he had horrible customer service and decided to pick a fight over $9. I will never go back to this place because of their service and bad quality.'

Giorgio Rosi, 2 years ago, 5, 'The food is really good. This is one of the only places in the area that the chicken on the chicken nachos is actually made on a slow cooker so they put pin strips of soft slow cooked chicken instead of your traditional just cubes of solid chicken. The burritos are really good too.'

Briana Diaz, 3 years ago, 5, 'If i had to choose between qdoba, chipotle, taco bell and hoboken burrito, i would most definitely choose hoboken burrito . I have never tasted such great mexican food in my life. My friends, family and myself have been coming here for years now and its nothing but tasty, fresh, amazing food . I totally recommend this place if you are craving some mexican food üíØüíØüíØoralewayyyyyyy'

Kelly Greene, 3 years ago, 1, "Several of my friends warned me about this place because of food poisoning, but I was nearby and craving Mexican. HUGE mistake. I counted at least 4 cockroaches scurrying around the stools, and 1 crawling up the counter. Obviously I left as soon as I saw this. The health department needs to shut this place down.\n\nEdit: The owner response was all you needed to see. The audacity and disrespectfulness of calling out a patron and implying they're lying because, in their minds, anything that isn't favorable toward them must be fabricated. Also, I have no idea why they assumed that the day they saw my review was the day I went there. They think every review is a witchhunt for them and not a platform to give honest feedback for other consumers. Absolutely pathetic."
Fam Vids, 3 years ago, 1, "I've gotten food from here TWICE and both times I've gotten food poisoning from here. It was awful, and the staff is even worse. They are extremely rude and unprofessional."
Lorelei Morrow, 3 years ago, 4, "Ordered this food with my boyfriend - wanted Mexican food but didn't want to make it.  The food was delivered promptly, and made well.  It's a mix between Mexican Mexican food and Americanized Mexican food - and the burrito was (not kidding) 5 pounds at least. Best Mexican around? No. But definitely works! ;)"
Andy, 3 years ago, 1, 'This is a terrible place. Both my wife and I got HORIFFIC food poisoning from this place. Never would I tell anyone to eat here. We were violently ill for 2 days because of the food.'

Paul Lichstein, 6 years ago, 4, 'A little over priced.  Originally this place was very Cal-mex however over the last 5 or 6 it has become more generic Mexican.  Chicken mole is very good.  Portions are better than fresca tortilla and the taco truck. . They do have Mexican coke and jarritos (Mexican sodas made by coke in Mexico) .  This place does not really shine on anything but nothing they do is bad.  On a pretty day you should walk to Jersey City Heights for genuine oxxacan food.  When you are feeling lazy order from here.'
The Corcoran Group, 9 years ago, 4, "Don't let the exterior fool you, this place has some of the best Mexican food in town, especially paired with one of their eclectic soft drink choices. We always go for the vegetarian Mission Burrito"
Nick Walker, 10 years ago, 3, "Food is usually pretty good by delivery, although expensive. They do have Mexican Coke as well. I just wish when I order Guacamole they would send me something that wasn't a container full of diced tomatoes with a little avocado in it. Avocado is supposed to be the primary ingredient in guacamole!"
Matthew Hartsough, 10 years ago, 3, 'Food is good enough. Too expensive to go back though.'
Eduardo Silva, 10 years ago, 5, 'No luxury,  great food.'
