Rahul Baid, 3 hours ago, 4, 'Good food!'
Ivo Pletikosić, a week ago, 4, "Loved their General Tso's chicken, beef curry, red curry soup. Wasn't impressed with other chicken dishes, seems like they cook vegetables and chicken separately and mix them for you before serving so they all taste the same."

Andrew G, 2 months ago, 4, "This is a mainstay for us, but it's only because we know the (crazily large and redundant) menu. GOOD: roti canai, veggie spring rolls, General's chicken, most basic noodle dishes (Mei Fun Country Style, Singaporian mei fun), some of their soups. BAD: pad thai, Indian Mee Goreng, mango noodle (really stay away from these three!), desserts, and some of the standard Chinese dishes are really bland. The Malaysian menu overall is not bad and worth a shot."

Mony Kiem, 3 months ago, 2, 'You’d have to pay me to eat here again.\n\nThe pad thai is probably the worst I’ve ever had. It was bland and flavorless. It had the same flavor as white rice, which is to say none. I kept taking bite after bite hoping that some flavor to surface, but my efforts were in vain.\n\nI also had the beef Chen’s mai dish which was also bland. Not as bland as the pad Thai but almost the same. I requested it to be spicy and there was none. At least the beef was tender.\n\nThe irony of it all? The white rice (hainanese) which was included as part of the beef dish was the star of the show. It was perfectly cooked with perfect grains. If not for this rice, I’d probably give this place a 1.'

Peter Yong (PedroJoven), 3 months ago, 4, 'Authentic taste of Malaysian food. Beef rendang was tender, had good curry and not too spicy, lobak was decent, hainanese chicken was well done, kangkung belacan has real shrimp paste, chili sauce chicken rice was better than Nyonya in  NYC, roti canai and satay was on the dot. As a Malaysian, I am definitely coming back!'

Shareen Fatima, 5 months ago, 3, 'It’s a fairly nice place to enjoy Malay/Thai food. I especially loved their lichi drink. It was quite refreshing. Their veg green curry was $17 and it felt a bit pricy since their meat options were for the same price if not low.\nGiving them a 3.5 star rating because we were a group of 3 and our server billed the gratuity in advance on our check, would have made sense if we were larger group but she shouldn’t have charged it upfront.'
Cecilia Chung, 5 months ago, 5, "Affordable lunch deals ($8.95) and 10%off if you pay with cash. Deal includes soup, with 3 options to choose from. We tried the egg drop and the curry and they were tasty. Curry one is slightly spicy. For mains we got malaysian fried noodle and curry fried rice. Noodles were excellent and with 5 shrimps. Fried rice also delicious and fresh, comes with chicken. Mild but I'd say slightly spicy.\nThey also have drinks and appetizers I want to try next!"

Karen N, a year ago, 5, 'Ridiculously good place for Malaysian cuisine if you’re in the area. The roti is delicious, although the curry is slightly more watery than what I’ve had in Malaysia - it still tastes pretty good for what might be a more American spin to the dish. Loved the char kway teow dish - it’s one of the most popular in Malaysia and the shrimp was perfect, not salty at all. Would definitely come back!'

Praveena Prasad, a year ago, 3, 'À one-time go restaurant for Malaysian cuisine in Hoboken. They had both outdoor and indoor seating(can see open kitchen indoors), the place was more focussed on takeout&delivery orders. The food was okay-ish, ordered Sambal beef with white rice, Mango noodles, Spicy flat noodles and Nasi Goreng Fried rice. The fried rice was too salty and we had to send it back, they got it remade, the beef could have used for flavor, the noodle dishes were alright. The best thing was the Lychee flavored green bubble tea. We were a group of just 4, a gratuity of 15% was already included in the bill(without tips).'

Benjamin Atwater, a year ago, 1, 'I placed an order online, and received order confirmation that the food was coming within 15 minutes. So I trekked out in the rain to make the pickup time. When I asked about my order the staff could not find it then picked up an order sheet under other papers putting it in as I mentioned, saying it will be another 25 minutes. With no apologies for the delay or offer for a discount, as well as her not clarifying at all about why there was an additional 20 minutes, giving this place one star for a complete lack of customer service. I get there are delays but a simple sorry goes a long way instead of treating me like I’m a nuisance asking for my paid order. To top it off an employee was eating inside with no mask, before the NJ laws allow for this so if simple COVID Polciy can’t be followed makes wonder what Other sanitary policies are not being followed there ... UPDATE: I was hoping the service would not match the food...was I wrong. Incredibly low quality beef in a tasteless sauce. DO NOT EAT HERE'
Golden Sunshine, a year ago, 5, "Authentic! Surprising in Hoboken!\nIf you are looking for super trendy  with 5 star service go somewhere else.\nIf you are looking for authentic food and friendly service go here!\nIf you gave this less than 5 stars you don't know Malaysian food!\nYou are not a foodie.\nI have not been in a while i have been sick.

But they have straws so that's good.\n\nTry their lo mein, or egg noodles. Definitely try their appetizers as they are pretty nice.\n\nOverall good food.\n\nOne thing I really didnt like is they force u to pay 15-18% gratuity even for small group of 2 or 3. I prefer to tip based on experience and I anyways don't like the tipping culture. 15 to 18% is too high to pay to some1 for just picking bowl of food from a counter 3 feet away to your table. I wish they make it optional.\n\nCarry cash for possibility of a discount."

The appetizer is a bit small, but it’s full of flavor and delicious. The entree has a big portion! The food is seasoned very good. The curry noodle soup tasted delicious. And their bbq pork with rice is good, too! I personally recommend try their fried fish with rice. It comes with bell peppers and cashew nuts, super delicious! Their sauce is very different, sweet and sour that goes with the fish and bell peppers. I recommend you to come here and try out their food if you ever stop by Hoboken, NJ.'
