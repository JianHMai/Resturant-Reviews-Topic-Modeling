Diana Jin, a year ago, 3, "Honestly, it's very average food at best. In a city that has 100 options for pizza and other Italian fares, it's a wonder how this place is still in business! Pizza is very doughy in an almost undercooked way, but concurrently, the crust is pretty burnt in areas, making it inedible (unless you enjoy ingesting ash and charcoal). The plastic cutlery and tiny paper plates provided during the meal made this seem more like a Chuck-e-cheese pizza party than a legit restaurant. Won't be returning."

He completely under ordered food for our party and had no one there to manage our party.  In fact, when our party arrived and they knew that there wasn't enough food - they did nothing expect demand we pay for service that wasn't provided.  How do you run out of salad and pizza when your a pizza place?!  They clearly couldn't handle our party, or any party, in my opinion. Even worse was the food; what little made was inedible  - the pasta with roasted tomatoes was not freshly prepared and instead tasted like Ragu from a store bought sauce.  We were so disappointed with how Dozzino handled our party, including the lack of service, management, and food.  Many guests left early because there was no food and it was such an embarrassment.  Living in Hoboken as a local for many years, it is shocking to me how such a place still can be in business. Turns out Dozzino has problems with running out of food and poorly managed parties in the past - wish we knew that before we made the mistake of trusting them with our own party.
