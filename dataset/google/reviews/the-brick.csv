Tonight at 11pm I was happy to know they were still open because I needed a good meal aside from fast food. I ordered the ‚Äúfire salmon‚Äù instead which came with cauliflower,\nCarrots, asparagus, and mashed potato. IT WAS AMAZING!! Better than some fine dining places I‚Äôve been to. I didn‚Äôt not expect such a perfect meal at that time of night. Compliments to the chef! That meal was well thought out; salmon cooked perfectly, the sauce they cooked the veggies in was super flavorful and delicious , and the veggies were still crispy and had texture. I would give more stars I would!'

The vegan mozzarella sticks were huge and so worth it. The garlic knots were delicious. The tomato sauce had a great flavor. The vegan Greek salad was very refreshing and had delicious dressing (can‚Äôt wait to try their other salads). We ended up ordering large half vegan buffalo chicken and half can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs vegan pizza. To be honest the apps were where the excitement was. The pizza crust / flavors could have been a little more balanced, but the apps make up for it!! There is an entire vegan menu and we can't wait to come back and try more entrees. The restaurant is located on a beautiful street great for date nights. Free parking on Sunday. They have a variety of gluten free options as well.

Kaitlynn Rose, a year ago, 2, 'I would have loved to try the food on the menus as you guys have great reviews and vegan options! However, your customer service skills need work. I spoke to two people who seemed nice but it was very obvious there were language barrier issues which is also fine and resolvable. After telling the first person my name three times, I finally spelled it. Then after giving the address, I was asked to hold (at this point I was a little skeptical and nervous and was thinking to call another pizzeria)  then a completely different person came on the line and was unable to enter my visa expiration date correctly? (His words not mine) Normally I would think it would be common sense to get a third person on the phone who can not only assist him with the card processing but also help me the customer who is looking to order and provide business. I kindly gave up and said ‚Äúnever mind, I‚Äôll just order somewhere else üôÅ‚Äù and he just said ‚Äúok.‚Äù No further trying to assist me or get help from another person...disappointing. I support local businesses but not with that poor customer service. This review is simply constructive criticism and I\nhope in the future it will help you to be a better business.'

None of their pizzas look like their advertised photos, and I would wager McDonalds‚Äô pictures look closer to the real thing than this place‚Äôs pizza.  The white pizza has no substance to it, and it tastes more like grease than pizza.  I wouldn‚Äôt order this again if it was the last thing on the planet.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Literally anywhere else.'

Until i saw this heaven send location now with that being said it was a sad ending and i have never been soo disapponited in my life. Just to start off the pizza was cold and my sandwich was not spicy at all, i shared a pie with three other people ( me vegan them not ) and we all had the same reaction. 22 dollars for one of the most tasteless  piece of thin bread in the history of thin pizza and lets not talk about their sandwich, the chef himself told me all the stuff he added on it, honestly, i was a little scared on how spicy it was going to be. Now put your finger in your mouth thats how spicy it was, it was also beyond greasy and the pepper were just burn that it didn't taste like anything but grease.\n\nAm sorry to say it but if they thought that was decent pizza please close this place down or something.\n\n** Worse 40 dollars i have ever spent**"

Ruze Richards, 5 years ago, 1, "I didn't have a good experience. The staff waiter refused to take my Groupon saying because it for 4 people, the 3 of us couldn't eat there. This has never happened at any other restaurant!  We had to go to another restaurant and I refuse to ever go there again.  At least Groupon gave me my money back!  I will let everybody know I ever meet not to eat there."
