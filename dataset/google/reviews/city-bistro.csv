Reyes Laluz, 2 weeks ago, 3, 'Roof Top was terrible, the food on the other hand was great. The Roof Top seating is uncomfortable and loud, better off in the restaurant. The bar is also not close so the server has to go far to get your drinks. The server was not attentive and the process took longer than usual.'

Shannon Owens, a month ago, 1, 'I was extremely disappointed with the service. Had reservation on roof top and had to clean our own table before sitting down. There was a waitress behind the bar eating a whole meal who seemly had an attitude after we refused to move to a tighter section. I had a peach tea drink that tasted watered down and an over cooked burger with a bun that was hard as a rock. To make our experience worse the couple next to us spotted a rodent and had to move somewhere else, making us very paranoid. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I drove over 4 hours to meet my friends at this place to have such an awful experience.'

Gabby Aviles, 3 months ago, 1, 'No idea how the food tastes because the waitress ‚Äúforgot to put my order through‚Äù and by the time they finally realized the kitchen was already closed. All my friends got their food except me. The waitress who made the mistake did not face me to apologize but chose to send a coworker instead who very politely tried to get at least a salad but was told no because again the kitchen was closed already she then offered to ‚Äúget me something from the pizza place next door‚Äù, as to which I said no because again, she did not make the mistake. I understood. Anyone can make a mistake fine. My friends and boyfriend felt very bad so they decided to take her up on the offer and get at least some pizza from the place next door. He informed the waitress whom said it was fine and we proceeded to get the food. On our way back in the person who checks ids refused to let us in bc no outside food was allowed. We tried to explain what happened but, very rudely, he cut us off saying no, I asked him to please go ask the waitress and he responded with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what she told you, I said no‚Äù so my boyfriend proceeded to getting the waitress so she could explain and even tho she tried, the Man still refused to listen to her. Poor girl had to go get, whom I can guess, was the manager so he could finally get through this hard headed employee.\nIn the end they gave us 50% off and a very bad experience.'

Eric Hammer, 9 months ago, 4, 'First off, City Bistro is (in normal times) a great drinking spot. The rooftop is always a great time especially in warm weather (although I must admit the TV management could be improved by making sure the best games are playing, but that‚Äôs a personal issue that I can get over). Id argue it‚Äôs the best happy hour spot in the city.\n\nI‚Äôve been here to eat twice now, first time for dinner on a whim and most recently brunch. I‚Äôve been pleasantly surprised both times.\n\nBrunch with a friend this weekend was excellent. He ordered the French toast which was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside thanks to the cornflakes.\n\nI opted for the burger and it was excellent. I like a classic burger and that‚Äôs exactly what this was. Brioche bun, shredded lettuce, red onion, juicy tomato, melted cheese, and a pickle spear as the proverbial cherry on top. Sweet potato fries were above average too.\n\nWe also put down a few mimosas a piece because, well, brunch.\n\nI can confidently say that City Bistro has one of the better burgers in Hoboken.'
Mabel Avalos, 9 months ago, 2, 'This place is a decent spot to get a quick bite to eat, if you have to. Or to have a brunch with someone you don‚Äôt like. But the food and options are very bland. The places looks nice inside but decor is the most interesting thing it has going for itself. The staff members are okay. But a big concern is how little it is inside.
