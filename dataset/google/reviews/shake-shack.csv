A little research goes a long way. Other than that its a great addition to Hoboken. Love the environment and the kindness of the workers greeting you. I've done some research and they actually have a great record on community events. I'm sure once they have settled down they will do some community events in the future."

Shake Shack burgers are fried patties that can only be made well done like most fast food. Everyone was courteous and friendly, even bringing our food out to us (another thing that usually does NOT happen at NYC Shake Shacks).\n\nLastly, it has a great outdoor seating area with TV's. I think the food here is good and the prices are affordable and fair. Overall great experience and addition to Hoboken."

Their delicious burgers to my favorite, shroom burger that‚Äôs deep fried with cheese inside, and lastly the classic shake!\n\nHoboken location opened in late March and it‚Äôs nice and clean. You can either order in your app and choose your pick up time, or order at the kiosk at the restaurant.\n\nThe backside of the restaurant had seating that was clean. They also had large TVs which surprised me actually (I wouldn‚Äôt personally stay to watch anything there, but there is that option I suppose).\n\nEven on day 1, it was super efficient!'

G. Lee, 7 months ago, 4, 'The place itself is good. I mean we all love their burgers right? Since it is just opened... it‚Äôs very busy with people waiting outside and inside.\nI highly suggest to not to order things via the app. Just go to the place to order. I waited 1 hours to get my burger because the app was with some errors (or they messed up... I am unsure).\nLater on the assistant manager took care of my order and learned that if I order in persons at the shop I can get the food in 6-10 min.'
