Gliden Rivera, 2 months ago, 5, 'This is the first time I have viven anyone 5 stars.  From the moment I  walked in I  felt comfortable.  The place is small and cozy.   The people there make you feel at home.  The service is good and fast and the food is great.  I was at home relaxing having lunch.  I am planning a motorcycle ride with my crew to go and have lunch soon.  I recomended this place to one and all.  You will love it.  I did.  And as for the owner he make a trip to your table to chant and make sure everything is ok.  A true 5 star lunch spot. üëçü§ó'
Michael Singer, 3 months ago, 5, "By far the best cheesesteak around and one of the best you'll probably ever eat. Not a traditional cheesesteak though. It's a steak that's thin - but not paper thin like most others - about two quarters thickness but still tender and juicy. Bread is also great and from Dom's Bakery up the block. Hidden gem."
