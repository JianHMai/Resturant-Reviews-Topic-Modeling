They even played the birthday song while we cut the cake (which was really nice). Everything we ordered was so refreshing from the Tabouleh salad to the falafel platter and the Sahara chicken.

I'm sure it's cooked in butter or drippings.\nThe only thing I wish is that they would add more veggies to the plates rather than just one pepper and quarter of a tomato-- but this seems to be pretty typical for most  middle eastern cuisine."

Aki, 7 months ago, 4, "(Translated by Google) To accompany playing in the park along the river. It was a weekday, but the road in front of me wasn't very open, so it's recommended to stop at the road on the river side. I ordered pita and beef kebab with something like vegetable croquette, which is a specialty of the shop. I was full with plenty of vegetables. The seasoning was just right and both were delicious. I regret that I should have taken on the challenge with handmade sweets lined up in the glass showcase inside the store.\n\n(Original)\n川沿いの公園遊びのお供に。平日でしたが目の前の路駐はなかなか空いておらず川側に入った道に停めるのがオススメ。お店の名物という野菜コロッケみたいのが入ったピタとビーフケバブを注文。野菜たっぷりずっしり重たく満腹になりました。味付けがちょうど良くどちらも美味しかったです。店内ガラスショーケースには手作りの甘そうなお菓子が並んでいてチャレンジすれば良かったと後悔。"

It is just mind-blowing how good the meat, vegetables and the overall dishes were. Let me finish this review saying that the mint lemonade was the best I had in my life, not too sweet, not too sour. Just very well balanced. If you're in the area and hungry, you have to come to this place."
Licia McClary, a year ago, 5, "Hands down the best Middle Eastern restaurant in all of Hudson or Bergen counties.  We ordered delivery for the first time last week, during normal times we would usually just drop in or pick up.  They have been here since the 80's and that is because they make wonderful food and have really nice people working here.  We live exactly 2 miles from them and when I asked if they would deliver the owner said absolutely!  I prefer to order direct when I want a delivery versus any of those delivery places.  The food came hot and quick! We ordered a lot of food, enough for 4 or 5 and we are only 2 but we wanted leftovers and we are really happy we did.  Everything was cooked perfectly, juicy chicken, awesome beef gyro, lamb kabobs were tender and full of flavor and lamb chops, my hunny's favorite.  He said they were to die for!  He didn't share them with me but he already said we need to order again soon and I want those lamb chops!  The 40 Theives dinner for 2 people is the perfect way to have a taste across the board of what they have.  You get beef gyro, chicken kabob, kufta, lamb kabob, homemade hummus and baba gannoush, seasonsed rice  and a white garlic sauce very similar to a tzatziki just milder.  Their meats were terrific and the baba gannoush was nice and smokey while the hummus was simply spot on!  Have to order a side order of that next time to have more :)  Also ordered Lamb chops, as I said before my hunny LOVED THEM.  He has brought them up several times the last few days.  Even though we had chicken in the 40 thieves, we also ordered chicken tandoori this was really tender and nicely seasoned.  Not spicy at all, but I asked the gentleman on the phone which was his favorite chicken dish and he said this so we tried it,.  Really very good, next we will go for the spicy and try Chicken tika.  We tried grape leaves, spheeha and spinach pie app's.  All very tasty and good.   Overall, a terrifc meal, just as good being delivered, packed well and arrived hot.  Cannot wait to go there and sit down and just have them bring us platters of food!  If you want something different for take out this is the place.  Love to support the local businesses and hey after 35+ years they definitely know what they are doing."

FATMA EROGLU, 2 years ago, 1, "I have a lot to say about this restaurant but in short just don't go there.\n\nFirst of all, it is not a Turkish restaurant. It is Arabic kitchen! Secondly, food is terrible. Do NOT trust the images. They’re totally fake! It is awful. I ordered one of the dishes and got only bite and returned it and i paid $30 for it.\n\nStill everything is fine. I mean, food can be terrible but the staff is worse than the food too!\nWaitress tried charged me %18 tip for such an awful food. I went to Ali Baba for four people and paid $153 with the highest tip without asking me. I told them the tip is too much. Then I paid without the tip. So, for few days I found out that Alibaba charged me twice! First for $153 and $139. I called them for such a terrible mistake and they told me that they can not cancel the transaction which I am sure that all restaurants are able to do that. So, i called my bank to cancel transaction. After waiting to hear from the bank, Alibaba called me for their mistake and they told me that I should come to the restaurant. I went there and they told me that they can transfer the money to my credit card. Now, I find out that they charged me again for $149.\n\nI just wanted to have a good time in that restaurant and I’ve been regretting for weeks.\nPLEASE DON’T GO THERE!"

Dhatrish Rajdev, 2 years ago, 5, "Trying to think of what's NOT good there and nothing comes to mind. If you like smokey, charry flavors, you get a ton of it and you don't have to order meat for it - try  their Babaganoush. On the other hand, chicken tandoor sandwich, lamb chops, kebabs are all exquisite and so is their flavorful and aromatic basmati rice."

The food was a reflection of this type of behavior. We ordered 2 40theives which was more than delicious and was more than enough for all of us. Matta fact i had that for lunch today. And i don't even write google reviews. Ali Baba in Hoboken gives you that authentic middleastern feel that would only rival the mideastern resturants of Paterson.

A friend and I went for dinner and we decided to share the 40 Thieves Mix Grill (combination of grilled chicken, lamb kabob, beef gyro & kufta kabob,  served with garlic lemon sauce, rice, hummus & baba ganoush). This was a lot of food (on top of the complimentary pita and hummus they serve you once you sit down). The menu said that it was good for two people but we definitely had enough to serve a third person. My favorite was the lamb and the beef, especially with the yogurt sauce (?) they give you. The chicken was okay - it wasn't dry but it was just too charred for my taste. The rice came with almonds (you can opt out of it) which I thought would be weird at first, but it actually ended up adding a nice texture to it.\n\nTip - it's BYOB. I think this means water too because when we asked for a glass of water, they brought out some Poland Spring and then charged us for it. A little sneaky but not enough to keep me from coming back. Overall, I really enjoyed the meal."

Tracey Louis, 3 years ago, 5, 'I’ve taken a picture of what’s leftover of my tandoori chicken sandwich. It was so good that I couldn’t stop to snap a picture before it was gone. Ibrahim the owner was incredibly friendly and welcoming. The hummus appetizer was great. My mom has the chicken soup and spinach pie and enjoyed it. My sister and niece had the falafel sandwich and both enjoyed. Be careful with the hot sauce.'
Mardie Jane, 3 years ago, 5, "Oh my goodness. Yum yum and yum! We and our friends took a couple of bottles of wine we picked up just down the street in with us.\nWe got the meal for two to share. It was a lot of food and a little of everything I. Waitress brought extra pita and tzatizki sauce (which.if you've read my reviews of Mediterranean places I'm finiky about. It was right on)   Everything was perfect. If you ask the owner makes his own hot sauce right there. If you like heat at all you have to try it!\nBeautiful family owned, it will be remodeled soon with open air eating etc but don't wait. It was fantastic. Authentic Turkish/Palastinian fare. Honey cake with semolina, tahini yogurt. And if we had not been completely stuffed they had fried HALLOUMI as an appetizer!\nWill definitely return if ever in Jersey again. Maybe see it after the remodel.\nBelow is the bakliva and the honey cake. The Turkish coffee is authentically made with cardamom. Just an awesome evening."

The Hummus was outrageous, perfect consistency, and was not overpowered with salt. Their salads were on point and dressed properly. The Baba Ghanoush was smokey, flavorful, and delicious. Try the falafel they are delectable...a perfect bite to give you that crunch factor, and contrasting crispy texture that is always craved. Overall, an A+ experience. A must try for anyone who hasn't yet."

Steve Tarakji, 3 years ago, 5, "Coming back from the city, I had a huge craving for authentic middle eastern food on my way home. I decided to do some quick research while I was sitting in traffic with my wife (she did the research). We came across Ali Baba Restaurant. Little did we know, this place is a staple for the Hoboken area for the last 36years and best known for their Falafel.  We decided to pop in and give it a try. Man was it amazing. We were quickly greeted by the sweetest waitress Jackie and then by the owner Abe himself. We honestly felt like we were regulars from the moment we sat down. The place had such an authentic and warm middle eastern feel. From experience, these places are hard to come by and if you do, often something like the food or something doesn't quite turn out. We placed our order for Falafel, Hummus and a mixed dish that consisted of chicken and beef skewers on a bed of rice with salad and a piece of Kufta. This was the most authentic, delicious middle eastern food I'd ever tried... hands down. My wife and I ate until we were about to explode. The portions were so generous we literally had to take the rest of our food home. We ate it all the next day and tasted as if we just picked it up! Definitely worth the experience and I would honestly recommend checking it out. Places like these are rare and few. Take advantage while they are still around. I know I will!"
Q M, 3 years ago, 5, 'Absolutely delicious food! Theres nothing I wouldnt recommend, but personally love the fresh fried falafel with the hummus, and the shawarma sandwiches. The rice dishes are fantastic too, as are the fattoush salad, and desserts! Def check it out!'
Shahed Baker, 3 years ago, 5, 'Hands down best middle eastern spot I’ve been too in NJ. The falafal sandwich was incredibly fresh and full of flavor. Its got the perfect amount of heat and the tahina and homous was the best I’ve tasted. This is my goto for sandwiches now. Apparently theyve been in Hoboken 36 years! One of the few Hoboken gems still remaining. Great for vegans!'

Ms. W, 3 years ago, 5, 'I was undecided for lunch and looking for something different I came here and ordered a beef gyro to go. I must say I thoroughly enjoyed this gyro. It was fresh, full, it had scallions, red bell pepper, and on top slivers of some kind of mild  pickle. What a nice touch and only $7.49 with a free beverage. I will definitely be back for that and to try their spinach pie and baklava. Also the woman who took my order was very welcoming and friendly and the decor inside is warm and decorated beautifully. Looking forward to my next meal there.'
