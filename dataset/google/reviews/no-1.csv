Fr. Vincent Fortunato, OFM Cap., 2 weeks ago, 1, 'I found my experience with this restaurant to be a very bad experience. We made a big order at $140 and two items were not in place. I called to have them deliver the two items but they said it would take an hour. So I went to pick them up and they charged me $24 more for the two items. The food was fair but not good in the spareribs there were more bones than meat. Considering I gave a 20% tip on $140 I found it strange that they would not even offer some type of discount for their forgetfulness. Will never go back to this restaurant again'

Matthew Curran, 2 years ago, 1, 'Tried to pay with credit and they kept saying it was declined. I asked if it was asking for my pin number and they said it was, but they would not let me put it in because they keep the machine behind the counter. Treated me like it was my fault and that I needed to pay another way instead of just letting me enter my pin number. Luckily my girlfriend is Chinese so they let her go behind and enter the pin which worked.'

Jeffrey Hudak, 2 years ago, 1, 'Ordered delivery and was told it would take 45-60 minutes which was perfectly acceptable. After an hour and 15 minutes and no delivery I called to just make sure my order went through and check in. The women who answered the phone was extremely rude, told me they were busy and it wasn‚Äôt ready and then just hung up on me. I will never order from this place again after such rude and terrible service. It has been almost an hour and 45 minutes and still no food..'

Frank Brennan, 3 years ago, 5, 'So this is a typical NY/NJ Chinese delivery and take out restaurant. The prices are average but the quality is superior to the others around it.  They are also quick with preparation and delivery.  We have tried the other places in the area and none are as good as this place while their prices are the same.  It really is a no brainier, If you want Chinese foods and you are in Hoboken, #1 is the place to eat.'

Melanie Tam, 3 years ago, 3, "Your typical greasy Chinese takeout spot, but I must say that it's better than most spots I've tried in Hoboken. They have a $6.50 lunch special, so I ordered chicken and broccoli with regular fried rice (sans the old leftover roast pork), which comes with a soup - so I picked the wonton. I don't order Chinese takeout too often but would definitely order from here again next time I do."

Jeffrey Zhou, 3 years ago, 1, 'I went and ordered a double cooked pork. They gave me chicken. After noticing after I got home, I went back to the restaurant to get it fixed. The cashier could not tell what type of meat it was; the chef, without looking at my dish, said it was pork. I have eaten double cook pork before and know what it should be; chicken is not it. Although the prices are very cheap, you cant ignore the fact that they cant distinguish between meats.'
