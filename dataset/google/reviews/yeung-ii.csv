inbar marcu, a year ago, 1, 'Bad food. Period.\nMade an online order and the food came not fresh, undercooked and overall not appealing.\nCalled the restaurant and they tried to negotiate me not giving a bad review by offering $10 discount and asking me to bring the food back to the restaurant.\nThe whole point of an online order was to get the food delivered....'

Kristina Chenault, a year ago, 1, "I ordered from here for the first time last night and I can say that it will be our last time. The only thing that was decent was the General Tso and even that is a stretch.\n\nWe also ordered two appetizers- the pork dumplings (soggy, greasy, and gross) and the crab rangoon (are you sure there's crab in there with that insane amount of cream cheese?). We also ordered the pad thai... It was the worst tasting pad thai I've ever had. Neither of us could stomach it.\n\nHow there are so many good reviews for this place is beyond me."
Hector Hernandez, a year ago, 5, 'Great place to stop in and get lunch. They have an outstanding assortment of lunch specials that will do everything but break the bank.  I myself went for the sesame chicken as it’s my go-to take out order and the fried rice here is absolutely delicious. Consistent in flavor and texture throughout. The chicken was fried to perfection unlike the soggy mess you sometimes get in other places and the sauce did not disappoint. It’s right next to my work and I’ll certainly come back between shifts especially because service was so kind and quick.'

Linda Petrozelli, 3 years ago, 1, 'Horrible food , nasty people, no personality to the customer.  What a shame the poison people will buy when they are hungry, it must be that medical marijuana kicking in. First of all sushi is Japanese, and I will not lie if it is can crab in cooked rice, seems hard to mes up. But their Chinese food sucks, taste like pure garbage they are robbing the good Hoboken people.'
James Petrozelli, 3 years ago, 1, 'The food is disgusting, and you can call me a racial pig ,but every time they and I SAID they make and mistake ,there is no way your getting reimbursed. The place is dirty, the chicken is all cartilage. Foul smell if you order any side dish like shrimp lomain, or shrimp fried rice,no shrimp. And these combos are not 6 0r 7 dollars anymore. This is Hoboken the big rip off for food. It has become a disgrace what they push or for food. Stand your ground, teach these rip off restaurants that Hoboken has standards, they see peoplegetting rippedoff for habitat so why not food. The worse part is when your right they arm rob you ,without a gun . We n÷d a food critic the in this party of a town'

Also they're on the forkcast app if you don't want to talk to a human.  Love yeung!!!"

Mike Ipp, 4 years ago, 1, "They messed up my order, charged me more than my meal somehow, and were rude when I called and asked to confirm my order because he didn't give me a receipt. For delivery."
Melanie Tam, 4 years ago, 2, "I decided to order a lunch special from here one Friday afternoon, when another nearby Chinese takeout place I was about to order from was going to charge me extra for their fried rice, AND made their food with celery. That was a no for me.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty OK. I ordered chicken in garlic sauce with pork fried rice, with a side of hot and sour soup. Their mushrooms taste a bit weird, but that's not a deal breaker for me. Would probably order from here again - hold the mushrooms."

Jeremy Saxon, 4 years ago, 1, 'WHAT ARE YOU EVEN SERVING????\nMy wife and I ordered two different chicken entrees from this place. When we received our order (an hour and 15 minutes later) we were shocked and appalled by what we were being served. We cut into both entrees and could not find one piece of meat....seriously not even the $1 up charge white meat that I paid for. (What other color chicken are you serving?) The "chicken" was composed of fats and additives that were unidentifiable. We were however able to easily see there was zero chicken present. When we called the restaurant to complain the gentlemen who answered the phone stopped us mid sentence to tell the other workers what we were saying. What has happened to customer service these days??? After the phone was passed around a man finally said "All of our chicken is like this...everyone loves it." I asked who is everyone and are they human? Do not waste your time or energy with this place...if you have a go to restaurant stick with it and don\'t venture out. I\'m going to sit these meals outside for the animals to eat tonight.\n\nPS:I did not see a negative star rating I could choose which is why they are even getting 1 star.'
