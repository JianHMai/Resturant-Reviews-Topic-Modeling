Erin Rodriguez, 3 months ago, 1, 'Illuzion left a sour taste in my mouth. I was really excited to try their sushi as it was one of the few sushi restaurants in Hoboken that I haven‚Äôt tried yet. Last week, I went to go pickup my takeout order & when I got there, I was asked if I picked up the order 10 minutes ago. Turns out they gave my order to someone else. I had to wait an additional 25 minutes to get my order remade on top of the 30 minutes I had already waited.\n\nTip for the restaurant: ask for the customer‚Äôs names when you‚Äôre taking an order on the phone. Mistakes can happen when you only take the customer‚Äôs phone number.\n\nThe sushi itself was below average. The Philadelphia rolls had so much cream cheese that it reminded me of bagels from Dunkin that are notoriously always loaded with pounds of cream cheese. The rolls weren‚Äôt fresh, tasted mushy, fell apart easily, and I didn‚Äôt enjoy a single bite.'

Allan Xiao, 4 months ago, 3, "Service was good, I ordered salmon tataki but somehow they heard it as teriyaki. They refunded that so will give them a star for that.\n\nBut food overall was meh, especially for the price. Bought 2 lunch specials: 3 rolls, udon tempura. Sushi didn't taste like fish, more like sweet potatoes. Udon Tempura, shrimp was small and the tempura in general was more like biting a hard cookie and very dry. Half the udon was just greens. Didn't eat much of itÔºåjust drank the soup.\n\nSalad was just lettuce."

Melanie Tam, 3 years ago, 2, "There are not a lot of sushi options in Hoboken but this one was probably the worst one I've been too. We came in at around 9 pm on a Saturday night and the place was empty. And I know you're thinking it's probably because it's past prime dinner hours, but when we walked past its competitors around the same time (and even after), business was booming for them.\n\nI ordered the yellowtail scallion, tuna, and salmon rolls. The fish felt like it was lukewarm. I don't think it went bad or anything like that, it just tasted like they defrosted the fish and left it out for too long. My BF ordered the spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and spicy yellowtail roll. I've been telling him for years how much I dislike those rolls because all you taste is the spicy mayo, and everything ends up tasting the same. He always disagreed with me until we dined at Illuzion. He said he finally realized what I was talking about.\n\nWe also ordered some fried rice, which was surprisingly pretty good. It had a lot of black (or white?) pepper in it, which is why we liked it. So if you don't like peppery things, you should probably avoid this one. Or just try to avoid Illuzion in general."

Big empty space with umbrellas and unoccupied seats prompted us to choose this place among so many others along the beautiful and popular Washington street of the city of Hoboken. We were served; and a few moments after enjoying our deserts and drinks  - NOT QUITE FINISHED YET -     the waitress brought us the bill. Right away this may very well be understood that if we weren't going to order anything else it was time for us to pay and go. We were under the impression that we were not being welcomed since even the use of the ladies room seems to have upset them! At the end of our short visit we  decided not to tip them. And a little while after leaving, next thing we know is the waitress running after us; she was claiming we didn't leave any tip to which we responded that we didn't feel they deserve any! We asked: Was this tip under some sort of new City mandate? She couldn't answer; and for decency and to avoid any confrontation, we preferred to actually give her a minimum tip. This restaurant has a very bad attitude, very bad service. In conclusion, it is not a place to go back or even visit anymore.!"

David Butler, 4 years ago, 1, 'Took two hours for food to be delivered via grubhub. Called and was told my order would arrive within a few minutes but still took an additional twenty minutes to arrive. Portions were small and sushi was on par with what you may pickup at a supermarket.  My first experience and most likely my last.'

Jonathan Arrabito, 5 years ago, 4, "I love this place.  This is my favorite sushi joint in Hoboken.  The service is great, the fish is fresh and the portions are decently sized.  As far as hoboken sushi goes, this one is top notch.  I have tried others in town and none are up to par with Illuzion.  I highly recommend the California Sea Urchin.  Just don't eat it all. Make sure you leave some for me. :)"

Julian, 6 years ago, 5, 'THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!! I had some sort of Shrimp Bento from the Lunch Specials. I dont remember the name from the top of my head but it was phenominal. Service was on top of everything with taking our finished plates and even the wrappers from the straws and chopsticks! They are so kind too! I gave my server a good tip and they gave me a free dessert! It was so kind they really didnt need to it was my pleasure for tipping for fine food, dining, and service!'
Luke Hansen, 6 years ago, 4, 'I was torn between giving Illuzion 3 or 4 stars.  3 stars feels a bit harsh and I decided the avocado/mango roll was unique enough to warrant 4 stars.  Illuzion is a solid sushi restaurant.  I went there for lunch and had the lunch special of 3 rolls for $13.  I went with the asparagus, sweet potato, and the aforementioned avocado/mango rolls.  The lunch special included a small salad and miso soup.  Both were what you would expect.  The rolls were good.  As mentioned, the real standout was the avocado/mango.  I have never had mango in a roll.  It was very refreshing.  I would go back just for those.  The service was friendly and attentive.  My one critique is the appearance of the sushi bar.  I would recommend sprucing that space up a bit.  There was duct tape on the metal "cabinet" that houses the raw fish.  It looked worn and needs to be fixed to be more appealing to those patrons sitting at the bar.'
Joe McDonald, 6 years ago, 1, "Terrible. The skin was still on the fish. They didn't even use sushi rice, so it fell apart in my hand. Gross."
Jeremy Gollehon, 7 years ago, 2, "Ordered sashimi, sushi, and chicken teriyaki for delivery. Food arrived in 20 minutes and was literally the worst I've had. Dry rice, stale chicken, blah fish. I'll give them another shot in the restaurant to see if they actually deliver fresh food to the table. They obviously sent us leftovers from lunch for dinner delivery.  Why 2 stars? The miso soup was excellent. :-)"
Shep Di Cesare, 7 years ago, 5, "Best sushi in Hoboken, hands down.   We've been ordering and going for years.  Their special chef rolls are the best."

Ama Geewandara, 8 years ago, 5, 'Sushi and sashimi was (fresh and well prepared) great. The miso soup and salad came with it was not as great as sushi or sashimi. Good sized portions and reasonably priced. Nothing to complain or praise about the service. It was a generally OK service. I would go there again.'

Joe J., 8 years ago, 4, "Beef tataki was awesome. Actually the appetizers in general were awesome. The entrees were pretty standard. I didn't get to try any rolls. I like that they provide brown rice. Yay for health"
Sei Lee, 9 years ago, 2, "Rude service and  mediocre sushi. Why take reservation if you were going to give out tables to others? Walk in customers served prior to people who reserved. Food was just mediocre. Can't believe this place get rave reviews. Fake Chinese sushi place owned by Chinese and they drive u out when u r not even done with the food and giving out the check. Not coming back."
