Jeff Bennett, 20 hours ago, 5, "Came in on a busy Sunday night 11/14.  Not an overly large space so we were very lucky they could accommodate our family group of 7.  We were greeted by our server who was upbeat and friendly.  The staff functioned together like a winning team.  We were attended to by everyone, especially the manager who kept the entire restaurant moving.  This burger experience was truly memorable beginning with the presentation.  The freshness of all the ingredients is obvious with every bite.  The temperature of the beef was cooked to a perfect medium with plenty of pink.  BYOB is much appreciated, love being able to pair a local craft beer with an amazing meal!  Don't think, just go!"

Atala Duarte, a month ago, 1, 'Bad customer service.  We arrived at 9:30pm and they close at 10pm. Pretty much we were rush to order because.  The fries were cold, the chicken breast was hard as rock, like when the chicken still frozen and they still fried it, the shake was extremely super sweet.  It‚Äôs hard to understand the state of New Jersey, people want to make money but they never want to work.  We went because of the reviews but it was awful, the whole experience was bad, food and service. If you are from here you might like it because that‚Äôs the NJ normal, but if you are from out state don‚Äôt wasted your money.'

Jon Gimpel, 2 months ago, 2, 'I get it. We are in a pandemic but ordering from here is so hit or miss when online ordering.  Just be honest with times instead of having people wait 20-30 minutes PAST the estimated time. Short staffed?  Change the actual eta time of pick up.  Plenty other places to go to.  Burgers are not worth and hour wait.'
Regina Jaslow, 2 months ago, 5, 'They have a wide range of burger patty options including bison and impossible burger options.

Melanie Tam, 3 months ago, 4, "Ordered for pick-up one lazy weekday evening. I had the Supreme (beef, colby, smoked bacon, chopped fries, onion rings, lettuce, special sauce, brioche bun) but I did something dumb. I swapped out the brioche for sourdough because I thought the sourdough would hold up better for takeout. I was sorely mistaken. It was actually the opposite because my husband had the Wrangler and the brioche on that held up pretty well. But back to my burger. I forgot to request medium rare, so it came out as a medium but it was still pretty good. The onion rings were surprisingly still crispy. It's a pretty huge burger so I ate half for dinner and half for lunch the next day and the leftovers were actually not terrible. I remember ordering the same burger at the Edgewater location a few years ago and liked it. The french fries and onion rings just get me every time.\n\nAre these burgers worth $15? Probably not but if you want a burger in Hoboken, this is a solid option. Next time, I will dine in for a fresh one and hopefully branch out from my typical order."

Nikki Ehlers, a year ago, 1, 'While I‚Äôve had good experiences in the past, tonight was the worst takeout experience I‚Äôve had in a very long time and I will absolutely never give this establishment my money or energy again.\n\nI ordered 2 burgers, fries, and brussel sprouts for delivery. They came quicker than usual, which was surprising and I was excited to dig in.\n\nHowever, upon biting into my burger it was cold and tasted oddly like metallic. When I cut open the burger, it was absolutely RAW. The meat looked entirely UNCOOKED.\n\nKnowing that mistakes happen, I called immediately to let them know what happened. The manager instantly hopped on the phone and told me that it was my fault and that there was nothing she could do, because I ordered it medium rare so I should expect the cooks to think that‚Äôs how I wanted it. I will say that I ordered a medium rare burger, and have done so from multiple BareBurger locations in the past. THIS burger was NOT medium rare - this burger was RAW, UNCOOKED, hamburger meat. I‚Äôm thoroughly disgusted and it would‚Äôve been understandably a mistake if the manager wasn‚Äôt the rudest woman I‚Äôve ever spoken to in my entire life.\n\nShe finally said she‚Äôd send me a new burger, but by her attitude, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they spit in it too.\n\nGood luck giving your patrons food poisoning.'

Trixie 1127, a year ago, 2, 'We try to support small local businesses. We really do, even though money is tight. Most businesses run on skeleton crews and delays and mistakes happen. But most mistakes can be fixed on the spot, and most small businesses try very hard to show their customers how much they appreciate the support. This time, we feel we made a colossal mistake in deciding to treat ourselves to a couple of burgers.\n\nNormally, we cook at home, from scratch, but sometimes nothing will do but a good burger from a burger joint. We ordered a curbside pickup. An order of two burgers, one side of fries, a salad, and two milkshakes came to about $80. When we picked up the order (took twice as long as they told us) and hurried home to eat it while it was still hot, we discovered one burger literally bare--a naked patty in a bun, all the trimmings forgotten--and the $7.99 milkshakes the size of a deli coffee cup (8 oz). There was nothing we could do at that point besides completely ruining the rest of our evening by trying to confront them, and to what end? The patty in a bun was tasty enough, but tossed into the bag naked like that definitely not worth the price.\n\nThe worst of it is not that this left us feeling poorly served and ripped off. The worst of it is that it kills the desire to try takeout again anytime soon. As I said, we can feed ourselves. But we like to try to support local businesses, and with no money to burn right now, we will probably tend to avoid the risk of running into being extorted $7.99 for what is essentially a cup of milk.'

I stood at the entrance for a while and nobody welcomed or asked me anything.  After a few minutes, it took a male server or was it the manager to come from the back to welcome me and let me know there was a small wait for a table.  The male servers and the manager were very hospitable.\n\nFood: I frequent the Bareburgers in NYC and food and service is always A1.  This Hoboken shop however is the worst.  I was baffled at the mess which was served to me.  It looked as if a child prepared the food.  My large fries was stuck together in one runny clump.  Under cooked and a hot mess.  The burger was the absolute worst I ever had.  I asked for "well done" meat and got uncooked meat.  I bit into the meat and it was still frozen and uncooked!  I could not eat it.  A complete waste of money!'

The jam really tastes weird and I wish I had ordered something else. The Impossible burger was great. Overall, I was disappointed by the main reason I came to this place: the food. I remember getting a much bigger portion when I came to this restaurant last year. I guess they decided to cut down. Kind of a shame. It is byob though"

The white people who have gentirified Hoboken wouldn‚Äôt notice the outrageous prices (still going up) as this is the only well known burger joint in town. It‚Äôs sort of a hit or miss at times.\n\nYou‚Äôll order food and they‚Äôll provide you with only ketchup, as they expect you to eat ketchup with everything, giving you only 2 packs ‚Äî even if your lunch turns out to be over $20 or ordered multiple things off their menu...you‚Äôre expected to buy other sauces, which taste average, but as I stated previously the white ppl who have gentirifed Hoboken will take what they get because it‚Äôs ‚ÄúHoboken‚Äù.\n\nUgh and the portion size ... YIKESSSSS .. it won‚Äôt fill you up AT ALL.\n\nI don‚Äôt know about you all but I like my fries crispy and fresh. Their sweet potato fries come wet and mushy and as I stated earlier, very expensive. The buns they use tend to be a bit on the stale side from time to time. As I stated, it‚Äôs a hit or miss.\n\nLastly, the wait.. yikes. Don‚Äôt go during typical lunch hour. I think they‚Äôre understaffed and you will be waiting over an hour for your food. I have receipt images of order times versus when the food is received... in case we really need to go there. Just saying ..\n\nI think if you‚Äôre going to try and price things so high can we (the people who are REAL HOBOKENITES, born and raised and not easily impressed by much of the facade and only want good food) get better QUALITY in the food. The pictures look great but it doesn‚Äôt always turn out looking that way in person.\n\nI gave it two stars for its potential.'

We didn't have to wait long to be seated, but it took awhile before a server came to us.  After we placed our order, it took another 40 or so minutes for our food to arrive (the waiter told us the apps would come out first, but both the apps and entrees came out at the same time).  Our chicken fingers were extremely overcooked, but the onion rings were spot on.  I had one of their standard burgers and it was good, but nothing to write home about.  My girlfriend got the black bean burger, and reported that it was terrible.  Overall, a mixed experience, but I would only come back to this specific Bareburger if I was really craving this experience."
Nik, 3 years ago, 5, "Worthy! The rustic homestead style decor of this hipster burger joint immediately conveys authenticity in its message of organic farm-reared food and it certainly delivers faithfully on this front.\n\nI ordered the 'Southern Caviar' bison burger, which with its country bacon worked well with the subtle kick of the horseradish remoulade. Together they reminded me of fresh breakfast farm food housed within the cosy confines of two soft and sweet layers of bread.\n\nTo complement the main event, I ordered half rings and half fries. The rings were absolutely on point and could even contend for the best I've ever had with their crispy casing dotted with herbs, along with the soft and warm onion slice waiting inside. The fries on the other hand, although lightly garnished in visible salt crystals, were soft to the bite which wasn't incredibly satisfying for someone who prefers them crunchy. Paired with the Sir Kensington brand of ketchup and mustard, however, it was all very palatable: these sauces packed a punch with less sugar than the leading brands\n\nSome small misses for me: having read others' reviews here beforehand, I was originally tempted by the grilled chicken; however before ordering, the waiter informed me they'd run out which was somewhat disappointing knowing that their business day had just started.\n\nThe in-house lemonade was not so enjoyable as its bitter pungency was closer in taste to fermented ginger ale than a summery sweet and sour drink.\n\nFinally, even though I came for lunch at noon on a Thursday when there was plenty of seating available, and although polite and helpful with ordering, the waiting staff were laxed in their regularity of passing by the table.\n\nDespite these minor shortcomings, this is a thoroughly recommendable lunch place if you're looking for a healthier burger option in Hoboken."
