Jessica Milton, 2 weeks ago, 1, 'I can‚Äôt tell you how the pizza is because I never got it. I called this place and ordered an hour ahead to give myself a decent cushion of time. I show up when the pizza is supposed to be ready and I wait.. and wait.. and wait. I‚Äôm a patient person and I could see the poor kid was stressed so I tried to be cool about it. But after an hour waiting (past the time the pizza was supposed to be ready) I simply asked for my money back. At which point the owner told the cooks he didn‚Äôt need it so they stopped making it. Why they were just making it then is beyond me.\n\nThere were a few others ahead of me who were also upset because their orders got lost, were done incorrectly, or were waiting excessively. I get it, you‚Äôre slammed. So don‚Äôt tell people to come in 40 minutes maybe? I had my 1 year old exhausted and hungry in the car. Now I have a tired baby and no dinner. Extremely disappointing.'

followJTusa JT USA, a year ago, 1, "Review posted October 7, 2020. Hoboken, USA. Napoli's: This place is no good for indoor dining: delivery people pick up at the dining area and the comings-and-goings indoors ruined my reunion with a friend who came all the way from Brooklyn. As for the food, I ordered Eggplant Parm with Spaghetti and my guest ordered Chicken with Spaghetti. A big mistake  because the overcooked spaghetti was soggy; the sauce was watery; and the whole dish was served barely above room temperature! The eggplants tasted ok but were ok but were also not hot enough. My guest could not contain her disappoinment. Even the olive oil for dipping was a letdown. The only good point was the bread that nicely sliced and oven-warmed. Moreover, we did not not get any Parmegiano-Reggiano served with our spaghetti. (Who does that?!? I mean, not care about the food they serve)! In the meantime, there was so much noise coming from the kitchen. As for masks worn by workers at the pizza oven? That's another story _ not to mention a bunch of pizza boxes that fell to the floor that were re-stacked with the rest of the clean boxes!\nI was beyond embarrassed to have invited my friend to try Napoli's, a pizzeria/restaurant  I hand't been to in years. The lady I later called at Napoli's sounded disinterested and angry, not at all interested with my feedback. As an excuse, she just cited her issues! (I guess I will not be too adventurous next time and will stay close to our tried-and-true Hoboken Italian faves, the majority of which are mostly downtown to midtown). Sorry, Rena, my friend from Brooklyn. I was going to impress you with Hoboken Italian. Next time, we'll go to our trusted Italian places in Hoboken. (I miss Tutta Pasta!!! Where are you, dear Fortunato...)"

Katherine Kaplan, a year ago, 3, 'The worst pizza I have had in Hoboken. Sat down and ordered 2 slices of pizza to dine in midday. (Clearly a mistake, since someone came up to us acting like a waiter, yet another couple of people ordered their pizza inside to-go, then ate out of their to-go box at a table across from us without issue as if it was a fast food place.) Both of the slices were terrible, the dough for both was dry like a cracker and very hard to chew, seemed like they took two very old slices of pizza and reheated them. The toppings on the second slice were fresh and the only part I enjoyed.'
Ruben Sanrelus, a year ago, 1, 'Where do I start? It took quite awhile for my lady and I to be acknowledged when we arrived here. There was no sign mentioning self seating and the waiter seemed to be engaged in a conversation with no regard to the fact that there were people waiting at the entrance. We went inside to speak to someone about seating and the gentleman said we would receive help from the waiter outside. We go back outside and the waiter looks at us and then goes inside. Then he came out and finally acknowledged us and said we can seat ourselves. That took way too long. Then the waiter takes our order of a calamari appetizer and a large pizza. After we finish our calamari, a woman brings out our pizza on a metal plate and stand. The pizza was clearly too big for their small tables, but she tried to fit this pizza onto our table regardless and while trying to move a glass, this scorching hot pizza slid towards my lady‚Äôs chest in which she blocked with her hand and ended up suffering from a severe burn on her hand and a glass fell off the table and spilled over me. The girl seemed remorseful initially, but she never came to check on us again for the rest of our time there. After this incident, another table was brought out to us for the pizza to sit on. Once again it‚Äôs a large pizza on a stand. I slide out one slice of pizza, this threw off the balance of the metal plate and the rest of the pizza slid off onto the floor. The waiter says don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll get you guys another one, but it was as if he assumed the pizza falling onto the ground was my fault. This incident was bound to happen again because they were prepared to use that same useless stand again and I had to ask him to remove the stand and just provide the pizza on the silver plate. All this happened and no manager ever came up to us to discuss what happened. No one cares that a customer had been burned by an employee. Worst customer service experience ever.'

Got a space in front of Napoli, but that's the only good new. What a disappointment. The crust on both the margarita pie and the classic NY pie and on every pie being set on other tables were severly over-cooked. Ours didn't have any bread- like qualities like an ingredient was missing. No way to fold a slice without snapping it in your hand. The NY pie was molten orange with nothing resembling red sauce or real mozzarella. The margherita had some red sauce and had white mozzarella circles, but they were scorched too and there was very little flavor. Have to say that the servers were great. The place was doing a strong take out and delivery business and there were plenty of diners. I just can't figure why. GM"

They said it was out fault even though we specifically asked for 3 things on a personal pie. We poured the CEASER dressing unknowingly all over the pie. Called again to let them know how much of a mistake was made by them.

We got a large pepperoni and sausage, got only a large COLD sausage with half the cheese gone..also looks like the guy dropped it. They are already closed aka not taking calls and no way to contact on site so I guess this is the only way to complain. I ate half a piece and pitched it. Both myself and boyfriend felt sick shortly after eating the minimum that we did. Definitely contacted my credit card company already'

Delicious!!  Also,  all their servers were new and knew nothing about the menu items.  Not a bad thing,  albeit concerning from a turnover stand point,  but they were all very nice and tending.

Theyre incapable of taking a and delivering a pizza order.\n\nNo your manager was not cOrrect. First of all. I gave your delivery driver the cash 2 years ago and he told me no the order is paid for.  Afterwards I received 10 calls and text message past 11pm at night.  Your staff was texting me from their personal cell phones telling me the driver was going to be fired.  This was your mistake. Not mine.  Secondly. I spoke to someone and took care of this. I placed an order and gave the driver $20 additional to square away this mistake.  Thirdly. Your manager did not call or even mention anything. He let me wait for my food loft 2 hours.  So no I do not want to speak to you. This is a joke and so is your restaurant.  You need to train your drivers better and your staff because they‚Äôre competent icomprtent.'

The rollatini was one small piece (for $10) and it wasn‚Äôt even edible.  Was rubber and had to be thrown away.  The pizza we asked for it to be not well done and it came extra crispy.  We hope they get better but it doesn‚Äôt appear that way based off our last few orders.'
Bresiamoa, 3 years ago, 5, "There are also no rules about the kinds of toppings you put on your pizza. Choose ones you love. They will cook a little in the oven, but if it isn't something you like to eat raw, like sausage or mushrooms, allow some time to cook them ahead of time. If you'd like fresh greens, like arugula or basil, on your pizza, sprinkle them over the pizza right when it comes out of the oven. The residual heat from the pizza will wilt the greens just slightly and bring out their flavor.\n\nIt's best, though, to keep the toppings to just a handful at most. If you load homemade pizza down with a ton of toppings, it may take too long for the crust to cook well.\n\nPile on the cheese or keep it all veg for a healthier midweek meal; it's all up to you. Play around with this basic recipe and make it your own.\n\nNapoli's pizza is the best in town and i am always glad they fufill my order in a toast and timely manner."
